00:00:03.480 - 00:00:34.018, Speaker A: I wish it went louder. It is like waking up from a dream listening to this music. And maybe the big takeaway while I was gone, the big insight, and it was so short and so, so small. Just a few words. And as we, you know, what we're doing here, these are the words I woke up with in the middle of the night. This is forever. That is what we're doing here as artists.
00:00:34.018 - 00:01:00.286, Speaker A: This is forever. Artist Journal, May 8, 2024. Broadcasting from the inner half of the nervous system. My name is Adrian Pokebelli. Music or no music, I am here. I am here. So thank you all, each individual soul that has returned here to see what is going on on this humble channel here.
00:01:00.286 - 00:01:50.414, Speaker A: So I just got back from vacation hilariously, hilariously, fittingly, poetically. The last video, as some of you will have noticed, just kind of froze halfway through, which I thought, in a weird way, I mean, I feel kind of, to a certain degree, I feel bad for the artist, because any press as an artist, especially when you're, you know, quote unquote emerging, is good press. There's no such thing as bad publicity, as they say. So even if you're on this channel, it's unfortunate for the artists who were in the last half of the episode where the. You could still hear me, but the frame was frozen. But all to say, clearly, it was time for a vacation. And indeed, I got the vacation that I was looking for, which is really to just forget about everything.
00:01:50.414 - 00:02:29.374, Speaker A: Forget about everything and do the basics that I need to do in my life and whatnot. It's been three, over three weeks since we last hung out here. So, anyway, thank you, everybody, for coming back. And I don't want to push the computer. So before I begin on a pretty cool journey here today, as ever, it's always interesting out here with beautiful works like this. And, you know, this is on Zora, and I'll get into this in a second, but I'm so glad they fixed this. This is something I've been waiting for, you know, praying for forever, which is just a simple kind of maximize tool.
00:02:29.374 - 00:03:04.048, Speaker A: But all to say, there was. Were too many tabs. Clearly, there were too many bookmarks. I got through about a third of them, and I really want to keep these shows, like, at an hour max. I'm embarrassed when I talk to people and I say, you know how long these shows are? You know how long the shows were getting? Because everybody, universally, of the few people I told were like, yeah, that is way too long. And I totally agree, even though, you know, some people love it. And, you know, some people work while it's on and everything.
00:03:04.048 - 00:03:46.334, Speaker A: So all to say, though, but for my own sanity, I think, I just think they should be, you know, and I think also, which brings up an interesting topic, also, also for mainstream appeal, like, I mean, I think it's important. And I've been thinking about this with the whole farcaster thing. Again, my big, I have two concerns with it. And first of all, I'm very happy for all of the, I'm happy with people are happy putting out their stuff, sharing their stuff, feeling maybe like they're getting more reach. Right. But I do have, you know, some lingering thoughts and I'm open minded about it. So I'm curious what other people think.
00:03:46.334 - 00:04:11.238, Speaker A: And maybe I'm just totally getting ahead of the show here. But while we're on the topic. Yeah, well, actually, I don't want to get into it now. We'll get into it later. We'll get into it in the comments because I don't really want to give it more. The art is the focus here, not thoughts on different social media platforms. But what I was getting at, which was the concern, which is one of the concerns, which is we want to appeal to people outside the bubble.
00:04:11.238 - 00:04:57.944, Speaker A: So if I make this show an hour and a half, I think that actually will attract less people from outside the bubble. And that is the concern with Farcaster, that really it just becomes a crypto bubble that if you don't know metamask, you like, are you using farcast or warpcast or. Right. So I, and I love it in the sense that, like, I was just reading who was it again? Like governments, military, it's all on X. And this, I will say this part because I don't want to forget it, which is don't underestimate what you've built on X. And I'm multi platform, so use all, like, I'm on Warpcast. So I put the stuff, you know, there's only so much bandwidth, but I'm not against using it.
00:04:57.944 - 00:06:11.988, Speaker A: But what I want to iterate or reiterate and say that I think is very important is many of you have built platform on X where even if you have like a thousand followers, even if you're getting ten retweets, that's comparable to some of the biggest galleries in the world. Okay? And we did that show about a year, over a year ago where we went to the different social media feeds. And when there's a little less art, when I'm a bit more caught up, I'm going to take about three or four days or shows to get caught up. But once we have a little bit more kind of shorter shows, because I'm catching up with the last three and a half weeks, then I want to go back to those social media platforms. How is Gagosian doing? Maybe they've grown at 100 x since the last time we looked. But all to say, there's something very valuable in that, in terms of the world outside the bubble. And so that is my own kind of, you know, just thing I would want to point out and make sure that people are aware of.
00:06:11.988 - 00:07:30.732, Speaker A: You may have more value there than you think, and not because of what collector might buy your work within the bubble of crypto, but really about, you know, people. Again, you're in the same province as power, as, you know, the government, okay? And you're a player in there with way more traction than probably almost everybody, you know, because of this cool NFT community that's very supportive. So if you put out your work, you know, it's not crazy for you to get a few retweets where most people coming on X have nothing. They get one. Like, if they're lucky, nobody sees anything. If you're reach, if you think your reach is bad, wait until you see what someone who just comes onto the platform gets with no NFT community. I know, because I've lived it where you have six or seven years where nobody cares what you're doing, and you basically get one charity, like, from someone who thinks that, oh, that was kind of cool, right? So I'll just say multi platform over here, you know, so I'm all for hedging.
00:07:30.732 - 00:08:20.992, Speaker A: And hey, if you're selling a lot of work using other platforms, awesome, right? If that's helping your art situation, a very tough business. You know, I'd say Hollywood acting and dancing are maybe the two harder, you know, things you can do in this life as far as quote unquote, making it and succeeding. So if you're getting some traction using other platforms, I'm 100% for it as an artist, but I would just say in that spirit of succeeding in the long term, I would just make that kind of. That is something that's kind of at the back of my mind that I've been thinking about. So let's begin here. Seven, eight minutes in as we continue here to struggle to make this show shorter. So here is the great cap.
00:08:20.992 - 00:08:53.449, Speaker A: And there is not much time on this. This is a seven day mint and only 35 have been minted. Six days, 10 hours have happened. Firmware update mainframe zero two free mint on Zora creator earning 0.015. So maybe it's more expensive, which is. Maybe it's not a free mint 0.015 sounds like about what I mean, that is like $45 actually, and still getting 35 minutes.
00:08:53.449 - 00:09:17.378, Speaker A: So isn't that interesting? And also getting. I don't know what enjoy this token here is worth, but also getting some extra tokens here. All to say, let's look at the work itself. Interesting colors, isn't it? Almost this faded turquoise. Everything has a bit of a. Bit of a faded. The color is quite remarkable, actually, I would say.
00:09:17.378 - 00:09:49.520, Speaker A: And so is the composition. Bit of a phone composition in terms of the ratio here. Interesting how brilliant and beautiful this would look on your, you know, smartphone if you were to show this to someone. And so back, I think it's this mainframe series. Here's mainframe zero two, the title in the workplace, which is always an interesting kind of element. And again, these kind of what I'd call horizontally ratioed pixels here. All sorts of stuff going on.
00:09:49.520 - 00:10:05.728, Speaker A: And I think this is using a couple of. One really old software. And I think Gimp is. I think the combo here that kappan was mentioning when we did the. This is part of admin Core. How cool is that? Slash admin core. Mainframe zero two.
00:10:05.728 - 00:10:31.858, Speaker A: So here we are, 31 minters at zero point. I mean, maybe this is a way of doing things. Maybe you do raise the price and because, I mean, that is like, because the regular mint would have a zero. So this is like getting 310 mints at the free, you know, to back of the envelope. Guess so. All to say, captain, back in form here. And just excited, you know, is that reptilian? I don't.
00:10:31.858 - 00:10:53.664, Speaker A: I know. Not why I started with that work. It's just beautiful and captured my imagination. Speaking of capturing my imagination, Tornado Rodriguez is going to be on the show today. I'm very pleased to have her as the feature guest. And who put out all those awesome object 98 Microsoft paintworks that I'll look at in a second here. And she's going to be on the show today.
00:10:53.664 - 00:11:20.532, Speaker A: So if you happen to see this, it may be, if I just posted it, this may be plain, because it's going to be a couple hours after I post this, maybe less or about the same time. I may post it right before. So, same day here. Trinado Rodriguez on digital art and illustration. Just a really cool digital art illustrator out of Argentina. And here's tornado. Just to give you a taste here as an argentinian, I am very used to my currency being worth less every day.
00:11:20.532 - 00:12:12.524, Speaker A: Therefore, bear markets scare me less and less every day. And of course, Argentina, like Turkey, has a ton of crypto people because they've had inflation problems, which is why we have so many, which is my theory, which I think is a pretty solid theory as to why we have such an out performance, or how would we say, let's just call it that, of artists from Turkey and Argentina? Punching above their weight class is how I like to put it. There is a huge amount from both those countries, and I suspect it's because they are crypto countries, and therefore, there is just a higher amount of people. And the more artists you have, probably the more great art, the more. The more artists you have, the more great artists you will have. Interestingly so. And here, of course, are some of the works I was pointing out.
00:12:12.524 - 00:12:31.544, Speaker A: Love these works. We've been looking at them the last few shows. They did really well. Look at these secondary prices. So look at that. And it's really. I'm getting increasingly fascinated by value in, like, what I would loosely call a pixel artwork.
00:12:31.544 - 00:13:00.084, Speaker A: And we're going to see a tweet by Ed Morolla reopening the discussion of the definitions, offering a new definition. We will see that shortly. But there's something kind of precious, and having just. I put out the inferno, what did I call it? The pixel art Inferno, I hope to do the other. The Purgatorio and the. And the paradiso on bitcoin, four kilobyte files. There's something just weirdly precious about the pixel art.
00:13:00.084 - 00:13:41.394, Speaker A: It continues to resonate, is a. You know, we're talking with August ground. Was it last week? Really great space with August ground. Maybe it was two weeks ago. It was two weeks ago, because we had Daniel King on last week. And what I liked about August ground as a thinker, for sure, and what he was saying was these different. He was kind of noticing, observing, one of the things that we've been observing over here, which is the significance of these different genres that are emerging within this, what I loosely call the second generation of digital art, which I refer to as people who grew up with video games.
00:13:41.394 - 00:14:45.096, Speaker A: Okay? And he was saying, you know, a lot of the ones we recognize here, pixel art. AI, right, you could glitch, right? There are three pillars right there. There's about six or seven, but those are probably three of the biggest, interestingly, that are, you might say, kind of native to the second generation. Of course, you know, there's some kind of pixel art before, but it's not really now is again, it's got the pixel art of today. And I'd say it's, you know, or the pixelated art of today. Interesting distinction is, again, you get the sense of this, someone who grew up with video games, that excitement, that compositional excitement, which, frankly, is shared, you know, a similar excitement. I get to a beautifully colored Renaissance painting, you know, at least for me, you know, beautiful italian Renaissance painting, the oil, you see it in person, that excitement, weirdly, you know, and it took me a while to come to it.
00:14:45.096 - 00:15:20.522, Speaker A: I find in the pixel art, some of it, right? So I'll just say there's something weirdly precious. And again, these are minted on object, of course, using their tool. But these are probably very small files that could be minted on bitcoin or inscribed or made a stamp. Some people are pretty, you know, strongly saying, like, the stamp is the. The ordinals can still be pruned, so to speak, but the stamps are forever. So all to say in a very cool illustrator, here is. I wax poetic on tornado Rodriguez work and what she's up to.
00:15:20.522 - 00:15:50.238, Speaker A: And here's just a physical, you know, it reminds me of this Warhol. One of my favorite Warhol drawings that I saw in Rome, actually, about five years ago, big Warhol show. And there was a truck that was drawn, and Warhol ran out of space, and so he attached another piece of paper and finish the truck. And it kind of reminds me of that a little bit here. This beautiful. Almost like playing card king and the sword, you know, suggestively dropping here. Interesting.
00:15:50.238 - 00:16:00.046, Speaker A: Beautiful piece. Beautiful piece. Big thank you to cider. Look at this. Hilarious. I had this photo. This is actually, you know, I probably shouldn't say it.
00:16:00.046 - 00:16:13.528, Speaker A: I won't say it. This is a photo I had. And so cider made. Hilarious. It was kind of perfect for a cider portrait. Went for a huge amount over here at 0.4 eth, and cider was super cool.
00:16:13.528 - 00:16:29.952, Speaker A: Thank you, Toddy. And also thank you to the other bidder. Where is the other bidder? Here. It was sold to Toddy, and cider was super cool. Ahead of time. Asked me if I wanted 100% 50 50, and I was like, I don't know. You decide that.
00:16:29.952 - 00:16:52.724, Speaker A: I was like, let's just do 50 50, and that's wonderful for me. And look at that. So big shout out and thank you to cider. Not only does the portrait of you, but splits the winnings class act over there. Now, I don't know. I almost doubt this was done on purpose to look like me, but it kind of looks like me, which I thought was kind of hilarious. Skomra put this out and someone tagged me.
00:16:52.724 - 00:17:22.354, Speaker A: We miss you. Pokemelly I don't know if this is actually supposed to be me or not, but it's kind of funny. It may not and so I don't want to dwell on it too much, but all the same, beautiful work by skammer which happens to look like me and someone tagged me there and so let's leave it at that. Here is the video in question, which got frozen halfway through. Still 421 views. Thank you for the support and the likes. Let's look at the comments.
00:17:22.354 - 00:17:34.132, Speaker A: PP Universal amazing show poco. Keep it on and thanks for the feature. Great to hear from you PP and DJ Kuro. Thanks man. Amazing to be featured at the start of your show. Life is complete. I can retire now.
00:17:34.132 - 00:18:01.510, Speaker A: Funny you mentioned the flower one looked like NUV 1914 because it was. It's our first collab on foundation. Yeah, sometimes it's hard to figure out the authors or the artists on foundation for some reason when you collab. So thanks for letting me know. And yeah, huge fan of both your works. Nub 1914. Just awesome artist as well as Kiro, who's been doing it for quite a while, doing glitch since, you know, at least 2010.
00:18:01.510 - 00:18:22.926, Speaker A: He knew a friend of mine. Anyways, we talked about that in a previous show, Ratta Hey Adrian, thank you for that overview of my copy paste studies around collectible cardboard rectangles. Eventually I'll continue with the final chapter about Alistair Crowley's deck and the Hermetic Society. Best wishes. Thank you very much. Radda. I actually had that deck.
00:18:22.926 - 00:18:54.104, Speaker A: I probably mentioned that in the previous episode where we discussed these. Yeah, it's kind of a harder deck to get. You almost have to order it or that sort of thing. It's not like the is it the rider tarot that everybody knows? So it's all very interesting. It's kind of one of those subjects that I think tempts all artists at some point to do their own tarot deck. So I'll just say, just rad to hear from you, Rada, as ever. And thanks for the info.
00:18:54.104 - 00:19:20.324, Speaker A: And looking forward to hearing about that. Kyle Flemmer KF while the Kristin Russ article is super interesting, thank you for reminding me. Thank you for reminding me. That is super interesting. And I have to dig that up where Kristin Roos goes through all of the vintage software. And as I like to say, if you run out of ideas as an artist. Or you hit a wall, try a new software because it's like painting with a different kind of paint.
00:19:20.324 - 00:19:38.980, Speaker A: It's like using a different kind of brush. And all of a sudden, you know what seemed hard is all of a sudden everything might work right. So new software can be inspiring. It can be interesting. Sometimes you just got to find your. It's like you got to find your people. You got to find your tools.
00:19:38.980 - 00:19:55.442, Speaker A: Stuart Reed great show. The artist you showed briefly, chain left. Not sure if you've talked about him before, but he's an on chain artist, original gangster Og and wrote about the history of on chain art. Very interesting. Would love to have him on the spaces, dig through his work. It's cool. Like chaos.
00:19:55.442 - 00:20:22.210, Speaker A: Rhodes for example, dynamic art with an adjustable entropy variable chain left. I need to remember this because I would love to have that person on the spaces if that person is available. Morte spiral great fam. Great to hear from you. Ezo bio amazing. Thank you. And Chrysos is Jeff Goldblum his father? No, that is Gustavo Pocabelli.
00:20:22.210 - 00:20:42.854, Speaker A: And so, yeah, but I do. It is the comparison I get more than any other is the Jeff Goldblum comparison. HJ great as always. Thank you. HJ low trips. Half of the video is broken, but don't worry poco, it makes it very artsy. Thank you for the charity, my friend and the great plank Cedar.
00:20:42.854 - 00:21:09.514, Speaker A: I was actually looking, I think it was Kells who was saying what happened to waffles? Or I miss Waffles and indeed. Hi, thanks. Pokebelly leprechaun has exquisite taste with cinema and we share some favorite directors. So I will defer to him with regard to BTC or bitcoin topics as he seems to be dialed into it. And quite astute. Definitely cool to see Rinny and Lepro out in front of the ordinals idea. I dig it.
00:21:09.514 - 00:21:45.068, Speaker A: Now, good news if you haven't minted on ordinals and this is something you want to do, the fees are pretty low still. Remember we got the warning from Gamma from Nick at Gamma IO that better mint before the halving because otherwise fees are about to go through the roof. As long as bitcoin is not insanely high and fees are not bad. It calmed down after the whole runes thing. Zany Yegar amazing poco. So all to say, let's just do a quick look. That's April 13.
00:21:45.068 - 00:22:04.774, Speaker A: We'll see if plank Cedar look at how great this is. One of our favorites here and here. That awesome work by Yuri J. I'm not sure if this is new or not. I added it to the show. And thank you for the retweet and of course, pixel art on ordinals, the entrance to hell. So thank you for all the support on that.
00:22:04.774 - 00:22:18.794, Speaker A: Quite fort. That's actually pretty good support. I didn't realize. So thank you for all the tweets, everyone. So, all to say, so, cedar plank still around. It's been a couple of weeks, but still around. And also now the community.
00:22:18.794 - 00:22:58.596, Speaker A: Thank you, everybody, for posting. Very cool to see. Now, I'm thinking I may introduce a rule which is maybe only putting like, say, a couple of works per week, because otherwise what happens is sometimes people are excited to just have somewhere to show their work for someone to see it, which is totally understandable. But then what happens is they drown out everybody else and it kind of starts to overwhelm the feed. This is a really cool work, by the way, by san. By Sanrow, Barbara Sanro. But, you know, if you do too many, then it starts to lose its impact as well.
00:22:58.596 - 00:23:10.788, Speaker A: So it's also to the benefit of the artist. And look at this. Ed Marolla. A quick view over the last month's creation. So I totally want it. So masterclass by pixel art Marolla. I still need to get the Pixel network up and running again.
00:23:10.788 - 00:24:00.958, Speaker A: You know what was insane? Uploading the show in Rome took about 10 seconds. You know how long it takes here in Berlin? About 45 minutes to an hour for each platform. I may go for a coffee after because it's slightly faster using the mall Internet to upload to Twitter. So, yeah, so that's why the Pixel network is a little slow right now, because it's taken me so long to upload. I'm almost tempted to get the Elon Musk's Starlink, because if I have to pay $60 a month, and then I don't need to worry about this, and I get the 1 minute upload. What's your time worth? How much could I make? You know, selling art, making art that I could sell, I could probably make $60, probably pretty easily with that much extra time. So it's just kind of interesting.
00:24:00.958 - 00:24:16.918, Speaker A: Ernesto ash coming soon. So that looks pretty interesting. Thank you, Ernesto, for sharing. And thank you, everybody. So I can't go through it all, but I want to give you a little taste here. Here's another one by Sanro and Filippo Francocci. Raw drawing on paper.
00:24:16.918 - 00:24:39.440, Speaker A: So more cool works here from Filippo. And Skull takes Frank Stella. Yeah, so, Frank Stella, I think. Yeah, passed away. Right. And now Frank Stella made those huge, if I'm not mistaken. Of course, I was making the news there before the, or at least during, while I was gone there, or at least short before.
00:24:39.440 - 00:25:02.986, Speaker A: Here's the thread, I think made the huge. Exactly. So made these works. Now, wasn't it the guy with the sculpture and the epic sculptures who I'm confusing Frank Stella with? Yeah. So all to say, Frank Stella made these abstracts. There was another guy who made the monumental sculpture who I thought actually passed away. I always confuse the two.
00:25:02.986 - 00:25:34.318, Speaker A: So weirdly, they passed away around the same time. Thank you for sharing the news. And I love it when people share the news here and that sort of thing. And just very cool work, so we can't go through all of it. But thank you, everybody, for posting here. And yeah, I think I might just put a rule in just so people, so the feed doesn't get overwhelmed, because sometimes it gets overwhelmed by people who post too much. And I understand where they're coming from, but it doesn't help you because if all of a sudden people see 100 works, people don't go, oh, now I really love it.
00:25:34.318 - 00:26:00.674, Speaker A: Just put your best work of the last week, you know, is what I would say, best couple of works. This is awesome, right? Ed posts a video that he did asking about pixel art, which we're actually going to get to this tweet. This was a great one. So I'll just say thank you, everybody. And if you want to see more, check them out on the community there. That is. You just go to my profile and you'll see the community on x and you'll see the community underneath.
00:26:00.674 - 00:27:07.616, Speaker A: So, Sterling, so back to the art market. A super interesting discussion here. Sterling Ruby's new paintings sold for $550,000 each at Frieze, New York. Are they worth that? So the art detective Katya Kazakhina, our favorite reporter here, kind of breaking, I would argue, the story to a certain degree of major, of a major softening in the traditional art market, has been putting out story after story now on the is this worth anything? And my only thing here is where were you like ten years ago asking the same question when these works were going for a million dollars? And us at home, you know, all of us, maybe some of you who are watching this are thinking to, you know, is that really worth, you know, $550,000.10 years ago when they were maybe even going for more? And, you know, so it's interesting. And I always thought, and I actually think Sterling Ruby makes some pretty interesting work. But it was always overvalued.
00:27:07.616 - 00:27:40.860, Speaker A: And it was quite obvious to, I would argue, anybody who was outside the bubble or kind of looking at things soberly within a bigger picture. So all to say, the artist market was once red hot. But auction results in recent years have been disappointing. And so again, cool artists. And just, here's just a little taste here. Let me point out something. If you spent $550,000 on a brand new painting by Ruby last week, you paid more than anyone else did for a Ruby at auction.
00:27:40.860 - 00:28:13.232, Speaker A: In the past two years, since 2018, only one person paid more than that at auction, the buyer of a massive pink hued spray painting spending $615,000. And there were a couple of interesting quotes here, I thought. Yes. And so this is the excuse that's being given a classic mid career plateau. There was a time when collectors could not get enough of Ruby's spray paintings. Now, I've long mentioned this, and I think I even have a video called this. It's a boom and bust business.
00:28:13.232 - 00:28:41.252, Speaker A: If you're not aware, if you're new to the art business, it is a boom and bus business, which makes perfect sense. Artists get hot. Everybody, you know, social proof, everybody wants to buy their work. And then it's like the opposite happens. They put out a work or put out a series of works, and people are like, meh, not sure this is worth anything. And then nobody wants to buy their work, right? So enjoy the good times as an artist. So these days, if you get anyone to buy Sterling Ruby, it's a success.
00:28:41.252 - 00:29:22.172, Speaker A: A collector told me this is obviously an exaggeration and not a kind one, but it does capture the growing awareness about a major shift that has taken place. The market has completely stopped for scores of once successful artists. Ruby's champions say that auction numbers don't tell the full story. So. And then Todd Levin here advisor is saying, well, this is just a classic mid tier plateau, mid career plateau. So interesting articles here from Katyakazuchina. If you're looking for the full articles, you can go to her twitter and then you'll go get past the paywall.
00:29:22.172 - 00:30:19.708, Speaker A: By the way, here's another one. Private foundations made artisan dealers rich. What if many are just tools for flippers? So you see the skepticism that Katya Kazakhina, and she's, I'd argue, maybe the most, like there's Jerry, Jerry Saltz, I was going to say Jerry Kagoshin, which is probably a pretty influential account. Katyakazuchina is probably one of the most renowned of the New York art kind of reporters, I would argue, maybe the most renown. I mean, once you kind of, you know, once you get past Jerry Saltz, who is the most, you know, famous. And again, just showing, just kind of hammering home, like, is this worth anything? Probably a lot of people aren't too happy about these reports because they own these paintings that she is starting to show value, skepticism towards. But I'm sure, I mean, people love.
00:30:19.708 - 00:30:42.218, Speaker A: There's kind of like a schadenfreude to this whole story of the market crashing that I'm sure is good for clicks. Interestingly so. Interesting dynamic. Again, it's like these positive and negative feedback loops. Dan control. And shout out to Dan Control, who I saw in Rome. Actually about a week, it's about a week ago, hung out with Dan.
00:30:42.218 - 00:31:12.622, Speaker A: It was awesome. 21 years old, totally has it going on upstairs. Dan control. Over the last few years, about two years in this mystical place, I've become increasingly convinced that there is good in the great. There is research. There are those who really experiment and bring great artistic value to the podium. Obviously, it is a place full of competitiveness, full of people who just want to make money and enjoy a couple of glasses of momentary happiness amidst gambling and absurdity.
00:31:12.622 - 00:31:54.090, Speaker A: There are always those who proudly carry their name as an artist and study their critical and artistic thought day and night in this Internet sea between blockchains and jpegs. I think and imagine many positive thoughts among the tired repetitiveness. All to say, I think what Dan is saying here and the point he's making is there's something significant that's going on in this scene and that there is good in the great. There is research and true experimentation, which is how you build artistic value. Right. It's actually doing real experiments, and that's what we're doing here. I wouldn't do this show if it was all kind of.
00:31:54.090 - 00:32:16.122, Speaker A: If I didn't feel that way. So great comment there from Dan control. Totally agree. Robnis v three. Very provocative and interesting comment. To truly tell if an artist can go the distance, ask them to do something different than their normal style. If it's pretty, not so good work, then they're stuck in that style forever and will be cursed to stay in that box out of safety.
00:32:16.122 - 00:32:39.462, Speaker A: So what's interesting about this, as you know, Richard Prince says, who does different styles? You know, the art world wants to put you in a box. You're the guy that does that. You know, a one line kind of box. You're the guy that does screenshots and forget it. We don't want to hear another, you know, that is what you do. And if you start doing other stuff, then all of a sudden that can work against you. Here, Robnis V three is saying actually the opposite.
00:32:39.462 - 00:33:03.974, Speaker A: If you can't do anything other than your regular style, well, maybe, you know, maybe you're not as great. You know, maybe it's not as great as we thought. So just an interesting provocation from Robnis v three pixelord scanning the culture here. So for now, this space is more shifted to memes and casino type, which is fine. Also, the code is art. A token can be art. A community is fun.
00:33:03.974 - 00:33:36.076, Speaker A: Everyone can be a meme and an artist. So it's not a one of one or gallery type of stuff anymore. Interesting saying the market has moved on from the art into kind of more meme coins, which does sound. It rings true to a certain degree, but, you know, people are still buying, there are still collectors, there are still a ton of artists, so many that I can't even, you know, without risking crashing my computer, put them all on this show. It's also not web3 anymore. These are, this is. These are all old terms.
00:33:36.076 - 00:33:55.792, Speaker A: We're shifting to something new. Interesting speculation here from Pixel Lord. I wonder if this is true. Like, it does kind of ring true a little bit. And interestingly so. Now, how to earn any y or knee. This is Santiago.
00:33:55.792 - 00:34:21.578, Speaker A: And here, look how cool this is. This almost looks like a physical, but it's probably AI, not even sure. So here, there is this website. It links to this website, how to earn knee, which I think is Santiago's token. Become a knee holder by completing as many of the actions below. Once complete, will receive your rewards on the next reward state. So you can hold a NFT on base for 500 Ni a week.
00:34:21.578 - 00:34:38.476, Speaker A: You can hold an NFT on optimism for 200 Ni a week. You can hold an NFT on Zora for 100, and lens collect posts for 50. So interest. And look at all this. And then firecaster. So. So we've been discussing this idea of artists releasing their own tokens.
00:34:38.476 - 00:34:59.494, Speaker A: They're doing it. And to pixel Lord's point, it almost is a little bit of a fusion of the art and the meme, kind of, you know, metas, for lack of a better term. So interesting there. And gogolitis. Gogo token. So people releasing their own tokens. It's going to be interesting to watch this on Polygon.
00:34:59.494 - 00:35:42.986, Speaker A: Max supply 10 billion, is that right? 10 billion powered by pools. So I think using the same website or protocol, Gogo tokens are airdropped every Friday to eligible wallets. And here's the same thing. So I assume pools is saying if you hold the NFTs, it's probably their system. So we'll have to check this out at some point here. It could be interesting in the future, to qualify for a weekly Gogo airdrop, you can take various actions, such as holding one or many of my artworks on Tezos or ETH, following me on Warpcast, or by holding one or multiple gogomoji. Holding a gogo moji will be rewarded 200 gogo per week.
00:35:42.986 - 00:36:56.424, Speaker A: So, and this is a project, actually, that gogolite is starting. I'll just open the link there. In the future, there will be an allowance, and eligible wallets will have the opportunity to tip other individuals with their Gogo tokens, similar to what is possible with Degen on Warpcast. So now, the way I envision the whole token thing, that artists put out their own token is what if the only way to buy a gogomoji is to use Gogo's currency? That is how I imagine it, rather than the staking model. Because at least with, if you buy the crypto, where you have to use the crypto to buy the work, I would argue you get a direct value proposition between the value of the work and the crypto. Right? So this whole staking thing, it's more just meme, I would argue, as long as there's no functionality, you know, it's back to the utility thing. It's meme, you know, which I think we could, you know, say is the opposite, or the which we can distinguish from utility, right? So I'm always saying, hey, why not give it utility? But who knows? I mean, let's see.
00:36:56.424 - 00:37:19.890, Speaker A: Kind of curious to see how it all works out. Here's the Gogomoji by gogolitis on bass. It's probably really smart to put works on bass right now. There seems to be a good audience for it and everything. Five days, 6 hours and 50 minutes. So you can check that out. So gogolitis is going to put out 500 different hilarious pfps here.
00:37:19.890 - 00:37:51.950, Speaker A: So pretty fun and cool and all sorts of questions here. So golight has a website. How cool is that? More financialization. Super rare, rare, tippy and live now you can now tip an artwork, a curatorial musing, or a collector with rare and reply to Cas on Farcaster XYZ, which. Which is the protocol that I think warpcast is on. Bringing the art market chain on chain, one mint, one cast, one tip at a time. I mean, this is my concern, is that this isn't happening.
00:37:51.950 - 00:38:51.264, Speaker A: I don't see, first of all, how many people do you know outside of crypto that use metamask and that are willing to learn how to use metamask, right? Like, there's just, like the whole. There's just a bit of a learning curve or a tezos wallet, a kukai wallet, or whatever the other ones are. So this is my concern, actually, and why I kind of opened there a little bit with the, you know, as far as bringing on the art market or just people who are interested in art, which is actually more my concern. I'm not sure if that's going to help in the tippy. I do have another concern, which, since this is my journal, I will share. First of all, super happy that people tip and everything. It's great, you know, but I've made a personal decision, at least for now, and I'm open minded, and I'm open to hear what other people have to say.
00:38:51.264 - 00:39:15.750, Speaker A: To not participate, though, in that tipping. Because I was thinking, this is like going out for coffee. You say something interesting, and then I say, that was really interesting. Here's $4. Here's $4 for you. That was fantastic. I mean, what would you think of that? I was talking to Dan control.
00:39:15.750 - 00:39:39.458, Speaker A: I was bouncing the ideas off at poor dan control. I'm like, is this the financialization of communication? Like, I mean, that's kind of how it feels to me. And there is a sense of, like. And I. Again, and I'm open minded and in a sense, no judgment, because I think people are just kind of trying out new things and experimenting, having fun. And why not? I mean, you're getting free things. Here's some money.
00:39:39.458 - 00:40:06.674, Speaker A: Cool, free money. And let's give it. And you have to give it. It's kind of a cool idea. On the other hand, though, it does kind of worry me. This kind of, like, know, there's a sense to boil it all down. Is nothing sacred? Right? Am I going to start financializing my communication and start doing this back and forth and then say, oh, but you should listen to Socrates and Plato this and Socrates that.
00:40:06.674 - 00:40:42.278, Speaker A: Would Socrates ever, you know, like, I mean, so all to say now, I wonder, to parse it out a bit, is it a little bit different with artwork? And that's what super Rare is suggesting. This isn't like, hey, Gm. And then, okay, here's $4 for your GM. Good morning. Here. It's like, hey, if you put out an artwork, here's a way of kind of showing recognition that you like it, financially rewarding. So I wonder, putting out an artwork, putting out a creative thing, maybe that's a different story than just basic communication.
00:40:42.278 - 00:41:50.846, Speaker A: Right. So there is some parsing out and subtleties to be done. All to say, rare kind of, you know, rare's continuing to make, what I'd argue, continue to make a bit of a comeback here and continuing to try and grow after seeming to kind of be somewhat quiet, let's say, during the first year of this program. Strange thing, does the implicit pressure to engage with social media daily dilute an artist's passion and originality, turning inspiration into obligation? I think many people would relate to this idea. You know, at what point? I think there is a sense, especially in the digital art scene, especially the crypto digital art scene, that you do put it this way, if you don't have an account on X or Warpcast or you're pretty much out of the game, are you going to sell anything? Right? I mean, so you do have to post now sharing work. I don't think. I think, put it this way, my philosophy with social media, and it may not be a practical one, is I come to it on my own terms.
00:41:50.846 - 00:42:48.106, Speaker A: So if I only have an hour a day or half an hour a day to deal with it, then that's what I do. And I do the most I can within that, and then I go home and I try not to let it control me, because I think the. What strange thing is pointing out is if you let it control you, you could feel like you have to keep doing this and that you become a slave to these social media. Right? So. And there is, you know, GM's on the hamster wheel here, the artist here in this awesome kind of renaissance like AI artwork by strange thing, illustrating the point quite beautifully and economically and efficiently. Just a big shout out and congratulations to Klaus, who has made composition 200 of this series here, let's see what Klaus has to say as we celebrate. It definitely wasn't part of my plan to have reached this point in the composition series, as the original plan was only to create a mini series of ten or so works.
00:42:48.106 - 00:43:24.006, Speaker A: But thanks to all of you, dear collectors, for adding fuel to the fire and keeping things evolving and moving forward. Special edition of 200 for point one tazos and a beautiful work here by Klaus. So big congratulations. I've done a 200 work series, as many of you know, of the peloponnesian war, and it's a huge amount of work. And so, anyways, big congratulations to Klaus. Here's Ed Marolla on pixel art, Skeleton Valley Pixel 2024. So, referring to this work here, interestingly, and let's just open this to make it large, compression will kill this one.
00:43:24.006 - 00:43:50.220, Speaker A: So I'll zoom in for you in this thread. Pixel impressionism on a 2000 by 2000 pixel canvas. Is it pixel art? I believe so. Why? Because pixels are discreet. In other words, I would say the pixels are viewable as discrete, although we don't see it here, but this is the compressed version. What does discrete pixels mean? Anyway? More info here. Zooming in, you can see that all pixels are relevant.
00:43:50.220 - 00:44:15.144, Speaker A: Yes. So here. I kind of love this definition to a certain degree. We haven't discussed definitions of pixel art for a couple of hundred shows in kind of in depth we did for a few shows. So it's interesting to reopen the issue after, say a year. It's atomic pixel structure. Maybe someone can help us understand aliasing and such, but that all pixels are relevant.
00:44:15.144 - 00:44:58.038, Speaker A: And again, this word discrete, you know, almost understandable, distinguishable, separate a thing, recognizable, you know, awareness. In my artist's head, that relevant fact is that every pixel counts, right? Every pixel is significant. We might say. We go zooming out and sense how big 2000 by 2000 pixels is when working with discrete pixels. How do I do? So how do I do this? If you see my videos on YouTube, you know, I use a lot of brushes on aspirite. What you might not know is that this time I drew the brushes on procreate and that brushed that into the two k canvas on aseprite. Later I added the skeletons to add size for reference.
00:44:58.038 - 00:45:19.332, Speaker A: So, interesting combination of softwares here. So just interesting to reopen this issue. And thank you, Edmarola, for actually reopening this issue. It's a very interesting question. And size seems to have something to do with it. I'll need to go back. Like, I don't even really recall exactly what we said.
00:45:19.332 - 00:45:44.722, Speaker A: We kind of went in depth on that topic. I actually used to have a definition, but I haven't said it for so long. I'm trying to remember what it is. So maybe I have to do a review there. Cream saffa, what Loki and I have been working on and I have been building quadruples my heart rate. It looks pretty rad and pretty. You know, sometimes these combinations of artists, which again, seems to be a trait of the digital art world more than you know.
00:45:44.722 - 00:46:06.654, Speaker A: It happens, of course, Warhol, basquiat. But in digital, it's a lot easier and less, you know, lower risk and way more common. Looking forward to seeing that here, zvozo. With some physicals here. So check this out. Silkscreen print, hanging wall banner, four colors on canvas, 35 by 50. Printed by Jardin.
00:46:06.654 - 00:46:33.434, Speaker A: Jardin. Et no in nombre garden in number, I think, is what that means. Worldwide shipping DME. Now, quite interesting how. I think this is actually quite brilliant how Zozo got someone else to do the screen printing, because that is half the battle, right? It's like, okay, I gotta learn how to screen print, which takes time. I gotta rent a studio. I have to do all that I got to get.
00:46:33.434 - 00:46:58.914, Speaker A: And then you get everything set up, and then it's like. And then I gotta execute. You know, screen printing is kind of like a technical art. You can hire people to screen print for you, you know, to a certain degree. You know, Warhol or, like, you look at Sol LeWitt, you just give the instructions, you know, maybe that's good enough. And look at how great it looks. And if Zozo was there laboring, does anybody care? It still is a work, you know? So look at how great it looks.
00:46:58.914 - 00:47:08.282, Speaker A: And. Yeah. And even just great video here. And so. And on this kind of, like. It's beautiful. And look at this.
00:47:08.282 - 00:47:33.714, Speaker A: Like, you have to be a really good screen print printer, I would argue, to line all this up. You see the alignment there? Like, it's pretty nice. I actually find alignment, you know, a professional will be like, alignment's easy, but it's. Getting your alignment right can be tricky. And also just getting the paint to evenly go across, etcetera. So very interesting work from Zozo. And here is the original.
00:47:33.714 - 00:47:55.878, Speaker A: A flower bean herself makes you bloom. Another beautiful title. And this one is not maximizing. Buy this NfT and get the silk screen print hanging wall banner and link to that instagram that we're just at creator earnings. And so how much was this? So there were four. So maybe it was zero. Four, Ethan.
00:47:55.878 - 00:48:07.114, Speaker A: And look, sold out. So. And also getting some. Imagine another, I guess, meme coin or tipping coin. Not sure. Very cool. And congrats to Zozo.
00:48:07.114 - 00:48:25.964, Speaker A: Very reasonable prices. Also from Zozo. Look at this. Coming soon. So I'm not exactly sure what this is, but look at this. This looks like Zozo work. Maybe that one with Nuv 1914, but it looks like more physicals, doesn't it? Now, actually, this looks like a screen.
00:48:25.964 - 00:48:52.602, Speaker A: This is a photo of a screen. Because it looks like the transform, I think. I'm not sure what's going on here, but it's tempting to think as you see the transform tool here that this is more, it kind of looks like physical, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's scanned works. Not sure what's going on there. More interesting physicals here, element li, ambiguity, infinity, scales and black box are the key topics of my recent years creations. More beautiful.
00:48:52.602 - 00:49:28.874, Speaker A: What I think is laser engraving on cardboard. You know, just great for two color works here. And look at this, even leaving this empty area here. So as I do this pixel art inferno, I am thinking, okay, maybe the easiest thing is to screen print it. Maybe the really easiest thing is to ask someone to screen print it for me. But maybe I screen print it. Or, you know, here you could do laser engraving a la, you know, element li here, inter drawings, material, cardboard papers, inkjet printing and laser engraving.
00:49:28.874 - 00:50:05.316, Speaker A: Quite brilliant. Look at this, and look at how big they are, you know, putting little ones together, just like David Hockney does, putting canvases together. And so look at that. Adding color, different mixed media, traveling through the mediums here, element li. And even a nice, you know, great setup here. Just a really, really cool artist, you know. So, yeah, this is part of a series where this is going to be in Vienna, Vin, and that is going to be April 24 to May 6.
00:50:05.316 - 00:50:24.270, Speaker A: So probably just shutting down now. So very cool work. Even showing it in the gallery. More physical work as I try and run through this show here. So here, eyes of kh kinya hanata. Of course, we recognize this is mumble boy, also known as mumble boy, if I'm not mistaken. Here.
00:50:24.270 - 00:50:42.924, Speaker A: Kind of looks exactly like a mumble boy. So working with a guitar, I made a guitar shaped piece, which made me want to make a real one. I didn't want to make the guitar, but I made the piece with an actual guitar. Here. You can see how I did it. It was kind of fun to do. It's not the best guitar as I got it used cheap, but if you are good at it, you're welcome to come and play it.
00:50:42.924 - 00:51:15.212, Speaker A: Very cool idea to, as you see here. And you get a window into the quite complicated process here and how successful it is as a physical. So very, very, very cool work here. So all sorts of interesting work happening here. Martin Bruce, the experimental painter here, showing digital and physical. So here's digital, here's physical. So quite different, but there are similarities, similar compositional structure.
00:51:15.212 - 00:51:42.524, Speaker A: How interesting. How interesting. Right, demon ego working on the latest piece of Delft Records new album release. So Demon Ego is having a fantastic year here now doing an album cover and another window into demon ego's work, doing different prints print or, you know, inkjets, probably, maybe photocopy, not sure. And on different colors of paper. Look at how great this is. So just very cool to see demon ego at work.
00:51:42.524 - 00:52:17.666, Speaker A: Very cool shot. Look at this, Santiago. Another collaboration. Santiago, my friend Helio Doro Santos and I are very glad to present you our collab that consists in a physical paint in a physical painted by his robot and a one of one NFT certificate of authenticity. Details and super long title in the comments. So it looks like Helios Santos paintbrush plotter has created, has really is making a SanTiago artwork, if I'm not mistaken here. So pretty cool.
00:52:17.666 - 00:52:49.304, Speaker A: Interesting collab, isn't it? And more interesting physical work. Here's braindead on display at Beeple Studios. And so there were actually quite a few people here and there. We saw that awesome work there by Braindead system v three down, XXL again at the Beeple studios. And here's Lorna Mills at the future fair in New York City. It was transfer, I thought, an interesting display of putting, you know, four horizontal tvs together to make a vertical. Quite interesting.
00:52:49.304 - 00:53:16.184, Speaker A: So very cool there. And as we get into the paintings, finally, like an hour into this show, I don't know what to do to make it shorter. There's also just a ton of work to get through. Here's dreams. Cool spray paint up there. This is on base on, which is but minted on Zora, if you follow me. And so, as far as I understand, interesting piece here, especially the floor.
00:53:16.184 - 00:53:37.804, Speaker A: All sorts of stuff going on. Kindred spirits at crossroads based on a preparatory study depicting the miracle of St. Paul, the blinding of Elimus by Loire Nicolas Pierre. And so this is on secondary, 381 items. And I don't know what the. So, bringing in 0.17. I think this was a free mint.
00:53:37.804 - 00:54:11.168, Speaker A: And I think. So this has been finished. I think it was meant to be a one week mint. And I think that's what happened, if I'm not mistaken. So very cool work here by Euxine. And here, interesting transparency there, isn't there? And we're seeing Euxine get looser in certain areas, like, still fairly tight, you might say, rendering here, like a traditional 18th century painting. But we're starting to see this looseness more and more in Euxine's work here.
00:54:11.168 - 00:54:39.056, Speaker A: Really interesting floor there, too, by the way. So interesting piece is ever, uh, by uxie. And here, again, more looseness here, playing with, I think, memes pigs. Three different ones. Not exactly sure what's going on here, but you see just kind of cool, kind of crypto art memory. And here's another one showing how loose Euxine is getting here. Interesting colors.
00:54:39.056 - 00:54:56.224, Speaker A: You see the colors are starting to morph slightly well here. So interesting. And, of course, I follow axin. That is a glitch on x. Targon. Cockroach. So this is, this is ratcloak.
00:54:56.224 - 00:55:14.284, Speaker A: Where is. There it is ratcloak. See, let me. So pretty interesting piece here. Kind of a very dark work from Ratcloak. Dark painting, probably. From the looks of it, I think was, Ratcloak had said before that he was using photoshop brushes.
00:55:14.284 - 00:55:32.496, Speaker A: And so this looks like one of those Photoshop brushworks. And there's the cockroach. So super dark work. This person kind of looking dead, being murdered. And then, interestingly, the hip bone, I think that's what you'd call it. There's actually another word for it. I should know that.
00:55:32.496 - 00:55:46.530, Speaker A: Interesting, kind of almost abstraction in the background there with squares. So interesting piece there. And this was posted on Instagram. I wasn't sure. I looked on object. I couldn't find it. It's probably on base interest.
00:55:46.530 - 00:56:07.708, Speaker A: I think it is. I think this is on Zora with base as a free mint. And kind of a wild work here with the heads of these people joined to a skeleton. And then the baby has a skeleton with a flesh body. So pretty dark work from our good friend Ratcloak over in Ukraine. Stay safe. Stay safe.
00:56:07.708 - 00:56:28.900, Speaker A: Gregoria Zinardi, duda elegante. This is a pretty cool painting, I thought. Nicely painted work here of a guy smoking, playing tennis. And there is Gregor, I think, a pretty young artist there with the painting. Cool shots. Very cool. So cool work.
00:56:28.900 - 00:56:54.630, Speaker A: Now, I'm not sure if we saw this before, but I did open this up. This is by Yuri J. Was posted on April 30 and just a very cool work here by Yuri J. Gorgeous color. I think we've seen it before, but I wasn't sure and I didn't want to miss it. And so all to say, just cool work, I guess, based on a movie, Zabrisky Point, which I've never seen. Here's another one by Yuri J.
00:56:54.630 - 00:57:19.684, Speaker A: Which I definitely haven't seen before. It may be older, but I haven't seen it before with a kitchen a, you know, again, a kind of an interior that we're all familiar with. This may be zoomed in. I'm not sure. Or this may be the work itself, which I think would be pretty cool. Who's not familiar with this? Hey, just very cool and then all the wires. A real great contemporary digital painting from Yuri J.
00:57:19.684 - 00:57:50.258, Speaker A: I thought this was a super interesting work by detace. The shepherd. And of course, we have the lambs, so kind of christian imagery. And the shepherd here with the hoodie, this black sky, so it looks like night, but the, you know, the scene is lit nevertheless. And then, as you see here, very carefully painted pants here and shoes, kind of looking like procreate. Excuse me. And here we see some very carefully painted sheep.
00:57:50.258 - 00:58:04.914, Speaker A: And this beautiful sky. Just a cool piece. Edition of ten for five tezos. Each two are gone. Mikey Wilson on the scene. And here's Ladelmas touching grass. I think this is the whole composition.
00:58:04.914 - 00:58:34.798, Speaker A: So another just really sharp painting here by La Delmus, created during energy house 2024. Very cool artist. You can tell that palette, the palette. And so all to say, a very interesting piece. Not sure where it was minted, but cool, cool work, cool composition. Cool title. And here's the clown with almost the pirate hook hand portico.
00:58:34.798 - 00:59:00.438, Speaker A: This is by Ed Morolla. This was just minted today. A rare work from the last day here. And just an interesting work here with all of this kind of noise that looks like very painterly, but probably got from different means. And so just beautiful, beautiful noise here. Beautiful textures. Again, like a real kind of painting.
00:59:00.438 - 00:59:28.176, Speaker A: It's like a photo of a painting where you're seeing the reflection and these beautiful, different kinds of brushes. So, Ed, using, look at how rich this is. I mean, look at that using different softwares. And it shows, I mean, this is starting to have, like, the complication, you might say, the complexity of a oil painting. This is quite remarkable. This is a digital art piece. Okay.
00:59:28.176 - 00:59:44.720, Speaker A: And pretty wild composition, I might add. Right? Like, what is, like, is this a mermaid skeleton portico. Cool title, too, for tazos. And looks like there's one left. Nice. Doctor Leemec txt. Ah, heck.
00:59:44.720 - 00:59:52.614, Speaker A: Little cakes. Kels. Great collector base there. Here's Martin Bruce. Zora. Cool title. I love Martin Bruce.
00:59:52.614 - 01:00:18.046, Speaker A: I absolutely love Martin Bruce's irrationality. For lack of better terms. His poetry is actually maybe a better way of putting it. Zora, a great title. Completely unpredictable. But there is a consistency in the work. You can tell Martin Bruce, I think most of the time without looking at the label and look at the noise.
01:00:18.046 - 01:00:45.144, Speaker A: It's like this gift noise in the background across. It's like tv noise, snow noise. And you see these glitches, you know, incredibly original work here. It is an acquired taste. It's not easy. I was slow to figure out Martin Bruce like many of my other favorite artists, cactus business is the series Zora. What a title.
01:00:45.144 - 01:01:03.964, Speaker A: I love it. Absolutely love it. Okay, let's continue here. Still available to mint for 24 days, so you have time. Speaking of experimental wild work, here's Nove 1914. Has probably put out a ton of work, but here's the. The one that I came across as I was putting the show together.
01:01:03.964 - 01:01:19.476, Speaker A: Just awesome. Look at this frame. This is all on purpose. This is all very consistent. This is all pushing your aesthetic expectations and understanding. Understanding. This is truly challenging, avant garde digital art.
01:01:19.476 - 01:01:36.612, Speaker A: Okay. As I fix the hair here. So just awesome. From NUV 1914. And then this was hilarious. So wasteman Goldman, I think, has lowered the price here. This started at 333.
01:01:36.612 - 01:02:03.684, Speaker A: And the failed artist series here, failed artist number 83. So you might, if you're into the work, you may put in an offer. And there's the failed artist over there with a pyramid and a burger and an umbrella on the failed artist's head. One of my favorite series. And almost like an Adam and Eve tree here with a fried egg hamburger. Maybe a bird's nest. Not sure.
01:02:03.684 - 01:02:30.824, Speaker A: Maybe that's lettuce and a bun and a boot made of custard. And so here's the clown. So very dark, isn't it? Very dark. And there's McDonald's on fire. You know. You know what's annoying? Apple is trying to connect to my phone without me, you know, asking it to. So I guess that's an update.
01:02:30.824 - 01:02:52.334, Speaker A: So all to say here, there's McDonald's on fire. Hilarious. The debacle depicting a very sad occasion when my summer house was burned down. It looks like the McDonald's jail is actually what that looks like, isn't it? Har 80 tazos. Very cool. Here's another one by the failed artist, number 82. Not all who wonder are lost.
01:02:52.334 - 01:03:08.986, Speaker A: And there's 82 there on the. I don't know what is that. I don't know what to call that. There is a word. It escapes me as I return from vacation here. And look at this. This is an obelisk looking thing, like an egyptian obelisk.
01:03:08.986 - 01:03:32.486, Speaker A: And there's a pyramid, which maybe is another clue. And look at how beautifully painted this is. So very interesting. Almost as if these pixels are, like, fuzzed out. Look at this. Almost like a bit of a selection tool thing going on here, perhaps? Or is it just a super textured brush? Interesting contrast going on here. Look at the tattoo.
01:03:32.486 - 01:03:56.154, Speaker A: I mean, sorry. The, uh, the cast and then the face on the cast. I mean, just all sorts of weirdness going on here. Incorporating the texture and the flat digital, uh, brush in one in the same areas of the composition. Interesting. Starting to combine that, uh, if you follow me. And then the potted plant on the guy's head, which are the upside down fries.
01:03:56.154 - 01:04:16.266, Speaker A: Kind of a cosmic work here. Not all who wander are lost. 99 tezos edition of one. And put out a couple of more mysterious works here. Digital painting from my mind from wasteman Goldminevich. Same artist here. I thought these were just interesting compositions with this weird kind of white square in the middle.
01:04:16.266 - 01:04:37.048, Speaker A: And here is another one. I thought these are just pretty original works. And here, like, I don't know if that's a slug in the fries or what. And then just this really bright green grass. Interesting, interesting work. And there's a cake. Almost looks like a surreal artwork here.
01:04:37.048 - 01:04:56.786, Speaker A: Kind of has a surreal feeling to it. Let's continue. Very cool work from wastewangled Manovich limbo gm new piece in the works coming asap. So continuing with this. I think it was, like, kind of comic looking. I think limbo was calling it death is lurk like horror pixel artwork. Nice dithering here.
01:04:56.786 - 01:05:11.610, Speaker A: Interesting. Kind of similar colors. The last one we saw a cool work from limbo here. Work in progress. And here is Santiagony. So looking kind of like a mumble boy. I thought this was mumble boy.
01:05:11.610 - 01:05:29.898, Speaker A: This is Santiago, so I don't know if they're collaborating or what. And so standard base art, Santiagony, maybe just its own. San Diego's own thing. Interesting. Kind of looks like AI, looks like a collage. Interesting work. This is sensitive content.
01:05:29.898 - 01:05:55.854, Speaker A: Five minted, 22 days to go. Here's Rinnefish. As I need to speed up here. We'll see if there's volume there usually is. Very cool. Very, very cool work from Rinny. Rinifish 95.
01:05:55.854 - 01:06:18.374, Speaker A: Mintage does really well on Zora. Here's another one. This is on object. Great audio. Again, kind of placenta, baby kind of feeling to it. Great audio. Goes for 30 seconds.
01:06:18.374 - 01:06:34.724, Speaker A: Midnight garden, 13 tezos. And selling quite a few. So the market stays resilient here. Awesomely new Zozo. So this is on Zora as well. Return to Saturn when NASA zooms into space and you find Zuozo planet. Let's see if there's audio.
01:06:34.724 - 01:07:13.900, Speaker A: There is. Look at that planet. I love this. Like, to me, this is like gallery museum work. Way more interesting, frankly, than what I see in the museums for, you know, when you go to the contemporary art museums or contemporary art shows by museum curators this actually interests me. So very cool from Zozo. Here's another one on object.
01:07:13.900 - 01:07:40.646, Speaker A: Adios. Adios. And I don't think there's any volume here. Look at that. Wild, wild textures, almost like a Dan control type, you know, gradient landscape here. And then with these wild spheres with the sun in the background, perhaps maybe that's a lake in the fading of the afternoon, you can hear the breeze saying goodbye. Very poetic edition of one.
01:07:40.646 - 01:07:54.874, Speaker A: Picked up for only twelve tezos by Ahec. I love the. Here's another edition of one. Unfortunately my wallet was empty or I would have picked this up. This was also only twelve tezos. Very subtle. You'll see the rain coming in here as the animation.
01:07:54.874 - 01:08:15.930, Speaker A: Very subtle, subtle work which makes it super cool. Again, just an incredibly original artist here. So very cool. And here's one that's on Zora, stationary light. So putting down a lot of work. One of four minted stationary light. And it is as if the very darkness of the garden were melted on your tongue.
01:08:15.930 - 01:08:35.362, Speaker A: So unfortunately this, for some reason it says one of one. And this does not maximize, but the moving GiF does maximize. Or maybe there was a video. So anyway, interesting work from Zuozo. Kind of more experimental. Let's continue. Videl Herrera, who I'm not sure if I've seen any work from before.
01:08:35.362 - 01:08:46.530, Speaker A: This is on Zora. Interesting abstract here. I think this is an abstract. I think we can call it that. A lot of different textures going on. A lot of different things going on. Just an interesting piece.
01:08:46.530 - 01:09:02.994, Speaker A: Starting bid of 0.25, Ethan. Where begins the eternity of the freedom of the self. That's on foundation, by the way. Here's Seba Sistera Sistaro GM. And look at this. I love the keyboards here as well as the phone.
01:09:02.994 - 01:09:28.244, Speaker A: Nice combination. Feels very modern. Studio here, new piece for University of Toronto magazine about AI and music. Great illustration from Seba sistero. And here is Suizoichi, a work in progress. And I thought just a pretty interesting original drawing here. As you see on the forehead, this kind of dragon, you know, monster figure.
01:09:28.244 - 01:09:44.830, Speaker A: Just again, original all the way through. Even this beautiful treatment of the sweater here. So not exactly sure how this is made, but just really original work. Here's Katarina. Create floral frame. This is on Zora 16. Minted.
01:09:44.830 - 01:09:59.398, Speaker A: Interesting piece. And this one does maximize. And so nice piece here. I wonder what format this is. Some maximize, some don't. This was minted May 3, 16, minted. And this was really cool too.
01:09:59.398 - 01:10:20.696, Speaker A: Object paint 98. We're going to talk about that with tornado Rodriguez today, among other things. But I do want to ask her about her experience with object 98, which is kind of a take on Microsoft paint. Nice piece. Again, that pixel art stuff. Something feels very, just inherently valuable for some reason, to me. Edition of ten for one tezos.
01:10:20.696 - 01:10:35.144, Speaker A: Here's element ly. A little more from element ly. So just some raw digital artworks. Terrain 256 by 256. Again, this is probably like a four, maybe less. This could be like a three kilobyte file. You invent this on bitcoin for pretty reasonable amounts.
01:10:35.144 - 01:10:55.494, Speaker A: Drawing by the light, also the same size. So cool work here from element li. A lot of experimentation. Here's braindead. And cool kinda illustration of the mind here. Kind of this scribbling and then the profile put out around it. I thought just an interesting piece here.
01:10:55.494 - 01:11:13.766, Speaker A: Very cool. Did pretty well online. Stairs braindead gif. So here. And just another cool, beautifully colored work. Love that kind of blue gray, that colored gray as the background. Very recognizable as braindead.
01:11:13.766 - 01:11:32.018, Speaker A: Edition of one for 35 tazos on object. And here's another cool work. Edition of one selling for only 420. And here is the chairs with one chair missing. Very nice piece. And then here is the accompanying piece, that chair. Edition of one.
01:11:32.018 - 01:11:57.414, Speaker A: And that also went for four tezos 20. Interesting use, because it's probably just the chair repeated right in the other piece there, but it makes it look like it's a lot more work. Interestingly. Maybe that's why it was so reasonably priced. Cream saf at pattern cycling is out now. Five pieces, 15 editions, 15 tEz. So interesting kind of take on a different kind of cycling, we might say here, pattern cycling.
01:11:57.414 - 01:12:31.986, Speaker A: Not color cycling, but pattern cycling is a collection of animation studies featuring illusory, simple shapes created by time phasing, custom dithering patterns with varying pixel densities. So just interesting experimentation going on here. And as you see here, each piece is constructed by creating a simple pattern and shifting the timelines of the animations for each surface to create the illusion of 3d forms. And I am going to have to speed up here. So the color cycling technique inspired this series, prompting me to adopt half of its name for the title. Exactly like playing with cycling here, but rather than colors using patterns. Very cool.
01:12:31.986 - 01:13:01.330, Speaker A: And here it is on object. So as you see, 15 tezos, each still available except for the first one here is gogolitis 285 editions for a Tezo 70. Just a beautiful work here. Speaking of phasing colors here, or recycling colors. Handcrafted pixel art with aspirite. So kind of an abstract work here is Sabato, of course, with the. I think it was a cezanne after cezanne.
01:13:01.330 - 01:13:16.894, Speaker A: Still life with speculative fruits. Great title. Created in deluxe paint, four on an emulated amiga. 72 were minted there. So nice return for Sabato here. And here are the grapes, pineapples and everything. An interesting knife.
01:13:16.894 - 01:13:36.994, Speaker A: So cool work there. Here's popple traveling AFK. I wonder where AFK is. It is not Berlin, I don't think. And I'm not sure what that says, but very cool. Just another super interesting, immediately recognizable popple work. Doing very well online there.
01:13:36.994 - 01:13:54.214, Speaker A: Very cool work. Here's Kristen Rus vertices. This is on base. So new work, part of a series. And again now, is this on foundation? Maybe this is on foundation using base. So Coinbase is L2. Ethereum L2.
01:13:54.214 - 01:14:11.150, Speaker A: For those that can follow that, here's the. Let's just look at the series here quickly. Okay, so here are the different works in the series. Last sold for two eth. So interesting. Like, what that tells me is base. You can sell works for a lot of money on base.
01:14:11.150 - 01:14:56.254, Speaker A: That's $600. Right? Like, which is interesting. I mean, they were quite smart to get X copy at the beginning to mint the work because obviously, or I assume they asked Xcopy to do it because then people think, oh, that's an art chain, I can spend money on it, and it's not gonna be, you know, it's gonna be worth it, because some chains, like Polygon, never really got that sense that you can spend $700 on a Polygon work, you know? And if anybody disagrees, I'm totally cool with that. Elna Frederick. Love the disk drive or the three and a half inch floppy disk. Cool version of this flashing series. Elna's style there.
01:14:56.254 - 01:15:20.254, Speaker A: Doctor version, galvanic epoxy, I think, is what this is called. So I believe a new work, May 6 edition of 33 for two tezos each. And that is on object. Cool work there. Klaus composition, 199. So nice piece here. Very treated, very textured, very rich edition of one for 21 tezos.
01:15:20.254 - 01:15:46.456, Speaker A: So 20 times 20. Is it only 400 tezos? No, 20 times 204,000 tezos. About if Klaus has sold all the works, and there's probably still some available, but, you know, bringing in real cash here. So impressive. Here's Kuro. I brought a few kuros. So Kuro dives into Nintendo glitch roms with adding his own style here and flair.
01:15:46.456 - 01:16:02.844, Speaker A: Different glitches, or what looks like video treatment of glitches. Very cool work here. 0.016 I believe that's on bass. So it is the blockchain of the moment base here. Grenada. Here's another one.
01:16:02.844 - 01:16:22.784, Speaker A: So very nice. Interesting. Look at this great video glitch at the bottom here. This kind of noise. Beautiful combo of the Nintendo raw glitch with the video glitching. Atomic runner. Here's another one.
01:16:22.784 - 01:16:43.622, Speaker A: So just very nice. Rich work here. There's quite a few. So I'm kind of going fast here as we run through this show. But just beautiful work, isn't it? So nice take on that whole idea. Here's one more super Monaco. So you see a race car game.
01:16:43.622 - 01:17:04.674, Speaker A: Just completely fragmented. It's beautiful, isn't it? This, you know, this analog painting is what I want to call that. Okay. And here's Eswa. So just more so, just very cool. Beautiful work. Also, spy versus spy, of course I remember spy versus spy.
01:17:04.674 - 01:17:20.026, Speaker A: Shout out to mom if you are still watching. Yeah, if you made it this far, mom, big shout out. Of course we know. Spy versus spy, a classic on the apple iie. So beautiful work from Kiro. Here's Silva san two's magic pyramid. So just keeping it raw.
01:17:20.026 - 01:17:31.932, Speaker A: Nintendo glitch, we might say. So very cool. Orcure. Love the title and concept. Here's another one from Silva Santu's open edition. Look how great this looks. Very minimal.
01:17:31.932 - 01:17:44.364, Speaker A: Kind of just taking a nice frame and glitching it out. Love it. Edition of two. And here's one more. City night. Huge pixels here. So very, very cool work.
01:17:44.364 - 01:18:35.054, Speaker A: And here is Elie Lowe with a new work. This is. I tell you, the video art from this scene is, like, my favorite video art, like, period. I didn't even like video art, really, before this scene, it was the Kurt Hussle collective that got me. Now I'm all, I love video art, you know, ex mortal requiem. Quite beautiful. I like the contrasting background here with the flower.
01:18:35.054 - 01:18:54.620, Speaker A: So just kind of nice relationship between the flower and the background. Here is Sarah Kretschmer, local artist here in Berlin Lucent. So more experiments, I think, with AI and different exporting. Interesting. Look at this. Interesting textures here. Kind of looks like AI painting.
01:18:54.620 - 01:19:37.906, Speaker A: I mean, it's incredible, the resolution you can get on this is clearly AI. Right, so pretty interesting. 12,000 by 12,005 tezos. And here was a super cool series by what used to be graphica. And I don't know what the making jpegs is, maybe. Is it Syriza Galkin? I think this used to be, if I'm not mistaken, graphica definitely has graphica written all over it, doesn't it? If not my mistake, but I'm pretty sure it is very cool, isn't it? So cool series that was released. Here's another one collection by making jpegs, because I think Graphica retired their graphica name goes live tomorrow on verseworks.
01:19:37.906 - 01:19:57.094, Speaker A: So I imagine this did quite well. Very cool. Kind of like a pepe there. Cool AI artwork. And here is Santiago again. And here, raw AI looks pretty cool, doesn't it? I mean, pretty impressive for raw AI. So more cool.
01:19:57.094 - 01:20:20.648, Speaker A: This is not an industry. And he comes up, apparently Santiago comes up with the titles himself, has put out a book of poetry, which maybe explains something. Here's Pablo Radice. True face perception precedes reality. So more cool AI artwork here from Pablo, who makes his own algorithms. Here's strange thing doing shoes. Look at how cool that is.
01:20:20.648 - 01:20:40.676, Speaker A: Or is that. Are those socks? Shoes? Wild, wild fashion artworks from strange thing here. Just very interesting, isn't it? Look at these socks. You could totally imagine these socks up here. I'm sure they actually do exist. They're strange thing. So maybe we'll own.
01:20:40.676 - 01:20:53.524, Speaker A: We'll open his own fashion line at some point here, as we see the signature. Super interesting work they're doing. 1640 likes. Incredible. 2000 likes. Wow. Two weeks ago.
01:20:53.524 - 01:21:09.930, Speaker A: So they had toys in the Renaissance period, too, I don't think. I may have shown this in the last show, but I may not have. And it's like your Jesus action figure, but with a phone. Quite hilarious, isn't it? And brilliant AI artwork. As we go into the physicals. Look at this brilliant work by nugget brain. Now, it's interesting.
01:21:09.930 - 01:21:31.404, Speaker A: I was looking for a version. I almost wanted to start with this, but I couldn't find a full screen, and instagram makes it really hard to get the image. And so I did a search. So look at how beautiful this is. First of all, just a great artwork by nuggetbrain. But I did a search, and I guess it's based on a previous artwork, and I'll show you. Look at that.
01:21:31.404 - 01:21:54.124, Speaker A: Just an awesome artist. I did a search, and this is what actually Google gave me was this work here. So you can see it's actually the same work or, like, a similar composition. And actually, yeah, so the tab is lost here, but it's a very. It's like, almost identical composition. You'll see the red and the brown binder. So I guess, yeah, I guess working as a kind of homage.
01:21:54.124 - 01:22:13.084, Speaker A: Jordan Ferguson, new painting. Look at this. With these digital brushes here. Or digital outlines. Beautiful work, isn't it? New painting, acrylic on canvas. Just super interesting and original. Larissa roselect.
01:22:13.084 - 01:22:32.062, Speaker A: So maybe a german title here. Oil pastel on paper. Kind of a heartwarming work. Nice texture. Nice, interesting composition. Great subject matter. Feels very contemporary, doesn't it? Continuing on, here's Bobichik Matia B man.
01:22:32.062 - 01:22:42.874, Speaker A: So some new works here, I think. Acrylic and oil on canvas. And of course, the he man and skeletor paintings. Continue. And here's another one. Kong, 2023. Permanent museum collection.
01:22:42.874 - 01:23:02.378, Speaker A: So interesting piece. Here's Michael PI Bus, the Midas Touch, 2024. There we see Pikachu again appearing in these paintings. I think we saw RJ working on some. So just interesting piece here. Leaving part of it unfinished or unpainted, I should say. Here's moto 583.
01:23:02.378 - 01:23:18.324, Speaker A: A beautiful painting. Not too big, interestingly for these. Just great works. Not sure what the title is here. Looks like it may be in Japanese, if I'm not mistaken. And here's another one, moto 583. So very cool works.
01:23:18.324 - 01:23:33.924, Speaker A: Wouldn't you just love to have that? I actually love the size. From a collector point of view. I could put that in my home very easily. Right? Like it's somewhere you could put so many places. Bay, Anastasia. So there is an opening. Not exactly sure where.
01:23:33.924 - 01:23:57.814, Speaker A: So just interesting artists here. We've looked at them before. This is super cool. So, Steven Schwarzer, check this out. This is Rizzo printing, which is kind of like sometimes thought of as the poor person's screen printing. See that color photocopying, very, very, very interesting. Again, traveling through the mediums.
01:23:57.814 - 01:24:16.964, Speaker A: Incredibly powerful. Adding pixels. I mean, Steven Schwarzer, I haven't seen add pixels before. Rezo. Just very interesting across the board, 39 by 30. So maybe putting different. Because Rizzo, you're sort of usually limited to about a three, maybe a three plus.
01:24:16.964 - 01:24:33.240, Speaker A: So not exactly sure how. 39 by 30, maybe centimeters, not sure. Lagos. This is by Abel Berger. A very cool painting here. As you can see, we've looked at their work before. Very cool artist.
01:24:33.240 - 01:24:48.804, Speaker A: Just beautiful, consistent, you know, because sometimes you get tempted, you see one of these, you think, oh, that's a one off. Could they do it again? This person can do it again. Someplace nice. The work of Nieman. Annette. I thought this was hilarious and very cool. So more interesting.
01:24:48.804 - 01:25:05.360, Speaker A: Beautiful color. And here's Mister McGrath, whose work I think we've seen before. Kind of mystical looking work. Here's. It's not gallery gao hang. It's not gallery wild outlines on the face here. Once you see it you go oh sure.
01:25:05.360 - 01:25:56.716, Speaker A: But I mean that is some wild decision making. Again, more airbrush painting which I think they're known for recalling the machine interview where she said she got inspired by seeing it's not gallery interestingly and all their airbrush works if I remember correctly, health issues, bondozo Bandido. Again, kind of airbrush artists here, quite a beautiful diptych, nice texture here. Super interesting artist as you know if you watch this show, a huge fan of their work. Here's some more kind of working with a screenshot, a windows screenshot, let's say. Just awesome, totally awesome here, purper trap phone, bundles of bandito. So here interesting cell phone Nakia and that is your show, my friends at an hour 25 at least it's not more than an hour and a half.
01:25:56.716 - 01:26:09.684, Speaker A: Next time will be shorter. Thank you for joining me. Until next time, take care. See you at Tornado Rodriguez.
