00:00:03.040 - 00:00:26.834, Speaker A: It feels like a perfect beginning of the week, maybe. Except the hair. The hair. You know, I risk public humiliation every time I come on here. And at a certain point, you just gotta not care and you just show up and do your thing. So we are back, my friends, to begin a new week with triumphant music. What would we do without this music, you know? Tradscape is back on the scene.
00:00:26.834 - 00:00:52.950, Speaker A: Artist journal, February 12, 2024. Broadcasting from the coffee shop of the mind, where I am freshly from making art after the gym. A beautiful beginning to the week here, so. And now we're hanging out, so I'm thrilled about that, too. So again, welcome back. And we're going to hear from tradscape. If I lined up my tabs correctly here, I tried a new format.
00:00:52.950 - 00:01:34.846, Speaker A: In terms of my schedule, I am constantly tinkering with my schedule, which was, I never actually prepared the tabs the night before. And so just to, you know, do 80% of the work, and then you just fill in the gaps. Woke up at six, I was like, I could have recorded this thing at eight in the morning. Sometimes I don't record till noon, so isn't that interesting? So sometimes later. So all to say, there's something to be said for tinkering with the schedule. And it kind of brings us to this beautiful, gorgeous, wonderful work of art here by Klaus, which is the longer you do something, you know you can be. Here's Klaus at, I think, number 126.
00:01:34.846 - 00:02:08.198, Speaker A: All of a sudden, just continuing to do work that you didn't think was basically possible, or do you think, you know, to continue to push forward, right. And you keep on hitting new ground and to a certain degree, here's this show, I think, episode 297. And it's like, oh, maybe I should do a little bit of preparation the night before. You know, just getting these tabs worked out. So all to say a wonderful beginning to the week and to try new things and to tinkering. And here we are with Klaus. Let's look at what number this is, this composition, number 126.
00:02:08.198 - 00:02:26.548, Speaker A: And I think we're actually at. What are we at here? I'm concerned. I haven't gone through the tabs since coming back from the gym, but we're just gonna go for it and see what shows up here. So, yeah, we're at 127. A beautiful work here. And I'm wondering, what is this? Instagram. Okay, we're good.
00:02:26.548 - 00:02:49.978, Speaker A: You're temporarily blocked. It looks like you're misusing this feature by going too fast. That is exactly what I'm doing here. I am going very fast, Instagram. So we'll come back to that. So here Klaus is at number 127. And if we go back, I bet this isn't even that long ago.
00:02:49.978 - 00:03:03.854, Speaker A: Like, this could. Let's see when this composition series started. December 18. So we're 120 in. Or that's composition number six. But it looks like that's where things really get going. Here's composition number one.
00:03:03.854 - 00:03:22.200, Speaker A: Let's see here. December 14. So we're at February 12, almost Valentine's Day there. We're at February 12. And. Yeah, so it's been two months. And Klaus has put out 100 of these.
00:03:22.200 - 00:03:55.634, Speaker A: And some of them, they were starting at ten tezos. But let's just say he puts out another hundred at 20 tezos. I mean, he's bringing in some actual pretty good. If you're bringing in like 1000 tezos a month. A thousand, basically dollars a month, you know, that pays for rent for a lot of people and then some, depending on where you live, of course. So very interesting. They're not sure what's up with Instagram here, but we do have this, you know, Klaus posting this on Instagram, a little window into Klaus's process and studio here.
00:03:55.634 - 00:04:10.350, Speaker A: And here it is. We see all of the wires. Hilariously. Look at all this gear. I've never received that message from Instagram before. Who knows why? You know, I have a few Instagram tabs open. Let's.
00:04:10.350 - 00:04:26.246, Speaker A: Quite a few. Maybe that's the problem. Maybe that is the problem. But here, again, a window with this beautiful, cool vertical screen. Interestingly, because a lot of these works we think of as horizontal. Interestingly. And what a gorgeous work this is.
00:04:26.246 - 00:05:00.464, Speaker A: You know, minimal in color, nice texture. I've kind of seen this kind of like, you know, vertical line here, but it looks like it's repeated a few times. A little bit of delay in feedback here. And so quite interesting. There's almost a kind of, in this piece, a kind of minimal minimalism, which is kind of boiling down the project to a certain degree to simple elements and I think, to great effect here. And then again, it's kind of like I always think of Kandinsky here. I think it's partly the title.
00:05:00.464 - 00:05:17.846, Speaker A: And let me make sure. Okay, we are recording here. I think it's partly the title, but it's also just the. You could make a million different variations here. And it's. Of course, it's compositions. They're abstract compositions here.
00:05:17.846 - 00:06:01.274, Speaker A: And just experiments to see what different colors and shapes, of course, here using, again, analog video glitch process here. And look at this. And now I'm almost visualizing this as vertical on close's original screen, perhaps. And look at these great lines here that go perpendicular, dragged up. So again, just a very interesting series. And there's something to be said, and I've mentioned it before, to the credibility that comes with numbers. Imagine Klaus is at 1000, bringing in maybe 20,000 tezos at that point, maybe more, which is kind of like a.
00:06:01.274 - 00:06:26.286, Speaker A: What is that? It's not quite middle class, but you're getting that. You're over the poverty line, let's put it that way. Which is not bad for probably supplemental income, right? Maybe it pays for, like, some upgrades to the studio. Not that Klaus needs any. So there is a credibility. Because imagine if I can minimize this. Imagine if we were at composition number three and it all stopped.
00:06:26.286 - 00:07:13.484, Speaker A: Or composition number ten, and it all stopped at composition 126, you start going, like, again, I start to go, oh, why? You know, it seems like if this was in a museum and you're seeing composition 126, it starts to feel like there's the credibility of. This could be in a museum just by virtue of the numbers. And one could argue the consistent output. That also helps. But if you have a consistent output, you have cool titles here, and you're at, you know, 200 in. Again, credibility comes with numbers. It's kind of almost back to that prolificness debate that ultimately, I think we landed on looking at Warhol and Picasso, that ultimately, prolificness builds credibility.
00:07:13.484 - 00:07:38.446, Speaker A: And credibility, ultimately, is where the value lies. Right? So as we see with Picasso and Warhol, massive outputs. But it's not really hurting. You know, when you see these Picassos go to auction for tens of millions of dollars for a 20th century painter, it's not really hurting the value. So. So, yeah, hopefully. I have a feeling that little pop ups gonna haunt us.
00:07:38.446 - 00:07:55.906, Speaker A: Instagram's gonna haunt us over this episode. There's nothing we can do. This is a one take show, and we are living for the moment here and doing all we can. So, Klaus, looking good. There's another one that was released here. Just released. This is number 127 and still available.
00:07:55.906 - 00:08:11.066, Speaker A: The other one sold pretty quickly, I think. Doctor version. Picking that up after an hour. Yeah, doctor version, liking it, too. There's something very poetic in the colors. And this also comes back to. It's not just the output.
00:08:11.066 - 00:08:59.574, Speaker A: It's not just the numbers. It's also the more you make, the more we've discussed this before, the more you're going to stumble upon great works. Right. The more you're going to make great work. Like, it's just, you know, it brings me back to Brian Tracy, the great, you know, what I, who I call the original life coach, you know, and life coaching at the end, how to act. You know, it's a pretty useful thing that they don't really teach in school. If you ever wonder that to yourself as a teenager, I totally wondered, how are you supposed to act? So I don't want to get off course here, but as Brian Tracy said in one of his later lectures, maybe from the mid two thousands to late two thousands, here's someone who spent his life wondering how to be successful.
00:08:59.574 - 00:09:46.892, Speaker A: How do you be successful? And what was really interesting was when he was, I assume he was in his late sixties, early seventies at that point. He's still alive, by the way, still putting out content, as one would expect from who I call the original life coach. But one of the insights that he had there, after a lifetime of trying to figure out success, is the conclusion he came to is it's largely statistical. The more things you try, the more successes you're gonna have. So that, you know, and that really resonated with me. That really stuck with me. Cause I see it totally as true in the arts and in visual art and as an artist, the more things you make, the more you're gonna stumble across making great works, the more great works you're gonna make.
00:09:46.892 - 00:10:14.438, Speaker A: It's statistical, one could argue. Not to mention you're getting better at stuff along the way. So your stats are probably, you know, your averages of, you're probably gonna get a more, a higher ratio of successful works as you get better. So it's kind of a positive feedback loop there. So again, and then we see this really original piece here, you know, trying something a little different. Right. Again, very interesting.
00:10:14.438 - 00:10:41.198, Speaker A: Keeping it interesting. And here's composition number 125. Almost, I want to say a hat tip to mumble boy here. It almost has a touch of mumble boy in it, but I'm sure just random here, but almost those similar colors we know and love here and here. Just another really cool work here. And that's the thing with this style. You theoretically could sample from anywhere, couldn't you? And then remix to the point of things.
00:10:41.198 - 00:11:11.118, Speaker A: Like, I sometimes wonder that to myself or I did a lot, you know, as a, you know, as I, when I dabbled with music in my twenties. It's like just remix something to the point where it's not even recognizable anymore. At what point does it just become your thing? Right. And it's an interesting question. I start with a lot of appropriated or sampled works oftentimes. So all to say, let's continue. And I follow, of course, the great Ezra Eslin.
00:11:11.118 - 00:11:37.860, Speaker A: That is an x glitch. The way to people's hearts is through nostalgia and melancholy. Actually, before we do that, forgive me folks, I should have went through all of this stuff beforehand. Let's see if we have any comments here. And we're also going to visit the X. And look, we have a ton of comments here from last episode. And thank you for the big support on that one.
00:11:37.860 - 00:11:53.956, Speaker A: Thank you so much for. We have score. Saiko, thank you so much for reviewing my kirakira print. That beautiful physical work. Yes, Kirakira is shine. It's even with Kirakira filter with the app, it almost looked like augmented reality there. Almost like designed for a vision pro.
00:11:53.956 - 00:12:14.148, Speaker A: I love this long episode full of wonderful arts. Awesome to hear score. Thank you. You know, we discussed that on the spaces at the start last time where I was like, you know, I think I need to make these shorter and rune tunes. Just like, just make it whatever it needs to be. And I thought those were wise words. So we're continuing to just go with however long it needs to be.
00:12:14.148 - 00:12:29.938, Speaker A: Pipi Universal. Thanks for the future, Poco. I burned the rock forever, so PP had made a rock. I do that sometimes if I'm not convinced. And also anxiety. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, it's an interesting question and Aile actually put out a tweet saying I was looking for that work.
00:12:29.938 - 00:12:57.398, Speaker A: I wanted to pick it up. So, you know, and, you know, relating also, and I've mentioned this before about my own work. Sometimes we're the worst. We're the worst judges of our own work because we're too close to it. Not that that's happening here necessarily, but it's interesting because what we see is different senses of, you know, the. The work and artists having their own particular perspective and oftentimes the most critical. Right.
00:12:57.398 - 00:13:05.742, Speaker A: So just interesting there. Thanks for the comment. Pp Kosh. I'm a little bit late, but happy birthday. Have a wonderful time and thank you for the show. Thank you. Very nice to hear.
00:13:05.742 - 00:13:20.044, Speaker A: And thank you, Tom Bombadil. Happy birthday, runetune. Saiko Ihara's Kirakira print is so cool. I want to make physicals like that. And indeed, and score. Thank you so much. And Luciana Guerre, you're doing a great job.
00:13:20.044 - 00:13:36.260, Speaker A: You deserve a croissant. So delicious. Thank you. And also rune tune. And I'm totally down to have an early spaces talk Vietnam, Bangkok, the Mocha Art Museum, as well as Harold Cohen exhibit I just saw at the Whitney this week. Awesome. So I think I figured out how to do it.
00:13:36.260 - 00:14:27.422, Speaker A: I believe it's Calo on Wednesday, which should be awesome. I think what we do rune tune, if you're watching and I'll message you today is we create just another space, like a separate post, which is Runetoon's trip in Asia and we just schedule it an hour earlier. How about we do that? So I'll just message you to confirm and then we'll put that out. So awesome idea and I'd love to hear what you have to say about the Harold Cohen exhibit. Blue 281 thank you Eduardo. Pulitzer, Edmarola and Morlacos thank you for the comments. Now very quickly here, I just don't want to miss if we can let me just do this just very quickly here to recognize all our commenters here.
00:14:27.422 - 00:14:47.290, Speaker A: And again, thank you for the support on this. Just very quickly, doctor version violet trip skull okay, there might be quite a few here. NFT HJ Sophie Ogura w seven wojak whose work we looked at last episode. Little cakes. Yeah, great Zozo piece to start. Indeed. Just a magical piece.
00:14:47.290 - 00:15:08.352, Speaker A: And Zozo, great to hear from you. Really appreciate this. NFT FOMo thank you, Margaret Freeman and I use Margaret in quotes, the great perhaps waffles is sneaking through here. Once again, thank you for the comment. Ilya, thank you for the comments. Sergey Denise, thank you. And number one, thank you for the comments.
00:15:08.352 - 00:15:39.102, Speaker A: Let's go into everybody else's comments here. Ezra Eslin the weight of people's hearts is through nostalgia and melancholy. Just an interesting take. And I can totally relate to the nostalgia piece. Looking again, ultima four for me, I consider an early masterpiece of digital art, as I always like to say, melancholy. I think it can be definitely. I mean, we do see it.
00:15:39.102 - 00:16:27.682, Speaker A: We were talking about joy division, which is pretty melancholic. Sometimes, though, I feel like melancholy can be overly, you know, pulls the heartstrings. Put it this way, it's a I agree with this, but you have to be careful with melancholy because if you're doing it simply to pull the heartstrings, it can create a sense. Sometimes you find of this in overly sappy music where you feel like you're being manipulated, where they put the big melody, you know, like some melodic trance or progressive trance, and then it's like too much and you can tell you're just kind of being manipulated into feeling something and you're supposed to feel a certain way, so you got to be careful, I would say, with certain. With melancholy. Nostalgia is a little bit of an easier one to a certain degree, where you don't need to be as careful. I'd argue it's a Game Boy.
00:16:27.682 - 00:16:49.910, Speaker A: Cool. Let me see. I want to see your Game Boy work. Anyway, cool comment and interesting commentary from Ezra Ezlyn tradscape, the maker of the music of this show, beginning and end. Yes, I'm making a scary monkey right now. It's going to look really cool. Problem is, I'm so uninspired that I'm only, like, getting ten minutes done every day who got hints to get back in the groove.
00:16:49.910 - 00:17:06.866, Speaker A: So I can see all the weirdos in this awesome piece. So I can tell you. Weirdos, this awesome piece. You know what's interesting? I think a lot of people struggle with that. I've dealt with that. Just recently, I was trying to start. Trying to start and someone said music, and actually, totally.
00:17:06.866 - 00:17:37.951, Speaker A: And I realized my headphones, I needed new headphones. So I got new headphones, and now I'm getting way more bass, and all of a sudden, I'm back in the groove and I'm feeling the music again. I thought I was starting to not feel music anymore, but it was actually my headphones, you know, having good bass and whatever. I think the old headphones had one too many drops into, like, a glass of water or something, and so they weren't working as well. So music is not a bad way of doing it. Looking forward to seeing that strange thing. I think it's vital to take a moment to appreciate the efforts of object.com
00:17:37.951 - 00:18:00.612, Speaker A: team in democratizing art through their daily curation, of course. So they did. In fact, it was a curation on the homepage of. From the show, which was awesome. And, yeah, so that was very cool. They put out a tweet after last show, after I finished recording, but before I posted last show, so that was awesome. And they also put bosque gracias, which was really cool, too.
00:18:00.612 - 00:18:29.808, Speaker A: They're championing all artists using their platform, while others tend to spotlight the usual names consecutively. I hope they can learn from. Yeah, right. So exactly. Like, there's so much, like the whole reason one could argue this show exists at all is because there was so much talent that was, frankly, unrecognized. Right. And so, you know, and this happens in all the arts, like, to a certain degree, the arts.
00:18:29.808 - 00:18:59.104, Speaker A: Like, it's not like the talent isn't there. It's that the talent isn't really celebrated. And so I. For me, it's like a huge opportunity which kind of developed organically, this journal of sorts, but really it's featuring a whole bunch of art that is not really, for the most part. And I think that's changed over the course of this show. I think just by virtue of putting out 300 videos, people are now. And I think it would have happened anyway, but maybe not to the same degree.
00:18:59.104 - 00:19:31.084, Speaker A: Right? And so I think it's awesome. It's a huge opportunity for object. They have so much great art on their platform, and rather than just putting the top five sellers and then endlessly hammering away that these are the only five artists we need to care about, oftentimes the better art can often be found in the obscurity. In obscurity. And that's like a. One has to treat this, you know, I call this not a news show, but I do call it a newspaper of the imagination, and that has to be treated as an exclusive. Right.
00:19:31.084 - 00:19:55.654, Speaker A: So I totally agree with strange thing on this one. And I think it's cool that he's recognizing that, in a sense, in a public way. It's also great to see new artists joining lately to be able to collect from after a dry spell due to the bear and Solana hype. Plus, the new fake whale drop with many great artists is fire. So again. Yeah, so just very, very cool. Totally agree.
00:19:55.654 - 00:20:31.716, Speaker A: Ryan, who I believe is one of the developers behind tea. The current tea, the creation contract for tea is 99% done, and we're wrapping up the final tests and checks now. One thing that a lot of people don't know about our site is that the layout of the site is designed for you to share your screen in public. The cafe in Tea cafe comes from the idea that we want small coffee and tea shops to use our app to help local artists and local businesses make money together in a mutually beneficial arrangement. The cafe gets their art, the artists get their sale, the owner gets their commissions. Very interesting. I never put that together.
00:20:31.716 - 00:20:55.040, Speaker A: It's good to explain this stuff. Have to visit. Let's look at tea cafe really quickly. I think this confuses some people because most apps are designed in a way that where the screen is dedicated to a single user, ours is meant to be a shared experience. That's what the rabbit and turtle slider is for. It's going to be somewhat of a hurdle to change people's habits, but I'm hoping some will be up for it. Well, I think it helps to actually explain.
00:20:55.040 - 00:21:46.040, Speaker A: So here's tea, caffeine and I guess so. Here, maybe this is it. It's like a slideshow, right? But I guess my only comments would be is I get here and I don't know what to do and I don't know what I'm supposed to do. That would be my feedback for tea cafe. So other than to go through the slideshow and maybe get some what seems to be random so random images here or cool nfts so maybe on the homepage just some sort of explanation of what it is and how it works. Maybe just my two cent there. Ryan also, I have no regrets getting deep into tazos since I found my tribe here, but you really do feel the winters when you're involved directly in the day to day.
00:21:46.040 - 00:22:19.532, Speaker A: My ethereum investments were a lot easier to handle since all I did was Hodl and literally do nothing while waiting around and they probably went up in the meantime. Probably should have listened to Warren Buffett and let the money work for me, but this was too important for me to let go of I guess. And they're doing a really nice job there on tea. They really fixed the site for a while. It was not loading up in a great way, it would kind of crash your browser, but now it's kind of got like an infinite scroll as far as I understand, or just a smoother load up. So they actually have improved that site enormously. So it'd be interesting.
00:22:19.532 - 00:22:47.276, Speaker A: So hopefully they stick with it there but don't take it for granted. So if you have special works, maybe you mint on tea too demon ego I want to take the first step to create my own AI model. That's what I do with certain series. Like I think my AI screen memory series or screen memory remixes. I meant those on tea and I just kind of stick to a series there that I put on Teia so interesting. So yeah there's different ways of approaching it. I want to take the first step.
00:22:47.276 - 00:23:07.108, Speaker A: This is demon ego to create my own AI model. I'm in the research and amateur learning phase. Pretty interesting. I think true face makes their own AI model. Here's another. Clair Silver easiest way at current is with scenario GG. Let's see this craft unique and style consistent game assets with custom trained AI.
00:23:07.108 - 00:23:35.432, Speaker A: So very useful. Make a profile of hugging face. If you don't, you can easily dream booth a stable diffusion model with a database. So all sorts of interesting ways to make your own AI model. So very cool. Shilly Preston I thought this was interesting because I think it speaks to a feeling that many have because it's such a community. This hesitancy to sell art, because maybe this would be seen as undermining the art or something.
00:23:35.432 - 00:23:56.046, Speaker A: Shilly Preston. I'm in a really tough spot right now, as we learned recently. So I'm listing a lot of the art I've collected. I don't want anyone to think I'm upset with them if I list a bunch of their pieces. It's just where I'm at right now. And I think this is really important. You know, people, when you buy something, you should be able to do whatever you want with it.
00:23:56.046 - 00:24:48.482, Speaker A: It's different if Shilly sells it for a penny, right? Then it's kind of like, okay, maybe sending a signal of sorts. But if Shelley's selling them, even if they're below price, because Shilly needs to sell them, you know, it's perfectly like. The fact is, Shilly bought it to begin with, so I don't think anybody should feel there's kind of a shame that somehow sometimes gets associated with selling. I think it's totally fine, you know, live by the market, die by the market. And again, the market is the best thing that's happened to this scene. And, you know, like, again, like, I'd say the market is one of the, like, in a sense, I was thinking about the contemporary art market versus this market. This one's, I'd say, a lot freer in the sense that the contemporary art market is kind of more, kind of smoke and mirrors.
00:24:48.482 - 00:25:11.294, Speaker A: It's more opaque. It's not necessarily, especially the higher you go. It's not clear how much a work is, who they're going to sell it to here. It's like anybody can better buy or sell from anyone. Nobody's stopping you. The whole permissionless thing. And I think that works to the advantage, but people have to be able to sell without feeling bad about it.
00:25:11.294 - 00:25:29.514, Speaker A: Mech txt what's inside. So, doing the tez vending machine takeover, introducing 18 artworks. And it's five tiers, so a lot going on here. Take cool font there. Of course, mech vending takeover. Nice combination of fonts there. That looks.
00:25:29.514 - 00:25:56.258, Speaker A: I was gonna say no, that's not quite a trajan, but almost. So anyway, very cool here. And Mech putting some one of ones as well as some other works here. And here it is. I mean, it looks great, doesn't it? So, mech has redesigned the vending machine to Mech's style here. And it is on. So this started when? Maybe yesterday.
00:25:56.258 - 00:26:18.942, Speaker A: And already a lot of the one of ones have gone. But I think there are still some left. We'll see if this loads up here. And here we are. So here are, as you see down here, mech txT vending machine. We'll see if that loads here. Do this.
00:26:18.942 - 00:26:34.514, Speaker A: We'll start with some of these works here and we'll come back to that. So here's some of the works. And I remember this being posted on Twitter. This is a gorgeous work. Love the big chunky pixels. And very interestingly, putting some dithering inside of a pixel. Very cool.
00:26:34.514 - 00:27:07.954, Speaker A: Very, very cool. And this is the sort of stuff that happens only when you are being very prolific. Of course, mech txt putting out a ton of work, probably only had to go into the, probably had a ton of work that could be used here. And so this, I'm not sure if this is sold yet. This might still be available in the vending machine. But putting, as you see, Mec TxT vending takeover, putting like a ton of work here. Maybe, you know, maybe close to 20 works here by Mech TXT are in the vending machine.
00:27:07.954 - 00:27:25.984, Speaker A: So pretty cool. So if you're a mech TXT person or fan, check out the tez vending machine. And look, one of ones. So probably pretty good odds, better than the lottery here. And just very cool work. Here's another one. Extrapolation of suffering.
00:27:25.984 - 00:27:53.296, Speaker A: Nice kind of use a nature here. Almost like a dragged out sun here. Kind of cool and nice work here. And here's another one. This is an edition of 13 be not afraid. And here we see a headless statue with the sun behind it, working the classics theme. And let's Janice, I thought Janice is, I think the two headed dog, if I'm not mistaken here.
00:27:53.296 - 00:28:12.930, Speaker A: And there's maybe the other side here as we see the blinking eyes on the other side of this head here. Very cool work here. And I think this is a one of one as well. Nice kind of green palette here. And this is an edition of one. And yeah, I think went to the so found in the Tes vending machine. Here's another one.
00:28:12.930 - 00:28:42.000, Speaker A: Birth of ishtar. So cool. So very cool work here in the Tes vending machine, as you can see. And there is more, I just tiresias, of course, the old blind prophet from Oedipus Rex there. And I think some other stories there too, also in the metamorphoses by oak. So, yeah, so interesting take on Teresa's beautiful landscape there. And it's kind of moving.
00:28:42.000 - 00:28:54.048, Speaker A: Let's see if we can see the animation there. Maybe no animation actually, there. Yeah. Okay. The animation is here. So all to say, just a really beautiful eight frames. So.
00:28:54.048 - 00:29:07.844, Speaker A: And I love how small this canvas is. Huge fan. Huge, huge fan. Okay, into the physicals we go. Euxine continues to make huge progress here. We have to look close at this. In fact, this is looking really, really good.
00:29:07.844 - 00:29:32.070, Speaker A: Of course, I followed axe. That is an x glitch. Look at this. So what is going on here? It looks like the white. What seemingly is white on blue is actually negative space. And it looks like a one, maybe a two color, a little bit of a second color put in here, this brown and the blue. But it looks like a one pass screen print.
00:29:32.070 - 00:29:59.026, Speaker A: Look at how good this looks. And again, it's like the errors. The randomness of the error. The errors kind of create the sense of randomness here and to really great effect. And making it, again, that randomness that, you know, the randomness of physicality creates a kind of preciousness and uniqueness. You know, you couldn't recreate this exactly on another pass. It would be slightly different.
00:29:59.026 - 00:30:41.606, Speaker A: Same with the colors. So, really using, you know, if you're going to go physical, you kind of, like. My kind of approach to physical is go physical. But when you do go physical, in a way, at least, this is my own what I tell myself, I'm not telling everybody else to do this, but this is how I see it, in a way that renders the physical work necessary, in the sense that it becomes a different work and here. And that it kind of is. Put it this way in order to achieve. To achieve this work here or this work here.
00:30:41.606 - 00:31:18.446, Speaker A: This digital work kind of pixelated out here, kind of forms a pixelation, a couple of different kinds. This happy face here in this kind of tombstone, there's a digital version of this work, but you would never get these kind of things or these little errors in the physical version or all of this. You know, all of the little kind of bleeds and all of the unperfectness that you would never get in the physical. Sorry. In the digital, which, to me, renders the physical necessary, it becomes its own work of art. And in that, it becomes. It kind of.
00:31:18.446 - 00:31:55.964, Speaker A: In a weird way, it legitimizes making something physical. It's not just because, put it this way, you could print this out on inkjet, this kind of image that oxym had prepared. But basically, if you're just. That's why it almost doesn't even work, if you know what I'm saying. Oftentimes, if you take a digital work and you just do an inkjet print first. Inkjet's a little boring, but it's kind of boring, right? And then philosophically, it's not really, you could argue it's not really necessary as a work of art because it's almost better on the screen. Here you have a physical, you know, randomness has been added.
00:31:55.964 - 00:32:29.134, Speaker A: You know, other ingredients that only happen. Other elements that only happen in the physical artwork are being added here, transforming the work and rendering the work, you know, necessary, one could argue, or at least if it's not necessarily legitimizing its existence, as not just kind of, oh, let's make another copy. It's more than a copy. That is my point here. So very nice work here by Euxine. And again, you know, employing Warhol's philosophy, he could just make 100 of these. He could make 200 of these, and each one is going to be different.
00:32:29.134 - 00:33:10.656, Speaker A: And, you know, again, and legitimizing, one could say to a certain degree, each one of those individual works, them, they all become unique. So incredibly powerful, not just from a artistic point of view, but also from a market point of view. Right? Because what becomes possible then, at that point? This is very interesting here. Element li engraved on paper. So, as we see here, this looks like kind of notebook paper, but I think it was mentioned somewhere else that this is shiny paper. It looks to me like element ly is applying. I wonder if element Ly has a laser engraver, because there's a lot of experiments going on here, and it's no longer.
00:33:10.656 - 00:33:40.732, Speaker A: It doesn't look like element Li is going to the laser engraver workshop or, you know, to get this printed each time. It's. This looks like a. Like a homemade version. So I'm not sure if it is. This is what it looks like. And again, very similar situation to axine, right? It becomes a different work of art, and it becomes also about this, you know, as I always like to say here, traveling through the mediums, because all of a sudden, it.
00:33:40.732 - 00:34:29.672, Speaker A: It transforms our understanding or our visual understanding of the visual, of the pixel, of the digital, these pixels that have been rendered in this physically, you know, imperfect, you know, reality, right? So we get all sorts of little imperfections, small as they might be, and, you know, rendering them, you know, giving meaning to that image, to that physical work. Here's another one. Very interesting work here. Bark. So, you know, tree, part of a tree. And again, you see a beautiful conceptual contrast as well as visual contrast between the digital. You know, what you might be tempted to call the artificial and nature, you know, this is taking.
00:34:29.672 - 00:35:17.584, Speaker A: We've long commented on the beautiful contrast, how pixel art. We saw it with mech txt a second ago, how nature is always a great subject matter for pixel art because you have a wonderful contrast of this kind of artificial, very rectilinear forms depicting curvilinear organic forms and very natural that creates huge contrast. And we see it here, right with these pixels again rendered into this organic substance, just like literally burnt in. So very interesting work here from element Li continuing. And we will hit ok here. So here. This looked like the future of art metaversal.
00:35:17.584 - 00:35:34.082, Speaker A: Now check this out. It kind of reminded me of art matter. This is for the Lumen prize. So more now, doesn't this look like this is. There we go. See matter lab there. That is art matter, I believe so.
00:35:34.082 - 00:36:04.202, Speaker A: I wasn't sure if they were still running. I had heard that art matter actually wasn't going, but it looks like they are going, so I'm not sure. But as you see here, you see actually it totally explained here the process. And as we kind of long pointed out, it's, you get the texture first and then it's kind of printed on top, the color. So there it is. So very interesting there. And here we have a work in the studio from Martin Bruce.
00:36:04.202 - 00:36:25.264, Speaker A: Very cool to see that in action. And remember this, remember this work that we saw as a, as a digital work. So again, working, traveling through the mediums here. Martin Bruce. So this looks like the source that Martin Bruce eventually maybe changed. And here was another work by Martin Bruce. Look at this.
00:36:25.264 - 00:36:50.504, Speaker A: Wild. Looks like a work in progress, but you really don't know with Martin Bruce always experimenting here, pushing the boundaries of aesthetics here with Martin Bruce's works. Martin Bruce yeah, so just very interesting piece there. And here's a piece I missed. This is from January 28. This is reserve at 0.12. Behind the tree.
00:36:50.504 - 00:37:26.670, Speaker A: Like, I'm always kind of amazed by the originality of the compositions, the subject matter. You know, this is like incredibly original and the outrageousness to a certain degree. I mean, you have this big tree in the middle of the composition and I'd argue making it work. And this again kind of looks like mostly, if not entirely physical, but hard to say. So here. JPEG 2024 so interesting work there that came out a couple of weeks ago. And here's Luciana Guerra.
00:37:26.670 - 00:37:42.080, Speaker A: Saturday is for painting. And I follow Luciana. That is a glitch. When I load up 100 x tabs, it doesn't show the follow there. So just more beautiful work from the weekend. I believe from Lucian Aguera. And here we have.
00:37:42.080 - 00:38:13.642, Speaker A: Check this out. So it's one of those cameras, the let's glitch it cameras and taking a picture. I was kind of mentioning this at the start of the episode of, you know, you could, you know, if you transform something enough, at what point does it just become its own thing? And you almost see it right here, don't you, with the glitch camera taking a picture of an artwork, and before you know it, it starts to turn into its own thing. So just very interesting there. And here. Interesting. This is touch designer, which of course, Saiko uses.
00:38:13.642 - 00:38:44.880, Speaker A: Interesting video here. Semi group color palette, animating the building blocks with little squiggles and then adding color feedback effects, variation on my recent ASCII and icon grid exploration. So this is touch designer at work here, which I think is quite interesting. We are going to be haunted by that Instagram message. And, you know, just interesting to see what a touch designer can do here. You see all these pixels filled with things too. So just interesting.
00:38:44.880 - 00:39:08.810, Speaker A: Interesting. Psycho being a huge fan of this. And this is Polly hop is the name of the artist. Continuing on, I think Sabato retweeted this. This is an older piece, madoka in shift GIs asCIi. But I thought it was pretty cool. As you can see here, it's kind of like anime, but done with kind of Japanese aSCII text.
00:39:08.810 - 00:39:27.148, Speaker A: And I thought, you know, to great effect here. Just a cool little loop there. So just interesting. Ed Marolla is seen on the pokeball show. So we were looking at this and we have more clues as to what's going on. The symbols in the box mean headache device. Doc.
00:39:27.148 - 00:39:37.364, Speaker A: Asmr. Hammock. There's the hammock potion. Dream. Here's a potion. Maybe this is the dream. The closed eyes.
00:39:37.364 - 00:39:50.680, Speaker A: Mangrove cashew. Lucha Tegodego. Almost feels like a Salvador Dali like situation here. Just totally irrational. Seemingly irrational juxtaposition. They are dreaming us. Beautiful title.
00:39:50.680 - 00:40:19.114, Speaker A: And you gotta love this noise at the top here. What headache. So this, it seems to be multi chain because we go to foundation and we get this work here that was posted actually. But actually, first we'll go to. So I never saw this posted anywhere or minted anywhere. What device? Who is Doctor Asmir? So, Ed, working on something here. Pretty interesting, esoteric kind of work here.
00:40:19.114 - 00:40:42.564, Speaker A: And as you see, they're dreaming us. This is the tezo side of a multi chain NFT project by Ed Morolla. A story of intertwined dreams, strange haikus and the extinction of homo sapiens. So there we see that work, edition of 100. But then we also see it here on foundation, which is on Ethereum. So multi chain work here. And this is the first piece, as far as I can see, minted here.
00:40:42.564 - 00:41:01.748, Speaker A: Headache. They are dreaming us. An interesting combination of dreaming and the headache here. And so very, very, very interesting work. Almost looks like a photographic here. Almost, but probably not. It's probably just super processed grass.
00:41:01.748 - 00:41:17.964, Speaker A: But it looks quite organic. Does, doesn't it? But maybe, but not sure. Maybe it is taking a source from somewhere and a couple of little kind of devil figures here. Interesting piece. I have a strange headache. Purple can help you. So very, very enigmatic.
00:41:17.964 - 00:41:45.404, Speaker A: And you got to love the red border here. Very cool cider. As we continue through the works here. So, cider posting this beautiful car here. Is this a cybertruck, the cider truck? It is a cider truck here. And there you see cider's face on the front of the cider truck. Kind of reminds you, I think it's machine who had that work and was machine taking it off of someone else.
00:41:45.404 - 00:42:37.398, Speaker A: So all to say this is almost like meme. It's become like a meme, putting the face on the front of this truck here and there's a cider truck. And you gotta love, again, Sider's distortions here and the bright red flat background here, contrasting with all of the kind of noise in the middle. As you know, people have listened to the. And I'm actually recording and uploading all of the Twitter spaces since November, so those will be up soon enough. But for those that attended the cider space, which is up online on Spotify, you'll learn that cider goes back and forth from physical to digital, as far as I understand. So if you're wondering how some of these incredible textures are made, that is likely one of the reasons.
00:42:37.398 - 00:42:57.710, Speaker A: Studying electrical engineering, if I'm not mistaken, or industrial engineering out in Brazil. Here are a couple more from cider. So some more portraits here. So very powerful works here. I think they're going to be minted soon, as far as I understand. And here's another one, actually. This is what's going to be minted soon.
00:42:57.710 - 00:43:37.186, Speaker A: Soon to be vented via manifold. So interesting work here from cider. Just a whole bunch of black and white texture here. Hard to see what that is. Almost looks like a map, but not quite. And then here, more just kind of black and white seeming abstraction here. So very cool work there from cider here is Gozo, who, of course, works with sometimes these geometric works, and then has this other work that is more AI based digital collage, beautifully textured, kind of has that stable diffusion like texture, as you see in this background here.
00:43:37.186 - 00:44:13.464, Speaker A: And I think it's the same, I've never tried it. I haven't used stable diffusion for probably over a year. But I think the same thing, that same way that people are able to get, you know, zoomed in and get the brush strokes really nicely on these kind of AI paintings, I think is the same kind of process you're seeing with this kind of texture here. Stable diffusion, I think can create this kind of textures, these radical. Look at how fuzzy this almost looks like really rich, rich textures here. So here it kind of looks like a flower. Not sure, doesn't even matter.
00:44:13.464 - 00:44:42.998, Speaker A: Just beautiful work. Posted by Gozo and here, cyber mystic celebrating a genesis drop in the next few days on Solana. So one assumes, of course, this is Marcelo Pinel. One assumes this is going to be animated in its final version. So a little preview here from Marcelo Pinelov's a work the year of the dragon and happy Chinese new year to all celebrators. And this, I believe, the year of the dragon here. So beautiful work here.
00:44:42.998 - 00:45:10.844, Speaker A: Kind of complementing the constellations there and the astronomical signs or astrological signs that Marcello Pinella is working on. Just really cool work there. Nice preview here is rinifish, emotional crank. So let's see if there's any volume here. Oh, there is. So new work on Zora. We'll see how many are minted in a second.
00:45:10.844 - 00:45:37.424, Speaker A: So beautiful colors here. Always these kind of translucent pastels, kind of alien, kind of psychedelic. Cool audio there too. And so 235 minted. So very nice, Zora, you gotta love it. There's bersektor. I love your work.
00:45:37.424 - 00:46:04.204, Speaker A: Okay, awesome. Here's Euxine. This was just posted. Kind of an interesting piece here. Maybe a work in progress perhaps. And you see Euxine just working in almost this blue, violet and then the pink, kind of changing the palette, at least with this seeming work in progress here and this awesome text here. Just again, making it all look very easy and just very cool here.
00:46:04.204 - 00:46:21.384, Speaker A: Myth with a couple of works, Apollo Creed. And again, one of these beautiful kind of flat blue backgrounds here. We saw that with cider. And here is, I'm not sure who Apollo Creed is. Maybe that's a famous boxer. Not sure. But a really nice piece here from myth.
00:46:21.384 - 00:46:43.906, Speaker A: So beautiful addition to this series, edition of ten, available for 950. And that is on secondary, so pretty reasonable price, I thought this was awesome. Tommy the machine gun. This is myth edition of ten. Only 750 here. So these were transferred. So pretty good deal here for this.
00:46:43.906 - 00:47:00.768, Speaker A: Pretty hilarious piece here. Love the hair. Not sure who this is, but another really nice piece here. Nice adidas jacket by myth, as you see here. Kind of done in procreate, but with a square brush. So pixel brush on procreate. Very cool.
00:47:00.768 - 00:47:24.892, Speaker A: Beautiful, beautiful color. As usual here is working class McBanana and kind of an edgier work here as we see Daffy Duck seemingly being crucified on a McDonald's. McDonald's sign. Hilarious. Cool work. McDonald's hat here. And then kind of looks like a garbage bag on the head, a couple of eyes poking out.
00:47:24.892 - 00:47:50.294, Speaker A: And there you see almost the stigmata on the hands. And a banana. Interesting pink background. And again, the clouds, which we saw in an earlier work there, didn't we? And McDonald's kind of manually done there. So we saw the clouds in this other work here. So kind of a nice complement to this work, this edition of 15 with a piano, keeping with the clouds. Interesting work from working class.
00:47:50.294 - 00:48:10.810, Speaker A: Continuing on. This is rustic digital art with a wild start to that piece, as you'll see here. Wake up, sleepy head. We'll see if it. There we go. And in a wild rendition, again, always keeping it kind of unpredictable here. Look at this wild kind of painting of the head.
00:48:10.810 - 00:48:30.470, Speaker A: And almost that big question mark is almost a question mark we have, isn't it? That big, kind of super Mario question mark? And let's see. Look at that. So just very, very nice. And we'll just see one more time the texture here. Nice texture. Almost like a noise, light noise texture in the brown there. Nice touch.
00:48:30.470 - 00:48:48.530, Speaker A: And then the big Pac man chrono trigger. Now 35 tazos. It's an addition of one still available. Very cool. And look at Dan Control pushing his own limits here. What is this called? Il Banquiere, which I think is the banker. Withdraw your savings.
00:48:48.530 - 00:49:37.224, Speaker A: You'll need them to eat. Repeat next month. Now, do you notice something different? Like I do? This has Dan control is dancontrol, incorporating a different kind of mark making here from the traditional kind of gradient with no kind of edge, for lack of better term, with no outline, shall we say here, this looks pretty painterly. You know, these strokes here of this glass. And it does. And you know what it looks like to me? It looks like it's painted, so to speak, or kind of done freehand, whereas the other work looks kind of more carefully constructed, you might say. But then it looks like, the gradient is still being applied to these marks.
00:49:37.224 - 00:50:01.784, Speaker A: So very, very, very interesting kind of development here from dan control. We'll see if it continues. And look at how great the face is. Really, you know, it's pretty awesome how far, Dan, and look at it looks classical. I mean, it's a really nice rendition of this space. This looks classical. Like, really nicely done there.
00:50:01.784 - 00:50:23.754, Speaker A: Even, you know, the drapery, so to speak, or the robe and all the way through. So very nice piece. Edition of ten selling out for 25 tazos. So pretty nice work from Dan Control there. Here is mumble boy as we continue to run through this episode. Maybe we need to run faster twice. Capades.
00:50:23.754 - 00:50:45.402, Speaker A: Capads. Capades. Capades. Another interesting piece here from mumble boys. Slightly different composition. Keeping the experimentation here as you see these kind of gradients of sorts. And then again, kind of within this kind of almost physical looking collage here, you see some what look like physical brushstrokes.
00:50:45.402 - 00:51:13.986, Speaker A: And then you zoom out again, this looks like almost like a jpeg that's been, you know, enlarged too far. And then here, this almost looks like physical. So a nice combination of seeming physical and digital in this piece by mumble boy. And again, just. But here it's. Oh, that. See that little shadow right there? Doesn't that look like there's almost a tiny shadow there that makes that look physical, but there.
00:51:13.986 - 00:51:28.822, Speaker A: But it's unquestionable. There's digital editing. Right. So all pretty interesting and pretty cool. Let me just quickly check. Edition of two for eight tazos. And here is NUv 1914 pagazzo.
00:51:28.822 - 00:51:49.610, Speaker A: So I assume that's Pegasus. Pretty cool work here. So, out of greek mythology, of course. And look at that cloud. And here you see what seems to be a horse with wings. And there some great on the ground at this point. Look at that when you zoom in, how great that is.
00:51:49.610 - 00:52:14.426, Speaker A: Interesting color there, too. Interesting blue and even that kind of gradient there and that little mark there. Hilarious. Beautiful. And then you step back and you just go, oh, that holds together pretty nicely, doesn't it? Sold for ten tezos. It kind of brings back 1914. And here's another work by NUV 1914, Camino Acaza.
00:52:14.426 - 00:52:57.268, Speaker A: Doesn't this remind you a little bit of Klaus's whole strategy, if we could call it that, which is to mint a ton of work, sell it for reasonable, mostly one of ones. And Nav 1914 sells most of her work. And it is, you know, it probably puts out four or five works, maybe bringing in 40 or 50 tezos a day for all we know, at least on some days, again, that's real money. There's Klaus bringing in 20 tezos, but maybe doing two or three, maybe bringing in 40 or 50, 60 tezos a day. That's all of a sudden real money. Like, how much are you making at your job on a daily basis? Right. So you have to do the math and then start looking and then start connect the dots there.
00:52:57.268 - 00:53:26.180, Speaker A: And you can start to go, you know, this isn't a bad strategy. And we're in a pretty soft market right now, so pretty interesting. And look at this. I mean, and I'm just, you know, you know where I gravitate towards, you probably can see right now, just see that extra little line there. I, you know, it almost makes the entire work here, this little extra line, because then you're. You realize you're in the province of art. This is not just some clever design all of a sudden there.
00:53:26.180 - 00:53:48.172, Speaker A: It's just like, that's not supposed to be very cool. Camino Acaza going to one of one over for seven tezos. Pretty good deal. And here is stalka with a new work, I believe. Is this new. Okay, we'll see if we can find the. Here's the bids a day ago.
00:53:48.172 - 00:53:55.644, Speaker A: Yeah. So going for a sol. Nice work. Stalker. That is the. Okay, we don't need the chat. We will get this.
00:53:55.644 - 00:54:16.164, Speaker A: Let's see if there's volume. There's no volume. So cool work here from the great illustrator Stalka, who has really nice work on tazos. If you're ever looking, putting out a work. Welcome to the afterlife. Who knew? Who knew this was the afterlife? So cool work here from Stulca. Kind of painterly in this one.
00:54:16.164 - 00:54:34.726, Speaker A: And looks an animated, like a kind of movie of sorts. And here. Okay, there we go. There we go. And then you see maybe a kind of ghost like figure there. So who knew this was the afterlife? And so very cool. Let's continue going for a sell at auction.
00:54:34.726 - 00:54:58.044, Speaker A: Here's Pomelo. And let's see if we can get this going. Always cool jazz. It's feeling like Friday. Really nice jazz there. We'll see if we can find out who it is. Almost like a little key cat to.
00:54:58.044 - 00:55:15.704, Speaker A: Very original. Very original drawing here. Like white on. Almost white here, white on cream. Let's see what's going on here. Probably looks like the music is by Pomelo. I'm Pomelo the Clown and I can't die.
00:55:15.704 - 00:55:37.502, Speaker A: So maybe this is almost a self portrait of at least the character Pomelo. And this has been listed for ten tazos. Nice piece. Beautiful music. Love the vibe. Jake Studios, life after death. So, continuing this, you know, crucifixion theme here, as we see this figure here with almost fire on the arms.
00:55:37.502 - 00:56:02.194, Speaker A: And again, we've got this kind of stigmata of sorts, and maybe vision pro with a halo. And there's a cigarette. Almost looks like the super rare logo there, interestingly. And some wild kind of pixelated clouds, both up and down. And then this chain. So, again, very intuitive, just seemingly following. And there's the head of this person here.
00:56:02.194 - 00:56:18.602, Speaker A: So seemingly just following whatever seems to work. And there's something to be said for that. Kind of brings us back to Andre Breton's first definition of surrealism. Right. Pure psychic automatism. Right. It seems like there's a kind of psychic, you know, just going.
00:56:18.602 - 00:56:44.178, Speaker A: Not thinking too hard. Jake Studios works pretty fast, too. And so, you know. And so, therefore, you know, maybe doesn't have time, like so is able. That's one of the working fast has its benefits, because all of a sudden he's able to come up with things that he might not come up with had he been thinking for four days on what to do. So, life after death. Interesting piece.
00:56:44.178 - 00:57:08.918, Speaker A: 55 tezos, one of one. Here's another work by Katerina Creat. And thank you for the video that came out over the weekend. It made me think, you know, people have mentioned it to me. I can't remember who said it. You know, more people should be making videos referring to what I was doing over here. So Katarina put out a video, and that's what went through my head, you know, it's a very powerful medium, video, to state the obvious.
00:57:08.918 - 00:57:31.354, Speaker A: Anyway, let's look at Katarina's work. Unexpected rider. This is a one of one for 20 tezos. Here. And there we see the Katarina create figure with what looks like a black goat, perhaps, and a moon on top. So, again, continuing the series and very cool animation here in the grass and also in the sky here. Very subtle kind of colored animation.
00:57:31.354 - 00:57:48.774, Speaker A: So cool work there, making a big triangle. Interesting as a composition. Unexpected rider, part of the Riders series, which we've been looking at. This is going for 20 tezos, one of one on object. And here is Turkaract. Push man. Pushed man.
00:57:48.774 - 00:58:11.414, Speaker A: And this is a one of one for twelve tezos. And again, just another interesting piece by Turkarak. Always kind of going with kind of the darker side of human nature. So a little bit of violence here in this work here. Kind of capturing, you know, these emotions. Interestingly on in digital artworks. This is pretty interesting, too.
00:58:11.414 - 00:58:30.952, Speaker A: Kind of a bleaker work. This is Matt Fury. And here we see the colonel, KFC. Colonel Sanders here. And then you see the workers of the. And you see the chickens that probably go into the burgers. And, of course, the colonel being the puppet master here.
00:58:30.952 - 00:59:05.336, Speaker A: You know, I found this to be a pretty powerful work in the sense that it really got you thinking about the animals. You know, how many more of us would be vegetarian? I'm not, by the way, but when you see, works like this, they're powerful. Like, how many more of us would be vegetarian if we knew where. Like, if we saw, you know, the beginning to the end of the food process? I suspect a lot more of us, maybe myself included. Continuing on. Sebast Estaro. I found you.
00:59:05.336 - 00:59:18.048, Speaker A: It's too much. It's too much. Sebast Estaro, 90 tezos, one edition of one. Interesting composition. Cool. Classic kind of seba sestaro colors. And here, look how huge this work is.
00:59:18.048 - 00:59:37.926, Speaker A: And then we see this tiny figure here with this long psychological shadow facing this kind of, you know, light source here. Almost like a sun, interestingly, barefoot. Oh, no. With shoes on. Cool piece. So this is 90 tezos on object. The gateway to infinity is a series.
00:59:37.926 - 00:59:57.468, Speaker A: And here's another work along the same lines with a figure looking into this abstraction here. So very cool. I follow Saiba, of course, that is a glitch on x. Psycho futurist. So I'm not sure if I've seen psycho futurist before. Seemed like a cool work. Aliens smell like the famous whiff of roasted marshmallows.
00:59:57.468 - 01:00:16.968, Speaker A: Pretty original. Interesting combination. We have aliens at the bottom almost looking like AI there. Interestingly, but not necessarily, but almost looking that way. There's a cow. And then you see the. It almost looks like a collage to a certain degree of AI aspects, but also drawn.
01:00:16.968 - 01:00:35.404, Speaker A: This kind of looks drawn here. Hard to say, but, you know, just an enigmatic gif. I believe this is a gif in this edition of ten. This is now. So this sold out for three tazos. Pretty reasonably priced there. So just interesting piece.
01:00:35.404 - 01:01:06.874, Speaker A: Fun piece from psycho futurist. Continuing on here is don't buy the catcher in the rye. And very interesting description with this c colon slash. And then here we see what looks like, sort of like object recognition from surveillance cameras with some imagery. And this person here going through a wheat field. So kind of a very. Almost like a picture of our thoughts to a certain degree.
01:01:06.874 - 01:01:30.012, Speaker A: And look at how I love this, how the cloud you know, shifts over to these windows here. Very cool. Interesting title. Catcher in the rye, five tezos edition of ten. Continuing on, here's demon ego games that taste, that test my patience. So interesting piece here on Zora. Just listed eight minted and just a cool.
01:01:30.012 - 01:01:53.656, Speaker A: Another gif here. And cool pixelation down there. More. This one looks more digital, doesn't it? So, keeping us all guessing here, but also I think demon ego likes to scan stuff in as well. Anyway, interesting piece here, like the blue. And just fun work. Continuing on here is Slava three stupefaction.
01:01:53.656 - 01:02:27.834, Speaker A: And here we see a skull with what looks like a bit of. What would you call that? It's almost like. It's like an effect that you get. Almost like this kind of rainbow kind of glitching of sorts of the cmyk and anyway, and so just cool work here. Skeleton with what looks like maybe some ascii text not necessarily coming from the skull. 44 minted also on Zora. Here's a cool work by Jacques the truth.
01:02:27.834 - 01:02:46.258, Speaker A: And so I'm not going to leave this on Internet, Internet, just scam. So interesting piece here. Not going to leave it on too long because of the flash. Interesting dithering in the background there. The truth. Here's guru, guru hyena gugades. Interesting title.
01:02:46.258 - 01:03:14.950, Speaker A: And again, looking like some worldwide web clips and gifs here from the nineties here with a bit of a Photoshop background and maybe even a little bit of Photoshop or some kind of window here. And here, a prompt of sorts. And here, two minted so far. This is also on Zora. Cool work. Mint started on February 10. Continuing on, another work by Juana Pedro.
01:03:14.950 - 01:03:38.306, Speaker A: So we looked at a previous work here that was very similar to this. Here's a new one and we'll see if we can get this. Maybe because of the temporary block. Yeah, here it is. So unfortunately, I can't make it too big. Maybe if we do that. But it's just a really cool series.
01:03:38.306 - 01:04:10.882, Speaker A: I love the work here. I love this series. There's something very powerful about it. It basically seems to be taking, you know what I like about it? What speaks to me is it's almost taking this video game paradigm, right, a visual paradigm, and it's kind of re contextualizing it, it's remixing it, it's kind of using that as a source. And then going, I'm going to be an artist with all this stuff and I'm going to start making a bunch of strokes. Pretty nice. Just interesting, interesting background.
01:04:10.882 - 01:04:52.736, Speaker A: Again, using this gaming kind of device, this tiling. As you know, it reminds me to a certain degree of. What is his name? The great german artist who was the, you know, very, very famous, and he worked alongside Gerhard Richter, was basically the german answer to Warhol. Polke, polke Sigmar polka. One of the things he would do was he would take, like, old sheets or old patterns and then use that as the source, as a canvas of sorts. And you kind of see a similar thing going on here, on this work here. So look at that.
01:04:52.736 - 01:05:11.310, Speaker A: Here's the physical version. So very, very, very interesting. So cool work from Juana Pedro. Here's Mo moe. S h I T. Who are you? I thought this was a great piece. This is minted on Zora.
01:05:11.310 - 01:05:27.394, Speaker A: Kind of a wild piece. Not sure if it's an AI work. I mean, it seems like Mo is putting out a ton of AI work. Still is only one minted, but I think it was just listed here. Very. Just an interesting piece here. Original.
01:05:27.394 - 01:05:42.218, Speaker A: Could be a combination of AI and stuff. Not sure. Interesting gif. And here, hilariously, is RJ. The creation of Adam, or creation Adam. This is an edition of 15. And I think these were only going for a Tezos.
01:05:42.218 - 01:06:10.048, Speaker A: And as you see, I think it's using minesweeper to create, of course, the creation of Adam by Michelangelo on the Sistine chapel. On the ceiling of the Sistine chapel. Beautiful rendition, by the way. And here, what did this sell for? Only a Tezos. So, you know, artists are finding very creative ways to still bring in revenue in a soft market. Nifty monkey caster saw this first. Not sure what this is.
01:06:10.048 - 01:06:37.972, Speaker A: It almost felt abstract. Or if it's new. Maybe it's old, not sure, but I thought it was pretty cool. So this is nifty monkey, who, of course, always gets pretty huge traffic. 13,000 so far here. So interesting, kind of jittery work. Seems to really understand the vibe of the Internet and social media in terms of just that glitchy Twittery or glitchy pixelated goodness.
01:06:37.972 - 01:07:02.574, Speaker A: Let's call it pixology. This looks new, doesn't it? We haven't seen from pixology for a while, at least as far as I understand. I like the monochromatic look here and there. You even see this ancient egyptian like figure here in the background. So interesting piece here by. And you gotta love the frame by pixology. So looking like they're back on the scene.
01:07:02.574 - 01:07:21.298, Speaker A: Francois, gamma shape, ado four. So this was just minted, too. This is three tezos. And interesting piece here. Looking like playing with 3d, but also playing with these, kind of. With pixelation. Shape ad zero, four, edition of 16.
01:07:21.298 - 01:07:45.158, Speaker A: And here's another really cool work. X. Look around. And this is an edition of 30 at three tezos each. So very nice rendering, if you can see that, of a figure or something going on there. Kind of half abstract, kind of looks like a figure, but with all sorts of cool lines coming around, coming from it. Continuing on, Renato Marini.
01:07:45.158 - 01:07:57.132, Speaker A: Furnace. I thought this was pretty cool, too. And looking like a furnace there. And interesting framing here and everything. Great color. Just simple concept. Very cool.
01:07:57.132 - 01:08:14.304, Speaker A: Pixel art, animation, conceptual art, edition of 100, going for 33 tezos cents. So pretty reasonable price. And here's Nicholas Sassoon. Very cool work. Here's the new RGB study number. 50. Again, the value of being prolific, but of a different one to keep you company.
01:08:14.304 - 01:08:30.635, Speaker A: And look at this, you know, 50. It took 50. And then all of a sudden, you get like. And they were all looking pretty good. And then you get, like, a spectacular work. It's like Klaus, at the beginning, there's, you know, has made several wonderful works. But then at 126, it's like, boom.
01:08:30.635 - 01:08:58.721, Speaker A: I was like, I want to start with this, you know? And so it just goes to show, like, it's actually, in a weird way, I'd say there's no debate. You know, I was also thinking, and people have brought this up before, like, it's so easy to be scarce, to make your art scarce. It's like. It's called not making any. The hard thing is to be prolific. So it's not really even a debate in my mind, to be honest. So here, again, I just think it's like we see over and over the value of being prolific.
01:08:58.721 - 01:09:13.913, Speaker A: And this is. This looks fabulous. Look at this beautiful color here. This beautiful animated abstract. And here is popple with a new pixel artwork here. Emi Tanaka in the back alley. Part of a series called Tokai Jihane.
01:09:13.913 - 01:09:24.316, Speaker A: And this is 30 tezos edition of 25. And there is one left. So doing very well here. Look. Look at that. Look at that. Look at popple.
01:09:24.316 - 01:09:42.508, Speaker A: They're selling at 15, I should say so. Nice work from popple. Now, 30 tazos, probably for the. Yeah, that's on secondary. So let's take a closer look here. And it looks like combining maybe some generative art and some pixel art again. And here, kind of a different vibe, though.
01:09:42.508 - 01:10:14.904, Speaker A: I mean, still has a bit of the Sci-Fi thing, but, you know, kind of looks like a schoolgirl with a knife here, but it kind of looks like outer space, you know, but a different resolution here. Still different from those other. And look at that. This area right down here with the kind of bubbling area where the piping is at the bottom. So cool work from popple here. Sticking with it is 800 by 800. And I think that is one of popple's favorite canvas sizes here.
01:10:14.904 - 01:10:27.848, Speaker A: I don't think we looked at this one. Contemporary laptop. When did this come out? February 10. And it is the 12th, so we haven't seen this one yet. This is an edition of 20. This is Muji. I loved the title contemporary laptop.
01:10:27.848 - 01:10:52.642, Speaker A: And here we see these just beautiful kind of rainbow, you know, almost like wires or energy going in and out of the computer here. And this cool keyboard. Beautifully colored computer. You know, the color of the computer there, that kind of beautiful beige. Working with this kind of rich gray grain. Gray green, really. Muji's got a great sense of color from my perspective.
01:10:52.642 - 01:11:29.284, Speaker A: And then you have this beautiful. Another interesting kind of, you know, remember the last one with what would almost look like metallic, you know, these, you know, cycling gradients here in the piece, keeping the innovation there. Here is Tom Bombadil, lord of the blue abyss. And this kind of felt like this kind of reminded me of Jules Verne to a certain degree. Kind of had that vibe to it. And here it's one of these kind of, like, almost robotic here, massive underwater fish. And there is kind of like a classic 1940s, 1950s style guy underground.
01:11:29.284 - 01:11:50.988, Speaker A: And here you see a light here. Again, it kind of has all the feelings of, like, a Jules Verne novel. And again, deep under the sea. And cool title, lord of the Blue Abyss. This is 18 tezos selling out at five tezos each. So market's doing pretty well, frankly. Alive and well is how I describe this market.
01:11:50.988 - 01:12:03.292, Speaker A: Double comet. This is quite cool, too. This came out. This is an edition of one so far, open edition. And sometimes you get lucky. And these turn into one of ones. And this is XOXo.
01:12:03.292 - 01:12:19.852, Speaker A: So not Zozo, but Zozo, I think, is how we pronounce this. And almost looking like these super Mario stars here. And then a luminescent one coming out when they join. Interestingly cool piece. And let's continue. Go golita. Celestial equilibrium.
01:12:19.852 - 01:12:44.976, Speaker A: So continuing with kind of like an animated, abstract vibe here. And as you see, all of this rich pixelation here, but bringing in a lot of, what you might say, the color innovations of the last series. And now bringing them into these more kinda, again, animated, abstract works. Cool work here. Edition of 100 for five tezos. And let's see how many are left here. Four left.
01:12:44.976 - 01:13:29.384, Speaker A: Wow. Here is acidboy exploring p five js, which of course, if you can get your JavaScript or p five js going on, it must be a very tempting to. Again, I'm always looking at ordinals if you can get low file sizes. And so this another interesting work here by acidboy. Must be an interesting process. Like I wonder, I assume you start just playing with variables and things start to come out like in the code, and then all of a sudden you hit render and you don't even know what's going to show up. It's like a different, it's kind of like it reminds you of AI, how you can put in a prompt and you kind of have to a certain degree, not much idea what's going to come out.
01:13:29.384 - 01:13:51.844, Speaker A: Programming is similar. It's similar but different. So cool work by Acidboy Lucas legend, thank you for collecting. So here, another interesting kind of work here. Kind of looks like code. And another interesting animated abstract, this time in black and white, as usual, actually. And that is on object.
01:13:51.844 - 01:14:36.614, Speaker A: And here's a work by Renki. Interesting piece here, kind of reminiscent of those works you've seen in the gallery by that minimalist, is it Donald Judd, is that the name? Seki? You know, famous minimalist works here, but playing with light here. So just interesting piece here. This is a one of one, and not listed here is Louise Andre Gamma with a pretty cool, it's been releasing a lot of cool work actually. Again, seeming to play with fractals here. And as we see even from, you see the, even the triangles here, these all kind of look like fractals, so making pretty interesting work. The colors probably based out of fractals too.
01:14:36.614 - 01:15:02.054, Speaker A: Interesting composition ratio here. Sure cool title edition of ten for five tazos on object. Here's a work by Jodha. Getting some love here. And this was listed when just I think yesterday. Already 6000 views here. Interesting piece here, just animated abstract, pretty low resolution on purpose, kind of pixelated abstract.
01:15:02.054 - 01:15:38.650, Speaker A: Here's flux zero nine by Braun, and a very, just cool series here. This one kind of looks more like kind of flowing, almost like liquid flowing from right to left here, almost like lava flows. And here we see all different kinds of dithering here. You see dithering or rendering of digital objects, so to speak, for lack of better term. Interesting color flux zero nine. This is edition of 23 for two tezos, 30 tezos cents. Continuing on, uri j, which could hang right beside that brawn work.
01:15:38.650 - 01:15:58.606, Speaker A: Interesting post here. And what looks like plankton or an amoeba there. So another cool work here. Again, kind of playing along similar lines here. Similar but different static. And here's an abstract by Santiago, which I think is going to be on super rare for some reason. I don't know why I thought that.
01:15:58.606 - 01:16:17.142, Speaker A: Thought I saw something. But all to say, another cool abstract here with a ton going on from santiago. Kind of epic abstract there. And here's Santiago ruau, kind of almost looking like a mask. I come from the past. I am your ancestor. And of course I follow santiago.
01:16:17.142 - 01:16:31.206, Speaker A: And this is on Zora. Interesting piece here. It's starting to get a little bit more feel. It's starting to feel a little bit more representational. It's like there's. We're just inching towards figurative or representational. I come from the past.
01:16:31.206 - 01:17:08.710, Speaker A: Love the title. And yeah, it looks like a shamanic mask. So edition of 16, minted so far and available for another 168 days. So you have time on that one. Here's walk with another work, 1015. And the more I see this series, it's kind of like klaus, if Walk had released only like three or four of these, I'm not sure if you'd have the same kind of credibility as, you know, here we are 3 hours later, two and a half hours later, you know, 200 works later, and it's starting to feel epic. And then you start going, yeah, you could start to.
01:17:08.710 - 01:17:36.786, Speaker A: It starts to gather more significance. Right? And then you start going. You ask the museum question yourself, like, could I picture this in a museum? It gets easier and easier after, like, you know, work number 200. Because then there's a kind of credibility that has been built up. A significance has been built up, meaning has been accumulated. Right? So here's 1015 looking. And again, you can get this series, this museum worthy series right now.
01:17:36.786 - 01:18:01.600, Speaker A: Only a tezos at auction here is Rannix Deer. Endless GM. So I believe this is from the new series here. So playing with light and playing also, you know, with the blacks and the whites here and then mixing them with color. Kind of simple and very cool. Almost reminding you of those other minimalist works with the. With the fluorescent lights.
01:18:01.600 - 01:18:22.296, Speaker A: Right, so very nice minimal piece here from Ranix Deer. And here's DJ Curo and MCH X. So they are collaborating. I don't think this has been minted anywhere yet, but almost like a drawing here and then. So interesting. And it almost looks. You see that color field in the background? Almost looks like MCh X.
01:18:22.296 - 01:18:47.506, Speaker A: But then there's a drawing over top. Interesting combination there from Kiro. And just going to leave this on for a second from tug can. So a very flux number 16. A very intense work there from Tugan. And here's code Nakazono as we run through this episode. Continuum number 191.
01:18:47.506 - 01:19:16.834, Speaker A: So interesting piece here. A little more square like kind of a different feel to it. You still have this kind of liquid form in the front, but quite a different look to it and even a different shape. Like, oftentimes these are rectangular. Continuum number 191. We're kind of back to this credibility issue. Like, the more you put out, hasn't coda built up an enormous amount of credibility? I would argue by now at 191.
01:19:16.834 - 01:19:46.640, Speaker A: It's interesting, isn't it? And so here, selling ten tezos, each edition of 20, you know, so. And being rewarded for it by the market. We have a few from bosque Grazias, who, of course, was on the homepage of object on the weekend. So that was awesome. So here we're going to go pretty quick edition of five for five tezos is called cattle. So another beautiful juxtaposition. The cream at the bottom, just on a color level, just totally makes it for me, it's just you.
01:19:46.640 - 01:20:06.724, Speaker A: Beautiful, beautiful color. Those almost analog colors. Here's another one called everywhere edition of two for seven tazos. So just beautiful. Kind of looks like digital treatment in the coloring, right? But so physical at the same time. And I just love even the white, the white background, but it's not a perfect white. It looks literally.
01:20:06.724 - 01:20:22.162, Speaker A: Maybe it is a perfect white, but it reminds me of like a light. Like this is put on a light table, right? Look at this one. Got palm trees here. Time harvesting. Great title, too. And again, just awesome, awesome color here. Beautiful juxtaposition.
01:20:22.162 - 01:20:53.070, Speaker A: Again, kind of very loose and fun. Feeling like a Rauschenberg in its kind of placement of images. I mean, there is an advantage, of course, to working physically, right? Because you get a looseness where you just put it on and there's a randomness. Again, the randomness of physicality is a huge. We saw it in axe, we see it in element li and we're seeing it here just by. Oh, I just put it down there. And it's something we really appreciate in Rauschenberg, and it helps give.
01:20:53.070 - 01:21:20.814, Speaker A: But maybe let's just imagine that this red here is a digital treatment. It's tempting to think that, isn't it? Like, otherwise, how else was that red made? Was it really red? Right. So it makes it all very interesting. It's this hybrid of physical and digital. And there seems to be a lot of potential there, right? A lot of dunamis there. Workers. Here's another awesome piece.
01:21:20.814 - 01:21:45.434, Speaker A: And we see again this beautiful, beautiful, very rich red. And then again and this kind of clear negative with this dark negative. And then just this kind of like scene from probably the seventies there. And here is psycho score. Broken well, this is touch designer and 3d scanning. Broken well at a temple. So still playing with the temples in Tokyo.
01:21:45.434 - 01:22:09.296, Speaker A: Let's see if this plays. And there we go. The kirakira, the shine. So interesting use of 3d scanning here. And we even kind of zoom in a little bit. Kind of looks like a well of sorts or some sort of, you know, water. You can get to maybe fill up your water.
01:22:09.296 - 01:22:27.256, Speaker A: Some kind of fountain of sorts. Water fountain. Very, very interesting. Love the direction. Like literally like a film director. Like there's a little bit of direction, so to speak, in this work. Interestingly, this is a one of one for 100 tezos on object.
01:22:27.256 - 01:22:53.730, Speaker A: And here is Kuhei Yamashita with an unusual GLB here of these flowers here. Kind of a nice simple work. Kind of, again, would feel right at home in a contemporary art gallery, won't it? This work here, especially as a physical. So this is a GLB. So get out your vision pro. 13 tezos here. And hopefully so as we go into the AI in our final minutes here.
01:22:53.730 - 01:23:17.446, Speaker A: And I thought this was a really interesting AI. Kind of a different feel to this one. Anna Maria Caballero, research. So probably trying out a bunch of stuff, you know, and then coming across this great output here. Very interesting. And there is the tiara. So cool AI artwork here is Anna Dart, who is putting out some more work, which is awesome to see.
01:23:17.446 - 01:23:47.424, Speaker A: So some new innovations here, some new additions to our foundation. And so as we see kind of painting over top of these people. Got a couple more here. Really nice renditions, of course, AI and totally recognizable as Anna Dart here. Great top area there too. And again, we're kind of back to this physicality. Like, I mean, it's incredible how good AI is at kind of rendering this kind of sense of physicality.
01:23:47.424 - 01:23:59.312, Speaker A: They are blending together to a certain degree. So again, paint over top of these portraits here. These are going. This is a reserve of 0.55 ETH. And here's another one. Love the black background here.
01:23:59.312 - 01:24:16.872, Speaker A: This is 0.66 ETH. So very interesting work here from Anna dart. So cool to see there that's on foundation. And I adore this work by strange thing. Hilarious work. I'm trying to place the pose.
01:24:16.872 - 01:24:45.774, Speaker A: I feel like I've seen this pose? You know what it actually looks like? You know what this looks like? This is. I think I know. This is, you know, in Manet's Dejeuner Solebe, right? The guy leaning back and that. Dejeuner Solebe. Of course, art through the centuries is. What is the name of that professor on the great courses? Airy, someone you know. As you see here, this is also Rome.
01:24:45.774 - 01:25:12.454, Speaker A: And there is a God. Is it the Rome river? Okay, look at this. And then we're gonna bring up Rome river God in the capitoline museum there. We'll see. See that? That pose is very, very famous. So there was strange thing, Tiberinus. So of course, the Tiber, the God of the Tiber course, which is the river that goes through Rome.
01:25:12.454 - 01:25:49.694, Speaker A: Tiberinus is also known as the river God, who found the twins, Romulus and Remus, and gave them to the she wolf, Lupa, who had just lost her own cups to suckle. So the river, of course, is just like in ancient Egypt, the river, the Nile. You know, it's very interesting, the importance of rivers to a lot of these major, major cities. Okay, let's see. I thought this is brilliant. I don't know if we looked at this one, but I had to make sure we showed it. I love this piece, this akai sampler.
01:25:49.694 - 01:26:13.688, Speaker A: Totally awesome. Also a course by strange thing. And you just have to adore the cracking paint here in the background, which is starting to become like a major compositional element. It's becoming its own, like it's taking a life of its own. It's no longer just imitating the cracking. It kind of feels like it's almost going beyond that. So brilliant, brilliant work here.
01:26:13.688 - 01:26:38.804, Speaker A: And then the donuts for good measure there. Stussy. Brilliant, brilliant work by strange thing. Here's Martin Jo the bear at breakfast with some mushrooms there in the background. And here we see the wonderful bear's breakfast there with some sausages and some coffee and some mushrooms with the great tablecloth there. So I'm not sure, I don't think. And I definitely follow Martin Joe.
01:26:38.804 - 01:27:06.660, Speaker A: That is an x glitch. So not sure if these have been. Martin Joe mentioned that maybe he was going to mint the breakfast and the goodnight bears. Here's Mister Shapeless, who also I follow. Awesome to see Mister Shapeless back on the scene here with again, DER vonderer kind of figure here, looking off into the great expanse here. And almost like a landscape in the sky of sorts. An interesting sun with shadow on it.
01:27:06.660 - 01:27:20.844, Speaker A: Cool work there. And here is score just a laptop and a little kind of figure. Not even sure what that is. A very nice piece from score. More of a minimal piece or. Sorry, not score. Skomra.
01:27:20.844 - 01:27:40.322, Speaker A: Sorry. Skomra. Beautiful piece by Skomra here. Again with these great, what seem to be like, you know, AI, stable diffusion, textures. And look at that great computer there by Skomra. And here is no hygiene with another experimental AI art piece here. So cool work there.
01:27:40.322 - 01:28:03.504, Speaker A: I don't know if it's been minted anywhere. Just posted on x. And here's another skomra as we see here, these great colors here, which, again, kind of reminiscent of those analog video glitch. And then a little figure here, and then some programming at the bottom there. So very cool there. And finally here into the physical we go. So we were looking at this artist before.
01:28:03.504 - 01:28:27.798, Speaker A: Who is this again? Uriel. Physical artwork, 40 by 60. So fairly small to have so much in there. So very cool artist here. And as you can see on the very edge that is the table, so beautiful artwork, 40 by 60. It's almost about like two, a four s put together. So what this looks like, which is.
01:28:27.798 - 01:29:08.052, Speaker A: Which makes an a three, by the way, here is Roos. So we looked at Roos maybe over a year ago, and this, I think, is in the fake whale show. And again, Roos working with physical, I think, primarily, but it doesn't look like exclusively because as you see there, that looks like a little bit of digital, a little bit of digital effect there. So a hybrid, interestingly, I think. I think we can say that there of digital and physical. Cool work. Continuing on, the school of Athens here by Adam Lister studios.
01:29:08.052 - 01:29:37.976, Speaker A: So we've been looking at Adam Lister's work here and here. Hopefully that block is not permanent or for too long here. And here is, of course, Raphael's school of Athens in the four stanzas in the Vatican, not far from the Sistine chapel that we're looking at with RJ's the creation of Adam there. So again, just in this style, super original style. Just very cool work there. This is cool. Austin Joseph Gregory, commission police.
01:29:37.976 - 01:29:55.030, Speaker A: Super pleased with how this turned out. It looks great. A great kind of juxtaposition. It almost looks like two works on top of each other. This is Austin Joseph Gregory. Really nice piece here. We've seen a lot of Bob sic Matilla's work, Archangel.
01:29:55.030 - 01:30:16.464, Speaker A: So we may have seen this before, but we're going to see a few. We're going to revisit a little bit or maybe see new ones here. I thought this composition was brilliant. I think we've already looked at it, but I'm not sure. Could be a different one. Edgy again, it's kind of back to rawness here, leaving things empty. Let me try just reloading and see if that helps us here.
01:30:16.464 - 01:30:33.224, Speaker A: There we go. No, it's not helping. My, oh, my. What are we going to do here? Okay, so here's another one by Bob Sick. And here is another one by Bob Sick. So just doing a little tour of Bob sick's work there. Uh, let's see if we can do this.
01:30:33.224 - 01:30:48.604, Speaker A: And here's Kelowna contemporary. So Sanillo. Sanillo's Beck studio. Into me, I thought this was quite beautiful. So another incredible artist at Kelowna contemporary. And you see here, just beautifully painted. More brilliant paintings out there.
01:30:48.604 - 01:31:07.804, Speaker A: Hack, hack, Herman Joseph. I mean, there was a time when I would look at least and I felt like I couldn't find anything. Now there's just like a total outpouring of a lot of great work. I'd never. Herman, hack Herman Joseph. I mean, just another interesting work. This looks like it was done on a paper bag.
01:31:07.804 - 01:31:31.674, Speaker A: Very nice work here. 48 by 40. Here is another one which looked like the northern lights. So this is actually older, 1916 to 1917. You know what's funny about that or about this? This looks like it could totally fit in with our works. I just assumed it was another one of these great works that we're coming across here. So that's from 1916, 1917.
01:31:31.674 - 01:31:57.670, Speaker A: Kelowna contemporary. This is annibal Arganaraz. So another interesting work from Kelowna contemporary here. So just very impressive. What's going on over there? And here is Thibault Vincent Duzematier with almost this kind of Marilyn Manson figure here. This is from. It's not gallery, which I think we've seen a lot from.
01:31:57.670 - 01:32:29.468, Speaker A: I thought it was just of very original, that whole piece, the composition, subject matter, how it was painted. Here's another one. Bemiso, what now? Acrylic on canvas. Right? So we're seeing this outpouring of contemporary painting. You know, I barely used to show any painting. I don't know if the Instagram algorithm has improved, which is maybe why all of a sudden I'm seeing a ton of it. But also interesting, Ime Smith with this hourglass here and a snake coming across it.
01:32:29.468 - 01:32:52.464, Speaker A: This is from 2019, Temptation island. Just another interesting work there. And here, Rune Christiansen. So we've been looking at Roon Christensen's work. There is the artist. And I thought it was interesting for us to just see it there within the context of a gallery and a person, just for scale, you see how great they look. You gotta love that gray background and here that gray blue background.
01:32:52.464 - 01:33:10.328, Speaker A: Just an awesome, awesome artist here. Quiet at dawn, 120 by 100 cm oil spray paint, acrylic and oil pastel. So multimedia there. Framed in oak. Just very awesome work there. And finally, dray gallery. This is in Toronto, I believe.
01:33:10.328 - 01:33:24.864, Speaker A: And this is. What is the name? Hannah Epstein. So interesting piece here. Kind of edgy work here. Kind of looking almost like a rug of sorts. Kind of a wild work there. So kind of textiles.
01:33:24.864 - 01:33:43.004, Speaker A: And that, my friends, is your show. Hopefully I fix the Instagram. And so we're gonna have Kayla on, on Wednesday on the Twitter space, so join us for that. And I'll also be releasing a video earlier that day. Thank you for joining me. And until next time, take care.
