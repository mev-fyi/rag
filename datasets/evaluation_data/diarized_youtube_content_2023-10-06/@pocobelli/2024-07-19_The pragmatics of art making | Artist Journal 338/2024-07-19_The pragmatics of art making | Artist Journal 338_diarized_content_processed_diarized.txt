00:00:04.960 - 00:00:26.838, Speaker A: It feels kind of meta, doesn't it? At least from over here, where I'm looking at a computer kind of looking at a similar situation. Hilarious. Welcome back. Happy Friday. Artist Journal, Friday 19th, 2024. Friday 19th. It's Friday the 19th.
00:00:26.838 - 00:01:00.132, Speaker A: Friday, July 19, 2024. My first words of the day to you, my friends. Welcome back. My name is Adrian Pokebelli, broadcasting from Berlin, Germany, on a beautiful, beautiful, sunny Friday morning here. So hallelujah. Thank you for the massive response on the last video and everything, as I continue to struggle with the technical difficulties called my hair. But luckily, you know, recently, those are the only technical difficulties I'm having.
00:01:00.132 - 00:01:33.250, Speaker A: So that is wonderful. So I was mentioning Kappn yesterday for those that don't know, talking about when I was talking about diathemos likes and the static and the dynamic pixels, the moving pixels and the. Or the moving parts of the image and the parts of the image that are not moving, that is. This is Kappan, who here is going under, I think, also goes under figments. And here is going under figments. Okay. This is part of a series, kind of a.
00:01:33.250 - 00:02:05.544, Speaker A: I don't want to call it obscure, but it's not the most well known series. Put it this way, when I was looking at it, and I follow Kapn's work pretty closely, I didn't realize the series existed, let's put it that way. So just a cool series here by Kappen. And, you know, here's just another example. When you move in, when you zoom in of what's at work here. And of course, using vintage software, retro tools, as I like to call them. Look at this shelf, right? And this just.
00:02:05.544 - 00:02:49.826, Speaker A: I think this is like some sort of 1980s software. I think Kappan mentioned it. For those that want to dig, it's on the space we did maybe a year ago. Kappen out of Costa Rica, aka figments. When you go up close, it's quite amazing, isn't it? Even here, again, you see the power here, the pixels aren't even really moving. I guess maybe you could say they're moving a little bit there, a little bit here. But just even to put static, and again, flashing and non flashing pixels, there's something really, again, it's contrast, you know, at the end of the day, but it's a kind of contrast you only find, arguably, in digital art, right? So it's what we might call a new contrast.
00:02:49.826 - 00:03:12.210, Speaker A: New contrasts. And here, I believe this is the title of the work. Taco. Tacos. Or tacos again, coming out of Costa Rica here, perhaps there is a connection there. And look at how beautiful. You know, you see the mouse and the horizontal, the horizontal pixels here as well.
00:03:12.210 - 00:03:56.192, Speaker A: Just beautiful. The keyboard. Not worrying about needing to get every row of the keys. So it's kind of almost, you could argue, a kind of impressionistic take. Of course, there's usually more than two rows of keys here, right? So kind of drawing in a way that makes the image work, we might say. I mean, what are the impressionists doing, you know, as they go en plein air with their newly, you know, new technology of having paint tubes to go out into the open air and travel around, which impacts the art? What are they doing? They're doing what works. And of course, if you're in plein air, you're kind of working fast, which we're going to return to.
00:03:56.192 - 00:04:27.004, Speaker A: We had another comment on that today. And so you're just doing what you need to do. We're back to the pragmatics of art making. Fascinating, actually, and super important for those that don't actually say make art and draw, but are like, love the art. The pragmatics of art making are incredibly important. Like, in a sense, you could argue it is art making or it is a large. It is the component.
00:04:27.004 - 00:04:54.240, Speaker A: I mean, it's tempting to say again, the greek word techne, that is art. You might call it little a artem, right? The techni of shoemaking. The tech. The art of shoemaking. You know, the windows, you name it. Making a computer or making a table. Table making of a friend whose last name is Tischler.
00:04:54.240 - 00:05:26.560, Speaker A: Shout out to you, Carl. Table maker. Right? So the pragmatics. So what is art? And actually, we have another tab that actually asks us, I think it was ed Marolla. What are we doing here? You know, part of what art is, in a sense. Why is art called art? I mean, I think that's kind of like almost the bigger issue. And it's like, if we're just to speculate out loud here in this public journal, you know, it's making.
00:05:26.560 - 00:05:49.626, Speaker A: Art is making. And you could argue with technical, with technique. It's making with technique. Techne, where do we get the word technology? What does technology do? It helps make, like, it's a. What is technology? You know, again, techni. Art. The art making.
00:05:49.626 - 00:06:42.796, Speaker A: Like, all of these things can start to come together here. And so you can even apply these kind of seemingly disparate concepts when you don't. The value of knowing a little bit of greek, right? Because once it all comes to, once you start associating and we have another tab back to the psychedelic psilocybin issue of association. Once you start associating everything together here, then you can look at, you know, kappan and go, okay, kappan is just, what is the art here? Like, what is the technical side of things? I'm back to this. What are the pragmatics of making this art piece? And I'm back to this very simple keyboard with two rows, right? And then there's the third row, maybe the f keys, right? And everything. The function keys, right, the numbers, but really there should be three. And we're kind of back to this.
00:06:42.796 - 00:07:47.910, Speaker A: You know, it's a digital impressionism, but we're back to the impressionists. And it's like they didn't have time to put every little thing. And that need for speed actually created a different kind of art, a different kind of technique, right? So, and using weirdly, as we incorporate and try and understand all this using new technology, the paints, right, the portable tubes that you could take out into the field, and all of a sudden I can do a landscape again, en plein air rather than in the studio, right? And then of course, you have to work fast because things are changing constantly out in that landscape, right? The clouds are moving, the sun is coming in and out, the scene is changing. A need for speed. And so isn't it interesting, right, as we go back to cap in here in this wonderful chair, I mean, the things like this is another kind of fun thing about art. I mean, is that a coffee? I love the coffee. And the chair.
00:07:47.910 - 00:08:30.830, Speaker A: Look at this chair with these horizontal. Again, these kinda, it looks like a different kind of ratio right in the pixels. These look like kind of flatter horizontal biased pixels. Look at the cross here. It's like there's a two to one or something towards the horizontal or something. So again, the benefits of trying out different kinds of software. And I think, actually, not only does this use kind of an obscure software, but I think it also, it uses too, if I remember Kappen's, what he was saying about this, it actually uses gimp, as far as I remember, on the animations.
00:08:30.830 - 00:08:49.496, Speaker A: As far as I remember. So two softwares we're back to exporting. Right? So isn't that interesting? Another technique you could argue. I would argue. So this is tacos still available. And I. I'm kind of like, what is it? Foreshadowing? I'm kind of foreshadowing all our tabs.
00:08:49.496 - 00:09:54.864, Speaker A: We almost don't need to look at the tabs because of course, there was the statement which a lot of you saw on, you know, digital art becoming a hundred billion dollar industry or 85, whatever it was, eclipsing the regular art market. And I think there's a lot of truth to that, and I don't want to kind of scoop myself on that tab. But just with that in mind, let's say this thing does, and I think people have collected it who have collected digital art. Actually, I think probably more than half would say, yeah, this is going to happen. This is going to happen. And then you have to ask yourself the question, which art is then going, what's going to make up that hundred billion dollar art market? Is it all going to be artists we haven't seen before or heard of who are still coming down the pike, you know, coming in the pipeline? Or is it going to be artists who we probably already have seen? Are we looking at a present day? Are we looking at a kind of contemporary classic of sorts without even realizing it? Here it is. And isn't it always how it goes? They sell for pennies on the dollar.
00:09:54.864 - 00:10:35.884, Speaker A: They're selling for $8.06, still available edition of 16. You know, I was thinking to myself, as I was drinking my two, three coffees, as I do before I start this show, a little secret, another technique, part of the art of making this show crucial component. I was thinking about, you know, $8.06. Like I was thinking about how cheap these are. Look at this work of art, $8.06. And isn't it always how it goes? Isn't this how it begins? Like these things? So I'm kind of back to what we were saying last couple of shows.
00:10:35.884 - 00:10:58.704, Speaker A: Be glad it's small, be glad you can buy this art for pennies on the dollar. And if you want to go on secondary, you can still get it for 16 tezos and 15 tezos and this awesome one for like $20. And actually, I brought these up. I brought these up. So here, this came out January 6. So the other one just came out. This one came out January 6.
00:10:58.704 - 00:11:55.226, Speaker A: Again available for 16 tezos, another one available for 25. So just a plant, right? And yeah, just one of my favorite artists, Kappen going under figments here, the energy. And again, interestingly, I think similar to Ed Marolla coming more out of, like Ed Marolla came more out of audio kind of commercials, if I'm not mistaken. Figments Kappen also basically came out of a band, but got inspired by what he saw in the 2020, 2021 and just has a natural ability as Ed Marolla does, and very prolific. And there's, again, there's credibility you can start. And these artists didn't start at zero, but it's actually quite interesting. And I really want to keep these shows short, but I just want to show you Kappn's journey here because it's actually quite fascinating with object's wonderful website where they just load up everything.
00:11:55.226 - 00:12:17.244, Speaker A: We'll see if my Internet cooperates. And actually we can just go even better. So these are recent works, but we can go from oldest. Let's see if it loads up. So you see, I mean, here, this awesome artist, you know, starting in what you might say, like, you know, kind of simple works here. You might say this. I love this series.
00:12:17.244 - 00:12:34.850, Speaker A: I mean, look, and you can get these, like, early works here. I think I picked up two of these. I think. I'm pretty sure I have these band rooms. So, yeah, some of them are expensive, some of them are not so expensive. And again, you have to be grateful here. But you see the development.
00:12:34.850 - 00:13:19.406, Speaker A: And my point is, people can start, I would say, relatively humbly and just trying to make their way, do a little pattern, add a little animation, and within a couple of years, let's look at the data on this. Like, here we are, mid 2024. This was January 17, 2022. So if you really put your mind to something for two years, look at how far you can go. And it didn't take Kapn very long to start making what I would consider darn poetic works. Okay, so again, some people, and who knows? Maybe Kapn just has a natural sense for it as well. But you can't dismiss.
00:13:19.406 - 00:13:58.670, Speaker A: And, you know, it's sort of like, you know, they talk about longevity, environment being, what is it, 30%, genes being 50%, whatever it is. But you can affect the result. It's not simply purely based on quote unquote talent. So all to say, here's another 1 December 20, plant lab zero two, just rad, to quote, waffles rad. And look at that awesome table here. And the chair. Look at, interestingly, it's almost like, there's almost like, look at this.
00:13:58.670 - 00:14:42.590, Speaker A: I have to very quickly open this up. What is going on here? You see this? You see the pink of the chair going over top of the table? Like, I guess another layer. Pretty fascinating, actually, results here, isn't it? Letting it shine through, because, I mean, you have almost a decision to make as an artist. We're back to the pragmatics of making an art piece for those. And I find I think if you don't make art, maybe this is extra fascinating if you do, maybe it's like, of course, Adrian. But, you know, one of the decisions you'll have to make as an artist is, oh, well, the chair should be blocking the table. So really, I should have black in here would be what I would call the rational thing to do.
00:14:42.590 - 00:15:14.868, Speaker A: But as an artist, you might go, you know what? You know, this is where the poetics of art come into play. And, you know, the poet, you know, as I like to call art, a poetic form of design. It's like, it is a form of design, but it incorporates irrational elements. And here is, you know, exhibit a. Okay, exhibit a. You know, it's like, well, actually, if this was, like, purely graphic design, we should put black here so that the chair doesn't shine through. And that would be the rational thing to do.
00:15:14.868 - 00:15:38.756, Speaker A: And because the chair is blocking the table. But this is art. And I'd argue it's far more poetic, and I would argue beautiful to let this bleed through and just put the chair on top and not worry about it, and actually let these colors dance off of each other. Right. With the table and the chair. Right. That's where it starts to become more poetic and art.
00:15:38.756 - 00:16:00.228, Speaker A: And here's a nice little landscape in the background. Look at this. I mean, this could be a work unto itself. I mean, this. The curtains, right? And sometimes, you know, again, if you're struggling out there, look at this. Even this interesting little. Almost like a fill that has just caught the edge, weirdly, there's almost like a blue fill on there.
00:16:00.228 - 00:16:14.430, Speaker A: Interesting. You know, outline of these pixels. Not all of them, though. This is something that would happen oftentimes if you're working afterwards and you do just like a fill. Not sure how that happened. Interesting, interesting. And look at this.
00:16:14.430 - 00:16:29.382, Speaker A: Look at this plant. So, again, I'm trying to keep these under an hour so that I can put them on TikTok. And so we gotta speed up here. Plantlab zero. One. Another one, another one, another one. And here.
00:16:29.382 - 00:16:50.352, Speaker A: Okay, but here we decided. Or the captain decided. You know what I don't want, actually, you know what? It probably just covers the red. Finally here I'm back to these computer chairs. Hilariously weird thing to focus on. And you got to love how the color of the computer, just black and white there. Let me see if I can zoom in.
00:16:50.352 - 00:17:06.992, Speaker A: And they're quite rad to zoom in on. You can imagine this on a huge screen. Digital art alchemically transforms when you make it super large. This is very important kind of principle and point. Okay. Like I have this peloponnesian war series. When it's small, meh.
00:17:06.992 - 00:17:42.058, Speaker A: When you put it on a screen, it's like, wow. From my own perspective, weird alchemy, right? I mean, how do you explain it? The meaning, the visual meaning changes, dare I say. Now here I was like, oh, well, look at the cap in here. Decided to block it out. But maybe that's not what happened. As a matter of fact, he just probably put it on and it just happened to probably cover all of the red pixels here. So isn't that interesting? You know, it's not like this was blocked out, probably.
00:17:42.058 - 00:18:11.032, Speaker A: But who knows? I would have to really spend ten minutes and try and open this in Photoshop to find out. But isn't that interesting using a similar color scheme, by the way, rad. Rad. Again, I feel like I'm Miss Meta. I feel like I'm looking at my studio here, of course, with a newer computer at my side here or in front of me. Anyway, figments object tazos still got it. Still got it in spades.
00:18:11.032 - 00:18:49.112, Speaker A: Let's continue. Tuna kuna, speaking of tazos, huge Tezos community member here and bull and just really cool enthusiasm on what is happening on Tezos. Fascinating vision of where he wants to take things right at the in the last few minutes there. Fascinating how he wants to make it physical stores and everything. Brilliant. As I said, in the space, as you say it, I see it of a vision with details. Let's continue here.
00:18:49.112 - 00:19:00.408, Speaker A: Just a couple of comments. Great show as always, Rosatio. Thanks for featuring my work. Thank you, Rosatio. A couple of nice comments you put online there. Totally appreciate it. Grave Otopia, a great episode.
00:19:00.408 - 00:19:16.928, Speaker A: Awesome to hear. So thank you both of you for the comments there. And also on x, we got a big response here. 59 retweets, 176 21 bookmarks. I guess I even bookmarked it. That was all of the excitement. I even bookmarked clownvamp.
00:19:16.928 - 00:19:31.628, Speaker A: Ooh. Well, listen, thank you clownvamp. Awesome to hear from you. Just put out, I think some videos interestingly, on super rare. Juan Pez, thank you for the comment. Trippie collector gonna be dope Wednesday. Kicking off the show with die with the most likes indeed.
00:19:31.628 - 00:19:57.602, Speaker A: Again, I feel like it hasn't happened enough, interestingly. Tommy good meat, hilarious. Lena Eckert, thanks a lot for including the got that flow work. That was a beautiful work. Like, I was looking at it again this morning, Lena, and I was like, I wanted to put it in the show, but I had just put it in the show but like, fantastic, fantastic work I was enjoying, was excited through the recap. Phenomenal work. Thank you.
00:19:57.602 - 00:20:10.986, Speaker A: Owen, great to hear from you. A very nice comment there. Nicolerci. Amazing episode. So thank you all for the wonderful comment. We got waffles going as le vent or the wind in French. Thanks.
00:20:10.986 - 00:20:33.330, Speaker A: Poco. Probably a small collection to be honest. About 98% is Mario artist. Interesting. So we're speculating on waffles kind of new, kind of PFP style project or at least portraits being like, oh, there seems to be a little bit of copy and paste from other works. Just needed the characters on side to tie in some themes and needed a better font for lyrics. Interesting.
00:20:33.330 - 00:21:01.500, Speaker A: So needed the characters on the side to tie in some themes and needed a better font for lyrics. Up top. By the way, it was a live Joy division album that made me revisit fast version of Lost Control and also Warsaw later in the set. And yes, I was thinking I had a bootleg of Joy Division. It was live in Amsterdam and I remember both. I feel like I've heard this before. There aren't that many bootlegs of Joy Division.
00:21:01.500 - 00:21:15.010, Speaker A: I haven't heard them all. That's the only one I had. But I remember a fast version of she lost control. Very famous track for those that don't know as well as hearing Warsaw, which is a very cool track. Starts substance. Joy division. Substance.
00:21:15.010 - 00:21:39.010, Speaker A: Oh, nice. I wonder if it was the same concert. Yeah, I had to go back to the beginning before comprehending something like dead souls. Now personally prefer the gloomier, slower temper tempo period, which is interesting because I always kind of had a bias towards the more energetic works of joy Division. But now I have to. I don't know if I prefer them. I still find them incredibly dark.
00:21:39.010 - 00:21:52.690, Speaker A: Almost too dark. But yeah. So anyway. But I do appreciate them, you might say, a little more than I used to. And I kind of just want things. I want the energy. I want the energy.
00:21:52.690 - 00:22:15.834, Speaker A: Let me actually see very quickly joy division bootleggest live in Amsterdam. Let me just see if I can bring that up. We'll see it. Like, I mean, this is the thing. This is one of my. One of my things is not everything makes it to the Internet. I think it was.
00:22:15.834 - 00:22:34.960, Speaker A: Was it parried live at the Paradiso? I think it might have been that one. Waffles if you're watching. But it had a different cover. It was a cassette. Okay, back when we had cassettes, maybe it was this cover, but I don't think so. This is like a newer version. Finally.
00:22:34.960 - 00:23:00.310, Speaker A: I'll just put cassette and we'll move on with our show here. I yeah, I feel like I remember this. I do remember something like this. It was pretty lo fi, but as far as the COVID I remember it being black and white, almost as if it was photocopied, you know, like a true bootleg. It's probably worth money at this point. Anyway. I don't.
00:23:00.310 - 00:23:20.710, Speaker A: It wasn't that so very cool? Let's just take a quick look at the other comments. Thank you. Though I love the, as you can see, I could probably spend the entire show I still, in my mind, I kind of want to have shows on joy division and whatnot. So I don't know how that fits in. But I continue. At least I'm getting the show shorter in theory. Let me continue here.
00:23:20.710 - 00:23:33.226, Speaker A: Carolina braga Ferreira very nice. Thank you. Bullseye, referring to die with the most likes heart. Awesome. Ariel Olivera Durdevic, great listening now. Congratulations. And I think beautiful work.
00:23:33.226 - 00:23:53.900, Speaker A: I think we have another one by Olivera Durdevic. This show, braindead. What a year it has been. Indeed. Let me tell you that you're one of the prodigies of web3 for me, and I'm always honored to be seen through your radar. So once again, thank you for lighting our way into the digital art ocean. It indeed is an ocean, isn't it? We're kind of lucky.
00:23:53.900 - 00:24:15.068, Speaker A: We kind of have, I was saying, I was, you know, used X and I used Instagram. I was used object. That's probably the basis of this show. The foundation is very much on object. If you look at the early shows, you'll see it's all just object notifications. Speaking of which, I continue to have issues with the object notifications. It just cycles through the last 50.
00:24:15.068 - 00:24:43.316, Speaker A: I get the first 50, and I mean to say, and I just get the first 50 repeated over, which is unfortunate. So I missed tons of works. There's, I can't. Yeah, so just if anybody from object is watching, still having issues with the notifications continuing on, it's like the JavaScript where it's the infinite scroll, I just get repeated. It doesn't continue to scroll. Maybe it's my Internet, I don't know, but it's an issue. Otherwise, fantastic website.
00:24:43.316 - 00:24:58.506, Speaker A: Just quick look at the community and it continues to grow here. Tuh. Thank you for posting. Very interesting. Original. Never seen anything quite like this. Kind of mixing what looks like kind of a font with digital painting.
00:24:58.506 - 00:25:18.002, Speaker A: Interesting combination there. And here's texadelic. Gonna get involved in the horse trading. Another interesting combination of kind of pattern. Almost looks like the ghost from from Pac man with the drawing here. Very interesting. And another grogs portal.
00:25:18.002 - 00:25:30.954, Speaker A: So cool. Pixel art here. Kind of wild. Where's this? This is on Zora free open edition and skull takes posting a new Kiro work. These are awesome. Another video painting by Kiro. Beautiful abstracts here.
00:25:30.954 - 00:25:47.016, Speaker A: And this work we saw last show, of course, by Sky Goodman. Just awesome. Also, we heard from Daiden die with the most likes. Chimed in, really thoughtful discussion of coats we once wore by poco. Huge thank you for the thought. Thank you. Die with the most likes.
00:25:47.016 - 00:26:13.200, Speaker A: Very, very great. Gracious individual there. So thank you everybody. Really nice response there last episode. Thank you everybody for the support. Joshua SIegeL so, as I was foreshadowing earlier this episode, we tracked brain changes in healthy adults before, during, and for weeks after a large dose of psilocybin, and again six months later. So we're back to this whole situation.
00:26:13.200 - 00:27:14.694, Speaker A: What does it do to the brain? Psilocybin cause profound and widespread desynchronization to brain activity, altering connections across cortical networks and subcortical structures, paralleling Carhart Harris's entropic brain hypothesis. So here it is. So, before the treatment, and I was discussing this just anecdotally, qualitatively, when a person is thinking about nothing before the treatment, when a person is thinking of nothing in particular, the brain settles into characteristic activity. Really, these paths are already made in the mind, in the brain, it's called the brain, into a characteristic activity pattern that varies little from day to day. This heat map of an individual resting brain is dominated by cool hues, blue and greenhouse. Something limited show something limited, variability over time, then they are consuming it. And again, talk to your professional.
00:27:14.694 - 00:27:41.210, Speaker A: This is not an endorsement, by the way. Talk to a professional if you've never done this or you thought, just so you know. Let me just couch this all in that statement there. The trip. So when people are on psilocybin, consuming psilocybin causes profound changes to a person's normal brain activity. Pattern shown in the heat map is yellow, orange and red areas. You see all these new connections or activity is being made is happening.
00:27:41.210 - 00:28:07.014, Speaker A: Let's just call it activity. But how is the activity happening? Right. It's like new paths are being created. I assume neurons are connecting, right? But feel free to disagree. Maybe that's assuming too much. These disruptions are experienced as a psychedelic trip. So novel brain activity here outside of the regular paths of what we sometimes call default consciousness long term.
00:28:07.014 - 00:28:36.082, Speaker A: Days after drug treatment, brain activity patterns are back within their normal narrow range. But researchers have found persistent small changes that could indicate lasting therapeutic effects. Now, I think that's what happened to McKenna. I think Terrence McKenna, I think that's what happened. I think he did. And again, this is not an endorsement. And McKenna has all sorts of issues, frankly, from, you might say from a scholarly perspective, but also unbelievable scholar at the same time.
00:28:36.082 - 00:29:06.510, Speaker A: So let me just say that too. But his ability with speech, I don't think this is accidental. I don't think he just happened to be very good at speech. I think maybe he had a natural ability and then it was accentuated, is sort of my theory on that. Now, we also foreshadowed this, so we're going to continue to follow that. Super interesting, because I think it's actually quite valuable to us understanding our main machine that helps us understand the world here. It's a model.
00:29:06.510 - 00:29:44.830, Speaker A: It's a very interesting model. Jamie Gurley, who I think is from verseworks, the digital art market will dwarf physical $65,000,000,000.01 day. Small transaction fees, less friction and potential mass appeal make this close to inevitable, in my opinion. I think a lot of people who have collected, such as myself and many of the people who watch this show who make arthem, I agree. It feels like it's a matter of time and it may be 20 years, it may be two months, who knows? We just need the future global superstar artists to get us there. I actually think they're already here.
00:29:44.830 - 00:30:19.240, Speaker A: We just, I don't think we need that. Like, I completely disagree with this part here. I think we already have them. I think it's, I think it's an awareness issue. I think it's an awareness issue. But I mean, maybe, maybe a new artist comes and then all of a sudden it captures everybody's imagination in the public. But, you know, that's a weird question because usually the public doesn't have, you know, generally speaking, the public isn't necessarily the best curator as a, as an entity, I would argue.
00:30:19.240 - 00:30:55.698, Speaker A: So. Yeah, so totally agree with these first two lines though, and very interesting, provocative thought. And I agree. And then you go, what's the next implication of this? Well, what does that mean for those Kappn works we're just looking at? Right? Is all the value going to be in works that are made after now, or are they going to be in like, a lot of the stuff we see on tazos, which is imminently collectible? Again, check out the space we did with tuna, a great collector, his dad collected baseball cards, big baseball card collectors. So Janny Sorta's responding. It's pretty simple. A prominent collector in the space.
00:30:55.698 - 00:31:15.178, Speaker A: It's pretty simple. I own 6000 nfts. Incredible. But I only own 100 to 150 physical pieces. Why? Not enough walls, so can't display the vast majority of my pieces collected. Still quite a, that's a pretty significant physical art collection. Physical art storage is a pain indeed.
00:31:15.178 - 00:31:42.280, Speaker A: And who's got the money or the space to store physical art? Physical art pieces can get damaged, usually in transit, but also in storage. Right. Humidity, you know, you have them in a pile and then stuff gets, you know, shuffled around. Time lag when purchasing, selling and receiving. And it's also, for the artist, it's better. So there's something kind of awesome. And I would also add one more thing, the energy.
00:31:42.280 - 00:32:12.360, Speaker A: It's kind of a new frontier, digital art, I would argue, and I think we're only scratching the surface right now. Let's continue. Artie hands, what sounds the least lame? I think this is actually a great poll because increasingly I am sort of tired just on a personal level of the NFT word. Interestingly, like I, I don't want to talk about nfTs. I want to talk about digital art. Tokenized art. No, be quiet.
00:32:12.360 - 00:32:50.678, Speaker A: So digital art, and I think it's like nobody is talking about physical art as the way we buy it and sell it is like, you know, I don't know, cash register art. I think someone's made this point several months ago. We don't call it cash register art or czech art or whatever the case might be. We call it fine art or oil painting. It's digital art. And that we can work with. And it's not going to, it kind of loses the crypto stigma, which is maybe also to help get us to that $100 billion, you know, mark, for lack of better term asset class size.
00:32:50.678 - 00:33:55.072, Speaker A: So, Artie hands, interesting, interesting post poll. Ed Marolla Gm what is art? Why do we care? Why we care? As much as I feel like I should know, I'm constantly confused. And this is, you know, I think it comes back to this confusion. You know, where I think the source of the confusion is, is exactly how I opened this show, which is we talk of the word art comes out of this idea of techne, which is a technique. So again, and it doesn't have to do with anything poetic, it can be, how do I make this glass? How do you make this table? As we were saying, how do you make a shirt? How do you sew? There's an art to making shoes, etcetera. And somehow over the years, it's kind of developed this other kind of thing, which is what I'd call poetic making. It's a kind of visual poesis, maybe for lack of better terms, kind of still got grouped within art.
00:33:55.072 - 00:34:39.620, Speaker A: Small a art in a sense, we might say poetic making is what we might call capital a art and everything. The general sense of making is what we might call small a art. Some, you know, that's why we have the word fine art, perhaps. Right? So I think this is part of the confusion, is actually, it's a bit of a semantic issue, I would argue. Why do we care? What is art? Right, so kind of a different angle at these issues. And yeah, it's, again, back to tuna, who's been to war, I think a couple of times. A very interesting discussion on why we care.
00:34:39.620 - 00:35:05.120, Speaker A: It's like you come back and it's like, well, what matters? Right? You can be taken out at any time. What matters? And then all of a sudden, tuna's really into art. Well, you know, not a huge jump, as some might think. Let's continue so we can keep this under an hour, hopefully. Very interesting post. Kind of not really a huge fan of this, but we have to note it here. Gore core, how art got a new taste for gruesomeness.
00:35:05.120 - 00:35:47.580, Speaker A: And just an interesting situation here in the zeitgeist. Images of bloodshed and butchery are inescapable in the digital age. I don't know if I'd say they're inescapable, but you do come across them once in a while. As artists increasingly turn to gruesome imagery to portray the pain of the world, Doron Boynes looks at how Gore and art has swung between taboo and trend. And finally, with the recent surge of war footage, true crime podcasts, medical education videos, and dedicated group chats on telegram. I mean, this stuff used to be called smut. Right on, wasn't it? I mean, this stuff used to be illegal.
00:35:47.580 - 00:36:08.222, Speaker A: It is clear that gruesome images have regained prominence in visual culture. So anyway, it's just kind of an interesting development there is. We look objectively at what's going on. And here's a walk set $72 on eBay. And of course, I follow Wok. That is a glitch on x. When you open a million tabs, look at how beautiful this is.
00:36:08.222 - 00:36:34.808, Speaker A: So 72 at $72. Getting more bids on eBay. Brilliantly, Dan control all animals. So here's this beautiful. Look at this beautiful room that Dan Control's work is being shown in. And you go up the stairs. Very playful, isn't it? And you see, I mean, this is a massive show that Dan Control has put on and putting all the animals together.
00:36:34.808 - 00:36:59.684, Speaker A: And there you have the pigeons and everything. Look at how beautiful this is. And this is like in a little, what looks like a tag you'd have at a conference, right? And this could be massive as well. I think there are in this show massive, like 2 meters versions, photo print with a custom made acrylic frame. Interesting. So also from Dan Control. Sold physical twin.
00:36:59.684 - 00:37:15.324, Speaker A: So very nice. So selling work. Very impressive looking chauffeur, dancontrol. Here's bzaya making a blanket. Very fake. Hilariously ordered this amazing bzaya blanket a week ago from buybzaya.com, and it arrived today.
00:37:15.324 - 00:37:27.116, Speaker A: So make it a la creme. A true patron here of the arts, I might grab one too. Joe Rogan's dad. Awesome. Jules. There is value in producing art quickly. It enables you to be topical and of the moment.
00:37:27.116 - 00:37:41.804, Speaker A: So speaking of speed, this is value. There is value in taking your time. It forces you to ensure the message means something beyond the topical. So basically this is. Yeah, so well put. Joules. And there's also value in taking your time.
00:37:41.804 - 00:38:20.258, Speaker A: You can rush out of work right where you go, oh, I wish I hadn't put that out so quickly. So there is value, in a sense, where I am right now, personally on this issue of speed. I love speed. And if I can make it fast, good. But I don't mint it immediately, I take a few days, even a week or two before I think, okay, this is still what I want to put out in this form, or I continue working on it, and then I take another week or two to look at it and whatever. So I think there's value in taking your time, especially once you think it's finished. And then, you know, in revision, so to speak, and deciding, like, is this.
00:38:20.258 - 00:38:39.490, Speaker A: If you're making it quick, is this something I'm happy with? So very interesting. Tooks three weeks now since I quit weed and junk food. Been exercising more and trying to sleep better as well. All good so far. Yeah. And yeah, body first. If you ever have problems in your life, I, or you lose your job, whatever.
00:38:39.490 - 00:39:01.502, Speaker A: What I tell everybody, and I try and follow myself, is body first, like, take care of your body. Are you in shape? Right? Go to classes at the gym where they tell you what to do if you've never done that. Or if you never go to the gym and you feel no motivation, go to classes where they tell you what to do. There are a ton these days. And they're. And they're great and very impressive. And they're social too.
00:39:01.502 - 00:39:13.890, Speaker A: So this is awesome. Tuks. And that's great. You know, I don't have time for this sort of thing and anymore. And junk food. Yeah, like, it's just. That's great.
00:39:13.890 - 00:39:30.646, Speaker A: Strange thing, my household has been hit with another Covid strain. Third this year. This is insane. Since Monday. While not as bad as the last for myself, I will be less active here for a while. Need to look after family members. So shout out to strange thing, what a tough year.
00:39:30.646 - 00:39:54.362, Speaker A: Strange thing has had in regard to Covid. I mean, terrible. Three times. Wojak w 74 eth and of course I follow wojak used. Look at this. So this is using Heather Santiago pleasement. This is using a santiago as an input, a stir algo and over painting and grid manipulation with Santi's painting as an input.
00:39:54.362 - 00:40:11.270, Speaker A: And we're going to see a few of these paintings. Partner in crime, a stolen painting from NFT Uruguay. Look at how cool this is. So taking a Santiago and turning it into this space. I mean, I'm kind of back to the power of AI again. This is using AI as a tool, I assume. This is AI stir algo.
00:40:11.270 - 00:40:34.160, Speaker A: You know, painting as an input. Maybe it's something else, but pretty impressive remix here with Santiago anis Abdin. 200 animations. Congratulations to Annis Abdin. That is a huge landmark. Huge. So putting out a work a day for the last 200 days, known origin shuts down.
00:40:34.160 - 00:41:16.414, Speaker A: After careful consideration and evaluation, we can confirm known origin will continue to wind down its on chain marketplaces and minter and signpost to secondary marketplaces over the upcoming weeks. It was interesting. Like when I discovered known origin, like many people in 2020, 2021, it never really took, did it? And I guess ebay picked it up and yeah, I mean, it's a tough scene, so who knows? Some people are sad about it. So it is what it is. Here's Victor Acevedo. Acevedo. As Victor put on the last or help me with his name in our last spaces.
00:41:16.414 - 00:41:49.362, Speaker A: He's going to be on object.com on a space and with a art historian, artist, writer and art historian, Zvofi Vali Nagy, PhD. So very cool. And these were just minted. So Victor just minted these works on tazos. So again, what we might say works from the first generation, I think actually this just came out. But an artist, you might say, from the first generation of digital art, we might say.
00:41:49.362 - 00:42:03.366, Speaker A: So it seems perhaps Photoshop, maybe other things involved. Also maybe some 3d. So interesting work here. Let's continue. There's another one. This one's from 2002. Again, kind of, you could see the.
00:42:03.366 - 00:42:27.520, Speaker A: Perhaps a Photoshop influence. Check out the space. We discuss all sorts of things. And also this is an edition of ten not listed yet. This is from 2000, a geometrical period. And of course, and there's a portrait of Victor's friend, and of course, Buckminster Fuller. And the geodesic domes, I think, are incorporated into this work, which Victor was influenced by.
00:42:27.520 - 00:42:52.460, Speaker A: Okay, so let's go machine. Machine. Speaking of natural talents, speaking of natural talents, here's machine doing a collage. You know what I think it is? It's just this courage to just go in a completely different direction. I feel like we saw the same thing with the italian boots as boots. Kind of like when you see it, it's obvious, but I haven't seen anybody do that before. I'm sure somebody has.
00:42:52.460 - 00:43:27.604, Speaker A: I see the same thing here. Just a kind of whimsicality, so to speak, of this horse moving along with these jewels falling from the horse. And beautiful kind of legs here with high heels. Just a really interesting, a very elegant horse, as the title says, selling out at ten tezos, each edition of twelve. Beautiful work. Very interesting digital collage with Louis Vuitton legs and diamonds by Masha Hafner. So now is this by Masha Hafner.
00:43:27.604 - 00:43:50.144, Speaker A: So not exactly sure if this is a homage or not. Here is this sold for 0.05, which is not bad these days, but $150, let's call it $170. Uri J. With a very oddly kind of shaped work for often for the digital world. Very horizontal. Beautiful.
00:43:50.144 - 00:44:11.806, Speaker A: I'm glad works like this are selling. You can be bullish on this scene and all sorts of interesting things going on there. Selling to Kobe SEO and here, and this is the largest I have on it. So just quickly, quickly see if we can get a larger version. Here we go. So just to see what's going on here. So again, beautiful, beautiful.
00:44:11.806 - 00:44:48.180, Speaker A: Yuri jay work, almost like a figure there. And very interesting piece here. Almost like a summer like sort of situation here is ratcloak out of Ukraine boots. So doing another beautiful, what looks like a Photoshop painting. Playing again with a couple of different brushes here. At least it looks like we have, again, kind of like an oil stick going on here. Well, as just more kind of like typical physical brushes.
00:44:48.180 - 00:45:30.356, Speaker A: Shall we say? And again, doing this technique where you kind of mix in a bit of color, kind of a fairly, I won't call it too popular, but it is a modern day technique of painting where you add just a bit of color just to make it interesting. You could argue even here, all this beautiful mark making beautiful. And here are the boots, kind of van Gogh echo here. And this figure, this haunting figure here underneath, very haunted works. And what's going on here again, this is on object edition of one selling for 200 tezos to Roerich, another patron, keeping this scene going. These patrons really. Uxine acting on Vrba, making 0.3
00:45:30.356 - 00:45:46.556, Speaker A: eth 33 minted. And let's take a look here. Kind of a different color scheme for Uksine, isn't it? Let's maybe see. It's video, so I can't expand it anymore. Look at this. These arms, almost kind of, I want to say almost escher. Like, maybe that's not the right way.
00:45:46.556 - 00:46:17.210, Speaker A: The mushrooms, that awesome snake we saw the other day, almost kind of trading card esque. And here, red and oranges, kind of unusual. Almost like this grim reaper type figure here. And this really cool, interestingly colored halo with a big, you know, and then echoed with this circle here. A complicated image. Acta nonverba. So maybe act, don't speak, perhaps.
00:46:17.210 - 00:46:51.428, Speaker A: Interesting piece by uxine here is Ed Marolla. And I don't think we looked at this true story. So interesting title. And you see all these awesome textures here. Again, should this become like a hundred billion dollar market? I mean, you have to ask yourself, you know, where is that hundred billion dollars of value gonna be? Surely a lot of that is going to be following. A lot of these artists are going to be. It's going to be contained in a lot of the works of this artist, of these artists.
00:46:51.428 - 00:47:16.506, Speaker A: So just more interesting. Look at this again. We're kind of back to this impressionistic, you know, what works for the image, not worrying is, you know, these are the kinds of things that artists face. It's like, should I do every row or should I just put an impression, like the impressionist might, of the keyboard? We're kind of back to the keyboard here. It's a great illustration. So it's an interesting question. And look at this.
00:47:16.506 - 00:47:37.100, Speaker A: This echo putting the whole work inside here. So almost like an image in an image. An infinite regress here. When you look close, Ed Morolla. Fascinating, fascinating, fascinating. Bzaya, la meza de los grandes bazaya out of Argentina. This on super rare and here it is, a new work here.
00:47:37.100 - 00:47:58.422, Speaker A: Interesting composition. Kind of like a picnic here, seemingly. And there's a soccer ball and everything. Interesting way that the. Maybe the wine here is showed forward and or the here, you know, the objects on the table, you see forward. Interesting space. Let's put it that way.
00:47:58.422 - 00:48:10.334, Speaker A: But the barbecue seems to be from above. Interesting piece. Bezaya, I believe makes it all on the phone, amazingly so. Very cool. Great artist. Miss that piece. That is beautiful.
00:48:10.334 - 00:48:26.854, Speaker A: Or that piece. So bezaya keeping on going there. And here is an interesting one from nearbound at the end of the day. This is an interesting digital painting here. Someone on the bus maybe after a long work day. Interesting digital painting. Here's another one by Josh.
00:48:26.854 - 00:48:54.022, Speaker A: Great watcher of the show here. Big supporter of the show. And here, just another work. I wonder, I assume this is procreate. Interesting piece, though, isn't it? Kind of looks like an indoor interior here, an exterior here. But is it a video game? Very interesting. Kind of using video game UI to analyze life, saying, hey, let's go for a drive here, you know? Interesting.
00:48:54.022 - 00:49:13.740, Speaker A: Very interesting. And here is myth with a work, a mysterious work on Zora. Look at this. So just putting the myth head on a figure here. So it looks like appropriated. And so interesting piece here from myth formented so far, Miss season two. Very interesting.
00:49:13.740 - 00:49:29.756, Speaker A: And here also out of Argentina. Myth. And here, I believe enough. 1914 out of Argentina. Look how beautiful this is the color of these gradient teddy bears. And almost this very fun kind of big mushroom house and birds. Beautiful.
00:49:29.756 - 00:49:46.702, Speaker A: Beautiful here, this is 25 tazo, still available edition of one from Nov. 1914. Below that. So another soccer work. I got the other one. Or I got another soccer work. So here, as you can see, playing soccer here.
00:49:46.702 - 00:50:14.640, Speaker A: Look@that.net. awesome. Reminiscent of the abstracts, right? Reminiscent of NUV 19. Fourteen's abstracts. Very interesting. Also available here is kujeb, also known as hastrubal waffle, with a few more works here. And we see almost like a bit of a copy and paste of the eye here as we see, kind of dragged through, almost like a Martin Joe, not Martin Joe, Martin Bruce.
00:50:14.640 - 00:50:57.834, Speaker A: Almost a Martin Bruce kind of vibe here in the cool kind of mickey hand and beautiful sky, these beautiful, which seems to be uniform across the series here, we see another slightly different clouds, but slightly different kind of rendering, we might say, of the clouds here. Sync 16. And here, another work here, almost with a cat face, cat mask and some butter on, you know, or is that Kleenex on the head? So very interesting. Again, this kind of looks like it's copy and pasted from another software, but not sure. Again, 98% Nintendo 64. And here's sync 15. And these awesome tears, which I feel like we saw before.
00:50:57.834 - 00:51:17.050, Speaker A: And also the text coming from another software. I try to work and I keep thinking of World War three. Don't we all? I actually have a work on. What I'm working on right now is another. Finally, a new piece for the secret history of World War three. I gotta, gotta finish that series before world War three ends. But.
00:51:17.050 - 00:51:34.320, Speaker A: But we should only be so lucky. RJ, homesick here. So mysterious works from RJ here. And so, kind of looks like AI, kind of looks like it has been bitmapped, but I don't know. Mysterious. That's why I say mysterious. Homestick two.
00:51:34.320 - 00:51:54.826, Speaker A: Here's homestick one. And you even have like a black kind of, as you see here. See the black margin here and then above again, it's tempting to think this is AI, but I don't know, it may not be. Maybe it's just an image. So. And homesick three. I think there's two, one and three.
00:51:54.826 - 00:52:10.930, Speaker A: Exactly. One, two, and three. Five tezos each. Interesting, kind of old, kind of green monitor colors. Almost like a game boy type rendering type palette. Right. Original Game Boy here is brain dead with a new one.
00:52:10.930 - 00:52:34.690, Speaker A: Love the title here. Image source Tezos mech logo. Oh, so they're making, they're trying to make a new tezos logo. I wonder how the Tezos people feel about that. So here is a. Maybe they're all for it, who knows? So here with some just nice gradient here in the background. And here's the Tezos logo, the T and the Z made by the artists.
00:52:34.690 - 00:52:57.640, Speaker A: So this is ten tezos edition of ten. And interesting piece here by Koda Nakazono. Quite a different work. So some all across the board, like these two kinda, you know, construction cones and these huge pixels dancing across. I like the new direction. Like, I think it's super interesting. Even this, I'm not sure it's a white.
00:52:57.640 - 00:53:17.346, Speaker A: It looks like a gray, actually, in the background. Clientworks zero zero three. Interesting edition of one sold for ten tezos. Here is that pinball guy with an interesting piece, as you see. Almost like this digital rain here. Kind of an asciI sky with clouds. Interesting color scheme and interesting animation.
00:53:17.346 - 00:53:55.948, Speaker A: Interestingly, three tezos edition of ten almost sold out. Elna Frederick with dvd logos. Hilariously so. Another kind of retro tip of the hat to the retro here is vozo ikebana arranging flowers or making flowers alive, fun, happy music. Sold. Sold for 30 tazos. So very cool.
00:53:55.948 - 00:54:09.288, Speaker A: Zozo continues to do very well. Look at this. This is Murakit. So we looked at a lot of murakit. Remember the effects on effects theory and all this, like the anime that's very pixelated and everything. Look at this one again. Pretty radical work.
00:54:09.288 - 00:54:23.080, Speaker A: Kind of looks like hyper processed, like manga or anime. GM mirror kit, NFT. And here's sui soichi. Brainwet is updated. So I think we saw an earlier version of this. So here we have a very jittery version. 0.03
00:54:23.080 - 00:54:54.300, Speaker A: eth open edition, never ending, interestingly. So wild artist here. And a beautiful work on sealed art, which I'm not super familiar with here. And look how beautiful this is. Again, just, you know, what seems to be kind of, you know, just hyper textured digital art piece here. Very interesting. Again, kind of like mirror kit using these kind of line drawings or cartoon style comic images and then hyper processing them in a digital way.
00:54:54.300 - 00:55:09.532, Speaker A: Here's Tornado Rodriguez. Chill wave. Awesome title. And here it is, kind of at the playground here with a huge octopus here, 200 everything. Interesting color scheme. Beautiful on Zora. Let's just see.
00:55:09.532 - 00:55:26.394, Speaker A: 22 minted so far. 72 days to go. Very cool. Tornado Rodriguez on Zora. And here is Flora Marquez. So excited to be featured in the Flora culture art exhibition. And not exactly where is this? This is on foundation, so it looks like a pretty cool show, actually.
00:55:26.394 - 00:55:45.098, Speaker A: And just a gorgeous work here. Look at this drawing. Look at this digital drawing. And even the water, just what looks like the equivalent of a digital pen and ink. A beautiful, beautiful drawing. Incredible. Here is Morlakos with a pretty interesting.
00:55:45.098 - 00:56:03.280, Speaker A: It looks like a pepe there. I assume this is a pastiche. Not sure from where. Has a bit of a medieval feel to it, doesn't it? So murlacos, who, of course, I follow. Los morlacos. Beautiful drawing here. Digital drawing here is turkarak with intermittent sleep.
00:56:03.280 - 00:56:27.596, Speaker A: Interesting work here. Woman at a cafe. Kind of passing out a little bit with a beer. Just more interesting work from Turkarak. Dollar 25 on primary here is Santiago ruao playing with the color a little bit with this blue background and pinkenhouse, uh, pink. Kind of worm like, uh, figures here. Or shapes.
00:56:27.596 - 00:56:46.240, Speaker A: Very cool. That's on Zora. Daniel W. It's kind of an eye in the pyramid superego pun pantocretur, if I am pronouncing that right. So just an interesting illustrated gif. That is an edition of one now and now available for 1400 Dazos. So not cheap.
00:56:46.240 - 00:57:02.800, Speaker A: Uh, here is Kuro with a couple of. With a couple of awesome glitch roms. Look at how beautiful this is. Got those horizontal pixels again. Just awesome. Textures again. I feel like we're just scratching the surface here of digital art.
00:57:02.800 - 00:57:15.712, Speaker A: I think there is so much territory to mine. I see it when I'm making work. Like there's so many different directions you can go. This is awesome. Here's another one. Just beAutiful. And look at how nice and minimal this is.
00:57:15.712 - 00:57:28.594, Speaker A: And look at underneath here. It feels like a golden age to a certain degree. Here, nice and cheap. Place a bid at very low PrIce. There flow two. This is by Silva Santus. Look at this.
00:57:28.594 - 00:57:49.478, Speaker A: So playing with the whole glitch Rom motif or technique and going very vertical here. Kind of the opposite of the yuri j we saw before. Very interesting. Life force on nes. And here is Quetzalgo. This. Let's see if stop wars.
00:57:49.478 - 00:58:06.854, Speaker A: And then here we see this classic retro tv background that many of us know from our youth. Quetzal Lego. Quetzal. Quetzalgo here. Here you go. Quetzal galo. So interesting.
00:58:06.854 - 00:58:30.752, Speaker A: 29 minted so far, so doing quite well. Here's somfe on instagram. Interesting, right? Different renditions. Very cool. And look at this gorgeous work by Renki. These are getting more epic, aren't they? I feel like they're getting just a hint more complex. We've been looking at Renki's work for at least a year, almost every show.
00:58:30.752 - 00:58:48.266, Speaker A: And here, this one feels like they're starting to get a little bit more complex here. And I like it. I really like it. Joyo edition of one not listed as per usual. Here's Klaus composition 244. Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous. Look at these colors.
00:58:48.266 - 00:59:04.450, Speaker A: And this is 21 tezos sold. Continues to sell. Most wrong king every day. Just an interesting piece on x here. Very interesting. And we've seen work from them before. And of course, this is aile with a couple of works here.
00:59:04.450 - 00:59:38.014, Speaker A: Variations too, by aile. This looks like AI painting. Mark making. Very beautiful. And here's some more variations. So just beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. The potential, I mean, this is the thing what happens when the mark making starts to be more beautiful than on in real life? I mean, we're approaching that point, I would argue, which is quite something or where it's like way easier just to get beautiful mark making from AI than struggling.
00:59:38.014 - 01:00:02.678, Speaker A: Here's just more texture. White solitude in collaboration with AI. So again, I assume this is AI. These brush work, it's getting harder to tell, though, which is interesting to our earlier discussion. Look at this. Like, the brush marks are getting better and better and better, aren't they? Look at that. I mean, and all the little noise and random specs and everything.
01:00:02.678 - 01:00:16.964, Speaker A: Very impressive. By white solitude here is negative AI paws. Just a beautiful work here. Another AI artwork. And beautiful hands and the different colors of the skin. Beautiful. And the colors.
01:00:16.964 - 01:00:34.430, Speaker A: I mean, it's very vibrant. And here is Mo Wellington, as we are in the AI section now. Kind of feeling like. Almost like a Renoir here in its composition and feeling GM and cool. Kind of full of food on the table there. Very interesting piece of. Here's kanik zapata.
01:00:34.430 - 01:00:59.026, Speaker A: Stable diffusion output made with prompting changes. So another interesting experimental piece from kanik zapata. A few computers here. Kind of sketchbook style, looking in terms of its compositional style. Here we have a few works by Santiago, which I will move through kind of quickly here. But just to give you a taste of what people are making with AI right now. Look at that.
01:00:59.026 - 01:01:30.518, Speaker A: Quite consistent, Santiago, like the series here. And these are just continue to stun me. I think these are gorgeous. Like, I think if these were made physical, even, like, painted, you could be like, to me, this is something that could show up in a gagosian or, like a blue chip gallery. These kinds of works, this kind of almost like big anime. Kind of feels like Murakami a little bit, right? Maybe that's why I feel that it could be an. But they actually feel like they have more vitality as images, I would argue.
01:01:30.518 - 01:01:44.770, Speaker A: Or maybe they're similar. I haven't looked at Murakami for a while, if that's even the name. No hygiene. Interesting experimental AI, abstract from no hygiene. And this is Mo p. Wellington. Again, la fere.
01:01:44.770 - 01:02:07.162, Speaker A: Beautiful, painterly work of ballerinas. And here is true face again. I mean, astonishing work here. Kind of looks reminiscent of Michelangelo's last judgment, but it's its own thing, humanity. A series of individual destinies. And here it is, 0.01 eth, and, of course, true face.
01:02:07.162 - 01:02:23.278, Speaker A: Pablo Radici, making their own algorithms. AI algorithms. Here is af. I think it's Alex Akf, kinga fekete, jet setters. Three kind of a lot of figures in this one, too. A very cool piece. Wish we had it larger.
01:02:23.278 - 01:02:42.942, Speaker A: This on Instagram out here in Berlin. And here, Olivera Durdevic. How lovely. So again, I think there's some AI in here as well. Kind of look like mouse, almost France. And bacon like mouse. And here is Ferrari by wok, which is auctioned off for 1.15
01:02:42.942 - 01:03:12.340, Speaker A: eth beautiful work here, isn't it? This is from way back, I think in 2018 2018, that walk made this. So the master at work here. Copyright 2018 very cool. And Requiem de la Nuez Canny. So it looks like here, not exactly sure where this is from, but interesting. I always love like paintings of the tv screens, so to speak, paintings of the news. Very interesting work here.
01:03:12.340 - 01:03:31.406, Speaker A: I love the distortions, you know. Here's David Hales. Still needs a title, watercolor and ink, so brand new one from David Hales. Beautiful watercolor here. Super talented artist on Instagram I've been following for years. Filippo Francocci GM Friends cosmic scream oil on wood. Pretty nice abstract here.
01:03:31.406 - 01:03:56.056, Speaker A: Pretty interesting abstract. Kind of looks like it uses randomness, and then it's kind of, you start with randomness maybe, and then it's kind of tightened up. That is my theory on that one. Gregoria Zanardi available conditioned freedom. So a work available on foundation two, it looks, is this a physical or not? Hard to say. I put it in the physicals. I thought it was a physical, but I'm actually not sure.
01:03:56.056 - 01:04:09.860, Speaker A: I think it's digital, actually. This is a digital painting. We could have put it up front there. Look at this. I found this super interesting down here. So interesting piece. And Galena Nicotina, who I'm sure I follow here.
01:04:09.860 - 01:04:30.620, Speaker A: So a new work here, new physical artwork rendered as NFT. And look at this beautiful brushwork here. Very nice. And finally, nugget Brain, who we're looking at yesterday in the video. Look at how beautiful this is. Nugget brain makes beautiful, beautiful paintings. Just adds some texture and makes it look so easy.
01:04:30.620 - 01:04:38.330, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you for joining me again. I hope you have a wonderful weekend. Thanks again for the support. And until next time, take care.
