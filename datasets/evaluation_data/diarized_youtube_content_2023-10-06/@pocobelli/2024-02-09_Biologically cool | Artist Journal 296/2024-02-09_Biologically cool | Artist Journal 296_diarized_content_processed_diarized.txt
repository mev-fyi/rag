00:00:03.840 - 00:00:33.886, Speaker A: I wonder about my neighbors. Who's this guy screaming every morning into his microphone that I keep hearing through the floor? Anyway, welcome back, everybody. It is a beautiful day today inside, at least in the happy birthday of the mind. I was thinking to myself as I guzzled my third cup of coffee, welcome back. Artist Journal, February 9, 2024. Broadcasting to the world from the inner half of the nervous system on a beautiful sunny day. Inside, cloudy outside in Berlin, Germany.
00:00:33.886 - 00:01:12.544, Speaker A: My name is Adrian Pokebelli, and before I say anything, let me just, like, just say what a huge thank you. The over for me, you know, overwhelming and just amazing response. We got there. I got there on the, on the birthday. That was quite, that was something I've never experienced quite like that. So just a big heartfelt thank you to everybody who, with good wishes and even if you just thought about it, thank you. Thank you for all the good vibes and everything.
00:01:12.544 - 00:01:34.126, Speaker A: We're going to take a look at some of those works actually that were done, but let's start with Zozo. This is a massive show today. This is probably one of the longest accumulations. I woke up sort of late because I had a little bit of red wine there, celebrating the birthday. Went to an italian restaurant. It was a lot of fun. Had a delicious pasta and some pizza there, too.
00:01:34.126 - 00:02:12.158, Speaker A: It was delicious. All to say a little bit of a late start, but what a huge amount of work. And I was thinking to myself, there's a work here by wasteman Goldmeinovich called Nostra Kazza. And I was playing, so I was like, oh, that's our house. And then I was like, oh, it's like that song. I was starting to think to myself, listening to madness, our house, as I was working on putting all these tabs together, and I was thinking to myself, like, this is, with the music going, like, I thought to myself, this is rock and roll. Like, this is, this is rock and roll.
00:02:12.158 - 00:02:43.996, Speaker A: And I think, let's see what you think. I'm just relaying earlier thoughts. So with that all being said, there are an enormous amount of tabs here. And again, just a huge heartfelt thank you from over here, from deep, deep in inner space here. I was thinking to myself, I was talking about between the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex, but it is the pituitary gland, isn't it, where the seat of consciousness is thought to be. So maybe for a future intro there. Anyways, let's get going here.
00:02:43.996 - 00:03:24.144, Speaker A: This is Zozo, the great Zozo. And let me get the volume here. And again, there were so many works that could have been chosen. I just went with what felt like a cool Friday vibe over here. It's almost like art therapy, engaging and just, you know, being with Zozo's work. And this is another one of those works with the beautiful palm trees, the beautiful sound, the crickets. So it just felt like this one just felt like Friday.
00:03:24.144 - 00:03:49.648, Speaker A: So here we are. Just a gorgeous, gorgeous work. And look at the title, too. Come on, I know the spot. You know, just kind of capturing that almost as if you're like a teenager at camp and a friend of yours is sort of like, come on over here. I know a spot. And that is almost like the sound that we're getting from the synthetic.
00:03:49.648 - 00:04:34.534, Speaker A: And almost this evocation of iconography here in Zozo's beautiful kind of gradient, large block style. Here you do think of NUV 1914, you do think Ugo, you do think of all these different. But this is totally Zuozo. And look at this, the beautiful candle there. So just a beautiful, beautiful start, minted on yesterday edition of 23 tezos, each gorgeous, gorgeous work to add to Zuozo's incredible output. We'll look very, very quickly here. Just an incredible artist.
00:04:34.534 - 00:04:48.124, Speaker A: Here's that other work we were looking at with the palm trees. I don't know if we saw this one. Layered water. I think we did. What a title. And I don't think there's any volume on this one. Yeah, layered water.
00:04:48.124 - 00:05:28.450, Speaker A: So again, kind of making it deceptively, I'd almost say deceptively accessible and friendly to a certain degree, although I'm not sure it is, because the first time I encountered Zozo's work, I didn't know what to make of it, to be perfectly honest. And it was one of those kind of like Nuv 1914. It was a slow burn. It was like Martin Bruce's work. It was like Hasdrubal waffle. Some of the most kind of, you argue, some of the most celebrated artists on the show. It was hard to understand at first, but just like your favorite albums, sometimes those are the artists that really resonate with you in the long run.
00:05:28.450 - 00:05:50.958, Speaker A: Like I like to say, you know, sometimes after taking a vacation, you come back and it's like Nev 19 fourteen's work. All of the deliciousness of the, you know, the little outrageousnesses that occur there. Anyway, let's not go too far here. Let's continue. Rannix dear, on digital art. So we had a fabulous show. Look at how many people have listened.
00:05:50.958 - 00:06:11.330, Speaker A: 602. That is amazing. That is like, you know, that is one of the highest. Listen to spaces that we've had. And it's awesome if we're going to look at a couple of works by Ranix here. So big shout out and thank you. Rannik Steer from Beirut.
00:06:11.330 - 00:06:38.054, Speaker A: But now in Turkey, a super interesting artist. We had a great conversation. Runetun came back and maybe I was just thinking out loud to myself, maybe because Runtoon had a lot to say about his trip to Asia. Maybe we start an hour early. I'm going to see if Rune Toon wants to start an hour early next week. And next week we have. We have Kaylo, we have Kalo from Kalo's newsletter.
00:06:38.054 - 00:06:55.606, Speaker A: And I did actually an interview on Monday with Calo. And so that'll be awesome. That should be out in a couple of weeks. And then. So on this Wednesday, though, I believe it's calo coming up. So that should be awesome. Maybe we start an hour early, though, and we do Rune tune for an hour and then the regular kind of, you know, setting.
00:06:55.606 - 00:07:24.366, Speaker A: But anyway, I'll talk to Rune tune, as you might be if you saw last show, you might recognize all these works. How cool is this? I assume a kind of birthday. Happy birthday. From object of sorts. It appears to be the curation from the previous show. And, you know, I thought to myself, like, this looks great. I would think that, you know, having liked all these artworks enough to, you know, make a video about them.
00:07:24.366 - 00:07:55.814, Speaker A: But look at how great this looks. So just very exciting and thank you to object. A humbling experience here and just kind of thrilling to see this. There's walk and just, you know, you can kind of imagine what this might look like in your head. There's Violet, there's retro Manny. You could imagine what this looks like in your head, but there's nothing like actually seeing it, you know, look at how great this is, so. And that brilliant, brilliant work by Renki, you know, again, the product of being prolific.
00:07:55.814 - 00:08:25.314, Speaker A: So I'll just say just another thank you. And we got a few more thank yous, actually, to deliver here. So just looking awesome there. And big thank you to uxine. Getting things going there on the birthday with this awesome craftwork cover. I'm gonna have to make sure I bookmark and actually save all these for the collection because this is awesome, you know, and done in x scenes, you know, like doing the almost one bit style here. And then there we are.
00:08:25.314 - 00:08:53.854, Speaker A: Instead of craftwork, pokeball, cursed computer world, very famous cover there. That axeen is pastiching. Thank you, oxine. And thank you for the birthday wishes from Mikey de la creme with his awesome work here that was previously published. But thank you for the wishes and Yuri J with a hat tip here to artist journal. Happy birthday. Looking like using Zora's canvas, I think.
00:08:53.854 - 00:09:12.494, Speaker A: I do believe so. Totally awesome. And also, thanks to Ilay, the summer of the mind AI. And I'll show you, I'm going to show you the COVID that I did for the mix. These are way better. These are awesome. So again, summer the mind AI times Ilay.
00:09:12.494 - 00:09:44.694, Speaker A: Look at how good this looks. There's something about palm trees, isn't there? Like, on a irrational, emotional level. Like, there's something you almost, like, on a biological level, palm trees are just a particularly cool. They're like, biologically cool. One could argue on this Friday afternoon, you know, like, this was, you know that mix I made with a friend of mine, Ryan Lockwood. Big shout out to in Calgary. Now, Calgary, Canada.
00:09:44.694 - 00:10:30.094, Speaker A: We made this, I think, when I was in Montreal, maybe in like 2006, 2007, something like that. So that was my original kind of Internet pastiche. Well, not a pastiche, I guess. It was a collage. This was probably a diagram that I removed most of the head here, and then there was a sun, summer of the mind mix, and then a little bit of hieroglyphs in the background there. So that was the COVID But I think Ilays is like, this would work on Spotify, wouldn't it? Now, of course, these mixes, you can't. Good thing I downloaded them because Soundcloud, at a certain point, just got rid of all music at some point, about probably seven or eight years ago.
00:10:30.094 - 00:10:42.434, Speaker A: So luckily I had copies. So those are on Google Drive. Maybe I will share them, actually, at some point here. And also, this was minted and sent to me by aylay. Thank you. I remember this work. And so I guess it hadn't been minted.
00:10:42.434 - 00:12:00.636, Speaker A: So just another beautiful addition to this kind of collection, this gallery, in my mind, of these works, it is humbling, and I just. Again, and it's a beautiful work, by the way. There's something to be said for just, you know, for things not being perfect, right? Like, if this was a super real. Like, it's almost like there's a weird dichotomy or paradox where the more realistic you try and make something, then the higher the judgment is, the higher the bar is as to how perfect it is and to kind of reframe that or restate that. It's like if you're doing one of the torture, torturous things of doing realistic painting is you can get there like 97%, but if there's 3% that looks off, it kind of doesn't work. So when, you know, this is maybe drawn with a mouse or maybe with a hand, probably with a mouse, I'm assuming it kind of looks like with a mouse, doesn't it? But all this kind of like, you know, leaving things open here, this looseness, you know, in the hair and then the books and then not worrying about finishing or at least, you know, just leaving the other parts of the shelf empty. This kind of.
00:12:00.636 - 00:12:14.764, Speaker A: It's beautiful. There's, there's a lesson here is I guess what I'm trying to say. So thank you, deepaint pokebelly. I love it, I love it, I love it. Thank you, Aylay. And thank you, Skomra. This was a moving work for me as well.
00:12:14.764 - 00:12:54.302, Speaker A: This is just a beautiful portrait here and kind of almost looking weirdly and shout out to mom, weirdly and mom through the airwaves kind of looks like my dad, you know, like those old pictures of my dad, which is kind of interesting. So another just awesome addition. And I love the frame and love just kind of the distortions here, like the fuzzy distortions here and there's even the eye, you know, there's like a twinkle in the eye. So just awesome. Thank you. And shout out to rural idol who was searching pataphysics articles and found this one. Towards a real pataphysics, I think.
00:12:54.302 - 00:13:35.340, Speaker A: So thanks for just tagging me and Im glad you found that. I think I need to work on the consciousness part of that essay, but overall, the thesis still stands in there towards a real pataphysics. So anyway, thank you for that and thank you for the gifts on this extended opening here. Thank you for the patience as we go through all this. But thank you all these people. Ernesto, and thank you for sending me the working class there. And Martin Joe, Littlecakes, Rannix, Deer and Kiro Dan, Anthony getting one of those great dogs, of course, Ilay.
00:13:35.340 - 00:13:50.668, Speaker A: And a gift of errata. And this was from Kaz Crypto or sorry. A, E, I, o, U. I think it was. So thanks for the Ratta work. An interactive ratta work, perhaps. So.
00:13:50.668 - 00:14:10.236, Speaker A: Huge piece, actually. First interactive adventure, January 11, 2024. Yeah, I kind of missed a lot of that for some reason. Anyway, we'll have to take another look at what rad is working on there. Anyways, let's continue here. Comments on last show we heard from Lorna Mills, which is awesome. It is a hashtag.
00:14:10.236 - 00:14:24.104, Speaker A: So thank you Lorna Mills. And thank you score for the birthday wishes in PP Universal. Great to hear from you both. So this is a hashtag, as far as I understand. Lorna Mills there. So pretty hilarious. Great to hear from you.
00:14:24.104 - 00:14:57.970, Speaker A: And also comments on Twitter l'enquisitel. Thank you for the birthday wishes. Little cakes got on the exercise bike after saying you came back from the gym. Like, it's funny and I laugh too, but it's for real. Like, I haven't gone to the gym this morning again. Kind of a late wake up here, but it's for real what it does to your brain. And you know why I like, and it's kind of obvious we kind of all know this, but because I do this like almost hour and a half show recently, we'll see where it goes, you know, in future episodes.
00:14:57.970 - 00:15:20.518, Speaker A: But for now it's been like an hour and a half. I can totally tell the difference when I go to the gym before and when I don't, my brain seems to be working twice as well, which is quite interesting, you know, like, so I kind of see it in this kind of like experimental trial and error sort of way by accident. Anyway, thanks. Thanks. An interesting comment. King Joffrey, happy birthday. Thank you for everything you do.
00:15:20.518 - 00:15:48.554, Speaker A: You are a gentleman and a scholar. Thank you King Joffre. Ballet tati thank you for the wishes. Ray K's thank you for the wishes. And little cake's talking about her exquisite corpse. What I meant by exquisite corpse was that after the first prompt, two video, I looked at the output and next prompt to extend it would be on a detail that maybe I wouldn't want but AI created, then repeated a few more times to keep extending. So kind of like, as far as I understand it, kind of like a prompting.
00:15:48.554 - 00:16:07.572, Speaker A: A prompting exquisite corpse. And yeah, I assume others do that regularly, but I was struggling with getting the movement I wanted, so I purposely went with the flow with that one. I wanted to keep the input, images, characters intact, but now I'm inching towards being able to let go more. Also, happy birthday. Thank you then, Lizzie. Thank you. Pokebelly.
00:16:07.572 - 00:16:23.502, Speaker A: Always great feedback and glad to hear you found yeah. Oh so thin. Lizzy. Wow, it's changing every day here. This is waffles Kujib Sharo. Hilarious. Glad you found semicolon Weismann Goldman, thanks for illuminating the prolificness debate.
00:16:23.502 - 00:16:50.954, Speaker A: And that title, of course, prolificness is a virtue, came from wasteman's comment there. So thank you, Weisman, for the contribution to the conversation. Pushing it forward, helping push it forward. Kels, great to hear from you. And human boy, always love the discussion on being prolific as a new artist. Maybe one day my outlook will change, and perhaps the amount I release could worry my collectors, considering I don't sell a lot of. But I want to get out what I can while I can.
00:16:50.954 - 00:17:22.374, Speaker A: Exactly, because really, we really don't know. You know, it's easy to take for granted when you're being productive, and then you go, oh, yeah, maybe I'll take a break and, no, no, no. Like, I'm completely in agreement with you, human boy. Get out what you can while you can, as the Pythagoreans say, it say, because you never know when the ship is leaving. Okay? And so totally in agreement with you there. Futura drops. Who did the drop with? Lorna Mills.
00:17:22.374 - 00:17:47.350, Speaker A: Great to hear from you. Thanks for featuring our collab with Lorna Mills on Solana there and Indy, happy birthday. Thank you, Seba, great to hear from you. Lily illo. We were looking at the glass there and here. Lily showed the Boite en valise here, which is a very interesting Duchamp here, which is basically a briefcase with all of Duchamp's work in it. It's a later work.
00:17:47.350 - 00:18:14.680, Speaker A: The collection holds the Boite valise from 1961, a miniature box of 68 miniature replicas, which has a tiny version of the bride strip bear by her bachelor's even, which is also known as the glass. I always squint into the glass to see the details, and it reminds me of being a child with a dollhouse. Thank you for connecting this with my work. So very cool there. And finally, we'll just kind of run through the rest of the comments here. Recollapse. Thank you for showing my work.
00:18:14.680 - 00:18:34.924, Speaker A: Yeah, that was a brilliant work, and I think we have another one today. Joe Howell, great to hear from you. And Dan Kelly as well. Thank you for the gift. Awesome. And cure and vtech and freeman, brain dead, no hygiene. Talking about the pixel issue in the AI lepro chant and secret escape.
00:18:34.924 - 00:19:16.710, Speaker A: The AI smoothly connects the squares when upscaling, which I don't really prefer, but I'm upscaling because I might want to print it physically in the future. Yeah, and there are different ways to upscale, as far as I understand, like, some people, as far as I understand, use stable diffusion, because you'll see some AI artists, like, you, can zoom in super close, and they'll have that kind of figured out. So I don't know what you're using, but I think stable diffusion can really help with upscaling. There are also other upscalers online on like GitHub that you can get. So all very interesting. Let's continue here. And so again, massive shout out to this incredible community.
00:19:16.710 - 00:19:43.076, Speaker A: I mean, this is all like, we're 20 minutes in and it's just like, this is all this awesome community here. So again, just humbling, a humbling and just awesome birthday like, like I've never had before. The Guardian. So we discussed this last, so serious business here. We discussed this last episode. We had the Bloomberg article on this. There's also a Guardian article.
00:19:43.076 - 00:20:10.370, Speaker A: AI helped scholars read scroll buried when Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD. So basically the same story but outlined a little bit in clearer form here. Researchers used AI to read letters on papyrus, scroll damaged by the blast of heat, ash and pumice that destroyed Pompeii. And of course, that is one of the great trips if you ever go to Rome. I haven't done it yet. Maybe I'll do it this year. I actually have a trip to Rome, but it's so hard to leave Rome.
00:20:10.370 - 00:20:55.914, Speaker A: I always have such a good time in Rome. Scholars of antiquity believe they are on the brink of a new era of understanding after researchers armed with artificial intelligence read the hidden text of a charred scroll that was buried when Mount Vesuvius erupted nearly 2000 years ago. Hundreds of papyrus scrolls held in the library of a luxury roman villa in Herculaneum were burned to a crisp when the town was devastated. Excavations in the 18th century recovered more than a thousand whole or partial scrolls from the mansion thought to be owned by Julius Caesar's father in law. But the black ink was unreadable on the carbonized papyri, and the scrolls crumbled to pieces when researchers tried to open them. So inaccessible. Tantalizingly close.
00:20:55.914 - 00:21:55.406, Speaker A: But look at this. The breakthrough in reading the ancient material came from a $1 million Vesuvius challenge, a contest launched in 2023 by Brent Seals, a computer scientist from University of Kentucky. And Silicon Valley backers. Again, like, you see the, you know, like this is, you know, it's sort of like Zuckerberg. You know, if you find this, like maybe, why is this so important? It's like Zuckerberg is obsessed with ancient Rome as far even the haircut for a while. Remember that it's kind of serious business, which I think most of you understand and know, but just to kind of, this is kind of another angle on the serious businesses, Silicon Valley people. What do you do when you have all the money in the world? We're kind of back to these kind of larger issues of culture, almost, you know, going back to our discussion yesterday, why are you an artist, right? For the money or to put a dent in the culture? And so all to say, let's continue here.
00:21:55.406 - 00:22:45.384, Speaker A: The competition offered prizes for extracting, and they had some good results. On Monday, Nat Friedman, a us tech executive and founding sponsor of the challenge, announced that a team of three computer savvy students, Youssef Nader in Germany, Luke Ferridor in the US, and Julian Schillinger in Switzerland, had won the grand prize after reading more than 2000 greek letters from the scroll. And so papyrologists who have studied the text recovered from the blackened scroll were stunned at the feet. This is a complete game changer. There are hundreds of these scrolls waiting to be read. So that's Robert Fowler, emeritus professor of Greek at Bristol University. So just one more quote here from Frederica Nicolardi from the University of Naples.
00:22:45.384 - 00:23:31.770, Speaker A: This is a start of a revolution in herculaneum, paparology and in greek philosophy in general. In greek philosophy in general, it is the only library to come from us from ancient roman times. We are moving into a new era, said Seals, who led efforts to read the scrolls by virtually unwrapping the CT images and training AI algorithms to detect the presence of the ink. So now they want to build portable CT scanners so that they don't have to move the scrolls. So all to say this is, as the scholars there say, a huge deal, potentially. Patrick Amadon, back to our business here. There's tremendous pressure to increase prices, to demonstrate progress.
00:23:31.770 - 00:24:05.340, Speaker A: So discussing the trials and tribulations of artists as they start to sell work, then they go. And then maybe you start small on Tezos, selling for a couple of tezos, then maybe you want five tezos for your work. This is always a push and pull sort of dynamic, because then potentially you lose collectors as you raise prices. There's a balance, there's a pace. So Patrick Amadon saying there's a pressure to increase prices to demonstrate progress, you end up leaving a lot of collectors behind. We're too early for that. Plenty of time later.
00:24:05.340 - 00:24:43.332, Speaker A: Accessibility is important, and I thought this was actually a pretty good point. Don't be in a huge rush to make progress, particularly in a soft market. It's different if, like, works on secondary are selling out left and right. But in a softer market, especially, there's no rush. You know, just it's kind of more important. It's like the more important thing is really to move your work, arguably, than to sit on high prices and not sell it. And I say that to myself as I think of my Ethereum work there.
00:24:43.332 - 00:25:10.542, Speaker A: Empress trash. I'm still in shock, to be honest, of everything that has happened this week. One of my goals of 2024 was to have a solo show and now to have it actualized so early in the year. I mean, it's early February. I'm realizing I need to think even bigger. So just another success story and just another grounds for optimism just from artists perspective here. Continuing on kind of more about the market and Sothebys here.
00:25:10.542 - 00:25:38.850, Speaker A: So this is Stellabell. This perfectly illustrates that Sothebys isnt about art. So Sothebys is selling the Aether rocks, an early NFT collectible. So this is kind of like this. Its kind of like a meme, I guess, on the ETH blockchain, as many of you know. But for those that dont know an early NFT, these aether rocks and they sell for, I don't know if it's hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions of dollars. And they're, you know, it's kind of taken on a life of its own.
00:25:38.850 - 00:26:07.118, Speaker A: And so here's Sotheby's, which is presenting the ether rocks, an early NFT collectible at a sealed auction. So interesting. So Sotheby's, because, of course, Sotheby's being one of the ultimate and Christie's being one of the ultimate forms of social proof. As an artist, I've sold at Sotheby's. And then here's stellabel kind of pointing out, well, you know, they're also selling these kind of simple drawings of Aether rocks. This isn't about the art. This is.
00:26:07.118 - 00:26:27.736, Speaker A: This is, you know, arguably about the, the money here, according to Stellabel. And it's kind of bringing up this, you know, idea. We're almost back to this culture versus the art, which we're actually going to see a commentary on. Let's look at more commentary and keep running here. Sebato. This is why you shouldn't put sold at Sotheby's in your social media bios. They would literally sell a rock if they could.
00:26:27.736 - 00:26:57.372, Speaker A: So more excellent commentary in our newspaper, on the op ed pages of our newspaper, the imagination here, Salawaki. And here, visual commentary going once, going twice. And there is a salwaki figure in the middle of a rock here. So hilarious from Salawaki. So on we go, looking at physical manifestations of artwork here of digital art. Here's Saiko, also known as score gm goodnight. My physical work, Kirakira print on acrylic.
00:26:57.372 - 00:27:24.538, Speaker A: I think Kirakira is that shine. Always excited to see something kirakira. And of course Skor was describing Kirakira in her when she was on the Twitter space or the x space that we did a couple of months ago. So very, very cool. Look at that. Even the shiny. This almost looks like augmented reality, doesn't it? Because look at that frame and then you see it across here.
00:27:24.538 - 00:27:56.334, Speaker A: So interesting combo here. Continuing on, santiago ruao with a beautiful framed version of one of Santiago's works. New prints are coming. So more impressive manifestations here of digital art. Here's Tim Sechenti. I think me and dina chang Setastudio created a 30 minutes eye melting visuals installation for intel for the Grammys 2024. So I think this is for the Grammys after party, if I read correctly.
00:27:56.334 - 00:28:18.734, Speaker A: How cool is that? And look at this screen here. So dina chang up to all sorts of wild business here with Tim Sachenti, who's maybe set a studio. There they are. So they are partnering dina chang and Timothy Ascenti. Timothy Saccenti do set a studio. So very, very cool. Look at that.
00:28:18.734 - 00:28:48.634, Speaker A: Great big wide screen for the Grammys after party, I believe. Tomba battle. This is super cool. You can see a little bit in Tatomba battle's process here. Look at this. How cool is this? So see how the sausage is made, as they say? So as you see here, putting the dithering after. Let's just look one more time here, starting with the outlines, adding the shading after as one would, you know, as actually as one would.
00:28:48.634 - 00:29:19.446, Speaker A: But interesting, right? I don't know if I would. Interestingly, like, I like to keep it almost random how it comes in, but this is a pretty cool. So anyways, just a great video from Tom Bambattle there. And continuing on, some more super interesting works by element Li on physicals. So this looks like bark engraving cave. So I think we've seen this work, right, with the person kind of coming out of this cave. A super original work here.
00:29:19.446 - 00:29:35.026, Speaker A: And I think we have a more close up version here. So I don't know if this is laser printing. You know, it kind of looks bark engraving. So somehow engraved into bark. I assume laser. I assume laser. So just kind of burnt into wood here.
00:29:35.026 - 00:30:29.014, Speaker A: Very interesting. Pixel art burnt into wood. Again, you're like using digital iconography, mark making like the pixels and then putting it into more traditional mediums, like in physical reality, let's say. And here, look at this interesting mark making you get as a result, and you wouldn't get this mark making, one would argue, without the digital part of the process, the digital step. So again, reinvigorating out, you could argue, life into physical, traditional mediums. This is why painting probably never will die, because you can always take digital or the most recent technological advancements in imagery, let's say, for lack of better terms, and then apply them into painting. And then, you know, transmogrify, re bring them into painting.
00:30:29.014 - 00:30:57.984, Speaker A: Fascinating. Here are a couple of digital works here. Undetermined creature and scale. And there's just something incredibly magical, isn't there, about Elmont Lee's work? I think it's just the kind of reminds me of that artist we see often at the end, Bondozo Bandezo, where it's just, there's a kind of carefreedness, which really works beautifully. Big building, also quite prolific. And a nice small. Again, these files are probably miniature.
00:30:57.984 - 00:31:25.532, Speaker A: Again, I'm, you know, I'm always back to ordinals. I'm going, okay, this is a tiny. This is probably like less than 10 kb. You know, this is screaming for ordinals, isn't it? Some more physicals here. This time by Xing, looking like doing some more beautiful screen printing here. And, you know, you gotta love all of this noise, this kind of inky noise here. And then this beautiful skull.
00:31:25.532 - 00:31:48.264, Speaker A: A rendering of a skull, right, of a gif, one assumes, turning around and then all on one plane here. So again, incorporating the digital into traditional mediums here. This time, screen printing. Fascinating and beautiful. And here, these were interesting too, I thought. Actually pretty hilarious. So, of course, axin comes out of the zine culture.
00:31:48.264 - 00:32:06.494, Speaker A: And here we see. I thought this was hilarious here. Just a couple examples of works in print, you know. So no stranger to putting works on paper here. Here's another one. Figure one Perseus, with the head of non verified person. So as you can see back here, I think, playing off the caravaggio.
00:32:06.494 - 00:32:28.804, Speaker A: Carvaggio, actually, I don't know if Perseus. I'm just thinking Medusa. So maybe not off a caravaggio. Yeah, this is what I'm thinking of. But here, almost like playing off of this whole thing with holding Medusa's head. And then here, it's a non verified person. I just thought that was hilarious.
00:32:28.804 - 00:32:52.934, Speaker A: So cool with the axeen sticker, seeming sticker, almost looks like a hologram there. Or a shiny sticker. So very cool there. Get verified. And here for the art, here for the culture. So, you know, again, back to this almost op ed page of sorts that we have here, this visual op ed page in the newspaper. The imagination here for the art, you here can for the culture, playing off the Spider man meme and them being the same thing.
00:32:52.934 - 00:33:14.886, Speaker A: Hilarious. Yeah, exactly. You know, it's almost like the art, you know, a false dichotomy, perhaps, here. And also, this was released. So we had the massive fake whale released there. I mean, a ton of work here in the new decentralized autonomous gallery, I think it's called. And we're gonna look more closely at it.
00:33:14.886 - 00:34:02.776, Speaker A: So here's oxyen the proxy. So this was from that series here as well. So again, nice here, you know, here you have, you know, what we could call loosely, like, digital painting, actually, not loosely. This is nice digital painting contrasting beautifully with this kind of drawn out pixelation here in the apple, what's, you know, some sort of VR headset or apple vision pro, then contrasting here with this beautiful. You see how it, you know, this beautiful different forms of, you know, rendering pixelation in the middle of this cube. Quite brilliant. And here, this very large pixelation, again, contrasting with the computer screen here.
00:34:02.776 - 00:34:27.574, Speaker A: So quite a powerful piece. When you start contrasting all of these different kinds of renderings here, and then you put it within this kind of very renaissance like semicircle, very kind of roman arch, classical, you know, semicircle. So here is fake whale art market. Cool title. Art market. And so here it is. I mean, it's a massive drop.
00:34:27.574 - 00:35:03.104, Speaker A: It looks like it went pretty well. I mean, 14,000 Tez volume, 187 owners, 31 for sale, floor price seven. So a lot of these work selling out here. So we look at a few of them, unfortunately, like, as you can see here, we can't go through all of them, but I kind of sprinkled a few of these into the show here. But of course, you know, then there's this work here. And actually, we're going to look closer what that sold for. So all to say, a huge, huge drop here from fake whale.
00:35:03.104 - 00:35:24.604, Speaker A: Now, I don't understand the difference. Say, like, so this is. It's kind of like a curation, maybe. It says here. So you have this big exhibition tab. Oh, so this is pretty cool. And then you write like a kind of artist statement right on the show.
00:35:24.604 - 00:36:08.328, Speaker A: Kind of makes you wonder, like, remember RJ? And it'll be interesting to see if this is going to be open to everybody, because you can see, remember RJ's exhibitions where it was kind of like a PDF. And I almost wonder out loud to myself, I mean, this seems to be another way of doing it right where it's almost like. So it's pretty cool. It seems like they add the exhibition tab here, and then it becomes kind of like a collaboration curation type page, right, where you kind of organize with the artist beforehand. So very interesting. And again, looks like a pretty big success there. And so this piece, we were looking at a pretty good deal, if you ask me, for this.
00:36:08.328 - 00:36:37.334, Speaker A: You know, this is a work by Inigo Bilbao that we're looking at there maybe a week or whenever that was ago, only going for 300 tezos, I think you could. And, you know, I'm sure that more can be made, and I don't know if this is probably only one that was minted. Very reasonable price, if you ask me, for a work that's this kind of powerful. So congratulations. It is still a great sale. Congratulations to Inigo fake whale. And the collector there.
00:36:37.334 - 00:37:05.198, Speaker A: Yeah, see, Josh was trying to get it bought St. I think Josh put in a bid, like, put in like an early kind of bid, and then before it could be accepted, maybe the bots took it away, this sort of thing. So all to say, a stunning, stunning work. Congratulations on the sale. Here's a new artist I discovered yesterday, Uriel. If you see this, drop a monster. Just an interesting kind of new discovery here.
00:37:05.198 - 00:37:22.928, Speaker A: And working this is physical, if I'm not mistaken. So I thought I'd throw it into the physical area, and I'll just show you what I'm saying. My Uriel's collection, six pieces are now live. Three of them have found their owners, while the other three are waiting for. For theirs. And, of course, the physical versions will be sent as well. So these are physical.
00:37:22.928 - 00:37:43.044, Speaker A: And I'll just show you more closely here. Look at this. So just pretty stunning work here as ever in this scene. So this is Uriel. And here you see all of the work that goes in. So again, pretty impressive. The 7th piece of the series is coming soon.
00:37:43.044 - 00:38:18.066, Speaker A: So pretty, again, just kind of impressive there. Continuing on, bzaya with a very fun work here. This was in the fake whales art market. Motogaucho, a fictional fan art version of the iconic argentinian trap band Moto Diablo, composed of dookie, neo pistis, and wises. So I thought just a very, very fun work. Again, so many works in this episode could really start it that I just went with the art therapy with Zozo at the start. Just I went for mood at the start of this.
00:38:18.066 - 00:38:45.034, Speaker A: And Zozo is brilliant mood, but this is just like, it's just really cool and fun. Kind of reminds me a little bit of Picasso's musicians or three dancers even, you know, and. But it's like musicians. Let's just quickly look very quickly, if Picasso actually has a work on musicians. Yeah, there's. Right. Kind of just like, you know, just in terms of the structure, three.
00:38:45.034 - 00:39:15.288, Speaker A: Just vaguely, but you know what I'm saying? And there's three figures. Very fun work from Bezaya. This is ten tezos edition of 20 still available. Rosatio with a cool work we haven't seen, I don't think, from Rosatio for a month or so, a few weeks. Anyway, so new cool work from Rosatio for the fake whale call. So nice work there. And great to see Rosacea back at work here, being human.
00:39:15.288 - 00:39:48.668, Speaker A: And this is 13 tezos and I think sold out or three left on primary. So interesting. So with the exhibition says then the gallery, I guess, maybe becomes, let's just go to their homepage and see. So this is like the gallery profile page, so featured. And there's. And then they can put out their exhibitions. This is really cool, isn't it? You know, you really gotta hand it to object, don't you? Like, are you just very impressed with, like.
00:39:48.668 - 00:40:24.850, Speaker A: And then there's a video, you know, really trying to do, like, what does a modern gallery look like without doing necessarily the 3d renderings of rebuilding? Like, what does it look like in a digital world where, you know, where the screen is preeminent, you know? And here's the artworks activity. This is very cool. So I wonder how this is going to develop here. Created with object galleries and going brilliantly with their new site here. And then again, this big gif in the background. Very, very interesting. This was also in the fake whale drop.
00:40:24.850 - 00:41:06.636, Speaker A: A beautiful work by Uri J. Not sure if we looked at this on Twitter beforehand, but just an awesome, awesome work. Again, kind of a musical theme here, which is such a fun theme, right? You see it in that Picasso, you see it in several works. You see it in even Mikey Delacreme with the blues musicians. It's an awesome subject. And, you know, it makes me think out loud here I was thinking, you know, I like to do that with the pixel art sketchbook, put out, you know, 303s, whatever, bass, drums. But what happens if you start, and maybe I'll try this thinking out loud that maybe you put a 808 and a 303.
00:41:06.636 - 00:41:52.980, Speaker A: Because I wonder if it becomes a more musical work if you start to hear the notes more. And maybe it needs more of a background. Because these things seem quite musical to me. Because, of course, I mean, just to finish the point here. Cause if you do the piano by itself, something that I kind of do in my own sort of way, you could argue it's not part of the music of the work, is all of this other stuff, right? Like this. So the music becomes a metaphor, or the art becomes a metaphor for the music. So even the car going around, you know, that movement of the car, there's a radio, and even these instruments leaning against each other with a radio, like, all of this becomes like music, right? A metaphor for the music.
00:41:52.980 - 00:42:09.340, Speaker A: So interesting. And look at the. You gotta love this, too. The actual sheet music here. And then a nice little kind of bananas and a clock on top. You see the brilliance of Yuri J's work here. And awesome title, quartet 45 Tay.
00:42:09.340 - 00:42:37.528, Speaker A: So selling out for 15 on primary there edition of ten. This is Dana Ulama with a very interesting work here. This is a still work. So going for half an ETH on foundation here. And as you see, I think it's called woman the Mirror. And it is a woman taking bathroom selfie after a shower, digital drawing. And just a cool kind of use of the humidity on the mirror and just letting a part of the body shine through here.
00:42:37.528 - 00:43:17.800, Speaker A: Kind of a classic. You know, I'm kind of a. I really like the subject matter, for whatever reason, of the bathroom mirror. I think it's kind of one of those quiet times where we kind of contemplate ourselves and our existence as we're kind of getting ready for the day, staring into the mirror. So I think it's just a really interesting subject matter here and a nice portrayal of what I'd consider kind of like a cool theme. Right? And there's the sink. Pretty nice bathroom, by the way, and interesting coloring, you know, going back to remember those earlier, that earlier look we took at Dana Ulama's different palettes that she uses.
00:43:17.800 - 00:43:43.800, Speaker A: So here's kind of like, I think a blue and purple one that we looked at, kind of greenish blue and purple and purple. Another brilliant work by seeing dreams fly. And again, we're kind of in between this, physical and digital. And there again, we have the space shuttle. There's something very romantic about the space shuttle, isn't there? And here. And we'll look at the description text. Looks like the person from the other.
00:43:43.800 - 00:44:12.496, Speaker A: And there's dream. There's something very romantic about the space shuttle, which is a retired spacecraft. Right. But the design, I mean, it really captures the imagination, doesn't it? And looking. I mean, I've used it in some of the Space Odyssey series that I do. There's something just visually just very powerful about the space shuttle as an image. I mean, all rocket launches, all rocket.
00:44:12.496 - 00:44:51.786, Speaker A: But I mean, the space shuttle, it's a masterpiece of. Because it's kind of about this humanity. When you start going into space and then you see this beautiful visual representation. There's a kind of poetry is what I'm trying to say here in this design that recollapse is celebrating, you know. And this kind of very, you know, beautifully put here in a kind of naivete, in a beautiful. And I use naivete in the positive sense of the word that Ballard uses it referring to Burroughs and Dali and Warhol dream. You know, not worrying about what the world says is what I mean with naivete.
00:44:51.786 - 00:45:12.314, Speaker A: Just going with honest. There's an honesty to this work. We see that also in Moda Mt's work. So just really interesting work. And again, is it digital, is it physical? Is it both interesting? Kind of scratchy style and texture there. Let's actually very quickly look continuation of the story from the work. Rocket dream.
00:45:12.314 - 00:45:33.014, Speaker A: A person who witnesses his dream about a rocket he designed being successfully flown. Powerful edition of four. Selling out oxy and picking up one Ezra Eslin. Oh, my God, I draw it. And Mikey Wilson. You cannot ask for a better collector base than that, can you? And how much did it sell for? Oh, transferred. Transferred.
00:45:33.014 - 00:45:45.274, Speaker A: Okay. Transferred over. But maybe previously previous collectors, probably of the other work there. This brilliant. So you see here, this was the one we were looking at yesterday. And. Yeah, those are the collectors.
00:45:45.274 - 00:46:06.774, Speaker A: Those are the collectors. So rewarding the collectors. Very cool there. Very interesting piece from myth here. A poetic work here at love medicine. And this is done in Microsoft paint from 2020, but just minted here. And here you see maybe a doctor figure, the big banana doctor figure wheeling the patient out.
00:46:06.774 - 00:46:30.604, Speaker A: And then some woman on the lap of the patient here with this know, classic myth sky to an unreleased work by the myth. And this interesting black, you know, background here at the bottom. Ms Paint and mouse painting with a mouse. We're back to that, the myth rarities. Love medicine. Seven tazos. Again, great collectors out here.
00:46:30.604 - 00:46:48.186, Speaker A: And this is an edition of 15 still available. Very interesting poetic piece there. And kind of ambiguous, you know, you're not sure. Evokes different feelings. It's. That's, you know, myths, poetry. He's very good at kind of pressing certain buttons without, but very.
00:46:48.186 - 00:47:12.070, Speaker A: But not literal at all. Just kind of suggestive. I'd argue great poet is what I'm getting at. This is NUV 1914, Bosito. Also just another beautiful work here. This is what looks like maybe two dogs kissing here. And then some flowers here by Nev 1914, done in the classic nev 1914 style with all little beautiful contrasts here.
00:47:12.070 - 00:47:52.478, Speaker A: The super, you know, gradient here, light gradient, you know, soft gradient, you know, mixing with just this hard edged, you know, pixelation here with these two dogs made of gradients, kissing. Busito Tentezos edition of one, still available. What is super beautiful work here? Again, like I was saying, like, rock and roll is what I was thinking to myself. And I was, we're only like, there's a lot more to go here, so I got to speed up. This could be the longest episode ever, potentially, that we've done here, because. Okay, so I'll speed up here. This brilliant work by RJ listed on Solana, beautiful black background.
00:47:52.478 - 00:48:33.210, Speaker A: It kind of has what I get tempted to call the sketchbook style or the sketchbook layout, where you start to kind of forget about the work, needing to work as a narrative painting, work in space, where all of a sudden, it's just more about, oh, a work here. Like a sketchbook, a work here, kind of like, you could argue, the great doodler of all, you know, the greatest doodler of all time. Basquiat. It's kind of the sketchbook style. It's not necessarily worrying about the space, right? So it's a different kind of compositional style. A very satisfying, you know, compositional style. I use it myself here.
00:48:33.210 - 00:49:03.358, Speaker A: You know, beautiful work here. Love the decision to make this black background very powerful. And you see these kind of different renderings of fruit here. These different still lives, leaving some, you know, blank, uh, layers here, potentially turning off layers, perhaps. Uh, this negative space, this beautiful black negative space, even in the wine bottle here. Stunning work by RJ. Uh, going for only 0.1
00:49:03.358 - 00:49:29.046, Speaker A: sol. It's now this one of one is only. Is this a one of one? This is only $10 at auction. So, uh, FYI, portrait, still a day left in that auction. 19 hours. Another one by RJ back on tazos here after Francis Bacon continuing the Pepe series. And this sold at auction for only five.
00:49:29.046 - 00:49:45.614, Speaker A: So Roerich scooping it. This. You know. You know, those auctions, you know, I'm sure if more people had known about this, this would have went for more. So, great scoop there by Roerich. You know, it pays to keep paying attention. Keep checking your notifications.
00:49:45.614 - 00:50:08.422, Speaker A: So a play on Bacon and Roerich scooping up this one of one by RJ, a pastiche of Francis Bacon here, with a pepe inside for pennies on the dollar. Nice work. Neustre cosa. Or maybe that's our cause. I thought it was Casa, so I thought it was our house. Not sure, though. I don't speak Spanish.
00:50:08.422 - 00:50:34.770, Speaker A: Beautiful painting. Another interesting composition from wasteman gold Minevich here and here. Kind of like a family scene, but wearing the balaclavas and there's a cigarette and the house on fire and, you know, maybe getting ready for a family trip or something. Beautiful, beautiful piece here. Edition of 13 for three tezos, four gone so far. Really nice piece. And this was hilarious.
00:50:34.770 - 00:51:13.750, Speaker A: Uber cop, so, playing off, so, playing off the donut cops liking donut meme, so to speak. And there's the motorbike made of donuts, so a hilarious take on the meme. And there is a McDonald's helmet. And so a satire, another satire here. And then it's uber, interestingly so, it's like an uber police person. And so an interesting shadow, isn't it? So just a very, very interesting work here. Provocative and fun work here from wasteman gold Minevich.
00:51:13.750 - 00:51:39.410, Speaker A: Edition of ten for three tazos. And so selling nicely. Beautiful work, as usual here. PB Universal, I think, playing off of the stone here. Tezito's rock. So, playing off of the ether rock that we're seeing by Sotheby's here, and applying this beautiful style, this beautiful original style by PP Universal here, with this rock here. This is an addition of zero.
00:51:39.410 - 00:51:49.434, Speaker A: So this was burned. There may be a newer version. We'll look quickly. The Internet is playing nice here so far. So maybe that was just burnt. Not sure if it will be relisted. This all looks.
00:51:49.434 - 00:52:22.378, Speaker A: I mean, again, as I always say here, I'm putting my hand out in the waterfall and here's a one of one. We'll see if it loads up. Otherwise we gotta run. We'll see if it loads here as we go into the next work. De taste with a one of one, only five tazos at auction. Portrait of Christopher Multisanti at Honolulu. So for those, you know, for those people that are diligent, for those diligent collectors here, there are definitely opportunities to get great art on the cheap here.
00:52:22.378 - 00:52:47.706, Speaker A: This is to taste very interesting. Cool one of one here, you know, cool kind of contemporary clothing on, you know, it looks like, you know, this is Honolulu, you know, so on an island, maybe that's. I don't know. This is probably someone famous. It kind of looks like someone famous here. So five tezos right now, District 468 has put in a bid. And there's probably another 22 or maybe only a couple of hours left.
00:52:47.706 - 00:52:58.394, Speaker A: This may be done. Only a couple of hours left. We'll see if this other. Oh, so here, the PP work showed up. Komo calmer. Atupareja. So interesting piece here.
00:52:58.394 - 00:53:17.034, Speaker A: Kind of playing with collage a little bit here. So interesting work here by pipi. This is 20 tez. 20 tez. So again, all sorts of opportunities here. Learning to smile. Lewis Osborne selling out at ten tezos, each edition of 25 here.
00:53:17.034 - 00:53:41.182, Speaker A: So a new work here. I think we've seen this on x before, but finely minted here, probably has a ton in the pipeline. And here, hilariously, the smile is kind of with the fan and the wind is blowing the smile larger. And then the hair here. Nicely done. Very geometric in everything in the curves. Very nice, balanced composition, as usual.
00:53:41.182 - 00:54:13.474, Speaker A: And just beautifully done. Really interesting how Lewis Osborne uses the noise in the background, what looks like kind of dust or physicality, and then uses that to animate the work. Very interesting way of what I'd say, what I like to call a complicator, adding a complicator to the work and then contrasting that with this other movement here. And then all of a sudden it's too much for your brain. So then you just accept it. Then you just accept the animation, you stop analyzing it, and you accept the movie, so to speak, learning to smile. Great title.
00:54:13.474 - 00:54:37.958, Speaker A: Here's Morlakos with a rare work here, pescando on El Baro. Not sure what that means, but someone, this nude figure here, fishing. And I thought, just an interesting piece here, big piece, and a nice kind of simple work here. One of one selling for ten tezos here, or listed for ten tezos still available. A one of one. More lackos. Again, lots of opportunities here.
00:54:37.958 - 00:54:59.626, Speaker A: This one went for sale for five tezos to District 468. So again, one of ones by pretty prominent and, you know, artists with real roots in this blockchain who have made incredible works here. So interesting work here. Kind of a black and white work, kind of like. Almost like an ink drawing here from rollaco. Stark spaces. Interesting experimentation.
00:54:59.626 - 00:55:33.104, Speaker A: Five tazos. Another steel here is Ilio Gible. This feeling will pass. So we've been looking at Ilio Gible's very, what I'd call surreal illustration. And look at this. This de Chirico dali like shadow here, these psychological shadows in this bright, you know, overlit day, to almost paraphrase Ballard, there, this overlit realm. And here you see a tree, very stylized tree, tiny, you know, so very interesting illustration here from Ilyo Gible.
00:55:33.104 - 00:55:57.486, Speaker A: And kind of like interesting mood. And it's almost like the shadow. This feeling will pass, and the feeling seems to be in the shadow, doesn't it? Interesting, you know, psychological landscape, one could argue. And another great surreal illustrator here, Seba Sistaro. GM perspectives. Never seen this one before. So you see here this figure being kind of stretched out here.
00:55:57.486 - 00:56:15.070, Speaker A: And the legs being stretched out. And then an interesting background here. Kind of floral. And then some colors over here, just more interesting. And then kind of like classic colors by Saba. Just really interesting work there. And then more experimentation here from Katarina.
00:56:15.070 - 00:56:40.210, Speaker A: Create very cool, kind of surreal illustration here, too. Crazy about daisy. So again, playing with this kind of figure here, but now with kinda flower for the head and then white boots here, kind of more distorted, kind of larger big shoulders sort of thing. And then playing with the colors. More super interesting experimentation. And here, more of a classic work. Deer rider.
00:56:40.210 - 00:57:13.820, Speaker A: So playing with different kinds of animals here. Here we have a deer, and you see all the detail here. Deers are crying. Again, kind of surreal in the kind of treatment of what could be flowers and even the puddles of tears that the deer are walking through. And then this character that we always see with the white hair traveling on the deer, like a mythological scene here. And then there's the tree with the roots, again, always kind of resisting rationality a little bit, as well as these diamonds, you know, falling from the sky. Deer rider.
00:57:13.820 - 00:57:38.744, Speaker A: Very cool. One of one for 25 tazos from Katarina create. And here's one from Tornado Rodriguez on object. When I sleep, where do I go with a great title with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles here, and all sorts of great, maybe a goofy like character here. So another super cool illustration from Tornado Rodriguez. And there you see a watch and everything. Just a ton of detail here.
00:57:38.744 - 00:58:13.708, Speaker A: And interesting how it's not all outlined as you see with the green there. There's Michelangelo, the party dude and everything. So kind of playing with, you know, depicting action figures. Also kind of another play on what I call contemporary illustration, which we sometimes see with Adelia. Kind of like these contemporary bedrooms sort of thing, so to speak. I think I brought this up, actually, with Tornado Rodriguez about a year ago on the spaces. So we'll have to have a tornado back on, actually, on the spaces there.
00:58:13.708 - 00:58:50.976, Speaker A: Okay. Penance is mine, Jake studios. So another illustration, again, kind of surreal, interestingly, kind of very metaphoric, you know, and, yeah, so here is kind of classic mouth that we saw before in a previous work. And here with a tv screen. Tezos died for our sins. Almost like a crucifixion reference here, but here, referencing the triangle again, always kind of suggestive, never quite making sense on a rational level, but on an irrational level, kind of. Yeah, a weird kind of.
00:58:50.976 - 00:59:12.194, Speaker A: Almost crucifixion of sorts. This guy with a bag on their head and then some cigarettes and alcohol. Empty bottle on the beach. And nice treatment of the water there, too. So, Jake Studios, is this a one of one? This is eight tazos. So for fairly, you know, even if you're starting to collect right now, it's a great time. It's a really great time to collect right now.
00:59:12.194 - 00:59:35.170, Speaker A: So that is at auction, still available. Here's Santiago with a couple song written backwards. Broken after night and day collapsed as we hit the hour mark. So I'm going to speed up a bit here. And this looks like a pixelation version, right? So we've been looking at the different ways that Santiago treats the work. So this one a bit more pixelated. 400 by 400 by ten edition of 15 for three tazos.
00:59:35.170 - 00:59:51.294, Speaker A: And we have another work. This is great here, too. Love the border on this one. Two going all the way to the edges here. Only trust words by whoever said lightly and forgotten. This is three tezos edition of 20. And here we see more vector.
00:59:51.294 - 01:00:04.222, Speaker A: Right. And remember last show, we were seeing a combination, the pixelation and the vector. So all very interesting here. Quite beautiful. Fits the screen perfectly. Almost perfectly. Very cool work.
01:00:04.222 - 01:00:28.326, Speaker A: Gotta love this size, you know, like that kind of old retro screen size. Very cool. Let's continue here. Gugu, or guru, guru hyena with an open edition. This one's three tazos. Another interesting work here that could fit in the same show as a santiago's. And a cool start button here, but almost looking like a VCR and all sorts of stuff.
01:00:28.326 - 01:00:49.326, Speaker A: Image, Internet iconography, a little bit of maybe even Mario clouds here. Interesting. Just juxtaposition of digital elements here. Digitalia, as I like to call it. Continuing on, mumble boy, with a couple of great works here. Look at this. Really experimenting with composition.
01:00:49.326 - 01:01:09.214, Speaker A: And there is a keyboard, kind of looks like a Mac keyboard on top. And again, this wild collage style, as you can see, quite a large work and everything here. Cool gradient in the background. Look at the keyboard up close, so just life from a window. And this is edition of three for fortezos. Here's another one. Now, chaos.
01:01:09.214 - 01:01:30.096, Speaker A: And then chaos. Now backwards. And this is an edition of two. And again, more of this very interesting kind of collage style here, as you can see. Kind of mixing it with a little bit of gradients and soft, you know, airbrush type work. And this is sold out. One of one, picking one up.
01:01:30.096 - 01:01:49.972, Speaker A: Very cool for eight tazos. And here's one more. Gotta love this one, too. Drive my car. And here you see this kind of playing more with a photo and keeping a bit more of the representation going on here. But here, almost upside down. Maybe a small window into mumble boy's process, like a raw version.
01:01:49.972 - 01:02:21.612, Speaker A: You can imagine this is like mumble boy at work and then just deciding maybe a little earlier to stop business here, perhaps, for tazos. Here's Max Drecker, back again, shades. And I hadn't seen much in my feed from Max Drecker for the last year. Now we're starting to see stuff come out again. Kind of a original, kind of geometric abstract artist on Tazo. So kind of showing some work on X. And here's a couple of works that ranks dear, who was at the start there in the Twitter space.
01:02:21.612 - 01:02:38.744, Speaker A: Some on the new drop, I think, with join XYZ. Part of euphoria. This is euphoria number four. So beautiful minimal artwork here. Great color here. And we have another one again, playing with this very minimal composition. Beautiful colors and everything.
01:02:38.744 - 01:02:55.184, Speaker A: My first showcase on join XYZ, so 15, one of one artworks. And the series is called Euphoria. So this is on ETH. And there is the link there. So just go to Rannoch Steers page. A couple of more from Wok. This is only one tezos.
01:02:55.184 - 01:03:17.714, Speaker A: So real deals here on Tezos blockchain. Right now. Another walk, one of one. This is what look like firemen during 911 here, I'm assuming. And again, all of the beautifully colored noise here from Walk's augmented reality series. There's 1012. Here's 1011.
01:03:17.714 - 01:03:36.464, Speaker A: Quite a different work here. Interesting edges there. Kind of circular rectangle edges there. So interesting piece there. Also at auction. And what is that at? Or that sold for only two tazos. Huge deals on the tezos right now.
01:03:36.464 - 01:03:54.976, Speaker A: Purple tower. So this came out a couple of weeks ago from Ed Marolla, and we had missed this work. So an interesting piece here. We'll see if it. There we go. So interesting pixel artwork here by Ed Marolla. Almost looking photographic in the background there, isn't it? Kind of nice? Small work.
01:03:54.976 - 01:04:24.528, Speaker A: Delightfully small. Again, I'm tempted to know how big the file size is on these. Again, some of these small, you reduce it to two colors and all of a sudden, you know, bitcoin put on ordinals, they are dreaming us. So this is also. This was just put out by Ed. So kind of a cryptic one, of course, 100 editions, one tezos. And of course, Ed's main subject matter is dreaming, as we learned in the space maybe three or four months ago.
01:04:24.528 - 01:04:40.532, Speaker A: So interesting piece. And here's almost like dream kind of text here at the top. And then some iconography and so very interesting piece. Be their dream. Almost makes you wonder if it's a ticket for something. Gio Mariani, cultivating a garden. That's all mine.
01:04:40.532 - 01:05:13.130, Speaker A: Not sure if this is new or not, but just great to see work from Gio Mariani. Kind of a classic artist on the Tezos blockchain and great, kind of influenced a lot of people too. Great pixel artist. And so just very interesting work, as usual. Just kind of, again, kind of, you could argue kind of like the sketchbook style, but not, or compositional style, but kind of having its own thing. This is more just like, almost like what you'd find in a zine or a. Those prints that you can rezo print.
01:05:13.130 - 01:05:30.772, Speaker A: It's kind of got the rizoprint feel to it, that kind of style. Let's continue here. Sophie Ogura. Rest. This is 360 edition of eight. So real cool, kind of experimental works here, as you see here, this kind of manga anime type figure, almost like this thing is doubled. Like this image is doubled up here.
01:05:30.772 - 01:05:46.524, Speaker A: At least the drink and the lines. Just cool experimentation. Edgy. And then you see the little window here and a pixelated rest. So this is an edition of eight selling out at three tezos. So nice work there. Suisochi.
01:05:46.524 - 01:05:58.284, Speaker A: Picking one up. And here is another super interesting work. Erica Lenhares. This is an edition of five. Girlfriend. Very interesting. Edgy.
01:05:58.284 - 01:06:21.038, Speaker A: Edgy. Edgy. And you see the heart here, it's almost playing with jpeg ization, what you, I guess people would call the JPEG artifacts. But then using that perhaps as a source for pixel art, or like using that like, as a foundation. Very interesting. Just very, very interesting. Selling a few too here at fortezos.
01:06:21.038 - 01:06:33.622, Speaker A: Each addition of five. This looks sold out. There's two left. There are two left. Interesting piece. And this was retweeted by Sabato. The account here is Hattori 2000 sawagani.
01:06:33.622 - 01:07:08.282, Speaker A: And here we see a crab with maybe some sort of rock or something it's holding. I just thought of fun work here. And here's another work by Violet Tripp. And this is part of a series 25, one of one animations in retro 16 bit style on a new drop on foundation. Just thought this is kind of a moving work here with this figure here. Probably this, you know, using AI and bitmap or dithering and this cool kind of woman in front of a palm tree within a operating system window. I thought this was hilarious too, actually.
01:07:08.282 - 01:07:31.682, Speaker A: My, you again. Rock and roll out here. Vision reality. So here we have, you know, what looks like a business person on a train playing with their vision pro here, doing their job in this empty subway car, metro car. Pretty hilarious. Nicely done there from Myu. And not sure, I think it's what's going on.
01:07:31.682 - 01:07:47.290, Speaker A: So unlisted. Maybe you can put an offer in vision reality, Haiti rocket. So this was in the fake whale drop too. One moment please. So this sold I think for 420. So nice sale there for Haiti rocket. Kind of a different feel to this one.
01:07:47.290 - 01:08:03.074, Speaker A: And just cool experimentation. One of one. And yeah, going for 420 to this anonymous wallet out here. So big congrats to Haiti rocket on that one. Francois Gamma here. This was one of one posted this. Another walker from Francois Gamma.
01:08:03.074 - 01:08:21.488, Speaker A: So one of one. Spotting more of these great francoise gamma pieces and picking them up. Just fantastic. Love this series with all the noise and the artifacts. Just very, very cool. And another work that could have started the show. This is Sabato dream console.
01:08:21.488 - 01:08:44.516, Speaker A: I mean, this is awesome. And like, you don't need to know anything about digital art. And it just fits the screen perfectly. Actually, this, you know, fits the screen perfectly here. And you see the dream console. Beautiful part of the chrome drawing series, I believe. Chrome period drawings and dream console CP 18.
01:08:44.516 - 01:09:10.183, Speaker A: And the offers are coming in, so check out Sabato's x profile to find out how you bid. But basically, you know, offers coming in will probably take the top ones. Edition of 25. Gorgeous, gorgeous work there. And another work likely made on deluxe paint. This is Muji playing with a modern super wide screen here, which I think is hilarious. And here you see a little bit on the side.
01:09:10.183 - 01:09:34.357, Speaker A: Not sure exactly what's on the side, but it looks beautiful. It doesn't matter what's on the side, it all looks beautiful. And here's like a great kind of console too. Almost looks like a video art or a video mixer. Almost like a old ipod there, who knows? But beautiful widescreen by Muji. Edition of 20. Selling for eight tezos and only two left, so selling well.
01:09:34.357 - 01:09:56.147, Speaker A: Green Ginger Retro city, another version. So new work by Greenger, edition of 50. These are atezos 50 each. And so just another cool pixel artwork this time of a city kind of having that 45 degree angle video game look. What if our world was designed like a city? Simulator game art made with aspirite. Very cool. Pixel art software.
01:09:56.147 - 01:10:16.041, Speaker A: The Guardian friend hand pixeled animation. And this is by, of course, manital. So I think it's the year of the dragon, if I'm not mistaken. And I'm not sure when it starts. It's usually February, the Chinese new year. So this looks like there's the manital cat in front of the dragon here. And look at this.
01:10:16.041 - 01:10:48.084, Speaker A: You got to love the scaling up here. Again, these pixel artists, I just think ordinals, because, again, you could just. You, if you kept it small, like, you wonder how small the file would be. I'd assume this would be around 40 or 50 kb, so that'd be a little more expensive. But there could be collectors. That's the thing. It's kind of, you know, with ordinals, there is art that's starting to show up on there, and that's been there, but it's still, you know, again, the pixel artists, I think, have the biggest opportunity there.
01:10:48.084 - 01:11:08.728, Speaker A: Here's more. Killer ink master. This is by Chaz 25 Tezos edition of one. So another arcade game here. And here you see what looks like kind of someone playing an arcade game or at least shooting at some sort of doom like monster eyeball monster. So this is 25 Tezos edition of one. And let's continue.
01:11:08.728 - 01:11:43.058, Speaker A: This was sent to me by Kiro Thomas Bangleter, who, of course, is one half of daft Punk. This is by e boy. This is an older work, but e boy, I believe, is like a pioneer pixel artist, if I'm not mistaken. And this because we're showing Ugo's daft punk works here. Kiro highlighting this very nice pixel art piece, by the way. So, you know, as I was telling Kalo on that interview we did, it's like, I used to be skeptical of pixel art. I liked it, you know, when I started this show.
01:11:43.058 - 01:12:33.664, Speaker A: But it was a leap, like, you know, describing how the evolution. And that's why, like, when new people come to this scene and they don't get it, like, we have to be very forgiving. Because, like, you know, here I was in the NFT scene for a year and a half, and I was like, is pixel art like capital A art? And I was asking myself that after a year and a half, probably in this scene and already having started this show, okay. But as I brought it in, then you look at more and more, you start to get it. But it's a language that we speak here and, you know, like, I've gotten the comment, you know, from family, from like my brothers, you know, relatives in law, you know, I started watching some of your show, but I just have no idea what's going on. I have no idea what you're talking about. So it's a language, interestingly.
01:12:33.664 - 01:13:10.760, Speaker A: So it's so all to say, if people don't get it, be forgiving. Nights 1001. So kind of a different work from Datura here, of course, doing these kind of almost represent or often almost pure abstract, but not seemingly referring to 1001 arabian nights, maybe aleatory objects. So again, interesting piece from Datura, edition of 20 for ten tezos, so still available there. And Google light us with a one of one. Look at this. Google lightest, doing awesome here.
01:13:10.760 - 01:13:24.244, Speaker A: One of one on exchange art. See if it loads up properly. Here it comes in. So interesting. Doing very well, I think, with three tezos. Another place where Pixel art is doing very well. Look at this great work here.
01:13:24.244 - 01:14:06.904, Speaker A: So now at 3.33, sold on exchange art and minimum bid is four. You know, this is a whole other thing, which is when you're minting on Solana, you're able to say how much someone has to raise the bid by. So you can say, buy a quarter of a sol, a 10th of a sol or a full sol. So it's interesting because you try and figure out this balance between alienating, as Patrick Amadon was saying at the start of the show, between going too high but still getting as much as you can for your artwork. Almost looks like a dream catcher, doesn't it? Holographic sunburst. And here's another work.
01:14:06.904 - 01:14:35.560, Speaker A: It's starting to get light here, but I'm going to sleep. So more cool work from gogolitis, more abstract work, animated abstracts from gogolitis. So again, keeping it pushed the boundaries. Cream safa, restless pattern. And here, playing with abstraction, animated abstraction as well. Sticking with, like, the vertical pixels. Now, I'm not sure, unfortunately, this tab has, well, disappeared, otherwise I go back to gogolitis.
01:14:35.560 - 01:14:59.900, Speaker A: I wonder if all the pixels in gogolitis are perpendicular. We'll keep watching. But here again, beautiful cream sapphire work. And this is on object and raising funds here. See if this loads. Restless pattern for the tez for pal fundraiser. Okay, so that's for Palestine, for international network for aid, relief and assistance.
01:14:59.900 - 01:15:12.140, Speaker A: Inara. So that is two tezos. And that is an edition of 100. Some more. Super interesting cool work by Kareem Safa. None to ego. This is neurocolor.
01:15:12.140 - 01:15:29.690, Speaker A: This was part of that drop there, too. We'll see if we can zoom in. What happens? Okay, nothing happens. Interesting, cool work by neurocolor. Again, kind of similar to that zuozo kind of gradient feel. Interestingly, I'm not sure if that's graphics. Probably.
01:15:29.690 - 01:15:45.686, Speaker A: Like maybe that's a retro software. Not sure. Cool outline, just cool work here. This 150 tezos. Of course, neural color is selling sometimes for huge amounts of money. This is an edition of 13 and still available. Six still available for 150 tezos.
01:15:45.686 - 01:16:11.946, Speaker A: Pretty good in this market. Sean Luke touching wires. So, new work here from Sean Luke, who also sells for a fortune. And here are some cool skulls going through. Cool variation on this style of Sean Luke's with the frame and these kind of cycling objects. And here again, 42 tazos on primary. And now 150 tezos.
01:16:11.946 - 01:16:27.694, Speaker A: Let's see, one on secondary. So, edition of eleven. Still selling very well there. Native Ed with a really interesting work. Look at this. It's kind of a figure. You can see the eyes as we continue our marathon session here at an hour and 16 minutes.
01:16:27.694 - 01:16:46.734, Speaker A: So very interesting piece here. Kind of, you know, it kind of not intoxicating, but it kind of makes dizzying work here, for lack of a better term. Data rect. This is eleven tezos, $0.11 edition of 20. And here's Roccano as we continue to speed here. Cybernetic love.
01:16:46.734 - 01:17:07.394, Speaker A: Interesting piece here from Recano. Kind of different way of kind of animating through some of these ideas here. So just kind of going from left to right, very interestingly. And there's a cache machine. This is five tezos edition of five. Continuing on, Lucas Lejeune, old light. And here's a vector here.
01:17:07.394 - 01:17:32.880, Speaker A: And kind of almost looks like a dragon of sorts. But more, this is just an animated abstract with vectors, black and white, different shapes here. Cool animation here from Lucas Lejeune. This is an edition of ten for seven tazos. And a couple from Braun, a couple of more super interesting, like rock and roll abstracts here from Braun. Just super interesting series here. Totally original.
01:17:32.880 - 01:17:59.526, Speaker A: You know, this digital abstraction, you know, abstract digital art, you know, gif 27 Tezos edition of one. Again, you know, for the experimenter looking for just interesting abstracts. 23 tezos edition of one. Here's flux zero seven. You know, you can really create it for not too much money. Create a darn interesting one of one collection right now on tezos. Huge opportunities here.
01:17:59.526 - 01:18:23.086, Speaker A: Very, very interesting work. Here's innovare with a GiF that was posted on X. Again, these super richly textured colors. There's something just gorgeous about these animated abstracts from Innovari. And here is Elbie motif, Fortezos edition of eight. Interesting kind of jagged work here. Jolting work here.
01:18:23.086 - 01:18:34.758, Speaker A: Motif. Interesting title, too, from LB here. Edition of eight for fortezos. And a few more from Klaus. This one was quite cool. Composition 123. Run, klaus, run.
01:18:34.758 - 01:18:53.600, Speaker A: Keep going. This is a one of one available for 23 tezos. More. Just gorgeous color work here in this piece here. And just interesting, just interesting video artwork. Composition 120, almost playing with a QR code. Type, type style here.
01:18:53.600 - 01:19:22.934, Speaker A: And so more compositions going to Sky Goodman for 21 tezos. And here's another gorgeous 1121 going to illusional for 23 tezos. And my favorite part is here, where the circle turns kind of foggy here. And then under here it's got the lines and these kind of beautiful. There's something very organic about all of these softwares. It must be the analog to a certain degree, this analog video. Very, very beautiful and powerful.
01:19:22.934 - 01:19:36.534, Speaker A: Original number 121. And here is Wojak, who I think is w 74, who I didn't realize had art. So this is. I don't think. I don't think I've shown Wojak's art before. Maybe once. The name is familiar.
01:19:36.534 - 01:19:54.704, Speaker A: Simulation number 16. But I didn't tie together that Wojak is w 74, if I'm not mistaken, on the number there. So here is an abstract here from w 74 on Solana. So cool. Animated, abstract. And here, a lot of kind of stretching lines. Kind of glitchy in itself.
01:19:54.704 - 01:20:08.724, Speaker A: Simulation number 16 sold for 1.21 sol. So nice. Sale there. $117 for this one of one Poseidon 3000 by 1654. Digital abstract painting and shaders for movement. Very cool.
01:20:08.724 - 01:20:27.468, Speaker A: And here is Sulkian with a GLB on Zora Nexicore. So keeping things wild here. Really look at that eyeball. Just such a wild artist. Sulkian going down his own path. Oh, my God, this is awesome. 30 of 200 minted.
01:20:27.468 - 01:20:43.162, Speaker A: Interesting. Limiting the edition, interestingly. So cool work there from Sulkian. Still kind of want the magnifier or not the magnifier. The full screen, if possible, on Zora would be awesome. Ivan Hugo. This is kind of funny.
01:20:43.162 - 01:21:14.542, Speaker A: Two k maul pink plush platform boots. So a cool glb here on Tezos. This is a Tezos 2025 edition of 25. As we go into AI venta, life and death kind of having. What is klimt. It's got a bit of a klimt feel to it, doesn't it? So playing with these figures here, kind of in Venta's kind of semi plasticine style, but now very matte ish rather than as shiny as before. So very interesting development here.
01:21:14.542 - 01:21:39.102, Speaker A: And again, kind of a klimt feel to this whole kind of clothing and this group of people and all the flowers and everything. Interesting piece after klimt. There you go. Venta Times AI edition of ten for five tazos and little cakes with a beautiful work here. The lights five. And check this out. I thought this was super interesting in here with these kind of gradients bleeding through.
01:21:39.102 - 01:22:02.294, Speaker A: And then this very, you know, instantly recognizable little cakes work here. And this figure here in kind of like a bedroom of sorts. Just kind of a surreal image. AI piece, the lights five, just breaking around the edges using improp studio, which creates these gorgeous textures here. Selling out at five tezos each. Great work. Cakes edition of five.
01:22:02.294 - 01:22:24.302, Speaker A: And here's triple zero nine with another addition to this, what I think is an AI art series here. So another edition here. Figure with a lot of blue and white here. And also wearing a mask, interestingly. And continuing on, medical mask. Pensa mientos entrelazados. This is kanik zapta.
01:22:24.302 - 01:22:50.826, Speaker A: And here you see another really interesting experimental piece, huge piece from canixapta. Prompt art. And here you see what kind of looks like somewhat of a futuristic gallery or inside a museum. This is 771. Again, one of one. So lots of one of ones available for under $10 out here from renowned artists. Here's another one.
01:22:50.826 - 01:23:11.324, Speaker A: Kind of nice painting work. This one sold for 20 tezos. One of one with a long AI title, I believe. So great texture in here. This is probably also huge, you see? And it holding up pretty well with the magnification here. And I think of our earlier discussion on magnifiers. Interesting cloud there, too.
01:23:11.324 - 01:23:24.074, Speaker A: So cool work there. Kanexapta. And of course, no hygiene with more experimental artwork. Spook show. This is posted on x. Doing quite well here. Look at all this social media reaction.
01:23:24.074 - 01:23:46.326, Speaker A: So selling a lot there, too. Shilly Preston, Trashland National park. It's great for this time of year. Another AI artwork by Shilly with kind of an animated sky here. This is posted on x. And go support Shilly, who is looking for who didn't get the job. So go buy Shilly's artwork if you're looking to support from the shadows of marginalization.
01:23:46.326 - 01:24:10.466, Speaker A: Ohkote. So cool. Kind of, again, a more painterly oak coat here, we could say, or a bit slightly more textured, we might say. There's something qualitatively, just a little bit different in the work here, but also seeming to evoke that global south motif. And here, a bunch of figures down here. Not exactly sure what's going on. Interesting AI artwork from Okote.
01:24:10.466 - 01:24:36.088, Speaker A: And almost like this Day of the dead kind of mask over here from the shadows of marginalization from the Globalso series edition of ten and 350 tazos, selling three so far. Nice work. And here is Mikey Wilson. I'm only sleeping blues. We've been talking about music today. And here, look at this great underpainting, this orange underpainting here. Really bringing life to this work.
01:24:36.088 - 01:24:58.030, Speaker A: Interesting. It's. Again, it's almost bringing like a academic painting style, the underpainting, you know, in an orange or sepia with. And then this beautiful yellow guitar with these kind of more darker colors. You know, more matte darker colors. So you get this brilliant contrast with the guitar. Something Mikey Wilson has done before.
01:24:58.030 - 01:25:20.254, Speaker A: And then outside the window here, beautiful painting. I'm only sleeping blues. 40 tazos on secondary, selling out. Great work on primary with fake whale. So that is the fake whale work. And here is Lily Illo, a corner of the studio with beautiful, just negative space here. This work is breathing again, playing with the chairs here and everything.
01:25:20.254 - 01:25:44.742, Speaker A: And you see the shadow here in the bottom. So just a cool composition here. And again, an interesting use of negative space in this one by Lily Illo, a corner of the studio. And here, as we go into the physical work in our final stretch here, this is someone I hadn't seen before. This is part of Beers London. And interesting. It's almost like you're seeing a return to a certain degree.
01:25:44.742 - 01:26:14.614, Speaker A: I feel like in some artists these days, contemporary artists, younger contemporary artists, towards this. Sort of like the beauty of the still life. Interestingly, we see it with Ruhn Christensen, that artist from the Christine Hjallardi Gallery. Right, with those flower vases. And here, Florence Stuskopf, I think, is the name of the artist. Still life with Mockingbird, 2023. Nice piece.
01:26:14.614 - 01:26:35.190, Speaker A: Very interesting. Kind of, again, kind of like a still life there. Here is that artist we were looking at who, frankly, seems like it's like a window into medieval illuminated manuscripts. Like how they did that. Taking this playing card here. You'll see where it starts. And then turning it into that whole kind of english botanical garden style.
01:26:35.190 - 01:26:57.512, Speaker A: I mean, just very impressive. Making it look so easy, right? And doing it all, like, just by hand there. So just showing, like, people still have the ability, look at that. You know, to do this craft here. Very impressive work here. Look at that. So just very impressive there.
01:26:57.512 - 01:27:20.938, Speaker A: And let's continue here. It's not gallery with another discovery here. Samson. Shepard Walwin. I just think a really interesting contrast. We saw Julian Wachtell with the Donald Duck and the photos, I think last episode here, you kind of have this religious context with this, like, anima anime manga, just like two different worlds juxtaposed. And then this kind of biblical title here, Samson.
01:27:20.938 - 01:27:36.974, Speaker A: Unless that's the title. Maybe that's. I don't know if that's the artist. Maybe that's the name of the artist. Weird place to sign it. Interesting underpainting, different treatment of style for each icon. Here's Bondozo Bandido, the account known as Bondozo Bandido.
01:27:36.974 - 01:28:05.968, Speaker A: Again, just not worrying at all about conventional, you know, what's supposed to look good. Oh, I'll put this cartoon character with massive eyes. And it really, there's just something very interesting about this artist. In the courage of this artist to just put anything they want to a certain degree and paint it however they want and whatever feels right. Very whimsical artist. And, oh, this is David Hockney. I thought this was an artist we hadn't seen before.
01:28:05.968 - 01:28:18.824, Speaker A: Wow, so this is a David Hockney. Interesting. Red flowers and greenleafs separate. May 1988. This could have been off my instagram, though, is my point. Nice, kind of. But let's look at the Hockney.
01:28:18.824 - 01:29:03.264, Speaker A: Look at this different medium here, putting, like, what's just more of like a marker or something, something that's kind of drawn on even a little bit here. But then here you have ink. So kind of a multimedia work, homemade print in colors executed on an office color copy machine on two sheets of arches paper. Wow, this is interesting, isn't it? Office color copy machine. Kind of like rezo a little bit. I mean, what is Rezo? Isn't that basically like office copy? Very interesting experimentation from the great David Hockney airbag. This was quite interesting too.
01:29:03.264 - 01:29:27.328, Speaker A: So this was just on Instagram, and you see this interesting pixelation. I wish I could bring this up. Here we go. Interesting kind of rendition of the shoe here, isn't it? And then putting it on like a bag there. So I thought that was interesting to note. And here, of course, you recognize the artist walk. You see again the dexterity, the mastery, the color, the brilliant color here.
01:29:27.328 - 01:29:43.180, Speaker A: The shoe. Is this going to be on eBay? Spray on paper times. Slam jam. So maybe this is how you. I think people are already interested in buying this beautiful work. Air Max 270. I could see there being a real market for that.
01:29:43.180 - 01:30:03.698, Speaker A: I do shoes once in a while, too. People love the shoes. And this brilliant work that walk put out with fake whale. This sold looks like Michael Jordan, doesn't it? It's like this is how good wok is. You can just put spray, but it kind of. Maybe it's the outline kind of looks like Michael Jordan. I mean, so, I mean, just amazing.
01:30:03.698 - 01:30:17.382, Speaker A: Maybe it was in the title. Free throw spray on paper, 2024. And, yeah, not sure how much that went for. Three iron, 50. Tez, I think this sold, too. So nice work by walk. And that, my friends, is your show.
01:30:17.382 - 01:30:27.934, Speaker A: Thank you once again for all of the support and the birthday wishes. That was a one of a kind experience. Hope you have a wonderful weekend. Thank you for making it this far. Till next time, take care.
