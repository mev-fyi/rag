00:00:03.920 - 00:00:30.914, Speaker A: How could I not start with this? This scene never disappoints. I mean, I've been doing this since last August. We're almost at a year here. And every day I feel like I'm coming across a masterpiece here. Artist journal, June 8, 2023. Broadcasting to the world from the apartment that I will soon leave in Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pokebelli.
00:00:30.914 - 00:00:47.164, Speaker A: Maybe TMI there. A little TMI. I am moving apartments. So in about six weeks, we're gonna have a new background here. Hopefully. It's a very tight market out there. So the hunt is on.
00:00:47.164 - 00:01:06.100, Speaker A: I have some leads, so we shall see how it goes. But let's get into things here. So time is of the essence. I am writing letters. I am applying for things, for apartments. So let's run through this. You know, the artist, I'm sure anybody, I'm sure, like, my mom would know the artist.
00:01:06.100 - 00:01:29.120, Speaker A: Of course, this is strange thing. And shout out to mom out there, gardening in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Look at this awesome, awesome piece. And, you know, sometimes, you know, the synth is such a. Like, I would almost put out more synth works, but I just feel like it's almost. I don't want to say it's too easy, but maybe I will, you know, because I. I just can't get enough of the synths pieces.
00:01:29.120 - 00:01:46.684, Speaker A: I love how it's a Casio too, actually. It's a really nice casio. I don't know if this is, like, actually based on a real synth. It looks like it's a really nice design. It's very attractive synth, isn't it? And so that is what is here. This is called, I think, renaissance melody. We'll look in a second.
00:01:46.684 - 00:02:20.186, Speaker A: A new work for. For NFT Lisbon, NFt Lisboa, as I think the locals would say. And, of course, all the trademarks of strange thing here with the beautiful Nike apparel. There's a stussy shirt. And, you know, I saw this hand here with the bluebird. And, you know, what I thought to myself was. I just wondered to myself, was that used with the Photoshop generative fill? Because I think people used to use dal E for generative fill.
00:02:20.186 - 00:02:52.366, Speaker A: And now it seems like Photoshop can do it as well. So the toolbox. Excuse me, the toolbox, it continues to expand here. So ignore AI or be skeptical of AI at your own risk as an artist is clearly what is happening here. I mean, you have to look at this. I mean, this is the sort of thing. These are the kind of brushstrokes where, when I was at the alta, Pina Kothek in Munchen, also known as Munich.
00:02:52.366 - 00:03:56.708, Speaker A: And I saw brushstrokes like this. I would say, ooh, that's a beautiful painting. Those are some beautiful brushstrokes. And, my friends, this was created by AI. I mean, we still have to kind of step back and consider the implications of that, because probably what is going to happen here, I mean, there are so many implications, but all of a sudden, you know, like, what is one implication of many? Is AI a strange thing? Is becoming a great painter, you could argue. I mean, he is, you know, without strange things, prompting and editing and whatever strange thing is doing, as well as the artists where this likely was originally sourced from, we have to admit that and, you know, recognize that nevertheless, without the intervention, we might say of strange thing. So there is a tiny little bug, a little fruit fly flying around me.
00:03:56.708 - 00:04:32.610, Speaker A: Without strange things intervention, we would, you know, we would not have this peace that also needs to be recognized. For all the skeptics of AI and saying, oh, you know, you're just putting a prompt. This is no simple prompt, as far as I can tell. And look at that. I mean, the texture, again, it kind of is kind of reminiscent of the oil painting. When you take a photo, often you'll see on Wikipedia photos of oil paintings, and they'll have several. And sometimes you get the reflection in different versions.
00:04:32.610 - 00:05:33.438, Speaker A: So there's so much going on. A nice, cool solution, which creates a great contrast here on the eyes, rather than just having some maybe distorted eyes or just a mask shielding the identity a little bit, adding some pixelation, a nice excuse for pixelation. And we have to also recognize the color here. And I think, as I always say, the magic of painting, if you really had to pick one thing, like, where is the magic of painting? It is in the color. And I think, you know, it's the thing that just hits us immediately. And we have to recognize here this astonishingly gorgeous color that we're looking at, very much the result of this wonderful contrast. You could cover this up and it would still be beautiful color, but this blue contrasting with the red here and with the background painterliness here is something to behold.
00:05:33.438 - 00:06:00.526, Speaker A: And interestingly, some, you know, sheet music here and who knows what. So just a close up of the synth there, too. Anyway, I wanted to make this a quick show. Look at this gorgeousness, though. So, you know, as they say in crypto, when, when, when Wengee clay prints, strange thing when physical work. This is a stunning work. There are others here.
00:06:00.526 - 00:06:36.032, Speaker A: I mean, how long have I spent six minutes here just marveling. It is only two ETH, and this is with super chief Gallery and Renaissance melodies. So, you know, to me, this is one of the nicest AI works I've ever seen. It really like. And we have to give strange thing credit. He keeps pushing and pushing and hustling. He may be the, you know, the guy who's hustling the most here in this entire scene.
00:06:36.032 - 00:07:10.580, Speaker A: Like, if I had to pick one person, and I find that hustle inspiring because in a sense, I think a lot of us could, you know, with that hustle, could be performing, like, you know, strange thing is bringing his a game. His a game. He is performing at what I would call, like, 110% consistently. Always doing stuff. Look at the Instagram. And so he is going for it, you know, and it's awesome. It's totally inspiring and everything.
00:07:10.580 - 00:07:33.478, Speaker A: And this, it's just beautiful, you know? So let's continue on here. A tweet, my first solo exhibition at the NFT conference in Lisbon. Congratulations. First drop since being printed in vogue Italia. Double page spread, which feels like ages ago. It was probably like a week and a half ago or something. Open editions start at noon eastern standard time.
00:07:33.478 - 00:07:46.714, Speaker A: Discover more about the world in here. So I have brought it up here. So here's. I mean, he has three works, as far as I understand. Here's another one. Fried chicken. Kind of fun.
00:07:46.714 - 00:08:04.970, Speaker A: And this is a. So this. There were additions. I'm not exactly sure how many created with additions. I don't want to lose our. Yeah, let me just go here. And I don't want to lose where we were here.
00:08:04.970 - 00:08:40.516, Speaker A: So some sort of addition. Let's look at the work. Fried chicken again, trademark with the numbers in the title. Just another beautiful work. So what I really like about strange thing is also, like, he keeps getting better. These oil painting textures keep getting more and more convincing. And my friends, like, let's not forget that wild speculation we were having here, discussing the art matter, creating the 3d oil paintings, creating oil paintings with, like, texture.
00:08:40.516 - 00:09:12.264, Speaker A: I mean, we still have to. With everything that's happening out there and with blender that can interpret two dimensional works into 3d. These may be oil paintings, yet these may become real oil paintings is the wild speculation here, which is not so wild. So just imagine, you know, just imagine. So. And you gotta love this figure here on the right. Who's looking? They look like they're eating, like, pastry or something.
00:09:12.264 - 00:09:28.730, Speaker A: Oh, it's chicken. It's chicken. It's fried chicken with Nike combined KFC with some cool sneakers here. Everything on it in an oil painted background. Little Nike swoosh. I like that. Just kind of cropped there and then.
00:09:28.730 - 00:09:49.918, Speaker A: Almost like, strange thing. Almost a signature of sorts over here with that rad that, you know, instantly identifiable rad in the curtain there. So stunning. Minted for 0.13. I am not exactly sure what is going on with this one. Let me just look again. You can still mint it.
00:09:49.918 - 00:10:11.486, Speaker A: Only one has been minted. Only one has been minted. I mean, I don't think I've ever bought AI on Ethereum, but, I mean, this is looking pretty tempting. How much time is left on this? Three days and 5 hours. I mean, pretty interesting. And here is, I believe, the last. This is also an open edition for.
00:10:11.486 - 00:10:32.542, Speaker A: For 0.1. Let me just check here. Yeah. See this? So on foundation again with super chief gallery for Lisbon, NFT. And I think it's only three works, which is pretty cool. Like, you don't need to make 15 works for a show. So I believe I could be wrong on that, just based on what I'm seeing over here.
00:10:32.542 - 00:11:20.676, Speaker A: Cultivate is another one, and it looks like we have some plants of a certain kind here and maybe some pot plants here and cannabis and a person. I mean, again, another stunning cultivate presents a man deeply engaged in the cultivation of cannabis with a renaissance landscape. The contrast invites contemplation on evolving attitudes and societal acceptance surrounding cannabis. So, interesting. We were discussing this on the spectrum faces yesterday, this idea of politics, the art as a vector for politics. Right. And how the tensions within that, you know, attempting to do that.
00:11:20.676 - 00:11:59.670, Speaker A: Because the risk, as we were saying, is that if you try and push a political thing too far, an agenda, and it's too obvious that it's basically a political message, you know, what you might even say, you know, skeptically, as masquerading as art, that it risks being didactic. And the word didactic basically means overly obvious, overly, like, to. I think it's like didactic is like, to teach. Like, it's overly kind of, you know, preachy. Preachy, we might say so here. I don't think we get that. I don't think we're getting like, it's not overly didactic.
00:11:59.670 - 00:12:53.064, Speaker A: It's actually just. And another thing we mentioned was how often it's the way to do it, seemingly without becoming overly didactic. But if you want to have, whatever issue you want to highlight is simply to kind of raise awareness, kind of point to it, without having a direct sort of moral stance and even an obvious stance one way or the other. I mean, I always think of Warhol's dollar sign is my classic example. In my mind, Warhol does the dollar sign. Is it a celebration of capitalism? Is it a critique of capitalism? I'd argue it's more just pointing to the image and the meaning of the image and all of those meanings. So in a sense, one could argue there is a certain amount of neutrality in, say, warhol's dollar sign.
00:12:53.064 - 00:13:22.130, Speaker A: So, and that's kind of how, you know, and then, so it just invites the viewer to think about what this might mean and what that image means, what that icon means to us. And that's so, you know, everybody, people make art for different reasons, and nobody has to make art for the reasons that I say. They can make them for their own reasons. And that's totally fine. But that's how I like to approach. It's more of pointing to the icons themselves as interesting, with several meanings. So there we are.
00:13:22.130 - 00:13:58.254, Speaker A: So how are we doing here? 13 minutes in and there is the poster which I wanted to highlight too. I thought it was a gorgeous poster here. Isn't it so? Strange world, strange things. Solo exhibition on view at NFC in Lisbon, dropping June 7 at noon. So not many have been minted so far. There will be three pieces in total, two open editions and a one, one of one. So I mean, considering how much open editions we're selling, the amount that we're selling like just a few months ago, like in January, it's amazing.
00:13:58.254 - 00:14:20.314, Speaker A: Those numbers aren't like at 100, but so it goes. And let's see what happens. Maybe there's opportunity for collectors there. You get a nice low edition of a strange thing. Sounds like a nice investment, not financial advice. So anyway, thank you everybody, especially Sabato and Runetune, of course, as ever for showing up to the spaces. It was super fun, super informative.
00:14:20.314 - 00:14:47.868, Speaker A: I mean, as, and no surprise there. Sabato always has something to say. He's kind of, I think, just a really great voice in, you know, this NFT digital web3 art scene. And I think he really just brings something to the table that would not be there without him being there. So a ton of people showed up. It was like an all star cast in the audience there and it was a ton of fun. So you can still play the recording.
00:14:47.868 - 00:15:25.970, Speaker A: I will upload this to YouTube once I have applied for more apartments and talked to more people, but that will go up on YouTube shortly as well. Otherwise you can go to my Twitter feed and you can find it. So thank you everybody who showed up to that just a couple of comments here. So a couple of comments on the vision pro and thank you, McRenders for the comment on his 200 bezos piece. And Jonathan Gibson, this was so. This is great. Excuse me, this is great because Jonathan Gibson has been watching this show and commenting here and there for it.
00:15:25.970 - 00:16:21.884, Speaker A: I feel like at least six months, like maybe longer. So I appreciate that, Jonathan. And so I can't read this whole thing here, but basically he worked with, as far as I understand, VR headgear and works in tech and kind of had some, you know, was working with teams that had early VR and headsets that, you know, technology for lack of a better term. I'll let you read it in the, in the comment here, but I did want to look at his last part here. I have a long history exploring this so VR as a creative outlet and think the potential is great. However, there are neurological and psychological issues with wearing headsets too long. Most developers understand this, but keep holding the issues, but keep hoping the issues will go away.
00:16:21.884 - 00:17:06.944, Speaker A: And I've heard about that too. Actually, this affects our social and physical systems. So Jonathan is saying this is a very real thing. Apple insisting on AR passthrough is one key advancement to help this, as well as the status eye signals displayed to the outside world. Once the excitement of my first immersion was marked by the clear feeling of unease at being blind and vulnerable with pure VR. So, you know, Jonathan, it seems to be suggesting that Apple has really thought this through where they don't want just the blind VR they want. That's maybe part of the reason perhaps that they are doing kind of a see through vision pro or, you know, see through goggles, so to speak.
00:17:06.944 - 00:17:33.292, Speaker A: Nobody will wear these in an office once all day. Once you find a kick me sticker has been on your back all day. So back to the blindness and, you know, suggesting. So it's interesting, a very, very interesting comment and I encourage everybody to read all this. You know, just shows how cool the crowd is that watches this show. I'm just thrilled. And another comment on the vision pro from human boy shout out.
00:17:33.292 - 00:18:01.352, Speaker A: The vision pro looks very exciting and interesting. For that price, I am $3,500 USD, so very expensive. For that price. I'm not sure when I will ever get my hands on one though. Also, I'm wondering if it will give me the same nausea or back to the nausea as my VR headset does sometimes. And highly relate with Dan control and I believe that was mint at, you know, don't worry about sales, just keep minting. Now that I've started.
00:18:01.352 - 00:18:22.016, Speaker A: I just have the determination to just keep putting out works, even if sometimes it can feel unseen. Maybe it is being made for another time and place. Well, exactly. Speaking of, thank you and thank you for showing unseen in this episode. You're welcome. And shout out to Uyo Bombadil and our friend. I think this is korean writing GM to you, my friend.
00:18:22.016 - 00:18:44.506, Speaker A: And some looks like maybe ukrainian or russian, I'm not sure. And everybody. So anyways, thanks for the comments everyone. And I can't not thank people for PP Universal. Just thank you for the comment and everybody who commented on this. I think we should all say thanks to Pokebelly for what he's doing for the community. Spreading the arts is very important and it's something that would be great.
00:18:44.506 - 00:19:04.548, Speaker A: We all do more. This brings more collector and artists to the game and we need this. End of thanks pokebelly. And end of thanks for Pokebelly. So I totally appreciate this and half the reason I wanted to show this was for my mom so my mom could be proud again. Shout out to mom. So thank you for all the comments over here, everybody.
00:19:04.548 - 00:19:54.712, Speaker A: I liked and appreciated. And, you know, it's not just, as I've mentioned several times before, this isn't simply a charity, obviously this helps me and it's great for me and it's really fun. It's almost like a different kind of tv show of sorts that we've kind of just stumbled upon almost by accident with this thing starting as a Spotify for a couple of episodes and then me speculating out loud like I am right now, saying, oh, maybe this should be a YouTube. And then Chimasuku Jackson and Mikel weighing in and saying, yeah, do a YouTube. And then, so it was kind of like just, it almost comes from the community. And, you know, as an artist, you know, it's, it's been great for me. Like, it really has been great because being an artist can be, you know, almost to human boys point and Dan control, as they were saying, mint.
00:19:54.712 - 00:20:28.146, Speaker A: Even if you're not selling, being an artist can be a pretty thankless business. And people can think you're kind of like all about yourself and everything. It's not easy, you know, being, but some people, like, they just, you know, feel compelled to do it. And I'm one of those people. And so it's really nice to actually just have a little community because the reality is, for a lot of artists is you're waking up at three in the morning and wondering if you took a wrong turn with your life as you go into your late thirties, early forties. Okay. So anyways, thank you, everybody.
00:20:28.146 - 00:20:49.994, Speaker A: It means a lot to me and it's, in many ways, it's changed my life. Like, it's, you know, it's really great. So I totally appreciate it. NFT biker so just speaking of 200 Tezos GM, it's the last day of 200 tezos. Here's some primary market stuff. Edition sold 10,868. So this is for the 200 Tezos event.
00:20:49.994 - 00:21:13.568, Speaker A: Total collected 38,000 tezos. So let's call that $35,000, maybe 1326 distinct works sold by 1006 artists. Don't be shy. Discover a new artist and collect a nice artwork today. So you can go to NFT Biker's site and he has all the 200 Tezos works listed. So that is done. I didn't realize it was done.
00:21:13.568 - 00:21:31.360, Speaker A: I guess I am too late for that. But you can always do a 200 Tezos event of your own, I suppose. Just some cool works. I don't know if this is from something that Uksine has done. There we go. I just thought, these are beautiful. I'm not sure if oxyn just made these for Twitter.
00:21:31.360 - 00:21:49.144, Speaker A: I'm not familiar with them. It could be a close up of another work, I'm not sure. Unlock the hidden secrets of verification. The ultimate guide to ensuring authenticity in a world of deception. And I just think graphically. And of course, Aksin comes from zine culture. That's part of what the name comes from, as far as I understand.
00:21:49.144 - 00:22:23.904, Speaker A: I love how he's using like, this lottery ticket, this scratch lottery ticket as a visual. And you see here, it's almost like a lotto as a visual, you know, concept to explore for his skeleton here, which is beautifully painted or, you know, drawn, painted here. Just beautifully done and great concept here. And then putting the flash underneath. Just very cool. Excuse me. One more too, just to show the inventiveness of axine, you know, here.
00:22:23.904 - 00:22:51.264, Speaker A: I mean, just common folk suffer. So I'm not sure what the, in a sense, what that means. I'm always the last to understand, actually everything. But I just thought this was brilliant and just kind of fun and interesting use of the candles here and kind of fusing in a sense, pixelation and the charts a little bit. So just cool work from Axeen on Twitter. So Dan Control, capturing the zeitgeist here. VR.
00:22:51.264 - 00:23:17.986, Speaker A: And this is available for. For tazos. Let me just maximize this. And it's interesting. Again, I really like how Dan control has, in a sense, it's not a landscape, like where the gradient is now kind of the landscape, the quote unquote landscape, so to speak, of the background. And I just think that's really smart. And even just like the circle and everything.
00:23:17.986 - 00:23:53.394, Speaker A: And of course, this looks like the vision pro, I assume, but I'm not positive on that. Let's just see. Actually, I don't think it is concept art VR. I think these are just VR goggles. So this is available for four tazos, still 17 left, edition of 20. So pretty nice work here. I think Dan Control continues to become really a virtuoso with the gradients, just as Wok is like a virtuoso with the spray paint, I think, undeniably, at least in my world, you know, Dan control is becoming a master of the gradient here.
00:23:53.394 - 00:24:13.722, Speaker A: So just cool work. Nice color. RJ with, I think a couple of more. His mint is being delayed. A little bit of his works here, but I can't wait to see them. There are a whole bunch of these kind of yellow and green works that look like a cross between. They're probably hockneys or hoppers that are being done in pastiche.
00:24:13.722 - 00:24:42.186, Speaker A: These really kind of psychological works here with, again, with his trademark edition of a laptop inside. So just cool works. I believe these are works in progress. GMGM or maybe they are finished, I'm not sure. They're beautiful. And again, that strong psychological shadow, this sense of introspection of this woman here, looking at the light and the shadow, like, profound. It's beautiful.
00:24:42.186 - 00:24:56.298, Speaker A: Very beautiful. More synthesizers. Rustic digital art. Pleasure, joy and happiness. That is exactly what these synthesizers bring. So there's the Arp odyssey. So a nice rendition here.
00:24:56.298 - 00:25:18.590, Speaker A: And I'm not sure what this one is. I feel like I should know. And there's a game boy, I think, and a little potted plant. And interestingly, the clouds kind of move. So then we get the classic kind of irrational components from rustic digital art. Sundown, I used to have a life, pleasure, joy and happiness. Pleasure, joy and happiness.
00:25:18.590 - 00:25:34.278, Speaker A: And it looks like kind of a person here. Oh, no, it's just like a blanket and pillows. And there's a laptop there too. So just cool work here from rustic digital art. This came out May 25. I missed this. So cool work here.
00:25:34.278 - 00:26:11.040, Speaker A: Only five tazos each, and they are sold out. Continuing on, l'enqueziteur, who we discovered on the Twitter spaces from a week ago where we're talking about new artists. And here is one by Linqital Tezo's soldier, Tezitos soldier, a tribute to the Tezos soldiers that work and fight hard each day. Art first. My contribution to the 200 tezos, eventually. So an army helmet with tazo soldiers on it. And interestingly, a playing card and GM.
00:26:11.040 - 00:26:31.124, Speaker A: GM. GM. You know, oftentimes, and I'm sure a lot of you guys know this, the playing card will often have the sense when it's in painting does. There is often a subtext of fate, you know, almost like when you get a tarot card or something. So anyways, cool in the grass too. So just cool work by L'Inquisiteur. There are only five left edition of 15.
00:26:31.124 - 00:26:50.764, Speaker A: And Santiago, with a kind of a different take on his massive abstracts here. A 10,000 by 11,000 pixel file. Png. This thing must. How big is this file? This must be like 15 or 20 megabytes. It could be more. So hopefully it doesn't crash the computer here.
00:26:50.764 - 00:27:30.318, Speaker A: And so just interesting work. Different composition style that's square and playing with different colors here and different kinds of shapes. This is quite interesting in here, too. I'd love to bring this up large, but it will crash my mic almost for sure. You know what? It does kind of look like kind of a similar image in different colors and then kind of, but sort of moved out of alignment, but hard to say here. Anyway, interesting work here with what looks like some cut up text, really, places and sites. So interesting work from Santiago.
00:27:30.318 - 00:27:53.246, Speaker A: And it's almost gone. It's 14 left at Fortezos. This is an interesting artist that I saw on Twitter, four chan Puella. And this was just minted here. Just kind of a different kind of work. Zeno Bambina. And so interesting use of what looks like the Photoshop canvas in the background.
00:27:53.246 - 00:28:29.184, Speaker A: And. And maybe perhaps AI of like, you know, a baby deer, so hence Bambi and almost looking like rabbits or ducks here. And with some digital kind of pixelated structure, a little bit over top. So just an interesting kind of different kind of work here. 4080 by 4080 from four Chan Puella. And here's some of the other work. Multidisciplinary artists combining three d and two d scenarios through digital collages immersed in post rave music production and noise abundance sound design techniques.
00:28:29.184 - 00:28:57.302, Speaker A: This is actually a very interesting idea. The, you know, techno, loosely called techno or, you know, digital production music, also analog. Just all that filtering and all that processing. I do feel like we're seeing an echo of that in digital art. Maybe delayed by a decade or two. Interestingly, like now it feels like it's being used. Like techno sounds were being explored in the nineties.
00:28:57.302 - 00:29:22.178, Speaker A: It's kind of how it feels like we are in digital art right now. So here are some works by four chan Puella. So cool artist, interesting kind of anime work there. And continuing on uyoh 66 with a new, instantly recognizable work as uyos. And just a cool illustration here. I haven't looked at the title yet. Kind of feels like it has a bit of a devil hell feel to it here.
00:29:22.178 - 00:29:37.106, Speaker A: We see the trident here. That looks like the devil trident and the fire in the eyes and everything. And maybe this is the soul coming in with all the demons. Let's see the escape from hell. So we are probably onto something. Cool text here. Reserve of.
00:29:37.106 - 00:30:08.440, Speaker A: .4 in the face of the guardian demon's hell, the courage to break free resides within us all. Unleash your inner strength and let the echoes of your escape reverberate through the infernal abyss. So a nice positive statement there. It's one of the things I really love about this scene, frankly. Mimocat, who's been kind of quiet lately, shows up with a collaboration with swarly art, who I don't think I've seen before. And, yeah, just some kind of illustrations of skulls.
00:30:08.440 - 00:30:39.884, Speaker A: So you can see the collab here and of course Mimocat with the cats and then the skulls and maybe some mushrooms and bubbles. So almost kind of a psychedelic subtext here. The red and white. Do they call that strophoria cubiensis? I feel like it's called something else. Playing with death. Life is like a cat, playful and curious, always ready to pounce on the next adventure. Yet we must remember that death is the looming shadow that stocks are every move.
00:30:39.884 - 00:31:12.542, Speaker A: So another meditation on death. This looks like also for the 200 tazos event. So two tezos on Swarley art and Mimocat. NFT. And here's Mimocat. Yeah, you see, Mimocat's been a little quiet, similar to Adelia, you know, interestingly, like you do, like people do talk about how the NFT space and Twitter and everything can be pretty intense. Like, what I, you know, my philosophy as far as the whole space is, I kind of come to it at my own speed.
00:31:12.542 - 00:31:58.426, Speaker A: So I'm on Twitter when I can be on Twitter, but I don't kind of kill myself to make sure that I'm on Twitter 24 hours a day or, you know, you do what you can and that's all you can do. And, you know, so almost like play it according to your own rules a little bit and who knows, maybe just taking a break for fun. Also another work by Lydia Moon, also with guru, guru hyena. The sound works, so let's see if we can get that going. Feels kind of japanese. It's so mysterious and otherworldly. I kind of love it.
00:31:58.426 - 00:32:21.254, Speaker A: And it's actually, I quite like how the UI is mixed with the kind of the portrait of sorts of the woman talking here and the interesting music. Well, you can buy it for a tezos. It's available for $0.84 edition of 200. Also for the 200 Tez event, hot pink sauce remix. Really cool work here. And a work in progress by Rinifish, which is interesting.
00:32:21.254 - 00:32:48.950, Speaker A: We've been looking at rinifish's work for the last couple of months here, and so interesting. And they're quite complex and so interesting to see. Just kind of the. I'm tempted to call the subject of the piece separated from the background a little bit. And you also see how, like, the stars are added in here, maybe at an earlier stage than you might have thought. So anyways, just cool to see rinifish in process here. And here is a memento mori.
00:32:48.950 - 00:33:23.494, Speaker A: So a remembrance of death. So the skull by Osepren, who we've seen do the video camera and the game boy. And so here's kind of a different feel to it, with a zoom in of a skull on a laptop, and then the head replaced with a flower. So interesting take on a memento mori. So again, like a sophisticated scene here on, in web3. Interesting work by demon ego here, too. So, again, kind of playing with the structure of the notebooks.
00:33:23.494 - 00:33:59.196, Speaker A: And you actually see the notebooks made small here. And so still that same overall, it's still that same kind of structure, kind of landscape structure, in terms of it being like, wide angle rather than vertical portrait. And just beautiful, actually beautiful combination of almost like these stock tickers with messages in it. And then you see this beautiful portrait here. A work that would work completely on its own very nicely, too. I mean, you gotta love the mask with the pixelation in the top right here. Really nice.
00:33:59.196 - 00:34:20.058, Speaker A: I mean, you could take an AI artwork. I mean, this is probably collage. You could take an AI thing, and you could just replace it with these pixels in the background that move and these dancing pixels. And there. Voila. So words are not enough instruction for use. Please consult your doctor so you can read everything there.
00:34:20.058 - 00:34:47.162, Speaker A: Sold out edition of 17 by demon ego. Shall we see? Only four tazos. Pretty reasonable. So nice work from demon ego. And there's also a new collection that demon ego launched. Morbus delusionalis I mean, again, you see, like Latin here. You know, this scene, it measures up just fine from my perspective, compared to the, what we might call the contemporary art scene.
00:34:47.162 - 00:35:10.474, Speaker A: Interesting kind of work here. And this almost looks like collage turned into a bitmapped or dithered image here. And with this kind of. So, kind of has a bit of a collage feel here, too. But then with some gifts movement here. Here it is online, and it's available for ten tezos. There are six left, so you can still pick this up.
00:35:10.474 - 00:35:54.278, Speaker A: Perhaps almost a popple feel to the monster there. So those could hang in the same show for sure. An interesting kind of horror vibe here with the guy almost screaming and kind of this monster figure here in the middle. This is a work that I discovered during the spaces yesterday with Sabato. I loaded up, I just did a search on Sabato, and I clearly missed this piece a couple of weeks ago. It is actually a collaboration with Pearl harbor, hyacinth remixed, fabulous monster zero two. And I just thought, as I was saying in the spaces yesterday, I mean, Sabato could make such an awesome trading card series based on what I see here using deluxe paint.
00:35:54.278 - 00:36:21.646, Speaker A: So again, retro tools. And there's also something else. I asked him about this. You see how the dithering is super small here in the background, and then here the dithering of this gradient is much larger. I think it makes a pretty interesting contrast. We saw this a little bit with Kappen and with other artists previously of. And he was basically saying, you know, as in Photoshop, he was basically, it sounded like he was trying to make things work, and that's how it turned out.
00:36:21.646 - 00:37:01.460, Speaker A: And he liked it, and that was good. But I think this top area is Photoshop as well as the bottom area, which is probably why it's not moving. But it makes also, again, it's reminiscent of Kappn in the sense that you have some areas that are moving and other areas that are static, which creates a code contrast. And you're also getting this contrast between the large dithered pixels and the small dithered pixels. Really beautiful, really interesting, because again, the default on pixel art is that it's all going to be the same size pixel. So once you start moving, it's almost like Photoshop has been added to this process, this deluxe paint process. So pretty interesting.
00:37:01.460 - 00:37:45.170, Speaker A: Muji also working with deluxe paint, and this is called contemporary fountain. Again, like, it feels like this is a reference to Duchamp and the fountain, perhaps, who knows? And here you see what looks like a kind of a retro computer here, with maybe a three and a half inch disk drive here. Beautifully done, isn't it? And I think Mewji was on the front there of objects. So cool work edition of 50. So for the 200 tezos event, 31 left at four tezos. So a ton of beautiful art here. And this is used using brilliance two by Heidi rocket, vector e fractor or vector refractor or something cool.
00:37:45.170 - 00:38:13.366, Speaker A: Another cool abstract by Haiti rocket. And look again, different size pixels. Large pixels here, small pixels here. And with that we also have that contrast of moving, dynamic, what I'd call dynamic pixels contrasted with static pixels in the green. That contrast just gives it another kind of feel. So cool work there. And let's just look at what happened here.
00:38:13.366 - 00:38:40.898, Speaker A: 50 tezos. 50 tezos. 50 tezos. And then listing canceled. So selling for a nice price there for Haiti rocket. This totally reminded me of, if you have read the atrocity exhibition, the research version, the annotated edition. There is actually in there a drawing that echoes this drawing, which is traffic, convoluted traffic.
00:38:40.898 - 00:39:05.630, Speaker A: And I think in that one it's more like it shows that these are almost like arteries, the traffic arteries of the body, though. So anyways, cool work from Green Ginger edition of 15 for $2.50. Just referring to traffic. Very, very cool. Green Ginger Mandel, who we saw with the interactive artwork. And quick correction, I got the wrong. Not a number.
00:39:05.630 - 00:39:29.196, Speaker A: There are two nans, or one is not a number and spelled out, and the other is nan. So I think I got the wrong nan. Just a heads up there. I was going to mention that imaginary space also. So this is for the 200 tezos event too. Interesting work. I mean, we have the cat looking in the mirror with goldfish.
00:39:29.196 - 00:39:50.648, Speaker A: So maybe this is actually an aquarium and not a mirror. Kind of ambiguous. And here are some portraits of maybe the family here, up there. And so just another kind of cool work, a fish on the ground. Just kind of an interesting pixel artwork. Imaginary space by manito. Now sold out.
00:39:50.648 - 00:40:17.804, Speaker A: Now on secondary for eight tazos mech txt self image. And we can start cruising a little faster here. Your self image is corrupted. So again, experimenting with text and with movement, which is interesting from mech. Txt. And this seems to be a figure in a cloak, so. And a little bit of what look like kind of Windows 95 type structures here.
00:40:17.804 - 00:40:53.292, Speaker A: So just interesting, 16 frames animated. So the offers are coming in and I don't think any have sold yet, just offers as far as I can see here. And let's speed up notan Mariana with more kidpicks works. And yeah, I will try out kidpix at some point. So just you see how beautiful and interesting it is, this software here. So this is called no roses in here. Digital collages are a way to explore with intuitive software and look for a more figurative side to the abstract art practice.
00:40:53.292 - 00:41:22.874, Speaker A: Buy now for ten tezos and they are four left on primary byte by bit gut. So also using kidpix here. So a different take on it. Bite by bits take on it. Looks like there's a burger here. And, you know, it is identif, almost identifiably bite by bit style. So it is funny to see, like, again, it does make me want to try Kidpix just to see like, will all our own individual styles come out using this kind of software, I imagine.
00:41:22.874 - 00:41:40.596, Speaker A: And also authentic waffles. And I don't know if this is Kidpix. This could be all sorts of stuff here. It's possible. This looks like just a screenshot. This is part of the Neat series, which is a series of just PFPS profile pictures. Interesting little game Boy here.
00:41:40.596 - 00:41:57.908, Speaker A: So just interesting experimentation. This sold so hasdrubal waffle. Authentic waffles. Likes to experiment with sales. And so listed at zero one, so sold in a minute. I think it's a one of one that was sold basically for a penny, less than a penny. So pretty hilarious there.
00:41:57.908 - 00:42:17.920, Speaker A: And I believe this one, it was the same thing, sold for less than a penny in 1 minute. Dan Anthony Kelly was. Did the same person get it? No. So people jumped on this again. This looks like kid pics or maybe Super Mario paint. Two neat 119 and a little bit of processing there. So interesting.
00:42:17.920 - 00:42:39.460, Speaker A: So just a whole bunch of everything in here. Just interesting work. Very interesting as ever. Another Haiti rocket with a ROM. And this is called voyage. So these roms here by Heidi Rockette seem to be getting slightly more abstract, which I think is super interesting and cool. And so almost some pyramids there in the background.
00:42:39.460 - 00:43:04.824, Speaker A: You know what it looks like to me, it almost looks like a driving game that has been completely corrupted. Like so corrupted you can't even barely tell it's a driving game. So that is pretty interesting, isn't it? Voyage. Super deluxe resolution graphics. So a new series here, and this is by Mason the third armada automata. Rom corruption. So another rom corruption here.
00:43:04.824 - 00:43:39.054, Speaker A: Another thing I'd love to try at some point. So just kind of interesting here. Kind of experimental, a little kind of cartoony kind of figure there, and just kind of flashing. And this is a one of one available for 50 tezos from Maison the third, who is an awesome artist and Guan Denarian, was just kind of a cool abstract here online. I didn't see it minted anywhere, but it may be minted somewhere. Kind of just cool gif art. Elly Pretz, who I'm not sure we've looked at before, discomposed.
00:43:39.054 - 00:44:02.650, Speaker A: And this is a video. So as we kind of go into glitch here a little bit. So just kind of interesting abstract here of just blue and white abstract glitch art. Analog work here. And here is another one, like waves. This came out in March 11. And this is an edition of ten for.
00:44:02.650 - 00:44:20.166, Speaker A: Available on secondary for 19. So this looks a little bit more like video processor. Beautiful textures here. Just a nice abstract. So Elly Pritzker, uh, as a. And here, I think so. I don't think we've shown Ellie's work before here.
00:44:20.166 - 00:44:56.356, Speaker A: So give Ellie a follow and. Yeah, so anyway, it's just a new discovery here of kind of glitch video art. Now, this one is deceptive. I was quite excited about Renky's new work here. At first I thought, well, this is a little simple. And then I realized, maybe you realized already that this work is moving slightly from right to left, is slightly moving like this. And so a really interesting minimal work kind of reminds me of that famous guy, minimalist.
00:44:56.356 - 00:45:15.428, Speaker A: What is his name? His name escapes me. He did the something fire in the National Gallery of Canada. A really famous work. We can bring that up at a certain point. It's reminiscent of, like, that 1960s and seventies conceptual minimalism here. So pretty interesting. One left for ten tezos.
00:45:15.428 - 00:45:33.340, Speaker A: So selling well too. I mean, that's pretty impressive. I mean, again, sophisticated artists, sophisticated collectors, or maybe actually. Maybe that's the only one that was minted. Okay, so none have been actually bought yet. One is available, exmortal blue calcs Walkman. So playing with retro tech here.
00:45:33.340 - 00:45:54.974, Speaker A: Let's zoom that in. And again, more kind of analog glitch. Processing hardware at work here. And of course, a lot of us remember the Sony Walkman. I assume that's what this is. And look at this by doctor version. So edition of 13, seven tazos wall, zero, zero, three.
00:45:54.974 - 00:46:23.564, Speaker A: I mean, it really has. For me, it's got a really kind of. It almost has the feeling of a de Chirico, of a Giorgio de Chirico painting, because it kind of has the same little bit of landscape style and also echo of the colors even in the orange and even just the processing of the colors. Anyways, really cool work here from Doctor version. Big shout out. Thanks for showing up to the spaces. It's always appreciated.
00:46:23.564 - 00:46:48.156, Speaker A: And here's wall number two. Some more. Just kind of interesting work, you know, deviating from the rectangle works here, just with these kind of interesting. It's tempted to call them, like, surreal landscapes, a little bit geometric, abstract surreal landscapes. If I had to really drill down on that. And here's wall zero zero one, available for eight tazos. And there's one left on primary.
00:46:48.156 - 00:47:13.870, Speaker A: So interesting work here, as ever from Doctor version. Just really rich textures. And here are some of the. So the rectangles are going somewhere as well, as you see here, these color fields of sorts. So pretty interesting. Just really rich color here in the videos by Doctor version, edition of three. And this was transferred, and there are others as well.
00:47:13.870 - 00:47:45.422, Speaker A: Speaking of abstract and color fields here, this is Kanek Zapta. So we've looked at a lot of Kanek Zapta's work in the past, and they put out this interesting work here, which makes gradients. So if I hit refresh, it kind of loads up and then it starts making gradients for you. And I'm not sure it'd be. I think it would be kind of cool if you could have a pause and a download button, but this is pretty cool. So just interesting work here. And you can just keep hitting refresh here.
00:47:45.422 - 00:48:14.540, Speaker A: And it changes the background too significantly. So this is available for. For tazos, edition of 31. There are only four left. So this interactive art thing continues to be very interesting. Sky Goodman, you know, it's only possible in the digital world, I might add, as far as. Well, actually, maybe that's not entirely true, but in terms of actually changing the work by interacting with it, generally speaking, I think we could say it's more digital than physical world.
00:48:14.540 - 00:48:35.404, Speaker A: But let's continue. Sky Goodman. A storm won. Welcome. So, you know, this also uses AI, but kind of interesting use of pixelation here in Sky Goodman's work here. And big shout out to Sky Goodman for showing up yesterday. Also, we almost had him and Sabato in discussion as well, which was awesome.
00:48:35.404 - 00:48:54.918, Speaker A: So that was cool. Edition of ten. And this sold out at ten tezos each. So paying for groceries. Very nice groceries there for Sky Goodman that just came out. And Clownvamp actually has a. This is also a solo show, so, you know, we've seen two solo shows here today.
00:48:54.918 - 00:49:28.194, Speaker A: We saw strange things at the start. And here, Clownvamp, Chester Charles, the lost grandmaster. So this is AI, of course, announcing my first ever solo show, an immersive, AI driven story. Again, kind of does these visual novels of sorts. June 21 at the Oculus World Trade center. So that is probably with super chief, I assume, produced by super rare and powered by transient labs. Ten months of work, and so check out clownvamp speed, and you can see here the process and what he is trying to do.
00:49:28.194 - 00:49:55.000, Speaker A: My love of AI is my love of remixing, the ability to break things and build things back up. But it's not just alien stories. As a gay vampire, I think AI has a unique role to play in queer art. So playing with a vampire figure, it allows us to create stories that would have, should have, and could have been. And so, anyway, beautiful work here. Look at this great AI artwork. And I think he posted, there are others here.
00:49:55.000 - 00:50:13.854, Speaker A: Kind of. It has that impressionist feel. I wish I could remember the name of the artist who was doing a lot of impressionist work that we were looking at very early on. So here's just a sample. The show that clownvamp is gonna do. And there's a very famous work by Caillebotte. The floor scrapers.
00:50:13.854 - 00:50:37.574, Speaker A: Yeah. So just cool to see clownvamp in action here. I wonder if these are fake stories or real stories. So check it out on clownvamps Twitter. And again June 21 at the Oculus World Trade center. Super rare and transient labs. And so canvas gallery as well.
00:50:37.574 - 00:51:10.722, Speaker A: You can probably guess who this is. This is Lily Illo with almost an abstract work here, but it's berries. It's interesting to see Lily illo, golden berries aftermath, to do a work without the person in it. So, like, I mean, an interesting AI still life, for lack of better term, you know, pretty interesting here, taking that style. Very interesting work. So AI. AI continues to really push the envelope here.
00:51:10.722 - 00:51:48.774, Speaker A: Again, it's like, ignore AI at your peril as an artist here. I mean, because these works continue to evolve, these artists. It's not like a one trick pony here. This is getting pretty interesting, what we're seeing here, as they get closer and closer to emulating the aesthetic that we. That we experience with physical painting. I mean, that's kind of what's really remarkable today, I'd say, with that strange thing and with this lily illo, we are getting like. It's starting to emulate the aesthetic experience of physical paintings.
00:51:48.774 - 00:52:18.702, Speaker A: That is wild. Like, that is wild. Again, you saw it in strange things, brush strokes. We see it here, and we haven't even zoomed in here. Naturalicturismo sense dance so this is a combination of digital and analog painting here. And this is, is this primary? This is on secondary for 1949. And so interesting combination here of digital and analog.
00:52:18.702 - 00:52:51.146, Speaker A: So here it looks like analog. So maybe pictures of paintings being put into works and then put into Photoshop, perhaps scanned in and who knows what and then altered after that. Digital and analog painting, collage and drawing. So interesting work there. And I'm not sure if we've looked at natural Turismo and give them a follow. Yeah, I mean, pretty look at wild Rose. This looks quite beautiful, doesn't it? And on secondary for 50 tazos.
00:52:51.146 - 00:53:11.082, Speaker A: So, yeah, it has collectors already, so always someone to discover here. Nice piece. Very nice piece here. Uh, continuing on, this is just something I saw on Instagram. Bay Anastasia. So an artist I never seen. Just thought impressive, uh, contemporary art scene artist here.
00:53:11.082 - 00:53:30.476, Speaker A: They're, I guess they're on the front of art forum. Pretty nice work. And I think I have more work by them here too. So pretty good looking painting here. And maybe that's the artist here in process. So all looking very nice there. Give them a heart.
00:53:30.476 - 00:53:50.174, Speaker A: And finally, yoao Salazar with dopamine dose, one animation frame. Plasticine painting. So just a plasticine painting. I love it by Yoao Salazar. So cool, cool work. Always great to see one of one for 200 tazos. And that is still available, I assume, on primary.
00:53:50.174 - 00:53:55.554, Speaker A: And that is your show, my friends, thank you for joining me again. Until next time, take care.
