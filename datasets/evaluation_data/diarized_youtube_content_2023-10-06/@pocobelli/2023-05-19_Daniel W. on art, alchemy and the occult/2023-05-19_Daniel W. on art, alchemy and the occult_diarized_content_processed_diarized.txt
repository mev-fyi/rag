00:00:18.960 - 00:01:02.594, Speaker A: If you've collected art on the Tezos blockchain, you've likely seen the work of our next guest, whose art covers all things esoteric, occult, alchemical, and magical. Today, we're thrilled to welcome Daniel W. To the show to discuss his art and his practice. Artist journal, May 17, 2023. Broadcasting live to the world from Berlin and New York City on Rugradio via Twitter spaces. My name is Adrian Pokebelli, and we welcome back co host, artist, and conversationalist to the show, Rune tune Roon. How is your week going?
00:01:03.214 - 00:01:08.074, Speaker B: It's going a lot better than it was last week. I've had a little bit more time to do some artwork.
00:01:09.054 - 00:01:16.074, Speaker A: Well, congratulations to that, and we can all. I need to refill my coffee, actually. Congratulations. What are you working on?
00:01:17.424 - 00:01:45.198, Speaker B: I'm working on, I mean, I feel like I'm working on about ten different things at once sometimes, uh, just, uh, exploring some more serious, uh, gifs. Uh, what I really want to do, uh, soon is get one of those infinite objects, uh, digital screens that we've talked about in previous shows. I just got to see what those look like in person. I'm, like, dying to know. So I'm trying to prepare a gift.
00:01:45.246 - 00:01:47.742, Speaker C: That I feel really good about in.
00:01:47.758 - 00:01:49.862, Speaker B: Order to get it on one of.
00:01:49.878 - 00:01:51.510, Speaker A: Those digital screens, because I feel like.
00:01:51.542 - 00:01:59.434, Speaker B: That'S truly a good way to sell digital artwork outside of just nfts.
00:02:00.334 - 00:02:07.114, Speaker A: That's so interesting. I mean, this idea of, in a sense, you're trying to sell the digital artwork as a physical piece.
00:02:08.054 - 00:02:08.874, Speaker B: Correct.
00:02:09.254 - 00:02:25.444, Speaker A: That's so interesting. There's so many permutations here. It's almost paralyzing the possibilities. So, just out of curiosity, I guess you know where to buy it. I suppose you just go to, is it infinite objects? I assume they have a website and you can just buy it. Do you know how much they are?
00:02:25.864 - 00:02:40.794, Speaker B: The cheapest one, I believe, is roughly $120. Now, I have not yet, like, made one and checked out and seen what all the fees and all of that are, but they. They say on their website, the cheapest one, which is their smallest frame, is 120.
00:02:41.854 - 00:02:52.874, Speaker A: Well, it just sounds so cool. And if you make a nice work, I bet it would look like twice as good if you put it in the. Whatever that is. I guess it's Mylar. I assume it's not glass.
00:02:53.974 - 00:02:55.314, Speaker D: I don't know if you know.
00:02:55.854 - 00:03:01.634, Speaker B: You know, I actually. I don't know. It could be epoxy. It could be Mylar. I'm not really sure. It could be some type of resin.
00:03:02.254 - 00:03:15.404, Speaker A: Sure. Yeah, I mean, I'll be fascinating to hear what happens there. You do that. And so. Yeah. Okay, well, that sounds great. And congratulations on making some art for me.
00:03:15.404 - 00:03:30.024, Speaker A: I have not made any art. I had the classic kind of Berlin situation. We're always looking for a place to live. I have to find a new place to live. So there will be a new background. I know. I imagine it's as bad in New York as Berlin.
00:03:30.024 - 00:03:36.210, Speaker A: I mean, it's extremely tight. I have a couple of good leads, though, so that is good.
00:03:36.402 - 00:03:37.082, Speaker C: But, yeah.
00:03:37.138 - 00:03:39.314, Speaker A: So not much art getting done this.
00:03:39.354 - 00:03:39.934, Speaker D: Week.
00:03:42.554 - 00:04:03.382, Speaker A: But that's okay. That's okay. It's just part of what it is to live in these cities, as you know. So I'm thrilled to welcome Daniel W. To the show. Daniel, you know, I've seen your work for, like, ever since I started, you know, perusing the, you know, tezos blockchain and object from very early on. You're just distinguished style and everything.
00:04:03.382 - 00:04:14.750, Speaker A: So I'm extremely thrilled for you to come here. Tell us, where are you calling from, if you don't mind me asking? And you might be on mute.
00:04:14.862 - 00:04:16.634, Speaker D: Oh. Oh, my God.
00:04:17.414 - 00:04:17.766, Speaker E: Okay.
00:04:17.790 - 00:04:18.630, Speaker D: Can you hear me?
00:04:18.782 - 00:04:20.474, Speaker A: I can hear you loud and clear.
00:04:21.174 - 00:04:22.234, Speaker C: Okay, cool.
00:04:22.574 - 00:04:27.754, Speaker E: I'm in. So, Paulo, Brazil. Brazil's ashtray, as we call it.
00:04:28.744 - 00:04:30.976, Speaker C: And, hey, how are you guys doing?
00:04:31.120 - 00:04:32.128, Speaker D: Glad to be here.
00:04:32.256 - 00:04:33.120, Speaker A: Doing great.
00:04:33.232 - 00:04:35.392, Speaker D: Very excited to talk to you and.
00:04:35.448 - 00:04:37.364, Speaker B: Dive into some horror genre.
00:04:37.984 - 00:04:39.204, Speaker C: Oh, yeah, definitely.
00:04:40.184 - 00:04:40.656, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:04:40.720 - 00:04:40.968, Speaker C: So.
00:04:41.016 - 00:04:47.564, Speaker A: Well, that's super cool. I've never heard of Brazil's ashtray before. Is that close to Rio de Janeiro?
00:04:48.744 - 00:04:51.204, Speaker E: Around 4 hours from Rio.
00:04:51.784 - 00:04:52.568, Speaker D: Okay.
00:04:52.696 - 00:04:54.524, Speaker C: Wow. It's kind of far.
00:04:55.894 - 00:05:10.554, Speaker A: And just out of curiosity, I'm kind of. Because I come from Canada and also living in Germany here, where the weather kind of sucks often. How is the weather out there? I mean, I guess it's turning into fall right now.
00:05:11.254 - 00:05:24.220, Speaker E: Right now it's cold as hell. I mean, it's really cold. I mean, it's sunny, but it's super cold. But, I mean, we just came out, like, some really hot days a couple.
00:05:24.252 - 00:05:30.784, Speaker C: Of months ago, so, you know, we're switching it up now, and it's super hellishly cold now.
00:05:31.644 - 00:05:32.180, Speaker D: Interesting.
00:05:32.212 - 00:05:47.664, Speaker A: And hellishly cold is probably, like, a nice, balmy 15 degrees, I imagine, in Brazil, but I'm just joking. I mean, I come from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Let me tell you. Cold is, like, I don't know if you do celsius, but it's -30 degrees.
00:05:48.464 - 00:05:56.496, Speaker E: Oh, no. Yeah. I mean, it's no comparison to Canada, obviously. Cold for us is like, you know, like you said, 15 degrees. It's already super fucking cold for us.
00:05:56.600 - 00:06:40.714, Speaker A: Okay? You guys are spoiled out there. So anyways, tell us what you're up to in terms of, like, you know, I've seen your drawings and everything, and it seems like you're focused mostly on this illustrative style. And so, you know, you can instantly recognize your work because you really focus. There's a real kind of trademark look to it, which is great. It's instantly recognizable as yours. So tell us a little bit about your background. Like, did you study art? And, you know, tell us from the, you know, a little bit, not too long, but from the beginning, like, how did you get into art? And, you know, what are you, what are you trying to do? And just what motivated you? How did you get into art?
00:06:41.974 - 00:06:43.474, Speaker E: I've never been.
00:06:44.734 - 00:06:48.398, Speaker C: I've never officially studied, but I've always been.
00:06:48.526 - 00:06:55.110, Speaker E: Ever since I was a kid, I was always that kid who draws. There's always that kid in the classroom.
00:06:55.222 - 00:06:57.406, Speaker C: That spends the whole day drawing and.
00:06:57.430 - 00:06:58.878, Speaker E: Not paying attention and stuff.
00:06:59.006 - 00:07:10.496, Speaker C: That was me, and I didn't stop, and I'd like to, when I was a kid, really, like, copying the cartoons.
00:07:10.520 - 00:07:12.880, Speaker E: I watch or the comics I read.
00:07:13.032 - 00:07:13.724, Speaker D: And.
00:07:16.744 - 00:07:31.400, Speaker C: My bad, then, well, a few years later, I stopped drawing for a bit because I started focusing on music. I had a band for, like, ten years or so, and then after that.
00:07:31.432 - 00:07:33.104, Speaker E: I started, I came back to drawing.
00:07:33.144 - 00:07:35.688, Speaker C: I said, okay, let's go back to my initial thing.
00:07:35.816 - 00:07:37.768, Speaker E: And that's when I started drawing online.
00:07:37.816 - 00:07:39.404, Speaker C: Comics for.
00:07:41.664 - 00:07:43.088, Speaker E: Like, around seven years.
00:07:43.176 - 00:07:57.472, Speaker C: Seven years or something. And right after that, that was right before getting into nfTs, I started working as a freelance animator, specifically doing music.
00:07:57.528 - 00:07:59.604, Speaker E: Videos for local rap acts.
00:08:00.084 - 00:08:00.824, Speaker D: And.
00:08:01.444 - 00:08:03.436, Speaker C: And it was, it was fun, but.
00:08:03.540 - 00:08:10.744, Speaker E: Music industry can be a pain in the ass. And, like, around 2020, 2021.
00:08:11.404 - 00:08:12.224, Speaker D: Ish.
00:08:14.644 - 00:08:15.564, Speaker C: 2021.
00:08:15.644 - 00:08:21.624, Speaker E: Yeah, I got into nfts. I got onboarded onto tezos, and.
00:08:25.304 - 00:08:25.616, Speaker D: Like.
00:08:25.640 - 00:08:26.404, Speaker E: I said.
00:08:28.864 - 00:08:29.924, Speaker D: Is taser.
00:08:31.624 - 00:08:47.124, Speaker C: Yes, yes. Because I had worked with a local rapper called Nil, and I did a couple of videos for him, and a bit later, he released another song, and.
00:08:47.544 - 00:08:52.032, Speaker E: He had this really cool 3d video for it. And I went to talk to the.
00:08:52.048 - 00:08:54.880, Speaker C: Guy because I usually like to link.
00:08:54.912 - 00:08:56.656, Speaker E: Up with the people who, in the.
00:08:56.680 - 00:09:05.656, Speaker C: Same scene, you know, for collabs and such. And his name. My bad.
00:09:05.680 - 00:09:07.804, Speaker E: I'm still kind of. Still kind of shy.
00:09:09.064 - 00:09:14.884, Speaker A: All good, all good. We're all running on empty here. Daniel W. So, all good.
00:09:15.704 - 00:09:20.848, Speaker E: No problem. And, uh, this guy Scotia, his name.
00:09:20.976 - 00:09:21.336, Speaker D: He.
00:09:21.400 - 00:09:22.804, Speaker E: And he was, um.
00:09:23.304 - 00:09:28.616, Speaker C: And he was involved right in the beginning of the original hen, and I.
00:09:28.640 - 00:09:36.844, Speaker E: Saw that he posted a few things about crypto art, nfts and such, and I had no idea what that was. And I was, yeah, around the beginning of 2021.
00:09:37.144 - 00:09:38.176, Speaker C: And I went to talk to him.
00:09:38.200 - 00:09:40.964, Speaker E: And he gave me the rundown about everything.
00:09:41.344 - 00:09:43.656, Speaker C: And I was like, okay, cool then.
00:09:43.760 - 00:09:53.154, Speaker E: But I kind of brushed it off at first. But then a few weeks later, I remember him, another friend, posting a few.
00:09:53.194 - 00:09:55.974, Speaker C: Things, and he was posting on Opensea.
00:09:56.554 - 00:10:06.402, Speaker E: And I asked him again and he told me and he explained it a bit better. And I was like, oh, damn, that sounds interesting. I mean, selling digital art, especially as.
00:10:06.418 - 00:10:11.990, Speaker C: An animator, you know, because as an animator, the only way you can actually.
00:10:12.182 - 00:10:14.710, Speaker E: Make some money is by being involved in projects.
00:10:14.742 - 00:10:18.302, Speaker C: So the whole perspective of being able.
00:10:18.358 - 00:10:22.206, Speaker E: To sell animation loops and, you know.
00:10:22.350 - 00:10:27.714, Speaker C: Like illustrators sell prints and such, that was really appealing for me.
00:10:29.614 - 00:10:32.294, Speaker E: But I took a look at Opensea.
00:10:32.334 - 00:10:35.110, Speaker C: It was kind of, okay, cool, I'll.
00:10:35.142 - 00:10:39.324, Speaker E: Brush it later, leave it for later. And I went to talk to kosher.
00:10:39.364 - 00:10:42.900, Speaker C: Again, and, and he said, okay, hop.
00:10:42.932 - 00:10:44.996, Speaker E: Onto discord and we'll, and I'll explain.
00:10:45.020 - 00:10:45.984, Speaker C: It better to you.
00:10:46.284 - 00:10:49.620, Speaker E: And he explained the whole thing to me. It was a, I think it was.
00:10:49.732 - 00:10:54.584, Speaker C: Two, three days before they released the original hen.
00:10:56.204 - 00:10:58.188, Speaker E: And, yes, everything he said, okay, here.
00:10:58.316 - 00:11:02.124, Speaker C: Well, you were very, yeah, super early.
00:11:02.164 - 00:11:02.868, Speaker D: Super early.
00:11:02.996 - 00:11:05.104, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, before hen started.
00:11:05.824 - 00:11:06.944, Speaker D: Mm hmm, mm hmm.
00:11:07.064 - 00:11:07.872, Speaker E: Yeah, super early.
00:11:07.928 - 00:11:19.048, Speaker C: And then explain everything to me. And he said, oh, here, have three tezos so you can start out. And I'm like, oh, cool, dude, I'll pay you back. I say, no, it's okay.
00:11:19.096 - 00:11:21.816, Speaker E: Just, you know, on board a couple other people do the same thing with.
00:11:21.840 - 00:11:26.328, Speaker C: Them and it's all good. Okay, cool. He was, he was, he goes, a.
00:11:26.336 - 00:11:27.484, Speaker E: Really cool guy, dude.
00:11:28.304 - 00:11:31.720, Speaker C: And then at first, I kind of.
00:11:31.832 - 00:11:34.372, Speaker E: Minted it sporadically, you know, I had.
00:11:34.388 - 00:11:37.036, Speaker C: A few pieces laying around that I.
00:11:37.060 - 00:11:41.824, Speaker E: Posted to ig, and I thought, okay, let's try it out. Then I minted a few animations.
00:11:42.284 - 00:11:48.356, Speaker C: And it was funny because every now and then I'd go back, like a.
00:11:48.380 - 00:11:57.452, Speaker E: Couple of months and see that a few things had sold, and I was like, oh, cool. And it was funny because it was specifically at times where I was kind.
00:11:57.468 - 00:11:59.680, Speaker C: Of strapped for cash and I'd go.
00:11:59.712 - 00:12:00.832, Speaker E: Back to my wallet and see, oh.
00:12:00.848 - 00:12:04.816, Speaker C: Shit, you know, oh, cool, made some money here, can pay the bills.
00:12:05.000 - 00:12:08.484, Speaker E: And, and I was sort of starting to get kind of.
00:12:11.184 - 00:12:19.764, Speaker C: Disillusioned with the whole animation gigs I was doing because, like, I said, music industry can be a pain in the ass.
00:12:20.544 - 00:12:31.294, Speaker A: Yeah. And I assume you're doing, like, contract work, too. And, like, half the battle with contract work is getting paid half the time. Time. Yep. Right. Yeah, yeah.
00:12:31.414 - 00:12:34.014, Speaker C: So, yeah, that's the thing, though. Good.
00:12:34.054 - 00:12:34.574, Speaker A: Go ahead.
00:12:34.654 - 00:12:36.182, Speaker E: Oh, sorry, sorry. No, sorry, sorry.
00:12:36.198 - 00:12:36.830, Speaker D: Go ahead.
00:12:36.982 - 00:12:41.342, Speaker A: I was just going to say, especially in the music industry, it must be very difficult. Yes, continue.
00:12:41.438 - 00:12:42.274, Speaker C: Oh, yeah.
00:12:42.814 - 00:12:43.574, Speaker D: Yes.
00:12:43.734 - 00:12:54.714, Speaker E: And the thing is, though, I mean, contract work was a bit less than half of the work it was doing. The other half was mostly underground artists, so there's not much contract involved, though, so.
00:12:55.014 - 00:13:03.506, Speaker C: And the thing wasn't even being paid because I was. But the thing is how I was paid. I mean, it started getting me pissed.
00:13:03.530 - 00:13:04.906, Speaker E: Off because you had all these guys.
00:13:05.010 - 00:13:25.310, Speaker C: With flashy clothes and, you know, and chains and whatnot, and. But the guys would pay me, like, ridiculously low prices. That was fucking awful. So it started getting kind of. Kind of disillusioned with the whole thing. And I thought, well, let's jump into this.
00:13:25.502 - 00:13:27.494, Speaker E: And I think it was around 2020.
00:13:27.574 - 00:13:34.550, Speaker C: By the end of 2021, that I started taking it a bit more seriously.
00:13:34.702 - 00:13:36.314, Speaker E: That's when I invented my.
00:13:38.174 - 00:13:39.062, Speaker D: One of the first ones.
00:13:39.078 - 00:13:40.422, Speaker E: I meant. Let me just check it out here.
00:13:40.478 - 00:13:41.234, Speaker C: My bad.
00:13:42.054 - 00:13:44.114, Speaker E: The principles of beautiful made fresh.
00:13:46.174 - 00:13:52.034, Speaker A: I'm looking on your page here. So if I go to the oldest, I see the vessel. Does that make sense to you?
00:13:52.194 - 00:13:52.794, Speaker D: Yes.
00:13:52.914 - 00:14:08.562, Speaker E: That was the first one that I minted as a test. I said, look, let's try it out. Because I made this animation, and a friend of mine, he had just found this VCR and a camera he had.
00:14:08.578 - 00:14:10.770, Speaker C: At home, and I said, oh, cool.
00:14:10.922 - 00:14:12.562, Speaker E: Yeah, let's run the animation through that.
00:14:12.578 - 00:14:14.786, Speaker C: And let's see how it goes. And it came out really cool.
00:14:14.810 - 00:14:18.996, Speaker E: I really like the result. But, you know, it was like one.
00:14:19.020 - 00:14:24.980, Speaker C: Year just gathering dust in my instagram. And I thought, well, let's try to.
00:14:25.132 - 00:14:28.668, Speaker E: Turn this into something. Most of my first pieces were, like.
00:14:28.716 - 00:14:42.256, Speaker C: Pieces that were just sitting around the Instagram. And I thought, well, let's just see where this goes. And it started selling, and then I decided to do the redux collection, which.
00:14:42.280 - 00:14:48.752, Speaker E: I had done a few pieces on Instagram. And I thought, let's turn this into a legit collection. And that's when things kind of, kind.
00:14:48.768 - 00:14:55.952, Speaker C: Of went off, when I started taking it seriously, and I said, okay, fuck this freelance gig. Let's focus on this now.
00:14:56.088 - 00:14:58.564, Speaker E: And it's been kind of like this ever since.
00:14:59.144 - 00:15:34.934, Speaker A: That's amazing. And from what I understand, I mean, this is like, you kind of went full time on this to a certain degree. Like, that's impressive. I mean, because not many people actually go full time on this. I mean, that. But I mean, I guess it's all relative, right? Like, if you have kind of these, like, I totally, I feel your pain, you know, dealing with contract work in the past, and so all of a sudden it's like, well, this isn't so bad, you know, and so that's cool. And I assume the money goes a little further somewhere in, say, Brazil compared to maybe the US or, you know.
00:15:34.974 - 00:15:37.320, Speaker D: Oh, definitely, right? Yeah, definitely.
00:15:37.352 - 00:15:44.376, Speaker E: I mean, it's one of the advantages of living in a third world country. I mean, it's, it can, this can.
00:15:44.400 - 00:15:46.056, Speaker C: Be a job for me, you know?
00:15:46.200 - 00:15:49.704, Speaker E: And I mean, definitely money was a. Was a huge aspect for me, but.
00:15:49.744 - 00:16:02.224, Speaker C: Also the creative freedom of the whole thing was what caught me, you know, because even though I was working with.
00:16:02.304 - 00:16:04.744, Speaker E: Music videos and I had a certain.
00:16:04.784 - 00:16:07.600, Speaker C: Degree of creative freedom, I was always.
00:16:07.632 - 00:16:14.624, Speaker E: Dealing with a client. So, you know, I always had to wait for somebody's okay. And the last three jobs I did.
00:16:14.664 - 00:16:18.564, Speaker C: Before just leaving the whole thing, I.
00:16:19.904 - 00:16:22.304, Speaker E: Had a couple of misunderstandings with the clients.
00:16:22.344 - 00:16:26.164, Speaker C: So that kind of rubbed me wrong.
00:16:27.304 - 00:16:29.520, Speaker E: So the whole prospect of just being.
00:16:29.552 - 00:16:32.928, Speaker C: Able to create freely without having to.
00:16:33.056 - 00:16:35.536, Speaker E: Worry about the input of clients and.
00:16:35.560 - 00:16:38.104, Speaker C: Such, that was just, it was just.
00:16:38.144 - 00:16:45.136, Speaker E: Amazing because if you see, my whole first year, it was just me trying stuff out just like, okay, now I'm.
00:16:45.160 - 00:16:47.136, Speaker C: Gonna, you know, do some redux pieces.
00:16:47.200 - 00:16:48.704, Speaker E: Or now I'm gonna do some mushrooms.
00:16:48.744 - 00:16:52.296, Speaker C: And now I'm gonna, you know, just trying shit out.
00:16:52.440 - 00:16:56.096, Speaker E: Cuz it was, it wasn't, it still is fun as hell.
00:16:56.120 - 00:17:01.132, Speaker C: I mean, to be able to just create what you feel like and be.
00:17:01.148 - 00:17:02.172, Speaker E: Able to make a living out of.
00:17:02.188 - 00:17:04.700, Speaker C: It, I mean, half, more than half.
00:17:04.732 - 00:17:06.404, Speaker E: Of these things I've made would probably.
00:17:06.444 - 00:17:11.184, Speaker C: Just be sitting in my instagram for like years and not turn into anything.
00:17:11.764 - 00:17:45.185, Speaker A: Well. And another thing that I like about it is like, I mean, I bet you feel like you're making work that you might not have made because all of a sudden you kind of have to make some work, right? And I think that mushroom, that mushroom series, I think is the first thing I collected from you and I think, yeah, it was great. I mean, I loved that series. It was so fun and it was so kind of easy to collect because all of a sudden it's like there at the start so I could buy all of them as they came out. It was kind of fun. To try and get the ones you might have missed, and then you get the bonus one at the end. That was a great.
00:17:45.249 - 00:17:47.857, Speaker C: Yeah, that's cool. Yeah, that was fun to do.
00:17:47.905 - 00:17:48.545, Speaker E: That was fun to do.
00:17:48.569 - 00:17:53.022, Speaker C: That was, that was partially me experimenting.
00:17:53.078 - 00:17:59.566, Speaker E: And partially me challenging myself as well. Because you mentioned style. I've been like most artists, I've been.
00:17:59.590 - 00:18:02.470, Speaker C: My whole life trying to find my style.
00:18:02.582 - 00:18:05.246, Speaker E: And right before getting on boarded on.
00:18:05.270 - 00:18:07.886, Speaker C: To tazos, I kind of found a.
00:18:07.910 - 00:18:12.350, Speaker E: Place there that I thought, okay, this looks good.
00:18:12.382 - 00:18:16.206, Speaker C: I'm kind of not exactly satisfied with.
00:18:16.230 - 00:18:17.494, Speaker E: What I found here, but I think.
00:18:17.534 - 00:18:18.634, Speaker C: This is a path.
00:18:19.124 - 00:18:33.624, Speaker E: So that's when I started doing the redux pieces to sort of challenge myself to be able to draw anything I want in my style. So the mushrooms kind of came about.
00:18:35.404 - 00:18:37.892, Speaker C: Sort of like, as a challenge as well.
00:18:37.908 - 00:18:41.372, Speaker E: I mean, I'm super fond of mushrooms. I think they're super fascinating.
00:18:41.508 - 00:18:43.236, Speaker C: And I thought, okay, let's try to.
00:18:43.260 - 00:18:47.604, Speaker E: Do some fucking mushrooms, you know, and being super fun.
00:18:48.304 - 00:18:55.084, Speaker A: I love how the psychedelic ones always catch the premium too. Those are the ones that are worth the most.
00:18:56.824 - 00:18:59.416, Speaker E: Yeah, I guess people just love some trippy shit.
00:18:59.440 - 00:19:25.044, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, exactly. Now on the mushrooms and actually on everything, before I forget, I just want to bring this up just on the color. Like, I find that conceptually interesting because it seems like you're using, like, a CMYK color scheme. Is that the kind of a print sort of feel? Can you speak a little bit? Just about maybe the colors and even just like, that print aspect of your work?
00:19:25.504 - 00:19:26.800, Speaker C: Oh, sure, yeah.
00:19:26.992 - 00:19:28.844, Speaker E: Well, the colors, they came about.
00:19:31.144 - 00:19:32.320, Speaker C: Limitations, you know?
00:19:32.392 - 00:19:44.164, Speaker E: I mean, I have a serious issue with making choices, and especially when it comes to colors, there's, like, so many colors. So I just, I just thought, well.
00:19:44.344 - 00:19:56.676, Speaker C: How about if I just limit my palette to four colors and that'll make it easier for me. And if I need one thing or another in a different color, then I'll, you know, just.
00:19:56.740 - 00:20:00.572, Speaker E: Just use it. But let's try to make everything based.
00:20:00.628 - 00:20:05.584, Speaker C: On these four colors and the whole print deal.
00:20:06.244 - 00:20:08.164, Speaker E: I have this weird thing where whenever.
00:20:08.204 - 00:20:19.298, Speaker C: I'm painting on canvas, I try to make it as, for lack of a better word, as digital as possible, because.
00:20:19.346 - 00:20:29.194, Speaker E: I try to make the line super straight and the color super flat. And when I'm working digitally, I try to make it as organic as possible.
00:20:29.354 - 00:20:31.386, Speaker C: I think it stems from that whole.
00:20:31.410 - 00:20:36.066, Speaker E: Deal of me challenging myself to do certain things I view as a way.
00:20:36.090 - 00:20:39.114, Speaker C: Of challenging my creativity.
00:20:39.614 - 00:20:43.118, Speaker E: And I've always liked it when I've.
00:20:43.166 - 00:20:46.990, Speaker C: Seen animators and illustrators making digital art.
00:20:47.022 - 00:20:50.302, Speaker E: That looks super, super organic, especially animation.
00:20:50.478 - 00:20:54.954, Speaker C: I love seeing digital animation that looks traditional.
00:20:56.294 - 00:21:07.104, Speaker E: It kind of went from there. But the whole CMyk thing is definitely due to me limiting myself to make it easier to choose colors.
00:21:08.484 - 00:21:33.144, Speaker A: It's kind of funny, it kind of creates this natural limitation. Like, you know, it's just something that you start out with, but then it kind of stuck, it seems, it seems like, and before I just pass it on to runtoon here, tell me a little bit about the canvases. So you actually, like, you mean you're an animator, but do you actually, I mean, were you making canvases, you were saying, and do you actually make paintings and whatnot?
00:21:33.694 - 00:21:34.474, Speaker D: Yes.
00:21:35.134 - 00:21:39.994, Speaker E: Throughout the pandemic, I was painting a lot. It was a way of me to.
00:21:41.414 - 00:21:43.222, Speaker C: Sort of get my head off things.
00:21:43.398 - 00:21:59.102, Speaker E: Because I already had my kid then. We were expecting our second kid, and everything was just stressful with the whole pandemic. So I thought, man, I got to find something that isn't my work. Because the thing about working with art.
00:21:59.158 - 00:22:02.052, Speaker C: Is that it always starts out as a hobby.
00:22:02.108 - 00:22:11.044, Speaker E: Then it becomes your job. Then all of a sudden, you notice you don't have a hobby anymore because your hobby become your job. So it kind of fucks up your.
00:22:11.084 - 00:22:12.628, Speaker C: Mind a bit, I think.
00:22:12.796 - 00:22:14.084, Speaker E: So I thought, well, let me just.
00:22:14.164 - 00:22:17.220, Speaker C: Start painting then, because back then I was just animating.
00:22:17.292 - 00:22:18.900, Speaker E: So I thought, if I start painting.
00:22:19.012 - 00:22:28.632, Speaker C: It'Ll be something that involves art, but isn't my job, so I can still create and draw. And I started thinking back then, I think 2020.
00:22:28.728 - 00:22:45.408, Speaker E: Yeah, it was around 2020, but I did a couple of paintings. I sold a couple of paintings back then, but after I got back to, after I got into nfts, I sort of stopped.
00:22:45.536 - 00:22:53.954, Speaker C: But I've been planning to go back in the near future because it's fun, it's super therapeutic to lay down some paint.
00:22:54.814 - 00:23:13.874, Speaker B: One thing I love is just, like, your stuff is so recognizable, and a lot of times when you're doing this, like, referential work, like, you know, in reference to either a movie or a famous piece of artwork, it just feels very natural and it's so polished that it feels like it belongs to you, you know?
00:23:14.654 - 00:23:15.294, Speaker C: Thanks.
00:23:15.414 - 00:23:20.352, Speaker B: You know, some, some of the works that I'm most interested, interested in, of the stuff that you do in are.
00:23:20.368 - 00:23:24.160, Speaker C: These kind of like, surreal horror movie.
00:23:24.232 - 00:23:29.004, Speaker B: Sorts of like, settings with, like, interiors and apartments and houses and stuff.
00:23:29.304 - 00:23:32.800, Speaker C: What is, uh, what was kind of.
00:23:32.832 - 00:23:34.560, Speaker B: The, uh, the initial, like, what, what.
00:23:34.592 - 00:23:36.524, Speaker A: Are your inspirations behind that?
00:23:37.504 - 00:23:46.220, Speaker E: Um, well, I've always been a huge horror buff. I love, um, not necessarily only horror.
00:23:46.252 - 00:23:53.516, Speaker C: But I love how people are able to pull certain feelings through art and.
00:23:53.540 - 00:24:00.024, Speaker E: Make people feel things, especially when it comes to both comedy and horror.
00:24:00.724 - 00:24:03.444, Speaker C: I find it very interesting when people.
00:24:03.484 - 00:24:05.364, Speaker A: Yeah, both those genres kind of operate.
00:24:05.404 - 00:24:06.944, Speaker B: In the same way, don't they?
00:24:07.244 - 00:24:08.676, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, they do, they do.
00:24:08.780 - 00:24:24.754, Speaker E: It's so visceral and it just gets to you. I've always been fascinated with, with people, with seeing good horror artists or seeing good comedy artists doing their thing, and you just see it and you feel something. And it's always been kind of frustrating.
00:24:24.794 - 00:24:25.894, Speaker C: For me, in a way.
00:24:26.194 - 00:24:36.534, Speaker E: Doubly frustrating, actually, because I've always been kind of bad at drawing backgrounds and I've always had this cartoony kind of.
00:24:39.074 - 00:24:43.204, Speaker C: Style which doesn't fit very well in the horror genre.
00:24:43.584 - 00:24:55.200, Speaker B: Yeah, illustration can be rough because, you know, background, sometimes you're trying to make something recessive, but with like, graphic style, it's like everything's kind of, you know, dominant aside from small detail.
00:24:55.272 - 00:25:00.400, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, exactly. So, but so it came back to.
00:25:00.432 - 00:25:03.480, Speaker E: Me kind of challenging myself again. I said, okay, let's.
00:25:03.552 - 00:25:15.060, Speaker C: Let me try to make something disturbing and at the same time challenge myself to draw backgrounds because I've never been.
00:25:15.092 - 00:25:16.836, Speaker E: Able to draw backgrounds properly, but I've.
00:25:16.860 - 00:25:20.036, Speaker C: Always been fascinated by drawing backgrounds, especially.
00:25:20.100 - 00:25:30.424, Speaker E: Since six or seven years ago, I read this manga called blame by Tsutomo Nihei, if I'm not mistaken, and.
00:25:31.184 - 00:25:33.216, Speaker C: And what caught me about that manga.
00:25:33.240 - 00:25:35.544, Speaker E: In specific, it's an action manga and.
00:25:35.584 - 00:25:39.280, Speaker C: So on, but it's super silent and.
00:25:39.432 - 00:25:43.484, Speaker E: There'S characters, but the main character of the whole story is.
00:25:45.504 - 00:25:46.760, Speaker C: The scenario.
00:25:46.952 - 00:25:55.552, Speaker E: Because if I'm not mistaken, the artist used to be an architect, so he puts a lot of emphasis on the backgrounds.
00:25:55.728 - 00:25:58.264, Speaker C: And the backgrounds kind of tell much.
00:25:58.304 - 00:26:04.792, Speaker E: More story than the characters themselves, which many pages, they'll just be silent and.
00:26:04.848 - 00:26:07.096, Speaker C: You'Ll just kind of have to piece.
00:26:07.120 - 00:26:14.152, Speaker E: It together by what you see on the background. And that kind of caught me. I've never, before that, I had never.
00:26:14.208 - 00:26:22.696, Speaker C: Seen backgrounds in that sort of light as a way of telling or passing.
00:26:22.800 - 00:26:25.444, Speaker E: A feeling or telling a story.
00:26:25.994 - 00:26:33.814, Speaker C: And I've always had this, how can I say it? Places.
00:26:34.154 - 00:27:01.658, Speaker E: I have this uncanny valley feeling with places, especially when they. Especially when they used to be lived in. I've always found it weird whenever I moved out of places and I finished taking everything out of the apartment or the house and seeing the house all empty after spending years there with, you know, the couch and the tv and, you know, so on and so forth. It always struck me as kind of.
00:27:01.666 - 00:27:03.074, Speaker C: Odd ever since I was a kid.
00:27:03.234 - 00:27:03.934, Speaker D: And.
00:27:08.434 - 00:27:09.774, Speaker C: How can I put it?
00:27:12.114 - 00:27:14.346, Speaker E: It's odd and it's kind of eerie.
00:27:14.370 - 00:27:15.346, Speaker C: In a way, for me.
00:27:15.450 - 00:27:24.082, Speaker E: And I thought, okay, well, let's try to create some sort of horror out.
00:27:24.098 - 00:27:28.134, Speaker C: Of that, or not necessarily horror, but something unsettling.
00:27:29.234 - 00:27:41.914, Speaker E: That's when I started trying to create these pieces. And I've always been sort of inspired by old nineties eighties adventure, pc adventure.
00:27:41.954 - 00:27:44.270, Speaker C: Pc games, first person.
00:27:44.422 - 00:27:54.662, Speaker E: And that always relied heavily on backgrounds. And I always thought those were kind of uncanny as well because they're there, but they're so devoid of life and.
00:27:54.678 - 00:27:56.638, Speaker C: It just feels weird.
00:27:56.686 - 00:27:59.814, Speaker E: And I, and I like the weird feeling they, they give off.
00:27:59.974 - 00:28:03.470, Speaker C: You know, it's it's like, you know.
00:28:03.502 - 00:28:08.638, Speaker B: The, the empty space kind of like leaves a lot of room for the imagination, you know?
00:28:08.686 - 00:28:21.512, Speaker E: Exactly. Exactly. And it kind of worked as a counterbalance for me because most of my pieces tend to be full of information. I like to fill the whole thing with information sometimes, and they tend to.
00:28:21.528 - 00:28:36.404, Speaker C: Be colorful and whatnot. And the other part of the challenge of making these more horror inspired pieces is trying to work with emptiness and stillness.
00:28:37.974 - 00:28:40.694, Speaker E: And that's been kind of interesting for me.
00:28:40.734 - 00:28:43.390, Speaker C: That's what inspired me a lot to.
00:28:43.422 - 00:28:45.462, Speaker E: Kind of counterbalance things a bit, you.
00:28:45.478 - 00:28:50.622, Speaker C: Know, from, especially coming out of, especially.
00:28:50.678 - 00:28:52.150, Speaker E: With these pieces I've been doing lately.
00:28:52.222 - 00:28:54.246, Speaker C: That are more animated and they tend.
00:28:54.270 - 00:29:05.924, Speaker E: To be all kind of erratic. And so it's been an interesting counterbalance to do a piece that's all always moving and kind of twitchy and whatnot.
00:29:05.964 - 00:29:08.804, Speaker C: Then do another piece that's just still.
00:29:08.964 - 00:29:16.932, Speaker E: And empty and kind of off putting in a way. I'm kind of influenced as well by.
00:29:16.948 - 00:29:22.140, Speaker C: The danish painter Wilhelm Hammershoi, which I.
00:29:22.332 - 00:29:29.772, Speaker E: Find it's really, his pieces are very interesting because he paints a lot of.
00:29:29.828 - 00:29:34.340, Speaker C: Mundane things, a lot of pieces based.
00:29:34.372 - 00:29:41.052, Speaker E: On his house and I found, not mistaken, his wife. And it's all, it all has this.
00:29:41.108 - 00:29:42.904, Speaker C: Really weird feeling to it.
00:29:44.764 - 00:29:49.220, Speaker E: He turns the mundane into weird. But the thing is, the mundanity of.
00:29:49.252 - 00:29:59.964, Speaker C: His pieces are like 18 hundreds mundanity. So, I mean, we feel the eeriness to it, but it's not something that we have experienced.
00:30:00.704 - 00:30:02.272, Speaker E: So I try to bring that a.
00:30:02.288 - 00:30:06.176, Speaker C: Bit to, to, to our reality a.
00:30:06.200 - 00:30:09.616, Speaker E: Bit by adding, you know, sockets to.
00:30:09.640 - 00:30:17.648, Speaker C: The walls or light switches, etcetera. I can kind of like the, I.
00:30:17.656 - 00:30:42.894, Speaker A: Was just saying I can totally see it. I looked up the painter Wilhelm Hammershoi, and feel free to post a link. I'll figure out if I can post a link. But I totally see it. I totally see the influence, and it's kind of like. Again, I almost want to call it, like, this heavy, oppressive atmosphere. Like you say, it's kind of mundane, but it's also kind of.
00:30:42.894 - 00:30:46.450, Speaker A: It's kind of unsettling, and there's a kind of a weirdness.
00:30:46.602 - 00:30:47.490, Speaker D: I don't know if I'd call it.
00:30:47.522 - 00:30:51.134, Speaker A: Darkness, that's almost too strong. But there's something about it.
00:30:52.464 - 00:30:52.776, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:30:52.800 - 00:31:00.264, Speaker E: Like you said, it's oppressive. I mean, I think oppressive kind of. Kind of sums it up well, because it's all these closed up spaces, and it's.
00:31:00.424 - 00:31:01.576, Speaker C: And it's not inviting.
00:31:01.640 - 00:31:04.472, Speaker E: It's a house, clearly, it's a house, but it's not inviting.
00:31:04.528 - 00:31:07.072, Speaker C: It's just off a bit.
00:31:07.128 - 00:31:24.842, Speaker E: In a way, it's kind of weird. And it kind of came about as well, because before, I think, around 2020, from 2019 to 2021, we used to.
00:31:24.858 - 00:31:39.386, Speaker C: Live in a building, which was the inspiration for the old building collection, and it was a really old building, and the apartment we lived in was kind of on the bottom of the building, so it was really closed off.
00:31:39.410 - 00:31:43.186, Speaker E: So it was a really weird experience going through the pandemic inside the building.
00:31:43.250 - 00:31:50.230, Speaker C: Because, um, we, we wouldn't see the street because it was all closed off.
00:31:50.302 - 00:31:52.834, Speaker E: The. The sunlight didn't hit very well down there.
00:31:53.374 - 00:32:01.390, Speaker C: So in a way, that, uh, that inspired me to, to, to see the.
00:32:01.422 - 00:32:05.034, Speaker E: Whore in these kind of oppressive environments.
00:32:05.494 - 00:32:06.394, Speaker D: The, the.
00:32:09.454 - 00:32:12.094, Speaker C: See, the, how can I put it?
00:32:12.954 - 00:32:17.734, Speaker E: The unsettlingness, for lack of a better word. Um.
00:32:18.634 - 00:32:21.706, Speaker C: In, uh, in a house, which is.
00:32:21.730 - 00:32:25.266, Speaker E: Kind of weird, because you, when you're in a house, you're supposed to feel safe.
00:32:25.330 - 00:32:28.250, Speaker C: You're not supposed to feel unsettled or anything.
00:32:28.322 - 00:32:34.954, Speaker E: And it just hit me when I found Wilhelm hammer choice pieces, because it's exactly that. It's a house. It's supposed to feel safe, it's supposed.
00:32:34.994 - 00:32:37.716, Speaker C: To feel comfortable, but it's not.
00:32:37.780 - 00:32:44.020, Speaker E: It's weird. There's this person, you know, standing with her back towards the painter, and there's just these things that are kind of.
00:32:44.052 - 00:32:47.584, Speaker C: Off, and I think that's kind of.
00:32:48.244 - 00:32:50.692, Speaker E: It hits that uncanny valley thing, because.
00:32:50.868 - 00:32:55.228, Speaker C: It'S supposed to be a house, it's supposed to be comfortable, but. But it isn't.
00:32:55.276 - 00:32:57.572, Speaker E: It's cold, and it's like you said, oppressive.
00:32:57.708 - 00:32:58.460, Speaker D: And.
00:32:58.652 - 00:33:00.180, Speaker C: And there's a certain horror to that.
00:33:00.212 - 00:33:01.292, Speaker E: When you come to think about it.
00:33:01.308 - 00:33:06.886, Speaker C: You know, living in a place that makes you feel off, you know, and.
00:33:06.910 - 00:33:09.954, Speaker E: That'S the kind of thing I tried to capture in these pieces.
00:33:10.774 - 00:33:15.834, Speaker A: Absolutely. It reminds me like almost of Edgar Allan Poe, you know?
00:33:16.294 - 00:33:16.702, Speaker D: Right.
00:33:16.758 - 00:33:41.884, Speaker A: And just like this kind of. Almost like the horror of the mundane, I want to say yes. And even like, I mean, the surrealist too. Again, I'm kind of back to Magritte. And I mean, Magritte loved Edgar Allan Poe, actually, which is interesting. Magritte was super influenced, I think, at least in terms of the titles he read. I mean, a lot of the surrealists read a lot of Edgar Allan Poe.
00:33:41.884 - 00:34:07.556, Speaker A: So it's kind of interesting how this. Yeah, it's kind of like this theme, this. Of architecture and just almost the horror of three dimensional space, dare we say. You know, JG Ballard actually had this kind of cryptic question. The angle between two walls have a happy ending. That was almost his take on kind of what you're saying here. And I'm still trying to figure out what he meant by that.
00:34:07.556 - 00:34:12.404, Speaker A: But I think it's almost like this. This anxiety, the psychological anxiety of three.
00:34:12.444 - 00:34:16.828, Speaker C: Dimensional space, which is interesting.
00:34:16.996 - 00:34:17.412, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:34:17.468 - 00:34:20.624, Speaker A: So it looks like.
00:34:21.604 - 00:34:22.012, Speaker E: Go on.
00:34:22.028 - 00:34:22.664, Speaker D: Go on.
00:34:23.764 - 00:34:24.814, Speaker B: Hammershoi.
00:34:24.924 - 00:34:25.654, Speaker D: Uh.
00:34:26.194 - 00:34:31.134, Speaker B: It looks like he did a lot of different paintings of that same sort of window.
00:34:31.794 - 00:34:32.534, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:34:32.994 - 00:34:35.066, Speaker B: He returned to that window over and.
00:34:35.090 - 00:34:35.690, Speaker A: Over and over again.
00:34:35.722 - 00:34:47.794, Speaker B: I'm looking at. I have seen this artist before, but I haven't, like, uh, dived deep into. To the work. But, um, I'm seeing this return to that same room, it seems like, which is interesting.
00:34:47.834 - 00:34:58.976, Speaker E: It's always the window. It's always the window. And it's always this, uh. This room with the door. And behind the door there's another door. And sometimes there's a chair by the.
00:34:59.000 - 00:35:02.404, Speaker C: Left of the door or a table on the right. And it's.
00:35:02.824 - 00:35:12.924, Speaker E: You can see that. I mean, I obviously didn't know the guy, and I don't know that much about him personally, but it feels like.
00:35:14.024 - 00:35:15.564, Speaker C: A prison of sorts.
00:35:16.504 - 00:35:21.752, Speaker E: And I think that's interesting because, like I said, it gives this really uncanny.
00:35:21.808 - 00:35:26.146, Speaker C: Feeling to the whole idea of a house, you know?
00:35:26.330 - 00:35:30.094, Speaker E: And I've always been fascinated by the whole concept of.
00:35:32.194 - 00:35:32.842, Speaker C: For lack of a.
00:35:32.858 - 00:35:36.494, Speaker E: Better word, the haunted house. You know, the off putting house.
00:35:37.034 - 00:35:39.174, Speaker C: Because, I mean.
00:35:41.234 - 00:35:42.174, Speaker D: You, you.
00:35:43.714 - 00:35:45.534, Speaker E: It's a space with.
00:35:47.474 - 00:35:48.522, Speaker C: That was built with.
00:35:48.578 - 00:35:49.174, Speaker E: With.
00:35:50.554 - 00:35:51.234, Speaker D: Because it's different.
00:35:51.274 - 00:36:09.654, Speaker E: I mean, when you're out in nature, there's a certain. It can be off putting in a way, but still, you're. You're in nature, you're surrounded by life. But when you're inside a concrete block, it's it's different because it's, it's made to.
00:36:11.834 - 00:36:19.042, Speaker C: For a certain purpose, you know? And, and when it doesn't fulfill this.
00:36:19.098 - 00:36:26.202, Speaker E: Purpose of keeping you safe or keeping you well or just holding your things.
00:36:26.338 - 00:36:29.186, Speaker C: When it's empty, it's just weird, you.
00:36:29.210 - 00:36:33.530, Speaker E: Know, it's just weird to be, to be in this place and it's not.
00:36:33.562 - 00:36:35.214, Speaker C: What it's supposed to be.
00:36:36.154 - 00:36:39.254, Speaker E: I find it very, very fascinating, the feeling of that.
00:36:42.294 - 00:37:11.624, Speaker A: I was just going to say you hit it on target. That whole feeling in your work, you know, and it's almost like another angle on this is like when someone has died, you know, previously, or if there was a murder in a house and then people move in and you know, that there's just this sense of foreboding. You know, it's like the imagination. It's almost like we want to put, you know, we want to personify or anthropomorphize the space.
00:37:12.284 - 00:37:12.780, Speaker E: Definitely.
00:37:12.812 - 00:37:15.224, Speaker A: We want to give it a personality.
00:37:16.004 - 00:37:18.304, Speaker B: I do have another question for you.
00:37:18.884 - 00:37:19.172, Speaker D: Go.
00:37:19.188 - 00:37:19.460, Speaker E: Go ahead.
00:37:19.492 - 00:37:40.114, Speaker B: Yeah. With a lot of your work that you put up, sometimes you have some, like, writing for the caption on object for stuff in quotes. Is that, what are the things? Are you like, quote certain stories or books or movies or is this just something that you come up with on your own?
00:37:40.814 - 00:37:45.270, Speaker E: You mean these pieces specifically, the, the ones with the backgrounds?
00:37:45.462 - 00:37:46.234, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:37:46.534 - 00:37:53.926, Speaker B: There's one titled like, 03:00 a.m. And there's something that you put in quotes, like every night at 03:00 a.m. Same thing, etcetera.
00:37:53.990 - 00:38:00.874, Speaker E: Oh, it's, that's, that's just me trying to be a writer, so.
00:38:01.714 - 00:38:02.562, Speaker D: Okay.
00:38:02.738 - 00:38:09.094, Speaker B: Yeah, I was always curious. Sometimes the quote, the quote marks lead me to believe it's from something.
00:38:09.834 - 00:38:10.330, Speaker D: Hmm.
00:38:10.402 - 00:38:14.242, Speaker E: Yeah. Because I, uh, that's the thing with, with horror.
00:38:14.298 - 00:38:17.778, Speaker C: I, I really enjoy the most, uh.
00:38:17.906 - 00:38:19.482, Speaker E: I like short horror.
00:38:19.618 - 00:38:23.970, Speaker C: Like, uh, short stories or like those one sentence horrors.
00:38:24.002 - 00:38:24.482, Speaker E: I like.
00:38:24.578 - 00:38:28.262, Speaker C: I think horror is, um, is, it's.
00:38:28.318 - 00:38:32.902, Speaker E: Most effective when it starts out of nowhere and it just stops out of.
00:38:32.918 - 00:38:35.654, Speaker C: Nowhere and it leaves you like, what the fuck?
00:38:35.694 - 00:38:43.674, Speaker E: You know? It makes you, that's the kind of thing that keeps you thinking for like days and days and days and revisiting that and the lack of.
00:38:46.214 - 00:38:57.586, Speaker C: Explanation. I think that's what gets into your brain and makes it that more scarier. So, in a way, those writings, I.
00:38:57.610 - 00:39:05.346, Speaker E: Usually put in quotations just to give that, that aspect of, okay, this just, you're seeing this fragment of a situation.
00:39:05.490 - 00:39:12.858, Speaker C: You don't know how it got there, and you don't know where it'll go from there. It's just this moment that's really freaky, you know?
00:39:13.026 - 00:40:02.770, Speaker B: Yeah, it's so funny. I mean, horror as a genre, it's a super quotable thing in general. Sometimes it just feels like horror as a genre is just, like, an amalgamation of a lot of the same types of stories. And it's something that's interested me and looking at, like, early folktales and stuff like that that implement these kind of, like, scary stories. A lot of times it was like there was some sort of, like, moral or didactic thing, or they operated as, like, kind of a warning for the younger generation to scare off the kids, you know, as these things get passed on, a lot of times the story, like, a certain story would kind of, like, change a little bit, or it would be brought from one part of the world to the other, and it turned into some completely new thing. And we don't have necessarily, like, a.
00:40:02.802 - 00:40:06.802, Speaker C: Good, you know, sort of lineage of.
00:40:06.858 - 00:40:27.524, Speaker B: Of how these things change. But a lot of times, it's like, you know, something that everyone can relate to but told in a story that's, like, a little bit different. So I kind of, like, find it fascinating. These little quotes that you put on the side feel almost like they come from something greater than yourself, if that makes sense.
00:40:29.384 - 00:40:39.974, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, the initial idea for the oldest building, the old building, was to kind of make a narrative based.
00:40:41.274 - 00:40:55.530, Speaker C: Collection, but I kind of just jumped into it because I was really. Actually, it's an idea I've been thinking about, like, for around three or four.
00:40:55.602 - 00:40:58.094, Speaker E: Years, ever since I lived in the other building.
00:40:58.514 - 00:40:59.254, Speaker D: And.
00:41:00.114 - 00:41:01.410, Speaker C: But then I stopped in the middle.
00:41:01.442 - 00:41:10.214, Speaker E: Because I was like, okay, I mean, if I want to make a narrative based thing, I have to flesh it out a bit better, you know? But the whole initial thing was to make it.
00:41:12.874 - 00:41:14.674, Speaker C: A whole story, but not.
00:41:14.714 - 00:41:15.654, Speaker E: Necessarily.
00:41:17.354 - 00:41:29.294, Speaker C: Chronologically organized, but just a lot of little snippets of things that happens in that building, in the said building.
00:41:32.874 - 00:41:37.780, Speaker E: But I'm slowly going back to that, going back that, because I've been missing.
00:41:37.812 - 00:41:39.204, Speaker C: Doing these, and it's been.
00:41:39.284 - 00:41:40.692, Speaker E: It's super fun doing these.
00:41:40.748 - 00:41:41.664, Speaker C: These pieces.
00:41:42.724 - 00:42:09.358, Speaker A: And. And you. You do other topics, too, like alchemy and tarot, which I want to ask you in a second, but welcome, everybody who's listening, and if anybody wants to join the conversation, just put a request here, and I will happily bring you on stage. I may send out a few prank invites, and feel free to check that as well. So, Daniel W. Tell us about the alchemy business. Like, you had a few works.
00:42:09.358 - 00:42:15.554, Speaker A: Have you gone deep into alchemy? Was it just sort of a. Kind of a fun thing to do? Can you speak a little bit about that?
00:42:16.134 - 00:42:17.942, Speaker C: Oh, definitely, yeah.
00:42:18.118 - 00:42:20.014, Speaker E: That was around the time I was.
00:42:20.054 - 00:42:22.794, Speaker C: Painting back in the pandemic.
00:42:24.574 - 00:42:24.982, Speaker D: And I.
00:42:24.998 - 00:42:27.514, Speaker E: Was sort of, like, creating this.
00:42:30.604 - 00:42:32.412, Speaker C: I was working on these characters, which.
00:42:32.508 - 00:42:39.944, Speaker E: I still use today, and it was way too past the time to keep my mind busy.
00:42:40.724 - 00:42:44.068, Speaker C: I kind of started creating this mythos.
00:42:44.156 - 00:42:47.268, Speaker E: Of sort, not something I necessarily believe.
00:42:47.356 - 00:42:51.104, Speaker C: In, but something, a fun way of.
00:42:52.084 - 00:42:53.810, Speaker E: Making these characters and.
00:42:53.932 - 00:42:58.686, Speaker C: And giving them meaning and using them.
00:42:58.710 - 00:43:04.954, Speaker E: To explain certain things. And around the time I was painting, I came about.
00:43:06.894 - 00:43:07.654, Speaker D: It was a video.
00:43:07.694 - 00:43:22.950, Speaker E: I forgot the channel because I have the habit of listening to video essays while I work. And I found this channel where the guy was analyzing the occult aspects and the alchemy aspects of the game Silent.
00:43:22.982 - 00:43:32.296, Speaker C: Hill two, which is a game I'm very fond of, going back to horror. And it just struck me.
00:43:32.320 - 00:43:35.760, Speaker E: I was like, oh, damn, that's interesting.
00:43:35.912 - 00:43:48.608, Speaker C: And I started going deeper from there. And I think what caught me the most about this whole thing is how open it is, in a way.
00:43:48.696 - 00:43:51.952, Speaker E: So you got alchemy engravings and such.
00:43:52.008 - 00:43:52.604, Speaker C: And.
00:43:54.944 - 00:43:57.192, Speaker E: That symbolize certain things and certain.
00:43:57.248 - 00:44:00.456, Speaker C: Aspects of the alchemical process and.
00:44:00.600 - 00:44:11.176, Speaker E: But it's not. You don't have a dictionary for these things. I mean, you know that the sun, I mean, the. The green line eating the sun symbolizes the halfway point of an alchemical process.
00:44:11.280 - 00:44:13.888, Speaker C: But you don't have that written somewhere.
00:44:13.936 - 00:44:16.924, Speaker E: It's just there in a picture and you sort of.
00:44:17.284 - 00:44:19.404, Speaker C: It's all very subjective in a way.
00:44:19.444 - 00:44:21.076, Speaker E: And I like that. I like how.
00:44:21.260 - 00:44:26.144, Speaker C: How they rely heavily on symbolism to.
00:44:27.164 - 00:44:34.780, Speaker E: Pass a message and to explain certain things and how it's not exactly set in stone. So you, you.
00:44:34.892 - 00:44:38.864, Speaker C: You kind of have to find your way through it, in a way, and.
00:44:40.884 - 00:44:46.356, Speaker E: But I was really enamored with it and I still am because of the whole psychological aspect of it.
00:44:46.380 - 00:44:49.824, Speaker C: I mean, Carl Jung, he'd write extensively.
00:44:49.864 - 00:44:59.004, Speaker E: About alchemy, and it's interesting how.
00:45:01.104 - 00:45:01.392, Speaker D: The.
00:45:01.408 - 00:45:02.164, Speaker E: Whole process.
00:45:04.784 - 00:45:06.024, Speaker C: When you look deeper into.
00:45:06.064 - 00:45:17.204, Speaker E: It, it has this whole meaning behind it that is not necessarily just turning bronze into gold. It is, but it's more than that.
00:45:17.244 - 00:45:25.024, Speaker C: You know, it's you becoming the gold. It's you going through this whole arduous process of.
00:45:26.804 - 00:45:27.708, Speaker E: For lack of a better.
00:45:27.756 - 00:45:36.704, Speaker C: Word, dying and then rotting and then just coming back a better person. And that just.
00:45:38.524 - 00:45:41.060, Speaker E: Caught me in a way, in a certain moment of my.
00:45:41.092 - 00:45:45.530, Speaker C: Life when, when I thought it would. Yeah, that's, that's really cool.
00:45:45.562 - 00:45:53.018, Speaker E: And I like the message and I like the teachings. And then I think it fit in a way with what I was doing at the time.
00:45:53.186 - 00:45:55.442, Speaker D: So I kind of just picked it.
00:45:55.458 - 00:45:56.754, Speaker E: Up and ran with it.
00:45:56.834 - 00:46:03.578, Speaker C: It's, it's, I mean, I haven't been using it that much in my late.
00:46:03.626 - 00:46:09.130, Speaker E: Pieces, but it's something I revisit constantly, which I'm very fond of.
00:46:09.282 - 00:46:12.840, Speaker C: I like, I enjoy the symbolism behind.
00:46:12.952 - 00:46:16.544, Speaker E: The images and the whole idea behind.
00:46:16.624 - 00:46:18.204, Speaker C: The process of it.
00:46:20.184 - 00:46:21.404, Speaker E: It's very human.
00:46:21.704 - 00:46:26.192, Speaker C: I think, when you come to analyze.
00:46:26.208 - 00:46:34.044, Speaker E: It deeply, these are sorts of things that can strike a core with absolutely anyone.
00:46:36.084 - 00:46:37.852, Speaker C: And I don't mean in a religious sense.
00:46:37.908 - 00:46:43.988, Speaker E: I mean, like I said, it's very human. It's super. Everyone goes through these kind of.
00:46:44.076 - 00:47:11.224, Speaker A: Huh, exactly like you're saying. Everyone goes through these things. I was going to say, it's kind of like, the connection for me is like, your work seems to have a very psychological aspect to it. Right. I mean, whether it's the rooms and then there, you know, as you're saying with Carl Jung and alchemy is like kind of a, kind of a guidebook of store of sorts, you know, of realizing the soul in a certain sort of way. And this kind of maturation.
00:47:12.044 - 00:47:12.668, Speaker D: Right.
00:47:12.796 - 00:47:15.132, Speaker A: This awakening of sorts or whatever you.
00:47:15.148 - 00:47:16.276, Speaker C: Want to call it.
00:47:16.460 - 00:47:39.220, Speaker A: So there's kind of an interesting, and, you know, even again, this tarot business that you're doing, because I think you've done some tarot stuff as well, if I'm not mistaken. Even the mushrooms, you could argue, you know, indirectly. There's also, you know, just with the psychedelic mushrooms and everything. Like, there does seem to be this, this thread, you know, through your work that is kind of psychological in nature.
00:47:39.372 - 00:47:46.824, Speaker E: Yeah, Tarot was, was kind of, it was a funny thing that happened to me, actually. Tarot just kind of happened to me.
00:47:47.324 - 00:47:50.508, Speaker C: Because it was a few years back.
00:47:50.556 - 00:47:54.260, Speaker E: My grandmother, she passed away, and she.
00:47:54.372 - 00:48:07.608, Speaker C: She'S from Italy, and, and while rummaging around her things, I found her old neapolitan card deck. And my mom said, oh, keep it.
00:48:07.776 - 00:48:08.512, Speaker D: Okay.
00:48:08.648 - 00:48:10.964, Speaker C: And at first I didn't, you know.
00:48:11.824 - 00:48:13.976, Speaker E: I didn't pay too much attention to.
00:48:14.000 - 00:48:20.752, Speaker C: It, and then I just kept it away. And last year, it popped up in.
00:48:20.768 - 00:48:28.940, Speaker E: The middle of my things while, well, was organizing a few things. And I flipped around the cards and I'm like, man, this is, this is, this is interesting.
00:48:28.972 - 00:48:31.316, Speaker C: I mean, it's, I mean, it's from.
00:48:31.340 - 00:48:34.492, Speaker E: The twenties, if I'm not mistaken. The deck, it's super old.
00:48:34.548 - 00:48:48.576, Speaker C: I mean, it's been through a lot. It's been in Italy. Then it came to Brazil and I was like, damn. Well, let's, let's, let's find out more about it because, well, I mean, some sort, it's, it's, it's a hero.
00:48:48.640 - 00:48:55.672, Speaker E: It's something, you know, my grandmother left for us. And that's when I started getting going.
00:48:55.728 - 00:49:00.004, Speaker C: Deeper into the, into tarot.
00:49:00.704 - 00:49:12.804, Speaker E: And I found, and I was already very fond of alchemy and psychology and all that. And it was interesting to find that tarot ended up being just another instrument in this whole.
00:49:17.704 - 00:49:19.204, Speaker C: And this whole part.
00:49:19.544 - 00:49:23.096, Speaker E: I was interested in, because obviously there's.
00:49:23.160 - 00:49:26.896, Speaker C: This whole esoteric side to it, but.
00:49:26.920 - 00:49:30.664, Speaker E: There'S a whole psychological aspect to it. I mean, as a tool to better.
00:49:30.704 - 00:49:34.408, Speaker C: Understand yourself, it's very effective.
00:49:34.456 - 00:49:42.204, Speaker E: It makes you, when you're pulling cards, it makes you think sometimes makes you think about things you, you wouldn't think.
00:49:42.244 - 00:49:42.824, Speaker C: About.
00:49:45.124 - 00:49:47.212, Speaker E: And see situations in a way.
00:49:47.268 - 00:49:51.348, Speaker C: You previously wouldn't see, and see yourself.
00:49:51.396 - 00:49:58.140, Speaker E: In ways you previously wouldn't see. So it's an interesting tool for self discovery.
00:49:58.172 - 00:50:09.320, Speaker C: And I've always been interested by the whole, how can I put this? I've been, I've always been interested with.
00:50:09.432 - 00:50:12.840, Speaker E: For lack of a better word, chaos, the randomness.
00:50:13.032 - 00:50:15.672, Speaker C: And I think tarot is a bit.
00:50:15.688 - 00:50:17.248, Speaker E: Of an instrument of chaos in a.
00:50:17.256 - 00:50:23.016, Speaker C: Way, because you shuffle the cards and, and you just pull the cards and.
00:50:23.040 - 00:50:33.676, Speaker E: It'S so random, but it's, it's, despite how random sometimes, of course, you'll pull a card and you're like, what the fuck did this? This doesn't make sense for what I'm.
00:50:33.700 - 00:50:37.268, Speaker C: Going through now, but most of the times, I mean, like, good.
00:50:37.316 - 00:50:40.132, Speaker E: 99% of the times, a plural kind of, it will make you think about.
00:50:40.188 - 00:50:45.676, Speaker C: Something that you probably perhaps weren't thinking about before.
00:50:45.820 - 00:50:54.860, Speaker E: And it's like, wow, it's just this, it's just this micro version of the.
00:50:54.892 - 00:50:59.396, Speaker C: Universe in a way, and it's randomness and chaoticness.
00:50:59.580 - 00:51:04.244, Speaker E: Yeah. So it's, it's interesting. And I like the whole, the symbols.
00:51:04.284 - 00:51:10.780, Speaker C: Behind it as well. It's, it's very inspiring for me in a way, and it just fits into.
00:51:10.812 - 00:51:15.068, Speaker E: The whole context of everything that inspires me with, like I said, with psychology.
00:51:15.156 - 00:51:17.756, Speaker C: And alchemy and occult.
00:51:17.860 - 00:51:22.900, Speaker E: And it's, it's, it's cool. I like it. And I started collecting after that.
00:51:22.972 - 00:51:34.832, Speaker C: I started collecting decks after that, which became, which was another hook for me. Cause, like, we were talking about hobbies before. I was like, I said, it came.
00:51:34.848 - 00:51:36.792, Speaker E: To a point where I was like, okay, I don't have a hobby.
00:51:36.928 - 00:51:44.084, Speaker C: My hobby became my job, which obviously is super fucking cool, but now I need another hobby.
00:51:44.944 - 00:51:59.414, Speaker E: So I thought, well, let's collect fucking turtle decks as a hobby then. Cause this won't turn into my job. So it's, you know, strictly a hobby now. So it has all these, these, these pulls for me.
00:52:00.314 - 00:52:15.098, Speaker A: Well, it seems like your work. Like, I'm sure you must have thought about making your own tarot deck. Like, I see the eight of swords here on your profile, but I don't see too many. Have you ever thought about making your own card deck, or are you making.
00:52:15.146 - 00:52:16.374, Speaker D: Your own card deck?
00:52:16.834 - 00:52:17.658, Speaker C: Oh, definitely.
00:52:17.706 - 00:52:25.040, Speaker E: It's, it's something that's in my plans, but I've been thinking about it for a couple of months now.
00:52:25.152 - 00:52:36.404, Speaker C: But I was like, I mean, I could just start out, but there's so much symbolism behind the cards and behind.
00:52:38.224 - 00:52:39.164, Speaker E: The images.
00:52:39.544 - 00:52:43.712, Speaker C: And they're not just random images.
00:52:43.848 - 00:52:45.792, Speaker E: Each one of them have, it's all.
00:52:45.848 - 00:52:49.716, Speaker C: Very meticulously pieced together, and everything has.
00:52:49.740 - 00:52:50.780, Speaker E: A meaning to it.
00:52:50.852 - 00:52:53.196, Speaker C: I mean, from the position of the.
00:52:53.220 - 00:52:55.544, Speaker E: Characters in the images to what they're.
00:52:55.844 - 00:53:00.388, Speaker C: What'S, what's drawn in the foreground. So I, so I thought, well, first.
00:53:00.436 - 00:53:01.424, Speaker E: I want to get.
00:53:03.684 - 00:53:08.668, Speaker C: First I want to get to know these cards better, you know, and understand.
00:53:08.756 - 00:53:15.160, Speaker E: Them better, understand why each of them has the image they have and what, why each of them means what they.
00:53:15.192 - 00:53:19.888, Speaker C: Means to, to then start creating mine.
00:53:19.936 - 00:53:20.804, Speaker E: So I can.
00:53:23.064 - 00:53:24.044, Speaker C: So I can.
00:53:25.784 - 00:53:26.144, Speaker D: Make.
00:53:26.184 - 00:53:39.312, Speaker C: It as respectful as I can. Because, I mean, it's. Because, I mean, if I make a.
00:53:39.328 - 00:53:46.306, Speaker E: Teradak, I hope people will. Will print it out or whatever and pull the cards.
00:53:46.370 - 00:53:49.814, Speaker C: And, you know, and so if people.
00:53:50.194 - 00:54:02.570, Speaker E: Do that, I want them to have an experience like you would have by pulling cards from a Smith white deck.
00:54:02.602 - 00:54:05.986, Speaker C: For example, which is the traditional tarot deck.
00:54:06.170 - 00:54:09.622, Speaker E: And so I'm first studying the whole thing.
00:54:09.738 - 00:54:11.694, Speaker C: Uh, first.
00:54:11.814 - 00:54:17.118, Speaker E: Then eventually I'll get to that, because it's something I, that's a project I.
00:54:17.206 - 00:54:19.126, Speaker C: Really want to do, but I want.
00:54:19.150 - 00:54:20.302, Speaker E: To get to know.
00:54:20.478 - 00:54:21.234, Speaker D: Huh.
00:54:21.654 - 00:54:25.198, Speaker A: I was going to say, and it sounds like you want to do it right. You want to have the real deal.
00:54:25.246 - 00:54:26.462, Speaker D: Yeah. Right.
00:54:26.518 - 00:54:27.358, Speaker E: Yeah, exactly.
00:54:27.486 - 00:54:27.950, Speaker D: Exactly.
00:54:27.982 - 00:54:29.758, Speaker E: Because you have all these novelty decks.
00:54:29.806 - 00:54:32.206, Speaker C: Which, I mean, okay, it's fine.
00:54:32.270 - 00:54:38.204, Speaker E: It's fun. You can, there's no problem far for me to judge, you know, some, somebody.
00:54:38.324 - 00:54:39.644, Speaker C: For doing a tarot deck.
00:54:39.684 - 00:54:56.772, Speaker E: That's you know, ah, fucking Simpsons tarot deck or fucking, you know, that's okay. But I don't want to do that. You know, I want to, I want to do like, I wanted to have meaning, you know, I want people to.
00:54:56.828 - 00:55:02.848, Speaker C: To be able to get something out of it when they pull the cards.
00:55:02.936 - 00:55:07.840, Speaker E: And do a reading for themselves or for other people. I want to be legit, you know?
00:55:07.952 - 00:55:08.288, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:55:08.336 - 00:55:13.364, Speaker A: So you want to do justice to the whole tradition.
00:55:14.104 - 00:55:16.720, Speaker E: Exactly, exactly. I want to get to it as.
00:55:16.752 - 00:55:19.960, Speaker C: Respectfully as I can because, I mean.
00:55:19.992 - 00:55:23.960, Speaker E: There, I mean, me included, there's a lot of people who take it very seriously.
00:55:23.992 - 00:55:26.552, Speaker C: So, I mean, if I'm going to.
00:55:26.568 - 00:55:27.336, Speaker E: Do it, I want to do, like.
00:55:27.360 - 00:55:29.742, Speaker C: You said, I want to do it right, so now.
00:55:29.798 - 00:55:32.430, Speaker E: But it's definitely in my plans. It's definitely something I want to do.
00:55:32.502 - 00:55:34.554, Speaker C: Probably by the end of the year.
00:55:34.894 - 00:55:38.714, Speaker E: But, you know, still, still some ways before that.
00:55:39.334 - 00:55:39.710, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:55:39.742 - 00:55:51.634, Speaker A: You might not want to rush it too much. And so just a quick detail question on your nana's neapolitan deck. Were those scopa cards or was that tarot?
00:55:53.574 - 00:55:54.182, Speaker E: Scopa.
00:55:54.238 - 00:55:55.694, Speaker C: Scopa cards. Yeah.
00:55:57.514 - 00:55:57.842, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:55:57.858 - 00:56:03.174, Speaker A: They don't have. Is there a relationship between Scopa and tarot?
00:56:04.194 - 00:56:15.734, Speaker E: Um, I mean, they, um, not that I'm aware of, but there probably has in a way. I mean, you can still do readings with those. Um, there's, uh.
00:56:16.194 - 00:56:17.682, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, I've been spending.
00:56:17.738 - 00:56:18.814, Speaker A: I didn't know that.
00:56:19.314 - 00:56:20.334, Speaker E: Yeah, yeah.
00:56:22.014 - 00:56:34.902, Speaker A: I was just going to say, it's so funny. I mean, you just kind of hit a nerve here because I think the first place I ever played Scopa, which are italian, you know, trading cards for those that might not know, was in Naples. And I haven't been to Naples since when I was like six.
00:56:34.998 - 00:56:35.374, Speaker D: Really?
00:56:35.454 - 00:56:44.434, Speaker A: No, and I played. Yeah, it's like, almost like you're in Naples, you don't play trading card or regular, you know, card decks. You play Scopa.
00:56:45.974 - 00:56:46.986, Speaker C: That's cool.
00:56:47.150 - 00:56:50.226, Speaker E: Are you, are you italian? Because poco belly sounds very italian.
00:56:50.330 - 00:57:04.774, Speaker A: Yeah. We had family actually in Naples back in the day. We actually had property back in the day. The war kind of screwed things up, world War two. But, yeah, it was like Roman. Naples was sort of where a lot of the pokebellies were based.
00:57:06.394 - 00:57:06.754, Speaker D: So.
00:57:06.794 - 00:57:12.374, Speaker A: Yeah, anyway, so my dad and family vacation, when I was six years old, we went over to Naples and Rome.
00:57:12.974 - 00:57:19.622, Speaker C: No, that's awesome, dude. Yeah, but, yeah, but, but, yeah, I.
00:57:19.638 - 00:57:24.958, Speaker E: Mean, the cards there, because they don't have major arcanas, they're just the suites.
00:57:25.006 - 00:57:27.194, Speaker C: And the numbers and.
00:57:29.934 - 00:57:35.966, Speaker E: My grandma, she, she, she had this deck and another one, but a much newer one, but.
00:57:35.990 - 00:57:37.902, Speaker C: This one, I think it's from the.
00:57:37.918 - 00:57:41.112, Speaker E: 1920S, if I'm not mistaken. It's super fucking old.
00:57:41.278 - 00:57:48.504, Speaker A: Oh, you should, you should post that on Twitter. I'd love to see that, like a picture of that. If you still have them, or I will.
00:57:49.044 - 00:57:49.636, Speaker C: I'll post.
00:57:49.700 - 00:57:58.428, Speaker E: Yeah, have them kept really safe here. I mean, I pulled them out on rare occasion to do some readings, but I mean, I just keep them inside.
00:57:58.476 - 00:58:03.636, Speaker C: A little black baggie and on my shelf because this is something I'm thinking.
00:58:03.660 - 00:58:10.376, Speaker E: For the rest of my life. It's, it's amazing. But I'll post a few pictures today. I posted a few, uh, I think.
00:58:10.400 - 00:58:13.152, Speaker D: It was last year, uh, end of.
00:58:13.168 - 00:58:14.872, Speaker C: Last year or something like that when.
00:58:14.888 - 00:58:26.924, Speaker E: I, when I, when I, when I, when I picked them up again. But I'll post a few pictures because they're super cool. They're, they're, they're very beautiful. And they're super old. Yeah, it is.
00:58:29.424 - 00:58:44.984, Speaker A: Well, we are, uh, an hour in here. We're, you're going to start to wrap up again. If anybody wants to come on stage and ask Daniel W. A question. This is a wonderful opportunity. And also, we're already an hour in, but there's no rush. But.
00:58:44.984 - 00:59:08.364, Speaker A: So tell us, what are you going to work on? What are you working on now? Like, you have these characters that you're describing, and it kind of seems like it's, you know, it's almost like this animation that you kind of had of sorts. I mean, these characters and everything speak a little bit about that because it sounds like something that could be easily turned at some point into like a cartoon or something. But anyways, just talk.
00:59:10.104 - 00:59:21.084, Speaker E: Well, I mean, one of my big influences, aside from horror and occult and alchemy and such, has always been street art.
00:59:22.184 - 00:59:26.788, Speaker C: And I've always been very fond of characters.
00:59:26.836 - 00:59:29.104, Speaker E: When, when people spray paint characters.
00:59:31.804 - 00:59:32.916, Speaker C: I've always liked it.
00:59:32.940 - 00:59:39.184, Speaker E: It's super cool. And we have a very, very rich culture of street art in Brazil and especially Sao Paulo.
00:59:39.684 - 00:59:40.424, Speaker D: And.
00:59:43.444 - 00:59:58.648, Speaker E: A few years back, I started drawing this face, which ended up being my signature. And, and I started working around then. I made this devil character. Then I thought, okay, cool. I like this. I like this guy. He's fun.
00:59:58.648 - 01:00:05.880, Speaker E: He looks like a cheeky motherfucker. Then, well, let's make a counterpart for him. And that's when I made the pyramid.
01:00:05.912 - 01:00:09.512, Speaker C: Head character, which would, I mean, I.
01:00:09.528 - 01:00:14.964, Speaker E: Think you could call it in God or something. And it just started.
01:00:17.444 - 01:00:19.204, Speaker C: They started out as something really fun.
01:00:19.284 - 01:00:26.864, Speaker E: To draw, which I could put everywhere. You know, back in my, my music videos, I sort of fit them in somewhere here and there.
01:00:27.964 - 01:00:29.824, Speaker C: So you've done some street art?
01:00:30.684 - 01:00:31.524, Speaker D: Mm hmm.
01:00:31.684 - 01:00:34.748, Speaker B: You, you've, you've done some street art in Brazil?
01:00:34.876 - 01:00:38.548, Speaker E: No, no, no. But, but I've been around a lot.
01:00:38.556 - 01:00:43.246, Speaker C: Of people who have. I'm friends with a lot of, there's.
01:00:43.270 - 01:00:57.914, Speaker E: A lot of people who do graffiti, who do picha song. So, I mean, I've been exposed to it ever since I was a kid. And, I mean, living in so Paulo specifically, it's kind of impossible to not be exposed to it because.
01:00:59.854 - 01:01:00.550, Speaker D: We have.
01:01:00.622 - 01:01:23.214, Speaker C: This, how can I say this? We have this very so Paulo ish style of street art we call Pichai son, which was initially based off of heavy metal logos.
01:01:24.114 - 01:01:45.966, Speaker E: They just spray paint on a wall, but then it started turning into something else. I'll post a few pictures for you afterwards so you can see. And it started to became its own thing after a while, after the eighties and nineties. And it's very Sao Paulo ish because nobody else in Brazil visit like we do here. And whenever people around here see something like it. Oh, yeah, that's, you know, so Paulo.
01:01:45.990 - 01:01:46.502, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:01:46.638 - 01:01:47.222, Speaker E: So.
01:01:47.358 - 01:01:48.134, Speaker C: And it's everywhere.
01:01:48.174 - 01:01:48.726, Speaker A: It's everywhere.
01:01:48.750 - 01:01:50.590, Speaker E: It's hard to find a house without.
01:01:50.742 - 01:01:52.154, Speaker C: Pichai song, you know?
01:01:52.454 - 01:01:58.714, Speaker E: And so I've always been exposed to it. I've always had friends who did it, but I've always been kind of.
01:02:00.894 - 01:02:02.062, Speaker C: I don't know, I've always been kind.
01:02:02.078 - 01:02:05.234, Speaker E: Of lazy to pick up a spray paint and do it myself.
01:02:06.734 - 01:02:12.734, Speaker C: But, uh. But it's something that inspires me a lot. I'm very much inspired by it.
01:02:12.774 - 01:02:13.022, Speaker E: So.
01:02:13.078 - 01:02:18.214, Speaker C: So these characters came about sort of, in a way, kind of like that.
01:02:18.374 - 01:02:22.914, Speaker E: And, um, what was the question again? Sorry.
01:02:23.734 - 01:02:34.734, Speaker A: Basically, what do you want to do with the characters? Like, do you have any plans with them? And then sort of, what are you working on in the island in the future here? What are your plans kind of coming up?
01:02:35.874 - 01:02:43.562, Speaker E: Oh, yeah, the characters, I plan on fleshing them out a bit better because I sort of just dropped them here and there.
01:02:43.698 - 01:02:48.490, Speaker C: After I came into Tezos, I haven't.
01:02:48.562 - 01:02:57.906, Speaker E: Actually given them a background or explained them better, so I actually even started another account, an object, just to focus.
01:02:57.970 - 01:03:04.600, Speaker C: On them, which I started a whole collection, which is tarot card based.
01:03:04.752 - 01:03:14.656, Speaker E: And each one would be one character. And where I explained them a bit better so people understand where they come from. But this is kind of in the.
01:03:14.680 - 01:03:16.484, Speaker C: Back burner, a bit, because.
01:03:18.664 - 01:03:19.072, Speaker D: I kind.
01:03:19.088 - 01:03:24.908, Speaker E: Of went through a phase a couple of weeks back, a bit of a creative block in a way.
01:03:25.016 - 01:03:27.028, Speaker C: So I was just kind of testing.
01:03:27.156 - 01:03:34.540, Speaker E: Things out, trying things in different styles, and revisiting old, my old style of animation.
01:03:34.652 - 01:03:39.116, Speaker C: And so I kind of got my.
01:03:39.180 - 01:03:47.604, Speaker E: Myself back on rails again. And that's when I started doing the whole faceless collection, which is these, these.
01:03:47.644 - 01:03:50.284, Speaker C: One of one pfps, which at first.
01:03:50.364 - 01:04:05.960, Speaker E: Weren'T supposed to be that I did the first one, which is old roots, which was sourced always to be this character with this drawing inside, which I felt like doing. But then my partner, she said, well.
01:04:05.992 - 01:04:08.604, Speaker C: Why didn't you turn it into a PFP?
01:04:09.064 - 01:04:19.796, Speaker E: And I was like, well, damn true, because I've been meaning to do a collection, a PFP collection for a minute now. So I thought, well, it's a good.
01:04:19.820 - 01:04:21.264, Speaker C: Opportunity to do that.
01:04:21.724 - 01:04:32.984, Speaker E: And I started focusing on that these last few days, and I've been sort of counterbalancing both things, doing these and doing.
01:04:35.124 - 01:04:40.624, Speaker C: The more horror oriented background pieces.
01:04:41.524 - 01:04:52.394, Speaker E: Sort of coming back to the old building a bit. So these are the two main things I've been working on these past few days, and I'll be working on for the next few days. Eventually, I'll go back to the characters.
01:04:52.434 - 01:04:55.666, Speaker C: And continue the tarot collection with them.
01:04:55.850 - 01:04:57.858, Speaker E: But first, I want to get these.
01:04:57.946 - 01:05:05.454, Speaker C: Out of the way and just, just taking advantage of the opportunity to plug in.
01:05:06.234 - 01:05:10.616, Speaker E: One thing I'm going to do today, later on, I'll be dropping one of.
01:05:10.640 - 01:05:14.088, Speaker C: These pieces, more atmospheric will be the first one.
01:05:14.096 - 01:05:15.744, Speaker E: I'll be dropping on ethereum today, later.
01:05:15.784 - 01:05:18.936, Speaker C: Tonight, but I'll be dropping one on.
01:05:18.960 - 01:05:20.976, Speaker E: Tazos today later, like in a couple.
01:05:21.000 - 01:05:22.124, Speaker C: Of hours as well.
01:05:23.224 - 01:05:25.888, Speaker E: So, yeah, these are a few things I've been working on, and I'm going.
01:05:25.896 - 01:05:28.164, Speaker C: To be working on for the next few days.
01:05:29.424 - 01:05:30.320, Speaker D: That's great.
01:05:30.432 - 01:05:48.624, Speaker A: And just as we're sort of wrapping up here, just a little bit on Ethereum before we go here. So are you dropping on, refresh my memory. Is it on manifold that you're. I thought I saw work on manifold XYz. But are you also on foundation or super rare? Where are you putting work out on Ethereum?
01:05:49.764 - 01:05:54.904, Speaker E: Man, I wish it wasn't super rare. I'm sure you can get off. No.
01:05:56.644 - 01:05:57.396, Speaker C: I don't know, dude.
01:05:57.420 - 01:05:59.316, Speaker E: I tried out, like, in the end.
01:05:59.340 - 01:06:01.792, Speaker C: Of December of last year, but they.
01:06:01.808 - 01:06:10.016, Speaker E: Didn'T come back to me yet. So, you know, it's all good. But I dropped a piece. It was the last redux piece on.
01:06:10.040 - 01:06:14.400, Speaker C: Foundation and I'll still there, but I'm.
01:06:14.432 - 01:06:16.784, Speaker E: Doing the smart contract and manifold.
01:06:16.944 - 01:06:21.724, Speaker C: I'm minting through the manifold, but then I'm missing on foundation.
01:06:22.784 - 01:06:34.762, Speaker A: Right. I like that, actually. I do. I think I did the same thing recently, actually. I mean, it's interesting. You can technically, you can mint on super rare and then list on foundation if you want to.
01:06:34.858 - 01:06:35.494, Speaker D: Right.
01:06:35.874 - 01:06:37.090, Speaker E: It's really funny how that works.
01:06:37.122 - 01:06:38.546, Speaker D: Right? Yeah.
01:06:38.570 - 01:06:40.434, Speaker C: Like foundation in that sense.
01:06:40.554 - 01:06:40.922, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:06:40.978 - 01:06:45.178, Speaker A: Like they let you do any. It's basically an auction function, right?
01:06:45.346 - 01:06:47.014, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:06:47.354 - 01:07:01.222, Speaker E: Initially I tried listing on the Manifold gallery, which is super cool, but the whole deal with it doesn't have that search function, which foundation has. So I delisted it and relisted it.
01:07:01.238 - 01:07:07.694, Speaker C: On foundation, which, I mean, what do you know? I mean, like I said, the manifold.
01:07:07.774 - 01:07:09.582, Speaker E: Is cool, but you'll have to sort.
01:07:09.598 - 01:07:14.314, Speaker C: Of depend only on Twitter. Multi mouth.
01:07:14.854 - 01:07:15.550, Speaker D: Exactly.
01:07:15.622 - 01:07:19.394, Speaker E: And the algorithm has been a bitch lately, so, you know.
01:07:20.664 - 01:07:21.136, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:07:21.200 - 01:07:23.284, Speaker E: Like, so it's kind of hard to depend on that.
01:07:23.704 - 01:07:36.384, Speaker A: It's the social network side of these platforms that are the real, like, value. Because, you know, it's sort of like if you list on object, for example, it's, well, I'm going to get a notification and I'm going to see about that.
01:07:36.464 - 01:07:36.728, Speaker C: Right.
01:07:36.776 - 01:07:46.712, Speaker A: And then if I'm following you on foundation, then I'll get maybe an email that you have, you know, listed on foundation. So it really is. Yeah, go ahead.
01:07:46.808 - 01:07:47.564, Speaker C: It is.
01:07:47.984 - 01:08:03.576, Speaker E: That's why I'm so fond of object, by the way. I mean, that's the first thing that caught to me when I, when I first started minting an object. This whole social media aspect of it, it's really cool. I mean, it's so much easier to.
01:08:03.600 - 01:08:10.712, Speaker C: Find new work and follow up on artists you like.
01:08:10.768 - 01:08:11.824, Speaker E: I mean, it's really cool.
01:08:11.944 - 01:08:13.204, Speaker C: I like that aspect.
01:08:13.574 - 01:08:16.422, Speaker E: So, yeah, I'll mint it on foundation.
01:08:16.478 - 01:08:21.354, Speaker C: Later today because, you know, it's easier.
01:08:22.534 - 01:08:28.814, Speaker B: Are there any artists that you've been collecting or people you've been looking at recently that have really caught your attention?
01:08:28.974 - 01:08:30.118, Speaker D: Oh, yeah, yeah.
01:08:30.246 - 01:08:35.194, Speaker C: Let me just open up my own page here. Just a second.
01:08:35.854 - 01:08:41.514, Speaker E: I mean, one artist has been, I've been collecting a lot lately, has been captain or Shiko jam.
01:08:41.884 - 01:08:43.604, Speaker C: He does some really cool pixlr.
01:08:43.644 - 01:08:47.004, Speaker E: I love his work. Yeah, his work is fucking amazing, dude.
01:08:47.164 - 01:08:52.124, Speaker C: And there's this other person, Cuda, who.
01:08:52.164 - 01:08:53.844, Speaker E: Also does some pixel work.
01:08:54.004 - 01:08:56.184, Speaker C: A lot of cmy, huh?
01:09:01.444 - 01:09:01.900, Speaker D: Oh.
01:09:01.972 - 01:09:12.334, Speaker E: Send it to you afterwards. It's a lot of really cool pixel work. And I like it because they do these. These pieces, which look like old game uis.
01:09:12.874 - 01:09:15.506, Speaker C: And I love that so much. It's so fucking awesome.
01:09:15.650 - 01:09:33.680, Speaker E: And there's this one I found these days in the beginning of the week. Let me just open up because I don't remember her name now. On object, she's as if I'm not mistaken. Sorry if I butchered your name.
01:09:33.802 - 01:09:35.452, Speaker C: Uh, tasty adipla.
01:09:35.588 - 01:09:52.104, Speaker E: And she does these paintings which are kind of. They're super eerie and phantasmagorical. I love them. She. In fact, she does have some collection called Lost Ghosts.
01:09:52.404 - 01:09:57.700, Speaker C: And it's all super. I mean, it's not horror oriented or anything, but.
01:09:57.892 - 01:10:00.252, Speaker E: But it's got this eerie feel to it, and I just love it.
01:10:00.268 - 01:10:00.564, Speaker A: All the.
01:10:00.604 - 01:10:08.384, Speaker E: All the subjects of her period paintings, they're just these. They have this phantasmagorical feel to it. I mean, it's.
01:10:08.764 - 01:10:11.564, Speaker C: I've been really, really, really in love with their work.
01:10:11.724 - 01:10:13.988, Speaker E: And what else have you been picking up, like, lately?
01:10:14.076 - 01:10:15.504, Speaker C: Why don't you just check it out?

01:10:24.100 - 01:10:27.904, Speaker C: I've been very. I've been taking up a few by new.
01:10:29.224 - 01:10:34.804, Speaker E: Yeah, yeah, I think they're newcomers. I've been picking up a few from Popple as well.
01:10:35.184 - 01:10:36.800, Speaker C: Popple is just fucking amazing.
01:10:36.912 - 01:10:41.644, Speaker E: Their pixel work is soft fucking charts.
01:10:42.024 - 01:10:47.324, Speaker C: I picked this one up lately by bored boy, which.

01:10:53.624 - 01:10:55.484, Speaker C: I'm very fond of pixel art.
01:10:56.864 - 01:11:06.016, Speaker E: Sometimes I joke around, say that I'm a frustrated pixel artist because I've always wanted to do pixel art, but I've never had the patience to do it. But I'm a super fan of Pixar.
01:11:06.080 - 01:11:07.764, Speaker C: It's so fucking cool.
01:11:09.744 - 01:11:16.896, Speaker E: And then there's the usuals I try to pick up whenever I can. Like compassage.

01:11:39.892 - 01:11:43.224, Speaker C: Things here and there just to, you know, keep things flowing.
01:11:45.744 - 01:11:48.096, Speaker E: It's funny, there's so many amazing artists on Tezos.
01:11:48.160 - 01:11:49.644, Speaker C: Just mind blowing, dude.
01:11:50.704 - 01:11:52.244, Speaker E: I remember when I first.
01:11:53.264 - 01:11:54.560, Speaker C: Yeah, it's amazing.
01:11:54.632 - 01:11:56.232, Speaker E: I remember when I first came to.
01:11:56.248 - 01:12:02.176, Speaker C: Tezos and I was just scrolling through.
01:12:02.200 - 01:12:15.302, Speaker E: All the art and all the different kinds of artists, and it was just. It's so amazing to see all these different kinds of artists just doing their thing and being super artistically honest. It's so inspiring.
01:12:15.358 - 01:12:17.394, Speaker C: It's super fucking cool.
01:12:18.294 - 01:12:19.406, Speaker E: I love it. So.
01:12:19.510 - 01:12:20.118, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:12:20.246 - 01:12:20.726, Speaker D: But these are.
01:12:20.750 - 01:12:27.862, Speaker C: A few have been picking up lately, and I'll probably pick up a few later. A lot of cool people.
01:12:27.918 - 01:12:46.054, Speaker E: Tom Bombadil has been doing some cool things as well with the spectrum collection. There's this other pixel artist I'm very fond of, Stalomere. They dropped a piece, which I really love. Yeah, the. What's the name of the piece? Phantom.
01:12:46.834 - 01:12:47.666, Speaker D: God damn it.
01:12:47.690 - 01:12:49.294, Speaker C: Open up so I can see the name.
01:12:50.874 - 01:12:51.346, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:12:51.410 - 01:12:59.610, Speaker A: Salomere. I was in a pixel. I was in a pixel art space that retro Manny had put on. Shout out, retro Manny.
01:12:59.642 - 01:13:00.762, Speaker C: I see you down there.
01:13:00.858 - 01:13:08.908, Speaker A: And what was so fascinating about Stalamere is he comes from a family of stained glass makers, right? Like, so.
01:13:08.956 - 01:13:09.744, Speaker E: Oh, really?
01:13:10.684 - 01:13:11.180, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:13:11.252 - 01:13:14.904, Speaker A: So that's, like, why he kind of has this kind of stained glass look.
01:13:15.684 - 01:13:16.292, Speaker D: Is that interesting?
01:13:16.308 - 01:13:16.780, Speaker E: Oh, wow.
01:13:16.852 - 01:13:17.988, Speaker C: That's so cool.
01:13:18.156 - 01:13:19.004, Speaker D: That's so cool.
01:13:19.044 - 01:13:19.492, Speaker E: Yeah.
01:13:19.588 - 01:13:20.220, Speaker C: Wow.
01:13:20.372 - 01:13:21.012, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:13:21.148 - 01:13:23.144, Speaker E: I picked up the phantom.
01:13:23.884 - 01:13:24.260, Speaker D: Sorry.
01:13:24.292 - 01:13:24.652, Speaker A: Go ahead.
01:13:24.708 - 01:13:26.196, Speaker D: Go ahead. No, go ahead.
01:13:26.260 - 01:13:27.464, Speaker C: No, I picked up that.
01:13:27.924 - 01:13:39.786, Speaker E: The phantom of abandoned water tower, they. They dropped few weeks back, and I just love that piece, dude. It's so fucking awesome. But damn, the whole stained glass story, that's so cool, dude.
01:13:39.890 - 01:13:41.414, Speaker C: I wasn't aware of that.
01:13:42.194 - 01:13:55.610, Speaker A: It kind of explains a lot. I think it was Stalin, maybe. I'm thinking, was it Stalamere? Or wait, maybe it's someone else. I might be Armilk. Sorry. I confused him with Armilk 88. My mistake.
01:13:55.682 - 01:13:56.374, Speaker D: Sorry.
01:13:57.514 - 01:14:13.978, Speaker A: I'm just seeing Salamere's page. It's our milk 88, I think is the name of the artist. I'm checking out Cuda here too. You have a very interesting collection here. I picked up the cat. I've been shopping while you've been talking, like, cuda. Arcana territory.
01:14:13.978 - 01:14:18.674, Speaker A: That's rad. That video game artist. Like, wow, that's super cool.
01:14:18.794 - 01:14:19.114, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:14:19.154 - 01:14:20.378, Speaker A: So you guys are already talking.
01:14:20.426 - 01:14:20.626, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:14:20.650 - 01:14:21.774, Speaker E: This Arcana territory.
01:14:22.654 - 01:14:23.470, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:14:23.662 - 01:14:32.174, Speaker E: There's so much pixel. It's funny because here in Brazil, I know a lot of indie devs, and.
01:14:32.294 - 01:14:43.414, Speaker C: You know, I know a lot of pixel artists involved in the development of games and such. And it was always very frustrating because.
01:14:43.454 - 01:14:44.974, Speaker E: I'm a big fan of them, and.
01:14:45.094 - 01:14:48.462, Speaker C: I'd always be like, dude, this was before nfts.
01:14:48.478 - 01:15:06.294, Speaker E: And, dude, just make a print or whatever. I pay whatever for something, you know, but with these pixel art and shit. But they never do it they'd always be, you know, just focused on making games, which is cool, which is okay. And that's what struck me the most.
01:15:06.334 - 01:15:08.990, Speaker C: I mean, when getting into nfts, it's.
01:15:09.022 - 01:15:16.474, Speaker E: Just that, well, now I can finally purchase pixel art, you know, and it's truest form. I mean, it's there.
01:15:17.254 - 01:15:17.870, Speaker D: I agree.
01:15:17.942 - 01:15:32.494, Speaker A: It's so exciting and so. Well, we should probably wrap this up. I'm going to have to go here pretty soon. Do you have any final thoughts, Daniel? W. That you'd just like us to know? Any sort of ideas or thoughts? What do you want us to know that maybe we don't.
01:15:32.534 - 01:15:33.598, Speaker D: Haven't heard yet?
01:15:33.766 - 01:15:35.406, Speaker E: Well, closing thoughts.

01:16:01.124 - 01:16:04.092, Speaker A: Yeah, no, it. We're always hardest on ourselves on these things, so.

01:16:22.544 - 01:16:31.184, Speaker A: I totally agree. Yeah. I'm learning about new artists here. Literally. I was shopping. I wish I could afford Cuda. Cuda is like a really rad artist.
01:16:31.184 - 01:16:48.362, Speaker A: C u d A. I'll have to check out your collection a little more. There's always new discoveries on tv, tezos and everywhere in this whole NfT ecosystem.
