00:00:03.800 - 00:00:26.394, Speaker A: We are back, ladies and gentlemen, and everyone, thank you for coming back. The questions are getting much more sophisticated out here. I had to even study up a little bit. So we're a little late getting out as usual. Welcome back. Artist journal, May 8, 2023. Broadcasting to the world from the ship in my mind on a beautiful sunny day on the high seas of the imagination.
00:00:26.394 - 00:01:01.024, Speaker A: My name is Adrian Pokebelli, and welcome, welcome. Look at this gorgeous work by Buboy, who has captured the moment. Of course, many people have been getting rich off of Pepe. I remember looking at it when it had dropped down to, like, zero, zero, 220 x ago and going, well, that was probably it. Maybe I should probably get it. But, you know, that was probably it anyway, I'm sure many stories are like that out there. I never got it.
00:01:01.024 - 00:01:28.084, Speaker A: It would have been nice. But anyways, so it goes. I'm really happy, though, for everybody out there that is making money on that whole coin. So anyway, so Buboy with a Pepe theme here. And of course, Pepe is the frog here, if you're unaware. I mean, I'm kind of back to buboy being super, incredibly impressive. The last time we started a show with Buboy, it's not the first time, was with the Guernica.
00:01:28.084 - 00:02:15.504, Speaker A: Remember that insanely beautiful work, Guernica. And, like, even this work, like, when I was stepping back, drinking my coffee earlier, and I was looking at the screen, I mean, it really holds together well. I'm sure you can make a black and white desaturated mix really easily, and it would still hold beautifully together. There's so much in here that, you know, like, again, like, what are these swimmers doing here with a happy face? And you have the artist and really beautifully done, actually, like, even just getting this perspective, like, you know, it sounds easy. It looks like, again, buboy makes it look easy. The sign of someone who really knows what they're doing. So Buboy continues to just win me over here.
00:02:15.504 - 00:03:01.180, Speaker A: And even an interesting, like, what is this background here? I mean, it looks like a window looking off into the backyard. And where there's another kind of square house and a car. And even just how the car lines up. There is so much in here, even like this paper sailboat. Another good reason to start it in the waves. There's some real surreal illustration going on here, isn't there? I mean, more paper sailboats probably, you know, copied and pasted, you know, so playing with digital idea, you know, digital techniques with illustration. So, like, probably not necessarily, but probably.
00:03:01.180 - 00:03:28.088, Speaker A: But here, I mean, this seems like it's repeated but with slightly bigger scale. And again, the person painting, just some landscape with the pepe mask. You know, there is a lot going on in here. And so anyways, and the color, you know, the color is beautiful too. This kind of retro print kind of color, kind of desaturated a little bit. Nothing's too bright. It almost seems like there's a paper texture here.
00:03:28.088 - 00:03:50.380, Speaker A: Remember we were talking about gloom tube and also myth using these textured papers, these virtual textured, textured papers. Anyways, we're doing good keeping them shorter here. Let's stick to the program. So a bid was placed. So this was listed at 08:36 p.m. On on May 7. So last night and for 0.795
00:03:50.380 - 00:04:16.578, Speaker A: and already this morning, there's a bid place 12 hours later. So being recognized by the market here, this is in a world, a foundation world. Maybe we can quickly look at that buboy map to Pepe room. This is the map to Pepe land where Pepe is. It's peaceful and green. If you can analyze the map and came to this land, you will find peace that you will have never seen before. Hope you enjoy it and continue fantasizing with me.
00:04:16.578 - 00:04:54.546, Speaker A: 5500 by 4300 dpi. So anyways, a pretty awesome work. And I'd say like the best capturing of the, you know, like the most sophist, the most, you know, compositionally complex capturing of the moment of this pepe coin. And who knows, maybe it's accidental that he's doing that now, but probably not. Anyways, awesome work. Thank you everybody who picked up McDonald's employee. And thank you to Kableen for retweeting it out in her 30 pieces that she puts out every day here.
00:04:54.546 - 00:05:19.972, Speaker A: A nice compliment to this show if you're into the NFT scene. So anyways, so this is part of the pixel art sketchbook and yeah, just playing with dithering and different kinds of dithering and randomness and everything. Thank you for that. This is of course a promoted story here. You can see the promoted links. I'll probably have another one out today. So anyway, thank you to all the collectors here on primary as well as secondary.
00:05:19.972 - 00:06:00.364, Speaker A: There's Heidi, Rocket, Sabato, Dede and Evelyn O. So anyways, just making me continue to be happy to be out here in NFT land as an artist. So that is wonderful. So some comments here. First of all, this is from a couple of days ago, a couple of shows ago. And it was Santiago who was describing, put in a late comment here describing remember the generative art program or collection that Santiago put together with emergent properties? Right, the body. So thanks so much for the feature.
00:06:00.364 - 00:06:45.148, Speaker A: I love all your ideas around the project. Emergent properties, or m props, is a platform that has some story of exploration and now focuses on random deterministic render of AI images. So almost, I mean, some people consider AI generative art of a certain kind, but this is almost another, like another play on generative art because it's using this random deterministic render of AI images. If that's technically correct or set in the right way, I don't know. Yeah, exactly. I mean, this is so new that we're still trying to figure out how to describe what we're talking about here. It uses a transactions hash to make the seed that will go to stable diffusion to make those images in my project.
00:06:45.148 - 00:07:29.754, Speaker A: The prompts are a complex set of prompts and subprompts that I've worked on with their team. And once the NFT is minted, the randomly built prompt is fixed from all my work, making random parts of them, and that goes to stable diffusion, and then it's upscaled a bit, and that's the media of the NFT. So this is getting pretty wild. So thank you for explaining that, Santiago, great to hear from you. It's always awesome to hear from the artists that are in the program who comment and respond and share more information. So super fascinating. A few comments here on the simulation episode brought on by Aksin's comment here and Rune two.
00:07:29.754 - 00:08:08.084, Speaker A: Thank you everybody. Stalka and Tornado talking about the dancing baby and Rune tune. Had a comment here I just wanted to highlight. I'm really enjoying this pataphysics Baudrillard simulation conversation, and I especially love that UK scene is pushing the conversation forward. Simulation, simulacra and questioning reality is one of my favorite philosophical topics, especially when it intersects art and entertainment. To be in dialogue with these thinkers and artists is one of the many things holding my interest captive. Something I've often pulled from Baudrillard is that to an extent, the simulation becomes more real than reality.
00:08:08.084 - 00:08:56.714, Speaker A: The simulation becomes more real than reality. And this is an idea that was far ahead of its time, given our current circumstances of social media, digital, everything. Right? So I'm kind of back and we're going to look at more comments here, right? Because there's nothing new in a sense about deception and that things not representing or being distorted, distorted representations again. And we'll go back to Plato, courtesy of RJ here. But going back to Plato, that the copy is a distortion of the original, right. The copy is a second order of the original mimesis and the. So there's nothing new in the copy, right? Or that there being a distortion in the copy.
00:08:56.714 - 00:09:41.186, Speaker A: With Baudrillard, I always come back to this part that I think it's very much a philosophy of the mass media. And as we're going to see here, I actually brought up chat GPT to help me out because, you know, this is, yeah, this is getting pretty cerebral out here. But all to say it's. I see, I always see Baudrillard's thoughts in the context of the mass media, which to me helps just kind of place it because one could argue many of these ideas kind of previously existed. Not all, but many, but have been given a different twist. So anyway, so let's look at that because we actually have a ton to get through here as far as this specific subject. And I think axin here and look, there's gogolite.
00:09:41.186 - 00:10:09.734, Speaker A: I mean, look at the artists here. Everything that talks about simulation interests me. So go, go. Litis is into the conversation too. So anyways, great to hear from Ed, eternity, Haiti, rocket and ukscene here, which I wanted to highlight because this is more of our conversation. Definitely think that thinkers like Baudrillard have given us tools to reassemble and try to understand daily matters such as AI or the Gulf war. That's what timeless texts do.
00:10:09.734 - 00:11:11.454, Speaker A: They remain applicable to technologies of 100 years later. Happy Friday. So first of all, thank you for the comment. And yeah, so I was sort of wondering about this whole, you know, should we call it a simulation? So I brought up chat cheap et to help us out here with what are we talking about here? Because the first rule of, you know, we were doing a little bit of philosophy here, and the first rule of western philosophy, as far as I understand it, and that's the only philosophy I've ever been semi trained in, is to define your terms. So we kind of have to, because we can have some sort of conversation about all this, but if we don't know what we're talking about by simulation and all that, then it's kind of, we're just listening to ourselves speak. So I am bringing this up here for all our benefit and maybe, I mean, yeah, so from, because for me it's not clear. So let's see if we can figure this out.
00:11:11.454 - 00:11:56.500, Speaker A: Okay, so realistic AI generated imagery such as those created by Diepler. So here. Okay, I started out with Oxine's question, how does realistic AI imagery relate to Jean Baudrillard's concept of simulation. So he now, for those that don't know, we'll go through this very quickly here, because some people might not know who Jean Baudrillard is. First of all, Jean Baudrierd's concept of simulation is closely related to the emergence of realistic AI generated imagery. So chat GPT four is agreeing with Euxine, by the way. Baudrillard, a french sociologist and philosopher, introduced the concept of simulation in his famous book Simulacra and Simulations in 1981.
00:11:56.500 - 00:13:01.448, Speaker A: He argued that in the postmodern age, the distinction between the real and the simulated has become increasingly blurred, leading to a world where reality is replaced by hyper reality, a reality constructed entirely of simulations. So we're going to go into what simulation means in a second here. But first of all, realistic AI generated imagery to answer Euxine's questions, such as those created by deep learning algorithms like Gans, are prime examples of simulations as described by Baudrillard. These images are artificial constructs that mimic or imitate reality, but are not real themselves. So, okay. And I mean, there's a lot that can be argued here is like, I mean, put it this way, language is very slippery, and we could spend all day parsing this out. But if it's from AI, is it an imitation of reality? In the sense, like, if you do a portrait of me, we could say that's a copy and an imitation of me, right? It's an image of me, a copy of me.
00:13:01.448 - 00:13:34.004, Speaker A: But is AI doing that? I'm not sure. I guess it samples a whole bunch, and then it creates something out of that. So maybe. But maybe that's not exactly the same thing we mean by imitate reality. But let's just give it the benefit of the doubt, the charity of interpretation. So these images are artificial constructs referring to AI that mimic or imitate reality but are not real themselves. They challenge our understanding of what is real and authentic as they become indistinguishable from actual photographs or images.
00:13:34.004 - 00:14:19.264, Speaker A: And so here, okay, so maybe the deep fake, right? Where imagine you have Joe Biden, artificial image constructed, and then you get him to say certain things. This is why it's so dangerous, right? The deepfakes. And all of a sudden, he can be saying certain things, and you have world war three, but it's all just simulation, right? So according to this definition. So Baudrillard's concept of simulation can be applied to AI generated imagery in several ways. Simulacra, which is kind of indistinguishable, from simulation. As we're going to see. AI generated images represent simulacra, which are copies or imitations of real world objects or events that no longer have an original reference.
00:14:19.264 - 00:15:01.844, Speaker A: As these images become more realistic and ubiquitous, they contribute to the erosion of the distinction between reality and simulation. So no longer have an original reference. Maybe that is what we're talking, what I was just talking about with AI imagery, in a sense, the original reference has disappeared, is exactly what I was just saying. If you do the portrait of me, the reference is still there, but with AI, we actually don't have the original reference. So that is a simulacra, also known as a simulation. So hyper reality, and I don't want to get too deep in this, but we have to go a little bit and then we can kind of know what we're saying when we continue this discussion. Hyper reality.
00:15:01.844 - 00:15:59.030, Speaker A: The increasing prevalence of realistic AI generated images contributes to the development of a hyper real world. This world is dominated by simulations, where people may find it challenging to differentiate between what is real and what is artificially generated and the procession of simulacra. Baudrillard claims that in a world of simulations, the simulacra precede the real, meaning that the artificial construct creates a new reality that supersedes the original. In the context of AI generated imagery, the images generated by algorithms can shape our perception of reality, potentially altering our understanding of what is authentic or genuine. Genuine. So the idea that the simulation or the simulacra proceeds comes before the real and changes our understanding of what is authentic or genuine or what the nature of that real thing is. So anyways, here's just some color here for you.
00:15:59.030 - 00:17:13.734, Speaker A: And just to boil it down here, there's, you know, I asked the question, what is Jean Baudrillard's concept of simulation? And here's a very important definition right here. Simulation is the process by which reality is replaced with signs and symbols, leading to the creation of a hyper reality, a reality that is more real than real. So again, this is very loose, and I'm always back to as well, this idea that Baudrillard was a, he's one of these post structuralist guys, and I often think of them as, and he's one of my favorite of them, but they're kind of, in my universe, somewhat failed novelists who became academics and put out all their imagination into their critical theory. So the reason I'm saying that is let's not worry about them necess. Like, I don't think we should try and create a system that's totally logically secure, shall we say? Because I don't think we're going to find it. And I think they would laugh at us. Okay, further, if we start going, oh, well, a equals b and b c, therefore a equals c.
00:17:13.734 - 00:18:07.382, Speaker A: I think we just have to kind of take these as ideas, as I was saying last time, to kind of vault off of. Right? So simulation is the process by which reality is replaced with signs and symbols. I mean, very lacking detail here, leading to the creation of a hyper reality, a reality that is more real than real. This hyper reality is characterized by the inability to distinguish between what is real and what is a simulation or representation. So with AI art, again, we are, the simulation idea is very complementary. So finally here, Baudrillard identified four stages of the sign's relationship with reality. So the sign being the signifier, what we see as the representation of meaning, shall we say.
00:18:07.382 - 00:18:46.512, Speaker A: The first stage is a reflection of basic reality, in which a sign is a direct representation of reality, such as a photograph or a painting that depicts a real object or scene. We're saying my portrait. So there's the first basic copy. Then the second is a distorted version, which is the second stage is the masking or perverting of a basic reality in which a sign distorts the reality it represents. Like advertisement or we could say, or propaganda. Right. The third is masking the absence of a basic reality in which a sign pretends to represent a reality that does not actually exist, such as the portrayal of an idealized lifestyle in a tv show or movie.
00:18:46.512 - 00:19:29.974, Speaker A: Again, this could also work. This could work with our AI imagery because there is no reference underneath other than we could say, like the. We could say the masses of images that go to make that one image, but there's nothing we can point to. And finally, the fourth and final stage is pure simulation, in which a sign bears no relationship to any reality whatsoever, and the distinction between the real and imagined becomes irrelevant. So we were talking about the unconscious, how that exists in this stage. The sign has no origin or reality and only refers to other signs. So anyways, we're getting deep in the weeds here.
00:19:29.974 - 00:20:16.984, Speaker A: And basically, simulacra is basically the same thing. It's basically the same definition here. So as you can see, when I ask GPT four to define simulacra, basically they mean the same thing. Maybe it's just like, you know, let's just look at the term simulacra to describe a phenomenon in which the distinction between the real and the representation of reality becomes blurred or non existent. In his work, Baudrillard posits that contemporary society has become dominated by images and simulations, which he refers to as simulacra. So images and simulations, which you're. So you see what I'm saying? They're almost interchangeable.
00:20:16.984 - 00:21:01.524, Speaker A: But maybe a real expert might have a different, you know, take on that. So, and here's hyper reality is to describe a state in which boundaries between reality and simulation become increasingly blurred. According to Baudrillard, hyperreality is a postmodern condition where simulated experience says, replace or surpass authentic experiences, leading to a loss of connection with the real world. So this is an interesting detail. So where the simulation triumphs over the so called real or authentic experiences. So this is all just kind of background here. Yeah.
00:21:01.524 - 00:21:43.124, Speaker A: So here's. Okay. And here are some examples of hyper reality to kind of finish our definitions here. Some examples of hyper reality include virtual reality. Okay, so, I mean, we could say AI images, theme parks. So a kind of, you know, the Star wars theme park at Disneyland, let's say, staged media events where the lines between the reality and fiction are intentionally blurred to create an immersive experience that often feels more authentic or fulfilling than everyday life. And we see this every day in, like, political television, like in so called news television, where the lines between reality and fiction are intentionally blurred to create.
00:21:43.124 - 00:22:11.874, Speaker A: In a sense, oftentimes, you get the sense that the narrative is coming precedes the reality. There's almost. The narrative will come out as. And it, you know, which we could argue is very hyper real as we're looking in the definitions here. Right? So that, again, the narrative precedes what's actually going on. So, in, you know, now that we've gone through all these weeds here, actually quite useful and not. Doesn't seem inaccurate, shall we say? But that could be debated.
00:22:11.874 - 00:22:50.806, Speaker A: So, and we're back to this idea that this creates a loss of connection with the actual world. And finally, RJ weighed in, and it's getting cerebral out here. But we're almost done, and we're almost back to the art here. But this is important. And in a sense, you know, it's kind of back to Gertrude Stein and the salons here. You know, like, let no one say there are unserious artists in the scene, okay? And what I like about this is this is a very genuine conversation. I've been to many art, you know, talks here in Berlin, and it doesn't necessarily feel as genuine oftentimes.
00:22:50.806 - 00:23:14.534, Speaker A: So I'm loving this. And this is back to this idea. Let no one say there are unserious artists in this scene. They're dealing with major issues here. And finally, if you check out Plato's sophist, a mature, very advanced dialogue, you might have already. I've taken a class, believe it or not, on the sophist. I will admit this, though I've never finished it.
00:23:14.534 - 00:23:46.494, Speaker A: I started reading it at least twice. Like, I've gotten halfway through it twice. It is a very difficult dialogue. It's again a later dialogue where the stranger appears and kind of replaces Socrates in the dialogue. I think Socrates, if I remember right, is at the very start. So anyways, let's look at this comment. There's a great tie in the sophist between Plato and Vaudriard on Simulacra, the former suggesting that the purposeful enlargement of the top of the sculptures to give them the appearance of realism to the viewer below.
00:23:46.494 - 00:24:32.164, Speaker A: So this is true of, say, Michelangelo's David. To give us a concrete example here, where he made the large, that the top larger, so that when you're looking below Michelangelo's David, it looked proper, it looked right. And this was an old technique, apparently, that they used even in ancient Greece, the purposeful enlargement of the top of the sculptures. So this being a kind of simulation, you know, to create the sense of. But again, I'm kind of back to this idea, you know, appearance, and is this just about appearance and reality? So again, so now that we see this, that it kind of. That there is this similarity and. Sorry, let me actually finish RJ's comment.
00:24:32.164 - 00:25:17.036, Speaker A: What I was just going to say quickly, though, is I think we see how Baudrards is a philosophy of the mass media. I keep coming back to that, because otherwise I'm not sure how much is new here. So renders them. So this idea of distorting the statue renders them simulacra or likeness. Likenesses, definitely also agree with oxygen on the brodriadian take on AI as simulacra, whereby in this understanding, they exist as imitations of absent originals. Okay, so we're back to this idea of absent, no reference, no original, nothing being directly copied that we can point to. So I think, like, this was worth our time.
00:25:17.036 - 00:26:05.770, Speaker A: I hope I haven't lost the audience here. And finally here I asked chat GPT, this wonderful AI assistant, to show the tie between Plato's sophist and the enlargement on the top of sculptures to give them the appearance of realism and Baudrillard's concept of simulacra. And we kind of are back to this idea of appearance and reality. Yeah. As you can see here, Plato's sophist, as previously mentioned, focuses on the deceptive rhetoric and manipulation of language by sophists who are paid teachers in ancient Greece. That's what sophist means in order to win debates rather than pursue the truth. And, yeah, we've gone very deep into this, but we can go deeper in a future episode.
00:26:05.770 - 00:26:57.128, Speaker A: It raises questions about the nature of reality and the dangers of illusion and misrepresentation. So again, and now comparing it to Baudrillard concept of simulacra, on the other hand, addresses the proliferation of images and representations in contemporary society in the way these images have replaced reality itself. In the world of simulacra, the distinction between the real and the representation has collapsed, leading to a hyper real existence where people struggle to differentiate between the two. I mean, your classic example of this is, you know, the influencer, the fake influencer, we might say, who has. Who buys their followers. And then you think that's real, right? Or buys, you know, their views or whatever else. And then you think that's real.
00:26:57.128 - 00:27:35.398, Speaker A: And that, in a weird way, becomes the reality, right? So, yeah. So anyways, very interesting, very cerebral conversation we're having here. I hope I haven't left lost, or put it this way. If you want to learn more about Plato, what I would suggest is read the apology. It's very accessible and it reads like a novel. You can read it in a few days or not even, you know, a few sittings. And it's a great, actual, very important dialogue.
00:27:35.398 - 00:27:58.278, Speaker A: If you're looking to start now, this was a funny thing to see in relation to our whole discussion here that we've just had. How are we doing? 27 minutes. My God. Mid journey has become way too restrictive on prompts. Very bad for fashion and art. So it's become very restrictive. Restrictions on art limit creativity and should be protected just as much as free speech.
00:27:58.278 - 00:28:46.786, Speaker A: But it's a great time for competitors. What is your favorite mid journey alternative? So, strange thing is kind of getting fed up. Sounds like it's getting more and more restrictive, which is kind of interesting when we think of it in the context of our whole conversation here, right? And even this distortion. And again, if it's bringing about only certain kinds of results, is that distorting reality at a certain point, or at least our understanding of reality, what we think reality is. Polygon, 1993. I don't think we looked at these. Did we look at how great this is so the person who makes those amazing million person gifts, the gifts that a million people see, they have physical representations here.
00:28:46.786 - 00:29:03.948, Speaker A: Really nicely done here. I like the shininess too. It almost captures the sense. And you see the ext three up there. It almost captures the sense of the original gifs. I mean, they're not moving. I don't think they're holograms.
00:29:03.948 - 00:29:29.744, Speaker A: They are not. But I mean, a really creative representation and pretty good looking. Okay, so finally some art here. Is AI secretly consuming your average consumer profile? Discover the shocking truth. So I'm thinking here that auxine here is using AI because we even see it here. This looks like AI type writing here. Who knows? But it looks like axine is incorporating AI.
00:29:29.744 - 00:30:02.364, Speaker A: Very nice detail there. This is an addition of 30 and you can buy it on secondary for only 66, which is pretty reasonable for an euxine. Beautiful textures and more so. And here's another, another treatment of the skull being circling around here. So very cool. And here's Spogel's maskinen email. So kind of a creepy work here of a skeleton going from one computer to another with trademark dithering here and a heavy red sort of vibe here.
00:30:02.364 - 00:30:23.058, Speaker A: 0.75 ETH is the. Is the reserve. And let's reload this wonderful work here by Sabato. Trust the process. Now this is for super chief bad glitches only exhibition at NFT roam. That would be a fun opening to go to.
00:30:23.058 - 00:30:37.186, Speaker A: And so this sold for five ETH. Big congrats to Sabato. That's about $1,000, $900. And let's see if we can get it loading properly. It's a little slow right now. It's kind of cool to see it slow, though. So here is.
00:30:37.186 - 00:30:53.182, Speaker A: But we're missing all the glitches here. Let's see if we can get it properly. And I'm pretty sure that this glitches out. Maybe that was just my version. I thought this glitched out. So we'll let. Here we go.
00:30:53.182 - 00:31:16.234, Speaker A: And there it is. There we go. So it might be in slow motion here. So just so everybody knows. But it's kind of cool to see it in slow motion, isn't it? So anyways, look at that. So very cool work by Sabato for NFT Rome for a glitch show in Rome. So very nice.
00:31:16.234 - 00:31:46.244, Speaker A: Francoise Gamma with a beautiful piece. Kind of unusual looking work for Francoise. This hand, that kind of, you know, again. But it's also playing a little bit with this idea of the disintegration of the body, but a completely different take on it and then letting it kind of drag a little bit, leaving the drag. So any, a little bit of feedback left there, for lack of a better term, human quiet soldier. I managed to get this. I was in an auction battle with Ilay.
00:31:46.244 - 00:32:03.374, Speaker A: Shout out to Ilay. I almost felt bad about that. Anyway, it didn't go too far and I wasn't going to push it too far, but she let me have it. So thank you. And thank you to human kernel. So beautiful looking work here. A beautiful interesting one of one for the human kernel collection here.
00:32:03.374 - 00:32:11.902, Speaker A: Made in dpaint.org dot. So this is deluxe paint. And I brought up this website for us. So look at this deluxe paint. Two. You just go to dpaint.org
00:32:11.902 - 00:32:42.000, Speaker A: and let's say I pick g and actually let's pick one with some color in it. Let's go with e. And there we go. And so how cool is this? It's got some pretty cool sound effects. And let's go here. So anyways, you can start to see de paint in action here. And so anyways, as you can see, I'm pretty amateur at this.
00:32:42.000 - 00:32:58.638, Speaker A: I actually had kind of nice things going on earlier. There we go. Look at that. So then you can change the color here and everything. So I don't know how to save this. I mean, you can do save picture, but I guess that's my computer. But a, B, C, D, e, f.
00:32:58.638 - 00:33:16.062, Speaker A: That doesn't look right. So anyways, interesting. Now, interestingly, this was also made on dpaint.org by santiago. So kind of a similar looking work, eh? So this is an edition of 20 for five tazos. So kind of cool. It has some letters in here.
00:33:16.062 - 00:33:36.732, Speaker A: So making very nice work with d paint. So I'll have to learn how to animate too. I don't even know how to animate with dpaint, but anyways, very cool. Artmadewithdpaint.org dot. So interesting. This was just kind of an interesting gift that I saw by manic dystopia, who's someone on super rare.
00:33:36.732 - 00:34:08.614, Speaker A: They did not mint this from what I could tell. But interesting looking piece kind of reminded me of hastrubal waffle a little bit in just the textures here. And here is another one, Javier Montero with an interesting kind of pixel artwork here. So kind of, just kind of fuzzy and interesting here. My brain is like fried from all this simulation continuing on curly head. So I've never heard of this person either. Thomas Kangan, I don't think.
00:34:08.614 - 00:34:39.173, Speaker A: Anyways, I thought just another kind of interesting animated abstract work here. So day 582 in the daily gift series. So I finally see them after 582 days. The man who scalp escaped, so has drew a waffle with an elongated head here or scalp. And again, classic trademark textures here. Really nice kind of glitch, glitchiness at the bottom here and everything. So beautiful work is always what happened here.
00:34:39.173 - 00:34:56.122, Speaker A: Went for at auction for 15 tezos to neon monk. Here's another one. Big business monkey. And so dollar signs in the background. And again, just kind of awesomely, kind of lo fi here. And beautiful. So another nice one.
00:34:56.122 - 00:35:17.174, Speaker A: Here's another one. Fake it. Lunch with celeb impersonators. Break bread together with Sir Elton, Dolly, MJ, Kenny Rogers, and Arsinio hall. So there you have it. I actually recognize all of these celebrities here and the nice hot dog there and everything. The chicken, Dolly Parton.
00:35:17.174 - 00:35:43.532, Speaker A: Hilarious. And one more. Walking the cow, a tribute to Daniel Johnston, who, I don't know who that is. Lucky stars in your eyes. And with a new texture, though, which is why I wanted to show this one. Interesting texture in the background here in the sky. So interesting mix of different applications of paint, quote unquote, and the cow here and everything.
00:35:43.532 - 00:36:12.778, Speaker A: So just interesting work from hasdrubal waffle lb away and nowhere. So again, using the analog gear here, I thought this one was kind of poetic and a nice kind of feedback at the behind delay dragging the figure here. So cool work. Buy now for 66. So maybe sold out pretty quick. Sold out within a day at six tezos each. So that is cool to some classic collectors there.
00:36:12.778 - 00:36:44.864, Speaker A: An acid boy with some beautiful work here. I love the frame, this frame thing. So, again, working with illusion, the master of psychedelic abstraction, who was quoted, that quote came in the rarible newsletter, which was hilarious because Acidboy uses that on its profile, which I think is awesome and great. And then they ended up using it in their newsletter. So that is hilarious. Here's some more. Let's see if we can get.
00:36:44.864 - 00:37:01.234, Speaker A: Let's see if we can get this working. Free fall, maybe we can't get that working. Here we go. Here's another one, Saturnin. So just a few. Acid boy works. So an interesting one.
00:37:01.234 - 00:37:22.334, Speaker A: My computer is sort of in slow motion here, but we're just gonna have to go with it sometimes. It's cool to see these works in slow motion, though, too. Let's see here. See if we can load this up one more time. Yeah, not working for us there. It's going more in regular speed here. There you go.
00:37:22.334 - 00:37:38.194, Speaker A: So that's the difference. And continuing on, life on Mars. So this is part of a series called life on Mars. And you can see, look at that. It looks like a love. These pixels here. Never seen that.
00:37:38.194 - 00:37:55.120, Speaker A: So anyways, acidboy continues to push the envelope as usual. No big surprise there. And people are buying it too. 0.8 ETH. That was back in January. And so human boy HB shoutout.
00:37:55.120 - 00:38:18.882, Speaker A: So also has some psychedelic work and kind of psychedelic fractal pixelation. And so, yeah, I thought that kind of hung well with acidboy there, creating gimp digital art. So that is available for two tezos. There are four left, and here are the other ones. So there we go. Artist and everything. So anyways, series of four here, pixel web one to four.
00:38:18.882 - 00:38:45.754, Speaker A: And so anyways, cool work by Human boy mech txt frostbite. So here is another beautiful work by mech TXT dithering and everything. Kind of a winter theme. And here we even see the sun setting. It's quite beautiful. Even the smoke that's kind of dithered out there that flows from one to the other. So anyways, this is not easy to get.
00:38:45.754 - 00:39:10.386, Speaker A: You have to put in an offer, and you also have to own the alchemist. Go to his Twitter feed if you want to find out how to get it. There are a few offers of 15 tezos. I'm not sure if they get accepted without the alchemists, though. The sun by manadal so a beautiful work here. Pixel artwork by Manitol Kattero. And here it is.
00:39:10.386 - 00:39:28.912, Speaker A: So the sun. And I'm not going to read it because we are running late. And Pamela Ceroni with a tezos noun. So a very nice take on it. So they're getting a lot of classic Tezos artists to do these tez nouns. So that is super cool. At auction for 50 tezos.
00:39:28.912 - 00:39:55.562, Speaker A: And look at uyoh 66 with a new one on manifold. So another beautiful illustration here. Kind of a. Kind of a satanist feel to it. I will hunt down and exterminate all evil creatures, hell, sins, kind of a devil sort of thing going on. Anyway, pretty interesting. Available for zero 10, minted.
00:39:55.562 - 00:40:21.324, Speaker A: So maybe you can get in at the end and be the guy to mint the guy or gal to mint it. Rosatio with a new one edition of 20. And a very nice collage here. And it is called labyrinth. And so anyways, it's reminiscent of something to me with these triangles on the back. Is that like, almost like the Dali elephant? Not sure. Anyways, pretty interesting.
00:40:21.324 - 00:40:42.406, Speaker A: Beautiful work from Rosatio dan control with a beautiful penguin here, too. Look at that. So simple, so gorgeous. I mean, it really captures the feeling of a penguin in the Arctic. And Timothy Jullien with a couple of kind of pop works. It's called Popscape. The series Lafuga.
00:40:42.406 - 00:40:56.594, Speaker A: Been a long day. And here are the. Here are these interiors. Kind of these pop interiors. Really interesting artist Timothee Jullienne. Here's the other one, talu la. So going in a slightly different direction here.
00:40:56.594 - 00:41:21.992, Speaker A: Just really cool artist. Very kind of designy artist. He's the guy that did all these other gorgeous, kind of Liechtenstein esque works here. So a bit of a pop feel to Timothy and Julien's work. This, I think, was on the front page of object. This is a beautiful work by Pippi. Universal uni vercel historia increbles, colores, impossibles.
00:41:21.992 - 00:41:40.250, Speaker A: This is beautifully painted here. Again, digital, but just the way it's kind of done. Really rough. And then the outline on top, very cool, very nice. And then great textures everywhere. Just kind of very painterly and beautiful. The color is great too.
00:41:40.250 - 00:42:00.344, Speaker A: Just the roughness of the plant. Right. The way it's colored, again, it's kind of plain. There's no easier way to be poetic with images than to kind of put some color underneath and not worry about the outlines. And then put your outlines on top after. And not worry that the color fits the outlines. That's almost the technique.
00:42:00.344 - 00:42:20.960, Speaker A: It's like you reverse it where you put the color first and then you put the outlines on top, you know? So, anyways, just really, really nice work here. Let's just see what that sold for. For only 450, Ilay picked up one. Yuri J. So, very cool work. Interesting illustration from Bjorn the artist. Sold for 1.11
00:42:20.960 - 00:42:37.458, Speaker A: ETH. So nice price. And it's a gun. Kind of reminds me of astrakarma. A gun, a Walkman and some cigarettes. So interesting combination. And who picked that up? Looks like a bit of a bidding war on that.
00:42:37.458 - 00:42:52.426, Speaker A: So that's impressive. Bjorn the artist. And here, Hercules has finally come out. We'll see if this loads up with the computer here. And remember this. And there's also a Gif that accompanies it. This GiF is slightly different.
00:42:52.426 - 00:43:23.664, Speaker A: It has the doughnuts in it and you see the coffee and just maybe that sugar. So the gif is an addition of 30. And then here, hopefully this loads up this beautiful music here. You might remember this from a month ago or three weeks ago when it was burned. Super duper cool. You see how it's different too? There's no donuts, no coffee, it's soft drinks. So interesting variation rendering.
00:43:23.664 - 00:43:38.228, Speaker A: This one's a little more animated. Has music. This is just a gift. Slightly different. Look at this beautiful line on top here too, of this purplish background. So very nice. I picked up the first and I got the second here free.
00:43:38.228 - 00:44:00.662, Speaker A: So maybe this is going to just collectors here of previous works. Graphica Png with a beautiful work here. And again, AI collage and digital painting trademark. And you got it again, I love this stuff. Say like this purple stripe here at the top and this dragging just all of it. It's beautiful. Let's just see.
00:44:00.662 - 00:44:25.700, Speaker A: Escape into GN. Really interesting work as usual from graphica Png Ilya Bliznetz as we race to the end here. Again, digital painting and AI. So going a little more complicated than usual. Different color scheme too. So interesting work from Ilya being on web3. A sort of image of this space.
00:44:25.700 - 00:44:42.644, Speaker A: So a portrait of web3. Interesting. And it sold for no sale. No sale yet. Ilay AI party. It kind of has a nice kind of Picasso feel to it in the painterliness of it. Beautiful kind of.
00:44:42.644 - 00:45:04.902, Speaker A: Again, feels like Daly textures here. Not positive on that. And a cool kind of headphones here. So a modern art party with some cool cats and some fruit. Rainy spring weekend. And this is Kinnek Zapta with a one of one for 50 tezos. Person in the garden.
00:45:04.902 - 00:45:24.164, Speaker A: Kind of has an eastern kind of buddhist sort of feel. And so anyways, cool work here. Just a nice kind of, again, eastern feel. Person in the garden. And this is Lily illo with a rare abstract work. Good morning, my dear friends. So shout out to Lily Illo.
00:45:24.164 - 00:45:42.836, Speaker A: And this really, it's like unusual abstract compared to her other works. So anyways, looking cool and well worth highlighting. And here's another AI abstract by MCHX. And we'll see if this moves. I'm not sure. Is this a mp? This is just a JPEG. So another.
00:45:42.836 - 00:46:10.240, Speaker A: That's beautiful rendering here. So anyways, beautiful color field here. Digital color field by MCHX and listed for 45 and hasn't sold yet. And it's an addition of. Oh, yeah, it did actually for three tazos. There you go. So anyways, a couple of generative works by Anika Wendell, which I thought were interesting.
00:46:10.240 - 00:46:37.722, Speaker A: I thought they just made great. Again, it's these kind of, these textures that I'd argue in the last year or two have become convincing, these kind of digital brushwork that has finally become convincing. And I assume this is digital here kind of has a. I think it's a generative series. Here's another. See here. Abstract designs combined with unique harmony of digital art, reflecting dreams, colors, and patterns.
00:46:37.722 - 00:46:54.386, Speaker A: So art by Annika Wendell. So not exactly sure what's going on here, but I think it's generative. Let's just click on this quickly. Inspired. Yeah. So not exactly sure, but kind of looks like a generative art series. And lepro chant.
00:46:54.386 - 00:47:26.844, Speaker A: We'll see if leprechaun loads up there. And I think this is a reference to Stanley Kubrick again. So there is an explanation here. So maybe a lot of you already know the reference. So, anyways, there's a lot written here as an addition of one. And it is sold for 20 tezos. So that is cool.
00:47:26.844 - 00:47:55.104, Speaker A: I think it's Stanley Kubrick, but I'm not actually sure on that. And, of course, rata with a piece. This has been released now. Cryptoi SG zero one mp4. So this has music on it, so you can't move this one. This isn't the GLB. So pretty hilarious.
00:47:55.104 - 00:48:15.644, Speaker A: So this is the movie version, the mp4 version with music. Now, this. You gotta see this for all those people that stayed till the end. This is an artist called Jack Lawler, who is very young. I don't know if you can see it. This is paint. This, my friends, is paint.
00:48:15.644 - 00:48:36.604, Speaker A: So how cool is this? My friend Ben posted this on Instagram in stories. So that is really cool. This paint version of dithering. So very cool work. That's from no gallery. And, yeah, Jack Lawler solo show. That was in New York in December.
00:48:36.604 - 00:48:54.534, Speaker A: So very cool. I brought up a couple of other works. So here's more of this kind of works here. And as you can see. As you can see. Let's zoom in here, if we can. Let's do this.
00:48:54.534 - 00:49:18.578, Speaker A: Maybe that's not working. One of those days. Okay, there we go. So there you can kind of see the texture of the brush marker to make the dithered painting. So anyways, just really beautiful work here. So that is all painted. So another cool discovery.
00:49:18.578 - 00:49:34.266, Speaker A: And look at walk with this gorgeous work here. Spray paint. Playboy car t. Just a beautiful minimal work by wok. So watch out for walk. That is your show, everyone. Thank you for joining me.
00:49:34.266 - 00:49:36.424, Speaker A: Until next time, take care.
