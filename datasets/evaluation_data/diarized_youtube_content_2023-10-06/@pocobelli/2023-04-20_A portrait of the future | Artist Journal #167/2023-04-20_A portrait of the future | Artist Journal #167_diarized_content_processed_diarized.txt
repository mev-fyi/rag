00:00:03.760 - 00:00:23.914, Speaker A: Straight to the microphone. I go with the music. Ladies and gentlemen and everyone, welcome back. Artist journal, April 20. A landmark day, 2023. Broadcasting to the world from the high seas, the imagination in Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pokkebelli, and I welcome you back.
00:00:23.914 - 00:00:51.366, Speaker A: And check out this awesome work by Karim Safa. To start us off here, what I like to call a pixel art factory. He has an awesome title for it. Creams out of the Netherlands. I just checked. And, yeah, I mean, makes these beautiful pixel art factories sort of in the same province as gogolitis. You know, you could definitely show them in the same show, and they're just awesome, these pixel artists that make these awesome.
00:00:51.366 - 00:01:15.190, Speaker A: I almost want to call them data esque machines. And here we have. The work is called factory of nothing. A poetic title. You know, you could argue a critique of sorts, artistically, in a fun way, poetically. Factory of nothing. You could argue a critique of the system, of the machine, of capitalism, of industrialization.
00:01:15.190 - 00:02:05.942, Speaker A: And so here it all is in a very fun, enjoyable way that kids can enjoy, but you can. It's kind of like the Simpsons in the sense that, like, some of the best art is, you know, hits that sweet, sweet spot where it's both avant garde and accessible at the same time. And you could argue with a title like this, you know, there could be some pretty profound ideas going on here, or just a nice, kind of very poetic concept. But again, it's the sort of thing that, you know, a five year old can love, can look at and love. So, yeah, that is the sweet spot. That's another reason I always loved Ballard, and he put a great emphasis on accessibility as well, the importance of accessibility. So that's something that pixel art really has, doesn't it? Let's take a closer look.
00:02:05.942 - 00:02:32.162, Speaker A: This is a. I don't know if it's a genesis work. It's the first work by Kareem on super rare. I feel like maybe Kareem has released other works on foundation. So I'm not sure if it's the first work on Ethereum, but I love the description here. Factory of nothing is a manually crafted digital animation that depicts an imaginary, automated manufacturing system that does not produce anything. So I love it.
00:02:32.162 - 00:02:47.474, Speaker A: 1920 by 1080. So definitely scaled up here. There are 4 hours to go. It has a bit of 1.16, so big congrats to Kareem for a great start here on super rare. And as you can see, this is the first work. So just a very cool work.
00:02:47.474 - 00:03:41.810, Speaker A: And again, you see here, factory of nothing, you see how the box turned. You got to love this. You know, like, there's a lot of nice details and creativity in here and over here on the top left corner where the boxes are falling, and even the little details here on the border here, which kind of grows out a little bit and then has all this pattern, what I almost want to call patternation, but it's probably just patterns. Anyways, super cool work here. So cream safa out of the netherlands, pixels and sounds and doing quite well to start out. Thank you, everybody who came yesterday to the rug, radio artist, Journal, Twitter, spaces, and it was a ton of fun. Runetoon and Doctor version shared their journey in New York, going to MoMA, and pretty much is largely focused on MoMA.
00:03:41.810 - 00:04:18.014, Speaker A: We also heard about the Whitney later in the broadcast, and these are all edited. So anyways, it's a great discussion if you're curious to just hear what people have to say about going to the museums these days in New York and whether it's the lineup around the corner or, you know, the. The way that the big, famous AI work in the lobby is shown, I think Rafiq Anadal, if I have the name correctly. So, anyways, just a great discussion there. Thank you, everybody, for showing up. It was a great crowd. And yeah, these are available on Spotify.
00:04:18.014 - 00:04:37.914, Speaker A: I've now added the link to the bottom of the description on the YouTube, so it's easy access. Also, the edited versions are on YouTube, which you may have seen. So thank you again. And next week we're gonna have Flora Marquez. So that should be wonderful if everything goes according to plan. But that is the plan. So much to look forward to there.
00:04:37.914 - 00:04:58.948, Speaker A: Just a quick comment from Runetune here. Thanks for the shout out. I'm glad you picked up on all the texture. And I love this concept of digital texture that we keep running into here within the composition. This was something I put together after our talk with Hasdrubal. I love how quickly you put it together. Runetune as well.
00:04:58.948 - 00:05:47.966, Speaker A: Like Hasdrubal, I was very much interested in texture in my physical artwork and didn't know how to translate that to digital until the last year. Wine service is a play with digital texture and randomness. So it's very interesting, isn't it? Because texture, we could argue, by definition, is a physical thing, right? But we keep running into these works and we see it with oxine. And whenever you kind of get what I also call, like, a painterly look, that's when it starts to feel like digital texture, right? Where. So it's just kind of interesting to keep running into this and you highlighting it here. Rune tune. I'm glad you're highlighting it because I just think it's a really interesting concept and we're going to see a couple of has dribble pieces today, so we'll see that.
00:05:47.966 - 00:06:21.784, Speaker A: If you're not familiar, we'll see that in action. Nick St. Pierre with a really interesting comment here on mid journey. Now, many of you may have seen this. This is one of those AI Twitter accounts that are all the rage, but this one I felt we should highlight here because this could be big. Mid journey's real time drawing feature has only been mentioned a couple of times during office hours, but will be a game changer when it comes out. So this is not out yet a drawing feature.
00:06:21.784 - 00:07:17.804, Speaker A: I've been using midjourney, frankly, all week, and it's kind of back to this. I'm all about the blend function. Once I finally abandoned the imagine, or at least put it to the side and opened up the user guide, and then you see the blend function, and then it's much easier to get works that I would call persuasive. Otherwise, there's a bit of an artificiality to the works when I'm just using the imagine prompt. I may not be a great prompter, though, but anyway, so it's all interesting and but as I use that and then we'll return to this. But all of a sudden, with the blend feature, you can put up to five works together off the Internet or your own work, which is a fun way to do it, and then combine them all. And then you start getting surprisingly persuasive works.
00:07:17.804 - 00:08:11.784, Speaker A: And it recalls. It recalls gogolitis when he was in the Twitter spaces in February, and I was asking him, do you use AI? He's like, I fooled around with it a little bit, but it kind of takes too long to get the renders. And I agreed and I felt the same way. But once you use blend, that's using the imagine prompt, but using the blend prompt, all of a sudden with the results you're getting, all of a sudden it feels very fast. With all of a sudden you're getting four semi persuasive works where you can start to say, I'll use part of that, I'll use part of this and everything. So that is kind of opening my mind quite a bit in terms of what's possible. And I think that people like my girlfriend, who might not make a lot of art, or even my mom, with combine, I think they can start to make persuasive works.
00:08:11.784 - 00:08:36.060, Speaker A: So that is all very interesting. So now there may be a drawing feature. Imagine sketching on your iPad or wacom tablet directly in mid journey and watching your piece come to life in real time. I think this is a portrait of the future that we're seeing here. Right now, we have text and image prompts. With this feature, your brush strokes and sketches become prompts too. And.
00:08:36.060 - 00:09:28.360, Speaker A: Right, and I'm not like, if this is what they're talking about, I'm not huge on the reverse prompting. Like, I've tried this as well, and I find the results are very unexciting, shall we say? Like, if I take a nice painting, let's say that I find on the Internet a Picasso, I put it in and I say create. I think it's describe is the prompt, and then we get the description, the words, and then you put that in as your imagine prompt. It doesn't really turn into a Picasso, unfortunately, in my experience, but there may be people who are far more experienced than I am on this. So right now, we have text and image prompts. With this feature, your brushstroke and sketches become prompts too, and combining them all together in mid journey is going to be revolutionary for many artists. And this is the portrait of the future here.
00:09:28.360 - 00:10:23.864, Speaker A: Nothing so far on how it will work, but I'd love to have the ability to prompt my canvas before I start drawing with a general theme style. I'm looking for, let's say a landscape layer control. Say you put a sky on one layer, the grass on another layer, flowers on another layer, plus automatic segmentation of layers. Kind of like Sam ability to prompt and reprompt layers. Doesn't this feel like a portrait of Photoshop? I want to say ten years from now, but maybe sooner. Individual layers and multiple at once ability to draw on top of images and version history, to name a few. So, I mean, you wonder what Photoshop with this kind of integrating mid journey type prompting, you see, I feel like we're seeing a window into Photoshop in what could be quite soon, surprisingly soon.
00:10:23.864 - 00:10:54.660, Speaker A: There's no timeline on when this will come out, but when it does, it'll be big and likely convince many more artists and illustrators to start using AI. And I totally agree. And again, I'm kind of back to blend. And once you start using blend, all of a sudden you go, oh, I can work with this tool. And all of a sudden you go, you're getting results that you can basically use as inspirational ideas. It's very similar to chat GPT with writing and giving you a draft of something. And it doesn't mean you have to keep it all like that.
00:10:54.660 - 00:11:41.014, Speaker A: It's just a really nice draft and that's kind of what these things are doing with mid journey. So anyways, continuing on and clownvamp kind of distills it very nicely. Big shout out to clownvamp. AI assisted art is a radical expansion and this is the term of creative access and will cause utter, wonderful chaos. I agree, and the world will be better for it. And again, I'm kind of back to, you know, people that might not make art now can just put up to five images and put them all together of paintings from other stuff and come out with pretty interesting stuff or work on their own thing and maybe the work on their own might be okay. And then they combine it though with other stuff and then all of a sudden, you know, you're getting somewhere.
00:11:41.014 - 00:12:09.040, Speaker A: So creative access, I just thought this was a really interesting term. Thought leadership from clownvamp as ever here. And big congrats. Speaking of AI, to Lily Illo who is now on super rare and so that is super cool. Chris Stoich, David Feinstein, Dan srl and triple zero nine helped her get there. So anyways, that's exciting. Almost overdue.
00:12:09.040 - 00:12:33.700, Speaker A: I'm glad it happened. And yeah, it almost looks like Gary Gensler here, doesn't it? Which is kind of funny. And you got to love the AI hands here. So enjoy the errors, the AI distortions, as I like to call them, while you can. Okay, don't shout out to rinifish here with a cool work. Happy 420 from rinifish. So there we go, gloomtube.
00:12:33.700 - 00:13:05.282, Speaker A: So gloomtube has a new work and you might recall the trash bag that was being painted yesterday. And I brought it up here. This work we showed on Tuesday, right, a trash bag I painted. So then this came out the next or when was it? Early this morning. And it is a trash bag also. So kind of playing off the painting and we're seeing a different version here. So anyways, just kind of interesting and fun to watch gloom tube go physical here.
00:13:05.282 - 00:13:26.934, Speaker A: And here is basically a self portrait of the artist in the studio. And it's one of gloom tube's stamps and everything. Cool texture in the background and everything here it's using paper, basically virtual paper as texture. Another cool technique. Stamp number 28 from the stamp series. So edition of 150, buy for 250. They're probably sold out.
00:13:26.934 - 00:13:59.886, Speaker A: Yeah, they all sold for Tezos 50. So that is cool. So here is the trash bag which we already looked at. And here's some other works by gloom tube in Minecraft. So doing pixelation with these very small canvases, eight and a half, sorry, eight by ten. So almost the size of an a four piece of paper, a little smaller. So an interesting way to work and interesting these almost, you know, no background here and doing a few so you can see the wood here.
00:13:59.886 - 00:14:19.646, Speaker A: It looks like it's almost all out of a few sessions here. This is from yesterday. So gloomtube is going physical. I really like the shoes here so that is fun to watch. And here are the McDonald's is. So anyways, this is all hilarious and great and some trees and everything. So just fun to watch here out of Michigan.
00:14:19.646 - 00:14:42.290, Speaker A: Shout out to gloomtube rare. We got a result here on the auction. So going for four ETH. $7,800 for rare for the young spotsman. So big congrats on that GN everyone. Forever thankful I am able to share my work and people appreciate it. That's, yeah, that's basically all it really comes down to as an artist, isn't it? So that is awesome.
00:14:42.290 - 00:14:59.802, Speaker A: So big congrats there. Die with the most likes with some new works here. Pack your wallet. Super rare account with fresh ETH. Die with the most likes is releasing artworks. Join us for a curated conversation with Dai and the SR and the super rare team at 04:00 p.m.. Thursday.
00:14:59.802 - 00:15:23.120, Speaker A: So if you're watching this, you may be able to hear it. So there's a Twitter spaces that you can join and there's also going to be merch. So anyways, here is the work and I think you have to use rare token to buy the merch. I'm not sure. So anyways, check the details there. But here are the works. So this is pretty edgy with the head removed here.
00:15:23.120 - 00:15:51.054, Speaker A: The legend has retired. So almost like a retirement day party quitting time. Yeah. So anyways, the brutal satire here continues and that's hilarious here too, the light that a lot of people use for their Zoom calls. And I think I have one of those. And also here you see the ground beef spilling out of the cake. So whatever, I'm retired and all this sort of thing.
00:15:51.054 - 00:16:29.496, Speaker A: So anyways, just more brutal satire as we enjoy and come to like from die with the most likes. And, and here's another one. At first I wasn't sure what this is, but it looks like factories, which kind of goes with our opening image there, the critique. So another critique of industrialization and maybe of pollution is going into everyone's nostrils and eyes and everything here. And almost a cigarette going backwards into someone's nose here. So interesting work from dai with the most likes. So anyways, big shout out to dai, a very nice individual, as many of us know.
00:16:29.496 - 00:17:04.208, Speaker A: Check this out. So I saw this on art news yesterday. Was on the front page, like, on the top, top story on Artnews eight. A new generation of computer plotting arrives at pace via Tyler Hobbes. So this image here is hard to see what's going on, but it's using a plotter. Okay, so I made it bigger. And this gets pretty interesting because all of a sudden you see, oh, these are concentric circles and everything, and you see how beautiful this plotter work can be.
00:17:04.208 - 00:17:49.348, Speaker A: I mean, it almost reminds me of Hilda and Clint. These kind of like, especially in here. I mean, it's kind of like a generative version, you might say, or generative feeling. I mean, it's completely different. But when you look at the colors and even just the light white on the kind of cream canvas, or it's almost like the raw canvas here, you wonder if there's any underpainting. Anyway, the plotters are looking just wonderful what they're doing. It makes me want to run over and find out how I can find a plotter, because this stuff is awesome, you know? And again, the alchemical transformation from digital to physical, because I think this is a interesting, beautiful.
00:17:49.348 - 00:18:27.716, Speaker A: As a digital work, I would think we don't have the digital in front of us, but as a physical work, it's kind of mystifying. It creates a sense of awe and mystery. Like, I think it's. It feels like it would probably be and pure speculation, but it would be probably, probably be much more powerful as a physical work. Again, it's sort of like when you see, you know, pixel art done physically done well, is very powerful, whether it's screen printing or maybe a plotter. Right? Because you have that randomness, you know, we're back to almost texture here. Strano also kind of in the same, also using a plotter.
00:18:27.716 - 00:19:01.466, Speaker A: So drawing as an eternal f machine, Maxwell length times strannel. So here, I believe, is the work. So a gif. And what's so fascinating about it is you see the process here, a collaboration between an experienced hand and a servant machine blended into a perpetual motion leading to nowhere edition of 20. So you see the artist working here, manually working. And I think we have an explanation here. It all started last year when Tim sent me some sketches.
00:19:01.466 - 00:19:49.490, Speaker A: Dozens of them was a pain and a joy to pick the right ones for this, I then redrew everything in vectors, trying to find the perfect density of lines for the machine. So there it's transformed the sketch into a vector. And here we go, another plotter off to the axi draw plotter. The axi draw plotter did about 15 tests before getting the right one that I shipped to new York City for Tim to draw the missing vertical lines. So a real. So going from think physical, the sketch, to digital, turning it into a vector, and then going back to physical with the plotter. And then I think Tim drew some missing vertical lines, and I think that's what you see here.
00:19:49.490 - 00:20:40.806, Speaker A: So it's not just one. It's not a one. And done. This is going back and forth. So super interesting. And again, we've mentioned this many times, like, I think this is kind of, you know, art and technology go hand in hand, and they kind of always have, you know, and it seems like, since, like the late Warhol, I would argue where we see, and I've mentioned that many times, where he's using several, going, traveling through the mediums, basically, to me, seems to be where the big picture, contemporary art conversation kind of is from a process perspective, is playing with this interchange and interplay between the physical and the digital. Or even, I'd even be tempted to say more broadly between different mediums.
00:20:40.806 - 00:21:33.058, Speaker A: I mean, that's where Warhol was going. And maybe now it's more about the digital being incorporated into that conversation that Warhol was having, which Richard Prince also shares with his inkjet nurses that he paints over top with his, you know, liquid acrylics and heavy, you know, heavy gel gesso and all that, or heavy gel medium, you know, liquitex. Okay, I suspect so. Anyways, so putting the physical. So drawing over top of these, then, I think, is what's going on here. And then put into after effects, I masked off my lines, inside after effect, I masked off my line to only keep Tims, which are used as texture, as a trigger for the wiggling line effect. Couple of layers of compositing and animation was ready.
00:21:33.058 - 00:22:00.504, Speaker A: Final GIF was exported using Photoshop to optimize to 15 megabytes. Now, there it is. Okay, so, pretty interesting, isn't it? No simple image. No simple image at all. So anyways, very cool, and everybody is loving it. So here it is on object drawing as an eternal f machine. Digital and analog play the surrealist game of exquisite corpse.
00:22:00.504 - 00:22:33.136, Speaker A: So interesting. Now, of course, exquisite corpse is where the game that the surrealist created, for those that don't know where I might draw the head. You're drawing the torso, and then we just have to make sure the lines meet up of my drawing and your drawing. Maybe we set that out ahead of time. And then you draw the torso, and then someone else draws the leg. So we put it all together as the exquisite corpse. And it seems here that Strano and Maxwell linked are basically saying this kind of interplay is a kind of exquisite corpse of sorts.
00:22:33.136 - 00:22:53.882, Speaker A: Interesting analogy. From hand to pen, plotter drawing shipped to blend back by hand scanned and animated. Total riff. So very, very cool. Now, 396 tezos. So the market, kind of a tribute to this market here is. The market is recognizing the value here of what's taking place.
00:22:53.882 - 00:23:27.284, Speaker A: So, you know, that is cool. You know, and maybe not a shock to anybody. Look, a sale for 222 tezos. So not just a. Not just a listing that's high, but, you know, selling for very nice amounts. So all to say, what do we, you know, to me, the takeaway here is, let no one say this is an unsophisticated scene or unsophisticated market, because there is still a perception out there that NFTs are monkey JPeGs and this sort of thing. And with some.
00:23:27.284 - 00:24:11.486, Speaker A: And, like, I was at a dinner thing, like, maybe two or three months ago, it was actually before Christmas, and there was someone who's totally interested and open minded, but just saying, like, but what about, you know, NFTs? Like, aren't they, isn't the artist terrible? But they just don't know. I mean, that's kind of why this show, part of the many reasons that this show exists. It's kind of highlighting all these things because this is so easy to just kind of go right past you, you know, if you're not reading every little thing on Twitter. Okay, speeding along here, doctor version with an awesome. In case you were wondering what the glitch art glitch beyond binary show looks like, I mean, here it is. Congrats to curator Dena Chang, and let's glitch it and all the artists. Very nice work.
00:24:11.486 - 00:24:30.184, Speaker A: This is how should have been done the first time around. Tooks Ukscene Sabato in Avare and Sky Goodman. So doctor version puts together an awesome video here. Glitch beyond binary. So here it is. Sothebys right from the door. You cant ask for anything more, really.
00:24:30.184 - 00:24:55.704, Speaker A: And here theres tuks, there is uxine. Its an interesting, you know, you see theres Sabato. I mean, you see the struggle to display all this stuff, even for Sothebys in Avare, there's Sky Goodman. You wonder if it's cropped right. So even Sotheby's is struggling to display digital art. And there were some comments on that. Let's actually check on that.
00:24:55.704 - 00:25:28.240, Speaker A: I think this is that same. I'm not sure if it's the same show, but soon, sotheby's from Xerox and yeah, so there's. So I don't know if this is the same show or a different show, but anyways, so as you can see here, and yeah, here, the work is sideways. Anyway, so that is happening. Skye Goodman. So today is the auction, actually, finally on the glitch beyond binary. Today is the day auction for the recurrated Sotheby's verse show.
00:25:28.240 - 00:25:54.450, Speaker A: Glitch beyond Binary goes live at two eastern time today, and that was done yesterday. Super proud to be amongst the many all stars. So many epic works in the collaboration in the collection. And here is Skye Goodman's piece here. Again, so very cool. And also, so another interesting display here, this time from Lorna Mills or of Lorna Mills work here. So this is known origin.
00:25:54.450 - 00:26:27.422, Speaker A: The team at known origin is also attending the super rare event at NFT New York City at the Oculus center featuring Brend and Oz. Amazing. And so here you see, I'm gonna mute the music here. Here you see the party looks like a good time, but this is what I wanted to highlight. You see the Lorna Mills piece there behind the dj? That's a pretty interesting display, isn't it? So that's cool. People are getting creative with the displays. And we saw other works at NFT in New York City also displayed like that.
00:26:27.422 - 00:26:54.960, Speaker A: And while we're on Lorna Mills here, she put out a beautiful work here on Twitter. I couldn't find it on minted anywhere, but just a really nice work with big, chunky masks that apparently someone asked her how she does it. She does it all manually with the marquee tool, which is the selection, the square kind of selection tool in Photoshop. She does it all manually. So that is pretty interesting. And a really, really nice work. I love her landscapes.
00:26:54.960 - 00:27:24.482, Speaker A: I'm a big fan. And here, so this is the, I think it's called the async exhibit. Here are some of oxygen's works that were minted. This was done by Mondog. So just another beautiful work by Euxine here. Here you see kind of playing with these distortions and a lot of the ascii text. So again, taking it to that next level, because I think a lot of artists will go to the ascii level.
00:27:24.482 - 00:27:57.816, Speaker A: But what's great about what Oxine is doing is he takes it at least one step further. Further. But when you do, because if we see ASCII just plain, well, we've seen that a lot. And, okay, how hard is that? And this sort of thing. But when you see it taken one step further, all of a sudden you can take any image and then you can, you know, give the process. So it's all about kind of pushing it that next step sometimes. And I think that's what we see with uxine, because now oxygen can remix his work endlessly and come up with beautiful stuff.
00:27:57.816 - 00:28:22.520, Speaker A: So it's all about kind of pushing it that one step further. And here you see over here, these distorted ascii text things. And anyways, with trademark colors. Here's another one using almost like a glitch tool here, these kind of scan lines here, stretching, you know? So anyways, just beautiful textures here. Beautiful. Again, we're back to digital texture. I mean, it looks painterly.
00:28:22.520 - 00:28:41.174, Speaker A: This looks like a silkscreen. And how magical is that? Because I don't think it's a silkscreen. It's a digital work. This is someone else. Uncle Pennybags just minted a forever supper by async art and picked up the Euxine pack, an artist I've been meaning to collect for a while. My favorite part about it is the money. NFTs can exist wholly outside of forever supper.
00:28:41.174 - 00:28:59.446, Speaker A: Two congrats to the team. So anyways, here's some more. And here is some more. And I think we might have missed. Let's just look at the other. Look at this. So forever experimenting, as one of these commenters pointed out here from Axeen.
00:28:59.446 - 00:29:17.914, Speaker A: And, you know, and this is the thing, I mean, and just applies, he makes it so simple. It's like, okay, let's just put some digital noise. You need me to make a version of this? No problem. Just done. Okay, here's. Okay, we'll do some more. I mean, a really great artist makes it look so easy.
00:29:17.914 - 00:29:44.694, Speaker A: And here also, so these minted for only 0.09 ETH, I'm not sure, on addition numbers and everything. And here is actually the page. So anyways, just really cool. And so a lot more minted out 48 packs remaining. So I'm not sure if you can still mint out some of these. Interestingly, and a couple of more just while we're on axing here, a couple of more.
00:29:44.694 - 00:30:14.404, Speaker A: Just like putting in different treatments of basically a book on fire. It basically looks like a book, right? With a couple of colors here, maybe even drawn out. And then a fire in a few different, maybe four or five different variations with some ascii text. And then you just make one of the things, you just show all the different layers and everything. So anyways, just more beautiful work. It's working like magic here. And here's just more digital texture using a different technique.
00:30:14.404 - 00:30:31.496, Speaker A: Right? So oxygen is in the zone. And this beautiful matte black. And look at that, you know, trademark there. So beautiful. Also from async. So Uncle Pennybags minted some other stuff. I just minted tension by neurocolor for async art final supper.
00:30:31.496 - 00:30:59.942, Speaker A: And I think this piece is massively underappreciated. An amazing example of digital abstract art with unmistakable neuroimagery. It's at most an edition of 26. As of now, the only other collector is Basilius. So there may be opportunity, you know, for the collectors out there that watch this show. There may be opportunity on this whole series here, this forever supper series. Kim Eisendorf.
00:30:59.942 - 00:31:20.496, Speaker A: I just came across this on Twitter. I think Lorna Mills may have retweeted this, and I thought it was just a nice looking work here. Interesting, original. I think it said Kim Eisendorf. So just kind of an interesting digitally noisy gif. I mean, very art, you know, this is an art GIF for sure. Zero.
00:31:20.496 - 00:31:31.524, Speaker A: Lexa. Honestly, the series is some of the best art I've seen in a while. Where can I buy. Oh, here it is. Yeah, so I went to this page. I actually couldn't find it right away, but I'm sure it's there. So anyways, Kim Acendorf is the account.
00:31:31.524 - 00:31:48.698, Speaker A: And event Horizon seems to be the title. Check this out. Some more financial themed work from Spuegels Maskinen. And this looks like a printing press. Awesomely done. Awesomely, awesomely done. And this is on foundation.
00:31:48.698 - 00:32:13.618, Speaker A: And we see some dollar bills coming out. So the master at work here, what is this selling? And great title, Fountain. Fountain. You know, simultaneously alluding to Duchamp, but also alluding to the money kind of split, splurging out fountain. Great title. ATM, banknotes, printing press. 320 by 20 by 240 pixels.
00:32:13.618 - 00:32:25.362, Speaker A: So quite a small original work here. Sold for three ETH. Maybe this is an old work. Oh, no. April 20. So this all just got, I guess it was minted on April 4. I didn't even see that.
00:32:25.362 - 00:32:53.510, Speaker A: But once it got moving. So this is interesting, isn't it? Just from a pure market perspective. So, listed for one ETH, buy now. Price set for two. Reserve changed to 0.75. So, lowering the reserve, it goes for three. So isn't that interesting? So kind of a lesson for all of us to lower our reserves, isn't it? I mean, I don't know what the other takeaway from that could be.
00:32:53.510 - 00:33:14.004, Speaker A: I mean, as long as you have people attention, and if it only goes for 0.15 or whatever the first bid is, that's okay, then. He's still getting 0.75 for his work, and he's surviving. Kurt Hussle collective. And this was transferred to Haiti. Rockette.
00:33:14.004 - 00:33:39.984, Speaker A: And this belongings, number one of ten. So, remember, we saw the screensaver last show. So I think these are taken. Those are stills, I think, from this work, if I'm not mistaken. Big shout out to Kurt Hussle collective, who sent me a message, kind of helping me understand what's going on. And we're just friendly, really cool artists. Here's some more computers.
00:33:39.984 - 00:34:10.616, Speaker A: And is this a screensaver, too? It's classic retro tech, and it's got that nice kind of bitmap ization, a little bit of dithering. I guess we could call that screensaver suite zero zero one. So another screensaver, kind of retro. Nineties look to it looks like a Pentium personal computer here, available for 15. Did this sell out? I think it did for two tezos each, and others here. Intermission. I think this is also a screensaver.
00:34:10.616 - 00:34:38.350, Speaker A: So more work by Kurt Hussle. That looks like a fax machine on top with some skeletons in there. And here is a video. Let's just put that up there. Have you been experiencing any extraterrestrial activity within your brain recently? If your answer is yes, then we may have contacted you for a reason. Bit of a weird one. Find out more.
00:34:38.350 - 00:35:11.382, Speaker A: Call now. It's always weird. 1997, 900, brought to 50 you and by KHC. I wouldn't be surprised if they know who this guy is, you know? Like, that's how elaborate they can be. So, pretty cool. It's all powered by Kurt Hussle collective enterprises, so it looks like the organization is growing by now for 25 tezos, and there are ten left, so very impressive video. And I was looking.
00:35:11.382 - 00:35:32.834, Speaker A: They tweeted out something on Instagram. Actually, they posted something on Instagram with this address in it. So I went Napsco dot world, and they have a whole website here, syncy neural net. And there it is. So about an, you know, neural. So it's pretty hilarious. I mean, I want to contact these guys, I wonder if that works.
00:35:32.834 - 00:35:50.254, Speaker A: Maybe I'll find out here. And so anyway, sync now. And there's that video. So very hilarious and cool as ever. Very nineties website there. LB with some new work. How are we doing for time? Gotta run through the rest of this here.
00:35:50.254 - 00:36:01.598, Speaker A: The same dream. Another beautiful title here. So cool. Kind of glitchy video from LB. The same dream. So very cool. Available for Fortazos.
00:36:01.598 - 00:36:12.478, Speaker A: And many left, 14 left. So you can still get that. And ex mortal with a one of. One more noise studies. This one's beautiful. That went to eight. So.
00:36:12.478 - 00:36:30.114, Speaker A: So also to it. You gotta love it when fellow artists are buying your work. Let's see if we can get this working. Will this work? Exmortal noise study. Here we go. So this is a gif, not a video, interestingly. And look at how great this looks.
00:36:30.114 - 00:36:41.854, Speaker A: Like a really, really nice. Again for 15 tezos. Nice and slow. There's something to be said for that. Now that might be my computer. Here's the faster. This is actually what it's like.
00:36:41.854 - 00:36:55.046, Speaker A: The slow was actually quite interesting though, wasn't it? You could even adjust the speeds, theoretically. Anyways, it looks great. So another noise study. Here's another one. Buy for 69. Is that on secondary? Yeah, from Eitso. So eight.
00:36:55.046 - 00:37:18.956, Speaker A: So bought both for 15. This is beautiful too. And of course, Eizo makes beautiful video art as well, that modern furniture series. So again, it's always a huge compliment when a fellow artist kind of doing similar things, appreciates what you're doing. This is DJ Kuro. So let's see if this one loads up properly. Kind of a glitched out.
00:37:18.956 - 00:37:36.478, Speaker A: A very short here. Let me restart this and play. Almost looks like an anime thing. Like a sailor moon type thing in the background. Kind of glitched out and everything. So very cool. Edition of ten for two tezos and nine still available, so you can pick that up.
00:37:36.478 - 00:37:53.154, Speaker A: One has sold, so brand new here, actually April 11. So may not have got the exposure. So this is by DJ Quiro. So very cool. Nice work here. Has dribble waffle. This screams devo to me.
00:37:53.154 - 00:38:12.246, Speaker A: So another, you know, reference that I think we both, and I could be wrong, but uglato you a bad tomato. This screams there it is. Devolution. There it is. I think we're right again on that one. Hasdrubal waffle. And I never would have guessed Devo from the work here.
00:38:12.246 - 00:38:47.844, Speaker A: But anyways, really cool references from Hasdrubal waffle. And here's the texture that we're talking about, you know, these different kinds of brushstrokes. Again, for those that don't know, hisdrubal waffle uses often these, like, JavaScript programs in tabs on his browser, as he said. And I highly recommend, if you like hasdrubal waffles work and Mario paint and other kid picks was highly recommended. I'll have to check that out. I highly recommend the spaces we did. And again, that's on Spotify and YouTube with hasdrubal waffle.
00:38:47.844 - 00:39:02.304, Speaker A: Let's just see what happened here. There's an auction went for $28.29 for an edition of three. That is great. And so Hasdrubal holds onto a couple. And here's another one with some music. And little cakes was bringing that up in the spaces that we had.
00:39:02.304 - 00:39:21.908, Speaker A: Comsec. Hello, operator. Let's see if we can get some kind of experimental music by now. For 40, let's just see Bridget. New York City, who's also a huge fan. Shout out to Bridget Ilay has a couple. Little Cakes has one.
00:39:21.908 - 00:39:41.398, Speaker A: Uri J. Santiago. All familiar faces here, NZFS. It's a really nice piece here. It really transforms the work, the music. It makes it very museum esque. I mean, some of you might know kindle out here.
00:39:41.398 - 00:40:10.948, Speaker A: It's like a contemporary art kind of space that's pretty well known in Berlin. Here in Neukoln. This would go beautifully in that space with the music, you know, the music. This, the work would go. It would work the first time, but with the music, it would be completely persuasive, I think people would love. It seems to be a self portrait of sorts with smaller and smaller hasdrubal waffles. So again, more doodling and probably all sorts of Easter eggs, as he calls it, hidden within the work.
00:40:10.948 - 00:40:58.484, Speaker A: Here's one from NZFS, who I'm starting to think is Santiago again. So the mystery with the identities continue here, because this screams Santiago. And you know what's interesting about this work? It looks like a Santiago work that is photographed, a photograph of the work on the screen. And it kind of looks also like a computer game. I mean, like it almost reminds me of Ultima four, a subject I've depicted many times, although it may be something different because the castles here might be a little bit more elaborate, but one of those video games where you're kind of looking down at kind of a 45 degree angle. So a very fun subject matter here. And it looks like the photograph of a screen, again, traveling through the mediums here.
00:40:58.484 - 00:41:16.692, Speaker A: And, you know, these little textures underneath. So very interesting. The cultural Revolution, five interesting title. One tezos edition of 20 517 left. Very cool piece. This is Santiago, the account we know as Santiago. Set of symptoms knitted out of time.
00:41:16.692 - 00:41:42.560, Speaker A: This is my tribute to Sean Luke's work. So that is cool. Maybe a remix of sorts would hang well with that hasdrubal waffle. And you see, again, it reminds me again of Ed Marolla with the pixelate, not worrying about the crisp pixels. So it continues to be super interesting with all these artists over here, isn't it? So many directions. I find it so inspiring. I mean, after looking at all this stuff, I want to try ten different things.
00:41:42.560 - 00:41:56.274, Speaker A: You know, there I'm with mid journey, but then I want the plotter, and then you want to. Oh, so anyways, then I want to try kidpix. I mean, that's. You know, there's so much going on in this scene. It's so exciting. Color. Color.
00:41:56.274 - 00:42:15.598, Speaker A: I'm not sure if we've ever looked at the work. I think I saw this on Twitter. Just a cool, abstract work. It kind of looks like the same software that Hasdrubal might be using. In the background, you see this large pixelation and just the noise. I could be totally wrong about that, but kind of looks a little bit like Hasdrubal's backgrounds. A little bit.
00:42:15.598 - 00:42:29.934, Speaker A: I could be totally wrong on that. So color. Color. And let's just take a quick look here. The first work have I decoded. Like, is this a Hasdrubal account making art on the Internet. Pixel cowboy follow so new account.
00:42:29.934 - 00:42:49.156, Speaker A: And this also has a bit of a hasdrubal influence, one would think. This is Lego Joe. So big shout out to Legojo seven. Two B, two t. And this is using dpaint. And it seems to be a screenshot of dpaint. So with some cool pixelation, kind of moving in the background.
00:42:49.156 - 00:43:09.100, Speaker A: So anyways, great to see Legojo making some work here. And a screenshot. So that is kind of cool here too. And there's Legojo seven signing it. And there, of course, is the early kind of photoshop type tools. I mean, I assume dpaint came out before Photoshop impostor with a work called impulse tries. We might.
00:43:09.100 - 00:43:27.196, Speaker A: We all go in the end with these figures being kind of vacuumed up by whatever this is inertia. So kind of a metaphysical work here. A little bit. So interesting work. 150 tezos. That's probably on secondary from a thousand lands. Let's just see what happened here.
00:43:27.196 - 00:44:03.404, Speaker A: Accepted offers of 34. So it went for a pretty penny here at 30 each for an addition of 20. So nice work from impostor there stars wormhole from Zoxo. So more of these kind of Mario stars working with these. And just really interesting work here, isn't it? Again, feels like a digital. It feels like a contemporary art gallery and using like, what seems to me to be like Super Mario references. So just really interesting and cool, isn't it? So, open edition, only seven minted tezos, 30.
00:44:03.404 - 00:44:23.500, Speaker A: Another kind of interesting work. Kind of reminiscent to karim safa and to golitis, but different. And here we go. This is Dom and some pixel art. And it's kind of like a really rough version. And there's the Twitter and the discord. And I'm not sure, maybe this is web3.
00:44:23.500 - 00:44:45.058, Speaker A: So kind of a really rough treatment with what seems to be a gradient in the background here, too. I could be wrong. Maybe that's my screen, I can't tell. It seems slightly darker on my screen here, but I'm not sure. That could just be my screen here. Mech txt. Slowly getting my pace and refining my stamina.
00:44:45.058 - 00:45:06.526, Speaker A: So, big shout out to mecht TXt. Tweaking foundation. Drop mechanics for small card gasha. So anyways, just kind of cool pixel artwork, as usual from Mech TXT. Doing very well there, RJ. With more concept art, we're starting to see regular, what I consider concept art. Let's see.
00:45:06.526 - 00:45:39.374, Speaker A: Is this concept art office culture? Have you cleared your inbox lately? So this is a one of one for only 50 tezos from RJ, a man once fell from an eight story window. And so a bit of a text, new messages, seems to be stretching. You know, like here, it's kind of like a, what I want to call a semi cubist kind of composition here. Interesting experimentation from RJ, isn't it? At auction, for one. Office culture. Another cool title. Check this work out.
00:45:39.374 - 00:46:03.224, Speaker A: Let's see if we can get it working. So I feel like we know who this artist is. Score. Of course it's score. So, interesting combination of this very kind of digital, hard edged, what I call digitalia. Just pixelation and whatnot. Just hard edged moves with a soft kind of drawing.
00:46:03.224 - 00:46:16.296, Speaker A: And you see it here. I mean, so just super interesting work as ever from score. Let's see what happened on the market here. Current bid. .3 so the market likes it. And so, .3
00:46:16.296 - 00:46:25.952, Speaker A: I mean, Ethereum is almost at $2,000. It's $1900. So 0.3, even 0.1 is not bad. These days. Right? That's something else we have to keep in mind as artists.
00:46:25.952 - 00:46:46.416, Speaker A: Like the price of ETH does affect. So 0.3. You're talking like five, $600. Not bad. Not bad at all. And just a cool animation here. Kind of illustrated animation from Mirai Mizue, who I don't think I've seen before.
00:46:46.416 - 00:47:08.524, Speaker A: Now I want to make an exciting music video. It's a cool. Just kind of almost, I guess it almost looks like kind of japanese illustration style here. Almost like those fish that you often see that. I can't remember what they're called. Anyway, cool work from Mirai Mizue. Do we have any more information? Let's just see.
00:47:08.524 - 00:47:19.544, Speaker A: Yeah, it looks like Japan. Yahoo. Co. Japan. Very cool. Cool artist. So anyways, continuing on, another artist I've never seen before found on Twitter, Mimu.
00:47:19.544 - 00:47:58.440, Speaker A: Sorry, I can't see you through these tears. What I thought was so interesting and kind of bold about this was the semi hard edged illustration here. It almost looks like a photo of a screen again, like slightly out of, you know, kilter though. Like you can see the blue edged. It's almost like slightly glitched out, I'm tempted to say. And then the tiers are done so softly. So you get this contrast between kind of the hard edged illustration and the tiers, which are kind of done with a lot of gradients, the illustration versus kind of like, it's a different treatment, creating an interesting contrast, but also looking like an old tv or something.
00:47:58.440 - 00:48:09.536, Speaker A: Old screen. So really interesting work. Edition of five for only five tezos. Two left. So another one for the collectors there. Good cat in the pool. Horomox.
00:48:09.536 - 00:48:35.244, Speaker A: So is Horomox is the artist another? Just edgy work here. Look at this experimentation. I mean, it's so vibrant. What is happening here? So here's a cat walking with all sorts of different brush marks and almost like this printing pattern and everything. Super interesting. Stretched out background there. Anyway, addition of five and burned.
00:48:35.244 - 00:48:48.144, Speaker A: So zero left. Now it looks like some people got some. Let's just look at the owners here. So yes, there are five left. So interesting. When did this come out? July 13, 2021. So this is an old one.
00:48:48.144 - 00:49:07.468, Speaker A: This is an old one. So anyway, I just saw that on Twitter. Some of these might be old like. Here's one I also found on Twitter. Had my eye on this piece for a while. Glad to give it a new home. Collected on secondary your love by Ilio Gible, an abstract artist on super rare and quite a few followers.
00:49:07.468 - 00:49:33.280, Speaker A: So I think maybe we've seen this artist before, but anyways, you know, would hang really well with Antonio. Loves big shout out to Antonio. This work would hang beautifully in the same room. So just kind of what I am always tempted to call like surrealist illustration here. Tito with another one. Tea toys 90 lost in purple. This is from yesterday and a beautiful sun here.
00:49:33.280 - 00:49:53.524, Speaker A: And kind of a surreal work as well. It was someone walking down a staircase. That is a skull and maybe some pearls on a woman's neck here. So anyways, lots going on in a landscape, so kind of reminds me of the other one. Just kind of wild illustration here, edition of eight. Let's just see what's happening. Just minted.
00:49:53.524 - 00:50:19.776, Speaker A: So not for not listed yet. Interestingly. And Flora Marquez again, who will be on Twitter spaces next week, hopefully if everything goes according to plan. April 17 so this was a great one. When I see the clouds move, reality becomes psychedelic. So I'm not sure if this is still available, but playing with flowers and some leaves here, this actually moved. Yeah, this sold when I first loaded it up.
00:50:19.776 - 00:50:44.318, Speaker A: It was available so it took a couple of days, but these do all sell. And here was an interesting post. So we've been following Flora's journey here since January when she started posting every day. And so here, this is inevitable. Today is one of those days when the daily drawing doesn't come so easy. I'm tired, I just got home and I still don't know what I'm going to do. Send me strength to finish it before midnight.
00:50:44.318 - 00:51:02.392, Speaker A: Going down the rabbit hole. So there it is. So great work, Flora. And continues on. So delivers. Sometimes it's just all about delivering, you know, it's about showing up, as they say. So anyways, very cool new one from rustic digital art.
00:51:02.392 - 00:51:23.856, Speaker A: And this is available for five tezos. Still nine left, so slow to go. Almost looks like a Joni Mitchell type character. Press start and a Mario box on top. There's a duck hunt reference and maybe some hearts, maybe another video game. And the reverse sky. The clouds are sky and the rest is white, so.
00:51:23.856 - 00:51:41.046, Speaker A: But you could imagine actually a sky like this. Very cool. From rustic digital art, edition of ten. Interesting work from Bolin. So just an interesting collage painting work from Bolin. This is a one of one. And this sold for only nine tezos.
00:51:41.046 - 00:52:19.784, Speaker A: So pretty nice work here. Looks like a bit of AI is involved there too, doesn't it? Zio Siwa here is a new AI artist, or at least new for me that is out. And I have a few of their works here. And so yeah, so you're going to see the similarities between the works and what is going on. So some really nice textures, similar compositions. Okay, so it's almost like you're getting different outputs of a similar input, shall we say? Because you see across here, and here's their account, Zio siwa. And yeah, you see there's kind of a similar composition.
00:52:19.784 - 00:52:46.184, Speaker A: So plane with maybe similar inputs and different combinations, perhaps. I'm guessing blending, I'm not sure. Anyways, so really cool, good looking work here with just numbers on it. And so anyways, very painterly, nice textures. Has a bit of a Del e feel to it, but I'm not sure about that. And continuing. And just a few more.
00:52:46.184 - 00:53:04.924, Speaker A: So there you have it. So really interesting work. And again, we're kind of back to this different. A different take on texture. Taking the emulation of physical brushwork done by AI. And I'm pretty sure this is all AI. I'm pretty sure this is AI.
00:53:04.924 - 00:53:25.450, Speaker A: It's not explicit here, but I think it might be on the account. Let's actually very quickly look playing with AI and digital painting. So, yes, in fact, it is AI. So very cool here. And Lily illo, so with a couple of. One of ones, wallflower. So, you know, trademark.
00:53:25.450 - 00:53:45.966, Speaker A: Loving the hands here. And the beautiful painterliness of the background. Beautifully done. And maybe it's a portrait of sorts, because again, this is the thing, like I have. I'm just starting to experiment here. But you can start taking pictures of people, you know, I guess that's how people made, you know, like my profile picture, edge cue. Maybe that's using the blender, I don't know.
00:53:45.966 - 00:54:07.834, Speaker A: So anyways, very interesting, beautiful work here from Lily illo. You gotta love the hands here. More AI distortions in the hands. Another one sewing through the night. So very nice work here. Now, this is a thing that I'm still figuring out, which is how to upscale. Because the outputs you get, at least on mid journey, are quite small.
00:54:07.834 - 00:54:28.998, Speaker A: So that's a whole other thing, I think there's topaz, AI. Maybe that's the one that you use for making it quite large. Because those are huge files for AI. Mister shapeless with a couple on object. So kind of some portraits that Mister shapeless seems to be kind of almost testing out on object a little bit here. Very cool. This went for 50 tezos.
00:54:28.998 - 00:54:43.524, Speaker A: How long did it take? 13 minutes. Gotta love that. And these are probably just like AI outputs. Face of the future, number three. Another one available for 50 tezos. This was just released. So very cool.
00:54:43.524 - 00:55:05.728, Speaker A: And Ilay with a nice work. Harlequin dream, pink sleeves. So a very painterly work. I suspect that Ilay is using dal e because usually dal e has these very textured brushstrokes, from my experience here. So we are starting to learn along the way, hopefully. I don't know if I'm totally right on that. Venta times AI.
00:55:05.728 - 00:55:21.158, Speaker A: So helicon halikin fields. That reminds me of that great orbital track. If you don't know that one, that's a nineties classic. I think that's what it's called. Helicon. On and on, maybe, yeah. Anyway, bring us back to our youth here.
00:55:21.158 - 00:55:43.778, Speaker A: Anyways, some beautiful AI work from Venta. Again. Kind of has this autumn cannibals. Autumn cannibalisms by Dali feel to it, which I mention very often with Venta's work here. Has a real kind of autumn cannibalism feel to it. So very cool. And here's some physical work.
00:55:43.778 - 00:56:12.190, Speaker A: Nicola Petek posting Dennis Scholl. So I'm not sure if we've looked at Dennis Scholl before, but I thought this was a pretty cool work here, reminiscent of those other works we were looking at just the other day. So interesting. And this is, I believe, Ollie. No, Ed Morolla working physically here, I believe. And so just that is looking very nice. And Ollie is Akoski with a very nice physical work.
00:56:12.190 - 00:56:22.662, Speaker A: Good morning, all. Made porridge again. I also make art. Here's my latest. Have a great day. So give Ollie a follow because Ollie is positive and having fun. I think this is physical.
00:56:22.662 - 00:56:44.612, Speaker A: It kind of looks like paper, but I'm actually not positive on that. So, anyways, maybe it's a combination. Maybe it's a photo of physical process digitally. Anyway, looking great. This little triptych here by Oli Azikovsky. And of course, this is super interesting, too, as we continue this whole show. So much of it had to do with physical and digital kind of colliding.
00:56:44.612 - 00:57:10.764, Speaker A: Right? And here's Wok shrek spray on paper, masterfully done as ever. Reserve price 0.5 ETH, physical included. I could also see this becoming a bit of a thing. So just the spray paint master walk here in action again. I've ended so many shows with Wok because they're so well done. Anyways, thanks, everybody, for coming out.
00:57:10.764 - 00:57:11.644, Speaker A: Until next time, take care.
