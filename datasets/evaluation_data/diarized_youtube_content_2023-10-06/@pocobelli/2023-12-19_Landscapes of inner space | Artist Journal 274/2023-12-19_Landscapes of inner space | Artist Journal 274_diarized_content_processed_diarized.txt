00:00:02.920 - 00:00:32.170, Speaker A: We are back and we are sailing furiously here as the sun is setting. I have extra lights here on the pirate ship. We have a studio, studio lighting on the pirate ship as we continue to move forward here. Little jet lag as the pirate ship in the sky landed in Berlin on Saturday. Anyway, artist journal, December 19, 2023. Broadcasting from inside, from the inner half of the nervous system here in Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pokebelli.
00:00:32.170 - 00:01:03.910, Speaker A: And check this out. The man, the legend, the myth, the person, the man behind the myth, you know. Finally, big shout out and props to people of Tezos. I'm not sure if we've ever actually seen the self portrait of the myth. I put it this way. We've seen a few figures in myth's work, but often they are masked with either the Lemonhead mask or like a wrestler mask or different kinds of masks. This looks like the artist.
00:01:03.910 - 00:01:22.534, Speaker A: If I had to wager, I would suspect this is an artist. It looks like dun and procreate. And again, I'm just not. It's probably in there. It's probably in there like myth's work seems. I find it very dally esque. Actually, speaking of inner space, I find it very dahliasque.
00:01:22.534 - 00:02:10.578, Speaker A: It's kind of the myth's private mythology, you know, is sort of what seems to be the. What it's about, you know, again, Ballard's comment being true to your own obsessions, be true to your own obsessions, rings true. When I look at the work of the myth, it seems to be very much this kind of personal, extended though mythology where. And the artist, again, that I look to who's done that? That's very dally, Salvador Dali. So kind of an interesting conceptual similarity there. Now, I don't know if I would. I was going to say I don't know if I'd consider myth as psychoanalytical, but there is a psychoanalytic side to it, although I think Dali was very much.
00:02:10.578 - 00:02:55.156, Speaker A: I mean, there is eroticism in the myth, as many of you know, who have looked at myth's work. So it's just a really interesting, surprising, almost to me, comparison. But I think it's fair, again, these landscapes of inner space. And so again, this seems to be the myth. And again, big congrats to people of Tezos for getting what feels like an important portrait as far as this scene is concerned in the mythology of, say, the Tezos blockchain, for sure, it is now at only 64 tezos for this one of one with a day and 7 hours to go. Apologies to the bidders here, probably the last thing you want is a big light being shone on this work here. But here it is.
00:02:55.156 - 00:03:24.950, Speaker A: And I'm sure there are already several people who are waiting to, you know, bid on this. So very cool. I couldn't show every people of Tezos because there are far too many. And again, it's kind of a huge meandering show again today I'm going to try and keep it shorter than yesterday's 90 minutes there. But here you see, just to browse. And I did pick a few that kind of jumped out at me and just people that we've seen here before. And so here are recent works.
00:03:24.950 - 00:03:58.644, Speaker A: There's the myth there. So you see people of Tezos, I think it's Pierre does, you know, invites quite a few people, does several at once, I think probably goes to about this Tez pole here. And there's Rada. And actually we'll look at that in a second. So here are a few nagar separ. And it's great, this whole project because you actually learn about the artists here. And it looks like an iranian female artist is what it looks like here.
00:03:58.644 - 00:04:39.078, Speaker A: Self taught painter utilizes a brightly colored palette with flowers and breathtaking scenery as recurring themes in her artwork. So I think just really cool portrait too, by the way, you know, different approaches to the portrait. Love this, doing it from behind here. So not really seeing the face, which is an interesting take on the portrait. Looks like an AI artwork, doesn't it? But not positive on that. Could just be a digital painting. And here is Macbeth with more of what I'd be tempted to call more of a crypto art sort of feel to it, with the flashing and the skull, you know, so very cool project here.
00:04:39.078 - 00:04:57.918, Speaker A: Anna Molina, really cool. Almost looks like a photoshop ruler or a Photoshop Ui. And there are the dancing ants, if you can see that. Let me just maximize that here. You can see the dancing ants. So super interesting work. I guess you do a screen record to get that.
00:04:57.918 - 00:05:22.854, Speaker A: Anna Molina, Kika Nikolayla. See if we can get this going. There's a bit of sound on here of just the sounds like rain, actually. So of course Kika Nicolaela is a curator at object one who I met actually this fall. So shout out to Kika Nikolayla, artist and curator here. And again, you can read all about it. It's at 100 tezos.
00:05:22.854 - 00:06:12.924, Speaker A: So doing well there on these. One of one auctions, of course, mental noise, another one. Love this palette at the bottom here. And just another cool in the mirror, the full length mirror at home and, you know, again, these are unique opportunities to learn about these artists and in ways that you just wouldn't know about unless you went to their website, which many people don't even have and read their bio. Here's Radda, of course, and isn't this great? You know, Radda's character centers around the rat character with a mainly medieval theme. So all to say, the people of Tezos do an excellent job, don't they, of basically profiling, kind of, in a weird way, chronicling the history of this blockchain through self portraits of the artist. So pretty cool project.
00:06:12.924 - 00:07:07.010, Speaker A: I did this actually about six months ago, I had to venture guess eight months ago, and it was really cool. So I remember it being just an extraordinarily professional operation is how I think I described it back then. And it looks like it continues here with these great descriptions. So, you know, really helping build the history here with the people of Tezos. So let's continue here again, there's a ton to get through and we got to run big spaces tomorrow with mech TXT and colleagues and, and also the, the person who co runs his agency and all the designers, they put together a loving type exhibition. This should be one word and should be super interesting, as you can see here. It's got a nice holiday feel to it, doesn't it? Look at how pretty this is.
00:07:07.010 - 00:07:34.046, Speaker A: This looks like Christmas, doesn't it? And you gotta love the, even like the little Chris, you know what you call this pine trees here. This looks awesome. So here is the lineup and everything. Great ad as one would expect from this group. And so very cool. And thank you also for a few more purchases here from absurdity. Thank you for picking up this shuttle launch.
00:07:34.046 - 00:08:04.654, Speaker A: And yeah, I love, my favorite part was this part with the letters at the end there and a few different versions. I think they're all sold out now. Or maybe there's one left of the purple one there, which I didn't realize I still had a few left. So I just listed this morning and they went really fast. So that was awesome. So all to say, thank you, everybody, for supporting that very fun series. Continuing on, comments on yesterday's show, and let's just look here.
00:08:04.654 - 00:08:21.690, Speaker A: Julianna, you're a gem. Adrian, for the Tezos community and art world. Well, thank you. And season's greetings to Juliana. That is a very, very nice of you to say and much appreciated. Kyle Flemmer, what a show. I know you're looking to go shorter, but I don't mind a one and a half hour episode.
00:08:21.690 - 00:08:41.169, Speaker A: Thank you so much for including my work after two action packed weeks, especially in the Tezos community, that's for sure. Sabato had a comment. Maybe we'll see it in a second there. Like, do you feel like you missed much or something? We'll see it in a second. I definitely didn't beat you to the punch so far as making Ultima art. The elements aren't even mine to begin with. And I'd love to see your take on the subject matter.
00:08:41.169 - 00:09:00.733, Speaker A: You know what I think I might do with this? Hopefully my brother's not listening because that's who I used to play Ultima three and four with. I think I might. I actually figured out how to do it on aseprite, and again, it's the new version of aseprite. It's a lot easier to do this styling. I actually have a video. I think it's Kyle Flemmer from like two weeks ago. So we'll see that in a second here.
00:09:00.733 - 00:09:31.940, Speaker A: And I think I'm going to make Christmas cards is what I'm going to do with that. So could be pretty cool. I guess I'll have to send it digitally because it's getting pretty late in the day, but I think that's what I'm going to do with it. And to your point, I think I want to make custom tiles as much as I could just do Ultima. You know, I just. You know, that is my favorite part of this game. Again, the joy of the Ultima game for me is when I go to play it, let's say now, I don't feel nearly the same kind of excitement as I feel like I should feel.
00:09:31.940 - 00:10:06.068, Speaker A: But it's the visuals. It is the visuals. And I, to me, and, you know, I. For me, it was a breakthrough, thinking how important video games were to say a lot of what we see here, what I sometimes call loosely, the second generation of digital art here, and the influence it has as we see an artist like Katie Rockette and on and on, and several artists. And then I thought, you know what? It came to me as a bit of a surprise. And I was like, look, I was already making artworks with a video game inspired by Ultima. These drawings of nostalgia studies, like ten years ago.
00:10:06.068 - 00:10:46.746, Speaker A: So even myself, who I was never like a huge video game player, I was doing these homages. And again, it's like the visuality, the graphic element is really maybe the most exciting and memorable part to us. You've also anticipated my next move, making a custom tile set following Mech's example. Indeed, we're both following Mech's example there. Real breakthrough there, though, with very different subject matter. I encourage artists who are interested in this style of art to play around with tile sets. Once you get them set up in esprit, they are fun and easy to use.
00:10:46.746 - 00:11:05.848, Speaker A: And, you know, I thought this would be really complicated, but I saw Kyle Flemmer's tweet, which I'll show you in a about ten tabs here. And I actually got it set up in, like, ten minutes, and I was surprised. So it's not too complicated if you just kind of hack away at it. Rosacea. Welcome back, Pokebelly. Thank you for highlighting my work. My pleasure.
00:11:05.848 - 00:11:37.544, Speaker A: And I love when you said, I am radically skeptical of the institutions. I think a lot of people can relate to that, including me. It is a time, you know, sometimes they call it, if you've heard of that book the fourth turning, where, you know, every. It's this idea that generations have different characters in that they repeat every four generations. There's basically a four generation cycle. And the fourth turning is a very volatile part of the cycle. The fourth generation in that cycle, as far as I understand it, where institutions are kind of broken down.
00:11:37.544 - 00:12:31.734, Speaker A: And I think that's part of the spirit, the zeitgeist, so to speak, is, you know, there's a sense that these institutions are not really living up to their mandate anymore. And I think you see it maybe more clearly than anywhere in this scene, which is, I would argue, institutionally, completely ignored. But with people like myself or even RJ, you know, RJ had this great quote when I had him on this, when we had him on the space, you know, however long ago, that was maybe eight months ago for RJ, this is the most exciting thing happening in culture right now, is how he described it. And I couldn't agree more. I mean, that's why I'm talking about this and not something else. Right? So, yeah, so, and then. But however, where are the institutions? And I didn't even put the Jerry Saltz tweets.
00:12:31.734 - 00:12:57.720, Speaker A: Maybe we'll look at those tomorrow. You know, it's just like. And I mean, not that Jerry Saltz represents MoMA, but he does represent, you might say, the establishment, which is also the thinking of the institutions. And again, they think NFT art is basically a handful of artists that were popular in 2021. They haven't done the deep dive. And so I would argue. And so, you know, so that is where.
00:12:57.720 - 00:13:30.684, Speaker A: So it's kind of like common sense it's like, well, of course we're skeptical, you know. So anyway, I appreciate the comment here, and also my latest artworks that you highlighted are from the future. Drop skullscapes, world on foundation. Thank you. Rose Cho Libro, great to have you back. Been a bit lost without the artist journal. You know, as I always say, when I take breaks and people who've watched this show for a while know that I take breaks just, you know, out of necessity to kind of put gas in the engine and also for the viewer to put gas in the engine and kind of recuperate.
00:13:30.684 - 00:14:01.088, Speaker A: If you're watching a lot of these shows, it's not like the narrative really continues too far in my mind when I'm not doing it. You know, like, in a sense, like I miss this experience, too, this conversation, really, that we're having here, because it's not like it keeps going when I don't do the show. Like, I have a few thoughts here and there, but nothing like when you do this show and it like, forces you to work through what's going on here. So I'm glad, I'm glad to. I miss it, too. So thanks for the comment. Skommer, great show.
00:14:01.088 - 00:14:47.550, Speaker A: Glad to see you back. You guessed my studies almost exactly right. It's more complex than this, but one of the main poets I studied was Jackson Mac Low, who was a contemporary of John Cage's and influenced by him. I studied a lot of other process based poets like Charles Bernstein and Bernadette Mayer, too. Thanks for showing my work. And, you know, with contemporary art, you know, or art of the last 50 years, one could argue this is even more important than learning how to draw, learning these kind of John Cage and these ideas, and then you can kind of start applying your technique. But, you know, there is a certain idea set, especially in the last, say, 75 years, that really for you to make, like, truly, you know, contemporary, modern, present day art, it at least has to be informed by that.
00:14:47.550 - 00:15:11.898, Speaker A: You don't necessarily need to quote or comment these artists, but you have to know something. I would argue about randomness, for example, just to use like a very broad example. So glad to hear that. And I'm not surprised. I'm not surprised. That's probably why I mentioned John Cage there, Skomra, doing wonderful things and interesting aspects of randomness with AI art as well. Chepki, thanks for the wonderful show.
00:15:11.898 - 00:15:35.556, Speaker A: Could you share us? Oh, I have to do this. I was going to bring this up. Could you share with us those paintings you worked on for a year or more? Next show and maybe the first work you did one evening would be interesting to see. I already have the special studio lighting here because it's getting late in the day. I definitely will do this and I'm gonna try and remember next show. I would love to do that. I'd love to share those works.
00:15:35.556 - 00:15:55.296, Speaker A: I worked so long on those works, it'd be great to just share them with people. Thank you for asking. Chepki Tombham battle, thank you for the love and ikemenbyte, welcome back. Thank you. Rutger, Radha, everybody. Great to see everybody and a welcome return indeed. Thank you.
00:15:55.296 - 00:16:52.606, Speaker A: And a few more comments here I just want to highlight so El Crego and thank you everybody for the comments. I can't go through every single one, but look at this excerpt from a little essay I wrote in 2014. Buy screens for screens. At this point, where the analog space merges with the digital space, a new artistic expression is born that is entirely digital, where the final piece is born and ends up in the digital realm. Conceived through digital tools and deposited in the public digital space, these pieces of art suggest skipping the step of existing first in the real reality or physical reality to reach directly the virtual reality, which is also reality, and once from there to have an impact on the analog reality. So all to say, El Krigo has been thinking about these thoughts that I was kind of highlighting that RJ was mentioning. Yeah, it's an interesting discussion here of, you know, you know, quote unquote, where this art belongs, quote unquote.
00:16:52.606 - 00:17:13.846, Speaker A: And popple. Actually, we can go to Popple's comment here. And here's Tewks, another artist. Again, we learned from the spaces. We did it maybe three, four weeks ago. Tewks is a pretty serious art artist who's been just hacking away for years, over a decade. And so interesting comment here.
00:17:13.846 - 00:17:42.174, Speaker A: 100%. Digital art is, in fact designed to be viewed on screenshots. Answering our question here, is digital art best viewed on screens? Sabato Poco's back. Do you feel like you've come back to a changed world? I mean, I think commenting on all of the things that have happened hilariously in the last two weeks, two and a half weeks, it's hilarious. I was like, this scene doesn't need me at all. It's fine. It will survive very well.
00:17:42.174 - 00:18:03.344, Speaker A: And so, continuing on, Popple. Popple responds, who we started the show with here. Of course, this is Popple's work right there. Let's look at this fascinating comment here. Thank you for featuring my work and kind words and welcome back. Thank you. I've been using the term unprintable here and there to describe a type of art that is best viewed on screen.
00:18:03.344 - 00:18:19.752, Speaker A: It can be a good curation title theme, too, I think. Absolutely. It sounds like a Whitney major exhibition. Unprintable. Right. And maybe like, this is where we're kind of back to our institution. You know, not to distract from Popple's comment here.
00:18:19.752 - 00:18:54.866, Speaker A: Kind of back to the institution argument. If I ran the Whitney, it's like, okay, let's put an unprintable exhibition. Popple, you're the curator, or at least, you know, here's a room. You know, we'll start small, let's see what you do, and then we'll give you the big show, and then we can even discuss it on what needs. You know, that's how I'd be thinking that thinking is not out there, that I know, but maybe it's among other people. And who knows what's going on at the Whitney, for example, continuing on, basically, these type of art. Well, these type of art forms will lose most of their essence, and.
00:18:54.866 - 00:19:31.492, Speaker A: Or these types of art will lose their essence or quality when printed as still images. Indeed, particularly the gif. You know, I think popple is referring to not all digital art, and not all digital art is unprintable. On the contrary, as we know, some of the most expensive sold art here in this space are printable art. The unprintable art we love most in the space are often, as you said, the ones probably won't be seen in the main halls of art basel. And you wonder if it's just simply a structural issue. Like, is it just simply this? We sell booths at Art Basel.
00:19:31.492 - 00:20:14.750, Speaker A: Forgive the hair, my friends. It is a late in the day, and there is no take two over here on the pirate ship of the mind. You know, it could be just a inertia, right? The momentum of previous years that it's like, okay, we sell booths, and the booths have basically spaces for your paintings on the wall. I'm sure there are screens at art Basel. But all to say, it's not exactly how you think of art baseline, probably. And if you're renting a booth at Art Basel for, I don't know, 25, $50,000, are you going to put art on the screen? Right? So there's also that component. Let's continue here.
00:20:14.750 - 00:20:53.284, Speaker A: It's so wonderful that we have blockchain tokens to register and distribute unprintable art now so that they can have a chance to be treated seriously, at least financially. Yeah, I couldn't agree more. I couldn't agree more. The road is still long enough. The Tezbol thing is a good example of the clash of between new media works, largely unprintable art and old mindset method of art distribution. Even inside this space, old mindsets still prevail as we can still, as we can see. Still images are way more popular than animated interactive works on gen art markets, which is rather ironic as coding is probably the most untraditional art making method.
00:20:53.284 - 00:21:41.214, Speaker A: Interesting, interesting. Yeah. So interesting comment. I mean, put it this way, I don't necessarily see static as necessarily old mindset. I mean, I used to be a static snob when I came into the blockchain scene and I was like, this GiF stuff, you know, I don't do moving art, and I wouldn't be surprised. And maybe that is an old mindset, but for me, it's kind of all of the above. But I take your point in the sense that, like, to me, I see the old mindset in this desire to be accepted by art Basel and this need when we have this completely different thing going on here, exhibitions created by hashtags in large respects, as we saw with the screensaver show and many more.
00:21:41.214 - 00:22:23.294, Speaker A: So, yeah, alter your say, you know, all to your point here, like, we have new methods of art distribution and selling. Why are we begging to be into, you know, art? Basil's main hall. It's nice from a social proof status perspective as an artist. So I'm not going to say no, but I'm not going to be like the documenta people who were kind of, I don't want to say begging, but, you know, desperately trying to be. To, you know, be a part of documenta and say, you know, or whatever they're trying to do over there, you know. So anyway, thank you for the extended comment. Again, one of the, look at all the views on that.
00:22:23.294 - 00:22:40.070, Speaker A: 17,000 views. Thank you for the response, everybody. So, and this was also interesting, trippie also loved the idea here. I do, too. I think it put it this way, unprintable sounds like the name of a mega show at the Whitney. That let's. That's what I was trying to say earlier.
00:22:40.070 - 00:22:57.784, Speaker A: Like, that has all the sounds of a major show. There's. Let's make sure we're following Sugar TV. So let's just see. Unprintable is super on point. I've had some of my digital native artwork displayed as prints, and often it just falls flat or seems off. I think it's because when I create these images, I'm working with led light, a screen on purpose.
00:22:57.784 - 00:23:57.700, Speaker A: Now I have a word to describe it, you know, and the way I tackle this issue is, let's say those shuttle launch works that I was showing at the start that I sold, those are moving, right? Those are gifts. But I'm not against, say, taking a frame or several frames and then maybe screen printing or printing them out. Remember Lorna Mills on the test poll had, you know, she had like 30 different images to represent each frame in the GiF I to me. So the way I approach it is the physical rendition has to be kind of justified. It has to justify itself, its own existence. The physical rendition has to justify its own existence. So for me, with the screen memories series where I put these masks, digital masks, over top of Renaissance paintings, it is justified in my mind, in the fact that they are different artworks.
00:23:57.700 - 00:24:09.158, Speaker A: Because I am screen printing. I am mixing mediums. I'm putting them on inkjet, either paper or canvas. And then I screen print over top. I am playing with the mediums. I'm contrasting the mediums. It becomes a different artwork.
00:24:09.158 - 00:24:28.462, Speaker A: It becomes a different conversation. And so that is how I approach the physical. The physical. You have to, to me, it has to have a different. It has to justify itself if, if that makes sense. So thank you for the comments there, everybody. We should probably run here, but just really great.
00:24:28.462 - 00:24:51.180, Speaker A: My, you lone wick, true face, Artie hands, who's going to be on a space in January. I'm excited to announce. And we have some pretty amazing New Year's guests, let me tell you, coming up here. I'll announce in maybe next week or something. Thank you, everybody. Oh, and Dan Kelly on the carbon footprints. Thanks for responding to my comment re carbon footprints.
00:24:51.180 - 00:25:33.050, Speaker A: I think you have a point about the banking sector being more detrimental, but I was more curious about why bitcoin versus cleaner proof of stake currencies. I read something this week about ordinals that helped answer that question. From leprochant, I realize that the blockchain where your art truly resides within the blockchain is BTC with BRC 20 ordinals. In the case of other blockchains, such as Esal, Tezos, and Cardano, what exists on the blockchain is a path that opens a file stored on the. What is it? The interplanetary file server. Shout out to Santiago, who corrected me on that. Is it codal? So now ETH, of course you can mint on chain, but it's rarely done.
00:25:33.050 - 00:26:27.318, Speaker A: Tazo is also the eight bit, what is it called? Those little nine square eight bidoo is also on chain, we learned about a month ago. But to Lepro Chant's point, in most cases it is stored on interplanetary file server. So a separate, so it's just like a link to the image, so to speak. So, so there's something to be said for minting on chain, you know, particularly from an artist perspective, in the sense that it's kind of forever. And again, you know, another aspect finally, we're going way too long here, but another aspect finally on this is also when you're minting on bitcoin, you have financial constraints. Again, it's about $10 a kilobyte last I tried. So, you know, I kind of try and keep it to 5 kb max.
00:26:27.318 - 00:27:20.268, Speaker A: Right. And so that also I think, you know, it kind of adds to the argument that this isn't, you know, putting 5 kb or even 3 kb on bitcoin. How much of damage to the environment is that doing in the end versus even a three megabytes on interplanetary file server with, on ethereum or tezos? Like it's a, again, I just don't know the answer. But it seems with all of the things we do on a daily basis, getting a car, you know, everything I listed yesterday, everything that gets thrown out even if you recycle and do all your organic, it seems to me that, and I don't know the answer, but it seems to me it's probably if you put a two kilobyte file on bitcoin. I wouldn't, yeah, I wouldn't. Stress is sort of my personal view, but again, everybody has their own approach. Mark Kelly today's deadline for foundation worlds to be upgraded to the new contract.
00:27:20.268 - 00:27:36.784, Speaker A: So I had no idea. So I checked once more. So I guess if you have a foundation world, they're asking you to upgrade the new contract. And that was the deadline was yesterday. So I checked once more. Dollar 927 is the current ask in gas. So this is on Ethereum.
00:27:36.784 - 00:28:26.468, Speaker A: So I don't imagine too many world owners will be converting. They'll either disappear in case all seven, except for the dollar store or foundation will jump in at the last minute to mint the worlds themselves or to extend the deadline, will be keenly awaiting the outcome. But in the meantime, I'd recommend the artists don't pay to launch in unconverted worlds. This is the big problem. Like if you want to know the answer, in my opinion, why Solana is doing phenomenally right now and why people are excited, this is the reason they still have not fixed the fees. And it's always the next cycle, the next version, we're going to get the fees and that's what they're saying. And there is issues with the L2s, even with Zora, which I love, and I still collect on Zora, but to get in and out, to use the bridge cost me over $100 to get the money out.
00:28:26.468 - 00:28:53.424, Speaker A: And I mean, with the regular banking sector, that would be outrageous. And I think DJ Curo was mentioning it kind of defeats a little bit the purpose of a L2. Now, again, I love Sora, and they're just working within the constraints that they have and trying to do the best they can and what can they do about that? But it's interesting bridging over if it still costs a fortune and people talk about $40,000 ETH. Like, maybe that happens. I don't see it. Like, I don't even. I think it's expensive.
00:28:53.424 - 00:29:21.052, Speaker A: Now I'm kind of like a bit of. I'm a bit of a bear on Ethan. This is exactly the reason. You know, there's even people who are in crypto who can maybe afford, who have a lot of ETH. Like, I mean, really $927. It's, you know, you don't need to get too many fees like that to go, you know, what. What's Solana up to? What's Polkadot up to, Zach? Attention, people in Finland.
00:29:21.052 - 00:29:48.004, Speaker A: Alustra is a brand new NFT platform created by the National Gallery of Finland, built on Zora. They're having a launch party tomorrow. So this was a couple of weeks ago, November 30. But just to say, look at what Zora's doing. Zora continues to do very impressively, increasingly looking like a competitor to object just in, you know, this sort of stuff. I mean, object is working with MoMA, remember? Now here's Zora. National Gallery of Finland.
00:29:48.004 - 00:30:14.540, Speaker A: Competition is good, you know, and there's more than one way to do things. And I think it keeps everybody honest, you know, so to speak. You know, I put in quotes, like, working hard is what I mean by that. Keeps everybody, you know, not getting too comfortable and keeping to improve their platforms. Also, three incredible NFT platforms built on Zora Gemma projects, Alusta and neutro. So interesting. I don't think I've seen.
00:30:14.540 - 00:30:29.196, Speaker A: I think I saw mint fun is another one. Yeah. Geese. A few days ago on Artists journal, Pokebelly said that he would love to see Nina Waltz's pieces on physical. Well, folks, she just made it the real deal. Adorable piece. So this is Dylan and unconscious, available on object.
00:30:29.196 - 00:30:57.750, Speaker A: Primary owner will get the original physical piece, including the hand side authenticity certificate. Acrylic on canvas will be sent in protected wood box with worldwide shipping. So how cool is that? And here you see a physical rendition. It looks great. I'd almost like to see it more zoomed in, but that's pretty cool. And really great abstracts there that Dylan has been putting out on tazos. So how cool is that? A few more physical works.
00:30:57.750 - 00:31:14.930, Speaker A: This interesting artist, Jean Provencher, that keeps popping up in my feed. Interestingly, like this looks like a pen plotter, doesn't it? Like, I don't know, but it looks like a pen plotter. The way this is done. Very cool. You can see like, the dents in the paper here. Just super cool. Demon ego.
00:31:14.930 - 00:31:37.458, Speaker A: My work for angels and Demons exhibition now live on Ninfa. So these look like physicals, don't they? I'm not sure, but you see, like, the color of the paper here. And if these are physicals, they're gorgeous. They're absolutely gorgeous. And who knows how they're made. Printed inkjet print or a combination of inkjet print and maybe colored pencils. Super interesting.
00:31:37.458 - 00:31:52.734, Speaker A: Demon ego really traveling through the mediums over here. Just super cool. Look at this. This is Bersektor. And again, this is stuff from the last couple of weeks here. First drop in Arzora. Here's an airdrop, physical, one of one piece, the plumber.
00:31:52.734 - 00:32:14.114, Speaker A: How cool is that? Nice and big here. Again, I'm all for this physicality rendition. I think it just builds range with a lot of. And credibility with blockchain artists. Martin Bruce Admin. Interesting title, really. Another mysteriously great painting by Martin Bruce with almost what looks like the.
00:32:14.114 - 00:32:40.834, Speaker A: What do you call that? The. Does anybody remember what that's called? I can't remember what that's called. The mysterious half man, half ape that goes through the forests, the tundras in North America. Just a great painting from Martin Bruce. Here is what I was discussing earlier. Inspired to learn how to use tilesets by Michael Macasso and prompted by Mick renders. Can't believe how insanely easy this is.
00:32:40.834 - 00:33:09.502, Speaker A: I've been copying and pasting tiles like a chump for over 20 years. So I tell you, I thought, oh, how do you do that? I loaded up aseprite. You got to get the new version. And it was almost as simple as dragging this tile set that you can find online, say, for ultima four into here. And you just got to kind of work out a few kinks. And before you know it, you're making really cool video game paintings here. Like Kyle Flemmer is just super fun and cool.
00:33:09.502 - 00:33:27.776, Speaker A: I'm going to make Christmas cards, I think, with this same tileset that Kyle's using. So just very cool here. I mean, just super cool. I don't want to leave it. Look at this. Look at this. Okay, that is the video.
00:33:27.776 - 00:33:53.354, Speaker A: That is the video. Evelyn o. Explaining your art process in long threads and artist statements versus hoping people get something out of your work. Looking at it first is underestimating your audience by over explaining an artist and artist statements versus under where it's just showing it with saying nothing is overestimating your audience. I thought this was a very insightful comment from Evelyn. Evelyn o. Who, of course, has that great object, one exhibition.
00:33:53.354 - 00:34:19.093, Speaker A: I thought this was another interesting tidbit from Sabato. This again from a couple of weeks ago. Cooking and glitch art are both process arts. There's a reason why glitch artists talk so much about sauces and baking, fried graphics and crispy pixels. We're a hungry bunch of interesting comparison between cooking, kind of an imprecise art, and you're just trying to make things work and. Okay, needs a little more salt. I like the comparison a lot.
00:34:19.093 - 00:34:41.954, Speaker A: So interesting comment. Eizo. Just glitching away over here. So inside the artist studio here of a glitch artist and just looking awesome here. Working on the ele Pritz, which we're going to look at today, and a few others. The Venus de milo on top of the old CRT screens here. Look at this element li, our wonderful experimental pixel artist using a vertical plotter.
00:34:41.954 - 00:35:03.314, Speaker A: Very bold. I mean, you gotta love this. Look at this. So just adding another element of randomness, kind of back to John Cage here and Robert Rauschenberg, mercy Cunningham. Very interesting. So you gotta, like, look at that. Look at this contraption.
00:35:03.314 - 00:35:41.594, Speaker A: Rutger van DER Tass, Pokemon. Here's a link to my ordinal collection on magic Eden. So this I never showed yesterday, but I do want to show that I'm still into this bitcoin thing. Here is a link, and here is the collection. So what I really love about what Rutger did here is there's a collection, and I'm not exactly sure how to make a collection. Rutger, if you're watching this, I need to just message Rutger, actually, and figure out how to make a collection. Because one of the problems, say I have on magic Eden is I get this big, you know, when I'm into work, I get a big warning.
00:35:41.594 - 00:35:59.580, Speaker A: Okay, this is warning buyer. This is not part of an official collection. So XYZ buyer beware. I'd love it to look like this. I already know what I'd call my series. So something maybe a Christmas holiday project. Although I don't know how many Christmas holidays I'm taking here.
00:35:59.580 - 00:36:14.344, Speaker A: But something to do over the Christmas season. Artificial intimacy. And here you go. So here you see the collection name. And here's an example. And it is selling for zero five bitcoin. So cool work from Rutger.
00:36:14.344 - 00:36:30.814, Speaker A: Thank you also for the comment, RJ. So a really mysterious series here by RJ. Conceptual as ever. Hey, all very excited to present choices. A special three of three to end the year. One edition on Ethereum, one on tezos, one on Solana. Concurrent 24 hours.
00:36:30.814 - 00:36:49.582, Speaker A: Auctions will start today at 517 o'clock GMT, with equivalent reserves of 0.01 ETH, 25 tezos and 0.3 sol. Respective links below. So RJ likes to work with the mechanics here. So here it is on Solana with a. What do we have here? Highest bid is 0.3
00:36:49.582 - 00:37:05.356, Speaker A: sol. Minimum is 0.4, though. So maybe. So it's interesting, right? Because we're gonna see here, there's one bid for 25 tezos on Solana. And I might add a very nice piece here. This looks like a Picasso dove.
00:37:05.356 - 00:37:32.576, Speaker A: Interestingly, just on. I thought it was beautiful. The negative space on the back here. And it's probably, I would, you know, say probably based on what I'd loosely, what we always call here, spectral AI. You know, paintings made by AI, often using famous artists like David Hockney as sources. Edward Hopper is RJ will often do. And then using that as your source image.
00:37:32.576 - 00:37:45.648, Speaker A: And then you make a pixel work. I love this screen, how there's that one pixel. It's. The color is beautiful. It's very nicely done. RJ is making a ton of work right now, and it shows. It's chosen the quality of the work.
00:37:45.648 - 00:38:02.414, Speaker A: Look at the negative space on this piece. Brilliant. Beautiful, beautiful. Here's the work on foundation, already at zero three. So fun. They look identical. Interestingly, look at this beautiful work that came out too, a couple of weeks ago, which I never got the chance to show, I don't think.
00:38:02.414 - 00:38:24.070, Speaker A: Really beautiful work. Maybe I did show this, but I thought it was just so stunning, the color on this editions of zero. So I'm not exactly sure what happened there, but we got a run. We're already at 40 minutes here, 38 minutes. There it is. Now it turned into edition of five. And here are the, actually the Microsoft Windows works that were retweeted by Windows.
00:38:24.070 - 00:38:49.324, Speaker A: Hilariously one of them homage to the window. So those are doing quite well, actually. The one of ones look all sold out except for this one here at 75. So RJ mint and money here. Rinnefish slipping away as we continue here. Kind of a original composition. Great music, too.
00:38:49.324 - 00:39:25.368, Speaker A: So really cool work here from Renny Fish. Again, playing with the, you know, oftentimes the work is in the middle. Maybe this was from for screensaver. Screensaver Tez, you know, I loved that exhibition that what I want to call just did that online exhibition because it forced like look. All of a sudden Rinnefish is changing her composition and testing out different things in order to make a screensaver, I think super interesting. Really nice edition of eleven with that animal, capybara, that Sabato likes so much. Wasteman, gold, minovitch.
00:39:25.368 - 00:39:34.884, Speaker A: This came out also a couple of weeks ago. Elon Musk. A portrait. Just an interesting portrait here. Interesting composition. Sad face. He had a few.
00:39:34.884 - 00:39:48.016, Speaker A: Wasteman had a few. Kind of Bill Gates, you know, richest people in the world sort of series. Nice. Wonderfully bitter. Wonderfully bitter series. The taste portrait of Samuel Jackson. This is December 19.
00:39:48.016 - 00:40:09.714, Speaker A: So this is brand new. So cool. Kind of another kind of famous contemporary figure here with Samuel Jackson looking from pulp Fiction here with the Statue of Liberty in the background. Pipi Universal, very up close of a. Someone seemingly smoking a cigarette here. Interesting composition. Almost like one big tooth in the front there.
00:40:09.714 - 00:40:39.718, Speaker A: Interesting piece. And edition of five. And let's just see. And one left at 20 tezos Edmarola on Solana here. And so Windeman and I think, yeah, this pixel dream series, I think Ed's been on Solana for a while, but a couple of new ones here. I think this is an open edition, I think, again, just minted here. So classic Ed Marolla, a devil, kind of a dream landscape here.
00:40:39.718 - 00:41:06.694, Speaker A: And wind going through it. And we have another. I thought this was great. The title work from home. And here is someone almost this monk like figure working on a laptop from home, almost with a medieval. Look at this great fire, this beautiful Ed Marolla fire in the background with the skeleton waving, not losing a sense of humor. And even this kind of, you know, what I want to call retro kind of framing device here.
00:41:06.694 - 00:41:30.002, Speaker A: Looks like a 18th or 19th century, you know, what would you call that? I don't know. Let's continue rustic digital art. So there's a vanguard collection. Again, I can't show everything, but here is rustic digital art. One of the cards, rustic, had a couple of cards. I thought this was a pretty cool portrait here with v for vanguard, of course. And here are some of the other works here.
00:41:30.002 - 00:41:47.760, Speaker A: And there are all sorts, as you can see, of works from this vanguard card series. And I think they're in the Tez vending machine if you're looking to pick some up. Look at that. I think Ratcloak picked up this hanged artist, the magic artist. That's by Eric Raim. There's the myth. Doing one.
00:41:47.760 - 00:42:05.600, Speaker A: A really cool myth there. Again, Kurt Hussle collective. I think we, I have that later in the show. So just really cool work here from the vanguard, a group on Dezos here. There's another rustic digital art. And I think I have maybe. And there's some more lackos.
00:42:05.600 - 00:42:20.462, Speaker A: I think I brought that up, too. There's a couple of more lackos. I couldn't. I just picked a few here because clearly I can't go. There's Mikey Wilson, but you get the point. So check that out on Red Knight of the wastelands. So a rare work by Morlakos.
00:42:20.462 - 00:42:42.058, Speaker A: I don't see a ton by Morlacos. Look at this great orange sky, but one of the favorites on this show. And a cool night figure with horns. Those morlacos horns. So maybe a self portrait there with almost like a myth inspired sky, but orange cool ratio here, too, with these cards. Look at this eyelay. This is from December 3.
00:42:42.058 - 00:42:54.098, Speaker A: I thought this was super interesting. This is for the screensaver. One pixels bodysuit. I thought this was super cool. Again, it looks like. I think Pixelmator is making these squares. This was really nicely done.
00:42:54.098 - 00:43:19.230, Speaker A: I like the roughness here. Really nicely done of this bodysuit. Edition of 15. One on secondary for 25 Turkorak. This was really cool. Dating game show hypnosis. I thought this was, first of all, the composition is super interesting, right? With the person turning away, directing your gaze towards this very contemporary screen.
00:43:19.230 - 00:43:56.604, Speaker A: Looks like the kind of screen you'd get at a modern Saturn or best buy or wherever you buy your electronics and probably the Internet coming in to feed that thing and then watching a dating show while, you know, drinking a pop here in the kitchen. You know, so you know, they're just looking on dating. And of course, these shows do hypnotize you, right? This was also a cool work by Turk. Rack from about a week ago. Prod continually. And just another kind of one of these domestic. It's like semi hellish domestic scenes that Turk rack loves to do.
00:43:56.604 - 00:44:15.684, Speaker A: Huge fan of those. Katrina create. Where are you running? And here is another one of one by Katrina create. Just a super cool, fun artist putting out a lot of one of ones are usually pretty reasonably priced. Super colorful. Beautiful texture. Just really kind of a nice, like, really cool approach to the body here.
00:44:15.684 - 00:44:32.644, Speaker A: Almost a Picasso esque, but also kind of like a children's illustration book. Interesting color as well. And again, these kind of outlines on top. A lot going on and sold out of this at ten tezos. Just a strange thing. So nice purchase there. Nice collector.
00:44:32.644 - 00:44:50.926, Speaker A: And here, as you'll see, looks like all sold out of the one of ones. So you got to be quick when here's one for 99, probably on secondary. Yeah. So a really cool artist and illustrator. Paper Buddha. Confirmation to give. To give is non attachment.
00:44:50.926 - 00:45:18.022, Speaker A: And so this is from December 4. And just another cool classic. Tezos artist uses a lot of collage elements, but mixes it with digital, you know, it's digital collage. So as you can see here, this looks like it's repeated. I don't know if you can see that black on black in the background there. That almost looks like the shadow of this smoke that is repeated on this side. Again, there's digital elements here.
00:45:18.022 - 00:45:52.084, Speaker A: This is stuff that you basically couldn't do manually. So taking collage and then making it only where you can do things digitally with it. In a sense, to do it physically, it would be hard to do this kind of collage physically, if not impossible. And I know that because I actually interviewed paper Buddha on one of retro Manny's pixel art spaces for Retro man, where there was cover done. Anyway, cool artist on tazos. Shout out to paper Buddha. Super interesting person.
00:45:52.084 - 00:46:24.128, Speaker A: Haru Komoda. I've never seen this artist before, I don't think. And so just a really cool animated abstract here, isn't it? On x. Continuing on, rannixteer with a bold contrast here with this kind of sharp line and then this super fuzzy, almost airbrushed kind of area here. Painted area. And then almost stripping here, interestingly. And another kind of surreal kind of objects.
00:46:24.128 - 00:46:38.848, Speaker A: Almost like de Chirico a little bit. And just cool work here. Zero of zero. So maybe burn. There may be a new edition of this. Continuing on, Francois Gamma. So just a cool abstract here from Francois Gamma.
00:46:38.848 - 00:46:58.636, Speaker A: Isn't it kind of rare to see this style of work? I would say a lantern. Three Tezos edition of 20. There's one left. Nice piece. Has dribble waffle with a new waffle edition. This looks like it was minted, like, immediately. Minted out immediately or canceled.
00:46:58.636 - 00:47:14.206, Speaker A: The mint immediately. It was done. Maybe we have the time. It was all done, like, I think within an hour or so, if I'm not mistaken here. So there's ahec right on the scene in Santiago and Kurt Hussel collective. Great. So that is great to see.
00:47:14.206 - 00:47:41.554, Speaker A: Let's look a bit closer to it. So usually these are kind of semi untitled. Usually there's just icons. And again, uses softwares like Kidpix, Mario paint, and a lot of kids programs, often times in the browser. So humble tools to make these super interesting works. And just some figures here. Someone lifting weights, a few figures running through, and maybe a kind of a monster figure or the big person at the gym with the other weights.
00:47:41.554 - 00:47:58.294, Speaker A: It looks like the gym, doesn't it? That's hilarious. I did yoga at the gym for the first time in, like, 15 years. That was kind of. I felt great afterwards, I have to say. I have to say. Francois Gamma search Ulb so another Francois gamma work. Actually, look at this.
00:47:58.294 - 00:48:25.074, Speaker A: So interesting digital pattern here in this outline of what looks like a figure. Also from 2009 edition of 20. And there are 16 left. One of the most prolific artists on the blockchain, Francois Gamma NUV 1914. Charcot one. So another interesting gradient work. Radical, bold experimentation from NUV 1914, as usual.
00:48:25.074 - 00:48:47.230, Speaker A: And this figure made of triangles here and everything. Look, these gradients again. There's always these, like, bold colors really playing with notions of aesthetics and aesthetic expectation, I'd argue. Look at this green, like, outrageous, right? But making it work, you know, I'm a big collector. One of one for ten tezos. Like, this is not. I I love this kind of work.
00:48:47.230 - 00:49:10.032, Speaker A: Like, it's very challenging to, you know, at first. And at first, you're not sure what to make of it, but you see, like, the. Especially in the consistency of it, you really start to appreciate it. It becomes, you know, one of your favorites in the end. Revilsky under pressure. And I think I saw this in Kableen. Had an awesome feed today with great works from Tazo.
00:49:10.032 - 00:49:36.414, Speaker A: So here, UFO again, kind of a psychedelic illustrator with a bit of a. This would probably work brilliantly as a Rizzo print here with these great gradients here. And you almost see the print like quality, texture to the work. Another mushroom coming out of the cloud. UFO's all your iconography of a deep psychedelic experience here. Uh, very cool. Five tezos edition of 15 and 13 are left.
00:49:36.414 - 00:49:52.504, Speaker A: A new pixel Langton. This came out. Oh, this was October 28, I was on Popple's feed there and I was like, I have never seen this one. We missed this when it came out. I was just shaking things out. So anyways, a new pixel Langton. Great to see a purple one.
00:49:52.504 - 00:50:10.048, Speaker A: And this is available on primary still for 15 tazos. Skeleton shrimp. Very cool. And Daniel W. More mushrooms here. The dream. And huge margins here with this almost really funky, psychedelic seventies wallpaper.
00:50:10.048 - 00:50:23.406, Speaker A: Reminds me of my bedroom. Shout out to mom. That wallpaper is still up. Not quite like this, but similar. Similar in spirit, we might say. And here are some mushrooms growing out of a pot with a cool, nice. This is like signature here.
00:50:23.406 - 00:50:37.422, Speaker A: This window in the corner here, that is signature. Dan W. Kind of a surreal. There's a surrealism here and a subtlety in these kind of moves. Very cool. Psilocyb cubiensis. That's definitely a psychedelic theme there.
00:50:37.422 - 00:50:56.588, Speaker A: Alone, another horror work by Daniel W. This time, a girl in the forest and some sort of. I don't know if that's fire or mist or something. Coming up alone, a haunted work here by Daniel W. Edition of 25 for five tazos each. Let's continue. Kurt Hussle collective.
00:50:56.588 - 00:51:17.460, Speaker A: Magic messenger. So a couple of works here by the ever interesting Kurt Hussle collective here. And this came out. Name? Daisong Speed, star of the heavens. This came out December 4 edition of 20 for ten tezos each, with explainer gallery. So a collaboration there. And here.
00:51:17.460 - 00:51:28.944, Speaker A: This came out November 29. So, right, as I thought, this was brilliant. I think there's great music here. I don't think we've looked at this. Maybe we looked at this on the last day. I'm not sure. I don't think so.
00:51:28.944 - 00:52:03.194, Speaker A: I love the music. The music's awesome. It has kind of a nineties kind of house, like that kind of really upbeat, optimistic house from the nineties. Wicked work from Kurt Hussle collective. Still available for 31 tazos. Oh, wonderful. I own one wonderful shout out to Kurt Hustle collective, who also put out this card here, the Vanguard cards collection.
00:52:03.194 - 00:52:22.524, Speaker A: This is awesome. So again, there's JNk and Terry Visual, the Kurt Hussle collective here. And they have their own Vanguard card, edition of 15. Probably sold out or just sent to everybody. And one sale for ten tezos. Very cool. And Martin Bruce with a very interesting painting.
00:52:22.524 - 00:52:38.714, Speaker A: This was again, November 29. So I'm kind of going back in the bookmarks a bit here to works I missed. And then I'll be caught up after this show, I think. Actually, not entirely. There are some screensaver works that maybe I will show on Thursday. Very nice painting, though here. Digital painting by Martin Bruce.
00:52:38.714 - 00:53:03.992, Speaker A: Violet trip, your decision. Audio visual loop. And this is put out on December 1. And let's actually hit play here. Kind of an edgy, edgy, bold kind of work here. Gotta love the dithering. And the windows kind of reminds me of one bit necro.
00:53:03.992 - 00:53:28.980, Speaker A: A little bit, like, would hang really well with one bit necro, which is a major compliment for Violet trip here, because one bit necro being one of the. Really one of my favorite. I think a lot of people's all time, like one of their favorite pixel artists on tazos. This would hang really nice in that show. So cool work from Violet Trip. And also look at this on sealed art. There were these works here also by Violet Tripp.
00:53:28.980 - 00:53:48.868, Speaker A: So interesting. Again, edgy pixel art here with these windows and some what looks like japanese cigarettes. Let's see if we can make that. Well, here's bigger. And let's see if we can go back. And here are some other works. A gun and just cool work.
00:53:48.868 - 00:54:10.844, Speaker A: A knife. Almost like a sailor moon character. So edgy, right? Black and white, one bit by violent trip. So again, using that one bit, black and white. And finally, this looks like maybe two or three bit. So just really interesting art here. So that's unsealed art from violet trip.
00:54:10.844 - 00:54:39.188, Speaker A: Go golitis. Virtual is real. Kind of has a daft punk feel to it, doesn't it? And I think gogolitis is french. So very cool here, like daft punk and hearing, taste, smell. Site mapping. Kind of a complimentary piece to the other work that we saw, which was a reality simulator device, I think, 2.0. So a nice kind of companion piece, still available for 27 tezos on primary.
00:54:39.188 - 00:55:06.956, Speaker A: There are nine left, at least when I loaded that tab, which might have been yesterday. Also by gogolitis, Space Quest and the virtual realm. This is part of the pixelation series by Super Chief. And again, playing with a video game theme. And here we see a flying spaceship with different planets. And so again, kind of a video game theme here on this work on foundation listed at Halfa ETH. Heidi Rockette hard flip.
00:55:06.956 - 00:55:29.326, Speaker A: So, continuing the video game theme here with another interesting glitch RoM by Haiti Rockette Die Hard. I guess there was game, and this is a one of one. So interesting and listed. Didn't sell in nine minutes, so now it's a one of one for the, you know, Haiti rocket collection there. Glitch house. Here's another one. Nice piece here, too.
00:55:29.326 - 00:55:55.656, Speaker A: Nice landscape and I love these horizontal pixels. We also see them in Kappn or figments. And yeah, another one of one from Haiti, Rockette. I mean, it's a great strategy, right? If you feel like your work's not selling, burn everything and turn into a one of one. Those people that maybe felt were on the fence might go, oh, should have got that one. Or maybe I want to bid on that figments plant lab. So again, more horizontal pixels here.
00:55:55.656 - 00:56:22.816, Speaker A: This wonderful old software that figments, also known as kappn, is using. And here's just an office, almost would hang well with Skomara's pieces with people at the computer, among other works. Love the window here with kind of a mountain seeming a mountain in the background with a starry night there. Very cool from figments. And this is available for $25.55 on secondary. Here's more Ultima.
00:56:22.816 - 00:56:39.384, Speaker A: This is, I think, Ultima three, if I had to venture a guess. More ultima art. Ultima bad attack. This is from late November. I don't think I showed this. It is possible I did, but just very cool. Here's another 1 November 28 Stargate.
00:56:39.384 - 00:57:04.110, Speaker A: And yeah, you get like the troll figure or the tinkerer. And again, so playing with ultima tile sets. Very cool. Silva sand twos golden hour. Here is more glitch rom work with just a horse going through a sunset here, glitched out pixel Rari. Let's see if Pixel Rari's work. Don't worry, if Pokebelly doesn't see your artwork, he sees something else, and that's okay.
00:57:04.110 - 00:57:18.062, Speaker A: Well, I thought this was pretty cool. Thank you for the comment, Pixelare. Pixelare, I believe. Italian, I believe. And just an interesting, cool look at that. Stay human in here. A cool kind of pixelated out Gif.
00:57:18.062 - 00:57:48.170, Speaker A: And thank you for the retweet there as well. McRender's don't pull the cartridge. So this another take on the video game, kind of glitching out the video game, in a sense. You don't see your classic glitches Rom glitch software here. It feels more like, if I had to guess, more like video glitching. But maybe it's using both. And maybe that's why we get these awesome textures here again, mixing several processes.
00:57:48.170 - 00:58:16.856, Speaker A: As you know, Mick renders does as well as someone like Sky Goodman retro Manny with new drop tomorrow. So let's see this. So again, here's a different take on the tezpool, turning it into a video game, which is pretty hilarious with instructions and everything. This actually could be a video game. That's a great idea. And other video game concepts here from Retro Manny. So pretty cool.
00:58:16.856 - 00:58:47.528, Speaker A: And of course we remember that. I think from yesterday I was showing that. So all pretty fun isn't it? Continuing on LB. This was while I was gone as well. December 6 when I was in Saskatoon. I remember this one playing with the Windows XP or Windows probably even seven launch screen or background and then adding what looks like, I think a Mario paint figure here and glitching it out. I think that happy Face is a default Mario paint.
00:58:47.528 - 00:59:05.176, Speaker A: Really nice piece here for the screensaver tez event and I might have a few more tomorrow. Look at these beautiful works from LB. Like few kind of stunners coming out here from LB. Wonderfully textured. This is just rich. Very rich. Lights out.
00:59:05.176 - 00:59:23.634, Speaker A: Here's another one, indoor net shadow. So doing something a little different here. Adding some spice into the mix. And the textures are gorgeous. Again, I'm kind of back to Kiro's like analog video paintings. Like that's kind of what this looks like here. Super interesting work from Elbie.
00:59:23.634 - 00:59:51.378, Speaker A: And here continuing with the glitch, Sabato with some new works on Solana as well. Exchange art. So of course Sabato had been minting on Solana before. We'll see if this loads up. And these really cool. You know, I remember Sabato saying in a Twitter space that abstract expressionist type works tend to do well in Solana at least like eight or ten months ago. So Sabato had launched this series, raw skies on Solana.
00:59:51.378 - 01:00:09.552, Speaker A: So here are a few new ones. See if this loads up. I really like the backdrop that they do there as you're waiting. So more interesting glitches. And again, this is taking raw image format data bending glitch. So just a really cool series here. Love the subtlety of this one which should load up in a second here.
01:00:09.552 - 01:00:22.960, Speaker A: Here it is. Very subtle work here by sabato. Very nice piece for sol. So not letting go of it. Cheap. And this also commissioned by Xerox by Gino. This is a really cool work.
01:00:22.960 - 01:00:51.584, Speaker A: I think I might have been sent one in its various presentations. Anxiety and self doubt introduced. So pretty cool. I can't go through the whole thing but very rich textures. So pretty hilarious. Very nice work. So check that one out.
01:00:51.584 - 01:01:08.850, Speaker A: I believe it is Geno, commissioned by Xerox spam art. And also here is Geno. Okay, well, here is Genoa. That happened randomly. Gino Beddiston. So more really cool. Glitched portraiture by Eizo, this time in collaboration with Geno.
01:01:08.850 - 01:01:31.260, Speaker A: Just awesome what eizo is doing here. Huge fan. Here is Eizo with quantum communications. And this came out December 6, so more cool kind of glitch portraiture. And here's Eli Pritz, who I think we saw earlier in the show there. Really nice piece here too. So super cool.
01:01:31.260 - 01:01:47.244, Speaker A: I was thrilled to be a part of this series. You see that? 79 tezos edition of ten now on secondary. Really cool work. This was hilarious. This is for the Vanguard cards. Edge Q. Big shout out to edge Q, who shows up to the spaces every so often on stage there.
01:01:47.244 - 01:02:11.940, Speaker A: I thought this was a hilarious subject matter, this picture. Doc Ellis, apparently there's. I think there's a Netflix or something. I'm not, I haven't watched it, but pitched a no hitter on LSD. And it's so, it's this documentary, I think that happened where, you know, Doc Ellis was the pitcher here on LSD, pitches a no hitter where. Meaning the nobody. Like almost a perfect game.
01:02:11.940 - 01:02:33.544, Speaker A: Like where no, nobody got a solid hit on the baseball game. Pittsburgh Pirates. I mean, how perfect is that? So hilarious subject matter and nice execution there with, what is his name? Humphrey. Not Humphrey Osmond. But how am I forgetting the guy who invented. It'll come to me. It'll come to me.
01:02:33.544 - 01:02:49.198, Speaker A: Okay, continuing on, another awesome piece by bosque Grazias. Albert Hoffman. Albert Hoffman. I wasn't going to let this show end without me not knowing that. Look at this. Another stunner. Another original looking work here.
01:02:49.198 - 01:03:10.094, Speaker A: Beautiful juxtaposition here by Bosque Gratias awesome fortezos edition of five. And here is Sulkian, I can't remember who said it, this. Wonderfully weird works by Sulkian. Yeah, well, we got more. And. Yeah, like, look at this. Totally weird.
01:03:10.094 - 01:03:40.554, Speaker A: Out of Argentina. A really cool artist and very friendly person. If you go to Sulkian's early work on Tezos, you'll find an awesome generative art series with synths. And also some of my first works I bought on Tezos were from Sulkian, which combined like, palm trees synths and kind of what I'd call, like loosely, psychedelia. And I'm not sure if this is going to load up or if we have time. We kind of saw it in that preview here. Here you go.
01:03:40.554 - 01:03:55.114, Speaker A: I mean, is there volume? No. So look at it. Yeah. Like wonderfully strange, aren't they? And this is selling for 0.2 ETH by Sulkian. Super interesting artist, apparently. Spends a lot of time on the work.
01:03:55.114 - 01:04:26.318, Speaker A: Yo, Salazar, some of us are already dead. Plasticine in acrylic box and then turned into a GLB here. NFT and physical piece shipping not included. How cool is that? So it's basically a sculpture, an object, an art object, but then turned into a GLB. I have never seen that before, but I can't think of a better way of kind of looking at this work as a collector. The only thing that maybe perhaps is missing is scale. You know, how big is this? You know, maybe.
01:04:26.318 - 01:04:43.474, Speaker A: Is it 10 cm? Is it a meter? Right. It's probably, I'd guess like 10 cm by 10 cm. But maybe that might be the only missing thing. But very cool work. Compressed narratives into the AI we go Danielle King versus from the abstract. So this is part of an impromptu series. This is one that stood out here.
01:04:43.474 - 01:05:10.642, Speaker A: Nice still life of flowers. Again, kind of a Matisse touch here in this very cool improv series from Danielle King. One of mixing, blending the styles of collage, mixed media and abstract painting to express a spectrum of emotional and psychological states. Medium form AI via m props open studio beta. I still got to try that out, put it on the list. And here, of course, is Yohain ETH. And look at this.
01:05:10.642 - 01:05:32.022, Speaker A: Just another really cool AI painting with those classic colors and figures by Joa in movement studies. Super cool. And here, of course, is Lily illo new preparedness framework. I thought another bold composition here. Always experimenting here. Cool shadow, too. That doesn't match up.
01:05:32.022 - 01:05:49.566, Speaker A: Pretty surreal work here. Nice piece. And here is toques. And look at this. Look at how good the AI is at rendering physically textured paint. Let me see if I can zoom in on this. I mean, that's pretty amazing.
01:05:49.566 - 01:06:07.126, Speaker A: This is AI, as far as I understand here. Like, that is incredible. Okay, so tooks continuing to dazzle here. Look at this. I mean, it's amazing. It's simply amazing. Right? Strange thing playing off of.
01:06:07.126 - 01:06:43.772, Speaker A: Is that a bellini with dead christ, right? Very famous dead christ with feet. That's what it looks like in terms of the composition here. But here turned into a wide scale kind of landscape format painting with this beautiful texture here too. And everybody with these kind of oxygen masks as well here on the side. Very moody. Interesting, beautiful, brilliant painting by strange thing, as usual, little cakes displayed a gift to kells for organizing the hand grails event. So I thought this was another just kind of classic strange little cakes work.
01:06:43.772 - 01:07:01.610, Speaker A: And with the hands, there was another work with the hands, I think, that were sent out to people, including me. And I thought this was cool. Almost like an artist maybe that's a portrait of the artist in the gallery. A one of one sent out again to Kels and into the physical work. Finally. Look at this. Zoe Kim.
01:07:01.610 - 01:07:21.258, Speaker A: Look at how radical this is. See that? So here it is a little bit further back. Dream dog. I'm not exactly sure on how this is made because this looks three dimensional. This looks like a sticker on top. A wild work here. Look at even the mouth on the dog.
01:07:21.258 - 01:07:34.162, Speaker A: That circle there. Very interesting. Albion works. Nice. Nice ink drawings here. So hoping for snow this weekend. Here's some snow drawings from the archive.
01:07:34.162 - 01:07:53.240, Speaker A: Just gorgeous. Beautiful use of negative space, isn't it? So brilliant there. Of course, we saw this small yesterday. Adam Lister studio. So there's the superman. And you see the artist working here on the piece manually, which I thought was pretty interesting. Bondozo Bandido, who we've been looking at.
01:07:53.240 - 01:08:23.180, Speaker A: Look at these retro cell phones on the side and maybe some sort of wrestler, you know, as far as capturing the zeitgeist, Bondozo is doing a really good job. Like, I feel like Bondozo would fit very well on tezos with the choice of subject matter, don't you think? Really nicely executed here as well. This kind of airbrush painting. A little bit of a splash there with these backgrounds that are painted. Just a really smart contrast. Here's another one. Poodle me softly with this song.
01:08:23.180 - 01:08:43.868, Speaker A: And again, very bold, bold, bold experimentation. Super prolific, as far as I can tell. Bondozo is releasing a huge amount of work. Here's Babici Metilla, who we've also been looking at. Look at this car. Wild works here. I'm seeing on Instagram here, so I'm glad to see it, to be honest.
01:08:43.868 - 01:09:00.896, Speaker A: You know, like, it's nice to see a physical painting. It seems to be going somewhere. Like, I feel like a new generation is coming of age here. And I don't remember seeing this a year ago. Maybe it was out there and I just didn't know about it, but I don't remember seeing so much interesting work. Groovy gnome. Another one.
01:09:00.896 - 01:09:15.128, Speaker A: This is a super interesting artist. Logi. It's official. Look at these works here. Yeah, this is part of a larger show. This is also a super cool artist we've been looking at that looks like they make textured works. Kind of sewing in these flowers here.
01:09:15.128 - 01:09:30.233, Speaker A: And there is the signature super cool work there. And that, my friends, is your show. Hopefully see you tomorrow on the mech TXT as well as the whole team there doing the loving type exhibition. Thank you for joining me. Until next time. Take care.
