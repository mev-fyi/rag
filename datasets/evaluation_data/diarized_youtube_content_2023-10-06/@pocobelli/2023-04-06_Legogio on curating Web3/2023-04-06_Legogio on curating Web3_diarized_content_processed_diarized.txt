00:00:04.320 - 00:00:52.044, Speaker A: Today we continue our discussion on collecting and curating on web3, this time with a new voice on the show, Legojo Seven, who has curated several new voices on a curated world on foundation. He said he's going to be a few minutes late, but we are proceeding on schedule and there's already a few wonderful people entering the room and we will have no problem filling the time here. Artist Journal, April 5, 2023. Broadcasting live from Livorno in Tuscany and New York City on rug radio via Twitter spaces. My name is Adrian Pokebelly, and we welcome back co host, artist and conversationalist to the show, Roon Toon. Roon, how are you doing?
00:00:53.364 - 00:00:56.372, Speaker B: I am doing great. I always love your intros.
00:00:56.468 - 00:01:07.724, Speaker A: Well, I was a huge art bell fan and talk radio in general back in the day, and yeah, it was all about the big build up there. So yeah, I just can't help myself.
00:01:07.844 - 00:01:10.348, Speaker B: Keeping the art radio traditionalized.
00:01:10.396 - 00:01:26.646, Speaker A: It's a weird mix, isn't it? Nft art mixed with late night talk radio. A surrealist experiment in itself. And I see wonderful people. Burka Byram here. Martin Joe doctor version. Just welcome. And Luke 500 and Chimasuku Jackson.
00:01:26.646 - 00:01:32.478, Speaker A: This is wonderful. So, Ruhn, how is your week going as we wait for Lego Joe to take the stage?
00:01:32.646 - 00:01:38.550, Speaker B: Well, so my girlfriend, she went upstate with a friend this week, so trying.
00:01:38.582 - 00:01:40.126, Speaker A: To keep things in control over here.
00:01:40.150 - 00:01:49.854, Speaker B: They got a little bit hedonistic, a little too fast for me. But I'm back to work. My weekend is Sunday, Monday, so I'm keeping things in control.
00:01:49.934 - 00:01:52.404, Speaker A: I was gonna say party time. Oh, yeah.
00:01:52.444 - 00:01:52.972, Speaker B: Boys night.
00:01:53.028 - 00:02:06.756, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. So that's good. So are you able to make any art these days, or are you? I mean, I'd find it pretty difficult in New York, to be honest, to make art just with so much going on. But how are you doing on that side of things? It can be pretty difficult to make.
00:02:06.780 - 00:02:21.074, Speaker B: Some art, I think. Once the warm weather starts to spark up in New York, the social life kind of takes over for a lot of people. So I feel like my art making is definitely winter oriented. How's Italy? Did you go to any museums?
00:02:21.114 - 00:02:58.652, Speaker A: What's your experience been like over in Tuscany here? You know, it's kind of funny. I used to be obsessed with going to museums, and maybe it's just a function of Livorno not having much in terms of museums. Like, my girlfriend and her son went over to Pisa today, and they were going to go up the tower. I've already been there, but I kind of want to go, but I don't want to be rushed going back and forth. I could have done it from a cafe in Pisa, but you, you know, then all of a sudden, you're talking too loud in the cafe and all that sort of thing. So I thought maybe I'll stay back. But all to say, you know, I spend so much time doing art these days in terms of either talking about it, making it, you know, spending time indoors.
00:02:58.652 - 00:03:42.222, Speaker A: And exactly to your point, on the spring, I'm so happy to get outside that I'm just happy to kind of walk around some quiet town in Tuscany here or city, I should say. I mean, yesterday we went to Florence and let me tell you, that was like, so busy, I couldn't believe it. Like, I've been to Florence in August and it was crazy and it was, it reminded me of that, like, you know, people are traveling and it was just absolutely full. We would have went to the uffizi, actually, it was on Monday, but the, the uffizi was closed on Mondays, which I basically already knew before going. But I was just happy to, you know, as I was saying, just walk around a little bit, get some fresh air, get out of the apartment, you know. Yeah.
00:03:42.278 - 00:03:46.358, Speaker B: Sometimes it's almost equally as thrilling just to be in a new place.
00:03:46.526 - 00:04:14.226, Speaker A: Absolutely. And I see Legojo seven. And I hope I'm pronouncing your name right. I just invited you up to speak, Lego Joe, so I'm thrilled that you're here. We are excited to talk about what you're working on. And hey, to everybody who is here, if you want to join the conversation, just put a request to speak and we'll happily bring you up. Otherwise I may prank you during the show with a invitation to speak just to get things going here.
00:04:14.226 - 00:04:27.450, Speaker A: So, Legojo, I have sent you an invite to speak. And there Legojo is. Legojo, welcome to the show. Yo. How are you doing? Well, where are you calling from, Lego Joe?
00:04:27.522 - 00:04:30.274, Speaker C: I'm calling from Montreal, Quebec, Canada.
00:04:30.394 - 00:04:41.732, Speaker A: Is that right? Yeah. I used to live in Montreal for about seven years. That was a while ago, from about 2004 to maybe 2011. And so how's Montreal these days?
00:04:41.868 - 00:04:49.244, Speaker C: It's good, to be honest. I'm actually, I'm walking the streets right now, talking about getting fresh air.
00:04:49.364 - 00:05:01.980, Speaker A: We can hear the fresh air there. So tell us a little bit about your story, if you could, I think. Was I in a bidding war with you once for a hasdrubal waffle? Was that you? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. I knew I knew your name.
00:05:02.052 - 00:05:03.064, Speaker B: That's awesome.
00:05:03.584 - 00:05:03.984, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:05:04.024 - 00:05:09.376, Speaker C: Oh, my God. Yeah, I remember that, to be honest. That's one of my favorite has juba.
00:05:09.400 - 00:05:10.400, Speaker B: Pieces of all time.
00:05:10.512 - 00:05:12.488, Speaker A: Me as well. That's why.
00:05:12.536 - 00:05:13.696, Speaker B: Which piece was this?
00:05:13.840 - 00:05:34.828, Speaker A: Maybe. I wonder if we can find it here. I'll try and find it, but it's a spectacular work. It's in my other wallet that I use for bidding, which isn't very secretive. And let me see if I can find it here. So tell us about your story. When did you get started? Started with art and when did you get into the digital thing and was at the same time.
00:05:34.916 - 00:05:51.028, Speaker C: So basically I'm 17, I'm from Montreal. I started like really getting into art because of my uncle, who's been an artist for like, I think like 30 years around. So he would always like, take me out to galleries and stuff like that.
00:05:51.156 - 00:06:15.550, Speaker A: So you're very young, I mean, and to your credit, like, I mean, you really, you know, I mean, I guess I would say that, wouldn't I, if we were bidding on the same work? But you really have an eye because his drubble waffle is a tricky kind of artist. It took me months, let's put it that way, to understand and. Yeah, so anyway. But it sounds like you were kind of exposed to art from a pretty early age is what you're saying.
00:06:15.622 - 00:06:59.214, Speaker C: Yeah, I was exposed to galleries and stuff like that. And then I found out about pesos during like the COVID quarantine time. Basically I got a laptop for Christmas that led to think YouTube, about stocks, from stocks, crypto, from crypto, nfts. And then from nfts I found out about a digital art from someone. I don't know if anyone's here, heard the name. The warden started a project, the world Star bed spunks. I used to write articles for him and he put me onto Tezos because he would pay me for articles in Tezos and he would send me art nfts.
00:06:59.214 - 00:07:00.954, Speaker C: That's how I found out about it.
00:07:01.034 - 00:07:11.866, Speaker A: That is pretty impressive. I mean, you're 17, just to confirm. And here you are writing articles already. I mean, you're barely legal to work. Am I pronouncing your name right? Legojo.
00:07:12.010 - 00:07:15.018, Speaker C: Yeah, Lego Geo. Lego Geo. It's box.
00:07:15.106 - 00:07:20.188, Speaker A: I kind of like Lego Geo. Yeah, I was wondering about that. So do you have a preference?
00:07:20.346 - 00:07:22.176, Speaker C: Nah, nah, whatever. Whatever you prefer.
00:07:22.240 - 00:07:46.972, Speaker A: Maybe I'll call you Lego Geo then. So anyways, okay, so very good. And when did you start collecting on Tezos? Then? And then we'll get to your more recent work here. You know, when young people, when they go so far, so early, you just feel like, where's this guy gonna be when he's 30 years old? I mean, I think I'm way more than double your age here, which is pretty amazing. But anyway, so how'd you get started? Like, when did you start on Tasos? Did you have an aha moment?
00:07:47.088 - 00:08:15.154, Speaker C: Well, I remember. Cause at first, all I knew of NFTs were, like, the stuff you see on the news, like bored ape, and was kind of like, PFP projects, stuff like that. And I remember one time I wrote an article and he paid me. I can't remember the artist, but it's someone from, I think, Indonesia. And it was like an amazing piece of, like, I think, like a done in blender. And when I saw that, I was like, I didn't even know what it was. Like 20 editions.
00:08:15.154 - 00:08:42.118, Speaker C: Like, who. Who made this stuff like that? So I started looking into it. He would show me artists. And it was something like, I've never seen, like, anything like this before. Like, I've been to, like, the galleries and stuff, but I never knew, like, how many artists are creating and selling. I didn't know that there was even, like, some of these, like, formats for digital works. And actually, the first ever piece that I collected, like, with my own tezos, it was probably like, two years ago.
00:08:42.118 - 00:08:44.634, Speaker C: It was a one bit necro piece.
00:08:45.414 - 00:08:55.274, Speaker A: Oh, wow. Also a very advanced artist, in my opinion. Like, I was very slow to understand a one bit necro. I mean, you've. You've got the instinct. Lego.
00:08:57.094 - 00:09:07.142, Speaker C: I don't know about that. I don't know. It's just. I don't know if I like something, I feel like I know I like it. If I don't, I try and look into it more. If I still don't like it, then it's just not for me, but.
00:09:07.318 - 00:09:12.046, Speaker A: So you picked up a one bit necro. And what was it about the one bit necro that turned your head?
00:09:12.150 - 00:09:31.574, Speaker C: Probably just a black and white. It was a black and white piece. And the pixel style, I don't know, it was just like. Like, to me, I've never seen. I've never seen it before. It was the first time I've seen, like, a piece of pixel art like that. And also, I mean, to be honest, I wasn't getting paid crazy amounts, but it was on tezos, and it's cheap, so.
00:09:31.574 - 00:09:32.382, Speaker C: You know what I mean?
00:09:32.478 - 00:09:52.174, Speaker A: Absolutely. I mean, I think. I mean, did you ever see yourself as an art collector before, kazos? Because I sure didn't see myself as collecting art. And I kind of went crazy for about a year. How about yourself? I mean, was it simply just a matter of, was it the value in a sense? Or, like, were you a collector beforehand of, you know, comics and stuff?
00:09:52.254 - 00:10:03.282, Speaker C: Yeah, I've collected coins before, Pokemon cards, but everything I've collected in the past, it's kind of like, like died down. Like I fell out of passion or love with it.
00:10:03.358 - 00:10:13.386, Speaker B: So besides the NFT that your friend would give you in the beginning, where was it that you first started collecting? Which chain or which platform kind of pulled you in?
00:10:13.490 - 00:10:30.332, Speaker C: Well, actually, to NFTs in general, Solana, I found, I was on YouTube during quarantine trying to make money, and I found Solana FPS old profit Jiffy, to be honest, I was like, I was trying to make money, and it was just like a waste of time. And then I found Tezos through the warden.
00:10:30.428 - 00:10:34.372, Speaker B: Is the warden. Is that like a, is that like a Twitter profile? Is that a personality?
00:10:34.428 - 00:10:46.668, Speaker C: He's pretty like OG to Tezos. I don't think many people know of him because kind of had to, like, slow down with the projects he was working on and go back to work. But if you search up, I think, WSB punks, you'll find this profile.
00:10:46.796 - 00:10:52.700, Speaker A: So tell us a little bit about your foundation world. So is this your first attempt at curation?
00:10:52.812 - 00:11:03.284, Speaker C: Yeah, this is my, my first try at something like this. It's crazy because literally, like, a week before foundation, like, announced the world's feature.
00:11:03.664 - 00:11:05.168, Speaker A: I remember that. Montreal win.
00:11:05.216 - 00:11:05.416, Speaker D: Sorry.
00:11:05.440 - 00:11:09.160, Speaker A: If you can cover your mic a little bit from the wind. Perfect.
00:11:09.232 - 00:11:09.600, Speaker D: Perfect.
00:11:09.672 - 00:11:10.440, Speaker E: Thank you.
00:11:10.592 - 00:11:55.154, Speaker C: So we were coming back from a gallery, and I started, like, we started talking about how, like, how do the owners of the gallery make money? And he told me that basically the artist, like, artists sign a contract with the gallery and they have to remain exclusive, and the gallery gets 50%. And to me, like, that was crazy, to be honest. Like, 50% going to the gallery. I told my uncle, I was like, if I had a gallery, I'd put the fee at 10%, no contract, no exclusivity. And it'd be like, all my favorite artists. And then I think, like, next week or, yeah, around next week, I saw foundation worlds, started looking into it, and I realized I could do exactly that. I put a 10% fee and no exclusivity.
00:11:55.154 - 00:12:22.486, Speaker C: And, yeah, I got together 50 of my personal favorite artists from all around the world using mediums from, like, plasticine to digital painting, digital illustration, blender work, pixel art, and everyone minted a piece and all the pieces got put up for auction in the foundation world, which kind of serves like a digital gallery type of thing. And, yeah, I'm really happy with how it went.
00:12:22.550 - 00:12:24.934, Speaker B: Have you showed the gallery to your uncle?
00:12:25.094 - 00:12:30.174, Speaker C: Yeah, I showed it to him, and he said he's proud and stuff like that.
00:12:30.294 - 00:12:57.080, Speaker A: Yeah. One of the things I'm really curious about is, are these, in a sense, your favorite artists right now? Because, like, for me, that's how I would feel in the sense of, like, me, say, putting that show together. I'd much rather talk about these new artists that nobody's really discovered other than, you know, a few hundred people here on Tazos, maybe a few thousand, than talking about, you know, Gerhard Richter or whomever. Like, do you get that sense? Like, in a sense, are your kind of favorite artists up in this world?
00:12:57.232 - 00:13:14.612, Speaker C: Yeah, 100%. That was, like, my thought process going in. Like, I don't care if they're on foundation or not. I don't care if they're. If they're selling on foundation, if they're selling on object. I don't care. Whoever my favorite artists are, you know what? Let me ask them if they'd like to be a part of it, and whoever's interested, you know, join us.
00:13:14.748 - 00:14:06.752, Speaker A: Yeah. That is the impression I got. Now, an interesting thing, and I don't know if you know this, and correct me if anybody, if we're in tune, or if you, Legocho, have other information, but my impression, as far as exclusivity is concerned, say, in the traditional art world, is it goes according to city. So if I make a deal with you, you know, a gallery in Boston, I have to work with. That gallery, generally, is how it works, unless I'm a huge artist, in which case I don't need to make that exclusive deal, and they're just happy to have my work. But if you're just sort of like a regular artist and you're getting a deal, my impression is it's the city itself where you're exclusive. But then you can go to a different city, like San Francisco or Beirut or whatever, and you can make another deal there, and you're not stopped unless you have kind of an unusual contract.
00:14:06.752 - 00:14:13.872, Speaker A: Do you have that understanding? Because I didn't actually learn that until a few years ago, like three or four years ago. So is that your understanding, Lego?
00:14:13.968 - 00:14:21.864, Speaker C: Yeah, now that I think about it, I think my uncle said something like that. Am I wrong? But, like, in the city, you could only be in one gallery. It's more like that.
00:14:22.024 - 00:14:50.678, Speaker A: Yeah, like, that's what I would call typical. A typical thing. Unless you're, like, already a hugely famous artist, but even then, you'd still kind of have your. Your exclusive agents that might represent you, say, in Europe and Asia, even that sort of thing, and then you work with those people. But generally speaking, if you're kind of working your way up as an artist. Yeah, that is my impression. And the reason I share it is because, you know, I didn't really learn that until recently and maybe might be news to other people out there.
00:14:50.678 - 00:14:52.518, Speaker A: Runtoon. Is that your impression?
00:14:52.646 - 00:15:01.562, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. That was kind of one of the discoveries, you know, maybe five to ten years ago, that I had that kind of further killed my art dreams.
00:15:01.738 - 00:15:19.506, Speaker A: I found it kind of exciting, to be honest, as an artist, because I thought, oh, wow, like, here you could have, like, 30 different galleries in theory, you know, working for you and, you know, could you even make enough art? You know, if you have, like, 100 galleries, you know, like, I think it's, you know, it's.
00:15:19.570 - 00:16:00.974, Speaker B: It's even beyond just, you know, city to city and gallery to gallery. A lot of times a gallery, depending on the artist you are, will make different decisions about the contract that they have with you. Like, for instance, let's say you're like a landscape painter and you are working with a gallery in the midwest. They might not want you to do anything and you might be kind of locked into working with them for several years unless you somehow had the money to buy out your own contract. At least that was the perspective described to me from someone who was exactly that, like a landscape painter, I think, in Wyoming. And they were working with some gallery in Jackson Hole.
00:16:01.134 - 00:16:13.230, Speaker A: Right. In a sense, they couldn't work outside. Like, their contract was sort of more like a. Much larger than a city. Correct. Gotcha. So, Lagojo, I'm going to go back between Lego and Lagocho, I think.
00:16:13.230 - 00:16:42.180, Speaker A: So tell me, doing this then, does it make you want to curate more or does it make you want to start a gallery? Like, now that you've had what sounds like a pretty positive experience? And again, I think your gallery looks great. And I'm actually curious to actually hear about that, you know, going from zero to, I guess, zero to one here from, you know, thinking about wanting to do it to actually creating it and how challenging it was. But before we go there, like, does this make you want to open a gallery or just keep doing more worlds?
00:16:42.332 - 00:17:01.492, Speaker C: Worlds? 100%. I feel like it's already gone great, but I feel like I could take it further. Using worlds to like, showcase this art to more people and galleries. I don't know, because I feel like, you know, there's for sure more cost with a gallery. You have to keep the, you have to pay the rent and stuff like that. So.
00:17:01.628 - 00:17:22.552, Speaker A: Totally. It's a whole other order of commitment here. Whereas now you can basically, once you've basically put the artists together, you've done whatever you need to do on foundations. And maybe you could talk a little bit about that. Like, how complicated was it for you to set up? It's probably just going through a little menu, I assume. And then you invite the artists, you add the wallet. Is it that simple?
00:17:22.688 - 00:17:27.144, Speaker C: Yeah, I'll kind of go through, like, my process just. Just to show, like, how, how easy it was.
00:17:27.184 - 00:17:28.328, Speaker A: So that would be great.
00:17:28.456 - 00:17:58.338, Speaker C: If you're listening right now, you have artists that you think would be interested. You like their work and you want to show it to more people, you could do it. All you have to do, put a list together, get all the artists together. I used a google spreadsheet to track everything. Then I put together Google Doc with, like, basic info, like dates, a bit about the goal, stuff like that. I sent Google Doc with a message as an invitation to all the artists that I wanted to work with. Then I tracked who accepted, who would get back to me, stuff like that.
00:17:58.338 - 00:18:31.650, Speaker C: Added everyone to a group chat. I made sure whoever, like, has never minted on foundation who it was their genesis. If they needed gas fees, I send it to them, confirmed with people who either said that they get back to me, stuff like that. Then to actually create the world, you go on foundation, you do. I think it's create the same way you create a collection, you do create and then world, you put in the addresses or the names of the artists that you'd like to add to the world. You create the name, your curator fee, then you create. And then I think from there you can change, like the profile picture for the world and stuff like that.
00:18:31.722 - 00:18:46.452, Speaker A: That is beautiful. A step by step guide from Legojo. And I love how you even use the Excel worksheet. And what was your goal? I love how you wrote a goal, like, again, for 17 years old. It's pretty impressive what you've done here.
00:18:46.548 - 00:18:58.744, Speaker C: Well, pretty much like, I feel like right now a lot of the artists that are selling through NFTs, kind of like you're doing it alone, right? Like you mint, you put out a tweet and, you know, you hope it sells.
00:18:59.284 - 00:19:02.708, Speaker A: That's exactly. You hope for the best and. Sorry, continue. Yeah.
00:19:02.756 - 00:19:27.120, Speaker C: So I feel like, if I were to get, you know, 50 artists together and put all their work in a kind of digital gallery, do some work promoting it, and everyone who's a part is also showing and supporting each other, you have, like, I don't have a number, but you have a lot more visibility than if you're just minting it and doing the tweeting by yourself. So the goal is just as many eyes as possible, because I feel like a lot of these artists, maybe even.
00:19:27.152 - 00:19:29.192, Speaker A: You in group chat, like you met.
00:19:29.208 - 00:19:35.766, Speaker C: Some new artists, but I feel like a lot of these people, like, there's no way that everyone was collecting on tezos or on foundation, knows all of them.
00:19:35.790 - 00:19:55.862, Speaker A: So, yeah, again, I love the title of the world that you put together. I found it, like, one of the most compelling, as if, you know, like Tashin or feed on would have, you know, put out this thing. Artists of today, I mean, it's. It's a very almost ambitious title. Just curious when you're reaching out to people and don't name names. But did anybody say no?
00:19:55.958 - 00:20:18.434, Speaker C: Yeah, a couple people said no. A couple people said that they'd be interested, but they had stuff going on or other projects. And then some people opened it and didn't respond, you know, which it's expected, you know, if you want to start a world, you have to ask. And obviously not everyone would be interested in taking part, but, you know, you have to shoot your shot and, you know, see who would like to take part.
00:20:18.554 - 00:20:24.842, Speaker A: Absolutely. And so as far as, you know, conversion or success rate, then, was it like 50% or.
00:20:24.978 - 00:20:28.004, Speaker C: It was like, almost exactly 50%. Yeah. Yeah.
00:20:28.304 - 00:20:51.728, Speaker A: Wow. That is interesting. I almost like, I wonder to myself in my head what that would look like if you had, like, 100% conversion. That probably would have been unbelievable. Anyway, very interesting. So if anybody wants to join us on stage or has a question for Legojo or just comment in general on our topic here, feel free to request to speak, and I will bring you on stage. Rune tune.
00:20:51.728 - 00:20:54.376, Speaker A: Do you have any questions for Lego?
00:20:54.480 - 00:20:59.136, Speaker B: Is there, like, any kind of dream that you're trying to pursue in doing all this?
00:20:59.160 - 00:21:00.664, Speaker C: Or, like, do you see this, like.
00:21:00.784 - 00:21:03.768, Speaker B: Going somewhere exciting that. That you'd like to talk about?
00:21:03.856 - 00:21:15.720, Speaker C: Well, I'd say for sure in the future. I love art, and I don't think that's ever going to change. And if I can make a bit of money showing work by artists who I love to more people, that's 100% something I want to keep doing in the future.
00:21:15.832 - 00:21:21.464, Speaker A: Do you see this as the future of curation. And do you even see it as curating Lagocho?
00:21:22.044 - 00:21:48.764, Speaker C: I don't know. For this world, I gave everyone full, like artistic control or no topics or themes or anything like that. So to call it curation, I don't know. I did get everyone together, but I didn't really. There were no topics, themes, anything like that. So for this world, I'm not sure. But I think that like this is for sure like an option that should be looked at and taken seriously for curation in the future because there's for sure, like advantages over like additional galleries.
00:21:48.804 - 00:21:49.684, Speaker E: And stuff like that.
00:21:49.804 - 00:22:08.236, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. And I feel like you did a good job, though, again, of unifying it with your title because you basically took a bunch of different artists that might not have much to do with each other other than the fact that they are coming out now. They're kind of somewhat undiscovered. And you're putting them all together and saying this is now.
00:22:08.380 - 00:22:09.540, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly.
00:22:09.652 - 00:22:14.912, Speaker B: Would you ever consider bringing like what you have curated to like a physical gallery?
00:22:15.028 - 00:22:41.468, Speaker C: Yeah, I wanted to do like for this world, I wanted to do stuff like have projections in the streets and I wanted to have big weak paced posters of. But I didn't have time. But for sure, in future. In future, like worlds, I want to merge it more with the physical world and putting this art in front of people who might not be on Twitter, who might not be on foundation collecting nfts already but who enjoy and appreciate art and my like to collect it.
00:22:41.556 - 00:22:55.628, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I feel like there's a few people in the space already who are kind of pushing digital art into physical spaces. I mean, she, Mosku Jackson, who's listening right now, is one of those people that could be an interesting avenue to explore.
00:22:55.756 - 00:23:04.452, Speaker C: Yeah, I think. I don't know if it's the name, but I think like super chief gallery or something like that. I think they did projections in, well, like France. Was it France?
00:23:04.628 - 00:23:10.160, Speaker A: I think so. And yeah, they've been around because I think they're at NFT Paris, if I'm not mistaken.
00:23:10.272 - 00:23:12.016, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:23:12.040 - 00:23:45.024, Speaker A: I think they're in Korea. They're all over the place at the World Trade Center, I think, in New York. Yeah. They seem to be one of the most ambitious groups out there who are really trying to, you know, make a name for themselves in this space is, I guess, with this kind of IRL solution of sorts. And it looks like they use tvs, they use projectors, they use, I think they had that cube, you remember, that's in the middle that was showing that Joa in work that I think I've seen a few times on Twitter a couple of months ago. So, yeah. Has anybody reached out to you, Lego Joe, about what you've done?
00:23:45.724 - 00:23:47.104, Speaker C: Not to be honest.
00:23:49.084 - 00:23:59.196, Speaker A: Well, we have Lego, and I'm totally impressed over here with what you've done. So how many of these do you think you're going to put out in the future? Or have you thought that far?
00:23:59.340 - 00:24:12.382, Speaker C: As far as a number, I'm not sure. But before I even, like, start working on the next world, I want to get all the pieces in this one sold. So before that's done, like, I'm not putting too much thought or effort into future worlds.
00:24:12.438 - 00:24:51.308, Speaker A: That's very cool. And that's one of the big benefits of actually having these worlds, is you have an incentive here and welcome Chi Mosu Jackson to the stage. You have an incentive to make a sale because you get a commission and, you know, you want the artist to sell. I mean, my only reservation with the worlds, from a curatorial point of view is it kind of makes me sad that they disappear once they're sold, because then the kind of whatever narrative you might be crafting is all of a sudden gets disturbed and all of a sudden is incomplete because the work disappears when it sells. Do you have any thoughts on that, Lego Joe, before we go to cheap?
00:24:51.436 - 00:25:09.456, Speaker C: Yeah, I know for most worlds it's like that, but I think I did something where all the pieces got put on a homepage for the world. So I think if you go on the world and you click home, all the pieces should be there on the listings. I know they disappear for sure, but I think if you go on the home section, all the pieces stay very interesting.
00:25:09.520 - 00:25:15.444, Speaker A: So maybe they have sorted this out. Chi, welcome to the stage. It's thrilling to see you again.
00:25:15.744 - 00:25:17.524, Speaker D: Hey, how's it going, guys?
00:25:17.864 - 00:25:20.522, Speaker A: Awesome. How are things in Seattle?
00:25:20.648 - 00:25:27.566, Speaker D: Oh, man, Seattle is great. Spring is here finally, and the rain has held off for a few weeks.
00:25:27.630 - 00:25:30.302, Speaker E: So we're all loving it out here.
00:25:30.358 - 00:25:48.976, Speaker A: That's good to hear. And so tell us, what's new with you? I mean, I haven't seen a ton of you on Twitter, so it's. Again, it's great to see you. I don't know, maybe you've been there and I just have a tunnel on Twitter here. But tell us what's new. I mean, you put together that great show in January, which sounded like it went really, really well. What's next? What are you up to?
00:25:49.080 - 00:26:35.320, Speaker D: Yeah, man, you know, I'm always busy here. We do shows every month, so, you know, I'm always going in between the digital art and the traditional art. So we are having a new show actually coming up here tomorrow by a cool artist. She does very much like gender identity mythology, and it's about women empowerment a little bit, but it has a very contemporary twist on it. So she's very trending a little bit, you know, and a very nice color palette. So, yeah, doing that. But I also am in talks and hopefully the show goes through with the Seattle NFT museum trying to have a co hosted show, hopefully at the end of the month.
00:26:35.320 - 00:26:51.422, Speaker D: So that's fingers crossed that goes through, and if that goes through, that will be a good bridging of the Ethereum artists and the Tezo artists, in my opinion. I mostly do tezos, but they are exclusively Ethereum right now, so interesting.
00:26:51.598 - 00:26:54.078, Speaker A: And so would you curate that then?
00:26:54.166 - 00:27:01.062, Speaker D: Yeah, so I would be curating a set of Tezos artists and they would be curating the Ethereum artists.
00:27:01.118 - 00:27:06.710, Speaker E: But the kicker, and this is the most important interesting part for me, is.
00:27:06.822 - 00:27:09.798, Speaker D: They don't actually own the work that they're showing.
00:27:09.886 - 00:27:13.118, Speaker E: So they can't make a digital space.
00:27:13.206 - 00:27:21.610, Speaker D: Like on cyber or something like that because they're just using a JPeg that they are just saving, clicking like xcopy.
00:27:21.642 - 00:27:27.282, Speaker E: You know, so it's a little bit different than what I'm doing.
00:27:27.378 - 00:27:34.346, Speaker D: So it's an interesting fact that I think what we're, without going too far, I think that we're talking about possibly.
00:27:34.410 - 00:27:38.450, Speaker E: Having a virtual space with Tezos artists.
00:27:38.602 - 00:27:41.698, Speaker D: And possibly having VR headsets within their.
00:27:41.746 - 00:27:45.398, Speaker E: Gallery in the museum downtown in Belltown.
00:27:45.446 - 00:27:49.310, Speaker D: So it's almost like a meta gallery in a gallery without. Without going too far.
00:27:49.382 - 00:27:50.574, Speaker B: That's super cool.
00:27:50.694 - 00:27:51.110, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:27:51.182 - 00:27:58.302, Speaker D: But to get onto Lego, I just think that it's great what he's doing because, you know, it really talks to.
00:27:58.318 - 00:28:00.566, Speaker E: The promise of this space, you know.
00:28:00.590 - 00:28:03.954, Speaker D: Because here's someone who has an idea.
00:28:04.334 - 00:28:10.486, Speaker E: And they can just put it together without barrier. And, you know, coming from like, when.
00:28:10.510 - 00:28:15.944, Speaker D: I was a kid, you know, I also, when I was in high school, I wanted to do art shows and stuff.
00:28:15.984 - 00:28:19.048, Speaker E: And, you know, I just basically, without.
00:28:19.096 - 00:28:23.416, Speaker D: Going into a long, detailed story here, my father was a manager at an.
00:28:23.440 - 00:28:25.656, Speaker E: Apartment building, and so there would be.
00:28:25.680 - 00:28:28.544, Speaker D: Empty apartments every once in a while, and I would take one of those.
00:28:28.584 - 00:28:29.960, Speaker E: For a night, and we would just.
00:28:29.992 - 00:28:31.208, Speaker D: Fill, we would just hang art in.
00:28:31.216 - 00:28:35.552, Speaker E: The empty apartment, our empty apartments in the building for one night.
00:28:35.728 - 00:28:39.002, Speaker D: So it was kind of like using the resources that you had.
00:28:39.168 - 00:28:54.790, Speaker E: But it was like, here you can get artists that are top notch, not just your peers, put it for the world to see and make a commission on it, which is, like, mind blowing.
00:28:54.902 - 00:28:57.694, Speaker D: Without even putting more than Gatsby money in.
00:28:57.734 - 00:28:58.782, Speaker E: It's a beautiful thing.
00:28:58.918 - 00:29:35.126, Speaker A: I couldn't agree more. I mean, it kind of. It bypasses this whole model that you need to apply for a grant from some government body if you're a curator, because, you know, I don't know if any curators that are used to taking a cut out of the art, but it makes. It's kind of like, I think I mentioned this on a show once, it's kind of like the sales model where it's like, you get a commission on your sales, you know, sure, you can come sell my product and yeah, you get your 1015, 20% commission, whatever the case might be. And it sounds great, right? Like, I mean, have you thought of doing your own world, chief?
00:29:35.270 - 00:29:47.534, Speaker D: You know, I haven't. I only collect a small amount of Ethereum artwork. It's actually grown since the birth of a manifold. That really made it a lot easier.
00:29:47.574 - 00:29:50.394, Speaker E: With the open editions for me to.
00:29:50.734 - 00:30:05.210, Speaker D: Get into that market. But before, I had only purchased a small amount of what I would consider gems, and affordable gems for me because, you know, I'm already doing a lot. So I never really was early enough.
00:30:05.242 - 00:30:08.210, Speaker E: To get any of the, you know, cheaper things.
00:30:08.322 - 00:30:11.794, Speaker D: But I do have, you know, my Ethereum pieces that I do own are.
00:30:11.874 - 00:30:13.018, Speaker E: Precious to me, and.
00:30:13.146 - 00:30:16.658, Speaker D: And I do enjoy them, but I know I haven't done a foundation world, but it's.
00:30:16.706 - 00:30:18.426, Speaker E: I'm interested, actually.
00:30:18.570 - 00:30:25.802, Speaker D: I do like tezos. I do think there's something to tezos because I don't want to. For me anyway, I don't want to.
00:30:25.818 - 00:30:27.056, Speaker E: Get to spread out.
00:30:27.120 - 00:30:37.724, Speaker A: I hear you. I hear you, especially when it comes to collecting. But you do realize, like, you don't need to own anything to create the world, right? Like Lego didn't buy all that work and then say, I'm going to sell it.
00:30:38.064 - 00:30:39.256, Speaker E: Correct, correct.
00:30:39.280 - 00:30:39.488, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:30:39.536 - 00:30:54.672, Speaker D: So, yeah, but I am interested 100%. And another thing which is interesting is his model, I think, and it's very comparative to my model in IRl, is, you know, taking the greed out of.
00:30:54.688 - 00:31:01.124, Speaker E: This space, I think. And that's what put me off as an artist at first.
00:31:01.464 - 00:31:05.832, Speaker D: Beyond the gatekeeping is the greed that's in there. I mean, and it's obviously they need.
00:31:05.848 - 00:31:11.008, Speaker E: To pay their rent, and I understand that. But coming from an artist standpoint, when.
00:31:11.016 - 00:31:12.320, Speaker D: I was in art school, all the.
00:31:12.352 - 00:31:14.328, Speaker E: Painters and some of, some of the.
00:31:14.336 - 00:31:20.138, Speaker D: Other artists, but I was with painters, so I can only relate to the painters as much. But all the painters, we never were.
00:31:20.186 - 00:31:23.170, Speaker E: Into the curating students because we always.
00:31:23.242 - 00:31:27.994, Speaker D: Felt, hey, these guys are just coming in here. They're just trying to make a couple.
00:31:28.034 - 00:31:30.754, Speaker E: Bucks off of us, you know, and.
00:31:30.794 - 00:31:35.154, Speaker D: Make all these connections while they're in school. And then, you know, then they've made.
00:31:35.194 - 00:31:41.066, Speaker E: Their buck and then they're on to the next artist where we're just all, this is our life, you know?
00:31:41.170 - 00:31:43.386, Speaker D: So I think his model of only.
00:31:43.490 - 00:31:53.714, Speaker E: Charging, you know, like 1015 percent was, which I do, is very fair and it's, it doesn't put anybody off, doesn't seem greedy.
00:31:53.754 - 00:31:55.714, Speaker D: And I think that's a wonderful thing we'll be doing.
00:31:55.834 - 00:32:38.748, Speaker B: You know, that's, it's so true. I remember getting out of school and having a huge body of work and wanting to show my work in physical galleries and running into that problem so many times. Or it didn't feel like this gallery was here to help me out in any way or approaching them. It was like, oh, it'd be great if I could have a show here. It'd be great to make connections. But then, you know, in practice, meeting someone, talking to someone, every aspect of it felt more like they're just here to try and exploit me for whatever game they could have. But on the other hand, since then, I've, I've met some people who own galleries where they really take the matters of rent and all that stuff into their own hands, and they don't put any of that on the artist.
00:32:38.748 - 00:32:46.294, Speaker B: They don't take a cut from any of the shows, stuff like that. And I'm finding more of that vibe in digital art.
00:32:46.374 - 00:32:49.686, Speaker D: Totally, I totally agree. And, and I don't, I'm not trying.
00:32:49.710 - 00:32:52.502, Speaker E: To put gallery owners, you know, in.
00:32:52.518 - 00:33:15.398, Speaker D: A bad spot because I'm also a gallery owner, so I understand the right aspect. But, you know, it sometimes can go too far and sometimes it's the break that people need. So I don't want to, I'm not trying to shame anybody for that. But I do think it's interesting, the different models that are out there, and sometimes it will force an artist to.
00:33:15.566 - 00:33:20.434, Speaker E: Raise their prices too much too quickly.
00:33:20.854 - 00:33:27.822, Speaker D: And then it's like, okay, that one show was great. I made some commissions, but now I am, my prices are too high.
00:33:27.918 - 00:33:53.024, Speaker A: And the classic is you make the sale and then the gallery doesn't pay you. I mean, that's not an uncommon story out here in Berlin, or definitely not Lego. Do you have any thoughts on this whole commission business? 10%. I agree with chi. 10% seems to be a pretty good, like you said, because there is so much greed in crypto, it's kind of refreshing to see 10%. Any thoughts on that?
00:33:53.104 - 00:34:08.688, Speaker C: I think 100% for worlds, like 1015 percent. I don't really see a reason to go much higher than that. The only fees are, like, gas fees for creating the world. If you're onboarding, like, artists to Ethereum and you want to cover their gas, that was the only fees for me, so.
00:34:08.816 - 00:34:16.768, Speaker A: Right. And that was very cool to offer people to cover their fees. I mean, it shows you're here for the art and the artist, not just to make a buck.
00:34:16.856 - 00:34:30.694, Speaker C: Yes, 100%. And also for the in person galleries. I don't know if any of you guys know this, but is 50%, like, required, like, to pay the rental? What would you guys say is like the minimum for in person galleries?
00:34:30.854 - 00:34:37.278, Speaker A: I would say maybe the minimum is maybe 40, but I think 50 is pretty typical.
00:34:37.446 - 00:34:38.110, Speaker C: Okay.
00:34:38.222 - 00:34:48.566, Speaker A: And I've heard his night is like 80% in Chelsea in New York, because the renters are crazy, but you can charge five times as much. You know, rentune. You probably know a lot about that.
00:34:48.670 - 00:34:59.760, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. In New York, I think it is common for it to be between 60 and 80%. And I think it's probably negotiable, depending on who you are as an artist and what you bring to their gallery. But, yeah, 60% to 80%.
00:34:59.872 - 00:35:05.512, Speaker D: And that's all subjective. The galleries don't necessarily need to charge that.
00:35:05.568 - 00:35:10.328, Speaker E: That is just industry standard where they think that it's okay.
00:35:10.496 - 00:35:14.168, Speaker D: Because I know rent is expensive and.
00:35:14.216 - 00:35:17.296, Speaker E: You are paying people salary and all.
00:35:17.320 - 00:35:30.068, Speaker D: These things, and that's also going into that number. But also basically the way, the reason why they're charging people is because they have a collector base that they are directly targeting.
00:35:30.236 - 00:35:32.844, Speaker E: And so they're being the salesman on that.
00:35:32.964 - 00:35:43.580, Speaker D: And the commission goes, yes, to rent, but also to events, supplies, salaries, all those things. But it is also subjective.
00:35:43.612 - 00:35:46.588, Speaker E: They don't. It could be whatever they want it to be.
00:35:46.716 - 00:35:48.260, Speaker D: There's no reason for it to have.
00:35:48.292 - 00:35:52.788, Speaker E: To be 50% industry stand. It's like, if people were okay with.
00:35:52.876 - 00:35:55.620, Speaker D: Paying that, why would I ever go lower?
00:35:55.812 - 00:35:58.844, Speaker E: But it doesn't keep the artist in mind.
00:35:58.964 - 00:35:59.468, Speaker A: That's true.
00:35:59.516 - 00:36:00.388, Speaker B: I mean, but it is.
00:36:00.436 - 00:36:00.988, Speaker A: It does.
00:36:01.076 - 00:36:12.824, Speaker B: So, like, in, in the Chelsea galleries in New York, for instance, like, I mean, you're going to be getting huge sums of money for any sales. Like they only have serious buyers who go in there.
00:36:12.924 - 00:36:15.164, Speaker D: Yeah, I agree. I agree with that.
00:36:15.664 - 00:36:17.632, Speaker E: But the way that I look at.
00:36:17.648 - 00:36:19.048, Speaker D: It in the way I approach my.
00:36:19.096 - 00:36:42.154, Speaker E: Gallery is that my space is right next to the top tier private gallery, right, literally across the street. So anybody could walk in and purchase a work for whatever price that you want to put on the wall. But the deal is, is that it's.
00:36:42.274 - 00:36:53.642, Speaker D: Primarily the way that those galleries get their funds from their buyers is they have a collector list, like you're saying, and their, their collectors are willing to.
00:36:53.818 - 00:36:54.898, Speaker E: To pay that money.
00:36:54.946 - 00:36:56.450, Speaker D: So it's not really like they're making money.
00:36:56.482 - 00:36:59.546, Speaker E: They're never making money off the street per se.
00:36:59.690 - 00:37:07.190, Speaker D: It's just what their collectors are used to paying. And so that's why they're able to charge 50%.
00:37:07.262 - 00:37:12.238, Speaker E: But the rent really isn't extremely higher across the street.
00:37:12.286 - 00:37:17.574, Speaker D: Like maybe by 2000, $3,000 a month. If you catch my grand, it always.
00:37:17.614 - 00:37:19.606, Speaker A: Comes back to the social proof, doesn't it?
00:37:19.670 - 00:37:26.102, Speaker D: Exactly, exactly. So it's not really the rent per se, it's just the idea.
00:37:26.158 - 00:37:35.654, Speaker E: It's like if you can buy, if you're rich and you can buy a pair of, you can buy a pair of nikes, right? You could even buy a 200 pair.
00:37:35.734 - 00:37:42.686, Speaker D: Dollar pair of nikes. But do you want to be wearing a 200 pair of dikeys or do you want a pair of $1000 Louis Vuittons?
00:37:42.870 - 00:37:59.514, Speaker E: Because it's a classism issue. So the rent is the same, but the people that can afford pieces of work want to spend 20k because it makes them feel like this is better quality.
00:37:59.674 - 00:38:02.534, Speaker D: But in, in reality, sometimes that's not true.
00:38:02.874 - 00:38:12.010, Speaker A: Well, you might need to raise your prices chi before we go to doctor version and then edgeq, how long is your lease there in. Because you're right in downtown Seattle there.
00:38:12.122 - 00:38:21.882, Speaker D: So when I first was offered my space with my, my gallery mate, we were offered a ten year lease. But we just do, we just do year to year.
00:38:21.978 - 00:38:26.602, Speaker A: So do you think you'll be able to maintain the space for a while or, or who knows?
00:38:26.738 - 00:38:30.946, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean I, the way that I always look at it is the.
00:38:30.970 - 00:38:32.450, Speaker D: Only way I'm leaving that space is.
00:38:32.482 - 00:38:33.794, Speaker E: Until I get kicked out.
00:38:33.954 - 00:38:55.024, Speaker A: Okay. Well, I mean, it sounds amazing. If you're across the street from like a top tier gallery, I think the world is your oyster. It sounds like possibilities and potential central. Make sure you, if you ever tweet stuff out, like feel free to message me. I'll at least retweet that, or maybe we'll find you an instagram if I haven't found you yet. Like, I mean, that's.
00:38:55.024 - 00:39:02.724, Speaker A: That's awesome. We got to get you, like, in business quick, uh, before the window closes there, because it sounds like an awesome opportunity.
00:39:03.104 - 00:39:03.480, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:39:03.512 - 00:39:09.552, Speaker D: And I'm. My primary passion right now, yes. Is doing the traditional infrastructure.
00:39:09.688 - 00:39:12.088, Speaker E: Um, but I'm my.
00:39:12.136 - 00:39:14.784, Speaker D: I'm really on board with this digital.
00:39:14.864 - 00:39:19.152, Speaker E: Movement 100%, so I'm just trying to.
00:39:19.168 - 00:39:22.704, Speaker D: Find ways of extending the web on.
00:39:22.744 - 00:39:27.792, Speaker E: That, if you get. And getting people involved any way that I can.
00:39:27.848 - 00:39:30.384, Speaker D: So I think what Lego is doing.
00:39:30.504 - 00:39:33.296, Speaker E: Is the future, and we have to.
00:39:33.320 - 00:39:35.524, Speaker D: Work hand in hand, but I really.
00:39:36.184 - 00:39:42.224, Speaker E: Think that I'm anyway, your passion as well. So I got you super interesting.
00:39:42.264 - 00:39:47.404, Speaker A: Do you have a collector's list that's starting? Like, are you actually getting people buying work in the. In the space?
00:39:48.184 - 00:39:49.328, Speaker E: Yes, we.
00:39:49.376 - 00:39:59.072, Speaker D: We do have a small collector's list that we're. We're putting together, and we have a few people on there, and, you know, it's. There's a lot of ways that it.
00:39:59.088 - 00:40:05.448, Speaker E: Can go, but our model is inclusive, so I'm an artist.
00:40:05.576 - 00:40:07.192, Speaker D: My partner that I run the space.
00:40:07.248 - 00:40:15.670, Speaker E: With is an artist. And we are here for the art, and we are not just here for the sales, and that is our primary objective.
00:40:15.782 - 00:40:16.862, Speaker A: Well, we're gonna have to pay you.
00:40:16.878 - 00:40:21.798, Speaker B: A visit one of these days. I have a sister in Seattle, so I visit Seattle, like, once every other.
00:40:21.846 - 00:40:36.222, Speaker A: Year, so I have a sister in Seattle as well, believe it or not. So we'll all. No way. I'm not joking. She's married to a guy from Microsoft. That is hilarious. It's another excuse to visit Seattle.
00:40:36.222 - 00:40:43.044, Speaker A: I need to see my sister doctor version. You've been waiting patiently here. Do you have anything to add to our conversation? It's great to have you up here.
00:40:43.164 - 00:41:01.940, Speaker F: Hey, Adrian. I appreciate your commitment. You're on vacation and you're doing this. I was wondering what I'd be doing at 930 this Wednesday, but thank you. Nice to see everybody on the subject. I lived in Seattle for a bit and worked at the Seattle Art Museum as a guard. So it's been decades, but love Seattle.
00:41:01.940 - 00:41:45.538, Speaker F: Would love to come out and see the gallery. And let's see. So, royalties, you know, when you first hear about that, like, a gallery, 50%, you know, 60, 70, you're like, oh, my God. But, you know, there's so much involved in being in that position to sell artwork like that. Like, if you're an up and coming artist, they will take a loss on your first sale, and you're selling pains for $15,000 just because of the high stakes of being, you know, positioned as a blue chip gallery or even, you know, mid tier, whatever you want to call, you know, the world. And a lot of these galleries, I think, are funded because they can have tremendous losses and make good money, but they have to find that artist who's going to sell it speaks to, I.
00:41:45.546 - 00:41:57.934, Speaker A: Think, I'm really glad you brought that up. Like, it speaks to how difficult the business of running a gallery is. Like, it's a pretty brutal business as art making can be as well.
00:41:58.234 - 00:42:52.168, Speaker F: Yeah, definitely. But this web3, and we've talked about this before and nfts and blockchain, how a lot of this friction or barriers or entry points, it's just way easier and it's moving quick. And, you know, this story I'm about to tell is, would be very difficult to do on the blockchain, but I'm not going to name any names because it's a big gallery in New York. It's a good friend of mine who quit the art world because he couldn't stand it, got a graduate degree, moved to New York, got a show, a solo show in this gallery, sold out the show, selling paintings for $10,000. He was like, oh, my God, you know, ten paintings. Twelve paintings later, he found out about six to eight months later that the gallery had not sold all of his work. They said it was sold, but then they kept like five or six.
00:42:52.168 - 00:43:25.274, Speaker F: Half of it was sold, but they kept some. And then sold that for instead of $10,000, $40,000 behind his back. And this is the kind of stuff that goes on, I'm sure, all the time, wild. But that's the kind of thing where you, like, he's also didn't have the tough skin and was like, I'm an artist. I don't want to deal with this. But he was positioned to be. He could have gone on, and he has a friend who he went to school with, too, that, that stuck with it and kept it like, this is a business and is doing very well now, but my friend is like, he just couldn't deal with it.
00:43:26.414 - 00:43:32.254, Speaker A: That is a wild story. So did he leave the kind of the art business after that?
00:43:32.294 - 00:43:46.982, Speaker F: Yeah, he still lives in Brooklyn. He lives in New York. He's huge into stereos. And he was an assistant for a long time for an artist, like a pretty big artist. So, you know, he got paid well and. But he just couldn't handle that. And he got burnt out on painting.
00:43:46.982 - 00:44:00.566, Speaker F: And I'm sure the pressure too, you know, it's like you got to keep up. And hey, we got another show in three years. But that's the thing that's so amazing about where we are now. It's like, oh, well, you can have a show together in two months and.
00:44:00.590 - 00:44:01.614, Speaker E: Put it out there.
00:44:01.774 - 00:44:06.794, Speaker F: And Legojo, I forgot how to say your name. I mean, that's. This is the future.
00:44:07.774 - 00:44:23.100, Speaker A: Yeah, it's Lego Geo and Lagojo. He is cool with both. I confirmed at the beginning of the show because I was wondering the same thing myself. What a story doctor version. So just hold on there. I'm going to get to Edgeq. Edgeq has been waiting here as well.
00:44:23.100 - 00:44:25.524, Speaker A: Edgeq, welcome to the show. Where are you calling in from?
00:44:25.644 - 00:44:28.852, Speaker G: Hey, what's up? Can everybody hear me okay?
00:44:29.028 - 00:44:30.340, Speaker A: Yeah, loud and clear.
00:44:30.492 - 00:44:31.060, Speaker C: Perfect.
00:44:31.172 - 00:44:31.372, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:44:31.388 - 00:45:14.378, Speaker G: I'm calling strictly from my warehouse filled with medical cannabis at my job. I'm calling from Puerto Rico shout outs to everybody. I just wanted to hop on here and just praise what Legosho is doing, what she's doing in terms of the work you're doing, joining artists together and straightening bonds, which is really important in this space, I think in various different levels. We all curate our experience here in terms of the people we know and the people we interact with. But what you're doing in onboarding artists or giving them more visibility is something really important. And I just wanted to say thank you, Lego. Thank you, Chi.
00:45:14.378 - 00:46:02.720, Speaker G: It's really important to the space on the terms of just galleries, what they're doing. I know there is a commercial aspect to just big galleries or blue chip galleries as it may, but I'm confident that things like web3 and more grassroots based movements can break that. And we don't have to just keep on with the blue chip galleries and we could gain exposure. That would be a perfect world. In other terms, what they are also doing in onboarding digital art could also be a bridge toward physical galleries, which is not to discount them and they do have and serve a purpose. But it could also mean that more people are making art. And I think that if more people are making art, we all win.
00:46:02.720 - 00:46:05.812, Speaker G: So thats just my two cent on that aspect.
00:46:05.948 - 00:46:34.916, Speaker A: Beautifully put. I couldnt agree more. And it seems to always come back to this barriers of entry. And with web3, I mean, yeah, theres a little bit of gas fees here and there, but other than that, I mean its pretty much free. There is no rent, there is no anything like that. And I think you bring up a really important point on discoverability. Like, what Logojo is doing here on his show is all of a sudden you start to see all these other artists that you might not have known and you see a few that you are familiar with and you love.
00:46:34.916 - 00:46:45.316, Speaker A: And all of a sudden, like you say, I think these worlds are one of the great ways to discover new artists. Lego, do you have any response to what edge Q said?
00:46:45.500 - 00:47:11.184, Speaker C: Thank you, ro, for the kind words. I appreciate it. And, yeah, I hope that it did strengthen bonds between the artists in the group chat because I know 100%, like, not everyone took part, like, knew each other before the world. So I hope that even just within the artists working together in the world, that bonds were strengthened and new connections were made.
00:47:11.304 - 00:47:39.094, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. And I think when you bring on newer artists too, it has a nice mix, actually, of kind of newer artists and artists that have been around a bit. And so I think especially if you're a newer person, they must have been just so excited. Like, I was excited. I was like, oh, cool, I'm finally on a world here. This is great. So, I mean, if you're kind of newer and you haven't really done too much and whatever, and then you're on there, I mean, it must be just like I'm moving up in the world, you know what I mean?
00:47:39.254 - 00:47:40.838, Speaker C: Yeah, I hope so. I hope so.
00:47:40.926 - 00:48:04.804, Speaker A: I'm sure. Well, we're here at 430 and there's tuks. What a great audience we have here today. Human boy is there Kalitsa McBree, JNk. How exciting is that? Ollie Isikowski and Josh and demon ego and more. Okay, so a wonderful lineup here. Legojo, do you have any closing thoughts or just thoughts in general for the community here?
00:48:05.384 - 00:48:41.678, Speaker C: Yeah, I'd say really, at the end of the day, I'm just like a normal dude. If you want to, you know, try creating a world yourself, curating art, you know, give it a shot and go for it, because really anybody could do it. Also, if you're a collector, if you enjoy and appreciate art, I highly recommend checking out the world, because there's art from artists all around the world, different mediums, styles, and it's a great variety. I think that there's a piece for that anyone, at least one piece that anybody could really enjoy. So, you know, check it out and see if there's anything you enjoying the world.
00:48:41.766 - 00:48:52.574, Speaker A: Thanks, Lego. You did an outstanding job of putting that show together. Maybe there are more questions here for you. We have a couple more people coming on stage. Rosa, where are you calling from? And welcome to the show.
00:48:52.694 - 00:49:23.618, Speaker H: Hi, thank you for having me. I'm actually calling from London, but I always like this space. Just had really good energy and I've actually, I feel like I've entered a pool that I haven't really entered before. I've been in the web3 music space for a minute, probably around like six months, but I see a lot of unfamiliar faces, which is really nice. And I've been like listening for the past 20 minutes. And it's just so encouraging to see so many artists supporting other artists of different genres and in different places in the world. So I literally just wanted to say hello and thank you for bringing the vibes today.
00:49:23.618 - 00:49:24.362, Speaker H: That's it.
00:49:24.458 - 00:49:52.688, Speaker A: Well, I love comments like that and I totally appreciate it. We're very grassroots out here and you're seeing a lot of people that have been around the Tezos community and just the NFT scene here for a while. There's tuks, this incredible AI artist. So I totally appreciate the comment, Rosa. And we're here every week at 930 eastern standard time, so do stop by, share your thoughts on everything. Great to hear from London and McBree. Is it McBree? McBreeze, welcome to the show.
00:49:52.688 - 00:49:53.872, Speaker A: Where you calling from?
00:49:54.008 - 00:49:56.244, Speaker I: Hey guys, it's McBreezy.
00:49:56.864 - 00:49:58.000, Speaker A: I see it. Yes.
00:49:58.072 - 00:50:05.634, Speaker I: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Logosio, how do we check out this world? Is it under the artists of today on your description?
00:50:05.754 - 00:50:18.418, Speaker C: Yeah, it's uh, if you click on my profile there would be a, an account tags at artists of today. Click that. And in the link in bio is all the pieces that are currently up for auction.
00:50:18.506 - 00:50:34.938, Speaker I: Okay, cool. Yeah, I haven't heard of the foundation world aspect of doing galleries so I'll definitely check that out. But I just want to say I see a lot of people here from Tezos community. Just salute to all you guys. You guys have some dope work and they're doing some good stuff out here.
00:50:34.986 - 00:50:44.602, Speaker A: So rock on, McBreezy. It's great to hear from you. And, and before you go, is, are you an artist? Are you working on stuff? Are you a collector? What's your scene?
00:50:44.738 - 00:51:23.378, Speaker I: Yeah, so I've been collecting for two years now. I come from like video editing aspect of creating art. And if the last two years kind of just delved into doing digital art, all forms of art, all my friends are artists. I went to film school, so I, you know, I got a lot of friends that are musicians that do traditional art. It's just like anything and everything. I don't really like to be tied down as anything besides a creator. So something that I did just put together was a montage video.
00:51:23.378 - 00:51:47.416, Speaker I: Have it pinned on my profile. If anybody out there would want to go check that out. I showcased a bunch of really cool visuals that have been minted on tezos. And I'm also starting up a YouTube page called Tezos TV, where I want to showcase different events going on in the space, as well as just really cool art. And, yeah, I don't know. We'll see where it goes, I guess. But I just kind, kind of.
00:51:47.416 - 00:51:52.840, Speaker I: Of put that together and plan on trying to help, you know, foster the space here.
00:51:52.992 - 00:52:11.744, Speaker A: Well, I think you're in the right place, mcbreezy, and I will definitely check that out. That sounds super interesting and a beautiful addition to the ecosystem here, and I'll check out your art. Any closing thoughts from anybody here? Doctor version edge q lugojo Mcbreezy Chimascu.
00:52:11.864 - 00:52:16.758, Speaker D: Chi I just wanted to say poke belly. I I was in Italy for.
00:52:16.886 - 00:52:22.134, Speaker E: For about a year, and if you're down there, two things I would recommend.
00:52:22.214 - 00:52:24.394, Speaker D: Is, have you been to Luca before?
00:52:24.694 - 00:52:28.030, Speaker A: You know, I think we're going tomorrow. It's tomorrow or Friday.
00:52:28.182 - 00:52:28.630, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:52:28.702 - 00:52:29.078, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:52:29.166 - 00:52:31.070, Speaker E: Luca is amazing.
00:52:31.142 - 00:52:32.630, Speaker D: And they have a really cool antique.
00:52:32.662 - 00:52:35.754, Speaker E: Market there that opens up in the streets.
00:52:36.134 - 00:52:42.936, Speaker D: Really, really worth checking out. And then also, Sienna, the duomo is amazing over there.
00:52:43.000 - 00:52:44.760, Speaker E: So it just too little.
00:52:44.952 - 00:52:53.128, Speaker A: Those sound like two excellent recommendations. Sienna, it's a bit of a jaunt. It's like 2 hours and 15 minutes.
00:52:53.256 - 00:52:54.440, Speaker D: So it's kind of, like a little.
00:52:54.472 - 00:52:56.016, Speaker E: Bit too far, but, yeah.
00:52:56.040 - 00:52:56.928, Speaker A: From Livorno.
00:52:57.016 - 00:53:01.776, Speaker D: Beautiful. One of a kind. It's unlike any of the other duomos.
00:53:01.880 - 00:53:12.746, Speaker A: Okay. That sounds incredible. Yeah, no, Luca, definitely. And we're gonna have to come back for Siena. My girlfriend is like, we gotta go to Siena. We gotta go to Siena. So maybe we do go.
00:53:12.746 - 00:53:27.374, Speaker A: Florence was mayhem. I mean, you would think it was like June with all the people on the street. It was utter mayhem. People everywhere. It was like. It felt like a tourist trap, which it always is, maybe it always is, I guess.
00:53:27.754 - 00:53:29.122, Speaker E: Yeah. Good.
00:53:29.178 - 00:53:35.288, Speaker D: There's an amazing fresco, one of the first frescoes by Piero della Francesca.
00:53:35.386 - 00:53:39.908, Speaker E: And that is something to see in Florence.
00:53:40.076 - 00:53:43.824, Speaker D: In Florence, it's a smaller chapel. That's.
00:53:44.324 - 00:53:45.172, Speaker E: I'd have to get.
00:53:45.228 - 00:53:46.556, Speaker D: I could get the information for you.
00:53:46.580 - 00:53:49.984, Speaker E: But that fresco was a game changer.
00:53:50.524 - 00:53:54.396, Speaker D: For the Renaissance, and it's Euro della Francesca.
00:53:54.500 - 00:53:58.140, Speaker A: Yeah. I can just do a search. If I can't find it, I'll message you.
00:53:58.292 - 00:54:00.572, Speaker E: It's absolutely amazing because I went to.
00:54:00.588 - 00:54:08.860, Speaker A: Florence on a Monday almost on purpose, so I didn't have to go to the Uffizi, even though. Because then you're just like, okay, I have to go to the Uffizi. But it's closed to course on Mondays. But yeah.
00:54:08.932 - 00:54:11.940, Speaker D: And if the weather is good, you can go to the Bobola Gardens.
00:54:12.092 - 00:54:15.068, Speaker E: And those are absolutely beautiful as well. Okay.
00:54:15.116 - 00:54:15.836, Speaker A: Sorry, what is that called?
00:54:15.860 - 00:54:18.452, Speaker D: The Bobolo Bobali Gardens.
00:54:18.588 - 00:54:18.980, Speaker E: Okay.
00:54:19.012 - 00:54:22.140, Speaker D: I'm pretty sure I could. My pronunciation could be off for sure.
00:54:22.332 - 00:54:24.544, Speaker A: You probably have better Italian than I do.
00:54:25.244 - 00:54:26.508, Speaker D: But yes.
00:54:26.596 - 00:54:29.876, Speaker E: Just a few suggestions since Italy is beautiful.
00:54:29.980 - 00:54:35.024, Speaker A: Okay. A beautiful thought to end on rune tune. Do you have any closing thoughts for us as we wrap up the show?
00:54:35.674 - 00:54:40.986, Speaker B: No, I'm loving all this traditional art world disruption that we're doing over here.
00:54:41.170 - 00:55:01.854, Speaker A: Well, and I love how we're kind of. Again, we have 1ft in both. Like is what I love about it. We have Lego there. We have Chi over, you know, across the street from the tier one gallery. Working the physical thing. That's, to me, that's just incredibly bullish on this scene because, you know, it's really easy to pigeonhole yourself.
00:55:01.854 - 00:55:21.314, Speaker A: So anyways, on that note, thank you, everybody, for joining me up on stage here. And thank you to everybody out there who's listening to the show. Big shout out to JNK and everybody. Ollie, everybody. Thanks for joining me, guys. And I'm gonna enjoy the rest of this vacation here. And I'll see you on Monday.
00:55:21.314 - 00:55:28.394, Speaker A: And thank you to Lagojo most of all.
00:55:30.754 - 00:55:33.898, Speaker C: It's an honor. Thank you so much. Driving. Awesome.
00:55:33.946 - 00:55:34.722, Speaker A: Keep it up, man.
00:55:34.818 - 00:55:35.474, Speaker C: Thank you. Thank you.
