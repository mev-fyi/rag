00:00:03.040 - 00:00:39.386, Speaker A: Welcome back, everyone. After a tragic weekend, I hope you are able to basically move on as we all have to here. As we all have to. It's a huge topic, and we're gonna get into it. War and art deeply intertwined, complicated relationship. War and art, two, you know, elemental aspects of the human psyche. You know, Artist Journal, October 9, 2023.
00:00:39.386 - 00:01:11.056, Speaker A: Broadcasting from Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pokebelli. Yeah, war and art, as I was just saying, like, two, you know, elemental parts of the human psyche. One could argue war. Some people would argue. I mean, Camille Paglia comes to mind that war a controversial figure and don't agree with everything she says. But, for example.
00:01:11.056 - 00:01:54.194, Speaker A: But a prominent humanities scholar. And she argued or said in some interview, I remember reading that war will always be with us. War will always be with us. It is a part of human nature and it also recalls. So that is one side of it. So will war ever disappear? And I thought to myself, as I was thinking about this question this morning, I thought, the only way that war will disappear, it'll just shift focus. If aliens come, then humanity will probably unite so that we can do war against someone else.
00:01:54.194 - 00:02:43.676, Speaker A: And again, it kind of brings this Ballard notion, JG Ballard, I remember this idea that he, in an interview I read years ago, probably 15 years ago, on how in the post world War, the post World War two era was the anomaly. The peace of the post World War two era was the total anomaly. And that really, the. His most of history is war. And so that is kind of one side of it. Like this kind of this thing that it's hard to figure out because perhaps on a certain level, it is biological, perhaps. But I'm not here to try and explain it, and I don't claim to have any answers towards that.
00:02:43.676 - 00:03:37.064, Speaker A: But I am here to speculate a little bit on how it relates to what we're doing here. And it brings, you know, and just a quick point on, before I forget, it also has been there since the very beginning of art. Like, if you know, the Narmer palette, you know, which is usually at the start of most art history textbooks, at least when I went to university. This may have changed in the meantime, but the narmur palette, basically a. Let me show it to you quickly here, and then we'll get into our show here. But there's a necessary discussion that needs to take place here because the argument could be made that it's inappropriate to talk about art in a time of war. Now, we were in a time of war before Saturday morning.
00:03:37.064 - 00:04:03.748, Speaker A: Okay? So. And we're kind of in a constant. There is always a war going on somewhere. So that's also needs to be kept into perspective. But it is. It was shocking as I laid in bed with a virus this weekend reading all these news stories. Final point on the news stories, I mean, that party and I want to get to our show, which is why people watch this show.
00:04:03.748 - 00:04:19.416, Speaker A: But that party was a go. A trance party. I didn't see one news article actually say it properly. I read it was a nature party, it was a peace party. It was a rave. Okay, rave. We could say semi right.
00:04:19.416 - 00:04:47.164, Speaker A: It was a Goa party. I actually did research on it. Astral projection for all the Goa trance people out there, which is probably 0.01% of the show. But I used to be a Goa DJ, so which is why I say this astral projection was supposed to play at like eight or nine in the morning, and that whole attack happened at like seven. Astral projection, for those that don't know, is one of the pioneers of the whole Goa trance scene. So this was no small party.
00:04:47.164 - 00:05:37.502, Speaker A: Man made man was another major artist that was also going to be playing. So. And it looks like it was directly targeted. Anyways, this is not, as I said from the very beginning of this show when I started, this is not a news show, but, you know, but it's worth mentioning since it hasn't been mentioned anywhere else. And if, in case you don't know now, the Narmur palette, just finally on this war idea, and we actually have a couple of more things on the war front, but let me just actually. So for those that don't know, the Narmur palette, also known as the great Hyrancopolis palette, or palette of Narmur, is a significant egyptian archaeological find dating from the 31st century BC. So right near the start, ancient Egypt probably actually before King Nurmer, was the first pharaoh.
00:05:37.502 - 00:06:23.504, Speaker A: Belonging at least nominally to the category of cosmetic palates, it contains some of the earliest hieroglyphic inscriptions. So this is right at the beginning of ancient egyptian civilization here, King Narmer. So this is King Narmur. So, and the reason I'm bringing up the Narmur palette is because this is basically when I was going to university, this was the first, you know, this is the start of your art history textbook. Maybe there was actually, you'd have like the, the Venus from like 40,000 years ago and some cave paintings, Lascaux. But then you get into, you know, the last 5000 years and this is where it usually starts. It's with the Narmur palette.
00:06:23.504 - 00:06:59.464, Speaker A: And what you have here is king Narmer uniting upper and lower Egypt. I can't remember if Narmer was from upper or lower Egypt, but basically conquers. This is probably the other king. And here all to say, it's all about war. So right from the get go, it's all about war. And so war plays a very. And I don't want to I'm not an expert in a sense, in all this, but I do just want to share comments and justification and share just what I know on these things.
00:06:59.464 - 00:08:11.444, Speaker A: And war is there at the very outset that cannot be ignored. And war also, when we think of, like, an ancient greek context, war can be a huge catalyst for the arts. And we even look at Dada, which came after World War one. We look at the ancient Greeks, the persian wars in 480, the battle of Marathon, when that was won, the guy running back to Athens from marathon, where we get the word marathon saying Nikkei, victory. I mean, one of the most inspiring stories ever told, one of the most inspiring military victories of all time that led into the flourishing of Athens. And then you get the Parthenon, and you get the greek tragedians, you get Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, you get socrates. So one of the greatest summits of the human intellect, one could argue, and that all happened as a result of winning that battle.
00:08:11.444 - 00:09:02.214, Speaker A: War is not a foreign, you know, Guernica, war is not foreign to our discussion here. It's actually, one could argue. I don't know if we'd call it central, you know, again, I did a series myself, peloponnesian war. I'm not here to talk about that, but I mean that I didn't do it by accident, you know. So anyway, I don't want to get on my soapbox here too far, but Cosmo de Medici and Clare Silver also brought this up. This idea of it seems preposterous to a certain degree, I think Claire Silver was, or something to that effect, to make art in a time when these horrible, barbaric things are happening on whatever side. I'm not here to declare anything on that.
00:09:02.214 - 00:09:32.414, Speaker A: It made me think of this quote by Theodore, Theodore Adorno, and I couldn't remember it. I was like art aft what was that quote? Chat GPT I looked on Google first, and I couldn't actually find what I was looking for. Chat GPT in one prompt, one question. Got it right, which is very impressive. Here it is. So this is the quote I was looking for. Theodore Adorno, a prominent, famous marxist critic, german philosopher, sociologist.
00:09:32.414 - 00:10:30.434, Speaker A: He's often quoted as saying, to write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric. And I actually completely disagree with this. And just the final sort of point on this, as we hit the ten minute mark here at the end of the day, like, what are we embarked on here, I would argue, is kind of like, it brings up some very big questions here. And I would argue at the end of the day, part of what we're doing here is we are coming to further, deeper and deeper understandings of what beauty is and what it means and maybe what it means to us in our generation, perhaps. And so there is also that, maybe not forever, but at least for us. And I'm trying to remember my train of thought here. So beauty.
00:10:30.434 - 00:11:13.714, Speaker A: Exactly. I am back. So what is, you know, so what is the source, I would argue, of our morality, since we're talking about moral things. And I would argue the source of morality is beauty. And I illustrate that example by saying a good moral action. We consider it good because it's a beautiful act. And when we see something horrible, like we saw a lot of this weekend, we consider that an ugly act or a immoral, not moral right.
00:11:13.714 - 00:12:06.870, Speaker A: So beauty, one could argue finally, on this whole discussion. Beauty is arguably the source of our morality. So when we embark on our artistic ventures here, it may seem trivial at times. It may seem like, okay, that's just a pretty picture. But in the bigger scheme, when things are taken to, you know, when you are pushing the frontiers of pushing the frontiers of aesthetics, you are arguably engaged in a kind of civilizational. What's the word? Enterprise. You are building the foundations of civilization to a certain degree.
00:12:06.870 - 00:12:48.300, Speaker A: So it is not small. When we look at Egypt, what do we remember of that civilization? It is the works. I mean, do we remember really the wars we. Okay, no, like, when you think of Egypt, when you think of Greece, it's actually the art, right, that has the, you know, the. There's a civilizational impact of what is occurring here. So this is why we continue to do it. And in response to Adorno and I say, you know, barbaric and ugly actions, ugly actions should be countered with beautiful actions.
00:12:48.300 - 00:13:30.858, Speaker A: And that is a kind of way of responding to this. Not to simply be silenced by ugly moral action, but actually to provide beauty. That is a response, I would argue, a way, a kind of defiance of sorts. For beauty to be silenced is really to give victory to ugly moral action. I would argue. Again, I'm open to comments, and I'm just my sort of coffee thoughts here as we begin after, you know, it feels like it needs to be mentioned here. Now, let's get to the show because we have a ton to get through.
00:13:30.858 - 00:14:07.606, Speaker A: So let's go. And so here's this brilliant, brilliant, brilliant work by Uri, J and P. Universal. And first of all, it just looks beautiful, doesn't it? And what is the 69 2nd nap? And so, first of all, it looks beautiful. And we see, you know, a beautiful melding of these two artists who do these outlines, I'd argue, which we see often, doing these outlines. Just gonna get some water here. And they fill them with patterns.
00:14:07.606 - 00:14:49.296, Speaker A: Now, looking at it this size can be deceptive, but I brought it up in large here so that we could take a look. And what you're going to see is quite amazing. You see this, you see a whole bunch of sampling, a whole bunch of sampling, different patterning and everything. But this, in particular, I have to say, really interested me. But then you also see it here. It's almost like patterns that are being, like interesting brushes and patterning. And so what you have here are outlines that are basically being filled with patterning, as we've seen many times with both these artists.
00:14:49.296 - 00:15:21.534, Speaker A: And amazingly, like, oftentimes, I don't feel that collaboration is necessarily provide. Like, it's interesting how, as a team, this could work. Like, you could actually see them putting out more entire shows. And, you know, I can't. Gilbert and Sullivan, you know, like, I mean, one of these duos, all of a sudden, you're like, this could really work as a duo as well. Like, I mean, this is pretty amazing stuff here. So again, I don't want to take too long on this, but beautiful work here.
00:15:21.534 - 00:15:35.676, Speaker A: Let me just check the market here. Did this already go for sale? Already sold. Only ten tezos. Yeah. There's Sabato, magician, Flexosaurus, Trippie collector Sunday, all sorts of people. So let's keep going here. We have a lot to go through.
00:15:35.676 - 00:15:51.512, Speaker A: So beautiful work there. Here's another stunner. See you later. So another bad, interestingly, and also by Uri J and P. Universal here. And again, this one seems. The other one seemed a little bit more pp universal.
00:15:51.512 - 00:16:15.000, Speaker A: This one seems a little bit more Uri J. If I had to guess, it was fun. I will see you later. Pee pee. And so just very, very cool work here as we see both artists. And this, you feel you have a little bit more of the kind of noise and processing and filtering, shall we say, of Yuri J in this one. So all to say, though, just an awesome collab here.
00:16:15.000 - 00:16:41.596, Speaker A: Look at those great pillows, right? I mean, it's easy to gloss over here. And one more. This is also this part of a series called important stories. Pp Yuri J. So here, a window here and someone at the laptop. Maybe that is Yuri J as an octopus. Maybe that is Yuri J's kind of alter ego.
00:16:41.596 - 00:16:56.220, Speaker A: And here, I'm not exactly sure what that says and it's not zooming in for me. I don't think I brought it up big here. Let's just look very quickly and then we're going to run through the rest of the show. If you ever want to collab, please let me know. Hilarious. Hello, Yuri. That's great.
00:16:56.220 - 00:17:12.334, Speaker A: So just totally awesome. It looks great and I'm super glad that they did it. Also one by Yuri J. That was put out this weekend. One of one for 400 tezos mnchild. So this is Yuri J. And so just beautiful work from both these artists this weekend.
00:17:12.334 - 00:17:31.026, Speaker A: Comments from last show. So thank you first of all for the comments. Sellieri AI, my head is exploding with so many beautiful things you have shown today. Congratulations to all the artists, including you. Including you as these episodes are art in themselves. Thank you. Silieri.
00:17:31.026 - 00:17:49.616, Speaker A: I am still recovering from a virus actually this weekend. Thank you very much. I really appreciate that. Skomra, great show. It sent me to object many times and you know, I'm really thrilled to hear this because I was sick when I was putting that together. So I was just kind of putting things. So I'm thrilled that you guys felt that way.
00:17:49.616 - 00:18:07.004, Speaker A: Interesting thoughts about Warhol and the recolors. The Kiwi recolor or Game Boy recolor looks great. I think that's a great idea for an addition work that you're taking bids on. Thanks for showing what would become tree five. You're welcome. Thanks for the interesting comment. Tornado Rodriguez, thank you Pokebelly, for the shout out.
00:18:07.004 - 00:18:48.548, Speaker A: It fills me with pride when you see an argentinian artist, you think of me. While I was listening to you responding to the comments that talk about your diversity showcasing artists, I wondered if you ever thought about doing a curated drop on object one. It would be incredible if object contacted you. You know, a lot of artists, you know, first of all, I'd like to say object has been like K? Blein. I've talked to K? Blein and they've offered me, you know, just, I don't want to like, start, you know, revealing private. But they've mentioned, you know, maybe it's possible, you know, homepage, curation type thing here and there just for fun. And it's me who's actually put it off because I simply don't have time.
00:18:48.548 - 00:19:32.524, Speaker A: But maybe that'll happen at one point in the future. I guess my point is object has actually been totally awesome. And yeah, and it brings up an interesting point, which is also going to come up in, I think, our next tab here, which is, well, I'll wait for that tab, but hold that thought on the whole object thing. I may do an object one at some point. I'm a little concerned that if I, I kind of feel like I do that every day here to a certain degree. And I don't want to start, I guess I already kind of have favorites to a certain degree, but I don't want to start picking favorites too much and whatever, so, and it's a lot of work. But who knows? Let's see.
00:19:32.524 - 00:19:45.336, Speaker A: I'm open minded. I'm open minded. That Pamelo exhibition looks so fun indeed. Ed Marolla absolutely. San Diego is a code all. Today's episode was very frustrating for me. Made me want to make some reaction videos.
00:19:45.336 - 00:20:11.572, Speaker A: There's too much I want to comment. I love your show. As I was saying, maybe we put you on the Pixel network, Santiago. And also, I actually thought Twitter space, because Santiago has been commenting for a while I was involved with hen I think maybe we bring Santiago onto a Twitter space in the next few weeks. Olena Latisheva yes, you're right. Speaking tomatoes works are AI. Thank you and thank you.
00:20:11.572 - 00:20:43.994, Speaker A: Mordesh spiral Lovely Show. Poco Marcel Muntianu where we watch unknown collector's show. This was on object one unknown collector's show. And so thank you everybody for the comments. And also, Bolles had a comment here. Quilanina's piece reminds me of sympathia la rabbia de Remedios varro so interesting. This almost has what's the name of the artist? The surrealist? It's a name off the top of my I'm sure someone out there knows exactly head who I'm talking about.
00:20:43.994 - 00:21:04.790, Speaker A: Kind of has a surrealist feel to it, too. Beautiful work here. I always yeah, her name's escaping me right now. Thank you for the comment. Mech txt so back to object homepage Dear object.com so I can't read all of this. This hair was done during COVID so I'm a little.
00:21:04.790 - 00:21:59.114, Speaker A: I need to figure out how to take that image down. Yeah, so mech txt very nicely was saying two to four cards for news updates. For someone like Pokebelly, who constantly contributes to the ecosystem even though it's not directly related to the marketplace or blockchains. So again, this idea of putting me on object homepage, again, Kate Blaine was mentioned to me and I don't think she'd mind me mentioning this. It's like, I think it's great that you're independent and I feel the exact same way because it this way if, and I appreciate the thought, by the way, mech TXT. But if I was on objects homepage and all of a sudden I might feel pressure that I need to have like a Tezos artist to start the show. And there are, you know, probably mostly Tezos artists in most of the shows, but maybe I start with a Zora artist and maybe they don't want Zora, or maybe they don't want super rare or whatever.
00:21:59.114 - 00:22:22.710, Speaker A: So it's a nice idea. And the YouTube videos are embeddable. So in that respect, anybody can do anything with the videos. If they want to put them on, they're welcome to. But you know, I, but I, you know, it's sort of like Zora. Like I'm starting to mint. I'm putting it together, the works on Zora.
00:22:22.710 - 00:22:53.632, Speaker A: And Zora is actually going to be on this week's Twitter space. So hopefully the works are ready. The videos are ready. Minted from artist Journal, as we've been discussing for weeks here. But I don't want a formal deal with any of these companies or marketplaces because then I start to lose my independence. And as Cab Lane was rightly pointing out, that's kind of what makes, yeah, it's better that you're independent. And I completely agree with that.
00:22:53.632 - 00:23:16.600, Speaker A: So anyways, I appreciate the thought and anybody's welcome to embed the videos wherever they want. It's YouTube, Ripcash, and just a couple I'm trying to run through this show. I'm going to speed up here. Just big thank you to rip cash, major crypto artist here. Adrian Pokebelly has created something unique with his artist journal video series. If you haven't seen an episode yet, I recommend you take the time to watch some of them. Big shout out and thank you.
00:23:16.600 - 00:23:34.796, Speaker A: Ripcash is a very prominent, again, crypto artist. So that is just a big thank you and I appreciate that. And it's like, I guess these are getting out there. Cab Lane. So we're wondering on how the MoMA postcards work. K. Blaine, information on how MoMA postcards work.
00:23:34.796 - 00:23:53.448, Speaker A: So autonomy, who organized it? Here's how they work. Step one, mint a blank. Moma postcard. Postcards will be released in limited quantities each day via QR code or link. Activate your postcard by following the instructions in the autonomy app. If you don't have the app, so you got to get the app. Okay.
00:23:53.448 - 00:24:10.080, Speaker A: And then it's limited release. Step two. I don't know why they don't just open it up to everybody, but it's their thing. Design and sign your stamp using MoMA's color palette. Create a pixel art stamp. Interesting. So you have to use MoMA's color palette.
00:24:10.080 - 00:24:35.918, Speaker A: After your design is complete, you will be prompted to sign it. There's more than one way to sign a stamp. See how exchells and operator so I guess then you sign it stamp the postcard. This is where you stamp gets minted and pinned to IPFS International protocol file service. After signing is complete, you will become a fractional owner of the postcard. This version of the postcard is on a FA two, so it's quite complicated. It's on an FA two contract.
00:24:35.918 - 00:24:55.418, Speaker A: Your stamp represents your token of ownership. 15 possible. So I'm still. Yeah, so this is how it works. 15 possible stamps, 15 possible owners more on fractional ownership soon send the postcard to the next stamper. Now it's time to bring others in on the fun. Invite whoever you'd like to co create with you.
00:24:55.418 - 00:25:13.824, Speaker A: You can choose to send the postcard via any main message. So you can send it on WhatsApp or SMS or Instagram. Doesn't need to be crypto. Repeat steps one to four until all 15 stamps have been designed and added. So I guess there's. So these are the 15 stamps. So interesting.
00:25:13.824 - 00:25:44.522, Speaker A: I'm not sure, it's a little complicated. Like, I guess if I were to do it, I mean, and who cares what, who cares what I think if I was to do it, I'd just be like, let's just do eight Baidu, open it up to everybody. Instead of eight x eight, we do ten by ten to make it different and we just call it a moMa. And then we have some sort of send around thing. But this is how it works and so go to autonomy. If you're trying to figure out more, make sure I give them a follow and okay, good. Let's run through Versama shut down.
00:25:44.522 - 00:26:06.054, Speaker A: We hope this message finds you in good health. We have some important news. After careful consideration and evaluation, we've made the difficult decision to shut down. So you have until the 20 October or wait. So go here to find out more. The site will go down on the 1 December. We can't read all this, otherwise the show is going to be like 7 hours.
00:26:06.054 - 00:26:30.924, Speaker A: But NFT biker following the news about versum official you can use the re swap tool to move your swaps from versum to object. So if you're an artist that has minted works on versum, I think this is important. I have some works on Versim. You should do it in batch of twenties, otherwise there can be gas errors. Thanks versum for all what you did. It was a beautiful platform. It's unfortunate it never really took off.
00:26:30.924 - 00:27:14.292, Speaker A: So continuing on naval the best argument for x as the everything app is that it's the least likely to get in between a creator and their followers. And so I think most people who watch this show are aware of the importance of being on x. But I kind of tell my contemporary art friends who are not on x or not in crypto, I'm trying to tell them get on x because you probably want to get on it. And I could be wrong. So this is more to me a message to people who aren't on it. Santiago with a work in progress. Look at this.
00:27:14.292 - 00:27:37.582, Speaker A: So how cool is this? Santiago style, but physical GM so I assume this is like a work in progress. So very prolific here. And here's one by Greco Rando. Just an interesting video of work in progress. Pretty dramatic here, actually. So more just. I thought this was a great video.
00:27:37.582 - 00:27:51.206, Speaker A: And then you see it up close. Kind of a nice production. Hey, so very cool there. Into the works we go. So this is one from September that I missed from one don't knows. And let's just take a look. This is called limbo.
00:27:51.206 - 00:28:15.770, Speaker A: This is on super rare. And here it looks basically like an 18th century british painting aristocrat. It's part of a collage, of course, a big collage. And this is almost that lightning strike, reminiscent of that gargone tempest work. And so all sorts of stuff. Of course, a brilliant collage by one don't knows. And just a beautiful work here.
00:28:15.770 - 00:28:46.650, Speaker A: And yeah, I just kind of saw this later here, so I thought I'd add it to our works here already. It looks like it was transferred. So private sale continuing on. RJ just minted this pool screen. So after AI trained on David Hockney, this is just going for 690 tazos. So forsaking the auctions, I think the last auction went for 150. So it just goes to show how finicky, how fickle the market can be.
00:28:46.650 - 00:29:16.990, Speaker A: And maybe it's a work by work basis because RJ had, I think it was $6.50, then 1150, then 150. So it just goes to show, had there been one other bidder in there, it might have went up to 1100, you know. So here trying out, trying different ways of selling, which I think is actually a pretty good idea. So another Hockney work and very Hockney esque, especially in the pool there. And there is RJ as, as the laptop there. And just another really cool narrative painting here.
00:29:16.990 - 00:29:42.366, Speaker A: Pixel art painting, 690 tezos $461 and Eduardo Pulitzer. So this is Ed Morolla's kinda with his main name, Eduardo Pulitzer. PQ lage or lager. And this is a. There's only a few paintings on this account. I'll show you in a second. So maybe a self portrait here with a projector and maybe a machine and some sort of work here.
00:29:42.366 - 00:30:09.214, Speaker A: So another one of 1150 tezos and so $100 and that is on object. And here Edmarola other self. So if you haven't seen this account, it is kind of obscure. So FYI, this exists if you're an Edmarola collector. Gloom tube gift basket two. Just saying thanks. So interestingly, I mean it was canadian Thanksgiving and so let's.
00:30:09.214 - 00:30:24.650, Speaker A: So this is. But maybe it's a holiday. It's actually canadian Thanksgiving today. So happy thanksgiving to all the Canadians out there. So I'm not sure what. Maybe this is another holiday that's in the US at the same time. Not sure.
00:30:24.650 - 00:30:36.186, Speaker A: Anyways, a delivery guy with flowers. Isn't that nice gift basket. Just saying thanks. Nice work here. One was sent to me, edition of 55. Going already for 50 tezos. That might be because I have one of one.
00:30:36.186 - 00:30:51.368, Speaker A: And you get put in the lottery either way. Thank you Gloomtube. The world isn't ending. It just feels like it. So another work. Gloomtube released a few at auction for 80 tezos. Kind of with Gloomtube's newer style here, kind of airbrushy, a little bit more.
00:30:51.368 - 00:31:15.334, Speaker A: And here you have again what was the world isn't ending. It just feels like it. So interesting work here. These two gloom tube characters pushing into each other with the world on fire in the background there. Pollution and cart return. That is, you know, UFO. And the new addition to the works, the UFO.
00:31:15.334 - 00:31:50.664, Speaker A: So Gloomtube keeps it interesting over here. One of one as well. And here's another one of one. This came out a few days ago, October 4, psychic vagrant. And again, kind of has a bit of a UFO feeling to it, doesn't it? So here GT probably gloom tube the earth with a halo on it and kind of, again, that kind of airbrush and kind of alien feeling in the color there. Sold for 322 tezos. Nice sale to Ray McScriff and also a work by a collaboration between Tornado Rodriguez and Wanci FTs.
00:31:50.664 - 00:32:05.802, Speaker A: I'm super excited about this collab. Wanci is such an amazing artist. I think you'll enjoy what we've been doing really, really soon. A very nice collab with my friend Tornado. Tornado Rodriguez. So here is the work and I assume this is Tornado and. But hard to say.
00:32:05.802 - 00:32:28.814, Speaker A: Yeah, probably a combination of different styles here. And there is a big bud character playing what looks like, kind of like a Pac man, but maybe that's a bird. And so just a cool work here. Another cool painting from tornado and onesie. So interesting collaboration. Look at this. I thought this was pretty interesting.
00:32:28.814 - 00:33:04.384, Speaker A: I just came across this on Instagram and 26 likes. So, I mean, pretty obscure here. And I brought up their main page. So just interesting kind of because we look a lot at what I like to call gradient, these gradient artists like NUV 1914, Dan Control. So I brought up this artist, notam 1140. And it really was a standout here because then you see other works and so maybe just experimenting, but I thought pretty interesting because fairly obscure, I mean, put it this way, 1300 followers, so. But it looked like a pretty cool work here.
00:33:04.384 - 00:33:29.322, Speaker A: Pretty original, maybe would hang in the same room as a spartan brook here. Metal seafood, shellfish poisoning. So kind of cryptic there. Another cool kind of mingling, as I like to say, of the mediums of painting, painting and video here. So very cool way of bringing a painting to life. Abstract and just interesting colors, interesting noise. Just really interesting work.
00:33:29.322 - 00:33:53.832, Speaker A: This is an edition of eleven for ten tezos each. There are six left. Interesting color. Nuve 1914 con arbo de frutas. So not exactly sure what that means, but maybe this is a fruit tree or something. So again, this massive gradient frame here with the character and maybe picking fruit. Looks like a fruit tree.
00:33:53.832 - 00:34:27.774, Speaker A: Edition of three and sold out at seven tezos. And continuing on, Casa del Arbol, also another one. So trees and maybe a home edition of three. And again playing with the color in the frame here, but kind of keeping that blue in the middle. So more interesting experimentation from NUv 1914. So I net eight tazos here, all going to magician. And continuing on, LTxcx, some more kind of gradient esque art here.
00:34:27.774 - 00:34:46.993, Speaker A: GM here's a 2023 finished artwork. So again, playing with the windows and just interesting colors here. Rainbows. Not exactly sure, frankly, what's going on here. Kind of a surreal work here, but I thought it was interesting. We've looked at lxtXcx's work before. Interesting piece.
00:34:46.993 - 00:35:12.010, Speaker A: Continuing on. This is Santiago ruau when the grass dances with the wind. This is on Zora. And I thought just an interesting experimental work here, or interesting abstract work. And interesting frame here, too. You see the gradient and it's kind of like the inverse or reverse gradient of the that's in the background. And so just a nice piece here by Santiago Ruau.
00:35:12.010 - 00:35:28.334, Speaker A: This is a free mint and it's available for four days. These were super duper interesting. On a quieter day, maybe I would have started with these. These are super interesting. Mech TXT, who I do follow. That is a Twitter bug. Last one tonight, pummerian raining.
00:35:28.334 - 00:35:52.794, Speaker A: Look at this. So what this looks like to me is, and I think we said there's another screenshot. I'm not sure if I brought it up. This looks like sampling of video games. Like this reminds me again, there's something almost Ultima four esque, but it's a different. Maybe it's sampling some other video game. Maybe mech TXT is making their own samples, his own samples.
00:35:52.794 - 00:36:05.710, Speaker A: Really cool abstract, though. Kind of reminiscent of those brilliant abstracts that kappan is doing. Semi abstracts. Here's. This is why. Okay, good. They sprite.
00:36:05.710 - 00:36:51.194, Speaker A: So how cool is this? So it looks like samples are being brought in, maybe not even sampling himself, but bringing them in just from other places and then making beautiful kind of works with it. I think it's quite brilliant. I mean, it's kind of so simple, but it's so brilliant. And it's very fresh, again, would hang really nicely with those cap'n works. Look at this. And again, because again, let's not forget this idea that I was bringing up of, like, again, as I like to say, ultima four for me, which I've brought up before and I've already way going long on this episode. Here for me, is what I like to call an early masterpiece of digital art.
00:36:51.194 - 00:37:40.652, Speaker A: And what this almost does is it's not identical at all, but it's kind of similar in some of the aspects here of kind of some of the squares that they have that they build scenes with in Ultima four. And it's almost like taking that and turning it into an abstraction. It's like sampling those squares and then making a whole work with it. So I just find this fascinating, a fascinating avenue for exploration. It makes me want to go to Ultima four and then sample them and kind of try doing similar things. I mean, and you know, it's an interesting artwork when it makes you want to make art, right? A brilliant, brilliant experimentation from mech TXT Heidi Rockette with more. I don't think we looked at this one art.
00:37:40.652 - 00:37:52.452, Speaker A: This came out October 7. Today's the 9th. I'm pretty sure we didn't look at this one. There are a few of the. So this is pretty cool. Look at this old computer and then a disc and then shooting out on both sides. Art.
00:37:52.452 - 00:38:21.110, Speaker A: It's a cool pixel art GiF from Haiti Rockette edition of five. Here's another one, art, kind of bringing up, you know, our topic that I opened with for the first ten minutes. You know, in a sense, you do have death and art. I mean, here there's a little bit more humor with the word sick, but the sick could actually be read two ways. So interesting. Interesting actually. And maybe it's all just kind of randomly put together.
00:38:21.110 - 00:38:50.838, Speaker A: Maybe there are too late sick edition, like, hard to say, but interesting. What we do have here, we don't know the intentions of the artist, but what we do have here is a conflation of art death and maybe violence a little bit in this kind of green and red blood that's coming out. Apparent blood. So interesting work from Haiti, rocket. Nice and ambiguous. Keeping it interesting, punks. Distorted ar zero seven five.
00:38:50.838 - 00:39:18.416, Speaker A: So this looks like a milk jug or something. A milk carton with like skull on it. So interesting piece here. So this is for eight tazos edition of 20. And there is one on secondary spiegelsmaskinen with a really cool work here of cool pixel work of a phone. And this was just posted on x. Let's see how many views this got.
00:39:18.416 - 00:39:37.184, Speaker A: I imagine a lot. 6000, which is a lot, but I'd almost expect more. But anyway, pretty awesome work. Let's help it on its way. There we go. And Francois Gamma, this was pretty cool. Again, I assume this is from 2009.
00:39:37.184 - 00:39:58.272, Speaker A: Everything from this series here. Excuse me. And here just, I thought this was quite brilliant. Interesting. I'd never seen anything actually that Francois Gamma had done quite like this. And interesting use of color here too. Basically you see a body that's kind of on its side and then broken apart here, here.
00:39:58.272 - 00:40:15.104, Speaker A: And then what looks like geometric shapes in two colors. Drawing from server zero eight. Very cool. And again, kind of. You can't help but think this was referencing the weekend. This came out on October 7. So that was Saturday, interestingly.
00:40:15.104 - 00:40:36.074, Speaker A: So maybe, you know, did this. I don't think this came out before. Well, look at the time. But look at the surprise attack. Someone snuck into the military base. The guards at the entrance to the building were put to sleep with narcotic smoke bombs. Who did it and what will happen now? So kind of taking a fictional approach to maybe real world events.
00:40:36.074 - 00:41:06.666, Speaker A: Very well done drawing by smaunter. And this was done at midnight. Interestingly, this probably came out before. Interestingly, the events on Saturday. Continuing on Yuyo 66 bedtime stories edition of twelve. So just another really cool work here. Brilliant underground comic psychedelia style.
00:41:06.666 - 00:41:25.034, Speaker A: NFT illustration by the great Uyo 66 look at this. It just dazzles the eyes. And this is on object. And I don't think Uyo has put too much on object recently. Nice addition of twist. Twelve for 20 tezos. I mean to get it for 20 tezos.
00:41:25.034 - 00:41:55.226, Speaker A: Very low price here for Uyo 66, only 660 for a very low edition. Is this. Yeah, this was just release. So bedtime story is great piece by uyo 66 Turkarak wake and bake. So interesting piece here and here the person having a joint waking up and having a joint and a coffee in their kind of dilapidated apartment here. A little bit dilapidated. And there you see the paraphernalia and everything.
00:41:55.226 - 00:42:10.010, Speaker A: Interesting drawing as ever from Turkarak and interesting. Not sure what this is. Not a mirror, but maybe, who knows. Continuing on. Look at this. Not a number. Happy weekend.
00:42:10.010 - 00:42:47.390, Speaker A: Making some nice generative art, aren't? Aren't they? I mean pretty nice work here. I assume this is generative because not a number often uses, I think P five js and kind of programming to make a lot of remember the dithered gradients and everything. This could be a pretty cool series. So very nice there. And here is the names escaping me right now. Miyushi, I believe. Forgive me, I am still recovering here.
00:42:47.390 - 00:43:01.878, Speaker A: Planetarium by I think it's meushi. It's mushy. Infernal. Let me bring that back up here. Infernal exoplanet. So again you see this planet on fire here and all of these looks like satellites. Pretty nice piece actually.
00:43:01.878 - 00:43:24.416, Speaker A: And this is mint for 0.01 ETH edition of 20 on Zora. Ten of cups from Manadil. So this has been finished here and I think taking offers. And here is the cat bouncing the ball and of course the ten of cups here we saw this being made. Now it is animated and finished. Just an epic series that Manidal is doing here.
00:43:24.416 - 00:43:51.470, Speaker A: I mean again, it's hard not to see this as being a part of like, of the history of tarot. Should this all be finished here? Offers are coming in addition of ten. Chaz preparing to rise. So playing with these super hilarious and cool old computer retro computers with the tiny screens here. And just hilarious. And what was this called again? Preparing to rise. So null, null, null.
00:43:51.470 - 00:44:13.206, Speaker A: And then a phone here, interestingly contrasting with the old technology. And maybe someone doing their homework and everything. So just another really cool work in this series by Chaz. Edition of 20. And I think is on secondary now for five tezos. And a cool work by Mason III. I think this came out, actually a month ago, but I'd missed actually some of their recent works.
00:44:13.206 - 00:44:30.910, Speaker A: Fire walks with this rom. Kind of maybe a twin peaks reference here. Fire walks with me. Fire walks with this rom. And just looks like a fire, but totally abstracted. I mean, very nice. I mean, for it, just as a fire, that's basically a glitch rom.
00:44:30.910 - 00:45:00.188, Speaker A: Pretty nice, actually. This is a one of one, by the way, for 30 tazos, in case you missed it. Silva sand, two s, glitchscape, three Dyna brothers. And here is a beautiful beachscape here with silva sand twos prolifically putting out a ton of glitch roms here. And another just kind of nice beach scene here. This is edition of 13 for 340. And there are four left on primary XoXO.
00:45:00.188 - 00:45:14.614, Speaker A: Just put this out, actually. October 7 and edition of five. Now it's 982. This was an open edition for only 222. I think a super interesting artist. I love how they. I mean, it seems to be super Mario.
00:45:14.614 - 00:46:18.742, Speaker A: At least super Mario influenced iconography and just making kind of animated abstractions out of it. I think just really interesting, kind of reminiscent in its own way of what we saw with Michael Macasso there. Kind of sampling a video game. And then, I mean, that's what it looks like with Michael Macasso sampling like an old school video game and then making art out of it. You know, this whole sampling thing, visual sampling, you wonder if it's been exploited enough. I mean, it brings me back when was it William Burroughs and Brian Geysen who were saying that painting was 50 years ahead of writing in discussing the cut up method in the third mind? And it makes you wonder, like, is music ahead of art? To a certain degree, when it comes to sampling, I mean, electronic music has been so sample heavy. It's become like ingrained in modern music to a large degree.
00:46:18.742 - 00:46:34.706, Speaker A: Not entirely, but to a large degree. Do we see that to the same extent in the visual arts? It's just I say that as an open question. Interesting. So Zoxo dispersed. Very cool work here. And Lorna Mills shouted out, Kazuhiro here. This is so good.
00:46:34.706 - 00:47:00.494, Speaker A: Kazuhiro. The very brief block of green gives the movement extra definition and has me watching on repeat. I'm entranced with animation that contains a formal narrative like this one. So pretty cool orc here from Kazuhiro ahira. So just interesting animated. Kazuhiro ahara. And so just cool work there.
00:47:00.494 - 00:47:19.100, Speaker A: Nice find by Lorna Mills. Vtech. Vtech visuals. So just another animated abstract here. So just more interesting visual experiences here. Courtesy of vtech aka vtech visuals. Datura with the cool work, architectonic and patterns.
00:47:19.100 - 00:47:46.594, Speaker A: Look at this. So what I find really interesting about Datura's work, one of the things, actually, the textures are super interesting, but one of the things I find super interesting is how it's almost always representational. Like, it would be so tempting almost to turn these into abstractions. And I think sometimes, like, there's triangle. So sometimes it veers towards abstraction and maybe is. But there always seems to. Often seems to be a.
00:47:46.594 - 00:48:00.170, Speaker A: Just a little kind of hook onto representation. Just a slight. Like here. It kind of looks like a stairwell and maybe gates or a door of some kind. Same here. Maybe a building. Architectonic and patterns.
00:48:00.170 - 00:48:18.950, Speaker A: I mean, that's exactly what it is. Arcad, zero, zero, two for ten tezos, and there are three left. And Renki with a pretty cool work. I'm not gonna leave it on too long. Yoko kawa. But what I liked about it was kind of this DNA field, kind of noisy DNA thing. It's kind of flashy, so I'm not gonna leave that on too long.
00:48:18.950 - 00:48:55.648, Speaker A: But cool work there from Renki for ten tezos, edition of ten inavare with another fruit apple. Dancing apple created by video artist. So just another cool fruit, kind of analog glitch video of a fruit in kind of rolling down. Interesting piece by ina verre. Edition of 15 for 20 tezos. And that is on secondary Lorna mills. This one I found pretty interesting in the way that Lorna Mills is barely present in her masking.
00:48:55.648 - 00:49:15.504, Speaker A: You see the green, of course, that's stanmark. Sorry, trademark Lorna Mills. And I. I kind of love how she just edges in here in this video. Very interesting. And again, it seems like often Lorna is using, like with the hulk, the green, the green. Maybe the forest green is being evoked here, but in a different kind of green.
00:49:15.504 - 00:49:34.344, Speaker A: Interesting piece from Lorna Mills boss gay grazias with a few more beautiful works here. Using these film negatives kiss me under the arcade. So here you have. Maybe this is just one, or perhaps it's two. I'm not sure if it's a juxtap. I think it's a juxtaposition. It looks like it's cut over here.
00:49:34.344 - 00:49:55.032, Speaker A: Here we go. So, again, just very nice work here. I thought this one was stunning. Rendezvous, where you have the rembrandt on the right, all in red. I mean, that in itself is just beautiful. Then you put it with these gorgeous kind of cream colored negatives here. And then I'm not sure who this.
00:49:55.032 - 00:50:35.538, Speaker A: Like, if I had to guess, I'd say, like, el Greco or something, I think is a spanish painter. I'm not sure if it says here, en cuentro, which means rendezvous. Not sure who the person on the left is. But again, this contrast is just totally beautiful. And I suspect that these are taken from slides of someone that went to a museum and took pictures of paintings, like a lot of our parents did, taking slides, you know, here's some more quiet bosque gratias also. So another just really cool juxtaposition here. And I think we have a couple more here.
00:50:35.538 - 00:50:57.250, Speaker A: Claude Monet Croquis about the garden he wants to create. So is there. Oh, so there's Claude Monet on its side. Or one of those bridge works, but turned on its side. And then here, some sort of castle. Looks like a roman edifice of sorts, doesn't it? And one more here. I thought this was brilliant, too.
00:50:57.250 - 00:51:12.714, Speaker A: Traffic. This slide has no explanation. It is a meaning of movements being cut. Exactly. This is beautiful in a sense. I don't even know why. It's just a beautiful juxtaposition.
00:51:12.714 - 00:51:47.554, Speaker A: And there you have, of course, Michelangelo's creation, or I guess, the serpent or lucifer giving the apple to Eve. And juxtaposed with a equestrian, but almost evokes degas in a weird sort of oblique sort of way. Edition of five, two sold for fortezos. None on secondary. Again, if this was a quiet day, maybe we would have started with this. Avalon with a beautiful work here. Evelyn o.
00:51:47.554 - 00:52:05.086, Speaker A: Stunning AI artwork here by Evelyn O. Look at the textures in here. I don't know if it's been minted anywhere. I didn't see it minted anywhere. But look at this great painterly background. The jacket, the composition, the color. This is stunning AI artwork.
00:52:05.086 - 00:52:24.720, Speaker A: Again, continuing on into the AI, Mikey Wilson. The miserables. Les miserables in English. And here, coming back to the gangs that we were seeing a while back, I saw in the tweet interesting color, too. And beautiful. Again, AI painting here. And beautiful painting here.
00:52:24.720 - 00:52:46.428, Speaker A: Look at it in the house here. And I also love the colors of all these whites. Look at all these just slightly different whites. It would have been tempting to make the sky bluer or the, you know, the road darker gray and all that. But all these whites, like it really creates a feeling, a really nice feeling. It's beautifully done. Mikey Wilson, continue.
00:52:46.428 - 00:53:12.024, Speaker A: It's so great to see Mikey Wilson dazzle here. Selling out at ten tezos a piece, edition of ten. See Mikey Wilson, as a collector, knows how to price it. Edition of ten, low edition, ten tezos, reasonable price. Echoes along the shore. So Tewks puts out a one of one. And this sold for 365 tezos to fungibull.
00:53:12.024 - 00:53:36.428, Speaker A: And another interesting AI artwork here. Kind of has slightly impressionist feel, but more like an AI artwork. Just interesting piece here. Echoes along the shore by tukes. So nice sail there, too, 365. And as we go into the improps works here, lily illo, look at this beautiful work. Sometimes it happens and it hits you, wounds you in the very best way.
00:53:36.428 - 00:54:03.998, Speaker A: Improps IO open studio. So again, makes you want to try out some, put it on your to do list, try out improps, because seeing some pretty amazing results here. Here is Kika Nikolayla, mnemonics. Mnemonics number twelve. And so here we also using improps open studio. So this is open to everybody now, as far as I understand. So some palm trees.
00:54:03.998 - 00:54:39.162, Speaker A: And I have a few from her series here. Here's number 28. Almost has, you know, vague, almost like a Rauschenberg sort of feel. Even a little bit of sigmar polka in there. The way that the kind of the brushstrokes underneath don't necessarily fit the outlines of the images on top. It's instant poetry. I've mentioned this probably 200 episodes ago now, literally, if you want instant poetry, put some brush marks and then put something completely unrelated, outline over top, and it's instantly beautiful and poetic.
00:54:39.162 - 00:54:54.060, Speaker A: So beautiful work here. I mean, and doing many other things here. And this is based on memories as well. Long form AI via improps open studio. So cool work. One of one from Kiko Nicolela. And here's one more, number 27 here.
00:54:54.060 - 00:55:19.504, Speaker A: And maybe playing with kind of family photos of a certain kind. And so how fictional are our memories? And I think Danielle King was also working with that theme. So it's interesting how AI and fiction, fictional memories, are becoming a theme that we're seeing. And here, of course, I'm sure most of you will recognize who this is. Sabato. Another blessed Saturday in autotopia. So continuing with the autotopia.
00:55:19.504 - 00:55:39.664, Speaker A: And these are improps as well. So taking the autotopia series to improps. And there's one. And here's another outrageous work. And we kind of get a clue, actually, in here into what Sabato is doing. I did a thing tonight on night of the Lowriders. It's chromed out, it's goopy, it's Miami, it's AI.
00:55:39.664 - 00:56:03.594, Speaker A: It's almost like Sabato is almost playing with camp, you know, here. Campiness chromed out, it's goopy, it's Miami, it's AI. And here it is, this outrageous car here. Hilarious and original little cakes. I'm not sure. I think this is just AI fx hash. So I'm not sure if this is.
00:56:03.594 - 00:56:54.056, Speaker A: I think this is just straight up AI and not what I'd be tempted to call generative AI throwaway doll number seven. I thought this was just kind of powerful work that kind of hit me hard, like the dolls tend to do. And Shilly Preston with an interesting AI video that I thought was just kind of novel. I mean, as we see how AI video just kind of novel visual experiences as we start to see more and more AI video. So just interesting piece here. So that is Shirley Preston, that generative AI video that might have been burned. That was burned, but I guess it still appeared here in my feed and Instagram.
00:56:54.056 - 00:57:15.034, Speaker A: Look at this. Shrigel Farner. They were not created. Falling monkeys were not created for a children's room wallpaper or as a pattern for a silk scarf. Silk scarf. They decorate the COVID of the third album of the Berlin crowdo pop band Jelke with the concise title Krieg Unferien. Krieg means war.
00:57:15.034 - 00:57:37.526, Speaker A: Not sure what translate. Let's see what war and holiday. Oh, yeah. Taf or I'm not exactly sure, but maybe to travel. It will be released on the 27 October. So anyways, here is just a. I thought it was a really brilliant album cover, isn't it? This was pretty cool.
00:57:37.526 - 00:57:49.910, Speaker A: I believe. DJ Kore. DJ. Sorry, Kuro. Sorry, guys. I'm getting over a fever here. By the way, I had major fever this weekend.
00:57:49.910 - 00:58:10.982, Speaker A: DJ Kiro, Jimmy, Edgar Dove. I thought this was brilliant. I mean, it reminiscent of Warhol, but pretty different, actually, in the execution. So pretty cool. It's kind of like a hat tip to Warhol, but still doing your own thing. Here's another one. Maria Lunstrom and not sure how many.
00:58:10.982 - 00:58:28.904, Speaker A: You know okay, so 50,000 followers. So this person is quite a bit bigger. So pretty interesting piece here. I think we've looked at their work before. Just a nice painting. And here, typewriter works by Frank Singleton, 2023. So new typewriter works, I suppose, by Frank Singleton.
00:58:28.904 - 00:58:49.880, Speaker A: And, you know, typewriter works can be super interesting. I wish I always forget his name. There's a great Arno Beck. Arno Beck makes beautiful typewriter works, by the way, I think Mario brother type. We can look at Arno Beck another episode. But for now, this is everything. Thank you for joining me.
00:58:49.880 - 00:58:52.024, Speaker A: And until next time, take care.
