00:00:04.640 - 00:00:23.614, Speaker A: Welcome, all new subscribers. We have broken through 700. I think we are at 07:02. Nothing like a little controversy to juice up the numbers, I guess. Welcome back, everyone. Artist Journal Friday, March 10, 2023. Broadcasting to the world from Berlin, Germany, where the snow has melted.
00:00:23.614 - 00:00:42.230, Speaker A: My name is Adrian Pokebelli. Look at this fantastic work by Coda Nakazono. A wonderful, super cool work. I, you know, I'm kind of back to the margins. It's the weirdest thing ever. I talk about that with Santiago's kind of pollock like pieces. I was talking about it with Michael Macasso's piece.
00:00:42.230 - 00:01:21.134, Speaker A: And shout out to Michael Macasso, I'm gonna, this is gonna be a shorter episode. And that's for you, Michael, as well as for me and everybody who's involved here. But the, you know, this great margin here, this pixelated, chunky, pixelated margin, it really, just, for me, it just sets the stage so beautifully. And there's just something about this piece that is so attractive to me. And there's a lot going on. It's kind of distilled a lot of what coda has been doing. And we'll take a quick look at just kind of the big picture on his page there.
00:01:21.134 - 00:02:04.754, Speaker A: And even these great brushstrokes kind of like, it distills, like, the augmented reality biomorphic forms. But again, I don't know what it is. Sometimes white as a color in painting, or like, really light colors can be extremely powerful. Like, I was watching, I was at the Michael Margeras show here at Cave Institute, KW Institute in Berlin about two months ago. Michael Margeras, who a lot of you might know, and there was a video of his assistant who in the back in the eighties, and was saying, Michael really likes light colors. He's mixing colors. He's like, Michael really likes light colors because he thinks they look better.
00:02:04.754 - 00:02:26.900, Speaker A: And that's kind of what I think of when I see these kind of, this really nice margin. I just feel like it's like a beautiful trading card or something. So anyways, very nice work. The market loves it. These sold for two tezos each in like two minutes. So if you blinked, you missed it. Third channel picked up a few.
00:02:26.900 - 00:03:01.096, Speaker A: Yeah, people knew Sam Bankman, fried picked up a couple. The account known as SBF. Anyway, and look, Lorna Mills goes in for 20 tezos on secondary. So, yeah, I mean, people love this work, and deservedly, there's just something about it. It just hits you kind of like that work from Michael Macasso yesterday that we opened with. It just hits and you know, we can rationalize it all we want, and sometimes it just hits. So this is Koda Nakazono's other work, so we can just sort of see.
00:03:01.096 - 00:03:17.600, Speaker A: And we've been tracking, actually, a lot of this evolution. It's over here, too. This one's only available for ten. I mean, I don't think it hits quite like the colors here. Everything. The chemistry on this one is incredible. But here is another version of this.
00:03:17.600 - 00:03:44.234, Speaker A: I didn't even see that. Probably a lot of people didn't see that. So, anyways, it's just beautiful what Coda is doing, and it continues to really be interesting. We're going to look at this piece here, too. Continuum number 71, where you can almost see the Photoshop canvas bleeding through at the bottom here. So again, just kind of conflating a lot of, what I would call, loosely, digitalia. And again, this great.
00:03:44.234 - 00:04:38.624, Speaker A: We've seen that with. What is the name of that wonderful artist that works on. I'm not going to say the artist, because I can't believe I can't remember his name, but these beautiful gradients that kind of work as the frame. So, anyways, this is beautiful and interesting. And again, just conflating all of these different elements, again, kind of reminiscent, somewhat conceptually, to Santiago's work, where he's taking all of these different digital elements and kind of smushing them together, processing them through his little meat grinder. Digital meat grinder. This is a slightly different approach, but again, I feel like, conceptually, as different as the works are, they still, you know, they could hang in the same show maybe a couple of rooms apart, you know? So anyways, Coda, Nakazono, some really cool work.
00:04:38.624 - 00:05:04.444, Speaker A: Big shout out to a couple of people here. First to people of Tezos. Piero at people of Tezos, who runs a very tight ship. It was an incredible experience from start to ending, from him approaching and inviting people, to people of Tezos, like myself. And I was thrilled to be invited. And it was just such a smooth communication from the very start. Him suggesting.
00:05:04.444 - 00:05:16.662, Speaker A: I put out a tweet, just all of it. He shepherded that whole process, and I didn't even bring it up. I think they were at the top. Let's just look here. I don't know. Yeah, look. And then not.
00:05:16.662 - 00:05:58.246, Speaker A: So Shepherd's a beautiful process. And then people of Tezos has raised 10,865 tezos at the top of the charts. So not only runs a beautifully communicated, you know, organized operation, and then to cap it off, the cherry on the icing on the cake is you're at the top of the charts. So I just can't say enough positive things about Piero at people of Tezos, just in my personal experience here. And big shout out to marching square and to all the bidders here. I was thrilled to see people bid on this work and everything. So I'm just really pleased.
00:05:58.246 - 00:06:17.162, Speaker A: And I looked at Marching Square's account because I wasn't familiar with it and I'll show you what I found. So generative artist, software engineer. I was like, okay, cool. Like a lot of generative art. And there's twelve pages. This is the first page. And here's some of the more recent generative art.
00:06:17.162 - 00:06:46.518, Speaker A: I thought, okay, this is cool. And so I'm like, what about the Twitter? And then I go to the Twitter and this is a lesson to all of us. Generative artist object.com co founder right? So we've been discussing this for, you know, we discussed it on the spaces a few weeks ago. You never know who's watching, right? And so how cool is that? Object.com co founder is picking up the work. So big shout out to Marching Square.
00:06:46.518 - 00:07:19.020, Speaker A: Thank you. It makes my day and I think it's just totally awesome. One of the co founders of object yet, you know, so that's super cool. Again, moral of the story for all of us here is you never know who's watching. Right? Continuing on, so back to this Clare silver thing, which hopefully we can just kind of tie a bow on today and put it behind us. Pelizard Volpito actually just put out this comment and I thought it was, I wanted to share it. And we have a couple of more as well.
00:07:19.020 - 00:07:53.428, Speaker A: People have different reactions to the whole thing and so let's just get into it quickly here. I love your show, Adrian, but I think you're being a little too harsh with Clare Silver here. First of all, it must be said that the louvre is not a contemporary art setting. Those who run it often despise all contemporary art and do not even consider it art. Now the point here, I think, is that Parisians don't go shopping at the carousel. That is for tourists who have just been to the museum. Now, if some of them are exposed to NFTs when they're still in quote unquote, art mode, can be considered a net positive for the sector, don't you think? Well, absolutely.
00:07:53.428 - 00:08:32.774, Speaker A: Like, I think it's great that there is a NFT show at the, right outside the Louvre, you know, in, you know, as you go through. And while they're still in art mode. Yeah. So again, and there's actually a couple of good comments, like one person mentioned, and we'll look at that little excerpt there in the comments coming up. But it's no one, let's not dunk on Clare Silver. And that is not the intention here. But, yeah, I mean, to me, this is sort of avoiding the issue, though, which, like, we might know that, we might know that, that the Louvre is not a contemporary setting.
00:08:32.774 - 00:09:14.224, Speaker A: But the problem is, is a lot of people might not know that. And then it becomes like a miseducation of sorts is one way of looking at it, you know? So anyways, I appreciate the comment, though, and I'm really thrilled that you liked the show. And yeah, I don't want to dwell on the Claire Silver thing, but it was a pretty interesting conversation to be had, you know, because I think it speaks somewhat to the culture. And maybe it's just, you know, at the end of the day, it's kind of all about shining a light on things. At least this is me from, you know, my platonist background. It's like, let's just discuss it, shed some light on it, and then move on. Like, we don't need to dwell on it.
00:09:14.224 - 00:09:40.360, Speaker A: People had other reactions, too. I thought exicentra a little harsh, and let's just read what people had to say. Not everybody, but just a couple of excerpts here. What a disaster for Claire. So this is what happens when you have a bunch of amateurs rallying around an artist not themselves familiar with the space. And this is what I wanted to highlight, though. She's a poverty to fame story, so I'm not dunking on her for not knowing the ways of fine art.
00:09:40.360 - 00:10:29.094, Speaker A: And this is really, like, yeah, like, that is not the intention here. So I think it's kind of a, and it's nothing to dwell on. And I don't think anybody should be worried too much about it just is what it is. Right? So I just like the spirit of this comment here, but the people around them often end up causing a pr disaster and make her a laughing stock. And, yeah, that is, this is the risks that you run, you know, back to Pelizard. I mean, this is why it's important to be accurate. And this could be even just a good lesson that Claire might think to herself, like, okay, I need to make sure I get my communications in order, you know? And so anyways, and there's Todd Levin here.
00:10:29.094 - 00:10:57.424, Speaker A: This is the equivalent of the nice restaurant. I mean, this is a harsher comment inside of MoMA called the modern, asking to display your NfT on a wall near their diners, and then you claim your NfT was exhibited at MoMA. And frankly, it's hard to disagree with the logic of this. So that's kind of the issue, I would say to Pelizard. But, yeah, so let's just tie the bow on this. And if nothing else happens, then nothing else happens. Of course, if something does, you know, I'm all over that.
00:10:57.424 - 00:11:19.664, Speaker A: Anyways, thank you for the comments, everybody. I learned from that. Especially, again, I really like that sentiment. Like, you know, especially if she did come from poverty to fame and like, yeah, let's just. I don't know the stories, though, so I don't know the background there. Will disposed, I think, is how we pronounce that. Cherubs.
00:11:19.664 - 00:11:52.736, Speaker A: Remember, perhaps yesterday I was trying to remember the name of these kind of cupid like figures. They are called cherubs. So thank you, will disposed. And, you know, famously in this Raphael here, and we're going to look at the big one in a second, a celestial winged being with human, animal or bird like characteristics, who functions as a throne bearer of the deity. So we have a. So that's Encyclopedia Britannica. It's interesting how Google is actually using encyclopedia Britannica here, because then Wikipedia is underneath it.
00:11:52.736 - 00:12:25.054, Speaker A: A cherub is one of the unearthly beings who directly attend to God according to abrahamic religions. So interesting. And then this definition here is from Wikipedia. It's interesting to see how Google presents these definitions, isn't it? So this is in the Sistine Madonna. Now, this painting here, it's a late Raphael, later. Raphael died in 1520 at age 37, from my understanding. And so the painting was commissioned in 1512.
00:12:25.054 - 00:12:50.074, Speaker A: So Raphael died in 1520. And this was commissioned in 1512 for the church of San Sisto Piazzenza and probably executed 1513. 1514. The canvas was one of the last madonnas painted by Raphael. Giorgio Vasari called it, quote, a truly rare and extraordinary work. So this work here, and I brought up a big version of it. It's actually at the Gemalde gallery here in Berlin.
00:12:50.074 - 00:13:30.692, Speaker A: And Gemelde is german for painting. So if you ever visit Germany, you know, the Gemalde gallery is often where you'll find the old masters and that sort of thing. So this exists here. And you see the mastery of Raphael, even the treatment of the baby Jesus here. And I mean, you see the influence of Michelangelo, too. I mean, in this almost muscular, I would argue, who knows? And here, of course, are the cherubs. So the adjective that often gets used for Raphael is sweet, you know, and you see the sweetness here in the sentiment and just all of it in the.
00:13:30.692 - 00:13:57.066, Speaker A: Look at this. I mean, this is kind of a very famous kind of, you know, profile, let's call it in Raphael here. And you gotta love. I was almost thinking this is almost like a tazos work in the background with these ghost like figures. And look at St. Barbara, just immaculately painted here. So anyways, that is just so there they are at the bottom because we often see this cropped.
00:13:57.066 - 00:15:00.798, Speaker A: It's in the sistine Madonna, which is actually in the Gmailde gallery in Berlin. Also on the Renaissance tip obliquely here, zero, zero, nine, e. Here's another useful bit of info I learned early on from one of my mentors. If you're a digital artist, flipping a canvas in Photoshop, illustrator, or using a mirror as a trad artist while painting or sketching can be helpful for improving the composition and perspective of your art. So I do believe if you go in Leonardo's sketchbooks, actually, when you, they're often kind of these, you'll find books in the bookstore where they'll group all of his notes, say, on painting and his notes on engineering, which is very convenient, I believe in the notes. This is a Leonardo technique where you turn it upside down and then you see how it works and you see like does. How does the painting feel? Is it balanced just as to get a completely different view on your work.
00:15:00.798 - 00:15:29.010, Speaker A: So zero, zero, nine has kind of a similar idea where you flip the canvas, I assume, like 180 degrees or just kind of horizontally. So interesting. Very interesting. And here's the lenticular print. I feel like this might be another image of it. So I thought it was kind of interesting. And this reminds me, actually, I am reminding myself here, I went to a generative art exhibition in Berlin yesterday.
00:15:29.010 - 00:15:54.558, Speaker A: I hope I remember I have the images ready to show you. So I took a few pictures for the show, actually. Anyways, so here is that lenticular print in action again. And just super interesting by Stalamere. Also, Mikey de la Creme, also known as Mikey Wilson. His event, Camp Creme is starting on Monday. So March 13 to 17th on object.com
00:15:54.558 - 00:16:24.966, Speaker A: camp Creme. So a wonderful collector, community member, great guy. What is Camp Creme? An open invitation to the entire community to mint a piece of art that is based on the camp aesthetic as defined in Susan Sontag's essay, notes on camp. So in my, you know, universe, this is an awesome opportunity to read this essay. I don't think I've ever read it. I haven't had a Susan Sontag book in my library for actually probably ten years, but I used to. I think it was on photography.
00:16:24.966 - 00:17:03.998, Speaker A: So anyways, he even provides a link to it. So I just think that's great. And camp will be open March 13 to March 17 simply meant a piece using the hashtag camp creme during those dates. To join the fun, decide your own edition size pricing and there's going to be works by Bezaya. I am the Astra, Lily Illo, von Doyle and Moda Mt. So how cool is that? Speaking of cool, so Lily Illo is minting on Cardano. How crazy is that? So I guess they have, like, I don't know enough about Cardano that I didn't realize they actually had working.
00:17:03.998 - 00:17:28.704, Speaker A: I guess I did kind of have a vague idea that they had working marketplaces, but look at this. Let me just show you. Honored to be on the homepage of Dropspot IO today with two new works I dropped this week on Cardano for IWD 2023 and NFT. Like a queen dresser reflection was collected by a wonderful human. Please reach out if you see this post. So super cool. And these look beautiful.
00:17:28.704 - 00:18:13.754, Speaker A: So congratulations to Lily Illo. And how cool is that? I mean, I was just thinking to myself yesterday, I was looking on, I think, the u bond there. I was just like dot NFT marketplaces and I didn't really find anything that I felt like I could mint on Polkadot. I mean, but I'm, you know, just like she's on Cardano. I love this idea of like, whatever cryptos you think might, you know, really do well in the long term of kind of being one of those early people in. And even if not, I think it's kind of fun to just like, oh, here's a few works on Phantom, here's a few works on Cardano, a little series here. Kind of just add some spice to your whole, you know, oeuvre, as they would say.
00:18:13.754 - 00:18:40.586, Speaker A: And you can probably guess the artist here die with the most likes is announcing. I don't know if announcing is the right word. First look at Escher XYz logo. So a little bit of satire, I assume, discussing in con air right now. So anyways, die with the most likes, I believe based on this tweet here, is going to be launching an edition. And there you can see it right there on Escher. And I've never heard of Escher.
00:18:40.586 - 00:19:01.258, Speaker A: So elevating editions coming soon, powered by Tessera and so yeah, I don't know anything about this, but it sounds interesting. So I'm just bringing it to all our attention here. And so there it is. So a new kind of additional platform. So interesting. So we'll see what happens there. I went to the website and this is it.
00:19:01.258 - 00:19:37.554, Speaker A: So they're keeping things under wraps right now. I thought this was super interesting. So we looked at this work yesterday by complex and it had a lobster in it. And again, I just want to highlight the depth that goes in because we might see illustration of a lobster and just take it at that. But again, back to the depth of the artists in this scene, which I think is as deep as any other scene, contemporary art, for example. And to me, this is just more evidence a popular the delicious main course is lobsters. And here's this person at their Sotheby's auction on top of it.
00:19:37.554 - 00:20:20.800, Speaker A: The delicious main course is lobster, a popular motif in art history, symbolizing indulgence and earthly delight. The vibrant red of a cooked lobster, while often irresistible, also represents the transition from life to death. So pretty interesting. And I went back to the auction just to see what's going on, and it's actually pretty interesting. So this is in Hong Kong dollars here. The new vanguard curated by NFT Asia and one don't knows already has a bid meeting the reserve 25 bids, actually. And so this is at hk$16,000 so I actually brought up what that is.
00:20:20.800 - 00:21:25.910, Speaker A: And 16,000 is $2,038 US. So, you know, I would say relative to super rare prices, that one don't know is sold for which I think is up to three or four ETH, maybe more, you know, so that's six or $7,000 and maybe has done more than that. Right now it's $2,000 at Sotheby's and accepts crypto. So what's so hilarious about that, in my own mind is you could actually bid on a Sotheby's auction if you're in that kind of collector tier where you're willing to spend thousands of dollars on works. And so I just thought it kind of, it was really interesting to contrast the financial side of things and with, say, super rare, because some people think of, you know, we're talking about foundation disrupting super rare. Some people think of super rares disrupting Sotheby's, right? Everybody's getting disrupted here and here's complex with hk$17,000 so maybe, I'm guessing 2100 us with the full on lobster work there. So super cool.
00:21:25.910 - 00:21:47.214, Speaker A: And interesting. Just a couple of other kind of markets stories. Again, I love the markets here and the financial side of things I find fascinating. So, Sabato, what ETH lacks in community, love vibes. It makes up in valuation. Lol. Which is why artists keep coming back.
00:21:47.214 - 00:22:06.835, Speaker A: Here are the numbers. 20 editions of Garcon were minted equals 0.4 ETH. I'm excluding the five editions I minted for myself. Okay, so 20 for 0.4 ETH, considering there was a 10% worlds fee and a 5% platform fee per transaction, that left the open edition with 0.34 ethan.
00:22:06.835 - 00:22:56.464, Speaker A: Which at the current crashy exchange rate is $480. Translating this to tazos. So we're looking at the difference between buying, additions, or selling. Actually, as an artist on ETH versus tazos, when you start to factor in everything, a drawing exercise with an addition of 20 would go for 24 tez each. If you were to translate the ETH situation here into Tez, my last drawing exercise sold for seven Tazo sepop for an addition of 21. So basically, he's saying on ETH, you're getting more bang for your buck in terms of you're getting more money for each edition, right? You're all getting a really great deal here on tezos, not to mention when you factor in gas fee premiums on ETH. And I think we mentioned this yesterday, the.
00:22:56.464 - 00:23:14.718, Speaker A: You know, this is kind of ETH's Achilles heel. It's like. And we, you know, they did the upgrade, and we're still getting gas fee issues. Right. So, you know, and that is the. The alpha on Dot, from what I understand. And I think I mentioned this, like 30 episodes ago, from what I understand.
00:23:14.718 - 00:23:59.078, Speaker A: I watched Gavin. I can't remember Gavin of York, the guy who programmed or put the program programming language for Ethereum and who's behind Dot now. I think the CTO, maybe at the end of an interview, he was basically saying, the real magic of Dot is you're not going to have. There's going to be a way for you not to have to pay fees because of these kind of layer zero situations. So you can just use it like the regular Internet and there being no fees. So that's why I'm curious about Dot, because if that's the case, that could be a major, you know, a major disruption, to use a cliche here in the crypto space. But I'm getting off topic here anyways.
00:23:59.078 - 00:24:33.734, Speaker A: So there is Garcon. And just interesting to compare the finances. And finally, this work here by Yuri J. Went for 300 tezos which is a pretty nice price here to Dan Cube. So interesting situation here too because I think a lot of us wonder, okay, what are the best ways to sell your work, especially a one of one created an auction for 200 tezos, no takers lists for 300 and then basically four or 5 hours later sells. So interesting. So hangout by Uri J sells for 300.
00:24:33.734 - 00:25:03.840, Speaker A: Somehow I missed this work. Rosatio who I was looking at the details of these, the balloon dogs by koons here reference and so we never looked at the full picture here. And yeah so you have an egg going through it. So anyways just another beautiful work by rosatio. It is for half an ETH reserve and it's listed in lucid dreaming. I'm not sure if that's a world we can quickly look. So just a cool work by rosatio minted a week ago.
00:25:03.840 - 00:25:25.012, Speaker A: So yeah, this totally flew under the radar for me. But yeah, I love looking at Rosatio's work and it's in a world. Here it is lucid dreaming curated by Crucifer. So here we go again. And this great work here. So some nice curation going on from Crucifer sold one. So a lot of excitement here with the worlds.
00:25:25.012 - 00:26:12.214, Speaker A: And so continuing with the painting here, a really nice piece. I don't think I showed this called belladonna by Sumi Sumireusi and again I might have looked at this on Twitter where we see that kind of AI looking rainbow. We may have looked at this but for some reason it was minted as a one of one here for 777 and I just don't remember that. So I'm showing it here potentially again. And so anyways, a really cool sumi work for 777 tezos, which it looks like Tezos is below a dollar. Isn't that crazy? The crypto markets move so fast. Shall we look at Coingecko here and look at Tezos really, really quickly here.
00:26:12.214 - 00:26:38.896, Speaker A: Don't want to get off topic, but it looks like we're below a dollar, $0.97. So that, you know, so that came down pretty quickly in the last like couple of days there. It was just at $1.20 not that long ago. So the volatility of the crypto markets continues. Basquia, a work I think I missed by Bazaya. So kind of a tribute to Basquiat, one would think.
00:26:38.896 - 00:27:02.812, Speaker A: And this sold for 0.2. So pretty good deal for renaissance X who won this bid for who won this auction for Bezaya's tribute to Basquiat so super cool. Gotta love the glasses and this great background. I love the colors. And a really nice tribute too, especially in the hair there. So super cool. So I was curious.
00:27:02.812 - 00:27:22.164, Speaker A: I thought I hadn't seen Bezaya for a while. Just another work I missed. Gloom tube put out a work. This was pretty interesting. So actually a surprisingly complex work, we might say. So here you see these guys fighting in a target parking lot. And we'll look at the title here in a second and you see the selfie stick.
00:27:22.164 - 00:28:03.628, Speaker A: So let's go back. Target audience or chat snitches on a live streamer. So I was trying to figure this out and I think I know what goes on. What went on. So these look like target employees, right? And they're getting in a fight with this live streamer here who seems to be the guy with the phone and the other, you know, the selfie stick here. So this is probably the live streamer. And I'm assuming based on the title, that the people in the chat for this guy that's streaming let target know that this guy is streaming inside of target and then they're throwing him out or something like that.
00:28:03.628 - 00:28:25.148, Speaker A: The guy with the crocs. So anyway, you know, pretty complex work here. A lot. You know, as far as what we might call narrative painting, there's a lot going on in this painting. There's a lot of story in this painting. And I think here the title is essential because. Because if you don't know, you would never know that the chat snitched on the live streamer from the image.
00:28:25.148 - 00:28:51.098, Speaker A: So the title fulfills a very important function there. A couple of other works by Gloomtube on foundation and I will continue to run through the episode here. This sold for 37 ETH. So in an auction, and this was March 6. So I believe I missed this actual nightmare is what it's called. Almost like a trading card. So interesting works being put out by gloom tube on foundation.
00:28:51.098 - 00:29:14.214, Speaker A: This 55515. Kind of mysterious, isn't it? This sold for 33. And this is on March 10. So this is this morning and this is actually still for auction. So gloom tube is starting to catch a bid, you might say, on foundation now that people know he's out there. That first person, I think, got it for 0.2. Got it really cheap.
00:29:14.214 - 00:29:42.006, Speaker A: The first gloom tube there, I believe, or this one here. So maybe it was in between at 0.22. Anyway, interesting kind of trading card. Like works with this, 55515 from Gloomtube. So super cool. This is like the work of Mist, the episode of missed works. Here is one from Mimocat, and this was listed January 31, and I don't think I ever saw this.
00:29:42.006 - 00:30:09.666, Speaker A: So only for point one ETH. And Mimocat, of course, is a great painter, digital painter on the object platform, and also his great works on foundation. And here's another one, and this interesting heart here. So, anyway, point one ETH, and this just totally flew under the radar here. Sometimes Satan is your own mind, but you have a beautiful heart. Let your heart speak and determine the path. Don't let the demon control you.
00:30:09.666 - 00:30:30.474, Speaker A: Hand drawn 4000 by 4000. So cool work, as ever. Speaking of cool work, apocalypse by Ed Morolla. Love the colors in this work. You know, there's something about this work. It's sort of like Ed Marolla's. All his tropes, for lack of better word, his.
00:30:30.474 - 00:31:03.862, Speaker A: All his little stylistic ideas. The kind of jPEG, the artifact, like pixelation or pixel art with artifacts in it, almost kind of blurred out in different kinds. And then the color, it's not your typical purple, right, of Ed Marolla. So, you know, the color is really great. And then you see the. Whatever you call this gradient, these pixel gradients that is escaping me right now. It's a word I totally know.
00:31:03.862 - 00:31:36.020, Speaker A: But anyways, I just think this is a beautiful work. And then it's called apocalypse. And then you have these, you know, skulls and monsters and everything. There's almost something kind of cave painting, like, in this work. It's almost like, you know, and you even get, like, the rhinoceros, you know, here, this almost looks like the cave of Lascaux with, like, the, you know, the drawings on it, you know, those astonishing caves there, and here's a big monster. It's kind of reminiscent a little bit. Hey, so anyway, it's just really beautiful work here.
00:31:36.020 - 00:32:08.070, Speaker A: Edition of 50 for four tazos, and. Yeah, so just really, really attractive work. A tez noun by axin. So this is at auction. This is a one of one. So the Tez nouns have been doing really well, and. Yeah, so I guess they got an artist edition, and this time the artist is axin doing his trademark, you know, laser like coming thing coming out of the mouth or drooling, you know, pixel drooling pixels, shall we say? A little bit there, too.
00:32:08.070 - 00:32:50.782, Speaker A: Anyways, cool auxing work, doing the Tez nouns at auction for 500 tezos, so pretty cool. I think we missed this one in the tes vending machine when I was going through all of them, because I didn't recognize this one broken machine. This is an addiction addition of six. And you know, with skulls in a vending machine here. So almost a reference to the tes vending machine and a little homunculi or small figure here. And interestingly again, that kind of trademark leaking from the machine here into a pool around the Tes vending machine, which could be in a subway station in Berlin. One broken machine, more skulls.
00:32:50.782 - 00:33:22.594, Speaker A: Thought this would pair well. So slave angel with a addition, I believe because we see the multiples here on foundation. Click round. And this is very cheap at 0069 ETH, three minted only and 4 hours left. So if you're watching this, you might be, if you watch it right away after it's posted, you might be able to run and pick up one of these for very cheap. So that is cool. And a work by Sabato, open edition on ETH.
00:33:22.594 - 00:33:41.754, Speaker A: So Sabato is putting out a lot of work in a lot of ways. I love it. I love when so much work is coming out from an artist that you can't even keep track. I think it's really fun. So it's like, where is this one? Open editions on ETH. Inherent malice. Two, zombie formalism, which we're discussing in a spaces is winding down tonight at midnight.
00:33:41.754 - 00:34:10.216, Speaker A: Only four editions so far minted at ETH, made with mid journey, dpaint and Photoshop. So kind of reminiscent of the video game work that we're looking at earlier this week. This work plays off of Walter Robinson's famous takedown of zombie formalism. So yeah, this was a controversial art movement. And so here you see Sabato's piece. And actually I think here's the addition, zombie formalism. Total minted six.
00:34:10.216 - 00:34:31.244, Speaker A: This ended 6 hours ago. So six were. And we'll look at it very quickly if it loads up. We shall see. And we'll just try one more time here. And this is special edition to go along with the deepfake exhibition at super chief gallery. Okay, so very cool.
00:34:31.244 - 00:35:01.432, Speaker A: So here it is now, witness the art movement of horror. So making fun of the name a little bit, making light of the name. And here's some stills probably again created with mid journey, but then treated with d paint. So with deluxe paint. So very, very, very interesting here. So always interesting and fun from Sabato. I thought for those that haven't heard of this and maybe it's a good refresher for those that have.
00:35:01.432 - 00:35:40.040, Speaker A: So he was mentioning Walter Robinson actually in that description. In 2014, the artist and critic Walter Robinson coined the phrase zombie formalism to describe a new trend in abstract painting. Early career painters like Oscar Murillo, Lucian Smith and Seth Price experienced a meteoric rise in the art market for their gestural abstract works. And so, yeah, so here on artsy. So here's actually where that description came from. Their paintings were purchased from galleries, then quickly resold at auction for much higher sums. While the market for zombie formalism cooled around 2016, many of these artists continued to make waves.
00:35:40.040 - 00:36:14.474, Speaker A: And so anyways, so some of them have kind of cooled off, some have continued to do well. Here's Lucian Smith's made with a fire hydrant, or, sorry, a fire extinguisher. These are very kind of. And Parker Edo was another one. So anyways, just always good to ground ourselves in contemporary art and the traditional here. So here is another example of basically what's going on out there, because it's just full of ideas for us to feed off of. And look at this work by Santiago, which is super interesting.
00:36:14.474 - 00:36:57.830, Speaker A: So maybe a rare animated work from Santiago, GIF, made with many online free tools and free trials and with Gimp and a remarkably small image for San Diego. And I remember Santiago, he's in Uruguay, as my girlfriend corrected me on the pronunciation. Santiago is in Uruguay and has often said that he really likes tools. He sat in a space at one point like Gimp, because they're free. He likes the free tools from just a conceptual point of view, which is pretty interesting. Take again, just showing what I would call sophistication here. Magnet choreography of brave proteins.
00:36:57.830 - 00:37:31.154, Speaker A: So here is the work. Interesting abstract work. I'm not sure if this might be an older work, but I thought, what the. Hey, let's just stick it in here. Continuum by Nicholas Sassoon. And I almost feel like maybe we looked at this like, a month ago, but I saw it on Twitter and I thought, you know, I just think it's an interesting work and it's good to return and not just do everything new. And so anyways, kind of paired well with Santiago's work there, too, courtesy of bright opportunities, collecting and commissioning work by emerging artists in the gen art movement.
00:37:31.154 - 00:38:07.556, Speaker A: And I will remember at the end of this episode, to show you the pictures from last night, actually, that I took. I went to a little show of Gen art, the side hustle. Here it is made with graphics, too. So a side hustle with a new work. And I found this kind of edgy because got rid of all the color and just made it this kind of rough black and white work. And I thought it was just kind of an edgy, bold, interesting decision, because the easy decision would be, oh, of course, you add color and of course, aesthetically it's going to be easier to consume. But what I see here is side hustle challenging us.
00:38:07.556 - 00:38:43.330, Speaker A: And I love that. That tells me, again, it's just ongoing theme of, it just shows to, to me the sophistication of me. This scene here, we're being challenged, you know, what I'd say would be the unsophisticated way of looking at this as like, oh, well, where's the color? You know? And I'm guilty of that sometimes. This is another interesting piece. This is by Bowles. Big shout out to Bowles, who we see on Twitter and leaving comments between the show. And here's just an interesting work as the sands of time bites 3000 by 2000, based on island of the Dead by Arnold Bocklin.
00:38:43.330 - 00:38:58.794, Speaker A: And we're going to look at that. Another historical work that we'll look at. So here is Bull's version of island of the Dead. And Island of the Dead was a very beloved painting by the surrealists. This is an edition of three. Let me just look. Sold out for three tezos.
00:38:58.794 - 00:39:15.932, Speaker A: So almost free there. And so this is the work. So you can actually see the comparison here. And there are many different versions. So this, you know, the surrealists love this work. It's kind of, you know, I would have guessed this is a romantic work. Capital R romantic.
00:39:15.932 - 00:39:50.174, Speaker A: And I almost feel like you could still categorize it as such. But the reality is, is this was made in 1880 and most romanticism was 100 years earlier. Like, I'd say at earliest, 1780 to maybe 1830, at least from a literary perspective. With William Blake, there were six of these guys. Maybe I won't try and list them all, but all to say. And then ending with John Keats, maybe in like, 1820, so, or 1830, who died super young, but an insanely good poet. So anyways, here is island of the dead.
00:39:50.174 - 00:40:20.150, Speaker A: And again, the surrealist Max Ernst Breton would reference this painting as being just a great painting. And there are many versions that Arnold Bocklin made. So let's just look at a quick description. Is the best isle of the dead in German, de Totten Insel. The Dead island. The island of the Dead is the best known painting of swiss symbolist Arnold Bocklin. Prints were very popular in central Europe in the early 20th century.
00:40:20.150 - 00:40:50.414, Speaker A: Vladimir Nabokov observed in his 1936 novel despair that they could be found in every Berlin home. So really just captures. It's just one of those works that has captured the imaginations of basically everyone. Bocklin produced several different versions of the painting between 1880 and 1901, which today are exhibited in Basel, New York City, Berlin and Leipzig. I believe that's in the Alte National Galerie here in Berlin on Museum Island. Museum Insel. So a little bit of german today.
00:40:50.414 - 00:41:33.884, Speaker A: So anyways, this is actually. And it's talking about the meaning, and this is interesting. Bocklin himself provided no public explanation as to the meaning of the painting, though he did describe it as a dream picture. It must produce such a stillness that one would be awed by a knock on the door, end quote. The title, which was conferred upon it by art dealer Fritz Gurlitt in 1883, was not specified by Buckland, though it does derive from a phrase in an 1880 letter he sent to the paintings original commissioner. So anyways, you see all the different versions here, five versions, and I think they actually have the island. Maybe that was a possible inspiration here.
00:41:33.884 - 00:42:13.390, Speaker A: And another one. So, I mean, pretty impressive actually. Like Wikipedia for art history is not too bad at all. And here is the painting. So anyways, don't want to get too deep in this, but this is just such a famous work and Bowles is referencing it here. I thought, you know, let's look at this work and know what we're all dealing with here. Continuing on, another work by demon ego with this kind of different series here, with kind of very giphy series, with a lot of like, you know, almost web art type iconography, mouse cursors, whatnot.
00:42:13.390 - 00:42:36.102, Speaker A: So anyways, just another interesting work, hallucination of living in the belly of a monster. And I see we are. I'm going to run through the rest of this episode p one with just a cool pixel artwork here. Dithering. That is the word I am trying to remember. Dithering with some nice dithering in the background there. So just another cool work by p one flora Marquez.
00:42:36.102 - 00:42:54.708, Speaker A: The latest. I will take care of a plant that my grandmother used to take care of. And again, just super fun. And the plant and the table are coming to life. So super cool again. Probably sold for 17 tezos to not a number. Shout out to Nan and Padrino.
00:42:54.708 - 00:43:14.292, Speaker A: I missed this. This is the episode of missed works. March 3. A self portrait PFP for creme de la creme and the vanguard. So there is Padrino, upstanding member of the Tezos and NFT art community, who has begun making works. So here is a self portrait. So very cool.
00:43:14.292 - 00:43:42.272, Speaker A: Interesting pattern in the background there too. So nice illustration. Exmortal with another work and of course, we saw that awesome Polaroid yesterday. And now we have someone sitting cross legged at a tv. So playing a little bit with the. I don't know if I'd call it symbolism, but just with the concept here and then a hand reaching out. So almost like this is no longer just an object.
00:43:42.272 - 00:44:03.568, Speaker A: There's a bit of a narrative here is what I'm trying to say. So just kind of interesting. Eizo comes back with a new modern furniture series, another future dinner table. So this is similar to the last one, but different future dinner table. Two for five Tezos edition of 35. And they are selling. So 22 left.
00:44:03.568 - 00:44:29.984, Speaker A: Get it while you can. Another modern furniture work from Ezo, which we love, Jose Gasparian. So who collaborated with MCHX on this work here. And I thought it was really interesting to just see on the series. And I thought it was just really interesting how they're showing it on an iPad, which I think is really cool. And so half of them have been minted, so there's still some left. A twelve tezos a piece.
00:44:29.984 - 00:44:42.400, Speaker A: So that is on FX hash. And here's a work by don't be so Vasya. So maybe Vasya. Don't be so Vasya. This was just a gn. Goodnight. And I'm not sure it's.
00:44:42.400 - 00:45:16.572, Speaker A: I'm not sure if it's new or not, but I've never looked at it here. And again, kind of reminds me of. I don't know if it's varia who does kind of a combination of digital painting with sampled brushes and AI almost has a graphica Png look in the cloud. So anyways, all those artists I'm starting to group together in my mind because they just seem to go beautifully together. And we'll look at Graphica PNG in a future episode for sure. We have to keep up to date on what they are working on. Sabato and Sky Goodman collaborated, so that is exciting too.
00:45:16.572 - 00:45:32.980, Speaker A: Sabato all over this episode. Tread on everything. Opalescent highs. So a lost sneaker collaboration from two of the very well known artists on the Tezos blockchain here with a beautiful color. Look at this. Interesting. So I wonder if this is.
00:45:32.980 - 00:46:20.432, Speaker A: My guess is Sabato probably glitched out this bottom area. How cool is that? So you know, two artists that work with glitch and Sabato, that's a pretty cool idea where if Sabato just wants to remix and then maybe just plays with the file a little bit, I mean, pretty cool data bent, right? WebP image format data bending glitch by Sabato Visconti. So pretty cool collaboration, sold out and a beautiful work by images of the week. Continuing with this AI kind of collage series. And again just creating these kind of Robert Rauschenberg like compositions. Here is what I see, but totally original and I just think these are gorgeous and I think these are still available. Five tazos edition of six.
00:46:20.432 - 00:46:46.224, Speaker A: There's one left, so maybe I'll pick that up. Let's see. Lily Illo so this finished, I believe this work here, we were looking at it in progress. So again, it's really cool to see an AI artist in progress. So Lily Illo continues to make just beautiful work with beautiful colors and just beautiful combination of shapes and everything. So it's beautiful. A most brave man.
00:46:46.224 - 00:47:08.232, Speaker A: Finito. So it is finished. Shout out to Lily Illo who is also all over this episode. And here a preview of the new one of one going to auction on Tuesday, the 14 march on object.com as part of the camp creme with creme de la creme description of this piece below. So there it is. And just another beautiful AI work from Lily Illo.
00:47:08.232 - 00:47:36.092, Speaker A: Great colors. AI pathway. So lightness by ilay this is another work by Ilay with these beautiful, beautiful textures here working with the circles. So this is still available. Low edition of ten for two and there are two left. So pretty nice work. And can't posted this work by Ivano Moft is the Ilya Muft is the name of the artist.
00:47:36.092 - 00:48:01.154, Speaker A: So just a cool work. Posted by Kant, who you'll often hear from in the spaces. Shout out to Kant and yeah, just really cool AI work. It looks like tapestry or something and almost has a classical feeling to it. So this is some of Ilya Muft's other work. So just a really cool artist and that is almost your show. Let me just show you very quickly the show from yesterday.
00:48:01.154 - 00:48:41.850, Speaker A: So bright moments. This was a lot of work of FX hash I think was on the screens here. I didn't really know anyone or anything about it, but I came in, had a beer before going off to watch old Elvis Presley videos at a friend's place in Las Vegas, which are epic and I highly recommend. Anyways, representing abstraction was the name of the show and this is part of Berlin Gen Art Month, so that's pretty cool with FX hash Dspace Berlin. So anyways, here is just a little bit of the show and how everything was shown and everything. So just a little bit, a little taste of Berlin here and with that. That is your show.
00:48:41.850 - 00:48:46.514, Speaker A: Have a great weekend, everyone. Thanks for everything. Keep it light until next time. Take care.
