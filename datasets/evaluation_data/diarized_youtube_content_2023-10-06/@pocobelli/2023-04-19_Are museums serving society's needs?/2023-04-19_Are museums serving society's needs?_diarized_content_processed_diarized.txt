00:00:20.960 - 00:00:59.634, Speaker A: How are museums doing? Co host Rune Thun met up with Doctor Virgin at the Museum of Modern Art a couple of weeks ago and I've been looking forward to hearing the whole story, which they are going to share with us today. Artist Journal, April 19, 2023. Broadcasting live from Berlin and New York City and probably Florida, where doctor version is on rug radio via Twitter spaces. My name is Adrian Pokebelli and we welcome back co host, artist and conversationalist to the show Rune tune. How are things going?
00:01:00.384 - 00:01:02.536, Speaker B: I always love your introductions.
00:01:02.720 - 00:01:34.114, Speaker A: I just do it to pump myself up and everybody else, I, you know, half the reason I listened to media, you know, back in Montreal, very short story, back in Montreal, you know, I had broken up with my girlfriend I lived in, or we had broken up, I should say. And I was living by myself and it was my friend the media, you know, and so media for me and, yeah, so these radio shows and everything, that's what this is to me, this is a big radio show, which is kind of hilarious. Anyways, how are things going?
00:01:34.534 - 00:01:50.934, Speaker B: Things are going great. It was a great week. Lots of Tezos people and NFT people in New York this last week. I got to meet up with Doctor version, tried to meet up with Sabato, couldn't link up. Things were just a little too busy for me at that point. But yeah, it's been a very formative week. It's been a lot of fun.
00:01:51.054 - 00:02:01.466, Speaker A: That sounds super cool. I mean, I completely forgot that you're in the same city as NFT New York City. So did you actually go to any events or were you just, who did you meet up with again?
00:02:01.570 - 00:02:23.678, Speaker B: I met up with Doctor version and then from Twitter I saw all kinds of people were there. But, you know, I had to work the whole week and, you know, I reached out to a few people. I reached out to Sabato, reached out to die with the most likes. And then unfortunately die was, you know, headed upstate, so I missed him too bado and I couldn't really. Yeah. Hang out, but it would have been cool. Next time.
00:02:23.846 - 00:02:25.718, Speaker A: Yeah, he's a super nice guy.
00:02:25.846 - 00:02:26.174, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:02:26.214 - 00:02:28.830, Speaker A: Anyway, that would be fun. I'm sure he'll be back.
00:02:29.022 - 00:02:46.654, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, he's. He's in New York all the time and so is Sabato. But I had a great time meeting Doctor Virgin and hanging out. That was a lot of fun. We went to MoMA, followed by Christie's and then we got some tacos and just hung out, talked art all day, which is great.
00:02:46.814 - 00:02:59.766, Speaker A: Well, how cool is that? I didn't even realize you could go to Christie's. I saw the photos of Sabato and the other glitch artists there, curators over at Sophie's. So you can actually walk inside those big doors, I assume?
00:02:59.870 - 00:03:01.486, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I've walked by a.
00:03:01.510 - 00:03:03.030, Speaker A: Few times, but I've never gone in.
00:03:03.062 - 00:03:06.398, Speaker B: Until Doctor version told me to, you know, check it out.
00:03:06.526 - 00:03:20.646, Speaker A: Well, let's bring in doctor version here. Doctor version. Welcome to the show. I'm so glad you guys are willing to do this. I'm thrilled to hear about it. And it kind of brings, like a long overdue topic that we haven't really talked about too much, which is museums. And I think it's kind of fun.
00:03:20.646 - 00:03:24.934, Speaker A: So, you know, you guys provide the perfect opportunity with your visit. So anyways, how are things going?
00:03:25.054 - 00:03:47.510, Speaker C: Great. Thanks for having me this morning. I am decompressing after a week in New York, trying to hit up as much as I can and also my day job meetings. And I kind of coincided that strategically with NFT NYC for the events surrounding it. And there was a ton going on. Super fun. And, you know, meeting up with Rune tune was on the list.
00:03:47.510 - 00:04:09.134, Speaker C: Check that off. I was hoping to run into Sapato. Met him before a few times in Miami and last year at the refraction event, which this year was refraction proof of people. I mean, I could go on and on and I got to go to Sotheby's and. Yeah, I encourage anyone who's in New York. You can just walk in, you know, if there's a private event, obviously. But it's.
00:04:09.134 - 00:04:30.896, Speaker C: I've walked in and I've seen a whole museum show before at Christie's where it's like, damn, they have this Basquiat I've never seen before and it's 16ft wide and there's guards there. It's really a museum experience. So don't be shy. Just walk in anyways. But yeah, that's. That's what's going on with me. To be on the subject with museums.
00:04:30.896 - 00:04:50.790, Speaker C: When I met up with rune tune, so we didn't buy tickets. I texted, I was messaging him the day before, like, whoa, there's like, you have to buy tickets ahead of time. It's timed. And maybe this is a COVID thing where they, like, they only let allow a certain amount of people in at a time. And I was like, we were going to meet at ten. It was. We couldn't get into one or two.
00:04:50.822 - 00:04:51.434, Speaker A: Wow.
00:04:52.054 - 00:05:07.254, Speaker C: So we're like, let's just meet in. Let's just meet up and we'll be there. And I'm sure we'll just get right in. So I don't know if I was late. I think Rooney, you were early. And you're like, you know, sent me a picture of the line around the corner to get into MoMA. And I was like, are we going.
00:05:07.254 - 00:05:08.678, Speaker B: To be able to get in on a Monday?
00:05:08.806 - 00:05:11.968, Speaker C: On a Monday at 10:30 a.m. And in April?
00:05:12.126 - 00:05:14.612, Speaker A: Like, I mean, was it. Yeah, it was like early April.
00:05:14.788 - 00:05:15.508, Speaker B: I mean, that's.
00:05:15.556 - 00:05:20.476, Speaker A: It's. Everybody's traveling. Maybe it was Easter. Was it the Easter long weekend?
00:05:20.620 - 00:05:22.436, Speaker C: It is spring break for a lot of kids.
00:05:22.500 - 00:05:41.996, Speaker A: So maybe it was that. Because that's what I noticed, too. I could not believe it in Italy, you know, how many people were out? And I was like, this is early April. Like, what on earth is June gonna be like? You know? So anyway, so that's super interesting. I can't believe it. I don't know if I've ever seen a lineup outside MoMA. I mean, I haven't been there that many times.
00:05:41.996 - 00:05:44.396, Speaker A: So usually you just kind of waltz in.
00:05:44.500 - 00:05:46.260, Speaker B: Yeah. I've never seen this before.
00:05:46.412 - 00:05:48.516, Speaker A: Fascinating. So the interest is there.
00:05:48.580 - 00:05:48.756, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:05:48.780 - 00:05:53.004, Speaker C: Rune tune. You want to tell us what was the next. Next thing that happened?
00:05:53.044 - 00:06:13.048, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. I mean, we bought our tickets on their website. You know, they have time ticket slots. So even though it was 1030, the earliest ones that we were able to grab were for, I think, one or 130. But we just, you know, gave it a shot, went in, and sure enough, they let us right in at 1030. So that was. That was kind of a relief.
00:06:13.048 - 00:06:45.228, Speaker B: But yeah, we go in, we see the Rafiq Anadal, which I shared in the spaces here. That little, that's a thread kind of detailing some of my thoughts about the exhibit. And I don't know, maybe. Maybe I just kind of misinterpreted this video that MoMA shared about the AI, how to see, like, a machine, which set me up to believe that there was going to be a whole exhibit on AI. But it was really just this one piece by Rafiq and Adal. And the piece is impressive. They crafted it really well.
00:06:45.228 - 00:07:36.158, Speaker B: It's actually just this humongous. It's not a projection, it's a humongous, like, led. I think it's led lights, but these, like, led panels that are connected to whatever computer they have it connected to. And it's just this kind of continuously morphing abstract digital work, which I was kind of confused by because, you know, they set you up to think, okay, well, Rafiq's kind of used the entire collection of MoMA images that are publicly available. It's a little bit over 138,000 images of basically everything in the MoMA collection. And you're thinking to yourself, wow, that's. I mean, it's 200 years worth of art and artifact, and this machine's going through all of that.
00:07:36.158 - 00:08:22.092, Speaker B: And the way I understood it is that the machine was going to kind of take into account all this data, organize it three dimensionally, and kind of fill in the gaps, or what it sees as gaps within each of these images to create its own work of art, or works of art that didn't previously exist. And that's a big undertaking. That's exciting. That got me really excited, but it's really just this one work of art, and it doesn't feel like it's taking into account the entirety of all these images. It feels more like, singular. That was kind of the initial disappointment for me. I mean, at the time doctor version and I were standing there, and it is.
00:08:22.092 - 00:08:44.074, Speaker B: It's really impressive, and we had a lot of fun looking at it. I think we were probably standing in front of it for 15, maybe 20 minutes before we moved on to other things. And it is impressive, and people were definitely flocking towards it. But the more I thought about it afterwards, the more my disappointments set in. I'd like to hear from Doctor version before I say anymore.
00:08:44.204 - 00:08:59.086, Speaker A: Sure, yeah, go for it. Doctor version. Any thoughts? And just a quick aside. I mean, I've read that there are all these paintings put in, but at no point does it look recognizable. I don't know if that ever. If it was ever recognizable to you.
00:08:59.110 - 00:09:16.334, Speaker B: Guys, there were a couple points in its transformation where it felt like, oh, maybe this is a reference to, like, early Jackson Pollock or some abstract expressionism, but at no point did it, like, reference anything outside, just purely abstract stuff.
00:09:16.794 - 00:09:20.322, Speaker A: So, in a sense, had you not, like, had the little write up, you.
00:09:20.338 - 00:09:45.996, Speaker B: Might never have guessed, is that correct? Right. I'm actually like. I mean, there's no way to know. But, like, I wonder what my impression of it would have been if I hadn't been fed that information prior. You know, like, just here's a cool abstract work. No other context, no reference to all this other, you know, I think it would have been a little bit. My expectations would not have been so high.
00:09:46.140 - 00:09:58.364, Speaker A: Well, it's hard not to have huge expectations with a show like that. Doctor version. You've worked a lot in video. So what are your thoughts and when you saw it, because you work pretty abstractly, too. So what are your thoughts on it?
00:09:58.444 - 00:10:50.574, Speaker C: Well, first off, I saw a lot of screens last week, and this is by far the most impressive. Just the quality of it, the depth and the colors, you know? And I would say if I'd walk in and not know anything about it, like I was just going to MoMA, I would be blown away. I mean, it's visually, it's captivating. And I think a lot of the screensaver stuff that people are saying is, like, maybe shows their just interpretation of how they've seen screens in the past. Like, you know, just to say something conceptually about it, that they're taking all these images, it's kind of like this giant sampler of. And sometimes, I think, making the connection to music that the best samples, you don't know what they are, and they're a bunch of samples together, and it makes this other thing. So this is that on steroids and, you know, some crazy science fiction level.
00:10:50.574 - 00:10:52.622, Speaker C: But, you know, I think when I.
00:10:52.638 - 00:10:54.070, Speaker B: See a work of art, I'll look.
00:10:54.102 - 00:11:15.358, Speaker C: At it and I won't read anything about it. I don't care, until I get drawn into it, and then I'll dig further. So I think as you dig further with this, what it's doing, it's pretty crazy. But I would say if I didn't know any of that, I would still love it. You know, it is a little bit Epcot center level, if, you know. Sorry, sorry.
00:11:15.526 - 00:11:16.414, Speaker A: What did you say?
00:11:16.534 - 00:11:37.282, Speaker C: Epcot center. Like, you know, like a theme. Like, you walk in and totally. And. And be like, wow, this is something that maybe it doesn't have the edge or gray writ, but, you know, does. What does a work of art need to have that right? It has a meditative thing, like. Like maybe looking at a Rothko or something, but very much futuristic feeling.
00:11:37.338 - 00:12:01.398, Speaker A: Interesting. It does have a bit of a cotton candy sort of feel to it. Like, here's the thing for the general public to, you know, where everybody can enjoy it from, you know, age two to 92. And that's actually kind of commendable, actually, if you can make a work like that. But on the other side, sometimes, as you say, there's kind of a. I guess the word would be novelty. There's a sense of novelty about it in a negative sense.
00:12:01.398 - 00:12:24.374, Speaker A: Like, oh, here's the latest kind of shiny object. Here's some AI art, you know, and we make a big, as Jerry Saltz put it, just a big lava lamp, so to speak. Now, what do you think about that? I mean, to either of you, what do you think of that criticism? Do you think it's just, you know, and I think maybe Doctor virgin, you mentioned, like, referring to how people see screenshots traditionally, like, I guess you disagree with his assessment.
00:12:24.454 - 00:12:58.694, Speaker B: I didn't read the criticism beforehand, but doctor version told me about Jerry comparing it to a giant lava lamp. And so while I was at the museum, I was very much against that assessment. And then later, when I went home to read the criticism, you know, on the one hand, I felt, okay, yeah, Jerry's maybe a little bit right. There were. There were some missed opportunities is how I feel about it as a whole. I agree with Doctor Virgin. The thing was the most impressive digital work that I've, in terms of just, like, scale craft, all of that.
00:12:58.694 - 00:13:27.166, Speaker B: It was. It was fantastic. But, yeah, there were a lot of missed opportunities. Comparing it to a giant lava lamp, I think, is a little too much. But overall, I was just kind of equally frustrated with the criticism as I was with the artwork for not pushing the conversation forward. It didn't do anything to help me engage with this conversation that we're supposed to be having here with art intersecting new technology, AI.
00:13:27.270 - 00:13:34.310, Speaker A: Fascinating in a sense. There's almost, like, kind of a deflection of the whole conversation and the criticism.
00:13:34.502 - 00:13:35.310, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:13:35.422 - 00:13:44.438, Speaker A: That is fascinating and kind of an avoidance of what's taking place here and kind of coming to terms with that doctor version. Anything to add on that point?
00:13:44.566 - 00:14:33.100, Speaker C: Yeah, definitely. I think Runetun is correct, where the review, to me, felt like clickbait, like, oh, I'm going to pan this thing that's really popular. And then I think, amiss. One thing he didn't. He referenced a few artists, which I didn't know from the early two thousands, but someone he didn't reference in his review, which I think is like, how could you not give this connection, is Ryoji Akita. He's an artist that uses data and sound and black and white and, like, zero and one and giant scale projections, immersive experiences. I saw something at the Park Avenue Armory maybe ten years ago, and I think that is farther along than this feet piece in a way, maybe not in how it's put together, and it's not using AI, but that was incredible.
00:14:33.100 - 00:14:51.828, Speaker C: And, like, a little bit more holy. You're really immersed into this thing, and it's a little bit more challenging. So, yeah, I disagree. And then, you know, Jerry Saltz, I mean, I. I haven't read any of his stuff. You know, I've read reviews over the years, but maybe this shows his relationship with technology.
00:14:51.916 - 00:14:56.904, Speaker A: I was gonna say maybe it shows his age, but then I thought maybe you're. You're trying to put it more artfully.
00:14:57.804 - 00:15:04.886, Speaker C: Yeah, but I, you know, I've seen posts I really don't understand. Like, you make a cup of coffee and stuff like that. Like, I know it's kind of a.
00:15:04.910 - 00:15:25.902, Speaker A: Joke, you know, you might be onto something. You know, maybe it does have, like, maybe there's no sense, like, maybe there's not, of how this is made, you know, and that's probably part of it. And if anybody wants to join the conversation, just put in a request to speak. I will bring you up on stage. Maybe someone else out there. And welcome to everybody who's shown up here. Maybe someone else has seen it and has comments.
00:15:25.902 - 00:15:48.056, Speaker A: And I guess before we move on, because I want to actually hear about the rest of the, of the museum and just your thoughts in general. But before we move on, I guess it sounds like to me, from what both of you are saying, the presentation was like 120%. Like, it was a top notch presentation of a digital artwork. Does that sound accurate?
00:15:48.160 - 00:16:57.130, Speaker B: Definitely. The presentation, the craft, it was all, I mean, you can see from some of the videos that I shared that, that are also just, you know, publicly available. Doctor version has a great time lapse that he shared. It is really cool. I just, I would have liked to see a more in depth. Like, I feel like it could have been a whole floor of Moma could have been dedicated to the technology and what it can do. And, you know, some of my thoughts that I shared in this, this Twitter thread was like, imagine just variations of what the AI is able to do if you isolate certain data sets and maybe like, you know, what if you had a version of this work that was referencing, you know, tagged images that include only women artists or only black artists or only art from, you know, 1920s, you know, just like, it would have been cool to see the extent to which this can create new images instead of just this one singular work, which really didn't change a whole lot.
00:16:57.322 - 00:16:59.338, Speaker A: Interesting. Yeah, go ahead.
00:16:59.506 - 00:17:39.476, Speaker C: But it did cycle through, remember, it kind of shifts which just to add on the presentation, like, I would have rather seen this smaller and like ten of these in a room where because, you know, you walk in a moment, it's busy and it just, it feels like, hey, this big, massive intro and then have a little bit, like it's in the lobby, you know, and I know that's because of the scale of it. So I would have preferred if it's like maybe all the different programs in one room, smaller, where you could enjoy it more. But as packed as mom is these days, it's hard to find anywhere not to bump into someone. It was pretty crazy interesting.
00:17:39.540 - 00:18:01.376, Speaker A: Again, the busyness I find super interesting. And for, from what you guys are saying, like, do you feel that they. And here we could. I'm just proposing a criticism. You don't need to agree with it. I get the sense that perhaps what you guys are saying, though, is maybe it was just as tad superficial in its treatment of AI. What do you think about that?
00:18:01.520 - 00:18:52.786, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think the concept was there, the presentation was there, but yeah, maybe it did kind of, you know, take a little bit of a shortcut with everything it chose not to do. I think it's, the problem was it was just a singular work. It's really hard to make all of it happen with one singular work. It was also just a little convoluted, the whole thing, because in addition to this whole, you know, taking this entire data set from the MoMA archives, the image would shift based on sensors that they had in the lobby. So sensors for light and movement and the weather outside were kind of taken into account for how this thing was going to transform, which I don't know that that added anything of value for me personally.
00:18:52.930 - 00:18:54.418, Speaker A: Well, that's fascinating.
00:18:54.506 - 00:18:55.058, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:18:55.106 - 00:19:16.170, Speaker A: So they were actually. So the people in the room affected the artwork, and I've seen pictures of the screen where I see diagrams, like, is it always the abstraction? And then we'll move on to the rest of the museum here. But is it always the abstract, you know, quote unquote lava lamp thing, or does it actually go to diagrams? Sometimes. Does it show its process? In a sense?
00:19:16.242 - 00:19:33.310, Speaker B: Along the way there was a small monitor that showed kind of the brain of the machine working in tandem with the display. But when this thing would cycle through and like, start over, it would show the, the, that, what was on the monitor briefly. You know, let me see if I can share that here.
00:19:33.422 - 00:19:42.334, Speaker A: Okay, awesome. So links are being shared. Doctor Bergeron, any sort of final thoughts on the AI work in the lobby before we move to the rest of the museum?
00:19:42.494 - 00:20:02.528, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't think it was really evident that it was doing all this stuff. And to make it effective, they need to show what it's doing, because you're just like, you can't really decipher that. It's dependent on the weather and movement in the space. And, you know, they could be just saying that it's not evident that that's what was happening.
00:20:02.576 - 00:20:08.640, Speaker A: Interesting. And would they show, like, computer code or, like, what exactly were, like, how do you guys know?
00:20:08.752 - 00:20:44.804, Speaker B: I mean, I'm just kind of making assumptions and connections based on what MoMA shared on YouTube through this video. The stuff that they have, there's. They provide a lot of information on their website, which is great, but it seemed like there was a bigger talk on what this exhibit was than what it ended up being. I mean, first of all, the name unsupervised, it felt very not. It felt very supervised. But, yeah, this monitor would show these kind of, like, morphing bubbles, which I assume are, like, data sets. And then there was all these little, like.
00:20:44.804 - 00:20:52.816, Speaker B: I don't know, there was some code, though, that was. That was running beneath one of the, you know, on part of the monitor.
00:20:52.960 - 00:21:08.496, Speaker A: Well, I mean, it's fascinating to hear firsthand accounts of this thing, and, of course, for anybody that hasn't seen. And again, big shout out to everybody that's here listening. Rosatio, Martin, Joe. Rinny Fish. Laura. Sid, Joe. Josh, Klaus, everybody.
00:21:08.496 - 00:21:27.110, Speaker A: Welcome. So, you know, for everybody who's just kind of imagining it, it's just hard to imagine. I think it's one of those things you probably just have to see in person. So tell us. I'm actually dying to hear, maybe even weirdly more so. I'm dying to hear about the rest of the museum experience. You guys walked around, right?
00:21:27.222 - 00:22:07.166, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. We saw the whole museum, but we went straight to the video installations, which were on the top floor, and the whole top floor was all this exhibit called signals, how video transformed the world. And that's where I felt I was the most inspired by what MoMA had put together. And they exhibited all these artists, all of whom, except for Namjoon Pike, I had never heard of before, who used video and cameras and all of this stuff as early as, like, maybe the. The sixties. There was one in there that was from 1969. That was just incredible.
00:22:07.166 - 00:22:19.022, Speaker B: But I really liked the different ways they were using a variety of screens and a variety of these digital screens to show different kinds of work. It was really impressive.
00:22:19.198 - 00:22:27.414, Speaker A: Yeah. And you've tweeted quite a few photos of that, too. So I assume if people go to your feed, they'll be able to track that down. Maybe you want to retweet it.
00:22:27.534 - 00:22:28.194, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:22:28.574 - 00:22:38.570, Speaker A: And just share it or feel free to post it. Yeah, exactly. Doctor version. You're a video artist. You have a lot of experience in this regard. Did you know that this show was.
00:22:38.602 - 00:22:40.378, Speaker B: On the video show.
00:22:40.546 - 00:22:48.170, Speaker C: I did not. But I was going to New York, so I was seeing what was at the museums and definitely on my list, so perfect, right?
00:22:48.242 - 00:23:06.578, Speaker A: I mean, you must have been thrilled. I remember going to. I'd never heard of Sigmar Polka, and then I ended up at a retrospective, kind of a famous show, actually, at MoMA. And that was like, kind of mind bending experience. I was like, who on earth is this guy? So anyways, tell us your thoughts. Doctor version on the video show.
00:23:06.666 - 00:23:40.158, Speaker C: You know, it's interesting to see some of these ideas that now are just part of our lives. And Runetoon, thanks for taking notes, because I don't remember the artist too much or I didn't document it like I should. There was a piece that was like a video, a video on in LA and then somewhere in a different city where people could talk to each other live, you know, pretty much a Zoom call, but this was done rune tune. I don't know if you have the. Have the details on that.
00:23:40.206 - 00:24:20.748, Speaker B: You know, unfortunately, I don't know if I got a video or photo of that particular one. I mean, there was so much there to share. And unfortunately, that Twitter thread that I put together with all the documentation of that show, oh, man, I'm so disappointed because Twitter has limited their, you know, the shareable images to Max. Max, like five megabytes. So I had to go through and edit every single one of my videos, every single photo. So unfortunately, there was a lot that I wanted to share that I couldn't. And next time I'm just going to go through with my phone and skip the nice camera that takes, you know, very large photos and videos.
00:24:20.748 - 00:24:24.036, Speaker B: But I do have quite a bit that I was able to share.
00:24:24.220 - 00:24:41.240, Speaker A: That is hilarious. That's classic, actually. Sometimes just the lo fi tech is the best in terms of just. It's the most practical, shall we say, doctor version, though. You must have been inspired by, like, by works, I mean. Or were you. Were you inspired by anything you saw in the.
00:24:41.240 - 00:24:50.664, Speaker A: Can you guys describe it for us a little bit? Like, was this the second floor? And then it was mostly. It looks like it was a lot of tvs and screens, like. Like, what was the show?
00:24:50.824 - 00:25:52.336, Speaker B: It was a variety of artists who use video in different ways. There are plenty of, you know, there are a lot of themes going through everything from surveillance to data mining, you know, all of this stuff from the political to the existential. And what you saw was video artists all the way back from the sixties to the present. Mostly older stuff, though, like this Frank Gillette that I shared in the spaces, that's from 1969. And what I thought was interesting, both Doctor version and I picked up on this is when you look at the date that the art was made, you see 1969, and then you see 2022. And so you're dealing with a lot of technology that simply, I mean, I'm assuming that the, the original screens that this was shown on were like maybe tube tvs that burn out, that cannot be replaced. So they had to pivot and find an alternative.
00:25:52.336 - 00:26:46.994, Speaker B: So you see all these descriptions of the different materials used for each piece, which often, you know, we're used to looking at maybe say, an oil painting, and you just see oil on canvas. But for each of these works, there would be like a paragraph of materials used to display the work. So you would see everything from these standard definition displays to surveillance cameras being used to all these different kinds of retro screens and even projectors. There were a variety of different displays used. And actually, here, let me see if I can share my favorite one. I believe this was one of Doctor Virgin's favorites as well. But projections onto paper was an excellent solution, actually.
00:26:46.994 - 00:27:30.536, Speaker B: Here we go. Let me show this one. These were my favorite. It was something I'd never thought of before. And, I mean, I've heard of people using projections to project onto an artwork or onto a canvas, but what was nice about these paper projections is that the projectors were behind them. So it was almost like seeing, you know, like a television screen, but instead of glass, like, you're taking into account the texture from the, you know, the video footage combined with the texture of the paper. And it was, it resulted in this, like, very rich display, which, honestly, you can't capture on video or on camera.
00:27:30.536 - 00:27:41.336, Speaker B: So even though I took some photos there, seeing that in person was fantastic. And that's something that I would definitely try to do myself if ever given the opportunity.
00:27:41.480 - 00:27:43.776, Speaker A: Okay, so definitely inspired you.
00:27:43.880 - 00:27:44.592, Speaker B: Oh, yes.
00:27:44.728 - 00:27:55.754, Speaker A: Interesting. And what was the purpose of the show? Like, was it like, kind of bring people up to speed of the history of video art or not?
00:27:56.414 - 00:28:51.356, Speaker B: You know, I think overall, it was just kind of exploring these themes about how video and screens are everywhere today. Oh, and what that means. So they're, they're exploring that, you know, obviously social media and data mining were, you know, like a side conversation, but this was, you know, a lot of it was stuff from the sixties, seventies, eighties, nineties, you know, that was the majority of the work. And so I think, you know, to bring this back to the original theme here, our museum serving us. What's nice about places like the MoMA is they are able to archive a tremendous amount of artists. And a lot of times, you know, there's work that is just sitting in there in storage that really only gets to come out and. And be on view for themes like this.
00:28:51.356 - 00:29:53.862, Speaker B: And I get the feeling that this was kind of something, this was a strategic show to put on in tandem with the AI exhibit, because, I don't know, I feel like they probably know a lot of people who might be interested in AI would also be interested in this work. And it definitely worked for me, but it was, it was a lot to take in. There was everything from anti war sentiment to artists who were responding to, you know, the chinese government and, you know, anti censorship sentiment. And then there was stuff that was simply just exploring video art. Like what Doctor Virgin brought up that original piece, which was kind of like, you know, to compare it to like FaceTime or a Zoom call where the artist had a camera in LA and a camera in New York, and the viewers at the time were able to see people from the other city from that exhibit. I mean, really cool stuff.
00:29:53.998 - 00:30:22.696, Speaker A: It's pretty fascinating to think that artists might have been the first to actually make the Zoom call, or at least an early version of it. That's pretty impressive. These artists from whenever this was the late sixties, seventies Doctor version, what was your assessment of the video show? And like, do you go back to your practice now and if anybody doesn't know, Doctor version makes beautiful video art. Did it change or impact your process at all? Did it give you ideas of things you could do?
00:30:22.800 - 00:30:59.844, Speaker C: Yeah, I think mostly with how it can be presented. I love the variety of how these things were displayed. I mean, I think there were some that were on iPads, there's some on like, these old little maybe monitors that are used on a production field, old tube tvs. But like Runetun was saying, the one that we really were like, holy shit, this is such a great idea, taking a projector and a piece of paper projecting onto it from the back. I couldn't believe how crisp it looked and, like, organic. Because I've been trying to figure out how to display my collection at home and I'm just looking on my laptop. I need to figure out a way.
00:30:59.844 - 00:31:29.184, Speaker C: And I think this would be one to do. And also when you go to events around, you're seeing, you know, nfts and galleries. I haven't seen this type of variety. There are projections and then there's screens, but it's cool to see this? The wires purposely out. And, like, there's not just one way to display video and art. Maybe that's part of the art too, you know. But yeah, I have some photos too.
00:31:29.184 - 00:31:46.150, Speaker C: I'll post later today. But with the paper and the. The screens, so you can see how simple it is. It's. It's kind of like low tech, high tech together in a way, which we were talking about that too. But, yeah, it was great seeing that. That was the most inspiring part to me.
00:31:46.150 - 00:31:56.270, Speaker C: And then also, I think Rune Tung, we were looking at a piece and like, whoa, this looks like an LB or something. Like, it had that feel of one of his pieces.
00:31:56.462 - 00:31:57.278, Speaker B: I remember that.
00:31:57.326 - 00:32:00.628, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that was done in the eighties, right?
00:32:00.676 - 00:32:23.064, Speaker B: What's funny is it was. It was a work that was done, you know, at the time, which, you know, we love. We have this love of retro tools over here and retro content, like the Kurt Hussle collective, who I think. Yeah, there they are. And this was a work that was made in real time, of its own time, and it felt like a lot of the stuff that we see today.
00:32:23.644 - 00:32:42.534, Speaker A: That is great. It reminded you of some of the nfts that we look at here. And I'm just. Yeah, I'd almost love to see Kurt Hussle collective. Big shout out to KHC there on one of those retro tvs. I mean, it's something you mentioned very early on in one of our early spaces. Rune tune is how you'd love to nfts.
00:32:42.534 - 00:33:01.248, Speaker A: We should put a show together where we show stuff on like, a nikia phone and this sort of thing. And it almost sounds like a similar kind of idea was going on there. Any final thoughts on that before? And I assume you guys went to the rest of the museum. I mean, what else happened? What are other highlights of MoMA and even Christie's that you guys went to?
00:33:01.336 - 00:33:42.620, Speaker B: Well, Christie's was in the middle of installing a show, so we didn't actually get to see a whole lot there, unfortunately. But the rest of MoMA, I would say, you know, the other floors were very, very crowded. And I think at that point, we were just kind of going through and seeing all the modern works, you know, the demoiselle de Avignon, the Picasso. There was some, you know, classic van Goghs, a bunch of surrealism. But at that point, we were just kind of like, perusing and enjoying. I think it was the signals, the video installation, which was where we really absorbed what the museum was offering. After the video installation, I was kind of, like, saturated.
00:33:42.620 - 00:34:06.028, Speaker B: You know, my brain can only. It maxes out after a certain point when I'm in these huge museums. But, yes, definitely I was thinking the whole time I was in the video installation floor about that desire to see nfts displayed in a larger variety of ways. And this was contributing to that greatly.
00:34:06.156 - 00:34:34.990, Speaker A: Interesting. Well, it sounds like an informed, and, like, if you ever do put a show together of that kind, it sounds like you have a few more ideas in your pocket doctor version. What were your thoughts on. On the rest of the show, the rest of the museum? And, you know, was there glitch? I'm just kind of curious. Like, this sounds like a kind of, you know, exhibition, the signals exhibition, where there'd be maybe some kind of glitch, you know, maybe a borderline cases of glitch, or did that come up at all in the museum?
00:34:35.142 - 00:34:43.674, Speaker B: There actually was something that was kind of glitch. Like, let me. Let me share the video.
00:34:44.444 - 00:35:09.528, Speaker A: It's kind of funny because with this whole Sotheby's glitch thing that happened, the whole kerfuffle a few weeks ago, it made me realize that maybe it kind of gave me the sense that maybe a lot of these glitch artists haven't been recognized. But then it gets down to these ideas of, well, who kind of started this glitch thing? And I don't know enough about it, but I imagine there must have been some overlap of some kind in that exhibition.
00:35:09.636 - 00:35:41.548, Speaker B: Yeah, so the. The two that I just shared to the spaces, this, like, kind of dancing figure that was by this artist named Sandra Perry. I'll type this in into a comment later, but, uh, the work was called double quadruple, etcetera, etcetera, one and two. And there were two. So these look very similar, but there are two projections onto what looked like maybe a large canvas. And the artist, you know, uh, took a video of themselves dancing, or someone dancing. Maybe it's not Sondra Perry.
00:35:41.548 - 00:36:17.604, Speaker B: And then used the photoshop, the fill tool, to, like, kind of white out the figure. So all you see is the hair and, like, these little, like, kind of the essence of the body in motion. So in a way that's kind of like, to me, that references glitchy stuff. Whether or not, you know, you personally consider that to be true glitch or not, I don't know. But, yeah, this was something that got close to glitch work, and I think that this one was done in 2013, so they're ahead of it here.
00:36:17.944 - 00:36:50.460, Speaker A: Right. So, and, Doctor Virgin, what were your thoughts and just on the museum in general. I mean, what's great about you guys is you both like Runetune, lives in New York, doctor version. Lived in New York for what sounds like at least, you know, maybe a decade or two, maybe longer, you know. What were your thoughts on the museum? Because you guys have probably been to moma quite a few times, and every time you return to these kind of big institutions, you kind of have a, you know, I guess it's just what it is like, I guess. To answer our question of the day, how do you think they're doing doctor version? Give us your thoughts.
00:36:50.612 - 00:37:00.244, Speaker C: Personally, I was disappointed because I'm always on the lookout to see Roberto Mata. I've seen all the matas, I think, over the years at MoMA, but they were all in storage.
00:37:00.824 - 00:37:10.504, Speaker A: That's hilarious. I mean, surrealism is in like. I mean, you see, like the odd little news article, young collectors like Surrealism, which gives us all hope.
00:37:10.544 - 00:37:11.088, Speaker B: So that's. Anyways.
00:37:11.136 - 00:37:12.000, Speaker A: Anyways, continue.
00:37:12.152 - 00:37:18.484, Speaker C: Yeah, and you know, I've seen all these paintings before. You know, I don't need to see a Pollock ever again.
00:37:19.944 - 00:37:20.328, Speaker B: I.
00:37:20.376 - 00:37:27.702, Speaker C: The Rothkos I always love. I will watch look those. But then there's artists like, I always wonder, like Clifford still, I don't know if you're familiar with.
00:37:27.758 - 00:37:30.998, Speaker A: Yes, definitely sells for ridiculous amount of amounts of money.
00:37:31.086 - 00:37:50.624, Speaker C: I mean, yeah, I've never been drawn to it. I always walk by it and I almost do a test, like, let's see who stands in front of it. And there's literally most of the time people walk right by. That is hilarious at Moma. So it was crowded and, you know, we've kind of seen it all before. Yeah, sounds like a jaded.
00:37:51.044 - 00:38:33.974, Speaker A: This is perfect doctor version because I think that that's almost where I was going a little bit with the questions. It's like, okay, as I was saying, in one of the earlier shows, like, they just put a Gerhard Richter show here at the Neue National Gallery in Berlin. And it's like they keep showing the same 30 artists, basically. I mean, and I'll be fair, I mean, signals. I mean, they probably brought in a whole bunch of other artists that they've never shown before. So I don't want to over generalize, but I think it's interesting what you're saying because part of the reason, like, to bring it all back home, part of the reason I'm so excited about the NFT kind of digital scene is it's novel imagery, it's new. It's absolutely, you know, and we've just seen it.
00:38:33.974 - 00:38:45.910, Speaker A: I love Van Gogh. I love Rousseau. You probably saw that beautiful Rousseau. I imagine they had it up and, you know, you can definitely appreciate a Picasso, you know, but it's just kind of like, here we go again.
00:38:46.062 - 00:38:46.590, Speaker B: Right?
00:38:46.702 - 00:39:24.616, Speaker C: Yeah. I would say too, if you, you know, you can go and look at, I think, everything the moma has or what they have on their database. Maybe not everything, but they're sitting on a lot of stuff where you're like, why don't they pull this one out? Is it because the tourists, they come to town and every gallery or museum, they all need to have those artists to get the tourists in. Like, we need to see the Van Gogh, we need to see the pollock. We need, need to see. And I just, I just think they have a lot of missed opportunities. And then seeing a show like this tv as a medium, it's, it's like Rune tune was saying, wow, we get to see some of this stuff that doesn't get to see the light of day.
00:39:24.616 - 00:39:32.520, Speaker C: But I think they can. Living in New York, I was there almost. I was there 25 years. They definitely can mix it up a lot more than they have.
00:39:32.672 - 00:39:39.572, Speaker A: Well, to your point, it's almost like it's, you know, as you're saying earlier, it's almost like these museums have become theme parks.
00:39:39.748 - 00:40:20.090, Speaker B: Yeah. And that's, that really is kind of the problem. I mean, I think that they have the power to do a lot of things, and this signals show was proof of that. It's just unfortunate that we don't get to see a lot of that stuff more often. And, you know, to your point, you're absolutely right. I mean, I think it is kind of for the tourists, like, they're never going to put, you know, starry night in storage because, you know, everyone wants to go and see that specifically and works like that. But that being said, I mean, I know for a fact that MoMA collects a lot of artists, a lot of unknown artists.
00:40:20.090 - 00:40:46.500, Speaker B: I know people personally who have their work collected by the MOMA, but it probably won't ever be on display until a specific show opportunity happens, like signals. And that's really the way in which these huge institutions are serving us, is that they are holding on to these vast archives of artwork. It's just too bad that we don't get to see it more often.
00:40:46.652 - 00:41:13.590, Speaker A: It's an interesting conundrum because, and to, you know, to sympathize with them and welcome everyone who is tuning in here. Sbato, I've sent you an invite if you're able to talk. It'd be great to hear your reflections on New York, which is kind of part of the topic of the day here. So if I was to go to New York, I might be disappointed if I. Oh, if I can't see the Rousseau. Oh, they put the Rousseau in storage. So I sympathize with their conundrum.
00:41:13.590 - 00:41:47.604, Speaker A: Like, it's almost like maybe they did it as best they could under the circumstances where, okay, we put a new show here and then we give the people what they want. You know, like, because people don't want to go to New York and not be able to see their demoiselle Davignon, to your point. You know, so maybe they're actually doing a pretty good job. But, I mean, doctor version feels that maybe they could mix it up. So anybody is welcome to join us on stage. If you have a question for rune tune or a comment or anything. I've sent out some invites to a few people here.
00:41:47.724 - 00:42:05.672, Speaker B: I don't know if Sabato is able to speak, but I'm pretty sure you saw the Rafiq Anadal exhibit as well. Yeah, Sabato had kind of invited me to go to the moMA when they were going, but I wasn't able to make it, unfortunately, which I regret. I wish I could have. I wanted to hang out.
00:42:05.848 - 00:42:13.680, Speaker A: Excellent. Well, I have sent Sabato an invite. He may be at a laptop right now. Oh, he is on stage. Okay. Awesome. It's great to hear from Sabato.
00:42:13.680 - 00:42:14.924, Speaker A: Sabato, how you doing?
00:42:15.344 - 00:42:16.664, Speaker D: Hey, I'm doing well.
00:42:16.704 - 00:42:18.198, Speaker B: How are you doing?
00:42:18.246 - 00:42:28.238, Speaker A: Great. Congratulations on your Sotheby's situation there. That looked awesome. I mean, definitely, as you put it there in a comment, a highlight of the year for you.
00:42:28.326 - 00:42:53.894, Speaker D: Yeah, that's been, like, really surreal for me. And it was like, really surreal to, like, go down to New York and, you know, go to, like, the Sotheby's headquarter and, like, kind of just like, see your work in the space and see a panel. And that's where I met, like, donia for the first time. Even though I've, like, known her for like ten years through the glitch artist group, I never met her in person. So it was really kind of. Kind of funny. That's like, oh, I finally met you at the Sotheby's panel.
00:42:53.894 - 00:43:03.338, Speaker D: And same with Rosa Mankman. I met her there too for the first time. And a few artists like Ellie Pritz and I met collectors too there. It was really, really wonderful experience.
00:43:03.506 - 00:43:11.614, Speaker A: Yeah, it sure sounds like it. And it sounds like it all came together very quickly for you. Hey, like, I mean, a month ago, did you know you were going to Sotheby's in New York?
00:43:12.074 - 00:43:16.754, Speaker D: No, it was, it was like a ten day turnaround kind of thing. And I already.
00:43:16.914 - 00:43:18.074, Speaker B: That's impressive.
00:43:18.114 - 00:43:18.338, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:43:18.386 - 00:43:30.010, Speaker D: And I had, like, stuff for, you know, expanded art show and some other kind of New York things that I had do as well. So it was like, kind of a crazy, unhealthy crunch for a few days, and I'm glad it's over.
00:43:30.202 - 00:43:36.866, Speaker A: So tell us the highlights here. I mean, we were talking about the AI work in MoMA. You went to moma too, right?
00:43:37.010 - 00:43:39.050, Speaker D: Actually, I did not get to go to Moma.
00:43:39.162 - 00:43:39.962, Speaker A: Not too bad.
00:43:40.058 - 00:43:40.810, Speaker B: Oh, bummer.
00:43:40.842 - 00:44:03.330, Speaker D: Like, that Friday, I ended up, I was only in New York for a day, and I went to the Sotheby's thing, and I went, actually went to the Whitney. I didn't go to all the Whitney, but they had a free room on the first floor where they had some new media works by, like, Zach blass and I can't remember who else. Oh, there was an Aria Harvey piece, which was really awesome to see, like, in real life.
00:44:03.482 - 00:44:09.536, Speaker A: What kind of work is that for those that might not know? I've never heard of those artists, but I'm sure they're probably very well known.
00:44:09.720 - 00:44:32.368, Speaker D: So Arya Harvey does, and she's on Tazos and ETH too. She does a lot of, like, 3d sculptures. And a lot of the works is based on, like, black history. She did a really interesting AI piece on the slave ships that was released with the first, like, I think was called AIad show back in fall of 2021.
00:44:32.456 - 00:44:36.124, Speaker A: I feel like I have seen that. Yeah, perhaps I've seen that.
00:44:36.264 - 00:45:13.940, Speaker D: I feel that one kind of made the rounds on web3, Twitter. Yeah. But, yeah, she makes some really beautiful, like, 3d GLB pieces. They kind of look like classical sculptures, but are influenced by kind of, like, black history and mythologies. Yeah, there's also a Morrison Alahari piece, which kind of has a similar vibe, like, she's, like, iranian and she does, like, a lot of, like, persian mythology and turns into, like, kind of, like, 3d sculptures and new media pieces. It was really cool to see both those artists lives, like, their works live. And then Zach blass does, like, kind of, like, critical new media work about, like, facial recognition and AI technologies and surveillance.
00:45:13.940 - 00:45:23.604, Speaker D: And he had a piece that was kind of like the story of Taylor, the. What's it called? The Microsoft AI that was released, like, five years ago that started calling, I knew everyone, like, racial slurs.
00:45:23.684 - 00:45:24.556, Speaker A: I remember that.
00:45:24.620 - 00:45:25.052, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:45:25.148 - 00:45:30.388, Speaker D: Yeah. And so he made kind of, like, a piece about that, and it had some, like, older AI visuals, which was kind of.
00:45:30.396 - 00:45:31.276, Speaker B: Of cool, because I was like, oh.
00:45:31.300 - 00:45:45.884, Speaker D: This is, like, deep dream from 2015 or 2016. But they were interesting. The setups were really cool. So I was with Oxeye, who kind of works with fabrication for art matters, and so he was, like, looking at all the screens and how everything is built and analyzing it.
00:45:45.924 - 00:45:46.524, Speaker A: So it was.
00:45:46.564 - 00:45:47.244, Speaker D: It was fun.
00:45:47.364 - 00:46:01.150, Speaker A: How was the Whitney? I mean, had you been to the, like. I mean, I call it the new Whitney. It's probably been there for, like, six or seven years, I'm guessing, in that location. That's how long it's been since I've been to New York. What did you think of the show and just everything that they're doing? Are you kind of happy? It was great.
00:46:01.302 - 00:46:06.806, Speaker D: I mean, I only saw the first floor because it was free. I didn't pay to go in the rest of the museum.
00:46:06.870 - 00:46:13.806, Speaker A: Just out of curiosity, and I'm curious about moma tickets too. How much was it to go into the Whitney these days? Like $20.
00:46:13.950 - 00:46:16.422, Speaker B: They're both expensive. Yeah, 25 to 30.
00:46:16.478 - 00:46:18.234, Speaker A: Wow. Yeah, 30 us.
00:46:18.614 - 00:46:19.182, Speaker B: Wow.
00:46:19.278 - 00:46:22.150, Speaker D: Well, I think moma has free Friday still, though. I'm not sure how that.
00:46:22.182 - 00:46:23.784, Speaker A: Oh, man, that must be.
00:46:24.244 - 00:46:26.516, Speaker B: Yep. Yeah.
00:46:26.700 - 00:46:31.596, Speaker A: Not worth it. Exactly. And. Sorry. Continue. Sabato on the Whitney.
00:46:31.700 - 00:46:46.364, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I can't say much. I can't speak much about the Whitney because I didn't go through the whole thing. It was also my first time at the new building. Okay. It was. You know, it has that, like, industrial, like, kind of raw vibe. Kind of like the Pompidou, you know, in terms of the architecture.
00:46:46.524 - 00:47:01.540, Speaker B: So you said you saw someone from art Mater, and I think Doctor Virgin went to an event with them as well. Do you remember poco belly? We were talking about them a while back with the Tez nouns and the paint plotter.
00:47:01.732 - 00:47:07.424, Speaker A: Oh, of course, the paint plotter. Yeah, that blew all our minds.
00:47:08.364 - 00:47:19.412, Speaker B: Yeah. I wasn't able to attend that, but Doctor Virgin, were you able to go to that event that you had told me about with art material and Sabata, you said you met up with someone from that company.
00:47:19.588 - 00:47:35.476, Speaker D: Yes, Oxcai is. I think he's a project manager with them or some kind of fabrication manager. He recently started working with them. He also has amazing art on Ethan Taz. Oh, you spell the name is Ox. Three y three.
00:47:35.620 - 00:47:36.044, Speaker A: Right.
00:47:36.124 - 00:47:37.092, Speaker D: I think some of you would recommend.
00:47:37.108 - 00:47:38.684, Speaker A: Yeah, he's pretty well known, I think.
00:47:38.844 - 00:47:39.348, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:47:39.436 - 00:47:52.968, Speaker D: He's a good friend and lovely human being, but, yeah, he helped kind of set up, though. I think they had a Zanchan show at art matter. Art mater that I missed. I missed, like, a lot of stuff this. This time, just because of. Just, like, stress and mental health.
00:47:53.056 - 00:47:57.064, Speaker A: Yeah. Sorry, I don't mean to laugh. I mean, you must have been under the.
00:47:57.224 - 00:47:58.488, Speaker D: It's better to laugh at it.
00:47:58.576 - 00:48:05.840, Speaker A: I mean, it sounds like you're under a lot of pressure and, like. And you came. Did you fly or. I assume you flew. It's not like you're going to take a train from.
00:48:05.952 - 00:48:08.406, Speaker D: No, I just took a train. I live in western Massachusetts.
00:48:08.430 - 00:48:10.646, Speaker A: Oh, right. I was thinking Seattle. Right, right.
00:48:10.710 - 00:48:14.382, Speaker D: It's just a drive and a train away, so it's actually not very far.
00:48:14.438 - 00:48:14.702, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:48:14.758 - 00:48:20.950, Speaker A: Did you go to any NFT, New York City stuff, or was that almost just kind of incidental to your situation?
00:48:21.142 - 00:48:26.062, Speaker D: It was mostly incidental. I had a friend invite me to the Jack Daniels after party on Friday.
00:48:26.118 - 00:48:26.934, Speaker A: That sounds fun.
00:48:27.054 - 00:48:37.144, Speaker D: The way things are in New York City, everything is so spread out that it's, like, really hard to actually, like, go to multiple things without, you know, just kind of going across, like, three boroughs.
00:48:37.224 - 00:48:43.016, Speaker B: Um. Right. I can speak to that. It is a nightmare. It's just so dense and so hard to get from one place to the next.
00:48:43.120 - 00:48:57.976, Speaker C: Yeah, I'll jump in here. Getting to art modder was way out in Red Hook. And, um. Yeah, it's not an easy place to get. And I just want to say congrats about. I wish I would have ran into you this time, but I know you were there only short time.
00:48:58.120 - 00:49:07.734, Speaker D: Oh, same doctor version. I really love the video you. You posted with that, like, swooping intro into the. Into the space. And I really appreciate you sharing that.
00:49:07.854 - 00:49:21.926, Speaker C: Oh, thanks. Yeah, that was a trip, I gotta say. I'm going up to Sotheby's. I'm gonna see a sabato. I'm gonna see a tuk. I'm gonna see Skye Goodman, some favorite artists, and. Yeah.
00:49:21.926 - 00:49:35.086, Speaker C: And then walking in, and there's empress trash. Let's glitch it. Uh, inaverri or inavar? I don't. I'm not sure how to say her name or their name, but. What did you think about the screen, Sabato?
00:49:35.230 - 00:50:00.742, Speaker D: You know, I'm. I'm going to be biased because my work was 1080p originally, so my work looked great on the screens. I know other artists kind of had some criticisms about them not being 4k ready or just like, like, one screen turned off. One screen was, like, sideways. So I feel like they could have done a little bit better in terms of just, like, how the screens were set up, especially compared to some of the other NFT shows. But I don't. I wouldn't say it's the worst.
00:50:00.742 - 00:50:24.114, Speaker D: I kind of like the space. And regardless of, like, you know, just, like, you know, this was one of the events that, like, if I posted on Facebook, my brazilian aunties and their friends would, like, tell each other. And then I had people from, like, you know, that I never talked to in, like, years just stop by Sotheby's and look at the art. So there's that, like, you know, it's a give and take, I think, in terms of just how the shows are set up and, you know, how good they are.
00:50:24.234 - 00:50:34.898, Speaker A: I love that detail of, like, because it is kind of a hey, mom, look at me moment. You know, like, hey, I'm a Sotheby's mom. I mean, maybe that was one of the biggest benefits of the whole thing.
00:50:34.946 - 00:50:36.802, Speaker B: I mean, absolutely.
00:50:36.858 - 00:50:46.868, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean. I mean, the older you get, the more you're just like. And maybe my mom's listening. I should look here. I don't see Lorraine. If you ever see Lorraine, that's my mom.
00:50:46.868 - 00:51:04.524, Speaker A: She'll probably look later. Banana cake. You've been waiting patiently. Welcome to the show. Where are you calling from? Okay, banana cake. Just let me know if you are back. And so anyways, so I guess as we wrap up here, we're kind of wrapping up.
00:51:04.524 - 00:51:13.330, Speaker A: Any final thoughts? Any big thoughts, Sabato, on just your whole experience? As you look back, back now, it sounds like it was rushed, but any big thoughts from you?
00:51:13.442 - 00:51:15.266, Speaker B: It was a bit rushed. I don't know.
00:51:15.290 - 00:51:19.386, Speaker C: You know, like, I love these NfT events.
00:51:19.410 - 00:51:27.174, Speaker D: I love running into everyone. I wish they would plan them for the weekends, and I wish they would make, like, more of the galler shows, a bit more family friendly.
00:51:27.514 - 00:51:30.410, Speaker A: Interesting, because I would love to bring.
00:51:30.442 - 00:51:55.220, Speaker D: My partner and kids, but it's like, you work during the week. It's like, you can't really bring him down for that. That's always my one criticism, is that it's like, you know, I think these events are planned for, like, a lot of, you know, kind of like, you know, it's like an industry conference. You know, people want to go drinking in the weekday night, but I think you need both. You know, I think for the artist, it's like sometimes we want things that are a little more chill and just a little more slow and open.
00:51:55.372 - 00:51:59.892, Speaker A: So by family friendly, you mean in terms of the time, like, maybe put it on a weekend.
00:51:59.948 - 00:52:02.668, Speaker D: In terms of time, yeah. I think it's more about times and duration.
00:52:02.716 - 00:52:03.268, Speaker A: Okay.
00:52:03.396 - 00:52:11.420, Speaker D: I would love to bring, like, my partner to a refraction party, but they're always on a Tuesday night, and it's like, can't. It's hard to, like, bring a teacher down to that, you know?
00:52:11.492 - 00:52:17.444, Speaker A: Exactly. Yeah. And. But in terms of the content, you're cool. It doesn't need to be more family friendly.
00:52:17.564 - 00:52:32.766, Speaker D: No, in terms of the content, I think it's fine. I think it's like. I think every time there's a New York party, Lorna Mills makes, like, the most. You know, she finds, like, the most outrageous porn to make a gift out of, and it gets shown, and then there's at least ten people that are like, oh, yeah, I was with my kid, and they saw your work, Lorna.
00:52:32.870 - 00:52:34.062, Speaker A: I can't wait to meet her.
00:52:34.118 - 00:52:35.514, Speaker D: And I think that's, like, a rich.
00:52:36.894 - 00:52:51.182, Speaker A: She comes to Berlin every so often. She was actually in town a couple of months ago. She sent me a message. She's like, I wanted to come to your shit during my show. And she's like, I wanted to come, but I was like, super, you know? I don't know what she said. I don't want to put words in her mouth, but she was drinking.
00:52:51.238 - 00:52:52.510, Speaker B: Let's just put it that way.
00:52:52.662 - 00:53:02.774, Speaker D: Yes. Yeah, she's definitely. She's fun. She's like, that's the thing. Like, a lot of. So many of the artists you meet are, like, really lovely, wonderful people to hang out with and talk to. And I think that's, like, the real.
00:53:02.774 - 00:53:08.858, Speaker D: The real treasure here is just, like, the community, you know, seeing each other and talking shit and catching up, you.
00:53:08.866 - 00:53:19.152, Speaker A: Know, like, meeting people in real life. Right. I mean, because it's kind of, like, even just seeing those pictures of you guys, like, it kind of brings it all back home, because a lot of us kind of really know each other from twice.
00:53:19.178 - 00:53:20.908, Speaker B: Twitter, I mean, basically.
00:53:21.036 - 00:53:30.144, Speaker A: Right? I mean, it's kind of very lo fi, so it's kind of nice to, you know, this is real. There's real things, and then there you are at Sotheby's out of nowhere.
00:53:30.524 - 00:53:31.508, Speaker B: I love it.
00:53:31.636 - 00:53:40.852, Speaker A: I just absolutely love that story, so. Well, thank you, everybody. Doctor version, any final thoughts for us? Big picture thoughts as we wrap up here?
00:53:40.988 - 00:54:19.472, Speaker C: You know, it's always inspiring to go to New York, but it was kind of, like, too much going on in too many different places. That you try to make the most of it, I guess. One thing to say, just on the museum front, the Orlando Museum of Art where I live now, I live in Winter park, which is right next to Orlando. They have, I still think they have on an NFT show where they have, like, what is an NFT? And it kind of schools the whole public about it. Let me see if I can remember the artist Jake freed or fried. Jake fried Grant River Yoon, and, like, four other people I don't remember. But, you know, I don't know how well that museum is doing.
00:54:19.472 - 00:54:31.752, Speaker C: If anyone's seen in the news, they had displayed a bunch of counterfeit fake basquiats last year and got a lot of heat for it. And I think people got fired.
00:54:31.808 - 00:54:35.056, Speaker A: Really? On purpose or did they mistakenly.
00:54:35.160 - 00:54:47.748, Speaker C: No mistake. Someone didn't do. Someone wasn't paying attention or I would have loved to see. I wish I would have saw the show because I would be like, that'd be amazing to see a fake Basquiat. See if I could have spotted.
00:54:47.796 - 00:55:10.000, Speaker A: Totally. Can you. Exactly. Can you spot it? I mean, the thing with Basque, and I don't know if I'm pronouncing his name right, but, like, what's so surprising when you go to the shows is how many are, just how many of these works are painted on, like, a whole bunch of wood, like, nailed together. Like, I mean, oftentimes they're not even canvases. So I think might be kind of a tricky guy. I think the style might not be so tricky.
00:55:10.000 - 00:55:31.384, Speaker A: We see it with. There's a lot of Basquiat influenced artists out there, so it's not shocking to think maybe someone could maybe imitate the style a little bit. But the canvases, quote unquote, might be the hardest part. So you never saw that show, but that's really interesting. Runtoon, any final thoughts for us as we wrap up our talk on museums and New York City?
00:55:31.544 - 00:56:04.266, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe. Maybe New York isn't the greatest place to have these conferences because I think everyone was kind of having a frustration with transportation and time and energy. I know for myself, even just living here, it's hard to get to everything. I didn't, like, request any work off to, uh, to attend stuff, but, yeah, I made it to, like, a. Some Tezo summit. But I needed more of a social environment for me to feel satisfied with any of the happenings around here. So hanging out with doctor version was a lot of fun.
00:56:04.266 - 00:56:08.970, Speaker B: I wish I could have hung out with you, Sabato, but, yeah, anytime you're in New York.
00:56:09.082 - 00:56:10.178, Speaker D: Yeah, me too.
00:56:10.346 - 00:56:11.682, Speaker B: Invitation to hang.
00:56:11.818 - 00:56:14.162, Speaker D: Let's, let's link up next time I'm in New York.
00:56:14.298 - 00:56:15.794, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah, please let me know.
00:56:15.874 - 00:56:26.470, Speaker A: Well, that sounds great. And it sounds like New York. And final question here for you, Rintun. Is New York really crowded these days? Like, as it been for a while? Like what's the deal on the street.
00:56:26.502 - 00:56:51.376, Speaker B: In New York right now? I mean, yeah, it's definitely very, very crowded. Just being anywhere uptown. Like, it was, it was packed and I think it's just, you know, it's the, it's the springtime. Nice weather. Like, New York is kind of a miserable place to be when it's bitter cold or very hot. So, like, if you visit in July or August, like, forget it. I've done it.
00:56:51.376 - 00:56:52.580, Speaker B: Everything's going to stink.
00:56:52.612 - 00:56:53.504, Speaker A: I've done it.
00:56:54.044 - 00:57:11.012, Speaker B: The subways are miserable. You're going to sweat more than you ever sweat in your life. You're going to be filthy. I ride my bike as much as possible. I try to avoid the MTA as much as I can because you're going to run into some unsavory experiences.
00:57:11.068 - 00:57:18.032, Speaker A: Sounds like the Berlin U bon on steroids. Like I'm on the oox here and it's pretty intense, but I can't imagine.
00:57:18.188 - 00:57:23.136, Speaker B: I imagine that thing probably runs a little bit more smoothly. It does actually, than our metrics.
00:57:23.160 - 00:57:41.248, Speaker A: I'll give it credit for that. Yeah. Well, fascinating and hilarious. And thank you, everybody for attending. Thank you Doctor Virgin and Runtun. And thank you, Sabato, for coming out here and sharing your thoughts on everything your guys experience in New York and just thoughts on museums in general. Thank you, everybody for listening.
00:57:41.248 - 00:57:48.374, Speaker A: And check out doctor version. He's going to have some photos. And until next time, take care.
