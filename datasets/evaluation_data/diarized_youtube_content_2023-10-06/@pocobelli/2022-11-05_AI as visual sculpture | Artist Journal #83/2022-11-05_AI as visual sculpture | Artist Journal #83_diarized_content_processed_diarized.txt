00:00:02.520 - 00:00:38.438, Speaker A: I have good news. Today's episode should be a little shorter than yesterday's episode, and hopefully by a lot. So welcome back. Artist Journal, November 5, 2022, Berlin. My name is Adrian Pokebelly, artist reporter on the scene with this wonderful new painting by rare force, again turning heads. The excitement remains for me. It is always a personal decision.
00:00:38.438 - 00:01:14.314, Speaker A: The excitement remains for me in the NFT space with works like this. Again, this is just a daily occurrence here. This is just another day. You could have a whole section of a newspaper that is like the art section, and I could fill it with interesting works, even static works, because, of course, gifs don't work in a newspaper. I could fill a whole art section, you know, like, this is just another day in the life here. And so here's rare force playing with the Boston dynamics dogs. And you know what's so interesting about this? Like, let's look at the details here quickly.
00:01:14.314 - 00:01:44.870, Speaker A: Spot hunting, slight overkill. And it's actually doing quite well. One ETH bid from punk 7635. That looks like the arty guy, but I'm not sure. Look at this. In spot hunting, slight overkill, I used found british hunting scene based in the 18th century, painted in 1943 by Edith a. Simpkins, and repaint it from the ground up with changes, replacing the traditional hounds with modern day Boston dynamic robotic dogs.
00:01:44.870 - 00:02:34.814, Speaker A: Again, I continue the dystopian future narrative, but pushing the dialogue from modern day to the victorian era for its absurdity and levity in the face of potential grim future. Where and when will we find spot next? Because, of course, rare force has tackled Boston dynamics robot dog before. What I was going to say, though, is, okay, so he digitally repainted it. Awesome. Most people might stop there, but what's so kind of cool about what rare force did here is you see the second layer where it looks like there's a bit of motion, there's something going on, like this semi transparent layer that. That looks like it was just shifted over, like, you know, 100 pixels or whatever the case is, I'm not sure. And just on the.
00:02:34.814 - 00:03:04.254, Speaker A: I was gonna say the organic figures or, like, the living figures, but of course, we have a bunch of robots just on the moving parts of the painting. So just very interesting. This horse. This horse. And even, like, not just reflecting it, you know, 100 pixels away, but then changing the. So showing movement of sorts. Remember, we were looking at Etienne Jules Marais and also Elbie's work yesterday, showing movement.
00:03:04.254 - 00:03:25.696, Speaker A: So anyways. And again, it kind of even evokes the futurists on a certain level. But the reason we love this is just because it's so actually beautifully done. It's completely modern and contemporary and just hits the right notes. Very attractive painting. So congratulations to Rareforest, who we have profiled before. Let's see if we can actually.
00:03:25.696 - 00:03:41.904, Speaker A: Without killing my mic. Let's actually see, because we have other works. We'll see if they load up. Yeah. See this foul play. So he likes this Boston dynamics dog thing. I think it's a great subject matter.
00:03:41.904 - 00:04:00.992, Speaker A: He does a lot of great, I guess, figurative nudes, and they're very original. And let me tell you, it's not easy to do original nudes. That's why I like that guy, whose name I can't remember, who does those pixelated nudes. And they're pretty hard edged pixels. Go to previous episodes. See if you can find that. Hey, there is Boston dynamic dogs, too.
00:04:00.992 - 00:04:13.344, Speaker A: There. That looks like a hilarious piece. Let's just bring that up, and then we'll go to our show notes here. Bear on chain. Sold to for. Was it one? Yes. No, sorry.
00:04:13.344 - 00:05:05.756, Speaker A: Sold for 75. So, again, almost like this 18th century, that last one, of course, I think you'd call that the fox hunt or, you know, that whole genre really, of, I guess we'd probably call it 18th century, 19th century painting. Often like these british lords going out on the hunt. And here you see almost a similar kind of clothing here. So playing with this kind of 18th century, 19th century, probably repainting works as well. Like, let's say here, it probably was repainted, and he probably just puts in finds works with dogs in it and puts in Boston dynamics, a very simple substitution, and voila. You have a whole series on your hands that with that idea, you yourself, dear Watcher, dear viewer, could do it yourself.
00:05:05.756 - 00:05:51.864, Speaker A: I mean, you probably couldn't do it as nicely, depending on how much practice you have. Of course, rare force is a very good digital painter, but you see what I'm saying. The power of ideas. So, continuing on, we were discussing here yesterday, as well as in previous episodes, how Rom glitch corruption, the Nintendo rom glitch corruption works can be taken in a million different directions here. I feel like we're just hitting the scratching the surface on this one, despite all the incredible work that's been done. We got a comment from Mazzin, who made this work right here, Starfield Guardians, that we discussed yesterday, which was pretty original, and I thought the comment was quite interesting. I have different variations of raw corruptions.
00:05:51.864 - 00:06:36.486, Speaker A: There are raw without retouches, narrative, music, video collagen, recolored versions. And I was, yeah, thinking about that. This one was created by combining raw glitches from the same scene. Okay, so again, I feel like we're just getting started. I could be wrong, but again, I just see, you know, you open this stuff up, these gifs up in Photoshop, and you have 30 different images there. And maybe I shouldn't give away my ideas, but I mean, again, as we discussed yesterday, I almost titled yesterday's show, it's all about execution. So I mean, people, I mean, look, people can use ideas, but execution is everything.
00:06:36.486 - 00:07:09.284, Speaker A: And you really got to be, you know, everybody has good ideas. Again, I tell my girlfriend this, look around you on the street, everybody has good ideas, but how many are actually going to succeed at that? And it comes down to execution, right? It's all about execution. So anyways, that's top of mind. A nice comment from Vito, who is also a Nintendo glitch rom, I think. What is the name? Glitch arcade. Always a great pleasure to meet be mentioned, to be honest. And he had these works on Ethereum.
00:07:09.284 - 00:07:34.280, Speaker A: To be honest, those ETH glitches have been collecting dust for a while now. Hopefully they'll get some extra attention thanks to this. I hope so too. Again, like it's. Again, I have a foundation account I've never done anything with. It's tempting to put stuff like that up on there just to put glitch rom stuff up on Ethereum. So anyway, give Vito some attention on and check out his work.
00:07:34.280 - 00:08:12.804, Speaker A: It's profiled in yesterday's show. So thank you for the comment, as always, and thank you for watching Vito, who's been a basically a long time, I want to say a long time listener, but a long time watcher of this show and I totally appreciate it. And you know, a long time in this NFT space can be like four days where people were saying, oh, the show's back on, as if it's a big comeback after I take four days off. I think it was four days, whatever it was, maybe five. Anyways, thank you everyone for the awesome comments and Dan weighed in. Now we're going to look at Dan's new work here. But remember the ASCII works that we were discussing yesterday, the ASCII, Picasso and everything.
00:08:12.804 - 00:08:35.930, Speaker A: So. Hi Adrian. Exactly. For my new ASCII works, I'm still experimenting and studying everything. Well, I use software online and non so interesting. I'm discovering other more and more interesting methods. Once I get the result that interests me, after several tests, changes and uses, I go to make changes manually where I find it necessary.
00:08:35.930 - 00:08:56.126, Speaker A: So he's not simply putting it into a. Some sort of ASCII engine thing. He is making adjustments. Thanks, as always, happy face. So we were wondering that, because there was no sales, and now that I think they're all sold out, actually, he lowered the price and burned a few. Sent me one generously. Thank you, Dan.
00:08:56.126 - 00:09:11.760, Speaker A: I totally appreciate that, because I do love that work. Let's just look. Can you still get it? It is sold out. You reduce it to now? Yeah. Edition of five is pretty collectible. So look at that. So there are manual changes on this.
00:09:11.760 - 00:09:39.288, Speaker A: Okay. So there is actually quite a bit of process, as I would expect with Dan. So thank you for chiming in, Dan. Again, one of my favorite parts about this entire program is the fact that the artists are watching it. I mean, as I always say, the people who watch this program are the people who are in this program. And I couldn't be happier, as I say, for artists, by artists continuing on. So Dan has a new one, Pokemon first generation.
00:09:39.288 - 00:09:56.168, Speaker A: So the experimentation continues. This time it looks like the ASCII. The ASCII works that are not solid blocks are now in black. Let me just look. We brought up that Picasso one. Is that still open? Yeah. You see here.
00:09:56.168 - 00:10:26.612, Speaker A: So these are in color. So you see he's experimenting. And this is why it's so fun to do this daily journal, you know, or quasi Daily Journal, because we can see the evolution of artists in real time, basically. I mean, he'll probably make another work today or post another work which was made, you know, in the last 24 hours. And it's just a testament to the speed of the digital art space. I mean, we're going at lightning speed here. It's easy to forget.
00:10:26.612 - 00:10:50.984, Speaker A: And another important thing, and we have a whole bunch of new viewers, I think, because the views are going up pretty dramatically, from 100 to 150 yesterday in the last 24 hours. Another thing that I wanted to mention. We're moving at fast space. Sorry, guys, I forgot my train of thought. Let's continue on. Oh, I remember. Hallelujah.
00:10:50.984 - 00:11:31.448, Speaker A: We are consuming as well, a huge amount of work on a daily basis. And it's easy to forget that, okay, we're consuming hundreds of new images, judging them, critic. You know, in our head, we're being critical. We're looking at the process. Our whole culture here in this digital art scene is moving at lightning speed. And it's kind of easy to not notice that because we're so neck deep in this space. So continuing on Lewis Osborne has a new auction for a one of one, in a sense, kind of went for a little less than he's probably hoping.
00:11:31.448 - 00:11:51.130, Speaker A: 245. I mean, it's a very nice price. 245 tezos, which is $345. The previous ones went for around 600. 670 I think somewhere around there. So deals still to be had out there for Lewis Osborne. One of ones, if you're on top of things.
00:11:51.130 - 00:12:16.124, Speaker A: So that was interesting. Was there a bidding war? It's kind of hard to see because. Yeah, there was because you see this person with e at the back of their name. They bid from 180. Yeah, these guys wanted it, and finally this guy, these two wanted it, and finally it sold to this guy. So you still would have had to enter a bidding war. You wouldn't have got it for any less, and you probably would have paid a lot more.
00:12:16.124 - 00:12:53.394, Speaker A: This person was probably ready to spend a lot of money, so maybe he got lucky. Limbo, by the way, limbo has twitter spaces, and I was in it yesterday just listening, and it was really good. So limbo is great artist. He can curate and he can put on a great twitter space. So isn't that interesting? So props to limbo. And he just put out this great work here. Again, I just become more and more of a fan of his work, and it took me a while to kind of understand Limbo's work, but now that I do, I absolutely love it.
00:12:53.394 - 00:13:28.486, Speaker A: So I picked this up. I had to pick it up on secondary because it sold out right away. It went for five, a very nice price, like, in the sense of very. From the collector's point of view, a great price and fairly low edition of 21 and. Yeah, so. And then started selling on secondary, I had to pay 17. And this is part of the melancholy dungeon collection illustration inspired by the first level of the melancholy dungeon super Nintendo game, a game that never existed.
00:13:28.486 - 00:13:59.160, Speaker A: And that is the key part there. So super duper cool. I love the signature there, too. So a very nice work by limbo. And moving on, Kurt Hussle collective, one of my favorite artists on the entire platform. He has a work that he released with the drank dao, and that is, of course, purple drank's dao. You gotta own a dao token, and you can find that out by just doing a little bit of research here.
00:13:59.160 - 00:14:27.426, Speaker A: So everybody that has that token, which around was like 35 tezos, I believe, on secondary a few weeks ago, are getting all these for free because I was like, why don't I have one of these? But then I realized this is for the purple drank dao. And so anyways, really cool portrait. Okay. And we were talking about portraiture. It can be a very lucrative business. Okay? So, you know, heads up. Kurt Hussle collective.
00:14:27.426 - 00:14:48.570, Speaker A: A very nice portrait, you know. Would you like your portrait done by Kurt Hussle collective? I think so. So just another interesting little business. We were looking at that with Haiti and his AsCII Petsky filter kind of works. Another work by uxine that we just had to profile. Again, I miss this. Enjoy the struggle.
00:14:48.570 - 00:15:17.012, Speaker A: 666 declined so again, very modern machinery mixed with this almost very dark skeleton with the great colors, the great treatment. Like his great brushes. I think he's in procreate, but it's almost like he has his own. He has brilliant brushes, oxine and so. And the. You know what else I noticed the lettering on here is beautifully done. It's like perfectly done.
00:15:17.012 - 00:15:37.184, Speaker A: Enjoy the struggle. $6.66. Endless shopping spree. You got to buy it now for 28 Tazos edition of 13. And so a super duper cool work again from Uxine. And continuing on, Francoise Gamma. And thanks for the euxine.
00:15:37.184 - 00:15:58.466, Speaker A: Put out a nice comment yesterday, too. Again, it's thrilling. Again, you couldn't ask for anything more if you put a show like this together than for the artists themselves to watch and comment on it. So that's huge. Francoise Gamma thread feed three. So not sure what the title is about. A pretty interesting work.
00:15:58.466 - 00:16:14.054, Speaker A: Looks like a newer kind of work for him. So he does a lot of variations. Or her. I'm not sure if it's Francois. Could be a she. I don't know any details on Francois Gamma buy for $34.90. Is that.
00:16:14.054 - 00:16:33.406, Speaker A: That is not the listing price. So the listing price was only three and it sold out right away. And how long did it take? Yeah, it took about two or 3 hours. So now you gotta pay ten x for this. Francoise Gamma. Pretty cool piece. It all kind of feels like museum work.
00:16:33.406 - 00:16:57.142, Speaker A: And Byte by bit, just minted something this morning here in Berlin or my morning. And I thought it was a great. Another great piece. I picked it up. It's only a Tezos. A very heartwarming beginning to the day. A heartwarming message from Bytebybit, who is using retro software.
00:16:57.142 - 00:17:13.813, Speaker A: So very cool. Buy for a tezos. Maybe send it to your Valentine on Valentine's Day. There's an idea for you. I love you. Animation made by 1988 Fantavision by Bite by bit, who I continue to be a big fan of. So great work there.
00:17:13.813 - 00:17:46.908, Speaker A: So the Bento boxes by Michael Macasso and I can't remember, and Ice Rain have been released. So here they are. They're actually selling for a lot of money as well. So these are, I guess you'd call them generative works on FX, hash XYZ. So it's just very interesting to see what they did here, I think a really just interesting experiment in pixel art. So. And again with it, it's totally recognizably Michael Macasso there too.
00:17:46.908 - 00:18:05.292, Speaker A: Or Mech TXT. And on and on you can go. So what is the floor here? Oh, you can get one for fortezos. Let's just look. So this is how you look at the floor. And of course, the floor are the lowest prices for those that are wondering. So here you go.
00:18:05.292 - 00:18:18.744, Speaker A: So you can start to pick up some works here. Let's look at what's most expensive too, and then we will move on. Yeah, look at that. The more complex is more expensive. Yeah. That is hilarious. So that is 69, 30, 30.
00:18:18.744 - 00:19:19.214, Speaker A: That's funny how value is attributed. A small lesson in how we attribute value to artworks, isn't it? It's just like size, you know, in the physical, contemporary art world, size is, you know, you charge more, the bigger the work is, you know. Does that make sense? I'm not sure. So, new work by Elie Lowe, buy for 270 on secondary. I always like how Elie Lowe sells their work for so cheap, like 0.90. Let's see if this works. So, Elie lo just really just turning heads here as usual.
00:19:19.214 - 00:19:38.482, Speaker A: So let's stop that. So just a really interesting work. Tempting to pick that up. I mean, still cheap at two dot, two tazos. Seventy cents. And again, playing with the trash theme, it's really interesting. I find how Elie Lowe puts themselves in the trash category, because they don't need to, but they choose to.
00:19:38.482 - 00:20:18.302, Speaker A: And so I think that's just very, very interesting and really a testament to that whole trash theme that Robnis V two, I believe, is the pioneer of continuing on. An interesting work by Ed Morolla, the ever prolific Ed Marolla, the masters of Tego Dago, from the collection, Marolla's art shop. So this is a static work. Kind of looks like a planet. And yeah, I don't know what more to say about it. With a lot of abstraction, a lot of work in here. Again, like, as I always say, if Ed Marolla didn't make it, nobody would have made it.
00:20:18.302 - 00:20:38.714, Speaker A: You gotta love artists who are so individual, you know, who are so unique. And so this is an edition of one. Let's just see what happened here. Sold for 15. So if you're looking for one of one art cheap, I do recommend Ed Marolla's page. I have picked up a couple myself, and I love them. I truly love those works.
00:20:38.714 - 00:21:08.332, Speaker A: Continuing on, popple has a new one from the Pixel Ankton series, cosmic drifters. This one is Balanus cirripedia. So I think Popple might have studied, like, biology or something. Pixilantinopleus larva of Balanus Barnacle. You know what this is kind of like. So popple kind of does science fiction, right, in a lot of his work, and with the. But it's not like.
00:21:08.332 - 00:21:56.810, Speaker A: But here, the emphasis is on science and not necessarily, you know, UFO's and, you know, aliens and, you know, it gets more emphasis on science. Always back to Ballard. He was a huge fan of science fiction, but for him, the emphasis was on science. The novelist JG Ballard, and, you know, the language and the iconography of science and technology. And that's how he considered himself a science fiction author, which he considered the true, authentic literature of the 20th century by virtue of the fact that its main subject matter was science and technology. So, interesting. So, you know, I kind of see that when I see here.
00:21:56.810 - 00:22:15.734, Speaker A: And again, the pixel work with the Sci-Fi but emphasis again on science. So. And I love all these little diagrams and everything. And here you see the work. I want to call it bitmap style pixel Ankton. I love how he changes the colors again. This whole series could be screen printed.
00:22:15.734 - 00:22:36.236, Speaker A: I highly recommend that. And he could just change the color of the paper as we commented it on yesterday. Five for six still available. 13 still available. I guess twelve have sold, and limbo just picked one up, so you might want to hurry. Continuing on, balaclava meeting. An interesting work by geek.
00:22:36.236 - 00:22:54.512, Speaker A: And what I particularly liked about this, you can probably guess, is this Henri Matisse in the background, which actually looks like it's done by Morlacos because it's got morlacos. I don't know if you can see that. Maybe I need to make this bigger. Let's see if we can make it bigger. Yeah. Okay. We made it bigger.
00:22:54.512 - 00:23:18.930, Speaker A: There is Morlakos ladder in the sky. So almost a homage to Morlacos there. And so, yeah, so it kind of just brings it all back home here. It just adds, like, sometimes it's just a small little detail in a work that can totally transform it and make it exciting. So, balaclava meeting. We're watching the tv in the geek house. Bye for a tazos.
00:23:18.930 - 00:23:48.580, Speaker A: I'm just curious what happened here? So heads up, Morlakos, you are in a geek work. Continuing on, Metaminta. Who is Minta? Who else can I be? I am attesting that me is me. So, yeah. So how has this not been done yet by Minta? Another meta work by our great meta artist, Minta. So, of course, this is when you get a Tezos profile. I am attesting this twitter handle.
00:23:48.580 - 00:24:04.144, Speaker A: Minta artist is linked to the Tezos account. So this is a screenshot of her attestation of her tweet. So there we go. Pick up for a Tezos. 80. Is this. So these are going.
00:24:04.144 - 00:24:19.656, Speaker A: So one has sold. So you can still get them. And sometimes Minta burns quickly, so get them while you can. Now, we've looked at Grigala's work before. I believe he's the guy that is putting one work per day out. So. And we're kind of.
00:24:19.656 - 00:24:46.162, Speaker A: We weren't calling it digital expressionism. That was someone else's term. But we were referencing Basque as being like, a neo expressionist. And we were starting to categorize some of these kind of works. And, you know, it's almost got a. It's tempting to categorize it for the sake of analysis under this kind of, you know, broad category called neo expressionism, but, you know, with digital painting here. So.
00:24:46.162 - 00:25:02.574, Speaker A: Good morning, friends. A very attractive work continuing on. And this is a piece I missed from this week. Okay. Board me, social club. You asked me if I have God, if I have a God complex. Let me tell you something.
00:25:02.574 - 00:25:20.698, Speaker A: I am God. Okay? So apocalypse now, save the planet, kill yourself. So there seems to be some messaging going in here. There's a lot going on here. Let's just expand this. Beautifully rendered. Frankly, it's just an interesting narrative painting that's going on here.
00:25:20.698 - 00:25:55.014, Speaker A: This looks like some sort of wrestling mask and some alcohol. So just kind of, you know, the walls are different colors, the purple couch, almost the retro phone at this point, especially with that cord that is hanging off. So board me, social club continues to just kind of turn the head a little bit. Very interesting. Buy for 15 from Greco, who's only two tazos on the primary. So nice. Mint price from boardme social Club, rustic digital art.
00:25:55.014 - 00:26:11.064, Speaker A: Also put out a new one called Pardon. And this features a lot of people. Mikey Wilson, Modem three, Los Marlacos, Ratclok. See the myth. So here you can see Ratclok. See, here you can see the myth. And you can go through the whole crew here.
00:26:11.064 - 00:26:38.012, Speaker A: So pardon, I think is how we'd pronounce that, maybe. Pardon. This kind of looks like, I want to call it like Ozymandias. There is a broken statue here, which could mean a lot of different things. Maybe it's referencing when all those statues were broken a couple of years ago. I want to say all those kind of civil war statues, because look, this almost looks like a civil war uniform. Let's see if we have any details here.
00:26:38.012 - 00:27:11.560, Speaker A: We don't. Fallen statue of rustic digital art. But maybe that's him. So who knows? This looks like what you'd call, I believe, an arcade with all these arches and almost like a roman piazza, remember? So this has been finished, it has been minted and is available on primary for 15 tazos. And rustic digital arts work tends to go up generally. Some of these, like some of these paintings, look, you got to pay 150. Not taking the offer.
00:27:11.560 - 00:27:28.240, Speaker A: This one's 50. Not taking the offer of 15. So anyways, this looks like a very promising work here. Continuing on. Look at this. I can't remember where I saw this, if it was Twitter or maybe it was even the object homepage. I don't remember.
00:27:28.240 - 00:27:47.002, Speaker A: I think it was Twitter. But this was Matthias Moreno. Buy for 35. Is that primary? No, that's secondary. Von Doyle has one for sale for 66. So how much was the mint price on this? Only five. And this is interesting, there's a few things going on here, so first, let's just look.
00:27:47.002 - 00:28:42.780, Speaker A: So Ovid's metamorphoses, a roman writer, I don't think you'd call it an epic, but a catalog of tales. One of the main sources of a lot of myths is actually Ovid's metamorphosis, not because he wrote them, but because that's the only source we have for some of these myths. Written in eight ad. He was exiled out of Rome, actually, by Augustus, and he never actually got in, probably for his erotic love poetry and how to seduce. And Augustus was very kind of, what's the word? Not prudish, but he was very much a law and order kind of guy, so we might call him fairly conservative. So according to Ovid's metamorphoses, the oracle of Delphi told the phoenician prince Cadmus to follow a cow and build a city. At the first place, it decided to lie down.
00:28:42.780 - 00:29:12.128, Speaker A: The cow collapsed at the future site of Thebes. The companions of Cadmus sent out to fetch water, disturbed a dragon, a son of Ares, the God of war, who was guarding a well. The dragon emerged from its cave and savagely killed the men. To this observation should be added the gruesome immediacy of the unequal struggle between the dragon and Cadmus's men. Okay, so, yeah, I actually just read this, like, a few months ago. Finally, finally. Finally, I read Ovid's metamorphoses.
00:29:12.128 - 00:29:40.462, Speaker A: I didn't like the translation, so it took me forever. Anyways, continuing on, this is important here, the violence of the narrative is portrayed in gruesome detail in the foreground and continues in the background, where Cadmus can be glimpsed fighting the beast. In revenge, Cadmus slayed the dragon. So this is why I read all this. So you can see in the back here, Cadmus fighting the dragon. But here the dragon is again. So you know what this is called in italian Renaissance painting.
00:29:40.462 - 00:30:28.586, Speaker A: I believe we touched on this on a very early episode. I believe the term is simultaneous narrative, where you have more than one narrative going on in the same painting. You know, it's kind of like the pre comic book, you know? So this is, like, probably late. This is probably earlier, and Bitcoin's raining down the gold, and this is probably later when Cadmus finally kills the dragon by piercing it through the mouth. So, yeah, so very gruesome, but a very powerful work. So, anyways, a little greek mythology here via our roman writer Ovid, who Shakespeare loved. Here's a little detail for you because.
00:30:28.586 - 00:30:51.128, Speaker A: And he's kind of well known. Ovid, for his just very kind of colorful poetry is the wrong word. It's like, very. Just, like visceral, like, sensational. You know, like he was. You know, people loved his poetry. Anyways, continuing on here is another greek poet as we go into AI here, or greek myth, Ariadne.
00:30:51.128 - 00:31:10.612, Speaker A: And this also references theseus. This is by red rum. And he has a new work on super rare. Let's just read this. Then we'll look at the work like Ariadne's thread that saved theseus from the labyrinth. The same thread binds us today and leads us to eternity. So this is the work.
00:31:10.612 - 00:31:32.988, Speaker A: So I assume AI, which is kind of redrum's calling card right now. Pretty impressive. Okay. Like, after again playing with all these tools, it takes a lot of skill to get these prompts right and to upload stuff. It's. What was I calling? It's almost like a kind of visual or even conceptual sculpture. Like, you're kind of.
00:31:32.988 - 00:31:50.800, Speaker A: You have your initial thing, and then you go in again and you're kind of sculpting it. You're kind of going, more of this, less of that. So again, I encourage everybody to use the tools. I'm probably late to the party. You've probably, probably most of you have used them. He accepted an offer for 1.5 ETH.
00:31:50.800 - 00:32:14.870, Speaker A: So AI art continues to be super hot. Okay. It's a pretty nice price. Let's just look at if this is the only work he has up here, because I know he's kind of new to super rare. That is his only work here. So pretty nice beginning for redrum. A cool $2,400 ETH's getting more expensive these days.
00:32:14.870 - 00:32:54.886, Speaker A: Continuing on the AI front, refic anadol. This was retweeted by Clownvamp. So this person, Refik Anadol, seems to have a show at MoMA. I'm deeply honored and excited to announce our exhibition unsupervised opening on the 19 November at MoMA. It's a dream of many artists to have the opportunity to imagine, practice and exhibit for such an important institution that supports the creativity of humanity. So it looks like, and I'm going to kill the music here, it looks like a AI art, AI artist from what I understand. So this seems to be somewhat of a preview.
00:32:54.886 - 00:33:27.114, Speaker A: Remember how I was just talking yesterday? I'd love to see a work on just like floor to ceiling on a wall at MoMA that worked by. I'm going to get her name wrong. Uvaladul, who opened yesterday's show. Well, this is kind of what I had in mind. And here we are. So things are moving very quickly in the NFT world. So continuing on, this is another just little tidbit that I thought we should pay attention to.
00:33:27.114 - 00:34:08.440, Speaker A: Carson Catry put out a tweet. Experiments with stable diffusion to texture 3d models fully automatically in blender. So blender, from my understanding, is a 3d rendering tool. Like basically you can create objects. I think that's how you get a lot of these turning, you know, like, I think that's how a lot of people get, you know, a keyboard or a computer that's going in a circle. I think it's blender. I've never used it, but interestingly, it looks like there's a plugin or something where you can put stable diffusion AI software into blender, and here they're using it to create textures.
00:34:08.440 - 00:34:43.004, Speaker A: Just enter a text prompt, hit a button, and it wraps your model in a texture. So experiments with using stable diffusion to texture 3d models fully automatically in blender. So things are getting pretty wild out there on the tech AI front. Continuing on, we have a new work by Ilya Shkipin. And again, this is a AI work that has been combined with painting, with digital painting on top. And I thought, just really interesting work. Look at this interesting texture here.
00:34:43.004 - 00:35:11.912, Speaker A: And again, I continue to be fascinated by this combination of AI and digital painting. And Ilya Shipkin does it very, very well. One of one at auction for 100 tezos. And someone has put on a bid here. So let's just see, 14 hours to go, so. And the minimum bid was 100 tezos. So someone has met the minimum bid.
00:35:11.912 - 00:35:33.248, Speaker A: Pretty nice work. Continuing on, we're almost done. So here we're hitting physical works as nfts. One of our favorite guys walk. And again, it's sort of like Dan control. You know, spray paint was never my favorite tool. Just like the gradient tool on Photoshop is not my favorite tool.
00:35:33.248 - 00:35:54.860, Speaker A: But these guys are total, totally making it work. Okay, and look at this. So Diego, spray on paper, 50 by 62, starting at 0.35 ETH reserves. So this is on foundation. And this is also what I want to highlight. So, Diego Maradona, of course, the physical artwork will be shipped to the collector.
00:35:54.860 - 00:36:44.828, Speaker A: And if I'm a gallery and I'm seeing this start to happen more and more, I do start to get concerned because this kind of should be how it works. If you ask me, the only risk, the only drawback is you could argue the security for the collector. Of course, when we buy a digital art piece online, the blockchain basically secures everything. So we know we're going to get that piece when we give the money. That is the only thing. But, I mean, Wok has a reputation to protect and so does everybody who sells, who is on the platform. So I assume once you kind of have enough of a, quote, reputation, why can't you sell digital or physical work via digital means? And then, you know, people are going to assume that, you know, walk is going to send Diego to them and I'm sure he would.
00:36:44.828 - 00:37:17.202, Speaker A: Right? So, you know, so available for 0.35 ETH and maybe hopefully this doesn't kill anything here right at the end. Let's just take a look here so you can get a physical work. And walk was experimenting with eBay as well. So anyways, I think this is a fascinating thing. We saw it with Gabby Walter as well, who sold his Mona Lisa painting via digital marketplaces. Interesting, interesting, interesting.
00:37:17.202 - 00:37:30.814, Speaker A: So with that, my friends, I have another work by walk. I'm going to show you of Leonardo's self portrait as we exit out of here. Thank you once again, for joining me. Until next time, take care.
