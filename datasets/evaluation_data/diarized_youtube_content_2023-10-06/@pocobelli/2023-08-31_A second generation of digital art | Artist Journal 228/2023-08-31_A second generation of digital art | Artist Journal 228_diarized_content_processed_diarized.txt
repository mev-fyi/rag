00:00:03.920 - 00:00:36.640, Speaker A: I hope you're ready for a fast paced show. This one by no choice of my own. I'm gonna have to finish in like half an hour. So, good news, maybe. Welcome back, everyone, to artist Journal, August 31, 2023. Broadcasting from the cruise ship of the mind in Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pokebelly, and again, this is gonna be a sprint, so almost apologies in advance to the artists if I am going too fast through your work.
00:00:36.640 - 00:01:20.158, Speaker A: It is simply what has to be done. Let's start with Retro Manny here with the super cool work. Check it out. This is me right now. Pretty cool. I mean, pretty awesome. A one of one, a prototype.
00:01:20.158 - 00:01:38.504, Speaker A: So retro, man. So I guess this is the video game. We saw the comics in the gallery that Retro Manny was showing in the bedroom. You saw the posters. Let's quickly look at Retro Manny's page here, if it loads up. Having Internet issues here, too. Here we go.
00:01:38.504 - 00:02:04.534, Speaker A: And here, right? So all these were up in the bedroom. And we did a big Twitter space on all, on each one of these covers. So you can check that out and follow along. If you're curious, you can check out Retro Manny's work. So anyways, very cool work. We discuss the influence of video games on what I call the second generation of digital art. I dare say, and feel free to disagree with that and say, no, that's all wrong.
00:02:04.534 - 00:03:56.592, Speaker A: But it seems to me that especially with what we see with pixel art, and this is more according to the artists than to me, but, you know, synthesizing and gathering everything they've said, it seems to me that there is basically a, you know, we were discussing it yesterday in the Twitter spaces, which is actually up next here with Ed Marolla. This idea that video games and the visual paradigm, for lack of better word, of visual games, is analogous to what happened with photography. This is the hypothesis that basically, as we were discussing a couple of Twitter spaces ago, that in the same way that maybe photography changed the way that we kind of shifted our visual reality to a certain degree, or our visual understanding, shall we say, impacted, influenced, changed the way we saw the world when we saw it frozen in time, maybe video games for the, you know, for, you know, 1980s up generations, maybe that's impacting their visual understanding in a profound way, and maybe that's why we're seeing the rise of pixel art. So that's kind of the background behind this idea of the second generation of digital art. So it's digital art that's made with that influence, with that kind of paradigm shift or visual shift, shall we say in visual understanding. So big thank you to everybody who came out to Edmarola and Runetune and mice and the Twitter space with myself, Ed Marolla and Runartune yesterday. It was awesome.
00:03:56.592 - 00:04:24.754, Speaker A: It was super interesting. I felt like we got some, you know, if this becomes a historical scene of sorts, I felt like we got some important information from a super prolific, well known, amazing pixel artist from Edmarola. So thank you, Edmarola and everybody for coming out and enjoying it. And big thank you. I finally minted my first piece on Zora and yeah, 17 minted. So I was thrilled about that. And this is the promoted stories.
00:04:24.754 - 00:05:08.112, Speaker A: That was actually my first show in Berlin was called Promoted Stories. So I've been working with these screenshots of what I call trashy news, tabloid links that are often at the bottom of news articles here, 20 foods that combat diabetes. What was interesting for me about this work was the efficiency of it, because it is using a screenshot and then I use the outputs of these different kind of screens that you can find software that gives you different outputs and then mixing them all together and then making a work out of it. So it felt very efficient because it was a screenshot working with screen outputs. And I really liked that. So I'm going to do more working on another one. Really enjoying this series on Zora.
00:05:08.112 - 00:05:21.040, Speaker A: Promoted stories. Thank you for the collects, everybody out there. Just a couple of comments here. This is hilarious. Kyle Flemmer, typewriter art yesterday, hypertext literature today. Amazing. Glad to hear you.
00:05:21.040 - 00:05:48.464, Speaker A: Speaking of unconventional literary forms and text art, as these are among my primary research interests. Also surprised to learn you studied in Saskatchewan. I'm in Calgary, which is probably the closest big city to Saskatoon. Shout out to mom over in Saskatoon. Calgary is about five and a half hour drive away. Happy to report that typewriter art and hypertextlet are alive and well in the prairies. So hilarious.
00:05:48.464 - 00:06:01.232, Speaker A: Great show. Thank you, thank you. PP. It's a cow, not a donkey. And Fornack's void inspired tradscape. That is very likely after everything we learned. So very cool.
00:06:01.232 - 00:06:32.204, Speaker A: I mean, still very distinct styles, but you can see an influence for sure. And cider love Cuompa. Yes, indeed. And we also heard from demon ego. He commented yesterday when he was at the start of the show. It's always a pleasure for me to be included in the artist's journal, and there's nothing that nourishes my art and opens my horizons more than hearing the voices of another eye and mind about my work. As you mentioned, it is of course very difficult to find harmony between digital art and physical art and to maintain a balance between media.
00:06:32.204 - 00:07:06.816, Speaker A: Thanks to the experiments, I've been constantly practicing and sometimes it happened. Now I'm getting the results. I said, the more materials on the table, the more ideas and the more possibilities are there. Thus I get fresher results by combining my ideas in my mind with my old practices without getting bored. So the real takeaway here is demon ego is echoing the thought that I was having that it's actually pretty difficult to harmonize digital and physical media. Again, very sharp contrast. The pixels look just super sharp.
00:07:06.816 - 00:07:38.672, Speaker A: It's almost too sharp. They feel like two different realities. So to actually mix them together in a harmonious way, so to speak, where the piece retains a kind of unity, is not actually that easy. And demon ego is echoing that big shout out to human boy who's on a cruise right now from a cruise ship on the seas of the pirate ship of the seas. Just wanted to share your some art. And I am seeing here while on vacation, so I thought this was great. So on the cruise ship, the imagination that human boy is on, there is actually a huge art gallery.
00:07:38.672 - 00:07:57.074, Speaker A: So how cool is that? They think of everything on these galleries. There's even some video. And he gave actually, I think a few more shots. I thought this was. So here you see a magritte. If we had more time, I'd bring up this original Magritte. It's a hyper realistic Magritte.
00:07:57.074 - 00:08:17.306, Speaker A: And here you see thread. And again, this is made of spools of thread. And this is actually something you can probably do digitally. And tapestry is a whole other. We saw Kristen Rus play with it, with the weaving of those pixelated works. So there's huge potential there. And I just wanted to highlight that.
00:08:17.306 - 00:08:38.104, Speaker A: So very cool. Thanks for the photos, human boy. And here it was, in fact, James and the giant peach tater tots at the end of last episode here. Really happy. You totally got the Roald Dahl reference and also correct about the oil pastels, plus watercolors for background. Thanks again. So that is awesome.
00:08:38.104 - 00:09:10.614, Speaker A: Shout out to tater tots. And finally, rinnefish just finished printing some bugs on fabric also. We'll show you soon. So working with fabric. So again, we're totally fascinated and interested in this relationship, in this transmogrification, this transformation, this alchemical transformation from digital to physical. Speaking of which, in epic mode, Karim Safa, look up Manchester. This looks like a whole side of a building has a Kareem safa on it.
00:09:10.614 - 00:09:33.918, Speaker A: I mean, wow. So that is pretty rad. So very interesting. Continuing on, and here we see more of digital art getting out on the scene. You see axin, you see isolationists. Thank you. And then you see Bezaya and you see myth.
00:09:33.918 - 00:09:56.584, Speaker A: And so just very cool. And Michele Colonna, who has his gallery, is actually a part of this. So I didn't realize that. So that is cool. So Krypton is started by my friend and avid collector Michele Colonna. So we are a three man team, along with Adam Disbrow and I guess probably Mikey de la creme. So how cool is that? And look at how great that looks.
00:09:56.584 - 00:10:21.090, Speaker A: So give them a follow and maybe buy some of their work if you like it. And here's Michele Colonna's, the Kelowna Contemporary gallery. So look at how much Michele is doing. Really cool. There's a crypto punk there and some art on the wall. And we've seen this gallery before, so just really cool. Sunrise and futuristic on view at the gallery, so doing really cool things.
00:10:21.090 - 00:10:39.520, Speaker A: I believe this is eight. So Montreal pals doing a show tomorrow night, trying out this new CRT DJ booth. How cool is that? So some retro tvs. It's like an installation of sorts in the DJ booth. Interesting. Trying out an SVG export function for the farbs. Maybe the colors.
00:10:39.520 - 00:11:01.736, Speaker A: This is german for colors. Or maybe that's referencing something else. Look at this. So almost has a bit of a Rizzo print feel to this one. Interestingly. And just different paper, so just more fascinating pen plotting. Eric Swan Robnuss artist gimmicks are just that.
00:11:01.736 - 00:11:18.384, Speaker A: And no matter how insanely talented it gets, it can dry. It can get dry and real fast. Humans are like this, though. Easily amused by tricks, but always moving on. If the tricks are the same kind of how you can get bored of AI from time to time. So a couple of comments here. First, play the long game.
00:11:18.384 - 00:12:30.464, Speaker A: When in terms of, you know, your artistic practice, if you're in it for the long haul, you might as well play the long game. And I think this is actually probably why I mentioned this. And I'm not bored of AI, but I feel like there's a lull in AI. I feel like just as sensing, putting your finger in the wind and sensing what's going on out there, I do feel kind of the first wave or maybe the second, the last wave of AI art that kind of waved through, I feel like is kind of passing through and we're waiting for the next wave, perhaps, or the novelty is wearing off a little bit. So interesting because this is something I've noticed in the last few weeks and I've noticed there hasn't been as much AI. We're going to have some and I still love it and I still work with it, but it's interesting to just kind of sense that big picture also unknown collector on so foundation has introduced moments big shout out to Kiro DJ Quiro for sending me this article we're going to look at shortly here. It's crazy how foundation always delivers.
00:12:30.464 - 00:13:15.386, Speaker A: I was struggling that I had to separate create separate worlds if I want to make different exhibitions. This over time gets messy. So they've added a feature to the curation tools in foundation now with moments you can just create one world and treat every moment as the curated exhibition or drop like that. You can tell every story separated but also have it all in in one place. Sad thing is I will have to separate future exhibitions from my world unknown self as I can't change name and curator fee there anymore. But it also makes it more special. So people unknown collector has been curating, so getting excited about the curation tools and here there is an article from NFT now and this looks like kuros.
00:13:15.386 - 00:13:55.594, Speaker A: Is this kuros? I'm not sure if this is Kiro's world here. Euphoria four so worlds represent. So this what it looks like here is they wanted to put it all on chain where you can take okay, here we go. Taking a closer look at world's latest enhancements enhancements moments. Three key aspects stand out. The ability to schedule, promote and track performance. So scheduling also enables.
00:13:55.594 - 00:14:28.480, Speaker A: Scheduling enables worldbuilders to curate a moment with their dashboard by selecting items from their inventory. So you can read the whole thing on NFT now, but from the sounds of it, it sounds like you can. What they're doing is they're keeping it all on chain. You can take your world with you. I remember reading so you're not kind of stuck on foundation necessarily like they are making the curation. Here we go. We're designing worlds to be an on chain protocol.
00:14:28.480 - 00:14:58.434, Speaker A: Anyone can build on top of it. Your world is yours. And if we cease to exist, everything valuable about it would be on chain and fully in your control. So that is really interesting. Turanian, who we just quoted, pointed out the underlying value of on chain design, explaining that worlds are designated to be portable, ownable, web3 native projects. We won't want curators and world builders to simply trust us. That's not a web3 native approach to product design.
00:14:58.434 - 00:15:31.044, Speaker A: So props and credit to foundation, who continues to build for the artists and the curators. First, brilliant onto our work here, as we are going to have to run through the last works here. Dini P. Thibodeau, aka Hasdrubal waffle, with a few works here, dude. And so here you just have a tennis player and just another beautiful portrait by hasdrubal playing ping pong. Interesting title. Do and OD and dude.
00:15:31.044 - 00:15:57.170, Speaker A: So a little bit of punning there, baby. Barbra L. I quite like this one where we have the fuzzy kind of pixels here with these really sharp pixels here, and kind of like a bar fight. And you see the beer kind of flying around. So another cool improvisation here by Dinny P. Thibodeaux, aka Hasdrubal waffle. And here's another one.
00:15:57.170 - 00:16:32.012, Speaker A: Cop skateboard scene from police academy for citizens on patrol. And I was going to bring up, actually, hasdrubal was mentioning high rise, the movie based on the novel by JG Ballard. I haven't seen it, but I do want to see it. After hisdrubal was mentioned, it was one of those ones I was kind of neutral on. Like, I was kind of interested, but not. I wasn't running out to go find it as a Ballard aficionado, but it's one of the funniest and best books. It's one of the most readable books by Ballard in terms of if you're new, sometimes I recommend high rise to people.
00:16:32.012 - 00:16:54.506, Speaker A: If they're new to Ballard and they're trying to get a sense of what he's about. It's actually a really good novel to start with. So also here. So cop, here's another one. So police academy four is the reference here. And again, apologies for going so fast through these. Do you experience alien boredom? Again, another, just beautifully textured, using different.
00:16:54.506 - 00:17:16.754, Speaker A: Looks like different software in this one, you got an alien here. The guy ellipse everything. It's beautiful. And then some kind of flat pixel clip art thrush is fun. Maybe a human kernel reference here. Maybe that's Santiago, RJ with another beautiful work here. They're still available.
00:17:16.754 - 00:17:50.926, Speaker A: Kind of interesting for a couple of reasons. So, first of all, it's beautiful. And the colors are beautiful, as RJ always does. And you have to love his laptop kind of screensaver works. Another interesting thing to note, though, is you see the plants, there's actually movement here, which is kind of different for RJ. And there's also a little bit of experimentation with slightly changing colors here, too. So interesting experimentation here from RJ.
00:17:50.926 - 00:18:14.470, Speaker A: The purple room still available on primary for 15 tezos and continuing on Kapn. Put this out on Twitter and I don't think this has been released. Sometimes Kapn will release works like months before minting them. So that's kind of what this looks like. It might be beautiful. A day inside a dream. More mystical pixel art, as I like to call it, from Capn.
00:18:14.470 - 00:18:43.182, Speaker A: And here's another one. Bgm quests for the musicians of Tezos. I'll be collaborating with music friends from the community to create some unique audio visuals so it looks like he's going to try out a few musical experiments here, collaborations with figments project and really cool, just add here with the notes and then the pixels moving underneath. It all comes to life. Beautifully done. Beautiful animations. Nocturnal fireflight, a bonfire's ode to friendship.
00:18:43.182 - 00:19:07.544, Speaker A: So this is with empanauga, so already beginning here. And a campfire scene. Oh, we're gonna have to run. But look at how great this is, the fire. I mean, look at how beautiful that pixelated fire is. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. It's beautiful.
00:19:07.544 - 00:19:29.634, Speaker A: So awesome work that goes for two minutes. Is that sold out? It must be. It's not listed yet. Maybe it is. By the time you watch this mech TXT, I don't remember seeing this one. I mean, is so prolific. We were discussing yesterday how, you know, experience in the business world can really help you get prolific and work fast.
00:19:29.634 - 00:19:50.026, Speaker A: And I kind of feel, you know, Mech TXT has his own design studio. I think he has collaborator on that too. And you just see how much work that mech TXT puts out. This is gorgeous. That almost looks like, you know, Shakespeare. Maybe some sort of 16th or 17th, 18th century, 17th century kind of dutch nobleman, perhaps. Some meteors.
00:19:50.026 - 00:20:03.654, Speaker A: Classic reference. Beautiful monuments. This is awesome. This only sold for 22 tezos. I almost got in, but I just didn't have time, frankly. And I don't have the Tezos right now. I need to saw some work on tezos.
00:20:03.654 - 00:20:15.510, Speaker A: This is awesome. Stevie Wonder in the Canary Islands. This awesome 1993. Cool. Like maybe cactus tree or something. And Stevie Wonder. It almost looks like it was made on a phone.
00:20:15.510 - 00:20:32.638, Speaker A: One of one portrait of Stevie Wonder at the Canary Islands. This is by dates. This is awesome. I came very close to starting with this beautiful, beautiful work by datest. Really awesome. Again, 22 tazos. Huge deal.
00:20:32.638 - 00:20:48.656, Speaker A: It's just one of those works that's so special. It's just got like, as we like to say, some of those works. Just some works. Just hit that one. Totally hits pink psycho. This is by bizaya. And it's a new work on super rare.
00:20:48.656 - 00:21:06.942, Speaker A: Nice reserve price .2, $341 to get things started. And this was minted yesterday. And so do we have life is that thing that happens to you while you try to tame your inner demons. So continuing with the cool colors here. Really nice work. Nice to see a mint on super rare from Bezaya.
00:21:06.942 - 00:21:33.194, Speaker A: Classic sneakers and everything. Beautiful dan control saucer. So remixing, reusing elements here. The chair, and I believe he's used the plant before, making a new work. So again, we start to approach that, reusing elements. You know, it's not copying the entire works, but, I mean, maybe there's a chair before in the work and he just puts the plant on top. And now I have a new work.
00:21:33.194 - 00:22:02.602, Speaker A: I love it. I have to say, from a conceptual point of view, it's very interesting, you know, this again, the tension of digital copies. Beasts on a leash, new work by gloomtube. And this is our gloom tube figure here with some kind of satanic figures here. Some devils on a kind of rotating around here. And this is with earth in the background. So kind of a cosmic work here.
00:22:02.602 - 00:22:20.722, Speaker A: Beasts on a leash by available on secondary for 16 tezos. Then it goes right up to 44 from gloom tube. So cool work, nice texture in the background, nice gradient. And continuing on Yuri J. I mean, again, this is like the last 48 hours. It's insane. Beautiful work by Yuri jay here.
00:22:20.722 - 00:22:35.598, Speaker A: What was this called? It's on super rare as well. And no title. Oh, fishing. Fishing party. There is a title. So fishing party. So maybe at the dock, there's the guy, and there's maybe the little lake.
00:22:35.598 - 00:22:48.118, Speaker A: It's beautiful. Really nice work from Yuri J. No reserve. Rinnefish ready. So it looks like a work has been prepared here. Very interesting color. Classic rinne fish.
00:22:48.118 - 00:23:19.540, Speaker A: And there is one of the creatures skipping rope here and everything. So nice. Classic pastels and everything. And here's a work by junkedelik in working class. They've done it before. And you can hear like a cool, really cool nineties track here. We're gonna have to run.
00:23:19.540 - 00:23:39.736, Speaker A: When I hear rappers, ain't no kind of fear factor. So very, very cool. Cool artwork here, too. Great collaboration. Wastewind gold Minovitch with a really interesting kind of different kind of work. I'm not going to leave it on too long because of the flash, but seeming to reference x. And that is an open edition.
00:23:39.736 - 00:23:58.970, Speaker A: And those are selling for one tezos each. Nice illustration here from Seba Sistero GM, everyone kind of this, you know, just big. It almost looks like a Christo wrapping of sorts. But who knows? Just interesting. Surreal drawing by Seba Sestaro. Haven't seen their work for a while. Good to see them.
00:23:58.970 - 00:24:16.624, Speaker A: Turkarak boy who looks like his father, you know, Turkarak with another really original work like this is. I've never seen a work like this. The title is awesome. I think it's quite brilliant. A one of one for 15 tezos. Reasonable, if you ask me. Nice and painterly.
00:24:16.624 - 00:24:35.628, Speaker A: Interesting work, this Tesnown. There are a ton of deals on the blockchain here. 65 tezos. This is pretty cheap for a Tesnown. It's by burka Bayram, well known figure on tezos here. So there is a classic burka byram work with the glasses. A brilliant solution, making it look easy.
00:24:35.628 - 00:25:01.804, Speaker A: Timothy Jullienne melted. So kind of half outdoor feeling. I think you'd call this an arcade. And this is getting a little more abstract, isn't it? Kind of feels half indoor, half outdoor. There's a pool. So interesting development from Timothy Julien and a new work by Pamelo Serrano. Serrano on Zora 23 minted.
00:25:01.804 - 00:25:41.312, Speaker A: And just another really cool kind of pixel artwork with kind of an illustrative feel to it. Nice work by Taino miking. Just capturing the zeitgeist here of a lot of these works with a kind of a game boy in someone playing what looks like an old vintage video game console. So cool there. De berries playing with the dancing ants and playing with these different textures here. So playing with what looks like the selection tool and maybe doing a screen record into a gif. And here you see some big figures with little heads here.
00:25:41.312 - 00:26:05.114, Speaker A: Nice, interesting work. Cool colors too, from Dabares. Did that sell? Sold only for three tazos. One of one stippin pixel with a cool catwork. Did I bring it up? I must have just brought up the twitter. So this is on Zora as well. So another cat and really cool, kind of minimal from stip and pixel.
00:26:05.114 - 00:26:13.402, Speaker A: 30 hours to go. And p one. So more music. Look at this. Cool. So this is a vinyl piece. And then.
00:26:13.402 - 00:26:29.254, Speaker A: So that's an edition of 20. And I think if you buy this work. So more. More music. So it's cool how much music is coming out. Dog by Chunky boy ep three. Hot dog by p one.
00:26:29.254 - 00:26:58.498, Speaker A: And so it looks like if you buy this, maybe you get the other one, maybe you get the vinyl sent to you. So really cool. P one. Decraci Jeffrey with just a cool animation. I assume it's by them, it seems to be slightly different from their usual style, which is kind of illustrative, if I remember correctly. Anyway, interesting animation here. Cool dithering and everything from decracy.
00:26:58.498 - 00:27:21.244, Speaker A: Jeffrey Nicholas Sassoon hardware study. This is pretty nice as well. And you almost see like these, kind of like the lines you'd see going down to analog tv, but applied to basically digital pixel art. Fascinating. And Loac me with a work, and this is on, I think, ten. So that's pretty cool. Sorry.
00:27:21.244 - 00:27:39.070, Speaker A: Zero one art. Two sides to the story. 27 of a hundred maybe are still available. So very cool here. So I didn't realize Loac me was also on zero one. So lots of opportunities here for digital artists to put out their work to different audiences on different. Here's zero one.
00:27:39.070 - 00:27:56.732, Speaker A: Sorry. Here's Zora ditherscape. Zero three. And a cool work here by Andre Oliveira. And continuing on, a beautiful new work by Sabato. We have a couple of interesting works by Sabato. I love this series.
00:27:56.732 - 00:28:29.924, Speaker A: It's again, like, a lot. It sort of reminds me of the Corel draw series in the sense that you're sort of. It's so different that you can be a little slow to get it, but over time and overseeing more pieces getting released, you start to really enjoy and see where the psychological exploration that's going on here. And just this interesting kind of panning. And this figure here, just mysterious, enigmatic work from Sabato. Collect for 666 minted on tea 21. Available.
00:28:29.924 - 00:28:44.480, Speaker A: Here's an interesting experiment. Romcode studies by Sabato collected on zero one. So Sabato is everywhere. Really interesting work here. It looks like true glitch. Look at this. So interesting textures.
00:28:44.480 - 00:29:18.462, Speaker A: And this is donia. Let me just get some on super rare. So more glitch art this time on super rare from Donia. So pretty cool work. Kind of feels like pop culture y. The music reference there, not sure. 424.2
00:29:18.462 - 00:29:37.950, Speaker A: ETH on super rare digital daydreams. Cool title. Micah Alidoff and drain. So a collaboration here. And just cool. Kind of similar colors that we've seen in the last three works as the glitch. Guys, guys and girls and everyone, as they start to just, you know, when they kind of.
00:29:37.950 - 00:30:02.782, Speaker A: Just when they kind of glitch something they don't control and you just start to see, like, all of the colors come through. So interesting similarity in color content between these three works. Continuing on, James Usil Felsen ref after David Friedrich. So that is great. And another cool kind of glitch. Work with big chunky pixels. That is a one of one.
00:30:02.782 - 00:30:20.122, Speaker A: And it went for only seven tezos. So tons of deals out there right now. Here's a one of one from Eizo for 25 tezos. Another cell phone. So we are learning the history of cell phones visually here. Cool masking and everything. This is by Ericsson 380 reals.
00:30:20.122 - 00:30:51.764, Speaker A: And here's x mortal with a cool kind of classic flower opening segment, so to speak. And this is analog video glitch is, I think, how you'd call that. That is available for 19 tezos on secondary. So sold out for five tezos pretty quickly there. But from exmortal doctor version with a cool new work. This is a one of one. Really nice kind of textures up top here.
00:30:51.764 - 00:31:19.992, Speaker A: And again, kind of feels like, uh, also like Yves Tenguy. And I'd love to bring up some of those Yves Tenguy works, the late ones from like, the forties, maybe even the fifties, uh, beautiful, surreal work. Of course, huge fan of Roberto Mata. Big shout out to doctor version, Spiegels maskinen with a GLB. So a little preview of this GLB, which will probably be a 3d file that we're going to be able to, you know, move around. Tuks. Sweet dreams, fam.
00:31:19.992 - 00:31:40.522, Speaker A: So this may be older, I'm not sure, but I hadn't seen it before, so I thought I would add it into the mix as we move into AI here. And here's another AI work. I love the title of this artists and their problems. A brilliant title and interesting work. AI artwork from Tuks. And I guess that's the artist. And Evelyn.
00:31:40.522 - 00:31:49.354, Speaker A: Tomorrow, Evelyn. Oh, tomorrow I will start a new collection. It's against common sense. It's raw AI. It's multiple styles. It's on ETH. And is it art? Syntax error.
00:31:49.354 - 00:32:10.398, Speaker A: An artist's journal of raw AI. An ongoing project consisting of thoughts about the space feelings. So watch out for that. And big shout out to Evelyn o who helped me find some great ways to make images bigger online. Very cool artist. Of course you recognize this. This is Wok with trap house.
00:32:10.398 - 00:32:26.354, Speaker A: And this is beautiful. I feel like I've seen it before, but I'm not sure. And it's so beautiful that I want to show it again. Look at how brilliant. I mean, this is so beautiful, this mark making here with the spray can. And same here. And even here.
00:32:26.354 - 00:32:43.574, Speaker A: Extremely original work. This artist is amazing. I don't know if it's for sale. Maybe it already sold. Not sure. And a few more nugget brain works because I love nugget brain wax pastel drawing from my current show landscape still life and other things at bricks gallery. So wax pastel.
00:32:43.574 - 00:33:17.882, Speaker A: I didn't realize that nugget brain was using wax pastel. That almost explains everything, doesn't it? Because I was like how, you know, other people are using paintbrushes. Why is this so different? Is it just slightly. It's wax pastel. So the power of using different kinds of mediums, I mean, that is a huge lesson in go. It's, you know what it reminds me of? Is Kappan going to find retro software or even Haiti rocket going and finding retro software that no one else is using. And there you go.
00:33:17.882 - 00:33:32.144, Speaker A: You have art that doesn't look like anybody else's but it's still like familiar. This is just a brilliant series here. Awesome, awesome artist. And that is your show. My friends, thank you for your patience as I run through the show. Until next time, take care.
