00:00:06.880 - 00:00:58.992, Speaker A: Four artists by artists Artist journal, October 4, 2022, Berlin. My name is Adrian Pokebelli, and I welcome you back. As I keep saying, I think most of the people that watch this program are in this program. And you know what? I wouldn't have it any other way. That is the best. And I was thinking to myself in the shower, as you know, all the thoughts seem to come when I put the shampoo and I start scratching, you know, putting, and the blood goes into your brain, and also all the thoughts come out. And I was thinking to myself, is there another show in the world like this? You know, just a open, friendly question, and I don't know.
00:00:58.992 - 00:01:25.064, Speaker A: Not that I know of. Usually it's some tv presenter or some curator. That's, I was going to say, that's read too many books. I'm a big fan of reading books. And, you know, education, as I always say, is the great leveler. There is no greater leveler in society across the classes, for lack of better word, than education. So hopefully this is educational, too.
00:01:25.064 - 00:01:43.614, Speaker A: Here's a fantastic work by Joni B. Just minted a few minutes ago. I was trying to think of the name of the color here, fuchsia and the blinking eyes. Unapologetic. I was thinking to myself, unapologetically digital. This is unapologetically digital work. Let's come back to this, though.
00:01:43.614 - 00:02:06.314, Speaker A: There are a couple of things I would like to touch on Wasteman. Gold Minevich, back on the scene, back on the program, commenting on raw AI. And Wasteman has done a lot of raw AI, so let's see what he has to say. Hi, Adrian. He was talking about the raw AI show. Hi, Adrian. An interesting topic, raw AI as art.
00:02:06.314 - 00:03:16.772, Speaker A: I'm thinking it being raw AI is fine, maybe analogous, although not identical, to something like collage, where correspondences between elements are often serendipitous and get kept, if this makes sense. Yeah, I think when you're putting in your prompt, you don't know what's going to come out. And in that sense, it is analogous to, okay, before, you know, we can all try and think of artworks beforehand, but then you kind of get your hands dirty and you start to juxtapose things, and then you actually start to see things happen that you would never would have imagined. Okay, so there are definitely analogs here. And, yeah, my bias is that I think it's unquestionable that raw AI is art is art. And I may question it quite toughly, or I may rigorously question raw AI and its foundations, because I think that's all for everybody's benefit. So I agree.
00:03:16.772 - 00:03:50.204, Speaker A: My bias is this is definitely quote unquote art. And you always got to like as soon as someone says something isn't art, then all of a sudden it's like, whoa, this is getting exciting and this is going to change everything is what I start to think at the back of my mind. So I like to question and probe these things though. Let's see if this can stand up to questioning. So the conversation continues on this and. Yeah, so interesting. So a comparison to collage is our first comment here.
00:03:50.204 - 00:04:54.344, Speaker A: Very interesting. And I kind of like the way AI can mess up. So back to the AI distortions, which at first, remember when I looked at strange things work, at first I was like, well, but what about this quote unquote mistake here with the hand? And does this stand up and strange thing kind of brought me around to appreciating as well as clown vampire that, you know, what this, and just the tag raw AI, which came from artists most importantly brought me around to this idea that, you know, raw AI and these distortions, it's a feature, not a bug. Okay, so that's another point here and I think Weisman is commenting on that here. I kind of like the way AI can mess up, especially with hands and feet. And we're going to see that in a work today, sometimes in a really cool way. Maybe these glitches will be viewed and even coveted as signatures of early AI artwork later.
00:04:54.344 - 00:05:42.204, Speaker A: I totally agree and I suspect you're right. I suspect you're right because you know what? These distortions are going to get ironed out probably within a couple of years, if not sooner. The way these are exponential technologies as far as I understand. So exactly. That could be seen as a real mark of classicness because probably just like using these old AI tools will be like, we use retro tools like old Amiga deluxe paint or Photoshop 1.0 to kind of make a point and make works a certain way. I'm very, very very sympathetic and I actually, I just agree.
00:05:42.204 - 00:06:00.124, Speaker A: So I guess I'm totally sympathetic. Cool. I find these distortions can also lead in other directions as well as being historical artifacts. Try stable diffusion too. You get a bunch of free credits when you sign up. It's really excellent. And yeah, we mentioned stable diffusion once.
00:06:00.124 - 00:06:27.024, Speaker A: I saw a few artists, AI artists were mentioning stable diffusion. So yeah, so heads up, everybody try stable diffusion. You get a bunch of free credits. Yeah, I'm out of my dal e credits. I tried it out, I was pretty impressed. But again, these things, it's, you know, it's not as easy as it looks, but I think once you crack a code, it gets really easy. And that's kind of my sense.
00:06:27.024 - 00:07:20.908, Speaker A: It's sort of like there's a threshold of a learning curve, but once you kind of hit that threshold of knowing how to create a certain kind of work, then you can just make a billion of them, is sort of my sense of this. I am still learning here, though, so I appreciate the comments. Wastemen as ever, an update on this plotter. And again, I really like plotters. I was thinking to myself, like, why do I like plotters? And it's because the problem with a lot of digital art, if you fixing my shirt here, the problem with a lot of digital art is, let's say you were to draw like eight pixels and paint them. You could spend an entire day painting those eight pixels and there might still be something kind of not perfect about them. And that is the frustration of realistic art.
00:07:20.908 - 00:07:58.852, Speaker A: When you're doing, say, oil painting, you can, you can, the more realistic you try and make it, the higher the, you know, the, the less you can screw up without it looking bad, you know, the more you try and make it look like a photo. Even just the slightest thing that's off all of a sudden kind of wrecks the entire painting. So I call realist art treacherous. And when you're trying to do even just pixels in a. That's not exactly realist art. But if you're trying to get these super straight lines, I've done it. I've spent many weekends of my life.
00:07:58.852 - 00:08:42.624, Speaker A: About ten years ago. I can show you a painting at some point, the speculator. And yeah, it's laborious, it's treacherous. So I'm all over the pen plotter, and just look at this, the long thread, single line plotter drawing. So this is one thing. And you see, like, how would you ever do this by yourself? You want tech for that? So interesting. I thought this was just kind of funny because we've been looking at Eddie Tree's AI impressionist works, and this is a real impressionist work, quote unquote real by Vincent van Gogh, of Doctor Gachet's wife, I assume, or sister Marguerite Gachet at the piano, 1890.
00:08:42.624 - 00:09:13.714, Speaker A: We saw a work by Doctor Gachet maybe ten or 20 episodes ago. And what's funny about this is when I saw this on Twitter, and it first just kind of hit my visual field, my first kind of reptilian reaction was, oh, a new work by Eddie Tree. But in fact, it was van Gogh. So I just thought that was kind of funny. Let's go back to this Joni B work. So, an art of the present. We are back to this idea, unapologetically digital.
00:09:13.714 - 00:09:32.966, Speaker A: You cannot make this work as an analog painting. There is a blinking eye here. And with, you know, a phone and a laptop and basically nothing more. Maybe it's the artist's girlfriend. Maybe it's the artist herself. I don't know if Joanie B. Is a guy or a girl.
00:09:32.966 - 00:09:55.594, Speaker A: Doesn't matter. Man or woman, doesn't matter. But again, and we're almost back to this theme that we saw in Adelia of digital exhaustion. So again, I think this is a really nice work, minted just a few minutes ago here. I'm not sure if it's for sale yet. If it is, I may have to halt the program. I mean, Joanie B.
00:09:55.594 - 00:10:14.168, Speaker A: Yeah, just minted. Sometimes they're not too expensive, these. One of ones that Jony B. Puts out, kind of reminiscent to me of Lucian Freud. Okay. That's what it made me think of as well. See these works here? I think Lucian Freud was like the nephew of Sigmund Freud.
00:10:14.168 - 00:10:34.656, Speaker A: There is a relation there. Famous british painter. And you see all these bed scenes. So also kind of reminiscent of that. These people just kind of lie in there. And then we go back to here. So again, a great work, the fuchsia.
00:10:34.656 - 00:11:05.506, Speaker A: Another interesting creative decision, by the way, and I'm trying to. This episode should be shorter, by the way, the final thing on this one, the creative decision, I really liked on this. That looks easy when it's done, but until it's done, it's not. Was turning the laptop fuchsia and turning the phone cover fuchsia. I assume this is fuchsia. That's what I'd call it. I mean, the obvious thing to do would be to make the silver, you know, the laptop and the phone screen white here.
00:11:05.506 - 00:11:31.916, Speaker A: But it's all fuchsia and kind of like tinted. Very interesting. So you get this really nice, almost monochromatic color, and then you get this yellow kind of contrast here. So I think one of my favorite works by Joni B, a really nice one. Continuing on, so we're back to Kristen Roose, who is also becoming a regular here on the program. Fantastic. Fantavision in pink.
00:11:31.916 - 00:12:07.716, Speaker A: A really cool pixel work here. Now, you might wonder, like, what's the deal a little bit? So let's look at the write up here. Created with FantaVision 1988. So we're back to retro tools for the Commodore amiga. I didn't realize the Commodore 64 and the Amiga fused. This is the first program for personal computers to allow for tweeting and morphine between vector based images. And that was a big thing in the early two thousands with Flash by who was that? Not multimedia, by whatever they were called.
00:12:07.716 - 00:12:32.384, Speaker A: They were taken over by Adobe. But yeah, tweening. So you see just a very simple tweening work. So another kind of what I'd call learned work by Kristen Roos that kind of alludes to digital history. So I think Wolf. Remember wolf laser at the digital art museum dam in Berlin? I think this is really up his alley. This is his cup of tea.
00:12:32.384 - 00:13:07.698, Speaker A: So again, I think you can still buy this for ten, by the way, if you're kind of into that retro tools, digital art, pixel kind of thing, it's actually quite a beautiful work. It matches. You could put this in the same room as our first image here. That's kind of funny. So anyways, interesting work. This is another one by Kanek Zapata that we missed from the hen reunion, the hen reunion tour. I just thought it was kind of an interesting work and it seems to use, what is it called? Computer icon, save icon.
00:13:07.698 - 00:13:30.132, Speaker A: So just some, you know, I almost want to attempt it to call it like Windows 95 retro iconography, blown up a bit, turned into a pixel work. Just kind of interesting. Three left for two days each. I like even that bottom thing there. Just kind of interesting new work by geek and myth. There is music. So a cool pixel work.
00:13:30.132 - 00:14:16.024, Speaker A: Again, you see the myth clouds here. Let's see if we can play the music. There we go. And you got geek on the left, smokin and myth on the right with the tier coming in and out, cool music, myth, colors coming out of the coffee cup or whatever it is, champagne, whatever else here, myth cards, vanguard cards. There's a lot going on in this seemingly simple looking work, so I believe you can still get it a cool, just collab again. Another great thing about digital art is how easy it is to collaborate. Imagine you're painters and you're painting over each other's work, so it's just so much easier to do this.
00:14:16.024 - 00:14:45.138, Speaker A: Almost another feature of digital art is this collaboration element. Very interesting. So by geek, still available for six tazos. Pretty reasonable. And what else? This is a newer artist, CH XXXXL, and they just kind of had an interesting kind of another kind of one of these music NFTs, which is almost a category unto itself. Again, unapologetically digital. You cannot do this with analog painting.
00:14:45.138 - 00:15:12.434, Speaker A: Let's see if this plays. There we go. The Tezos rebels locker. So go hang out with the Tezos crowd. You got your Gucci shirt, you got your contemporary clothing, balaclava, synthwave wave colors, cool tunes. You are good to go. Entrance to the wildest dream.
00:15:12.434 - 00:15:32.806, Speaker A: So capitalized by Ch XL. And this is their first mint Ch Xl. So just. Okay, interesting. Did I give them a follow here? Yeah. So I like to just, you know, see what's going on. Kind of along the same lines here by wasteman Goldman.
00:15:32.806 - 00:15:49.942, Speaker A: So I stuck this in Teslife. Again, this looks like. I'd say this is deceptively simple. This looks like a work that was put together pretty quickly. And it probably was, but I still like what it represents. Again, this looks like some sort of palazzo. Hilariously, tezos place of work.
00:15:49.942 - 00:16:07.802, Speaker A: And someone with a big cigar. Again, nice use of negative space here, actually. Like, the black and the white balances quite nicely. Sending a Tezos coin into the Tezos place of work. I don't mind this work at all. 25 tezo cents. The struggle is real.
00:16:07.802 - 00:16:25.454, Speaker A: Tez life. Speaking of tazo life, I recognize this shirt. It's one of my favorite shirts. This is new work by Kappa. He is back on the tattoo. Kind of the gangsta train here. I love this one of one series.
00:16:25.454 - 00:16:51.434, Speaker A: And it's funny, like, I have a bolivian friend and actually a couple that I know. We're visiting their house. They have some kids who are teenagers, and they're starting to get these tattoos. It's like a classic latin american thing, almost like a latin american gang thing. They're just normal kids, but they're into kind of being edgy. And so I showed them Kappa's work, and they loved it. I showed them some of these Kappa pieces.
00:16:51.434 - 00:17:33.534, Speaker A: So, yeah, so just playing around here, this is a great thing, too. Like, I mean, look at how much you play around with eight badoo. You do your other series. You do this series, you know, so I really like the flexibility that we have in here in digital art. Murlakos fallen Pepe. So it looks like a reference to Icarus and mythology. So, you know, Morlaco's play on Icarus again with his clouds from the sky and Icarus, of course, the pepe is falling, and the myth of Icarus is out of Ovid's metamorphosis, where, I mean, it's an older myth than that.
00:17:33.534 - 00:17:59.752, Speaker A: It's an ancient greek myth. But Ovid is probably the most famous teller of the Icarus myth. And who is Icarus's dad. Isn't it the guy? It is the wizard guy. What is his name? The guy who builds. Let's just quickly look, because you know what? It's important that we keep our literary references here. We need myth of Icarus.
00:17:59.752 - 00:18:16.858, Speaker A: We can't be Daedalus. Daedalus is the dad. Yeah. So let's look at Icarus. You guys should know this. I'm sure you've seen it. So a classic in the history of art, you know, and so here, this is one of the most famous.
00:18:16.858 - 00:18:36.614, Speaker A: This is Van Dyck, I believe this is in Toronto. I remember seeing that one of their prized. So here's Daedalus talking to Icarus. So we'll go back here. So in the form of Pepe. The pepe is falling. So very, very cool work by Los Marlacos.
00:18:36.614 - 00:19:02.420, Speaker A: Good morning from rak cloak. See? So I suspect this is going to be released at some point soon. Here. We have been seeing this work being previewed a few times. It looks like, frankly, 1234. It almost looks like five paintings in one. This thing, this on its own, could be a painting.
00:19:02.420 - 00:19:31.048, Speaker A: It almost looks like six with the muddy waters. Interestingly, with the open sea. I don't know what's going on with Opensea's logo, by the way, if you guys have seen that. But, you know, here's creme de creme. So, I mean, putting it all into one work with Ratcloaksea. So a self portrait, you know, a portrait of inner space, as we like to call them here, a portrait of inner space. Oh, yeah.
00:19:31.048 - 00:19:50.144, Speaker A: Open sea. Like, oh, did they change it? They got rid of their new logo. Yeah, they had this horrible logo. They changed it back. Yeah, they. The S was like this big lightning strike. And I thought, like, is this for Halloween or something? It was the worst logo.
00:19:50.144 - 00:20:18.660, Speaker A: Shall we see? Very, very quickly, if we can see that for those that don't know what we're talking about. Yeah, that was it. Which one is your favorite? Like, just. I don't like to be too judgmental on this show. Everybody's trying their best, but that was like something, you know, that comes out of design class 101. The first person who's, you know, the first assignment. Okay, you're learning design.
00:20:18.660 - 00:20:29.554, Speaker A: Anyways, nothing against that person. And it looks like they changed it back. Wow. Good move. Just backpedal. If it goes really bad, just backpedal. Another digital painting.
00:20:29.554 - 00:21:04.770, Speaker A: This is by Xander Price. Remember him? He is the guy who did the Zuckerberg. So I'm starting to think Xander Price is the dude here. And so, you know, this is one of the features of this kind of blockchain art, is creating these kind of characters. Like this myth character, Ratclok. See, I find it very interesting because this is almost like comic book like creativity, where you're creating characters and then you're. I find it really interesting.
00:21:04.770 - 00:21:43.314, Speaker A: And I never would have done anything like that. And I still like. I mean, there is precedent, if we go in the history of art with Max Ernst's Loplop figure. I mean, it's funny how we always end up coming back to Max Ernst, but he had a bird figure. It's the name Loplop, or more formally, Loplop. Father Superior of the birds is the name of a bird like character that was an alter ego of the data surrealist artist Max Ernst. Ernst had an ongoing fascination with birds, which often appear in his work.
00:21:43.314 - 00:22:03.246, Speaker A: Laplop functioned as a similar animal. So let's see if we can see some. Yeah, so, you know, here you'll see the bird. This is kind of like a lop lop like figure here. Again with Ernst, it's a little bit more. I don't really. Is that this is.
00:22:03.246 - 00:22:36.028, Speaker A: I'm not sure if I consider that lop lop, but maybe, you know, but it was kind of like a reoccurring character. I mean, it's much more loose in Ernst, but, yeah, Laplop was something he would refer to. Laplop, superior of the birds. Surrealist Persona, Max Ernst. So you see, there is precedent for this. Very interesting. So then you start to wonder these characters, like, there can be a comparison being made here.
00:22:36.028 - 00:23:17.314, Speaker A: And is this just kind of a deep psychological thing that people are just intuitively doing as Max Ernst did? You know, is there an unconscious, you know, desire to portray some kind of character? Is this kind of something out of the unconscious, is where I'm going with this. Interesting questions. We'll just open up another topic there. Drink with doom. God. So it looks like Xander Price figure his character with this doom guy. I don't exactly understand if this is supposed to be Doctor Doom or there is a character in the tezos ecosystem that has this look.
00:23:17.314 - 00:23:47.744, Speaker A: So I'm still kind of figuring all that out. One of my favorite things about this work here was actually how the champagne glasses, as well as the champagne bottles seem to look exactly like the emojis. They look exactly like the champagne bottle emojis, and I really like that. And there's just all sorts of weird little details, like Kermit the frog with the supreme shirt. This looks like a. I think you'd call it a mandible. The bottom of the jaw.
00:23:47.744 - 00:24:07.500, Speaker A: Like a tazos paperweight, you know? And who is this ka. Is this what you call that artist? I can't remember the name. Interesting reference. Again, contemporary clothing. Kind of a fun. So it does like, when you look at the eyes, it really does have a moodiness to it. I missed the mint.
00:24:07.500 - 00:24:35.824, Speaker A: So this went for eleven tazos. Pretty reasonable for a nice painting. Edition of 15. El Greco is working on a piece, 70% there for this one of. One more interesting digital painting. And we're seeing a strange thing working with heads of dogs in the AI works with those Nike AI figures. Interesting.
00:24:35.824 - 00:25:08.884, Speaker A: And this was interesting too. So the Tezos vending machine is still going, and Evelyn O is doing work there. She's the featured artist. Surreal dreamscapes combine AI with post editing and digital painting. So I was bringing this up last episode, this combination of digital painting and AI, which I think has a ton of potential. So that looks like a pretty nice work there, too. So just very, very interesting.
00:25:08.884 - 00:25:33.822, Speaker A: So this was interesting, this work by freakin hell. Please accept the terms and agreements. This looks like a Bellini Christ like figure here. So. And again, you see, like this kinda, I don't know, what do you call that, this cloth that Christ would be wearing? But then you have these kind of nightmarish figures on top here. They kind of reminded me. I'll show you.
00:25:33.822 - 00:25:52.154, Speaker A: I brought it up here. We're talking about Francesco Clemente. And just like these kind of. I mean, it's a very loose reference for me. And I don't think keeping freakin hell was trying to make it, but that's what I think of. And then I saw this, and I was like, oh, that's just like. And here's a nice big version.
00:25:52.154 - 00:26:16.974, Speaker A: And I thought to myself, that's very similar to this Dali work here called war. Kind of another nightmarish work by Dali. So just kind of interesting comparisons here. Just like references I'm making in my own mind. Terms and agreements as a tattoo. So an interesting AI work from freaking hell. And getting very close.
00:26:16.974 - 00:26:40.664, Speaker A: Wiesman, gold, Minovitch. I was talking about the distortions you see in the fingers here. 12345. And then there's a thumb. Very interesting distortion there. And again, back to this almost flemish looking oil painting. Very smooth kind of rendition here by wastemen.
00:26:40.664 - 00:26:45.724, Speaker A: And that's it. So, thank you for joining me on this, on today's episode. Until next time, take care.
