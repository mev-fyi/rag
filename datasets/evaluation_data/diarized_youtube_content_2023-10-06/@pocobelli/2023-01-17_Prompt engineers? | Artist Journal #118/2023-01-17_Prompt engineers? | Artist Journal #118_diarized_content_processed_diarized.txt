00:00:04.760 - 00:00:40.074, Speaker A: It continues. Everyone, welcome back to our one of a kind show here, broadcasting to the world from Berlin, Germany, via the Internet. Artist journal, January 17, 2023. My name is Adrian Pokebelli. I welcome you back to this mission. I am on a mission of what nature I know not. And so I appreciate you joining me here, because who knows where this ends up? Perhaps just a oddity on YouTube or perhaps something more.
00:00:40.074 - 00:00:57.594, Speaker A: So I appreciate you coming along for the adventure. So let's get into it. Time is of the essence. Deadlines, deadlines, people. Joanne with a new work, her genesis piece on super rare. So congratulations to her. It's doing well.
00:00:57.594 - 00:01:21.846, Speaker A: It's already at an ETH with clown vamp, and I found it interesting. I mean, it's slightly different. I brought up an older work. So this one's called, you return like autumn, and I fall every time. Now, if you look at her older work here, and again, she calls herself Joanne Miro. It's like Juan Miro, but with AI in it. Perhaps a clue, dear viewer.
00:01:21.846 - 00:02:02.144, Speaker A: And anyways, this really beautiful work here, it's interesting how she changed the palette, and I think it's a she, how she changed the palette from black here and this kind of like pink to more of a blue and a softer pink. So anyways, interesting change. There's also seems to be a slight change in the volume. This seems to me, despite the perspective here, it has a bit of a flatter feel to it, particularly because of the figures. I think only the legs kind of have volume, whereas here it seems like there's a little bit more space in the picture, doesn't it? So, interesting work. Great. Congratulations.
00:02:02.144 - 00:03:03.848, Speaker A: It seems to be doing really well so far. I was thinking to myself, just on the market perspective, I wonder if it would have been easier for her to have set up an auction, because, like, having been there and anybody that just takes offers on super rare, it's a real agonizing thing, because when you're on super rare and you get an offer, it can be taken away at any point. And I don't think clownvamp would do that. But if you leave it up for a week waiting for other offers, sometimes this person, the person on the top, will cancel it after a few hours, and then it's not like it defaults to the second offer. Then you're just done and you have to wait for another offer, which may or may not come. So I love this idea of auctions on super rare because it kind of takes that whole, how much do you sell for stress out of the picture? It's just whatever the market decides. Because, you know, I've.
00:03:03.848 - 00:03:28.236, Speaker A: I think I sold a work for was it .8 or an ETH? And I was just so happy. You know, this is like over a year ago on super rare, and I was just so happy, I just jumped on it. But maybe I should have waited, you know, and you wonder and wonder, right? So that was like the early work. It was a screenshot of the crypto stuff. I can't remember. It was a bitcoin chart that I kind of redid.
00:03:28.236 - 00:04:14.002, Speaker A: So, anyways, we can look at that another time, as again, time is of the essence here. So anyways, congrats to Joanne. We'll see how that goes. Right now, shout out to Luke 500 who shared. Remember I was talking about MoMA. For those that watched last show, I was talking about how, you know, is MoMA going to start to feel some angst here with works like we just saw here, and other works like by Hasdrubal Waffle, who we're also going to talk a little bit about here shortly. Are they going to start feeling some angst about, you know, missing out? And like, as we see more and more sophistication here on the blockchain, arguably, are they going to start to get more concerned now? So Luke 500 and I mentioned there was a video that I wish I had watched.
00:04:14.002 - 00:04:56.184, Speaker A: So anyways, Luke 500 is the person who sent it to me originally, and he actually resent it awesomely. So I actually listened to it and he also sent me this spherule file. This is basically the institutional NFT platform of sorts. And so you see Buffalo Art Museum here, this is just their homepage, which I think takes you to exhibitions. Boomtown. So there is some stuff, as you can see, there is some art here, works with curators, artists and institutions to explore new ways of exhibiting and collecting digital art. It is a gated platform for the most part, so you can check that out.
00:04:56.184 - 00:05:32.048, Speaker A: My mic is acting up a little bit, so I am not going to start going too deep into these websites because it might kill it. But I did want to bring this up. How to join Fearle file I'm an artist. Can I sell my work on feral file? Probably a lot of you might want to know, especially if there's institutions, maybe it's an opportunity, right? Feral file artists are selected for each exhibition by that show's curator. So gated. We don't currently have a way for artists to upload work directly to feral files or to be considered for selection by curators. However, if you're an artist interested in joining our community, we welcome you to join the Feral file discord.
00:05:32.048 - 00:06:13.924, Speaker A: So it sounds pretty gated. I thought if it was artists interested in uploading your work, well, you can join the discord, but it's actually, it's just to join the community. So it's an interesting thing because we were discussing many, many episodes ago, the strange advantage, or maybe the commonsensical advantage of having an open platform like object. Right. Or, you know, teia hen, whatever you want to call it, because there are so many artists that showed up on there that maybe didn't want to go through any kind of application process. A lot of artists by nature are sort of like, you know, screw it. I don't need anybody's approval.
00:06:13.924 - 00:06:47.400, Speaker A: That's why I became an artist. And now I'm not going out here to try and get the approval of someone else. So that is like part of the advantage of these open platforms is you actually get much more talent coming in the door that otherwise might, would not show up. You know, and super rare wisely, I think, onboarded a whole bunch of Tezos artists in the last few months, and I think that was really smart. Now they're doing it with AI artists as well. So. Yeah, so, you know, I'd never even heard of this, considering how neck deep I am in all this.
00:06:47.400 - 00:07:13.974, Speaker A: You know, I put out a pretty. Practically a daily show here and I'd never even heard of this. Okay, but shout out to Luke 500 for sending the word. So just a heads up because just kind of interesting here. And also, so, of course, they're on Ethereum and Tezos, what they sell, and you can buy there. And there is a wallet, actually, and they use their own wallet here, autonomy. But you can also sign in, I think, with metamask.
00:07:13.974 - 00:07:45.770, Speaker A: And if you go on Opensea, you can do a search for Fiorl file and you'll find all sorts of different works. So I think this is some, like generative art and stuff and pretty nice, you know, floor here. If you look at the activity. Let's just quickly look at the activity. You can get some cheap works from institutional, quote unquote institutional hands or however you want to put that. So just kind of an interesting. Again, and not terrible sales here, one ETH.
00:07:45.770 - 00:08:28.242, Speaker A: I mean, four days ago, and then no sales for 26 days, but then that sold for 13 ETH. Shall we quickly look at what sold for 13 ETH? Norkal guy is the artist. Oh, look, Dimitri Cherniak. There you go. So interestingly, you know, like, I mean, maybe there's a way to get some cheap Dmitri Cherniacs like this paper hand capital probably minted this for it was an airdrop. So I don't know what the mechanics are, but just kind of interesting what's going on there. So continuing on tomorrow, this is fun.
00:08:28.242 - 00:08:47.422, Speaker A: Runetune was suggesting maybe we get a guest once in a while. And I thought that was a great idea. So rare for swan, rare. The great Boston dynamics dog painter and really interesting digital painter is going to join us. So it's going to be a lot of fun. There's going to be three of us there. We're going to ask.
00:08:47.422 - 00:09:31.202, Speaker A: And I think it's sort of an opportunity to go a little bit deeper with artists because I bring people on and I want to continue to do these kind of open lines shows because I think it's great for just maybe someone only has five or ten minutes and they don't want to spend an hour and maybe they're unknown and that's their opportunity. So I like this kind of open platform, but it's also, when you bring someone on, it's a chance to kind of have a bit of a deeper conversation about the work and what's going on and what they're thinking about. So that also has its own advantages. So I think it's just a nice, you know, a continued iteration of this spaces project. So anyways, that is happening tomorrow. We also just posted this and got a couple of already getting a response, which is totally awesome. So thanks, guys.
00:09:31.202 - 00:10:29.962, Speaker A: So tune in tomorrow. It's Wednesday at 09:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time. A couple of comments I wanted to that I didn't that I missed last time, but just on AI and this whole idea that it's quote unquote open season just on influence and for lack of better term, copying or being heavily influenced, let's call it this way, by other people's work in the AI scene. Remember, Charles, AI was taking issue with saying, okay, there's another artist out there that's really borrowing from me and having a lot of success. And again, this argument we've been looking at, which is like, well, can we be mad at the art station people for saying they're being sampled and then be an AI artist and then say, hey, I'm being sampled, when it's kind of sampler culture, but it's, you know, it's not a black or white issue, it's a, it's a gray issue. Now, Mars Eve NFT art weighed in with some very interesting comments.
00:10:29.962 - 00:11:07.794, Speaker A: Open season in the past, style was sacred, but now style can be replicated, no matter how complicated, through AI, dream booth, or image to image image prompting. So what are the new metrics? Maybe storytelling iconography or a move to a non 2d media which is hard to replicate. Animation, 3d VR video. I also like the popularity of vintage graphics creation. AI is not yet optimized to replicate pixel art or vector art. Great point. And I think this is the profound point, which is probably why Mars Eve NFT started with this.
00:11:07.794 - 00:11:50.996, Speaker A: It may show a real shift, potentially, of this idea of style. Like I've always like in my own work, I have several styles. I have like four or five, maybe more different series which are totally unrelated stylistically. Although some people say, actually, I can tell they all kind of look like your work in some respects. But this is kind of a really interesting issue. And we're discussing Richard Prince as well, saying, and there's a video on YouTube, Vice put it out, really interesting video where he's saying the art world wants to put artists in a box, that this is your style, this is what you do. Kind of a one liner.
00:11:50.996 - 00:12:28.776, Speaker A: And it's good marketing. If you have one series, everybody knows, okay, you're the guy that does XYZ, but someone like Richard Prince, he fights that. He's like, I'll work on one thing in the morning, then in the afternoon I'll work on a different series. And I work the same way, and I like it that way because some artists, I mean, you hear of artists here in Berlin, they get trapped in their style, and the gallery doesn't want to see a different style. They want what's selling, right. So it can become a trap. So I kind of prefer early on that I just have my different series, and that's already going.
00:12:28.776 - 00:13:02.908, Speaker A: So should a gallery come by, it's sort of like, well, I already have my five, you know, works, you know, that or five series that are in the pipeline. So anyways, so that's kind of my angle on style. So I think this is really interesting, though, you know, because this is a real sacred cow. You could argue in art. And I kind of love this idea of demoting style as this sacred cow. Right? Let's just see. And he had another, or Mars had another comment.
00:13:02.908 - 00:13:22.540, Speaker A: I like the idea of prompts as titles and fake prompts as titles. Me too. Right? So some really sophisticated ideas here. Fake prompts as titles. People will try the prompt and fail. Lol. So, yeah, so that is also because we were talking about how with AI works.
00:13:22.540 - 00:14:28.306, Speaker A: In my kind of heart of hearts, I would love the prompt to be the title, and then it would be like even more fascinating, and then it would be like no holds barred as far as copying, because then I could just take that prompt and run away with it. So is this kind of like the logical conclusion of this kind of hardcore sampler culture in AI? Is does the prompt or fake prompts become the title? Now, just one last thing, prompt engineers. I was listening to a podcast on AI art, and it was by an old kind of AI engineer who became an artist. And he was saying this notion of the prompt engineer and how people are talking about, you know, crafting your words perfectly and getting, you know, all the parameters right and everything. So I thought that was a fascinating idea. So anyways, really interesting thoughts from Mars Eve NFT quick correction from rustic. Little disclaimer, it's a self portrait, not our friend Mark Zuckerberg.
00:14:28.306 - 00:14:46.944, Speaker A: Lol. Just me and my crop buddy. Thanks for the space, Adrian. So he's rustic is talking about this. So I thought this was Mark Zuckerberg yesterday, but it's actually a portrait of the artist, rustic digital art hanging out with the cropped Mario. So thanks for chiming in and the correction there. Rustic digital art.
00:14:46.944 - 00:15:34.924, Speaker A: Now, this whole hasdrubal waffles situation, I think, is getting kind of mysterious here. So we were featuring this waffles draw tool that was made by now, strangely enough, it was made by Santiago. Now, why is Santiago making the waffles draw? Maybe they know each other or something. And so first, let's take a look at this, please, Adrian. Next episode, invite anyone who wants to pick the code and enhance it. I made it on chat GTP, and it went quite well. So this whole website we were looking at yesterday was actually coded by chat GPT, the new AI software online that you've all heard about.
00:15:34.924 - 00:16:13.062, Speaker A: So how crazy is that? So not only are we dealing with these visual AI tools, but even the chat GPT, you can get it to code art tools, which is pretty exciting. So Santiago made this has drubble waffles site, waffle draws. And he's basically saying, you know, anybody that wants to add to the code, let me know. Message Santiago. So there's a little bit of mystery here with who has dribble waffles. Oli Isikowski. Some say he is a secret artist.
00:16:13.062 - 00:16:42.436, Speaker A: Some say waffles is not real. All I know is waffles is here to stay still. Life of the great waffles. I mean, it's a pretty strange name. And you wonder, is this just like a secret, uh, identity of someone like Santiago or someone else? I don't know. I don't know. So, I mean, but this definitely perked up my ears or my eyes.
00:16:42.436 - 00:17:17.254, Speaker A: And it made me question is, especially. And the first intimations that something might be weird was that Santiago programmed the waffle draws. Why would that be? So there does seem to be a bit of a mystery around this incredible artist. This incredible artist. Okay, so interesting. And there's more secrecy. Retired artists formerly known as NZFs, we even have secret NFTs minted secretly and hidden at plain sight with waffles draw and the secret gnu image minip tool.
00:17:17.254 - 00:17:54.888, Speaker A: So, you know, maybe I'm not in on the joke here. It almost doesn't matter to a certain degree. I see the work and the work is astonishing. And I tell you, if that's someone's, like, joke account and that's the work they're making, isn't that interesting? Let me close that. Continuing on and here and Santiago making explanation. I guess at some point we should do a more explanatory tweet and more clear date. And they're just talking more about the software here.
00:17:54.888 - 00:18:19.196, Speaker A: So there is a mystery here, my friends. There is a mystery. Time to waffles draw by Santiago, continuing on. So take the takeaway here. There seems to be a mystery around this identity. Hasdrubal waffle, aka authentic waffles. And then you go to the NFTs, and it's drawn by Tala.
00:18:19.196 - 00:18:38.520, Speaker A: All sorts of strangeness there. So any clarification is appreciated over here. This was a great comment from yesterday's video. Stoked that you mentioned that you referenced research, research publications here. And that was little cakes and son of stagways. And me too. I was a body piercer for years.
00:18:38.520 - 00:19:08.364, Speaker A: This is my treasure. So how cool is that? I told you, research is famous within the kind of counterculture it is, like an institution. And Vail, if you're ever in San Francisco, you can go to researchpubs.com, email vail. And he's pretty responsive. And, you know, he was an outsider like the rest of us, so he's just happy when people know what he was doing, you know, and he'll, you know, he's pretty social. So anyways, I've met Vale.
00:19:08.364 - 00:19:29.984, Speaker A: I actually helped him on his new logo. I actually. Yeah, his new logo. Yeah, we made, like, that was like 15 years ago, maybe like 2000, 715 years ago, when I visited San Francisco to visit Vail, because I had written my master's thesis on JG Ballard's atrocity exhibition and. Yeah, so we just. I hung out with Vale for a week. It was great.
00:19:29.984 - 00:19:46.012, Speaker A: Very cool. I met Jello Biafra. I was there at his 50th birthday party, all six of us. So that was pretty. I was pretty wide eyed at that situation. So that was pretty awesome. Continuing on, acidboy, just on some market dynamics here.
00:19:46.012 - 00:20:11.254, Speaker A: I want to make things easier for my collectors and friends in the community. I've decided to build an allow list for my upcoming mints. This idea came from my friend Oxdgb link below. So if you want to get on the acid boy allow list, you can go here. So interesting. Trying to reward, I guess, the loyal collectors. You know, as this scene grows, we could see more of this kind of thing.
00:20:11.254 - 00:20:31.570, Speaker A: You know, I could just see more of that. And so this isn't released yet. So there are none sold. Come back today at five. So acidboy is putting out another open edition. Actually it's not an open edition. It's an edition of 50 on manifold at 0.2.
00:20:31.570 - 00:21:07.454, Speaker A: And we'll see if we can get some volume on this. Pretty cool, actually trying to get rid of that white line. There we go. So yeah, each one seems more epic than the last. So Acidboy goes live this afternoon and continuing on. So interesting market dynamics. And also on this kind of heated scene that I'm seeing here.
00:21:07.454 - 00:21:20.374, Speaker A: Tombatl sold out. Thank you very much. I received 55 offers on this nft here. Wow. That was my first experience with offers. And there was also a problem with communication. Sorry, with who I missed.
00:21:20.374 - 00:21:37.962, Speaker A: Sorry, who I missed so far. I will do the following drops without offers. Thank you all. So this one here, and I think I brought it up here, he did very well. So don't forget. I think it was just yesterday's episode. He sold that one of one for 325 tezos.
00:21:37.962 - 00:22:07.668, Speaker A: Now I think it was this work here, right? Yes, this work here. If we take a look at the history here, except offers 1616 all the way down to ten. That was the minimum here. So on 25. So probably like another $350. And you know, Tom Poombattle is very prolific. He's releasing a piece or two a day and they're being snapped up.
00:22:07.668 - 00:22:30.944, Speaker A: So that's a pretty healthy income. Actually. This is more than regular jobs. So the promises out there to live from your art via the scene at least, you know, temporarily. I mean these things heat up and cool down. That's the nature of being an artist, you know, boom and bust. So things are booming right now for Tom Bombadil and another work here.
00:22:30.944 - 00:23:00.466, Speaker A: And this soldier for 1213. I'm not sure if these were offers. This sold on primary for 750. But you see how quickly look at this. So, listed at 821 Berlin time, sold out basically by two minutes later. Two minutes later, sold out by 823. So once things get going here, and again, we're kind of in a bear market.
00:23:00.466 - 00:23:40.974, Speaker A: What happens if the whole world gets interested in digital art again? And even more so, like, and it's affordable. They're not paying $100 fees on ethereum, all this sort of thing. This could get wild. Robnis V two. I mean, said, you know, NFT artists are going to be the new rock stars. When you start seeing, like, these are kind of like signs of that, you know, like, we're seeing kind of small signs. I wanted to do a quick look at RAda's work, because Rada, as I described in earlier episodes, is a lot of the reason why many of us ended up on Tezos, including myself and Joe Rogan's dad, because I saw works like this.
00:23:40.974 - 00:24:13.302, Speaker A: He had this great kind of ad of sorts where he had this work with, like, classical music behind it. And it was stunning, and I think it would kind of zoom in. It was a stunning ad, and I was just, like, in love with the work. And so it was one of the first works I bought on Tezos was the guy I think was Cosimo de Medici riding the horse. So I thought we could just look, this is owned by Cosimo de Medici. I don't know if there's any. I think there's only one.
00:24:13.302 - 00:24:24.714, Speaker A: So. Yeah. And sold for almost for free. So pretty nice work here. Yeah, also sold to Cozumel de Medici. So, anyways, just some really nice work. So I just.
00:24:24.714 - 00:24:49.984, Speaker A: Because maybe people don't know rata and the pixel artwork and what we're talking about here. So St. George and the dragon. But this is Cosimo de Medici, you know, patron in the crypto art scene, golden glory. So this is like a pirate ship. And Ratta uses a lot of rats and, like, pirates, kind of combines the two sometimes, as we see right here. Really nice kind of pixel art.
00:24:49.984 - 00:25:07.864, Speaker A: Tis victory or death. This is another one extraction of quintessence. Kind of has a bit of a medieval feel to it, doesn't it? And a couple more here. Alchemy lessons. And this is super cool. I love the signs in the air here. Almost like a medieval painting.
00:25:07.864 - 00:25:42.996, Speaker A: Very cool. And finally, Monty and jewels almost looks like his dog, but with a a bit of a pastoral renaissance kind of feel to it. And finally, what is this called? It looks like a still life with some rats in it. And so anyways, nature mort. So a still life. And by Rada Yonke. So anyways, I just wanted to fill you in for those that don't know Radda's work, that is kind of like what brought a lot of people over, which got me excited about art on the blockchain, frankly.
00:25:42.996 - 00:26:04.652, Speaker A: Interestingly. So, that pixel art, right? It has a very populist feel. We see it with Tom Bombadil, right? I mean, look at that. Once you kind of get that pixel art vibe. People love that stuff. I love that stuff, you know? So anyways, it's just beautiful, too. Rustic digital art.
00:26:04.652 - 00:26:23.842, Speaker A: White Ferrari edition of twelve. This again, another artist selling out. Like, look at this. Four tezos and sold out within basically 15. Is it 25 minutes? Sold out. And how many? Edition of twelve. So there you go.
00:26:23.842 - 00:27:00.494, Speaker A: Four times, you know, 48 tezos in 15 minutes for this new work here as part of the cloud period. So again, playing with the crop Mario and doing all these outrageous things here, like now, putting it in a cube and then painting over it again. Like I keep saying, it's very difficult to be this irrational. So very interesting title, white Ferrari. So more interesting work from rustic digital art. Continuing, dan control wall of lighters strongly protects. So kind of pairing with his vapo cigarettes.
00:27:00.494 - 00:27:19.254, Speaker A: I think it's a vapo cigarette. He has some lighters here. So I guess you couldn't use this lighter with the vapo cigarette. But anyways, continuing with the theme and of kind of taking one of the images and repeating. It looks great to me. I like the background, too. Just a solid light color.
00:27:19.254 - 00:27:31.162, Speaker A: Buy for four, still available. This is another work by Dan Control that we had missed. That I had missed. I ironed seven shirts and I never saw this one ready to use. I sweated them. I have now ironed them. Now I can sweat it.
00:27:31.162 - 00:27:49.626, Speaker A: So just kind of interesting. The businessman or the business person and their iron and their shirt. So again, kind of a pop vibe, a pop art vibe to the whole thing. The landscape is pretty interesting. And the cloud as well. Look at the clouds. These just big gradient clouds.
00:27:49.626 - 00:28:16.346, Speaker A: Anyways, very interesting. Human kernel with another anti PFP. It isn't possible to find me, but I'm here secretly. Would this go for? Very nice work, by the way, for 31. And again, kind of like. I don't know what the tool is, but what I'm calling the liquify tool making these really nice textures here, and then they contrast them with this kind of digital output over here. A very simple thing.
00:28:16.346 - 00:28:41.878, Speaker A: And again, the profile picture as template for experimentation. So another interesting work here by human kernel, and, of course, Lorna Mills on demand. I quite liked this work in particular. I like the simplicity of it. It takes her classic style of putting the pixelation around and just the gray. I like the gray. She uses a lot of bright colors sometimes, and just a very simple hand gesture.
00:28:41.878 - 00:29:02.006, Speaker A: Interesting crop here. So, anyways, on demand buy for 15 edition of 30. Very cool. Sabato with a new work. And this is called sighting, which is interesting. I think he put out a tweet saying it's like the perspective from below. Point of view.
00:29:02.006 - 00:29:41.998, Speaker A: See point of view. You are beach bb, waking up underneath the canopy of a golden palm tree. You open your eyes, gazing towards the heavens, so you are asleep, and then basically, it looks like you're seeing a UFO is landing, and the clouds are here. So a pretty original idea and composition. Daring experimentation over here with this palm tree, isn't it? Very daring sighting. So I guess the sighting is the UFO, and the UFO is beautifully rendered here. Sobato's drawing exercises are just looking like, you know, very nice digital paintings, pixel art paintings.
00:29:41.998 - 00:30:09.162, Speaker A: Continuing on, sky Goodman, who also. And they know each other a little bit. They're almost. I don't know if they're out of the same scene. But anyways, kind of glitch artist sky Goodman with some interesting kind of, again, experimental work. Phantom number one. So, again, playing with this pixel art that is kind of blurred out or just kind of not doing what it's supposed to do, what's traditionally done.
00:30:09.162 - 00:30:30.780, Speaker A: So, again, almost an alien or a phantom of sorts, hard to say, but sort of where representational meets abstract in a pixel. And also using AI. I never noticed that. Interesting. So, phantom number one by Sky Goodman. Edmarola was some work. And again, kind of like this.
00:30:30.780 - 00:30:49.940, Speaker A: Lo fi pixels here with a kind of. This almost looks like Greece or something, or maybe Mexico. And again, look at these plants here. Half blurred out pixel work in another language. Maybe that's Spanish or Portuguese. I'm not sure. Cassebre.
00:30:49.940 - 00:31:16.174, Speaker A: So maybe that's Mexico. And let's just see what happened here. Edition of two. One sold for 50 to Dernadler, a big collector here, and Edmarola is holding on to one. So, interesting. Continuing on, demon rider, another one. So, Ed Marolla is very prolific here, and really riding this kind of lo fi pixels here, for lack of better term.
00:31:16.174 - 00:31:40.234, Speaker A: Okay. But where they all kind of. There's just a bit of a blurry feeling, even though if you look up close, I mean, there's a bit of anti aliasing is basically what seems to be going on here. So playing with the aliasing a little bit, seemingly. And what was this called again? Demon rider. So strange, strange work, interesting colors. And the demon seems to be on fire.
00:31:40.234 - 00:32:12.810, Speaker A: So very interesting. Let's just quickly, quickly look at the market on that and see what happened here. Sold for four, nice low price here at midnight, 1221 Berlin time. Sold out in twelve minutes. And that was a edition of 33. So again, like, I mean, if you're making basically $125 a day us in salary, I mean, that starts to become a salary of sorts or in income. Now, the key in art, though, is it never.
00:32:12.810 - 00:32:44.640, Speaker A: Well, sometimes it does last and sometimes it becomes more so. But you have to be careful with that. But anyways, it's, to me, that's a real kind of significant level. When you can start to bring in $125 a day consistently, then things start to get pretty interesting from a financial viewpoint. The whole dream, as Rune Thun says, of living off your art plants. Now, we saw at maybe the hen reunion, I think we saw plants. And so plants does plants.
00:32:44.640 - 00:33:12.208, Speaker A: And here are some pixel art plants. Very experimental, very unusual. And this frame here, that kind of has a spiderweb sort of feel and a tezos logo in the middle. Ordinary thousand leaf, fjord, woundwort ghost, buy for three, still six left. And here's another one, also by plants. Eudriggery sugarplum, buy for zero. So this is basically free.
00:33:12.208 - 00:33:33.534, Speaker A: 55 are left. Well, I might have to pick one of those up. I like the price. And interesting kind of tiny pixels here. Interesting move here as well, with this cross in the background, which kind of grounds the whole composition. Interesting contrast between the black and white pixels here and the that are static. And the moving, colorful pixels too.
00:33:33.534 - 00:34:08.426, Speaker A: And continuing on a work by gift studies fellow molecule. Can you imagine we are made of such crystals? So basically just a molecule, a very small pixel art molecule. Pixel artwork of a molecule going around in circles. So just kind of interesting, isn't it? I often. I often like the scientific stuff as well. Can you imagine we are made of such crystals, 400 by 276 pixels. So tiny and went for only a Tezos on primary.
00:34:08.426 - 00:34:27.888, Speaker A: Now you have to pay 13 addition of ten on secondary. So part of gift studies work, I just want to see if we've seen their work before. I feel like, yeah, we looked at Voronoia. Interesting. I don't know what that means. That sounds like greek. We looked at Voronoia yesterday.
00:34:27.888 - 00:35:20.364, Speaker A: So more work from gift studies, Elie Lowe. So let me get the mic set up here. So, pretty wild work as usual from Ellie Lowe, one of my favorite trash artists, that's for sure. I never know what's going on, but it always seems very impressive. I mean, look at this. And this looks like a gas portable kind of kerosene gas tank or something. Trash fire day ringage buy for Fortezos on secondary board me social club continues the pixel art portraits and or the PFP project.
00:35:20.364 - 00:35:44.284, Speaker A: So he's got a few now. There's still one on primary here. Oh, actually that's not a pixel artwork. 35, 55. I mean, what are these selling for? Does he sell them? Have they sold yet? Yeah, eight. So he's taking eight tazos generally. So pretty reasonable for a one of one by board me social club, byte by bit.
00:35:44.284 - 00:36:22.284, Speaker A: I think Ilay picked this up, spacerunner Nebula's exploration, 1990 twin portal. So again, this is kind of like the more, I mean, we know byte by bit from all the planets and the constellations and the nebulas. This series, the Spacerunner series, seems to be more of a Sci-Fi series because it has the cube. And then you get these, you know, it seems to be bite by bit experimenting, even these crazy lines and the rainbow. So interesting one of one here by by bit, I think we have others. And this still uses pc paint, pixel and deluxe. I will.
00:36:22.284 - 00:36:50.306, Speaker A: So just more experimentation. Okay. And then there was a new software here, 1991 Kidpix 1.0 DOS mode. So this is almost byte by bit signature kind of move, which is using a lot of these vintage software, or retro tools, as I like to call them. So interesting here. Just more not afraid to experiment and just do what the software wants you to do.
00:36:50.306 - 00:37:26.524, Speaker A: Also using Kidpix 1.0. So playing around here, just kind of interesting, interesting abstracts, right? And this was found by Sabato. He posted some works that he was looking at and liking. And so let's see if we can get this going. I'm not sure if there's volume on it. There isn't. So just a couch, but kind of a pretty cool, I guess you'd call this a glitch work of a couch, a future couch by Eizo, who I had never seen before, and maybe I brought up actually already Eizo's work, I think I did.
00:37:26.524 - 00:37:50.388, Speaker A: Right. So a lot of these kind of retro tvs here and all sorts of kind of glitch work right. So anyways, I like the couch. There's something about it. Future couch. I guess people did, too. Let's just look at what it went for on the market here very quickly because now it's on secondary for 35.
00:37:50.388 - 00:38:14.662, Speaker A: Let's just take a quick look. Accepted offers for five. And that was it. Okay, so for five, Tezos went one to Sabato there. And continuing on, glitch David, who we also looked at, I believe, yesterday, vhs glitch number 14. Nice kind of museum title. And so here you are, just an interesting.
00:38:14.662 - 00:38:39.542, Speaker A: Another glitch artist using Panasonic. So using, you know, analog hardware, I believe, Panasonic WJ shart, slim cam, VCR player, CrT. So very analog, similar to LB there. Buy for one Tezos edition of ten. And there are eight left. So largely unknown. I think we looked at them glitch David yesterday.
00:38:39.542 - 00:39:03.284, Speaker A: Yeah. This corrupt rom number six. So that is gone now. Continuing on, Doctor version, who we another sort of glitch, video artist, digital latex. So continuing in that kind of cube series by Doctor version, edition of five is a sold out, or maybe. Yes, it is sold out. Went for three.
00:39:03.284 - 00:39:27.044, Speaker A: And this is interesting, Daniel W. Doing a last Supper. However, it's on Manifold XYZ, but not as an open edition. This was similar to Sabato doing the. The bid, I guess you'd call it. It's like a gallery. See Gallery Manifold XYZ Redux collection Final piece the Last Supper.
00:39:27.044 - 00:40:01.718, Speaker A: So starting at one ETH, the final piece of the redux collection, the recreation of the Last Supper by Leonardo. And I think I saw a tweet by Daniel W. Saying that this was his first work on Ethereum. So. Yeah, so anyways, pretty awesome as usual. A couple of works by ATV also in this kind of Renaissance art. So here's David LSD Dosis 18, buy for a Tezos 50.
00:40:01.718 - 00:40:26.944, Speaker A: And here's the Mona Lisa, buy for two tezos. And it glitched out. And hagle with an addition of 55, buy for $4.99. And that's all on secondary. So in Haglook is having a lot of success here with these architectural structures that are flashing. He also got help from Aksin, who picked up a work. So just kind of interesting kids placed 7780.
00:40:26.944 - 00:41:06.234, Speaker A: You see how quickly this market can move a work from an artist who I think we've seen before, flaustitanerum. And this is called eternity, kind of a. And this is on super rare, kind of a mystical looking drawing here. Kind of has an eastern feel to it. So Sci-Fi, you see almost the lotus flower here, but a Sci-Fi person here and then galaxies in space rather than, you know, the India indian pantheon of gods. So, you know, you'd almost expect this to be like a Ganesh type, you know, figure here. So very interesting work.
00:41:06.234 - 00:41:22.150, Speaker A: Already has an offer for an ETH. So pretty impressive. This is another kind of interesting work by Turkirak. Edition of 20. Stash in the closet. So the naked couple. The man is being hidden in the closet.
00:41:22.150 - 00:41:40.504, Speaker A: Likely the husband or boyfriend is coming home here. So kind of classic Turkarak here. Continuing on. Head on stick, who I'd never seen before. I don't think death is a curse by, for one tezos. So just an odd drawing. I think I found this in someone's collection.
00:41:40.504 - 00:41:57.984, Speaker A: Just an interesting, odd drawing. Shall we bring up their page very quickly here? Yeah. So just interesting illustrator. Right? Look at that. So very, very interesting. A couple of pages of work. I thought that last one was particularly nice.
00:41:57.984 - 00:42:12.324, Speaker A: Badala. You're the black rabbit. Again, this kind of has a contemporary art feel. I'm trying to think of the artists that this reminds me of. But anyways, a new one, and this artist is called Badala. Okay. Rabbit girl and friends.
00:42:12.324 - 00:42:29.420, Speaker A: So I think we've seen another from this series. This is a new one of this girl and a rabbit. Continuing on, Flora Marquez. Now, tradscape actually said, hey, he sent me a message at one point. We should show. You should show some more Flora Marquez. And I think I showed a couple here.
00:42:29.420 - 00:42:54.984, Speaker A: I'm a big fan, and we know her from this. The stamps. Okay. She's kind of a well known artist, I'd say, on Tazos. One of these artists that you come across early on when you're exploring the Tezos blockchain, she put out a bunch of one of ones just in the last couple of weeks here since January 1. Moving on from the stamps, at least temporarily. So again, this is the last stamp.
00:42:54.984 - 00:43:12.008, Speaker A: I never even saw this one. And these kind of from a fake republic, I assume, or Ondanga republic. And, yeah, editions of ten. I missed this one. This came out in December 19. So a cool work. I'm a huge fan of these stamps, as tradscape is as well.
00:43:12.008 - 00:43:31.042, Speaker A: Ophelia's house. Here are a few of the one of ones. I picked this one up. They're cheap. They're ten tezos for a one of one. And so, again, for a pretty well known artist like this, what I particularly like technically was it's almost. These almost look like erase marks, you see that, like how the.
00:43:31.042 - 00:43:52.134, Speaker A: I don't know what they are, but you see the marks underneath. And that really just gives the whole work, it takes it beyond an illustration to kind of a sophisticated, you know, work of art when you start leaving in these marks here. So I thought that was really nicely done. There's no Monday that we can't battle. 16 January. Nice, nice work. I have a few more here.
00:43:52.134 - 00:44:13.518, Speaker A: And again, you see that kind of those marks that are left, that little subtlety can make the whole difference. 15 January, 2023. So kind of a journal of sorts. 11 January. Let's take the long road. Enjoying the landscape. So kind of in her style of the stamps, but almost looking like a sketchbook of sorts with these.
00:44:13.518 - 00:44:34.984, Speaker A: Again, these interesting gray marks which just add so much. It just makes. Sometimes it's all it needs. Like, I mean, it kind of reminds me of that Robert Rauschenberg work where he erased de Kooning, which we can bring up here. Erased de Koenig. Where de Kooning. I'm probably pronouncing de Kooning wrong.
00:44:34.984 - 00:45:18.274, Speaker A: Where Rauschenberg, if I know the story right, went to de Kooning's studio and got a drawing from him and asked him if he could erase it and present it. So it's kind of a concept artwork. So here it is. Erase de Kooning by Robert Rauschenberg. Kind of a famous kind of conceptual art piece, but also kind of interesting, especially with, you know, Robert Rauschenberg, who used a lot of chants, you know, being really influenced by John Cage, who was a contemporary, continuing on, an artist we haven't looked at before, Eva, who's just an abstract artist. And some geometric abstraction. This is a recent one from last week called bridges.
00:45:18.274 - 00:45:37.652, Speaker A: And so here you can just see some abstraction. Kind of looks like an interior but also an exterior. At the same time. We became a big family of 4000 people. Thank you, everyone. So maybe she has quite a few followers here. And digital artist and architect.
00:45:37.652 - 00:46:05.430, Speaker A: So here you can see kind of a minimalist work. Love this Christmas work here. So another one again, which looks kind of like a kitchen here. This almost has a feeling of a dishwasher in an oven. But who knows? It's geometric abstraction, interdimensional, part of the 2022 essential collection, also out last week. And how much does this go for? Addition of one went for 100. So a pretty nice market for Ava.
00:46:05.430 - 00:46:31.448, Speaker A: Very nice. And finally, before we run through the AI here, walk rage against the machine. I guess that's an album cover. Probably part of that whole series. This is a digital work at auction for only 15 tezos right now. So very cool digital art from Wok. And I'm not going to go through this thread, but I'm giving you the heads up.
00:46:31.448 - 00:47:16.544, Speaker A: This is a really, I'm not really big into these thread, but sometimes they get me these Twitter threads. And Barsy, whose Twitter handle is hey Barsi, takes you through a whole bunch of hacks on mid journey. Here's a mega thread with resources to know everything about mid journey in five minutes. We could spend the whole episode actually untangling this. There are some great hacks in here, say how to use commas. The difference between using the commas and not how to get higher quality, and the artist lists that you can reference to get artists in the style. There is a ton of hacks in here using no.
00:47:16.544 - 00:47:37.364, Speaker A: If you don't want lettuce, you use the no. So this is a really, really good thread for kind of learn, you know, how to increase the quality. The default is q one. If you put this, it goes to q five. There are a lot of great hacks in here. Style s one. So I've kind of run through it and you can even sell prompts.
00:47:37.364 - 00:48:21.158, Speaker A: So anyways, very interesting thread there. FYI, Glitchtown Arcade is partnering up with dehiscience on AI and also glitch rom, seemingly in the AI computer. So buy for 30 edition of ten. So very cool combination of glitch rom and AI, which I don't know if I've ever seen before. Interesting title for the collection, techno trance, which some of us grew up with back in the day. Just remember her who did the frog work. So she is releasing a whole bunch and her collection is called into the garden, and it uses.
00:48:21.158 - 00:49:02.256, Speaker A: This is what I want to highlight here. Photography, film, hand drawings, paintings, printmaking to make flowers, clay and botanicals to create dyes and paints that are of the earth themselves. These colors, as close as how I see, is as close to how I see our garden as I possibly could get. So pretty interesting. We were commenting on this, I think, yesterday about everything that's being put into this. Finally, some AI works which I'm going to run through here. Poly Jojo with what looks like almost a Fra Angelico or Giotto inspired altarpiece, but with Star wars figures, I thought quite successfully done, you know.
00:49:02.256 - 00:49:30.100, Speaker A: And these are jedis, apparently. The dark father and disciples AI and Photoshop from Paulijojo edition of one. Let's just see quickly what that went for. That went for $6.66 so a pretty reasonable price. And Rey de las Humberges. So this looks like kind of a Ronald McDonald King burger or Burger King.
00:49:30.100 - 00:49:48.052, Speaker A: It's the Burger King. So by Pauly Jojo. Edition of five, available for two tezos. And he had another one. Now, this is probably the Ronald McDonald. And there's the McDonald sign. Lord Ragin Valder of Clan MacDonald in Scotland, 1685.
00:49:48.052 - 00:50:07.084, Speaker A: AI and Photoshop. So more AI work. Zoom starts a new, seemingly new series here. We'll check Charlotte new AI portrait series under her AI. Guys, Zoom. I guess she has two in this series. And there's another one here, Amelia.
00:50:07.084 - 00:50:37.088, Speaker A: So very interesting. I wonder if that's Amelia Earhart. Who knows? But interesting portraits there. Editions of ten. Marina Amadova with a couple with a twins. Work Infinity of cognition edition of ten and see how she's doing here. And these are going for pretty reasonable prices here at seven and 20 on for the later editions here, edition of ten.
00:50:37.088 - 00:51:04.234, Speaker A: And finally, some works by Mister Shapeless. And this was quite interesting, too. So he puts out this work as he does a lot on Twitter, he says, still available to mint this work on foundation. And remember, we were looking at acid boy and it was someone else that was doing almost like PFP style. Well, Mister Shapeless is doing that. 0.08 ETH has sold 150.
00:51:04.234 - 00:51:51.974, Speaker A: So, I mean, that is not nothing, right? That's probably twelve ETH, which is what, $16,000? So Mister Shapeless continues to rake it in using this PFP trope to sell, I guess what you'd call it, generative art. You know, I think it's generative. I'm not sure exactly how it works. There's a thread about the series in Mister Shapeless's Twitter feed, and just a few more works with these fantastic clouds here, these fantastic landscapes, which I show almost every day here, and these great stars. Yeah, just great work from Mister Shapeless. And that, my friends, is your show. Thank you for joining me once again, and hopefully I see you on Twitter spaces tomorrow where we do it all again with rare, which should be super interesting.
00:51:51.974 - 00:51:54.534, Speaker A: So thank you for joining me. Until next time, take care.
