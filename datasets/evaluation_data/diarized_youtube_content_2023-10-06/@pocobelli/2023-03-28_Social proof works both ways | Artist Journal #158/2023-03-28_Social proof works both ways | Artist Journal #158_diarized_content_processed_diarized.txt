00:00:03.120 - 00:00:31.438, Speaker A: Full speed ahead, everyone. We are sailing at a fast clip, and we cannot slow down. We must get through this and show note. I'm going away this weekend to Tuscany for a week. And that music is that triumphant music, is the feeling I have when I say I'm going to Tuscany. So, anyways, welcome back, everyone. Artist Journal, March 28, 2023, broadcasting from a beautiful Berlin, Germany.
00:00:31.438 - 00:01:04.460, Speaker A: Welcome back. My name is Adrian Poker Belly, and we are at it again. And, yeah, when I'm back. So I'm gonna take a week off next week, and when I'm back, I think I'm still gonna do the Twitter spaces, though, which is on Wednesdays. And there's another coming up tomorrow, as we'll see here right away. But when I come back, I'm gonna try and tighten up the show a little bit because I think it's a big ask for people to watch an hour a day. Some people sketch during it, which kind of, like, consoles me somewhat, but I still think it's too long.
00:01:04.460 - 00:01:37.422, Speaker A: And so, anyways, I am going to put a serious effort into reducing the time here. But so in that spirit, let's begin. Look at this very, very interesting use of what I'm assuming is the blur filter. But maybe it's not. Maybe these are just very soft, you know, super soft brushes. I don't know how this was made, but it really turns your head, doesn't it? I mean, it feels very original. It's kind of like, you know, Dan control, who uses the gradients.
00:01:37.422 - 00:02:32.810, Speaker A: I call him, like, a gradient artist almost because that is his trademark. I mean, a lot. There are others as well, but it's almost in the sense that using the gradient tool is almost a very counterintuitive tool to use because it's hard to make look good. And that's almost what it's like with these super. If that's what this is, these super fuzzy brushes. But then when someone takes it a step further and, you know, follows the logic of the fuzzy brush or of the gradient tool, it starts to go somewhere, which maybe is a kind of lesson for us in kind of really pursuing things, you know, even if at first they might not seem like they're, you know, gonna win the, you know, the prettiest picture in the world award now. Because interestingly, however, I would say this is quite a pretty picture, quite an interesting picture.
00:02:32.810 - 00:02:53.506, Speaker A: I'd even say this is provocative in a certain kind of way, aesthetically speaking. But, I mean, it's beautiful. But again, it kind of. I would argue the reason I'm starting with this is because it kind of upsets our sensibilities a bit, I would argue. Interesting little details here, too. I mean, I don't know if you can see this here. I think you can.
00:02:53.506 - 00:03:25.164, Speaker A: It almost looks like a signature that's scratched into a photo or something weird like that. And you do get these. Not only is it just a portrait of whoever this is, this Sci-Fi person, this heat map of sorts here, but you also have these bizarre rectangles here. So. And again, the signature maybe tops it off as far as just the, you know, provocation here. So the artist is oxloom, if I'm pronouncing that right. Zero xloom auxloom.
00:03:25.164 - 00:03:45.662, Speaker A: And the title of the work is Kong. It is currently being bid for. I assume the auction will be over by the time you see this. The video will probably just be up. When you see this strange thing is winning. It's kind of a low auction, you know, starting at 0.05. But it's kind of like a bit of an auction battle here.
00:03:45.662 - 00:04:09.262, Speaker A: Auction war, bidding battle. And strange thing has swooped in here at 0.1 ETH last night. So we'll see if anybody outbids strange thing. But pretty interesting work, I have to say. I mean, I saw Eizos barbecue, which you're gonna see, and I felt that just captured the spring in one image. But.
00:04:09.262 - 00:04:30.910, Speaker A: But I've shown Eizo a billion times, and we're going to show him again here. So let's show someone new here to start us off. And so here, oxlum, or loom, let's call it loom is the name of the artist. And between sleep and dream, a visual journey. So very interesting. And selling. 0.35
00:04:30.910 - 00:05:00.356, Speaker A: ETH, 0.05. Sold to strange thing. So strange thing is a collector of Lume here. And I suppose Lume is a reference to Lumiere or to light. That's what I'm guessing, Skomra. So, yeah, so clearly I'm late to the party with loom, but very interesting artist. Speaking of parties, we're having a party tomorrow on Twitter spaces, as we always do, Wednesday at 09:30 a.m.
00:05:00.356 - 00:06:26.704, Speaker A: Eastern Standard Time. Join Roentun and me and myself, we're going to discuss going from digital to physical in terms of art and what are, in a sense, why would you want to do that and how would you go about doing this? This is something I've thought about, frankly, for years, because before blockchain and before my under, before nfts, let's call it that I would argue the big challenge for digital artists was how to make your work physical in order to actually, you know, get, make a living from selling from your art. And that was a huge challenge. But what's beautiful about that challenge is in that, you know, what I call traveling through the mediums through, in that process, the work can change. And it's actually a fascinating way of thinking about work and what you're doing and taking, you know, your template of what you've done with digital art and even breaking it down into layers or whatever you've done and how it changes this, you know, alchemical transformation, as I like to call it. When you say screen print a pixel art piece, right? And everything that goes with that. So, yeah, so that's what we're going to discuss tomorrow.
00:06:26.704 - 00:07:05.154, Speaker A: Come share your thoughts. Have you done it? Have you thought about it? You know, how can an inkjet printer be used? You know, as I always say here, multi chain, multimedia and multi platform. So this is multimedia. And also, why as an artist, you might want to do that. What are the benefits? Does it show range? You know, is this something you should actually take seriously as a digital artist? If you've never done it before? Does that turn you from just a digital artist into an art, a capital a artist? So some provocative thoughts to get us started here. And, yeah, so that is tomorrow. I've pinned that up on the Twitter feed.
00:07:05.154 - 00:07:37.566, Speaker A: So there you go. Thank you for the comments, as always. And yeah, retro Manny here. Was it Retro Manny? No, is here. Thank you for the comment, Retro Manny and the retweets, and I appreciate everybody who's just kind of really enjoying the show. We were discussing human boy having maybe a common problem that artists face when they come to object or tasos is not enough. People know who they are.
00:07:37.566 - 00:08:28.186, Speaker A: And then there's this issue of you have too much supply and do you need to lower your prices? But maybe it's just people don't know who you are and the work will sell, but it becomes a reinforcing feedback loop that the social proof, which we always come back to here, which is incredibly important, just as understanding the nature of the sales process. Social proof is when other people like it, then you decide you like it. The Amazon review, the testimonial is your classic example. So if an artist is selling out, that is social proof, and you go, oh, well, if all those people like it, it must be good. But it also works in the reverse direction, where if you're not selling anything simply because of a lack of exposure, then all of a sudden the collectors come and they go, oh, maybe this isn't something I should buy because nobody else wants it. It social proof. Very important to understand the mechanics there.
00:08:28.186 - 00:09:07.810, Speaker A: So we were discussing this with human boy, who was kind of struggling with this situation that almost everybody finds themselves in when they begin. So let me just look here, and if we are really wanting this movement to be long term and outlast us, it really isn't a problem at all to have a lot of work out there. I am experimenting at the moment with lowering prices, and we'll start burning some editions down soon as well. That's what I did. In a weird way. I was gonna say, I regret it, but I don't because I find them more collectible. I had editions of 25, let's say, from the secret history of World War three series, which I can't wait to pick up again.
00:09:07.810 - 00:09:50.290, Speaker A: A native phone series, which, you know, I never want to let go of, the native phone series, but I had 25 of each of those, and I think I burned them down to five. And they do feel a lot more collectible now. Maybe it was ten, but I think it was five. And so I don't regret that in the sense that, you know, okay, maybe I would have made an extra, you know, 75 tezos if I had kept it open, because it would have eventually sold. But now they feel really collectible at low edition numbers, so I'm not sure I regret doing that. I think the important thing is to not burn them entirely unless you feel you really have to. So anyways, let's continue.
00:09:50.290 - 00:10:30.508, Speaker A: I think most of the problem will come from people who are collecting just a flip. If they see you aren't selling out, what is their incentive? At the same time, it assures the people collecting your art probably really like it so much to think on and weigh in mind. Yeah, you're really forced as a digital artist, NFT based digital artist. You are forced. You know, not having a gallery is great because you don't need to really give a commission unless you want to consider object. But generally speaking, being your own gallery has its benefits, but you also are in the sales game, so you are forced to learn about it. So, yeah, it is a lot to think about.
00:10:30.508 - 00:11:01.676, Speaker A: And the flippers? Yeah, I don't mind the flippers. Right. In the sense that if I'm an artist and the flippers decide I'm a hot artist to collect and they can make money, I mean, I have mixed feelings about it and like I always say, I may live to regret saying these words, but it's great from the I sell everything on primary, you guys figure it out. It's almost one way of looking at it with the flippers. But again, yeah. So anyways, it's complicated, I think, to human boy's point. And thank you again.
00:11:01.676 - 00:11:20.326, Speaker A: I love the art from Ora Fleming. And welcome Flora. And thank you for the comment. I love the art that means a lot. So continuing on, so we're discussing traveling through the mediums here. And we are back to Rinny Fish and who also sent a really nice comment. I love your show.
00:11:20.326 - 00:11:47.394, Speaker A: Thank you, Rinny. Your art is awesome and original. And I wanted to show this because this is an example. We're gonna see a few examples, this show of traveling through the mediums or going from digital to physical. And here in this gorgeous studio here of rinifish, you see works by rinifish hanging here and then works on the computer. So very, very interesting to see. Nice studio.
00:11:47.394 - 00:12:11.178, Speaker A: And these kind of shots are very valuable, I think, to share with people because it goes, oh, okay. Rini is a pretty serious artist. Look at that studio. So another reason to just post, you know, your situation as an artist on Twitter as much as possible. Also here we were looking at Rosatio's work. This is also Winnie Fish. Enjoy the bug forest in Dubai.
00:12:11.178 - 00:12:49.824, Speaker A: So also in the secret room there at art, I think digital art Dubai or art digital Dubai. So again, organized by Tuda Dubai and Project 22 art. So let's look at this. Maybe I can make it. There we go again. The alchemy of scale looks pretty awesome. And let's just take a very quick look here, see if we have party.
00:12:49.824 - 00:13:22.124, Speaker A: So it's pretty cool when you go big. It's pretty cool. People are sharing video. Cool music too, isn't it? Look at that. And on the ceiling too. So anyways, just another example of how projectors are so totally awesome to show digital art. And of course, this is Rennie Fish's work, which we've been looking at here the last week or two.
00:13:22.124 - 00:13:53.356, Speaker A: Very, very interesting work continuing on artists of today. So this is, I'm not sure if it's Lego Geo or Legojo. So Legojo is putting on a whole world on foundation. And this includes a lot of the artists that we follow here. And I'm also in it. So I just want to share what Lugojo is curating here. So just FYI, here's geek.
00:13:53.356 - 00:14:15.464, Speaker A: So we recognize a lot of these. Argus drank Frazetta with a really cool work. Beware the memes of March, which is really cool. This almost looks physical. And here we have board, me, social club and quilanina, which is awesome. Huge, huge fan of her work. And there I am.
00:14:15.464 - 00:14:40.936, Speaker A: So I put a new screen memories out, which is kind of exciting for me. I've been sitting on that one for a few weeks here. And also the stair and halo. So as you can see, Kurt Hussle collective, a very fun look at this work by Dan Control. Spectacular work here by Dan Control. I love this work. And of course, our great friends, Kurt Hussle collective and so many more.
00:14:40.936 - 00:15:01.372, Speaker A: So anyways, just a heads up on that ton of artists in here. So anyways, that is happening. We could spend all day going through this, but shout out to Legojo for putting that on. Everything will be listed on April 1. So that is coming up. So check it out. You know, this is actually interesting in itself.
00:15:01.372 - 00:15:24.764, Speaker A: This headline. This is not what I was going to go to, but Gagosian Dali enabled art exhibition interesting. But this is what I wanted to highlight here. Sotheby's sale of glitch art postponed after artists complain about all mail sale. So once again, this scene is on the front page of art news. So isn't that interesting? And it was. Yeah, they went into it here.
00:15:24.764 - 00:16:08.302, Speaker A: I don't know if we have too much time to go into it here, but basically you can find. Actually, I'll show you what I wanted to mention. It was actually at the end. So two of the artists, like glitch artists and theorists, as far as I understand, they have been contacted by Sothebys with tentative offers to participate in the show as an artist and curator, respectively. Right. Because they showed, I believe it was Mankman's work. In the write up, Mankman noticed that one of her works was being used in the auction's description of the history of glitch art.
00:16:08.302 - 00:16:40.748, Speaker A: But then she wasn't in the sale nor asked. And then. So they're basically trying to make amends here. And Mankman and Darkstone said that they have since been contacted by Sotheby's with tentative offers to participate in the show as an artist and curator, respectively. Darkstone said the outcome was as exciting, was an exciting result from a moment of protest. Quote, I feel cautiously optimistic, said Darkstone. I think it shows that art communities coming together and speaking out against injustice can really make a difference.
00:16:40.748 - 00:17:23.704, Speaker A: And I think it also shows goodwill on Sotheby's part because, you know, it's sort of easy. And deservedly they were attacked. But I think it shows that, you know, again, it was probably just one person who's maybe inexperienced, maybe that's a generous interpretation, a charitable interpretation. But my philosophy on these things is assume the best at first and then go from there. So anyways, I think it's a nice kind of a allswell that ends well kind of situation. Interestingly, I brought up the page, I was just kind of curious, and it is a 404. Now they have taken down the glitch sale.
00:17:23.704 - 00:18:03.934, Speaker A: And finally, on the Sabato, this is a blast from my past, my first interview as a glitch artist from back in 2014. So, you know, there are a lot of artists here who have been involved in this whole movement, including Sabato here. And I'm gonna put out actually some shorts, some video shorts of Sabato actually explaining his understanding of glitch in our Twitter spaces, which was super fascinating. So that'll come out this week. Actually, kinda in the spirit of that gogolitis clip I put out. I'm gonna be putting out a lot more of that stuff anyways, and just kind of another interesting thing on this. And then we'll keep running here.
00:18:03.934 - 00:18:44.672, Speaker A: You know, as you look at the Sotheby's page, I thought to myself, how different is this from like a foundation world, you know, and then. Or like a nifty gateway collection here, mythical media, hitch switter, hitch switchers playing off switch hitters, hitch switchers, mythical media. So there's a sale, there's a curated show here on Nifty Gateway, know, promotion and everything. And here it is. And it's sort of like, other than social proof, you know, the brand name that Sotheby's brings. I mean, how different is this? The mechanics are no different. Maybe here it's.
00:18:44.672 - 00:19:33.512, Speaker A: Maybe it's slightly different in terms of these are open editions and the other is an auction. But all to say, you know, a foundation world is an auction. And all to say, the barriers to entry here for people that just actually want to meet Sothebys on their own, they can provide an alternative experience with free tools, with foundation worlds. And I just thought that was interesting. Maybe thats the reason Sothebys feels the need to be involved here, because if the digital art world becomes as big as the contemporary art world, they have a lot to lose by not being involved now. So I think that's probably part of their initiative here. We can't let that just because crypto's not, you know, going down doesn't mean we can, you know, let this whole digital art thing go.
00:19:33.512 - 00:19:55.780, Speaker A: So it continues. So anyways, here's just a very cool show here with, you know, I think John Cates is notable and Sky Goodman as glitch artists. Okay, I'm not familiar. We know. Tuks, I'm not sure if this. I don't think this is technically a glitch show, but I am not an expert in glitch. I leave that to others.
00:19:55.780 - 00:21:25.170, Speaker A: Anyways, this is happening and isn't that exciting and cool? Unknown collector back with more commentary for us to chew on here in a not too far away future in the exponential growth of AI. Everyone that didn't listen to these scarcity experts and minted how much they wanted will be happy that they have proof on the blockchain that their art wasn't made by AI. What do you think? Or will there always exist art that can't be created by it? Like now? I think even physical art won't be safe, to be honest. So maybe a bit of a, you know, I don't want to say an engagement, trying to fish for engagement, but I think it brings up an interesting idea, which is this idea that at a certain point, if the AI becomes so good that it can make a pokebally that is as good as one that me, the person makes, and that is indistinguishable. Unknown collector is forwarding the provocative thesis that you're going to be glad that you minted everything you did before that was possible, because it being made by a human, perhaps would make it more valuable, let's say, if I understand it right. So anyways, just interesting thoughts on AI and where this could all go. Maybe the most provocative of all is this idea that, you know, to make your art, you might not even be required, you know, let's say.
00:21:25.170 - 00:21:51.062, Speaker A: And also to another comment on the market situation, Rob from Nifty Gateway, who always kind of has a nice positive view on things. To those feeling down, sales may have slowed down and your confidence is dwindling. Keep your head up and keep crafting. Forget about the market and remember your why. Something we've basically been saying over here, too. This is the best time to explore and go beyond your comfort zone. Totally true.
00:21:51.062 - 00:22:30.580, Speaker A: You'll be amazed at what may come from it. So, wise words from Rob at Nifty Gateway. I totally agree with this, because if you're starting, you know, it's kind of like the, you almost want to call it the artist's dilemma. And we were discussing this, that, let's say you have a series that does really well, you get picked up by a gallery, then they're kind of expecting that you're going to make more of that. And if you don't, then what? And then maybe that creates friction and whatnot. So when you're not making sales, it has its benefits because then you can experiment more if that's something you want to do. So all to say and just kind of a fun way of contextualizing this scene.
00:22:30.580 - 00:22:55.180, Speaker A: So Alex Gray, a lot of, you know, is a very famous, probably the most famous visionary artist, I would say. And so here, Marcel Pinel. Marcelo Pinel, also known as cyber mystic, so honored to have a master artist whose work has inspired and fascinated me for decades start following me. A great honor. Thank you. Alex Gray. So that is cool and just kind of noteworthy.
00:22:55.180 - 00:23:28.022, Speaker A: And this, of course, is Alex Gray. We've shown Alex Gray in the past. I went to the cosm, I guess it was like a gallery space when it was in Chelsea, I think in 2007 in New York. And yeah, seeing these works up close like this one net of being, they really, the pictures don't actually do them justice. I mean, theolog, we might have to do a search on theologue to find it here. Theologue is one of the most astonishing works. Here it is.
00:23:28.022 - 00:23:59.458, Speaker A: This work here is quite astonishing to see in person. And it's like oil on, like linen cloth or something like, it is a stunning work of art. And a lot of these works and the photos on the Internet don't always translate. So anyways, this is who Alex Gray is, if you don't know. And yeah, I mean, these are kind of, you'll see these kind of works in the hard rock cafe. Very metaphysical works and just very powerful, powerful works. And also cyber mystic Garden.
00:23:59.458 - 00:24:31.994, Speaker A: Soon I'll be doing something I want to for a long time. I'll start a new collection about zodiac signs. Stay tuned. So anyways, just a couple of little mini news items from Marcelo Pinel, who is a very interesting artist. So 911 act of war. So this is by walk, also an artist that is digital and physical. So a very interesting, basically the treatment that walk gives to a lot of album covers looks like it's been applied to the COVID of the New York Post from 911.
00:24:31.994 - 00:24:56.854, Speaker A: So interesting choice. And this is an open edition, five minted for three tazos. Meanwhile, walk is also working physically. And this is, you know, there's again, a huge benefit. And it's not just in terms of. And again, we'll get into this tomorrow. The really, it's not just in terms of, say, increasing your credibility as an artist, I would argue.
00:24:56.854 - 00:25:32.514, Speaker A: Feel free to disagree, but I think it shows range. But also working in different mediums, say, like here with spray paint and writing. Actually, for example, this informs your ideas when you come back to digital, and vice versa when you work digitally, that can inform your physical. So it's actually a very beneficial way of just kind of learning more about the process of making images. So, anyways, these are really interesting. I think of my friend Ben, who does a lot of kind of words and memes and whatever. And so, anyways, this is.
00:25:32.514 - 00:25:49.574, Speaker A: He can paint pretty well with a spray can, if that's what's going on here. And beautiful, beautiful drips and everything. So that is walk. Is there another, I think, yeah, there's another here. Basically the same idea. Continuing on. More mixed media.
00:25:49.574 - 00:26:05.442, Speaker A: More mixed media. So naturism, nature, licht, urism. Sounds almost like German there. Almost. So just kind of an interesting artwork here. This looks like multimedia. It looks physical.
00:26:05.442 - 00:26:26.384, Speaker A: I think this is physical, but let's see if we can find out more. Quite a nice composition, if you ask me. This is, like, if this is a physical work, it's quite beautiful. It may be both, because you see here, like, this almost looks like collage, but maybe it's actually a photo of the work, maybe traveling through the medium. Let's. Through the mediums. Let's see.
00:26:26.384 - 00:26:58.766, Speaker A: Public domain photo collage, drawing and painting. Digital mixed media by naturalictourism, 2023.89. So maybe this is using both. I mean, digital mixed media. I suspect it's using both. And this is a whole other frontier that, you know, it could really, where there's just so many possibilities, let's put it that way. So, you know, generally, when we're physical, we tend to stay physical.
00:26:58.766 - 00:27:45.334, Speaker A: When we're working digital, we're kind of working in a digital universe. It's quite interesting to mix those two together. And so, anyways, untitled love by naturalictourism. And here is other work which also looks quite stunning here. Mixed media. So you see looking very, very nice here. So artists surfing the chaos, and one of my favorite artists, who I simply don't show enough here, graphica, I think PNG is how you'd say it, also using several different techniques, as far as I remember, Graphica said on Twitter maybe a month or two ago, AI collage and digital painting.
00:27:45.334 - 00:28:20.610, Speaker A: So, again, working through different, you know, mediums and techniques and look at the results. I mean, there's nothing like it. And these distortions are just absolutely wonderful. And because basically, when you're looking through this piece, you're always kind of surprised. And as I like to say, you know, unpredictability is the hallmark of good art. Just like a song when you know the line that's going to come up next maybe isn't the greatest song when you already know what it is before you even hear it. So when you are constantly kind of surprised, say with this, there's always something to kind of chew on.
00:28:20.610 - 00:28:51.544, Speaker A: Even just like these strange clouds which are actually just holes in the blue and revealing this blue underneath. Really beautiful work, this stretching again, kind of like we were saying in that original piece where. That we started with, where things that kind of might offend our aesthetic sensibilities at first, but then keeping going with that until you actually arrive somewhere. That's kind of how this feels a little bit. Reserve of 0.3693 fellas. Graphica three faces of one soul.
00:28:51.544 - 00:29:14.862, Speaker A: Kindness, determination and strength together in harmony form the perfect triad of the human spirit. So a lot going on here. A lot going on. So beautiful, beautiful work. And here is just more graphica png I think we looked at this last week and just a really interesting, cool artist. I mean, you see that fire. Really unique and interesting.
00:29:14.862 - 00:29:29.576, Speaker A: Just love it. So very cool. Here's an artist we haven't looked at in what feels like months. This is Rick Ostenbruch. The indecisive title says it all. This is me. A self portrait.
00:29:29.576 - 00:29:43.512, Speaker A: A self portrait. In the end, a product can never be finished in one way. Especially not when striving for perfection. Perfection does not exist. So this was transferred. This was made about a week ago. See if we can make it bigger.
00:29:43.512 - 00:30:01.260, Speaker A: Not sure we can. This is on super rare, but I didn't even realize. So when you click on it. Weird. When you click on it. Let me just try reloading in case maybe I am not getting something right. But anyways, a beautiful looking work there.
00:30:01.260 - 00:30:17.046, Speaker A: Again, the indecisive by Riek. Maybe I'll let that load up a bit. We'll come back. Here's another work by Rick Ostenbruch. So you see here, it's moving. Kind of a similar idea. Although the other here, this is brushstrokes.
00:30:17.046 - 00:30:48.974, Speaker A: So I'm not sure what this is. Is this interactive art? Is this my computer not working? Anyway, it's really interesting to see these different. You see the power of the margin here, how it completely transforms all these works. So very interesting. And sent to anonymous. One of one on super rare. Another interesting abstract work, this time by oxine, who also works in a few different kind of styles here or series.
00:30:48.974 - 00:31:08.624, Speaker A: And here, just some of the beautiful distortions. And a square in the middle with that is flashing. Kind of a simple work in some respects. And a square in a square. Beautiful noise and everything. Again, the word that's kind of. I always think of as painterly.
00:31:08.624 - 00:31:39.892, Speaker A: It's very painterly. You see the over here, which. And it all looks like, for me, that it looks like sampling across layers is perhaps how this is done. A one of one for $123 million from Euxine. So a little bit of mysteriousness going on over there. More abstraction this time from Santiago at auction for 15 tezos. And just more kind of interesting work with a touch of pixelation, from the looks of it here.
00:31:39.892 - 00:32:02.052, Speaker A: Massive file, 10,000 by 16,000. I would open this up. Shall we take a massive risk here? And the name of art. Ooh, and here it is. Let's see if the mic gets killed and it looks like it's all going to work. And let's take a look here. And there, my friends, is what's going on here.
00:32:02.052 - 00:32:48.388, Speaker A: So kind of playing with scale a little bit, hey, because it almost looks like the works are vectorized and then made very small, so you can't even tell. And then it almost gives it a texture here. So pretty interesting. I mean, one kind of interesting question for Santiago on this is, what size would you want this to be displayed? Do you prefer it on, say, the screen as we see it now? Or would you rather have it on a wall, say, like we saw with rinnefish at art Digital, Dubai? Because it would change, right, if you made it the whole wall. Continuing on, another work by Santiago. Interesting. Almost what looks like a light green at the bottom here.
00:32:48.388 - 00:33:11.168, Speaker A: And again, playing with just this digital noise. Thanks, everyone, for your images. Here's what I could put together so far. So almost, like I said before, putting it through the meat grinder here, taking everybody's images and putting it through a meat grinder. So very cool. As far as I understand, also from Santiago, a work from Ed Morolla. I thought this was a stunning work.
00:33:11.168 - 00:33:26.732, Speaker A: Purple gallery, new acquisition. And this sold, I think, right away. Yeah, within ten minutes for 55 tezos. So really cool work here. I love the gallery works, for some reason. I think a lot of us do. Pixel 2023.
00:33:26.732 - 00:33:56.634, Speaker A: And, as you're saying, more pixel art. I think we could call this pixel art for the gallery here of a gallery. And here you see this massive work with these tiny figures and people talking about the work. Kind of reminds me of an Umberto bocconi. Let's just look. Umberto Bocconi, is it? Revolution in the gallery. One of my favorite futurist works.
00:33:56.634 - 00:34:21.794, Speaker A: Yeah, here. Here it is. What do they call this? Futurism's riots. So riot in the Galleria by Umberto Bocconi, 1910. Kind of has a similar feeling to that one. I mean by gallery here. I think they mean like the gallery, like almost like as an arcade in the sense of a mall.
00:34:21.794 - 00:34:51.824, Speaker A: Here you see a cafe. So I'm not sure this is an art gallery, but maybe. So anyways, this kind of, I mean, at a very indirect way, this is just a great work, so I'm just happy to share it with you. And when I see these people talking here and everybody talking and all the figures, a distant echo of bocconi there. Continuing on, rosatio. So we saw this displayed again at Art Dubai. And so now here it has finally been minted.
00:34:51.824 - 00:35:17.080, Speaker A: And of course the Jeff Koons dog on foundation. So here, Rosacea with a reserve of 0.69. And there it is, raising the reserve. So a comedy of an expensive error. So cool title two. And just very interesting work as always. Again, using collage and digital painting, digital collage and digital drawing created and animated in Adobe photoshop.
00:35:17.080 - 00:35:37.064, Speaker A: 1500 by 1500. Great work. Another really cool artist that I haven't seen from for a while, Axstone on super rare with a. With a collaboration from Ledger, which is kind of interesting as we're going to see. They kind of seem to have their own marketplace of sorts. Hello. I'm thrilled to finally share my collaboration with Ledger with much love and excitement.
00:35:37.064 - 00:36:04.248, Speaker A: I've finished my bomb effect work and I hope you get lost in all the intricate details. So just really fun, original, interesting work here. Interesting contrast with this kind of sun or moon through the haze here. A gradient contrasting with all this, like what I'd call illustration style. Nice touch there. And there is a signature there. Another theme we like to talk about here.
00:36:04.248 - 00:36:32.186, Speaker A: And anyway, there is a ton of detail and these computers and a cursor here. Digital cursor, old computers, all of it really fun and really cool with all the characters. And here it is on market. Dot ledger.com and claim starts in two days, 5 hours. Another turkish artist. There are so many great turkish artists.
00:36:32.186 - 00:37:10.394, Speaker A: Selene Sinyar is a turkish artist and illustrator. Her client list includes Apple, Mercedes Benz and Nike, and she's been featured in publications including Vogue and high fructose. Pretty awesome. I'm not surprised that she's shown up in high fructose I mean this would fit the bill for sure. And here is just more on their marketplace here. Inspired by ledger patronage program for digital artists and creatives ledger commissions top artists from within the web3 ecosystem to create works that explore the ledger brand and mission. And for those that don't know, this is a ledger basically cold storage for your crypto to keep it safe.
00:37:10.394 - 00:37:37.178, Speaker A: Safe. But it should and everybody should use one. So anyways, just a heads up there ledger is getting into the NFT game. Maybe they already are, I don't know. So Matthias La Plata has unleashed his work here. Matthias La Plata Eternal Cool title is a work of art that I made digitally. Started in October and just finished in March 2023.
00:37:37.178 - 00:37:57.954, Speaker A: The main idea was to generate a piece of art to be remembered when he dies. The work has five hidden messages addressed to my family. If you're interested in finding them. My recommendation is to download the original image from object and investigate all the details of the work with a lot of zoom until you find the messages. Yeah. Thank you to everyone who supports us. And thank you.
00:37:57.954 - 00:38:14.492, Speaker A: Thanks to you, I will be immortal one day. I love Matthias la Plata. And here pixel soup. And now you have to buy on secondary for 122 tezos. Sold out on primary for ten tezos. Nice low edition number. So a great artist.
00:38:14.492 - 00:38:30.228, Speaker A: We love to watch here, Flora Marquez with a new one. Beautiful new illustration. We're a beautiful forest and managing to just keep it new and interesting every day. Here we are. A beautiful forest. Let's just see what's going on here. Transfer to fh two.
00:38:30.228 - 00:38:52.108, Speaker A: So very, very cool and fun. I mean, again, if this goes on for a year, what a series this will be. 26 March. I mean, something to really live and die by. Speaking of which, tie with the most likes. Good meat. So a portrait of what looks like the pope with the pope beanie there.
00:38:52.108 - 00:39:16.014, Speaker A: And it's covered in a coat or in a cloak of ground beef. So classic die with most likes. I love the simple background here. Very nice. Very, very nice. Continuing on, Tazo Gucci, the north face Gucci. So a new work by Kappa Sage continuing this awesome series of what look like gang members.
00:39:16.014 - 00:39:39.144, Speaker A: But who knows? This time with a bit of a Gucci theme. And I'm not sure if this is going. I guess it's not going in Lego Joe's. I think Kappa has a work though that is in that Lego geo show. Anyways, buy for seven tezos. There are still six left on primary and rustic digital art. Art, also known as Uncle Rusty has a new one.
00:39:39.144 - 00:40:22.244, Speaker A: Fine natural tobacco for all the family playing with the video game vibe. And a cigarette ad of a certain kind. Pretty of cool, I have to say. This contrast here and this whole idea, like if, again, it's kind of back to the ad agency thing where if I was an ad agency, if I was to put that hat on, I'd say this guy could be pretty interesting for making some original ads. I mean, if you had a billboard or even if you had like a Google Ad that was like this, but you put your a real product here, probably would do pretty well. Interesting bottom area too here. Fumal tequita agnos de Vida, approved by Tezos Ministry of Health.
00:40:22.244 - 00:40:52.784, Speaker A: So it almost looks like a cigarette package, actually, Uncle Rusty, the failed artist, number 22, self portrait. We're all going to make it. And here it looks like Ronald McDonald and the failed artist hanging out together. And there is interesting composition. Again, a cigarette coming right off the page here. And a little bit of texture here in the oils, contrasting it. Not using all of the oil brush, though.
00:40:52.784 - 00:41:07.864, Speaker A: That's a nice touch. So here we see texture and then here we just see flat. And I think this is made in Microsoft paint. Nice contrast. Buy four, five tazos. All are available. So go support the failed artist there series.
00:41:07.864 - 00:41:39.698, Speaker A: The failed artist series. Mikey Wilson, we outcha made from blooding my own art with the Beatles revolver album cover. So more interesting work from Mikey de la creme here. So Mikey Wilson, aka Mikey Wilson, and on motorbikes here. Just kind of interesting work and interesting to watch it evolve. Nine left on primary available for 420. And a very expensive one of one for a thousand tezos from dan control for this one tree here.
00:41:39.698 - 00:42:13.796, Speaker A: So just kind of an interesting work. Again, this is the gradient artist, as I like to call them. There are a few gradient artists. Lonely, where is everybody? Poetic title from Dan Control, thousand on object Cato with another really cool abstract work here and sticking with the colors and then just playing with kind of a light Awp art theme. But I don't know if I'd call that op art. But anyway, just kind of cool abstractions, very kind of graphic designy. Just show you other work here, maybe I already brought it up.
00:42:13.796 - 00:42:26.012, Speaker A: I did. And yeah, so I've been showing some of these works here. They're pretty nice. And so this was a pretty nice one too. They're usually pretty. Some are pretty high. Edition of 100, some are lower.
00:42:26.012 - 00:42:39.898, Speaker A: This one's nice and low. So anyways, addition of 90 for one tezos each. Can't get a better deal than that. This is another so I don't know. I'll show you. I don't know if you remember the video camera that was kind of being distorted. I'll show you in a second.
00:42:39.898 - 00:42:58.104, Speaker A: This is the same artist, Osborne. Kind of a wild artist here of. Again, we have this cigarette theme with the smoke getting pixelated here. Very interesting. Original artist. I'll show you. Remember this work here? It's that artist with this kind of jumping video camera.
00:42:58.104 - 00:43:23.036, Speaker A: And you come back here. So, similar treatment here, using the GiF. Again, this is something that you can't do. As you can see, it's moving. This is like, you know, by using. We're talking about this, I think, with axin, how you put different layers on. And there's also Santiago, where you do the processed version on one layer, and then you do the original version of the abstract art on another layer, and then you just cycle back and forth.
00:43:23.036 - 00:43:52.330, Speaker A: So this is also kind of what I'm tempted to call, like, a digital solution to your art. It's like, okay, I have all these different versions. Which do I use? And the answer is yes, all of the above. So this also seems to have, like, okay, we'll treat it a whole bunch of different ways, and then we'll just cycle through them, perhaps. Anyways, super interesting wild artist here. Lorna Mills, with what looks like a unicorn. Incurably untrue.
00:43:52.330 - 00:44:17.236, Speaker A: Let me maximize this one of one for 500 tezos. So, interesting color. And a probably, I'm assuming, is still from a movie, or a clip from a movie processed here with some wild colors. Beautiful orange and blue, complementary colors here. Incurably untrue. Really cool work here. This is by Absil, who also does some very illustrative works here.
00:44:17.236 - 00:44:43.172, Speaker A: And you can see the illustration here contrasting that with some heavy, pixelated clouds in the sky. With a window, kind of a Microsoft window, that operating system from the nineties, that basically frames the piece. Interesting kind of, you know, wild work here. So this is, I assume, a fragment absil. New drop tomorrow. So that's probably coming today. Check this out.
00:44:43.172 - 00:45:13.804, Speaker A: Our milk. And we're gonna have to run, as usual through the rest of this. Isn't this interesting? Like, I assume these, like, it's either just pure abstraction here, over top patterning, or it's this kind of tree and leaves. It's probably the tree. It's almost like Klimt, where it's like the trees have been turned into jewels. This jeweled, you know, landscape here. Really, really interesting pixel art here.
00:45:13.804 - 00:45:30.628, Speaker A: And then very nice treatment with the water. Kind of calmly going back and forth. The lily pads. Very original work from Armilk 88 nineties here. And let's just see what it sold for on primary six. Tazos. So you can still get it for a pretty good price.
00:45:30.628 - 00:45:53.312, Speaker A: Pretty close to the mint price. Tired pixels. A new one from Mech TXT. A new landscape. This was not minted, as far as I understand. And accompanying a poem on the rough water, the sailor dreamed the days when waves subsides to foams, then woke up seconds away from Hades, the longing heart of an adventurer. Rome.
00:45:53.312 - 00:46:12.110, Speaker A: So, mech TXT. And this looks like a lighthouse at the. In the bottom here. So playing, continuing to experiment and push his own boundaries. Playing within the margin, this wide, beautiful margin that he uses here. So very interesting pixels and poems. I picked this up.
00:46:12.110 - 00:46:26.646, Speaker A: This was a one of one from stippin pixels. It's part of that series. I'll show you. Remember this series that we've been looking at here, prism for excitement. So another variation. And this got put out, this really interesting one. Solitude's haven.
00:46:26.646 - 00:46:35.110, Speaker A: White snow blankets all. Avalanche. Avalanche loops. Looms overhead. Home amidst the storm. This is a gorgeous work. So I picked it up.
00:46:35.110 - 00:46:45.190, Speaker A: It's 15 tezos. Done deal, sir. Stippin pixels. Very cool work. Super original. Yeah. So that.
00:46:45.190 - 00:47:19.290, Speaker A: And then of course, a new one in the series. Again, looking at kind of this 45 degree angle of just kind of this basic rectangular structure that looks like a home, a small home, feeding the core green ginger. So another kind of interesting pixel artwork here, experimenting with different iconography. This almost looks like an ethereum diamond here, but maybe not a city, a pyramid, and all sorts of stuff here. So. And you see the dithering gradient in the background here, feeding the cork green ginger filled before 35. So sold out.
00:47:19.290 - 00:47:38.344, Speaker A: And is that Marcelo Pinel there? I bet it is. And here you see all it sold for 190 tezos, 96. So two tezos on primary. Now 35 tezos. Actually, this is a different Marcelo. I'm glad I checked. So this is Marcelo Tez.
00:47:38.344 - 00:48:01.324, Speaker A: And continuing on, green ginger, sunset cityscape. So another one by green ginger. Again, taking that 45 degree angle, using the city or buildings as a subject. Interesting treatment of the sunset here. And then contrasting it with this big margin, similar to Michael Macasso on the margin. Similar kind of mindset here. Very interesting.
00:48:01.324 - 00:48:20.984, Speaker A: Sunset cityscape, available for two tezos or tezos 80. And a new work from everything burns. And the name of the artist is Gulche Kuder. This is an edition of 99 for one tazos. So now the bad is on fire. After we saw the coffee maker and other things. And a new one from pixology.
00:48:20.984 - 00:48:56.560, Speaker A: Kind of a wild serpentine. Again, playing with what looks like an ancient egyptian theme, but not necessarily. And snakes and everything. So just kind of really original, kind of wild pixel artwork. So interesting frames there, too, right? Interesting frame. Continuing on, made on aseprite, Koda Nakazono continues to dazzle with these spectacular works here. And I'll show you my favorite part, which are, again, these big chunky pixels in the background contrasting with everything.
00:48:56.560 - 00:49:12.092, Speaker A: Like it just kind of seals the deal there for me. Even these green and everything. Let's see what happened here. Sold out, I believe, on primary at how much. Look at all this. Wow. There's a bit of the flippers are battling here.
00:49:12.092 - 00:49:26.184, Speaker A: They've bargained themselves down. This is. It's almost ridiculous. So Koda sold this for five tezos. And then you see the flippers here, tuna. They're desperately. How much time are you guys spending here? This is ridiculous.
00:49:26.184 - 00:49:45.554, Speaker A: Sometimes these things become an ego battle at the end of the day, it's kind of looking that way. Anyways. Whatever. As long as people are having fun, art is being sold, art is being bought, all is well. Continuum number 51. Another one by Kodak Nakazono. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful work here.
00:49:45.554 - 00:50:02.310, Speaker A: So this is. Yeah, continuum number 51. This looks older. So maybe this was just listed here, edition of eleven. And yeah, this might have just been listed. The new notifications on objects sometimes throw me off, but sometimes it's nice to go back here anyways. So interesting.
00:50:02.310 - 00:50:15.886, Speaker A: This is an interesting work as well by Zach Lloyd. Spill. Let me hit play here. See if there's any volume. There is no volume. And we'll see if we can here. Let's start this here.
00:50:15.886 - 00:50:40.110, Speaker A: So you get the picture. Very flashy, a lot of flashing. So just kind of an interesting work here. Spill noise, analog occult glitch. So kind of glitchy. This was a really interesting one. So Kiro ETH, this is in Kiro's space that Kiro sent to me called friendly integration.
00:50:40.110 - 00:50:57.710, Speaker A: This is on foundation world. It's a foundation world. And this is space waves by Christoph Gromer. So I took a look and found some pretty cool works here. This is being bid on. I left the one in Twitter, the Gif, because it loads up a little easier here. But you get the picture and there are others.
00:50:57.710 - 00:51:12.994, Speaker A: We'll see if this one loads up. This is also in that same space, which we're going to take a look at here. Yeah. So there you go. Pretty interesting work. I mean, we'll have to take a look at how this was made. Right? So basically a happy face here.
00:51:12.994 - 00:51:38.762, Speaker A: 30 frames per second, 1080 by 1080. No real details on how this was made, but it looks like some sort of 3d rendering of some kind. And of continuing on as we run through the rest of this here, another really interesting artist who's in this series. Kind of a glitchy, pixelated. Let me see if we can get this working. Spider Albiquero. I don't know if it's going to load up here also from that space.
00:51:38.762 - 00:51:51.054, Speaker A: So here we go. So kind of a glitchy work here. Pretty interesting. Again, Spider Al B. Kiro. Mysterious title, no description. This is by e boy.
00:51:51.054 - 00:52:10.818, Speaker A: Interesting. And here is the world. Love this work in the background here too. All these old controllers, spagels, maskinen. So kind of a showcasing here is what seems to be going on. Dan control. I mean, I was looking at these spaces being a part of Lego Joe, Lego Geos or Lego Joes.
00:52:10.818 - 00:52:41.182, Speaker A: And it looks like you can actually, if you own works, you can list anything. Like, I think in theory you could list your collection and curate your own collection as a space. I've never done it, but that was sort of, as I went through the process, that was sort of the impression I was getting. And this work, which I was very tempted to start with, but I've shown I've started with Eizo at least once or twice already. This is a spectacular work here. This captures the spirit of the season here. And this beautiful, beautiful work here.
00:52:41.182 - 00:52:54.804, Speaker A: And beautiful color of this barbecue. I'm all over it. Future patio grill. I bought one for five tazos. Still available on primary. Shockingly, there are still 15 left. Continuing on, stella particula.
00:52:54.804 - 00:53:30.194, Speaker A: Interesting work here. Very art. Sort of arty work here. I can only play 30 seconds here, but you get the picture. So pretty, pretty awesome. Stella particula edition of ten. Let's just see what this went for.
00:53:30.194 - 00:53:50.460, Speaker A: 45 tezos. So this is on spagels Maskinen Strano. So yeah, so there are six left. So not cheap, but probably like interesting artist who I'm not sure I've ever seen before. Give Stella a follow. Yeah, so, I mean, there's. It's just endless.
00:53:50.460 - 00:54:14.584, Speaker A: And like, pretty interesting work here. So I'm gonna have to take a very closer look at that and follow what's going on with Stella Somfe Zeitgeist. So another really interesting. I don't know if you'd call it glitch. But video artist with what seems to be some glitch effects here. And this is a machine that, I'm not sure what it is. This is a famous sort of machine here.
00:54:14.584 - 00:54:50.486, Speaker A: Yeah. I don't see what it's called, though. So, anyways, using a whole bunch of hardware here, and, yeah, so I think we could call that glitch, but, yeah, now I'm not even sure anymore what AI and glitch could do together. Let's see if there's volume. So tuques with an interesting, dynamic work here. So continuing to push took's own boundaries, interestingly so. Again, maybe that's what we're seeing here as well, is as the market relaxes a little bit, maybe with that comes more experimentation.
00:54:50.486 - 00:55:08.550, Speaker A: Sky Goodman with a very interesting piece. We'll look at the title in a second here. It has a great title, by the way, so very interesting work. What is it called? The life of objects. I love it. A beautiful title here. The life of objects.
00:55:08.550 - 00:55:24.286, Speaker A: That sounds like an awesome book. And then here, so interesting stuff going on here. Interesting experimentation. Almost look like mirrors textured with images made with code, video feedback and synthesis. Seamless loop. One of one. We'll just see if it's sold.
00:55:24.286 - 00:55:44.792, Speaker A: Just minted. Not listed. Marina Amidova, everlasting feminine composition number eight. So another work from that series. So another AI work using a lot of circles and flowers that look great. AI artist Marina Amidova, 2023. And doctor Nadler with an interesting piece here, tangled tempers.
00:55:44.792 - 00:56:13.456, Speaker A: One, the collector turned artist who was doing very well. He was showing at, I think, expanded art here in Berlin in January or February when I went to the gallery there. Anyways, so more AI from Dernadler does a lot of this kind of double head theme. So anyways, very interesting. Let's just see if anything happened. Burned. So maybe there's a new version of this strange thing with some beaut.
00:56:13.456 - 00:56:31.646, Speaker A: Another beautiful, incredible slideshow from strange thing. So more what? I loved what they called it, speculative fashion. More speculative fashion. AI peasantry inspired footwear inspired by the Renaissance period. Which one would you buy? So interesting write up. Look at these. Great.
00:56:31.646 - 00:57:01.056, Speaker A: I love the asymmetry. Doesn't that just feel like it's from the future, where one shoe is one way and the other shoe is another way? Again, we're peeking into the future here, courtesy of strange things, and where that could almost become the norm, where everybody has asymmetrical shoes. Perhaps more stunning color here too. Okay, more just across the board. Stunning. Stunning color has always been good with the palette. There so, yeah, so very interesting shout out to.
00:57:01.056 - 00:57:17.644, Speaker A: Strange thing for picking up, actually, that Sotheby's ad number two on secondary for 25 tezos. That was great. So anyways, look at this. Almost looks like duct tape, but not quite. Maybe it's a zipper. So anyways, we can't go too long here. Look at this.
00:57:17.644 - 00:57:48.724, Speaker A: So the power of AI put into experienced hands here. And Pauli Jojo with a few takes on the pope. So the pope returns in this episode, maybe with a phone and a big jacket here, puffer jacket, as they say, and big glamorous sunglasses. Vatican drip two. A one of one, which is only 250. And another one of one by Pauly Jojo. Vatican drip three, also pretty like.
00:57:48.724 - 00:58:08.180, Speaker A: So, yeah, so very cool work here. AI and Photoshop. And another plasticine work. This time a tez noun from Yoao Salazar. A physical piece that gave rise to the gif for Tez nouns. So I guess this was the source for a gif for Tez nouns. Very, very cool.
00:58:08.180 - 00:58:34.856, Speaker A: And also from Yoao Salazar. This interesting thing here, DBY club is proud to announce Salazar Yoao as a DBY club pass artist. So I've just never heard of this. We're very grateful you believe in our mission and support this movement. I've never heard of this, so I thought it was kind of cool. The DBY club passed artists reveal. So Yoao Salazar is involved.
00:58:34.856 - 00:58:49.414, Speaker A: And that is your show, everyone, just under an hour. We're gonna shorten them next week, after I get back next week. So thank you for joining me again, and we'll see if the music plays. Thank you for joining me again. Until next time, take care.
