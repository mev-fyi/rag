00:00:04.840 - 00:00:38.305, Speaker A: It continues, my friends, as we begin a new week here. Incredible amount of incredible art has been crossing my desk here fabulously, and I can't wait to share it with you. Artist Journal September 30, 2024. Searching for new ways of thinking, new aesthetics, new categories. What will happen this show? I often ask myself as I drink the coffee before turning pressing record. So welcome back. We have this awesome work here.
00:00:38.305 - 00:01:00.647, Speaker A: A series of good decisions is what I kind of feel. How I feel about this from my perspective over here. So many great decisions were made making this piece overall concept awesome. And let me show you the title. Local Art scene group creative critique session. So this is by Salowaki, who often has, I'd say, pretty. A lot of humor in the work.
00:01:00.647 - 00:01:38.655, Speaker A: The trout is kind of part of that humor, even maybe the interesting kind of shirt over the head. There is Salowaki the figure or at least the character who is often in the work discussing the work. And as she says here, the only ants in my house listen to me talk about my art. Only the ants in my house listen to me talk about the art. Though I'm told they can't truly appreciate it, they are blind. This is my local art scene, my own bubble. So there is Salowaki busily trying to explain to the ants that are looking on here what is going on in this beautifully framed trout.
00:01:38.655 - 00:01:55.293, Speaker A: I. I even love how it's just this simple trout here in a, you know, almost like a scientific rendition of a trout. So many good decisions. The red frame, beautiful even. We're gonna see. I'll show you. Let me show you something.
00:01:55.293 - 00:02:14.933, Speaker A: Another great decision here. This was like the work in progress sneak peek of the one of one work we'll be listing today. And there you see, it was a red shirt, I think. Nice move. Even the ants were brown before. And then Salowaki, look, they're black and brown here. Great decisions turning the shirt white.
00:02:14.933 - 00:02:35.899, Speaker A: It's a really, really nice work. And even the way it was sold as a one of one good idea and it did really well. 169 tezos. So rewarded by the market. Really nice kind of bidding going on here. Absurd deity Chris War Ahek, who we're going to hear from shortly. Sabato and Mikel Knowlson.
00:02:35.899 - 00:03:18.347, Speaker A: 169 Tezos, which is $125 for Salowecki's beautiful work of this GLB made using Blender. Remember, Marietta also uses blender. I think we're going to see Martin Jo with a hilarious work later in the show using blender so very cool, you know, digital sculpture, so to speak. Virtual sculpture. I remember there was someone who was saying who I was talking to maybe, gosh, maybe six months ago, I think it was late spring, who was saying there. Once the Apple Vision Pro came out, they decided they were going to speculate on digital sculptures because this is going to be the next big thing. Oh, that was hilarious.
00:03:18.347 - 00:03:52.875, Speaker A: Maybe it will be. So who knows? And what would this look like in Apple Vision Pro? They're always a little hard to navigate sometimes when you get off center here. But here we go. So just a great work, hilarious work and kind of a mirror of kind of the show to a certain degree. So really cool work by Salowacki to get us started here on a Monday at the beginning of a week. Big show today, sorry, on Wednesday, Mumble Boy on collagen digital art. This should be awesome.
00:03:52.875 - 00:04:20.965, Speaker A: Really looking forward to doing that. They actually did a bit of a warm up show yesterday and of course I follow Santiago. You know, I was looking at this poster though that they put together even the title World Talk with Mumble Boy. Little Cakes in Santiago. I don't know if they plan on doing this again. Like Mumbleboy messaged me who I guess doesn't talk about his art very much. So I guess they did a bit of a show here last night.
00:04:20.965 - 00:04:45.393, Speaker A: This is a great, like I'm excited by like this should be a show is what I'm saying. World Talk. And then you have like three cool digital artists on from around the world. 9pm in Uruguay, 9pm in Japan. I mean this is. How cool was that? People responded pretty favorably as well. So very cool there.
00:04:45.393 - 00:05:10.015, Speaker A: So Mumble Boy is gonna be on again on Wednesday. So that should be rad in New York for a couple of decades at least. Or was in New York. Not sure. We'll get the deets. All the details on this next on this Wednesday's show. So that is coming up and that is on the X feed and that is on X Comments show Eco Textile Studio.
00:05:10.015 - 00:05:34.415, Speaker A: So now this is relating, I think to the Whitney. Just to give you some context here. Many professional artists use some kind of link tree to direct their audience to various platforms. It's a subtle form of advertising. Maybe some traditional galleries haven't found a new way to advertise. In fact, I don't think there was ever in history such a need for this upgrade in the field of advertising. Physical art.
00:05:34.415 - 00:06:12.375, Speaker A: Let's finish. Maybe physical museums and galleries need a new form of advertising. It looks to me this may be the issue for the YouTube Whitney Museum of America. Yes, we're noting last show, how quiet the Whitney's YouTube channel was, like couple of hundred views. And I was mentioning it to show there didn't seem to be a lot of enthusiasm going on. Interestingly, I went to moma just out of curiosity, like today, I think it was earlier this morning, maybe last night, and there were thousands like so moma. But I mean, but Whitney's a bit more, as they say in their mission, it's a bit more contemporary.
00:06:12.375 - 00:06:38.115, Speaker A: They try and do living people, but they'll also have the huge Warhol show, but they try and make it contemporary, so to speak, or last 50 years, let's call it. So anyways, all interesting. Yeah, so just interesting. I see the lack of digital art in traditional regional gallery systems is a concerning issue. It's very interesting. It's very interesting. That shouldn't happen.
00:06:38.115 - 00:07:13.235, Speaker A: I'm about to launch an academic paper to address just that in the form of a temporary solution. By all means, feel free to share, send me the link or post in the community. I'll happily bring it up on the show. Because of the resistance, because of the resistance against digital art by ordinary audiences all around the world. It is an interesting thing. Like what we look at here in the bubble, you know, in our bubble here is largely, I would say it's very small. Like, I think it has global accessibility.
00:07:13.235 - 00:07:49.765, Speaker A: I don't think it needs to be small, but I think just looking at the number of collectors and the amount of familiar faces here and everything, it feels still surprisingly local, shall we say. To quote Salowaki on the local critique there, Adrian is right in questioning data. It's important to question so. And then so, okay, so I think this is a artist. Programmers have the means to create a new wave of promoting physical and digital art. We can and should lead a new way for the promotion of art and integration of systems. It costs so much, though.
00:07:49.765 - 00:08:29.249, Speaker A: Yeah, it's interesting. What I love about what's going on right now is there is. I'm excited about this movement which, and I've mentioned it many times, but just to summarize the point, it's very free market and I feel like this is almost an inoculation, a cultural inoculation against what I would argue is a very tightly controlled contemporary art scene that we've seen for the last, I don't know, since the 80s. Right. Very controlled. It feels. At least that's how it feels.
00:08:29.249 - 00:09:09.515, Speaker A: Right. A lot of gatekeepers and so all of a sudden with, you know, really with Tezos especially. But you could say with the blockchain, but that wasn't accessible to everybody because of cost. But what happened with Tezos in 2020, 2021, when hen was launched, I guess that was 2021 then. It wasn't expensive. It cost a couple of pennies. So then people from all around the world could then mint their work and sell their work on a credible platform and in a free market where there were basically no gatekeepers, you can get on X or Twitter at the time and go and market yourself and build an audience for yourself.
00:09:09.515 - 00:09:53.495, Speaker A: And to a certain degree, there is nothing in there that felt like you could say this wasn't credible. Like in the same way that you might with, you know, Walk sells art on ebay. But I'd say for most people it's kind of a hard, like, is this a credible way? Walk does it credibly and is like it's part of the almost the manifesto, so to speak, of Walk and this almost. You see it in the pricing of his work. I'm going to put it for auction of one at one Tezos and whatever happens, happens. Right. So with Walk, we're kind of getting a special case, I'd argue, of someone who's very conscious of how things are being sold as part of this kind of Internet artists.
00:09:53.495 - 00:10:06.121, Speaker A: Right. Internet artists idea. Anyways, thank you for the program and thank you for the. Yeah, right. And question. Data. We should.
00:10:06.121 - 00:10:18.753, Speaker A: And it is just data. Right. So we can make of it whatever we want. People can make of it whatever we want. Let's continue. I find the lack of engagement with The Whitney Museum YouTube channel Interesting. I believe there's a reason why.
00:10:18.753 - 00:10:31.861, Speaker A: But we're not allowed to talk about it on YouTube. So. Interesting. Kind of mysterious here. I guess we could speculate on that. But let's put it this way, it is interesting. As we were just noting here.
00:10:31.861 - 00:11:02.261, Speaker A: I like. I mean it was surprising. Like maybe they just don't promote it ever and maybe they don't have a link on their website and maybe it's kind of a secondary thing. Like, okay, we'll upload some videos. But remarkable for such a famous New York institution, art institution of the Whitney's, you know, a global brand, a little surprising. As we were noting. Ah, heck, no need to tear down the larger established contemporary art world to uplift the digital arts genre.
00:11:02.261 - 00:11:39.535, Speaker A: Nor reduce the masterful work of Rafiq Anadal. And landmark announcements of Ras Dataland featured in a new Frank Gehry development. Arguably the greatest living architect that is A controversial statement. Lots of controversy around all of this contemporary art discussion. So let me just start with. Because this is the premise that the whole comment is built on. I don't think either myself or Sabato, also, I don't think either of us were tearing down the larger, established contemporary art world.
00:11:39.535 - 00:12:09.637, Speaker A: I kind of come out of it to a certain degree. To a certain degree, as I've mentioned in the past, who are my biggest influences or my favorite artists? It's like John Baldessari, you know, late Richard Prince. I think we could call that contemporary art. So I don't think we were, you know, saying this. You know, I would hope you'd give us more. Me more credit than saying that. Suggesting that I would say that this all sucks.
00:12:09.637 - 00:13:00.405, Speaker A: You know, that I'm doing one of those things. As I've mentioned many times in the past here, I consider it almost bad form to say, like, an artist sucks or, you know, to go and like, you know, as Jerry Saltz did with Rafika Anadol, calling it the screensaver and just kind of like this WWF sort of style way of doing art criticism. Especially in Jerry Saltz's case, who's. Where's his art? You know, so with very little in, you know, a lot of people give him a ton of credibility. I say, with what credibility does Jerry Salt speak when he throws these rocks at other people's work? Who. You know, there's something to be said for understanding what it is to bear your soul out there and put it out for. Basically for public consumption, discussion and critique and.
00:13:00.405 - 00:13:26.391, Speaker A: And then, you know, and then see the challenges of making an artwork and everything and then coming back and then so. And as someone who does do that myself, putting out work for critique and to be discussed and to be seen, I'm very reluctant to go and start, like, throwing rocks at other people's work. Right. And it's just, again, I just think it's bad form. It's. It's not the classiest thing. It is kind of like WWF wrestling.
00:13:26.391 - 00:13:57.091, Speaker A: It's not the classiest kind of approach. So, yeah, so there was no. I think this is kind of a straw dog or a straw man argument. I don't think this is true. I don't think we were tearing down contemporary art. We were saying, just finally on this, and then we'll continue the comment. What I was saying was we were pointing out prominent contemporary art people, commentators who are saying it's out of energy.
00:13:57.091 - 00:14:48.101, Speaker A: We're pointing out that the market is. We're going to see Another article here is kind of like the bottom is falling out of it for many of the artists, not all of them. So are we just going to say, no, this is the greatest thing ever and bury our heads in the sand? Like, I mean, should I not talk about it and say, you know, and I agree with the commentators and I would say, like, you know, I've felt this way for a long time. It's out of energy again. When you go to too many of these art fairs that you go to, you see this almost like, remember we're hearing about Frederick Jameson and combinationism, I think they're calling it, where it's like, oh, it's all been done. So now it's just about combination. And I was actually saying there's a virtue in that because it's kind of how technology moves forward, but it's also just shows that there's this exhaustion of ideas.
00:14:48.101 - 00:15:09.197, Speaker A: And why gave a very straightforward explanation. Because it's not adopting the new technology, which is basically what art is. Are these kind of inventive image making technologies. Right, so. So yeah, so I think this is very over. Way too oversimplified here. And it was.
00:15:09.197 - 00:15:48.543, Speaker A: Yeah. And to uplift, like, I mean, so you wound me, Joshua, you wound me here. But let's continue. All of the artists you mentioned will have their day in the sun. But no need to compare here as it downplays the significance of this news for AI art en masse. So referring to Rafika Anadol, my point with Rafiq Anadal, again, I don't think I tore down his work. What I said was the establishment, as they like to do, you know, whether it's the art media or the museums, it's like, where it's like, okay, Rafiq Anadol is the be all, end all of AI art.
00:15:48.543 - 00:16:22.605, Speaker A: And we don't need to listen to anybody else or talk about anybody else's work. And it is just a given. It is a constant in our thinking that Rafiq Anadol is the greatest AI artist in the world. And that's. And is the determiner of all things AI art. And this is basically what's being pushed, I would argue, as a narrative. And I think it's completely legitimate to point it out and to question that and say, well, is this true? And that's not to say that Rafiki Anadol's work is bad.
00:16:22.605 - 00:16:48.071, Speaker A: Like, who said that? Again, that would be in bad taste. I don't think that helps me. I don't think, like, from a purely pragmatic Level, I don't think that it's not a good look, whatever. Like, again, so. And I've criticized, you know, pretty strongly Jerry Saltz in the past, you know, 150 episodes ago or whenever that was for that very thing. Again, it's not a. You know, it's bad for.
00:16:48.071 - 00:17:17.443, Speaker A: In my opinion. So that wasn't being done. And I think it's debatable because now, again, I think it's fine in a sense, it's whatever. Because as long as there's a free market going on over here on the blockchain, as long as that exists, I don't really care because that. That will sort. That will have its own narrative and so which will hopefully. Which will keep these artists making art, which is maybe the most important thing.
00:17:17.443 - 00:17:50.329, Speaker A: And so that AI art also develops. And it's not just like, oh, you're going to be left out in the cold because you're not recognized by XYZ Art magazine or XYZ Gallery that you have no connections to in the Amazon forests in Peru. Right. So let's continue. I also completely and wholeheartedly disagree with you and Sabato. The greater budding contemporary art world is electric and more inspiring than ever. So, yeah, I think there we are kind of disagreed.
00:17:50.329 - 00:18:34.669, Speaker A: And I think that's okay to be disagree. To disagree on that again, sort of like what those commentators were saying. And maybe this helps kind of clarify the earlier lines here that we were discussing. I thought it was very observant of one of those commentators who said, is basically contemporary art kind of like a movement, like any other, in a sense, as I was saying in an earlier episode, is contemporary art the new modern art? Is contemporary art the new modern art. And what I mean by that is, is it just like a movement that kind of. It happens and then it kind of ends. Right.
00:18:34.669 - 00:18:58.433, Speaker A: And then there's a postmodern art or other stuff, Pop art, Abstract Expressionism. Is that. I guess that's abstract. Abstract Expressionism was probably the pinnacle, or not the pinnacle, the end state, one could argue, of modernism, because I'd argue pop, you start to get into. Starting to feel a bit more postmodern media, landscape, irony, you know, all that stuff. Right. Appropriation.
00:18:58.433 - 00:19:25.075, Speaker A: Right. So it's almost like, I think if you had to put like divider, if you were forced to, I'd sort of say where Abstract expressionism and pop, although of course, Warhol used, as well as Jasper Johns and other Rauschenberg, they incorporated a lot of lessons from Abstract Expressionism. Paint drips and all this sort of thing. So the. Almost the flattening of the canvas. Right. So, yes, let's continue.
00:19:25.075 - 00:20:22.347, Speaker A: So disagree. Yeah. So, I mean, I'm sure we could say it depends on the show. Like, as people just finally on this, like, you know, as I've said here before, like, if you asked me who my favorite artist was before I, like, you know, started going very digital here or like where before the blockchain, I was already very digital, but before I got into the blockchain, where all of a sudden I was just before I discovered really the. What I'd call is this visual arts underground, this digital art revolution that's happening largely on Tezos, but across the blockchain. If you ask me who my favorite artist was, I'd say John Baldassari, where I saw an incredible show in Buenos Aires, where, I mean, I was almost giving people tours that I was, you know, going on visiting the museum with. I was like, well, this is incredible because of XYZ as well as, like, Richard Prince, who.
00:20:22.347 - 00:21:13.597, Speaker A: I'm not like, huge on the early work. I'm kind of ambivalent, neutral. But the later work, again, very similar in a sense process to Baldassarre Inkjet using printers, very kind of iconic iconography, using a lot of iconography, really emphasizing and focusing on the mediums and traveling through different mediums, magnification, and how all of these things kind of interact and can be manipulated, so to speak, to represent the culture to us in a way where we can kind of see it with new eyes. When you see the magazine, things kind of blown up. And also there's a visual thinking at work. Right. So it's not that I'm not inspired by individual artists at all.
00:21:13.597 - 00:21:53.943, Speaker A: In fact, they're incredibly inspiring. But I do think, as a general to when you start isolating and identifying themes, what you might call essential characteristics of contemporary art. And when you do go to many of these shows, I think, you know, you start to go like, it's not all good in the. In the sense of too many times you leave and you just think, like, that did absolutely nothing for me. And we have to be able to say this without it being insulting. We're not talking about any individuals here. And I think, frankly, a lot of the people in the contemporary art scene would agree.
00:21:53.943 - 00:22:38.305, Speaker A: I'll never forget, and I don't want to go too long on this. We're only halfway through the comment, but I'll never forget. You know, six months after moving to Berlin from Canada, I went to a talk at Spike magazine used to give talks in close to the Volkspuna there at Rosa Luxembourg Platz. And that was one of the first things I started going to. And there was, you know, a curator from Tate. There was a curator from another institution. And the curator from Tate had a whole bunch of problems because he was going to the Volkspoon and actually ended up resigning after six months because the pushback on him coming in with his neoliberal policies was too strong, you know, And I'll never forget, though, but.
00:22:38.305 - 00:23:20.091, Speaker A: Because at that thing, it was like, does the white cube still matter? And then there was so much of this kind of, like, what I called bubble talk that I actually stood up and I was like, you know, like, this is, you know, bubble talk. This is. This is boring. You know, I'm going to these shows, like, what are you guys talking about? And it was one of my greatest moments, actually. And my point is, though, was while I was having this discussion, you know, the guy beside me is elbowing me and going, yeah, man, you're totally right. The girl and the woman in front of me, who ended up seeing for a couple of weeks after that, hilariously turns behind me and says, you're totally right. During this argument.
00:23:20.091 - 00:23:44.865, Speaker A: Kind of a similar argument to this, right? And then when I look over at the crowd, and I was like, am I wrong? And people are like, no. Like, I saw all these people going, no, man. You know, so, you know. And finally, actually, I shouldn't even say this part. The curator from a prominent institution who was not named at the end was like, well, I'm on back medication. So I can't argue this. It was an utter defeat.
00:23:44.865 - 00:24:10.245, Speaker A: It was one of so all to say people inside the contemporary art scene probably agree with this, you know, as. And it's just like. And just finally on this point, I was out on Thursday with my friend, and he's like. We go to the show and he's been going to. He's been an artist forever. He's been going to shows forever. And he's like, I just don't get it, you know, but it's probably just me.
00:24:10.245 - 00:24:35.205, Speaker A: And that's what so many people think. And it's like, I. I'm at the point where it's like, I don't think it's you. You know, like, can we just call a spade a spade? That wasn't the greatest show we've ever seen, right? So anyways, and then here we get some wonderful artists. I actually looked up a lot of these, Josh. And there are some wonderful artists. I'm not excited by everything, but really, I'll have to look at.
00:24:35.205 - 00:24:58.665, Speaker A: You could almost do a show on these artists. Maybe you should do a show on these artists is actually what should probably happen. Because it'd probably be super good. There were some really impressive works here. The works in an exhibition of all of these people who I'm not going to name, but they're listed here if you want to see. Great list of contemporary artists here. Josh has been doing the research and is generously sharing them here.
00:24:58.665 - 00:25:12.377, Speaker A: Like, take advantage of this. I could keep going. Yes. I have a list. I spend all my free time in the museums and galleries. And just because 88% of what is seen doesn't directly connect shouldn't dissuade you from seeking out the works that transcend. Yeah.
00:25:12.377 - 00:25:28.195, Speaker A: You can say the same thing of art on the blockchain. Right. So, of course, you know, but it is remarkable. You know, it is about 88% is about right. You know, it's about right. It just triggers me to reduce it all as dead. Yeah.
00:25:28.195 - 00:26:06.703, Speaker A: And I think the spirit of the conversation was it kind of. I would argue it kind of is dead in the sense or it's dying. It may have already died. Like, and I'm not saying that, as I say, like, I may have a small ax to grind on that because I do feel to a certain degree the general public has been disenfranchised by a overly pretentious contemporary art scene that's acting and, you know, that's acting like things are more important than they are, but they actually don't know what they're talking about. Kind of a vapid scene. I mean, this is what I'd say is self evident. Like, it's just obvious to anybody who's spent time in it.
00:26:06.703 - 00:26:45.151, Speaker A: So I just think that that thing is starting to come to an end. And you know what's really kind of sealing the deal and what's actually. Because what's been supporting that scene? Why is that scene not dead yet? Right. Or hadn't been dead till recently? I would argue because the market continued to support it. The market continued to support it. So I could be like, oh, well, that scene's out of ideas. But if it's still selling for a million bucks for that thing, it's like, well, Adrian, you know, what are you going to say to that? You know, people are willing to spend a million bucks, so who cares now? And we have another article here trying to keep this.
00:26:45.151 - 00:27:18.735, Speaker A: I'll try and wrap this up Here. But now we're seeing the bottom is start. It's starting to crater. The bottom is falling out of this contemporary art scene in large degree, there are exceptions, and that in itself is interesting. And that's, you know. And why are there those exceptions? I would say because some works still resonate and people still see value there, but other works, people are panicking and going, oh, no, I just bought. I just spent 150,000 on something, or a million dollars on something that really I can't even get like $10,000 for anymore.
00:27:18.735 - 00:27:46.573, Speaker A: Right. I was convinced by some art consultant, really. Not because I was going with my gut of what I like, but just getting caught up and maybe speculating. And so again, I don't think we said. I'm saying as a movement, it seems to be ending. And I think the market is actually supporting it as well as some of the most prominent critics in contemporary art are also observing it. So I didn't start this discussion.
00:27:46.573 - 00:28:32.511, Speaker A: They did. And I think it's. But I agree and I've been kind of like. And I felt that way for a long time as far as the ideas, again, when I go to the, the, you know, when I go to the art fairs so often I feel like I'm seeing the discussion between the artist and the professor, you know, and like, what does that say? Right? I mean, and again, as the. As they were saying quite brutally, those commentators, much more brutally than I am, but they're pointing it out, you know, these basically rich kid MFA students, you know, and as I'm saying, like, it's basically what it looks like, you know, and as I say, nothing against being rich. There's nothing wrong with that, you know, I aspire to be rich, you know, but I'm just saying, like, it just is what it is to a certain degree. And maybe it's wrong and maybe you're right.
00:28:32.511 - 00:29:05.541, Speaker A: Like, these are just opinions. Like, maybe, maybe it's going to keep flourishing and it's at its best that it's ever been. So who knows? It just triggers me to reduce it all as dead and unfair to say contemporary art isn't the most exciting it's ever been. Digital Arts Underground is the most certain, is most certainly included. But let's not lose sight of the wealth of inspiration at our fingertips. So, yeah, I mean, I think no one's saying we should. I show physical art here all the time.
00:29:05.541 - 00:29:29.941, Speaker A: But I would say one final thing on this. Look at. It's not gallery. Like, I celebrate that gallery. Like, that gallery is important, like, culturally Speaking, they are really bringing in the new generation of art that's got humor, a lot of humor. It's got a kind of different kind of irony. Almost like this millennial or even younger irony.
00:29:29.941 - 00:29:57.925, Speaker A: There's like, almost like a tick tock humor to it. I'm back to the humor. There's the airbrush thing going on. That's really like, if you're talking about contemporary painting, that's why I show so much of it. That's where the action is. As far as I'd say today, this kind of overly serious, you know, there's sure there's a place for that. But I'm just saying, like as a movement, as a thing, if that's how we're going to think of it, which is how I think we should think of it.
00:29:57.925 - 00:30:15.449, Speaker A: History is our guide with modern art. They probably thought modern art. Like, how can there ever be anything after modern art? It's modern art. Well, there's postmodern art. And after postmodern art, what are we going to do? Oh, now it's contemporary art. And maybe that's just going to be one more movement. Right, let's continue.
00:30:15.449 - 00:30:34.441, Speaker A: Thank you for the comment, Josh. Very interesting. And I tell you, this list right here, my friends, is worth a lot of money. There's a lot of value here, so take advantage. Thank you again for the comment, Cider. Awesome episode, brother. And thank you for the appearance, as always.
00:30:34.441 - 00:31:01.375, Speaker A: Yeah, awesome to hear from you, Cider. Unfortunately, Art of the Millennium website does not support images higher than 1 megabyte. So if anybody wants to check full details, I recommend going to the actual NFT link on Super Rare Foundation. Anyway, much love, Poco Cider. Awesome to hear from you, Cider. Big fan of cider's work and I can relate to this. Like, I put a workup on Bitcoin TR505 and it's like, maybe I can.
00:31:01.375 - 00:31:23.041, Speaker A: Shall I dare. Let's see, let's see if this brings up my page. It does. So I upload this work and here it is. And then I can relate to this issue of like. And then it shows it like this, you know, and you put all this work in this piece. And then.
00:31:23.041 - 00:31:57.737, Speaker A: But this is how basically the work is, right? And here it's like a little bit because this is the original size. So it's kind of small, but you see like this is the work, but it gets turned into like this garbled thing. And yeah, so it's just I relate, I relate very much to the actual platform kind of in the thumbnail and just not getting your work seen. So yeah, something you got to do is actually just check the full details. Go to the actual original source file. If you're actually into an artist and collecting. Thank you for the comment, Pippa.
00:31:57.737 - 00:32:13.667, Speaker A: Universal Teeth is always inspiring in my life. Exclamation mark. Remembering the. Remembering the coffee with you and Marietta. Can't wait to do that again. I'm thinking probably realistically, I'm hoping maybe next September or October, November. Maybe October.
00:32:13.667 - 00:32:31.779, Speaker A: November next fall will be the time I can go back to Argentina. I would love to go and do that coffee again. Wish you were doing great. Hope you're doing great. Best of the dzeos from me to you. Bless just wonderful soul with PP there. Yo Salazar.
00:32:31.779 - 00:32:58.997, Speaker A: Thanks, fam. Unfortunately, access to X is still blocked here in Brazil. Being here is always an honor. Thank you and feel free to comment away. Yo is even if you're, you know, here's what I can do. Brazilian artists, I. I see it with some reservation, but basically, if you're in Brazil and you're putting out art, like, feel free to put a comment and saying, hey, got this going on.
00:32:58.997 - 00:33:33.291, Speaker A: And I might not read every single one of those, but feel free to put it in the comments. If you're just trying to get your work out there there and if there's not many, we can just go, okay, Y. If you have a new work, like, feel free to post it. Like, at least like, hey guys, I have a new work on foundation. And then post the link. I think I'll see those posts because it's really kind of distressing seeing what's going on with these Brazilian artists who are basically cut off from their collectors. I mean, it's really what's happened here with this deal on X.
00:33:33.291 - 00:34:06.215, Speaker A: Sabato, who of course I follow. I brought this up because I wanted to just show like, I don't think Sabato is also saying that it's all terrible. Yesterday, how to Be a Non became my most popular post on Tumblr. Makes me happy that the kids got so much appreciation for Hito Style. So kind of celebrating, I would argue, I think kind of almost doing a kind of pastiche of sorts with Hito Style's work or, you know, at least a homage of sorts to Hito Style. Beautiful piece here, by the way. How to Be an on.
00:34:06.215 - 00:34:26.312, Speaker A: So I just wanted to point that out, like. So yeah, let's continue. Comments on X. Rosatio, always love catching your show. It's packed with insights and sparks, a bunch of ideas. For me, that is the greatest thing that could happen here. I totally see the connection between techno and digital art, especially when it comes to sampling.
00:34:26.312 - 00:34:47.600, Speaker A: Indeed, it's a huge part of my process. Gathering samples is both super fun and a total headache at the same time. Indeed. I am just kind of working through myself how to organize things better so that you don't have things everywhere. It can be really overwhelming. So I totally relate and understand. Hasdrubalwaffle awesome to hear from you.
00:34:47.600 - 00:35:07.135, Speaker A: Thank you. Poco with regard to Schnoman, it's an old D paint browser doodle from last year. SH is the noise is the sound of noise. Purse lips and make the SH sound that is noise. SH indeed. Like waves hitting a beach or synthesize snares. So advanced commentary from Waffles here.
00:35:07.135 - 00:35:24.209, Speaker A: SH can also be shorthand for sh. Now this is a family program so I won't say that word, but you can read it. It is a choose your own adventure title. Hilarious and awesome to hear from you. Waffles. Believe we have a few more coming up this episode. Enigmatris thank you once again for including me in your journal.
00:35:24.209 - 00:35:51.093, Speaker A: Great to hear from you. Here's the original painting I worked with to create in search of more letters. How cool is that? So quite the transformation, isn't it, by this wonderful digital artist here at Eggmatras Recent discovery just last week. Beautiful. Great color by the way. I wonder how this would print? And how would you print it? Almost has a bit of a riso potential here. We're going to see some rezo actually in a few tabs here.
00:35:51.093 - 00:36:13.063, Speaker A: Let's continue. Absurd Deity Great show as always, Adrian. My comment today is actually on an older episode. 332. I'm working backward as far as I can listening to your older episodes as I scan object and X for more great art. Yeah, Absurd Deity is buying left, right and center from what I can tell here. In that episode you expressed how important it is for artists to link to the art.
00:36:13.063 - 00:36:59.345, Speaker A: I 100% agree. As a busy collector, indeed. As a busy collector with many in real life responsibilities as well as simply far too much great art to collect, I am simply not going to search for a link to art unless I am so overwhelmingly enchanted that I simply must have it rare. To be sure, in my humble opinion, artists need to ask themselves why are they posting on X at all? If it's just a share for the dopamine hit of getting hearts and likes and comments, then by all means fear the algo gun for reach and don't leave a link to your art. But if your goal is actually to have your art sold or collected, then make it easy for the collectors who do see your post to actually collect the art and post the link. Indeed, indeed. So I totally agree with that.
00:36:59.345 - 00:37:16.729, Speaker A: And I think actually just crystallized, actually brilliantly in words. Exactly. You know, are you after reach or are you after sales? And yeah, brilliantly put. Absurd deity. Couldn't agree more. Gelatin. Great episode.
00:37:16.729 - 00:37:26.995, Speaker A: Thank you. Great to hear from you. Segondo the artist. Why I've never seen an art show like this. I don't know how to call it even. Nice to meet you and thank you for following me. Well, thank you for the wonderful comment.
00:37:26.995 - 00:37:56.761, Speaker A: And you know, it's funny like, it's like in. In my universe, this is normal, this show, which is kind of funny. So it's awesome to hear. It's also a weird kind of organic growth because then people started watching it surprisingly. And so it's had this weird organic growth, I'd say mostly with the Tezos kind of ecosystem where they're really the people that really kind of started. And it was kind of. Finally it was kind of built off the object notifications because all of a sudden I could go and get my news feed in the morning.
00:37:56.761 - 00:38:23.215, Speaker A: It's like, okay, here's an easy way to get some stuff. Then I eventually the notifications weren't working, so then I went over to X and now I kind of. Then I went over to many blockchains, went multi chain as far as the show. And yeah, that was a decision too, right along with including pixel art and all those things. Anyways, thank you for the very nice comment there. Also a brilliant comparison between techno and digital art. Thank you, Mamadou.
00:38:23.215 - 00:38:58.125, Speaker A: I think it's important to define digital art crypto in its own new category with its own ecosystem separated from traditional norms. And the comparison you made is great. It is very analogous, isn't it, to techno even in terms of how techno relates to the rest of the tradition of music. Like it's kind of got its own kind of very punk energy. They tried to go, I was having a conversation yesterday with a guy who, a few years older than me. So he. It was like, you know, in the 90s, he was in like UK and kind of really a clubber back in the day.
00:38:58.125 - 00:39:31.525, Speaker A: And yeah, like we were both kind of commenting on how it was kind of funny around the 2000s when you saw Jeff Mills get bring in the Montpellier Orchestra and then Richie Haughton trying to go A little bit more kind of arty and how refreshing it is that that's not happening anymore. Kind of hilariously so. Anyways, hilarious and interesting. Glad you feel that way. Another vote in favor of the techno digital art comparison. In a way, when we compare it to techno, then you're a DJ playing in a virtual party. Indeed.
00:39:31.525 - 00:40:01.203, Speaker A: I think I've commented on this in the past. Like this is kind of your visual dj. I believe I've introduced a show with indeed kind of interesting Plastic Fantastic. When are you going to do digital art similar to Cytrance then? And it's hilarious. There's actually a wild I don't even know the name of the artist but there's someone I keep seeing on Instagram with these crazy like tunnels and everything. Super high res. Maybe you've seen them.
00:40:01.203 - 00:40:17.051, Speaker A: That's what I think of when I think of Cytrance. Anyways, let's continue. Thank you for the comment. Kiro Love this NUV 1914 piece. I actually tried to get it but was 5 Tazo short. Yeah, who can't relate to that? Totally. Tornado Rodriguez Drockpoko thanks for showing my work.
00:40:17.051 - 00:40:33.985, Speaker A: It means a lot to me. Absolute pleasure. Tornado out of Argentina. Curo Also awesome to hear from you and Marietta. Thanks Adrian, you're the best. And yes, you're right. Nomad Sculpt is an iPad tool for 3D sculpting that I love and use in projects along with Blender.
00:40:33.985 - 00:40:54.873, Speaker A: So multiple softwares here and yeah, this work was pretty special. I thought it would probably make a pretty good sculpture in real life. I don't know if this is ever done. How many people turn the GLBs? I suppose you could print them probably. I imagine like that's the software. You probably just plug in your GLB and tell them what materials you want. I don't know how it works.
00:40:54.873 - 00:41:09.795, Speaker A: Brain Dead Great to hear from you. Nuv. Awesome to hear from you. No hygiene awesome to hear from you. All these rad artists here. Hacken can clink. I highly recommend visiting foundation where you'll discover the works of many incredible artists in the Mixed Genesis exhibition.
00:41:09.795 - 00:41:26.935, Speaker A: Feel free to post in the community once a week is kind of the loose rule. Yen Lucas Magone the style is super beautiful. Techno beautiful. Pedro Jose Artist Journal Lily Illo awesome to hear from you. So just rad scene out here. Let's continue. Just some works in the community.
00:41:26.935 - 00:41:45.383, Speaker A: Psycho Futurist this was really cool. Another card for the Tarot series I'm doing. Trying to push a new card each day. Not Always possible. But mostly I think today is temperance. Thanks everyone for sharing and collecting and yeah, so pretty rad work here by psycho futurists. Have shown some of their work in the past.
00:41:45.383 - 00:41:58.161, Speaker A: Will continue to. So thank you for posting that and keeping it on the radar. Interesting pose here. Very interesting. Kind of reminds me of another sculpture I've seen. Interesting. The cups.
00:41:58.161 - 00:42:14.545, Speaker A: So pretty. Pretty cool looking tarot here. Nopala Tagal. Interesting drawing here. And so yeah, very beautiful. Interesting drawing. Kind of spray different brushes and illustration.
00:42:14.545 - 00:42:38.651, Speaker A: Very interesting. Skull takes Gods and Probabilities two frame GIF and audio track. Digital drawing over AI output. Yeah. Isn't this just kind of. To me this is like we see it with rj, right? And it's kind of like it's kind of always been the promised land, I would argue is this idea that you use it as the source. These compositions you gain on AI to just kind of.
00:42:38.651 - 00:43:05.245, Speaker A: And then you go from there and you take that extra two or three steps and then the world is your oyster, so to speak. Like then it just gets kind of crazy and we see how productive and prolific RJ is. You know when you start to kind of nail down that process. Sound synthesized on a chord. Volca. Drum and chord and a Volca. I guess that's a frequency modulation FM synth one Tazos so available there.
00:43:05.245 - 00:43:23.019, Speaker A: And there is your electronic music here. So cool work from Skull Takes. Thank you for posting that. Interesting piece. And finally I think here, let's go here. I think that was actually posted. Okay, let's go.
00:43:23.019 - 00:43:37.957, Speaker A: Speed up a bit here. Zizo. Thank you for posting. Kind of looks like AI but not sure for a contest and Tornado Rodriguez. So this is coming out today? I believe so. Thank you for posting. Beautiful object 98.
00:43:37.957 - 00:43:53.071, Speaker A: Microsoft Paint 98 works here. They're very popular and they sell really well. Flower PNG this by Ugo Digi. Interesting piece here. Nice textures. Very interesting with flower PNG in the petals. And this one actually is later in the show.
00:43:53.071 - 00:44:05.263, Speaker A: I have a new drop. I'll be honest, I'm for a healthy lifestyle, but I'm a little naughty. And perhaps that is the cigarette we're seeing here. Look at how cool this is though. This is very nice. I wonder. This is a photo of a physical work.
00:44:05.263 - 00:44:27.537, Speaker A: Very nice work from Ilya Berran Luke 500. You know they. So this was an interesting post here. They did not throw the soup just on one, but on both. Sunflower paints. Painting as the same day that two lady activists were sentenced to two years for a similar act in 2022 on the same painting. Yeah.
00:44:27.537 - 00:44:55.205, Speaker A: And you wonder about the frames because surely those are getting damaged here. So. Yeah, so it continues with the protests in the museums. You know, as I said in the comment, like, I mean, here you have this guy who suffered with mental illness and finally gets some glory. And I just don't think it's the best PR campaign. I think it's. I think it gets controversy, I think it gets attention, but I'm not sure it's the right kind of attention.
00:44:55.205 - 00:45:08.037, Speaker A: Right. So, yeah, I'm not sure the strategy. Yeah, not a huge fan of the strategy there. B. Shameless self promotion. And so here. So a video here, so you can check that out.
00:45:08.037 - 00:45:24.685, Speaker A: Looks kind of like AI video. So let's quickly scroll through that. So pretty cool. Music by Beadle Wise Ape so interesting. Thank you for posting that. And Psycho Futurist with another work sharing one piece. So another tarot piece as Psycho Futurist continues that tarot card series.
00:45:24.685 - 00:45:35.511, Speaker A: Zizo. Thank you for posting. And Zizo again. So try and do it once a week. Otherwise I'd say it almost. It's best if you just pick your favorite work. Post once a week.
00:45:35.511 - 00:45:48.327, Speaker A: I should put that in the rules, though. It's a reminder. And also, Austin, you just realized. Awesome. Very cool work on wood. Interestingly, paint and charcoal on mounted plyboard. Very cool.
00:45:48.327 - 00:46:01.437, Speaker A: And Zizo. Yeah, you see you over post and then it turns into. Then people aren't excited anymore. So I'll try and post once a week. It's better for you. And it's also about letting other people's works kind of shine too. Right.
00:46:01.437 - 00:46:21.741, Speaker A: So just pick your favorite work and post once a week. Rosatio. I need to put that in the instructions so we can experiment. So I brought this up, actually. So look at how cool this is, Rosatio. This is like also what it's all about there in the community. Look at this free software online.
00:46:21.741 - 00:46:33.581, Speaker A: I was testing it, I was trying it out. Very cool. Thank you for posting. Very useful tool. I actually need a tool like this. Like, it kind of solved a problem I had. Thank you for posting that.
00:46:33.581 - 00:46:53.191, Speaker A: And I actually brought it up. Texadelic. Thank you for posting. Also very cool Motorbike there and some outlines of people and Louis JPD we saw last time. I actually brought it up this episode. So here it is and you get started and there you have it. You see all these different ways of rendering things.
00:46:53.191 - 00:47:13.367, Speaker A: The gradient one, it does tend to get a little bit stuck on. So I'm not quite sure. Why you actually did back and then you go maybe to here. There's. Yeah. This one I think is digital or sorry pixelated. And look the pixel size, I think the pixel size thing I like the best ironically.
00:47:13.367 - 00:47:29.363, Speaker A: Just these little tools, little things. The control you have is pretty radical. So that's posted Tools app. It's posted in the community. Okay. Finally we get to more bear alert. So Katya Kazakhina the Art Detective Bear alert.
00:47:29.363 - 00:47:59.985, Speaker A: Auction prices for many artists are in freefall. But some emerging works climb higher at sales this week. Estimates were notably lower and some consignors took haircuts. So just a couple of things here. So there's the bear in the tree that Katya saw and she's wondering, you know, here we go. The global art trade finds itself in a bear market. Oops.
00:47:59.985 - 00:48:31.157, Speaker A: Following two vertiginous years unleashed by the pandemic when prices soared and investors feasted, key indicators have turned red. Consider some half year metrics. Total sales generated by Sotheby's, Christie's and Phillips were down 29%. The average price of an artwork sold at auction fell 26% to $27,000. Auction sales in the ultra contemporary segment declined 39%. So you're seeing again the market is starting to weigh in on this. And sales of art for $10 million or more.
00:48:31.157 - 00:48:57.875, Speaker A: It's sort of like live by the sword, die by the sword. If people, let's say like if the art media is going to justify an artwork as being good by the price, then you also have to. It's a double edged sword. Right. And sales for art over $10 million or more were down 30% you can find. I'm actually surprised it's that it's still doing that well because when sentiment shifts on something like this, it can really shift. Quote and here's a quote.
00:48:57.875 - 00:49:24.799, Speaker A: Financial markets are at an all time high, but people are super anxious and desperate to get out of all the art they bought. A collector told me this week. So you know, we were discussing season opening auctions in New York. Contemporary cured, post war present new now. Right. So yeah, maybe just a little more here. Estimates were very conservative across the board.
00:49:24.799 - 00:49:57.895, Speaker A: Works are priced to sell with no reserve lots appearing with no reserve lots appearing more frequently at Philips, anonymous sellers include the disgraced producer Scott Rudin. Christie's resume at sales. So are there any other kind of observations here and here one collector. The art market is bottoming out right now. So someone who's seen opportunities here. So interesting. So you're always going to get Divergent views here.
00:49:57.895 - 00:50:10.855, Speaker A: So. And here, just one more quote. What hasn't collapsed. An art advisor exclaimed when I pointed out these disappointing results. But there. And this is fascinating. I'm glad I found this.
00:50:10.855 - 00:50:49.165, Speaker A: But there were some bright spots at Phillips Works by Richard Prince, Theaster Gates and Alfred Leslie exceeded their high estimates. So there's kind of a winnowing out that's going on. I'd argue between the things that are seen to be, I would argue, standing the test of time and those that are thinking, okay, and the money talks in the sense, like it does say something. As I've long said here, it does say something. It's not everything because otherwise then people just put all the money in and then it's like, okay, that's the greatest person ever. Kind of a similar thing to what we saw with Beeple. I mean, people, why is Beeple considered the greatest digital artist? Because he's made a $69 million sale.
00:50:49.165 - 00:51:07.459, Speaker A: I mean, isn't that the reason? You know, like so. And maybe there's something to be said for that. I'm not saying there isn't. Right. But I mean, so the market has its. But it's not everything as I long have said here. But I think Richard Prince, to me, that says something like, oh, you know, quality quote unquote or stuff that is.
00:51:07.459 - 00:51:33.971, Speaker A: Has the perception that it will stand the test of time is doing great. It's sort of like Magritte is, I think, breaking records too. Interestingly, I think surrealist art has been long undervalued. And it's only in the last five or six years that it started to get the basically what it's valued at. What it should be valued at, I would argue. So, yeah, so I think we can leave it there. We've been here before and we'll be here again.
00:51:33.971 - 00:51:57.469, Speaker A: We've seen a huge move down. Perhaps like the bear, we reached the bottom. Let's hope we'll also have a soft landing. So it continues out there. Great story is over from Katya Kazakhina, the famous art detective Max Osiris. I see so much incredible, incredible art being sold for way too little and so much lame art being sold for way too much. So just another angle on this whole discussion.
00:51:57.469 - 00:52:09.549, Speaker A: Hashtag cryptoart. Interesting, August. Ground feel like being. Feel like between RJ and Skomra and these and these. And I think I brought this up. I did. I brought this up in the.
00:52:09.549 - 00:52:21.807, Speaker A: This by Tubecan. I brought this up in the AI section. Thank you, August, for highlighting it. And these. There is A new figurative trend that is super exciting. An interesting way of putting it. There is something to be said for that.
00:52:21.807 - 00:53:20.325, Speaker A: Like I thought a kind of a pressing thought or an interesting observation. 808 on chain collector as a passionate collector, I understand that aspiring up and coming artists may see me as a potential new collector source of revenue, but in my case, the moment an artist approaches me in comments or in the direct messages trying to show me their collection, chances go to zero that I will ever collect a piece. Question is, how do I convey this kindly and constructively so that the artist can fine tune their approach moving forward? I don't want to be a jerk, but this is not the way in my opinion. Yeah, yeah. I think it has to be more subtle. Like the collectors want to discover you kind of on their own time, on their own volition. And so probably the best way is maybe, you know, if I had to be super pragmatic and giving advice, comment on what they're doing and maybe they start to see you or follow you back and then all of a sudden they start to see your work.
00:53:20.325 - 00:53:44.045, Speaker A: Like let them discover you. It's just take a bit of a longer mid term view of getting to know, get to know them in a sense. Like be interested in what maybe 808 is doing. 808 on chain collector and say, oh, that's really cool, all this on chain stuff. And then maybe they go, oh, that person's nice. And then they check out your work and then they go, oh, I really like their work. Rather than the DM say please buy my work.
00:53:44.045 - 00:53:56.097, Speaker A: Doesn't work that well. Tornado Rodriguez. A new paint 98 is coming. So did we look at this? I'm not sure, but all this. Oh yeah, it's in the community. So awesome. So looking forward to that.
00:53:56.097 - 00:54:22.499, Speaker A: I think that's today also. Jake Studios, a work in progress here, as we see and we see again. And Jake had actually a very nice comment. I sometimes forget to bring up the retweets that people do of the show where they also put in comments. Here he was commenting, I'll try and remember to bring that up. He was commenting on how he's like, yeah, Pokebelly, absolutely intuitive. I work very intuitively.
00:54:22.499 - 00:54:47.095, Speaker A: I'm impressed that you figured that out. That's great. Yeah, it's the power of actually making art. Because then you go, well then you actually understand a lot more of the psychology behind it, what goes into why people do what they do. Sometimes you're wrong obviously, but it does help enormously. This came up in an earlier comment I think the other day, like, it's important for collectors. They should probably try and make art.
00:54:47.095 - 00:55:16.869, Speaker A: Like if you're a really serious collector, you should try and make art just to. And maybe you get good at it. It happens especially in this scene where things you discover a new software and all of a sudden you're making very fun stuff. Cream Sapphire. It's like techno in the sense that you don't necessarily need to know how to make a classical music or no scales, frankly, to make techno. You don't necessarily need to know anything about music to make techno. And in a weird way, I'd say digital art is not dissimilar.
00:55:16.869 - 00:55:39.935, Speaker A: Let's speed up here because I don't want this recording to get killed by going too long here. That can happen sometimes. Look at Cream Sappha on the projector. The alchemy of scale, as I love to say here. It's just so powerful. Imagine. You can just imagine what this is like, being up close and personal with this work when it's that big.
00:55:39.935 - 00:55:55.229, Speaker A: Amazing projectors. Here's more projectors. Clown Vamp. Can there be too much of a good thing? Puppies on giant walls. Look at how happy these people look. And you just see the visual impact of scale and projectors. It's very simple, you know.
00:55:55.229 - 00:56:16.989, Speaker A: So that's from Mike Barron and Bot O'Dell for the Curation Subjective New York City and Polygon 1993. Creating a card game. So this is the power of being focused and not trying to do too many things. You can just go, okay, I'm gonna make a card game now. How cool is that? Look at that beautiful packaging. Super cool. Let's continue.
00:56:16.989 - 00:56:37.059, Speaker A: Lone Wick. I'm happiest when I'm deep in the creative process, working on something that feels worth finishing. A few steps past the initial ideation. After I've iterated and uncovered key elements and I can see something real taking shape. That's one of the most fulfilling moments of being alive, I think. That's really interesting observation. Like it rings true.
00:56:37.059 - 00:56:53.285, Speaker A: Like there is nothing like. Because when you start, of course it's not a masterpiece when you put down the first line. But sometimes you know when it starts to come together and you feel like you're kind of onto something. A really nice one. That's a wonderful moment. It's like it's working. It's working.
00:56:53.285 - 00:57:16.629, Speaker A: So great commentary. Look at this. So we've been talking about riso printing, which is kind of like the cheap version of screen printing. It's kind of like using a photo color photocopier. Basically it's called Riso. And look at this. So you see the power of Riso because you get that offsetting physical element and 20 frames started with 24 but didn't survive.
00:57:16.629 - 00:57:36.985, Speaker A: Pink, sunflower and aqua. Only three colors. That is incredible. Is that right? Pink, sunflower and aqua. And you get all of these different colors and you see the offsetting. Brilliant. Like there's a lot to learn here of just like the power of rezo and pixels.
00:57:36.985 - 00:58:18.345, Speaker A: Noting that for months here, a couple of months at least one don't knows. I don't knows with a nice digital print of a works that were sold at Sotheby's. So as I say here, a different iteration of the work. This is the physical print, totally legit in my opinion, to sell prints of digital works that have sold. After all, I mean, from a legal perspective, you own the copyright, right? So why shouldn't you be able to do that? So very cool and nice production as ever from one don't knows. And here. So Bazaya actually left a comment a couple of episodes ago that I want to bring up and just kind of very topical work here by Bezaya Yeezys.
00:58:18.345 - 00:58:53.007, Speaker A: And here the Hannibal Lecter mask. So this looks like a digital painting because I was wondering at one point what's AI? Because there seemed to be some AI in some of them. This is a digital painting edition of 10 and sold out at only 5 tezos each. So Biziah putting out a ton of work. And here is the comment which I want to bring up, amigo. The first One, Frida, is AI and Photoshop is an Everydays with AI that I made during 30 minute days. The second one, Ricardo Smith, is 100% Photoshop is a Mint from 2021.
00:58:53.007 - 00:59:15.121, Speaker A: So no AI AI wasn't even between us as a tool. The lines that you see are the layers that I use in almost all my works to give the simulated oil on canvas. And that's what I thought was maybe AI. So apologies, Buzziah. They are present in almost in most of my work since I entered the NFT space. So yeah, you don't want to get thought of as making AI when you're not. But apparently some of the works are AI.
00:59:15.121 - 00:59:31.015, Speaker A: So yeah. So anyway, and here are some of the works in question. Of course I follow. Bazaya looks great, doesn't it? Very cool. Kind of like it looks like a trading card series. Love the pink that Bazaya pink. Awesome.
00:59:31.015 - 01:00:00.167, Speaker A: Here we have Rat Cloak with this gorgeous Work, I guess it just concluded at auction. And howdy do put in an offer right afterwards. Hilariously, 150 tezos. And here, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful work by Ratcloak out of Ukraine. Look at this painting here. And again, seeming to use a couple of different brushes here. And look at all this great kind of expressions here of these people on the boat with the yellow eyes.
01:00:00.167 - 01:00:25.425, Speaker A: Kind of reminds you of German Expressionism, this person. Yeah, I mean, just interesting. Beautiful, beautiful painting here. Stunning. And the color, I mean overall, the whole thing. If you go on the Instagram, maybe on Ratcloaks X I should have brought it up, but there's too many tabs here. You can see the original that Ratcloak used is for a reference and it's quite different.
01:00:25.425 - 01:00:44.165, Speaker A: Like just using certain areas was in black and white. I love the text at the bottom too. This is beautiful. So just another beauty from Ratcloak there. Here's Martin Bruce. Great to see Martin Bruce on the scene. One of the most original artists on the blockchain, without question.
01:00:44.165 - 01:01:11.715, Speaker A: And here you just see Martin Bruce at work. Look at this landscape. Just the decisions. Love it, love it, love it. 700 by only 700 by 846 sold for 300 tezos to Ajek within like an hour, probably within minutes. So the market continues to impress out here. Idio Obra de Tarsila do Amaral.
01:01:11.715 - 01:01:46.735, Speaker A: So I actually realized I actually knew the artist. I don't remember the name of the artist, but the artists we were looking at, that I didn't think I knew that always portrays the corpulent figures in Latin America. Obrador maybe or something. Yeah, I do know that artist. And what's funny is, so I looked up this artist, Tasserla do Amarel, who this work is based on. And I didn't find the individual work, but I did see this work here. This was in a Latin American show in a museum in Buenos Aires.
01:01:46.735 - 01:02:14.755, Speaker A: And yeah, so this is kind of in kind of a well known, I was told this is a very famous work in Latin American art. So here's Tercila do Amaril. So learning here too. I didn't see the original right away, but so, yeah, so here, another beautiful homage here by NAV 1914. Just spectacular series. Continue. And here's RJ the bull edition of 10 and selling out at 35 Tezos.
01:02:14.755 - 01:02:40.775, Speaker A: People excited to buy there. I mean, RJ has been pretty impressive here, seemingly using, I suspect, AI and then what looks like different kind of screen renderings really. Enfil and the Magic wand here. AI and pixel painting. And then turning into a gif. There is collage, interestingly, 1000 by 1000 addition of 10. So as you see here, the bull.
01:02:40.775 - 01:02:54.199, Speaker A: So selling well. Here are the wolves. And this sold within minutes. 333 tazos. Sold like within three minutes on the weekend here. So very cool external area here. Nice margin.
01:02:54.199 - 01:03:14.115, Speaker A: And here's another one. The garden. So as August Ground was saying kind of some new kind of figurative kind of moves here. Looking works nice painterly textures also by that. That one's still available. And the family dinner also by rj. And this is owned by Neon Monk.
01:03:14.115 - 01:03:27.055, Speaker A: So more cool artwork here seemingly. And look at these great fills here. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. Let's continue. Michi Asu. Michi Asu. A positive moment.
01:03:27.055 - 01:04:04.625, Speaker A: This is awesome. Let wild artwork here. Very cool. You know, I never brought up that news article, but there was some prominent gallerist who is like saying how they liked challenging works and how, you know, works that you just have no idea how that person ever could have come up with that. That's kind of where I'm at here with Michi Yasu. Feels so good. Edition of one sold for only 12 days.
01:04:04.625 - 01:04:17.177, Speaker A: Owes to Stanley. Nice pickup. And has ruble waffles on Rodeo. So it continues with waffles. Let's just see if this loads up. Indeed. So this is called Performatives.
01:04:17.177 - 01:04:28.433, Speaker A: Interesting title. And we see more of those double eyes. Love these double eyes. Or triple eyes in that case. And just outlines. Just having fun. Just gorgeous work.
01:04:28.433 - 01:04:46.777, Speaker A: Let's see Gary Larson. A little bit more animation in this one. So again, and you see all these different kind of textures. What I love is everyone seems to be done in a different way. Like here you see like almost like this different kind of rendering. It's quite astonishing. The.
01:04:46.777 - 01:05:07.135, Speaker A: And just it's probably easy for waffles. You imagine, like it's just having fun. Like in here, it seems to be a different kind of rendering, you know. And there is trouble in my way. So a little bit of text being repeated just makes it all look so, so easy. Very cool. So those are on Rodeo, another work by Zozo.
01:05:07.135 - 01:05:32.689, Speaker A: Narcissus. Classic Greek theme. Let's see. Totally awesome. And there is Narcissus there looking over into the pool. Brilliant. That sold to bullseye.
01:05:32.689 - 01:05:47.515, Speaker A: 180 for 60 tezos. So nice work, Zozo. And looks like sold same day. I mean, these artists are selling out, like, kind of across. Maybe not everybody, but like a lot of artists are selling out. Here's Mumble Boy who will be on the spaces on Wednesday. Amateur rhythm.
01:05:47.515 - 01:06:03.615, Speaker A: Very cool piece. Here again combining digital and physical collage. Maybe some photography, some digital elements, like the gradient edition of one. Only 16 tazos. Very cool. Here's another one. Summoned my inner Santiago to title this piece.
01:06:03.615 - 01:06:18.295, Speaker A: Finally reaching the destination only to find that I've already been here. 1 of 1. So again, we'll see Mumble Boy on this Wednesday space. So very cool artist. Been around for a while. A lot of experience there, I think out of New York. Don't buy Exit.
01:06:18.295 - 01:06:35.395, Speaker A: So I think these are previews of a show. And these cool dudes or people that are made of cursors here. And of course you recognize the style. Kind of like the blue screen of death. So there's that. Actually. Let me stop that.
01:06:35.395 - 01:06:43.683, Speaker A: And this is awesome too. Work in progress. This looks great. All the feedback. These people made of cursors. That looks like a still. Also amazing.
01:06:43.683 - 01:07:05.695, Speaker A: And here's another one. Game over. Let's see if this interesting audio. Pretty feels like a gallery here, doesn't it? There's a contemporary art museum in the vibe. Very cool. From Don't Buy. So I think there's a big show coming up by Don't Buy right away in the next week or two.
01:07:05.695 - 01:07:31.421, Speaker A: Speaking of Santiago, here's edition of 5 for 25 Tezos by Santiago. Massive abstract here. I risk crashing my computer to load this up, but here it is. You see there's a lot of AI, a lot of collage, a lot of elements from Santiago. So you see all of the incredible work that goes into this. Very cool abstract. Right? Huge title.
01:07:31.421 - 01:07:44.557, Speaker A: I will not venture to try and read that. So it looks like there's one left. Absurd deity. Picking up one. And here's another Santiago as we run through the show here. Eras of Heroes over. Interesting title.
01:07:44.557 - 01:08:03.679, Speaker A: And here another abstract. This is on object, so I'm not going to push my luck. And zoom in on that. 10,000 pixels approximately here is recollapse GM. So interesting painting here. I never saw this one there on Tezos. So interesting painter, digital painter, all sorts of interesting work.
01:08:03.679 - 01:08:19.855, Speaker A: And different kind of little areas. Looks like a boxing ring, someone on a computer drawing on a computer and all sorts of stuff. Cool texture. This was interesting too. Bedala. I'm bored. So a drawing from Bedala where I think we often see.
01:08:19.855 - 01:08:29.925, Speaker A: I guess it's kind of painting and collage. Kind of a different kind of look on this one. Cool painting. Kind of looks like a procreate. If. If I had to guess. Let's continue.
01:08:29.925 - 01:08:43.937, Speaker A: Zus Bliatkus. I don't know if this is a new work by them. I don't show their work enough. Very interesting artist here. They had a nice profile that Accomparts was putting out. Who, of course, I follow. Beautiful work.
01:08:43.937 - 01:08:56.061, Speaker A: Really interesting. I think uses Microsoft paint. Really interesting artist. Again, it's like mental note. They need to be more on this show. Very interesting. Goyoung with work.
01:08:56.061 - 01:09:22.603, Speaker A: Goyoung Fine Arts. So, yeah, always cool over there. Beautiful still of some flowers. And here is Wasteman Goldmanovich Retail Park. There's something kind of poetic about this work and almost kind of surreal in the elements all being kind of separated like this. There's the crow. It's like this, you know, formula, you know, this calculus of sorts is going on here of these different elements, you know, being brought together.
01:09:22.603 - 01:09:39.091, Speaker A: It definitely has a very surreal kind of feeling here. And even the light. Cool work by Waistman Goldmanovich. Ten tezos and I believe two left. So almost selling out there. Very nice work. And here is PP Universal with some humor here.
01:09:39.091 - 01:09:55.041, Speaker A: En contra la solution. So it looks like a toilet with a rocking chair. So kind of hilarious there from Pippi. Interesting piece. And continuing, here's Ilya Barabin. This is an edition of one for 100 tazos. Photo of physical work.
01:09:55.041 - 01:10:11.577, Speaker A: A three brush, a three paper airbrush. So very nice piece here from Ilya Barabin. A3. I wonder if the physicals are for sale as well. Very cool from Ilya. Continuing on. Everything looks like it's going well.
01:10:11.577 - 01:10:26.251, Speaker A: Jake Studios minted a wrong file. So kind of a different feel in this one. It reminds me of waffles in the sense of just like, let's just go wherever the direction takes you. Look at this cursor. This is like. It's interesting. I love the experimentation.
01:10:26.251 - 01:10:43.013, Speaker A: I admire it. Makes me want to, like. There's nothing in a sense as an artist that's funner than when you feel like you're breaking new ground and it's kind of working. It's a real. It starts to feel like very exciting. So all to say, minted or wrong File edition of one. I applaud the act.
01:10:43.013 - 01:11:03.925, Speaker A: 15 tezos at auction from Jake Studios. Here is Cesar Tatlungari edition of 11. And so interesting piece here. Contemporary figures here, out in the street. Even a little bit of camouflage. And this tinier figure here with a skull. And then boxing boxer, House on Fire.
01:11:03.925 - 01:11:37.001, Speaker A: Interesting work made with a smartphone. 3,3500 by 4000. I always kind of have a soft spot in my heart for that very cool edition of 11 selling out at only 220 free. Ezra Eslin Deave yeah, so drive baby. So I almost show this with hesitation because there's so much tragedy out there. But of course that is the, you know, it's kind of satire of violence is really Ezra Ellen Ezra Eslin's out of Turkey's kind of subject matter. So almost in the tradition of Warhol's Crash a little bit.
01:11:37.001 - 01:11:54.577, Speaker A: But those weren't humorous anyways. I'm not sure if this is supposed to be humorous probably. Of course I follow Ezra edgy work. Had to show it Shinayo Moriyama and I think Sabato might have retweeted this. I thought it kind of a cool work. Interesting piece. These rabbits here.
01:11:54.577 - 01:12:21.895, Speaker A: Tearing back the paper showing more rabbits in the hay seemingly. Seba Sestero, who of course I follow and met over in Argentina in person, does illustrations for the New York Times and everything. So many talented people here. Maybe get them on the space on the spaces here. Just interesting. Someone reading with the books kind of flying out here. All this kind of psychological imagery lends itself perfectly to newspapers and igmatras.
01:12:21.895 - 01:12:42.415, Speaker A: So more ASCII works here. So this is pretty cool. Kind of like a diagram here where you see the car being mirrored up here. A very interesting piece there. And here's another one of a car. Different kind of composition, but almost using these old ads. Very interesting.
01:12:42.415 - 01:13:02.729, Speaker A: And continuing on. Here's another one. The ASCII vacation on the beach. And you see here the experimentation continues in this even cool green text over top. A lot of experimentation here. I love it. Not just sticking to that one process, but just adding, taking being very experimental and kind of free flowing with it.
01:13:02.729 - 01:13:21.709, Speaker A: Very cool Blank expression I think is the title here. Edition of seven six Tezos. Look at that. Kind of a wild work here. Cool kind of Internet work. Interesting gradient here on the computer. Kind of retro computer that is 6 Tezos edition of 7.
01:13:21.709 - 01:13:46.437, Speaker A: Here's a Game Boy broken GB color by Muji. Cool subject here and pretty hilarious actually with again retro gaming consoles. And then breaking the screen here and even breaking it in half. Edition of 8 and 1. Sold so far to KF. Here's a cool work by Kappen. I think it's under the Kapn name.
01:13:46.437 - 01:14:00.583, Speaker A: This is on sir app. So just putting out a ton of work here. I don't know how to. I don't want to reload the page. Oh, here it is. It kind of works as a kind of diptych Too here. I guess that's just the two that Kapn has in this series.
01:14:00.583 - 01:14:16.185, Speaker A: That's on Surreal app. If you're looking for some Capn works. Let's continue. And then also on Rodeo continues to post. Let's see if we can make a big. Okay so basically that was the normal size. A great color scheme on these as well.
01:14:16.185 - 01:14:37.257, Speaker A: We have three part of this Jam pixel art series. Jam 11 here and Jam 12. So putting out three at a time almost with Rodeo's kind of structure mirroring rodeo structure there. Three per row. Uncle arrived. This is stalamere and sold for 100 tezos. This wild pixel artwork.
01:14:37.257 - 01:14:54.219, Speaker A: Kind of sci fi pixel art. Very cool. It looks like a dragon Uncle Eric. Kind of ancient and futuristic at the same time. Very cool pixel artist. Here is Samha who I think just had a big show. Actually if I'm not mistaken.
01:14:54.219 - 01:15:09.739, Speaker A: Here's a piece that crossed my desk over here. Cool work. I think this is part of that show. Kind of animated. We've seen some of their work before. Part of the Object gallery edition of One and at a Thousand and Fifty Two. Nice sale.
01:15:09.739 - 01:15:34.531, Speaker A: $757 to Capricorn so far and not even over yet. Mark Travail Cyprus kind of has a bit of a. I want. I think of Van Gogh with Cyprus. But here we've seen Mark Travis work before. I recognize the color scheme kind of pixel art in yellow and black and gray. I guess minimal pixel art landscape edition of 10 and sold out at only 3 Tezos 33.
01:15:34.531 - 01:15:51.323, Speaker A: Here is Element Lee as we continue our DJ set here. Look at how cool this is. Love the kind of roughness of this. Or the looseness again the textured pixels. This very cool historic architecture. Awesome. Always unpredictable.

01:16:05.395 - 01:16:20.535, Speaker A: Very cool. So edition of 15. Only 250. Here's Aile. So I believe no reference Monica by Ilay on Rodeo Club so you can get this on Rodeo. Beautiful piece here. I love the big size of it here.
01:16:20.535 - 01:16:34.061, Speaker A: So really nice drawing. Can't remember what Aile used. D Paint Deluxe paint. Very nice piece. Let's continue. Emmy Pixel with more pixel art. Time for bed.
01:16:34.061 - 01:16:53.375, Speaker A: So cool work here. Love the scale on this one. In this little tower with the clouds going by at sunset with stars. I mean totally awesome edition of one. How much did it sell for? 10 tezos. Pretty reasonable. And here is Chris War, who is saying there's a new design by Braindead, also known as Wright Click Dead, who of course I follow.
01:16:53.375 - 01:17:06.083, Speaker A: Let's see if we can get that working. Look at all this great music equipment. Of course. Chris War, electronic music artist as well. And yeah, very cool. There we go. So cool.

01:17:41.345 - 01:17:53.231, Speaker A: Taka Presents Life in Pixels So doing golf. Love it. Or. And there's more. So this is part of a series. So almost like an ad. Very cool.
01:17:53.231 - 01:18:11.985, Speaker A: Great title for a show. Here's Kyle Flemmer. So this is, I believe, almost positive that this is on chain. As you can see how small it is. And it can be magnified if you put this in Photoshop. Like this can be just magnified infinitely. And very interesting piece here.
01:18:11.985 - 01:18:26.873, Speaker A: And it's always more kind of seductive when it's on chain. Not even putting it for sale or. Sorry. Offer came in at 50 tezos. There's something very special about putting things on chain. Xen favorite place to be. This was posted, I think a few days ago.
01:18:26.873 - 01:18:42.127, Speaker A: September 24th. I just love this landscape. Like it kept appearing in my bookmarks and I just like. I think it was just a really original way of portraying a landscape in GIF format. Very cool. Let's continue. Nicholas Sassoon Elevation.
01:18:42.127 - 01:19:02.355, Speaker A: So more kind of nature, natural landscapes here using this really cool kind of pixel art style. I adore this one. I'm listening to Duran Duran in the last like 24 hours. Lady of the Night. And this kind of had a. Love the feel of this one. Very cool work.
01:19:02.355 - 01:19:21.125, Speaker A: It's actually a really long piece. It's 1083 frames, so we're not going to watch the whole thing. It's a huge file, 260 megabytes. Really love this piece though, by Silva Santos. That's an open edition, only two minted. Available for another three days. 420 acid boy.
01:19:21.125 - 01:19:35.743, Speaker A: Good night. So just cool psychedelic abstract from Acid Boy. And here's Lena Eckert. Silent Light. Cool little a. Cool. What would we call it animated abstract.
01:19:35.743 - 01:19:49.399, Speaker A: Kind of a little bit psychedelic here, too. Very cool piece. That's a minute. So we can't watch the whole thing, but maybe I scroll through a little bit. So, yeah. So cool work from Lena Eckhart again. Silent Light.
01:19:49.399 - 01:20:13.665, Speaker A: And here's Louis with that work that we're seeing now. Minted mitograph series number one, now available for 18 tezos and looks like sold out at 220. That's how you do it. So, you know, if you're especially like people who are new, I tell them keep it cheap so that you sell out and then. Then you raise your prices from there very slowly. Very cool. Mitograph series number one.
01:20:13.665 - 01:20:25.615, Speaker A: Cool title. And we saw that work yesterday, too. And here's another one. Another one by Louis. You can still dance when trapped in a box edition of 10 still available, but not for long. Five gone. And let's see.
01:20:25.615 - 01:21:06.695, Speaker A: Interesting piece here by Louis. So more. I guess that's like CGA animation Blender. Ableton Audio song excerpt from Japanese Sausage by Louis JPD available on all platforms. So more music and visual arts colliding here. And here's Bosque Grazia's Fantasy Chapter number 20. So not sure if this is using maybe a glitched camera, I might say here.
01:21:06.695 - 01:21:27.605, Speaker A: So this is in rural Italy. Daily video harvests of a journey through Europe. I was seeing some of that when I went out for lunch with Bosque in August. That was awesome. Klaus with a new work, composition number 327 in this epic series here. Cool textures. Beautiful piece from Klaus.
01:21:27.605 - 01:21:45.045, Speaker A: Edition of one continues to sell. 23 tazos. Here's Simulacro. Art is not a thing. Remember, Art is not a thing. I may kill the audio in case of copyright there, which probably changes the piece. So forgive me.
01:21:45.045 - 01:21:58.561, Speaker A: Simulacro. Great to see Simulacra, though. So cool work here from Simulacro. Art is Not a Thing. Of course I follow them, met them in Buenos Aires. That was awesome. They're on that special episode, so check them out.
01:21:58.561 - 01:22:16.671, Speaker A: They're on object. Here's Marietta. This is part of a larger work, but I thought this was actually a pretty. This could almost work as a piece. These shoes, there's so much detail in them and they're so kind of well done. This could be a piece, is what I was thinking to myself. Just kind of interestingly, I thought it was.
01:22:16.671 - 01:22:28.515, Speaker A: And then I went and I found the other piece and I was like, oh, it's a large piece. It's like a full Person. Parsa most of. Very cool Parsa most of. I'm a blacksmith. Another day I'm a backer. So some 3D.
01:22:28.515 - 01:22:53.793, Speaker A: So you see Parsa most of in the studio, seemingly. I didn't realize that this is how some of this work is made. I mean, amazing virtual studio. Amazing. Agnes Evergrace with kind of a cool, kind of looks like CGI kind of 3D work. Not sure what this is. Kind of looks like a figure that's upside down.
01:22:53.793 - 01:23:12.225, Speaker A: Very interesting. No details given. Cool piece. And here is that GLB by Martin Joe BB Bear. Black paddle, Kinky Bears. Again, this is crying out for a real world version, isn't it? That maybe 3D printed, I don't know. But yeah, with GLBS.
01:23:12.225 - 01:23:29.309, Speaker A: I'm sure all the hard work has been done here. All you got to do now is probably send it to somewhere to get printed. Edition of 10 for 3 tezos. Here's Renki edition of 1. It was great hearing from Renki the other day. Kind of a mysterious figure. And I've shown so much of Renki's work, it's hilarious.
01:23:29.309 - 01:23:40.025, Speaker A: Like almost every show. I want to say Kuri Kara edition of one. And loving this new color scheme. Always inventive. Just a rad artist. Edition of 1. Not listed.
01:23:40.025 - 01:23:51.745, Speaker A: Human by definition. We've been seeing some of this ASCII abstraction. Animated, abstract, different colors coming in. Letters, text. As we go into AI. Here's Skomra tt. Very nicely textured work.
01:23:51.745 - 01:24:08.303, Speaker A: Here again seems to use stable diffusion, that textual inversion, as they're calling it. Look at these colors. Totally Original. Super interesting AI artwork. Stable diffusion and diffusers. Textual inversion. Edition of one now at 14 tazos.
01:24:08.303 - 01:24:23.775, Speaker A: 44 tazosents and Yigo Bilbao. Another Mickey looking work. Almost starting to fuse with the other work. Interestingly with the other, I think. I don't know if it's AI, but the other work by Inigo Bilbao. Very cool. Here's Joa yin play.
01:24:23.775 - 01:24:46.377, Speaker A: Take one, 2024. So again experimenting with a slightly different series here now. Cool AI painting, I believe, and digital collage. There's AI digital painting and collage I believe in their work Tokes, the Garden where Color Speaks. And YO Yin's work, the Garden where Color Speaks In Silence. Beautiful work by Toques here as usual. Always super interesting.
01:24:46.377 - 01:25:09.255, Speaker A: Here's Lily Illo Self data. So cool. AI painting here by Lily Illo. As we move towards the end of the show, here's a new new person, Tony Wahlstrom that I hadn't seen before. And I believe this Is AI as well. And we will attempt, as you can see here. So kind of interesting AI painting by this artist.
01:25:09.255 - 01:25:29.193, Speaker A: A lot of texture there. Untitled Saunders sketch number three. And this was August Ground posted this is by Tug Can. So, you know, referencing more interesting figurative work here. Observantly, Nobody Told me edition of one and that sold for 20 tazos. August ground. Huge collector and supporter of the scene.
01:25:29.193 - 01:25:42.881, Speaker A: No hygiene. Look at this one. I'm almost surprised it only has 2000 views. This is gorgeous. So original. And it's so great to see this artist go through such challenging areas and then end up somewhere. So interesting.
01:25:42.881 - 01:25:56.745, Speaker A: Reminds me of 1914. Very cool. Kennek Zapata. No wonder. So interesting kind of text work in this series. Writing poetry with a computer. Yeah.
01:25:56.745 - 01:26:16.965, Speaker A: So very interesting approach to poetry here by Canik Zapata. Such an interesting, prolific artist. And here's Filippo Francocci as we go into the physicals. Pretty sure this is physical. Cool work there. And we have another one, clearly physical going on black paper. It's another.
01:26:16.965 - 01:26:36.293, Speaker A: I've done a little bit of work on black paper with acrylic markers. It's a very interesting way of working. There's also some, you know, element. Lee talking about the screen and the negative space. Yeah, very cool. This was a showstopper. Claudia Bertrand is the artist.
01:26:36.293 - 01:26:54.669, Speaker A: I think this is a showstopper. Like, you could have opened the show with this. What a painting. And really, I mean, it's probably just taking a still from the Internet, but what a painting. I just think this is incredible. Like, it just. It says so much and it's just amazing painting.
01:26:54.669 - 01:27:19.797, Speaker A: Claudia Bitrin. So, yeah, huge fans of contemporary art in certain respects here of artists, shall we say. Kristen Hjellardy is, I think. Is this show going to be in Berlin? No, West Palm Beach. They must be ready for another show here in Berlin. Rebecca Brodsky. So interesting artist here from the Christian Hellardy Gallery.
01:27:19.797 - 01:27:36.915, Speaker A: Another interesting artist we've been following. Jesse Makinson. Realms opens today at Carl Friedman Gallery. Really interesting, kind of. I'd almost want to call this the Neocerrealism. I say with some reservation. Babachik Matia Kabo.
01:27:36.915 - 01:27:56.351, Speaker A: So interesting work. We've looked at a ton of this artist's work. This Cabo from 2024, oil and acrylic on canvas. Very interesting artist. Here's David Hales, who I've been following forever. Just a really talented and super prolific artist. And here is Moto Mohiro.
01:27:56.351 - 01:28:16.911, Speaker A: One more time with the skull for a hat and other skulls there. And finally, here's Ilya Barabin again, one of one for 100 TEZ. Nice work. Available on object. And that, my friends, is your show. Clocking in at 1 hour 28 minutes. Thank you for joining and come join me with Mumble Boy on Wednesday.
01:28:16.911 - 01:28:18.415, Speaker A: Until next time, take care.
