00:00:04.960 - 00:00:39.038, Speaker A: There are storm clouds on the horizon, ladies and gentlemen, but we continue to sail forward here with these beautiful works of art by our side, accompanying us in our journey through the imagination. Artist journal, April 25, 2023. Broadcasting to the world from our inner space. Broadcasting from inner space in Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pokebelli and I think we've come up with a new intro here. I love that. Broadcasting from inner space in Berlin, Germany.
00:00:39.038 - 00:01:08.740, Speaker A: I love it, I love it, I love it. And I love you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for all the great comments and retweets and just fun. I think Devo inspires that maybe has struble as well with the just doing things for fun, you know, with the kids programs and you gotta love it. So anyways, some hilarity on Twitter as usual and everything. Speaking of fun, here's Hercules. If you are newer, maybe you're not familiar with this.
00:01:08.740 - 00:01:37.904, Speaker A: I mean, we've looked at Hercules's work, you know, maybe back in November, doesn't release a ton of stuff. This was actually burned a couple of minutes after it was listed. It actually got listed. Let me just play you the music because it's kind of crucial. It's really nice. Just a short, short loop, 8 seconds. Just a vibe, you know, we're vibing here.
00:01:37.904 - 00:02:08.638, Speaker A: Super duper cool. Huge fan of Hercules here, so who knows why it was burnt. But anyways, let's just look at what happened here. Edition of 15 for only two tezos canceled after three minutes, so maybe saw an error. So who knows? This will probably be minted again, one would assume. Unless Hercules just said, you know what? I don't know, but I love it. I'm starting with this.
00:02:08.638 - 00:02:40.044, Speaker A: So anyways, I just love the vibe. There's kind of a. Technically, it's pretty interesting. I mean, we always speak of texture. Like here there's kind of physical, almost like crumpled paper or worn out paper on the side here and here you almost see like that Benday dots here, the CMYK rasterized in the print sense, colors here. And anyway, so it's got a real print feel to it. But I mean, clearly a digital work of art.
00:02:40.044 - 00:03:11.260, Speaker A: So anyways, it'd be very interesting to see how these would be made physically. Actually this is an illustration though, and I'm pretty sure it's a digital illustration. So anyways, you got the retro computers, the ghetto blaster or the radio and everything, and the plants and everything. So just another awesome work by Hercules. And for those that are maybe newer, here's Hercules. Here's Hercules page I do stuff. Some are cool.
00:03:11.260 - 00:03:34.454, Speaker A: It's on object. And yeah, I mean, I'm pretty sure I started the episode. This was way back, you know. When was this? October 13. So it's been a while since Hercules has minted anything. And so it's a kind of, for me, in my personal world, it's a big deal. And I'm always excited with what Hercules is up to.
00:03:34.454 - 00:04:03.234, Speaker A: Let's see if we can get the music on this. Yeah, remember that. So, you know, the wine, the paraphernalia, the mixing board, the computer, it's all there. It's beautiful. And it's only twelve tezos for the collectors out there. Maison, the great Maison, is selling his copy for only twelve and tornado rodrigos for 15. So you can still get these wonderful, wonderful works.
00:04:03.234 - 00:04:21.738, Speaker A: So tomorrow, Flora Marquez is coming on, on the Twitter spaces. So check that out. I will once again pin this to my profile. And yeah, I'm excited. There's Flora. You recognize her here. And we're going to hang out with Rune tune and it's just going to be really fun.
00:04:21.738 - 00:04:49.030, Speaker A: I believe she's out of Argentina. And she's just, again, like, she's been. I just looked on her object and actually, let's just bring it up right here. Yeah, I mean, she's been on objects since like August of 2021, so. And she's been just steady as she goes as far as just being prolific. And, you know, and it's fun. You can see her look at how much she's come a long way in a sense.
00:04:49.030 - 00:05:31.644, Speaker A: Like, this is a beautiful work of art, but I'll show you something else. So there's that. But then, so that was August 2021. But then she's making these, like. And she was doing all these stamps by, you know, May 11, 2022. So less than a year later and you're getting like, these epically beautiful works here. So again, it's kind of a testament, I think, to the market because, I mean, sure, maybe Flora would have made this evolution if she is working in her studio by herself, but I think it's a testament to community and the market community as well, and just having other people seeing what you're doing and then selling a little bit, getting encouraged by those sales and then pushing forward.
00:05:31.644 - 00:06:21.124, Speaker A: This is why I think that's the combustion engine that is powering this whole situation that I am covering here on a regular basis because something is going on over here. So I mean, look at these epically beautiful works. This is from June 4, 2022. And like, you know, this this, you know, what seems like a fictional country here, Marundango and this beautiful map and almost referencing, you know, these familiar looking, you know, tropes of, you know, these people holding this, this new world sort of feeling, but just completely her own and making it a stamp. And I was a huge stamp collector. That was the first thing I ever collected. And so anyways, just an awesome, awesome artist.
00:06:21.124 - 00:06:41.680, Speaker A: So I'm thrilled. I believe she's out of Argentina. And yeah, just a real talent. And of course, we've been following her work with the illustrations. So just a really, really cool artist. Tradscape. The guy who does this, the music for the opener and the closer of this show, I think it's called Sunburn at midnight.
00:06:41.680 - 00:07:02.834, Speaker A: That opening tune that I play here every time the show starts at one point, tradscape, like maybe in November. He's kind of disappeared for a little bit, but I'm sure he'll come back. He was sort of like, show Flora. She's one of the greats. Show Flora on the show. And I did, and it was great advice. Here's Flora's stickers.
00:07:02.834 - 00:07:25.714, Speaker A: So Flora Marquez, I selected some of the drawings of the nulla di Sinalinea collection and made stickers. Do you like them? So anyways, so she's doing stickers. She's doing all sorts of stuff. So anyways, more reasons to be excited about tomorrow. Wednesday at 09:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time. I have pinned the tweet so you can set the reminder if you go to my page there.
00:07:25.714 - 00:07:57.640, Speaker A: So it'd be great to see people. And just a kind of a reminder, like, when I started doing spaces, I told people, like, public speaking is an incredibly important thing of any business that you're doing. And if you're an artist, you're an entrepreneur, so you have to be able to speak in public. And so no one ever completely masters that. In a sense, like, it's always, you can always get better, let's put it that way. People do master that, but you can always get better. So take advantage of these spaces because it's a very friendly, kind of chill environment.
00:07:57.640 - 00:08:24.394, Speaker A: And then you can meet people like Flora, and that is a great thing. Meet artists from all over the world. Speaking of spaces, another place you can do that and just work your public speaking skills is retro Manny. This is today. So if you're watching this, it may be within an hour or two of when you're watching this. Retro Manny presents cyberpixel anniversary collection. There's gonna be a Twitter spaces join and I am gonna co host it with retro Manny.
00:08:24.394 - 00:08:44.330, Speaker A: So that is super fun for the official drop, Tuesday, April 25 at 01:00 p.m. So that is today at 01:00 p.m. Eastern Standard time, New York time. So that's gonna be a ton of fun and I'm looking forward to it. You can set the reminder here. Just go to retro Manny's page. So all sorts of opportunity to hang out in this scene, which is really fun and super easy.
00:08:44.330 - 00:09:05.794, Speaker A: You just do it from your phone. Thank you for the comments yesterday. We got a great response. I think devoid might of be part of the inspiration there. Santiago, great episode. And yeah, and I wrote, I think fewer tabs works better. And I am still working towards making this like a shorter.
00:09:05.794 - 00:09:23.768, Speaker A: I think just overall it's better. If this show is more like 30 minutes, 30 to 40 minutes. Who knows? I've been trying to do that for months. But let's see. And there was another thing. Jonathan Gibson, a longtime viewer, shout out to Jonathan. I've been turning old oversized tvs.
00:09:23.768 - 00:10:02.244, Speaker A: So remember Kareem Safa's work? That was the table. It almost looked like a pong situation. I've been turning old oversized tvs upwards, running loops and early sat feeds, then layering gels and milky glass and calling an electric table circa 1988. Anything with more detail beyond ambient sound kills a party and may as well be a sports bar. Cheers. So anyways, so Jonathan has been playing with this concept for a long time. And anyway, shout out to Austin Morgan and demon ego leprochant, runetune, tombombattle.
00:10:02.244 - 00:10:27.874, Speaker A: It was really great response yesterday. And DJ Kiro here. And this is actually important. So regarding the work, it was actually a collaboration with, with e boy, that work by DJ Kiro, which looked like kind of the big space invader type looking spider figure and was glitched out. It's a pixel artwork that e boy has made, and I used my machines to give it that analog video look. And yes, it's in my friendly integration world. Cheers.
00:10:27.874 - 00:10:54.606, Speaker A: Cheers back. And this is funny too. Islay with a, I guess a kind of homage to the episode created with drag and drop draw collab app and Santiago and human kernel. So this is pretty hilarious. So this is vintage pokebelly, the Lego mix. You got music for hyperspace, volume one here. And you got some old screenshot art with Devo in it and even the dead kennedys there.
00:10:54.606 - 00:11:20.876, Speaker A: So anyways, hilarious and thank you, Ilay. And also from Ilay. So remember how I was saying the big chunky square brush was Pixelmator pro. Sorry, Pixelmator probably. And Ilay, fill this in here for the rainbow skull AI background within painting. Photoshop, slight editing and Pixelmator Pro. Pixel brush painting with two different opacity settings.
00:11:20.876 - 00:11:46.436, Speaker A: So yes, it was that. And I've been talking about how I made works with the Pixelmator Pro. It's a great brush. This square, big brush is weirdly hard to find. I would argue, like, Photoshop doesn't make it easy to get just a big square brush. And feel free to disagree with that. I've done it and I've practically had to create my own and all this sort of thing.
00:11:46.436 - 00:11:58.504, Speaker A: Just give me a square brush. Anyways, Pixelmator will do it for you. So this is a work from. When is this from? 2016. Shoes. And you see, it was part of a shopping series. This was actually an oil painting version.
00:11:58.504 - 00:12:37.810, Speaker A: So this isn't, you know, now I'd probably screen print the shoes and then, like, you see, there's a little bit of a penumbra. Or like, you see how like, there's a bit of a spotlight on these where it's darker. And so I was using oil paint for that. I might still use oil paint if I return to the shopping series, which I've literally been planning to do for six years. So, anyways, a very fun series based on Google Ads here. And yeah, put into Instagram to get that. That kind of penumbra, I think you would call it, or that kind of gradient there, which kind of lends itself to oil painting.
00:12:37.810 - 00:13:06.558, Speaker A: So anyways, that work sold too, by the way, this sold for about 1200 us. So that was great. To an old friend in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. So anyway, there is the Pixelmator pro brush in action. Very fun brush, little cakes. Also, this is a really interesting comment. Always enjoy you sharing how to connect the dots, historically, thematically, etcetera, for anyone in and around or visiting San Francisco.
00:13:06.558 - 00:13:39.648, Speaker A: Vivale is outside city lights most weekends selling research stuffs. So I tell you, if this is almost a reason to go to San Francisco, v. Vale is a very friendly guy. Sounds like little cakes is met Vale and just a very unassuming, friendly guy. And again, just, you know, has done some very important work in terms of setting the intellectual foundation of the counterculture. Okay. Which is no small matter.
00:13:39.648 - 00:14:24.906, Speaker A: Again, connecting the dots between, you know, Burroughs and Devo. And there were very important dots to be connected there. For example, I mean, if, you know, Devo is here to go. That is based on William Burroughs. We're here to we are here to go into space, right? So there are very important kind of connections that vail astutely recognized very early on and then did a beautiful job of connecting them in his tabloid and in research publications. So again, if you're in San Francisco or nearby or you plan on visiting, there's a stop for you. Like you, you know, just to have access to someone like Vale.
00:14:24.906 - 00:14:53.734, Speaker A: And there he is, humbly on the street there, hanging out. A very cool, cool dude. So also, I didn't realize little cakes made work. So I was trying to find a picture of the rainbow skull patches I made with an x a long time ago to show you, but could only find this image of a random test print on copy paper. So this was. And there's the Pixelmator pro brush in action from ilay. Okay, so anyways, little cakes also makes work.
00:14:53.734 - 00:15:10.882, Speaker A: So that's super cool. And anyway, so I just wanted to show that just kind of a cool flying skull there. And here's another skull. So. And it also fits into this whole theme of showing old work. Okay. And here's neurocolor printed and sold in 2018.
00:15:10.882 - 00:15:37.384, Speaker A: I don't know if this is a trend or not, but it seems to be. I think it's super cool because again, it just lends credibility to this. Whatever's going on over here, it just kind of fills in the blanks. A lot of these artists have been artists for years and years and years, as we were seeing with oxine and others. So anyways, very cool. From neurocolor printed and sold in 2018. You can go to neurocolor's feed to get the whole story here.
00:15:37.384 - 00:16:00.722, Speaker A: Another skull. And this is art matter, I think we'd call it art matter. And this is interesting as well as far as the whole technological situation. Evolution. Take a look at this. A demo of an artist and robotic arm collaborating to create a work of art. Everything is controlled through blender for a fully interactive workflow.
00:16:00.722 - 00:16:30.224, Speaker A: This is just one of the many examples of art and tech working together at Artmatter hq. It's a bit of a creepy. I almost sound it in a good way, I guess. But watch this. You're gonna see. You're gonna see the robot arm here. And I'm not exactly sure, you know, like, yeah, anyways, so you see them collaborating together, it's almost kinda a little unsettling.
00:16:30.224 - 00:16:54.096, Speaker A: That's kind of more the word I'm looking for. It's a little unsettling. And this is quite interesting here too, in blender. So anyways, human and machine collaborating here. So isn't that interesting? I have to get my hands on a pen plotter or access. And as far as just another kind of progress shot. And I love this, too.
00:16:54.096 - 00:17:25.443, Speaker A: Someone living their dreams right now thanks to this whole blockchain situation. I would argue, honestly, nothing like waking up at 05:00 a.m. To paint. And there is rare working on a new piece. And again, you see rare's process here where he does the outline in this kind of green, kind of almost charcoaly or like chalky textured thing, and then fills it in just with some beautiful oil paint. So anyways, very cool. Almost looks like the creation of Adam there by Michelangelo.
00:17:25.443 - 00:17:50.040, Speaker A: Maybe he'll put a spot in spot in there. John with a new work, April 24. So really putting the work out and kind of another spring work here with some flowers being shoveled off into the studio here. So very cool to see John keeping on, keeping on with new work. And let's just see. I bet this just sells out. Like, I mean, it's almost going to be too, too long.
00:17:50.040 - 00:18:11.544, Speaker A: Look at this. Like, listed at 1026 Berlin time and sold out by 1028 at 25 tezos each. So that is just a taste. And then tons of secondary sales here. So that is just a taste of John's kind of fan base here. So anyway, very cool. April 24, 2023.
00:18:11.544 - 00:18:40.734, Speaker A: And check out rada rat von ratten crypto oysg zero one. First Medici Knight rat von Ratten action figure from the special edif edition of G Gu's cryptoise. Second genesis. Anyway, look at this rata. WTF? And so there you have it. You have the concept work and even the box and everything. It's like, you know what it kind of reminds me of? And big shout out to edge Q.
00:18:40.734 - 00:18:56.730, Speaker A: It kind of reminds me of edge Q a little bit. And I got. You gotta love that. Where he does the. Where it's the trading card, but it's in the special, you know, mint condition mylar. Probably packaging is probably what that is. This is as well.
00:18:56.730 - 00:19:24.596, Speaker A: And it's almost like celebrating the almost fetishistic quality of packaging. You know, it's kind of like. Because, I mean, it kind of makes the piece here. And it's funny. I mean, I've done some nostalgia studies in the past where. Yeah, like, I'll do a Boba fett action figure drawing sort of thing and you put it in the packaging because the packaging is almost some of the best part. And you almost see that appreciation here as well.
00:19:24.596 - 00:19:58.446, Speaker A: So just kind of interesting, cool work. Edition of 3333 for fortezos, each a mysterious work from rustic digital art. So it's a still work with music and almost like Mario type music. Let me expand this. So more incomprehension on purpose. A confounding work, you know. So anyways, I had to highlight that.
00:19:58.446 - 00:20:53.124, Speaker A: That goes for a minute and rustic, keeping it interesting on the. On the confounding side of things and just on the, you know, it's. It's irrational. It is unmistakably irrational. Look at the birds inside you so again, as he said once before, and I've mentioned many times, almost a response to. Almost a response to AI continuing on Kappa Sage with a new work. And I was looking at this and I was almost thinking to myself, this is almost a portrait of the kind of youth to a certain degree or of like a younger person, you know, wealth, women for Kappa and, you know, the nice clothing, you know, McDonald's and, you know, I almost think of my girlfriend's son a little bit.
00:20:53.124 - 00:21:29.440, Speaker A: Like, I mean, these are going to McDonald's, really interested in the shoes and everything. It's almost like a portrait into the inner space, back to that term. It's almost a portrait of the inner space of a youth or a younger person, a younger guy. And I think he's out of Argentina, if I'm not mistaken. So creating wealth, we come from zero. And today we are creating wealth from ruin, probably out of Argentina because they're suffering a massive inflation right now. So interesting, kind of from a cultural and an artistic perspective, always well executed from Capa.
00:21:29.440 - 00:22:12.158, Speaker A: And I mean, we'll go back to Capa's work at another time. But I mean, Kappa's come a long way. Technically, another person who, you know, you start and then you have this community market success, you know, just selling works. And before you know it, the ambition grows and you evolve with that. So a very precious thing that I'd argue is going on here and unusual because as an artist, as we all know, you can, as any artist knows, it's kind of a. You can be before this digital stuff, you can be stuck in your studio and just feel like the world is passing you by. Right? And so it's a wonderful, wonderful thing where we can share the images.
00:22:12.158 - 00:22:24.514, Speaker A: People care. There are collectors. There's a little bit of a market. Even if you're selling for a tezos, you are selling. And that in itself is something. So anyways, new work from dan control. He has several.
00:22:24.514 - 00:22:39.482, Speaker A: I thought I'd show just one or two here. So an ant with another beautiful gradient in the background. So playing with the animal kind of theme here. Insect. So the brick layer. Nice title. Only for 40 tezos, an edition of one.
00:22:39.482 - 00:22:51.970, Speaker A: And he put out quite a few all at once. So here are other ants. And then you see ants building things. Traffic the climb. Fight for love. Unity is strength. So, anyways, just a really cool series by Dan Control.
00:22:51.970 - 00:23:17.048, Speaker A: We showed a lot yesterday, so just kind of highlighting this briefly here. But anyways, cool work from Dan Control. Mikey Wilson, no one to run with. So Mikey Wilson continues to make work, and that is super cool. And an interesting. I wonder what he's using. And this pairs with another work that he did a while ago, which was kind of also a snow scene with some guy, maybe.
00:23:17.048 - 00:23:37.024, Speaker A: This guy seems to have a machine gun or something. I think I brought it up here. Yeah. So it kind of goes well with this one here, doesn't it? It's almost that same sort of feeling. Addition of 20. And I think this might have sold out. Or maybe Mikey Wilson selling okay for 420, and he's selling the last one for 15.
00:23:37.024 - 00:23:55.068, Speaker A: And here you just see, like, if you're new to this community, here are a bunch of people for you to follow. These are just a lot of. Just people who've been here for a while. So a great community here. Isolationist walk, you know. So anyways. And Mikey Wilson has probably bought off all of those artists.
00:23:55.068 - 00:24:10.276, Speaker A: So, anyways, just a lot of fun there. Interesting piece. Kind of a winter work. No one to run with. Sometimes you lose soldiers along the way to the end of the road, and there's nobody left to run with anymore. So, slightly darker work. This other one.
00:24:10.276 - 00:24:24.610, Speaker A: If you're going through hell, keep walking. And anyways, continuing on. Rosatio. How are we doing, Rosatio? With a new work. And it got bid on right away here. Interesting things going on. I mean, we have some skeletons and skulls.
00:24:24.610 - 00:24:38.306, Speaker A: We've definitely seen the skulls before. And the eyeballs, which are kind of becoming trademark. And the moon. And some interesting masking. And the windows, almost like the Mac windows here. Eyeballs, repeated fire. So, anyways, interesting work.
00:24:38.306 - 00:24:56.640, Speaker A: Let's look at the title. Eclectic equilibrium. Price to sell. And it is, you know, so there it is, 0.1 ETH. I mean, it's still a couple of $100, which is awesome, right? Or $180, whatever ETH is right now. So got a bid within half an hour.
00:24:56.640 - 00:25:15.130, Speaker A: And boom. So it ends in 47 minutes. So probably go for that amount, unless someone jumps in here. And anyways, very cool digital collage. And photoshop stalka with an interesting piece. Kind of a drum and bass or jungle sort of feel. Stalk at times.
00:25:15.130 - 00:25:51.682, Speaker A: Mathkus. Illustration by Stalka Music and animation by Mathkus so stalke is another cool young voice. It's kind of like a portrait of youth that we're doing here today with you see Kappa Stalka. And I mean that in the best sense of younger people, people who seem to be in their twenties, you know. So just really cool. The voice of youth is here on this program here. So anyways, awkwardly witty is the name of the series.
00:25:51.682 - 00:26:09.534, Speaker A: And let's just see. So just minted. So we'll see if that gets listed. Wasteman gold minevitch three NFT dudes walk into a shop almost looking like this. Seems to be almost a testrubal waffle. Slight influence here. I could be wrong, but anyways, it looks great.
00:26:09.534 - 00:26:24.236, Speaker A: And what is this called? Yeah. Three nft dudes walk into a shop edition of 14. Now it's 95. So sold out. I picked one of these up and it was really, really cheap. Zero point four two cents. I guess I got one of the last ones.
00:26:24.236 - 00:26:54.280, Speaker A: Has drew Bull picked one up for 850? So that is awesome. So anyways, cool work from wasteman Goldman trying out something a little different. Burka Byram I don't know why I'm so sad, so happy. I don't know why I'm so happy I'm sad I'm in trouble seeing in double. So just kind of an interesting work with kind of happiness and sadness. Inverted happy faces and sad faces. Kind of reminiscent distantly to Louis Osborne.
00:26:54.280 - 00:27:13.160, Speaker A: You can almost put that in a similar room to Louis Osborne there. Available for ten tezos. Is that on primary? And there are 14 left. So cool work from Burka Bayram. Again, someone who's been on the Tezos community for a very long time. Check this out. I thought this was really cool and just different.
00:27:13.160 - 00:27:43.076, Speaker A: I don't think I've ever seen kind of a manga done in this style before. This is Mirai Mizue, where a collection of cells without exception. So maybe a bit of a biological theme here with the cells and kind of breaking down. And you almost see the mitochondria here. Or the nucleus of the cell, I should say not the mitochondria. Anyways, kind of an interesting portrait of sailor moon, I think. I am not an expert on those things.
00:27:43.076 - 00:28:12.624, Speaker A: Argyle tez dust to dust is another work here. So cool pixel artwork kind of reminds me a nifty monkey. I almost wonder to myself if they're the same person, but anyways, in the same province. And just a really cool structure and kind of has a. Almost a tarot card feel and a MC Escher feel. And just kind of this mystical magic portal here with an hourglass and wings. A lot of cool imagery going on here.
00:28:12.624 - 00:28:28.410, Speaker A: And then you have like a fetus here in the placenta and all this sort of thing. And these are moving. A very cosmic work. Dust to dust. So very cool. And look, there's already offers for twelve tazos. Let's just see what it's sold for very quickly.
00:28:28.410 - 00:28:42.874, Speaker A: Tuna. Looks like tuna was making offers there. Sold for only four tazos. Lago, seven got one and that sold out. It took a while. Oh, no, these were offers. Maybe this hasn't sold yet.
00:28:42.874 - 00:28:53.364, Speaker A: I don't see any sales here. Let's just look at the owners. So this is how you do it. So none of sold. Okay, so that's what's going on here. So people are putting in an offer. So people like this, clearly.
00:28:53.364 - 00:29:18.684, Speaker A: And here's Mannadel with a cool work in progress. Kind of has a video game feeling. So of course, Mannitol is a pixel artist. And so here is the cat in the bathtub, very cutely. And the bedroom and everything. So it's just a work in progress. Very interesting kind of combination of video games and the cats with pixel art, with the beautiful bright colors.
00:29:18.684 - 00:29:38.842, Speaker A: Very interesting combination. Work in progress, 20% of my part. Fighting for the next room. Interesting tomb and battle insight. So another interesting work here. And, yeah, so this is an edition of 19. And this sold out for five tezos each.
00:29:38.842 - 00:29:58.918, Speaker A: And it sold out within basically 20 minutes. So that is impressive. And anyway, cool work here. See the little rat? And again, beautiful pixelation. Classic tomb and battle colors. You can tell from a million miles away. And yeah, some interesting window here.
00:29:58.918 - 00:30:30.844, Speaker A: Kind of looks like the middle east or something. Insight map to the summit of the international park. So I don't know if we've seen this before, but a really interesting strange work by Kappin here, posted on Twitter. He goes under ziko jam if you're ever looking for him. So anyways, just an interesting, interesting work here from Kappen. And here's another pixel work from Popple, who has put out another satellitenstadt, satellite city. Zero, zero, eight.
00:30:30.844 - 00:31:06.126, Speaker A: And this just came out, edition of 25. Interesting colors, interesting process, like, interesting technique and just everything. Just very, very original. And you gotta love this too, these little details here in the corner. You know, you get the little bit of stuff here and like variation in each corner, although these mirror each other. So anyways, just super interesting work from popple. There are 13 left on primary at five tezos and a really beautiful work by mech TXT just posted on Twitter.
00:31:06.126 - 00:31:22.282, Speaker A: Interesting color experimentation. This green with the pink looks like a river again. And then maybe a power line, but actually it's probably more like string attached to sticks. Let's see if we have information. Take us home. So mech TXT is in Indonesia. And here's another one.
00:31:22.282 - 00:31:46.578, Speaker A: Just some practice, I think, more texture and depth practice. So this looks like slightly more perhaps of a winter scene, let's say. And maybe a sun in the background. Again, experimenting with the color there. Suthu and who I'm not sure I've seen before sooto eats flies is the Twitter account might do a little drop on tazos this week. It's been a minute. Prompt.
00:31:46.578 - 00:32:02.014, Speaker A: This is prompt whisperer. So pretty cool. Kind of reminiscent of native ed a little bit. Who I'm going to bring up next here. They hang well together. So anyways, prompt whisper. Cool title.
00:32:02.014 - 00:32:20.484, Speaker A: It's like a pretty cool work. And here's native Ed with I believe this is a new one. Oh no, this is old with the new notification function on objects. Sometimes I get old works mixed in here. So the sanctuary. Anyway, this is a pretty cool work by native Ed. So this is from 2022 though, edition of 20.
00:32:20.484 - 00:32:44.188, Speaker A: Let's just see what native Ed is doing. Recently crashed at 99% here. I'm not sure if we've seen this one. We saw the Gogo lightest one. So anyways, this is the latest, April 7. I'm not sure we saw this one from native Ed. So anyways, so you see the evolution and development here continuing on.
00:32:44.188 - 00:33:18.926, Speaker A: And that actually goes quite well, interestingly with this z cnde available domain number seven. And this is available edition of three for 44. Kind of a cool work, which again kind of echoes that native ed sort of feeling of the flashing the windows, the close up of the person, kind of the portrait here, kind of a bit of a snow effect here. Seems like outdoors or something in the winter. So anyways, cool work here. Two are left and one has sold to Pete Ritchie. So very cool.
00:33:18.926 - 00:33:46.170, Speaker A: Reinky, who we continue to look at with their great abstract, animated abstract work here. So just another interesting work with pixelation following this red line and a couple of spheres. So interesting abstraction there. And here's another one. Let's see what this says. Blue eyes, white dragon. So another one from Polygon 1993, who I think did that Super Mario yesterday or yeah, yesterday.
00:33:46.170 - 00:34:00.754, Speaker A: And this kind of looks like maybe it's also a. I don't know if it's a Zelda figure or another kind of video game figure. Some beautiful work here. It looks beautiful. I don't know where it's minted. My art book, so big cartel. I don't know what that is.
00:34:00.754 - 00:34:29.214, Speaker A: I'm not sure if these are nfts though. My debit card. So anyways, continuing on, another really interesting piece by Claus Tez. I found this quite poetic. Which sun wakes you up in the morning so just to see two suns. I mean, it's reminiscent of those Star wars scenes where you see two suns in the sky, which I'm sure exists somewhere out there. So here's someone looking off into it with some beautiful kind of pixelation and maybe screen filtering.
00:34:29.214 - 00:34:50.172, Speaker A: Libro block. Just over 6 hours to go on abstract. 0055 minted. So this also has some music with it. Kind of fun. Very fun. That kind of reminds me a dub.
00:34:50.172 - 00:35:07.608, Speaker A: Doesn't that remind you of like the mad professor? Since we're talking about Devo, we can talk about the mad professor. I have a dub mix too. That's also from 2006. I'll bring that up at some point. That's cool. Kind of a dub beat there. Very interesting.
00:35:07.608 - 00:35:29.000, Speaker A: Plus, what is Gamma Ge two? I thought this was a nice animated abstraction. Just kind of cool and interesting as usual, would fill a room nicely. These works in the gallery, in my mind at least. Available for three Tezos edition of 20. Another Coda Nakazono. And I think this is new. Good.
00:35:29.000 - 00:35:58.224, Speaker A: April 24 filament number two. So maybe a new series here from Cota Nekazono. So that's interesting. Very cool and interesting, isn't it? Let's just take a very quick look here. There's filament number one already on secondary at 142, so maybe after 101 continuums, Coda wants to try something different. So here's number one. So very cool.
00:35:58.224 - 00:36:26.548, Speaker A: So let's see where this goes. Very cool. And another, this time the other one was burnt real time by MCHX. Look at how gorgeous this is. And look at real time web animation, HTML, GLsL and JavaScript. So like really, really, really nice here again, you know, could fill a room nicely. These works in the museum in my mind.
00:36:26.548 - 00:36:45.954, Speaker A: And so beautiful. Just really, really beautiful work here. Let's just see what you have to pay for. This edition of 22 have been transferred, none have been listed. So interesting. Here's another one by MCHX. Addition of two and one sale to not a number eight have been burned.
00:36:45.954 - 00:37:04.582, Speaker A: And here you go. So more just interesting abstraction from MCHX. Interesting, interesting. So real time software animation. And while we're on MCHX, I saw this as well. Remote happiness. And we missed this.
00:37:04.582 - 00:37:25.574, Speaker A: And this is just another interesting work because remember, a lot of the works kind of had a rothko feel, but these are. They're going in their own direction, clearly. So anyways, more interesting abstraction listed for only 0.1 on foundation. Doctor virgin with a beautiful work here. Pyramid scene twelve. I love the noise.
00:37:25.574 - 00:37:40.642, Speaker A: I love this kind of big pixel noise. We're finding the textures here. A beautiful pyramid piece here. Great color in everything. So this is looking great. Big shout out to doctor version. The texture and everything.
00:37:40.642 - 00:38:05.108, Speaker A: Very nice. Five tezos, five left. So very cool. Ex mortal lurker. So a close up of an eyeball here, which is pretty creepy, but not so much so. Anyways, very cool. And kind of, you know, some treatment here with processed with a fermata positronics, spectralume.
00:38:05.108 - 00:38:26.192, Speaker A: I wonder if that's what we were looking at the other day with the. When we saw the equipment. I think it was a spectralume. Here's Kuro with another piece, kind of an anime mixed with glitch and everything. Cool work. I love how the figure is just kind of covered with the noise on a layer. Just cool and good looking.
00:38:26.192 - 00:38:46.976, Speaker A: From Kuro. Buy for three tezos edition of three. And there are three left, so none have sold. So these are all available here. And another work by Teigenhoff. I'm enjoying watching this AI kind of remixed with kind of pixel, you know, with big dithering or some large pixel art. I wouldn't call it pixel art.
00:38:46.976 - 00:39:13.152, Speaker A: It's more dithering added to the scene. And so night vision at Simuragua, AI generated image edited and animated by Tiegenhof. So this is only two tezos and edition of five. Let's see if any are selling. And none have sold yet. So still available, but really cool series from my perspective. And speaking of AI collaboration.
00:39:13.152 - 00:39:35.152, Speaker A: So Ed Marolla, pixels over AI. There is, was, and will forever be love above all, always so beautiful. Ed's YouTube is doing very well. I think his Metallica video had something like 20,000 views or something. I think I just saw that on Twitter. So that is amazing. So big congrats to Ed.
00:39:35.152 - 00:40:00.548, Speaker A: So here's Ed using AI as a source and then saying it, which is interesting too. And so anyways, very interesting. And it's in a very kind of small series here. Where it's kind of AI art that he's been experimenting with here. So that is a one of one for 88 tezos. And how are we doing? We're going to finish a little earlier, so we're making progress here. Zio Siwa, a one of one.
00:40:00.548 - 00:40:31.354, Speaker A: So we were looking at Zio Siwa's work the other day. So anyways, another one has come out April 25, just this morning, April has zoomed by, hasn't it? And this sold for 35 tezos on secondary. Interestingly so first sold for 20 to Ernesto and then sold for 35. So is Ayo Siwa doing well? People are liking the painterliness. And here's another artist that could hang right nearby. Ilya Bliznetz, a young artist in a dormitory. AI and digital painting.
00:40:31.354 - 00:40:54.404, Speaker A: So I don't know if the last person art digital. I wonder if this is a combination or if it's all AI. So here's AI and digital painting. Nice piece by Ilya Bliznett and artist in the studio. And here's another one. And I'm pretty sure this is AI from ox. Oxloom.
00:40:54.404 - 00:41:18.484, Speaker A: And yeah, so this is going for only again, you make it low. People can't resist 0.05 ETH for this really cool work. Again, I'm pretty sure this is AI. So another way of using AI, just very softly, I think, almost for sure. And then playing with different little elements here within this work. So a lot of rainbow colors.
00:41:18.484 - 00:41:47.984, Speaker A: And moonchild just minted a work on Ethereum April 22 nymphology. So there it is. And another cool moonchild work on super rare. So that is cool. So good to see Moonchild's development here co created with AI. So co created post processing nami tamuna, also known as moonchild. So a mix of AI.
00:41:47.984 - 00:42:25.392, Speaker A: And you can tell who this is, AI and some sort of post processing. You can tell. That's what's cool about strange thing. Maybe it's the Louis Vuitton, but you can tell a strange thing without even seeing the name here. Patchwork schemas made in AI colorway inspired by Jan van Eyck. So, you know, that's interesting too, because you can probably use the remix command in midjourney, for example, and put maybe Van Eyck, who knows how. But it's cool that you can start to put a palette that is inspired by Jan van Eyck.
00:42:25.392 - 00:42:54.934, Speaker A: So that is super interesting. Patchwork clothing originated as a practical solution for peasants in the Renaissance to repair their garments using scraps of fabric. It evolved into a technique that became popular amongst the nobility. So patchwork. And here is a patchwork ski mask a la Louis Vietnam, courtesy of strange thing. And look at how convincing these are getting. In a year, it seems like you're gonna be able to replace the models here with AI models, Quilanina, if you want.
00:42:54.934 - 00:43:43.900, Speaker A: Some people might want the human unique quality, though, the ungeneric non AI model, because you can almost figure out the AI models to a certain degree. Anyways, Quillette, Nina, the musician, acrylic and digital painting here. So this is interesting because we've seen Nina do acrylic, really wonderful acrylic painter, and we've also seen her go into procreate and do purely digital. So now it looks like she's taking a acrylic work and then adding stuff in procreate. So, once again, we're starting to see this conflation of all techniques, digital and physical, and they are showing up on the screen at the final step. But kind of interesting to continue to watch this. Oli Izakovsky.
00:43:43.900 - 00:44:05.852, Speaker A: So, anyways, I started painting. So here is a painting by Oli Izikowski, and I believe this is all physical. So, anyways, it's looking pretty nice. It has a slight Kandinsky feel to it, but only slight. And nice textures here and everything. Nice color, cool, abstract. And so this is at auction for one tezos, and there's an addition of one, so you can still get that.
00:44:05.852 - 00:44:42.124, Speaker A: Let's just see how much time we have to get it. You have six days to make an offer here. So making it easy for us, Oli is Akoski. Very cool. And as we move more into three dimensional space here, yoa o Salazar with a homage to the thinker done out of plasticine. And so someone looking down at their laptop here, and then you see, like, a windows, a Mac screen here, some apples, and then a couple of pixels in the sky, and maybe some sort of color range thing going on here. Very, very interesting and cool.
00:44:42.124 - 00:45:11.436, Speaker A: A great contrast between this very physical and the digital. This is live on foundation, the thinker, and sells very well. Here's someone who is kind of like Venta, kind of like yo ao, but their own thing. Marcus, who I don't think I've seen before, Marcus Kuskas. And with, I think this is AI, but I'm not positive on that. And some almost sculptural looking work here. So, Marcus, what does it say? 3D Doodle maker.
00:45:11.436 - 00:45:28.994, Speaker A: So maybe it's not AI. This could be just like a 3d artist. Like, it's harder and harder. To tell. And here is some 3d art as well, a Martin Joe doing a tribute to uxine, the uxine cup coffee break number twelve. And let's see if we can get some volume here. It's pretty funny.
00:45:28.994 - 00:45:54.966, Speaker A: You see the computer here orbiting the prior and here are the security cameras with kind of a colors. So anyways, almost a grim reaper thing going on there. Pretty funny. So Martin Joe's coffee break available for one tazos and ten have sold. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is your show. Come join us on Twitter spaces tomorrow. It'll be a ton of fun.
00:45:54.966 - 00:45:58.444, Speaker A: Thank you for joining me. And until next time, take care.
