00:00:05.160 - 00:00:24.974, Speaker A: I wish it went louder. Welcome back, everybody, as we begin a new day with tons of time. I have so much time, it's ridiculous. We'll see how the show turns out. I think it's just as fine as ever. Life is ironic, isn't it? Sometimes doing less work is far more effective. We'll see.
00:00:24.974 - 00:01:01.974, Speaker A: Welcome back. Artist journal, April 3, 2024. Broadcasting from deep in inner space, see the sea before me, that sunlit sea in the middle of the day, that ethereal day. What time of day is that? What do you see? Do you see what I see? So all to say, welcome back. My name is Adrian Pokebelli, and again, the schedule. I am so excited. And the reason why I share, well, first of all, the reason I share this story is, first of all, that is the nature of this.
00:01:01.974 - 00:02:06.462, Speaker A: This is a journal. But I think it's a very helpful and illustrative example of how changing the structure, in a sense, the underlying assumptions, the presuppositions of how you go into work can really be, you know, again, to use a cliche, a game changer. Again, I keep coming back to what I call that Copernican revolution, where I was working on paintings for a year, and then all of a sudden I decided, forget it, I'm finishing a work in the next 24 hours. And then I went, eh, kind of like that piece, and my life changed forever. And so it's just an important lesson in terms of life is ironic, right? And you can spend all this time, it's sort of like, you know, they say work smart, right? You know, doesn't necessarily mean you need to work 18 hours a day on your thing and then it'll be the best. That's not necessarily the case. Right.
00:02:06.462 - 00:02:27.890, Speaker A: This is a myth. Right. Sometimes it's better to actually keep it shorter. For me, I'm having more fun as I prepare this because then it's just like, you know, I'm kind of back to, again, we're going back to the roots here. This is not a news channel. Therefore, I don't need to make sure I keep up with every little thing. This is a journal.
00:02:27.890 - 00:03:22.224, Speaker A: And that's where this started. And interestingly, and again, I share this because I hope maybe it's helpful to other parts of your life as I continue my journey as an artist, because this show, to a certain degree, started encroaching more and more onto the art. And all of a sudden this morning, as well as the other day when, you know, the last show, which, frankly, got more of a response on x, let's say, as one metric than the previous show did, that was an hour and a half. And me putting all this work in extra work, maybe an hour or two more of work, you know, doesn't necessarily get the same response. And then you have to. So this is important. This is an important kind of lesson here, right? So that's why I share it, you know, and I'm all about the process because, of course, you know, some people have called this a work of art of mine, this show.
00:03:22.224 - 00:04:22.150, Speaker A: And to a certain degree, it is. It's very much a similar situation. I have a process, right. I go into that process, and however I'm feeling, whatever day I, you know, and it's, you know, I have a deadline which is Monday, Wednesday, Friday, I'm tightening the deadline where now it's like, okay, you basically have an hour to prepare this show and an hour to execute it, right? And I think that's great, and that's kind of exciting. And again, a shorter show may benefit everyone, as I've mentioned before, all to say, I, you know, there's a lesson as I approach this show that can be applied to the art. And just finally, on this point, so this morning, you know, I had these works ready to go. I went for a coffee and came, came, came back rather than, and so I could do some art and making, you know, working on the TR 707, an inspiration from the last episode, seeing the Oscar Peterson.
00:04:22.150 - 00:04:53.200, Speaker A: And I think I'm going to do a, I want to do a homage to that ad. I'm staking my claim on that ad right now. I mean, everybody do what you want out there, but I want to do a work on that Oscar Peterson ad, an idea that came to me today. We shall see how it turns out. I've been doing a ton of work, again behind the scenes, but just another kind of final example here. So kind of a happier person. Not that I was so unhappy before, but wouldn't you be happier if you had an extra couple hours in your day and you're doing less work? Right.
00:04:53.200 - 00:05:28.328, Speaker A: And again, the jury's out. Let's see how this show turns out. But all to say there, I'm making art, and this is kind of where I'm going with this whole conversation. One of the things I want to say is this show kind of encroached more in my life because all of a sudden it's like, hey, people seem to like this. However many people and whatever small group, there are a few people out there that enjoy this show. So for me, as an artist, which is kind of an affordable, you could argue, a form of entertainment. It's like, oh, people are actually being entertained by what I'm doing here.
00:05:28.328 - 00:05:59.874, Speaker A: And therefore, you know, that's something that should be nurtured and not just, you know, dismissed and whatever. And so I have. But as I kind of, as the focus kind of shifted to the show, it kind of left the art a little bit behind. Some of you might wonder, well, this guy's an artist. There's not exactly a huge output here, and there is actually quite a bit going on behind the scenes. But it's a fair point. And it's not untrue in the sense that it has encroached on the art making.
00:05:59.874 - 00:06:58.664, Speaker A: So here I am this morning, making art. Right? So all to say, it's always worth, you know, questioning your underlying assumptions and what you're doing, in a sense, you know, just as I like to wonder as I look out in the world and, you know, the news and everything, you know, in a sense, the underlying question of it all that you're trying to answer when you read the news is, what is going on? What exactly is going on here? And in a sense, it's important that we do the same with ourselves. Like, what exactly am I doing here? Question your assumptions. Question your presuppositions. It may have a, you know, a huge impact on how you move forward. And I think I'm saying something that everybody knows, but there's nothing like a real world example to basically kind of make the point as you. If you watch this show, then you kind of see, oh, okay.
00:06:58.664 - 00:07:19.376, Speaker A: You know, maybe there's a couple of errors here and there, but it's basically the same show. One could argue, maybe I like that show better. The last show. So all to say, enough on the meta of the show here is rinnefish. Let's get going here before this turns into an hour and a half show. And I have to eat all my words. So let's go with runyfish here.
00:07:19.376 - 00:07:42.258, Speaker A: Let's see if I can get the volume. Let's see if I can hit play. And there it is. Look at the gorgeous colors on this work. This beautiful work, I think, on Zora. This beautiful, beautiful work by rinifish out of China. A psychedelic work, one could argue.
00:07:42.258 - 00:08:24.594, Speaker A: These translucent pastels, kind of alien, kind of embryonic. And this very interesting kind of beautiful audio. Almost sounds like synth. You know, the noise with the LFO, the noise oscillator, if you know your analog synths. And again, this stunningly gorgeous color. And again, this psychedelic pastels is how I would describe this. These are almost the kinds of, of, you know, pastels you would see on a deep psychedelic experience when you are inside the alien spaceship.
00:08:24.594 - 00:08:40.038, Speaker A: So perhaps this is what's happening here. So gorgeous work. Let's see what happened here. Let me just, you know, just little tiny. I'm almost delighting in these little errors, like the window not being open here. So 47, minted already. And just.
00:08:40.038 - 00:08:57.258, Speaker A: And there's cedar plank actually singing the praises here. There's stalka Jacob. No. Hygiene guru, guru hyena. Our wonderful family here, our wonderful large digital art family online. So here it is, 47. Minted in only three days.
00:08:57.258 - 00:09:25.494, Speaker A: I mean, that's probably over a $100 already. The power of Zora. And just a gorgeous work. So congratulations to Winnie fish organ trip. Very interesting title again, it kind of looks like embryo, doesn't it? But it also looks like maybe it's the inside of a body. Maybe this is a body, maybe these are organs here. And this is literally the.
00:09:25.494 - 00:09:56.578, Speaker A: The embryo of a kind of body here. Who knows? Maybe a stream of consciousness work, kind of an expression we're using more and more here as a way of working, one assumes. And look at these interesting three people here. You know, rinnefish, you can really zoom in, unfortunately, on Zora with a video, I can't zoom in, but you can zoom in. Like any one of these could have been a work unto themselves. Any one of these little areas here. And look at these great little fish here.
00:09:56.578 - 00:10:22.238, Speaker A: Kind of almost these hieronymous Bosch like fish characters here. Just a beautiful, beautiful work. The stunningly talented rhinifish Oregon trip. And this is from, I think, a series called Magic Ways. So very exciting. Let me fix the screen here. So today I'm very pleased to welcome unknown collector to the spaces who will join Rune tune and I.
00:10:22.238 - 00:11:03.072, Speaker A: And I think it's actually a wonderful time to catch up with unknown collector. This is the second time that unknown collector is going to be on the show and I feel like a lot's happened. Like, I'm curious to actually ask, you see, as I like to call them, just about Farcaster, for example, or warpcast, I guess I should call it the social media network and just, you know, taking the temperature from unknown collector's point of view on what's happening. Come join Rune tune and myself. Should be a good one. And yeah, so that starts at 330 central european time, 930 New York time. So in just three and a half hours here, I'm drowning in time.
00:11:03.072 - 00:11:36.444, Speaker A: I am absolutely loving it. How strange is that? Turning to our comments here, turning to our comments, John Cates, we just recorded the jam is also an ethic from the 1970s, analog video art, new media, and digital art communities. So the idea of these histories, of how we work with the machines is very important. Very interesting. So we just recorded the jam as also an ethic. Right. So I was discussing future, and actually I brought up the Wikipedia of future because I had a bit more time.
00:11:36.444 - 00:12:04.280, Speaker A: And so we're actually going to just look a little bit more on future, just who was involved and everything. A little bit of Wikipedia on that. So very interesting. So this kind of improvisation and what I was mentioning about future is who was it? It was Pierre. DJ Pierre was in future. Okay, for those that know their acid house, and I kind of know it somewhat, but I couldn't list you all the people who are in it. Of course I've heard of DJ Pierre.
00:12:04.280 - 00:12:46.552, Speaker A: Did I know DJ Pierre was in future? Maybe, kind of, but not really. And this is how they made this historic work, which is seen as kind of a pioneering work that pioneered a whole kind of music paradigm that is sometimes called acid house. Again, using the TB 303 Roland bassline machine and, you know, mucking around with it, you could argue a glitch technique using it in ways that were kind of not supposed to be used. You could see it as a kind of glitch. Interestingly. And here's John Cates, renowned glitch artist. We just recorded the jam, is also an ethic from 1970s analog video art, new media.
00:12:46.552 - 00:13:06.740, Speaker A: I wonder if they still call it that. And digital art communities. So very interesting, this idea of improvisation, what I'm also calling stream of consciousness, right. And everything. So very interesting to hear that, John. All these worlds, weirdly, are colliding here. PP Universal great show, Adrian.
00:13:06.740 - 00:13:36.246, Speaker A: Thanks for your hard work. You are more than welcome and thrilled to hear from you, as ever. PP keep up the great work. John Cates, awesome to see your excitement with the new time limitations and constraints. You know, it's almost like this, right, like this show that is basically what I'm doing here. I am just recording this jam, right? And so I am loving it, to be honest. So isn't that interesting? So we'll see where it goes from here.
00:13:36.246 - 00:14:12.034, Speaker A: It's kind of back to the roots a little bit and, you know, and every journey kind of has its purpose that you learn from. But so far, again, I feel like a rebirth of the art side of myself because all of a sudden, you know, having an extra hour or two in the day can really, you know, add some time to your art making possibilities here. And just one final thing. It can work as a kind of positive feedback loop. Because, say, using the example of this show. So all of a sudden, if I shorten the prep time. That means the show probably isn't going to be as long.
00:14:12.034 - 00:14:30.200, Speaker A: That means as the file isn't going to be as big. So maybe I don't need to compress it, which takes 20 minutes. Which means, oh, maybe I don't need. Then uploading it is also shorter. So again, it's like this positive feedback loop. And all of a sudden I'm done. And I'm like, wow, this is like how it was when I started.
00:14:30.200 - 00:14:43.650, Speaker A: You know, when I started, it was actually 15 to 20 minutes. I remember when it went to half an hour. And that was a big deal. Right? We're probably. We're already at 15 minutes here. I thought we'd maybe even be at half an hour already. Time does fly when we are having fun here.
00:14:43.650 - 00:14:59.378, Speaker A: So anyways, indeed, the excitement is palpable. John Louise Andre Gamma. Amazing video, as always. Thank you. Score. Also known as Saiko. Thank you so much for reviewing the exhibition by Artpoint.
00:14:59.378 - 00:15:16.590, Speaker A: Of course, that was, I believe, in Tokyo. A few people told me the screen would be great for the TESL exhibition. That is hilarious. So, of course, on the column, there was a circular screen. Something I see at the mall here. For those in Berlin, at Eastside Mall. They have these screens that go around like the columns there.
00:15:16.590 - 00:15:26.774, Speaker A: And I was like, maybe it will happen in the future. So kind of perfect for tezpool, actually. Hilariously so. Thank you for the comment. Psycho. Murlakos. Excellent show.
00:15:26.774 - 00:15:49.808, Speaker A: Thank you. And great to see you on Tezos again, Murlakos. Great to see your work. So the model, of course, a musician who releases a lot of glitch works kind of, as with the music, you could say, on Tezos. Well, I did really enjoy. Well, I did really enjoy today's broadcast, as I put in a comment. Because House of the model was saying, you know, what a great title of the last show.
00:15:49.808 - 00:16:05.388, Speaker A: You know, vintage. Vintage software, like vintage synths. Question. And I was saying, if there's any show that that was for you. It was. It was that show. With all of the synth knowledge that house the model, has.
00:16:05.388 - 00:16:35.160, Speaker A: Well, I did really enjoy today's broadcast. The uninformed use of machines, interestingly, is something of a way of life for me. From my Korg MS 20, another classic. And my Panasonic MX 20 I don't know if I know that one. I might have to look that up. There seems to be something consistent or familiar to me and my openness to surprises in the pursuit of an idea or feeling. Maybe this is just how the art life goes across the mediums from sound to visions and back.
00:16:35.160 - 00:17:13.504, Speaker A: It is certainly part of how the glitch art community feels like home now, I think. Is that everything? Let me just make sure as we continue to improvise here, let me just make sure we have the full sometimes sometimes if I make the screen larger. There you go. Thank you. Sometimes if I make the screen larger, then I'll miss some of the comments there. So again, thank you for the awesome comment there, host of the model and glad you enjoyed it. And thanks for dropping the gear, the kit as they call it, I believe in England.
00:17:13.504 - 00:17:31.126, Speaker A: John Kate's apple iie soft spot. Indeed, indeed, indeed. And Rada Yankee first. And just wonderful to hear from you Raddha. And we have a wonderful work by Rada in this show. The pirate ship is done and it looks fabulous. Something to look forward to.
00:17:31.126 - 00:17:49.810, Speaker A: A small preview also on Twitter. And again, thank you for the response here. You know, they've been strangling a little bit, the reach and it's still doing. I'm still like, wow, this is still doing pretty good. So I'm kind of excited by. So again, thank you for the response everybody and all the support. A lot of bookmarks there.
00:17:49.810 - 00:17:59.454, Speaker A: Medal on. Thank you. Edmar Ola love the title. We'll have to wait until tonight to watch. Awesome. And we have a beautiful work by Ed Marolla this episode. I'm a troz.
00:17:59.454 - 00:18:13.082, Speaker A: Thank you for the comment, braindead. And we have a moving comment by Braindead coming up here. Great to hear from you braindead. Take care. That really tragic story we'll see in a second. Denise Sanchez art great episode. Congrats.
00:18:13.082 - 00:18:30.344, Speaker A: Thank you. And Oxdk, that's cool. So important credit here. Thank you for reviewing some of the pieces that I collected. And of course this sunset is the great work of the great pixel artist RGB. Zero x Zero Zero. Also known as RGB.
00:18:30.344 - 00:19:10.532, Speaker A: Quite a few followers there. I take Sun Studio account. So this work here, this pixel artwork with the sunset is actually RGB, just so you know. So thank you for sharing that Cedar plank, also known as Sister Waffle Software with a goodies tab is a great indicator of fun to be had. Coincidentally, I was record shopping last week and at the checkout counter, Kristen's record, Kristen Roose who we started the show with was one of the staff picks of the month and the title was universal synthesizer interface. So interesting, interesting. The world's continue to collide here.
00:19:10.532 - 00:19:52.674, Speaker A: This interesting comparison between vintage synths and vintage software. And of course Kristin Roose seems to have a foot in both. Interestingly, and I remember now that, you know, Cedar Plank has mentioned that Kristen Roose has some music. I remember it jogs my memory, but I didn't realize that or I wouldn't have remembered had you not posted this. And here, if you go to the comments, you'll find even a YouTube of some of Kristen's music. I'm a little hesitant to play for copyright reasons, but just a quick little. So just kind of cool.
00:19:52.674 - 00:20:13.744, Speaker A: So I had no idea. Indeed. Pixel lord, these are tasty pixels. Referring of course to Kristin Roose's brilliant work here. This photo of the screen just awesome. Glad you enjoyed it. Pl and Pl is going to be on a spaces sometime soon telling us about plS ordinals experience.
00:20:13.744 - 00:20:29.884, Speaker A: Started his own collection. Actually did quite well selling it. Has had some success with ordinals there, so I absolutely cannot wait for that show. It's probably in about a month. Skulltakes great episode. Money is not the only reason. I think people are flocking to warpcast warpcaster.
00:20:29.884 - 00:20:54.982, Speaker A: A lot of us feel the X algo has put us into a bit of a rut, both with being discovered and discovering new artists. I have noticed it. I think this is real, this idea that x, for whatever reason. I don't know if it's like if you're in the crypto community, I don't know what the reason is. Maybe it's. But the algo does seem to have changed. So I do understand the need to go somewhere and just try different things.
00:20:54.982 - 00:21:24.582, Speaker A: The way warpcaster channels organize the flow of info makes it feel less noisy, more focused, and more intentional. And I think, you know, I am going to post this show. I should probably post the last shows too, but I am going to start posting on Warpcaster here. I'm not going to be a stick in the mud about this, right? And I have posted, and it's actually done fairly well. And it's not like, you know, so I just think it's a good place if you. It's very crypto focused. Let's put it this way.
00:21:24.582 - 00:22:16.392, Speaker A: I think you need to have a metamask, just for example, to, you know, log in, or at least to really kind of get the experience of warpcast Warpcaster. So let's, let's just finish skulltakes comment here. The money is great, don't get me wrong, and helps you put with the the day to day technical glitches, glitches of the growing and helps you put up with the day to day technical glitches of the growing platform. But I think people are just ready to switch it up. And probably what I'll do is a bit of an all of the above philosophy, which is I'll probably just start incorporating it a bit more into my day and maybe that'll take, you know, 10% of my ex time away. So thank you for the comment there, and thank you for sharing that. That is the sense I get that people do genuinely like the experience a little more.
00:22:16.392 - 00:22:56.654, Speaker A: I still need to figure out the frames, but I think there's great motive, and especially as artists, it seems like you would have to be crazy not to be on Warpcaster. It seems like people are doing very well, and I feel like the community itself is rewarding artists for putting their work on Warpcaster. I think there's a bit of that going on there, too, and that sentiment doesn't last forever. So, as I always say, like, artists should be very business oriented. So if you see an opportunity, we saw it was Solana a little while ago. I still have a work, actually, I'm going to put on Solana hopefully quite soon here. Just kind of 95% there, but that last 5% I'm struggling with.
00:22:56.654 - 00:23:16.256, Speaker A: But all to say, opportunity knocks and you kind of got to go strike while the iron is hot. So thank you for the comment. Eternity human art loaded down with cool, cool art. Thank you. Eternity. Amazing episode, amazing artworks from XP Quizzle. Thank you.
00:23:16.256 - 00:23:24.856, Speaker A: And vintage sense. And there we go. So just awesome. Oxdk. Thank you. Vec and AI. That creates 12,000 Los Marcos.
00:23:24.856 - 00:23:51.246, Speaker A: Congrats on your features. So that, of course, is the great Marlacos. Also here, just some interesting pieces. Very quickly, we got a new one here in the community. So again, if you are interested in getting on the show or if you just want to share your work with people, get it more out there. This is one place you can post it. And so you can just join the artist journal community.
00:23:51.246 - 00:24:10.052, Speaker A: You just go to my profile here. Let me just show you how to get there. If I can get there. And there it is, just right there. You click on that, and here you will see. You can just leave your work. Sienna digital abstract painting by Olivia Hartig.
00:24:10.052 - 00:24:29.740, Speaker A: So interesting piece. You know, it's getting harder and harder to tell the AI artwork. This looks like it's not. But Santiago will look at it next show. Put out this like art scene on object and it's. It looks like an art scene. I mean, it's pretty wild in terms of the painterliness.
00:24:29.740 - 00:25:02.552, Speaker A: It looks like something you'd find in a bookstore. Anyways, we'll get to that next episode. But the brush strokes on it were incredible. All to say, this looks like a digital work is what I'm assuming. But again, worlds are colliding here between physical AI digital paintbrushes. Like everything is kind of colliding and maybe at the end of it we just walk out with one genre perhaps, maybe unlikely, but just kind of interesting. It does seem like everything is kind of mixing into each other Suzelyang to wait for something to happen.
00:25:02.552 - 00:25:19.952, Speaker A: Like a stone. Now, I wonder if we already saw this one. Did we already see this? I feel like I may have even showed this work in a previous episode. Anyway, cool work here. And there was actually a ton printed shared here. So this is from skull takes. And great to hear from you.
00:25:19.952 - 00:25:37.722, Speaker A: Skull takes. So very cool work. And actually, let's look very quickly here. Misprinted postcards in the North California coast heavily influenced this work. I photograph myself in a paper skull mask and collage the images over AI. I then draw over the image and apply digital effects. Ten to 1090s.
00:25:37.722 - 00:25:58.120, Speaker A: How cool is that? And there we see the drawing over. So again, just all sorts of stuff going on. Worlds are colliding here. So very cool work. Thank you for sharing. Filippo Francocci, great to hear from you. I think this is in the AI painting section, which is almost becoming a bit of its own kind of new area there.
00:25:58.120 - 00:26:16.264, Speaker A: Martin Jo, we're going to see this work later in the program. Thank you for posting. We're going to see this cura work, this brilliant work. Love the minimalism of this. This is on foundation using base and more. So I'm going to speed through here. Yacht, a renowned artist on super rare if I am not mistaken.
00:26:16.264 - 00:26:42.980, Speaker A: Thank you for sharing this in the community. Awesome to hear from you. And very cool piece here that is on manifold and I believe with bass. So of course now this we're also gonna see later in the episode here. So again, Ernesto osh Adobe Firefly AI, interestingly, which I haven't used, and photo mosh, which I believe is a glitch technique. Pretty rad. And as you see in district 468.
00:26:42.980 - 00:26:59.406, Speaker A: And actually this will be in the AI section too. So I kind of, you know, pick a few here to come in. As you can see, I mean, what a wonderful community this is. And this one, too. So it is. And John Kates, wait till you see the next post here. This is his friend Eva Z.
00:26:59.406 - 00:27:16.714, Speaker A: Eva here in Taiwan. So this is on object two. So all to say psycho futurist with more awesome work. That last one from yesterday I absolutely loved as well. Okay, nart. So it's getting pretty busy on here. You can have a show.
00:27:16.714 - 00:27:41.014, Speaker A: So we're gonna speed through here. But thank you, everybody. And we looked at this work here. Thank you, everybody, for sharing your work on. And this is the best way to do it. Again, if you're trying to, for whatever reason, if you feel you want to have some join the fun here, post it here, and then I will do what I can to include. And, you know, it's kind of an ongoing thing.
00:27:41.014 - 00:28:12.664, Speaker A: Just because I don't post something one day doesn't mean, you know, three days later or two weeks later, all of a sudden, one of your works appears out of nowhere. It just gets on my radar. Should that be something you're interested in rather than the private messages? It's just a better way. I like the transparency of it. So, continuing on, cedar plank. So we've been following this interesting, fascinating artist for how long now? Maybe a year. The show's been going for a year and eight months.
00:28:12.664 - 00:28:43.014, Speaker A: Let's call it a year and couple of months. And we've seen the account change from hasdrubal waffle to Cedar plank to kujib. We have a update here. Addendum. Cedar Plank was my second best account yet, my second worst performing account outside of Kujeb, which remains the best worst title holder. So we wave goodbye to Cedar as doodle conduit. And welcome back Hasdrubal waffle for the first of the base mints tonight.
00:28:43.014 - 00:29:00.406, Speaker A: So, of course. Ooh, tonight. When was this posted? Let me get my wallet. This was posted yesterday. I'm gonna have to go to that website. I put. You know, I debated whether I should share Waffles website on the last show because it was sort of like, if you want to see my works, this is where you go.
00:29:00.406 - 00:29:34.916, Speaker A: It's gonna disappear. And I thought, should I share this? And I thought, well, just from. To make this show as awesome as possible, I want this to be on here because that's, like, great. You know, if you like waffles work, which we do over here, that'll be great content for this show. So all to say, maybe time to reload that website if you are a collector. And there is that the great waffles, a portrait of waffles with the classic kind of mustache, nose and glasses there. So anyways, let's continue here.
00:29:34.916 - 00:30:08.750, Speaker A: Big shout out to John Cates, who just sent me this. This was just posted, which is my interview with Calo and where John Cates wrote this beautiful article, Adrian Pokebelly in Glitch art. And it was quite beautiful to read this. So go check it out. I will try. And you know where I'm going to post it? I'm going to post it in the community here. Just very quickly, I always say I'm going to post the links in the community, but I never do it.
00:30:08.750 - 00:30:44.492, Speaker A: And for people, sometimes people are like, I don't know how to post in the community. This is how you do it. You post here and then you'll see up here it's, you can choose to be, if you do it while you're on the artist journal page, that's how you post in the community. So use the same post button, but you just kind of, you can decide if you want to be in just the community where I'll say artist journal or everywhere. Big thanks to John Cates for writing this wonderful piece. So you can read it. You can read it here if you go to the community.
00:30:44.492 - 00:31:15.034, Speaker A: And it's really nice and just kind of fun and interesting. So let's put that there and here. And so, yes, so I want to put more into the community. And so here, this, as we continue to build this airplane in midair, is what we're doing here. So how wonderful is this? And there it is, published. So let's go back. Oh, we just closed future here.
00:31:15.034 - 00:31:30.234, Speaker A: We can't do that. Okay. So big thank you to John Cates. And there's actually quite a bit of interesting content in here. So again, mentions the community even and everything. So again, just big shout out. And look at this.
00:31:30.234 - 00:31:47.072, Speaker A: I think this one might be my favorite. This one. John Cates did different glitches here of a screenshot of the show. This one I found particularly poetic. So again, just big shout out and thank you to John. And here's another one. So that's on John's Patreon.
00:31:47.072 - 00:32:27.020, Speaker A: Again, if you want to find the link, just go to the community there now, future, since we had a little more time or I had a little more time preparing the show, I wanted to talk about future or just get a little bit more background because I didn't actually know that much. I didn't realize I kind of vaguely knew or thought I knew they were at the start of acid house. But I didn't really know just how important they were. Till I saw that Instagram reel of DJ Pierre the other day. And so let's just get a bit of background here. Future is an american house group from Chicago. Founded in 1985 that early by Earl Spanky Smith junior Nathaniel Pierre Jones.
00:32:27.020 - 00:32:51.490, Speaker A: Aka DJ Pierre and Herbert Herb Jackson. The group is famous for inventing, inventing and defining the sound of acid house. A subgenre of house music. With their 1987 release acid tracks. So it came out in 87. So they were together for two years. Before they stumbled upon acid house again.
00:32:51.490 - 00:33:10.258, Speaker A: By taking the 303 and misusing. By misusing the 303, the tb 303. If you don't know what that is, check last episode. And let's just read a couple more lines here. Future seminal acid tracks is considered to be the first acid house record. And credited for inventing and defining the genre. I didn't know.
00:33:10.258 - 00:33:29.036, Speaker A: I feel like I should know this. The twelve minute instrumental composition was released on tracks records in 1987. And I have heard of tracks. Originally it was recorded to tape and played by DJ Ron Hardy. I mean, that's how we used to do it. I'm old enough. Where my first little recordings were put on a tape.
00:33:29.036 - 00:33:48.510, Speaker A: Even a little mini. Mini tape recorder that had a minidisc. And played by DJ Ron Hardy at the Chicago nightclub music box. Supposedly already in 1985. Its characteristic acid sound was derived utilizing the TB 303 based synthesizer. In a very particular way. Using tone sequences modulated in real time.
00:33:48.510 - 00:34:08.394, Speaker A: To produce a certain resonant and squelchy sound. Which since then is associated with the genre. The track also, and this was a surprise. And I mentioned this last episode, the track also utilized a Roland TR 707. There it is. And a Roland TR 727 drum machines. So we'll leave it there.
00:34:08.394 - 00:34:26.666, Speaker A: But I started, you know. So the work that I was working on today. Again, I'm working on this synth series. Very kind of pixel art. Which I can get very low, low file sizes. So maybe to put on bitcoin. I was like, oh, I haven't done the TR 707.
00:34:26.666 - 00:34:42.938, Speaker A: The TR 707 doesn't get its due, I would argue in large. And it sounds great. The bass drum and everything. So I just thought, kind of interesting. So I was working on a 707 today. And it's a good looking machine as well. Let's continue on.
00:34:42.938 - 00:35:01.724, Speaker A: So that is future. Just following up on last episode. Jamie Gurlay. Just an interesting comment. If there is an antithesis to New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. Also known as the Met. It is probably Solana since day one of verse and Jamie Gourlay building verse works and exhibition space for digital art.
00:35:01.724 - 00:35:29.752, Speaker A: So maybe one of the founders of verse, if not the founder since day one of verse. A common concern we've heard from gallery world artists is that doing an NFT is just too risky, maybe from a political point of view. I always forget, just like, the animosity towards what we're doing here, which I find Bizarre, is just how I would characterize it. Let's continue. The way things work here is not how it's done in the art world. And the stigma is real. Yeah.
00:35:29.752 - 00:36:00.320, Speaker A: So interesting. Reputational damage is a legitimate concern. I mean, uh, you know what I thought in the middle of the night when I woke up and I actually wrote it down, you know, art is freedom. Like, art is an exercising your freedom. You're not even trapped by your own body, right? You can do anything, right? Like, not like there's. You're only limited by your imagination. What you're limited to is basically your brain, your eyes, and your arm.
00:36:00.320 - 00:36:31.346, Speaker A: As long as that's all working, you're basically good to go, at least on digital. And so it's really an exercise of freedom. So it's quite interesting when you start running into issues of, you know, oh, I got to be careful about this. You start to lose your freedom to a certain degree. Even as my schedule got tighter and tighter, it's like a loss. That's why I think I'm so happy. It's like I'm reasserting my freedom to a certain degree as I kind of streamline this show a little bit.
00:36:31.346 - 00:36:53.606, Speaker A: Right? And it'll probably make a better show. Let's see, let's see. Soon, though, nearly two years into our journey, we'll be presenting our first major project by a gallery world trailblazer. The artist in question is Tabor Robach. You know, kind of. I don't want to say just getting started on Twitter, but, you know, not a huge account. Interestingly, Tabor's works are housed, which is common for people from the art scene.
00:36:53.606 - 00:37:33.204, Speaker A: Tabor's works are housed in the MoMA, the Met, the Whitney, and numerous other museums worldwide. He has shown with top galleries, and his work has been covered by endless art publications. His career spans more than 100 exhibitions in 23 countries, and he's not even 40. And now he is just releasing an NFT series. But doing so on Solana with a supply of 4000. Tabor isn't just getting involved with nfTs, he's jumping in the deep end of shark infested water with his hands tied together. But you know, for all of this discussion of how rough and tumble the NFT scene is, it's a heck of a lot friendlier, I would argue, than the contemporary art scene to generalize.
00:37:33.204 - 00:38:13.844, Speaker A: And I know a lot of wonderful people in the contemporary art scene. But all to say, I've made more sales, like it's not even close. In the digital space, the NFT space, I've made a billion more, I guess, digital friends at least. And I've just gotten much more positive relationships, shall we say. And it doesn't mean it doesn't happen outside, but for all of the reputation of this being the casino and shark infested waters, this is a very friendly place. Actually, when you put it all into perspective, it doesn't need to be for the Internet, for the crypto scene, I'd call it a pretty friendly place. Is it perfect? Absolutely not.
00:38:13.844 - 00:38:33.278, Speaker A: Below I'll outline a bit of Tabor in his work. And importantly too, broken printer's release mechanics. Cool title. There's also a link to the artwork at the end. We hope you love it. So all to say, I think this is it. And what really stood out to me were actually these brushstrokes over top of this image.
00:38:33.278 - 00:38:58.260, Speaker A: And I quite like that. It looks like a Led Zeppelin logo here. Not sure if this is from an album or something, so I'm not sure. And here's the release details. $40 each. Solana 4000. I mean, I think this is one thing, though, that people from the Tradart world do need to be careful of, which is, I don't know if I would recommend putting out a 4000.
00:38:58.260 - 00:39:44.584, Speaker A: Maybe this all does fabulously, okay. Maybe this all just sells out and you make your. How much would that be? You make your $160,000. But I think you have to be careful of kind of parachuting in a la Marina Abramovich, uh, you know, last bull run, parachuting in and taking a bunch of money. And then without kind of building up a little bit of credibility, frankly, in the scene and just going on all this other social proof, uh, you know, so I think it's. And maybe Jamie Gurlay has released or, or, sorry, maybe this artist has released a lot of works before and has their own following, I don't know, in the digital scene. But I think you have to be careful kind of.
00:39:44.584 - 00:40:07.552, Speaker A: Again, if you haven't done that, I wouldn't recommend putting out a 10,000 at $40 each. And then trying to, you know, get $160,000 payday. But who knows? Anyways, best of luck to them. This was quite moving. Brain dead. So, wow. Tears streaming down my cheeks when I saw Burka Byram's art page on sloth zine's April issue.
00:40:07.552 - 00:40:26.114, Speaker A: And here it is. Let me just show it to you. It is quite a moving work. Ungrateful. It's called by burka Bayram, you know, tazo's OG. Here we have this guy beating up the little person, this person being worried, this person intervening. Say, stop beating up the little person.
00:40:26.114 - 00:41:12.534, Speaker A: Little person getting mad at the nice person, trying to intervene, and then beating up the nice person or punching the nice person. This is exactly as braindead is saying here. What happened to me? We heard this story a couple of days after it happened. Braindead actually released a kind of beautiful, like, masterpiece pixel artwork right around that time. This is exactly what happened to me. In a month later, here I am still eating my food through a straw, and I can hardly sleep at night because of the pain. So if you don't remember the story or didn't see the show, Braindead saw a fight going on, and I tried to do the right thing and stop it and ended up getting his jaw broken.
00:41:12.534 - 00:41:34.292, Speaker A: And here he is, you know, a month later, I'm still eating my food out of a straw. I can hardly sleep at night. I mean, that is just a heart wrenching story. So, you know, tears. I don't doubt this. So I'll just say, let's just see what it says here. All my earnings over the last few weeks is going towards my medications and treatment.
00:41:34.292 - 00:42:04.524, Speaker A: So if you purchased any of my works during this process, I want you to know that you have done unknown. That you have unknowingly done me a great favor. So go support Braindead is the moral of the story here. Go support braindead. I mean, could you imagine? And jawbroken. Okay, so speaking of Braindead, also known as right click dead, this is the work by Braindead in sloth scenes, April issue. And again, a pixel artist here.
00:42:04.524 - 00:42:32.810, Speaker A: So, as you can see, just a cool work. So check that out and everything. Just a really cool pixel artist go by Braindead, or right click dead's work. Axing also contributing. And this looks like, interestingly, it looks like a fragments from a painting. So a kind of interesting reuse, kind of Aladdin control a little bit, but breaking it up into panels. Beautiful panels, I might add.
00:42:32.810 - 00:42:55.964, Speaker A: You are the token. It's like you are the product you are the token referring, I believe, to all these meme coins. And here are the people, the people getting crushed and turned into money. It's almost like all your money is getting taken. You are the token, maybe referring to this meme coin season by xing. So pretty cool. Axin, of course, a master of the zine.
00:42:55.964 - 00:43:22.620, Speaker A: And of course, I follow uxine. That is an x glitch. For whatever reason, x sometimes does that. So all to say, check out sloth scene. Is it sloth scene is sloth? Yeah, at Slothscene that is available now. Demon ego also showing just a little bit of how small demon ego can work. So just a pretty nice work here.
00:43:22.620 - 00:43:49.898, Speaker A: Nice kind of collage work. Again, showing the physical look at how delightfully small this is. There's something to be said about small work. I remember seeing a small Warhol that was like this. And as I like to say, Warhol was a great designer of art. Like he knew how to create that preciousness and excitement and just that je ne sais quoi that makes an art piece feel precious and special. And this just kind of has that.
00:43:49.898 - 00:44:14.712, Speaker A: So small can be really fun and precious, too. Sometimes it gets overlooked. Martin Bruce GM and I just wanted to highlight this. So here's another look at Martin Bruce's gallery show, I think exhibition. It's just another example of how really revolutionary this artist is. I mean, it looks like some sort of trunk here, and it's painted like a Martin Bruce painting. I mean, a very far out artist.
00:44:14.712 - 00:44:46.264, Speaker A: I mean, consistently upsetting expectations. And, you know, the more you consume art, the more art is a part of your daily life, the more you appreciate people who are consistently upsetting expectations. So just beautiful work from Martin Bruce. And you have to look at this NUV 1914 movie Miento, number one edition of two. I picked up the second one. Just gorgeous work here. NUV 1914.
00:44:46.264 - 00:45:11.628, Speaker A: Trying something a little different. And wow, is it working. And look at this awesome almost border here as you see this gray border going around here. And there's almost figure made of these really nice circles. So a little bit of a different technique here, a little bit of experimentation, but still recognizably. NUV 19. Fourteen's.
00:45:11.628 - 00:45:23.532, Speaker A: I thought the color here, too. And this beautiful purple and black. There's a flower and a person. Just. What a composition. What a piece. What a piece.
00:45:23.532 - 00:45:50.084, Speaker A: We just started the other day with NUV 1914, but the temptation, my friends, was there. Dan Control, mailman. So here we see Dan control doing one of his animal works. A massive work here. With the gradient tool. And here we see giraffe. And I really love the background there with just sky and which makes perfect sense as the giraffe is quite a tall character.
00:45:50.084 - 00:46:08.212, Speaker A: And another beautiful addition here. Interesting title. Not sure what that means. Melman. With the next so long, I almost struggle to keep eye contact, my friend. So this is ten tezos edition of 21, sold so far and just minted. So that is available on object recollapse.
00:46:08.212 - 00:46:35.044, Speaker A: Witnessing soul stirring moments. And so here, another digital painting. This is 21 60 by 21 60. Again, a lot of texture in recollapse's work here. And just kind of a really interesting, kind of has a bit of an expressionistic feel to it, I guess, and real painterly digital textures in this. Very interesting, again, digital painting. And here, again, digital textures.
00:46:35.044 - 00:46:55.732, Speaker A: And so just an interesting piece. A little bit of writing on it and witnessing soul stirring moments. And here we almost see these little ants coming out. And again, we see text kind of littered through this work here. So interesting piece. Three tezos edition of one. Oh, it's at auction.
00:46:55.732 - 00:47:10.744, Speaker A: Okay, excellent. So that is at auction for three tazos. Maybe you get a cheap one of one recollapse, if you get lucky. Mumble boy with a beautiful work. Salon de calmare. I thought this was quite beautiful here, too. I love the hair.
00:47:10.744 - 00:47:40.814, Speaker A: I love the hair in the composition. Kind of reminds me of the surrealist a little bit, where it's kind of center stage as the main subject, which is quite interesting. There's some more hair. And again, working physical and digital together here, going back and forth. And so just another interesting composition from mumble boy. This is an edition of 112 tezos. And still available here is Seiba Sestaro walking the city.
00:47:40.814 - 00:48:13.318, Speaker A: Interesting piece. Hey, interesting kind of digital brush marks here, like these kind of hard edged digital brushstrokes. We see what looks like a drawing of a person, an illustration with maybe a photo spliced in, and then the outline of a person. So all sorts of complicating stuff. Again, it's always very mental, very psychological work that Seba sestero does, of course, doing that wonderful memory series. So this was just posted on x. And here, another illustration, I believe, digital.
00:48:13.318 - 00:48:32.374, Speaker A: This is by Barabin, if I'm not mistaken. And here, this is on Zora. None minted so far. Minted April 1. Maybe if you get lucky, mint first, mint 1st 0.001. Maybe you got a one of one illustration here. It looks like a digital one fugitive.
00:48:32.374 - 00:48:58.950, Speaker A: And here is the work. So I assume this is digital but as you can see here, it's getting harder and harder to tell what is digital, what is digital, and what is physical. I really don't know. I assume this is digital. You know why I'd seem. I'd assume it's digital because it's really well done. Like, if you did this physically and it may be physical, that's pretty impressive.
00:48:58.950 - 00:49:14.510, Speaker A: Because, of course, watercolor, there is no undo, and it may be physical. It's very hard to tell these days. And this is kind of a classic example. Maybe it is physical. I mean, we see what looks like a pencil. There's. If you have an opinion, feel free to weigh in.
00:49:14.510 - 00:49:31.966, Speaker A: If it's digital, it's remarkable in how textured it is, as you see here. So either way, maybe that's physical. I think it is physical. Now, so, interesting. That is on Zora, none minted yet. So you might get a low edition, if not a one of one, if you get lucky. Jake Studios.
00:49:31.966 - 00:49:50.734, Speaker A: This is from people of Tazos. So a bunch of people of Tezos works were released. A classic series here on Tezos. And so a self portrait of Jake Studios. And there is the mustache. So we've seen this character a few times. So now we know this is Jake Studios smoking four cigarettes at a time.
00:49:50.734 - 00:50:09.504, Speaker A: And these wonderful pixelated clouds here, blurred out a little bit, kind of dripping. A beautiful self portrait. A fitting self portrait. Both the computers here, only God can judge me. Very cool work. That is 20 tezos at auction. And maybe it's at 33 now.
00:50:09.504 - 00:50:36.298, Speaker A: Very cool work. And just very quickly here, let me just give you a taste. So mech had a work here ad. I can't go through all of them, but maybe here we can do just a quick scan here in case some of your favorite artists are doing self portraits. It is a very cool series. And there's. I think I brought up Recano there too, because I loved the poetry of Roccano doing himself as a computer.
00:50:36.298 - 00:50:51.850, Speaker A: I thought that was brilliant. As a retro computer monitor, I thought that was brilliant. But all sorts of beautiful works here. There's exmortal, you know, so just a ton of work. And I think that's this series. I think we've seen these before. I think.
00:50:51.850 - 00:51:06.420, Speaker A: Yes, we've definitely seen the lily yellow. So heads up. People of Tezos just put out a new several works. New portraits from people of Tazos. So this is a new work by Ed Morolla. Now under the Eduardo Pulitzer. New pixels.
00:51:06.420 - 00:51:17.804, Speaker A: Great title. Love it. You know, that could be the name of an exhibition at the Whitney new Pixels. That is just brilliant. Title ad. Brilliant. Brilliant.
00:51:17.804 - 00:51:26.204, Speaker A: Top minter. Ah, heck. Right on, Santiago. So leaving. So people having fun here, talking about life. So let me. I brought it up big.
00:51:26.204 - 00:51:46.994, Speaker A: It was posted on Twitter. So here. Very interesting. It almost looks like object 98 a little bit, or Microsoft paint 98 brush there. And interesting. Almost out of focus textures. Now, this is on x, so it's not quite clear, right? So this is the original, I think, size of the file.
00:51:46.994 - 00:52:20.048, Speaker A: And then. So you make it bigger and you start to get the distortions from zooming in, I guess you would say. And there's like a devil hanging out, I think of it. I'm working on this kind of Dante pixel artwork, and when I'm putting bodies together, I don't. I took an anatomy class, but I don't have as good of anatomy as waffles does. I never did medical illustration. So when I see ed do stuff like this, I actually find it inspiring now, because all of a sudden I go, I don't need to worry about getting the elbow and every.
00:52:20.048 - 00:52:51.128, Speaker A: The shoulder. If anything, this is quite a poetic work. It's quite an expressionist way of doing an arm. So it's kind of a lesson in not letting anatomy knowledge stop you because it's quite moving work, isn't it? So isn't that interesting? So that's kind of what goes through my mind as I see that. So that is just minted on Zora. Here's one by Santiago. This is on, this is on a small one for Santiago, only 2400 by 1200.
00:52:51.128 - 00:53:12.744, Speaker A: This is on foundation using base, interestingly so, 0.075 starting bid for the auction. So a smaller work, as you can see here for Santiago. But a classic abstract here. Nice color and everything. So another artist working on base. Very cool.
00:53:12.744 - 00:53:35.812, Speaker A: And look at this stunner. This is a new one from Kristen ruse super paint. I picked one of these up happily, just a very. Again, working with this, celebrating different paint programs. So here, what is the name of this? This is called super paint. I mean, kind of a, you know, historian of sorts. Historian of sorts of these different softwares.
00:53:35.812 - 00:53:57.102, Speaker A: And you see the power. I mean, just showing. It's, you know, this is educational art, isn't it? Because you go, oh, I've never heard of Elda super paint. Oh, is this what it does? Oh, here's the user interface. This is great. Here's even some, you know, so a screenshot of the work here. Now, I don't think.
00:53:57.102 - 00:54:25.864, Speaker A: Yeah, and this is probably. And it's not like it's even multiplied, right in terms of scale. Like this is probably the real size of the screenshot, interestingly, maybe a small size. And I'm kind of back to this idea if it's going to cost a fortune to mint on bitcoin, and that's something you want to do. These kind of softwares really have my eye right now because I'm still kind of obsessed on the whole bitcoin thing. Kidpix for Macintosh, another retro software, this by 2002. Hope I'm saying that right.
00:54:25.864 - 00:54:40.560, Speaker A: I quite like this kind of an interesting piece. It's like abstracted out. It kind of looks like a face, maybe a sun. Not sure. Planet. A really nice piece. This is only one minted.
00:54:40.560 - 00:54:49.844, Speaker A: This is on Zora. And I think. I'm not sure if you can. You can mint it. So that is still available. That is on Zora. Ecstasy.
00:54:49.844 - 00:55:19.484, Speaker A: Beautiful piece. And here's a new one by Kyle Flemmer. Nebula NGC 5189. And again, we're using the tiling within the context of astronomy, the astronomical theme spiral planetary nebula. I think this is a brilliant juxtaposition of ideas. Let's call it that. Like again, this idea of using the tiling from esperite, if I'm not mistaken.
00:55:19.484 - 00:55:48.556, Speaker A: I believe that's what we were all discussing a few months ago. Right? And I think I learned how to do this from actually Kyle Flemmer and Mek discussing it. Pretty original use of the tiling. Hey, let's use this tiling to make astronomical paintings. And then even, you know, almost a Christian Rousse here with these kind of frames here. And the title put inside, all the details really align here. Alchemical Cradle Nebula series number two edition of five.
00:55:48.556 - 00:55:59.944, Speaker A: Seven tezos, each two gone, selling two. So you got to love it. Now this is quite interesting. This is by leprochant. It was a pleasure to participate in this classic collection. Thank you. Blitkin project.
00:55:59.944 - 00:56:36.468, Speaker A: My tribute to Unpero Andalous, the first surrealistic movie by Louise Bunil and Salvador Dali. So of course, this is from that famous scene, probably. You know what's funny? I can't remember which museum I was in, but they had this movie, I think it's Danalou or whatever it's called. And this movie by Salvador Dali and Luis Bugniel, I think it was a poet, if I'm not mistaken. And it was pretty tedious. I would argue it was kind of boring until you get to this part where. And I didn't watch the whole thing, so admittedly.
00:56:36.468 - 00:56:55.204, Speaker A: But then you get to the part with the eyeball. And then you're kind of like. You have your full attention on the movie. So this is definitely the most famous image. So leprochant here doing a homage, a pixel art homage to it. Cool use of just a few colors here. Maybe three colors, four colors.
00:56:55.204 - 00:57:11.764, Speaker A: Very cool. Again. And I haven't heard of Blitkin Xyz. I don't click on all the links. You can't. Just out of carefulness, but I'm not sure blitkin what blockchain that is. And here's the great rata.
00:57:11.764 - 00:57:38.424, Speaker A: So here, no quarter. So we've been watching this work being made. Look at this. And you gotta love the whole composition. This ship that is just this dynamic composition. There is the rat pirate with what look like, you know, british soldiers here, and then maybe some french soldiers here, and the pirate coming in. And there's all the rats.
00:57:38.424 - 00:57:52.050, Speaker A: That is hilarious. So just a really cool work. Maybe some more rats there. Not sure. Gorgeous pixel artwork from Rada. This is on foundation. And this, I believe, is on ethereum.
00:57:52.050 - 00:58:11.014, Speaker A: And it is the blockchain is ethereum. So again, foundation going multi chain here. And so this is from rata. Price of 1.628 ETH. But you can get a rata, one of one, which is available here. And so, very cool work here from rata.
00:58:11.014 - 00:58:42.000, Speaker A: Also, we have a more pixel art. Art arts of win. Temperature goes to 33 degrees. A two bit ice cream is a requirement. So just another, again, this pixel artist I discovered on Instagram, I don't think they mint on the blockchain. I mean, maybe if anybody knows where they mint, feel free to leave a link in the community or send me a link. But isn't it interesting? Because I think this person could probably do quite well, right? Could probably bring in a few hundred bucks a month doing their art if they're on the blockchain.
00:58:42.000 - 00:59:21.614, Speaker A: But maybe they don't want to be. You know, as we saw in that earlier post from verse, there's a stigma, you know, which we have to embrace, because if you know everybody and they're wanted to get in on this, it kind of divides up the pie. There are only so many collectors out there. And yes, a lot of artists become collectors. But really, you know, in a sense, maybe it should be seen as good fortune that it's not overcrowded right now with people trying to get their little bit of, you know, maybe that's why it actually works out right now as a kind of market. So, all to say, but beautiful work there. From that artist, arts of win.
00:59:21.614 - 01:00:04.538, Speaker A: Here's Manatel, and, of course, minting on the blockchain. I think this is on Zora. Indeed. Open free mint at Zora. So here's the cat. And I have to say, I find this trend super interesting, where people, I've seen it over and over now, just in the last few days, where you'll see the dynamic version of the gif, the moving gif, in one slide on Instagram, and then you'll see the static version in the next. I find that very interesting, because there, I would argue, they're very different works, aren't they? I mean, your eye is captured, say, by the butterfly, the fan, the blinking cat.
01:00:04.538 - 01:00:40.118, Speaker A: It's a different kind of experience. And then even here, the narrative of the work is, oh, I'm going to try and capture the butterfly. Maybe the cat is thinking, this is a completely different narrative, I would argue, which is quite interesting, isn't it? This is a complete. Like here, it's like the cat contemplating existence. Who maybe would normally want to eat the butterfly, is now kind of seems to be meditating on the butterfly. You're not looking at the fan, you know, you're not looking at the blinking eyes of the cat. You're looking at the composition, you know? So it's quite an intro.
01:00:40.118 - 01:01:23.482, Speaker A: I love this trend because, for me, it kind of is illustrating what is going on with movement, and it shows that, you know, if you stop the frame up here with the butterfly up here, that's a different work. Or if you have it where it looks like the cat's going to eat the butterfly, that's a different work. So I just find it interesting, as we try and kind of figure out the underlying mechanics here, of what does it mean when a work is moving? It means a lot. Again, I used to be kind of like static works only, but I've adjusted to this scene, and I actually like it, and I work with it, and I figure out ways that it can inform my to work. Okay. I can put several versions of the work in one work, as we see with oxy. Right.
01:01:23.482 - 01:01:46.974, Speaker A: So all to say, let's continue here, Chaz, as we're over the hour mark, and we're only halfway through the tabs, I'm going to speed up here. So, Chaz, solitaire. So another classic pixel artwork by Chaz, and. Yeah, so just beautiful. Love the keyboard there, too. And, of course, solitaire, who doesn't know that. Here's Tom under the moonlight.
01:01:46.974 - 01:02:05.978, Speaker A: Another new pixel artwork here of his robot or his skeleton character. Reading at night. And again, kind of has, like, a 1940s Sci-Fi vibe edition of 15. Looks like it is sold out at 470. Congrats. Here's Braun, the blink of the stars in a pixelated galaxy. Cool.
01:02:05.978 - 01:02:45.948, Speaker A: So, of course, Braun was putting out some of those, what I'd call, like, abstract expressionist pixel artworks. Here's another one, but more on a galaxy kind of vibe, similar to what we were seeing from Kyle Flemmer there, in terms, you could hang them in the same room thematically. Here's Emmy. Pixel Mount Muchee. A nice pixel art landscape, isn't it? So again, maybe 200 by 200. And indeed, it is made with aspirite, which is a, for those that are wondering, pixel art software, this is a good one. And I think you get the full version for, like, you just download it legally, and then you can get the full version, I think, for $60 or something.
01:02:45.948 - 01:03:06.224, Speaker A: So it's pretty reasonable. Anis Abdin, day 92 sharing. So the great pixel artist here, and what do we see? Dynamic in one. Let me see if I can make it slightly bigger. No dynamic in one frame. Here, we see the snow and a different composition, a different artwork in the static. Isn't this interesting? Day 92.
01:03:06.224 - 01:03:32.794, Speaker A: So, of course, making an artwork a day, amazingly, here is element ly bunker. So interesting piece here. Also daily art. Right? So this is a very interesting piece. And again, looks like someone going underground and into this area here. Just such an interesting artist, elementally here, just going with two colors. Again, very bitcoin, affordable.
01:03:32.794 - 01:03:51.534, Speaker A: Spiegel's mask. Keenan. This is another work that I think is on base, if I am not mistaken. It is. So you can see that down here. And so kind of part of foundation's launch, I think they invited some artists here. It is great.
01:03:51.534 - 01:04:20.034, Speaker A: Spiegels maskinen, palm trees, retro tvs, synths, weather. Quit soothing. Beautiful work. How is it doing already at a third of an ETH. So above $1,000. Already above $1,000 and it ends in two days. Good work, spoogles.
01:04:20.034 - 01:04:53.614, Speaker A: I'm telling you, the Ethereum community seems to have embraced base, which is interesting because, you know, Ethereum was struggling with the fees. And so this is interesting, especially from an art perspective, because this is real money. This is like Ethereum type money, but again, without any of the fees. So if those collectors are moving over to base. And again, another reason beyond warpcaster, where a lot of that community seems to be as well. So again, worlds are colliding here. Here's Ricano.
01:04:53.614 - 01:05:12.034, Speaker A: People of Tezos work, the self portrait of Ricano. And there's Ricano in the screen. I thought this was quite brilliant. So really cool work by Ricano and Ricano's style there. And going for 20 tezos at auction. Ex mortal putting in a bid. Very cool work.
01:05:12.034 - 01:05:35.354, Speaker A: Here's Francois Gamma motion hands number two. Pretty fast work again of the, of the person. I don't know if they're walking. Looks like they're just kind of moving through space very slowly, almost like they're doing Tai Chi, moving their hands. Here's another one. Kind of different op walk. So a couple of interesting works here by Francoise Gamma, as per usual.
01:05:35.354 - 01:06:00.154, Speaker A: Kind of different looking edition of 30 for three tazos. And here's one by Glitchtown arcade called four. Interesting, interesting. Kind of a lo fi glitchrong, isn't it? Like interesting exporting going on here. So. And again, the margin is just like an interesting touch too, which changes color, by the way. Very, very interesting.
01:06:00.154 - 01:06:18.350, Speaker A: So this is called four edition of one. And silva sand two is putting in a bid at Tezos 30. And here is Silva Santus Adatazos 30. Astronomical glitch. So more glitch work and more astronomy. Interestingly. Very interesting.
01:06:18.350 - 01:06:38.804, Speaker A: Maybe it's because the solar eclipse is coming to North America. I was gonna fly back for that, but I'm just too late for it now. So all to say, very interesting. Another beautiful glitch. Rom, here's he. This was posted on X. Kind of a cryptic work, this wild writing here and everything about this work.
01:06:38.804 - 01:07:04.244, Speaker A: And it really is the gif, I would argue that kind of clinches the piece. Interesting mask, just totally mysterious. Like, where did this come from? What is this person doing? Nice response here. X is responding well. Here's rural idol. Pretty cool work here posted on and happy birthday to rural idol. It's my birthday today, so that was on April 1.
01:07:04.244 - 01:07:27.342, Speaker A: So belated. Happy birthday to rural idol. Interesting piece here. Kind of combining illustration with some of these, you know, just dynamic, moving, kind of digital, you know, brushes that are kind of. Or brush marks that are going. Kind of cycling through here. Just an interesting piece.
01:07:27.342 - 01:07:51.334, Speaker A: So cool work from rural idol. Here is Kiro on base, three of 100 minted. And so let's see if we can expand it. So nice that you can maximize here on foundation, too. This is a gorgeous work. This was also kind of elbowing its way to the front of the show. Beautiful, beautiful work.
01:07:51.334 - 01:08:07.130, Speaker A: You know, as far as just starting, I was very tempted, I don't, to know if I've started. I think I've started with the kiro work before. I love the simplicity of this work. There's something just very. It really. And it's quite beautiful in its color. So beautiful work here from kiro.
01:08:07.130 - 01:08:33.215, Speaker A: Let's speed up, Klaus. This sold composition 181 has kind of, again, a modern art feel to it. Again, I was thinking of Kandinsky with this whole series as far as the titles are concerned. Composition 181, for example. And here it's almost got a bit of a look of this kind of, you know, Kandinsky shapes, kandinsky esque shapes, but done with analog video art. Here's another one. Beautiful textures.
01:08:33.215 - 01:08:49.603, Speaker A: Number 182, beautiful colors. The pink, the purple, the blue. This is 21 tezos edition of one. And here's number 183, still available for 21 tezos. And again, more beautiful colors here. Very rich textured works. Here's techno micking.
01:08:49.603 - 01:09:11.694, Speaker A: A cool version of a shoe. Bw persian violet V 20. So pretty cool. And you almost see the curvature of what looks like the curvature of the screen here. And just reminds you of those Internet shopping profile of a Nike Air Max classic, which is a classic shoe. ASCII and digital glitch. Very cool.
01:09:11.694 - 01:09:24.140, Speaker A: And here's Renki. I think we got a couple of works here. Shimasoto, Shimosato. So changing it up here. A little bit more texture in this one. This is an edition of one. Not listed.
01:09:24.140 - 01:09:42.148, Speaker A: Here's another one, edition of one. And I don't think this is listed either. And again, you're seeing that a little bit of texture in the blue. So keeping on evolving. And here's ranixteer ocean base. This is on base and on foundation as well. So a cool animated version of a Rannick steer work.
01:09:42.148 - 01:09:59.620, Speaker A: So almost as if it's underwater looking. And we see a ran exterior, kind of surreal, abstract composition meant for 0.01 ETH edition of 20. That is on base. Very cool. There already 1100 followers on foundation. Amazing, Martin Joe.
01:09:59.620 - 01:10:30.694, Speaker A: So here's the work we saw earlier in the community. There's the coffee gas mask, coffee latex. So pretty hilarious from Martin Joe. Eight left at three Tazos edition of ten point of view. You're having your morning coffee. Just hilarious from Martin Joe. And here's walk.
01:10:30.694 - 01:10:42.194, Speaker A: Purple Moby Dick. Maybe we already saw no April 2. I'm not sure. We may have seen this one. I feel like maybe we saw Moby Dick. But this series continues here. How much? No, I think this is new.
01:10:42.194 - 01:10:56.418, Speaker A: So it is. There's a bit of a tezos. You might get a walk for a Tezos if you get lucky here. That would be amazing. Tree 18. A one of one tree 18 by Skomra, edition of 20. So another tree by Skomra.
01:10:56.418 - 01:11:25.578, Speaker A: And again, as we work into the AI section, these beautiful textures here. And look at that, just like over there. Just beautiful. It's little stuff like this that really, for whatever reason, where the poetry seems to be in some works that just beautiful edition of 20 and already three gone. And as we continue, Kinixapata, man making music from celestial bodies. This is on object. I found it on x.
01:11:25.578 - 01:11:38.334, Speaker A: Cool juxtaposition of almost these japanese screens here. And music over here. Another diagram. Diagrams are cool. Cool composition, AI artwork, I believe. Here's another one by Kanex Zapata. Wild one.
01:11:38.334 - 01:11:58.598, Speaker A: This is an edition of one for 20 tezos. Pretty cool, fun, wild work. You know, you show up in your AI section of your museum and you see this, you go, that's pretty cool. That is pretty cool. So cool. Rainbow work. Kind of flying under the radar there at 20 tezos on object from Kanex Zapata.
01:11:58.598 - 01:12:22.574, Speaker A: As we go into, I don't know if this is AI. This might just be straight up digital painting. This is Mikhail Knowlsson. Of course, Mikael was collaborating with Evelyn O, who does some AI as well. So anyway, beautiful brushwork here from Mikhail Knowlsson. And it would fit, I think, quite well with Sarah Kretschmer here. Another experiment in layering materials and technology, also experimenting with abstraction.
01:12:22.574 - 01:12:53.456, Speaker A: I think Sarah's using quite a few different tools in this case, I think. I think she was saying AI, but maybe blender, if I'm not mistaken. But as you see here, layering different materials and technology, making a cool abstract. And here is Filippo Francocci. I get lost in the details. So this is a work in progress, this kind of interesting, almost nightmarish work here. And I think AI is being incorporated into this painting as well as we saw with one of the last ones.
01:12:53.456 - 01:13:30.124, Speaker A: So just interesting work from Filippo Francocci. Work in progress. And here's a work AI artwork by lily. Illogical, I thought quite beautiful, this shadow here. And here we see the chairs again, this simple, simple subject with these beautiful, almost like summer shadows of, you know, the trees or grass, you know, looking like grass with shadows or something, who knows? But beautiful color in that. And here's another one by Lily Illo. And this is just a cool, another cool canvas, I want to call it, from Lily Illo, another AI artwork.
01:13:30.124 - 01:13:51.680, Speaker A: And here's strange thing, I think off to New York and I think this is, this is also on foundation for base at 0.02 ETH. Seven day open edition. Unfortunately caught COVID for a second time. And I've been resting a lot. That's terrible because strange thing. Had a terrible bout of COVID just like three months ago.
01:13:51.680 - 01:14:10.784, Speaker A: Unbelievable. So best of luck, good wishes to strange things. So a beautiful work by the maestro of AI there. Strange thing. Here's no hygiene. With more experimental AI artwork quite like this one. We saw the sandwich last time with the baby, which was amazing.
01:14:10.784 - 01:14:21.784, Speaker A: Here is another one. And how many minted so far? Three minted so far. This is on Zora. God. Interesting title. And there is the work. Kind of love it.
01:14:21.784 - 01:14:35.668, Speaker A: And here's another one. Decadence in room six. This is district 468. Beautiful texture here. And this is part of a series AI art series. So here's a flamingo in the hotel. So cool title here too.
01:14:35.668 - 01:14:55.574, Speaker A: Decadence in room six. This is an edition of five sold out at a tezos each. So cool work there. It's always better, I think, to sell your work out at a low price than to hold on to it at the higher price. Depending on, you know, depends on a lot of situation. But it's always nice. Good feeling to sell and to sell out.
01:14:55.574 - 01:15:21.764, Speaker A: Sell out your work. Martin Bruce with another work here, another completely unpredictable expect, you know, upsetting expectations. Here's a colorful helicopter, some abstraction. None of it makes sense, but it does. Here's some gradations, some spray. This is not easy to do. To break your rational mind and act irrationally like this is very difficult to do.
01:15:21.764 - 01:15:35.292, Speaker A: Here's Denise Sanchez, GM friends. Levitating acrylic on paper. So just some beautiful mark making here. Looks like a work. Looks like an abstract work. And different kinds of mark making to create contrast. Nice work from Denise.
01:15:35.292 - 01:15:53.544, Speaker A: Here's machine. Tinky winky dipsy. So I think Kanye has been in the news here and I think that is what machine is riffing off of. Interesting kind of thing here. It's almost like a toy. So maybe a reference I don't understand. But classic machine here.
01:15:53.544 - 01:16:24.336, Speaker A: Interesting scratching within, on top of the image there, isn't it? As we move into the physicals. Ken a. Here excited to share some work. Hexam gallery for circles and squares alongside some wonderful paintings by Miles Shelton. So this is ken a interesting piece, isn't it? It's almost like dan control when you go to the edges with the lighter and, you know, you almost have the same thing with the milk crate just going straight to the edges, distorting it. Dairyland. Interesting subject.
01:16:24.336 - 01:16:53.650, Speaker A: Great painting. Here's Morimoto studio. And interesting work here of this modern, you know, phone booth, so to speak. And you have the vending machine kind of juxtaposing it with nature and really well painted, isn't it? And here we see a half, I think, a half finished work. No influencers allowed. So just cool work from this artist here, I think. Are they the ones? No, I think there's a different artist.
01:16:53.650 - 01:17:15.146, Speaker A: So just interesting work. And here's Bundoza Bandito, Laura Palmer and Laura Palmer afterlife. Some more humor here for the Twin Peaks people. There is a portrait of Laura Palmer. And there in the afterlife, so cool work by Bondozo Bandido. Very prolific here. Pretty nice eyes, by the way.
01:17:15.146 - 01:17:30.734, Speaker A: Very nice. And then there in the afterlife, cool work. And this is chrome void. I am quite cheesed to announce my new painting. Fake rat Pepe, will be showing at frogs over Fiat this week and on auction. Beautiful work. It looks like a physical.
01:17:30.734 - 01:17:53.406, Speaker A: And there just. It's very cool to see these digital meme type sunglasses, pixelated sunglasses in physical. There's something beautiful about that. Beautiful work. And here's Charlie Stein, actually another artist and friend of mine in Berlin, coming across the instagram. So just cool drawings here, just colored pencils. What does that say? I love you, but I've chosen neukohn.
01:17:53.406 - 01:18:17.126, Speaker A: That is my old neighborhood there in Berlin. So I'll just say just cool work from Charlie Stein. And she's actually with the Kristen Hjellerdy Gallery, which has a location here in Berlin. And that is your show, my friends. An hour and 18. Maybe a little less commentary next time. Thank you for joining me and hopefully I see you on the space today.
01:18:17.126 - 01:18:19.214, Speaker A: Until next time, take care.
