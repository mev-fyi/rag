00:00:05.480 - 00:00:29.526, Speaker A: Well, how exciting is this? I almost missed it. Myth on super rare. We have permission to be excited now. Welcome back, everyone, to the pirate ship that's being built in mid air. Artist journal, January 20, 2023. My name is Adrian Pokebelli. And again, thank you for the patience, everyone.
00:00:29.526 - 00:00:59.954, Speaker A: That last episode went a little long. An hour and eight minutes. And I was thinking to myself, this is like a plane being built in midair. So, you know, it's a work in progress, and there's only one way to do kind of broadcasting, and it's to do it right. You can do all the theories you want, but until you get in front of the mic, it's all theory. So thank you for the patience on that. I am trying to reduce the length, and this one should be a lot shorter.
00:00:59.954 - 00:01:43.374, Speaker A: And a big thank you to Ilay, who goes, who watches the entire episode and then puts out. I'm gonna show you here. I'm gonna show you all the work she does. So, big shout out to Aylay. And we're about to just see what work she does here because, and first of all, before we continue, a huge, massive shout out to myth for getting on super rare here. It was only a matter of time, as we all know who know who are familiar with myth's work. So that is super exciting, right? Because myth is kind of a, you know, a, like one of the, you know, put it this way.
00:01:43.374 - 00:02:33.074, Speaker A: I've heard, you know, notable people call him the king of tazos, you know, people who have been around a lot longer than I have in this scene and on tazos. So, yeah. So, anyways, it's a remarkable moment, and I think it's just great for the whole kind of blockchain, NfT art scene, digital art scene that we are so happy to be a part of over here because it shows kind of, there's, you know, there's the tribalism. What tribalism? As far as we're all concerned, as I've always advocated here, multi chain multimedia, not just digital art. You know, make screen prints, make paintings and all this sort of thing. And be multi chain that empowers the artist. And it's hard to not see myth being empowered here by being on super rare.
00:02:33.074 - 00:02:46.426, Speaker A: Okay, so, again, huge shout out to myth. This is awesome. And let's just read his note here. GM friends. Now it's seen that the myth is an artist of super rare. More news soon. I want to thank all of you who support the myth.
00:02:46.426 - 00:03:26.770, Speaker A: And a special thanks to Chris Astoich for this opportunity. So very well done. All around over there, kind of a big landmark here on our pirate ship, 501 subscribers. So as we are in the middle of the ocean here in search of new lands, we have passed 500 subscribers. We are at 501 here. And even the views here, I mean, you never know if I somewhat hesitate to point out these numbers because before you know it, it'll be at 499. And the views, but 299 views in the last 20 hours here.
00:03:26.770 - 00:03:57.094, Speaker A: So again, thank you everybody who is watching, subscribing and enjoying the show. I got a nice message this morning and it was great. So Ilay, this is the work. And we remember if you watched yesterday's marathon show, Aylay was referencing this work, so this was her interpretation and I didn't have time to show it. But if anybody should be made time for it's Ilay. So I just wanted to do that here. Arlen Maltby Jawbreaker, Retina Byrne.
00:03:57.094 - 00:04:26.944, Speaker A: So her first work. So if you want to help out aile find her on object, just type in Aylay here and give her a follow. She just released her first work here and it is a tribute, a homage to this work here by the great Hasdrubal. Authentic waffles. And this is neat 0961 of the pfps and it's pretty awesome. You know, this is why we love waffles. Or waffle the palm trees.
00:04:26.944 - 00:04:53.144, Speaker A: I mean, this is a great one. So nice choice there. And here she is on Twitter aylay. So and again, the reason why I'm making such a big deal is a lot of the growth like that. 500 subscribers, I think we can attribute frankly to Aylay doing this where look at yesterday. I just want to show you the work because it's important that this is recognized. This is yesterday's show.
00:04:53.144 - 00:05:24.852, Speaker A: 19. Like a thread of 19 where she tags everyone and basically says every piece here and rare and mech txt giving the shout out to Ilay because Ron, recognizing the work that she is doing. So send her art, send her tezos, give her a follow on Twitter and object. And she's a great follow, by the way. Look at this. I discover work. I probably regularly go to her page every day in the morning to see what I missed.
00:05:24.852 - 00:05:56.906, Speaker A: Okay, so big hat tip to Ilay and big hat tip to the collector here, tagine Burcock for a new work that I just released here of Kissinger, Henry Kissinger on the Pixel art sketchbook series. I can't help myself to do all these different series, guys. It's just too much fun. And so anyways, so a new work there went for 35 in basically 1 minute. So that is exciting too. I mean, you make a sketch and people like it. And I loved it too.
00:05:56.906 - 00:06:26.954, Speaker A: Actually, I was happy with the work. So it's kind of interesting. I noticed mech Txt does pngs, and I was doing pngs too. Jpeg doesn't work when you kind of zoom in. It starts to get blurry because I use a square brush for this, but I also like Gif. And so I'll have to ask mec Txt maybe in a spaces or something, why he uses Png over Gif. Because it's kind of interesting as far as trying to get those crispy pixelations.
00:06:26.954 - 00:07:04.424, Speaker A: I wonder to myself which is the better file format? And I'd love to just hear the. Because he's such a good pixel artist, et cetera. I'm sure he has his reasons why he does what he does. Runetune, just a really interesting comment here. I love to take away from rare that you never know who's looking at your work. And he's saying it's not just artists, but collectors as well as you never know who's looking at the work you like and collect. I have a few axcenes in gloom tubes that at the time I bought them because I love the work, and now they're worth ten times what I paid for them.
00:07:04.424 - 00:07:42.066, Speaker A: And it's true, like, I mean, this is pretty wild stuff. My conclusion, buy what you like and buy as much as you can. I agree, actually, even if the work never reaches a ten x value, you paid for it. It's good to support artists you like, and you can never go wrong holding something that is intrinsically valuable to you. So I find this to be a very interesting discussion on being wrong, because it's totally possible nobody knows the future. Maybe all this art will remain unrecognized. But I was thinking to myself, like, if my collection, for example, goes to zero, that would suck.
00:07:42.066 - 00:08:33.584, Speaker A: But I'm okay with it. I'm totally okay with it, because I have a conviction in the work and it brings me happiness. And as the hen collector was saying, remember the guy who wrote that great essay from two months ago? Enjoy the green pastures, which seem like prophetic words, you know, three months later where the green pastures are disappearing. Okay, like, let me put it this way. There are a lot of green pastures out there, but there's not as many as there were before. You know, if you're a gloom tube collector, for example, or axin or rare. Right? So all to say, despite the financial gain that can come, I think as the hen collector was saying, your collection should have a concept if you want.
00:08:33.584 - 00:09:22.874, Speaker A: I mean, people collect for different reasons, but I share this sentiment for myself that your collection should be, should have a thesis of a certain kind where you can look at that collection and you can go, oh, something significant and relevant is going on here. Something of some kind of importance, whatever that might be that could potentially last centuries is kind of what you're. I mean, again, we were discussing this yesterday. For those that watched, this is the big game that we're involved in, whether you realize it or not is, it's the standing the test of time and, you know. So anyway, you provoke some very interesting ideas here. Runetune, as usual. And it's great to hear from you.
00:09:22.874 - 00:09:43.650, Speaker A: And also, just very quickly, Eizo, thanks for the kind words about my new series. So Eizo is the artist who did the glitch couch. Okay. Which was great. And we, there's a bed and we're gonna see another one today, the lamp. I'll be doing them daily for a little while. The process is all using old analog video gear in one take with barely any computer.
00:09:43.650 - 00:10:17.870, Speaker A: So super great to hear from Eizo and thank you everybody for the comments here. Heard from Rada. Enjoying adding to his shopping list with the show. So this is great. So thank you. Just a interesting kind of, you know, we're looking at curation on foundation and of course nifty gateways. We've seen this a couple of times before here I think Charles AI and maybe limbo together some collections and here was an interesting one because I saw mech Txt Michael Macasso had a work.
00:10:17.870 - 00:10:55.342, Speaker A: And you know what I really liked about this collection? This curated collection, Spear Shrine presents a new landscape. I like how small it is. Like there's, it's such like speaking of a thesis, it's a very simple thesis and I just think it's really cool. See png here. And so anyway, I just think it's a good looking show and I love how small it is. You don't need to have 20 works in a show. I almost prefer fewer works to a certain degree, depending on what's going on.
00:10:55.342 - 00:11:31.704, Speaker A: But anyways, I like the idea of doing only three works. And there is your thesis, you know, so on to the works at hand here. So a new work by dead inside. It's funny, I have a friend who used to reference a bartender at a bar as she'd call him dead inside, which was kind of a cruel name. But anyways, so when I saw dead inside, I don't even know the reference, but we all understand what it would be to be dead inside. So a beautiful work by axin. And of course, the market is on fire, as usual.
00:11:31.704 - 00:12:08.746, Speaker A: Very nice painterly things going on. I see. Frankly, I really like this roughness here. And I feel like I'm continuing to see development actually, as one would expect on the actual painting side of things, as far as just doing the robes and even just like letting it the kind of the dry brush here, letting it kind of show through a little bit, it's getting just gorgeous and it always was. So anyways, a new work from Oxene, edition of eleven, taking offers. And let's just reload this thing to see where we're at on the offers here. 37 offers.
00:12:08.746 - 00:12:32.742, Speaker A: So. Okay, like, here we go again. Right? Bear market. What? Bear market. So two, four, 6810, eleven. So basically, you're not getting this work, which I think is going to be offers will be accepted, I think, later today, but double check that you're not getting it for less than $369. Basically.
00:12:32.742 - 00:12:56.010, Speaker A: Basically a tezos is a dollar right now and the top bid is 500. And we're not even near the end of this offering. So it's probably going to be like the last one. So uxine continues to be on fire. And let me show you this. This is cool, too, based on a fresco by Philip Veidt. So just for those that are interested also in the art side of things.
00:12:56.010 - 00:13:17.930, Speaker A: So I believe it is this figure here. So oxymoron has taken the mirror. See this person with the hand and the staff and turned it into a sign here. And we see it here. Let me see if I can zoom in for us. This guy here, right? I suspect, I mean, it looks pretty clear. And you see the interpretation as well.
00:13:17.930 - 00:13:33.574, Speaker A: So he does a very nice interpretation, like this brushwork here. That is euxine. Right. So anyways, very, very cool work. And one of the nice things about doing this show is you learn about other artists. I've never heard of Philip Veidt. Quite a beautiful work here.
00:13:33.574 - 00:14:03.540, Speaker A: So kind of a window onto Oxine's process, a rare window there. So very interesting. Continuing on, bongdo also kind of a similar vibe with the glitchy, kind of dark. And I don't know if I'd call it skeletal, but anyways, just kind of program y bong do archive edition. Waiting the floor. So this is a burn redeem burn one time royalty and redeem for waiting the floor. So this was also interesting.
00:14:03.540 - 00:14:37.424, Speaker A: So this starts today, later on today. Today is January 20 on manifold. And I brought it up. So I've never seen this page, the burn page, but this is how it works. You upload this and you get this. So, I mean, all sorts of very interesting mechanics here that are going on in the digital art scene. It's kind of fun, right? And kind of like there's a speculative element back to that financial side of things on, oh, should you keep the original or should you get the new one and maybe just base it on if you like the work better and whatnot.
00:14:37.424 - 00:15:38.478, Speaker A: So waiting the floor by Bongdo. So in the Twitter spaces, we're discussing brushes and whatnot, and Rosaceo, whose work we've looked at a few times before. This looks like a Photoshop brush to me because I think I've used this brush in Photoshop. And, yeah, so anyways, just some very nice, unless it's a, it could be a unique brush, I don't know. But anyways, just an example of how fun and beautiful it is to do digital painting here and how good the brushes are getting. Because I was sort of saying, you know, Photoshop is still working on their brushes, but they've actually come a long way, I'd say in the last 18 months, two and a half, maybe two years, Photoshop has really upped its game because procreate kind of led the way with brushes continuing on rare with a big sale on the secondary. Again, these are, again, the kind of sales we're starting to see with oxine two weeks ago.
00:15:38.478 - 00:16:12.362, Speaker A: Beware of dog with gun. So the spot paintings continue to get crazy. This is getting crazy, as Rare says. So big congrats there. And I brought up his page, again, a lot of activity here in the last few hours, 200 for an edition of 15. Again, like axin was almost, to me, a window into the future. And what's so interesting about this, as Rare said on the Twitter spaces last week, this scene is probably only a few thousand people, maybe like a couple of thousand people.
00:16:12.362 - 00:16:50.370, Speaker A: It's probably larger than that. But I get what he's saying, especially if you consider kind of like active participants. And I was thinking to myself, like, what happens? You know, a lot of these artists maybe have a thousand followers. You know, what happens when you have, like, 30,000 followers or even like, you know what, a hundred thousand followers. Like, these aren't, this isn't crazy in the, on the Internet. So Internet like, and I think of people with physical art. I mean, these guys, they uploaded, I upload just like I uploaded the Kissinger there, and it's gone in a minute.
00:16:50.370 - 00:17:20.484, Speaker A: Like, how does that work in the real physical world? Right? So this may just be all getting warmed up here, you know, and that's kind of wild to think about. King Xerox. And I'm not sure if this is Xerox as well. And I'm pretty sure I follow. Yeah, so I was already following Xerox. So again, that's the Twitter glitch there. Messenger is airdrop to all envy and latest King Xerox, one of one holders.
00:17:20.484 - 00:17:43.676, Speaker A: So this is on Opensea and yeah, so I think this is a recent drop. And I just thought it was a notable thing. And I thought it kind of went well with our axcene. And I don't see where it is. This it? Yes. Okay, so I guess they don't do. Here's recently listed, so I'm not sure.
00:17:43.676 - 00:18:02.374, Speaker A: Maybe this is more recent too. I'm not sure what's going on with King Xerox, but it looked pretty cool. So I thought I'd show it to us and make you aware of it. And it's not cheap, by the way, if you go on open. See? Did I bring it up? If you go on Opensea, it's already 0.75 ETH. I mean, King Xerox has a pretty big following from what I understand.
00:18:02.374 - 00:18:30.938, Speaker A: So, yeah, so anyways, pretty cool work here, messenger. And you can find it all on Opensea, on ETH. And so I'll need to talk to. I've actually messaged Xerox in the past and we'll have to talk again because I don't know too much about Xerox and kind of his history, but I know he's kind of been around for a while and has done some really interesting things. Here is another artist, C T Z. Ann. Good morning.
00:18:30.938 - 00:18:57.628, Speaker A: So again, kind of these kind of all fit into the same room to a certain degree in my universe of this kind of glitchy computer Sci-Fi and maybe some skulls. I don't see any skulls here, but you know what I'm saying. Kind of has a similar feel. Artist I've never, I don't think, heard of before. Ctzn. So anyways, cool work. Tom Bombadil continues to do very well.
00:18:57.628 - 00:19:33.496, Speaker A: Uranium clouds with a super cool title with this kind of Sci-Fi I guess it's kind of futuristic pixel artwork and my favorite are, frankly, the clouds. And I also love actually, this kind of cmyk noise here. And anyways, interesting composition. He continues to do very well with the nostalgic colors reminiscent of eight bit games. Edition of 25. Let's very quickly, how are we doing for time here? Very quickly look at the sales. And again went for sale at 08:00 for 1050.
00:19:33.496 - 00:20:03.262, Speaker A: And they're all gone at 08:03 so back to this idea of, you know, Robnis V two. Put it very well. Like the NFT artists are going to be the rock stars of the next decade. Something to that effect, to paraphrase. And you can kind of see it like, I mean, we're in a bear market. Tezos is at a dollar and addition of 25 selling. So basically pulling in $250 at least a day because he puts out at least a drop a day, seemingly as far as I can tell.
00:20:03.262 - 00:20:41.438, Speaker A: And so that's pretty good, right? That's a nice salary. Continuing on, plants with another one. And I thought this one was quite gorgeous, actually. So just another interesting, bizarre, frankly, pixel artwork. A plant with some kind of psychedelic color and, you know, kind of lava esque, almost biological looking cells with, contrasted with black and white. And again, the contrast of the still in the black and white with this, with the static and the dynamic. Okay, so nice work from plants.
00:20:41.438 - 00:20:59.342, Speaker A: Only three tazos. I picked one up, a new one from Sabato, who's also doing very well here. I'm so happy that object is now doing a vertical align on the images. It's so much better. So a really cool, always interesting and unpredictable here. I don't know what you call these things. Think of a bob.
00:20:59.342 - 00:21:13.878, Speaker A: Exactly. It's a thingamabob. Perfect title here. It's called a Newton's cradle and it's designed to demonstrate the conservation of energy and momentum. So super cool work here already. I think it's. He's got a couple for 14.
00:21:13.878 - 00:22:01.050, Speaker A: This is an interesting technique, by the way, everyone. Like, there's a gallery I work with in Minneapolis and so is my first exposure to like a real gallery. And he's saying for your prints, do you want to put them all at the same price or do you want to put like the first 20 prints at a certain price and then maybe make the next 110 at a higher price and then the next five at an even higher price? So this is kind of a technique of the contemporary art world. And Sabato employs it where you'll see, he'll put it on the primary for nine and then the last few he'll put at a higher price. This is like a classic from what I understand, kind of contemporary art world print technique as far as selling. And we love the mechanics of selling and everything here. So anyways, interesting, great work.
00:22:01.050 - 00:22:33.134, Speaker A: Most importantly, and, you know, doing very well, right? Additions of 40 and I mean, look, Sabato has eight left. So let's say 32 times ten. Again, $320 at least. Okay. Not bad for a bear market. And again, if these audiences grow, like, where does that go? Unless people lose interest in all this stuff. But I feel like, can it be any smaller than 2000 people? With everything that's going on here? I doubt it.
00:22:33.134 - 00:23:01.106, Speaker A: So actually, I just wanted to bring up Sabato's market here. I mean, just for example, look at how well everything is looking here at these nice prices here, what's available. And there's a few that are left, but not many. Okay. And like, just nice prices. And again, just the slow drying up that we saw of Sabato's market that we saw with bloom tube and oxene. And actually, that was a pretty quick drying up.
00:23:01.106 - 00:23:21.882, Speaker A: But you take my point because Sabato is one of those artists you see very early on and you are drawn to because it's kind of this really nice seductive pixel artwork like this. Like we saw with boo. Right? And. Yeah, so it's not hard to like that work. And then there's a lot of depth there too. Kappan. Beautiful work.
00:23:21.882 - 00:23:30.098, Speaker A: Gotta love the color. It's called home. It's dynamic. It's a sunset. There's not much to say. This looks like a river. And just kind of awesome work from cap.
00:23:30.098 - 00:23:47.514, Speaker A: And as usual, this went again like we're talking minted. Sorry. Listed at 844 and gone by eight fif. 857. Okay. 20 editions of 20. And it went for 888.
00:23:47.514 - 00:24:13.598, Speaker A: So, like, you know, $170, something like that. Like, boom. That is exciting. Okay, and how much did you spend for your materials? The cost of your laptop three years ago or whatever that was? Or your iPad, I mean, so you gotta love it as an artist. New work on Twitter from Mec txt. My apologies if there's unreplied. Actually, I would like to echo this.
00:24:13.598 - 00:24:51.098, Speaker A: My apologies if there's unreplied comments, shoutouts, fellas. Twitter has been removing my notifications. Number of likes, retweets, replies to on my posts the past few days behind. Just know that I appreciate all of your support and reach outs. I'd actually like to echo that statement because I'm seeing all, like, where I'm even getting tagged. And, like, I don't see it in my notifications where Ilay will be like, tagging it, and then I'll discover it by going to Ilay's feed and I'll miss it in my notifications. So I just want you to know that if you do tag me and I don't see it, it's because I am not aware.
00:24:51.098 - 00:25:26.848, Speaker A: Okay. For whatever reason, the notifications aren't great, but this work is so another beautiful work by Mech TXT, who we also saw in that nifty gateway drop. New work by Francoise Gamma. Error? Dance 23. So continuing to explore this very simple idea of the body and movement. And here you have two people. So you gotta love the simplicity and the really rigorous, disciplined exploration of a one concept here of a concept with Francoise gamma and available for three Tezos edition of 30, minted on versum.
00:25:26.848 - 00:25:49.986, Speaker A: Still, Francois Gamma has been very loyal and on versum and just has stuck with versum, which I think is pretty cool. Eizo. So we heard from Eizo in the YouTube comments there. So here's the latest. It's very beautiful glitch work, isn't it? I mean, glitch video. Is that what you'd call this? Very beautiful. And so here is a lamp.
00:25:49.986 - 00:26:01.226, Speaker A: Okay. And we saw the bed and the couch. I think we saw a chair. So all cool. Let's just very quickly. Yeah. Remember these? So we're getting all the furniture here, and it's awesome.
00:26:01.226 - 00:26:25.694, Speaker A: And it's great to hear from. 802. Analog glitch video artist from Montreal. I used to live in Montreal for eight years. Lb new work, running away, using again, hardware here, similar to Eizo. Kind of an edgy work here with the very kind of glitchy, flashy runner here, available for five. Edition of 15 still available.
00:26:25.694 - 00:26:46.586, Speaker A: And who was this? This is a collaboration between Sky Goodman and drain liquefied subject edition of one. It sold on primary for 100 to phosphor operator. And I think it sold pretty quickly. Yeah, within 20 minutes. 100 tezos $100. Not bad. Okay.
00:26:46.586 - 00:27:04.234, Speaker A: So again, things are doing quite well here out in Tezos land. Here's another work. This is by Nicholas Sassoon. And this is a series, actually. Let me get lava studies. And I thought this was quite nice. Let me see if I can get it working here.
00:27:04.234 - 00:27:17.214, Speaker A: Start from the start, I guess. It's a bit of a heavy file. Here we go. Let me just reload this. I think I have another one. So here is the series. Okay.
00:27:17.214 - 00:27:40.210, Speaker A: So just doing these lava studies, and I want to show lava study number one. Already an offer of 100 editions of 25. Okay, so pretty nice market there for Nicholas Sassoon digital animation. We'll see if we can get it working. There we go. So, anyway, pretty nice work. Very nice.
00:27:40.210 - 00:28:17.286, Speaker A: What I'd call animated abstract work, one of the genres of digital art. I'm putting together a show, actually, in two weeks, less than two weeks, it'll be February 1 in Berlin. The genres of digital art. I'm just going to have a 30 to 45 minutes loop and basically have my thesis on what the genres of digital art are. Anyways, Nicholas Sassoon, Franco canadian artist with some very nice animated abstract works. Here's some generative art for what people are calling January sine waves. And I thought this was just a nice piece as well.
00:28:17.286 - 00:28:46.458, Speaker A: This by Ahmed Moussa. And continuing on, a new work by Lewis Osborne bouncing around. Let's see if this one will load up properly. And his market has heated up quite a bit, too, with the purchases from reachback, who is also known as Xcopy. Okay, so, doing very well here. Lewis Osborne. And so there is a new one.
00:28:46.458 - 00:29:09.874, Speaker A: And let's just look at the market here very quickly. Are these offers. This might have already happened here. Let's just see what happened. Yeah, it looks like the offers have been accepted again, additions of like. So you see to look accepted offers from 60 to 31, 50. So let's just call that 40.
00:29:09.874 - 00:29:31.872, Speaker A: And how many? 40 times 25. Is that $1,000? Not bad. You know, that is us for all us Canadians out there. Dan control with an outrageous series here. Here it is. Trap Nakia. And I thought this was pretty bold, which is why I put it on.
00:29:31.872 - 00:29:54.136, Speaker A: It's kind of semi outrageous. What are you doing, Dan? But maybe there's always an idea with Dan control. So trapnikia challenging his audience here. And you see it with trapped vans, trapped joypad, trapped cigarette. So pretty interesting trapped lighter. You know, you gotta like the experimentation here. Okay.
00:29:54.136 - 00:30:19.896, Speaker A: Like, I mean, yeah, like, maybe this isn't, you know, the. Your epitome of aesthetic gorgeousness, but that's maybe not the point. And maybe the aesthetic is in the idea. Right? So I think that's where Dan is going with this. So, pretty edgy work. A new one by Treza Rodanx, eels and wheels. So, again, doing in Microsoft paint, doing a hard juxtaposition with a color in the background.
00:30:19.896 - 00:30:46.704, Speaker A: This time, an eel and donuts. Pretty interesting at auction for two, so you might be able to get that pretty cheap. Here's a new artist. Zeiss bliatkas. New for me using Microsoft paint. And I believe I have their profile redefining the obsolete Ms paint nineties neotropical. So you see the experimentation here and so kind of tropical using MS paint edition of one.
00:30:46.704 - 00:31:22.184, Speaker A: We'll just see what it went for very quickly here. And I accept offer of 200. So Zeissus is doing very well, you know, again, the power of one of ones is like collectors kind of. It sets off the crazy button for collectors. If they like your work, it's like, ooh, you know, so one of ones are super duper powerful. Anyways, very interesting discovery here. Here's another work, bright rain, again, using MS paint, you know, so just very interesting experimentation as usual.
00:31:22.184 - 00:32:01.704, Speaker A: Continuing on Santiago with a new work existence and persons in the age of cucumber waterfalls from the edge of the core of the moon. And I raise my glass Png from an SVG from a sketch in early waffle drawing test run locally by San Diego. So all sorts of mayhem as usual here. What I like, though, is it's very recognizably Santiago's style, isn't it? And it's just a massive wide, again, has that pollock feel, right, just this kind of epic abstraction. And Santiago had some very nice comments yesterday about the show. So thank you, Santiago. Big shout out.
00:32:01.704 - 00:32:26.914, Speaker A: And here to. I mean, Santiago kind of raised the flag pointing to hasdrubal waffle. He's also pointed the flag to Curio fringe and Kazuhiro ihara. So I did a quick search, and he put out this work here as a tribute to them of sorts, a screenshot. So here's Kiryo fringe, just to give you guys a taste here. This is from November 26, 2022. This is their pinned tweet.
00:32:26.914 - 00:33:18.764, Speaker A: So you see the experimentation, though, right? And, okay, there's some Santiago, but just a little feel as to what's going on over here. And maybe this is. Yeah, I'm not sure who's who, but here's just a taste of their feed to just get a sense of their kind of experimental aesthetic appreciation. Of course, this is hasdrubal waffle, but again, we're just kind of, you know, the waffle situation here. We're just kind of zeroing in on what's going on over there because they have very interesting aesthetic ideas at the end of the day. Here's Kazuhiro ihara, also referenced in that Santiago tweet, mint. And we've looked at Kazuhiro's work before, actually, and he just minted on super rare, I believe it was this work just a genesis? So he just got on super rare, as far as I understand.
00:33:18.764 - 00:33:49.954, Speaker A: And this is all digital painting, by the way. It looks physical, but it's digital. And hologram gallery Chi Moscu using the waffle draws blogspot doodled by Chi Moscou Jackson. So big shout out to him. The hologram gallery again, out of Seattle there and just playing around. And for those that don't know that is using this software here, waffledraws dot blogspot.com. Again, you can choose color, choose your color and everything the size.
00:33:49.954 - 00:34:04.822, Speaker A: And you can choose the person. There you go. And choose a bigger size and whatever. So people are having fun with this. So very cool. Antonio loves a angel. Saints, prophets, revelation twelve.
00:34:04.822 - 00:34:29.777, Speaker A: So a new one buy for 39. Is that the list price? No, the list price. And again, edition of seven. So nice low edition here, sold for $17.77. So again, you know, more than $100 for your work. Not bad in a bear market, especially when it sells out instantly. It's different if you sit on it for six months and then it only sells for $100.
00:34:29.777 - 00:35:17.912, Speaker A: But if you're sitting on it for ten minutes, I mean, then you go, $100 is awesome, right? So again, wherever this market goes, we see the potential here. If Robnis V two is right, and I suspect he is, I think we're starting to see this in incremental form. What happens when us artists have 10,000 followers? You know, you don't need to charge very much. And all of a sudden Warhol is putting out his editions of 125 digitally, right? Putting out your prints or whoever your print person, you know, whoever, you know. Just for example, what would Warhol do today? He'd be all over this, I would think. Right, bedalla. Now we know Badala from these works over here.
00:35:17.912 - 00:35:40.764, Speaker A: And just put out a really nice, I'm looking at the clock here. Just put out a really nice landscape, I thought. And another just kind of original work. So I'm happy to track what she's, I think it's a she, which she's doing. Addition of 45, buy for 570 and there's still 34 left. So just a nice work here. Interesting artist, photographer and illustrator, Badala NFT.
00:35:40.764 - 00:35:57.960, Speaker A: And a new one by Flora Marquez. And she also put out a very nice tweet yesterday. I missed this one as well. This one I didn't see. So anyways, just another really nice drawing from a very cool artist. I was glad to get one of these. One of ones again, they're selling for like ten tezos.
00:35:57.960 - 00:36:32.924, Speaker A: Gotta love it. Remember Jastuja, who did the frog? And I think the frog is here. So these are works into the garden. And it uses like, again, I almost want to call it synoptic. Multiple experience of your eyes, photography, AI using everything at her disposal, at Jess's disposal, and making gorgeous works, art like we see here. So I think these are pretty cheap. It's a collection of sorts.
00:36:32.924 - 00:36:46.104, Speaker A: Let me just see, let me just see here very quickly. Reserve of 0.05 ETH. So these are very cheap. Look at this. The mushroom dance. Another just very.
00:36:46.104 - 00:37:07.244, Speaker A: Are these one of ones like, I mean, it seems like a. Yeah, this winning bid. So someone's got it for, you know, what's 0.05 ETH? Maybe $60 for a one of one in the. Into the garden. So FYI, pretty cool artists there using everything and you gotta love that. Another AI artist, peaceful street.
00:37:07.244 - 00:37:27.230, Speaker A: And I believe they do a combination. Let's actually look. So here's some of the work. Okay. And you see it's already being bid on 0.11. I mean, again, for artists that are just kind of, I don't want to say starting out, but maybe, I mean, who's been around for longer than two years on Twitter putting out art. There are people, but not many.
00:37:27.230 - 00:37:54.822, Speaker A: Okay? So a lot of these, you know, like, you see, there's four works here, you know, and maybe there's another collection or something. But all to say, if you're getting like $150 for your works in pretty. Another one's being bid on. This is being bid on, and this was sold. You're selling out all your works. Like, these aren't the stories I hear from friends in the physical art world out here in Berlin. You have to love it.
00:37:54.822 - 00:38:43.026, Speaker A: Okay? And it's sort of like, enjoy the bear market, as we keep repeating. Because in a bull market, all our friends from the physical art world are gonna be back and they're gonna want in, and it's gonna be really loud and noisy, and maybe that's ten years away, if ever. But we're having a good time over here. Like, people are making money, they're selling their art, they're buying great art. And what's not to like about that? So here's just a little description generated with AI, fully edited with Coreldraw, interestingly. And some few details were also added with Coreldraw. So again, this combination of AI and painting, where I still think the real, well, it's one of the many avenues with a huge amount of potential.
00:38:43.026 - 00:39:02.922, Speaker A: I also love the raw AI. I mean, the results of raw AI, as we see with strange things. Although he uses Photoshop here and there, sometimes it's raya. But all to say, this is another great avenue. And here, I believe, is an AI artist. Kind of along the similar lines. Matilda Fadyke artificial character AI.
00:39:02.922 - 00:39:37.776, Speaker A: So it just looks like pretty interesting, almost like, is it Alex Katz? You know, almost has an Alex Katz feel to it, painting. And do we have another work? Yeah. So anyways, interesting colors, too, these very muted kind of winter colors. I particularly like this piece and the nice kind of yellow beanie against the gray sky. Nice work. Matilda Fadike and Venta with another very interesting work. Again, combining, I believe, AI and painting.
00:39:37.776 - 00:40:04.904, Speaker A: And this work is called burnt ends and current bit of 0.1 from clownvamp. So again, continuing to sell like a lot of. Again, I see boom times here. Like it's bear market. What? Bear market. I mean, I keep saying that poly Jojo with some very interesting ideas here using manuscripts and AI pestilencie auctor pharmaceutical folio.
00:40:04.904 - 00:40:25.060, Speaker A: So this is kind of interesting. Almost looks like he put the virus here into manuscript. And combining the two, which is pretty, actually interesting. And so anyways, more interesting work. This is a one of one available for three. And I actually picked up this last one that we're going to look at. As the music goes.
00:40:25.060 - 00:40:35.724, Speaker A: I picked up this one for three Tazos pirate ship. A fitting end to this episode. Thank you for joining me once again, everyone. Hope you have a great weekend. And until next time, take care.
