00:00:03.800 - 00:00:38.222, Speaker A: It is too much fun. Welcome back and happy New Year to everybody out there watching a big global hello. How are you doing? From inner space here Artist journal, September 4, 2023. Broadcasting from the courtroom of the imagination here in Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pokebelly and I welcome you back. So let's get to it. Another beautiful work by Yuhei.
00:00:38.222 - 00:00:58.580, Speaker A: By Kuhei Yamashita. Let me double check the name here. Kuhei Yamashita it is. Who did that stunner that we started with kind of out of nowhere with this very original style. I think we saw the tv leaking, remember with the green. Let's very quickly bring up so that you remember this. We kind of went into a few of them.
00:00:58.580 - 00:01:23.346, Speaker A: Where is was? I think it was an older work, maybe remember this? And it was an older work, but it was posted on Twitter and I'd never seen it before. Where is it? Here it is. It's actually not that old. All this work has been released since like June. If we check the date on here, June 19. So Kuhei Yamashita, that's already at 69 tezos. Amazing.
00:01:23.346 - 00:01:35.866, Speaker A: So has been doing really well. This awesome calculator. Yeah. So let's get into it here. So first of all, the work is beautiful here. Posted on Twitter. I missed it.
00:01:35.866 - 00:02:05.414, Speaker A: Melody melodies captivate the audience and bring color and joy to the heart. So. But it brought up another interesting issue, which I'm seeing more and more, especially if not exclusively on Tezos, because I mean, it's part of the, you know, the feature that Tezos artwork is cheap is also a bug in certain respects. Let me show you how. I mean, so edition of ten. And so this is from the one tazo shop. So Kuhei is selling these for like $0.68
00:02:05.414 - 00:03:05.878, Speaker A: each. And part of the issue with selling things almost too cheap is this is a bit of a trend that we've been seeing here. Historic, alive, they didn't do anything. But where you start seeing people trying to buy up all the works and usually what happens. And this did not happen here, maybe because not a number here Nan got a copy without historicalive realizing, who knows? I don't want to jump to conclusions, but something we're seeing more and more commonly on the blockchain is this. These kind of vandal collectors, shall we call them, who are buying up all the additions before anybody else can and then not in this case, which is partly why I wanted to use this case because I'm not out to name and shame here. But then you're seeing people will burn, say you see, this is an addition of ten, buy ten.
00:03:05.878 - 00:03:38.818, Speaker A: And for those that aren't familiar with blockchain technology, you can burn tokens. So then people will burn nine, let's say. And then they have their one of one and they go, hey, look at this. I just got a one of one for ten tezos. Okay, so that did not happen here, but it kind of looks like it was going to happen. And there was an offer by historic alive for the last one and it wasn't accepted. And then eventually to historicalives credit, they were transferred back to Kuhei Yamashita.
00:03:38.818 - 00:04:41.130, Speaker A: And then collectors came out and bought as normal. So this is an increasing issue. And it kind of brought up this thought in my mind because there is a moral consideration, of course, that one thinks, you know, first consideration here, just because it's digital doesn't mean it's not property. This is digital property. So if people are going out and burning works, I mean, the analog would be buying a Warhol screen print edition of 100 and burning 99, like literally physically burning 99 of them so that your one is worth more. So morally, I would say it's more than morally dubious, right? This is pretty clearly it's destroying property, digital property in this case, but property nevertheless. I mean, we all buy this art assuming that it's property.
00:04:41.130 - 00:05:12.710, Speaker A: So if we destroy it, it's also property, first of all. And that's just the moral consideration. But then I asked myself, is this legal? Is this legal? Like? And look, I mean, the thought crossed my mind early on. I never did anything about it because I thought it was morally questionable. And it's actually more than morally questionable. I saw it on a Turkarak edition of three. And I saw it just sitting there for months, nobody buying any of them.
00:05:12.710 - 00:05:46.156, Speaker A: I was like, oh, it's tempting, but I think at the very minimum one would have to message the artist because the artist has their own intentions. And you see here part of the problem just on a. See this royalties, Kuhei may have a strategy here that they go, oh, I'm going to sell these cheap. I want to sell out really quickly all my work, but then I'm going to capture it on the royalty here. Or maybe I think just 25% royalty. It's actually a fairly high royalty here. You can have it cheap, but there's going to be a high royalty.
00:05:46.156 - 00:06:30.444, Speaker A: But then if they all get burned, then what happens to Kuhei's plan all of a sudden? So one would have to contact the artist, one would think, from a moral perspective. But then I did some research, and you may actually have to contact the artist from a legal perspective. Check this out. So I asked myself, I asked actually first, Google, is it legal to destroy artworks that I buy? And this is what came out. Destruction of copyrighted works and limited legal protections. In general, someone who purchases a, purchases a copyrighted work has the right to destroy it. If you buy a copyrighted book, you are free to throw it away or to give it away to someone else.
00:06:30.444 - 00:07:37.084, Speaker A: However, the Visual Arts Rights act, also known as the Veranda Vara, the Visual Arts Rights act, is a federal law that provides some additional protections for certain artworks. Its scope is extremely limited to fall within the act. So this is how, what would qualify as being protected by the Visual Artists Rights act? The work must be a painting, a drawing, a print, a photograph or sculpture that has only a single copy, or that was released as a limited edition of 200 or fewer copies. So this is an edition of ten. So although the scope of this law is very limited, it looks like it qualifies, doesn't it? This is a print that was released as a limited edition of 200 or fewer. It seems actually super clear. According to justia.com,
00:07:37.084 - 00:08:10.824, Speaker A: works released as a limited edition must be signed and consecutively numbered. If an artwork is reproduced in a publication, viral rights still protect the original. So here there is ambiguity. But I think because I think it could be argued, because it's on the blockchain, it is authenticated. It is, you could argue, because it came from the wallet, it is digitally signed, but one could argue a point of contention. And consecutively numbered. Well, they are numbered, so to speak.
00:08:10.824 - 00:09:08.428, Speaker A: Each is a separate token. So it does seem like it would fall within this visual arts rights act. Now you might ask, this is a federal law, by the way, in the United States. So if you're actually a collector, you know, quote unquote collector, who is basically buying up these editions and then burning them in the United States, you may actually be violating federal law in the United States. American justice. Now, I went a little bit further here with chat GPT, just to give us context, and I don't want to dwell too far on this, but I do find it a little disturbing, which is why I'm. And I think people should know, and also people might be doing this without being aware that they're violating the law, potentially.
00:09:08.428 - 00:10:29.208, Speaker A: I'm not a lawyer, this is not legal advice, but people should know because maybe they're thinking, oh, this is just a great way of getting a 101. Screw the morality, I'm going to do this. Well, just so you know, the Visual Arts Rights act of 1990 is us federal law that grants certain rights to visual artists. Vara primarily addresses the rights of artists concerning works of recognized stature and gives artists the ability to prevent intentional distortion, mutilation, or other modifications of their works that would harm their honor or reputation. It also grants artists the right to prevent any destruction of certain works of art, and in some instances, could require the owner of the work to give notice to the artist if the artwork is to be removed or altered. So again, we would one assume, if one assumes that digital property translates to physical property, which I think is pretty clear, again, it starts to look, and again, not legal advice, but it starts to look like it actually falls pretty clearly, I would argue within this context. This is the spirit, one could argue, of this legislation, again, us federal law.
00:10:29.208 - 00:11:03.928, Speaker A: Now, I also checked, what are the penalties just for our edification here? The penalties for violating the Visual Arts Rights act can be both monetary and injunctive. If a person infringes upon the rights granted to artists under Vara, they may be subject to the following remedies, actual damages and profits. So all the. Because why are people doing this? Probably because they think the one of one is going to be more precious. It'll be worth more money, it'll make their collection more precious. Right? There's only one. It's a unique.
00:11:03.928 - 00:11:52.164, Speaker A: And on the other side of this whole conversation, I think one of the learning things, beyond all this legalese, one of the things we can learn is the preciousness of the one of one. You see how collectors, when they see a one of one, some collectors, you know, they go bananas, so to speak, like, it really does put a work on a whole other level. So it really does. As an artist, you have to ask yourself, should I really be making this an addition? Because if this is a nice artwork, collectors may really want. Want to want this one of one. So, you know, Kuhei is selling this for ten tezos. I mean, maybe as a one of one, could get 100 tezos for these works.
00:11:52.164 - 00:12:23.892, Speaker A: There's also another part in the damages. So, you know, let me just. There are criminal penalties. Like, this is how serious this is. While Vara itself does not outline criminal criminal penalties, other areas of copyright law do. However, it's essential to understand that criminal copyright infringement. So in order to do it criminally, copyright infringement requires the violation to be willful and either for the purpose of commercial advantage or private financial gain.
00:12:23.892 - 00:13:05.294, Speaker A: So not only is this a violation potentially of copyright law, this could be considered criminal copyright violation. Right? I mean, it seems willful and either for the purpose of commercial advantage or private financial gain. It is willful and it is for the purpose of private financial gain, potentially commercial, but let's call it private financial gain for your collection. So I just want to share that because it seems to be becoming a norm and it looks to me. Feel free to disagree. Leave a comment. To me, it's starting to look like criminal copyright violation.
00:13:05.294 - 00:13:51.248, Speaker A: Again, not find, not legal advice. I have no training in legal advice, but just as somebody looking, it kind of looks that way to me. Feel free to leave a comment if you feel otherwise. So continuing on back to the art. Kyuhei Yamashita so aesthetics, another stunner here. And so just very cool work here. Working with these, I guess we'd call them spectrums of sort and kind of almost has that analog video glitch kind of look to it and using them kind of masks within masks, one could say masks are like flat areas that you kind of block out.
00:13:51.248 - 00:14:22.874, Speaker A: So it's almost like the toothpaste here has been masked that is coming out of the tube and then here just adding to the creativity again making it look easy. We see the curve of the toothbrush and the distortion just adding to the fun. And again, this beautiful flat background. Just awesome, awesome work here from Kuhei Yamashita. Also released and only a tezos. So very cool work. Big thank you and shout out to all five who have minted ten military aircraft.
00:14:22.874 - 00:14:49.876, Speaker A: You have to know. So I'm adding to the promoted stories series on Zora. I just minted this and here it is. And one thing just for Zora, if anybody from Zora would be watching, we need maximize on the image just to make it larger. That would be my one request. Otherwise it's a fantastic platform. Very fun.
00:14:49.876 - 00:15:18.394, Speaker A: And so here is the work, sort of up close and personal and yeah, again playing with monitor outputs and sampling across layers. Also big thank you. Sold out of mountains finally edition of ten from the eight bit Nature series. Thank you anonymous collector who also picked up the forest. So that was nice. Adding some tezos to my wallet after a while here so that is great. Quickly checking out the comments on last show.
00:15:18.394 - 00:15:47.914, Speaker A: This was very helpful from Kyle Flemmer. Hi Adrian, there's a guided tour mode so referring to oncyber, remember if you saw last episode how I was mentioning I just want a tour guided tour button on on cyber so I don't need to navigate. There is a guided tour mode that takes you through the on cyber gallery. If you click on the button with nine dots next to your PFP at the bottom. It will bring up a menu with the tour option. It's hands free, but you can skip ahead to speed things up. So very helpful.
00:15:47.914 - 00:15:57.694, Speaker A: So I'm thrilled to hear that they actually have that. So we'll have to test that out. Kyle Flemmer, thank you for the comment. Also. Thank you. Score for the comment. This is gonz.
00:15:57.694 - 00:16:20.722, Speaker A: You're welcome. More than happy to feature. I think it's so cool that the, you know, digital artists are showing in the physical world, especially in this global NFT scene. I think it's super interesting. Santiago, thanks for the comment. And, ah, heck, this was very helpful. Artist who pulled the paper through the printers was Wade Guyton, and everybody should know who Wade Guyton is.
00:16:20.722 - 00:16:46.894, Speaker A: Let me just see if I can search Google for Wade Guyton. So a very, very cool artist uses printers. I first saw works by Wade Guyton at the old location of the Whitney. That was actually probably the first time I went to the Whitney. See these xs here? I actually didn't love the show. I learned to like Wade Guyton's work a lot over the years. I didn't love the show, to be honest.
00:16:46.894 - 00:17:30.983, Speaker A: The first one anyway. But great artist, one of my favorite artists right now, it was a lot of xs and it felt more conceptual. But then as time went on, like, it looks like here, he's probably printing brushstrokes, which for me, and drips, I don't know if you can see that. That's where things start to get quite a bit more interesting for me, traveling through the mediums, all of a sudden, it's like, okay, this, we were kind of discussing that with the drips and Jasper John's screen print from the other day. So, yeah, so, and of course, some of my favorite works are the New York Times screenshots. Let's just look. Yeah, these are probably my favorite.
00:17:30.983 - 00:18:02.174, Speaker A: Again, these are works that I wish I would have made. That's what I like when I see this. I just go, oh, and what's interesting about what Wade Guyton does and kind of part of his trademark and using the process, revealing, kind of leaving your trail, so to speak. We talk about this in modern art oftentimes. So the trail here is, this is how wide the printer is, as far as I understand, Wade Geithen's work. So you see there's this, like, you know, it's not matching up perfectly. That's become part of Wade Guyton's style.
00:18:02.174 - 00:18:30.334, Speaker A: So he prints first this side, then maybe this side maybe pulls it through a bit to distort it a bit or makes it crooked somehow. And even here you start seeing the printers running out of ink. So. And there's a specific printer that Wadegiten really likes. So anyways, thank you ahec for. And I love this stuff. I mean, yeah, I mean, this is the food of a lot of my work, frankly, are just Internet ads, screenshots.
00:18:30.334 - 00:18:55.356, Speaker A: So huge fan of what Wade Guyton did here. What I kind of think to myself, just a brilliant solution. Because how do you do the New York Times, how do you do the news, a screenshot of the news and make it great. Wade Guyton has found a way. So really interesting artist. Well worth researching. Back to on cyber, I made the most Agnes Evergrace Evier Grace Evergrace.
00:18:55.356 - 00:19:30.096, Speaker A: I made the most obnoxious on cyber gallery you could never ask for. And what's kind of hilarious about this is, as obnoxious as it is, I find it one of the most creative on cyber galleries. It's actually one of the most interesting, I would say kind of amazingly. And I bet Agnes was probably just throwing things around here randomly, haphazardly. Let's put a couple of cars and everything. But it's actually a pretty cool looking gallery here. So cool work.
00:19:30.096 - 00:19:59.580, Speaker A: And just kind of interesting how sometimes the less self conscious you are of trying to make something great, sometimes the better it comes out. It's probably one of my favorite galleries I've ever seen on cyber. We should try the tour on that. I should have brought that up. Continuing on, I'm not art. So this is the gallery, I think, that is doing the patchwork glitch exhibition that is co curated by Sky Goodman and Empress Trash, which is now minting on objects. So remember that.
00:19:59.580 - 00:20:25.040, Speaker A: So here we see John Kate's Sabato and Empress trash works. And there's Sabato's work that we saw the other day. So how cool is this? Chicago's first NFT gallery you can see written behind. So maybe a historic place here, maybe a historic moment. And just very cool. The liquid halls of modernity. So just really awesome work.
00:20:25.040 - 00:20:40.440, Speaker A: I think that's John Cates up there. So that must be Empress trash. Very cool. Continuing on, one more photo. And this is from Sky Goodman before the crowd arrived. So at the opening, and I'm pretty sure Sky Goodman is based out of Chicago. And that's cool too.
00:20:40.440 - 00:21:10.616, Speaker A: Put an object.com and everything. You know, referring to our earlier discussion on the minting, I thought I saw on versum. And I actually checked this morning, it seems to have disappeared. But I thought when you minted on versum, you could limit, or maybe when you list, you can limit the amount that a wallet can buy. Let's say you want to limit to two addition and two editions that a wallet can buy. You know, if you can do that, I don't see why object wouldn't implement that.
00:21:10.616 - 00:21:39.470, Speaker A: And there are probably ways around that on the blockchain just as far as this, minting everything and burning all of them except for one. But I would think there, it sure would make it inconvenient. Let's say if object, you know, started, you know, putting little stumbling blocks like that. I'm sure there are ways to do it with smart contracts. But anyway, let's not get off topic here. We made our point at the beginning. So just more cool looking show here.
00:21:39.470 - 00:22:10.134, Speaker A: This looks fantastic. I wonder if we have this later in the show because there's a work that kind of looks like that. Okay, a couple of comments here and let's run through the rest of this. Rob from foundation I thought this was actually really interesting. Artists, please ensure your social media pages are linked to your foundation profile. One of the things notable collectors like to do before they collect from a new artist is check their socials to see how active they are and what current projects they are working on. If you don't have any socials linked, it may deter collectors from collecting your work.
00:22:10.134 - 00:22:48.346, Speaker A: And I wish I could remember where I saw it, but I just saw another thing from the contemporary art world. You know, if you only have social media and you don't have a website, well, you know, you aren't doing enough. So just all to say, there's no way around it. I was going to say you can't win as an artist, but the reality is you're in a business and you're an entrepreneur. So in a sense, I agree. Actually, you should have social media, otherwise it's just not going to. Why wouldn't you? Maybe for time, but you just should have it.
00:22:48.346 - 00:23:20.566, Speaker A: And this is also true for a lot of contemporary art people that aren't on Twitter, right? Or x or however people want to call it. So. Yeah, so you should probably have, I mean, if we zoomed out here, you should probably have Instagram, Twitter and a website. And then I think you're basically covered. But interesting. I think it's just important for people to know, I assume most people that watch this basically, but who knows? I don't know that actually, this is super interesting. Strange thing.
00:23:20.566 - 00:24:07.018, Speaker A: So this is something that happened while I was on vacation, that super rare put like a brilliant use of their token. I've been sitting on my token since the airdrop like two years ago, and there was never much use for them, but they have come up with a brilliant use for them. So, strange thing, who's also on super rare, just created my curation pool for super rare rare protocol, where stakers are rewarded with a portion of marketplace fees when the stakey sells nfts in the marketplace. So in other words, let me bring up the page here. So this is app rare XYZ, the super rare protocol. Rare protocol, a curation protocol for nfts. So basically, I mean, look at this.
00:24:07.018 - 00:24:48.014, Speaker A: And I brought this up. You can basically be early investor here, so to speak, on Tyler Hobbes, whose works sell for like $100,000. Oftentimes, sometimes a lot more. There's only two, three stakers here. And the earlier you are staking on here, the more you kind of get. It's sort of like this curved, as far as I understand, this kind of curved thing. So the earlier you are, so all to say it's super interesting, I actually set up, I was actually really pleased someone put in 1200 there.
00:24:48.014 - 00:25:15.734, Speaker A: So that was really nice to see. So let's just read a little bit more. Rare holders stake tokens in support of other people. So you stake with the artist, whether artist collectors or curators, staking someone gives them a social boost and provides a curation signal to the ecosystem. So the more people want to stake in a certain artist, kind of the higher up the food chain they are. And I just think it's really cool. A brilliant use of the token there.
00:25:15.734 - 00:25:29.122, Speaker A: So just really interesting to note there. So app rare XYZ. Check it out. I think it's super interesting. And look, I mean, Tyler Hobbs. So that is pretty cool. Good use of the token, seemingly.
00:25:29.122 - 00:25:52.064, Speaker A: Let's see what happens. Dan Control, being an artist who joined these spaces relatively late, I have never experienced the bull market that everyone praises and remembers with nostalgia of so many sales and of course, high sales. Maybe this is good for me. This is my bull market and I'm proud of it. And you all. So just a really cool comment here from Dan Control. This is my bull market.
00:25:52.064 - 00:26:38.864, Speaker A: Beautiful. And Dan Control is doing wonderful. And it's actually pretty amazing that Dan has come after the bull market. You know, that historic bull market, which is probably why people talk, it was probably the biggest bull market of all time, 2021, you know, so, yeah, cool. Comment and just interesting comment from Dan Control mech TxT special notes to other artists, especially to the ones that have just started fresh. Something I wish I knew very early on. To date, I've never gotten invited to any galleries or gated art market elites, never got my work chosen to be displayed on any big screens in random metropolitan junctions in buildings across the world, very rarely displayed on featured section, and even on the platforms that I use the most.
00:26:38.864 - 00:27:22.444, Speaker A: And that's like a pretty prominent artist mech TXT in this space. It's a nice thing to have your work displayed on these places, and it certainly is a big plus that everyone would love to have. But that's not the focus. We have to remember that our genuine audience, our genuine appreciators, came mostly as a side effect of our daily interaction with people, especially here in the town hall. The one who's responsible and frankly has the power to connect with our appreciators isn't galleries or the elite art markets, but us. And I just want to add to this, I think it's a like, sort of like the older you get, the less you care about, at least in my experience, the less I care about any of these things. Especially with the blockchain.
00:27:22.444 - 00:27:49.844, Speaker A: In a sense, you could argue your audience isn't even born yet. So in a lot of these, and the more I go out to physical art world situations, the more I just want to go back to this digital world. It's so much easier and funner and lighter. It's a lighter experience here. It's just like, it's fun. It's funner. Let's continue here.
00:27:49.844 - 00:28:17.148, Speaker A: And also, it's a hard task to filter artworks and artists to be featured, to be included in exhibitions. And if our works didn't get chosen, it doesn't mean that our work is bad, or that some of them have malicious intent to deliberately leave us out. Sometimes it's just very easy to miss one out in a million. And absolutely don't be discouraged. Keep going. So exactly. And I just echo that whole comment.
00:28:17.148 - 00:28:52.970, Speaker A: And here's just a beautiful work here by mech TXT. Again, playing with the classical, and you just see the process again. So putting the outline first and then filling it in so you almost see how manual mech TXT works. And you wonder if this was traced or if he's still putting it side by side. Because again, maybe just doing the outline, you know, you could trace and then do everything else manually. But anyway, looking great in aseprite, I thought this was interesting. This is Jamie Derringer, I'm not sure if we've looked at their work.
00:28:52.970 - 00:29:33.660, Speaker A: I actually brought up a work of theirs on Twitter, just to give you an idea. So Jamie Derringer is doing some weaving GM making slow progress on this weaving. So again, you see sort of the style of the digital artwork, and then you see the beauty that comes out in the weaving process. So just really beautiful. And I don't know if you can, if this, like, I assume this is all being done manually, but I don't know. And I think we saw Kristin Roose doing this a few months ago, you know, and imagine you did, like, mech TXT done with textile. And again, textile, fascinating tradition.
00:29:33.660 - 00:30:06.664, Speaker A: I mean, if you go to, I think it's the Victoria and someone museum. It's a big design, the main design museum in London, you can see the Raphael's tapestries, and there is a great tradition of tapestry. And it's just a really. And something happens, you know, as I like to say, that alchemical transformation that happens when you're traveling through the mediums. And we see it here. So just very interesting work there. This was also interesting remi forte.
00:30:06.664 - 00:30:50.058, Speaker A: So remember, remi forte is a programmer, so I assume, and I may not be correct, but I bet you this is all being done with programming. And what's so interesting about that is we see all the random. It looks very arty, shall we say? It looks very manual, the way this is all being kind of done. So really impressive if that's in fact what this is. Moving to our kind of buffet of artworks here. Look at this stunner by Pamelo Ceirone. My mum was actually telling me how to pronounce, is it Ceyrone? Maybe how to pronounce the c, I should know, with italian background.
00:30:50.058 - 00:31:12.982, Speaker A: I'm learning Italian, so I'm going to work on my pronunciation here. Look how beautiful this is. Actually, Pamelo put out two brilliant artworks. This one is for being auctioned at a minimum bid of 25 tezos. For this one of one, there's a day left. A stunning, stunning work here. You know, Pamela has been super prolific.
00:31:12.982 - 00:31:38.534, Speaker A: And again, kind of reminds me of like, Ed Morolla, by making so much work, it's just like you're increasing your odds for putting out gorgeous masterpieces. Remember, the artist is present, not the artist. The dreamer is present. Or the artist is dreaming. Remember, the artist is dreaming. This is like, to me, you know, Pamela just keeps producing, producing, producing, and then bam. And then bam.
00:31:38.534 - 00:32:17.684, Speaker A: A double kind of header here. And look at this. So this is a collaboration with Fatsuki, Fatsu dem, who is the musician. Like, super cool music, too. So we bring the new year on in style. Almost feels like Robert fripping. It's like a analog synth version of Robert Fripp or something.
00:32:17.684 - 00:32:39.924, Speaker A: So pretty rad, like super cool. 13 tezos edition of ten. There is one left, so that is on secondary, and then it's 16. So these sold for only four tazos, $0.20. So three, three, $3. You could have bought this. Insanely cool.
00:32:39.924 - 00:32:57.944, Speaker A: And look, you even see the synth. So, yeah, really cool work there from Pamela. Congratulations on that. Internet fights. So this is interesting, LXT. So kind of a. Not going to say a new direction here, but a.
00:32:57.944 - 00:33:27.394, Speaker A: It kind of feels like a bit. Not a total leap, but a new plane here. Let me show you, actually, their other work here. So really cool. Kind of Internet, kind of has that post Internet feel. You know, windows retro. You got the old hourglass here, the old Windows 95 operating system iconography, the emojis, and you see the self conscious kind of, you know, digital pixelation.
00:33:27.394 - 00:33:55.712, Speaker A: Shall we say, Internet fight. So, eleven and cool topic. Almost originally featured on the New York Times. Wow, how cool is that? And so here's some of the other work by lxtxcx png wizard. So as you see here, you see hints of some of these other works. And I guess you see it here, but it really feels in this work, like everything is just clicking here. So a really nice work here from lxtxcx.
00:33:55.712 - 00:34:22.672, Speaker A: Continuing on Guru, guru hyena. And I'm not sure if we've looked at their work before. I'll bring up their page. Just kind of an interesting kind of digital experiment here. Gm with what looks like some maybe japanese writing. Found unknown old folder and not sure Gugu experience is the name of the series. And let's give Guguru a follow here.
00:34:22.672 - 00:34:48.874, Speaker A: Very cool here. Very, very cool. So really cool experimentation from Guru, Guru hyena. This was also interesting. I was in Kristen Roose's collection there, and I discovered this artist, Carson. This is all coding this. And so you see the logo for X or Twitter, and pretty cool.
00:34:48.874 - 00:35:14.378, Speaker A: I mean, one thing's to do this kind of manually. Another thing is to code this. And again, it's like that roughness, that unexacting kind of look is really just. It's very satisfying and very arty. The non perfectness, how it goes outside, the outlines. Beautifully done. Look, it looks like there's random r equal random.
00:35:14.378 - 00:35:35.014, Speaker A: So maybe working with random in the code. Potentially very cool. This came out about a month ago, July 24. So very, very cool here. And here's some of their other work, Carson. I make games and game art. Currently studying game design.
00:35:35.014 - 00:36:03.950, Speaker A: So very interesting. I brought up a couple of other works, too, that really just kind of leapt off the screen at me here. I don't see the random. I wonder if this is the code, right, this looks like the code, so just super interesting. And I love actually how remix of one of your previous works by Carson Kompan. So this is probably the code for this. So pretty interesting.
00:36:03.950 - 00:36:16.882, Speaker A: Beautiful art here from Carson. January 2023, day 31. And here's one more. January 2023, day 22. Shadows. And again, this looks like the code. Only eight tezos.
00:36:16.882 - 00:36:38.494, Speaker A: Edition of ten. Might have to pick that up, but I think I only have seven tezos in the wallet here. So pretty cool work. Very cool work. And beautiful, I might add. I love how, you know one thing I really like, you see how it's red orange? It's like the rainbow until the very end, and then it's just the orange. That is very cool.
00:36:38.494 - 00:37:11.810, Speaker A: So, continuing on, Sabato, look at this super cool pixelated sunset landscape. A glitch sunset from Bemini run. So I assume this is from a video game, but it looks like the pixelation is too small for your typical nintendo glitch rom. So all to say, really beautiful work here from Sabato. I didn't see it minted anywhere, but I assume it will be at some point. And mech txt, I mean, it's incredible. Arise, daughters of Eve.
00:37:11.810 - 00:37:46.262, Speaker A: It's incredible how much work that mech has that seems to not be released. And just awesome colors here we see that light gray and then shifting through the different grays, almost like gray and orange, even though it's more like a neon kind of pink peach. Just really interesting. Incredible how much work mech TXT puts out, making it look easy. Side hustle. So we know side hustle. Side Hustle is the artist who's taken a bit of a break, who does these super cool interiors, gifs, very prolific.
00:37:46.262 - 00:38:16.184, Speaker A: Has been experimenting a lot. Again, these kind of interiors with synths, which I'm a huge fan of and also did those Giorgio de Chirico works. Let me see if I can bring those up quickly here, the sweaters. So we know the side hustle has collaborated with LB on that awesome series. Very interesting series there. And this piece here. So, you know, one of those artists, you might be able to kind of come in now and get kind of cheap.
00:38:16.184 - 00:38:38.872, Speaker A: So, new experimentations here. Moire Beach Pixel Nachos 2023. So, playing with pixelation, but in a whole other different kind of style here. Look at the sun with these horizontal lines, but then gradients over top. Very interesting experimentation. You see the reflection of the sun in the water. Very original looking.
00:38:38.872 - 00:39:10.344, Speaker A: And so, edition of ten for five tezos from side Hustle. Great to see them back. This was a super cool work, Pomelo. So let me get. The music's surprisingly similar, isn't it, in style to our last one we listened to by Pamelo Cerrone and that other. And the musician. So very cool to this.
00:39:10.344 - 00:39:43.778, Speaker A: Retro vinyl, maybe cigarettes here, not sure. So, two minutes and 42 seconds here. And a nice track. So, before I start violating copyright here, I will have to stop that. But that is an edition of one, and I think it sold for ten tezos. Earlreno Tez got a wonderful deal there. Got it for like six.
00:39:43.778 - 00:40:05.966, Speaker A: $7. Here's some of Pomelo's other work. Making and collecting art. And here you see, just so you see here, almost like kind of a leap of sorts. It's great to see, because all of a sudden, you know, this is cool. This is cool. But it seems like, in terms of, let's say, the ambition of the work, this is kind of next level, in a sense, feeling.
00:40:05.966 - 00:40:22.078, Speaker A: So beautiful work here. Very beautiful. From Pomelo, Timothy Jullien with a new experimentation shortscape. And let's just check the time. Got to speed up here. So, more, you got to love where this is going. And I see it with myself as well.
00:40:22.078 - 00:40:54.030, Speaker A: It's sort of like, the more you practice, you just have to put time into it. And the more you do it, the more you're going to like the results. And that's what I see across the board here. So if you're, you know, unhappy, or you feel like you're not doing work that you feel you could be doing, you just have to sit yourself in front of your, you know, tablet computer or canvas, whatever the case is, and just keep working through it until it starts coming out the way you like. It's. There's no shortcuts. So, beautiful work here from Timothy Jullien.
00:40:54.030 - 00:41:17.552, Speaker A: Fifty cents. Fifty tazos cents. Pippi Universal. It looks like a hawk is being interviewed here and there we have a microphone and this beautiful kind of collage style here. This time with a bit more action in terms of being gifified, as I like to say here. And this is called importante by Pippi Universal edition of five. And there are two left.
00:41:17.552 - 00:41:35.896, Speaker A: Cool work. And here's another kind of mysterious one. Para pansar. And really nice. I love Pipi's work here. These collages, and then just this great design in the background. And here, this looks like a meme that has kind of been treated here.
00:41:35.896 - 00:41:58.896, Speaker A: So kind of mysterious there. Eight tezos. And there's one left. And continuing on, wasteman Goldman with another failed artist. 36, self portrait cactus. So this looks like the failed artist is trying to paint with a hot dog and mustard perhaps, or yellow paint. And there are the black fries here.
00:41:58.896 - 00:42:15.180, Speaker A: And the artist is actually painting themselves. So self referential. So almost a inner portrait here. And here's cactus. Cactus. So here are some cigarettes. So just more really cool work here from wasteman gold Minevich.
00:42:15.180 - 00:42:33.692, Speaker A: And I have to say, I quite like the contrast that's created with this spray paint. It's quite nicely done. So nice work here. Open edition for $0.69 each. Diego Barrow, back on the scene. Some sunsets look alike, and this is a brand new work here.
00:42:33.692 - 00:42:56.572, Speaker A: Putting the colors here, leaving the process a little bit. The title and the signature. And so beautiful sunset here using procreate. Digital drawing made on procreate and iPad. Only a tezos 50, and there are nine left. Great to see Diego Barrow, I believe out of Argentina, who just had that show about a month ago with the ballpoint pen. Yuri, time to get tired again.
00:42:56.572 - 00:43:12.218, Speaker A: So I haven't seen this before. So it looks like just cool experimentation from Yuri J. Here. Always experimenting and doing interesting things. Human kernel, president of profile Pictures. So another profile picture here. I believe this is a one of.
00:43:12.218 - 00:43:45.962, Speaker A: One kind of has a bit of a glitch rom feel in the background, but maybe that's just patterning and, you know, classic human kernel sort of look where each kind of area is almost an outline to be treated differently with different patterning. This is made with love from you and to you. So maybe this was sent to someone or. No, it was done as a auction, so sold for 50 tezos. So nice work from human kernel and Grimoire. Love is blind, deaf, and dumb. So cool work here.
00:43:45.962 - 00:44:20.882, Speaker A: I'm not going to leave it on for too long because of the flash. Classic crypto art with the surveillance camera and cuda yield to unknown. And this is edition of 15, and it looks like it's sold out on primary already. Some cool pixel art with almost a Sci-Fi sort of feeling here. If this was black and white, you could almost see a popple influence, but quite different at the same time. Would hang well in the same room, let's just put it that way. So some cool Sci-Fi pixel art here from cuda yield to unknown bion secondary for ten tezos.
00:44:20.882 - 00:44:39.870, Speaker A: Continuing on. Silva san twos with some Nintendo glitch roms here. A couple escape afterburner two. So staying real prolific and consistent. And so keeping it interesting here. The flying and the racing games tend to do quite well or tend to look pretty exciting. So nice work there.
00:44:39.870 - 00:44:58.316, Speaker A: And here's another one. Roll up. So playing with this kind of scroll, this vertical scroll that we saw with the waterfall, I believe, way back when, maybe six weeks ago. So very interesting and cool work from Silva Santuz here. Buy for $0.50, edition of 50. Continuing on.
00:44:58.316 - 00:45:21.064, Speaker A: Mika Aladef, artifact number 30. So cool. Just kind of glitchery here. And pixelation, digitalia, whatever you want to call it. You can see it's a body, but it is being quite treated, shall we say, glitched. And so just cool work. 5000 by 5000 addition of three selling out at twelve tezos each.
00:45:21.064 - 00:45:46.900, Speaker A: Lorna mills with a cool nature work here. And a nice warm green background there. And this beautiful flowers here, opening up. And so that I saw on Instagram, I didn't see it minted anywhere. And another flower tiegenhof. An edition of one for 20 tezos here. And some nice kinda, you know, dithered pixel art, seemingly.
00:45:46.900 - 00:46:02.316, Speaker A: And a beautiful rose painting. A rose, 20 tezos, only $13. So it's a great time to collect right now. Datura, I don't think we looked at this. I may be wrong on that. This is an edition of one for 60 tezos. I feel like I would have remembered that.
00:46:02.316 - 00:46:25.420, Speaker A: Babylon 102. So a nice abstract here by detour. Very nice work here with some nice color. And just interesting what I want to call mark making with these, you know, not quite square pixels here. Cellular automatic glitches. So interesting work. 60 tezos, Dave.
00:46:25.420 - 00:46:45.700, Speaker A: Also known as bees and bombs on Twitter. With a cool animated abstract here. Very smooth, kind of vector looking, so kind of breathing here. Interesting work. Spiegelsmaskinen. I almost wanted to drag that across like a GLB. This is an open edition for 20 tezos each.
00:46:45.700 - 00:47:05.932, Speaker A: Each. It's called prismatic. Playing with the cathode ray tube prison. So just make this a little bit bigger here from Spiegels, playing with the old retro tech, the light from the old retro tvs here. Cathode ray tube. Cathode ray tube prism. Cool work.
00:47:05.932 - 00:47:34.904, Speaker A: And continuing on, another kind of retro tv. This is what we remember, at least in the eighties when I was growing up. Interesting piece. I think I saw this also in Kristin Roose's collection. I'm not art Chicago. And JX Conno Crt flux phaser, smpte, color bars, processing. I thought my video just cut out there.
00:47:34.904 - 00:47:52.324, Speaker A: It was the work, so I can't show the whole thing. Very cool work. Edition of 25 for 38 tazos. So selling for a nice price there. Kyle Flemmer with a couple of cool works. Open Homer. So playing with the analog video glitch here.
00:47:52.324 - 00:48:20.668, Speaker A: And playing also with pop culture, with the new Oppenheimer movie, which I have not seen. I haven't seen any movies this summer, actually, because I was moving, but maybe now I can see one. Kelflemmer 50 tezos on secondary. Now selling out on primary at only a Tezos 50. So here is another one open, Homer. And just a very cool glitch of the Simpsons here. And continuing on, Sky Goodman with an auction.
00:48:20.668 - 00:48:49.950, Speaker A: Kind of a different take on the sneakers here, isn't it? So here we see again, it almost feels like a collaboration, but it's not. So a different take here, this interesting kind of print in the background, what looks like kind of a mirror. And then some sneakers here, all unified by color. AI artwork, silver Lowe's standing paperweight. So this is the paperweight and abstract digital artwork frame. Very interesting. One of one for 25 tezos at auction.
00:48:49.950 - 00:49:09.484, Speaker A: A beautiful work here. Almost photographic, but still painterly by Mikey de la Creme. Mikey Wilson, reserved for point one. Almost has those colors of those kind of 19th century, 18th century paintings. Beautifully painted. Fire. So a beautiful painting here.
00:49:09.484 - 00:49:29.044, Speaker A: Look at how painterly it is in there by Mikey Wilson. Does it say what character this is? We were seeing Gi Joe. So great white. So Jay Z is being quoted here. Interesting. AI and AI mid journey. So maybe that's a self portrait of sorts.
00:49:29.044 - 00:49:52.140, Speaker A: Beautiful work, great color. Sum with a work post room number four. So we have seen the other three. And here I think we actually get a few more clues. Beautifully done here. Really original. I've been examining the relationship between postmodernism and artificial intelligent art under the titles of creativity, algorithms, destructive constructive approaches, and who was the creative of art.
00:49:52.140 - 00:50:28.284, Speaker A: For a long time in this process, I thought that the room paintings I obtained through artificial intelligence are actually post works of the new generation art. For this reason, I decided to bring such a series together with you here with a title that should be in this period when we create the art of the future. Very interesting. So selling out. And now on secondary for 70 and selling out for only four tazos. So art is cheap right now on tezos, all to say. And a really cool work here, combining drawing and Gif here.
00:50:28.284 - 00:50:47.876, Speaker A: 40 drawings on a single sheet of paper, digitally colored. So interesting work here. And we'll look at the artist's name. I see anonymous here, but this was sent to me and so I should know the name here. So very cool work here. And nice kind of minimal color here. And just an interesting concept.
00:50:47.876 - 00:51:16.894, Speaker A: This looks like digital coloring over top. So really mixing media here to good effect and actually making it fairly natural looking here. And you gotta love that kind of gradient on the fingers of the light on the fingers. Let's see if we can actually bring up the name of the artist online walking. This is on Zora. And are we gonna be able to bring it up? It's unfortunate. I'll see if I can get the name for next show.
00:51:16.894 - 00:51:27.226, Speaker A: But this is on Zora online walking. Do the search. Only four mints. And this is hilarious. Look at walk. Do this court scene. Hugs.
00:51:27.226 - 00:51:59.812, Speaker A: And so just brilliant kind of capturing of the news. I hadn't seen any of this, but so that was even more interesting, seeing the news. But first, through an artist's eyes, through the transformation of an artist in the commentary of an artist. Hugs. Very interesting. And so the power of putting art on Twitter, isn't it? Because people generally go to Twitter for their live news if something is happening live. So what happens again, I've been bringing this up for, since the beginning of this show.
00:51:59.812 - 00:52:30.224, Speaker A: What happens when artists start to do art of the news and then almost in real time, where you are starting to see the art before maybe the news story. And I found that. I find that exciting and profound and raises a lot of very interesting, fascinating questions. Continuing on, demon ego was a really beautiful work here. Censored images of bloody wars. This is a one of one for 88 tezos, only $61. And here we see, this appears to be a physical NFT.
00:52:30.224 - 00:53:03.870, Speaker A: And we see the notebook here and a lot, almost like graph paper done manually. And then over top we have real kind of graph paper, but on a translucent background, beautiful colors going across the whole, you know, picture plane here. Over both pages we see this big horse, beautifully done. I mean, demon ego, another beautiful work here. Look at Dan Control, old still life. So Dan control can paint, in case you didn't know. Like, here's some beautiful, I mean, very beautiful work.
00:53:03.870 - 00:53:26.310, Speaker A: A beautiful oil painting seemingly from dan control. Amazing. And tater tots, sinamacosa sticker number 16 Saturday slaps weekly series. And this also looks like a physical NFT as we round out and wrap up the show. Nice kind of layering here. And that is available for 250. And there are 13 left from tater tots.
00:53:26.310 - 00:53:45.618, Speaker A: And just some kind of sculptural painting here from Yoao Salazar. Look at this building. Just kind of melt. So very cool there. And another one from Yoao, compressed compressed narratives, 13 plasticine and acrylic box. So there you see some people. So very interesting and cool work.
00:53:45.618 - 00:53:55.174, Speaker A: Taking an idea to an extreme here. Just awesome work here from Yoao, as usual. And that is your show, my friends, thank you for joining me. Until next time, take care.
