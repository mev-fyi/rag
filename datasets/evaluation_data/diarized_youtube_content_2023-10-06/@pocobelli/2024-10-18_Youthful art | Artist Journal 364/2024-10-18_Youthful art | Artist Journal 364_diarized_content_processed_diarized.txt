00:00:03.880 - 00:00:16.285, Speaker A: Right up to the microphone we go. Hello, and welcome back. As the journey powers forward, we're moving at a good clip. Half in the water, half in the sky. I know not what's happening. I am so glad to see you again. Welcome back.
00:00:16.285 - 00:00:36.293, Speaker A: Our triumphant music on our ship in the sky. Traveling through the clouds. Maybe it's the rain where we see the water. My name is Adrian Pocabelli. Artist Journal, October 18, 2024. Broadcasting from the inner half of the nervous. And here we are, a wonderful Japanese artist.
00:00:36.293 - 00:00:51.925, Speaker A: The third time in four shows. A rare physical starting the show. I just love this piece. And you've seen probably this artist before. I've shown it on the show many times. Work by this artist. I don't remember this piece.
00:00:51.925 - 00:01:10.215, Speaker A: I'm not sure if it's new or not. It may have been around. It was posted on October 16th. A real nice reception here too. 139 retweets, 40,000 views and probably counting. So very cool piece here. And again, O Shay is the artist out of Tokyo.
00:01:10.215 - 00:01:42.549, Speaker A: Very interesting. And you may remember the PlayStation, a lot of McDonald's. A very youthful subject matter is one of the things I want to mention here. This is, you know, again, it's got a popular feeling, right? But, you know, it's tempted. Is this neo pop? Is that what you would call it? It is using similar to what I was describing with Gozo last show. Remember I was saying if you watched it that Gozo, you couldn't. Would Gozo would.
00:01:42.549 - 00:02:31.999, Speaker A: Would it have been possible to make Gozo's image five years ago from just even a techno technological point of view? And I kind of think the same thing here, but from a different perspective, from a content point of view, you know, this is an inherently more youthful image, which I think is significant in the sense that as we look at the contemporary art scene and what I'm arguing, and it's to generalize, but a kind of tiredness that's going on. Again, now you're seeing some contemporary art influencers. Talk about the new Tom Wesselman show, right? The pop artist. And it's like, okay, like nothing new here. Okay, now we're gonna, you know, value Tom Wesselman. Well, I kind of already really like Tom Wesselman. And so I guess there's a big show in Paris, Art Basel.
00:02:31.999 - 00:02:46.925, Speaker A: Paris is there? I think it's in Paris. Maybe it's London. I can't remember. So within that context, it's very fun to have some youth. Youth. Something fresh. Right.
00:02:46.925 - 00:03:15.558, Speaker A: Again, what are these Great Japanese artists. Interestingly, just catching the eye. And what do we have? We have Super Mario World. Kind of looks like, if I had to guess from the 90s, it is a package. Right? And that is significant too. I kind of sometimes call it an unrecognized canon. You know, Lego Lego space Lego boxes from the 1980s, you know, trading cards up until about 1991.
00:03:15.558 - 00:03:49.265, Speaker A: 92, maybe 93. Gorgeous design. I don't know if they started using photoshop in the 90s, but all of a sudden I lost interest almost immediately. Interestingly, comics at around the same time kind of lost their mojo. I don't know if it was like the corporatization of comic books and you know, because Marvel especially went through a lot of corporate takeovers and it didn't work. Well, I would argue from my personal perspective here and I wonder if that's what also happened to Topps. I don't know.
00:03:49.265 - 00:04:30.899, Speaker A: I think Michael Eisner is running Topps now for the last few years, who ran Disney and recognized Topps as a major brand. Interestingly, and has actually incorporated a very interesting idea that I think we should consider. Actually, I've considered it. At least is tops now and, you know, maybe mental note, maybe on a future show when we have more time, when it's not haircut day like it is today and I actually need to leave. Yeah, it can't be a long show today. Wonderfully tops now, where you get an email or you go to their website and it's like, okay, this is available for 24 hours. And the edition, it's like an open edition.
00:04:30.899 - 00:04:45.867, Speaker A: And however many we get in 24 hours, however many orders we get, we send out. And that is the amount of the addition. The image was taken that day at a baseball game. Very cool. Right. And so. But there's a physical.
00:04:45.867 - 00:05:01.455, Speaker A: And I've actually. I wonder if it's here. You know, wildly enough. This has been on my shelf since I moved here over a year ago. This is what I speak. Yeah, look at this. So look at the packaging.
00:05:01.455 - 00:05:17.507, Speaker A: Right? Not to go on too much of a tangent here now. How can I not, you know, and there. Look at this. And what is it? This is like a art card. I forgot about this. Look at how cool this is. Let me see if I can.
00:05:17.507 - 00:05:37.421, Speaker A: I mean, you see why I bought it. Ricky Henderson. And unfortunately not signed Original card number 294. Project 2020. This is five years, four and a half years old. Gorgeous. How cool is that? You know, again.
00:05:37.421 - 00:05:53.785, Speaker A: And look at this casing and Everything. So the mind, it gets tempting to think about what's possible. Indeed. And you put, you know, make sure you have your great packaging as Wok does. Right. All sorts of possibilities here. So anyway.
00:05:53.785 - 00:06:16.555, Speaker A: But you see, it shows that there's a market for it if you're excited about it. That was the first trading card I probably bought that was excited to buy. Sometimes on vacation I'll buy trading cards if I'm just around it and it's at the confectionery or 7 11. Just out of fun. But usually I'm kind of disappointed. That was exciting. As you see.
00:06:16.555 - 00:07:23.991, Speaker A: So all to say, so the artist here, Ochiai, let me O Shohei. And this very interesting combination of what looks like graphite and paint or marker, you know, again, you look up here, see the side. Kind of looks like marker, doesn't it? Very nice work. And just from a illustration point of view, interesting distortion, like takes a familiar object, you know, that we all know, Mario Brothers, that we often have a emotional attachment to. For many of us, again, it makes it generational, so to speak, and distorts it, but consistently across, almost like there's a jaggedness to the image. And also part of this artist's repertoire, stylistic repertoire, is the perspective being off, you know, or just manually done, as you see here, not matching exactly with here and definitely not matching with the bottom here. This kind of distorted perspective, as you see down here, kind of a signature thing.
00:07:23.991 - 00:07:47.097, Speaker A: And of course Nintendo and the Japanese version of the game. So kind of there's something kind of generational about this. This isn't your, you know, mom and dad's pop art, so to speak. This is a different, you know, vibe, so to speak. Back to that vibe word. So, and, and look at the response. A lot of enthusiasm out there.
00:07:47.097 - 00:08:15.161, Speaker A: I find this, you know, these being able to see the views on X and even the likes on Instagram for some of these artists, I find very, very interesting from just a big picture view of the arts and society. Art and society. You know, here is their. Here's their X profile. As you see, all sorts of cool things going on here. There's trading cards, hilariously, color variations, variations. Tap this image.
00:08:15.161 - 00:08:38.365, Speaker A: So not sure what this is, but you see there's a little version of the Mario there. I think I brought this up right. So as you see. So maybe this is a whole bunch of other works. As you see, again, always this kind of distorted perspective. Love the filet o fish again, the McDonald's, even the 1968. But then 2006 Corona Big Mac.
00:08:38.365 - 00:09:29.807, Speaker A: So some of it inherently modern. I guess the fries could have been from a while ago. That one, Nintendo Game Boy, you know, contemporary digital pop, you know, which makes you think, like the idea of pop similar to surrealism, perhaps is just like there's neo surrealism, you could say there's neo pop. There's something kind of almost, I want to say, timeless about what they're doing. Of course, surrealism being much more psychological and kind of fantastic, shall we say, you know, whereas pop being very much the world that we live in and consumer product oriented, shall we say, there seems to be something timeless about it. I think this is the artist here. Remember last show there was the comment about how, you know, not all artists are tortured.
00:09:29.807 - 00:09:53.551, Speaker A: This guy, maybe he's tortured, but he doesn't look tortured at all. He looks like quite a happy guy. I'm pretty sure it is the guy on the right, so. And just a beautiful work there. And again, look at the subject matter here. Just probably painting things that he finds that he visually loves, right? Like this comics and this really interesting perspective here and the lines and everything. So turning that.
00:09:53.551 - 00:10:26.425, Speaker A: And you see up here, so paint being applied here with what looks like graphite. Interesting combination. Nice contrast between kind of multimedia here. And you see here the amount of work that goes in, like, you know, having the names of each color here, like not slacking there and just taking any old color. Interestingly, here's the Instagram and here again is that page. And yeah, so you just. And look at this again, back to the distorted perspective here.
00:10:26.425 - 00:10:43.645, Speaker A: Just very, very cool. And I think worked maybe with Adidas, if I'm not mistaken. Look at this again. Inherently modern, you know, youthful. There's energy here, right? It's fun. It's something that you could also bring. And look at 1600 likes.
00:10:43.645 - 00:11:13.409, Speaker A: I mean, that's a lot for Instagram. And this is something you could show at a high school today. And the kids are going to love it, right? And there's something to be said for that, right? Even like to an elementary school, right? Same here. So isn't youthful. Youthful art isn't that great. So thrilled to start there with Uchihai and forgive me, Ochihai Shohei. I need to work on my Japanese.
00:11:13.409 - 00:11:33.361, Speaker A: Someone told me Japanese isn't that hard. There's actually a friend that speaks Japanese who visited Berlin from Canada and he knew some Japanese. I guess he lived there. Anyways, let's continue. Louis jpd, thank you for the post here. An artist journal work kind of loosely based on rauschenberg Interesting take. I almost feel like.
00:11:33.361 - 00:12:03.483, Speaker A: No, I was going to say that this work is in Berlin. There's a different work in Berlin. A good vibe, self referential piece that celebrates the joy of appearing on Artist Journal in the framework of a digital homage to Neo Dataist Robert Rauschenberg. Interesting. That does ring a bell that it's interesting. Now, Neo Dataist and I don't want to go too long here because we know how these shows bubble out and there is a hard deadline here. But it is interesting because Rauschenberg liked chance.
00:12:03.483 - 00:12:30.529, Speaker A: Right. And the data seemed to like randomness. Then you had surrealism with automatism where they were just saying the first words that came out of their head and using that as a kind of record, so to speak. A kind of, as I call it, a transcription of the nervous system, so to speak. That's one kind of way of looking at it. So all to say so very interesting. So Woke up on YouTube is the work.
00:12:30.529 - 00:12:46.261, Speaker A: And let's see so and incorporating that and there is the work. And I think I brought this up. So awesome. So thank you, Louie. I think I actually have this on object here. Woke up on YouTube. Waking up is hard to do.
00:12:46.261 - 00:13:00.845, Speaker A: So thank you for that. And there you see almost this Rauschenberg esque YouTube logos switching around. Just awesome. Thank you, Louis. Hope you're having a wonderful weekend here. Last show. Thank you for the comments and likes here.
00:13:00.845 - 00:13:19.415, Speaker A: Just speed through it here. Retro Manny. I never understood why people would upload themselves playing games to YouTube. But. Yeah, so referring to me watching Ultima 4 on YouTube. But over the years I've realized what a treasure trove of classics it has become. Yeah, it's a whole kind of cottage industry, I think you'd call it.
00:13:19.415 - 00:13:48.867, Speaker A: Totally with you on not wanting to play games I grew up with, but rather revisit them just to enjoy them as a form of art. No different from cinema in some cases. Indeed. Again, it's back to this idea. It's the visual impact of these games over this, over the gameplay that I'd argue is the legacy of those games. Interestingly, like again, like, you know, Ultima 4 is pretty sophisticated at the time, kind of RPG. But from a.
00:13:48.867 - 00:14:20.309, Speaker A: Do I want to spend my time to, you know, figure out how to play that game again and try and win and spend 100 hours or maybe more. I never won that game and I played, probably spent 100 hours on it. But why do I go back to it now? Yeah, it's the visuals. It's spectacular. It's this moving like tableau that you kind of move through it and it's just a beautiful art of like this tile art. And a true innovator. I can't remember his actual name.
00:14:20.309 - 00:14:37.951, Speaker A: Richard Something. But who Lord British is so all to say. Yeah, and I don't think it's just Ultima 4 to your point here. Anyway, another great show, Adrian. Amazing pieces showcased from Nicholas Dietrich. Can't wait to see that one. Finish the surreal.
00:14:37.951 - 00:14:53.425, Speaker A: Almost like this De Chirico of pixel art. Also appreciate you showing mine and Limbo's work next to each other. My absolute pleasure. I think I might have a limbo at the back of the show there. Just of the big eye. Just really cool work. Posted by Limbo thank you for the comment.
00:14:53.425 - 00:15:15.845, Speaker A: Manny Skomra. Great show. I loved your discussion of Gozo's work. I've read Freud, but I haven't really studied the surrealists, especially the painters. The decontextualizing and juxtaposition in surrealist painting can be visually interesting, but have a hard time connecting to it on an emotional level. Very interesting. It's almost like they were trying to.
00:15:15.845 - 00:15:47.555, Speaker A: I'm not sure if that was the goal, but maybe partly. Let's go back to this in a second. Let's finish your comment and kind of dig a little deeper here. Surrealist films and surrealist poems are easier for me as the progression through time of surrealist work brings them to life for me. I really love Gozo's work, especially the stable diffusion pieces, as you might imagine. Of course, you guys could be in the same show, but I didn't really know how to incorporate the other style of work. I have a much better understanding of what Gozo is doing now in terms of the other works.
00:15:47.555 - 00:16:32.027, Speaker A: And again, this kind of Freudianism, right. This latent narrative, you know, to be blunt about it, as Ballard put it, you know, sex continues to be our main preoccupation. And that is kind of a Freudian, you know, way of looking at the world. And so, yeah, so back to the surrealist painting, I mean, and what it means and how should I read these paintings is kind of another way of putting it. And I just mentioned a couple of things, of course, J.G. ballard, the Great. You know, I would say explainer, interpreter, almost reinterpreting a little bit of surrealism, kind of capping off what I'd call classic and some others as well called classic surrealism.
00:16:32.027 - 00:17:24.705, Speaker A: And what makes it classic surrealism, I would argue it is the Freudianism and what is the Freudianism? Back to our earlier comment about our main preoccupation, right? So as he said in a late article, I think 2004, 5, 6, in the Guardian, when he'd write these great articles, you know, how he saw, you know, the surrealist paintings at their best were on par with discoveries that were made in, say, quantum mechanics. Like, that's how. Quite a provocative statement. How dare he. Right. But it's an interesting point. And to a certain degree there is a kind of, you know, remember de Chirico? We were just mentioning him and a proto surrealist and inspired Max Ernst, you know, walked by de Chirico painting, saw it, I think, in a storefront in Paris, I think, and was like.
00:17:24.705 - 00:17:50.575, Speaker A: Changed the course of his life. A metaphysical painter, Right. And so. So we put that in mind. And so what is being discovered here is another way of kind of framing this kind of difficult question as I do it in real time here with not a ton of time to spare. You know, let's. Let's take this angle more, Ballard.
00:17:50.575 - 00:18:58.675, Speaker A: The when, as he put it, you know, when the central nervous system, you get the impression of, say, as he put it, the angle between two walls. And the message, we might think on a conscious level, as he put it, might have a very different message than by the time it reaches kind of the central nervous system, unconscious, you know, the deep psyche, for lack of better term, the iceberg in the water, which is the, you know, as Freud put it, I think was Freud, you know, and consciousness is a little bit peeking out. And then the big part, that's the unconscious in a Freudian kind of model of the world. And so the question being, in a sense, and what Ballard and the surrealists and Freud are suggesting is that really A equals B. And you can ask, like, does. If you kind of buy into this idea, you know, that a cigar is not just a cigar with this main preoccupation that we have, even you could argue that's probably one of the ways you can read the Magritte. There's many ways to read the.
00:18:58.675 - 00:19:42.335, Speaker A: There are many ways to read that. But one of the ways you can read it is a cigar is not just a cigar, as they say, in kind of classic Freudian line, or at least line referring to Freud. So it's back to this idea finally, of the way, you know, as Dali said, you know, to give another angle on this in the Unspeakable Confessions of Salvador Dali. If you want to understand my paintings, as he said very directly in capital Letters decode, decode, decode. And I don't remember if we said it three times or five times. Okay, decode, decode, decode. So it's very.
00:19:42.335 - 00:20:23.067, Speaker A: You always got to kind of keep in mind this kind of Freudianism I would argue for. Or the psych, at least, psychological art, which is trying to get at a reality. And final point on this. And as we learn, you know, again, you know, so final point on this, just to tie the bow and then we gotta run. So Ballard, talking about Dali in the early essays, Eroticize and Quantify. That's how he described what Dali was doing. He's eroticizing again back to Freudianism and quantifying.
00:20:23.067 - 00:20:46.167, Speaker A: He's kind of turning this impulse, this preoccupation into physical form. And then it's kind of like. It's soft, it's hard, it's curvilinear, it's rectilinear. And then all of these kind of elements, this kind of. It's kind of like a new kind of metaphysic. You could. One could argue that is kind of based on, again, decoding.
00:20:46.167 - 00:21:19.315, Speaker A: And what is, you know, finally, what is Ballard doing? What does Ballard say? What does eroticize. What does he turn that into at the. In the introduction to Crash. Eroticize and Quantify. What does that turned into? Freud's classic distinction between the manifest and the latent contents of the inner world of the psyche need now be applied to the external world of so called reality. What does that mean? Treat the world, as he often put it in late interviews, as a solidified. He treats the world as a solidified dream.
00:21:19.315 - 00:21:49.875, Speaker A: And that. What you're, you know, the dream work in Freud, as I've mentioned here many times, you know, is what is the task of the analyst? You have your dream, you don't know what it means. It's a bunch of random things. That is the manifest or surface content of the dream. You bring it to the analysts. And the task of the analyst is to read the manifest content of your dream to understand what's actually going on, the underlying content of the dream, the reality. It's back to an appearance reality thing.
00:21:49.875 - 00:22:07.767, Speaker A: And Freud was very literary, as many of the surrealists were. They're very literary. You know, Breton was a writer. You know, you could argue it was more of a. The original impulse was a writing impulse. And then, you know, Breton starts adding. And by the way, there's some artists too, in the first Surrealist manifesto.
00:22:07.767 - 00:22:37.455, Speaker A: I don't even know if that's the edited version, version two of the first surrealist manifesto. So all to say is. So there is kind of a task of getting towards a kind of truth. Not necessarily the truth, but a kind of truth. And in that sense, you know, Ballard would call these discoveries. Right. So I don't know if that helps you with surrealist painting, but I hope it does.
00:22:37.455 - 00:23:07.331, Speaker A: Like there is kind of a mission, so to speak. It's not just random stuff. And, you know, Ernst was very, you know, I think clear and beyond painting, if memory serves, that, you know, you're looking. You're not just looking for any two objects, you're looking for a flash, I believe is the word he called of inspiration when you're putting two objects together in a new context. Right. As you beautifully put it here, decontextualizing and juxtaposition. So I hope that helps.
00:23:07.331 - 00:23:21.153, Speaker A: And if you have any questions, by all means. You know, ironically, finally on this point, the films. Yeah, I can't do it. It's like tedious. And the poems too. Magnetic Fields. And I think it's Nadia by Breton, the novel.
00:23:21.153 - 00:23:40.357, Speaker A: I. It's almost like automatism is kind of lost on me. Whereas, you know, but you know, kind of more of a clinical approach to it. I'm kind of. I can more enjoy a poetic approach to a very symbolic. And you know. Anyways, let's continue.
00:23:40.357 - 00:23:48.613, Speaker A: Thank you very much for the comment. I'm glad you liked that discussion. Summer Blues. Great to hear from you. Need to tell it again. I love your show. Awesome to hear from you, Andre.
00:23:48.613 - 00:24:20.265, Speaker A: I think we have a work by you, this show and here also on Twitter or X. Let's speed through here. Blue Ali. Your contributions via all your efforts, Pokebelly, are precious to me as an artist and member of the groups of artists and art lovers who spontaneously join to wonder at the beauty and incomprehensible dimensions that both art and life encompass. What a beautiful statement. Honored to finally join the discussion here on Artist Journal with my first community post. Merci Infinite.
00:24:20.265 - 00:24:38.261, Speaker A: Well, Grand Merci. Should I call you Bleu Ali? Great to hear from you and what a wonderful thing to say. Wonderful to have you. Darbels. This is really cool. Great to have you and glad to hear. And was also asking about Ethereum.
00:24:38.261 - 00:25:10.309, Speaker A: Do I talk about art journals on Ethereum? This is a multi chain show and so there are Ethereum works. It's not meant to be like a Tezos specific show. It just kind of ends up that way. For whatever reason of my feeds and me just. I'm just kind of, you know, again, this is a journal, not a news program. And so I'm just kind of taking whatever looks good. It's kind of like putting, as I mentioned in the past, my hand out in a waterfall and then kind of whatever's there and then just kind of making a DJ mix out of it.
00:25:10.309 - 00:25:26.357, Speaker A: Visual DJ here. That's basically what I'm doing. Talking and talking and talking you through my visual DJ mix. So definitely Ethereum. No problem with that. So, thank you for the comment. Amir Music, one of the dopest art journals on the Internet.
00:25:26.357 - 00:25:37.655, Speaker A: Thank you. Our Milk, another great release. Lots of strong works and artists. Cool. The more often I watch your show, the more I see my works. Yes, it works out that way. I even think I'm beginning to understand something about contemporary art.
00:25:37.655 - 00:25:51.575, Speaker A: Probably because I am Turbo Sulato, whatever that means. Thank you, Armilk. I think we have a work by you this show, but I'm not positive on that. Awesome to hear from you. And wonderful work, Andre. Summer Blues. Awesome to hear from you.
00:25:51.575 - 00:26:01.031, Speaker A: Thank you for the comment. Retro. Manny, you know it's time for a coffee break when artist drops. And one for you too. I appreciate that. I could almost use another. I'll get it at the hairdresser there.
00:26:01.031 - 00:26:20.075, Speaker A: They love to give coffee. Oxbenge. Awesome to hear from Oxbenge. Must admit I've missed a few of your shows now, Adrian, but so glad to see you're still powering through. Inspiring. Thank you. And I am working on, I think Monday I'm going to take another crack at making the show shorter for all our sakes here, especially mine.
00:26:20.075 - 00:26:29.125, Speaker A: And Jan. Luke, thank you for the comment and awesome to see you Bench. Jan. Lucas Magoni. Always got time for Artist Journal. Thank you, Gozo. We heard from Gozo.
00:26:29.125 - 00:26:51.945, Speaker A: Awesome. Thanks, Bogabelli, for opening the program with Backwards, which is this work right here. And the interesting thoughts. What attracts me most about working with stable diffusion is the materiality of the shapes and textures I get out of it. Indeed. It seems like the textures are the kind of big showstopper. You see it with Skomra, maybe with rj.
00:26:51.945 - 00:27:13.095, Speaker A: In these animated collages, part of the animation is created in the classic digital way, in part with stable diffusion. Interesting. The animation. Interesting. The idea was to create the materiality also in the movement, the image about to collapse. So very interesting. So materiality through movement.
00:27:13.095 - 00:27:24.419, Speaker A: Very interesting. Gozo, thank you for the comment. Just awesome to hear from you. And Rorich, always a joy. I love Beavis and Butthead. That was. I thought it was so funny when I was 16.

If you remember that from last show seven years ago, you might be right. I need to make some more. You should definitely make some more.
00:27:49.725 - 00:28:06.751, Speaker A: There's something very original and beautiful about it and it's good too for the digital. Like it's always good to go back and forth. Neural Frames. Thanks for the shout out Pokebelly. We love Lego X's work and so glad. Yeah, indeed. Awesome to hear from you.
00:28:06.751 - 00:28:17.079, Speaker A: Neural frames and Legro X. Absolutely. That was a cool work. Kind of animated abstract there. Looked like it was part of a bigger series obtainer. Thank you for the feature. Absolutely Sonic Azurba Waffle.
00:28:17.079 - 00:28:39.113, Speaker A: Your French is quite good, Monsieur Poco Belly. Well, it's rusty though. You can hear it. It's like a bit of a struggle pour par les francais. It wasn't like in grade 12, but maybe a few weeks practice, even a couple of days and waffles. We can be having a baguette in a cafe in Paris. Kurt Hustle Collective in Hopi.
00:28:39.113 - 00:28:54.351, Speaker A: Awesome to hear from you. What a wonderful, wonderful crowd. And here just quickly looking at the community. MISA number 40. We're going to take a look at this. This is Santiago de the Artist formerly known as Santiago now known as Times and the Myth. We'll see that later this show.
00:28:54.351 - 00:29:12.315, Speaker A: Louis JPD we saw this work at the start. Thank you for posting. Requiem de la Nuez. Thank you for posting. Kind of a wild kind of surrealist looking painting. Kind of looks like. Is it a Boston Dynamics dog? Is it an insect with a head of a woman and guns? Pretty wild painting there.
00:29:12.315 - 00:29:21.529, Speaker A: Thank you for posting. Print sketch. Thank you for posting. Kind of looks like a physical Artists on the chain. Interestingly so. Very cool. Chris War.
00:29:21.529 - 00:29:39.325, Speaker A: And here's a collaboration with Psycho Futurist and I assume there's some. As you can hear, Chris War knowing how to make techno. Progressive techno has put out records. Great talent there. So collaborating with Seiko Futurist. Super cool. Thank you for posting.
00:29:39.325 - 00:29:56.325, Speaker A: It's Arena, a new beat making room. More cool music. Love these kind of. This one almost looks pixelated. This beautiful kind of synthesizer setup here. What kind of synth is that? That looks like an old. I want to call it Oberheimer or something? Not sure.
00:29:56.325 - 00:30:15.827, Speaker A: Very cool. Rural Idol thank you for posting. So a last 36 hours the open edition.

Raman Syrif Blade of Sin so kind of a 3D rendering here.
00:30:15.827 - 00:30:41.777, Speaker A: Thank you for posting. And Luke500 thank you for posting this bitcoin work. This is the chair at my cousins and it was hilarious because actually Luke500 I can easily picture Patrizio who is the dog here in the other bitcoin work sitting on the chair and I send that to my cousin. I was like does Patrizio actually sit on that chair? Because because both are from her terrace or patio there. She's like patricio can't get up but the other dogs do. So hilarious. Thanks for the comment.
00:30:41.777 - 00:30:53.045, Speaker A: Luke Mind Eye thank you for posting. Kind of looks like a AI 3D work. Maybe CGI. AI indeed it is Fabricated enlightenment. Very cool. Lucas Ox we're going to see this. This show.
00:30:53.045 - 00:31:10.805, Speaker A: A very cool spaceship. We'll check it out later. Skull takes no one wins Art commissions go up for auction on object.com so thanks for including me among the artists. So cool. So Skull takes putting out kind of a wild work of the screen. We're going to see more of that shortly.
00:31:10.805 - 00:31:26.625, Speaker A: Very cool kind of mixing of mediums here, layering of mediums. Nifty trap. Some works here. Not sure if those are paintings or AI Cool looking work, very minimal. Psycho Futurist, another Zodiac. This is Virgo. Thank you for posting.
00:31:26.625 - 00:31:48.863, Speaker A: Pretty radio and we are through the community now. Let us go here. Let's bring us to the top here. So there's not too much I want to say here other than there's a lot more. There's continues to be very good vibes at the Art Basel Paris. It might be this roof. People love the location.
00:31:48.863 - 00:32:16.597, Speaker A: And I'll just read this first line here by Katya Kazakhina, the art detective. As a student of art history you feel part of a lineage. Noah Horowitz, Art Basel CEO said, Paris is a city that wrote the story of the avant garde and we are part of that narrative at Art Basel Paris. Reopening at the Grand Palais in 2024. It will be in history books. So good vibes coming out of Art Basel Paris. And here just another headline.
00:32:16.597 - 00:32:38.199, Speaker A: Greenhouse Effect Art. Basil Paris gets a warm welcome at the Grand Palais and you see just the wonderful space here that does have to help and I think I highlighted it here. Here's the. Just quickly. Here's Pace Gallery. Just to get a sense of the vibes, the visual vibes. Hauser and Wirth at Art Basel Paris.
00:32:38.199 - 00:32:57.557, Speaker A: Interesting shadow on the spider there. This is actually what I wanted to highlight on this. Here's another one, Art Basel Paris and just a little bit more. And then we'll come back up to what I saw here. Just a quick. This guy's rad Martin Wong kid. He's at Cave.
00:32:57.557 - 00:33:18.115, Speaker A: He had a big show. I think he's passed now. I think, I think San Francisco or New York, not exactly sure. Chinese artist, but American. Chinese American. Really great artist here. I was really glad that was a great show at Cave Institute here in Berlin last year.
00:33:18.115 - 00:33:57.987, Speaker A: Let me see if I can find. There was something I wanted to mention here which was that it's becoming more about the experiences. Do I have this here? Just very, very quickly. Herein lies at least one takeaway. There is a noted desire to draw clients to show up in person and stay awhile. It echoes what I heard at Sotheby headquarters on Monday where a group of fresh eyed executives stood amongst a whole bunch of art. Their expanded location has a flexible layout where they plan to host different events to respond quote to the needs of their clients.
00:33:57.987 - 00:34:34.621, Speaker A: In the 21st century. The auction house is seeking to create more on site experiences for buyers, said head of Sotheby's France Mario Trevella. There is for example a wine tasting seller. Again I would argue that this is like art as lifestyle rather than the deep poetry like and there's a lot of. And the criticism I would think also you see it. I just was reading an article about it where contemporary artists are criticizing, you know, kind of like the financial side of this. I'm not against the finance in principle.
00:34:34.621 - 00:35:11.025, Speaker A: I think it's the beating heart of the art market and always has been in a large, in large degree. If you're not getting paid to make your work, where's your incentive and why like the world doesn't really is saying it doesn't need it ultimately. So I'm all for the financial side but the fact that they want experiences and then there's a wine tasting seller, it says that the one way of reading it is saying that the art isn't enough. There's probably a lot of ways to read it. No, they're just trying to expand their business and etc. But I would argue that's one of the takeaways. So very quickly here.
00:35:11.025 - 00:35:47.345, Speaker A: So just stop oil and youth Demand are replied to the museums. We saw the letter yesterday. Right. And here they are and they want to meet. We don't have time to read the entire thing, but they talk about public interventions in gallery spaces and that the world is in a very dark place. We represent just up oil in youth demand and they want to meet next week in a public location at the National Gallery. If I was the National Gallery, I would be very worried because I'd say what kind of stunt are they going to try and pull? We have actions taker.
00:35:47.345 - 00:36:06.995, Speaker A: We are. We have action takers who have risked liberty to call an end to oil and gas. I would love to speak to Dr. Gabriel. Final. We'll leave the soup at home. So yeah, so kind of talking past each other and I think I have an interpretation of what's going on here in a sense.
00:36:06.995 - 00:36:36.235, Speaker A: So the museum directors come in and say, hey, this is about bringing solace. And I think light are the two words that they used. This is about bringing solace and light to people's lives. And so damaging or attacking these works is not helping your cause. We're kind of. Maybe we're even on the same page is what they're saying. And so what I see happening here is two different kinds of politics.
00:36:36.235 - 00:36:56.943, Speaker A: I would argue just stop oil and youth demand. This is kind of what I would call. Be tempted to call kind of a. More of a left right kind of politics. Whereas in the. I would argue in the arts and I would. I've never actually seen it discussed, but sometimes I've commented on it.
00:36:56.943 - 00:37:21.689, Speaker A: In a sense, I say I avoid politics here. It's not the purview of this program. But when you go kind of go on a meta level, I'd argue, say what the surrealists were doing, even Freud philosophy in itself. Look at Socrates, just to name a few famous examples. Say, Jesus Christ, I. That's not left right politics. Right.
00:37:21.689 - 00:37:30.841, Speaker A: Like that you start to get. At least I would say in the arts. It's a different kind of politics. And it's a. I would argue it's a much. It's a meta politics. It's a different discussion.
00:37:30.841 - 00:38:09.169, Speaker A: So what I see happening here, and I'm not sure if even the museum directors would agree with me or anything, but you know, again, I'm watching all this historical videos on conquest and it's just the endless conquest after conquest after conquest. And you don't know any of these like 99% of these names you've never heard of and are not even remembered. Right. But what do we remember? From a culture, it is back to the arts. I mean, it's. There's not much. It's the texts, it's the arts and the architecture you can put in under the arts.
00:38:09.169 - 00:38:51.717, Speaker A: And even writing, it's like the arts, right? It's the images, it's the writing. And what is writing? It's almost making images with text to a certain degree, or at least telling a history. Right? So this is. And I think that is the mindset, I suspect, of the directors. Like, it's a. So that in effect becomes political because all of a sudden, you know, you could argue Andy Warhol had way more effect on the culture than. And all this fame and the celebration of celebrity in a certain way, which might have happened in an alternate universe anyway, but that.
00:38:51.717 - 00:39:17.215, Speaker A: That is more impact than whether it was JFK or Richard Nixon. And that's maybe a debatable point, but I'd just argue there's a different. There are different strata of politics here. Now, I need to speed up here. Final point on this, though, is bringing it back to Socrates and force versus persuasion. This and all these conquests. It's.
00:39:17.215 - 00:39:54.515, Speaker A: There's, you know, why are there wars? It's when persuasion breaks down, right? And then you revert to force. And when I see these, you know, hammers being applied here, that looks like. I don't know what you see there, but I see what looks like hammer blows to the glass of this Velasquez. And so when you start to see or even whether it is soup, it starts to get. When you go into the physical, it starts to become. You start to get out of the civilized, I would argue, and you start to get more into violence. It's kind of the road to violence.
00:39:54.515 - 00:40:20.203, Speaker A: It's like one step towards it, it crosses a line. It's no longer about persuasion anymore. Once you go physical, you're changing. And you could argue, well, I'm trying to be both and whatever, fine. But you are starting to change the conversation in fundamental ways that you may not even be. I would argue that maybe is not even being aware of that. It's starting to get into an uncivilized discussion.
00:40:20.203 - 00:40:41.341, Speaker A: And it's not about persuasion anymore. It's about force. So just my two cents on that. So why? And why? I don't think it helps the cause, as the museum directors, I'd argue, point out. So all to say, here's the final lines here. There's a rich history of protests in public gallery spaces. We are proud to be part of that heritage.
00:40:41.341 - 00:41:04.103, Speaker A: And again, I mean, I'd like to hear the examples. Are they thinking the Guerrilla Girls? Because the Guerrilla Girls use persuasion. As far as I understand, they weren't, you know, like, they did it through artworks. Right. That's persuasion. You know, who wanted to use force were the futurists. They glorified violence.
00:41:04.103 - 00:41:22.599, Speaker A: They wanted to burn the Mona Lisa. Right. We should bring that up. Marinetti. Right. And look at what political movement are the futurists affiliated with? You know, so just again, not all protest is the same, is what I put. We're proud to be part of that heritage.
00:41:22.599 - 00:41:42.283, Speaker A: From the suffragettes who slashed pictures in the National Gallery to anti Sackler protest. I guess. Here are your examples. To anti Sackler protests at the Guggenheim in New York. And I think, you know, on a. And maybe you've thought this too. I wonder if there's a little bit of art world sort of like, maybe there's a desire to be a part.
00:41:42.283 - 00:41:58.899, Speaker A: Like they see themselves as performance artists, I imagine. I suspect. Let's continue. We'll use your immense power to safeguard your collections and the public who will enjoy them. So turning the question, are you going to protect your work? Let's work together. We look forward to hearing from you. Courage calls.
00:41:58.899 - 00:42:22.715, Speaker A: So interesting. The funny guys. So this is pretty funny, actually. 68 tezos used to equal $458. No, it's probably worth 50. So the vicissitudes, to quote Freud of the crypto market, coins, objects, historical Tezos prices, is triggering an entire community's psd. It's very useful though, isn't it? You know, so very interesting.
00:42:22.715 - 00:42:39.375, Speaker A: Greg Nikshumika what to do when you're overbid. I guess you make your own. To minter or not to mint. That is the question. Uncertain gaze I would probably do this privately because it's harder to say no in public. It's beautiful, though. Like, it's a great remix that Craig did.
00:42:39.375 - 00:42:56.615, Speaker A: So gozo agreeing to it. But I would do this. I. I think. And I think all intentions are good here. But I would do this privately because it's like, you know, if you say it publicly, then it's just like, well, if I say no, will that be interpreted badly? You know, but it's. At least it was asked.
00:42:56.615 - 00:43:07.115, Speaker A: Beautiful remix here. I love how this part is the part of the frame. Hilarious. So. Yeah. But it does bring up an interesting point and. Yeah.
00:43:07.115 - 00:43:36.515, Speaker A: Which I want to come back to in a future show. We got to keep running here, Machine. I don't care if the public posts my art without mentioning me. Everyone knows who made it. So that is machines getting pretty darn popular out there. And so I think this is an interesting kind of lesson in what is happening. What happens is, so all of a sudden, you know, public posting my art without mentioning me.
00:43:36.515 - 00:43:58.885, Speaker A: So. And the sad thing is, probably most people know who made it, but not everybody, but, you know, interesting. So interesting thing from a machine to have to deal with. Carborn artworks on Silk circa 2014. These are great. And as you see here, you'll see some pixelation on silk. Mankind deleted.
00:43:58.885 - 00:44:17.643, Speaker A: You know, again, every medium transforms differently. As you see here, silk's pretty fine, so you can get a pretty good pixelation. As you see a pretty fine rendition. Very cool there. Here's Acid Boy. Fancy a quick studio tour? Let's make it super quick here. So there's.
00:44:17.643 - 00:44:30.059, Speaker A: Look at that. And I love it. Like a real studio. Congrats to Acid Boy. And of course, makes paintings as Acid Boy has shown. And there look, a nice digital frame. Rad.
00:44:30.059 - 00:44:49.375, Speaker A: There's Acid Boy. And here in the studio, like, very impressive. Acid Boy, the master of psychedelic abstraction, as I love to call him here. Nice light, too. Fabulous. No Hygiene with physicals. Look at this.
00:44:49.375 - 00:45:05.255, Speaker A: One and a half by three meters, liquid latex sculpture. So who knew? No, Hygiene is making is making physicals. It makes paintings. Look at that. Look at the texture. So pretty cool. We have some works by no Hygiene this episode.
00:45:05.255 - 00:45:29.879, Speaker A: And here, look at this. Artist Suzanne Trister. Fictional video game stills. Are you dreaming? 1991 to 1992. So isn't this interesting? Because I was like, oh, does this dismantle my whole. Whole second generation of digital art? Hypothesis theory, you know, we have this 1991. It's video games.
00:45:29.879 - 00:46:09.115, Speaker A: I was like, actually, it kind of fits quite well. Because I'm arguing something changed when you started getting the GUI graphic user interface on the Mac, I think it was where all of a sudden you could paint with a computer. And this. So I'd say, okay, this may be from 1991 or 1992, but that still fits within, because when was the first ui? This is done using, I believe, maybe a Amiga computer. So it was drawn and then it was photographed, as far as I understand. I brought up some of these works. At first I thought they were textiles.
00:46:09.115 - 00:46:26.325, Speaker A: These are not textiles. These are, as you see, there's a little bit of a curve here. These are photographs of the screen. And credit to Suzanne Treister for getting such great photographs. Still alive 66. Interesting. So just really interesting art here.
00:46:26.325 - 00:46:49.602, Speaker A: And here's the website. There's A ton. I brought up a few. This is artsy. There's a fictional video in fictional video games. We've seen artists on Tezos do a similar idea with, I think, without being aware of Suzanne Trister. I could be wrong, but I've thought of this, you know, and I didn't know that this person existed back in 1991.
00:46:49.602 - 00:47:24.547, Speaker A: 1992. So I find this to be a really interesting, in a sense, bridge. And this is part of the Tate show, is what it says here. And the fact that this is being celebrated here, this gorgeous work of art in the new Tate Digital art show, that tells me that things are starting to bridge here. And that the thesis that some of this art could be like. It's hard not to see a lot of the art that we see. You know, you can start to relate it to what's going on here, is what I'm saying.
00:47:24.547 - 00:47:43.101, Speaker A: It kind of starts to bridge the gap a little bit. So very, very cool work here. Susan Trister, I think British. And here. So again, photographs of the screen. Right. How brilliant of her to photograph the screen.
00:47:43.101 - 00:47:55.477, Speaker A: Archival Giclee print on epson photo gloss paper. 16. Quite large. Interestingly so. And just gorgeous. Look at that quiz, quiz, quiz. Stunning.
00:47:55.477 - 00:48:16.271, Speaker A: Look at how gorgeous that is. Could have started the show with that. Beautiful. Here's more. Yeah, and so an aesthetically, very second generation. It's aesthetic. It's like, again, it's celebrating the visual aesthetics of video game culture.
00:48:16.271 - 00:48:34.437, Speaker A: One could argue here, and doing it in a really beautiful way. Identify the murder weapon. I mean, it looks like a sabato, doesn't it? I mean, so 1991, 1992. Brilliant. Have you been sentenced to a fate worse than death? This is an interesting one with 3D. Beautiful, beautiful work. Here's another one.
00:48:34.437 - 00:48:52.633, Speaker A: I mean, I just love these. Look at the pixelation in here too. Like how it doesn't even overlap perfectly. I mean, really great work. Susan Trister. So here's Harold Cohen. A computer generated drawing in ink on paper, hand embellished with color pencil.
00:48:52.633 - 00:49:22.555, Speaker A: So we saw this the other day that someone was using, like painted themselves or colored themselves. Here's another example of that. And so isn't that interesting? 1974, as we start running through the works here, how much time do we have? Not a ton. Okay, so here's Spiegel's Meskin. So computer heads, it's on two chains. Interestingly, here is the Ethereum chain. And I brought up a few of the works.
00:49:22.555 - 00:49:38.037, Speaker A: Here's just one, just for let that load up. So current bid 0.04, so around 0.03. 0.04. So all on auction here. And here is one of the works. Pretty fabulous.
00:49:38.037 - 00:50:06.951, Speaker A: We saw a preview before in the skull turning nice and huge pixels. Love the computer by the way. The rendition of the computer. The whole thing just rad. And so here are the ones and we got a few on Tazos and two have one has sold only one and so. And so you see interesting different markets like the collectors want the Ethereum perhaps over the Tezos. Not sure.
00:50:06.951 - 00:50:34.453, Speaker A: But it's one of the interesting things you find in doing a multi chain series like that. Super cool cedar plank Wise Blood. So a new work I believe on Object from Cedar Plank. So more textures here, more kind of web browser type programs. You see all sorts of different, you know, there's a sampled brush, here's a spray brush. All sorts of different textures and everything. Maybe a skeleton.
00:50:34.453 - 00:50:55.621, Speaker A: And look at the bottom there. Perhaps pasted on, I don't know, some physical. Having too much fun here with a big American flag celebrating America. Wise Blood. Not exactly sure. And there's like a, an award and some more cedar planks. So that other one is on Object and I don't know if it's edition of three, so we'll see what happens there.
00:50:55.621 - 00:51:29.587, Speaker A: Some offers coming in here is Hasdrubal Waffle on Rodeo. A few works just quickly go through. So another just rad kind of work here. Vampire State Building. And again, it's funny how using all these different browsers you can totally identify the style even though it's not always the same software. Isn't that interesting? Huge works here. Playing again, celebrating like we see with Uri J celebrating these kind of artifacts, so to speak, these errors.
00:51:29.587 - 00:51:51.301, Speaker A: So to traditionally would think, oh, I can't use this as digital art because these are the errors. Now they're celebrated interestingly. And someone crying with the mouth moving. Here's the myth with some super interesting works. I thought I saw that these were on chain, which is interesting. These masks are available on Zora using Super app tool, using Surreal App tool. So a whole bunch of masks by the myth.
00:51:51.301 - 00:52:06.065, Speaker A: And some were quite poetic. Love that black one. And we have the red one. And so nine masks by the myth. And here's one large. And of course I follow the great myth out of Buenos Aires. Had the pleasure of meeting the myth in August.
00:52:06.065 - 00:52:26.879, Speaker A: And here is new profile picture. Yeah, this one's rad. They're all rad. Beautiful work. Also at Argentina Neve 1914 Colombiana after Botero and beautiful work here. Kind of more minimalistic. Love the spheres here as we saw with the bikini work too the other day.
00:52:26.879 - 00:52:43.385, Speaker A: And these beautifully colored sheets here. Really nice piece. Fernando botero edition of 13 and I think still available. Maybe there's one left if you're lucky. There's two left if you run. Yuri J. With a.
00:52:43.385 - 00:53:05.339, Speaker A: Just posting a work on Twitter on X. So again you're seeing all of these interesting artifacts being celebrated here. Very interesting. And you see a bike and so I think probably a closeup, but not positive on a work here. And did you see the tire? Oops. As you see me there. Do you see the tire here? Look at that.
00:53:05.339 - 00:53:23.023, Speaker A: Super cool. Continuing on. Pleasure and Pain. I gotta check actually I can't be late for my haircut here. Let me just very quickly check. I think it's at 2:45 calendar. Yes, it's at 2:45.
00:53:23.023 - 00:53:41.875, Speaker A: So yes, I have a few minutes. Pleasure and pain. So here is Michi Asu picked up by absurd Deity. Wild, wild, wild work here. Five second loop. Here's another one. Gain and Loss.
00:53:41.875 - 00:54:08.467, Speaker A: Interesting audio, totally original artist here. Nice beat. Put out a ton of work. And also observe deity picking up this work here. How much does that go for? Transferred. So maybe Private Metamorphosis. This is Gloom Tube.
00:54:08.467 - 00:54:33.037, Speaker A: This is kind of funny. So showing a wheat field that has been tilled I guess and then modern foods like candy. Maybe this is like some sort of butterscotch tablet or something, I don't know. And like super artificial candy worm here. Interesting contrast there by Gloom Tube. It's called metamorphosis. Selling for 123 tezos.
00:54:33.037 - 00:54:53.645, Speaker A: Nice sale. Another one Debris. So again, classic Gloom Tube. Who did the garbage bags the other day? And here is kind of litter, looks like a straw. And then even the rain here. Almost looking like a sad face there and everything. Interesting reflection where you see the reflection on one side and underneath the water on the other.
00:54:53.645 - 00:55:19.545, Speaker A: Debris edition of 15 and almost selling out there. Nice work. Here's PP Universal Chevrolet Onyx. Interesting title. So as you see here, interesting take on the patterning in the outlines. Here you can see why uri J&PP work together. Kind of similar kind of concept as far as the outlines and the textures.
00:55:19.545 - 00:55:30.995, Speaker A: Interesting piece here. Gradient in the background and okay, and that is an addition of five and selling out. Nice work. Yuri J. Picking one up. Awesome. Or two.
00:55:30.995 - 00:55:46.777, Speaker A: Great. Hilarious. Rennick Steer. Beautiful. So continuing to complexify the gradients here in gorgeous colors. Nice work from Ranix Deer. And I think that's On I want to be able to see the chart.
00:55:46.777 - 00:56:02.649, Speaker A: If anybody knows where the charts are. I'm kind of curious to see what happens here. So it's still minting. I assume this is where things can be turned into, like meme coins, art coins, as they're calling them. Ending mattress. The Fire Within. So taking, I think a fairly famous.
00:56:02.649 - 00:56:24.091, Speaker A: I don't know if this is Japanese wood cut, but a fairly famous illustration at least. At least seemingly so. And again, doing a different. It seems like every work, there's kind of a slight variation here. You have different colors of letter. So interesting innovation there. And this was super cool too, I guess.
00:56:24.091 - 00:56:41.051, Speaker A: It's like a bird and lots of negative space here. Love this piece here too, from Edding Mattress. Beautiful. Here's Francois Gamma. We'll see if we can make that bigger. Nope. And so more kind of text, using text as art and ascii.
00:56:41.051 - 00:57:00.243, Speaker A: A beautiful piece here from Huawes Gamma. Here's element li, motel, 300 by 300 pixels. And again, playing with the inverse and just two colors. So very cool there. Interesting. Almost looking so Motel. Kind of looks like architectural structure.
00:57:00.243 - 00:57:24.905, Speaker A: Maybe a palm tree there. Very minimal. Dan Kelly, who of course I follow new short film next week, part of Hellevision's Debt Quest. So this looks interesting again, looks like almost like a filming of a screen as we were seeing with the earlier artist on the Amiga there, I think Susan Terrier, if I remember the name right. Very cool there. Here is Sui Soichi. Romance is Dead by Sui Soichi.
00:57:24.905 - 00:57:47.837, Speaker A: Interesting again, layered effects here, I suspect. Great kind of noise here and all these great colors, these artifacts that you get even in the eyes. Cool kind of pixel painting. I almost want to call it a pixel painting. Great work there. That is on Manifest xyz, or sorry, Sealed Art is where that is. Continuing on.
00:57:47.837 - 00:58:10.505, Speaker A: Here's cider with some great textures here, almost figurative. You seem to see a person here, but almost abstract in these wonderful negative space in the margin. Beautiful work there. Here is Tornado Rodriguez. One More Dance. So when new, I don't think we saw this finished. I think we saw the work in progress because there was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle.
00:58:10.505 - 00:58:44.507, Speaker A: And so just a really nice record store piece. And there's the old compact disc logo edition of 11 for 10 Tezos and 5 gone so far. Beautiful work there. Here's Jake Studios picked up by Gloom Tube missing. And so interesting piece here. It looks like a static work, a rare static work by Jake Studios. And it looks like the Jake Studios character and guy with a paper bag lifting up the poster.
00:58:44.507 - 00:59:04.327, Speaker A: Interesting. The upside down clouds. The target and back to almost that helicopter we saw before, but that was just fire. Lewis Osborne Grinchycle this is brilliant. I don't know if it's new, but this was quite brilliant. By Lewis Osborne, British illustrator. Quite brilliant.
00:59:04.327 - 00:59:34.865, Speaker A: The happy and sad faces in the washing or the dryer. Brilliant. Summer Blues the Devourer So a new work by Andre Summer Blues. And this is on Object edition of 10 and 2 gone so far. There's Rosaccio picking one up and very cool. I'd call that a psychedelic illustration with some great texture in here, as you see. Kind of using printing techniques here or printing tropes, I want to say, in the color.
00:59:34.865 - 01:00:03.947, Speaker A: So that rasterization, I believe you'd call that kind of like a devil figure. Seemingly cool work there. Here's Pamela Cironi's Scalabrata. So out of Argentina. And there you see just another cool textured illustration by Pamela Cirone. Very cool. The all the excitement that you see in Pamela Cirone's work here is Nejo Nejo out.
01:00:03.947 - 01:00:21.595, Speaker A: And this is great. Out of Argentina as well. Met Nejo in Buenos Aires at our recording there. So cool illustration and surfing or rollerblading on the records there. And cool work. Edition of 31 for two tezos. One sold so far to Lucas Oxford.
01:00:21.595 - 01:00:33.077, Speaker A: Super cool illustration. Matto Jennings. And I wish I had the illustration right here. I almost do, but I don't have time. But I'll show. I showed it before. But we'll see more from Naho.
01:00:33.077 - 01:00:55.543, Speaker A: Matto Jennings. Cool illustration here too. Just kind of stylized cowboy and interesting portrayal of the gun. Here is mythsun number 40. And here is the myth in Santiago. The artist formerly known as Santiago, now called Times. And so a very unusual myth, son.
01:00:55.543 - 01:01:13.195, Speaker A: Kind of reminiscent of human kernel series there. And I love the clouds. I wonder if the myth, maybe the myth put in the clouds there. And great textures in the background, by the way. Kind of a subtle piece actually. The textures in the face are quite interesting too, as well as in the jacket. Very interesting.
01:01:13.195 - 01:01:35.665, Speaker A: Super interesting. Worth a close inspection here. Edition of one and now at 100 Tezos. So doing well. Continuing on Mech Txt who of course I follow one of each temper. Some beautiful works here of nature. Different seasons, I guess the flower and maybe some rain here.
01:01:35.665 - 01:01:47.809, Speaker A: And it looks like fall and winter. It's maybe spring, summer and fall and winter. Gorgeous. Here's another one. A good day. A day full of good labor on the road back home. This was quite beautiful too.
01:01:47.809 - 01:02:14.253, Speaker A: Love the framing Actually in here. And cool. Kind of minimal, not so minimal, but kind of minimal landscape. Pixelated. Gorgeous work here by Muji. A different Game Boy that is broken and so very nice Game Boy that's broken. Great dithering and love the concept and even the USB or maybe for the electrical electricity.
01:02:14.253 - 01:02:28.717, Speaker A: The cord. Electrical cord highlighted there and the joystick. So interesting piece. I believe Deluxe paint here is Tombum battle. Finally crazy atomic welder. So seen some new Tomb Battle which I'm thrilled to see. This is an object.
01:02:28.717 - 01:02:41.961, Speaker A: Great pixel artist. Kind of sci fi retro pixel art. And this is an edition of 20. And there it is. 18 tezos each four gone so far. And continuing on our milk. Good night.
01:02:41.961 - 01:02:55.025, Speaker A: Don't cut down the Christmas tree. Give cacti. So we do have a wild background here. And then work by our milk here of a cactus. Very interesting. Look at that background. Super interesting artist.
01:02:55.025 - 01:03:17.205, Speaker A: Here's Chaz Arcadia. So playing with a kind looks like Pong or actually not Pong. This is a different game that I recognize from the 80s. Maybe Arkan is the game. Huge pixels here. Huge dithering which is kind of interesting in itself actually. Edition of 15 for 250 each and they're almost all gone.
01:03:17.205 - 01:03:36.111, Speaker A: It's nice work there. Rosatio with a couple. Actually a few. I got a couple here. This is broccoli on eight Bedoux edition of one selling for 45 tezos. Nice work. And here is Spike which is an addition of 99 and already 7 gone or 6 gone.
01:03:36.111 - 01:03:49.687, Speaker A: So cool word work there. Almost looks like the COVID protein, but not sure. Here's plants going back to the Plantski series. So a new plant I believe. And you see the frame. It is a new plant. Gorgeous frame here.
01:03:49.687 - 01:04:08.665, Speaker A: I wonder if that's manual. I bet it is. Addition of 16 for 8 tazos and they are moving. So nice work there. From plants, also known as Kappen. Here is Pixel fool and Nicholas Sassoon. Posted by Alexandra Art Magdorm so cool pixelation here.
01:04:08.665 - 01:04:29.167, Speaker A: Cool combo. You get the big pixels and the small pixels that are uncolored in the background. Nice piece. Animated abstract. Here's Nicholas Sassoon on his own peak. So here, beautiful kind of cycling landscape here. Cycling colors moving through this gorgeous work there.
01:04:29.167 - 01:05:12.817, Speaker A: And here's the detail. Wow. So the stuff you don't capture when things get compressed on X. Lucas Ox here is a cool work here. Gaming topic inspired me to create an interplanetary space cowboy based on retro shooters like iRobot. So this is on Tezos, 1 of 1 Edition 50 sorry 1 of 150 Tezos Reserve. So cool work here and great color and kind of looks like a little bit analog video glitchesque Mika Aladev artifact and indeed there are artifacts here as this figure runs through a kind of interesting rocky landscape.
01:05:12.817 - 01:05:35.465, Speaker A: Edition of 9 for 15 Tezos and almost all gone. Having fun picking up two Yuri J there too. Here is and Mason III. October 22nd, 6pm the first from Phantasmagoria. So always interesting. Mason III has some wonderful pieces. One of my favorite one of ones I picked up from Mason iii.
01:05:35.465 - 01:06:16.529, Speaker A: Great artist and here doing another one of these interesting kind of sci fi landscapes Phantasmagoria. And where will that be? Not sure. Maybe has been point out works on Zora. So maybe it's Zora. Here's Limbo doing a very interesting mixing of drawing and then you have almost pixelation but then or almost even like the 4 dot or 4 color CMYK color thing but just in black. But then video seems to be using and just a blinking image and you almost see like 01 like Kurt Hustle collective style. And this is for Limbo's Telegram channel.
01:06:16.529 - 01:06:46.025, Speaker A: So you got a special subscriber badge. So Limbo's TV network. Hilarious. Pretty cool. Here is Ask Pinball guy with some ASCII with retro Manny. So Mission nine and so interesting combo here and again playing with the old portable game console and playing a video game here. Interesting loop ASCII CC&P.
01:06:46.025 - 01:07:23.359, Speaker A: Interesting Geno Bitter Interesting animated abstract here as you see. Interesting I think pretty short loop edition of one and that is 25 Tezos listed at 25 Tezos. Here's Cal Flemmer never settle edition of 10 and this is Har 92 by Har 92 but then turned into a thousand. I love the texture. Maybe it's in the making things larger that you get these great textures. Wonderful glitch here of someone running composed and animated in aspirite. So maybe created in aspirite.
01:07:23.359 - 01:07:41.245, Speaker A: This isn't a sample. Interestingly rescan from a Zenith CRT color corrected and reanimated in Photoshop. Quite the process there. Very rich ex mortal with a gorgeous landscape. Perfect day under a detuned sky. Great title too. I think this sold out pretty fast if I'm not mistaken.
01:07:41.245 - 01:08:11.657, Speaker A: Wonderful, wonderful sky here edition of 13 for 16 tazos each. And here's Jada with analog video glitch in the morning the air was very thick. Another landscape work. These could hang in the same room I think in another super richly textured work. I love those vertical lines there. Here's Bosque Gracias with a new film negative here. And interestingly, I think of a lake.
01:08:11.657 - 01:08:26.534, Speaker A: This lake was created on a slide that had a lake on it, but didn't look like one I could swim in. And then. Interesting. It looks like the physical slide has been kind of corroded somehow. Perhaps addition of one. Or it's layering. Not sure.
01:08:26.534 - 01:08:40.082, Speaker A: 36 tezos at auction. And that has been bid on now. 36 tezos. You can still get it. First syndrome. Not. This was posted in an open call, so I assume this is a work by First Syndrome.
01:08:40.082 - 01:09:00.945, Speaker A: Loved the concept here of like office cubicles done with what looks like AI Maybe stable diffusion textures, if I had to guess. Here's Scomra. Speaking of stable diffusion. Textual inversion, if I remember that correctly. And here it looks like an artist. Great textures again here. And a pixelation and textures.
01:09:00.945 - 01:09:14.097, Speaker A: Here's another super. Almost jpegization. A little bit fuzzed out a little bit. Very interesting. Almost looks like a user interface here. Super interesting. And here is Toucan Purple Haze.
01:09:14.097 - 01:09:31.294, Speaker A: All in my brain again. I think this is AI So pretty interesting. Fuzzed out. Experimental AI Here is Touques edition of one. This is on super rare. And so another interesting piece of flower. AI Flower, I assume by Tukes.
01:09:31.294 - 01:09:51.401, Speaker A: Here is Full Metal Droid. I wasn't sure if this is no Hygiene or not. Kind of has that vibe, but could be a different artist. I'm not sure if it's an alias or an artist doing kind of. Kind of in the same kind of category. We might say doing very experimental. And these kind of weird figures, let's call them maybe a similar process.
01:09:51.401 - 01:10:13.757, Speaker A: Droid automation 5G. And here is no hygiene with Totally Wild Cuckoo 13. And indeed this looks totally cuckoo. Meet people just again, just for wildness. No Hygiene. Winning the weird prize Boto project. So this is a community that is making AI here so interesting.
01:10:13.757 - 01:10:25.585, Speaker A: This was the result. I thought this one was kind of interesting. In case history spilled secrets. Usually these go for tens of thousands of dollars. Yo Ao Salazar. Internal landscape. First contact available on foundation.
01:10:25.585 - 01:10:49.887, Speaker A: So creating a GIF animation out of Plasticine and just going to scroll through a little quicker here. So beautiful work there by yo ao. And also into the physicals we go. Bobby Chi Matiha. Different kind of piece, isn't it? With the horse on top. Very whimsical. 2024.
01:10:49.887 - 01:11:04.445, Speaker A: So new work there. Here's my friend Charlie Stein. Themospheria. So I think this one's a little bit more up close. If I'm not mistaken, this one looks a little different. Interesting subject. An interesting combination of iconography.
01:11:04.445 - 01:11:15.153, Speaker A: This was interesting. Too. Lazy Bones by color. Charlie. Looks like using airbrush and maybe just a flat background. Not sure if that. I think it's physical, but not positive.
01:11:15.153 - 01:11:29.561, Speaker A: I assume that's physical. Here's Moto Hero 583 or Moto 583. Cars that are people. Just a wild artist, as we saw the other day. And that is your show, my friends. I hope you enjoy your weekend. I hope you enjoyed the show.
01:11:29.561 - 01:11:35.325, Speaker A: Had to run through it there. Until next time. Hope you have a wonderful, creative weekend and take care.
