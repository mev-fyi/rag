00:00:03.920 - 00:00:26.593, Speaker A: Let me hit play. Welcome back, everyone. A happy Halloween. I love these guys. Kurt Hustle Collective. You must love them. Artist shirt on November 1, 2024, broadcasting from the inner half of the nervous system, where it is feeling kind of Halloween ish.
00:00:26.593 - 00:00:39.565, Speaker A: It sure looks like Halloween out there. The leaves are falling. My name is Adrian Pocabelle. Welcome back. And a big, massive Happy Friday. I am so excited. Oh, this is the long version.
00:00:39.565 - 00:01:00.235, Speaker A: It's kind of fun, isn't it? Now I have to manually reduce the volume. This will just keep going. This is the two minute version. Hilarious. Maybe I should just use that and then manually reduce the volume. Anyways, welcome back. Now getting to the volume of this piece.
00:01:00.235 - 00:01:36.005, Speaker A: These guys master musicians as well as, as you can see here, master, you know, for lack of better term. And I hesitate to put a label on them of just, you know, reducing them to a genre. The Kurt Hussle Collective, Cage, Ceteri Visual and J and K. But look at how rich the, you know, what I was going to say, the analog video glitchery is here. They really are like, look at the textures. And it's kind of back to this whole idea. Let me get the volume.
00:01:36.005 - 00:01:47.845, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, this. This is how I like to celebrate Halloween. This is. This is Halloween. My style. Love the music. Always awesome music.
00:01:47.845 - 00:02:21.701, Speaker A: I think they can be, frankly, great musicians. Like, they probably. They may be kind of, who knows, mysterious duo. This is how I like to do it here. So one of, I guess the Halloween laughter. It's almost like they have one of those records, right, with the Halloween spooky sounds. I don't know if you ever had one of those.
00:02:21.701 - 00:03:10.855, Speaker A: I had one of those. I. So just rad, as you can see here. And I guess part of what I love about what I'm seeing here, among many other things, is something I've been kind of focusing a lot on, which is this embracing of the artifacts, so to speak, the JPEG artifacts, like truly embracing the glitch, right? The thing that's not working as it should and celebrating it. And what I mean by that is, see the edges, for example, of the pumpkin, they're kind of fuzzed out a little bit here. It's almost out of focus is that some sort of rendering situation that's being taken advantage of. And of course the screen itself.
00:03:10.855 - 00:04:07.509, Speaker A: And then, you know, the music also kind of, you know, slowing down, speeding up. I again, the edge here, it's beautiful, truly. It becomes again, we're kind of back to this painterliness, right? This embracing of the artifacts is kind of the equivalent of the paint drop, the paint, the paint dropping, you know, as you're, you know, putting the brush on the canvas and the paint falls right onto the canvas. We all love it, don't we? Or at least a lot of us, many of us love it when that happens in painting. So to see it, you know. So I feel like we're seeing more analogies between this huge, you know, revolutionary jump we're making here. As I was mentioning a couple of episodes ago, between painting and.
00:04:07.509 - 00:04:56.781, Speaker A: Or at least the visual arts kind of. I don't want to call it pre digital, but basically, but let's call it that. Where the digital medium, I, you know, we're really seeing a kind of a different, whole different set of aesthetics really emerge here. And that is weirdly easy to forget. And I wonder if it's because we've been born, almost everybody now to a certain degree, or exposed or immersed in the digital environment. Even if it's like my parents would, they're. It's not like they're probably more immersed than most of us, you know, watching cnn, right? So, you know, being immersed in it that we kind of forget.
00:04:56.781 - 00:05:14.359, Speaker A: And I'm kind of always brought back to this story, which I tell over and over, watch this 25 minute YouTube video on the history of, Of. Of. Of Western or of. Of. Of painting or whatever they call it. The history of art in 25 minutes, I think they call it. And, and for me, I just go again.
00:05:14.359 - 00:05:41.741, Speaker A: And I've told this story a million times, but it's worth telling. I just go, holy. What we're doing here is pretty far, you know, this is like another planet in a weird way. You know, for all of the talk of space, it's, you know, it's like. So we're kind of reestablishing. What do they call it, you know, Terence McKenna's great essay. Title and essay, New Maps of Hyperspace.
00:05:41.741 - 00:06:24.463, Speaker A: To a certain degree, one could argue we are kind of cartographers here of a certain kind. We are trying to establish, you know, what is going on. The market helps us by seeing what is appreciated right in the digital art market. And it's like, oh, okay, all of a sudden this is kind of becoming a thing. Maybe small works are cool too. And all of this stuff starts to become a new kind of map, shall we say aesthetic map, A new kind of aesthetic principles that we are deriving here from this revolutionary jump, I would argue. So we begin here.
00:06:24.463 - 00:06:36.743, Speaker A: And so Kurt Hustle Collective. Showtime. What a title. I love these Guys, it's still available. I Hope I have 10 daysos in my wallet. And there is Haiti. Rockette.
00:06:36.743 - 00:06:45.767, Speaker A: Collecting, Having fun. Akira Dice. I can't believe there's this many available. There's still nine. What? Maybe. Okay, so this is. I probably.
00:06:45.767 - 00:07:01.211, Speaker A: This probably just got listed. So if you're fast, you can get this wonderful, delightful work called Showtime. It's that time of year. Time to show excitement, time to show fear. It's Showtime. Indeed. Indeed.
00:07:01.211 - 00:07:34.665, Speaker A: So very quickly, for those that don't know the Kurt Hustle Collective, let me just show some of their, you know, older works here that are just among some of my favorite works of art. And this one, I mean, the boom boxes are awesome, awesome, awesome. Was it a six Puma? Just, you know, just for example, you know, putting our hand in the stream here and picking up some water. We'll see if it works. We'll see if. Yeah. Oh, yeah.
00:07:34.665 - 00:08:07.625, Speaker A: See the music, like, and just the concept, the background and original music. And you're like, okay, yeah, this is cool. Pretty interesting. Whoa. This is cool. That's what I say. Whoa.
00:08:07.625 - 00:08:31.042, Speaker A: Anyway, this is. Anyway, that goes on for 2 minutes and 34 seconds. I. I show that work in the show I did. It's almost two years now that I did at Zedbar here in Berlin. What a work. I'd say only $32.87.
00:08:31.042 - 00:08:48.309, Speaker A: 52 tezos. Rad. Anyway, yeah, go check those guys out. Just, you know, dipping our toes in the water there. Literally, like there is so much more to discover there. So just giving you a few clues for those that are interested. Last show.
00:08:48.309 - 00:09:15.493, Speaker A: Thank you for the support. What a beautiful work that was that we started with there and I managed to get here. Isn't this awesome? I managed to get it where it just shows my videos now when we scroll down, which kind of makes me happy here. Okay. Keeps consistent with the show Runetoon. To echo the sentiment and the shroom news. You, pokebelly and your show have made me a better artist and have created new neural connections for my artist's mind.
00:09:15.493 - 00:09:37.901, Speaker A: Thank you for the wonderful comment. Runetoon. What a great show we had with Nouve 1914 is how you pronounce it where we. If you listen, you'll hear why nouve1914 shows their name or her name. So thank you, Rune. I appreciate the vibes as ever and that's awesome to hear. Wow.
00:09:37.901 - 00:10:07.669, Speaker A: I am loving Kazuhiro Ehara's work. So, of course, this work we started with here, this incredibly awesome work, just the right amount of spontaneous messiness with an underlying sense of control. Totally agree with you. Indeed. I think the contrast that is going at work here is order and chaos. Dare I say it. Not to be overly cosmic about this, but that's ultimately what we have is intent and meaning.
00:10:07.669 - 00:10:35.615, Speaker A: Intended meaning, mixing with. To use the brushstroke example, why do we like a brushstroke? There's intention, but there's randomness within that. So not making it too simple. It adds a sense of complexity and it dazzles our mind. A complexifier. And I think there's something there. So anyways, great to hear that you're agreeing our gourde and also on Twitter, thank you for the nice response here.
00:10:35.615 - 00:11:01.431, Speaker A: We're doing fabulously on X here, so again, thank you for the support. Universal Reality Alternative oh my God, Will There Be a Halloween Chapter? So at first I thought maybe that episode was the closest we were going to get. There are quite a few Halloween works though, and we're starting with one. So this is your Halloween episode. Thank you for stimulating that thought. Universal Reality Alternative Absurd Deity so interesting comment here. Hello, Adrian.
00:11:01.431 - 00:11:31.845, Speaker A: I very much appreciate you introducing me to challenging art. Indeed. And for me as well, by the way. Just because I show something here on that point doesn't mean I'm like, you all have to buy it and you have to love this and everything. Sometimes I might bring it up as a question to myself and to the world, so to speak. So I'm glad you bring this up in a sense, because for me it might be challenging too. And it might be like, what is to be said about this? Right.
00:11:31.845 - 00:12:08.991, Speaker A: Let's continue. Thank you for bringing challenging art as well as forms of art that I would not in the past have appreciated as art. When we think of Waffles as a great example, one time of art that I'll admit I did not get it until just recently was the GLB format, I guess, also called gltf, perhaps due to my exposure to this file format. So for those that don't know glb and we're going to see a couple in this episode, it's what I loosely call virtual sculpture. It's sort of like a 3D image. Actually, I brought it up, I brought this work up that it's this is a GLB and you can zoom in. It's kind of like digital sculpture.
00:12:08.991 - 00:12:34.161, Speaker A: I knew someone that once the Apple Vision Pro came out, all of a sudden started buying GLBs, thinking, okay, this is going to be a major bull market in GLBs. Interesting thesis. Interesting thesis. So this is a GLB. Okay. And I believe this is the work actually that's going to be mentioned here in any case. The art of Salwaqui and Marcel Muntianu, who made this work here that we saw only briefly.
00:12:34.161 - 00:12:59.259, Speaker A: And again, thank you for bringing that up. We just kind of touched it in the community there has opened my eyes to both the visual and narrative power of glb. Take for example, Digital Couture. I believe it's this one. It is Digital Couture by Marcel Montiano. And with so many of the works that you share that become even more amazing as you zoom in on them, this work just gets better and better the more you spin it around and zoom in on each component. It's pretty interesting.
00:12:59.259 - 00:13:16.397, Speaker A: Please do. When you get the time, take a look inside the backpack of this particular work and prepare to be amazed and amused. And there you have it. Right. So that is, I mean, the detail here. And it's almost like this. Like what is going on here? Right? It's almost.
00:13:16.397 - 00:13:41.125, Speaker A: It's like taking the candles down there. Interesting. So the amount of work put into this and this rad kind of eight bit work and everything and look, I mean, you know, to absurd deities point. Like, pretty impressive. Like when you start zooming in here. Please do. When you get the time, take a look inside the backpack.
00:13:41.125 - 00:14:09.631, Speaker A: I considered posting this to that art sharing thread, but felt that this was a lot more appropriate location, as what I'm expressing here is not. Take a look at Marcel Manciano's art, though you should. But rather, yeah, commenting on the GLB format, but rather, that is with other forms of art that have yet to be fully embraced and realized by the mainstream art community. For example, purely digital art. Pixel art, indeed. AI art. That's an interesting way of putting it.
00:14:09.631 - 00:14:41.211, Speaker A: Purely digital art. That's a very interesting question. That is a very interesting question. Has purely digital art been embraced by the mainstream art community? That is a very interesting question, because I would have assumed. Yes, but is that true? That's a very interesting question. One we'll have to return to. Just like these other genres, GLB art, when done skillfully, has the power to wow, awe and emotionally influence the observer, as do other already universally accepted forms of art.
00:14:41.211 - 00:15:27.445, Speaker A: Indeed, I would argue that the ability to rotate along multiple axes and zoom allows for an intimacy with the art that has the potential to make it even more impactful than could an isolated PNG, JPEG or other static 2D representation. You know what I think of, like, what this evokes in my head when you say this absurd deity is Michelangelo. Like, from what I understood of Michelangelo, who is, of course, a sculptor first, as far as I understand, was always trying to get back to sculpture. Like, he loved sculpture and was, okay, the Pope wants me to paint, you know, the Sistine Chapel. Okay. You know, 30 years later, the Pope wants me to paint the Last Judgment. You know, that's what it makes me think of.
00:15:27.445 - 00:16:02.345, Speaker A: Like, I think maybe you have that same kind of love of sculpture, and I like sculpture. But for me, you know, just on a personal level, I am kind of really wed to the. I'd almost say the 2D static image. I have expanded, I'd say, as a result of this community and just being involved in the scene here in the last three years and being exposed to the works of Heidi Rockette, even Kurt Hustle Collective. I didn't really used to love video art that much, but I love what I saw there at the start. I love the vibes, right? So, you know, so. But I'm pretty kind of.
00:16:02.345 - 00:16:56.051, Speaker A: So I'm not religious about how I, you know, embrace it. But, yeah, certain things kind of trigger in a good way, let's say, are really just kind of hit the reptilian aspect. It's interesting sculpture, I guess, just to finalize, like, sculpture is such a weird thing for me because it's not like it's a. It truly is a different kind of appreciation, because with a 2D painting, you see everything, or a flat painting or a flat work or a little bit of texture, you see all of the way you're supposed to see it, the experience. And I think that's why it kind of resonates, generally speaking, say, especially across the Internet and across culture. When I say the Mona Lisa, we all basically share the same image in our heads, more or less, with some variety. When I say Michelangelo's David, you might be thinking of it from this angle, I might be thinking of it from this angle.
00:16:56.051 - 00:17:24.245, Speaker A: You know, like, there's about a million. Like, what are. What image are we talking about? We're talking about a sculpture, not an image. So it really is a different kind of mindset. So anyways, I think we can start to apply that difference in appreciation to the digital sculpture or the virtual sculpture going on in glb. I suspect it's the same kind of an analogous appreciation as to sculpture, which I think is maybe staying the obvious. So thank you for the comment.
00:17:24.245 - 00:17:33.069, Speaker A: Fabulous absurd deity, neural, divine. Amazing art on this show, Adrian. Thank you. Great to hear. Yan. Lucas Magone. Fresh start.
00:17:33.069 - 00:18:02.655, Speaker A: Yeah with indeed the newspaper of the imagination. It is the editor's duty and you know to always keep it as fresh as possible. Here. Kaizu Kazuhiro Ehara so we heard from Kazuhiro the artist here in question. Awesomely, what does Kazuhiro say? Shout out the love to you Poco. Adrian so awesome to hear from Kazuhiro Ahara. I believe out of Japan if I'm not mistaken here.
00:18:02.655 - 00:18:28.145, Speaker A: So more just fabulous artists there. Just m0great content. This was interesting. I saw Manny's comment regarding the on chain Tezos minting and felt it would be good for me to reach out and clarify a few things. The on chain ONCHFS developed by NFT Protector is the only one method to mint on chain. He built this after I released my zero contract. There are two unique ways to mint on chain and have different uses.
00:18:28.145 - 00:19:14.689, Speaker A: Zero contract is for a single transaction 20 kilobytes or less and ONCHFS, which was developed by FXHash is used for anything large. There is no max size, but cost can escalate quickly once you're into the into megabytes. As for costs, so there's two basically ways of minting on chain and there's the less than 20 kilobyte version and the more than 20 kilobyte version from what I understand. As for costs for minting Tezos on chain, it is inexpensive at current prices. I have just minted six blockchain on six blockchains. Each of them is fully on chain. With my Destil Demons collection I have minted on six blockchains, Each of them is fully on chain and costs and costs vary quite a bit.
00:19:14.689 - 00:19:43.277, Speaker A: My artwork is 3 to 6 kilobyte SVG and here are the low ends of my real costs. My Tezos mints were about 2 tezos or 1.8, so less than $2 at that time to mint 3 to 6 kilobytes. Interesting. I mean bitcoin again, I'm kind of back to is that 4 or 5 bucks though when it's at 2 or 3 vbytes I was able to mint as low as $10 on eth when it when it was under 1 guai. Good job doing that. I I still need to transfer a whole bunch of turn.
00:19:43.277 - 00:20:04.465, Speaker A: You know Peloponnesian War works. I didn't take advantage. I don't know what GUI we're at now, but it's probably more than that. I remember that, but at three Gwei costs the costs were in the 30 to 50 range. Like that's the difference and Guay's gas prices. For those that don't know a blockchain thing, forget forget trying to mint on chain at 10 guai. So if this loses you, we're about to continue.
00:20:04.465 - 00:20:31.799, Speaker A: But finally I inscribed ordinals or on blockchain for about 85,000 SATs, inscriptions, fees, transactions total which was around $40. I think the SAT VBytes at the time was 6 to 8 exactly. So probably maybe in the. I was. I minted a few on the weekend that were around 4 kilobytes and we were at like 3V bytes. 2, 3, 4V bytes and they're costing me like 6 or 7 $8. The non L1s are just as cheap.
00:20:31.799 - 00:21:04.909, Speaker A: Polygon was only a few pennies. Interestingly, base has been in the. That's really interesting. Base has been in the 10 to 30 cent range. Arbitrum was even cheaper. Very interesting, isn't it? I wonder what the limit on megabyte size on Arbitrum and Polygon are because again, I'm kind of back to this notion that if you can get on chain like an art blockchain, like can we. You know, I think ideally we don't have interplanetary file server.
00:21:04.909 - 00:21:24.913, Speaker A: I think in a perfect world we mint everything on chain. I just think it's more resilient and I think it stands to reason. So that's super interesting. Thank you for clarifying. And there is more content here. So because of the technical nature of this. Yeah, I guess we'll end here.
00:21:24.913 - 00:21:56.925, Speaker A: Probably not clear because miner on chain is always a bit tricky, but I'm advanced on any chain because in my opinion the collector's blockchain preference tends to take priority. That's true, isn't it? There is a tribalism there, unless there is a technical reason to pick one over another. And here are some examples here. So you can see if there are nine artists currently using the Zero contract, with more currently developing their collections. It's kind of a chance for you to get your workout kind of seen by people who are really into this. Like there's Tornado, there's Green Ginger, Kyle Flemmer, Retro Manny. I mean there's Stalamir.
00:21:56.925 - 00:22:18.609, Speaker A: Like we really haven't seen too many people do this. So super interesting. I built my own viewer so that the on chain data is pulled directly from the blockchain. So here's a dev from what I can tell with just zero. Super interesting. Thank you for the comment. Yeah, I do want to mint on Tezos just to see what the Experience is like on chain.
00:22:18.609 - 00:22:38.565, Speaker A: Pedro Jose I can't miss Journal 369 where's my coffee? Indeed. Thank you. And Carolina Ferreira. Very nice. Thank you. And here also is Manny on so I don't want to lose the people that don't know too much about this blockchain. Just to clear up 20 kilobytes toss five tezos.
00:22:38.565 - 00:23:06.061, Speaker A: So it uses a minted where the art is minted to one block. So again if you're planning to use small works use zero contracts. So I think this is what if you want to make larger works use objects ui. So thank you for the comments Retro Manny. And I think we kind of covered this with the last comment here by justem0 thank you both. Super interesting discussion there. Obtainer.
00:23:06.061 - 00:23:22.641, Speaker A: Thank you for the feature Adrian. And no it's not gimp. It was done in aseprite. I'm trying to remember the work now. Oh I remember remember the kappen or figments type of kind of circulating gradients. Red RGB that was done in asperite. Interesting.
00:23:22.641 - 00:23:48.345, Speaker A: Super interesting. 369 Another episode 369 it's your lucky episode. 369 Stiffen Pixel awesome to hear from you rad artist. Ariel. Thank you for showing my work. I'm trying to diversify techniques and styles and that illustrated illustration made with AI then with several programs I rescale it after color and movement. And I remember that that was the work where we saw what looked like Ariel's work on.
00:23:48.345 - 00:23:58.537, Speaker A: So that was an AI with several programs and rescale. We'll have to revisit that. Super interesting. Thanks for letting me know. Ariel. That was on I believe last episode. I loved it.
00:23:58.537 - 00:24:15.755, Speaker A: Thank you. And Loren King Kazu Kazuhiro deserved it. Indeed. Indeed. And this work we saw by Marcel Munchano picked up by Absurd Deity here. And finally I'm going to go quickly through the community here. Andre.
00:24:15.755 - 00:24:51.907, Speaker A: These are awesome, these exquisite corpses. And actually I did bring this up. So there were three exquisite corpses that Rosettio, Renny Fish and Andre Summer Blues made. And of course I follow Andre and yeah, here's one of them just to give you a quick look. So of course the Exquisite Corpse is a surrealist kind of game where you fold, let's say in this case the paper in three. I would draw on one part and then you see where. Just where the lines meet up at when it's folded and then you give it to the next person and they have.
00:24:51.907 - 00:25:14.559, Speaker A: They can't see what's going on. And then they don't draw on the second part without being able to see what's going on. And the third part, I think you just know where the lines are and then I think that's how it works. I don't think you can see the other ones as far as I remember anyway. Roseo times rainy fish times summer blues. How cool is that? And 2 sold 3 sold so far at 15 tezos for this exquisite corpse. So super cool that they're doing that.
00:25:14.559 - 00:25:33.049, Speaker A: Libroblock had to indulge in a bit of Halloween, so yeah, we're going to check that out later in the show. Thank you for posting. I think we might end with that work too. Human Boy blown away by this. And yeah, Clown Vamp. This is interesting. Very quickly, a physical interactive AI art robot immersive solo show and collection.
00:25:33.049 - 00:25:58.415, Speaker A: Collection drop in Marfa Ongoing generative public art project critiquing How AI is corrupting advertising How AI is corrupting advertising. Not how advertising is corrupting, you know, society, but how AI is corrupting advertising. How interesting. Interesting word. Look at that. TikTok's AI tool accidentally let you put I won't mention the H word there in a paid actor's mouth. So you can read all about this.
00:25:58.415 - 00:26:32.115, Speaker A: I can't go through the whole thing here, but pretty rad here. And so AI of course has to be involved with advertising. I guess this is an example. So great thread here by Clown Vamp. Thank you for posting and continuing Retro Manny thank you for posting a new a more cinematic approach for the next chapter of Retro Man. So also here indeed. And I think we were seeing this figure earlier, so it feels like it's turning into a some sort of game movie is what's going on here.
00:26:32.115 - 00:26:55.843, Speaker A: I mean video games these days kind of look like movies, don't they? So super interesting. And of course wonderful to have Kurt also collective post this in the community. What an honor. Kylo DZ I think we have a work by Kylo actually later in the show in the AI section. I'm not reflecting on something serious. I love to experiment with ASMR like textures and street photography to find chaos and randomness. Glad to find this creative space.
00:26:55.843 - 00:27:10.883, Speaker A: Welcome and Micara Vota Idiota. Interesting piece here. Cool. Kind of looks like AI Digital Art Centero. So we can't go. This is pretty cool outline here. Memento Mori.
00:27:10.883 - 00:27:28.429, Speaker A: Interesting. I'll leave the link in the comments. 369 we're going to look at this poll later in the tabs here. Universal Reality Alternative so a work minted on Object. Thank you for posting August Ground Glitchwitch. I brought this up. This piece is David lynch meets glitch.
00:27:28.429 - 00:27:44.635, Speaker A: And so it is in the glitch section. Open Edition 3 Tezos. Thank you for posting and Strange Thing. And we're going to look at this right away. This show. Look at this even in the newspaper here in Corriere. Thank you to Italy's most prestigious newspaper that has featured my show.
00:27:44.635 - 00:28:04.435, Speaker A: Wow. You know, you really have to be impressed with Strange Thing. Very, very cool. What Strange Thing is doing here? Let's continue. We're going to see a whole bunch more in a couple of tabs here. Chromevoid, thank you for posting. Kind of another Halloween feeling.
00:28:04.435 - 00:28:19.221, Speaker A: Work. And Fatimare, thank you for posting a digital drawing probably done in Procreate And Rosatio. Here is the. I think this is the Exquisite Corpse. It is digital Exquisite corpse. So kind of perfect for Halloween. Great idea.
00:28:19.221 - 00:28:36.903, Speaker A: Nice poster. Ilia Bliznets, thank you for posting. Just a digital and AI perhaps. I think it's combination. If I remember right, here's Libro Block. Thank you for posting. We're going to look at the pumpkins in a little bit here and someone's Halloween ready, of course.
00:28:36.903 - 00:28:52.395, Speaker A: So this we saw last episode. So awesome. Thank you everybody for posting. The Community, I think was at 6. Is it still at 666? Let's just look. I mean, that would have kind of been perfect for Halloween. Let's just see.
00:28:52.395 - 00:29:04.845, Speaker A: It is. It was meant to be. Okay, awesome. Let's continue. So here is Strange things work Renaissance 2.0 times Rome. And of course the solo show is in Rome.
00:29:04.845 - 00:29:29.947, Speaker A: And here are the works. So just pretty cool. What I. I can see why Italy would really enjoy this. And here it is in the gallery live now on foundation. Because it's like, you have to understand is sort of how I would put it. Like Italians have been subject to Renaissance art and these images for centuries.
00:29:29.947 - 00:30:03.725, Speaker A: It is part of the culture. Any city you go to, there's the Pinacoteca, the little painting gallery, so to speak. And it is just ingrained in the culture. So I can see why they are kind of loving and why it was Rome of all places that decided to, you know, hey, strange thing, let's do a solo show of physical works. Let's put it in the newspaper picks it up because then they go, oh, this is different. This is new, this is what I know, but different. So real cool.
00:30:03.725 - 00:30:17.193, Speaker A: Look at how nice the show is too. So interesting. Looks like TVs interestingly. But pretty nice show. Looks like a nice serious crowd here. And they look like. Look, they are looking at the work.
00:30:17.193 - 00:30:35.457, Speaker A: This isn't your typical art show where everybody's in the middle chatting to each other and everybody's looking at the work here. Really nicely done. That's on foundation Bull run of the 3rd of the 17th is sold out. So this one here, sold out. So pretty cool. Interesting. Only a few works.
00:30:35.457 - 00:30:55.153, Speaker A: Interestingly beautiful work here. There's still. Thank you to every collector. There's still. There are still editions available of other works with found on the foundation homepage. Remember to claim prints so if you buy one of these you can get a print and we saw the prints yesterday or last episode two days ago. Super interesting.
00:30:55.153 - 00:31:36.307, Speaker A: Big congrats to strange thing Max capacity. I'm going to start offering consulting services on crypto culture because I think all these platforms are run by VCs and devs who don't think much about the culture to their detriment. You know, there is a sense, there is a disconnect, I think. I mean we do see it in the different platforms and we're actually going to see a whole bunch of discussion on this. But what this also stimulated there was talks of a Patreon and I think that's how I might frame the Patreon as a kind of. In a sense maybe I go to the history of like and just kind of almost something of value for collectors who might not know of certain areas. And it doesn't mean the regular show can't come across those areas.
00:31:36.307 - 00:32:05.891, Speaker A: But really it's like here's some intelligence, so to speak on you know, different little hidden areas of, you know, and I don't know everything but just interesting little areas on the. In the Tazos history. Because this show is very much about kind of what's come out in the last couple of days generally. So that's what I was thinking, you know. And then you do like should institutions ever want. Then you have the super package and all that. So I was thinking about this for the Patreon and then you just have the very simple version but then you have different stages.
00:32:05.891 - 00:32:23.471, Speaker A: So just wanted to share Max capacity. Stimulating the brain Here Kvon we launched. So this is a little controversial here. So Kvon is the founder. Not founder, maybe the CEO. I don't know if he's a founder but is behind Rodeo Club. We launched Rodeo Club in June.
00:32:23.471 - 00:32:48.225, Speaker A: We have a core community that's using the product every day. They're not getting rich. There's no quick buck to make they're coming back to discover, connect, to explore. These are the enduring human values we aim to uplift. An interesting question, can you have like. This is the question right as we begin. For those that don't know Rodeo, like Zora, another platform they're basically doing, trying to, I would argue my interpretation.
00:32:48.225 - 00:33:45.385, Speaker A: They're basically launching an Instagram style interface with digital art. But instead of, you know, you listing it for 10 bucks or $5 or $100, basically it's every like is like 20 cents and then oh, is that going to, you know, create a market so to speak, is that going to work? And the thing is, I would say like the market is very important to the scene. Like I think if this were to become the paradigm, I think it'll be like Spotify, right? As we've discussed before and other people have pointed out. And there's not much incentive, I would argue to start a band these days. And I think we see it, I would argue, I mean actually Xen had a great post, you know, after phone, I think it was after the phone. Like music hasn't been that great. You know, there haven't been a huge amount of innovations, let's say.
00:33:45.385 - 00:34:32.488, Speaker A: And is it because there's not enough, you know, financial, frankly incentive, like the market can't be underestimated. Like there has to be some, you know, incentive here like a marketless. I'm not convinced at all that we would have the same production and the same quality of production without a healthy market. And there's a huge difference between putting on tazos where you get 100 bucks for your work oftentimes or 50 bucks or 30 bucks or $400 and getting like 2 bucks or 20 bucks or 10 bucks or no, not even 20 bucks. You know, maybe some people. So also here, perhaps the most controversial aspect to rodeo is that it's not designed to make you rich. It's designed around discovery and social interaction.
00:34:32.488 - 00:35:16.460, Speaker A: And when you embrace these elements, you open yourself to new relationships and new ideas. Now I thought and Yuri kind of trolling, basically replacing substituting rodeo with object.com it's not designed to make you rich. It's diner but at least it'll make you richer. I would argue but is 787 I think kind of put it well, it is designed to make rodeo rich. And why is, you know, why is rodeo doing what they're doing? Is it for social interaction? Is that why they're doing what they're doing and to open themselves to new ideas or do they want to kind of make it big and make a whole bunch of money and do well and succeed. And I just don't believe they're doing this so that they can have a fancy conversation.
00:35:16.460 - 00:35:42.305, Speaker A: Otherwise you can still do that with foundation, right? I mean they're doing it to get rich. 787 is hitting the nail on the head artists. You and your art are still the product. You're just not being paid for it. Instead you're giving it away in exchange for quote unquote discovery. But once discovered and discovered by who? People who are paying 2 cents or 20 cents per image. I mean a lot of the regular collectors don't even like I would argue the experience.
00:35:42.305 - 00:36:15.635, Speaker A: Like for me it's almost a dragon. It's like, oh, I have to go there and I have to do this thing and like it's work. Weirdly, it's taken the joy out of it for whatever reason. But once discovered. Will anyone want to buy your tokenized art if they already minted it for free? Now I'm not as worried about this, but there is something to be said for it. But I'm not as worried about, oh, you put some works on Rodeo and all of a sudden your collector base is diminished. Rodeo is great discovery of selling art adjacent socks, hair ties and sticker packs.
00:36:15.635 - 00:36:51.095, Speaker A: But so is Instagram. It does not seem great for artists future sales of tokenized art. And I just agree, like I guess what I want to highlight, as I always put it here, the market is the beating heart of the scene and the free market. And if we don't have, you know, and is this, here's a question for you. Is it a free market on these platforms? In a sense it is, you could say, because I voluntarily, let's say, would put a work on this platform. But I don't get the freedom to choose the listing price. So in a sense you could say it's free market because I can go to a different platform, which I think is what most artists do.
00:36:51.095 - 00:37:19.795, Speaker A: And maybe I'll be wrong and maybe they'll all jump onto Rodeo and Zora. But there's not the freedom of pricing. And so it's like again, I'm kind of back to free market Price discovery. Where's the price Discovery? Is it in when the tokens go to some other platform and then we're trying to chase after whatever, you know, know. So who knows? I guess we'll see what happens. Max capacity Shape Another L2 is a joke. Look at my profile.
00:37:19.795 - 00:37:36.897, Speaker A: So max capacity sets up on shape. Another Ethereum L2 kind of seemingly VC oriented. Who knows? I don't know that. Just seemingly. It's just a page advertising their official drops. It doesn't even have any links to my drop. It looks like an advertisement for my friend Apocalyptic Form.
00:37:36.897 - 00:37:54.125, Speaker A: His drop is sick. But what's it doing on my profile? And I brought it up. This is Max Capacity's profile on Shape. So I didn't even know that what the web like so shape.network stack. So here's Max Capacity. And to Max Capacity's point, like this is his friend Apocalypse.
00:37:54.125 - 00:38:23.939, Speaker A: So you show up on his profile and it's all this other advertising, right? And it's kind of back to these other platforms. You get to Zora where there's the QR code kind of eyesore with the art. You get to Rodeo, where there's no maximize. I don't know if they've finally have started to put the a little bit of the history of when it was minted. I think they brought that in later. Right. But you can't even maximize the art.
00:38:23.939 - 00:38:44.635, Speaker A: So to me it's just more evidence when the art is not the focus, it shows. Right. Patrick Amadon. Normalized, decentralized channels and artists direct to collectors. Bypass platforms. Normalize, decentralized channels and artists direct to collectors. This is the revolution.
00:38:44.635 - 00:39:21.019, Speaker A: Like what is the revolution of Bitcoin? It's you don't have to go through a bank. It's a trustless transaction, peer to peer, right? That is the revolution. So why do you know, in a sense the platforms should be an added value to the artist. And if they're not, they're not. Right? And then you know how to proceed. But really I think Amadon's right here that ultimately the way to do it, so to speak, is to create your own kind of platform. You are the platform in a sense.
00:39:21.019 - 00:39:58.515, Speaker A: And then you have different channels and maybe you want to use object, maybe you want to use exchange art, maybe you want to use, you know, gamma. But you don't need to because you already have built out your social media, basically your PR front end where you don't need to worry about it. It's like, okay, if foundation shuts down, that's fine, I'll use manifold. And if manifold shuts down, that's fine, I'll use. Surely there's going to be a tool out there, bypass platforms. We collectively need to be more adept technically so we're not as reliant on the manifolds of the world as well. And saying as people move to manifold as an alternative to foundation.
00:39:58.515 - 00:40:37.397, Speaker A: You know, I think in principle, I totally agree with this. 369. Hi everyone. Do you think artists should delete the original digital artwork after minting? Definitely not. Because this is the equivalent of the right click save, you know, basically, which is saying, you know, it's about the ledger, I would say, in the database of the blockchain, so to speak, that says, okay, I have paid for this and I have basically own it with that same piece. Yeah, sure, you can right click save and everything. And even if you were to delete it off your computer, anybody that can see it online can just save it anyway.
00:40:37.397 - 00:41:02.835, Speaker A: Right. So there's no point would be my sort of take on this. Interesting question, though. And another one, Ann Laramie from Superrare. What will happen if one person owns the nft, the other person owns the original physical. So we're going to go into what flannel says here in a second. But the basic thinking I have on this is every medium expression of a work is an iteration of that work.
00:41:02.835 - 00:41:33.861, Speaker A: Now, there are subtleties in a sense, hence different artworks. So for example, if you have a physical painting you've made and you take a photo of it, and then you make that an nft, ultimately what you have there is a different iteration of the canvas. Canvas work, the physical canvas. But really what and what that iteration is, though, is a photo of a painting. So is that worth as much as the painting? I would say, hell no. Right. But it's not.
00:41:33.861 - 00:41:53.905, Speaker A: Doesn't mean it's worthless. Right. And maybe you print it out and then you sign it and then it kind of maybe increases the value somewhat. Now, flannel capital brings up an interesting point which is on where it originates. And I think this does matter. Strong personal opinion, flannel capital. Now, I don't agree with this.
00:41:53.905 - 00:42:12.199, Speaker A: Physical and NFT should always go together. Otherwise neither is a true 1 of 1. And again, I would say it really depends on the situ. We need more specifics here. But again, I see them as different works. I think it's conceptually and philosophically clearer this way. Simpler.
00:42:12.199 - 00:42:30.063, Speaker A: Right? It's A equals A. This is a photo of a painting. We don't need to, you know, debate anything. It's what it is. It's recognizing things as they are, I would argue, is my kind of version of it. So they're not identical. And I think that's the implication here, is that they're identical.
00:42:30.063 - 00:42:50.647, Speaker A: I would argue from a that they should go together, that they are a unity. Let's continue. When they're separated. I think the original is the medium, I guess. And they're not saying identical, they're saying together. To be fair, when they're separated, I think the original is the medium that was. The original is the medium that was originally created.
00:42:50.647 - 00:43:19.485, Speaker A: And yeah, I do put it this way. I think the value is in the medium where something was originally created. I totally agree with this. Or at least in terms of where the value should be placed. You know, if Strange Thing, for example, he's selling them together, and I think that's fair enough, but I don't think there should be anything. I would argue separating Strange Thing. Let's say Strange Thing makes Thug Lord, which he did, and then wanted to offer a whole bunch of prints on that.
00:43:19.485 - 00:43:44.565, Speaker A: Should he not be able to do that as the person that created the work? And maybe signed editions, posters, whatever. T shirts. Is that not allowed? I would say it should be allowed. So it's just. But is it worth anything? Is the question. Right. And I think, again, it's just a different iteration, so it is a different object.
00:43:44.565 - 00:44:16.799, Speaker A: Right. If Marcel Muntianu makes a 3D print of 3D printer version of that sculpture, I think that's fair enough and super cool. Should he be stopped from being able to do that? I don't think so. And in a weird way, you might argue, hey, maybe that's more valuable than the digital glb. And I think that debate, like, let the value falls fall where it is. And I think really, the market will figure it out. Actually, at the end of the day, as it did with Damien Hirst.
00:44:16.799 - 00:44:50.495, Speaker A: Remember Damien Hirst and whatever the series was called with the paint drips and it was like, you know, came out in the 2021, I think, and you had six months to decide if you want the physical or the digital. The physicals now are worth way more. And the photos of the physical that were turned into NFTs, I don't think are worth nearly as much, last I heard. Right. And that's the market figuring it out. That's the market going well. Are you kidding me? This photo of a Damien Hirst versus, like, the painting, the original, you know, so, yeah, so that is.
00:44:50.495 - 00:45:23.781, Speaker A: But I don't think Damien Hirsch should be stopped from selling photos of his work. I just think the market, if it's buying into that, which it did, and large, is kind of, you know, it's buyer beware, know what you're doing as a collector. So anyways, let's continue for a digitally native piece. The NFT is the original the physical print is a print. Exactly. For a physical piece with an associated nft, the physical is the original with the NFT serving as a digital reproduction. But you see, it gets convoluted and it's like, oh, but is the NFT the receipt for a physical or it's.
00:45:23.781 - 00:45:49.711, Speaker A: It's a digital reproduction. Like in a sense, for a physical you can do it, but it's just not going to be worth as much as we're bringing up with the example of Damien Hirst. Check this out. Mech. Txt, doing some good research here, made a little piece with Lomsart new pixel paint tool. So pretty nice result here. I brought it up and I tell you, it is a really cool tool.
00:45:49.711 - 00:46:16.035, Speaker A: Like here, I'll show you. Like you pick your texture, you pick your size of pixel and you pick your color. So you could go here and then you could go, hey, I was just fooling around with this. And I mean it's quite different kind of tool here. I also love the fact that at least you know it you. I'm using a mouse and you know, that does create a different kind of drawing here and then here. Okay.
00:46:16.035 - 00:46:38.311, Speaker A: And then. Okay, I want to make the flower in the middle. I wanted that full. I say this is really cool. Like nice textures here and you know, let's say that sky here or whatever, like, I mean, or just, you know, whatever kind of atmospherics here. Very nice mark making here. Let's, you know.
00:46:38.311 - 00:46:51.515, Speaker A: And then you can do a little. Maybe this is grass, the verticals. Right. So on and on. I don't know if it can't be just limited to these colors. There should be more colors here and it's basically a done deal. And look, I mean, I assume you can.
00:46:51.515 - 00:47:06.595, Speaker A: Anyways, let's not tempt fate. You can download it and you can even upload an image. Pretty cool tool, I tell you. This is also going to. That's kind of like an area to watch. Which are new tools made by artists. Tools made by artists.
00:47:06.595 - 00:47:27.019, Speaker A: We've seen that with Santiago using ChatGPT, I believe the waffle straws. Remember that cyber mystic. Look at this. This is how my work is done. All modeled in 3D and assembled to form a scene like a painting. So check this out. So we started with Marcel Pinello, Marcelo Pinel a couple episodes ago.
00:47:27.019 - 00:47:46.865, Speaker A: Look at this. I mean that is insane. So that flat two dimensional work is actually begun as a 3D work. And I tell you is just crying out as a kind of light relief in the style of like Donatello. Or something. Some of these works. And there is a Sufi.
00:47:46.865 - 00:47:58.357, Speaker A: So very cool. Look at that. I mean nice. I mean there's so many elements. You must need a powerful computer here. Super interesting. Great artist.
00:47:58.357 - 00:48:25.565, Speaker A: Here's Hermit Bay Pixel art. Another kind of sponsored this time with Uniqlo or another like kind of corporate partner, shall we say Uniqlo Kids kid approved. And so how cool. There's. There you see the giraffe. I mean this guy Hermipe sure gets some great working with all sorts of companies. Starbucks, there were others.
00:48:25.565 - 00:48:49.515, Speaker A: It seems like every a new week a new company that Hermipe is working with. Let's just check. Drawing of the newly opened Uniqlo Shinjuku flagship store Kids space the other day. In addition to the animals, the original motif of the kids space, this composition depicts nature. In building groups. There are products in cafe spaces that only stores that other stores don't have. And that was ingenuity everywhere to travel around relaxed while various products were available.
00:48:49.515 - 00:49:12.779, Speaker A: Anyway, pixel art continues to make waves here. And you see the brilliance of Hermipe's pixel art here. Small pixels, big pixels. Key to the situation here, playing with these different kinds of angles. Uniqlo kids. How fun. How fun is that? Just great.
00:49:12.779 - 00:49:33.095, Speaker A: Look at Popple. Popple A mysterious. The Enigma Popple who of course I follow Printing test. Look at these trading cards and they look like they are self made. If I had to venture a guess with. But not sure, not positive on that. And I have to say these are I believe all animated.
00:49:33.095 - 00:50:04.445, Speaker A: Right. But here they're working beautifully as stills. And again here's just like an open ended question. Should this be together with the NFT and sold together? I don't think so. Like would you pay money for this if you had a dollar, if it was selling for a dollar and there's an edition of 10, would you buy this Popple work and it was signed? I would say you probably would. At least I would. Would I be concerned that there's a digital version of this? No, because I would say this is a different work of art.
00:50:04.445 - 00:50:21.753, Speaker A: Right. This is a physical. And so every iteration will either justify itself or not. And it'll be reflected in the value. I would argue and I'd say here justified. Right. It justifies itself, it has its own feeling.
00:50:21.753 - 00:50:40.321, Speaker A: It's working with the trading card thing, which is a physical medium and all of these sorts of things. The printing process, the staticness versus the dynamic digital version. Super cool work. Let's just see. Printing test. Exciting, Exciting. So as we move into the works.
00:50:40.321 - 00:50:58.965, Speaker A: And of course the great Spiegels Maskinen with a Halloween themed work here. Another brilliant one. Look at this. Another work that could have started the show. Like look at this. I just started with Spiegels the other day. But just rad And I love the purple.
00:50:58.965 - 00:51:14.669, Speaker A: Great decision that purple and orange. So powerful. Just rad the pumpkin. Exiting the retro computer did the cell last? Sold for 0.036. So making a good dime here. Making some good money. Spiegels.
00:51:14.669 - 00:51:37.295, Speaker A: I don't know if we looked at this one, a really nice one that's blue. So Spiegels and then this different kind of computer here which some of us are familiar with, these kind of towers here. I guess maybe they still sell those once in a while. So another work in the Spiegels computer head collection. Super rad. Sold. By the way, new work here from Kanek Zapata.
00:51:37.295 - 00:51:53.705, Speaker A: This looks like ancient Greek. I want to call it like a Kate. I'm not sure what the word is, but I'm actually pretty. Yeah. Working with the Greek automaton. Automaton. So as we're learning the automata cellular automata.
00:51:53.705 - 00:52:26.265, Speaker A: A gift made with outputs of a Python script on Stephen Wolfram's study of one dimensional cellular automata. So still trying to figure out how this wonderful situation is being created. You know what really stands out is this white. It's a very powerful underutilized technique which is gray background and then white on top. Right where you actually. Or color the background and then using white because we so often use white as kind of our background starting out. And so white is often underutilized I'd argue as a result.
00:52:26.265 - 00:52:46.195, Speaker A: But and you see it here because also in the white really just kind of shines out. But here it's a pretty light gray. Like if you were just. If you didn't have any white here, you might even say oh, is that white? Okay, no, it's a little slightly darker. So anyways, more super interesting. Delightful work especially in here from Canxapita. Very excited about this.
00:52:46.195 - 00:53:17.417, Speaker A: And by the way, if you're wondering how much it sold for 300 tezos there's an auction. So congratulations, you're seeing the offers come in and I was like wow, I think some came in at like 180, 200. And I was like wow, maybe Canx Apta should have taken that but made the right decision to go at auction. So congrats to Canxapita. And this one which we also saw this went for 65 Tezos at auction. So doing well in the market. Congrats to them RJ with a new work, the Great He Goat.
00:53:17.417 - 00:53:57.025, Speaker A: This is 310 Tezos and again playing with this kind of multi layer technique with AI different kind of screen outputs, probably magic wand and everything collaborating together here. Nice negative space on top here as well. Contrasting with the busyness and just some cool almost edges of pixels. I wish we could zoom in but I think on I think that's because it's only 800 by a thousand. This is as big as it goes after Goya's the Witch's Sabbath. So maybe a Halloween inspired work there too. Here's Ed Morola Watercolor Demon.
00:53:57.025 - 00:54:38.885, Speaker A: Interesting piece from Ed. Let's zoom in a little bit. Love the. It almost looks like it's made for a 16 by 9 TV right? And this kind of figure here, just wonderfully free here and interesting textured background, bits of dithering, bits of out of focus ness and depending where you are on the screen it just kind of changes as you see here with the shadowing. So just another beautiful improvisation I would argue by Ed Morola. And here is this kind of large figure walking through this kind of terrain almost like a monster and whatever this kind of almost ribbon is here flowing through. Love the frame.
00:54:38.885 - 00:55:00.245, Speaker A: Super Original work edition of 100 for 667 and two sold so far. This was interesting too in its delightfully small work here. Watercolor Demon. So interesting. So this is max size here. We'll see if we can get any larger just to give you a sense. But really the best way to transform would be in Photoshop.
00:55:00.245 - 00:55:15.131, Speaker A: So cool. Small works here by Ed Merola. It's like the size of a Google Ad. Very cool as well. Watercolor demon 1 so just very. I love these small works just like we see with Kyle Flemmer. I like to do them.
00:55:15.131 - 00:55:51.365, Speaker A: There's something just weirdly delightful about them at auction. Here's another awesome small work. I kind of went crazy collecting Sophie Agora's work the other night. I just kind of also clicked www HTML I think if you press what is it? Is it W or I'm not sure if you have to click to amplify two times. So maybe that is the thing. So all to say, really interesting artist and here putting out a Halloween work and amplified interesting www. It's HTML which is interesting.
00:55:51.365 - 00:56:18.059, Speaker A: It's got a bit of a different dynamic to it in terms like it's a different format. I think it's HTML. So four gone so far. One going to can who are just looking at for 666 nice low edition. Rad artist. Looking forward to seeing more Zozo Flower Molecules. So new work by Zozo Flower Molecule.
00:56:18.059 - 00:56:55.971, Speaker A: I love it. It interesting. Beautiful and interesting. There's almost like a kind of a climax that comes or just like a narrative, let's say, kind of picks, picks up speed and then lets you go. Super interesting again. How could you be static art only when you see works like this? So I have, you know, grown with this scene. You know, people sometimes say, hey, as Runtune was saying, I've learned a ton.
00:56:55.971 - 00:57:17.705, Speaker A: I've learned from the scene a ton. It's really great. Again, we're kind of back to free market, you know, the free exchange of. And just like seeing stuff from all around the world. Now, Kayvon would argue that, okay, free exchange of ideas and everything. I would argue the market is key though, to that staying healthy. And that you would Zuozhou if Zuozhou didn't sell any work.
00:57:17.705 - 00:57:47.227, Speaker A: Put it this way. We see many artists when they stop selling, that's when they often trail off and disappear. Right? People who are selling a ton, do they stop making work? No, they keep making it. And I think that speaks for itself. And why do they keep making it? Well, they're getting a nice payday and they're going, holy. I might be able to live off this if I keep going here, right? You know, it's a real privilege to make art and get money for it. So it's one that shouldn't be or, you know, given up easily, you know, like.
00:57:47.227 - 00:58:14.823, Speaker A: So anyways, the Great Zozo here's n 1914, who we just had on the spaces. I think this is after Botero, Fernando Botero Echo por me. So after Made so nouve. It's new 1914. I was like making digital art from 2012, interestingly. And it shows. If you want to get this.
00:58:14.823 - 00:58:48.035, Speaker A: Using the trackpad on her laptop to do her work. It's not even a mouse. I was like, it kind of looks like it's made by a mouse. If I had to guess in the space that we did the trackpad on the laptop. How amazing is that? And I'm sure it just as I was painting with the mouse there on that paint program, which I should bookmark, you know, I'm sure it affects the work. And look at how fabulous this is, the development of the work. And I love this column here, this brown column kind of echoing the frame there.
00:58:48.035 - 00:59:20.305, Speaker A: Just fantastic work from New 1914. Here's a New mythsun by the myth with a wonderfully yellow background and almost a kid version of a Mistsun with the Mike Tyson tattoo and a different kind of eye there. Almost like the David Bowie with the different eyes there. Although these are different colors here. So very cool work. Now 70 tezos at auction and still some time on that. I have to say, I'm really just loving the fun that the myth is having here.
00:59:20.305 - 00:59:41.693, Speaker A: So here's myth, a myth, sneaker air myth. And they kind of look great, don't they? They kind of look great. Very interesting. 200 tezos sale. Nice work. Great scene, isn't it? Like, again, the creativity then gets, you know, 140 bucks for it. Like, you gotta love this scene.
00:59:41.693 - 00:59:57.795, Speaker A: Collector happy, artist happy. It wouldn't be the same for $4, you know, would it? I mean. So anyways, Denise, Denise Cormans. But true too. So cool. I think a digital drawing. Let's zoom in here.
00:59:57.795 - 01:00:23.253, Speaker A: So I have to say, I love the background color and these different kind of. It feels very digital, like a digital drawing. Something that was perhaps made on Procreate, if I had to venture a guess here, especially the quality, like the characteristics, shall we say, of the brushwork and everything. Really fun work here. That's by Denise. That's 5 Tezos edition of 10. Here's Yuri J.
01:00:23.253 - 01:00:51.749, Speaker A: Balmer. Now, as I was mentioning, sometimes Yuri J. Will release like five different works and then just with the same structure, as we'll see here, right? You see, it's the same structure and we're going to look at all of them. But before we do, I'm starting to bring artsy into the look. So we have Wade Guyton, right, well known contemporary artist. Here's a lithography, or this is lithography by Wade Guyton, 2024. So new work.
01:00:51.749 - 01:01:23.915, Speaker A: But check this out. So, okay, pretty cool. But look at this. What do you see? Oh, wow. It's like the same idea, right? It's like taking a structure and here it's like, you know, Wade Guyton is there. What's the original? In a sense, I guess it's lithography. Each one is its own iteration as its own work here, which kind of opens a very big, you know, question and door for me because so many of our artworks that we all have made, you can make like 50 different versions.
01:01:23.915 - 01:01:49.385, Speaker A: It opens a very interesting door. And I don't know, you know, I guess it depends on the work. And maybe that needs to be conceptualized from the outset because what does it mean if all of a sudden you Take old works and you start going nuts, you know, making 50 different versions. What does that do to the value of the original? Right. It does hurt it somewhat, I would think. Maybe Sometimes the remixes look better. So anyways, so a little bit of Wade Guyton.
01:01:49.385 - 01:02:04.297, Speaker A: Very cool lithography. So I'm kind of curious. I've done lithography. I'm wondering how this works, how. I'm still trying to figure out how you get like image transfer on lithography onto the rocks. It was explained to me about five times and I still don't understand. Understand.
01:02:04.297 - 01:02:55.915, Speaker A: I'll still have to return to Bebeka in. At. In Kreuzberg there at the big print shop or printing house or whatever it's called Media Place. So anyways, let's look at Yuri J's so edition of six forty Tezos. So again, you see all of these different variations on the structure here. And it's, you know, it's very much the nature, I would argue, of digital work in large respect that you can do these different versions, I guess, but not necessarily. I mean, as we saw with Wade Guyton, who often does work digitally in inkjet and whatnot, but reproduction, I guess he's using lithography to do different colors of probably this, you know, impression that is made on the stone that creates a certain print.
01:02:55.915 - 01:03:33.279, Speaker A: Right? Okay, we'll do different colors on this one. That's probably what's going on. So perhaps then just an interesting analogy between digital and physical. Now, interestingly, okay, I was going to say, is the structure different? Because we see almost these dragged pixels on the right, but they are still here. So really it's kind of like coloring book, right? It's like, okay, how can we. And it illustrates, as an artist, these kind of series, as you see with Wade Guyton, the really the infinite possibilities of how you can render a work. As any artist, you know, is working digitally.
01:03:33.279 - 01:04:03.205, Speaker A: We'll see. You can have like 50 different versions of that work while you're working on it, you could argue, right? Like, and then it becomes a very interesting question as an artist, this idea of judgment, like, why this and not this? And then you go, okay, well maybe this is more attractive. This is more beautiful. This is more poetic. But you know, it starts getting very subjective here. Which is the best? Is there a best? Right, so just interesting, interesting work, cool titles. The blood.
01:04:03.205 - 01:04:22.005, Speaker A: This is peepee universal looking. So this kind of looks like he was working with teeth here. And I feel like I kind of see some teeth. Look at the textures on here. Nice Work. And I feel like this started from teeth, but it looks like an abstract. So I don't know what's going on here.
01:04:22.005 - 01:04:32.901, Speaker A: And I don't know the Spanish. Vizcacha. El Escape, if I'm pronouncing that right. Edition of Five for Seven Tezos one gone. Good work. District 468. Picking one up.
01:04:32.901 - 01:04:49.335, Speaker A: Mumble boy. Habitat for Humans. Good title. And so another cool work here by humanboy. And as you see, great color here and everything that we've come to love. Combination of physical and digital collage by human boy. Going back and forth between mediums.
01:04:49.335 - 01:04:58.703, Speaker A: Huge file. 18 tazos edition of one. And here is World, my darling. This is Lorna Mills. And this was just transferred. Pretty cool. I love the.
01:04:58.703 - 01:05:19.759, Speaker A: Just nice and simple. Just. Again, it's the nature works that really I love. As you see here, it's just fire and then interesting green actually in the background. So Lorna Mills with the show, I believe at Palais in Paris, I think put on by Object one. So Lorna Mills having a bit of a moment. John.
01:05:19.759 - 01:05:35.623, Speaker A: Still life. So Tezo Ween, of course, well known for the Halloween or Sorry for the Windows works. And we've seen putting the orange basketball. That's hilarious. And the orange here, plain. Interesting. Using color as inspiration for subject matter.
01:05:35.623 - 01:05:56.269, Speaker A: That's not something you see every day. That's a pretty interesting move. And even the potential. I feel like there's something in literature that's analogous. I want to call it metonymy or something like this. Like, this is pretty unusual idea. Again, to restate it here.
01:05:56.269 - 01:06:18.875, Speaker A: It's worth restating. We're taking colors that are normally associated with Halloween and then we're taking that color and then using that as inspiration for. For subject matter and going, okay, what's normally orange? A basketball. An orange. A potted plant. And then putting that as subject matter. That is pretty darn interesting.
01:06:18.875 - 01:06:27.575, Speaker A: From John. And of course. So only 26 tazos, actually. Well, 145 additions. Wow. So John. And that's on secondary.
01:06:27.575 - 01:06:45.395, Speaker A: Sold out. Let's just see what primary was quickly. At 13 tezos. John just has a massive collector base there. So bringing in like 2,000 Tezos, you know, Pretty awesome. Here's our milk. And I better start to wrap up here because I had Photoshop open and that can cause problems.
01:06:45.395 - 01:06:54.783, Speaker A: Okay. R. Milk. Run, rabbit, run. Don't break the wall. Don't stop the fun. What I loved about this is it took like a Mario user, you know, this could be a screen from Mario.
01:06:54.783 - 01:07:21.355, Speaker A: And then seemed to extend it or at least maybe this is something you find on the Internet that has the whole thing tiled together. But seeing the tiny Mario, it's kind of recontextualizing the Mario game to a certain degree. Even if it's just taking, you know, something from the Internet. But I don't know what it is. It's pretty cool. From our milk. Bite by Bit Romantic dinner.
01:07:21.355 - 01:07:46.625, Speaker A: This is a different kind of software that we haven't seen before. So two instant artist 1.0 and as you see here, it's like a different brush. It's like every software is a different kind of brush. And here you see it. I mean you're literally getting different kinds of outputs here. You saw it in the Pixel software that Mech posted, right? I mean that's just going to create different kinds of work.
01:07:46.625 - 01:08:04.287, Speaker A: Just like a brush will create different brush strokes. So I love the subject here. Romantic dinner. One of one from Bite by Bit and that is 35 Tazos. Here's Eboy Art. So they have put their hat in the ring for who they are going for. I'm not sure if there's music here.
01:08:04.287 - 01:08:28.159, Speaker A: We will see. So brilliant Pixel artists here. As you see pioneers as Kiro has pointed out. Look at the flag. Simple but effective. And there with through the writing here, quite a good ad so to speak for from Eboy Arts. So cool Pixel artists there.
01:08:28.159 - 01:08:50.071, Speaker A: Muji Gallery today you are the art critic. So interesting. Kind of reminds you of is it side Hustle. Remember those little kind of architectural scenes and then you'd have like LB on the TV or whatever. So cool. Kind of an element of a gallery. Kind of broken here interestingly kind of adds some character actually.
01:08:50.071 - 01:09:10.217, Speaker A: Nice contrast actually. This kind of little broken area. Broken wall from what was maybe too perfect of a scene. Interesting cycling gradient there too. Addition of 8 and 2 gone. Here's Kappen the Maiden. So cool mix of static and dynamic pixels.
01:09:10.217 - 01:09:50.615, Speaker A: Of course the blood seemingly here is moving in a very kind of Kapn like illustration. And this beautiful kind of white and black rendering here of the maiden beheaded here you have in crazy writing 666. So a bit of a Halloween work here from Kappan and a couple from Mirror Kit angel reading Divine Text. So kind of using a bit of a zoom or something. Kind of a wild kind of work here by Merakit. There's a couple I think also Halloween works. This one also edition of 5 Nighttime Church Again playing with this kind of zoom so to speak.
01:09:50.615 - 01:10:16.811, Speaker A: So interesting effect here. Kind of a spooky effect part of 24 gifs series. Here's element Li with a much busier sort of work by Element Li than you'd normally see. Almost layering on top of each other different works. So keeping it new. Anti humanism city diagram and all this technology. People in high rise buildings, cars, you know, interesting piece.
01:10:16.811 - 01:10:39.315, Speaker A: Nice. You know, kind of more depth or more busy, shall we say dithering here on the top right to create some contrast. Brilliant work here. Annas abden. Happy Halloween Day 305. Beautiful and poetic here by Annis Abdon with a cat looking off into the fall. Here's Silva San 2's still need more glitch.
01:10:39.315 - 01:11:04.933, Speaker A: Don't know what the writing says. Cool. Just rich glitch ROM here as you see the head separating great colors on this one as well. 79 megs and 666 frames. And that is an open edition for 420. Here's John Cates with some glitch pixel art as you see here maybe as you see. So super interesting.
01:11:04.933 - 01:11:28.199, Speaker A: Again embracing these kind of JPEG like artifacts. Not sure if AI is involved here or not. Pretty interesting work. So kind of pixel art kind of not. And then classic kind of video game, you know, Treasure box. What treasures y'all found. So playing with the whole glitch western and this was transferred to other maybe collectors and artists.
01:11:28.199 - 01:11:49.091, Speaker A: That pinball guide W95. Really nice. Love the big chunky work here. Big work but still little pixels in there and here. But I love the size of this work and the simplicity of the just kind of large work. That's the pinball guy and that is sold for 10, 10 days. So pretty reasonable.
01:11:49.091 - 01:12:11.661, Speaker A: Here's max capacity skyscraping and this is 640 by 480 analog VHS video glitch hardware digitally post processed and edition of 69. Is this new is the question. 10-30-2024. Wow. And just transferred probably to previous collectors. Pretty cool. So again landscapes and analog video glitch just going wonderfully together.
01:12:11.661 - 01:12:52.345, Speaker A: Here is Ex Mortal longview edition of 15 and already sold out at 17 tezos. So ex mortal doing awesome cool landscape here as you see almost a TV snow within what looks like an island in Greece or something, but could be anywhere. Beautiful work by exmortal and here's the work by August Ground. Good glitch witch. So kind of a Halloween work. Kind of spooky. So interesting, interesting, interesting.
01:12:52.345 - 01:13:13.043, Speaker A: From August Ground open edition three tazos celebrating Halloween here. Good glitch witch. So cool work. And here is Libroblock which we saw. Which we saw in the community as well. So fun. You hear the laughing there.
01:13:13.043 - 01:13:28.357, Speaker A: Fun Halloween work. I love the change in key there, by the way. Or in the note. The changing note. Nice music there too. Nice textures. And here is a GLB morenicle pumpkin 3.0.
01:13:28.357 - 01:13:48.237, Speaker A: So absurd deity. There is another. I guess there's a ton of GLBs out there. Pretty nice one though. And it is quite interesting to see, you know. And again then you zero out and you see the narrative, the broken keyboard, the monster drink, the hypodermics and everything. So hilarious.
01:13:48.237 - 01:14:12.680, Speaker A: Punk pumpkin with an N 3.0. And here is no hygiene on manifold. Interestingly so bringing the experimental pixel art here. Sorry, experimental AI work here. As you can see, almost like an image in an image. This is on ETH and one of one and 0.025 ETH is the price.
01:14:12.680 - 01:14:33.887, Speaker A: And here's another one for 0.03 with some cats. And then you see one of the angels in the background. So again, just totally wild AI work here. Crazy title. Acac Venta Cutting Daisy. So again, starting with a digital painting and then bringing it into AI Cutting Daisy.
01:14:33.887 - 01:15:05.063, Speaker A: AI. Super interesting. Right? Like in a sense what we're seeing here is with like multiple versions, we're seeing the exploration of the process and kind of unpacking the process and what it means like when you start minting the painting version. And then this like it raises a whole bunch of questions, interesting conceptual question that's being asked here. That's by venta edition of one and both are edition of ones. This is 30 tazos for the paint. Not.
01:15:05.063 - 01:15:25.225, Speaker A: Yeah, 30 tezos. I think for the AI digital painting is 30. This is 30 tazos. This. I'm not sure if they might come together. I'm not sure though you'd have to check. Here is keyload Z and I think we saw them in the comments or in the.
01:15:25.225 - 01:15:40.333, Speaker A: In the community. Anyways, nice work. Pretty interesting mark making here. Nice size. And again we're getting these rough pixels. A lot of variation on pixelation that we're seeing. I'm seeing it too in my own work.
01:15:40.333 - 01:15:56.661, Speaker A: And you just got to love this sort of stuff. It's got an interesting digital seance. One edition of one at auction for 25 tazos. Here's Skomra Dreams. Almost looks like a dinosaur here. So cool. AI work.
01:15:56.661 - 01:16:10.285, Speaker A: Stable diffusion and diffusers. Textual inversion. Addition of 10 for 7 tazos. And quite a few sold. Oh, so actually selling at three tazos. Observe Deity picking up two awesomely. And here's another one posted on X.
01:16:10.285 - 01:16:28.735, Speaker A: And gotta love this kind of margin here, this framing. And almost looking like painted here in here. So looking very painterly. And here's Shirley Preston, also picked up by absurd deity for 15 tezos. Nice work. The winter always makes the art sad. Kind of a fun work here by Shirley Preston.
01:16:28.735 - 01:16:48.851, Speaker A: Kind of combination of AI and what looks like some kind of dithered pixelation in the frame there. Nice work. And here is, I think black square 93 is the account. Sunsets at the city's outskirts. Kind of looks like an AI work, doesn't it? Nice painting. Interesting. Kind of looks like AI animation.
01:16:48.851 - 01:17:06.295, Speaker A: Nice piece. And here is Denise Sanchez. A bit off the radar, but I'm happy to share one of my new pieces. So very nice physical here as we move into the physical section. Nice abstract. Here is Naked Galena, Memory of murder, edition of 20. And that came out just yesterday.
01:17:06.295 - 01:17:19.717, Speaker A: So cool painting here. And oil on paper. And here is awesomely, HP Love Bucks. Work in progress. Soft Power oil on canvas. Interesting title. And here, a monster truck painting.
01:17:19.717 - 01:17:38.785, Speaker A: Pretty rad. Kind of love that. Here's bologna and sandwich glass. Bologna sandwich glass. Still have these window corner moments, so I assume that's the artist. So just kind of wild work using solitaire. Another interesting work, garden sequence 2008.
01:17:38.785 - 01:17:53.167, Speaker A: 24, acrylic on canvas by Saner. So playing with these kind of. So this is acrylic on canvas. Let's see if we can zoom in a little bit, even look at the frame. Normally, I don't like it when the frame is painted. Like, sometimes people paint it black. I'm not generally a fan of that.
01:17:53.167 - 01:18:16.425, Speaker A: I've had gallery. The first place I ever showed it was like I had to pay 30 bucks. I was like, if not now, I'll never, ever show my work. And he wanted me to paint the edges of the paintings black. And I was like, no way. I was like, I put my foot down on that one. He relented, luckily, because that would have been a dilemma for me at the time.
01:18:16.425 - 01:18:36.143, Speaker A: So anyways, look at this. Look at the pixelation. I'm always impressed at how crisp people can get their squares. It's kind of easier said than done. You have to be pretty careful painting a lot of it's not as easy as it looks to do all that depending on your. Maybe there's tricks to the trade, though, that I don't know about. That look like the artists are Ricardo DiCaro.
01:18:36.143 - 01:18:53.891, Speaker A: The new humor, as I like to call it. Thank you, God, for making Me. And then this wild kind of work here where I have no idea what's going on. This is posted by. It's not gallery. The sensational account on Instagram, Wade Guyton. Again, this was just.
01:18:53.891 - 01:19:03.779, Speaker A: I'm starting to get. Oh, this is from 2013. I'm starting to get notifications put on from artsy. And so I didn't realize. I thought this was a new one. So zeitnung. So images for.
01:19:03.779 - 01:19:19.895, Speaker A: Or Zeitnung. What is zeichnung again? I should really. I totally know this word for long images. Maybe printing. I'm trying to remember pages 53 and 54. It's kind of a weird work here. I thought it was new, which is why I was posting it.
01:19:19.895 - 01:19:40.531, Speaker A: I really love this series, though. Or like this whole. Weirdly, it looks like a photo of the series, but I love this series where he would print on one, like Apple ad. On one ad. And then like something completely unrelated, putting the paper back in the printer. One of my. Yeah, I thought that was brilliant.
01:19:40.531 - 01:20:04.225, Speaker A: And you kind of see the same thing here. Here is Richard Prince. Untitled portrait, 2024, inkjet on canvas. And we saw this series from, like, I want to say 10 years ago. And so still making new ones, if I understand artsy correctly. Inkjet on canvas. You see the Richard Prince comment here and it does make you wonder.
01:20:04.225 - 01:20:22.103, Speaker A: I'm not sure if he's altering the work or not. Like the. Especially you see the C. That's almost a hint there. That doesn't look like a normal C, but maybe I'm wrong. So interesting, interesting controversial series. Here's Nugget Brain.
01:20:22.103 - 01:20:38.257, Speaker A: Look at this. Just this great artist here. And like, you see the sculpture, making sculptures, painting them hilariously. This is highlighted by Munchies Art Club. So we've seen some of these before. Just brilliant. And look at the art fair booth.
01:20:38.257 - 01:20:57.165, Speaker A: Like, how much fun is this? Who wouldn't love that? I. And I think I've started the show actually with these ristorante. One of the very few physicals I've started the show with about 100 episodes ago. So just one of my favorite artists. Just makes it look so easy too. You got to love the subject matter. Just fun.
01:20:57.165 - 01:21:11.365, Speaker A: And here's Moto583, Moto Hero. So again, some wild kind of surreal drawing here. And maybe a fragment. Yeah. And that is your show, my friends. Thank you for joining me. I hope you enjoyed it.
01:21:11.365 - 01:21:16.565, Speaker A: I am still trying to shorten these shows. It is a struggle. I hope you have a great weekend. Until next time. Take care.
