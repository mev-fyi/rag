00:00:32.854 - 00:01:15.764, Speaker A: Her style is instantly recognizable. If you've shopped for art on the Tezos blockchain, you've likely come across her work. Today we're going to welcome Flora Marquez, an artist based out of Cordoba, Argentina, to discuss art, NFTs and what Flora has planned in the coming weeks and months ahead. Artist Journal, April 26, 2023. Broadcasting live to the world from Berlin and New York City on rug radio via Twitter spaces. My name is Adrian Pokebelli and we welcome back co host, artist and conversationalist to the show, Roon Toon. Roon, how is your week going?
00:01:16.664 - 00:01:21.564, Speaker B: It's been going good. Yeah, it's been a. It's been a very socially active week.
00:01:22.184 - 00:01:28.644, Speaker A: Oh, do tell. What is the latest in New York City? I imagine the weather is better than it is out here in Berlin.
00:01:29.844 - 00:02:04.548, Speaker B: Maybe it's still a little brisk, which I actually appreciate. I like to ride my bike, so it keeps me from getting too sweaty whenever I'm out and about. But, you know, people are starting to come out from under the rocks of hibernation and, you know, went to a few parties. Actually, one of my friends, he was born and raised. Brooklyn Boy has just moved to Florida, and he had his last day last week, so there was a very, very big party for him and it was a lot of fun. I stayed out till the late hours of the morning.
00:02:04.716 - 00:02:09.652, Speaker A: Another New Yorker going to Florida. Yep. Is that a bit of a trend out in your.
00:02:09.708 - 00:02:19.824, Speaker B: It is, it is, yeah. Ever since I got here about eight years ago, it's. It's something I've noticed. It's almost like the place that old New Yorkers retire to.
00:02:20.444 - 00:03:02.406, Speaker A: Well, I could imagine. And, like, there's no income tax, at least on the state level, from what I understand over there. Like, I mean, yeah, that must be a draw, especially with remote work, you know? So, yeah, I mean, here, I mean, it feels like, you know, the winter air is still here. We've had a few days where it's been kind of nice out, you know, luckily on the weekend, actually, it kind of felt like spring. But, man, it's cool out there these days right now, so hopefully that turns around. And so anyways, Laura, I'm so thrilled that you agreed to come on the show. You're one of the first artists I've seen, you know, when I started collecting and who really turned my head with all your stamps and everything.
00:03:02.406 - 00:03:05.574, Speaker A: Anyway, Flora, how are you doing? You're calling from Argentina.
00:03:05.694 - 00:03:08.126, Speaker C: Hello, everyone. How are you?
00:03:08.270 - 00:03:09.194, Speaker A: It's great.
00:03:10.614 - 00:03:13.114, Speaker C: Nice to meet you. I'm so excited to be here?
00:03:13.214 - 00:03:29.534, Speaker A: Well yeah, I mean the feeling is mutual and I'm sure with Rune tune as well there. So Flora, tell us how are things going? And you know, just to get us started here, I guess. How is your day today, just out of curiosity?
00:03:29.994 - 00:04:04.824, Speaker C: Well, my day today is I just drink my coffee and I'm listening to you guys, I'm talking to you. And after this I'm going to do my daily drawing. I try every day to do it like early, but not every day happens that. So today I'm going to do it early and then I have to work. I do freelance work as a graphic designer. Then I going to visit my mother and my grandmother. Common things.
00:04:04.984 - 00:04:19.724, Speaker A: It sounds great. And I mean there's so many things I already want to ask you. I mean whether it's state of Argentina and its inflation. But one more actually, give us a quick update. Like what is that like? I mean, I assume it affects you.
00:04:19.884 - 00:04:40.348, Speaker C: We in Argentina, we are so used to inflation. I think I was born in inflation. I don't know, a reality without inflation. You know, we have, our peso is so devaluated and everything is so expensive and everything is so impossible to do. It's really difficult here.
00:04:40.476 - 00:05:04.872, Speaker A: Is that how you, like, I noticed I talked to Buzia just over Tex, who's also out of Argentina a few months ago. And is that how you got into, you know, NFTs and because people usually start with crypto and it seems like Argentinians, you know, start with all the inflation. It's a real, you know, opt out or a real way of solving the inflation issue, at least somewhat.
00:05:05.068 - 00:06:01.440, Speaker C: Yes, it is. Because in some way you're doing some income in a currency that already is more valuable than your country currency. Our argentine peso is so low. So if you gain something in USDT or anything, you're going to be able to unleash. In my case last year I was able to save some money that it was something impossible for me to do the previous year. Or for example, in my case I was able to buy an iPad on my computer and some things that in my head it was even possible to do the previous years. It's really, really expensive to afford an iPad or something like that.
00:06:01.552 - 00:06:11.000, Speaker A: Well, absolutely. And what I wonder is like in Argentina, do they let you in a sense buy crypto or do they try and keep you out of crypto?
00:06:11.112 - 00:06:15.952, Speaker C: No, it's like something that. It's out of the law.
00:06:16.128 - 00:06:17.624, Speaker A: Yeah, like it's illegal yet.
00:06:17.744 - 00:06:18.184, Speaker C: Yes.
00:06:18.264 - 00:06:23.564, Speaker A: To buy it, to put your pesos into crypto. But if you just go ahead.
00:06:24.984 - 00:06:59.616, Speaker C: We can't buy dollars. We have an amount of dollars that we can buy every month. We are not allowed to buy dollars. So you have to have pesos and you have to buy dollars in places that are illegal, you know. So crypto is at this moment is like in a blind spot, I think, because government didn't do anything yet, but I think it's going to be some. They are going to do something because a lot of people is buying or selling dollars through that way.
00:06:59.760 - 00:07:01.576, Speaker A: Yeah, the black market, I mean.
00:07:01.640 - 00:07:02.096, Speaker C: Yes.
00:07:02.200 - 00:07:23.462, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, the challenges you must face. I mean, and with, if it's, you know, not legal to buy dollars, you could just imagine that they want to, you know, shut down crypto. It's interesting. They haven't yet, though, so that is interesting not to get distracted by the finances because we could literally talk for an hour about that and put probably be fascinating at least.
00:07:23.518 - 00:07:30.470, Speaker C: And I have no idea on finances. I'm talking without knowing anything. So. Yeah, yeah, no, change the subject.
00:07:30.622 - 00:07:43.790, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. Will do. Because actually, and I very excited to ask you a few questions, say, on the daily drawing you mentioned, you do it in the morning. I think that's really interesting, actually. As a matter of fact, I kind of went to bed. I had a good night's sleep.
00:07:43.790 - 00:07:52.234, Speaker A: But I woke up at five today and I found I did a lot more art. And is that kind of your secret weapon like you mentioned? You like to do it in the morning?
00:07:52.734 - 00:08:25.772, Speaker C: No, no, I don't have any secret weapon. I try to do it in the morning, but sometimes it's 1158. And I didn't finish the daily drawing and I have to do it in the last minutes of the day. And it's really stressing because I want to mint it in the. In the same day. You know, I don't want to accumulate the drawings. I just want to draw it and mint it in the same day.
00:08:25.772 - 00:08:33.556, Speaker C: So, yes, I try to do in the morning, so in that way I will be relaxed in the rest of the day.
00:08:33.660 - 00:08:37.028, Speaker B: What was the original inspiration to do the daily drawing?
00:08:37.116 - 00:09:15.658, Speaker C: Well, the thing is that I have, I have an uncle and he's a philosopher and he's a really interesting person. And he once told me about this ten years before, it was 2013, I think, when we met. And he told me about this greek artist that had this phrase, nulla dies sine linea. That means that every day you have to do something. Whatever you do, if you write, if, if you. You draw every day, you have to do something. About this, because in that way, you will always be better if you exercise.
00:09:15.658 - 00:09:49.138, Speaker C: And it hasn't, it doesn't have to be something perfect. I always have that in mind. It doesn't have to be something perfect. You have to do what you have to do. And what I am going to do today, it will be different that tomorrow. And I think that's, that's really, really interesting to, to look what you're capable of doing every single day. And you are going to improve and you're going to be, you're going to have different ideas and you are going to evolve.
00:09:49.226 - 00:10:17.408, Speaker B: I think that's such a powerful idea to, I'm someone who I love, I love hearing about just different ways of thinking that kind of open up doors for, you know, artistic liberation. And that sounds like that gave you the type of philosophy and thinking that you needed to kind of venture onto this path. Do you remember the name of the greek philosopher your uncle was talking about?
00:10:17.576 - 00:10:20.040, Speaker C: Yes, he was. Apeles.
00:10:20.112 - 00:10:21.048, Speaker A: Ah, got you.
00:10:21.096 - 00:10:21.936, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:10:22.120 - 00:10:25.984, Speaker A: Apelles Apuleius, is it? Maybe.
00:10:26.064 - 00:10:26.526, Speaker C: Yes.
00:10:26.640 - 00:10:29.650, Speaker A: Was he the person that wrote the golden ass?
00:10:29.842 - 00:10:30.970, Speaker C: I don't have.
00:10:31.082 - 00:10:32.090, Speaker D: I don't have any.
00:10:32.242 - 00:11:04.466, Speaker A: Let me look. Actually, I'm kind of curious. While I'm doing that, though, one of the things I love about, because I think a lot of us feel, okay, we've kind of heard it, you start your own little business and you should do something every day. But I think what's kind of special about what you're doing is you're finishing. Because I can make a few lines on my iPad and then kind of walk away and say, look, I did something every day and it doesn't actually add up. But when you're forced to finish, there's nothing like a deadline, right?
00:11:04.530 - 00:12:20.798, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's, I think it's great how we, the artists or the people that do what we do have different ways of creating. I love to see how my friends, for instance, I have a lot of friends that are artists that they create in a different and in a very different way that I create. They took a lot of time in one piece, and they add details and they add lines and they are days and days adding and doing things in one piece. And I think that's amazing. And I think that's so interesting and that's so different from the way that I create because I have not, that, I am not that patient. I have days in which I feel that way and I create that way, you know? But in my daily, my daily life, I like to create and give away. I like to do and relive, you know, and I think that we create in such different ways, and that's the exciting and the nice thing about art, the different ways that we create.
00:12:20.966 - 00:12:38.734, Speaker A: I love it. It's also, as an artist, sometimes you get kind of bored with your work. Like, I've been there where it's like. And it's total torture. I used to spend two years on two paintings, and I did that for, like, three years, and I made six paintings. Yeah. So, and, like, I'll never forget that.
00:12:38.734 - 00:12:50.224, Speaker A: Like, what I call a Copernican revolution in my head when I said, screw it, I'm going to make one painting tonight. And then I kind of like that painting, you know, more than the ones I was working a year on, you know?
00:12:50.264 - 00:13:03.776, Speaker C: Yeah, but you get bored the same way I get bored doing one different drawing every day, and I get bored of myself, too. So we, we are like, that's the thing about artists. We get bored.
00:13:03.920 - 00:13:33.030, Speaker B: Something that I've done well, something I still do, but a practice that I developed over the years is that it's always good to be working on at least three art projects at a time. And jumping between the different three can sometimes help you see what one is worth putting time into. Sometimes you don't even have to, like, understand what's worth putting time into. You just want to work on something more than, you know, another thing, and then things happen and art gets made.
00:13:33.142 - 00:13:34.510, Speaker C: Of course, yes.
00:13:34.662 - 00:13:43.806, Speaker B: So when you do your daily drawings, I mean, are you working on, because you have a lot of different collections. You have the stamp collection, you have your, you know, your. Your stuff on foundation, your stuff on object?
00:13:43.910 - 00:13:44.594, Speaker C: Yes.
00:13:44.974 - 00:13:48.034, Speaker B: Are you usually working on multiple projects at a time?
00:13:48.374 - 00:14:05.674, Speaker C: Yes. Yes. I have my comic diary. It's an autobiographical comic that I'm doing since 2020. I do that while I'm doing other things. I'm doing this project of daily drawings. I wanted to do some.
00:14:05.674 - 00:14:29.576, Speaker C: Some things to mint in foundation that I did. What else? Yes. I'm always trying. I am always thinking about new projects. I always get bored, and I always want to do something else. But something that I learned was that we don't have to quit if you. If you get bored, sometimes you, you have to quit and you have to leave that project to be free.
00:14:29.576 - 00:14:56.364, Speaker C: But sometimes, sometimes you have to force yourself to finish it, because if not, you're always starting new things. And I don't know, I love to start unfinished things. And not always, it's something easy to do, but I try to exercise that and I want to accomplish that. I want to finish things. So.
00:14:56.524 - 00:15:15.236, Speaker A: Yes, well, it's incredibly important. I remember the first guest we had on here was rare. And he was talking about self discipline. And it's really hard. Like, I mean, I imagine it's hard for you at this point. Maybe on a certain level. Maybe you're bored with your daily drawing on a certain level, because you've been doing it incredibly.
00:15:15.236 - 00:15:30.734, Speaker A: I think you've made deadline. I mean, you could be in the news business, Flora, you've made your deadline for. I mean, we're on April 26. Like, have you ever missed your deadline? And how about that project? I mean, there must be days where it must be. I think I've seen you tweet about that. Where it's difficult.
00:15:31.194 - 00:16:02.580, Speaker C: Yes. There were days that I was like, oh my God, why? Why I'm doing. Why I'm doing this to me, I'm forcing myself to do something that I don't want to do today. But I know that that idea is something that happens that particular day and the day after, I will be okay with that. I think that it's really important to have this discipline. Yes, because I don't have discipline in other. In other areas of my life.
00:16:02.580 - 00:16:11.420, Speaker C: You know, I don't have discipline in anything. I don't work out, I don't. I don't eat well, I don't have discipline.
00:16:11.492 - 00:16:12.384, Speaker A: True artists.
00:16:13.284 - 00:17:12.340, Speaker C: And yesterday I was saying to myself, if I'm able to do one drawing per day, I have four months of doing this. Why can workout 15 minutes a day? Why is it so difficult for me to eat well? Why is it so difficult for me to do anything? Well, I don't know, but I think discipline is something that you exercise also. It's nice to start with something little or with big baby steps. You know, for example, I used to say, well, today I'm going to draw a half an hour a day. I'm going to read something I want. I always try to do little things that changed my day. So every day is more reach of meaning, you know, because if you don't force yourself to do those things, we are with our digital devices every day.
00:17:12.340 - 00:17:42.314, Speaker C: In my case, I have the cell phone, I have the tablet, I have the computer. Everything is turned on. And I. Sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy because I. All the day I'm all with my eyes in front of a screen. So if I don't have the discipline of saying well to today I'm going to go to sleep. But before that I'm going to read a book or I'm going to, I don't know, meditate.
00:17:42.314 - 00:18:09.830, Speaker C: I don't know, anything that changed that way of living that we all have been into these last few years because of the pandemic or whatever, we are so much in the, in the digital world. So I think it's really important to force yourself to do things that change that because otherwise we, we are becoming robots. I don't know.
00:18:09.942 - 00:18:57.754, Speaker A: Well, screen addicts too. Yeah. And, you know, I have a hack for the gym, by the way. Like what? I always found it hard to go to the gym, but, and maybe this doesn't work for other people, but, you know, luckily I go to classes, you know, like of, there's like weight classes and like cardio at the local gyms here. And luckily in Berlin they actually play good music in the. So it's almost like going to the club, but really you're just going for a workout anyways, classes, because you have 20 other people there that are kind of looking over your shoulder and you don't want to disappoint everyone, you know. So, yeah, your ego is on the line a little bit, so it kind of forces you, because if I go by myself, I will, you know, do five push ups, pat myself on the back and congratulate myself for actually doing that.
00:18:57.754 - 00:19:20.794, Speaker A: And then off I go to, you know, drink a beer. Right? So. And as far as reading, and actually I looked up Appuleius. It is the golden ass. That's actually, I mean, the risque title there. It's the first novel, actually, it's considered, I think it was around 200 AD, a Greek in the roman empire, as far as I remember. So a little on Appuleus there.
00:19:20.794 - 00:19:58.910, Speaker A: So anyway, so welcome everybody who has joined us here, and look at this all star cast again. And there's mech TXT Edge Q, Rosatio, Martin, Joe and Kant has joined us on stage, our international program here. There's Doctor version, Rennie Fish, big shout out, retro Manny who we had the great pixel art show and on and on. So anyways, thank you everybody for coming. And if you want to come hang out with Flora on stage here and ask her a question, by all means, request to speak and we will bring you on stage. I may prank a few people along the way and send you an invite. Kant, how are you doing? You're in Delhi, I believe.
00:19:59.022 - 00:19:59.270, Speaker C: Hey.
00:19:59.302 - 00:20:23.724, Speaker E: Hello. Flora Ali Minas. Hope you're doing great. Yes, from the new lady. Wonderful. Everything is good. I had one quick point to add when we were talking about the discipline, I think it should, I should share something, I mean, my own experience with the discipline, artistic discipline or how we keep ourselves in, you know, certain limits or how we set some kind of rules for us.
00:20:23.724 - 00:21:26.972, Speaker E: And it's always better because since we are a freelancer, in a way, you know, technically we are freelancers and we do not, I mean, we are our own boss, so we do not have anyone to answer. So this could actually, sometimes it could become very lazy as well. So we might push the work very further away to, I mean, the deadline or the, the imaginary deadline we have. So it's always better to set some kind of deadline and trying to stick to them. So, I mean, within a certain time the project is finished. And for me, what I do, because at the same time I work at least on three projects, three different projects, because if I'm working on some like one project only and I got so involved in it, I may get kind of bored out of it also. And because when we are putting ourselves so into one theme, so it might become kind of sometimes lull, you might get bored and you want some rest and you're taking rest from one project, actually, you can save your time and give it to the another project.
00:21:26.972 - 00:21:44.254, Speaker E: So for me at one go, I work on three projects so I can use my complete energy, like 24, 24 hours in 24 hours I used in better manner and I set the deadlines as well. This was something I thought that this is very relevant and I should share it with others.
00:21:44.374 - 00:22:29.186, Speaker A: I totally agree with you and I'm so glad you shared that. And I find it's really hard to do though. And I think it's so important. Again, it's all back to self discipline, right? Because put it this way, when I'm, you know, art can always be the thing that slides in your day. You know, you have to send this letter out, you have to pay this bill, you have to meet this person. But so often I think we make excuses for the art, like, oh, if anything can slide, it'll be the art. So I just think it's, that's another thing I just love about what you're doing here, Flora, with this daily drawing, because I, I understand it's not easy because you're trying to also maintain a certain quality control, right? And if you're there at 11:55 p.m.
00:22:29.186 - 00:22:53.274, Speaker A: And you got to make deadlines, it's like a newspaper, right? And when you're saying like, what have I done? I totally could relate with doing this YouTube show. Sometimes you're just like, oh my God, you know, what would happen if I had those mornings again? So anyways, Flora, I'm curious. You said you were able to buy an iPad. How has that changed how you work? What were you working on before?
00:22:53.574 - 00:23:36.570, Speaker C: Well, it was something really life changing because, well, I was working with another tablet, digital tablet. But those that you connect with the computer, and I am a person that goes a lot to other places. I. Not so much in my home. So for me, having the something that I have that I can bring with me, it's really practical. I don't know, it was really life changing because when I had the other device, the tablet that you connect with the computer, I didn't use it a lot. So I draw a lot in journals and paper.
00:23:36.570 - 00:24:17.232, Speaker C: I was really analogic artist. Now I'm creating a lot of digital art, but I also want to keep my journals and my sketchbooks because I think you use the brain differently when you draw on digital than when you do when you draw in paper. And it's something really interesting to explore that change. And yes, I try to use both types of drawings, but do you prefer.
00:24:17.288 - 00:24:21.776, Speaker B: One or the other? Do you prefer one or the other digital or just drawing on paper?
00:24:21.840 - 00:24:40.136, Speaker C: I love both because of different things. I prefer drawing on paper because it reminds me my childhood. It's something that I. It's like a thread that connects me directly with my. My childhood. I don't know if I'm saying this. Well, I'm having this.
00:24:40.240 - 00:24:59.444, Speaker A: Yeah, no, it is. Makes perfect sense. Like, why do you draw? Because your style is very defined. I almost want to call it, and it seems to come again. I always get this sense of like this 1890s puppet show kind of vibe to it, you know? So where is this all coming from?
00:24:59.524 - 00:25:20.068, Speaker C: When I was. Well, I told you this before, I'm a big fan of artist journal. And when I. You always said, you always compare my drawings with punk jolly. And I never. So that I never watched that show. And it was amazing for me to google it and to find out that it really looks like that style.
00:25:20.068 - 00:25:44.890, Speaker C: And I think that's amazing how something that you never saw, you never watch, or you never saw can be similar to something that you're doing. I don't know. I guess my style is a mixture of things. I think that I love to consume. I love to watch dark things. I like the horror movies. I like reading a lot of science fiction.
00:25:44.890 - 00:26:08.154, Speaker C: I like carnivals. I like costumes. I like fashion. I like. I think that mixture is what my style is about. Without realizing because I don't do it, like, on purpose. I, like, I create, and I think everything that I read and I watch and I see everything is, like in a mixer.
00:26:08.154 - 00:26:14.254, Speaker C: And then I create something that. It's, like, a mixture of all of those elements.
00:26:14.834 - 00:26:37.168, Speaker A: Well, beautifully put. It's almost like you're tuning into a kind of archetype, you know, like these. And it's also. There's something very theatrical. I mean, my grandma passed away now was a costume designer at the theater, you know, at the university in the middle of Canada, the University of Saskatchewan. She did Shakespeare on the Saskatchewan. And so it.
00:26:37.168 - 00:26:41.444, Speaker A: It really evokes that as well, just this theatricality.
00:26:42.024 - 00:26:43.724, Speaker C: Yes, that was.
00:26:44.144 - 00:26:44.648, Speaker A: Go ahead.
00:26:44.696 - 00:27:12.656, Speaker C: Sorry. That was so lovely. When I heard that about your grandmother in an artist's journal, actually, I studied fashion design, but I. My dream in the past. In my past years, when I was a teenager, when I was, like, a young adult, I wanted to be a custom designer. I love customs, so that's really nice to hear.
00:27:12.840 - 00:27:31.910, Speaker A: That is hilarious. I think my mom's gonna be listening to this. Let me just check if Lorraine is in the crowd. Bring Lorraine up on stage. No, I don't see Lorraine, but I see hastrubal waffle and a whole bunch of awesome people. MVP. So if anybody wants to join the conversation with Flora, she's got a nice crowd here.
00:27:31.910 - 00:27:43.354, Speaker A: Feel free to come on stage. You know, practice your public speaking, hang out with Flora, ask her some interesting questions. One more before maybe I turn it over to runetune. Are you using procreate flora?
00:27:43.974 - 00:27:46.994, Speaker C: Yes. Yes. It's magical.
00:27:47.294 - 00:27:48.354, Speaker A: It really is.
00:27:48.654 - 00:27:50.600, Speaker C: Yes. It's amazing.
00:27:50.742 - 00:28:00.276, Speaker A: And do you even bother with other. With other. I mean, you're. No, yeah, I know what you mean. You know? Yeah, I'm trying to.
00:28:00.300 - 00:28:06.384, Speaker C: I have a lot of things to explore, so I'm just in procreate right now.
00:28:06.684 - 00:28:19.044, Speaker A: It really is all about those brushes, too. And I use the word brush very loosely, whether it's a graphite pencil or, you know, whatever the case may be. But those textures. We're back to textures again. Yes.
00:28:20.024 - 00:29:24.118, Speaker C: I wanted to tell you something that you always say that you like in my drawings. You like those blurry lines that I. That's something that I wanted to do with this drawing, these daily drawings, because I am doing them digitally, but I wanted them to be like, there's something that I hate about digital art. It's like you can erase so easily, and you cannot see the mistakes. And that's something that I love about paper, that you have those marks when you erase. So I use a lot the finger tool in procreate, that finger that you can use and you can, like, you can erase, but you, you don't erase like with the eraser because you can see what you were doing before. So I think that's something that I like about these drawings is like, you can tell when I had some mistakes or when I had trouble with some parts.
00:29:24.118 - 00:29:40.022, Speaker C: For example, the hands or the feet. I usually have trouble with those parts. And you can tell because it's some blurry lines there. So I like to leave them there so you can see it, you know.
00:29:40.078 - 00:30:11.486, Speaker A: From a technical level. That was my favorite part that actually drew me in the most. It was this idea of embracing the mistakes, you know, a Warhol idea, and also this kind of, you know, modern art idea, which sometimes we, I think Picasso was definitely, and we could even argue, maybe the impressionists, a little bit of leaving the trail of how the work was made. Right. And. And there's something actually just beautiful. I mean, it adds this element and a real aesthetic, you know, sense like.
00:30:11.486 - 00:30:14.274, Speaker A: I mean, it really adds to the work, doesn't it?
00:30:14.774 - 00:30:37.444, Speaker C: Yes. Yes. I think that's really important to embrace the mistake. And that's. I think that's something that really defines my, my way of creating because I. I've never been afraid of showing where I had mistakes. I love that and I love to show that in my art.
00:30:37.444 - 00:30:56.304, Speaker C: I don't want it to be perfect. I want it to be something personal and something that has personality. And I think that mistakes are so personal that they are key elements in my way of. Of creating things.
00:30:56.604 - 00:31:14.124, Speaker A: Well, beautifully put. And they create texture too. So anyways, rune tune, do you have any questions for Flora and everybody? You're welcome. Welcome to come up on stage. Just make a request and get some time with Flora Marquez. Kind of. Who knows the next time that'll happen for you.
00:31:14.124 - 00:31:17.732, Speaker A: So a beautiful opportunity here. So go for it.
00:31:17.748 - 00:31:28.396, Speaker B: Rune tune. Something I always like hearing from artists is what was your journey into nfts and digital art? How did you find yourself minting artwork?
00:31:28.580 - 00:31:57.574, Speaker C: Well, it was all thanks to my friend Ornardo Rodriguez. She's here with us. She was the person in charge of knocking on my door and say, what do you know about nfts? Do you want to know about nfts? And this was on August 3. And on August 4. August I was minting. I was so anxious about it. And she taught me about everything I needed to know at the moment.
00:31:57.574 - 00:32:09.090, Speaker C: She was a great teacher and I love her. She's a really good friend and a great artist, and you should know her. And she's an OG in tezos also.
00:32:09.162 - 00:32:16.196, Speaker A: So I have actually just invited her to speak if she wants to come up. So that would be a classic moment. Sorry, Rintune.
00:32:16.260 - 00:32:25.028, Speaker B: And then, you know, I also like to hear from artists, like, what was your journey into art? What got you wanting to do your own drawings and who inspired you?
00:32:25.156 - 00:32:58.332, Speaker C: Well, I think my journey as an artist is like, join. It's like all together with my life. I cannot separate both things. I think that creating art for me was a way of experimenting. As children, we draw as a way of communicating because we don't speak. But then when we start speaking, we stop drawing. But in my case, I think speaking I wasn't so communicative.
00:32:58.332 - 00:33:47.322, Speaker C: I had a lot of issues with communicating what was happening to me when I was a teenager. I think art and drawing was my way of making this kind of catharsis, I think. And it helped me a lot socially and psychologically. And I think it was more like therapy. My artistic way was more like naturally, because I was doing that because I had to. But now I consider myself like an illustrator or an artist. But when I was 26, 27 years old, I was like, just doing what I had to do to make myself more comfortable with my life.
00:33:47.322 - 00:33:48.314, Speaker C: I don't know.
00:33:48.434 - 00:34:02.960, Speaker B: Yeah, I think art serves that purpose for a lot of people. I know a lot of my friends do it for therapeutic reasons. And for me too, I do it just as something to kind of like, keep my mind going in a singular direction, you know?
00:34:02.992 - 00:34:04.280, Speaker C: Yes, of course.
00:34:04.432 - 00:34:17.632, Speaker A: Well, we have good news. Tornado Rodriguez has entered the stage, so a magical moment may ensue here. Tornado, welcome to the. Welcome to the show. Where are you calling from? Are you also in Argentina?
00:34:17.808 - 00:34:21.536, Speaker D: Hey, how, how everything is doing there?
00:34:21.640 - 00:34:22.280, Speaker A: Hello.
00:34:22.432 - 00:34:23.164, Speaker D: Hello.
00:34:23.464 - 00:34:30.308, Speaker A: Little cold out here in Berlin, but otherwise doing great. I went to the gym this morning, so I'm super happy about that.
00:34:30.396 - 00:34:35.824, Speaker D: Oh, that's good. I don't go to the gym. I'm like Flora, I don't do any workout.
00:34:36.204 - 00:34:36.984, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:38.644 - 00:34:39.188, Speaker D: Hi.
00:34:39.276 - 00:34:40.260, Speaker A: So tell us.
00:34:40.412 - 00:34:41.996, Speaker D: I'm so nervous to be here.
00:34:42.100 - 00:34:49.268, Speaker A: Thank you for coming up. And so tell us. And we're just having fun over here, so no big deal. So how did you guys meet?
00:34:49.396 - 00:35:12.304, Speaker D: Well, I have been like a big fan of Flora's work, like forever. I'm from Argentina too. Flora is from Cordova and I'm from Buenos Aires. We live like 8 hours away by car. We haven't met each other, like in real life yet. But I like. Yeah, that's kind of crazy.
00:35:12.304 - 00:35:23.220, Speaker D: Once we were at the same place at the same time, but there was a wall in the middle and we haven't seen each other, so that was crazy.
00:35:23.292 - 00:35:24.948, Speaker A: That's crazy. It's kind of poetic.
00:35:25.036 - 00:35:25.700, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:35:25.852 - 00:35:28.304, Speaker A: Do you guys plan to meet at any point?
00:35:28.604 - 00:35:33.772, Speaker D: I wish. I don't know. Like maybe that would ruin it. I don't know.
00:35:33.948 - 00:35:39.424, Speaker A: I'm joking. I'm joking. I was thinking maybe that would ruin the mystery of the whole relationship.
00:35:40.324 - 00:35:50.182, Speaker D: No, no. I think we would have like a lot of fun. We talk like every day, like long WhatsApp audios, like really long.
00:35:50.238 - 00:35:54.062, Speaker A: That's great. Is it an artistic relationship that you both have?
00:35:54.238 - 00:36:20.298, Speaker D: Yes, yes, from the beginning. Well, here in Argentina, like illustrators, like everyone know everyone, you know? And we know everyone. We know everything about everyone. So. Yeah, I knew Florida that way, like from Instagram, from colleagues. And I always love Flora's work. Like big fans of Flora.
00:36:20.386 - 00:36:23.442, Speaker A: Well, that's great. And Flora, do you have anything to say?
00:36:23.578 - 00:36:46.214, Speaker C: Yes, I'm a big fan of tornado. Of course. I invited her to participate in a magazine that we have with a friend here in Cordova. Yes, that is called Sierras. And Tornado participated there, but we didn't. We didn't meet. And that's something that we have to plan soon because we have to meet.
00:36:46.954 - 00:36:54.934, Speaker D: I have to go to where you live. Because where I live is like bad. Where you live sounds like more fun.
00:36:55.554 - 00:36:56.562, Speaker C: Yes, of course.
00:36:56.658 - 00:37:11.526, Speaker A: Well, this is great. And tornado, you might need to mute your microphone when you're not talking because there does seem to be some background noise on the sea or something. Something. It almost sounds like. You see, there we go. Just for sound quality. Flora, you've made these stickers and everything.
00:37:11.526 - 00:37:25.246, Speaker A: I was wondering to myself, like, have you ever shown in galleries or anything or what's your experience? You know, it sounds like you've come to nfts in the last couple of years and you work really physically. Like, what is your experience as an artist? Kind of up to this point?
00:37:25.390 - 00:37:41.328, Speaker C: No, I don't have a lot of experience. I was invited once to show my work as a comic artist here in my town because I designed the logo or the graphics for a theatrical festival.
00:37:41.496 - 00:37:42.484, Speaker A: Oh, cool.
00:37:42.824 - 00:38:17.964, Speaker C: Yes, here in Cordova. So the government, I did a drawing and they used. And they used that as a graphics for the festival. So they organized me like a. A show for my pieces that I had at that moment that was like really specific humor comic daily pieces that I had done for a digital magazine here in Cordova that I did weekly. It was like a series of comic stripes. They showed that.
00:38:18.084 - 00:38:21.092, Speaker A: Now, is this the Las Pierre's fan scenes on your.
00:38:21.148 - 00:38:22.196, Speaker C: No. Okay.
00:38:22.220 - 00:38:23.344, Speaker A: That's something else.
00:38:23.744 - 00:38:32.192, Speaker C: Yes. Laspiras is a project that I have with a friend that is a magazine printed in Riso. Risograph.
00:38:32.288 - 00:38:33.244, Speaker A: Oh, cool.
00:38:33.784 - 00:38:54.374, Speaker C: Yes. And we show the comics and art from female artists from here in Argentina, from different places. And it has five numbers. We stopped in the pandemic, but we are planning to do the number six very soon.
00:38:54.534 - 00:39:23.764, Speaker A: Well, that's super interesting. I mean, it really reminds me of Oxyn, who also came out of zine culture. You know, I see it, you guys. I can just see the visual experience just in your guys work, you know, and just the composition. You're a graphic designer. So tell us then, what do you have planned? So right now, I guess, are you focused primarily on the daily drawings? Do you have anything else on the menu? I guess you're going to do another issue of Las Pieras. What else?
00:39:23.804 - 00:39:35.404, Speaker C: Yes. Well, I have to finish some pages of my comic diary, so I get to complete my number four because I do the scenes.
00:39:35.484 - 00:39:37.144, Speaker A: Oh, zines like magic.
00:39:38.004 - 00:40:14.370, Speaker C: Yes. I published my comic diary as Zines. So I have three numbers yet, and now I have to finish the number four. And I want to finish that because it's taking me a lot of time to finish that. And of course, continue with the daily drawings and making some art for foundation and. Yes, La Fieras, it's like a priority for me because it's something like in real life, and I love real life. I love to get out of the digital sometimes.
00:40:14.370 - 00:40:21.920, Speaker C: So La Sierras is something that I want to continue doing. Yes, a lot of things going on.
00:40:22.032 - 00:40:44.552, Speaker A: Well, it sounds super exciting. And if anybody wants to come on stage in the final ten minutes here, you have a chance to talk to the one and only Flora Marquez and Tornado Rodriguez, sometimes partner in crime here. Do you sell your work online? Because you seem like the kind of artists that you could start an Instagram account and you already have one, of course, but where you could actually sell.
00:40:44.728 - 00:41:19.338, Speaker C: I had an online store where I sell my work, but it's no, right now I'm not doing that. It's a lot of work, actually. So I stopped my online store, but I do go to fairs and graphic fairs and comic fairs, and I sell my scenes and my illustrations and stickers, and I'm always going to those places. I love them.
00:41:19.426 - 00:41:41.722, Speaker A: Yeah, I could see you fitting in right in there. And it's kind of funny. It's really hard to go back to physical, like shipping physical art once you do the NFT blockchain thing because, I mean, it's zero shipping, right? I mean, you put it up and it's a real, like, it's an afternoon of your life sometimes to ship a work, right?
00:41:41.778 - 00:42:07.388, Speaker C: Yes, yes. And it's here in Argentina, we have a lot of laws with the thing with the art shipping. It's really expensive. If you have to ship to another country, for example, works of art, it's almost impossible. So, yeah, it's some. It's really challenging that.
00:42:07.436 - 00:42:34.984, Speaker A: So that is super interesting. I mean, you know, it's funny. Like when I was sold a painting, let's say I was just talking about it, actually. I think last show, this shoes oil painting, and I had to ship it to Canada. There was this whole thing where you have to sign a form if you're shipping an artwork, more than $1,000. Because these countries, they want to make sure that they're not losing their precious art artifacts. Like, is that what's going on in Argentina as well?
00:42:35.444 - 00:43:23.584, Speaker C: I don't. I'm not sure if that's it, but I know that it's really, really expensive. I asked a friend here because someone wanted to buy my. Do you remember when I. You showcased that in your artist journal? When I paint something in analogic and someone wanted to buy that painting from me and he was, he told me that he would pay for the NFT and then I could send the piece. But it was so difficult. And that friend told me that if I going to send the piece, the art, I shouldn't say that is art.
00:43:24.004 - 00:43:41.428, Speaker A: That was it. Yeah. And like, I had a similar experience as well where it's like, okay, let's just say it's worth $500, you know, let them check up on me. I don't know. Yeah, they don't make it easy. I mean, you'd think being an artist is hard enough. And I think the shipping was like dollar 250 to your point.
00:43:41.428 - 00:43:54.480, Speaker A: So, I mean, it was a similar situation. That was outrageous. Michael Macasso, welcome to the stage. It's great to have you here. Also known as Mec TXT and now KEc TXt. Michael Macassar out of Indonesia. How are you doing?
00:43:54.632 - 00:44:42.554, Speaker F: Hello, Adrian. I actually accidentally pressed the button, but since I'm in the stage anyway, Flora, I've been a fan of your work and it's very encouraging to see another artist who do things daily, including like you. And the other was like, grigala? I think so. Maybe a little question for you. How do you find the motivation to do different themes, different kinds of stories each time you. You do your art? I personally do my dailies as well, but I think two weeks behind. I've been struggling a bit because of the real life job that I have, because I'm not a full time artist, but just curious to see how you do your, you know, like, art thinking, like, which kind of a theme do you go today and which one do you want to do for the next day and stuff like that.
00:44:42.554 - 00:44:45.554, Speaker F: Maybe you could tell us a bit of story about that.
00:44:45.974 - 00:45:10.280, Speaker C: I don't have, like, something planned. Never. I don't plan anything. I just. I just go with the flow, you know, I wake up and I grab the iPad and I start drawing and I try to not to have anything, like, clear. I let my. My hands to do the job.
00:45:10.280 - 00:45:51.336, Speaker C: And it's really amazing to create like that because I get surprised of what it comes out and I don't have anything in mind. So everything is like a surprise to me. Sometimes I say why I'm drawing this, what I'm thinking about. And I think that's the way I feel more comfortable creating because I don't get so much bored if I know what I'm going to do next. I'm bored right now. I don't want to do it anymore. But if I start creating without knowing where I'm going to be, that's exciting.
00:45:51.336 - 00:45:56.512, Speaker C: And that's the motivation for me to not knowing where I'm going.
00:45:56.648 - 00:46:29.554, Speaker A: I absolutely love that. And I totally agree with you. It becomes like when all of a sudden it's like, okay, here's my task, and I'm gonna do this. And then all of a sudden it's hard and it's not working, whereas it's so cool. And I love how you put it, how you get surprised by yourself, because isn't that true with art? How often it is that you'll make work that you never would have expected that you would have made or that you could have made, even. And there's a deep lesson there. Like, it's a profound point for me.
00:46:30.174 - 00:47:09.814, Speaker C: Yes, yes. I hate creating because of, for instance, if something is selling more, you should do more of that. I hate that. I love creating things that just came to my hand or to my brain, but without knowing if they are going to like or not. I like the. The magic of not knowing. And I think that's a key element in my way of creating, to not knowing anything, because if I know what I'm going to do, it's like something planned.
00:47:09.814 - 00:47:53.380, Speaker C: And as you say, it sounds like work. And I don't want my drawings to be. Well, it is, but I don't want them to be my work. I want my drawings to be a pleasure. And I always fight to keep that as a pleasure place, not as a place where I have to be obligated. Something that's my universe and that I wanted to be mine and I wanted to be fresh and I wanted to be unique and I wanted to be personal and my own. So if.
00:47:53.380 - 00:48:15.704, Speaker C: If I know what I'm going to do is because something has contaminated my, my, my brain and I. I like to not knowing. I like to be a. That the drawing is a surprise and is something that I don't know why I'm doing it.
00:48:15.864 - 00:48:33.084, Speaker A: You're so quotable, Flora. You're ready for the big leagues, I think here. Final thoughts here from Tornado Rodriguez. I'm so glad you came up here. Again, another magical moment on this show. Tornado, any thoughts here as we kind of wrap up and get final thoughts from people?
00:48:33.664 - 00:49:03.422, Speaker D: Oh, I don't know what to say. But just I wanted to say that for me, Flora was a person that changed my artistic path, inviting me to Las Fieras. And something is a person like. Like an amazing person, you know, that people that you met and something clicks. So I admire her a lot. So keep your artistic friends close.
00:49:03.598 - 00:49:04.470, Speaker A: I love it.
00:49:04.542 - 00:49:07.034, Speaker C: Love you, Carmelo. I love you too.
00:49:07.454 - 00:49:12.478, Speaker A: There's our magical moment here. Mec txT. Any final thoughts here?
00:49:12.606 - 00:49:22.758, Speaker F: Just a pleasant night for tonight, I think. And thank you very much, Adrian and Flora and Rinsen as well, for holding the space, the awesome space, just like always.
00:49:22.846 - 00:49:23.294, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:49:23.374 - 00:49:37.320, Speaker A: Thank you for attending. And you just got a voice for radio Mech TXT. So come up anytime. It's wonderful to have you here. And Flora, any thoughts, thoughts or anything before we turn to rune to, do.
00:49:37.352 - 00:49:38.936, Speaker C: I have a voice for radio?

Another thing that I wanted to say is that I listen to artist journal to learn English and to practice. And I learned a lot of things. For instance, when you say you use this a lot, Adrian, you use this quote unquote thing. And this one was something that I will treasure forever because I need it.
