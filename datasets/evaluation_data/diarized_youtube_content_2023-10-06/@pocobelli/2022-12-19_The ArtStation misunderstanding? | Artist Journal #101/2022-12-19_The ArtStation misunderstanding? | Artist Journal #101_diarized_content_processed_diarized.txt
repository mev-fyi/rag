00:00:05.240 - 00:00:26.278, Speaker A: Good game. I hope you watched. Yeah. Was it the best of all time? I still like the 2002 Germany Brazil game with Kalena as the referee. That was epic. Artist journal, December 19, 2022. For only a week longer here.
00:00:26.278 - 00:00:58.438, Speaker A: Two weeks longer. My name is Adrian Pokebelli, artist reporter, which does not mean what you think it means, but we will go back into that, I guarantee you. Yeah. So, again, I'm trying to make these episodes shorter. I mean, I want them to be more 25 minutes, maybe a little bit more history, all that sort of stuff. What does artist reporter mean? We have touched on that in, like, you know, longtime viewers. In other words, two or three month long viewers will know, will be familiar with that term.
00:00:58.438 - 00:01:15.166, Speaker A: It's pretty exciting. So it's kind of like. Yeah, so I'm trying to balance things out. I probably need to look at a little less art and which will be better. Just a little bit less, which will be better for my recording situation here as well, because the mic keeps cutting out. This is. I do these in one take.
00:01:15.166 - 00:01:43.348, Speaker A: This is, like, take four today, guys. This is, like, the longest, and I almost want to. I'll have to rush through it here, and I'm terrified that this thing will cut out at, like, the 20 minutes mark again. So, anyways, I emptied the recycle bin, all of it. So, anyways, here it is, Kappa, with a really cool, topical work. Tribute to Lionel Messi. A tribute to our international scene here.
00:01:43.348 - 00:02:18.704, Speaker A: Right? We have the interesting juxtaposition. Kind of gives some drama to this work. This isn't some simple, uh, you know, tribute to Messi. Uh, you see, kind of like, again, the tattoos as part of, like, what I almost consider an iconic series on tazos here of the tattoos, the guy lifting the shirt with the tattoos. Really cool series. And this juxtaposition here of world cups, like, almost like a keychain on a machine gun, which may be a little too close for comfort for some. Like, this may be the reality for some people out there.
00:02:18.704 - 00:02:46.164, Speaker A: I mean, we really don't know who's minting, and Kappa is probably just a regular dude, but we really don't know. It could be anybody, you know, on this international, you know, scene here, all these anonymous names and everything. So, anyways, cool work, kappa. A nice tribute and quickly put out. Very cool. Available for one tezos, which is close to free these days. Edition of 50 tezo dios.
00:02:46.164 - 00:03:03.864, Speaker A: And. Okay, a few comments here. I'm gonna. Okay, so, first of all, this whole maximizing the image business that I was having issues with last time. That's like an object change. That's apparently, that's a feature. It looks like a bug to me.
00:03:03.864 - 00:03:26.124, Speaker A: Very nice comment from Brett Mantic. Unusually stellar episode, as usual. Funny. I am recently seeing the same issue with maximizing images. By clicking the bottom right square, they no longer enter full screen mode. I'm thinking that object changes function so that it doesn't enlarge the image beyond the piece dimensions. But you think it would just halt where your screen is vertical or horizontal.
00:03:26.124 - 00:04:01.208, Speaker A: CSS should do this, and they're an image site, so most images, gifs, mp4 s in fullscreen mode are actually like distorted. So yeah, as we're going to see, like now, they're like glued to the top. They're not always bigger. I don't know what they're doing, to be honest. It's not making my life any easier. What I have to do is open right click open image in new tab and then magnify or what. So anyways, thank you for sharing that, Brett, because that helps me.
00:04:01.208 - 00:04:54.622, Speaker A: It's not just my browser then, because I might have thought it was Mary migraine talking about the AI tech and basically how she treats tech as neutral, because we were having that big debate on AI art and whether because there's people who are anti AI art right now, I have some thoughts about this. So first of all, she says, first of all, I think of the tech as neutral. It depends what you do with it. Anti crypto. This is what I say to anti crypto and anti NFT people, too. And then we're talking about contemporary art and digital art scenes. These are parallel art scenes, you know? And when you talk to contemporary art people, they don't know too much about the digital art scene, and often it's vice versa, you know, which I think it gives you incentive as frankly, an artist, because they're different audiences.
00:04:54.622 - 00:05:30.262, Speaker A: And as an artist, you kind of want to maximize your audience. And just like, you know, you want to be multimedia, in my opinion. Not everybody wants to do this, but just in my world, why wouldn't you want to have physical work? Why wouldn't you want to have digital work? And then they sell to different. It's just good for business, it's good for your art and for your practice. It gives you ideas. It's kind of where the conversation is. So anyways, now what she was saying, though, about some people thinking contemporary art is better, contemporary art scene, she sees that as ableist because some people are disabled and they can't get to a physical place and you know, probably a lot of these places don't.
00:05:30.262 - 00:05:56.534, Speaker A: I mean, the main institutions have accessibility, but if you go to some small gallery, they don't always have the accessibility. It'll be up some. It'll be in some building somewhere, or especially in Berlin, you'll find like abandoned apartments that have been turned into galleries sometimes. So interesting. So one of the benefits, one of the features of the digital art scene, according to Mary, is that disabled artists can participate. So, interesting point. Thank you for the show.
00:05:56.534 - 00:06:31.474, Speaker A: Thank you for watching and everything you do. Mary, she puts on some good Twitter spaces. And actually, quick note on Twitter spaces, I'm thinking this Wednesday, 930 to 1030 Eastern Standard Time, I'll put out a tweet to kind of confirm it, probably tomorrow morning. But yeah, that's what I'm thinking. And it's going to be done by theme. There's a co host I've been talking to, which could be a lot of fun, who reached out about a month ago or so. So anyways, lots in the pipeline here, but I'm thinking Wednesday, 930 to 1030, it might just be me for the first one.
00:06:31.474 - 00:07:03.204, Speaker A: If I can get ahold of my co host, he'll be in there too. And anyway, we're just going to iterate and start slow. But that's what I'm thinking. And that would replace the Wednesday show. But it'll give everybody a chance to chime in, which I think is important and kind of fun. And it's a way for everybody in the audience to grow their audience, because I find the best way to grow Twitter is actually showing up to these spaces and talking. Right? So if you're trying to build your Twitter audience, there's no better way that I know of than to show up at a Twitter spaces and start talking.
00:07:03.204 - 00:07:29.924, Speaker A: Then people just start to relate, starts oh, I like that person. And they follow you. So anyways, also, rune tune here. So we're discussing artstation, right? And yeah, he's saying so. He's sharing the thought. AI tools copying your style is a weak argument for the damnation of AI. As you say, if a text prompt can really emulate your style, then perhaps you need to work on your art.
00:07:29.924 - 00:08:26.604, Speaker A: And regardless, this anti AI argument can't resume until we take a moment to challenge our own assumptions about originality. Most of the ridicule is too revealing of their own insecurities, and too often there's an obvious lack of understandings of concepts like originality and creative ownership to warranty a thoughtful response. Yeah, I was thinking about this. And I think I figured out, actually, what's going on here, the misunderstanding that's going on when you look at artstation, as we kind of pointed out last time, it's kind of a lot of fantasy art, right? And a lot of Sci-Fi wizards, almost like, you know, warpath, the world of warpath or something, dungeons and dragons, like drag, you know, this sort of thing. And I started to realize, and actually, another point on that when I downloaded mid journey, or was it stable diffusion or Dal E? I think it was mid journey. It was, like, in the prompt that they coach you with when you're starting out. It's like, put artstation in the prompt.
00:08:26.604 - 00:09:21.416, Speaker A: And maybe this is why there's such a big pushback from artstation, because they're saying you're using our work, and they might not be concerned with the same things that we might be concerned with. Like, we're concerned with, you know, art, capital a art. And, like, big ideas, the tradition, the Renaissance, duchamp, the impressionist mediums, big ideas. They might not care about what we're talking about. Their concern is I make my, you know, animation or comic book art, and I see people that are putting in prompts, putting my name, and they get 85% of my work, you know, basically. And I remember that article. Maybe if you watched, like, a month ago, there was an article that was talking about this and how, you know, this was a concern, this very concern.
00:09:21.416 - 00:10:34.090, Speaker A: Now, what I would say, you know, so, first of all, I'd be a little bit more sympathetic, and I'm feeling a little bit, once I understand, okay. They don't necessarily give a damn about Duchamp and whatever we're talking about, they're just seeing doing their craft, and they see people copying it, you know, and selling it. I guess what I would say is, from the prompts I've seen so far, copying and really saying, okay, pokebellies, Sci-Fi work, do a derivative, and then it's. They look like 85% as good, let's say, than an original. So as long as there is that distinction between the original and the emulation, say, only being at 85%, I say it's still a tribute to the original, and that really the work of the original person maybe should even go up because they're the, you know, the original, the real deal. And, you know, if people are selling it for $50 for your derivative AI derivative, well, maybe your work commands 500 or even 5000 is sort of my take. So I'm, after thinking about it, I'm slightly more sympathetic with the artstation people because I think we're in two different worlds.
00:10:34.090 - 00:11:08.214, Speaker A: I think, you know, and Robnis was pretty brutal with them. And I feel like there's a misunderstanding, in my opinion. Like now, if they start saying, hey, no, we're making art in the tradition of the Renaissance and the, and the impressionists and Duchon Warhol, then I think they're fair game. And we say, okay, you guys don't know what you're talking about. And this conversation, you know, then I think it's fair game. I don't think that's where they're coming from, though. I think they're just going, hey, I make my animation art and now it's being copied and people are selling it.
00:11:08.214 - 00:11:42.318, Speaker A: So I think that is the nature of the misunderstanding. And very quickly, just on Glenn Brown. So Runetoon says, to summarize, Glenn Brown was making work in that style before AI showed up. However, if anybody should be concerned about the groin use of AI tools to make art, he is the one that I would think would have the reason to be perturbed because his art kind of looks like AI now. I still thought like, so I need to do more research. I think Rune tune knows a lot more about Glenn Brown than I do. I just knew a few images.
00:11:42.318 - 00:12:16.824, Speaker A: So here is the Google AI tool that I was thinking of, the deep dream generator. And if we take a quick look here. See this? This is what I was talking about. This kind of, again, this garish sort of multi line like this, and then weird eyeballs like this everywhere with garish colors. Again, garish is the word that just comes. So what I thought was going on here, and I think I'm probably wrong. Again, this is a work that came out in 2008.
00:12:16.824 - 00:12:57.044, Speaker A: I'll have to do a little more digging to find out when deep dream generator came out. But what I thought was going on here is Glenn Brown sees the deep dream generator, incorporates it, and says, oh, okay, here's a technological representation of still life. But rather than kind of keeping all the garishness as the artist, I'm going to maintain sovereignty on this instead of the AI. Instead of the artist being the tool of the AI, so to speak, I'm going to maintain. I'm going to be the artist that kind of controls the AI only as much as I want. So I'm going to kind of incorporate this little kind of style onto my work, especially here. I mean, it looks like the deep dream generator.
00:12:57.044 - 00:13:29.544, Speaker A: Again, maybe a fluke, but it so, especially, like here and whatever. So anyways, that's what I thought was going on there. And again, you see, like, here's just an example, another kind of super garish example, so that he was incorporating certain things. Again, probably totally accidental, still not sure, but kind of a fun conversation. So rare here. Rare force. One also chimes in on AI and another way of using it, which I'm actually pretty sympathetic with.
00:13:29.544 - 00:14:04.344, Speaker A: Boyrad, this work here from earlier this year, using AI to manipulate a portrait, then painted on top, and ran through vqgan again to make it all consistent. So I don't know what vqgan is, this idea to use AI and then to paint on top. That's kind of how, like, if I hadn't seen any AI that people were using, that's how I would have used it. It's like, sort of as, okay, use it as an idea generator, and then maybe you work off of that, and then you make your work on top of it. Right. This sort of thing. So that seems to be what he has done here.
00:14:04.344 - 00:14:29.542, Speaker A: So, interesting. In contrast, we have Charles AI. I cherish the imperfections in AI art. Over polishing them takes away the algorithmic randomness, which is specific to this medium and part of its beauty. So kind of making the case for raw AI, where there is no kind of, you know, modification. So this is. I'm sympathetic to both these things.
00:14:29.542 - 00:15:08.158, Speaker A: I think it depends what you're trying to do. If you're looking for ideas and new compositions, you'd use it the way for your paintings. Then maybe you use it the way that rare force one is. If you just want to make raw AI or pure AI, then I take Charles AI's point, because if we saw this before with strange thing very early on, where there's the hand that kind of looked like the armchair, like the handle of an armchair. And I was like, oh, like, see, there's an error here with the hand. It looks like the end of an armchair. And strange thing, who was deep in the AI already was like, no, that's not a bug.
00:15:08.158 - 00:15:29.106, Speaker A: That's a feature. That's cool. And this is what I see is this is kind of a similar thought from Charles AI. Embrace what I call AI distortion. Okay, so, interesting point. So the technology is so disruptive that there's gonna be more than one way to use this stuff. Okay.
00:15:29.106 - 00:15:50.084, Speaker A: And speaking of which, look at this. So, and Charles AI actually reached out after the last episode. He may be interested in joining us on a spaces. He actually mentioned that he was interested in doing a long form discussion, potentially. So, yeah. So interesting. So we could have some interesting people in our digital salon there.
00:15:50.084 - 00:16:07.092, Speaker A: Let's see. I will let everybody know probably tomorrow. I'll probably just put out a tweet with the spaces. I'm kind of new on spaces as far as actually running one. So we'll see what happens. And again I'll reach out to the co host. We'll see.
00:16:07.092 - 00:16:41.592, Speaker A: He kind of doesn't always message back super fast or sometimes is a way. So anyways, but we have a pretty exciting co host for the spaces. Two potentially. So a lot of potential. Anyway, Charles, AI puts out a new work and this is interesting. So it's kind of a dynamic work. So you see here there is one column and basically it changes according to the price of Ethereum and he worked with, it's an AI art dynamic NFT built in collaboration with transient labs that tracks Ethereum's daily price action.
00:16:41.592 - 00:17:10.858, Speaker A: One green column represents a plus 1% variation. Two red columns represent a 2% variation -2% variation and so on. So anyways, a dynamic AI NFT and apparently you can break it apart if you want to shatter this one of one to create twelve different one of ones. So anyways, Charles, AI getting very experimental here. Here's four green candles or four green columns. Four red columns. Pretty cool.
00:17:10.858 - 00:17:37.638, Speaker A: So that'll be interesting to see how that does. I could see that going for quite a bit of money. We're looking at some little bit of knitting in AI last time. And here's strange thing with a fantastic collection here, AI designer night Christmas sneakers. When this come out a few hours ago, which one is your favorite? And even just the color guys like the colors are outstanding here. Like you just nails the Christmas look. So you have almost these knitted air jordans.
00:17:37.638 - 00:18:00.590, Speaker A: It's almost like a Christmas stocking or Christmas socks meets Christmas shoe. Nice distortion of the logo here. Again this is like magazine worthy. And like this would be where the ads are more interesting than the magazine like Sears catalog. Watch out. Even the little box here. But you see like the AI distortion here.
00:18:00.590 - 00:18:15.682, Speaker A: So pretty wild and cool. Even get some depth of field here. I'm not sure how much he's doing like Photoshop and editing. Here's more depth of field. Very interesting stuff. I mean beautiful. You see a touch of AI distortion here but barely.
00:18:15.682 - 00:18:53.682, Speaker A: I think as the AI tech gets better and better we're seeing less and less distortion and the distortion even like we could consider this a distortion of the Nike logo here but it's getting more and more kind of convincing. Oops. And let's just quickly cycle through the rest of these. Yeah, so the mood, I mean, again, feeling pretty Christmassy over here. So beautiful work by. Strange thing, as we have come to expect work by aile working on Christmas sweaters. And she of course, has been doing some incredible summaries for us on Twitter of this show.
00:18:53.682 - 00:19:31.570, Speaker A: So big shout out to aile doing sweater party exploration of mashup collab between Koei Khan and Santiago and Hasdrubal waffle. So a sweater Christmas party. It's looking pretty good, isn't it? The aesthetics are coming along quite nicely. Interesting AI distortions here and all round, so just cool work from ilay as we start to wrap up our AI section here. And of course, moonchild has a new one. Again, playing with these abstractions, really with contrasting it with the representational figure in the foreground. Kind of classic moonshine.
00:19:31.570 - 00:19:54.586, Speaker A: Sorry, moon child work, cheap reserve on foundation 0.15. She sells her works pretty reasonably. A little bit of concern out here. An NFT World summary. Limbo channel one. So limbo, kind of pointing out that a lot has happened. FTX opensea royalties problem, super rare onboarding a ton of people, foundation launching drops.
00:19:54.586 - 00:20:12.482, Speaker A: I'm not sure what that's about. Additions taking over, Twitter collapsing and people migrating. The big AI debate, we've seen quite a lot, and Joe Rogan's dad chimes in as well. We got big names still chugging along. True. AI's biggest question will it age well with time? Some will. Greed.
00:20:12.482 - 00:20:38.784, Speaker A: If we could mint on a stable coin, it would solve some problems. I thought that was super interesting. I was like, oh, what if you made a blockchain that was just a stable coin? Then I was like, oh, maybe that's what the Federal Reserve is going to do, you know? So anyway, isn't that interesting? Fed coin. No social media can replace Twitter on the access to artists and market. Definitely true for the digital art scene, without question. And we have pokebelly. So big shout out to Joe Rogan's dad again.
00:20:38.784 - 00:21:06.540, Speaker A: And we see the price of Tazos, $0.83. So put on your collector's hat, it's never been cheaper. Hopefully it gets even cheaper. I feel continuing on this is something also to be bullish on. So there's this interview, first of all, with axin here. And so 17 miles punk 4628 ETH. So you've seen Ethereum, people are giving Euxine some love.
00:21:06.540 - 00:21:50.536, Speaker A: And this is something also to be excited about, because think about it, Xcopy gives the blessing to Euxine now, if you're a big deal Ethereum NFT collector, art collector, and you're not on Tezos, you might feel like you're missing out, right? If you. You're like, oh, maybe I like. If you like Xcopy, you probably like Euxine, you know, like. And there's a few Euxine works on Ethereum, but a lot of his great work is also on Tazos. So if you want to collect that. All to say, this may be onboarding some pretty serious collectors that maybe never felt the need to be onboarded onto tezos before. That is my point here.
00:21:50.536 - 00:22:20.048, Speaker A: And it may be coming courtesy of Xcopy and xene through axine via Xcopy, or however you want to put that continuing on. So let's look at some work here. So I'm going to try and not kill my mic. So you see what I'm saying here? Things are glued to the top. So I've had some mic problems, as I mentioned, at the top of the show. So I'm just going to leave them unmaximized right now and pray that nothing gets stopped. So anyways, here's a new work by Kristen RGB IV.
00:22:20.048 - 00:22:33.704, Speaker A: Color cycling. They seem to have different textures here. This is kind of like a bigger, chunkier pixel. This is almost just like diagonal. So he breaks these apart. The city is. You have four different buildings here, I think we could call them.
00:22:33.704 - 00:23:07.796, Speaker A: And then he breaks them apart into different skyscrapers. And each one kind of seems to have a different patterning, interestingly, like, it's almost like a different kind of screen filter or different screen kind or something. See this? They have different textures, so just very cool, beautiful colors there. Lorna mills with some new landscapes. And actually, sorry, very quickly here. These are editions of 50 for 15 tazos, so about $10 or $12 each. Lorna mills with some new landscapes in her classic style.
00:23:07.796 - 00:23:28.044, Speaker A: Again, the hard contrast here between the flat pixelated work with the kind of depthy landscape, with gradations and all that sort of thing. Classic work. Went to fake whale vault. She has a couple more. This one's for 350 tezos. These are some of my favorite Lorna mills works. Just these simple.
00:23:28.044 - 00:23:39.292, Speaker A: Looks like an alligator or something there. Simple landscapes. Another beautiful one. Again, these would go great in a landscape show. And this went for 300. So this one sold. I'm not surprised.
00:23:39.292 - 00:23:50.052, Speaker A: Very cool. New work. Sorry. Recent work from LB. So very cool. Like sunglasses work here. Holo still available.
00:23:50.052 - 00:24:17.064, Speaker A: And this is interesting. There's eight here left. I thought this one would have sold out right away. But then you go over to here, then there's this rose that opens and closes, and this sold out for five. So maybe it just came out a little earlier, but it's kind of funny what sells and what doesn't. That's another great thing. Like, we're learning a ton about how the art market works here, just in our little laboratory here.
00:24:17.064 - 00:24:55.570, Speaker A: Just on a real, like, experiential basis here. So remember that, like, we're all getting great experience here on the nature of art and the nature of the art market. Again, we're consuming more art than most people. Just look at this. Like, how many are you, how many images were you consuming before you were into tezos and digital art, or nfts the reaper? Another really cool, very nice video work here from LB, rendered as a gif. And of course, this rose here, really cool colors. And finally, loan.
00:24:55.570 - 00:25:16.314, Speaker A: So makes a pretty nice series here, doesn't it? Nice repetition of four. They could all go together in the same room quite well. This is an interesting work by Ed Morolla. Trying to flip it over. There you go. Look at this strange party collaboration between Michi Asu and Ed Morolla. Mesh digital painting and pixel buy for four, edition of 20.
00:25:16.314 - 00:25:40.614, Speaker A: Never seen anything quite like that. And even the edge is pretty interesting. Cool new work from Sabato again, like, okay, kind of works, our maximizing here, but you see how it's glued to the top. But we're just going to have to live with that until they fix it or keep it. Interesting work. He had a good title on it, too. The intersection of art and technology.
00:25:40.614 - 00:26:01.904, Speaker A: And so you see some tvs here. Agriculture, what looks like. I can't remember what you call those. Those things that Bill Gates. I feel like Bill Gates used to ride around on some VR. Kind of like a devil figure smoking. And then a tree with surveillance cameras.
00:26:01.904 - 00:26:28.856, Speaker A: So all sorts of fascinating stuff. A chrome work by Sabato. Extremely cool, as usual. Seven tezos, very nice genesis work from Santiago. Let me just maximize this. I don't know why object doesn't just do this. If they're concerned, like, at least center, it would be my recommendation to them.
00:26:28.856 - 00:26:46.934, Speaker A: So anyways, just a nice combination of textures here, reserved for half an ETH. Another, you know, abstraction. Experimentation with abstraction. Here's some more from someone I'd never heard of. Rees FX hashworks. This is generative art. Pretty interesting work.
00:26:46.934 - 00:27:04.226, Speaker A: And here's another one that by, hey, Jarrah's write code. Make art. Look at this. So pretty nice. I guess. Made with code, I'm guessing. So just some more interesting abstraction.
00:27:04.226 - 00:27:41.216, Speaker A: We're seeing some pretty interesting digital abstraction, aren't we? A new one from tuks on foundation, Linetropft collection, December 20 on foundation. So again, just really kind of bold experimentation here. You know, you can see, like, what I see here is digital art, especially abstraction maturing. When people have the boldness to put on fairly minimal works like this in the digital sphere. This is something you'd see more in like, you know, contemporary art, right. But not so much in digital art. But we're starting to see it.
00:27:41.216 - 00:28:00.004, Speaker A: To me, this shows a kind of maturation of sorts. Here's something that just kind of popped up this morning. People of Tezos. Here's Yazid. So people are doing portraits of themselves for the people of Tezos. I guess they were asked, Yazid here is an artist, and they're kind of prominent artists. Here's limbo.
00:28:00.004 - 00:28:20.670, Speaker A: Pretty nice work here. La resistance exe. I love Limbo's work. Show you a couple of more. I think popple did one. I want to open it, but yeah, I don't want to kill the mic for like the third or fourth time here. Here's a work by popple.
00:28:20.670 - 00:28:34.074, Speaker A: So people are pointing out they're one of one. We're going to look at Zancans later. Oh, and there's the paper crane we have. So anyways, people doing their portraits here. Here's Mumu the stan in their styles. So very cool. One of ones.
00:28:34.074 - 00:28:51.162, Speaker A: People of Tezos here is a work by Haiti Rockette. Keep pumping, dude. So another glitch rom. This looks like a snowboarding situation. Buy for 54 edition of 15. Let's just see what this kind of did. Sold for 690 and now he's minting on Taya.
00:28:51.162 - 00:29:16.236, Speaker A: And it went, yeah, within basically 20 minutes he had. And then, yeah, then you have to just get it on secondary after that. Cool work. And, yeah, so rustic, I guess. Sold quite a bit yesterday. I saw also Artnome posted his work as well. So these slow to get started, but now these works are catching on quite a bit.
00:29:16.236 - 00:29:34.732, Speaker A: Very cool. Gn from rustic. I don't think this has been minted yet. This one also, I think he sent this out to me. So thanks for sending this out. A very cool for the culture. Tezos XTZ is the ticker for the tezos currency.
00:29:34.732 - 00:29:59.664, Speaker A: And again, looks like, I mean, these are bold decisions. Like this looks like a super Mario, I'm assuming. But look at these decisions here turning into just kind of the end of a brush mark or something cropped. Weird little moves like that. So there's it hold the deep. When you look close up at rustic digital art's work, some interesting things are happening here. Let's just put it that way.
00:29:59.664 - 00:30:16.744, Speaker A: Our milk with a nice pixel artwork. Tired pixels. Number 44. I believe in Tezos because this is the real, where real art is made. And so anyway, just a nice pixel artwork. Looks like it sold out pretty quickly. What was the.
00:30:16.744 - 00:30:45.370, Speaker A: Sold for? 420 and sold in a couple of hours. So nice. And a work in progress from MEc TXT, I thought, kind of captured the season. A lot of us are seeing snow here, a little bit of snow in Berlin, even although it's starting to melt and the temperature is going to like eleven on Christmas, which is warm out here. Anyways, beautiful work here. Beautiful work in progress. Curious to see where this goes and where he goes after his effects.
00:30:45.370 - 00:31:07.752, Speaker A: Hash series with an unusual one. And here you see the visage. I think it's called visage, ex visage. So just kind of a different take on the portrait here. So always experimenting. Francois Gamma buy for three edition of 15. Some work by bite by bit.
00:31:07.752 - 00:31:44.328, Speaker A: I thought these were hilarious. These almost look like neon signs for, like neon signs for, you know, a karaoke party disco. Let's stop that. And there's another one, the pool room. It's basically the same thing. I like how he leaves the canvas for the. So anyways, just cool.
00:31:44.328 - 00:31:58.404, Speaker A: I think these are one of ones too. Oh no. Editions of ten for ten. So I think byte by bit is raising the prices a little bit. Buy for ten, editions of ten and selling a little bit. So, yeah, I mean, with tezos at $0.80, nobody can complain.
00:31:58.404 - 00:32:30.930, Speaker A: This is on the homepage of Tezos. And I'd never heard of Jake Studios before, but I thought a pretty interesting combination of stuff, you know, like Windows 95 types, prompts, drawn out, pixelated face. And again, this kind of illustrator style warning. This piece was exhibited last at crypto Art Week Asia in Singapore. Digitally drawn animation buy for six edition of ten. So pretty reasonable price. Here's an edition of one for 310 tezos.
00:32:30.930 - 00:32:43.720, Speaker A: So just pretty interesting work. Oh, no. Digitally drawn animation. So I just. This was on the. Someone tweeted out that they were on the homepage and then I found that. So this is also people of Tezos, the paper crane.
00:32:43.720 - 00:33:22.594, Speaker A: Beautiful portrait here ended this sell for offer of 75. So not for sale yet. And here's the scream by Daniel W. And I'm not going to open up his page to look at recent work, but he does some homages to art history here. So a nice homage to the scream, again with this kind of like, you know, four color, what do they call this? Rasterized or like the. This Benday dot process. Kind of like a homage, like, to the print culture, but via digital.
00:33:22.594 - 00:33:44.114, Speaker A: Very nice. It'd be nice to see these, actually, these could be screen printed. They look like screen prints. What's kind of interesting about this, this is also interesting, kind of combination of physical, kind of the blotter sheet here with an image on top, part of blotter. NFT's work, I think this is auctioned and only went for seven tazos. One of one. So that would have been a nice pickup.
00:33:44.114 - 00:34:13.254, Speaker A: This is something I found on Twitter, site study, and I looked and they sell prints. Site study sells prints. There's no nFts here. What I liked about this as well is it kind of had a game board feeling to it, which I like. That kind of UI, using that UI as a structure kind of reminds me of medieval works in the way that it does that. So again, kind of looks like a game board, but filled with iconography. Interesting color scheme.
00:34:13.254 - 00:34:44.930, Speaker A: Has a bit of a print field because it is a print. Okay, here's a work by Joanie B that I thought was pretty interesting. So it looks like Ophelia, right? A direct reference. And I actually have the reference here. So the enamored, or like a creature native and endued unto that element, but long it could not be till that her garments, heavy with their drink, pulled the poor wretch from her melodious lay to muddy death. Well, that's probably from Shakespeare's hamlet, I'm assuming, which is how we know Ophelia and as. So if you see here.
00:34:44.930 - 00:35:12.284, Speaker A: There she is. Nice animation, by the way. So it seems to be a direct reference to Jean Everett Millet, who is a pre Raphaelite. Okay, so I actually looked up what pre Raphaelite is because I know the name, but it always kind of confused me. Why do they? They're from the 19th century. So. And then it's like on Wikipedia, it's actually called pre raphaelite brotherhood.
00:35:12.284 - 00:35:50.460, Speaker A: So the pre raphaelite brotherhood, later known as pre Raphaelites, was a group of english painters, poets, and art critics founded in 1848. So, 19th century, who formed a seven member brotherhood modeled in part on the Nazarene movement, which I've never really heard of german romantic painters. The brotherhood was only ever a loose association, and their principles were shared by other artists at the time. Later followers of the principle of the Brotherhood included. Okay, waterhouse and others. So this is where I wanted to get to, is. Why do they call themselves pre Raphaelites? Because I didn't know this until I checked this out.
00:35:50.460 - 00:36:47.368, Speaker A: The group sought a return to the abundant detail, intense colors and complex compositions of quattrocento italian art. So 14th century italian art, they rejected, I guess that'd be 15th century from the 14 hundreds. Italian art they rejected what they regarded as the mechanistic approach first adopted by mannerist artists who succeeded Raphael and Michelangelo. The brotherhood believed the classical poses and elegant compositions of Raphael in particular had been a corrupting influence on the academic teaching of art, hence the name pre Raphaelite. So isn't that interesting? I mean, sacrilege, right? To call RaphaeL so, you know, like, everything went wrong at Raphael. This is not a story you hear very often. So that is why they call themselves pre Raphaelites.
00:36:47.368 - 00:37:31.192, Speaker A: Pretty interesting. And so let's just take just a couple more lines here. In particular, the group objected to the Raphaelites. To the Raphaelites, according to William Rossetti, Sloshy. Sorry, group objected to the influence of Sir Joshua Reynolds, this guy here, founder of English Royal Academy of Arts, whom they called Sir Slashwa. To the pre Raphaelites, according to Rossetti, sloshy meant anything lax or scamped in the process of painting, and hence anything or person of a commonplace or conventional kind. The group associated their work with John Ruskin, an english critic whose influences were driven by his religious background.
00:37:31.192 - 00:38:05.450, Speaker A: Christian themes were abundant. They do seem like they're kind of a little culty, the pre Raphaelites. The group continued to accept the concepts of the history of painting and mimesis. Imitation of art as central to the purpose of art. Imitation of nature as central to the purpose of art. So you see, this is very pre photography, because I think photography comes along as the imitation of nature and just kind of puts these guys to bed again. There's kind of a religious feel to them, too.
00:38:05.450 - 00:38:39.756, Speaker A: They defined themselves as a reform movement, created a distinct name for their form of art, and published a periodical, the germ, to promote their ideas. The group's debates were recorded in the pre Raphaelite journal. The brotherhood separated after almost five years, so they didn't last very long. Five years, I mean, as I like to say, with collaboration. Sounds great in theory, but in practice it's quite difficult. Fantastic work. Speaking of kind of medieval times, here, Dan control a new work, Arspelica on foundation.
00:38:39.756 - 00:38:51.484, Speaker A: An ambitious work, reserve of 1.5 ETH. Totally awesome. Let's see if we can make it bigger even. This is a beautiful work. And we saw this as a work in progress. I think in the last episode I showed that.
00:38:51.484 - 00:39:19.184, Speaker A: So really doing wonderful things with the gradient tool here. Super duper cool. Now we've also seen this artist before, villain masks. And so he has a new work. So interesting. Kind of almost reminds me of Jeff Koon's a little bit. The pop art paintings almost has this kind of like video game rendered as 3d painting sort of thing going on.
00:39:19.184 - 00:39:36.156, Speaker A: Just kind of an interesting work. Here's some beautiful work. This was posted on Twitter. I guess this work is older, but I'd never seen this artist before. Neato is the artist hasn't sold yet for 0.4 ETH. I thought, pretty nice work.
00:39:36.156 - 00:40:00.888, Speaker A: Kind of looks like generative art a little bit, but I don't think it is. And I have another one here, too, also by nitto. And this is also from earlier in the year. So just kind of interesting work that I just, you know, never sold. But, you know, sometimes stuff just slips through the cracks. Like I think maybe tweeted at a different time. I could totally see this artist selling and taking off a little bit.
00:40:00.888 - 00:40:22.464, Speaker A: Some holiday work by Gabriel Tesarev, who does all those great cakes that we all love. Happy holidays. Holiday pumpkin latte, which I actually just had the other day in Toronto. I was like, this is the one I'm going to have this year. So anyways, great work by Gabriel Tasserav. And another one. Merry Christmas.
00:40:22.464 - 00:40:43.080, Speaker A: And so anyways, continuing the food theme, which I think is really cool. Only a Tezos 25 each. Some more generative art. Jason Artford. We looked at some of the work before this was just posted on Twitter. And so I thought this one also just totally stood out. And then I looked him up on effects hash.
00:40:43.080 - 00:41:23.784, Speaker A: He just put out this effects hash here, a series called Sputnik. And here is the series. So just I have to stop my apple speaker, which is talking to me. The host leaves the chair for the first time this entire series. I had to do that because I am not recording this again, otherwise the episode would end. So anyways, we're almost at the end. Some very interesting effects hash work here.
00:41:23.784 - 00:41:44.934, Speaker A: Just interesting to see what people are experimenting with. And that is the same artist, Jason Dartford. So he's got a few FX hash series here. And Zankan, also a people of Tezos work here that was posted today. So pretty nice work. And here are some physicals. I like this guy a lot.
00:41:44.934 - 00:42:10.774, Speaker A: Stefan Schwarzer. A very look at how great this looks, I don't know. What is it, Siebe? So that is screen print. So pretty nice. Quite a few colors here you see traveling through the mediums here. This looks like he made the original layers with crayon or pencil crayon or something, and then screen prints with that. That stuff just always looks great.
00:42:10.774 - 00:42:39.234, Speaker A: Here's another guy, Michael Weiss KOPPEL I thought, just an interesting work here. Looks like some spray paint is being used, graffiti. So these are previous works. This feels like a little bit of a breakthrough work here, doesn't it? So Michael Weiss KoPPel probably another german guy. And we've looked at John Rousse before. This is a guy who was doing physical works as nfTs, and they were selling quite well because they were so interesting. This is when we started talking about Francis Bacon.
00:42:39.234 - 00:43:08.318, Speaker A: He's got a slight kind of baconesque kind of look. So here's his work in the gallery, looking good. And here's wach, look at walk's spray painting here. So this is like a race. So this is also looking great. So a lot of great physical work here. And also Ollie Issykoski, another work by her, and she is experimenting with some two new works in progress.
00:43:08.318 - 00:43:20.204, Speaker A: I wonder if we have the other one here, too. So anyways, it's all looking good, Ollie. So looking forward to see how that turns out. And that, my friends, is your show. So thank you again for joining me. Until next time, take care.
