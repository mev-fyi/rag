00:00:03.120 - 00:00:28.996, Speaker A: I was just thinking if there was one message I would give my younger self is stop thinking so much and just do. And the reason I was thinking that is because it's a lesson I'm learning every day with every artwork, with every video. Stop thinking. You will never be 100% ready. Go. And that is all you can do. Otherwise, you make nothing.
00:00:28.996 - 00:00:48.380, Speaker A: Welcome back. Artist Journal, May 15, 2024. Broadcasting from the landscape in my mind, which right now looks like Tron. My name is Adrian Pokebelly, and welcome back. And PG 13. You know, hide the kids, I think. But, you know, I actually.
00:00:48.380 - 00:01:37.684, Speaker A: I think what's kind of hilarious about this risque work by machine, this masterpiece, I mean, this incredibly original work of art, which seems to be half photo, half, half transformed, half, you know, I want to say bedazzled, half bedazzled. It's. What's kind of amazing about it is actually, technically, we'll see what the censors do. We'll see if, you know, we'll see if this all uploads to the platforms. Otherwise, I, as well, will mint this on Zora, and we'll have a show on Zora. But all to say, this is, of course, machine who released this head turning work the other day and maybe yesterday. It is truly original.
00:01:37.684 - 00:02:03.266, Speaker A: And again, I'm not even sure. And again, this is on Zora. I'm not even sure, really how this was made. Like, is this airbrush? Is this photo. Is this something else? It has a nice texture to it, doesn't it? Is this a physical work? I do not know. From a content perspective, it's quite brilliant as well. It's edgy.
00:02:03.266 - 00:03:14.800, Speaker A: It's surprising, I think. Simple analysis here from a content perspective, I think of Dali soft, I guess what we could be tempted to call breasts here and here, the teeth of what looks like jaws, you know, colliding about to collide here, the hard and the soft, just like the curvilinear. And the rectilinear in Dali's persistence of memory, kind of a surreal juxtaposition, I would say a brilliant juxtaposition. And here, kind of hilariously, these long, elongated nails in the hand of these kind of outrageous, what look like almost clip on nails, these blue nails with, I have to say, this great green background here, this wonderful green background, which, as you can see here, has a little bit of a gradient at the bottom. Nice details. So this is a coarse machine with another head turning work. We're going to look at a few here.
00:03:14.800 - 00:03:50.200, Speaker A: This was minted on Zora yesterday. Already 39, minted, so already raking in the money here. And this is machine's page. Machine has started the show once, one other time, I think, with that awesome skateboard work and just consistently original and creative here, as you'll see. Well, here's just a quick kind of purview. Again, airbrush. A lot of the physical work is with airbrush, kind of edgy and risque and just incredibly original.
00:03:50.200 - 00:04:40.696, Speaker A: And this kind of interesting, you know, the female body seems to be definitely a major subject matter for machine, to state the obvious. And this is hilarious, too, this massive eyeball here, looking on at this wonderful kind of photoshop metamorphosis, for lack of better term, which you would think would actually be a horizontal image, but has been rendered vertical again, you wonder if the algorithms. Let's see what the algorithms do. I thought we cannot be slaves to the algorithm, is what I thought to myself. I was like, oh, is the show gonna get taken down by YouTube and whomever else? Maybe Twitter won't let me upload it. We're gonna find out. We cannot be slaves to these algorithms here especially.
00:04:40.696 - 00:05:08.140, Speaker A: What's kind of funny is technically, I don't think we're breaking any rules here, hilariously so. More hilarious. Again, there's something to be said for this pretty original, edgy piece here. 26, minted. Still available to mint as well for another eleven days on just what seems like an interesting Photoshop work. Here's another one, free Willy. If the sensors didn't take down the other ones, you might see it in the bottom area here.
00:05:08.140 - 00:05:35.368, Speaker A: But kind of, again, just kind of a fun, humorous, again, free willy, I guess. Is that the name of this? Yeah, the. Of course, maybe the whale, but maybe referring to something else. Again, hide the kids. So just kind of an awesome, awesome artwork here. Again, original. And there, I believe, is the artist herself in Italy, the great italian artists there.
00:05:35.368 - 00:06:02.310, Speaker A: Machine. And here's a few of the airbrush works that are on the Zora as well, just to finish the job. Kind of outrageously hilarious, right? This tank. And again with very prominent female body parts here. And again, almost. These clip on nails is like a thing, and look at even around, just having fun. And again, the airbrush and everything is that it's not a gallery.
00:06:02.310 - 00:06:24.928, Speaker A: The name of the gallery we've shown a million times here. And I remember machine was saying how I think it was during the pandemic I had never heard of. It's not a gallery. I think that's the name of the gallery. I think it was around the pandemic that she discovered this airbrush gallery, which is in her interview, which if you dig, you could probably find somewhere. It came out about a month or two ago. Here's another one, airbrush art.
00:06:24.928 - 00:07:07.454, Speaker A: So this is more, I assume, the physical artworks, very original style here. And you see the texture. Interestingly, I start to think of, is it bondozo, Bandido, Hermes, Emrique, if I remember the name right. Look at the watch humor everywhere, which I like a lot. And it kind of speaks to the Internet culture that maschine is providing a very original perspective on take on, you might say, airbrush on canvas, 60 by 70. Every token in this collection represents a physical artwork. And this is referring to the airbrush art section.
00:07:07.454 - 00:08:08.298, Speaker A: So anyways, just great to see a machine killing it with that first work there. A head turning work. I think what I love about it, this newspaper, the imagination, as I like to call it, I imagine those old kind of newspaper boxes on the street, or what do they call it? Eddie Cola, the newsstands in Italy or wherever, and just having that on the front, and I think it would be a head turning work. I think people would be just the person on the street. And I think like Max Ernst and, you know, in the 1910s or twenties, seeing de Chirico in that, you know, gallery, storefront window in the evening, I think walking with his dad and, you know, his life, the trajectory of his life forever changed. And, you know, so I think of a work like that, I don't know if it would forever change the trajectory of people's lives, but it definitely, maybe a few people would become artists out of that, out of that beautiful machine work. So all to say, let's continue here at Clownvamp.
00:08:08.298 - 00:08:35.884, Speaker A: I'm pleased to welcome back. Clownvamp, I think, is actually back for the third time. And I'm excited. It's almost. Clownvamp is very, very diligently on top of the AI art situation. And I don't know where we are right now in AI art, other than I keep seeing the works. But I'm very curious to hear what Clownvamp has to say about the latest software.
00:08:35.884 - 00:09:07.240, Speaker A: Like, in a sense, where the mind, where is AI art right now? I mean, that's maybe another way of. I could have titled this where is AI art featuring Clownvant. We'll call it recent developments in AI art, whatever you want to call it, should be interesting. That is the question I'm going to present to clownvamp this afternoon. So if you see this, it might be on live. Feel free to join the program, come on stage, ask a question yourself if you're curious or if you're skeptical, or whatever the case may be. So that should be awesome.
00:09:07.240 - 00:09:36.320, Speaker A: Now let's let me just actually reload this, because sometimes the comments don't come in fully unless you magnify first and then check the comments after Ugo Digi first. Thank you, Adrian. So we started the show, this beautiful original artwork with Ugo Digi. Awesome to hear from Hugo here. First. Thank you, Adrian, for sharing my latest experience or experiment on your show. Indeed, words were used as stamps or brushes.
00:09:36.320 - 00:10:16.874, Speaker A: Stamps, brushes, exactly. Because in the digital world, you can kind of turn a brush into a stamp, so to speak. Each frame was created pixel by pixel and is now saved in a file as a stamp. This allows me to reuse them by modifying them endlessly. I do everything with the same software, graphics two, by the way, and thank you for sharing. I actually assumed, because I think you were mentioning graphics two with those other beautiful, kind of used, for lack of a better term, interfaces, devices that are all linked up together with this beautiful retro software. I didn't know that drawing with words was part of an artistic movement from the 1970s.
00:10:16.874 - 00:10:41.272, Speaker A: Yeah, if memory serves. Again, I'm going based on visual recollection here of a show I saw at Hamburger Banoff in Berlin. I did a few searches. I couldn't find the artist's names escape me. It was like sketchbook works and this sort of thing. I'm curious to learn more, if you could share some names with me. So I will do that when I come across them, and I will do kind of searches here and there.
00:10:41.272 - 00:11:03.660, Speaker A: So if I do see them, I will definitely message you. But again, they do escape me right now. But there was definitely, you know, there's definitely been experimentation. I think it was kind of related to minimalism, concept art, which were kind of linked, kind of late sixties, early seventies, that kind of time. Talk to you soon. Indeed. Great to hear from you, Hugo and DJ Kiro.
00:11:03.660 - 00:11:49.430, Speaker A: This is pretty impressive. Thanks for showing my video game glitch. I keep the video game glitch clean with no effects, just the pure output from the back of the Sega Mega drive into a capture device. That is amazing, because as we were seeing with Kiro's glitch roms, they still get like almost, it looks like it's got a second process of the video kind of processing, but that is actually just the pure glitch. There is something to be said for the hardware version of Glitch where, you know, he's taking it. Most people are using the software. I would use the software, but there is Curo doing glitch for over, you know, around 15 years at least.
00:11:49.430 - 00:12:03.814, Speaker A: Since 2010 at least. And there he is tinkering with the hardware. Very impressive. And it looks, it makes it look quite different too. I still can see that snake, the Viper with the two heads. Beautiful. Thank you for sharing.
00:12:03.814 - 00:12:24.110, Speaker A: Curo. Stippin pixel thank you for presenting the collection. Energy artist support artists was curated by me and mariana ju so awesome to hear from you. Stippin pixel and yeah, looking very cool. Great to just see that, see that collection. So that's on Zora. So my absolute pleasure.
00:12:24.110 - 00:12:42.566, Speaker A: And some beautiful works there. And Sean FBGM, I'm not exactly sure what that means, but it kind of looks interesting. So thank you everybody for the comments. Also turning to Twitter, nice response again. 11,000. That is wonderful. Braindead great to hear from you.
00:12:42.566 - 00:12:54.790, Speaker A: Sider, thanks for the appearance. Great episode. Thank you sider. Always awesome to hear from you. Vinnie Hager GM excited to check this episode out. Awesome. Awesome, vinnie, great to hear from you too.
00:12:54.790 - 00:13:21.470, Speaker A: Lily illo great title for this episode. What's kind of funny about it is that kind of, you know, unusual title, the internal logic of impossible images is me actually trying to describe what that show, you know, the main thrust of the show, so to speak. So I find that hilarious that I'm glad other people liked it too. I thought it was kind of hilarious. I was like, that works for me. So anyways, thanks, Lily. Great to hear from you.
00:13:21.470 - 00:13:41.500, Speaker A: One of one broadcasting from deep within the Internet, which would, which some would say is like a nervous system. So great to hear from you, my friend. At one of one, my friends, Denise Sanchez, art great to hear from you. Ugo digi, thanks for the support. You're welcome. Hitsuono wonderful title. Reminded me of a beautiful paper by Penrose on impossible figures.
00:13:41.500 - 00:14:21.030, Speaker A: Penrose. I feel like I've heard of what is on the comb homology of impossible figures. That is hilarious. Roger Penrose, of course, mathematician, mathematical institute. Wow. So how cool is that? And you know what, this is kind of where I was going with it, which, like, what does this look like to you? This looks like an MC Escher, right? Which is actually, I just came from a major retrospective in Rome where it was at the Palazzo Bonaparte, where I think Napoleon's mum lived near, at Piazza Venezia there in Rome. For those who've been to Rome, and they had a wonderful show there, I think it goes for another few days.
00:14:21.030 - 00:15:20.596, Speaker A: Maybe it's about to end. If you're in Rome or nearby, it's worth seeing. And what I was trying to describe is how, like the artist, you know, instead of starting from mimesis, you might use, you know, or copying from the external world. As an artist, you're building a world, and so you use some copying, let's say as Ugo was with the fruits, you know, okay, here's a fruit, or as Escher does with, okay, I'll do a staircase. But then kind of aborting the process of mimesis. Then the artist starts using these elements to, you know, on using the logic of the, of using visual logic, using the logic of the canvas, so to speak, of the flat piece of paper and starting to work and starting to do what we might call the impossible, which is a great theme, by the way. It's a fun theme.
00:15:20.596 - 00:15:49.764, Speaker A: It's kind of a surrealist theme. I think Magritte might have a painting called the Impossible. Also, I think maybe Lotre amend the impossible is kind of a fun subject matter in the surrealist tradition as far as just a word that is used or concept that is celebrated. So when I see this, I think Escher, which is kind of where I'm coming from. So astute observation, my friend. Hitsuono, great to hear from you and also in the community here. Thank you, everybody, for posting.
00:15:49.764 - 00:16:04.012, Speaker A: Kitty, sit. New get up. Wake up. So looking like a cool physical here in the works. Thank you for posting. Legio X. Actually, I have a work of yours in the AI section, so thanks for posting.
00:16:04.012 - 00:16:25.906, Speaker A: It is getting on my radar. Just, it's great because I can't track everything. So I really appreciate people posting here. And awesome to hear from you. Filippo Francocci, with that beautiful physical work. A massive file, as Filippo was pointing out, Ernesto, with a work. And actually, I think this is also in kind of our abstract section.
00:16:25.906 - 00:16:39.696, Speaker A: So thank you, Ernesto. We'll take a closer look at that. Ilya Barabin, thank you for posting. Looks like a physical with some happy faces on it. A mask with happy faces. Almost looks like an inca mask or something, one of these sun masks. Very cool.
00:16:39.696 - 00:16:53.856, Speaker A: And philosoraptor, thank you for the rad digital artwork here. And yacht. Check it out. The greatness of reflection. Great to hear from yacht, too. So just very cool works in Sanro. Great to hear from you.
00:16:53.856 - 00:17:12.090, Speaker A: So awesome, everybody. Thank you. Onto our commentary here. Lonely Boyden. So interesting discussion here. Generative art was a huge thing in the 2021 bull run. And now, you know, we're always back to time.
00:17:12.090 - 00:17:32.720, Speaker A: Time is the ultimate currency. As well as the curls on my head, perhaps let's just. Yeah, forgive the hair. I think it's about t minus seven days until haircut, so it's going to be a challenge here. But it is happening. It is on the way. So thank you for your patience.
00:17:32.720 - 00:18:15.494, Speaker A: Let's look at this comment by lonely boy and 95% of the highest value generative art series from 2021 are not down in price because of the market. 95%. They are down in price because people realize the works aren't actually solid after doing 40 minutes of actual research into the medium two years later. Yeah, so generative art has never been a super focus here. But I find this interesting because it's a lesson in time, perhaps sorting this out now, maybe time will say, you know what, actually, all this stuff is wonderful. And the price goes back up, and who knows? But it is quite interesting. Quite.
00:18:15.494 - 00:18:35.468, Speaker A: Actually almost a scathing critique. Right. If you do a tiny bit of research, you'll realize that this stuff aren't solid. They were all acquired during a mania. I think nobody can disagree with this. 2021 was arguably the biggest financial speculative mania in history. Arguably.
00:18:35.468 - 00:19:11.970, Speaker A: I don't think that's a crazy statement where almost no big collectors educated themselves on what they were buying. It also doesn't help that almost any thread that went viral was about the price and historical aspect. Look, mom, it was minted first. And this is a hilarious part of the blockchain speculative system. If it's first, it must be more important. And sometimes there's something to be said for that. But sometimes it can be an overrated way of doing things, and you can tell people are just looking to do something first in order to cash in.
00:19:11.970 - 00:19:57.978, Speaker A: When most of the series were following algorithms, one of ones created decades ago, one to one, we're creating algorithms that were identical to ones created decades ago, I think is what they're saying. So lonely boy saying some of the generative art, according to Lonely Boy. And again, I'm not an expert, but I think it's an interesting discussion that's going on here. I actually want to make. I'm starting to have a kind of a. Now that generative art isn't like front and center, I'm kind of actually wanting to make a generative art series just for the hell of it. So, lonely boy saying a lot of these things were done before most, creating renditions that didn't actually push anything forward emotionally, contextually, or aesthetically.
00:19:57.978 - 00:20:44.830, Speaker A: Nobody is going to shake me on this opinion. You're not going to convince me works meant in 2021 from algorithms created decades ago were worth millions? Never. This is a common criticism. You do hear of digital art on the blockchain, which is that it sometimes is historically not the strongest, not the mind share, but the perspective is not necessarily super historical. And even for digital art, I find what I loosely call the first generation of digital art, I find it a little dry. So I'm not going through books, you know, looking at. I find, honestly, I've found generative art just from a personal, and that has nothing, no judgment.
00:20:44.830 - 00:21:14.096, Speaker A: And I want to make a generative art, you know, series, but I've always found it a touch. It's not really my thing. It's a little machine heavy, so to speak. It's not. So I like the human, but I want to still see what I can do with this thing. So I'm open minded about it. But all to say, so let's just finish the thought here, and let's not even get into the horrible practices and lack of integrity a few of the biggest artists had where they knew they were taking advantage of others ideas and then tried to blacklist artists they literally stole from.
00:21:14.096 - 00:21:56.760, Speaker A: Well, it wouldn't shock me. Furthermore, any validation, but I have no idea, and I don't know who lonely boy is talking about here. Furthermore, any validation on the top end that was used as a promotional tool came from Sotheby's and Christie's, where the main goal is to take advantage of memetic flow and to follow money like bloodhounds. And there is so much money on the line that even still, that Sotheby's and Christie's, they're just businesses trying to capture money. So it's quite interesting to see, only three years later, I mean, this is 2021, that it's funny how time really does its work. Like, you can't avoid it. It's kind of like we're all subject to time.
00:21:56.760 - 00:22:51.046, Speaker A: So just kind of an interesting comment here on the generative art side of things. And here's we have price, which are kind of often the two main things that are kind of competing for what makes an artwork important or the measure of importance, actually, price probably being the main one, but I'd argue time is the ultimate one, right? But time is harder to measure. Price has an immense place in art, considering most collectors influencers use it as a metric alongside historic narratives and institutional, not actually institutions, even just auction houses, to prop up the marketing to boost their bags and community wide validation of something. So lonely boy has had enough lonely boy is not buying anything anymore, conceptually speaking. Kind of fed up. And yes, it's true, the higher the price of something, the more in human nature do people start to believe it may actually be valuable in its artistic merit. Yeah, social proof.
00:22:51.046 - 00:23:19.056, Speaker A: If someone else, you know, it's the classic example, the review on Amazon, you might go to the product thinking, oh, that's okay. And then you read ten reviews saying how incredible the product is, get out of my way, I have to buy this. Now that is social proof. Incredibly powerful marketing. And you could argue price is a form of social proof. If everybody's spending $700 for this or $700,000 for an artwork, all of a sudden people start to think, well, that's what it's worth. Other people are doing.
00:23:19.056 - 00:24:13.138, Speaker A: It taps into a very deep part of, you know, arguably human instincts, or at least human social instincts. We can certainly enjoy the experience, but not acknowledging where the art actually stands and the whole of a medium, and at the same time, praising it to high regard is actually demeaning, especially when the ones who did that were the loudest and most listened to in the room while not really knowing much about the medium to begin with. What I like is names aren't mentioned here, which makes it easier to discuss. So just interesting comments from lonely boy, August ground, coinbase, systemwide outage. That's unnerving. Don't worry, though, your funds and nfts are safe, so maybe tongue in cheek there from August ground. And it does make you wonder, because of course, base now, did I wonder if Coinbase goes down? Does base go down? It's an interesting question, isn't it? Base is kind of like my understanding of it.
00:24:13.138 - 00:24:34.790, Speaker A: It's quite centralized, like binance smart chain was, where it works really fast, it's really cheap, but basically it's centralized. That's the, you know, the part of the trilemma that is compromised. Anyways, very interesting. Still need to put workout on base. So just kind of interesting comment. Another interesting comment just on blockchains here. Jason Fang.
00:24:34.790 - 00:25:18.360, Speaker A: Bullish on the whole, I think layer ones on bitcoin, which I am as well, not financially advice, but I just find it a very interesting area. The most interesting quote I heard from bitcoin conference Asia Ethereum is bitcoin L2. So simple and on point. I don't know if this is true or not, or, you know, the context and everything, but I agree it's an, it's a provocative point, which is why I share it here. Interesting way, perspective, shall we say this? I just didn't know what to make of. If anybody knows what this is, I'm curious. So neuroweb AI, which is part of origin trailhead, which is a supply chain blockchain, pretty well known, been around for a while.
00:25:18.360 - 00:25:44.364, Speaker A: Many artists have effectively safeguarded their artwork using origin trail DKG. And we're now concluding the knowledge mint mining beta program for art. The miners to receive neuro rewards are announced, plus, any origin trail themed art gets bonus rewards. So I have no idea. Art knowledge mining leaderboard. So I'm just pointing this out. If anybody knows what this is.
00:25:44.364 - 00:26:12.670, Speaker A: Kind of curious. So just kind of highlighting it here in case it actually relates to what we're doing here. Eile. I don't know who needs to hear this, but overheard at the coffee shop, a jujutsu guy telling some that telling someone that getting the black belt isn't the time to retire. It is the time to push even farther because you're just getting started. Totally agree with this thought and I'm glad you posted aile. A very interesting comment and I totally agree.
00:26:12.670 - 00:26:40.950, Speaker A: You know what I my analogy for this is being in the gym. You're in the class, you are 40 minutes, 30 minutes into the class, you're exhausted, and then all of a sudden, you get your second win. And all of a sudden, you're just kind of re, you know what I call escape velocity. And all of a sudden, you're kind of back in form. You're exhausted, but you're energetic. The power of the mind, almost an inspiration. And I totally agree with this thought.
00:26:40.950 - 00:26:59.090, Speaker A: As an artist, if you're at the height of your powers, now is not the time to. You get all the way up to the mountain. Now is the time to, like, turbo charge, right? And put out a ton of work. It's not time to put up your feet. So just kind of an inspiring comment from Ilay, shared by Ilay here. Check it out. Haiti Rockette.
00:26:59.090 - 00:27:12.820, Speaker A: Uh, fine. Yeah, finally landed on Zora. No proper nick, maybe nickname, but it's okay. Hope Zora will fix this. Watch out for fakes. So very cool. A Haiti rocket.
00:27:12.820 - 00:27:33.072, Speaker A: The great Haiti rocket appears on Zora. And I think it's part of this energy artist support artists. So one of the works. We didn't see this one yesterday. Just a classic Haiti rocket laptop here with all these wonderful. It's almost a celebratory Haiti rocket here on Zora. And the check mark and everything.
00:27:33.072 - 00:27:58.100, Speaker A: 53 minted so far. Nice work, Zora. Zora continues to really make inroads here it's taken a little bit, you know, for lack of bear term of mind share from the entire art blockchain ecosystem. It continues to grow. Interestingly, I think it's because it continues to pay the artists, like artists keep making money. They have this huge community. They share the rewards quite well with the artist.
00:27:58.100 - 00:28:13.284, Speaker A: Braindead. This is awesome. Proud to announce that I am officially registered as an artist on super rare. This is great. Thanks to Ann Loremy for inviting me in. So isn't that cool? And what a cool graphic from Braindead. So congrats to braindead.
00:28:13.284 - 00:28:28.208, Speaker A: What a year for braindead. Ups and downs and everything. Congrats. Go go lightest. Look at how cool this looks. I love it when. Because artists do pfps, right? Because it's just a different way of.
00:28:28.208 - 00:28:42.504, Speaker A: It's on opensea. Cool. I guess it's on base. Look how cool this looks. And go go lightest just does a very nice job. The public sale will commence in an hour, so I think this already started. Marks the start of go go emoji circle.
00:28:42.504 - 00:29:00.030, Speaker A: And so we'll give that a follow. Already 647 followers. Start. I guess this is what you do when you do a PFP project. You start another Google or x account and maybe you start a discord. And so all very cool lives on base. So congrats to Gogo.
00:29:00.030 - 00:29:26.126, Speaker A: And here. So these are just works, I think made on Michael Macasso's mech TXT's website. Let me invite you to my garden. So other people having fun with this kind of, you know, tile video game, you know, for me, reminiscent of Ultima. Four here, structures here, bone garden. Cheers, Michael McCasle. Here's another one by KF.
00:29:26.126 - 00:29:56.800, Speaker A: Quite beautiful works. And again, these kind of scream and shout screen printing. Maybe even rezo the white, you'd probably need screen printing. I don't think you can do white and rezo unless if you really want to mess with people's minds the way you would do it. And this is fun. When you start doing that, instead of using purple colored paper, you use white paper. And then you'd put purple all over here and then the black and then let the white just be negative space.
00:29:56.800 - 00:30:19.132, Speaker A: There are all sorts of interesting ways of dealing with white paper. I've actually gone so far. God, I don't know. I kind of want to bring it up. I've gone so far. Let me see if I can bring this up really quickly here because I don't know if I'm going to be able to find this. I've changed the background color of my website.
00:30:19.132 - 00:30:36.100, Speaker A: I'm actually completely going to change my website here. There's something I want to show you, though, with this whole idea. And I'm completely redoing my website, by the way. So all of this stuff is. This is kind of the old version. And I think we're getting close. I hope we're getting close here.
00:30:36.100 - 00:30:56.420, Speaker A: We're getting closer. This is starting to get very close. I think, actually, this is. Okay, so this is kind of what I'm talking about here. This one, too. This was actually, this looks like it's done on white paper, right? This was done on orange paper. And what I did, as you can see here, it's kind of blending through.
00:30:56.420 - 00:31:41.858, Speaker A: And what you can see here is I actually took white acrylic marker and I painted the margin, or I colored the margin with white acrylic marker to make it look like a white piece of paper, just to mess with the viewers mind, because then they're going like, what is going on here? This looked like. How is this made? How is this orange made? If this is a white piece of paper? This is not a white piece of paper. This is an orange piece of paper that is point that is painted on and then ink jetted over top, and then some acrylic marker and even some paint with gel over top. And then finally the white is painted over the orange paper. Right. I think I did the same thing here. I did with.
00:31:41.858 - 00:32:14.258, Speaker A: It's been a while with, you see, this is, this is the color of the paper here. And then I painted, you can even see it there. And I painted the margins here. So all to say, you know, you can start to think of interesting, or you'd color this in you go multimedia here. Rather than going screen or with, let's say you did rezo for the purple, or do a purple piece of paper, do black, rizo or even inkjet. You could fill in the rest with, like, acrylic white marker, which is opaque enough. You know, do a couple of layers.
00:32:14.258 - 00:32:28.138, Speaker A: It's opaque enough. Interesting. Here's another one. Green ginger runes of the cool guy. Very cool. And again, just shouts ultima to my mind here. Ultima, four tile set.
00:32:28.138 - 00:32:44.154, Speaker A: Beautiful, but different. But yeah, we can see it in the grass, we can see it in the bricks. And almost this snake here. Different aspect ratio, though, I do believe. Anyways, super, super cool. To help myself there from cursing. Super cool.
00:32:44.154 - 00:33:13.640, Speaker A: Look at this. Another masterpiece here. So we saw, like, I mean, imagine a show with machine that first work, kind of a head turning work. And then you have this, you know, provocative, wildly brilliant work by walk. I remember actually doing the same subject matter at some point. This is done in art school, actually in Saskatchewan, University of Saskatchewan. And, God, the early two thousands, late 1990s.
00:33:13.640 - 00:33:30.740, Speaker A: This is ten times better, though. The execution lady D crash. So a tragic thing, event. There's walkable. What a painting. What a brilliant painting. Just provocative and just.
00:33:30.740 - 00:33:59.680, Speaker A: It just brings so many emotions and it's like you can't even english them, to quote McKenna. It's just a brilliant, brilliant artwork. And here's another one. Walk is, again, I hesitate to say it because I want to do this myself. If you can get these physicals for like a. Can't think of a better investment, frankly. And this is not investment advice, it's not financial advice.
00:33:59.680 - 00:34:25.842, Speaker A: They always say, I can't think of a better investment, at least in the arts, than to get a wok for €100. And I totally don't want to say that, but that's just how I. Because I want to buy them myself. And now maybe it's going to be harder, but that's totally how I feel. Look at this brilliant work based on the Caravaggio that is in Gemelda gallery here. Painting gallery is the translation. Gemelda in Berlin, I would argue.
00:34:25.842 - 00:34:47.300, Speaker A: A very risque artwork, by the way, this original by Caravaggio. I'm not even going to show it. I wonder if it should be shown to. That's how risque I suspect it is. Anyways, here's a brilliant rendition of this provocative artwork by Caravaggio. Brilliant, brilliant homage here. Just brilliant by walk.
00:34:47.300 - 00:35:06.152, Speaker A: Is there any comment there? Amor Vincent. Love conquers all. Love conquers all. So a few more. I think this contest is wrapping up here on object paint 98. So Tornado Rodriguez. So I have a few more, again playing off of the Microsoft paint 98 software.
00:35:06.152 - 00:35:37.430, Speaker A: So this is quite a moving piece, I found. The hardest thing is that she will never come back. And this seems to be, I think, the Tornado Rodriguez figure here maybe relating to Mother's Day, I don't know, but quite a moving, moving, moving work here. I don't know what's going on here, but you almost see, like Mother's Day flowers. That's the tempting to be the interpretation here. All to say until tomorrow. Time to say goodbye for now.
00:35:37.430 - 00:35:59.800, Speaker A: One of one and not listed. Beautiful work from Tornado Rodriguez. Cowgirl new one from Katarina create. This series, I think is totally awesome that Katarina create has put together. This is a third one. This is an edition of ten and two gone so far. And as you'll see here, Katarina has three in this series.
00:35:59.800 - 00:36:11.476, Speaker A: Very cool series by Katarina. Create using object 98. Here's another one. Daniel W. Edition of one. What did this sell for? 25 tezos. Nice sale.
00:36:11.476 - 00:36:25.900, Speaker A: So a classic Daniel W. Character and illustration. Devil 98. Kind of hilarious. Here's mess 98. So a different kind of work, almost looking like a kind of maze of sorts with different characters. Just having fun.
00:36:25.900 - 00:36:54.540, Speaker A: Addition of 15 selling for two tezos each and few still available. And here's another one. So the second Bob Ross work, wet on wet, my second submission for Ms paint 98 art. This time I drew a little bit more detailed version of one of Bob Ross's wet on wet paintings. So actually using Bob Ross, an actual painting by Bob Ross as the source, only used a mouse as I always did in the nineties. Very cool. So very fun.
00:36:54.540 - 00:37:06.924, Speaker A: Ao and there's a signature. And one more. I thought this was quite original. A white swan. This is by someone called non arts. Theme of Swan. Enjoying the beauty of the morning view by swimming on a calm lake.
00:37:06.924 - 00:37:37.426, Speaker A: So nice use of different brushes here in object 98 or, you know, Microsoft paint 98. Beautiful kind of nature scene. Very cool. So on to the next part of the next part of the show, I guess. But the object paint 98, I guess, was part of this part of the show. Anyways, waffles, or should I say Kuji? Look at this when you zoom in. Very, very cool.
00:37:37.426 - 00:38:04.630, Speaker A: And one of these were sent to me. I actually found it online. Know where I found it? I found it in Santiago's collection. When I was looking at a Santiago work, I was like, oh, what's Santiago collecting? I do that with certain artists just to see what I cover my blind spots. And I was like, wow. Kujib has minted a work, Kujib Shiro. And it goes for 20 with an audio for 20 minutes.
00:38:04.630 - 00:38:53.290, Speaker A: And of course, if you remember, this was Kujib, this epic rock and roll kind of punk rock work here by the great waffles under the banner of Kujib. And here we have the audio for this. Beautifully textured. You just have to love the pixels in here and the different pixels. And I think the audio is from the nineties. Looks like kind of cutting and pasting different softwares here. I mean, just awesome.
00:38:53.290 - 00:39:32.916, Speaker A: Look at this. It reminds me, this reminds me of those, uh, you know, modern art documentaries where they show the Picasso and the strong music comes out. Like, I mean, it's kind of got the same vibe when you're playing that music and looking at this work, you can just imagine them doing this. Maybe 50 years from now, that's what they'll be doing. That will hide cassette. Cool title. And here's the audio equipment, I think ambrasier, cocolazze Piya 9700 and Tascam Porta studio, which maybe is a tape, a four track tape recorder or something.
00:39:32.916 - 00:39:48.440, Speaker A: Tascam was well known for these kind of recording devices. Tape recording 2009. So very cool. So one owned. So thank you. So I actually had it here and then all of a sudden I was like, oh, one owned. So thank you, Kujeb, for the work.
00:39:48.440 - 00:40:18.992, Speaker A: Awesome. And just beautiful, beautiful work. Here's murepixel. Miripixel continues to dazzle here with these incredibly wild and original and fun and tempting to say, somewhat pioneering works here. Kind of a simple GiF animation here, too. Kind of looks like a manga anime figure and some computers in the background. Different renderings here.
00:40:18.992 - 00:40:42.234, Speaker A: You have some dithering at the bottom here. It looks like it's almost kind of smushed a little bit. The pixels, very interesting work here. Again, bit of an acquired taste, but once you start to understand this artist, it starts to become quite something that's on base. A reserve of 0.05. And this was an awesome one. Devgirl one.
00:40:42.234 - 00:40:53.050, Speaker A: Is this Dev girl two? Oh, this is Devgirls. Here's Devgirls. Okay, so that's part of a series. So interesting work here. Very, very interesting. We've looked at a couple. Look at these big pixels.
00:40:53.050 - 00:41:18.834, Speaker A: Looks like, again, reprocessing effects. This looks like cycled effects. Like you put it through once, you put it through again, that's what it looks like. Martin Bruce, I'm not sure if this is new or not, this Martin Bruce work, but it was definitely a head turner and I had to include it just in case. It's new. Beautiful textures here. Nice kind of cycling, you know, it's pretty impressive.
00:41:18.834 - 00:41:42.608, Speaker A: This is what I think to myself when I look at this. Martin Bruce is able to make, like a symmetrical artwork and make it interesting. Like, I find that impressive, because usually if it's too symmetrical, it's not as interesting. This is interesting. So nice. Again, just immer surprising. Immer ein Uberashen, as they say in German.
00:41:42.608 - 00:41:55.058, Speaker A: Well, I don't know if they say that, but always, that's my translation. Always a surprise. Rinnefish on object soon. So, a little preview. Let's see if this plays. Maybe there is. This is it.
00:41:55.058 - 00:42:08.190, Speaker A: So very cool work here. Can't wait to see. This is probably a close up. There we go. There is the animation here. So a close up likely look at the volcano. Just awesome.
00:42:08.190 - 00:42:39.940, Speaker A: The fire on the volcano just kind of breathing these orcset breathe so on object soon with Chris Warp, who, by the way, I found out Chris messaged me, was actually like a pretty well known electronic music producer. Like he was saying Carl Cox. And, you know, I think I've heard of him, let's put it this way. Played the records and everything. Like, I think I've heard of this guy. So hilarious. The world is smaller than you think sometimes.
00:42:39.940 - 00:43:15.504, Speaker A: I mean, that's Rooney fish on with, I think Chris war on objects soon. Maybe a collab in the works there. Ed Marolla, master of light. So interesting work as ever from Ed. This is full size here. And again you get this beautiful kind of textured, you know what I'm tempted to call textured pixel art with these skeletons that are drawn and interestingly, provocatively, courageously, this light here shining across, you know, breaking rules. And here's a little devil figure.
00:43:15.504 - 00:43:36.960, Speaker A: And here you see kind of some soft brushes. Kind of looks like procreate is being in the mix. And of course it is procreate and aseprite, that is. Yeah. So mixing softwares, exporting incredibly powerful. Because all of a sudden I look, you know, all of a sudden the viewer looks at this and goes, they don't understand how it's made. Right.
00:43:36.960 - 00:44:14.976, Speaker A: That's almost, we're almost back to that. Me coloring the white of the margin of that work, because all of a sudden it's like confusing. It helps confuse the viewer, which I think there's something to be said for that where if you don't know how it's made, it just becomes this. We were talking about the aura the other day. Someone was mentioning the aura of physical artwork. Creates a bit more of an aura because it's like, what is this mystery? What is this? Very great work from Edmarrola? Let's just look at edition of twelve and sold out at three Tezos. So the art continues to move out here in Tezos land.
00:44:14.976 - 00:44:45.518, Speaker A: And also on base, Atadura. This is by Gozo, minted on May 11. Another beautiful. Another beautiful AI digital collage. I want to say the reason I put it here rather than in the AI section and look at these great pixels is because although AI is a component here, I still feel like there is a very heavy hand. The artist's hand seems to be heavier than the AI here. There seems to be a very conscious.
00:44:45.518 - 00:45:10.734, Speaker A: It's almost like using AI as a kind of brush of sorts, I'm tempted to say. And look at this awesome door, this wild composition. Gozo edition of 20, digital collage, Atadura. And what is going on here? 1277 sold out, I think. Or no, we have a few left here. Six left, still 14 gone. Enough.
00:45:10.734 - 00:45:18.454, Speaker A: 1914 continues to sell out. Really interesting piece here. Borde. Or is this. No, this is still available. Wow. Ten tezos.
00:45:18.454 - 00:45:39.136, Speaker A: And so this figure here that we've been seeing a lot of. And NUv 1914 is super prolific. We're seeing more of this figure. Enter. It almost reminds me of Loplop with Max Ernst, where the bird from Ernst unconscious started to leak into the paintings. It started to find its way into the paintings. There's almost a kind of similar idea here.
00:45:39.136 - 00:46:09.778, Speaker A: This figure just starts to appear and when you're making a lot of work, you can start to embrace this stuff. So, November 1914, edition of one for ten tezos. Another edition of one, this one sold to Klaus for ten tezos. Really nice piece here too. Nice color, nice contrast, wild. Kind of almost like reminding me of zvoso there. So I was asking Dan, is it the same artist? Because sometimes because they've collaborated and kind of.
00:46:09.778 - 00:46:22.186, Speaker A: They're. Sometimes they're both gradient artists. Dan's a gradient artist. He's like, no, they're two different people. So that is good to know. Isla de dia. They could definitely do aaa show together, though, in a show and that would be epic.
00:46:22.186 - 00:46:47.110, Speaker A: So here again, addition of one by NUV 1914 requiredos three edition of one. And this is also tentezos and still available in the figure. This wild, wild figure shows up again, these outrageous works here by Nev 1914. Just awesome. We're actually not making bad time here today. I brought in one more just for the edginess. Bale solo.
00:46:47.110 - 00:47:12.968, Speaker A: Look at this. I mean, look at the, you know, experimentation with abandon, like not worrying, pushing aesthetic frontiers. You know, like the first time you see it, you're just like not sure. And I ask myself the 10th time I see this, will I be like, this is brilliant. And even look at these awesome, you know, circular gradients here. I just love the courage of this artist. Uri J.
00:47:12.968 - 00:47:33.358, Speaker A: Picking it up. Nice vote of confidence there for ten tezos edition of one. Here's Pamela Cirone. Awesome to see Pamela. I wonder if this is a physical, just based on what looks like light here, but I can't tell. Maybe that's color. This almost looks physical, doesn't it? So great to just see Pamela Cirone in Buenos Aires.
00:47:33.358 - 00:47:48.820, Speaker A: And here's Tim Romanowski. Good morning. So this might be an older work. Not sure. Tempting to almost think this is. I can't tell if this is AI, abstract art, so probably not. This looks like an abstract painting.
00:47:48.820 - 00:48:02.660, Speaker A: Nice original artwork. I think we've seen Tim Romanowski before. And what kind of lecturer? Abstract artist and animator. Director, lecturer, abstract artist and animator. Very cool. Let's continue here. Ratclok.
00:48:02.660 - 00:48:36.670, Speaker A: See ratcloak self portrait 2024. So here we have the goofy figure. And there, Ratcloak. And so, yeah, so a beautiful digital painting here, as you see. Almost the drips of a certain kind of sort, or the marks kind of just randomly spreading across. And even this really cool signature here, self portrait edition of 1200 tazos, still available. Closed club executed Renaissance.
00:48:36.670 - 00:49:00.058, Speaker A: So we saw this on Twitter, I think, yesterday, minted by ratcloak on superwear. So doing a bit of a double mint here or not a double mint. A minting two works at the same time, one on object, one on super rare. It'll be interesting to see if there's a difference in how the market treats them. So another interesting. So we saw this work yesterday, digital painting with the smell of oil and crypto decadence. Executed Renaissance.
00:49:00.058 - 00:49:15.476, Speaker A: So again, minting two works simultaneously. NFT poems about. NFT poems about misfortune. Beautiful words here. One of one cycle, Ratcloak 24. Very cool. And the last pint, also minted.
00:49:15.476 - 00:49:39.730, Speaker A: So Ratcloak putting out a ton of work here. This is an edition of one selling for 100 tezos to Roerich, great collector there on the tezos blockchain. So very cool. Nice pickup by Roerich for interesting cutoff of the bottle there. The last pint, dark work. And shout out to Ratcloak in Ukraine. Turkarak portrait.
00:49:39.730 - 00:50:22.296, Speaker A: Cool portrait. Could hang in the same room as this. Ratcloak kind of has a similar. You know, it's almost like the silence we were talking about, how the silence that some art creates, like we were talking about at the start, where, like the start of these modern art documentaries, where they show the Picasso and then the heavy music comes in, the dramatic symphony comes in. There's also a weird silence that some art kind of creates. And I'd argue the rat cloaks this portrait that sometimes you feel when you're in the museum, the silence you feel in museums, so to speak, in the museum. Some of these works are creating that vibe here.
00:50:22.296 - 00:50:37.530, Speaker A: So, interesting portrait by Turkarak. I wonder. Self portrait, not sure, just portrait. Another really cool work that kind of goes with the same vibe. Pee pee universal. And it has a hilarious title. Let me just zoom in here.
00:50:37.530 - 00:50:58.656, Speaker A: So this looks like a digital painting. This looks like a digital painting. Not sure the software. Great composition, great kind of mark making, hilarious title. When you realize she wasn't flirting with you, that can happen. Seven tazos and edition of five. So beautiful work, beautiful color.
00:50:58.656 - 00:51:17.272, Speaker A: And just having fun here with the teeth. And even. Even that is cool. Almost like graphite on the painting. And there's something just kind of, again, kind of museum esque about these last few works here. Even here, like, what is going on? All you need is love the myth. Back on the scene here.
00:51:17.272 - 00:51:33.300, Speaker A: And again, you can see it looks like a procreate work, if I had to guess. And kind of an edgy work here with the tongue. And then the green and pink and the lemonhead mass. You wonder if it's the same person. All you need is love. Edition of ten for 20 tazos. Two sold so far.
00:51:33.300 - 00:51:52.544, Speaker A: Here is the taste. Red on green. Red is the blood, green is the cloth of freedom to taste. 2024. So someone playing pool, and there is a shadow. Cool experimentation here. There is a boxer, almost like the label of a beer can or something.
00:51:52.544 - 00:52:21.800, Speaker A: Not sure. We will always love you. And interesting line work here with the pool playing with the angles of the pool game. So interesting work from detaste. Let's just actually see three tazos edition of ten and three gone so far. There's Oxine and Mikey Wilson and L'inquisitore. You really see how small this scene is sometimes when you see that Seba Sestero, who of course I follow, is.
00:52:21.800 - 00:53:03.456, Speaker A: I love this work, this tennis game. Again, I'm just kind of a fan of sports, the drama of sports, and just really interesting, beautiful work here. Kind of like a cubist to a certain loosely, very, very loosely, in the sense of multiple angles at once or simultaneous narrative, but kind of just this visual impression, you know, of tennis. So cool work by Seba Sestero, published on X. Happier than ever. Astrakarma. We were just talking about this artist, I think, with Tornado Rodriguez on the spaces.
00:53:03.456 - 00:53:17.250, Speaker A: I was wondering what had happened to Astra. Karma. Still on the scene, minting something on tazos. Looks like a happy meal. Very cool. Happier than ever. How long are you going to hide behind this old facade? And so just a very, what I call contemporary illustration.
00:53:17.250 - 00:53:45.442, Speaker A: One of the categories, I'd argue there's about seven or eight categories that you can kind of put everything into loosely, I would say, I don't say that with super strong, but I'd say with loose, loosely and contemporary illustration is one. And I'd put this in that category. A lot of tornadoes work I'd put in that category. Contemporary digital illustration. Let's continue here. Edition of 20, only atezos, only one sold. So cool work.
00:53:45.442 - 00:54:13.052, Speaker A: Buy Astra's work so that she makes more. Here is dam base. Liminal voyage. Just a cool work I found on X here. Kind of interesting combination of illustration and then kind of some GiF animation up here. Black and white, kind of has a print feel to it, but on. But definitely a but animation with it, where the ineffable becomes tangible and the boundaries of existence blur.
00:54:13.052 - 00:54:28.442, Speaker A: So dreamwalker sagas, liminal voyage and five minted so far, that's on Zora. Another work on Zora. What I never said. Santiago Rua. Oh, so this is an open edition of offer. Two tezos each. Beautiful work here.
00:54:28.442 - 00:54:50.030, Speaker A: And again, kind of this asymmic writing, seemingly letters that don't seem to mean anything. What I never said, like perfect title, edition of seven, only two tezos, and it looks like there is one left or sorry. This is an open edition. That is how it works. And here's salawaki. These are my hands, hold them. I thought, kind of a cool work here.
00:54:50.030 - 00:55:04.896, Speaker A: Just interesting. Kind of shouted out at me on the feed here. So just cool work from Salawaki of hands. Interesting portrayal. Here is verkanter niemand. Wavy, curly, noisy. He's beautiful.
00:55:04.896 - 00:55:36.294, Speaker A: Beautifully delicate. Almost has a bit of a jellyfish sort of vibe to it. Wavy, curly, noisy. So just interesting works here. Tempted to call them abstracts. And here is 2002, who I loosely call 2002, but maybe 200,002 expo 46. Kind of a fun looking kind of modern art, abstract looking work, but it is pixel art, arguably, or at least very kind of lower resolution computer art.
00:55:36.294 - 00:56:04.576, Speaker A: Quite beautiful and quite fun. This is on Zora, only two minted with 29 days to go, so just released cloud by element ly. So going with how many colors here we got the background color, we got this darker blue, and we got black. So three colors here, 256 by 256. We're living in an Internet heaven, and we fly like cloud computing. Part of the 45 works which will be shown at expanded art in Berlin. So maybe I have to check that out.
00:56:04.576 - 00:56:18.580, Speaker A: Opening on May 14 for all berliners. And there it is. So that could be super interesting. Maybe we'll see some of the physicals there. That would be amazing. Asylum 2027. So popple edition of 27.
00:56:18.580 - 00:56:44.940, Speaker A: So beautiful new work by popple, again, combining pixel art, you know, two color pixel art with generative art. Amazingly, you know, with the. See it with the hearts. Maybe the screensaver here, maybe in there. Pretty amazing how popple can do that. And look at these very complicated, detailed structures here. Kind of alien looking asylum.
00:56:44.940 - 00:57:05.686, Speaker A: Pretty rad, isn't it? The blockchain war is over, but the struggle is never ending. Just kind of suggestive description. Asylum 2027. Maybe this is after Tezos is supposed to disappear in 2027, as the meme goes. Or the joke. Cool work by popple. Let's just see.
00:57:05.686 - 00:57:21.786, Speaker A: I think it's taking offers. Over 20 tezos, I think, is what's going on. And the offers are coming in, coming in strong for popple. Edition of 27. Scroll into despair. This is Daenerys with a cool work here again on Zora. Cool.
00:57:21.786 - 00:57:51.452, Speaker A: Just kind of animated pixel art or pixel esque scroll into despair. Falling off of a building here. Here's another animated illustration by Sameha. Drowning in time. Kind of a similar kind of vibe here. Those could show probably next to each other. And here we see the hourglass with the person drowning in what looks like red blood, but who knows? Generic.
00:57:51.452 - 00:58:22.500, Speaker A: Click. Ok. Kind of an interesting piece just posted on Twitter here. You know, this is kind of something we've seen with euxine, something I've mentioned here previously, which is here you have a rooster. It is portrayed in several different ways as an artist. Are you going to mint every different one? Are you going to pick one? What if you don't want to decide? What if you like them all? What do you do? This is one solution. You show them all in a gif, basically.
00:58:22.500 - 00:58:46.996, Speaker A: I find kind of an interesting solution, because each one, each frame of that Gif could be its own, you know, physical artwork, for example. They all look good, don't they? Very interesting generousness. Cool work. Here's green Ginger. Terrarium inception. I don't think we've seen this. This is an edition of 14.
00:58:46.996 - 00:59:02.528, Speaker A: Again, I found this in Santiago's collection, I believe so. Cool artwork here. Cool, cool pixel artwork by green Ginger. And there it is. Santiago, indeed. So, two tazos. Nice piece.
00:59:02.528 - 00:59:17.120, Speaker A: Great color. Here's another one by Greenger. An evening's relief. Cool as the day. Echoes fade into the dusk's embrace. So how beautiful is that? Beautifully rendered. Seems to have about three different speeds here.
00:59:17.120 - 00:59:33.750, Speaker A: The background, the foreground, the middle ground. And the foreground with the train. And then the train moving on top. Ambitious animation, actually. Three tazos edition of 20 mech picking one up. Gogolitis. Can't ask for better collectors than that.
00:59:33.750 - 01:00:01.256, Speaker A: Rakuin Ch, you've reached the checkpoint. But what's on your mind recently? I love the minimal quality of this. Let's just do straight up dithering as a sky. And then this kind of pixel artwork from this artist I haven't seen before, or I hadn't really put it this way. I hadn't seen on object before on the blockchain, I don't think. But here on Instagram, there's a few. There are a few pixel artists on Instagram that you don't see on the blockchain.
01:00:01.256 - 01:00:17.888, Speaker A: Interestingly, here's a beautiful one by braindead. Feelings incorporated. Definitely a head turner. Awesome piece. Great color. So braindead again on super rare now, awesomely. And there's the video camera again, kind of this pixel art factory sort of vibe.
01:00:17.888 - 01:00:45.260, Speaker A: And look, the printer going in, and then you see all of the motions. And maybe, you know, getting this projection going, so to speak, or of the horse, or it actually looks like a physical version. And look at this. The horse turning into just pixels at this point here. Very complicated. Look at the hourglass. Speaking of hourglass, it's dripping right through Feelings, Inc.
01:00:45.260 - 01:00:58.140, Speaker A: Interesting. Very interesting. 200 tezos on secondary. So sold out on primary at five tezos each. Sold out in a day. So five times 20. I mean, 100 tazos.
01:00:58.140 - 01:01:21.360, Speaker A: What is that, $90, $95 now? I don't know. Not bad, you know, art still selling out here. And I don't know if we've seen this one. This is by leprochant, a variation on the heads here. I kind of liked it. A very kind of nice, noisy version of these heads. And again, just kind of cool Gif animation here.
01:01:21.360 - 01:01:55.812, Speaker A: Let's continue. Brilliant artwork. I would argue that we saw, that I saw on Instagram, Hermipe pixel art. Again, one of these artists that you don't necessarily see on the blockchain, who'd probably do fabulous. A very interesting use of what look like different kinds of renderings, of kind of screen renderings, and mixing them all together, I think, is what's going on here. Really brilliantly done, that joker, as well as this. But the joker, I mean, this is a brilliant artwork.
01:01:55.812 - 01:02:16.290, Speaker A: And not too many colors. You could screen print this, which would add a whole other layer. I mean, how many colors? 12345, maybe seven colors. Screen print six or seven color. Ambitious, but not insane. So very cool. White paper or black? That is the question.
01:02:16.290 - 01:02:35.994, Speaker A: Continuing on prism. Zero, one, two. This is by most wrong king, I think Cocolitus tweeted this out pretty rad. Never seen this artist before. Look at this huge, chunky pixels. This cool animated abstract, which I'd argue is another category of digital art, of what I loosely call the second. I think I got to write a book.
01:02:35.994 - 01:02:57.506, Speaker A: I think I got to write a book. The second generation of digital art, I think is going to be the title of it. And then we'll just go through the different genres, and then we'll just see what happens. Jada, pixel dreams. Very cool. Look at this. I think this checks to position, you know, just interesting, interesting, interesting.
01:02:57.506 - 01:03:13.498, Speaker A: This is minted on Zora. Another work minted on Zora for minted. Just amazing. All the artwork that's on Zora right now. Here's Braun dithering in Tokyo. Cool. So we saw, I think, a lot of abstracts by Braun before I took the break.
01:03:13.498 - 01:03:26.306, Speaker A: So interesting to see this. Looks like almost a city setting, but kind of dragged and everything. Processed. A little bit of movement here and there. Interesting piece. Here's Ernesto Ash. I think this was posted in the community.
01:03:26.306 - 01:03:52.990, Speaker A: Eterna and Ligera Maldita. And, of course, Primavera, which is spring, I believe, a 90 x 120 mixed media painting glitched with photo mosh. So there is a glitch in here. So, of course, so interesting piece here. Interesting abstract by Ernesto Asch. And this is an edition of one and sold for 25 tezos. The art is selling here is Mikael.
01:03:52.990 - 01:04:16.524, Speaker A: Water requirements, light requirements, soil requirements. Interesting writing here, too. Kind of has a bit of a sai tambly in the writing here. Nice mix of everything. And even just the dragging what looks like a flower here with some heavy digital processing or treatment, whatever is going on here. Interesting work by Mikhail Knowleson. Here's an abstract by Wojak.
01:04:16.524 - 01:04:33.924, Speaker A: W 74 feeling pain relay. So this is a study, 14 May 2024. So just more interesting digital painting, digital abstracts. And that was from Wojak. And here's walk. And this sold already. Chansey, I'm not sure what the references are here.
01:04:33.924 - 01:04:59.380, Speaker A: If there are some, I imagine there are. So interesting series continues from walk, whose prices continue to kind of edge higher. It's almost like higher highs and higher lows. Wok, we're starting to see higher lows, interestingly. It's gonna be interesting to see how that goes online. Hills, this is lxtXcx. So we should speed up a little bit here, but we're doing quite well.
01:04:59.380 - 01:05:19.928, Speaker A: Again, kind of a bit of a texture. Interesting texture here. And we see a operating system window and almost this kind of 1970s type printing feel to it. And here you see this beautiful field. So it's almost like a. Reminiscent of a Windows XP landscape, but different. And then.
01:05:19.928 - 01:05:35.820, Speaker A: But still evoking it with the screen here. Very interesting piece. Online Hills edition of one sold for 25 tazos. So the artists continue to sell art. The collectors continue to get pretty good deals. I mean, $21.91 for a one of one.
01:05:35.820 - 01:05:52.820, Speaker A: Life is good. Life is good. When prices are like this, like you're still bringing in money for your art. No middle person. You don't need to wait for your money to come in from someone who may or may not pay you. Life is good out here. Self replica citrus services.
01:05:52.820 - 01:06:20.700, Speaker A: So the great Kurt hussle collective to find out more self rep. So here, let me just forgive the Internet. I need to get Starlink. I think I'm seriously contemplating getting starlink. I'm actually using my phone for Internet because my regular Internet doesn't even work. So that is my situation. Let's see if we can get this working.
01:06:20.700 - 01:06:47.266, Speaker A: Just awesome. I have to pick this up. Just beautiful, beautiful audio. Still available. Still available. Only five tezos. $4.39
01:06:47.266 - 01:07:04.752, Speaker A: for a Kurt hustle. How many are left? There are about four left. And look at this. Incredible. A group of buyers here. Xerox, ahec X, Mortal, Texadelic, Cinema Vision, Atlas, pop, Conehead, and trippy collector. You're in good company if you pick this up.
01:07:04.752 - 01:07:15.040, Speaker A: Five left at five tezos. Might have to. Might have to sell an artwork to. I think I have two tezos in my wallet to pick one up here. Human boy. Check this out. This is from April 29.
01:07:15.040 - 01:07:31.942, Speaker A: I quite like this kind of contrast here with this blinking screen. A very interesting piece here. This is one from a few weeks ago. A couple of weeks ago. Nice piece. Nice, as Peterson says. Yeah, really nice piece.
01:07:31.942 - 01:07:57.702, Speaker A: So that was before human boy got the 300, I think, 30,000 views on that one work. Nicholas Sassoon tower. So quite a nice textured work here. Another kind of Nicholas Sassoon type of landscape, I assume. Cool work and just nice cycling gradients. This project took me a very long time to finalize, but I'm enjoying every second of it. RGB study 116.
01:07:57.702 - 01:08:10.270, Speaker A: So very cool. Doing pretty well on x there. Here's Sean Luke. Ancient stew. Interesting. A bit more abstract here. Sometimes you can tell what Sean Luke is depicting, and sometimes you can't.
01:08:10.270 - 01:08:28.480, Speaker A: This looks more just like abstraction. Look at this great kind of frame. This frame is off the wall. This frame. Very interesting frame. And the center part too. Very, very, very interesting edition of 25.
01:08:28.480 - 01:08:51.829, Speaker A: And I think just transferred. Nice. So just transferred to maybe previous collectors, friends, who knows. Glitchtown arcade with a glitch rom here, as you see. And really nice piece here. So continuing to develop here on the glitch Rom front. Beautiful edition of 20 for only a tezos, each selling five so far.
01:08:51.829 - 01:09:16.068, Speaker A: Here's that pinball guy edition of ten for. And this is sold out at a tezos. And so interesting piece here. Almost looks like a curved screen a little bit. So interesting animation may 11 so just, just the other day, alignment is the title. Here's Mika Oladev with an interesting piece. Kind of different from the portraits that we saw before.
01:09:16.068 - 01:09:42.480, Speaker A: So Mika continues to stretch things, push things interestingly. Kind of a manic piece here in a great way. I love this style so much, says Jada. So again, it's another reminder of just how small, tightly knit this community is. Surprisingly from all around the world, though simultaneously. Kimmy Dara, this by Renki. Also continuing to push things here.
01:09:42.480 - 01:10:01.854, Speaker A: Very interesting. Animated, what I'd call an animated abstract. Another category. So just cool noise. Letting the JPEG ization celebrating the jpegization there, I guess the JPEG artifact, some would call it, not listed yet. Nice color. Here's acid boy.
01:10:01.854 - 01:10:17.450, Speaker A: Good morning. As we hit the hour ten mark here, I thought it was going to be a short show. It still will be. Maybe shorter than some. Just nice piece here. Nice psychedelic abstract from Acidboy. A little more detailed or a little bit kind of more.
01:10:17.450 - 01:10:34.260, Speaker A: A lot of small details. Let's say. Let's continue Klaus composition 204. A little bit more texture perhaps in this one. Interestingly so interesting kind of gray vibe. Nice piece here by Klaus. And that is available for 21 tezos.
01:10:34.260 - 01:11:01.674, Speaker A: Still available exmortal with some birds here, Aurora. And of course there's aurora borealis the other day. Maybe that's related in kind of aurora borealis like colors here with these beautiful doves. Very nice. Heavily pre processed, edited digital video clip looped and played back from a digital Eurorack module edition of ten. Sold out at 666. Here is Sky Goodman with an addition of one, the signature Saba.
01:11:01.674 - 01:11:31.270, Speaker A: A kick designed for Sabato. His signature kick. How great is that? So sent, transferred to Sabato. And there it is. So again, like all these recognizable. I mean, this is kind of the good part of what you could argue is a bit of a bear, or at least not like mania on tezos is, you know, this stuff is great because again, if all of a sudden, everybody's making several hundreds or thousands of dollars per work. You're not necessarily doing just kind of fun stuff like this.
01:11:31.270 - 01:11:48.834, Speaker A: Small is good, as I've said for a long time on this show, since the beginning, really. And it's not that small either. Anyway, Santiago, look at this. I am here AI art landscape. We saw another one the other day. This is beautiful. These lands, apes.
01:11:48.834 - 01:12:05.234, Speaker A: These are beautiful. Here's just another kind of. Kind of has a bit of a van Gogh brushwork kind of thing going on here. Just a touch, but not everywhere. But also an AI. I mean, it would print beautifully just on. You could just do straight up inkjet on this one.
01:12:05.234 - 01:12:21.286, Speaker A: And just as like, it's something that would look good on someone's wall, so to speak, like above the couch or in the kitchen. You know, that sort of thing. Beautiful work. Here's another one by Santiago. Here and now edition six. So I'm not exactly sure. I was seeing a mention of here and now.
01:12:21.286 - 01:12:40.330, Speaker A: I think Oxyen posted something. There's some sort of show going on called here and now edition six. And here, heart of the last Tezos node, December 31, 2026. Look at this work. Kind of wild. Hopefully this doesn't crash anything. So again, AI art collage by Santiago.
01:12:40.330 - 01:13:01.070, Speaker A: So just really amazing AI art here. I love the yellow frame. I always love those superficial things. Like the frames. Here is Lego X. So interesting abstract here. I believe this is an AI abstract, if I'm not mistaken, from Ledjo.
01:13:01.070 - 01:13:16.298, Speaker A: So just interesting. Well, not entirely abstract. You do have a snake here, but otherwise abstract. So just interesting AI artwork unlike any. Here's another one. It's kind of abstract. With just one object that is familiar.
01:13:16.298 - 01:13:37.548, Speaker A: Here's another. So just interesting work. Here is Felipe figueras with a very interesting AI. So again, I'm excited to talk to clownvamp today to just hear where AI is right now. Interesting colors. Very AI looking work, but looks great. Kind of have.
01:13:37.548 - 01:13:56.820, Speaker A: These AI works have a bit of a vibe that's going in the same direction, a little bit. Same kind of trajectory, shall we say? No hygiene. With another work here. This May 14. Just beautiful. Kind of, again, has a little bit of a Geiger alien feel to it, but just wild AI artwork here. 40 tezos edition of one.
01:13:56.820 - 01:14:24.250, Speaker A: Not cheap. Maybe the prices are getting higher for no hygiene since I've been gone. Little cakes with this work. This is on fellowship trust. I don't think we saw this one. Let me see a little bit of audio. Totally entertaining and fun.
01:14:24.250 - 01:14:51.648, Speaker A: Beautiful. Like it makes you want to watch it. I mean, I can't tell you how many times I've been in the galleries where I just tune out immediately. This makes you want to watch it. Look how beautiful that is. There's little cakes, I think, I don't know. Just having fun here.
01:14:51.648 - 01:15:18.092, Speaker A: Wow. So this again is on fellowship trust fellowship AI link in the daily XYz link in the comments. And here is strange thing with a wild work here, Roadman and horse. So again, playing with these. Is that terracotta style work? Not exactly sure. Or maybe ivory. Not sure what the material it is emulating.
01:15:18.092 - 01:15:36.850, Speaker A: But look at that. Awesome nike in gold on the white sculpture with the gold speakers on it. Just awesome. The great strange thing. And here's Kanik Zapata. Wild work here. Shall we try and reload it? Because I think it loads up in a kind of interesting way.
01:15:36.850 - 01:15:52.374, Speaker A: This might have been burnt because maybe the. But you see how it just, this is the work. Like, I mean, pretty wild stuff. It feels like almost generative to a certain degree. And look at this. Great. Like what looks like AI pixelation.
01:15:52.374 - 01:16:11.890, Speaker A: You know why I say that is because first of all, because Kanik zapata makes a lot of AI, but also because you don't get that perfectly square pixels. There's just a slight variation there. Interesting texture on the background. Just wild work. So this looks like it was burned. And finally we have a work by mo moe. Shit.
01:16:11.890 - 01:16:34.204, Speaker A: Again, almost like this textile type, kind of bambi scene. Beautiful black background, a beautiful flower, tree here, flowers in the trees here. Kind of has a bit of a japanese woodcut vibe. And you see, again this beautiful kind of nature work here. Beautiful, beautiful piece. AI, I believe. An awesome title too.
01:16:34.204 - 01:16:56.796, Speaker A: I don't think we've seen this one. None minted, but maybe the mint is 0.02, so a little bit more, maybe that's $60, is that right? Maybe $60. So it's not cheap to mint, if I understood that correctly. Here's my friend Charlie Stein out of Berlin. This was a brilliant work. Now with the Kristin Hjellardi Gallery, I thought this was just a brilliant composition.
01:16:56.796 - 01:17:23.890, Speaker A: Beautifully painted, edgy body with a view. 2024, a meter by 80. Here you see the larger show here. She had something for gallery weekend. I was in Italy during gallery weekend, but it's kind of a big event out here. I had forgotten about it when I bought my plane tickets, so I kind of missed out on the festivities, but looked just amazing. Really, really cool work by Charlie Stein Ria drawing.
01:17:23.890 - 01:17:44.224, Speaker A: This was an interesting piece. Artist I'd never seen before on Instagram. Just kind of cool, surreal illustration would hang well with this artist who we've looking at. We've been looking at a ton moto 583, just more beautiful work. I don't think we saw this one. Just kind of tanks, tigers. Just really fun work.
01:17:44.224 - 01:18:05.256, Speaker A: Here's another post, almost has a hieronymus bosh kind of feel to it, but also like a sixties Sci-Fi kind of comic book feel. Just very interesting work. Here's Luciana Guerra, GM basket case. This is a drawing, almost feels like a map. Beautiful, abstract. Just a physical work, I believe by Luciana. Luciana Guerra.
01:18:05.256 - 01:18:19.120, Speaker A: And that's the show, everyone. So thank you for joining me. And there's going to be a great, hopefully great spaces coming up here shortly with Clownvamp on the latest on AI. So join us there. Thank you for joining me again. Until next time, take care.
