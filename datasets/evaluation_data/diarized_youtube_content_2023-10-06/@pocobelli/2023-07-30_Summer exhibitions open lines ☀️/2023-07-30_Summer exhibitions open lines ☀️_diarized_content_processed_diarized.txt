00:00:10.680 - 00:00:45.764, Speaker A: It is summer in the northern hemisphere. That means time for a little more leisure time, a little more hanging out, and a little more art gallery visiting. Today we're going to discuss what exhibitions people are excited about and what they are planning next in their art calendar. Artist Journal, July 12, 2023. Broadcasting live from Berlin and New York City via rug radio on Twitter spaces. My name is Adrian Pokebelli, and we welcome back co host, artist, and conversationalist to the show rune tune. How is your week going?
00:00:46.984 - 00:00:49.244, Speaker B: Hey there. It's been a good week.
00:00:51.164 - 00:00:53.148, Speaker A: A nice amount of time to create some art.
00:00:53.196 - 00:00:55.384, Speaker B: So that was. That was a lot of fun.
00:00:56.564 - 00:00:57.012, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:00:57.068 - 00:01:03.104, Speaker B: Curious to see what galleries and which shows everyone's going to be talking about today.
00:01:03.764 - 00:01:28.176, Speaker A: Well, so am I. And I guess, well, first of all, I think it's wonderful that you're able to create some art this week. That's always. That always makes it a good week. In my books, no matter how, you know, no matter how tough a week might be, if you make some art, it sort of. It redeems it, shall we say. And I'm pretty excited too, actually, to hear what people are checking out.
00:01:28.176 - 00:02:01.420, Speaker A: I mean, I've hardly had time to check out anything. You know, I was looking online here beforehand just to see what is going on in the city other than, you know, the odd gallery show that a friend is doing, you know, putting on and that sort of thing. But I haven't actually. I guess I went to a museum in Munich, but that was probably the last time I actually went to a big exhibition. How about yourself? Have you been New York? There must be a million things. Are you able to get out? Have you seen anything?
00:02:01.572 - 00:02:23.864, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm able to get out. Not as frequently as I'd like. I mean, I'm sure New York is just like Berlin, where at any given moment, there's a show that you've been meaning to go see or you want to see. I feel like there's always a show. That's, you know, what usually gets me into a gallery or a space, though, is when I see that it's, you know, a show's almost on its way out. And I'm like, okay, I got it. I gotta finally do this.
00:02:23.864 - 00:02:57.106, Speaker B: And I've missed a couple shows, but. Oh, and I had the most bizarre experience at the photography center in the lower east side. I was there with a friend last week, and it was pouring rain. And we get there and we're totally soaked, and we're like, are they even gonna let us in here? Because we were quite literally drenched. We go up to the front. It's, you know, these two younger girls are working the door. They're like, oh, yeah, feel free to go in.
00:02:57.106 - 00:03:34.304, Speaker B: So we pay for our tickets in there. And then about 20 minutes into the exhibition and I'm seeing all this fantastic photography by, you know, photographers I've never heard of by the greats like Nan golden. And the alarms start going off and then people are, like, exiting the building or exiting the gallery. And we're like, you know what? I don't see, like, unless someone's going to tell us to get out of here, we're just going to, like, hang out and check out these photos. So that's what we did. I just had my, like, hands over my ears to, like, keep me from being bothered by the alarm. And then eventually someone's like, okay, yeah, we have to actually, we all have to evacuate.
00:03:34.304 - 00:03:58.264, Speaker B: And we're all going down these stairs. And people are like, so what's going on? What exactly is happening? And they wouldn't tell us what was happening. They're like, uh, you know, just, uh, they, they were just, like, so vague about it. And we're all in the lobby, like, wondering, like, well, what the heck is going on? Like, you're, you're making us kind of freaked out. And they wouldn't tell us. And then someone's like, well, are we allowed to leave? He's like, you can leave if you want to.
00:03:59.364 - 00:04:00.348, Speaker A: And so we left.
00:04:00.396 - 00:04:05.876, Speaker B: I was like, I don't know what's going, like, in my head. There was, like, an active shooter somewhere in the gallery.
00:04:06.020 - 00:04:14.012, Speaker A: That's exactly what I was thinking. Like, I mean, yeah. And it's like, when people don't tell you, it just makes it, like, a hundred times worse.
00:04:14.068 - 00:04:16.384, Speaker B: You just start thinking of the worst things possible.
00:04:17.364 - 00:04:18.708, Speaker A: Exactly. Exactly.
00:04:18.756 - 00:04:23.414, Speaker B: That being said, I still have to. I have to go back there and have a normal gallery experience.
00:04:23.874 - 00:04:27.058, Speaker A: Um, did you ever find out what the issue was?
00:04:27.106 - 00:04:36.254, Speaker B: No, I never found out. But, you know, there was nothing terrible in the news, so I'm assuming it was just something related to the weather or a faulty alarm.
00:04:37.514 - 00:04:51.930, Speaker A: Yeah. How is the weather in New York? I imagine it's pretty hot. I mean, here we've started to get hot. Yeah. Is it, you know, like you're hearing, I don't know if you saw those news stories that it's like the hottest days of the earth history. Have you seen that?
00:04:51.962 - 00:04:52.106, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:04:52.130 - 00:05:00.884, Speaker B: Like, the last three days have the hottest and on record. And the average, I think they said that the average world temperature was 65 degrees fahrenheit.
00:05:02.664 - 00:05:03.040, Speaker C: Gosh.
00:05:03.072 - 00:05:18.152, Speaker A: And what is. I almost spilled my water here. What is that in celsius here? I'm. It's such a funny thing. My mom goes to Phoenix in the winters and so she starts using fahrenheit now. So it's hot, though.
00:05:18.208 - 00:05:22.512, Speaker B: I mean, here, 18 and a third degree celsius. Wow.
00:05:22.568 - 00:05:26.896, Speaker A: And that includes like the Arctic, the Antarctica and everything that.
00:05:26.960 - 00:05:27.608, Speaker B: Wow.
00:05:27.776 - 00:05:28.904, Speaker C: It's kind of scary.
00:05:29.064 - 00:06:06.522, Speaker A: I mean, we hear all these, our entire lives we've heard of these stories of how there's global warming and, well, I mean, look, I mean, there's still, I guess it's like the hottest since like 1941 or something, I thought. But I guess it's the hottest ever. So all to say, when things go from abstraction to reality, it is a little bit jarring, shall we say. So welcome, everybody. The room is starting to fill up here and it is basically an open line session. So it's your chance to come out and actually just say a few words. If you're a little shy and, or if you're not, say a lot of words.
00:06:06.522 - 00:06:44.680, Speaker A: And we're totally open here as far as you know. I'm kind of curious just to hear what people are excited about and what is going on in other cities out here. And also, if you're working on series or you're going to put on a show, feel free to mention that as well. Just put a request to speak and I may prank some of you, including Doctor version, who always has such an interesting perspective on everything and is always checking out something cool. So I will also send out some prank invites to come on stage as well. So, Runtoon. And so you went to the photography show.
00:06:44.680 - 00:07:03.384, Speaker A: Now, I don't know if I quite caught what was in the photography show. Like, did you, were you excited about what you saw? I have to confess, I'm not a huge photography guy. Like, it's never my idea to go to a photography exhibition, generally speaking, maybe once in a while, but it's pretty rare. Were you excited by what you saw?
00:07:03.504 - 00:07:40.906, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it was kind of, I was kind of distracted for a lot of it, but I was seeing a lot of really cool stuff by photographers, both familiar and unfamiliar. Granted, I was only really in there for like 15 minutes before things got weird. But I liked what I saw. And I think there was two whole floors that I didn't get to check out. But one of my favorite shows that I've seen this summer was when I was in Miami a couple weeks ago. There's this Leandro Ehrlich exhibit. I'm not sure if you're familiar.
00:07:40.906 - 00:08:21.428, Speaker B: Maybe some people in the audience are familiar. He's from Argentina, I believe, but he's been in all those venice biennials and stuff like that. Mostly, I think, installation based work with some stuff like Prince and stuff that he's done as well. But really fun work. Like very. There's like a sense of humor to a lot of it. And a lot of what he does is take something super familiar and kind of plays with your head about this familiar thing.
00:08:21.428 - 00:09:20.786, Speaker B: So he'll take things like an elevator or a. Like a barber shop or, you know, your apartment door, and he'll do something kind of interesting with it. So, for instance, there was one part of the exhibition that was, I think it was called, it was something like neighbor across the hall or something like that, or, or next door neighbor or some, some. Something to that effect. And essentially what it was is there was this little wall that would pop out, and you could see on both sides of the wall, and on either side of the wall was a matching brown wooden door with the little, like, looking glass through the little, like, spy hole through the. Through the center. And when you look through the little spy hole to see what's out there, you'd see that same door across what looked like an expansive hallway.
00:09:20.786 - 00:09:29.706, Speaker B: But it was really just like a thin wall. So he'll do things like that. And it was, it's just, you know, it's one of those things that just kind of makes you laugh, just kind.
00:09:29.730 - 00:10:07.676, Speaker A: Of messes with your head a little bit, it sounds like. Yeah, you know, I love that. And what was I just thinking about recently? And welcome to er. Dice and doctor version to the stage. Oh, this is what I was going to say. And I mean, kind of just as far as messing with the head, I do like that in terms of when you make a piece, I like confusing the viewer, if possible. For example, I remember I would paint white on colored paper, and then I'd print over top of it, say, the picture of, let's say, a Raphael painting.
00:10:07.676 - 00:10:37.898, Speaker A: And then I'd use marker, and so that would cover most of the orange paper, and there'd be white bleeding through and where the margin was. I would color it white, for example, and if you follow me. And so it looked like a white piece of paper, even though it was a colored piece of paper. So it's kind of confusing, all to say. And I came across another one of those examples today. I was playing with these kind of again, AI remixes really, of previous works. And what was funny is they have all these masks over top.
00:10:37.898 - 00:11:22.544, Speaker A: And I was like, well, I'd almost like to have this where I have the original work underneath and I could screen print the mask over top. So I brought it in Photoshop beta with a generative fill. And sure enough, it started filling in beautifully the parts of the painting that were missing. And I just thought, how strange would that be if I then, I don't know if you guys are following me, but if I printed that out and then screen printed the mask over top, that would just be like the most messed up thing ever. And I. So anyways, all to say, I'm a huge fan of kind of confusing because there's an aesthetic appreciation, I think, that comes with kind of the riddle of not knowing how it was made and how did they do this. And there's kind of something just a little bit extra special when that happens.
00:11:22.544 - 00:11:23.024, Speaker A: Do you get that?
00:11:23.064 - 00:11:56.664, Speaker B: I think. I think that's always, you know, especially, it's, it especially appeals, I think, to artists who are looking at artwork. I know that anytime that I see something and I kind of get lost on the trail of how it was made, it makes me pay attention to it a lot more. I mean, that's essentially why I found art mater and it was that Matthew Stone exhibition. And I could not figure out how a certain piece of artwork was made. And I had to ask someone at the gallery and they pointed me to art Mater.
00:11:58.284 - 00:12:11.304, Speaker A: A fateful day for both of us. Then that question that you dared ask, how do I pronounce your name? Erdice. Where are you calling from? I'm not sure. Have you been on stage before? Welcome to the show.
00:12:12.084 - 00:12:13.020, Speaker D: Hey pokebally.
00:12:13.052 - 00:12:38.832, Speaker E: Thanks. Yeah, I'm actually tuning in from Boston. It's like 930 in the morning here, but I was pretty excited to join and. Yeah, hello. Yeah, I go by a kera dice for most of, most of the time. Yeah, just, just using er, dice right now because I just got married and have a new middle name. So it's technically Elias Rodriguez Dice.
00:12:38.832 - 00:12:40.664, Speaker E: But yeah, you can just say er, dice.
00:12:40.704 - 00:12:41.152, Speaker B: That's cool.
00:12:41.208 - 00:12:44.072, Speaker A: Well, congratulations. That's pretty exciting.
00:12:44.208 - 00:12:45.364, Speaker C: You just got married.
00:12:45.704 - 00:12:49.392, Speaker E: Thank you. Yeah, it was on July 2. Wow.
00:12:49.568 - 00:12:57.166, Speaker A: Big congratulations. Was it a outdoor wedding? Indoor? Give us a little bit of details here.
00:12:57.360 - 00:13:27.844, Speaker E: Yeah, it was indoor at an event space in Somerville, Massachusetts. And it was pretty great. We just, you know, we're both trans identified so we were trying to do something that was, you know, a little less. Less traditional, trying to figure it out ourselves, you know, and came up with kind of a lot of gags that we wound up. We had our friend open up with a princess bride joke. Marriage. Marriage is what brings us together.
00:13:28.464 - 00:13:31.524, Speaker A: Oh, man, that sounds hilarious.
00:13:31.944 - 00:14:07.904, Speaker E: It was pretty hilarious. But, yeah, I wanted to, actually. I recently sold one of the most expensive pieces I had listed. It was a one, one of a ceramic piece that my husband made. He's a master ceramicist, and he went to school for it at Massachusetts of Fine Arts, as well as the University of Delaware. And so the buyer didn't have a Twitter associated with their account. And I thought, oh, who is this? Well, it turns out they found my email, got in touch with me, and said, because I said, whoever buys this NfT will receive the actual vase.
00:14:07.904 - 00:14:23.848, Speaker E: So they emailed me and said, like, hey, I bought this vase from you. And I thought, oh, my God. Like, fantastic. They're actually going to get it. It wasn't just some random bot that got the NFP. Wow, that's so cool. Yeah.
00:14:23.848 - 00:15:42.224, Speaker E: Thank you. And, you know, I've, like, I've built a website, you know, for my husband to sell our, or sell his ceramics. And, you know, it's something that I help him do when I'm not doing my job. And he has markets and stuff like that. And kind of like you were saying about how, you know, people get lost in not knowing the process of things. You know, we have ceramics, which is the oldest art of all time, right? You know, ever since humans needed to carry water and food, and yet people are constantly coming up to our tables, you know, asking questions like, did you make these? You know, or how do you make this? And it's quite fascinating, you know, like you say to be, you know, in 2023, yet we are so used to acquiring, like, all of our cups and plates and, you know, necessities from places like IKea that we've lost touch with, like, such an old artist. But that being said, currently in Boston, one of the most exciting exhibits that we have at the Institute of Contemporary Art is Simone Le, who is one of the most important and largest black feminist ceramicists in the world.
00:15:42.224 - 00:16:09.956, Speaker E: And they have her first, like, her first viewings from a Venice collection on display. And, I mean, these pieces of ceramic and bronze are humongous. So if you get a chance to look up Simone Lei, that show is phenomenal. We just recently had Hokusai at the Museum of Fine Arts, which was awesome.
00:16:10.140 - 00:16:11.368, Speaker B: That's awesome.
00:16:11.516 - 00:16:24.752, Speaker A: I'm looking up Simone Lee Lee right now and, yeah, pretty interesting. Yeah, almost like traditional, sort of, like, for lack of better term, african type sculpture look and feel to it. Yeah, does that.
00:16:24.808 - 00:16:25.920, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:16:25.992 - 00:16:50.922, Speaker A: Really cool. So interesting. And you're just saying hakusai, like, yeah, I'm such a huge fan, actually. I mean, really. And like a huge influence on Van Gogh, I think. Interestingly, if I remember correctly, I mean, those japanese prints were huge. And it seems like it's almost like, you know, the inter, like, it's almost like graphic design a little bit.
00:16:50.922 - 00:17:12.806, Speaker A: It was like almost like printmaking, you know, this sort of thing. And then it inspires someone like Van Gogh, and then it just, you just almost have to reassess everything because probably those bright colors and even the compositions probably had a huge impact on one of the great, you know, quote unquote high artists or fine artists in the. In history.
00:17:12.870 - 00:18:10.854, Speaker E: Absolutely. And I can see how, too. I mean, when seeing them in person, it's just some of the greatest art I have ever seen. And it was kind of funny because it's always, like the most famous paintings, I guess, always wind up being a lot smaller than I expect them to be. You know, the great wave was only about, you know, like eight by eleven, but they had this humongous Lego version of the painting behind it that was almost even more exciting than the painting itself. They made this like, sort of like six by six foot 3d Lego model of it that if you get to see a picture of that as well, it was radical. And the last thing that I wanted to mention that the Museum of Fine Arts did here, up until March 14 of 2023, they were trying to sell NFTs in partnership with La collection.
00:18:10.854 - 00:19:21.384, Speaker E: And so they were selling nfts by artists like Monet and Degas and Millet. However, it didn't seem to be as, as popular as they thought it was going to be, I think because they kept trying to sort of shill. But their audience and their, you know, their members are kind of an older audience, so you can tell they were really trying to get people in emails to understand the notion of making a wallet and buying, you know, official NFTs of this real art, right, which I did grab a couple myself because they were under $100. And I thought, well, I would love to own, you know, a Degas, right? But it didn't seem to catch on. You can still, you know, find information about them, but supposed to give you a bunch of benefits in the future at the museum. So I thought that was kind of a cool notion, you know, for some museums that are trying to stay relevant and dip their toes into the digital space. I was wondering if you've seen that, too.
00:19:22.084 - 00:19:55.964, Speaker A: Well, I mean, a lot of thoughts are crossing my mind here. Like, here's a museum that's copy minting. I mean, I guess they put utility on it, I guess, right? But I was just thinking, like, I mean, imagine if we did that, you know, or if I had a work that I owned of someone else's, and then I started releasing an NFT. Now, maybe they had other details on that and said, hey, this is part of the museum collection, and as such, you will have access to the, to the, you know, coffee shop, 10% off, or whatever the utility of the day is.
00:19:56.004 - 00:20:02.604, Speaker B: You have to wonder what kind of conversations were happening with the museum to make them do that.
00:20:02.644 - 00:20:29.968, Speaker A: You know, it's probably been years in the works. Like, it was probably back in 2021 where it's like, okay, we have to do nfts or we're going to be left behind. And they finally roll it out, you know, like in early 2023, let's say. And then it's sort of like. And then they don't even really, you know, it's almost, it sounds. Looks, feels, and sounds a little bit like institutional thinking a little bit, you know, but hard to say. I mean, yeah, you think you're a dice.
00:20:29.968 - 00:20:33.724, Speaker A: I mean, are you, are you happy with your product? Are you happy with the purchase?
00:20:34.664 - 00:20:58.844, Speaker E: You know, I am. And I kind of wanted. I am. To someone who definitely gets delighted by experimentation and experimental thought. And I was cracking up at the fact that you were saying copy minting, because now that you say that, I think that that is basically what they're doing. They're not getting the permission of Claude Monae to mint his work.
00:20:59.624 - 00:21:04.080, Speaker A: I'd be run out of town if I did something like that. Like, I mean, all of us would be.
00:21:04.272 - 00:21:47.384, Speaker E: Exactly, you know, and even I've even, you know, some artists that I love, like, say, Kyle Flemmer, for example, you know, does some, some analog glitch clips of, like, from the Pokemon, Pokemon show. And I'm just, I'm sitting there and I'm like, God, I love that. But, gee, if I bought it, like, could I get sued? And it's something I didn't think about when I got this art. But like you said, if the utility wasn't behind it, I wouldn't have been interested. I was just curious. I was mainly curious with, like, oh, what is this going to do? Right? Because it's not like I am going to humble brag when people come over like, oh, yes, I own a Degas. It's almost a little more kind of ironic and funny to me.
00:21:48.644 - 00:21:51.324, Speaker A: But also there's my degas. Yeah, right.
00:21:51.364 - 00:22:23.294, Speaker E: It's like I'm also kind of laughing at the fact that it was kind of a flop for them because whereas I thought it was kind of a cool idea and like, oh my God. Well, if only 100 copies of this real painting are going to exist, then that makes these 100 copies, right? Just like the next most valuable in line. And I was like, well, where is this going to go though? Right? So I'm curious, you know, they've. They have yet to do more with it, but we'll see.
00:22:24.514 - 00:22:42.574, Speaker A: Well, pretty fascinating. Keep us updated on that euro dice. And feel free to stay on stage here. And thank you for contributing. And let's get back to you later on in the conversation. Let's bring Doctor Virgin on stage here. Doctor Virgin, how are you doing? I assume you're in Florida right now.
00:22:43.194 - 00:22:57.612, Speaker F: I am in Florida. Back in Florida. It's hot here. I have been mostly offline, so it's great to see you. Pokebelly and rune tune. I was traveling for three weeks in Europe, which was fantastic. Had such a good time.
00:22:57.612 - 00:23:00.060, Speaker F: And it makes me envious of european life.
00:23:00.132 - 00:23:00.996, Speaker A: Where all did you go?
00:23:01.060 - 00:23:09.464, Speaker F: Don't like driving a car. And I miss the city. I miss New York because I moved there last August. But, yeah, that's what's going on with me.
00:23:09.764 - 00:23:35.540, Speaker A: Well, yeah, tell us about your trip. I think Rune Toon was asking too, and whatever. I think I saw you at the pompey do and you're taking pictures of crypto punk, so. And I agree with you. Like, having lived in three north american cities before moving to Europe, like, I'll never go back. Like, I mean, north american cities are pretty harsh in retrospect, you know, like, it's not. It's not easy.
00:23:35.732 - 00:23:44.824, Speaker F: Yeah, New York's not an easy town, obviously, but it has, you know, just the walkability, the scale of a city for a human.
00:23:45.804 - 00:24:20.684, Speaker A: Yeah, New York is a special case for sure, and worth the harshness of, you know. Uh, but yeah, I mean, compared to Toronto was like, my God, I just, uh. You have to buy a car. I literally bought a car so I could get to work. And then my work ended up paying was so that I could pay for my car. And like, I had like, this really weird situation where I was basically working to pay for my car. And it was just like, this is ridiculous, you know? So anyway, uh, I'm one of my happiest days of my life was actually selling my car before I moved out here.
00:24:20.684 - 00:24:26.136, Speaker A: But anyways, tell us about your trip and what were your more reflections on your trip to Europe?
00:24:26.320 - 00:25:06.962, Speaker F: Yeah, so, you know, it was with my wife and my five year old daughter. So it's not necessarily a vacation, even though she's a trooper and really great traveler. You know, we take around the art museum, and she was into drawing and, you know, she was really taking it all in. So I feel really lucky that we got to go. And specifically at the Pompidou, there was an installation by some artists. I have the little flyer right here that I grabbed. I don't know if I can say their names right, but Yvonne Clodagh and Coco petite de Perry, I'm murdering that.
00:25:06.962 - 00:25:28.060, Speaker F: But they're sculptors, performers, choreographers. And when you walk into the pompidou, it's up on the second floor, and literally we spent 2 hours there. It's like this foam neoprene sculpture that the kids can interact with. There's all these different pieces they can build stuff with and nothing specific. It's all about using their imagination. And my daughter loved it. I loved it too.
00:25:28.060 - 00:25:36.384, Speaker F: The colors were incredible. So it was like this immersive playground for kids, but also adults in some way because it was beautiful.
00:25:37.684 - 00:25:48.004, Speaker A: Were you able to drop off your kid in a sense, so that you kind of go on your own? Like I mentioned, it's quite a challenge going to museums with, like, younger children at times, eh?
00:25:48.384 - 00:26:02.752, Speaker F: Yeah, she, you know, my wife would go out because I wanted to spend some time there, so it was great. And, you know, she would take her to a playground on the street or whatever. Paris is excellent for that and all. We're in Madrid too. The just, you know, the playground.
00:26:02.768 - 00:26:03.864, Speaker B: I love Madrid.
00:26:04.024 - 00:26:06.176, Speaker A: I adore Madrid. How did you like it?
00:26:06.320 - 00:26:21.508, Speaker F: Loved it. It was probably one of my favorites for, I don't know, comfortability. It's coming from the US. It's cheaper. Definitely. My wife went to school there for two years, so she has a lot of friends. So we had a network.
00:26:21.508 - 00:26:23.584, Speaker F: We stayed in a really, you know.
00:26:25.444 - 00:26:26.252, Speaker C: Airbnb.
00:26:26.308 - 00:26:50.754, Speaker F: I don't know what the neighborhood is offhand, but close to the center and, you know, could just wander around. That's one of my favorite things to do. I am not lining up to do anything touristy. I just want to get into how people live in certain cities. Go to the grocery store, go to the local cafe, you know, but then Madrid has, you know, went to the Thiessen and saw an incredible Roberto Mata.
00:26:50.874 - 00:26:51.938, Speaker C: Oh, there. You're hero.
00:26:51.986 - 00:26:52.890, Speaker A: Found your mata.
00:26:53.002 - 00:27:34.960, Speaker F: Yes. And also in the pompadour. So two check marks. In Madrid, there was something that really stuck with me that I saw, had the data myself. So I spent some time at the Prado and in the Goya room, which is, I guess, the black, it's all of his black paintings, which is pretty intense in itself. There was a man who was on pretty much a bed painting, this painting, the Saturn devouring his son with his mouth and doing a pretty incredible job. Obviously, he had an assistant there, but it just had, it was really moving.
00:27:34.960 - 00:27:53.464, Speaker F: I mean, it was really hopeful and inspiring and, like, he was doing a really good job. And it's like, this is really how art can save someone. And, I mean, I can relate sometimes too. Like lowest parts of your life. Well, I still have this, you know, and it still keeps me sane.
00:27:53.964 - 00:28:08.056, Speaker A: It's so true. And it's almost like. And nobody can take it away from me. Even this guy who is probably paralyzed. Yeah, for the most part. And, you know, you can't take this away from me. That's beautiful story.
00:28:08.240 - 00:28:19.160, Speaker F: Yeah. I was, you know, seeing all the art and, you know, and all these museums are, you know, I like to say, very crowded. The Louvre was out of control. I don't know if I want to go back.
00:28:19.232 - 00:28:27.712, Speaker A: Yeah. So, yeah, so what about that? Like, it's like it was too crowded. From the sounds of it, it's hard to enjoy.
00:28:27.808 - 00:28:39.644, Speaker F: It's definitely not my thing either. Um, so, you know, you don't, like, come on, the Mona Lisa. It's almost a joke, I think. How can you enjoy that painting? And how can, like, it's.
00:28:39.804 - 00:28:40.380, Speaker C: It just.
00:28:40.452 - 00:28:41.212, Speaker D: It's such a.
00:28:41.308 - 00:28:42.916, Speaker E: It's not my thing, the Mona Lisa.
00:28:42.980 - 00:28:54.140, Speaker F: Yes, it is. I think that what was enjoyable to me was seeing what a spectacle this painting is. Like, that is the art in it. Seeing people wait in line to take their selfie in front of it.
00:28:54.212 - 00:29:02.838, Speaker A: Oh, and then it's like people taking their selfie with it. Like, I guess that's what you got. I guess. Check mark. You know, I guess we saw it. We did. We did it.
00:29:02.838 - 00:29:03.478, Speaker A: We did it.
00:29:03.526 - 00:29:04.154, Speaker F: Yeah.
00:29:04.614 - 00:29:19.274, Speaker B: That's why it is hard to enjoy those massive museums for that reason. Like, I. I rarely make it to some of the larger institutions in New York simply because of the crowds. I mean, you, you and I went to the moment together. That was really crowded.
00:29:19.574 - 00:29:20.398, Speaker C: Really crowded.
00:29:20.446 - 00:29:22.914, Speaker B: That was like a Monday. It was a Monday.
00:29:23.934 - 00:29:24.646, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:29:24.790 - 00:29:40.982, Speaker F: And I know we spoke about this a preferable way of enjoying a museum. I don't know if you want to disclose, but you can be a little. If you're taking anything psychedelic, it can be a little claustrophobic, a little overwhelming.
00:29:41.118 - 00:29:42.646, Speaker C: Yeah, the people.
00:29:42.750 - 00:29:44.486, Speaker F: And it's not about the art, but.
00:29:44.630 - 00:29:47.254, Speaker B: Yeah, that's definitely something I enjoy doing.
00:29:47.294 - 00:29:48.554, Speaker A: In New York City.
00:29:49.934 - 00:29:59.634, Speaker F: Yeah, if you're ever in Milwaukee. I grew up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Milwaukee Art museum is gen. Whenever I go back, I'm surprised how empty it is.
00:29:59.674 - 00:29:59.946, Speaker A: Really?
00:30:00.010 - 00:30:03.210, Speaker F: That's a good, safe, safe zone to do something like that.
00:30:03.282 - 00:30:03.746, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:30:03.850 - 00:30:25.968, Speaker A: I was about to say Munich as well. Munich is one of the deadest museums I've ever seen. Their old, you know, art gallery museum. I went in, you know, late May, but again, that's probably when you were in France. And there's literally, like, three raphaels on one wall and a leonardo on another wall. And I had it all, like, there's, like, two people in the room.
00:30:26.016 - 00:30:26.968, Speaker B: That's a beautiful thing.
00:30:27.016 - 00:30:27.644, Speaker C: Wow.
00:30:28.264 - 00:30:40.520, Speaker A: Yeah. So that's. That was fantastic. Because to your point, I mean, it's too much. Like, I don't really. Yeah, I'll go to the Louvre when it's like, if there's another pandemic, you know, or. Well, it's like, once.
00:30:40.592 - 00:30:49.194, Speaker B: It's similar to, like, the, you know, music venues. Like, I tell all my friends, I don't care who, the artist is never going to see me at Madison Square garden. Like, I just won't do it.
00:30:51.814 - 00:30:56.474, Speaker F: It doesn't sound good at Madison Square garden either. I gotta say.
00:30:56.814 - 00:31:12.924, Speaker A: You're nice. Feel free to weigh in here at any moment. And that goes for anybody who would like to join the conversation here. And can't is also about to join the stage here. Can't welcome from Delhi, who is connecting right now. Kent, how are you doing?
00:31:14.744 - 00:31:15.336, Speaker C: Hey, hey.
00:31:15.360 - 00:31:16.524, Speaker D: Hello. Hello, everyone.
00:31:17.504 - 00:31:22.040, Speaker A: Welcome right to the stage. The spotlight is on you. Can't. How are things going?
00:31:22.192 - 00:31:25.040, Speaker D: Great. Great. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
00:31:25.192 - 00:31:28.924, Speaker C: Uh, yeah, I think, uh, yeah, yeah.
00:31:29.664 - 00:31:47.904, Speaker A: I was just going to say thank you for all the support you've given these spaces and also the YouTube show and even the art. I just want to publicly thank you because every little, you know, act makes a difference here, and it's not a notice from my side. So I just want to thank you for that.
00:31:48.284 - 00:31:48.684, Speaker C: Wow.
00:31:48.724 - 00:32:04.724, Speaker D: Amazing. First of all, your work is really good. I mean, as an artist and also what you're doing for the community is really amazing. So, I mean, the. All the videos are really wonderful. Very informative. So I want to keep the archive on my own wall on the Twitter.
00:32:04.724 - 00:32:14.104, Speaker D: So it helps me to do that also. This way the people are able to see the, see those archives as well. I mean, it's just, I'm not, I'm not doing anything special.
00:32:15.684 - 00:32:30.380, Speaker A: Well, it's, it's appreciated anyway. So how is your art going? And have you been, are you going to any shows? How's Delhi for art? I mean, is there a big art museum over there? Tell us a little bit. Are you getting out much in Delhi?
00:32:30.492 - 00:33:07.444, Speaker D: Yeah, I think this is a season where the art season is starting. People are starting to make the shows, physical shows mainly. And we have the museum as well. Recently one of the wonderful museum which is called KNMA Kiranatha Museum of Art. They have wonderful opening since it's a museum, and they invited a curator who created, who curated young artists, actually. So this is really wonderful exhibition where the young artists are being curated in the museum and they are kind of giving their premises to the young artists.
00:33:09.264 - 00:33:54.204, Speaker A: Interesting. And I wonder, do they have the equivalent of these kind of big museums you see in Europe? I mean, the reason I ask is because the history of art definitely does have a western bias to it, for whatever reason. Just maybe part of the reason is because these traditions came out of places like, you know, the Netherlands and Italy and, you know, all that sort of thing. So what do you know, do, are there basically really rich people in, you know, Delhi or India that acquire, like, works, you know, from the canon and bring them into museums there? Or are there not that many museums, like, of that kind? And maybe it's just more, you know, from the indian tradition, help color that in for us a little.
00:33:55.524 - 00:34:22.304, Speaker D: I think the private museum, I should use the word, they are quite rare, but some people are actually investing into the art, supporting them like anything. Again, I'm taking big in the name of Kiranada Museum of Art, which is called, I mean, KNMA, it's very famous. There is also another museum which is called Devi Devi Art foundation.
00:34:22.964 - 00:34:29.404, Speaker A: Okay, and what do they have there? Like, is it like a typical european art museum or. I imagine it's different.
00:34:29.524 - 00:34:29.780, Speaker C: Right.
00:34:29.812 - 00:34:35.820, Speaker A: So you'd probably have more, you know, indian art from. I don't know, that's why I'm asking.
00:34:36.012 - 00:34:45.224, Speaker D: Oh, yeah, this is. Yeah. So most of the time they curate the art. They have a huge collection, but.
00:34:47.404 - 00:34:47.836, Speaker C: The.
00:34:47.900 - 00:35:17.614, Speaker D: Mesome is used to showcase the. Their collections and it's theme based, like the subject based. So they invite, regularly invite different curators. They bring their own touch and they curate those certain section of collection. So they have different, different variety, very diverse collection they have in here. And from the western artists who if they could acquire some of the work or they also kind of borrow from other museums for the work.
00:35:17.934 - 00:35:34.074, Speaker A: Right. And there's probably these traveling shows that are really global these days, right? I mean, so you probably get shows that come from London or New York that literally travel the globe sometimes. Like, I remember Tutankhamun, I think that traveled around the world like for a few years.
00:35:36.374 - 00:36:04.530, Speaker D: Yeah. So I think now the people are in India starting to invest into the art and if the collection, they have its hues, because there is no other way to keep it intact and alive, otherwise it will go from, it will disappear from the memory of the people. So there is the only way. If the collection is huge, they must turn it into the museums, virtual or digital or the physical. There is no other options. So I think more, more museums are.
00:36:04.562 - 00:36:05.614, Speaker C: Going to come up.
00:36:06.194 - 00:36:24.680, Speaker D: But right now, what I can remember, private museum are two which I remember Baby Art foundation. One of the, one of the found, one of the museum which, which has the contemporary artists only and the caname, it has all kind of, all kind of artists fascinating.
00:36:24.752 - 00:36:53.134, Speaker A: And as far as a contemporary art scene, like, do you go to like, I mean, here in Berlin, we're kind of spoiled. We have a, you know, there's, I could probably, well, it's Wednesday. Yeah, I'm sure there's a ton going on tonight and tomorrow will be even crazier. And that's like a weekly thing out here. But it's not typical. Like in Toronto, there'd be a few shows here and there. How's Deli as far as just, you know, contemporary art galleries? Is there a scene where you can go out and, you know, meet other artists in person?
00:36:54.074 - 00:37:38.024, Speaker D: Oh, I think about this, the rally. Delhi is really rich because we have many galleries here, especially contemporary art galleries, which are private galleries. And we regular have shows mostly the winter is the time of having the kind of art season where we have the India art fair as well. So like the contemporary art from around the world comes here and also many galleries are making the shows. So, yeah, I mean, people, they want to go to shows, they can go, they can also meet new people, they can meet new artists, they can enjoy the wonderful art. Definitely about art, contemporary art. Delhi is very rich.
00:37:38.404 - 00:37:51.504, Speaker A: Well, it sounds pretty exciting. So are you looking forward to any big exhibitions coming up the summer or do you have any plans to travel or what are you looking forward to from an art perspective this summer?
00:37:52.964 - 00:38:12.128, Speaker D: Oh, amazing. I think this is the right time. I should bring that collection I was talking about. So one of the friend is actually making a curated, working on a curator project which is called when art has a voice. This friend happens to be from the south, South Africa.
00:38:12.296 - 00:38:12.824, Speaker C: So it's.
00:38:12.864 - 00:38:43.690, Speaker D: I mean, these are the, this is the show which is the curated. Nfts are there. So he created, he, he wrote a poem when art has a voice and invited people to respond to this poem. So artists started to submit their artwork and now, now there are 60 artworks from the different, different people around the world. And they are JPEG, they are JF, they are also the animation as well. So it's being curated. I mean, the curator's name is blue to black.
00:38:43.690 - 00:38:49.454, Speaker D: I invited him, but I think he's late. So I thought, I think this. I should present the project.
00:38:49.834 - 00:38:59.624, Speaker A: Well, feel free to. Feel free to post a link here and so. Or tell people how they can learn more about that show. That would be, that would be great.
00:39:02.484 - 00:39:54.174, Speaker E: I'm curious, Kant, you know, I wonder if, because the area that you say that you are from and live in, you know, it must have been, it must not have these large institutions, right? Because, you know, it's an area that was really colonized back in the day. So, you know, if we're talking about anything other than contemporary art in your area, like, it most likely has been acquired, you know, or stolen, if you will, by, you know, colonizers and taken to Europe. So I'm just wondering if that's kind of the context behind, you know, having shows that come to you as well as, you know, maybe that stimulating the future of art in your area to say, like recreate like a new wave or a new future of art. What do you think about that?
00:39:55.434 - 00:40:16.104, Speaker D: Amazing. I think this is really amazing to bring this conversation. Yes. People actually are very aware about these things in the art fraternity and they started doing. Working on this already, I think, 20 or 30 years back. So in India, they have their own tradition, like the way we see the contemporary art from here and the west. It's very different.
00:40:16.104 - 00:40:41.994, Speaker D: Both looks like both are the contemporary art, but we have different signature from India. It completely comes from its heritage. So I think this discussions are around. But people actually had this knowledge. They started working 20 or 30 years back writing things. It brought a lot of knowledge and awareness about the people in people, people's mind. Like the young mind.
00:40:41.994 - 00:40:55.374, Speaker D: These young mind happens to be now in forties or fifties. So yes, this awareness is there. People understand the differences also. And they, I mean, they're very much comfortable about talking about these things as well.
00:40:56.434 - 00:41:28.328, Speaker A: Well, it's pretty interesting history here. And speaking of an interesting history, I mean, I see Chi Moscow Jackson out in the crowd there. I've sent you an invite to speak if you are available. I would love to hear about the Kurt Hussle collective solo show. I got a message. I'll join in a second. So awesome, because, I mean, to me, that's a real art world scoop, is actually, I assume it's probably the Kurt hustle collective's first show on, you know, in.
00:41:28.328 - 00:41:34.622, Speaker A: And here's Chi Moscow Jackson. He joins us on stage. Chi, I'm so glad you, you've arrived. How are you doing?
00:41:34.678 - 00:41:37.114, Speaker C: Hey, what's up, man? Can you hear me?
00:41:38.094 - 00:41:38.910, Speaker A: Loud and clear?
00:41:38.982 - 00:41:40.206, Speaker B: Hear you loud and clear.
00:41:40.350 - 00:41:52.994, Speaker C: Yeah, man, things are going good. I just pulled up to work, so I don't have too long, but I've been, you know, lurking in the background listening to your great conversation here.
00:41:54.974 - 00:42:10.104, Speaker A: Well, lurk away. I'm a bit of a lurker myself, so perhaps I can relate somewhat. So tell us about the show here. I assume it's still on. If I were you, I'd probably just leave it on for, like, at least a month. But I'm sure you guys have your own plans. Tell us about the show.
00:42:10.104 - 00:42:13.840, Speaker A: How are things going with the gallery over in downtown Seattle?
00:42:13.952 - 00:42:52.294, Speaker C: Yeah, the show was awesome. It was really good to see people's response to KHC. People are really blown away by it. I think it was. It was definitely something that was different on the art walk, and people really. It resonated with a lot of people, especially using, like, the retro tech. It was like something that people hadn't seen, and there was a lot of nostalgia for that kind of setup.
00:42:52.294 - 00:43:18.304, Speaker C: It took, like, I want to say it took about two months to kind of pull everything together. I had a lot of, you know, chats with J and K and visual Terry just trying to, like, hone in what a show could look like. And at the end, they really, really turned out so. It was really dope.
00:43:19.624 - 00:43:42.144, Speaker A: Well, the pictures were awesome. It looked like you recreated the cyber slums there with a pretty impressive accuracy. And were you able to show, I mean, I'm still, like, my favorite video art of all time is probably those early Kurt Hussle collective commercials where they make music and everything. Were you able to show that stuff? Like, I saw one of them was on a tv.
00:43:42.224 - 00:43:42.576, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:43:42.640 - 00:43:47.744, Speaker A: But I don't know if we'd be competing with the audio. So were people able to watch those commercials?
00:43:47.784 - 00:44:09.176, Speaker C: So they were. So the way that our gallery kind of sets up is like. So I'm always with the belief. I'm like, okay, I went to art school. You know, I've seen the stuffy art shows. I'm not really about those kind of shows. And so there was audio, but it was kind of lower.
00:44:09.176 - 00:45:11.804, Speaker C: And we ended up playing like a five hour playlist from all songs from 1997 to go with the theme. So there was some audio from the commercials, but it wasn't like, you know, people would have to really kind of get close. And I referred people to the digital on cyber gallery, which we had going in the gallery. So we had basically, the makeup of the show was we had three crts tvs that were hooked up to DVD players. And I basically burned a DVD of each set of commercials. So there was like, the nap commercial, and then there was like, there was three sets of commercials that are in different categories. So each category of commercials ended up on one of the three crts.
00:45:11.804 - 00:46:20.824, Speaker C: And then we built that wooden kind of shack sculpture, and it had another monitor in there that showed the location gallery NfT that they created, which basically cycles through a whole bunch of different cyber thumb setups. And then we had two projections. One that was showing the postcard series that they have, which is J and K, and Terry kind of going through the world, I guess, in postcard series. And then there was a debo, what's they're calling DBO, which is a play on HBO. Um, and that was on another projection. So they had really laid out a great idea for this. Uh, and then also, I think one of the best things for the show was they actually created stickers and, um, a magazine that we were able to give out to the first, you know, 50 or 60 people that came.
00:46:20.824 - 00:46:29.684, Speaker C: And I think there ended up being about almost 450 people that came through to that show. So it was a really good turnout as well.
00:46:31.144 - 00:46:33.456, Speaker A: That sounds. Sorry, go ahead. Printed.
00:46:33.520 - 00:46:42.284, Speaker B: What I love is just the use of all the old nineties televisions, VCR's, speaker systems.
00:46:42.744 - 00:46:44.008, Speaker C: Yeah, what was.
00:46:44.136 - 00:46:46.904, Speaker B: Did you already have those on hand or did you guys have to find them?
00:46:46.944 - 00:47:08.314, Speaker C: So I had to. I had one. I have one of those crts I end up. I use just on the regular, just because I'm a VHS nerd. So I just watch a ton of videos and we leave videos running during our art shows. But the other two I did have to source. And that retro tech is becoming a collector's item.
00:47:08.314 - 00:47:14.338, Speaker C: It's really expensive in Seattle. I do not know why I think the Seattle Craig.
00:47:14.506 - 00:47:16.298, Speaker B: You mean like the VCR's and stuff?
00:47:16.346 - 00:47:49.126, Speaker C: The actual tube tv. They're called CRT tvs, and they're making a comeback for retro gaming. Apparently with a new tv, they stretch the pixels with, like, new tvs. But the old tvs are a set ratio, and so. And they're heavy as they are extremely heavy, almost in a forklift to pick those things up. But yeah, I was able to source those, and then I had to source the DVD players. I didn't.
00:47:49.126 - 00:48:48.372, Speaker C: I didn't buy anything new, so I just used all older tech and I just kind of used Craigslist and some other thrift markets and stuff like that to, like, get everything together, including the fog machine that we had kind of coming out of the bear. There was like a barrel that was in the videos of the sliver slums that JNK and visual Terry created. And so we basically just kind of tried to, like, recreate that slime burial and pushed a lot of smoke out of that thing. And, yeah, it was. It was a really great experience. Really spoke to the space, you know, being able to, like, transport work without having to pay a million dollars for shipping costs. And then also, you know, have this kind of interaction with the international artists and bring their creations to Seattle to a different audience that would normally never see anything like that.
00:48:48.372 - 00:48:52.064, Speaker C: So it's just a really, really weird and awesome experience.
00:48:53.724 - 00:49:17.112, Speaker A: It sounds like. It sounds like a total opportunity as far as from a gallery perspective, that all of a sudden you have a talent like Kurt Hussle collective, and that you can have a solo show, but you're still, like, on the art walk, you're. You're saying. So it's probably some special event, I'm assuming, where it's like, everybody goes out on some weekend or some long weekend, right? And then they walk around to 20 different galleries.
00:49:17.168 - 00:49:58.760, Speaker C: Exactly same thing. And this was actually a really big one as well because of the all star games, which is a baseball thing. The baseball all star games are in Seattle this year. So there was a lot of people out there on walking about, and there was also site specific art installations for. For the baseball setup. So there was just a lot of people, a lot of art out. And it was, like, completely different because I basically built a structure which I put black plastic all around, so black out the space because I wasn't sure.
00:49:58.912 - 00:50:06.104, Speaker A: I wasn't sure if that was, like, normally how the gallery was, because they almost look like. They almost look like garbage bags or something.
00:50:06.184 - 00:50:09.168, Speaker C: It really pretty much was. It was. It was, like, polished.
00:50:09.216 - 00:50:10.064, Speaker A: I loved it.
00:50:10.224 - 00:50:14.576, Speaker C: Basically just a black plastic tarp. And I, it was perfect.
00:50:14.680 - 00:50:20.920, Speaker A: Like, it had the slum feeling. I didn't want to comment on it because I was like, oh, well, maybe it's always like that and they're not trying.
00:50:21.072 - 00:51:20.878, Speaker C: No, it was extra slummy, for sure. And we just blacked that space out because I had the NFT show the month before and all the projections got leached out with the color. So I realized that if I was going to be doing any kind of projections, any sort of vibe in there, I needed to do something about that. So I blacked the space out, and it really made a contrast from the other spaces out in the, in the scene because people, you know, are expecting these bright spaces with white walls, and then they come into that space and it's just like dark in the color contrast with the spotlighting, creating that kind of special effect. And it was a totally different vibe than anything we've ever done or I've ever done anyway. And just, just a lot of fun. And it was good to work with those guys because they just, they're just really, really smart guys.
00:51:20.878 - 00:51:50.598, Speaker C: They have a really good story. It really was interesting to work with an artist with all anonymity because I don't know those guys and I don't know what they look like. I just know them by their voices. And I've never worked with an artist like that before. And I think we had to have. Our first initial contact was just like me, like, you guys are serious about what you're doing. This isn't just a joke.
00:51:50.598 - 00:52:11.250, Speaker C: And they were extremely serious. Like, everything was very planned. They took everything really seriously. I think we were sending emails up to maybe 30 minutes before the show, confirming layouts and everything. So, yeah, they're extreme hustlers for sure.
00:52:11.402 - 00:52:13.498, Speaker A: They're pro. They are pro.
00:52:13.586 - 00:52:28.374, Speaker C: I don't know how they create it. They create so much work. They're like machines. Like, they have such a work ethic. That's amazing. And really, like I said, it speaks to the space. You know, how you can.
00:52:28.374 - 00:52:54.524, Speaker C: That could happen, you know, because, like, I'm not doing any more digital shows other than our on cyber gallery for the rest of the year. And we just have all trad artists for the rest of the year. So just all paintings on the wall. Nothing really, like, digital at all. And so I really wanted to, like, make this show stand out, to make it, make it stand out that we are something different than other galleries.
00:52:55.784 - 00:53:04.888, Speaker E: Out of curiosity, is there a way that we can see that space? Or was it documented in any way? Because I really, really wanted to go to that gallery, but I couldn't do to my wedding.
00:53:04.936 - 00:53:50.234, Speaker C: Oh, yeah, no, for sure. We have. We have video of the actual event and photos, and we are, I think, the best way to do. We're going to do a post on our instagram. I think that could be the best way to do it. But I sent a bunch of information to J and K, and he's supposed to be making some kind of montage of the event, so I think that's probably going to be the best way to look at it. But as of right now, the show is actually coming down at the end of the week, and we're prepping for a new opening for Seattle Art Fair 2023, which is happening at the end of this month.
00:53:50.234 - 00:53:52.774, Speaker C: So we have a new artist coming up for that.
00:53:54.114 - 00:54:28.370, Speaker E: That's so awesome. It's really cool to hear about how you set up the space, too, because I, you know, my husband and I are very interested in opening up an art center here in Boston, and I would love to integrate an ongoing NFT gallery space in it so that we can mix digital art with physical art. And it just so happens that KHC and his collective, they're like. They're like, probably my favorite artist, as you can tell by my PFP and my banner. So, yeah, thanks. Hilarious. I just absolutely love their art.
00:54:28.370 - 00:54:46.274, Speaker E: And like you said, the anonymity, you know, and the humor that they integrate with their collection, like, and then the mystery, I mean, I don't know. It just works for me. I think puppets are hilarious. So it's really cool to hear about how you set that all up. That gives me a lot of ideas for the future. So thanks so much.
00:54:46.314 - 00:56:07.294, Speaker C: Oh, yeah, definitely. And, I mean, I really resonate with their work as well, because, I mean, it's just like, there's all these, like, subcontent, like, subtle markers of what they're trying to do. And I actually tried to come up with my own words to describe their work because their artist statement was their magazine that they created, which you can get, I think, on object. I think it's like dollar three or something like that, and it's like an addition of 50. But basically, they were saying that the Kurt hustle collection collective is a toxic love letter to corporations and the tv industry and commercialism and capitalism. So it was really, like me, the way I described it to people is it was like a dystopian cyberpunk landscape that this work was created to fit in that world, and that it's almost similar to, like, a steampunk. But instead of the theme, their artifacts were from 1997, so their retro tech is 1997 tech for the show.
00:56:08.594 - 00:56:11.810, Speaker B: It always makes me think of Tim and Eric. Awesome show.
00:56:11.842 - 00:56:12.454, Speaker C: Yes.
00:56:13.314 - 00:56:20.378, Speaker B: Like, the same sort of absurdist satire on, you know.
00:56:20.466 - 00:56:20.794, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:56:20.834 - 00:56:22.034, Speaker A: On commercialism.
00:56:22.194 - 00:57:16.624, Speaker C: It was so deep. And the way that they do it, like, those commercials really speak to me because it's, like, so cyberpunk in a way that it's like, okay, this is not a utopia future. Like, yeah, I can save my dreams, but I have to sell my life, my memories to a corporation, and I have to, you know, all these little steps that happen within their cyberpunk dystopian future that they're presenting with the cyber slums. And it's, like, similar to, like, Johnny mnemonic in a way, which is, like, I don't know if you've seen that movie with Johnny. Yeah, but it's, like, very dark. It's a dark future, and it's. But it's also, like, has this fun because they're using the Muppet kind of, like, Personas to illustrate.
00:57:16.664 - 00:57:20.584, Speaker B: Well, I just watched Johnny Mnemonic, like, recently.
00:57:20.664 - 00:57:21.648, Speaker A: Like a week ago.
00:57:21.776 - 00:57:22.804, Speaker F: Yeah, me too.
00:57:23.584 - 00:57:28.524, Speaker B: And he's, like, bragging in there. He's like, I have 80gb worth of memory in my brain right now.
00:57:29.224 - 00:57:31.728, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. I remember when that was easy.
00:57:31.856 - 00:57:33.980, Speaker B: Gigs is, like, so massive.
00:57:34.172 - 00:57:47.900, Speaker C: God, I had a. I had a. So I'm using all these flash drives, and I found an old one that I was trying to, like, put files on, and they kept saying it was out of space, and I looked at it. It had 512 megabytes on the flash drive.
00:57:48.092 - 00:57:48.916, Speaker A: Yeah, that's.
00:57:49.020 - 00:57:49.740, Speaker C: What am I gonna.
00:57:49.772 - 00:57:50.684, Speaker A: That sounds like a big one.
00:57:50.724 - 00:57:54.844, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. Sure. That was, like, $40, like, 20 years ago.
00:57:54.964 - 00:57:58.364, Speaker A: Yes. I love it.
00:57:58.404 - 00:57:58.962, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:57:59.108 - 00:58:13.742, Speaker A: Well, it's funny. I've actually reached out to jnk of being a guest on the show. It was not very good timing for him, but I'm going to follow up because he's like, I think I can get him on, but that would be almost, like, a scoop like yours there.
00:58:13.798 - 00:58:14.126, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:58:14.190 - 00:58:20.622, Speaker A: You know, I assume it was their first solo show, like, in a contemporary art gallery. Like, do you know that? Did that come up?
00:58:20.678 - 00:59:09.304, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I'm. I'm fairly certain that was their first show ever. I would say fairly certain with that, in the way that they had just the class of putting all that together and the. Just the mindset of, like, putting the installation in, laying everything out and formatting everything the way they wanted to. It was really just a pleasure to see that, because, you know, your. You never know with artists. I've worked with so many artists trying to put shows together, and the amount of, like, respect they had for me and trying to, like, make sure that this is something that was viable, first of all.
00:59:09.304 - 00:59:27.024, Speaker C: But also just in a class of its own, was just really awesome to see. Like, they are really serious about what they're doing. And it really does speak to the space, because not everyone needs to be a formally trained artist to be able to make art and to express themselves.
00:59:28.604 - 00:59:59.496, Speaker A: They really do take so much care in their product. And class is the word. I mean, they're just a really classy outfit, those guys. So, yeah, pretty exciting. And, you know, just one last thing, actually, on Kurt Hussle collective, because we could spend the whole show. I love, actually, how we're discussing summer exhibitions, Kurt Hussle collective, the last quarter of the show here, and I love it. One thing, I actually showed some of their work at this kind of show I did in January of just kind of featuring a lot of the work.
00:59:59.496 - 01:00:28.222, Speaker A: Can't remember what I called it. And I tell you, the Kurt hustle collective commercials were, like, the fan favorites or, like, the crowd favorites by far. You know, like, the accessibility of those things, and people just find them charming and hilarious, and the music is excellent, and, of course, it's all handcrafted. Like, they don't. They don't buy samples, you know, of, you know, off of wherever. Like, it's all done on their own. And same with all of the, like, glitch stuff.
01:00:28.222 - 01:00:30.214, Speaker A: Like, it's. They're the real deal.
01:00:30.334 - 01:00:50.208, Speaker C: Definitely. They definitely are. And, like, it's, like, my brain. Like, I'm more of a classically trained artist, and so, like, just. I can't eat. My brain doesn't even, like, comprehend how they make that stuff. Like, I couldn't do it at all.
01:00:50.208 - 01:01:16.084, Speaker C: I have no idea how they're doing it. But it really is just a really beautiful thing that they're doing. It's great work. Like, the commercials, by far, are my favorite, but there's so many little projects that they're putting under their umbrella that it is the KHC corporation. Like, they can. I don't know how they do it, but it's awesome. It really is.
01:01:17.024 - 01:01:44.220, Speaker A: I totally agree. As we're wrapping up here, chi. So, are you. Are there any. I mean, you're probably really busy with the gallery, but is there anything in Seattle that you're is there a big show that you're excited to see or are you? So kind of sounds like things are going gangbusters at your gallery. Like, I mean, so is there a big show out there? And if you're not paying attention to that, then what is going on at your gallery? It sounds like it's actually taking off a little bit.
01:01:44.252 - 01:02:13.216, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, we're always really busy. We have. It's basically just me that, like, curating and doing the admin, doing everything. But, yeah, we. I think the biggest show that we're looking forward to, or at least I'm looking forward to, is the Seattle art fair. And that's just going to be. It's basically, I don't know if you've been to like a biennale or the armory show in New York or.
01:02:13.400 - 01:02:14.424, Speaker A: I've been to armory.
01:02:14.544 - 01:02:30.536, Speaker C: Yeah. So it's similar to armory. And it's going to be just a huge event. And I'm looking forward to the ease of hanging the next show because it's just all paintings. So that's extremely easy. And.
01:02:30.720 - 01:02:32.928, Speaker A: Yeah, I was going to say you're probably looking forward to that.
01:02:32.976 - 01:03:04.804, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm looking forward to that with a passion. And then I'm going to go to the Seattle art fair. And I already got vip tickets, so I'm just going to go and peruse and drink some cocktails and just enjoy myself and try to ease out of the digital kind of projection. Technical difficulties. Just get back to some really easy trad shows until early next year when we're going to start our next NFT show in January.
01:03:06.184 - 01:03:11.712, Speaker A: Okay, awesome. And it sounds like you have a booth at the Seattle art fair, is that correct?
01:03:11.848 - 01:03:44.100, Speaker C: We don't have a booth. We are doing a satellite event. Our gallery is maybe, I would say, three to four blocks from the actual event. So it's very close. And our building that we are working out of has about two, maybe, maybe about five other galleries on the ground floor. And we're all planning to have satellite openings for that event just to make it like a hub for people to come to. So you might as well.
01:03:44.132 - 01:03:46.820, Speaker A: And it's kind of the trend right now anyway.
01:03:46.932 - 01:03:47.580, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:03:47.732 - 01:03:52.500, Speaker A: To do these kind of satellite fairs, it's like, you know, around the big vent and all this sort.
01:03:52.532 - 01:04:09.980, Speaker C: I mean, it costs a lot of money for. For a booth. I mean, that's. We're talking like $5,000. And my space is totally artist run and artist funded. So it's me and one other person. And we basically pay for that space.
01:04:09.980 - 01:04:56.832, Speaker C: And we don't have high budgets, really, and we pay for everything out of pocket. So it's kind of one of those things where if we were to get, like, some kind of sponsorship to, like, put money down, that could be a loss. Like, you know, we wouldn't be mind losing $5,000. But, like, that's typically probably about, you know, 75% of our rent for the year or maybe half the year. Maybe it's about half the year's worth of rent. So it's kind of like, you know, not necessarily worth it for. For us, but it allows us, being an artist, running space allows us to do fun shows like KHC show and NFT shows, because we don't really need to worry about the funding, but hopefully that will change in the future.
01:04:56.832 - 01:05:07.284, Speaker C: You know, like, the more people we bring on and we do make sales. So we have the goals to be in the big show, but for right now, we're just kind of satellite.
01:05:08.984 - 01:05:25.832, Speaker A: Well, I think it all is. I love the trajectory, the trajectory that your gallery is on. Like, every time I check in, we check in with you, it seems like things are going are, you know, are. Or you keep on chugging along in a upward direction. So it's pretty exciting.
01:05:25.928 - 01:06:17.650, Speaker C: Yeah, you know, more stuff like that. I want to work with more artists and have more, you know, digital shows for sure. Like, I think the on cyber gallery, just the format of it just really makes sense. And it's like, for a regular artist, for a regular traditional, traditional artist to just, like, even take photos of their work and create an on cyber gallery is just a huge difference. Like, that's what my takeaway was from it. Like, I've had a few of these on cyber galleries, and the last NFT show that we had, you know, like, I was able to take photos of people's work, put it in a gallery, and then it's accessible to anybody in the world who has a technology to, like, interface, you know? Yeah.
01:06:17.682 - 01:06:18.538, Speaker A: You know, that could work.
01:06:18.586 - 01:06:22.074, Speaker B: Uh, you know, ear dice, that's. That might be a good option.
01:06:22.114 - 01:06:53.732, Speaker E: Oh, yeah. With that, I actually. Yeah, I have been really, really working hard on my own cyber galleries. And in fact, I was going to say, um, you know, my pinned tweet is my, what I consider my museum hub for all of the on cyber galleries that I've made. So for the weekly galleries that I've been putting together of Tazos collections, I have them all connected end to end with portals. So you can just walk through them and see each one. So.
01:06:53.732 - 01:07:39.650, Speaker E: And then in my hub, it has portals to, you know, whether I've made a solo exhibit, which I recently did for Ivan Hugo, you can go in there through a portal. I made a spring gallery, one that specifically featured KHC. Hey, Dearocat Sabato, who's here. Shout out to Sabato and Ivan Hugo. So, yeah, I've been loving creating these spaces and sharing them out. It's been absolutely my favorite thing to do with this new hobby of collecting NFTs. So I look forward to making my own also that continues to bring ceramics into the space because my husband and I kind of want to see how far we can go with, you know, bringing that art form in.
01:07:39.650 - 01:07:49.654, Speaker E: So, you know, that being said, definitely check out the galleries that I have and the ones that I'll be continuing to do, hopefully on a weekly, if not bi weekly basis. Thanks.
01:07:50.034 - 01:08:13.484, Speaker A: Well, keep us updated, Eurydice, and thank you for joining us on stage today. And thank you everybody who is listening, and thank you all the speakers here. Chimasku Jackson with the epic update on the Kurt Hussle collective show can't Doctor version. Any final thoughts? Anybody? Otherwise I'll turn it to rune tune for his final thoughts.
01:08:14.584 - 01:08:15.144, Speaker C: Anybody?
01:08:15.184 - 01:08:18.200, Speaker A: Rune tune, any final thoughts on today's show?
01:08:18.352 - 01:08:29.432, Speaker B: Oh, every time Chi Moscow Jackson comes on, I'm just reminded how bad I want to go visit gallery. My sister lives in Seattle, so I do make. I make trips out there all the time.
01:08:29.608 - 01:08:30.392, Speaker A: Me too.
01:08:30.528 - 01:08:35.756, Speaker B: One of these days I'm going to hit you up in advance and we.
01:08:35.780 - 01:08:59.704, Speaker C: Will connect for sure, man. Pull up on me and just want to say thank you too for doing, hosting these events and really, you know, stepping it up for the community. And it just is really, it provides content that I pretty much watch daily. So I really appreciate you keeping me on top of the game.
01:09:00.654 - 01:09:15.190, Speaker A: Well, likewise. And you're doing wonderful things over there, Chimasuku Jackson. And it is truly a community effort over here. Well, thanks everybody. And thanks to everybody who's listening out there. And do not be shy. Come up on stage anytime.
01:09:15.190 - 01:09:17.814, Speaker A: And until next time, take care.
