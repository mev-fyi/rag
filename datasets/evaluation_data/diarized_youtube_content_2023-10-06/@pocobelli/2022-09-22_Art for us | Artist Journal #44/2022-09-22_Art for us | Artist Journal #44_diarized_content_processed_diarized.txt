00:00:09.560 - 00:00:42.664, Speaker A: Artist journal, September 22, 2022, Berlin. My name is Adrian Pokebelli, your artist reporter. We are now six weeks in. I took off a couple of days for the wedding. Six weeks in, it always feels like my first day. So I appreciate the patience. As I learned this broadcasting situation, I wanted to delete yesterday's episode, but I, you know, you just, you just got it.
00:00:42.664 - 00:01:14.804, Speaker A: You just gotta put it all in. So anyways, you just gotta keep it and you just gotta go with it and. Yeah, so anyways, thank you for all the support and the likes. Very quickly, before we get to this beautiful gloom tube, it's like we have our format here. A big shout out to culture three and Georgie Miller, who basically gave me the nicest profile I've ever had. It's all about the meaning for me in conversation with Adrian Pokebelli. I'll leave a link in the description.
00:01:14.804 - 00:01:48.934, Speaker A: Culture three, XYZ post Pokebelly, a very nice profile. Put some nice works up, some works from the peloponnesian war here I have to send, there's a couple of small corrections, just little tiny things. But I mean, again, this is the nicest profile I've ever had and I have done a few interviews but it was just really well written. Let me just make sure our mic is on here. We're good. Okay. So thank you to Georgie Miller.
00:01:48.934 - 00:02:30.732, Speaker A: And actually in a quick correction as well, we were talking about futurism yesterday. I think I was saying that Umberto Bocconi wrote the first manifesto. Again, I want to delete yesterday's episode, but you just leave it. It's actually Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, famously, who wrote the first manifesto of Futurism in 1909, which is interesting. And remember we were talking about how futurism in my view is a response to cubism and cubism. I think we could give it a date of about 19 oh 519 oh 419 oh five. I mean Picasso's blue period was around 19 oh 419 oh five.
00:02:30.732 - 00:03:13.458, Speaker A: And then they started doing the cubist works in France with Georges Pac. Really, I think we could call him the co creator. I am not an expert on Cubism but I'm fairly familiar with the works and somewhat of the tradition. So a couple of things I just want to point out this is a pretty extreme manifesto and there's just a couple of points that I wanted to put in here that kind of illustrate that and you can read the rest on your own. But just to give you a taste of how radical this is .9 we will glorify war the only true hygiene of the world. Now, remember, this is pre World War one.
00:03:13.458 - 00:03:51.124, Speaker A: So I think these guys kind of got shut up by World War one. You could argue, I've heard Ballard has made the argument that the Dadaists, who were more in the 1920s, got shut up by World War two. So this whole, like, oh, we're gonna throw everything out, rationality in everything and all our tradition, and then wark shows up, like, three or four years later. Yeah. So let me continue here. Militarism, patriotism, the destructive gesture of anarchists, the beautiful ideas which kill, and the scorn of woman. So just to give you, like, a historical idea.
00:03:51.124 - 00:04:28.338, Speaker A: Now, these guys were given a big show at Guggenheim ten years ago when I was there. So it's interesting how the art and the politics separate and final word on that. I mean, the futurists, they were largely, like, declared fascists, okay? They were huge supporters of fascism. You can see futurist fascist posters that they made. So. And this is just one more point I want to put here. We will destroy museums, libraries, and fight against moralism, feminism and all utilitarian cowardice.
00:04:28.338 - 00:04:54.934, Speaker A: So pretty extreme stuff, but that is history. And so, you know, as you look at these works and just so go, oh, look how beautiful. Like, I mean, the politics are highly questionable, to put it mildly. So just a little history lesson there, as I got the. Yeah. So. But I mean, nevertheless, you'll see their works at major museums and at Guggenheim having a major retrospective.
00:04:54.934 - 00:05:20.074, Speaker A: So. And I'm not saying that's a bad thing either, if the artworks are innovative. But it's. You see how complicated this is politically, particularly today. I mean, I guess my question is, then we'll get back to gloomtube here. You can put on a futurist show ten years ago. Can you put on a future show today? I don't know.
00:05:20.074 - 00:05:37.326, Speaker A: So I just put out that question, and I just. To me, I don't know the answer to that question. And actually, there is one more thing. A bocconi. And again, so here I go. And then I go, oh, look. But look at this beautiful artwork by Umberto Bocconi, who did that one? The continuity of forms in space.
00:05:37.326 - 00:06:20.236, Speaker A: That sculpture that we looked at yesterday, the riot in the gallery. Now, I used to always think of this as, like, some gagosian type gallery in my little fantasy world. That's not what this is sometimes, like an outdoor mall, I think, can be called, like, a gallery of sorts. And this, you can see, is a cafe. But what I did want to point out is you still see the legacy of Georges Chira and divisionism, as well as, you know, which is post impressionism as well as impressionism in these little dots, again, kind of bouncing off of this scientific, atomistic view of the world. You know, the model. The model of the atom was being, you know, discovered.
00:06:20.236 - 00:06:39.150, Speaker A: I think it was Rutherford, 20 years later. But, I mean, they were always. They're getting towards this point, and there were different developments. I'm not an expert in that. I have some familiarity. But again, you see movement as well, and just flux and social upheaval. So they were kind of.
00:06:39.150 - 00:06:59.022, Speaker A: I mean, I don't think it's an overstatement to call them anarchists. I mean, they would probably call themselves fascists. So anyways, I don't want to get. This is a family friendly show here, but just to give you. But that is the history. So I thought I'd just, you know, do a little correction on. It wasn't Bocconi who wrote the first manifesto of futurism.
00:06:59.022 - 00:07:27.080, Speaker A: Cause it's important that we note the history here as we kind of try and give credibility to what's going on right now and try and relate it to a tradition. So remember the art of the present. Ballard's term. I said all my stories in a kind of visionary present. Well, we're back to the visionary present here with gloomtube, who put out this work yesterday. A self checkout. Let's see if there's a title on it.
00:07:27.080 - 00:08:18.724, Speaker A: Self checkout late at night. Another very poetic work by gloomtube, our guy who puts the yellow heads and the happy faces, or unhappy, who's putting in his little debit card here. And it's almost kind of what I like about this is it's almost this kind of. First of all, it's kind of a lonely work. There's nobody else except for this indoor hunting magazine. So kind of, again, this isolated person and the person itself, interestingly, again, remember meta dreams, looking at a corrupt kind of society, one person against this massively bureaucratic kind of corrupt world. You see similar flavors with this small guy, this small guy putting his card in against this massive technology.
00:08:18.724 - 00:08:45.560, Speaker A: Great symbolism here, too. I mean, to me, again, this is museum quality material. And it's even like, who cares if it belongs in a museum? This is art for us. This is an art of the present, as Ballard puts it, an art of the visionary present. So a fantastic work by Gloomtube sold out very quickly. Only six tezos. Like, you gotta love that.
00:08:45.560 - 00:09:06.614, Speaker A: He could put like 15 if you wanted to. Sold out very quickly. Listed at 1107 Berlin time, sold out in 20 minutes. I luckily got one of those last ones as I transferred from binance quickly. You gotta leave more money in your wallet, otherwise you tend to miss stuff like that. So awesome work. Moving on.
00:09:06.614 - 00:09:54.066, Speaker A: There's the datas. So I missed this completely. All my notifications, I didn't see them in my notifications, but an awesome work by Adelia in her new series. Again, an art of the present. You see Twitter, you see discord, you see someone on a computer basically falling asleep from, let's call it exhaustion, a cool little retro digital clock, because that's cool. And a phone. So again, this is where I see commentary on our contemporary lives of the present, particularly in what I call kind of this illustration genre.
00:09:54.066 - 00:10:15.866, Speaker A: And I will go into that soon, the genres of digital art. Very, very soon, perhaps this weekend I will start that. And so again, just a fantastic work by her. 99 notifications. So here, 99 notifications. You see, busy in virtual life, tired of real life. You see a kind of exhaustion, a digital exhaustion.
00:10:15.866 - 00:10:29.138, Speaker A: Poetic. I wish I hadn't missed this. Now it's 50. Maybe you can put an offer in. Only 15 though. And Adelia, as we know, has a pretty hot market. Let's just see now.
00:10:29.138 - 00:10:53.376, Speaker A: She listed it and they were all offers at Fortezos and then they were all accepted. So basically, I assume she mentioned it on Twitter and then you had to put an offer in if you followed her on Twitter. So maybe I need to put her notifications on. On Twitter so I don't miss the next one. A new artist I hadn't seen before. Sins. C I n s.
00:10:53.376 - 00:11:10.540, Speaker A: I assume that's how you pronounce it. Only three tazos. Golden hour and seashell. Cool work. Again, we're in this kind of contemporary, what I call contemporary illustration. This is just a. I mean there's nothing overly contemporary about a beach, but a really nice kind of reminds me of.
00:11:10.540 - 00:11:26.924, Speaker A: Kaws. Kaws. That really popular digital artist. I'm sorry, not digital artist, contemporary artist who kind of blew up the art scene about five years ago. Ten years ago. Kind of has a cause look to it, especially in the clouds. Really nicely rendered, just kind of cool composition.
00:11:26.924 - 00:11:38.698, Speaker A: Beautiful work. So I picked it up. Twelve, I think I picked it up. Addition of twelve. Three tazos. There's probably. Yeah, there's probably one left.
00:11:38.698 - 00:12:00.584, Speaker A: Here's more. So you do see almost, perhaps there is a cause, influence. You see it in the Mickey. Mickey Mouse, but really nice Mickey Mouse here. Cool guy or girl? Woman. Whoever it is cool artist. So I followed them and I thought it's a little out of order here.
00:12:00.584 - 00:12:18.624, Speaker A: So here, this is selling for 999. I thought we could just look at the history here. So this sold for 55. Nice purchase for a one of one if you ask me. So very interesting. Let me see here. Let me just move this over here.
00:12:18.624 - 00:13:06.284, Speaker A: The failed artist two by wasteman Goldman who is becoming, I mean, considering the outrageousness almost of his work and style, I'm impressed at how he keeps just making work that I have to cover here. So the second version of the failed artist and he's got some fries on his head, some camel cigarettes and some frog drink and jeans covered, I mean almost the cliche of the artist with jeans covered in paint. I love it. How much is this? 210 have I bought this? I don't think so. I'm going to pick this up. Another great work by wasteman Goldman. And here's another work by Dan Control or Dan Ctrl.
00:13:06.284 - 00:13:25.984, Speaker A: An Akiah phone. Another nice addition to this series here. I used to have one exactly like this. I think that was the model I had the late nineties. Is it sold out now? Looks like it. So yeah, sold out. Maybe you can get it on secondary Nakia 3310.
00:13:25.984 - 00:13:51.852, Speaker A: Using it now would be a privilege. And let me just go to this myth really quickly. So myth drop. So this was Mikey Wilson collaborating with the myth and basically turning the Argentina flag into a myth sun. And let's just quickly bring this up. So sold out edition of 100. Sold out right away.
00:13:51.852 - 00:14:22.504, Speaker A: I picked one up and now is selling for three tezos. So congratulations to both of them. Mikey Wilson, definitely. We've mentioned him pretty regularly too because he is definitely a person on the town in this digital world here. Marcelo Pinel. Surprisingly, we haven't talked about Marcelo Pinel, maybe because he's moved over to Ethereum, mostly because he makes great sales over there. But he did just do a drop here.
00:14:22.504 - 00:14:54.950, Speaker A: It hasn't gone for sale yet. I consider him kind of essential tezos. Like if you are building your own museum or collection and you kind of want to have the full collection in my universe, you kind of need a Marcelo Pinel just to kind of have that kind of comprehensive view. So this is called the awakening of Spring Loop animation 2048 by 20, 48, 30 frames per second. So transferred to Jano Le Pain gallery. So that's what happened. 19.
00:14:54.950 - 00:15:21.518, Speaker A: So Giano Le Pain gallery is back on the scene. Commissioning works, it looks like. So the plot thickens with Jano Le Pain, who is really making a play here. All sorts of stuff going on. All sorts of stuff. So they're making moves. Interesting, right? So Marcelo Pinel, a new work.
00:15:21.518 - 00:15:39.130, Speaker A: And if you don't know his work, you can check it out here. There are still some. I mean, it tends to be expensive. Generally you need to pay 30 or 40 to just get that first mint and. Yeah, like, I mean, I think I actually brought one up here. Yeah, good. So this one, the feast of the gods.
00:15:39.130 - 00:16:05.366, Speaker A: I mean, this is kind of classic Marcelo Pinel. They're pretty heavy files, so they might pause a little bit here, but they're quite beautiful. As you can see, there's nothing quite like it. So again, and you even have the tradition is in here, so no problem putting that in your digital art museum. So very cool. You got the world here and all of it. So great work from Marcelo Pinel.
00:16:05.366 - 00:16:38.970, Speaker A: Another work by Spagels Maskinen. Room service. And this is kind of classic here of spagelsmeskinen, where you see the old mobile phone and then you have a beating heart and it's kind of done with this kind of rasterized bitmap. Classic, classic animation. You have a rose, so really cool. He burnt a few. So it's not like I saw this at first and I saw an addition of 25 for 35 each.
00:16:38.970 - 00:17:11.854, Speaker A: And it seemed kind of expensive for me, but now it's only 15 and he's got actually a pretty strong market. And so, yeah, he just burned ten. And, yeah, remember the security cameras we were looking at last time? So he's a pretty cool artist. And you see they actually go for a pretty penny, the works here. So pretty strong market. Pretty strong, for lack of better term fan base as we move on. Clownvamp, my mission, I thought this was a really interesting tweet.
00:17:11.854 - 00:17:38.084, Speaker A: Clownvamp. My mission to collect as many AI, one of ones as possible continues. Recent acquisitions, Norm Lopak, crypto hamster Hood laboratory, and strange thing. Let's just see. I mean, so it sounds like he's building a pretty serious AI museum. And it's probably now is the time because, you know, some people have speculated that AI could blow up. And, I mean, nice one of ones here.
00:17:38.084 - 00:18:16.008, Speaker A: And, yeah, so if it does, I mean, Clownvamp is basically kind of the dude, your guy, one of the main people, I mean, again, huge patron. He's dropping a lot of money. So again, clownvamp and AI, again, you talk about AI, it's also clownvamp that kind of crosses my mind. Redrum continues to have really nice sales. Let me just look at them. Not just deep red, but the whole thing. Where are we here? Recent sales.
00:18:16.008 - 00:18:44.370, Speaker A: Okay, so 13 hours. 13 hours. So he's had a pretty good day and a half year. Sold out of this edition of ten, and then selling a ton of this edition of 1000. I thought I saw at one point a. Let me just go back to that deep red series, because I think he also sold a one of one for 280. Here it is, 13 hours ago.
00:18:44.370 - 00:19:06.038, Speaker A: So that is a new all time high. I saw him tweet for red rum for this work here. Sometimes these works can crash my mic halfway through. That's happened to me a couple of times. So I'm a little hesitant sometimes because then it screws up the entire recording. Okay, so there it is, 280. Very interesting composition.
00:19:06.038 - 00:19:32.556, Speaker A: You almost see this predella of sorts. Predella is a great word. It's in medieval painting. When you see, like, the bottom three, there will be three little images at the bottom, and then there will be a big thing in an altar piece. The bottom three images will be called the predella. This isn't quite a predella, but if you kind of had. If you kind of covered the bottom and then you could cut, and then there's only one row, you might be able to call that a predella.
00:19:32.556 - 00:19:48.936, Speaker A: What's this called? Interesting. Kind of mysterious work overlooking fragmented memories. AI. So AI is back. Almost looks like a google images structure here. That's interesting. Very, very interesting there.
00:19:48.936 - 00:20:06.594, Speaker A: So redrum continuing to turn heads. Board me, social club with another. Just kind of crazy work here. Looks like someone's stabbed in the hand with this. Again, weird airbrush cutout style egg. Almost a hat tip to dally. This looks like a dally egg if I've ever seen one.
00:20:06.594 - 00:20:40.894, Speaker A: Melting figures, you know, almost reminds you of the. That anthropomorphic. What is this called? Wasted time. Sold out five editions for 350. So pretty cheap. Let me see if we can find that Salvador Dali autumn cannibalism, where it's just, like, people kind of melting this one here. All of you know this, I'm sure.
00:20:40.894 - 00:21:06.984, Speaker A: Let's just do this. And. Yeah, so, I mean, not quite here, but. Yeah, but again, these melting figures, and then you get the melting eggs, which is classic Dali. So again, they're kind of a distant reference here. We talked about the new flag of Argentina. I did miss the title, though.
00:21:06.984 - 00:21:37.516, Speaker A: The new flag of Argentina. Classic new work by native Ed. Just, you know, what I call animated abstract, that genre. So just kind of jarring work. Can't look at it for too long or you got. And finally, you know, I was talking about those works yesterday where I combine different images, renderings from Google images. It wasn't combines, it was called composites.
00:21:37.516 - 00:22:12.320, Speaker A: And I'll just show you quickly because I was actually kind of proud and I kind of half not forgot, but this is just a series that I'm kind of working on, among others. So these were the three versions of the entombment by Michelangelo that I found in Google images. And the concept here is basically to combine all three and then you get your image. So, kind of fun. I did another one with Saint Jerome composite, Saint Jerome Genomics. And this is another thing. Instagram filters or just filters in general? I think not.
00:22:12.320 - 00:22:37.394, Speaker A: Adelia Sumi Rae, she uses filters as well. I'm a big fan of using filters. They really can. It's kind of like that final. I call it the mastering process in digital art. Those filters can really be that kind of final. You know, it's like mastering in audio, in music, you know? And so I'll just show you the originals here because it's kind of interesting how.
00:22:37.394 - 00:22:53.322, Speaker A: How different they are. Like, you see this one? This is what Google images gives you. You see this one, completely different. And you see this one. Okay. And maybe this is from Wikipedia, whatever. This is what the web is giving you.
00:22:53.322 - 00:23:24.728, Speaker A: So I combined all three, and then you get this one. And I just think it's kind of conceptually fun, visually interesting, and you get all sorts of interesting effects. I use a lot of the magic wand, again, one of my favorite tools. And you get all these, I think I, you know, you almost get these squares here with, like, the JPeg ization. So, yeah, I'm very proud of these works. I haven't minted them because I feel like I'm going to run into copyright issues, but I actually won't. And I'm going to discuss that on another episode.
00:23:24.728 - 00:24:12.974, Speaker A: We're going to go into copyright actually very soon, maybe when I actually mint this work that I'm going to put on super rare that I've been talking about for the last couple of days when I actually mint it, then we can talk about copyright and why it's okay, what I'm doing, and it's very interesting. So finally, Haftka just had another. He's the guy who gave the speech the other day that we were playing, and he had more thoughts, basically talking more about the greatness of web3 versus the contemporary art world. So worth a watch. Go to haftk ETH's Twitter, and I think that is everything. I'm going to list my eight bit nature series right away. Thank you for all the support.
00:24:12.974 - 00:24:15.554, Speaker A: And until next time, take care.
