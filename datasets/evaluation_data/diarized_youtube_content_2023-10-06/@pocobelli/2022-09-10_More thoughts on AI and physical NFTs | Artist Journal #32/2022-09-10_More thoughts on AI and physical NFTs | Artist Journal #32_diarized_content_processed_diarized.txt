00:00:06.760 - 00:00:52.686, Speaker A: Artist journal, September 10, 2022, Berlin. My name is Adrian Pokobelli and I welcome you back. I welcome you back. Whoever's here, a little bit of drinking and tweeting. I thought we could look at that tweet that I put as a living, breathing example of why you should shouldn't drink and tweet. But 1st first of all, it's again, the I really appreciate all the comments I've been getting. It's just, again, like, I just don't expect it.
00:00:52.686 - 00:01:50.374, Speaker A: In a sense, this whole sort of gig, this public journal is new to me. So I just want to, again, just, I just appreciate it and I enjoy it. I enjoy this conversation and I think we're getting somewhere. I think this kind of back and forth of these issues, like, I think we're going to make a little more progress on the AI issue and daily, like we're going to have, I think in a should this keep going? And I don't see why it doesn't in a few weeks, and I don't expect everybody to watch all this either. Okay. But you know, just even keeping tabs here and there, in a few weeks we could really be making some serious progress on what a lot of this stuff means, AI, you know, nft versus physical. We got another comment on that.
00:01:50.374 - 00:02:46.062, Speaker A: Again, back to the phone. Art, and I haven't even opened the genres of digital art, which is going to be a very fun and exciting topic that I think there will be some debate on. Again, I think part of the fun of doing all this is not having a fixed mindset on this is how it is and this is how it has to be. But going into this with open minds, right? And I really get the sense that a lot of you have open minds who are watching this and enjoy that. And I think it's the only way to be because we're not looking to basically bolster our egos and say, oh, congratulations. Now this is how it should be. Like some kind of crusty academics, this is what they often do at these conferences, is they go, oh, well, my take on balloons in the 18th century is this.
00:02:46.062 - 00:03:22.554, Speaker A: And this is why it, and it just gets kind of ridiculous. And I prefer that we go like St. Socrates there, like the so called founder of western civilization, not to get too exciting, Socrates having an open mind and not acting like we have all the answers ahead of time because I think we're actually going to get a lot closer to reality doing that. Okay. So again, I appreciate all the comments. We're going to go through some of them. And if I miss any, you know, I'm.
00:03:22.554 - 00:03:44.546, Speaker A: Yeah, we can't do all comments, but I really appreciate them. And we are going to. We're going to talk about, actually, a fair amount of them. Now, first of all, I'm just opening with this work by Cappen, as he's called. Let's just look at the title here. Is this a dream? Dawn is upon us, the fire is dying. So this sold.
00:03:44.546 - 00:04:13.888, Speaker A: Actually, it didn't sell out. He sent it. I assume these are two earlier collectors. So you can't buy this. I mean, you could put an offer in. What I really like about Kappn's work, some of it is actually the technical side of it, which is a very, very, very simple idea, which is to put a dynamic, a moving GiF beneath a static foreground. And so you could even.
00:04:13.888 - 00:04:40.694, Speaker A: You know, it does evoke in my mind a little bit, now that we're talking about it. Do you know Sigmar Polka? You know, kind of the. What was the name of the movement? It was like consumer something. It was kind of like the german answer to Andy Warhol, probably. There's like, 25% of you will have heard of Sigmar Polka. Very important artist. Let me just.
00:04:40.694 - 00:05:01.244, Speaker A: Yeah. What was the name of the movement? Capitalist realism. He's a capitalist realist. So, you know, whatever. Let's just go to the paintings. And he had a very simple formula, generally speaking. I mean, some remarkable paintings.
00:05:01.244 - 00:05:27.814, Speaker A: It's always hard to get paintings, these images on your screen. This is some of the later work, I believe, here, which is. Let's just see if we can get a bigger. So abstract, random stuff with a kind of coherent image over top. Often these, I think you call them Benday dots, if I'm not mistaken. This kind of printing process. And I think he would do these manually.
00:05:27.814 - 00:05:54.362, Speaker A: I wonder if we have another just kind of classic example of. And he would just kind of ignore the relationship of the underneath layer. You see this yellow thing with the top layer. Now, I don't think that's necessarily what's going on in Kappan, but that's what it kind of reminds me of. Anyways, we'll return to Sigmar Polka over the coming. Oh, here's a beautiful one. We'll just open this one.
00:05:54.362 - 00:06:19.852, Speaker A: Some of the later work where he'd actually make the canvas transparent. And you see there's just, like, some drips. So he's kind of playing with this randomness underneath of this order. So it's kind of the contrast here. There's a couple at least that I see right away. One is chaos in order. So here you see, like, it's kind of like painted underneath this orange part, or it hasn't been scraped off or whatever it is, with some drips here.
00:06:19.852 - 00:06:33.388, Speaker A: And then over top you got some black paint. And he actually put some white paint. I don't know if I've ever seen these in the flesh. I'm sure they're absolutely spectacular. He's an acquired taste. A little bit. I didn't understand polka at first.
00:06:33.388 - 00:06:53.240, Speaker A: So if you're not super excited by this yet, don't worry about it, is what I would say. But I would also say, don't dismiss it. I mean, he's got kind of a magical. A very interesting artist. I saw a massive show by him at Moma. I think the first time I went to MoMA, maybe that was like in 2004 or something. I don't know.
00:06:53.240 - 00:07:19.026, Speaker A: 2007 is actually probably the first time I went to New York, did a massive retrospective on Sigmar Polka. So very important. So, I mean, this just kind of evokes that a little bit for me because he's got this kind of layer underneath, of kind of brightness, you might say. So it makes a really great contrast. It's a technique that I don't remember seeing. Okay. And he did it on an earlier work, and I'll show you some of his work because he didn't do it.
00:07:19.026 - 00:07:56.084, Speaker A: And I'm assuming Kapn is a guy. Apologies if not, because Kappan did it on this kind of earlier piece here, which I bought right away, first contact, which was an awesome piece. Same thing, right? It's got this kind of dynamic background with static layer over top that stays the same. Very interesting technique here, let me just make this a bit bigger. Beautiful work. Kind of reminds me of the light bright series, if you remember that, if you're a child of the eighties, he didn't do it on these other ones. And I kind of wish he had.
00:07:56.084 - 00:08:18.162, Speaker A: That's what I was thinking on all these. I was like, captain, where is that underneath layer? Because otherwise. Yeah, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to resist buying it. I could resist, though, without that underneath layers. So here's another one. I didn't even see this one. So anyway, so quick look at cap.
00:08:18.162 - 00:08:36.554, Speaker A: And this was another one that actually caught my eye. Rustic digital art. We haven't talked about interesting artist. I mean, I think. Sorry, what's the title? Western Union. Again, contemporary contemporary subject matter, which I'm always a fan of. Remember, art of the present.
00:08:36.554 - 00:08:57.594, Speaker A: For those that watched the last episode. Again, thank you for the very nice comments on that. So art of our world, the world in which we live is so. Commentary. Visual commentary. What's interesting about rustic digital art? This is a very nice one that he's done here. Or she.
00:08:57.594 - 00:09:37.024, Speaker A: It reminds me of gallery work or museum work just in its style. Like, I would say rustic digital art has more than most, a kind of a hat tip to the visual arts as we know them from museums. Like, this is the kind of work that reminds me of the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa. You know, it's the kind of work you'd see on the wall there, except you'd see a real painting. Kind of evokes some early Hockneys a little bit. Even the pool one. I mean, like, that's a stretch, I know, but just kind of like the general treatment.
00:09:37.024 - 00:10:03.854, Speaker A: That's a bit of a stretch, though. Let's just look at some of the other work. Here we go. Yeah, like, you see here, this recently came out. These are all catching my eye just because I don't buy them, because I don't have endless money, especially now I gotta save up for my german electricity bills. If anything's gonna stop this show, it'll be german electricity. So let's hope that doesn't happen again.
00:10:03.854 - 00:10:26.634, Speaker A: You got this kind of. God. What's the name of that artist who did the portrait of a woman? De Kooning. I mean, it's got a slight. I mean, again, these are slight stretches here. I don't even know. How do you spell de Kooning? De Kooning, portrait of a woman, I think is what it is.
00:10:26.634 - 00:10:49.138, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, it's pretty loose, actually. This is probably the more famous iteration. This is a crop, whatever this is. Yeah, it's like Google is really making life hard for us, if you ask me. I mean, all we want is a portrait of William de Kooning's. De Kooning's portrait of a woman, which is an incredibly famous painting.
00:10:49.138 - 00:11:07.954, Speaker A: Anyway, images. Trying to make these fast for you guys, though, because I don't want to waste your time here. Okay. But it's always so. Again, another tiny image. I wonder if it's because I'm in Germany. I think copyright laws are also very tough here.
00:11:07.954 - 00:11:39.614, Speaker A: So there's just, you see this kind of painterly treatment is what I'm getting at. I mean, it's super low resolution. Thank you, Google. But you start to see, and again, you see almost the random background like we're seeing with polka, and then kind of a more organized. But you're seeing kind of like sketches. So it's very interesting to me because, again, this is the kind of work you might see in a modern art museum, right? So just kind of interesting. So rustic, digital art.
00:11:39.614 - 00:12:12.240, Speaker A: Let's actually just quickly just look at the catalog here so you get a feel. So trying out different things here. Again, you see that kind of random background, and it might not be random, but just, you know where I'm going with that. Just kind of, like, here again, kind of that, you know what I want to call a fine art treatment. Again, playing with randomness a little bit more. So very interesting. Very, very interesting.
00:12:12.240 - 00:12:29.284, Speaker A: Let's keep going. What else do we got on the menu here? I just thought this person's kind of interesting. This person's just catching my eye. Bolin 132, gateau au chocolat. Bolin 32 is putting out a bunch of. One of ones, and I just think it's kind of interesting. I bought one of them.
00:12:29.284 - 00:12:53.778, Speaker A: This one really caught my eye. The colors are beautiful and just kind of, I'm not sure what's going on exactly. So you see the benefits of writing down kind of a tiny bit. Your process. I should probably do this more format digital collage. And then prescribed in oil is what Bolin 132 puts. And I don't know what that means.
00:12:53.778 - 00:13:15.014, Speaker A: Prescribed in oil. And maybe Bolin 132 is being a bit cute about it here, but I kind of want to know. I'm kind of back to this, physical versus digital and what's going on here. It looks like digital work to me. Let me just. And a very quick look at just some of their other work. Contemporary collage artist.
00:13:15.014 - 00:13:39.294, Speaker A: It's kind of interesting, you know, again, a lot of one on ones. Often, Bolin 132 will sell it for like 15 or 18. So just kind of interesting. See if this loads up. Huge file. I mean, 6200 by 6500. Let's just make that big.
00:13:39.294 - 00:14:09.304, Speaker A: So, yeah, just a few works here that caught my eye in the last 24 hours. So you see, pretty cool, right? And is this a one of one, like, you gotta love one of ones are getting more popular here it is. And, like, again, this person paid 15 tezos for this. Pretty, pretty nice one of one. I picked this up, I woke up. I kind of felt bad for the person. This person seemed to really want it.
00:14:09.304 - 00:14:43.814, Speaker A: It's like, feel free to reach out to me if you really, really want it. We'll make a deal if you really, really want it. And we're just asleep because this person seemed to really want it. But I also felt like, well, am I not going to bid on it when I want it? And it's going for 620 and it's like, well, what about the artist too? So you can't feel too bad for too many people here. You just got to kind of, okay, if you want it, put a bid on it. And that's it. So that being said, so I love, so I was happy to pick this up again, I love the colors.
00:14:43.814 - 00:15:09.084, Speaker A: We talked about it yesterday. That being said, I probably, I'll try not to bid. I mean, if the price stays this low, who knows? But you know, another auction. And again, auctions are awesome places. So this looks like, I think he called it Marvin Gason or, sorry, Marvin Sun Gay, something like this. So it looks like a tribute to Marvin Gaye by the myth moma. We'll see if Moma wakes up on this one.
00:15:09.084 - 00:15:46.214, Speaker A: So just kind of, and this was another artist that I think Mikey Wilson, Mikey de la Creme, however it is said he was, I think, retweeting some of these and they look pretty interesting. I think Vincent Van do got in on the action too. Let's just look at the history. Rustic digital art. You see how small this community is. It's awesome. Vincent van do so yeah, just some interesting kinda experiments here, really.
00:15:46.214 - 00:16:11.954, Speaker A: So you see, let's just take a look at this one and let's look at the history. Roerich got one. Mikey Wilson Minta, you know, like Vincent Van Doe. It's like we know, like it's hilarious that we know like four of the five names here practically. Or three or four. Yeah. And so just an interesting thing, I'd say the contrast here, which is making this interesting, is the dynamic, the movement and the staticness.
00:16:11.954 - 00:16:31.354, Speaker A: That's our contrast here. So. And it looks like the sky is going left to right or right to left, actually. So that's a movement of a certain kind. Then we have a blinking movement and then we just have static. And it all kind of creates, again, just a really interesting contrast. This is by dext 33 r tez.
00:16:31.354 - 00:17:03.884, Speaker A: So yeah, now they're now. So we got some comments from strange thing that I just wanted to go into because I thought they were worth, and let me speed this up here it because I think they were worth discussing because he talks about his process a little bit. So again, I really enjoy opening up this conversation with you. Likewise. Strange thing. It's really an honor when the artists that we're discussing chimes in. That's true for all the artists that chime in on when I'm talking about their work.
00:17:03.884 - 00:17:31.794, Speaker A: Someone has to come forward and, and be a part of to help bridge the gap on reservations some people may have. Exactly. We're trying to do an honest investigation here and let the chips fall where they may. So I appreciate it that you appreciate it. This was interesting. So when it comes to the speed, because I was saying, you know, are too many of these being made too quickly? Please do not be fooled when it comes to my work. Some can take a long time too.
00:17:31.794 - 00:18:00.936, Speaker A: Okay, so that's interesting. A cloud has gone over the sky here, so some can take a long time too. And, okay, be edited correctly. I use MJ for the initial concept and then use other programs. I don't know what MJ is. If anybody knows, feel free to write a comment. And then I use other programs such as Dali or Photoshop if needed to tidy up or to add extra items in Dali, for example.
00:18:00.936 - 00:18:27.036, Speaker A: So I don't know if MJ is another AI tool. Cause wouldn't that be interesting if. Strange thing is using two AI tools. Two different AI tools. Interesting, interesting, interesting. I'm not sure what MJ is, but if that's another AI tool, and if not, it's still an interesting idea. Okay.
00:18:27.036 - 00:19:04.218, Speaker A: The work you are seeing is back catalog that I had reserved for future drops. Okay, so that's also part of the reason it's not like he's just going five, six a day or 50 a day and taking his five favorite. There's a bit of a backlog of work that he's now starting to release. Okay, interesting. I am an artist that moved from traditional into this new tech because I am a fan of both technology, that is. And it started to make sense the deeper I explored and grew on. Me too, as I had reservations at first.
00:19:04.218 - 00:19:41.074, Speaker A: I wonder if this is going to happen to all of us who, like, again, I could see myself using this a couple of times and being like, oh my God, holy. This changes everything, right? It could be. And it looks like actually a massive tool in the toolbox. And ignore new technology at your own peril. Finally, if there are any more questions, feel free to ask them. Or even if you need help to transition over to AI and get it to work the way intended for your vision. I mean, it doesn't get any nicer than that is what I wrote.
00:19:41.074 - 00:19:58.054, Speaker A: Thank you and I'll keep you updated. So again, you gotta love this community. Thank you. Strange thing. And thank you for the comments. Keep up the amazing work. And I was just noticing Thuglord is like now selling for a Tezos 95 here.
00:19:58.054 - 00:20:21.974, Speaker A: So he sold 1000 and now for 50.50 tezos cents. And now it's going. So, I mean, this thing is, it's tempting in the object in the Tezos ecosystem, we could say this has gone viral. Okay. At least in our little neck of the woods. And here is another piece that I thought really stood out.
00:20:21.974 - 00:20:40.554, Speaker A: Yeezy by strange thing. A one of one. I just thought this was a really nice one. And back to this idea that fashion is probably going to be turned upside down by AI. And you just see it with the colors here. Really interesting work. So, and again, like this context.
00:20:40.554 - 00:21:22.198, Speaker A: Now, a couple of things I want to mention. So he is mentioning how he's editing them. It sounds like it's actually, this isn't pressing a button, I think is what we can definitely conclude from what he said. And let's not forget the fountain that we looked at yesterday, because I was thinking about that. And let's just quickly revisit it because there's some kind of important points that we need to discuss in the context of AI, which is there are edits. Okay? This isn't simply pressing a button either. This is deciding, I'm going to use the urinal as a tool or as a subject, as a piece of art.
00:21:22.198 - 00:21:38.250, Speaker A: But again, it has been turned on its side. So that is an edit. It has been written on. That is an edit. And it has been renamed the fountain. This is not a fountain. Okay, so there are three edits on this piece.
00:21:38.250 - 00:22:07.824, Speaker A: And I just wanted us to recognize that because some people say, oh, Duchamp already made. Okay, here it is. It's actually, there are three edits. And I think that's consistent with Duchamp's other ready mades, which we don't need to go into now, but maybe in a future episode. So, a tribute to rat cloaksy here from Bazaya, I think, is how you pronounce the name. Not three a, five, a, one a. So I am slowly learning how to pronounce the names here.
00:22:07.824 - 00:22:39.888, Speaker A: Again, I don't want to misrepresent anybody, so always feel free to message me if I'm pronouncing your name wrong or if there's anything there that I'm getting wrong. So, el loco. So that would seem to be our very intense friend rat cloak, see, with the trademark Hannibal Lecter gear, but in wrestling fashion. So classic sort of bazaya work where it's just a lot of fun, actually. Some sports jerseys. The cigarettes. Okay, we got the cigarettes.
00:22:39.888 - 00:23:00.794, Speaker A: Kind of a rat cloaksy background a little bit. So work in progress. I want to point that out. There's a nice bigger picture. Okay. This is why you shouldn't drink and tweet because this guy, Luke 500 wrote this really nice message he finds hilarious. The channel reached 100 subs, which is true.
00:23:00.794 - 00:23:24.018, Speaker A: He deserves at least 100 fold. So some of the nicest comments I've gotten, I could listen like, it's just so nice. And then I was drunk, so I was like, but I'm going to delete this and I'm just going to say thank you very much. Okay. For the very kind words. Thank you. I just wanted to do thank you very much for the words.
00:23:24.018 - 00:23:48.254, Speaker A: They are very encouraging because I just wanted to show why you shouldn't, the dangers of drinking and thank you very much for the words. They mean a lot. I can't remember what I just said. Thank you very much for the words. They are very encouraging. There we go. Which is a million percent true.
00:23:48.254 - 00:24:20.384, Speaker A: Okay, moving on. So another work I just saw from mech TXT, I just like, kind of like the color contrast because it's nothing too different, but the color contrast I thought, just noteworthy there we had a, here it is. Web links chimed in again. So, hey, weblinks, thank you for the comment. Appreciate your comments and the art of the moment. Thoughts? Thank you for watching. Personally, I was, and we were, Drew la creme left some really nice comments.
00:24:20.384 - 00:24:53.458, Speaker A: So you guys, you're making me feel great here about my little project here. And I'm trying to keep these short. So I really appreciate the comments, Drew. And Drew has left many nice comments and has tweeted and retweeted lots and is just an all around great guy, as I think a lot of people know now. There is this thing about how rat cloaksy, as far as I understand, is in the Ukraine. And so, you know, this is something. And he's done some fundraising on a couple of works for just equipment and whatever.
00:24:53.458 - 00:25:30.710, Speaker A: So I mean, pretty, you know, for an intense situation, for an intense guy. I mean, you're in a country that is at war in a very real way now. He was quick. And so Weblinks was saying, like, you know, I didn't even really realize that he was in a war. And neither did I, actually. At first. I kind of clued in maybe a couple of weeks ago or something like that, or when there was a fundraiser once, I was like, oh, maybe, you know, so, and yeah, and as web links is saying wisely here, personally, I was collecting purely for the art, as was I.
00:25:30.710 - 00:25:45.396, Speaker A: Because I think there's. I think rat cloak. See, is maybe a little worried that, you know, this is don't buy my stuff. Cause I'm a victim. Okay. Like, he's. He has gone out of his way to kind of not be a victim and to not kind of.
00:25:45.396 - 00:26:12.450, Speaker A: To almost distance himself somewhat as much as he can. Like, here's a fundraiser, but he is not using it as, let's say, a marketing tool. And he's been very careful and deliberate to make sure that that is clear. Personally, I was collecting purely for the art. This is web links. But realized only yesterday or the day before when I spoke with him, he was from Ukraine, which makes me feel even better about collecting this work. Yeah, I'd echo that sentiment, you know, like, it's.
00:26:12.450 - 00:26:24.734, Speaker A: Exactly. But it's not why you started buying it. No. The work stands on its own. Okay. And it probably will stand way after we've come and gone. Okay.
00:26:24.734 - 00:26:55.596, Speaker A: That's how much conviction I have in his work, as I call him, like the Raphael of the Tazo scene. It's. Yeah, like, I mean, to me, that's kind of how I see him in this, you know, and it's just really, really great art. So, anyways, a little bit of debate, and he was saying, I've never speculated about the flag of my country and always want people to judge my work by the result. So just like we were saying, there were separate drops in support of Ukraine, but I donated all the earned funds to the needs of the army. Thank you for your support. And XDC artists in general.
00:26:55.596 - 00:27:22.768, Speaker A: So, yeah, so Ratclok, see, has nothing to explain to anybody and has done an incredible amount simply by the works he's made. And I think he's just saying, just so you know. You know, as everything we just said. So anyways, keep up the great work. Ratcloaksee and weblinks with the huge collecting. I think we're getting close to being done here. Just looking at different things here.
00:27:22.768 - 00:27:47.524, Speaker A: Turo, very interesting work. I just saw this on twitter. So this is available. So just an interesting kind of digital painting. And finally, this is where I want it to end. We got one another comment from Blammo and talking about the physical art versus the NFTs. And I think we can make just a little bit of progress on this and then we can just call it a day.
00:27:47.524 - 00:28:04.920, Speaker A: Enjoy our weekends here. Okay. And this relates to that. So do you only collect digital native one of ones? No. Multi editions are copies too. Yes, but a multi edition is identical. First of all.
00:28:04.920 - 00:28:23.334, Speaker A: So a digital multi edition is. They're all identical. They are true. They aren't just copies, so to speak, like they're identical copies. Whereas when we take a picture of a physical work, say a painting or a drawing, that's a copy. That is not the actual work. It's not an identical copy.
00:28:23.334 - 00:28:41.158, Speaker A: It is a photo of the physical artwork. And digitally we can do identical copies. So there is a difference there also. And again, I just appreciate the comment. Blemo and comment. Yeah, keep commenting. I really enjoy this.
00:28:41.158 - 00:29:11.644, Speaker A: Also, this is about expression via blockchain. If we were to be honest about that which is happening, that is at its core the truly important thing happening. Yeah, and good point. In the sense that do whatever you want out there. This is my opinion. I'm not saying people shouldn't do it. I'm just saying, as we investigate this, and in the long run, are photos of physical works going to be collectible? Because maybe we want to know that when we're buying works.
00:29:11.644 - 00:29:50.500, Speaker A: I'm skeptical, but I think it depends on the situation. Now, back to the digitally native argument. Limited run prints of original artworks are sold and are valuable to people. The multi edition NFTs of non digitally native artworks, you could call it a photograph of a painting, is a new version of the limited run print runs of old. I think it is likely that van Gogh, were he alive today, would have minted a representation of his works to be sold on blockchain. I don't know. Like, I think van Gogh is actually a really good example because the paint, he's almost.
00:29:50.500 - 00:30:30.970, Speaker A: He's one of the worst to photograph because sometimes the paint is coming literally like half an inch, you know, an inch. I think there's probably van Gogh's where it's like almost an inch off the canvas and a photo. So would he have done it as additions? Maybe. But van Gogh photos of Van Gogh's are just nothing like the paintings. And as a collector, you want to own the work and it doesn't mean you can't do an edition. I guess you take a picture, but don't expect that to be worth much. In my universe, again, everybody can do what they want, and probably a lot of people are doing that.
00:30:30.970 - 00:30:50.314, Speaker A: So I personally would not like to miss a chance like that. And with you thinking, I am afraid you might have missed a hypothetical blockchain. Van Gogh. Cheers, poco. Well, cheers, blamo. Um, yeah, I'm not sure. I'm not sure for all the reasons we just discussed and with.
00:30:50.314 - 00:31:10.354, Speaker A: And however, this is actually where I basically. I think I want to end with that. This is also an interesting artist. Okay, we're almost done here. So here's something that looks like a physical drawing work that I bought. And I just thought it was, but I didn't buy it, really, because I think it's going to be worth anything. I bought it because it's so beautiful.
00:31:10.354 - 00:31:47.624, Speaker A: And I just kind of wanted to study, and I've worked a lot, and I'm not going to go into it. But in the peloponnesian war series, I use a lot of multicolored letters, kind of like this. Would I die? Color randomly, and sometimes we'll adjust with the hue. And so I started to see some qualities that I've worked with, you know, tracing, you know, letters and different colors. Remember rimboed, a red, e, white, I, you know, green, this sort of thing. And that also goes through my head when I'm doing that sort of thing. And when I see this.
00:31:47.624 - 00:32:06.574, Speaker A: And so I'm not religious about this physical work thing, but I just. To me, it's. I just want to own this work, really for reference, and just, I want to be able to follow this. This artist. It wasn't too much money. It was three tezos, and it was an edition of three. It's like, okay, fine.
00:32:06.574 - 00:32:23.226, Speaker A: Okay, fine. Dory la Grungza. And finally, this is just another artist I saw. Infinite yay. Minted September 5. So just some interesting kind of work here. It looks like AI to me, but that's edited.
00:32:23.226 - 00:32:52.494, Speaker A: So I don't know what to make of this, but let's see if it sold for, created an auction at 55 and sold to clownvamp for 100. Kind of looks like AI, and actually it is. Okay, so this AI stuff, I mean, yeah, opportunity knocks, so let's leave it there. Thank you again for watching. I hope you enjoyed it, and I will see you next episode. Until then, take care.
