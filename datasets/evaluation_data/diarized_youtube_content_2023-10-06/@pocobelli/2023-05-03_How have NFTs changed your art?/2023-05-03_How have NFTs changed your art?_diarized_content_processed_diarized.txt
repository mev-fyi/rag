00:00:03.000 - 00:00:55.846, Speaker A: In the last few years, the revolution has taken place for artists around the world, where they've been able to sell digital art online to a global audience using blockchain technology. Today we're going to discuss how this has impacted the way artists work and how the artwork itself has changed as a result of this remarkable technology. Artist journal, May 3, 2023. Broadcasting live from Berlin and New York City on rug radio via Twitter spaces. My name is Adrian Pokebelly, and we welcome back co host, artist, and conversationalist to the show Rune tune Roon. How is your week going? It's been a very busy week, but I'm glad to be here as always. Well, how was your work, poco belly? I'm just.
00:00:55.846 - 00:01:19.188, Speaker A: On that note, I'm so thrilled. You do do this every week, Rune tune. I mean, you. You have been steady as a rock here and, you know, right now nobody's being paid. You know, hopefully we get something or other from somewhere, you know, at some point. But, I mean, you have showed up every week, so let me just. Well, it's intrinsically rewarding.
00:01:19.188 - 00:01:39.928, Speaker A: Well, to be. I'm glad to hear that. I'm very glad to hear that. And again, you have a natural talent for this. I mean, I was listening to you when you'd be on JRD, Joe Roganstad's podcast, or, sorry, Twitter Spaces. That's probably where we first met, actually, you know, on the airwaves. And I think that's right.
00:01:39.928 - 00:01:48.342, Speaker A: I almost forgot about that. Yeah. So, I mean, again. Yeah. So anyways, I'm thrilled. So you're having a busy week. Yeah, over here.
00:01:48.342 - 00:02:36.734, Speaker A: I mean, it is always busy, but I have to say, actually, when I'm looking at my list of things to do, it's remarkably, you know, benign, shall we say. It's sort of like little things. I could probably finish it today, insane as that might sound. You know, I'm kind of at the point where it's like, okay, gotta apply for a canadian passport by the end of the year, you know, so I'm thrilled because that never happens to me. It's, you know, do you ever finish your things to do list? Rune tune? Very rarely. But my things to do list usually runs pretty deep with the intention of knowing, okay, there's gonna be some things I don't get to. Fortunately, I always make time for this, and I always make time for some creative work.
00:02:36.734 - 00:02:59.830, Speaker A: And doing that, you know, makes life a lot better. It's so true. And I'm so much happier when I'm being productive with the artwork you know, it just makes a much happier me. And sometimes it's. Sometimes it's tricky to make that time. So anyways, welcome everybody. We have a beautiful crowd that is here starting to show up already.
00:02:59.830 - 00:03:18.396, Speaker A: Doctor version is already on stage. Mikal, big shout out in edge Q. Josh Filippo and Fendal and Tito and human. This is human boy. Awesome. And Emily and meta Trone. Welcome everyone.
00:03:18.396 - 00:03:39.294, Speaker A: So feel free to join the conversation. I've already sent out some invitations to join the stage. I will send out a few more and prank randomly here. So anyways, welcome everyone. I guess rune tune, maybe we can get it started with you if you're okay with that. Otherwise we can turn to doctor. Yeah, totally fine.
00:03:39.294 - 00:04:07.266, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. So how about you? I mean, you know, you come out of, you know, painting. You went to art school, as far as I remember, your story. How did you know the whole NFt, the question of the day, how did nfts change your art? I guess the first question is, did it change your art? I assume it did. And how? Yeah, I would say, did it change my art?
00:04:07.330 - 00:04:11.074, Speaker B: It definitely, yeah.
00:04:11.234 - 00:05:11.950, Speaker A: I mean, I'm looking at a lot of the work now that I've done in the past and I feel like it's a continuation of the art I always wanted to make. It's just I've been able to reach this new sort of. The animation thing is kind of. It was the breakthrough for me because there was never like a place that I could, you know, I come from that traditional art background. It's, it was, my whole life was all about painting and drawing and, you know, all that stuff. And I, there, there just wasn't like an audience for like short animated gifs, things that are like, you know, I felt like there was such a leap between what I was doing, you know, ten years ago to the type of work that I wanted to be doing that I'm doing now. And I feel like this space is, it's given space for me to do stuff like this because technically these tools have always been around for me to use.
00:05:11.950 - 00:05:57.334, Speaker A: I just never really had a reason to because I was always chasing some like gallery show or selling physical work to people. And so it's been really nice. And also I feel like I'm probably not the only one who feels this way, but, you know, nfts have given me a place to kind of continue doing a lot of the art that I've always wanted to do. I feel like a lot of my stuff, the physicals, they don't really live very well inside an interior, like inside someone's home, maybe at, like a bar or some club or, like some lively place. But a lot of the stuff that I make, it's kind of loud. It's very, very colorful. It's not something that I personally would want to have, like, on the wall in my living room.
00:05:57.334 - 00:06:42.278, Speaker A: However, on your computer or your phone, it looks great. That is so funny. And I think I had a similar sort of situation to you, at least with the animation side of things. I mean, I was kind of a little bit of a snob about, you know, static art. You know, I like, I was sort of like. I kind of prefer the non moving art was how I came into this space. But, you know, becoming a collector and then really developing the appreciation for gifts, basically, if we're loosely called or, you know, moving art, I really warmed up to it, and now I make it every so often, you know.
00:06:42.278 - 00:07:32.194, Speaker A: So that is definitely one of the ways that I have been impacted. So that's very interesting what you say. So, in a sense, you felt like your work didn't fit very well in a home, but, you know, but with the blockchain and with NFTs is another way of phrasing that. Do you feel like you have a more consumable product loosely called? Yeah, definitely. I felt like a lot of what I was, was making before was geared towards it'd be good for, like, posters and advertising and eye catching stuff, but it wasn't really something that you'd want to, like, look at every single day. Just, like, really busy, very loud, lots of implied movement. You know, just, you know, I feel like what lives inside people's interiors very well is, like, very minimal, quiet stuff.
00:07:32.194 - 00:07:56.720, Speaker A: It's kind of true. I mean, I have a friend who has some pretty edgy stuff on his walls. But, I mean, it's definitely a statement, let's put it that way. It's like torn up metal and all this sort of thing. It takes a certain collector and a certain person to want to live with, like, some psychedelic art on your wall. Yeah, it is a statement, and, yeah, beautifully put. Well, we have already some people on stage here.
00:07:56.720 - 00:08:14.512, Speaker A: Edge Q, doctor version. I have sent out some invites, and again, a beautiful crowd. We have k blein, curator at object. We have Mikel. We have drank frazetta, who must be rich by now with his pepe winnings. So welcome, everybody. Feel free to join us on stage.
00:08:14.512 - 00:08:19.044, Speaker A: Edge Q. Great to hear from you. I believe you're out of Puerto Rico. How are things going?
00:08:19.864 - 00:08:29.044, Speaker B: Hey, Adrian. Nice to. Nice to see everybody here? Everything's going cool. Kind of a heat wave right now. I'm a work and staying cool.
00:08:29.464 - 00:08:43.724, Speaker A: Well, I'm not surprised that you're staying cool, edgeq, and I am very jealous. I mean, it has gotten a little bit nicer. The sun has come out here in Berlin at least, but it's still kind of the cool air a little bit, you know, high of 18 celsius, that sort of thing.
00:08:44.184 - 00:08:45.764, Speaker B: I envy you a bit.
00:08:46.304 - 00:09:11.434, Speaker A: That's hilarious. Well, I'd gladly trade at least for a week or so. So tell me, I mean, I'm actually a big fan of your work and how you'll make audio and whatnot. So tell us, how is, you know, I guess refresh our memory a little bit. Like, when did you come in and are you making the same thing that you make now that you made before you kind of discovered this whole NfT situation?
00:09:11.974 - 00:10:16.816, Speaker B: Well, I came in about two years ago, kind of like start of the bull, like the really big bull market, I think. And really it changed fundamentally how I do things, Nft, because I used to make music, and I would release my music in Soundcloud. I would release music and Instagram and all those spaces, but I didn't have space to kind of, well, monetize my work or try to reap rewards from my work. When I got into NFTs, I saw a space where I could move my music, and I saw a space filled with collectors, I think more so than the technology. It's the collectors who changed how I do things because I wanted to offer something. And that's how I kind of found my way into this audio visual kind of work. I'm basically doing collages, and those collages, I do a soundtrack for it, right.
00:10:16.816 - 00:10:51.736, Speaker B: And it's kind of opened my, my world in terms of collaborating with people, in terms of finding new collectors, new creators. And it's been really healthy for me. And they changed my art fundamentally. Like, I pushed myself to do things I wouldn't have done before I started drawing. It's been two years drawing, and I think I kind of got good after two years. And that's good in terms for me to try other things. I'm trying to code right now.
00:10:51.736 - 00:10:55.704, Speaker B: I'm trying to make gifts. So, yeah, it's been fundamentally changed.
00:10:56.324 - 00:12:19.854, Speaker A: That is so cool that, you know, again, it's like you came out of music, and then I think a lot of people, I mean, I guess what I'm trying to say here is the market, you know, the fact that people would actually give you, you know, buy and sell your work, and that people actually wanted to buy your work. For example, I mean, again, you're a musician. Let's say, say, where are you going to sell your work? I mean, we all know a million musicians who are super talented. I know an incredible guitar, kind of bluegrass like guy. He should be at the top of the charts, and he's basically unemployed and going to do a woodworking degree and so to pay his life. So, I mean, so I think it's beautiful that I think the market has really just stimulated a lot of us to go, okay, what is my quote unquote product? A lot of people don't like that word, but what am I selling? And how can I retain my poetic credibility in the process? And maybe I'm restating what you said in different words, but do you kind of agree with that, that ultimately the market kind of, you know, incentivized you to add, you know, visuals and collages, learn how to draw?
00:12:21.034 - 00:13:07.154, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, most definitely. Because in terms of just making music and offering the music, there's not a lot of people that just buy that. Right. And adding the visuals to the music is kind of like going full circle because I really think that music and art go together like lp covers in the music. They go together real well, and they do different stuff in terms of presenting an image that maybe the music doesn't complete, but when you see the image and the audio, you get the full picture. So, yeah, in terms of offering a product, diversifying in terms of that, yeah, it pushed me to draw and try to do other stuff.
00:13:08.734 - 00:13:59.582, Speaker A: I'm really glad that you bring up the music. NFTs, what was it, a couple weeks ago, maybe three weeks ago, when the Tezos foundation was at New York and they had some people invited to speak. There's a couple of guys talking about music on the Tezos blockchain, and they were bringing up the market and talking about Spotify, iTunes, all this stuff, and going through the numbers about how many listens do you need or how much do you need to push yourself on Spotify to get x return? And they're talking about how advantageous it is to just sell your music on the blockchain using tezos. And one point that they brought up that I didn't even really consider is that, like, unlike on tezzo.
00:13:59.718 - 00:14:00.078, Speaker B: Sorry.
00:14:00.126 - 00:14:47.380, Speaker A: Unlike on Spotify and these, like, streaming platforms, money aside, you don't get that opportunity to connect with your collector. And, you know, that's one advantage to, you know, music. NFTs is that you get to connect with collectors, you get to meet other creatives, and I think that's really cool. You know, unfortunately, I don't really. I'm like, one downside for me, because, like, I'm primarily interested in the blockchain for the visual arts. I love all the music stuff, but, like, you know, being a visual artist, I'm kind of, like. I have this bias towards, like, you know, even though I see the visual and then there's, like, someone puts a beat behind it, my brain is geared towards seeing it as, you know, visual first, you know, audio second.
00:14:47.380 - 00:15:01.244, Speaker A: And it takes me a long time to see someone putting out, like, because you put out a lot of music, and the first few times I saw your stuff, I was like, oh, this is like, just, you know, visual art paired with music. But really it's kind of the other way around.
00:15:03.664 - 00:15:24.568, Speaker B: Yeah, I try to make it. It started that way. It's kind of gotten in terms of the music a bit more flowing. But I started making remixes of the artist, which the card was based. So the audio was made first and the card was made second, which I love.
00:15:24.616 - 00:15:49.334, Speaker A: I love all the, you know, because, like, there's a lot of artists on here who, you know, a lot of their work utilizes, like, pop culture references. But what's cool is to see, like, you know, the remixed, you know, or sampled music, but then you have, like, a visual reference towards the artist. You always choose good ones, too. I love all the, like, nineties hip hop that you tend to sample and remix and use.
00:15:50.074 - 00:16:09.534, Speaker B: Thanks, man. Thanks. It's kind of, I also want to make a point. Like, I think collage is really, really close to sampling music. And I think those two go together, like, I don't know, just hosta meatballs, whatever, but they go together really nice.
00:16:10.074 - 00:16:49.962, Speaker A: 100%. I totally agree. And I love your remixes, too, actually. And what's so kind of interesting about it, even though the music did come first, I loved the visuals, like, and the whole trading cards in the mylar thing. I mean, that's a, you know, for lack of better term trope that I used, like, a ton and, like, old drawings that I did of baseball cards, but I would put them in the, you know, in the mylar thing with the, you know, grade on it and everything because there's something just kind of, like, just kind of. I almost want to use the word, like, fetishistic of these kind of, like, trading cards in that mylar. So, anyway, very.
00:16:49.962 - 00:16:56.570, Speaker A: Again, and just a final thing before we kind of, since we're on the music and we may not return to it, although feel free to bring it in.
00:16:56.602 - 00:16:58.490, Speaker B: Anybody is.
00:16:58.642 - 00:17:09.681, Speaker A: Have you thought of using the NFTs as a kind of springboard where you put, like, the. The link to your track on Spotify from your NFT that might be on.
00:17:09.737 - 00:17:42.154, Speaker B: Object edge q. I haven't considered that. I was going to start trying to do that in terms of this year because I know there's a lot of people that do that. There's a dude who I consider my blockchain brother, Jayburn. He's been doing real dope stuff with that, and he's always looking to Spotify. So, yeah, I kind of have to, in lack of a better word, double dip. So I need to do the cartoon object and move those beats to Spotify.
00:17:42.494 - 00:18:07.802, Speaker A: I mean, wouldn't that be amazing to start building your audience like that? Like, it's almost like one of those funnels, you know, that they have those marketing funnels, and then you just have people like myself who never, you know, how are you going to find, you know, each other? Like, I probably would never, would have come across your music. And here we are. Because we're on object and we like this Tasos business. All of a sudden, I could be subscribing to your, or following you, whatever they do on Spotify.
00:18:07.978 - 00:18:08.674, Speaker B: Uh, so.
00:18:08.714 - 00:18:24.218, Speaker A: And on YouTube or whatever, so. Fascinating. Well, thank you, Edge Q, for getting us started here. Feel free to stay on stage. You have a great radio voice, by the way. And Kane, I believe you're a new member to the stage here. Welcome to the show.
00:18:24.218 - 00:18:25.534, Speaker A: Where are you calling from?
00:18:28.784 - 00:18:41.032, Speaker B: Oh, I had to hit the microphone. Yeah, my bad. Yeah, I'm in. I'm in the states. I've been in the space like two, almost three years. So this is becoming super fun for me. And I get it.
00:18:41.032 - 00:18:45.096, Speaker B: I'm an NFT musician. That's the other reason why I came up, because that's nice.
00:18:45.280 - 00:19:04.972, Speaker A: 100% perfect segue from Edge Q here. So tell us your story. So now, did you feel like, in a sense, it's pretty difficult as we're kind of discussing to be a musician out there. So did you feel like there was more just kind of opportunity, for lack of a better term, in the NFT space for you?
00:19:05.148 - 00:19:13.864, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, 100%. My career was over. Like, super. Like, not even a little bit. Like it was a rap. It was done. Like, I'm not even.
00:19:13.864 - 00:19:40.394, Speaker B: I'm a failed struggle rapper. So for me, the ability to do any of this stuff, like, every day I wake up is like, yay. And I'm sometimes maybe a little bit more. Ah, come on. Even with some of the stuff in the space that maybe could be a little bit better because you come from rap. This is all, you know, rap is like coal mining child labor. Yeah.
00:19:40.394 - 00:19:54.766, Speaker B: And this. Go clean your room. And I'm like, okay, I got a room. So, yeah, it's easy to be thankful here, but I was never a visual artist. I've never done visual art, ever. Not once. I can't draw.
00:19:54.766 - 00:20:04.074, Speaker B: I still can't draw. I learned how to be a visual artist here, and I meant on five chains.
00:20:04.894 - 00:20:19.264, Speaker A: Wow. And so do you do the same thing as edge queue? I don't know if, you know, edge cues work, but do you do the same thing where you'll put, like, you'll make a visual in order to kind of put out your music, but maybe the visual becomes an end in itself after doing it a few times.
00:20:19.644 - 00:20:33.224, Speaker B: Um, a little bit. I make AI music videos. Oh, cool. Uh, my friends call them ganimation. So that's. That's what I make. I mean, I've been making AI music videos since 20, like the summer of 21.
00:20:33.224 - 00:20:59.414, Speaker B: And that's, you know, when. When I first learned about AI and it was called Gans back then, I was like, oh, wait, so I don't have to know how to draw? Oh, this is great, because I was starting to get worried. And Rob Nissa gave me, he told me about photo mosh and scrilla, rare. Skrilla is the one that onboarded me. But, you know, Skrilla's scrilla, so he's not like, do this and do that and do it this way. He's just like, hey, man, go make friends. You're you.
00:20:59.414 - 00:21:20.716, Speaker B: That was weird advice, but it actually ends up panning out. So that's what, that's really what I've been doing for the last, you know, two and a half, almost three years, is I make. I make my pictures for the songs. The songs aren't new. Most of my songs are old. I mean, these are songs from before. I'm doing new music that I'm gonna release in an album now.
00:21:20.716 - 00:21:26.100, Speaker B: But everything I've done so far has been music. Like reaganomics was from 2008.
00:21:26.252 - 00:21:28.264, Speaker A: Reaganomics was that.
00:21:30.804 - 00:21:59.644, Speaker B: Nobody should care about that record, man. Like, nobody's supposed to care about none of these songs. I just need us going on DNS. I think the gentleman that was just speaking earlier, edge Q. So the Jay burn does a lot of stuff on DNS. DNS just revamped their site, and they're relaunching it. They just did the launch yesterday, and they have that kind of a whitelist open signup thing.
00:21:59.644 - 00:22:44.614, Speaker B: I'm one of the first featured artists on DNS, and that's, you know, show cool and click and really good people, you know, really, really nice people. But they do a music aggregator. So one of the biggest problems with music nfts, which is a constant pain in the ass, especially for those of us who are trying to establish a collector base. Where do they enjoy this at? Do they got to go to their wallet? Do they got to go to a platform? Like, where do they play it at? I mean, you can't expect everybody to download stuff. So DNS is at the very minimum of what they do. They're an aggregator. So anything you make on Tez, anything you make on ETH, anything you make on polygon, you can sweep into there and make a playlist out of it, even if you don't own it.
00:22:45.434 - 00:22:51.934, Speaker A: So it's pretty cool. Go ahead. Sorry. Yeah, that's. That's really cool. This is. I haven't heard of this yet.
00:22:53.274 - 00:23:16.750, Speaker B: DNS, dot XYZ. I don't work for them. I'm just. I think they're nice people, and I think because I talk nice about them, uh, when I asked them if they were interested in doing something with me for reaganomics, not Reagan, um, for new Jack City, they were like, yeah, let's do it. But, yeah, I make nineties rapidly rap, man. I'm not like, I don't make, like, trap and drill. So I'm already a niche of a niche.
00:23:16.750 - 00:23:30.046, Speaker B: And where I'm. I'm a proficient Mc, I'm good at what I do. I'm never gonna be at the Grammys. Like, I'm never gonna be. And people in this space, they're, you know, they're dreamers. So they don't like, when you talk like that. Don't you say that, K.
00:23:30.046 - 00:23:34.874, Speaker B: You can. I'm like, ah, I'm fucking 41. I'm a grown up. Like, you know, I'm all right.
00:23:35.294 - 00:23:39.206, Speaker A: I've accepted. I like the dose of reality that you bring to.
00:23:39.390 - 00:23:46.118, Speaker B: Yeah, I was a stockbroker. Like, I'm not. I'm not pie in the sky. I'm very pragmatic. I just had a baby. My son's grazing the other room, pooping, probably. It's great.
00:23:46.118 - 00:24:08.880, Speaker B: So, you know, like, I'm having fun. And even though I make less money doing this, I do this full time. I make less doing this than I did working, but I'm happy. Yeah. And when I turn to my girl, yeah, I can go back to selling timeshare, but, like, that's an awful business. And how much did I drink? Like, now, I haven't drank in months. Not like a holy roller.
00:24:08.880 - 00:24:10.336, Speaker B: I just don't need it, Jeff.
00:24:10.360 - 00:24:38.558, Speaker A: Well, it's a little known fact that I actually used to try and sell timeshares, too, when I was 20 years old in Sassatoon, Saskatchewan. So I've been there. And you know what's hilarious about that? And then we'll maybe speed things up a bit here. But what's hilarious about that? I was on the task. Like, I was selling timeshares for, like, three months. I didn't make a single sale until there was 1 minute left in my final shift. And it was like, you know, 05:59 p.m.
00:24:38.558 - 00:25:09.138, Speaker A: And I made. It was, like, euphoria across the workspace. Adrian made a sale, everybody. And it was hilarious. That's a true story. So I've been there, and I really like what you were saying earlier, cain, about, you know, this idea, I think, like, and I don't know if many people would admit it, but I think a lot of people might like, in a sense, these are kind of all the people that didn't make it in a lot of ways. Like, this space attracts a lot of people that didn't make it, in a sense.
00:25:09.186 - 00:25:11.808, Speaker B: Land and misfit toys, in a sense.
00:25:11.986 - 00:25:13.476, Speaker C: And that's good.
00:25:13.620 - 00:25:51.024, Speaker A: But the thing is, like, I mean, the flip side of that is, like, I don't really like a lot of the music at the Grammys. I don't really like a lot of the art that I necessarily see that we're all supposed to love. So, in a weird way, you know, it's, like, not always the best stuff, kind of quote unquote makes it so that's kind of what's beautiful. And I'm kind of back to this market situation because I wonder, is it just like, because we have a free market, so to speak, not to get too, like, economic on things, but I wonder to myself, is this just a better engine for producing better work?
00:25:51.324 - 00:26:12.792, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, it can be. And again, I'm my opinion and a token to get you on the bus. Right. But I think it can be when we remember our why and don't get blinded by the tinsel. You know, I've seen a ton of musicians that come into this space, and they're just trying to parlay web3 into a record deal, and I'm like, bro, I come from the music business. Like, I.
00:26:12.792 - 00:26:26.364, Speaker B: I know you don't know who I am, but believe me, I walk backstage without paying. I'm. I'm. I met all my heroes. I'm the most famous nobody you've ever met. I worked really hard. I was on the road half the year.
00:26:26.364 - 00:26:50.540, Speaker B: And the music business doesn't work that way. As far as the music business is concerned, you're paddling around with terrorists. No one wants a literate slave. We in there teaching niggas about blockchain. They don't want that all. Plus, your idea fair is grossly out of whack for what they are expecting you to be. In the music business, you already have concepts of royalties and perpetual royalties and ownership that.
00:26:50.540 - 00:27:03.080, Speaker B: No, artists ain't supposed to use those words. They're supposed to buy you shoes like a kept woman, put you in the studio, go make those hits while they run your budget up. Well, that's the, that's the world, so. Sorry.
00:27:03.112 - 00:27:03.888, Speaker A: Make your point.
00:27:04.016 - 00:27:22.244, Speaker B: Yeah, just. Just to make the point. With. With this, it can be. But when this space gets blinded by the tinsel and we start clout chasing celebrities, it becomes harder to focus on the fact that, hey, man, we are, in fact, the cool kids table here. You don't need their approval. It doesn't matter if you know Mario van.
00:27:22.244 - 00:27:59.992, Speaker B: I don't care what Rick Ross thinks. I care what my neighbors think, because the people in this space here are more famous than them. I've sold more nfts than Chris Brown, and I'm nowhere near the size of artists that, that, you know what I'm saying? Like, the artists that opened up for him on tour are bigger than I could ever be. So here I think we have a great opportunity to curate talent, and that talent doesn't need to leave if this neighborhood and this community support them better than they could receive on the outside. There's no greener grass than this to much, in my opinion. But that's only what I've seen.
00:28:00.168 - 00:28:33.642, Speaker A: I completely agree with you. Like, kind of the beauty of this whole digital sort of situation, whether it's me putting out a show or you putting out your music with, like, nobody can stop you. Nobody can stop you. Like, that's what I kind of love about it. Unless someone comes to my house and does something about it, right? But otherwise, like, I can just keep putting my stuff out and it's like, you know, and so that's kind of the beauty of the space. Cain, thank you so much for contributing here. And feel free to stay on stage.
00:28:33.642 - 00:28:48.862, Speaker A: I can hear the music in the way you speak, so I'm not surprised at all that you have some talents in that regard. Doctor version. I see your hand is up. Welcome to the stage. Welcome back. I assume you're calling from Florida.
00:28:49.038 - 00:29:13.670, Speaker D: I am, I am. And I have too many thoughts on this subject. I don't even know where to start because I do have a music background as well. I was doing music in the nineties. I was on a, you know, independent label and then got signed to, you know, affiliate of a major label. And I can tell you that, you know, they just dip. Everyone wants part of what you're making.
00:29:13.670 - 00:29:41.206, Speaker D: Not that I was in a successful band, but I saw how it all breaks down. And, you know, that's the beauty of this. What we're doing now. You can have a thousand fans instead of 100,000, and you probably make more money. There was indie bands that I know that got signed in the nineties that once you're on a major, you're making actually less money. You know, it's crazy, but I know I'm off subject. I don't know.
00:29:41.206 - 00:29:46.542, Speaker D: Pokebelly, what? What do you want to talk about? Because I could go farther on the music front here.
00:29:46.678 - 00:30:13.122, Speaker A: You may be the perfect segue into maybe bringing it a little bit back to the visual. But I'm actually super cool because I think a lot of, as far as this music thing is concerned, because I think a lot of people like artists. Visual artists can totally relate to the music scene. I mean, they're two very difficult businesses. I mean, it's trying to be like an actor in Hollywood. It's one of those, like one person with a dream and nobody that believes them. I mean, is often the case.
00:30:13.122 - 00:30:40.846, Speaker A: Right. So again, more reasons to be just grateful for whatever, you know, we have going on here. So tell me, just in terms of the art. I mean, you started in the visual arts and you're making visual art now. Are you making the same stuff you made before nfts or did nfts kind of shift what you've decided? Like, the way you're sort of releasing work, the work that you're making, has that changed 100%?
00:30:40.950 - 00:31:29.304, Speaker D: I wouldn't even be doing digital art if it wasn't for nfts. Not that I didn't do painting before, and also video art, or if you want to call it art. I used to put together late night tv public access. This is all pre YouTube Brooklyn public access infomercials and kind of cut it together with a camcorder, a vhs deck and a four track and make like, soundtracks to it. And, you know, a group of friends would used to do this. And then we get together, you know, on a Friday or Saturday night, drink beer, smoke weed, and just, you know, laugh so hard. We were like falling over on the ground, like the crazy stuff you could find dig up.
00:31:29.304 - 00:32:01.908, Speaker D: Now with YouTube, you know, you can do it pretty easy, but, you know, putting it together. So my work was a little bit that kind of stuff because I have a BFA and I in my BFA show, my thesis was a painting and then a VHS deck and a tv. So when nfts came along, it kind of like melded both. But what I'm doing now is not. It's video sources, but it looks more like my paintings. So it was this aha moment where I was like, I want to get into this. I started collecting work.
00:32:01.908 - 00:32:28.616, Speaker D: I think one of the first pieces I collected was from Kristen. Roos really loved his work and I wanted to do take. I have all this video stuff. Maybe the world can see it because we were just sharing it with a group of friends, but it wasn't that interesting. I was like, I've seen this before. YouTube exists. This is just like, there's a collective called everything is terrible out of LA.
00:32:28.616 - 00:33:11.950, Speaker D: And they were doing something sort of similar, but, you know, this was in the two thousands we were doing in the nineties and didn't even think of his art. So those are my two influences and it kind of came together. How do I make this? You know, make some work? And I love the gifts and I love the motion. Wait, let's make something that's like my paintings, but that moves. So that's how I arrived at it. And I've never been more inspired other than kind of going back to the nineties with the music scene. And a couple weeks ago has drubble waffle was talking about this, how this diy almost punk nineties ethos exists in this blockchain now.
00:33:11.950 - 00:34:14.946, Speaker D: Because anyone can do it, you can get started. The barriers of entry, I know we've talked about this before, is very low, so it just provides a lot of opportunity. But going back to, like, the stuff in the nineties, there was like, there's tape labels, right, that people were like, oh, you know, fuck corporate music, fuck corporations. Let's just do it ourselves. This goes way back to, like, the Minutemen in punk rock, where it's like this underground scene, pre Nirvana K records with Kelvin Johnson calling it the international pop underground, where people would send tapes from Australia to the US, New Zealand, back and forth, and we'd work on music. And the blockchain has made this and the Internet where you could do it, you know? You know, these, some of these collaborations and how it's all brought it together, I think it's very similar to that. And I was so fucking excited back then for that stuff.
00:34:14.946 - 00:34:23.058, Speaker D: And same as of now. I know that's a little bit of a beautifully all encompassing, all encompassing.
00:34:23.106 - 00:35:04.148, Speaker A: But yeah, I think you, though, captured maybe a lot of the spirit that exists on the blockchain. This kind of, as you said, the do it yourself punk ethos, DIY, in a sense, it's like we'll create our own. We create our own happiness or create our own label, you know, and this sort of thing. And it seems where you get the people with the passion rather than the person that is kind of like at the right place at the right time. The dude with our dudette with all the connections and whatever else. Not everybody is born into that situation. Not everybody gets lucky.
00:35:04.148 - 00:35:34.932, Speaker A: Some people are in the middle of nowhere. You know, I grew up in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, just outside, you know, so, you know, which doesn't afford the same opportunities as someone that's growing up in Brooklyn or New York. So anyways, I totally agree with a lot of what you're saying. Rune toon. Feel free to chime in at any point here. Feel free to interrupt me at any point. Martin, Joe, welcome to the stage and thank you for patience.
00:35:34.932 - 00:35:37.664, Speaker A: It's great to hear from you. Where are you calling in from again?
00:35:38.774 - 00:35:40.430, Speaker B: Hi, guys. How you doing?
00:35:40.622 - 00:35:42.102, Speaker A: It's great to hear you again.
00:35:42.158 - 00:35:52.110, Speaker B: Hello. Hi to everyone, to all the crew. I'm from San Juan, Argentina. Oh, awesome.
00:35:52.182 - 00:35:57.714, Speaker A: I don't know if I ever knew that. We've had you here a couple of times. So you're in Argentina, another argentinian.
00:35:58.294 - 00:36:00.310, Speaker B: Yeah, we are a lot.
00:36:00.462 - 00:36:41.280, Speaker A: You sure are. And I was discussing this with Flora last week. I'm not sure if you were there, but this whole idea that theres a lot of Argentinians on the blockchain because of the economy there, because of the inflation, as she said, I was born into inflation because theres a lot of Argentinians. So its really fascinating. Again, were talking about the market and how being able to sell your work helps actually, in order to create work. But then theres the larger financial landscape where born into inflation, get into crypto, and all of a sudden I'm making art. It's interesting, this relationship between money and art.
00:36:41.280 - 00:36:53.404, Speaker A: So anyway, welcome, Martin Joe, tell us about your art. How did it change or did it stay the same before NFTs came along? Before you discovered nfTs?
00:36:54.344 - 00:37:37.974, Speaker B: Yeah, but into that idea, I think it's very important for artists. I think very important for artists is the money. I mean, we need to eat, we need to live, we need to dress ourselves. And it's a privilege in some cases to be able to make art. You need to have a home, for example. And I'm from a very poor family. And then I started to work, selling things.
00:37:37.974 - 00:38:40.504, Speaker B: And then always I felt that there were no another path for me than art. So I insisted I study art. But here, and even in this town, you just don't have not even a gallery. I mean, the only gallery here was open a year ago. They properly museum 1213 years ago. So a lot of collections and shows start to come from the world, but, well, Internet helped a lot with that. And when I.
00:38:40.504 - 00:39:03.524, Speaker B: I'm a sculptor, I work, I make monuments, I draw a lot. Wow. But yeah, it's been very difficult always for me and for the people here. But we.
00:39:03.904 - 00:39:06.284, Speaker A: Yes, sorry, go ahead.
00:39:10.244 - 00:39:52.794, Speaker B: We are very few from San Juan, Marcos Diaz, Mattia Roarte, Mercedes Jacante, who is not longer, but she paints a lot. And because we live in a very conservative town and people just see the art like a privilege and luxury. Right, but not a passionate way to live your life.
00:39:53.094 - 00:40:27.874, Speaker A: Well, especially sculpture. I mean, I knew a guy, I think he's in Berlin actually, but I knew him in Toronto and I forgot Max, I think is what his name was. And he was doing kind of, you know, sounds like similar business to you, this sort of monumental sculpture. And it was really all about like applying for, you know, grants because otherwise, like if you're making some massive metallic sculpture, I mean, that's not cheap, right? So it's kind of a tough business, in other words.
00:40:28.294 - 00:41:53.794, Speaker B: Yes, it's very expensive even in its requires a big commitment with the space, with the physical space. Is that my conception of the sculpture? You practically have to make a pact with the space. I mean, I live in a shoebox, my monuments, I made it just for commissions and I used an armed house who allowed me to work there. But it's really difficult. So when almost two years ago I found Henry and then was like, well, people are living from their art so I should try it. And was really surprised for me that had a community of really suspiciously nice people and we go and the war art is very tough.
00:41:55.934 - 00:41:58.794, Speaker A: I love, I love that comment.
00:41:59.454 - 00:42:00.674, Speaker B: Stop each other.
00:42:00.974 - 00:42:06.006, Speaker A: Yeah, sorry to interrupt I'm sorry to interrupt. I just love that comment. Suspicious.
00:42:06.070 - 00:42:06.366, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:42:06.430 - 00:42:30.350, Speaker A: Suspiciously nice. That's hilarious. Yeah, because, I mean, anybody that's been in any of these scenes, you know, it's not. It's not as nice as this. You know, there are nice people, but it's also a little bit more suspicious, frankly. And does this person want something from me? You know, where does this person, you know, measure up in the pecking order and all this sort of being reduced to the bare. I mean, in a way, humanity.
00:42:30.350 - 00:42:47.690, Speaker A: Go ahead. In a way. It's kind of nice, though, because you kind of have to be nice. You can't be an asshole if you want to be successful here. You can't really be a dickhead to everyone. Like, you're not going to make a lot of friends in this space. It's true.
00:42:47.690 - 00:43:45.754, Speaker A: I think there's actually a surprisingly strong community aspect to this blockchain where even where you'll buy work or people will buy work from you and they don't even necessarily love the work, but they love you or they like you, or I like that person. So I'm like, so it's kind of interesting that way. It's kind of a mix and it's sort of like. And this brings back, like, the whole idea of selling art because it's actually not that different in the, you know, what I loosely call the contemporary art world. All my sales have either been through people I know or through people that relate to something in the work. Like if they're a stranger and then once in a while, then it's someone who just likes the work, but usually it's like, oh, well, I like this in your work because I have this and then they have some big story, you know? So back to this, kind of relating to it. And in a sense, community kind of is a form of that.
00:43:45.754 - 00:44:00.698, Speaker A: So anyways, shash, welcome to the stage. I think you showed up in, like, one of the first or second spaces we did. You had some very interesting comments, if I remember you. Right. Shash, where are you calling from?
00:44:00.866 - 00:44:16.554, Speaker E: Hey, man, I've been following your YouTube channel pretty religiously as well. I think that's one of my favorite things that have happened. Like, I genuinely think we need more efforts like that. That's your channel, right?
00:44:17.574 - 00:44:43.874, Speaker A: It sure is, yeah. Yeah. I don't even know what it means. As I often say at the start of the show, it's kind of hilarious to just do something like that in a weird way. You know, it's almost like a performance art piece in my own mind to a certain degree, you know, like, what am I doing over here? You know, I ask myself, you know, but anyways, I appreciate that. And so tell us a little bit, like, you're a collector more. Is that right? Do I remember that right?
00:44:43.994 - 00:45:25.330, Speaker E: Yeah, I'm trying to be one. I'm trying to even, like, sort of manage my mindset as a collector and an investor. And also, like, I really like the way these industries move. I like to be a bit of an anthropologist as well, to figure out, you know, where people's sort of emotions, understandings, and, like, finances as well move as well. I think it's quite interesting to see, you know, where we started with this space. Like, I had the fortune to be very early in this space. Like, I got into crypto back in 2016.
00:45:25.330 - 00:46:18.994, Speaker E: I minted my first NFT with cryptokitties in 2017. I minted my first, like, personal collection just to give away to my community in 2018. So, like, we've been, I've been trading NFTs since there was no open sea. So it used to be telegram groups and stuff. So, like, been doing a lot of, like, silly, crazy things for a very long time. But it's not always easy to find value. And, like, at the end of the day, if one has to spend, like, a lot of time in this space, like, a part of it can be fun in games and you can support friends and do the whole, like, the community side of things, but then at some point of time, it needs to make sense that, hey, like, are you kind of spending just time having fun and doing stuff? Are you looking at it from a, you know, growth, development and wealth perspective as well? So usually trying to solve this question in my head as often as I can.
00:46:20.454 - 00:47:03.390, Speaker A: Yeah, those are very good questions because, you know, I think a lot of people kind of struggle with the, you know, okay, how am I. Am I taking this serious enough or is this just fun and games? I mean, for certain people, it doesn't have to be something that you become financially successful doing. It's just the act of being able to, you know, continue your creative work, which is worth it enough. I feel like, you know, in talking with everyone here, a lot of what brings people into NFTs is that kind of like, you know, that financial dream. Oh, you see someone who's, who's able to live off of their creative work and you think to yourself, okay, well, I may as well give this a shot. Like, that would be. That'd be amazing.
00:47:03.390 - 00:47:33.616, Speaker A: And then you find there's a whole community of people that kind of give you the encouragement and, you know, community that you need in order to continue doing your work. Because, you know, with, without this, a lot of people, it's just kind of like, why make a painting? Because you're just, you know, like, what, what's it going to do for you at the end of the day if you don't have a gallery or a collector base or even a group of friends to, to connect it with.
00:47:33.780 - 00:47:46.472, Speaker E: Exactly. So this is why, like, the art nft side of things in the whole blockchain space is most exciting for me is because this is one place where money isn't primary importance.
00:47:46.528 - 00:47:46.696, Speaker F: Right?
00:47:46.720 - 00:48:48.856, Speaker E: It is important because the moment you mint something on the blockchain, you want to sell it like you're doing it for commercial purposes. But that said, there is a lot of amazing arts, a lot of amazing artists with low editions for like one test, which is insane. And seeing those things happen and people genuinely like just doing it because they enjoy it, because they just like, being in this space is such a, such a different world from the old coin and the bitcoin and the defi and the gaming web3 gaming world that I come from where it's either like it's either gonna go to the moon or it's a shitcoin. But here there is a lot of amazing art, which is severely undervalued, but people are fine with it. They're like, this is what I want to mint it. And that, that kind of, like, presence makes it such an interesting space in the world of complete chaos. And I'm pretty fascinated by seeing all this and, like, really, like, seeing your YouTube channel, it really brings, like, fun and culture kind of put together and, like, I've been enjoying that quite a bit.
00:48:48.856 - 00:48:54.204, Speaker E: So you invited me to sweep. That's amazing. But I just wanted to say, man, like, don't stop doing that.
00:48:55.334 - 00:49:36.022, Speaker A: I totally appreciate that and, yeah, I just totally appreciate that. And, you know, to your point about the art being kind of special and it being so cheap, you know, what it reminds me of is like Marvel Comics in the 1960s, you know, like, it's like, yeah, you could buy a fantastic four number one for probably $50 in 1965, you know, maybe less. And that's kind of what it reminds me of. Like, it's got so many classics, so many characters that you can really real, you know, for lack of better term, and I don't love to describe artists as brands, but what I call real brands, you know, for lack of better terms.
00:49:36.078 - 00:49:36.270, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:49:36.302 - 00:49:54.494, Speaker E: But then the Marvel business completely collapsed when people were thinking they were buying limited editions. And late eighties, the entire Marvel company business from a secondary market totally collapsed because they were minting a ton of these rare sort of edits.
00:49:54.614 - 00:50:11.382, Speaker A: I was there. I was. I saw it firsthand. And, yeah, I remember where special covers and hologram covers, that was near the end. And then the gold foil covers. Yeah, and then, you know, and then they killed Superman. And, yeah, I was working in a comic shop, so I had a front row seat.
00:50:11.382 - 00:50:33.334, Speaker A: Shash, I'm so glad that you come back. We're here every week. I'd love to just hear from you all the time. San Diego, you've been waiting very patiently here, and I have a feeling you're going to have some pretty interesting things to say about how your art changed with NFTs. How are you doing? You're in Uruguay, as my girlfriend says, to pronounce it.
00:50:33.874 - 00:50:39.824, Speaker G: I am, yeah. How are you, Adrian? How is everybody doing?
00:50:39.864 - 00:50:40.444, Speaker B: Great.
00:50:41.584 - 00:50:43.424, Speaker G: I'm very glad to be here.
00:50:43.504 - 00:50:44.924, Speaker B: Rome.
00:50:46.224 - 00:52:18.714, Speaker G: Martin. I loved listening to Martin because it's culturally the same. Argentina and Duruguay are one next to each other, so it was great to listen to this friend talking about how art works there. It was also crazy because he said, we are like, he started a list of artists from his province. And I think that in my whole country, the number is tinier, but my country is little, in fact. So, yeah, NFTs changed my work big time. As shash was saying, if there's no audience, maybe why do this? I never felt that I would have continued to make my drawings and stuff forever, but, yeah, since I started on hen one year and a half ago, I have learned some basic creative coding and some crazy things about different ways to interact with computers to make art.
00:52:18.714 - 00:52:23.106, Speaker G: So, yeah, it has changed big time.
00:52:23.290 - 00:52:32.798, Speaker A: Sorry, go ahead. Runtin. Oh, no. I was. I was just so sorry. I thought you were trying to say something. My mistake.
00:52:32.798 - 00:52:53.174, Speaker A: We're trying to get synced up better, but go ahead if you have a question. Sorry. So, Santiago, you said you were doing art, and I totally relate to you, like, in the sense that I don't know how much attention you're getting, but it sounds like you're going to do it no matter what. You know, you're gonna make.
00:52:53.214 - 00:52:53.558, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:52:53.646 - 00:52:55.630, Speaker A: Even if nobody's paying attention.
00:52:55.822 - 00:52:57.118, Speaker G: I was making my.
00:52:57.246 - 00:52:58.274, Speaker A: Yeah, go ahead.
00:52:58.574 - 00:53:09.114, Speaker G: I was making my ink drawings and my. It's a lot of paper stuff. In some years ago.
00:53:12.374 - 00:53:14.862, Speaker B: I lived somehow.
00:53:14.918 - 00:54:15.544, Speaker G: With help with my parents. I was a very old to adult person, but I was making my work with paper and living from some sales from that. It was very hard, and my kid was about to be born, and I started renting bikes for my parents and drawing while I was sitting, renting bikes. But I wouldn't have stopped making art. Yeah, I'm glad it's back to be my main activity the whole day and then that it provides, even if you have a three, four hour show, it's just my opinion. I know artists work differently. It's the best thing for me if it's my main activity and it's providing for me.
00:54:15.544 - 00:54:35.200, Speaker G: It has a sense of achievement, first of all. And I think that the barrier to think of something as professional work is to be earning from it, I guess so, totally.
00:54:35.312 - 00:55:16.032, Speaker A: There's nothing like that kind of confirmation from the market that, you know, that it wants your work. And then, you know, oftentimes as an artist, like, especially because you make so few sales, let's say, in the physical art world or contemporary art world, oftentimes that you feel like it's a fluke. There's almost like an imposter syndrome if you sell one, right? But here, I mean, it's like, it's a fairly large. It's not huge, but it's a big enough scene where you can feel kind of. You can feel pretty good about selling your work. Like someone actually likes what I'm doing here, and that can really give that extra confidence. Right.
00:55:16.032 - 00:55:17.444, Speaker A: I mean, yeah.
00:55:18.584 - 00:55:25.768, Speaker G: I also think that this was a comment I heard from someone in the space who is for more time.
00:55:25.856 - 00:55:30.464, Speaker B: But we were talking, I was, like.
00:55:30.584 - 00:56:20.644, Speaker G: Bringing up that I'm very happy to be able to afford living, right? And this person was telling me that it's crazy how in the contemporary art world, or most of all, in the physical trading of artworks, right. In my country, for example, there's probably, like ten people that live from art with some big income compared to any other that is not living from it, like, selling for some huge money, but then. And nothing in the middle till the people that are making zero money from their art.
00:56:20.724 - 00:56:36.354, Speaker A: Right, exactly. Sky Guzman made a nice comment about how a lot of this stuff, you know, it doesn't have to be those huge sales that you live off of, but that, you know, these smaller ones are meaningful. I see that Kane has their hand up. Kane, did you have something you wanted to contribute?
00:56:36.814 - 00:56:54.334, Speaker B: Well, yeah, the. The. Yeah, the selling part, emotionally, took me for a ride a lot farther than I thought it would. I danced around my living room like kung fu panda, and I'm a big fan of not riding the wave. Like, good things happen, bad things happen. You're an artist. Don't ride the wave because you stay.
00:56:54.334 - 00:57:19.436, Speaker B: Just stay even. Right? But I was like, they booked. Someone bought my NFT. I was very happy. It's very happy. But when I did, the numbers on it is kind of what made it make the most amount of sense. A song that sat on Soundcloud for six years, right? It had 1200 plays, 14 retweet reclaim whatever Soundcloud calls a retweet, like a few downloads in one comment.
00:57:19.436 - 00:57:41.142, Speaker B: In six years, I made four. I mean, one NfT out of it made four copies, sold two in two days. The two I sold got me the same amount I would have gotten had I had done 300,000 Spotify plays. I'm not Spotify. Um, yes, the 300,000 Spotify plays, that is insane. I can't do 300,000 Spotify plays. That's.
00:57:41.198 - 00:58:09.934, Speaker A: That's what they were talking about at that Tezos conference. Is that the numbers just, it's like, it, it adds up that it'd be insane to try and pursue a musical career by streaming on Spotify or the major platforms, and that it makes so much more sense just to throw it on the blockchain because even a thousandth or a 10,000th of streams. Listen, you know, buys would give you more money than what it would take on Spotify.
00:58:10.314 - 00:58:41.876, Speaker B: I know I'm music centric. I'm sorry, I know I'm music centric. Right? But I think that there's a correlation these days, especially between physical or visual artists and musicians. It's closer now than it's been in probably about, you know, 100 years where, you know, before, you know, the glamorous life of pursuing musician and painter was kind of this obscure thing for most people. You don't know how that happens. One day you're nobody, next day you're in a gallery. That's kind of how the world sees it, you know? One day you're.
00:58:41.876 - 00:58:58.916, Speaker B: You're nobody rapping on a corner, the next day you're biggie smalls. It's how the world sees it. No one sees that. Ten years to make an overnight success part. But even now, for musicians, your music doesn't even matter. You have to do your 27.2 TikToks per week.
00:58:58.916 - 00:59:27.216, Speaker B: You have to go live on Instagram. You're 8.9 times a week. You have to do all this digital busking. So musicians are back to doing the same thing that artists in Times Square are doing. Hey, can I draw your picture? Trying to get someone to notice their talent and your talent, it matters, kind of, but without all that extra stuff, it doesn't. And this is the first place I've seen where an artist, no matter what your discipline is, an artist can just do their thing and find their tribe.
00:59:27.216 - 00:59:30.044, Speaker B: You'll 500 collectors. And I'm good.
00:59:30.944 - 01:00:11.190, Speaker A: I've done shows bigger than that, 100%. Like, you know, the financials thing aside, like, not that I'm not trying to pursue that, but yeah, I've been a visual artist this whole time. And then there was like a three year period or so where I just didn't have a gallery, I didn't have any connections, I didn't have anyone to really share it with besides a small group of people. And like what you described, oh, shit, someone just bought my music. That in itself is like, that's a valuable feeling and that can drive a lot of creativity. And I think that that's probably one way that NFTs have changed people's art.
01:00:11.382 - 01:00:12.874, Speaker B: You know, for the better.
01:00:13.894 - 01:00:50.782, Speaker A: Beautifully put. It's almost, it's kind of back to this whole market idea, you know, it's. And because it's fairly cheap at this point, you know, you can sell for a dollar and that's okay. And even doing that, like, I remember when I was starting on object and nobody knew who I was to make a sale was such a rush. It's just the fact that anybody is willing to put their hard earned cash and give you something for it was just like, I totally relate to what Cain was saying there. You just want to jump for joy because. And you're making like, you know, messaging your girlfriend and everything.
01:00:50.782 - 01:01:03.804, Speaker A: Someone bought the piece. Ed Marolla, I'm so thrilled you came on stage here and you made it. I know sometimes it can be a tight schedule for you, so I'm going to jump to you. How have NFTs changed your art?
01:01:04.704 - 01:01:19.372, Speaker B: Oh, man. Hello, everyone. Welcome. Hey, glad to find a. We got a grandma here with the baby, so I'm okay. We got a. Oh, man.
01:01:19.372 - 01:02:25.838, Speaker B: Nft. Like, just, just actually, I was working this, this thing about music is so true. So, so true because I was working with music and I was doing soundtracks and sound design for tv shows and kind of stuff here and I, I had actually a pretty good job doing that. It's like a major network here for a long twelve years. And then at some point during the pandemic and just being home and isolated and that kind of stuff, I started drawing so I never, I never did draw before. So I was thinking, oh, I got some music here that I made and I could do, like, cover art for my, for my music. And I started trying with pixel art and stuff.
01:02:25.838 - 01:03:16.262, Speaker B: And me and my brother, we were doing pixel art together. And at some point, I showed to my friend, who is a designer, and he said, oh, this looks like crypto art. What the hell? And he showed me he couldn't. And he was in the first popula D Latada show, that very first, like, in the first weeks. And sadly, he didn't go on with, with crypto art. He's still doing, like, commercial gigs and stuff. And I started believing that I could draw because at that point, I was just a musician trying to make some cover art for myself.
01:03:16.262 - 01:03:42.914, Speaker B: Amazing. And so I can probably say that NFTs did not change my art. It just make my whole visual art thing. I was into. I was into art. I was doing, like, art classes, but sound arts and music, very focused on music. I have an art background because my, my mother is a art teacher.
01:03:42.914 - 01:04:22.076, Speaker B: She's been teaching art at schools for. Since forever. But, yeah, NFTs and this collective, I was saying, like, in that art nom tweet earlier this morning, this global creative family, this is great. I can see some people here that I have to thank a lot for changing, for talking and everything. Well, great.
01:04:22.260 - 01:05:07.044, Speaker A: It's great to hear from you, Ed. And it's so interesting how many people here kind of come out of music. And I mean, and your story is especially, you know, interesting in the sense that you, doesn't sound like you had some huge, in a sense, like, art ambitions. You're making covers which you have to do as a musician. Right? Like, I mean, and then all of a sudden. But what's so interesting for me about that is you're one of the most prolific people in the space, right? So even if you say start late, if you're making like, ten works a day, or whatever the case might be, or three works a day, you move fast when you're working, right? Like, you see it in your work.
01:05:07.464 - 01:05:59.934, Speaker B: I have to, I have to point out, because I don't think it goes without notice, that since I had a good job, I was able to save some good money for myself, so I could spend like one year doing very little jobs, those paying jobs, because I had, like, I had, I had like a hundred songs playing on tv. So I had those royalties coming in. So I was in a position I could afford to just stop everything and dedicate myself to a new thing, even though I was 35 at the moment. So, yeah.
01:06:00.714 - 01:06:10.664, Speaker A: Ed, have you, you know, since joining and starting to do nfTs, is there a lot of. Did you discover a lot of art or music that you really liked?
01:06:11.364 - 01:06:21.024, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Like. Like, everyone here, like, most of the people here just make my mind blow every time.
01:06:21.444 - 01:06:42.840, Speaker A: Because, you know, to be honest, I think one powerful way that the NFTs have changed me, it's not necessarily the art that I do, but, like, the art that I'm looking at, like, my mind just, you know, in the last two years, like, I. There's so much radically different art from what I was looking at three, three or four years ago before I got involved with nfTs.
01:06:43.032 - 01:07:22.044, Speaker B: And you know, what? Like, once you start to. To accompany, like, oh, what is. What is tooks doing last year? What took is doing Tuks is doing now. How is it evolving when he tries to make music? What does he do when he tries to make AI, when he's doing that collage and. And all the guys here and everyone here, we get to personalize it. And I know it's very different from, like, just browsing on a. On a social media, and you just like that art.
01:07:22.044 - 01:07:26.748, Speaker B: Oh, nice art. You give it a heart, and you go for the next. No, you. Right.
01:07:26.876 - 01:07:40.354, Speaker A: So much more meaningful than just, like, liking something. I also like. I mean, I do get a personal satisfaction out of collecting, like, an artist that I like, especially if it's, like, you know, no sweat off my shoulders to do so.
01:07:41.254 - 01:07:46.302, Speaker B: It feels good. Yeah, it's amazing. It's fun.
01:07:46.358 - 01:08:24.962, Speaker A: It's fun to support. And again, like, the market factor is so interesting in the sense that when you start to sell work, I mean, then you want to make more because you go, oh, well, maybe I want to take a vacation this year, and I can't afford to now, but maybe if I make some work and. And also just, like, experiments and pixel art, like, I wouldn't be doing experiments in pixel art, for example, you know, whether these eight badoo, you know, nature works or just kind of playing with a square brush. And we can debate the definition of pixel art on another show, Ed, because I think we could have a good debate there. Oh, yeah. Don't. You know, we got.
01:08:24.962 - 01:08:38.300, Speaker A: We got to have another pixel art spec. You know, it's funny is when I start running low on Tez, I'm like, fuck, I need to make some more art so I can start collecting again. Yeah. And isn't that great?
01:08:38.452 - 01:08:38.764, Speaker B: Right?
01:08:38.804 - 01:09:03.280, Speaker A: Like, I mean, because I think people are making more work as a result. I mean, and especially you make a couple hundred, few hundred, a $1000 sale. This is real money. So just fascinating. And Ed, feel free to stay on stage here. The wolf of ball meet has been waiting for maybe half an hour here, so I'd love to welcome up, welcome them up on stage. Wolf of ballmeat.
01:09:03.280 - 01:09:05.924, Speaker A: Where are you calling from and how are you doing?
01:09:07.104 - 01:09:12.336, Speaker B: Hey, how's it going, guys? Yeah, I'm calling from London. I'm doing very well. How are you doing?
01:09:12.400 - 01:09:17.204, Speaker A: Wonderful. Really enjoying this conversation. The coffee is hitting me just right.
01:09:18.724 - 01:09:23.064, Speaker B: Yeah, I've been enjoying the conversation so far. It's very, very interesting.
01:09:24.324 - 01:09:34.624, Speaker A: Good, so tell. So are now, I'm not sure if I've seen if you're your art or like, are you an artist and have you been making work on the blockchain? And were you an artist before?
01:09:36.204 - 01:10:40.542, Speaker B: So for me, it's a bit interesting because, like, I originally studied art and design in college and I studied animation, so I have an art and design background. But then I moved into doing video production for about ten years, and I first discovered crypto in 2017. And this is like, before I knew about NFT. So I was mainly involved with Defi and cryptocurrencies. And then when I first heard about nfts, that really got me in touch with so many different artists. And I started out as a collector back in March 2021, and I loved art and I wanted to buy and support artists. And I thought it was interesting how it's linked to crypto, but it's different in a way, but it's like it's linked.
01:10:40.542 - 01:11:43.574, Speaker B: And I thought that was very interesting. And after connecting with so many amazing artists and collecting their works, I started creating my own artworks and got in touch with my creative roots from back in college and started creating art again after ten years. So it was incredibly powerful when I made my first NFT and it instantly sold out. And from there it was just amazing because this was like a completely new world to me that I'd never experienced before, and it just opened up the possibilities of what is possible. And that's what started my artistic career coming into nfts and really seeing the possibilities. And since then, I've grown a lot, I've learned a lot, and I'm always pushing myself to become better. So it's been truly exciting journey for me so far.
01:11:44.074 - 01:12:51.894, Speaker A: Well, I love your story and it's so similar to Ed's, and it kind of brings up this issue. I've been thinking about, which I think kind of resonates with what you're saying, which is this idea that, you know, because we have this community of sorts here, it's almost like, I feel like there's a lot more pressure, like, in this, in a good way, that it's not about trying to find an audience anymore. Like, I think that's true for a lot of people that come to this space because it's so open and it's still hard when you're starting out to build, but now it's more of a, what can you make pokebelly? What can you do? And that's such a different place to be than where I feel, you know, it's like, oh, if only I had the, you know, I think a lot of us, we're able to get some attention out there, and maybe it's because I put out videos four times a week, maybe it's slightly easier for me. But I think a lot of us, we show up on spaces. It's pretty easy to get your name out there and to have your work seen, right? You post on Twitter. So it's much more about, like, what can you make rather than who can you talk to that's going to show your work? And then all this sort of thing. Does that resonate at all with you?
01:12:52.494 - 01:13:44.144, Speaker B: Yeah, I feel that, you know, the community is there, you know, we're all part of one community, and it's, you know, that's already, I mean, it's always changing. Obviously, the community was very different back in 2021, and now that's changed a lot since then. But it's always growing, it's always changing, it's always evolving. And that's the beauty about it. But the great thing is that the people that are here right now, the ones that are building and working hard, we're all here for a common purpose. We're all here for the love of art, the love of crypto technology, and it's really brought us together, which is very special. So I think it's very important to appreciate that and continue contributing, continue creating and adding value to each other's lives.
01:13:45.184 - 01:14:05.964, Speaker A: Well, I couldn't have put it more beautifully. I mean, I feel like I'm at a wedding again here on this Twitter spaces with the speeches. I mean, this is beautiful. Exactly. So, yeah, no, I'm thrilled. And thank you, wolf of balmy. We kind of running against the clock here, so I want to get to some other people, but thank you for contributing here and Chaz.
01:14:05.964 - 01:14:12.374, Speaker A: Chaz Gould NFT. Your hand is up. Where are you calling from?
01:14:12.994 - 01:14:15.202, Speaker B: Portland, Oregon. Cool.
01:14:15.298 - 01:14:19.574, Speaker A: Cool. So nice. How did nfts change?
01:14:20.194 - 01:15:01.086, Speaker B: I want to touch on, like, what somebody said about, like, the evolution of art. Like, that's one of the things that I've gotten from this whole NFT community in becoming an artist or being an artist and, like, watching my art evolve. Like, watching, like, not being scared. Try new things, throw new things out there. Like, my friends over on the children's face that I go to every week is like, they call it fucking fuck around and find out. You know what I mean? That's like, they're like, it's like throwing, throwing spaghetti against the wall and seeing what, what sticks and what works. And then sometimes I'll create a whole little collection of art and I'll throw it up on the blockchain and, like, none of it will move.
01:15:01.086 - 01:15:42.452, Speaker B: And I'm like, okay, that's cool. And I just kind of, like, let it sit there and I just, you know, and I moved it. I moved to the next, like, phase of evolution of art. And I just, I love going back and, like, looking at all of my old art and, like, and then scrolling back to, like, up to the top to where. Where I, where I'm at now and seeing how going up and down the timeline of, like, where I was at where I started two years ago and where I'm at now with what my art looks like and the quality and, like, just the depth and, and complexity and, like, and just, it's the neatest thing in the world to me. And I love doing that for other people too. But it really, I really like doing it with my art a lot.
01:15:42.452 - 01:15:51.504, Speaker B: Like, and keeping, keeping an eye on my own, like, my own evolution, seeing where I'm going with things, you know, and how things are changing. I think it's really cool.
01:15:51.804 - 01:16:29.302, Speaker A: Well, I totally agree with you. And one of the weird benefits, I'd say, particularly on a, on a website or platform like objects, is it's almost like, better than a website. Like, as far as, like, if I want to check out your work, I can watch your evolution and I can, like, it's all right there. I can see all the market data. It's all right there. So as a collector or consumer or whatever you want to say, curator, it's all right there. And what I also love about what you're saying, like, you know, if something's not selling, you can kind of try something else.
01:16:29.302 - 01:16:31.874, Speaker A: And the space is incredibly forgiving.
01:16:32.174 - 01:16:32.558, Speaker B: Right?
01:16:32.606 - 01:16:42.674, Speaker A: I mean, you can have stuff that nobody likes, nobody likes to try something different. And it can sell out Instagram. Like, it's very, it's very piece specific. I find this.
01:16:42.974 - 01:17:03.242, Speaker B: And what's funny is, like, you can go back and like, like, like, what didn't work six or eight months ago? Like, all of a sudden can, like, somebody comes along and sweeps the floor and, like, all of a sudden, the art that you make, they didn't work six or eight months ago, all of a sudden is working, like, out of nowhere, like, randomly. You're like, what?
01:17:03.298 - 01:17:04.090, Speaker A: What just happened?
01:17:04.122 - 01:17:41.134, Speaker B: Like, hell, the pieces from that collection just sold, but, like, didn't move at all for, like, you know, months on end. Like, nobody had any interest in it, how hard you pushed it. It's just cool how that happens. Like, this thing with them, the eco profiles, the cool thing about those is, like, whatever's on that wallet that you create, that ethotop pro co website with, you can go, you can look back at, like, your creations tab and like, and, like, start at the bottom and come all the way to the top, you know, and see where you're at and where you came from. And same thing with object, you know, it's like, it's really cool.
01:17:42.034 - 01:18:02.434, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. I totally agree. Well, thank you for the comments. And we're just sort of wrapping up here. Samosa, welcome to the stage. You've been waiting patiently as we're wrapping up here. How is NFT technology changed your art?
01:18:03.974 - 01:18:15.150, Speaker F: Hi, Tokubali. Hi, everyone. My name is Sundrin. I also go by the name Samosarani. I'm from India. Interesting space. I've been listening to everybody.
01:18:15.150 - 01:19:07.268, Speaker F: I was also listening to Wolf and everyone here. As an artist, it's changed my life. I've been an artist for 24 years. And back in 2021, when someone told me there's this thing called NFT, I was like, hell no. Am I putting my work out there? And for random people to look at it, but in the same breath, I will say again, as an artist, I was in India and some, someone half across the world bought my work without knowing I existed. So I guess for me at that point, you know, sometimes all of us, as an artist, you need that little, there's this voice in you which needs validation and you're like, what? Somebody just bought my work without even knowing I exist. And that was very fascinating.
01:19:07.268 - 01:19:42.990, Speaker F: Very fascinating, this place. And. Yeah, but also as a human being, I think it has taught me a lot of things. It's taught me patience. It's given me the best friends I've ever looked for in my life, some of them are here. And I think it's also helped me build a brand for myself because I think as artists we forget that branding and the whole fact that you have to come across as who you are apart from your art. You are also a brand name.
01:19:42.990 - 01:20:16.506, Speaker F: You are a person. People know the person and then they buy their work. I think that is also something that has taught all of us. Weve learned it in the NFT space rather, and even in the bear market. I think im very bullish about this, that we are in May and this year my work has traveled from Dubai to Toronto. So, and I'm very proud of it. It wouldn't have happened if not for the NFT space and if not for friends whom I've made in the space.
01:20:16.506 - 01:20:35.624, Speaker F: So I guess there are pros and cons to it. I know a lot of people who go through a lot of stress. I am a therapist also. I'm professionally a therapist. So I know people who are going through a lot of ups and downs. But overall it's, it's been a happy place, I must say.
01:20:36.244 - 01:21:36.710, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Like there can be ups and downs but it's only because there are actual ups. Like again, I think of my friends out here in Berlin and it's not like they never have success. They get the odd thing, but it's pretty humble, you know, for the most part. Oh, every year and a half someone gets a grant to, you know, do a show in maybe Korea or something like this, you know, which is nice, but I mean, there can be a long wait. And to your point, like one of the really great things I think about this space is just from a pure brand perspective here is you can have a news flow. Like I can constantly be sort of saying, oh, you know, in the last week or two, I sold a bunch, I sold out an edition, you know, like, what's new with you in the arts? Oh, I just put out some work and it just, and it was gone, you know, like, and even if it's for humble prices, that's news, right? That's a news flow and that kind of can really help you as an artist in terms of that kind of brand building.
01:21:36.710 - 01:21:41.154, Speaker A: You always got something to say that's new and something good that's happening, right?
01:21:42.894 - 01:22:28.456, Speaker F: Absolutely. And I think to a great extent, I think it has helped artists come out of that. Sitting in that space, we're sitting in our rooms and creating art all day, all night. Here you are with people who are like you, who think just like you, who have incomplete art just like you. And then you have people who are interested in knowing how you think about coming up with such kind of work and all of that. So I think, again, you know, I don't really like the word validation, but somewhere down the line it is, you know, you're doing that little sale every day. Whether you're selling editions, I don't think, think artists ever sold editions before the NFT space.
01:22:28.456 - 01:22:50.498, Speaker F: In real life, you would probably sell copies of your artwork for very bare minimum price. But when you see, you know, sell it here in the NFT space, you have collectors. And somewhere down the line, I think it helps boost your, not ego, but your little voice in you, which is like, okay, you know what? Let's get this going.
01:22:50.616 - 01:23:45.744, Speaker A: So, yeah, that is what I see it as. Like a, you know, you say validation with reserve with reserve or confirmation in a sense that, okay, what I've been struggling to create here, you know, there is someone out there, someone out there that believes in what I'm doing enough to put, you know, $10 or whatever the case may be, sometimes a lot more into what you're doing. You know, a lot of people here, I bet if we went around the room and talked about all time highs, it'd probably be pretty impressive, you know, like, and so that's really wonderful. And, and before we go to Macau, as we wrap up here, Samosa, so you were making art before, is that correct? Or it sounds like you were making for quite a while, actually. And so how did NFT technology, like, did it change the direction of your work at all?
01:23:47.324 - 01:24:22.294, Speaker F: Yes, it did to a great extent, because. So I've been doing art ever since. But now I know there's a particular, there are two particular styles which I follow just for the NFT space and which is what I tell everyone. I said, think of NFTs as one of your clients. And what does this client like? My client likes a particular style of art which I put across in the NFT space, but that does not mean that I don't create other styles, but this style works here. So I do create art in real life. I work with women at grassroot level.
01:24:22.294 - 01:25:14.734, Speaker F: I work with women in the prison, and I work with sex workers, helping them and educating them. So most of my work is inspired by women and real life stories. I would like to always portray women as empowered women, especially coming from India, because I think they need that little push. And if we can, why not? So that is what my work talks about and a little bit of, yes, personal, my abstract work I've always not followed rules very gracefully. So abstract art is something that is very personal to me. So these are the two styles I chose to continue in the NFT space. I do so many other things, but these are two styles which have worked for me in the NFT space.
01:25:15.394 - 01:25:41.784, Speaker A: Well, that is a wonderful story and noble work there that you do, Samosa. So thank you for joining us on, on the stage here and sharing your story. Mikael Knowleson, one of the two people with Chimasuku Jackson that encouraged this whole enterprise that I do on YouTube when it was just a idea on Spotify, who actually tweeted out keep going or whatever you said. Mikael, welcome to the show. Where are you calling from?
01:25:42.404 - 01:25:45.692, Speaker C: Hey, man, can you hear me right there?
01:25:45.868 - 01:25:47.224, Speaker A: Yeah, loud and clear.
01:25:48.124 - 01:25:52.860, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm calling from the same city as you. I'm in Berlin at the moment.
01:25:53.012 - 01:25:55.332, Speaker A: Really? Are you visiting or do you live here?
01:25:55.388 - 01:25:58.174, Speaker C: No, I lived here for the last eleven years.
01:25:58.284 - 01:26:01.094, Speaker A: You're probably down the street. What neighborhood are you in?
01:26:01.394 - 01:26:05.214, Speaker C: I'm in the shit one. I'll leave you to guess which one that is.
01:26:05.754 - 01:26:07.574, Speaker A: Maybe we're in the same one then.
01:26:08.274 - 01:26:09.094, Speaker C: Maybe.
01:26:10.274 - 01:26:11.202, Speaker A: Go ahead.
01:26:11.378 - 01:26:41.760, Speaker C: I was just going to say I was listening to the whole show on the S band on the way home from work, so I just literally got in now. And you said you're wrapping up. I thought I'd get on the mic and say hello. Yeah, I'm just going to say hello to Kane there, man. I think I was listening to Kane rapping on the clubhouse back in. I think it was maybe like early summer, 2021. I think Calamit used to do like a clubhouse there.
01:26:41.760 - 01:26:51.984, Speaker C: And Ken, you saw us. Come on. Is absolutely so full of energy, like amazing raps. It was a really fun time. Yeah, I was just gonna say, like.
01:26:52.964 - 01:26:54.540, Speaker A: Go ahead, go ahead.
01:26:54.732 - 01:27:33.704, Speaker C: I was just gonna say in terms of like how NFT as a concept, it can change your art. You know, like for me, it's really, really changed the way I look at how I make work and how I feel about my work as well. Just the idea. I think you said something about a landscape before and I was explaining to someone before about how I actually look at the way that, like crypto and nfts work. And I said it's kind of before when I was making, I've been making digital work on and off for like quite a while now. I'm 44. Other art school, like just the turn of the century, you know.
01:27:33.704 - 01:28:54.212, Speaker C: And there was always this feeling like of I never really knew how to get to, how do you say, to make something digital exist in the ideas of scarcity, but not in terms of financial sense, but in terms of, like, what? Then it's finished, you know, and I used to do things like, I would make digital works and they'll print them out, then I'll get rid of the digital copies. So they would just be, like, transferred into, like this, this thing. But it never really felt like, it didn't really feel like, you know, I'd use the word like, digitally native. It didn't feel like that was like the right conclusion or solution, you know? And with something like NFTs, just the idea of when you look at something like a landscape, I always look at it as kind of gps of the digital world. It's like coordinates of where my digital art is. And since I can kind of, like, conceptually, like, take that on board of the way I think about my work, then I don't have this feeling like, like to procrastinate or to think, well, how am I making this? Where is it going? Is it going to be a show? Is it going to be something? It just exists. And I love that idea, you know? So now when I'm working, I'm always thinking, well, I'm working towards just wherever my curiosity is going.
01:28:54.212 - 01:28:58.332, Speaker C: And when it feels like something, like, is made that's actually worthwhile showing the.
01:28:58.348 - 01:29:01.012, Speaker B: World, then I can, I can kind.
01:29:01.028 - 01:29:11.424, Speaker C: Of put in the set the coordinates for it minted. And for me, it exists then on the digital landscape. And for me, that's completely liberating.
01:29:12.324 - 01:29:50.552, Speaker A: I totally, I agree with everybody here. I totally agree with you. I mean, and, like, it's so much easier and, you know, to just, like, make a work and then, like, it's a completely different model, you know, like, I had a couple of, I had a few shows here, actually probably about five in these, like, you know, fathom organa, if you know that gallery that I think it recently closed down. And I think a new gallery actually opened up there that's in, on torstrasse there in Mitte. And it was just kind of like a community thing. And the guy asked me if I wanted to put on a show, and then I got to meet other people there. But it's just like, to your point, it's just a completely different situation.
01:29:50.552 - 01:30:38.162, Speaker A: When I make a work, I put it up and, you know, it either sells or it doesn't, and I forget about, I can move on rather than. Okay, you have a show in four months and you're going to get here's the layout of the place. And then you go into this massive production process. Actually, oftentimes if your work isn't already made or if it's kind of like you have an idea for a show, and often there's a huge production process. So just to your point, it's, to use a cliche, it's a game changer to your point on just being able to put stuff up on the blockchain so simply, so easily when it feels right and then just go to the next thing you know. It's like, so the whole presentation side of things, you know, is it's so much. There's so much more finesse.
01:30:38.162 - 01:30:43.854, Speaker A: It's almost what I want to say there. Do you have anything to add to that, Mikael?
01:30:45.554 - 01:31:12.096, Speaker C: Yeah, I was just going to say, like, yeah, and just the fact you can actually put it on the blockchain actually helps you to release yourself from your work as well, because there's something, you know, like, there's like an inertia with how you can. Your artistic practice of where you are within, like, thinking about how you're dealing with the artworks at the time and the idea, literally, when you actually put it on the blockchain, there's a certain weird release that you can. You're separating yourself from the work and.
01:31:12.120 - 01:31:15.000, Speaker B: You can move forward with whatever is.
01:31:15.032 - 01:31:42.824, Speaker C: Going on after that, you know? But I was just going to say on the other side, it's also, like, in terms of community, it's been amazing. Like, I always said that, Becca, art school, we said this idea of how, yeah, wouldn't it be great to live in the art community and all your friends are artists and you're talking about art all day and painting and this kind of bullshit utopia idea ahead. And the closest I ever got to that was, like, I guess around, like, 2021 with the hiking on community.
01:31:43.884 - 01:31:44.332, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:31:44.388 - 01:32:12.632, Speaker C: With hackathon and all these types of things, it was just amazing. This community, it was just so vibrant with people, like, in between, like, devs and coders and artists and collectors. It was just such a vibrant atmosphere. And that's continued on. Like, now I'm a mentor with the vertical crypto art. And so that, like, rotates like a cohort every three months. And at the moment, like, yeah, as a mentor, you get, like, these one on one calls with, like, a.
01:32:12.632 - 01:32:43.960, Speaker C: The cohorts can, like, message you and you can organize them. You can chat for, like, a couple hours about whatever they actually are, what kind of questions they want. Or it could just be about, like, talking about art in general. And it keeps you in this. This thought pattern of, like, creativity. And to be able to bounce ideas off of people. And sometimes just by talking about someone else's work and, you know, guiding them through, like, something which they don't understand themselves, they can come to a conclusion from it, but also I can.
01:32:43.960 - 01:33:03.984, Speaker C: And, of course, that happens in the regular, everyday world. But these are people that you're talking to from, like, you know, Venezuela, Argentina, the Philippines, America, you know, or even just down the road in Berlin. And I think it really has, like, brought, like, a massive disparate communities actually into the same place.
01:33:04.024 - 01:33:05.044, Speaker B: And I love it.
01:33:06.184 - 01:33:28.872, Speaker A: It's so beautifully put. And. Yeah, yeah, it's almost like. It goes. It's a very collaborative environment, and, you know, it is different from the, you know, what I'd loosely call the contemporary art world, you know, which is all. There's a little bit more suspicion. And as an earlier speaker was saying, it's almost like, out here, it's suspiciously nice, you know? And I love that.
01:33:28.872 - 01:33:57.438, Speaker A: Cause it is. And so it's. And it's really exciting because I think as a creative person and as an artist, you kind of crave that. You know, you want to be around other creative people. It's kind of like the turn of the century when Hemingway and, you know, Picasso and all these people hanging out in Paris. I mean, this is the equivalent, if you ask me, the modern equivalent. And because it's pretty hard to find actually in real life, you know, it's not an easy thing.
01:33:57.438 - 01:34:08.214, Speaker A: So, anyway, Mikael, we should go for a beer sometimes. Either forgot or didn't realize that you're in Berlin here, so. Yeah, let's go for a beer sometime.
01:34:08.554 - 01:34:09.974, Speaker B: 100%, man.
01:34:10.394 - 01:34:16.174, Speaker A: Awesome. Awesome. Chaz, you have your hand up. Then we're going to turn to Rowan, and then we will wrap up.
01:34:17.274 - 01:34:20.014, Speaker B: I thought I heard you say Portland, but never mind.
01:34:21.834 - 01:34:22.610, Speaker A: Sorry.
01:34:22.762 - 01:34:24.814, Speaker B: I thought you said Portland a minute ago.
01:34:25.234 - 01:34:28.066, Speaker A: Oh, no, I thought he. Okay, sorry.
01:34:28.130 - 01:34:33.962, Speaker B: I was just like. I was like, did he say Portland? An art show? Like. Like, getting the.
01:34:33.978 - 01:34:34.730, Speaker A: You delay of it?
01:34:34.762 - 01:34:59.524, Speaker B: Because, like, I actually have, like, a big art show coming up on Friday, irl one and one coming up on. In on May, like, 1213. And it's like, I'm excited about doing, like, actually setting some stuff up with, like, prints and screens where I get the lay of the land and, like. Like, on board people onto the blockchain show, people that I know for them previous shows, what I've been doing.
01:35:00.024 - 01:35:29.254, Speaker A: Well, feel free to pin the link up and that actually goes for everybody on stage here. In our closing minutes, feel free to pin your object profile. I should have mentioned this earlier. And Rohan Rowan, welcome to the program. Our last speaker here. Before we go to some final thoughts here from Roentoon. Where are you calling from and how have NFTs changed your art?
01:35:30.274 - 01:36:18.568, Speaker H: Hi, thank you so much for having me up here. It's been a beautiful space. Let me just start there. I think a lot of points were really covered by a lot of the amazing speakers that were there here. For me, specifically, when I started to create art, I really wanted to share the heart whelming stories that I've had through my life in my head and to sort of create a legacy and leave positivity behind in the world. So my work is rather niche. And in the general art world, where niche art was only approachable through galleries, so my portfolio was only been showcased to galleries.
01:36:18.568 - 01:37:18.536, Speaker H: And we all know how hard it is for a small artist like me to get into the gallery scene back then. So it was a really hard struggle. But for me, Nft sort of opened up that whole spectrum of different ways and like, literally hundreds of different ways. You also mentioned how we could always go back and sort of create these changes within our style, within our processes, whatever it is that we had to do to sort of evolve ourselves. And it also gave us different platforms in which we could propagate these surreal stories and experiences that we have in our head and passed on through our art. So that that whole aspect of niche art having a way to sort of spread through the world really opened up. For me personally, I sort of have a decade of experience creating art.
01:37:18.536 - 01:37:47.836, Speaker H: But at the same time, I'm also have over 15 years of experience in the gaming industry. And it's often that it's usually art that leads the revolution in terms of something, or it's the technology that's leading the revolution. But here, for the very first time, uh, probably for the first time, we have both art and technology where both of it is sort of holding hand and leading a revolution.
01:37:47.940 - 01:37:48.372, Speaker B: It.
01:37:48.468 - 01:38:10.694, Speaker H: It's really a very unique day and age that we are really living in. Uh, I think once, to quote Picasso rather, uh, he once said, everything you can imagine is real. And we are literally experiencing that whole stage right now where artists and engineers are sort of working together to make.
01:38:13.474 - 01:38:17.898, Speaker B: Possible even greater just to end there.
01:38:18.066 - 01:38:49.614, Speaker A: Well, again, I feel like I'm at a wedding with amazing speeches that are being delivered here. And I think you bring up a profound point on. First of all, this is definitely a, I agree with you. Like this is a unique situation that almost like, you know, push it even further. It's, this is kind of a unique situation. And the tech seems to be, as you say, going hand in hand with the art. Almost like, I think it's comparable, frankly, to oil painting hitting Italy because it's sort of like a similar question.
01:38:49.614 - 01:39:36.284, Speaker A: You could say, you know, how did oil painting change your art, you know, to those artists back then if they were using, you know, tempera or whatever they were using, and then all of a sudden they had oil paints, all of a sudden they're making works that they never thought they could have made. And there's probably different. The market dynamics, I think help a lot here just to create an incentive for people to make art interestingly and to make great art because they know the greater they make it, generally the market appreciates it. So anyways, thank you, Samosa, for posting the link. Thank you, Rohan, for the beautiful comments. And does anybody have any final comments here before I turn to Roentoon? Just feel free to speak out.
01:39:36.864 - 01:39:37.536, Speaker B: Anybody?
01:39:37.600 - 01:40:17.590, Speaker A: Ed Santiago, Martin, Joe, so I will turn to Roon tune here then, and Roon Toon. Any final thoughts on this very interesting space here? No, I think this is a awesome conversation. I'm really turned on now to this whole musicians in the space thing. I mean, I've always been aware of it, but it seems like there's so many more than I realized. Yeah, I feel the same way. I mean, here we have this show, it felt like the first three or four speakers. And we had Doctor Virgin, we had Kane, we had Ed Marolla, we had, there is another one at the start who's escaping me right now.
01:40:17.590 - 01:40:42.480, Speaker A: I mean, it was amazing how many people actually edge Q. You know, all coming out of music or audio, right. So wonderful. Well, thank you everybody for the great conversation. I really appreciate all the listeners out there. And again, we're here every week, so feel free to come in and come up on stage and thank you to all the speakers that were here. That was fascinating and beautiful.
01:40:42.480 - 01:40:46.974, Speaker A: So with that, thank you for joining us, everyone. Until next time, take care.
