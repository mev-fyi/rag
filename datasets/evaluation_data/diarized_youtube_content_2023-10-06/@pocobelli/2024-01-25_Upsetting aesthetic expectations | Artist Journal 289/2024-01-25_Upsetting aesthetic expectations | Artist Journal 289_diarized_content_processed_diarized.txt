00:00:05.840 - 00:00:26.526, Speaker A: The sprint continues. The journey continues. Welcome back, everyone. Journey onwards. As I said in Altima four, as we continue sailing forward here on a sunny, mild day, at least in inner space, on our spectral ship of the imagination. Welcome back. Artist Journal, January 25, 2024.
00:00:26.526 - 00:00:53.074, Speaker A: Broadcasting from the pirate ship of the mind, chillin at the editor's desk here. My name is Adrian Pokebelly, and welcome back. Another massive show here. I am gonna sprint through it, and as you can see, it is haircut day tomorrow. So you'll get one more day of the poof here and we'll see what happens. You know, as I say to myself about this show, let's see what happens today. Let's see what happens with the hair today and tomorrow.
00:00:53.074 - 00:01:23.690, Speaker A: So I'll just say, welcome back and let's go. Let's just sprint through this. And yes, of course, I think most of you who watch this show are gonna know the artist here. This is NUV 1914, I believe, out of Latin America. And yeah, and one of one was saying she is a she. So just a really cool artist. I've been highlighting a ton of NUV 1900 fourteen's work since discovering her work.
00:01:23.690 - 00:01:55.094, Speaker A: I believe it was curio fringes feed that tipped me off. Also to Martin Bruce, who we started with yesterday with that brilliant bear with the stretched neck. So simple, so powerful. Something that comes out of a process while you're working. It's almost like I kind of doubt Martin Bruce, speaking of yesterday's work. I kind of doubt he planned it that way and said, I know what I'll do. I'll make a stretched neck.
00:01:55.094 - 00:02:27.818, Speaker A: I suspect he was working and working and just kind of kept going and just let himself keep going. And before he knew it, he was just like, this is it. This is what I'm going to go with. So all to say, great experimentation here. Again, what I like to kind of loosely call indie digital art. You know, digital art that's a little trickier, a little more challenging, I'd argue Martin Bruce is in that kind of very loose category here. And why do I say that here? I mean, this is a cat, as far as I understand.
00:02:27.818 - 00:02:54.252, Speaker A: Let's look at the title. Gatto un canasto con flores. So con is with, at least in Italian. Let's do a translate selection to English. Cat in basket with flowers. So very interesting piece here by Nuff 1914, selling it for a song of nine dazos, $8.43. It is a buyer's market, as you see.
00:02:54.252 - 00:04:00.572, Speaker A: Illusion. Picking this up, looking like sending it to a vault of some kind very cool work here. A real standout. And again, one of the things I adore about the art that NUV 1914 makes are, you know, it's kind of back to the celebration and embracing of the irrational here. And I see it here. Like, these are not the kind of design techniques, say, like these gradients on the side here or much less, frankly, these gradients here of these spheres that seemingly spheres that are almost look like they're at 80% opacity, kind of matte, right? Like, I'm assuming it's something like that. So all sorts of interesting decisions here, which you're not going to find on a corporate ad, right? Like you're not going to see a Coca Cola ad with this blue, you know, or, you know, even a the dark black or the light, I guess the gray gradient here.
00:04:00.572 - 00:04:58.884, Speaker A: You're not going to see a Coke ad do that, right? And that is kind of where I'm going with this, with this kind of indie digital art. You know, even the head made of these gradients, which if you're new to this artist, you might find kind of a aesthetic challenge, right? Like it's kind of, it takes a bit of time at first you're going, this kind of might even, you know, dare I say it, offend your sensibilities the first time you see an artist like this. But after consuming for a while sometimes, like, if I'm on vacation and I come back after a week, it's nuv 1900 fourteen's work that's almost like water. It's like water in the desert. And you're just like, you love it. So, you know, it's back to the acquired taste, you know? And that's one of the things I just really like about Nav 1900 fourteen's work, and which I would also kind of characterize as, you know, symptomatic of this indie digital art. It's not easy, it's challenging.
00:04:58.884 - 00:05:47.914, Speaker A: I would argue. Like, I think you could show this work to someone on the street, like just walking on the sidewalk and they might go, well, what's the big deal here? But for us who are kind of neck deep in this whole scene, there's a lot to feed on here. There's a lot to like, you know? And so Nuv 1914, back to the animals, I'm pleased to say. And there are the paws there, and you see the basket, the woven basket, the weave. The basket weave or the little, you know, hilariously with the bow on top, and then again, like this semi outrageous grid here. And it's just floating there. And what are these bubbles, you know? So just really, I dare say, inspiring work here.
00:05:47.914 - 00:06:13.640, Speaker A: Selling for basically almost for free here, $8.43 for this edition of one. Very cool. And there are others that I want to highlight here. Flamenco Rosa. Interestingly, you know, keeping with the indie digital art sort of theme, minting antea here or hic et nunc contract, just a small detail there. Here's another one.
00:06:13.640 - 00:06:36.714, Speaker A: Flamenco, I guess, rose Flamingo. Again, same idea. And this is returning to a subject matter that NUV 1914. If you go back in Nev 19 fourteen's feed, you'll see. And again, challenging. This is the cloud one, one would assume, you know, not a, like, I would argue, not an easy artist. Look at this.
00:06:36.714 - 00:07:07.110, Speaker A: But for. But for the acquired taste, it's just, it's delicious, so to speak. To further the analogy, look at what's going on at the bottom. And again, this kind of blurred out. Not worrying, you know, about, not worrying about the conventional tropes, the like, this is unconventional work. Again, back to this kind of almost indie versus corporate art. Not to say that, like, I use a lot of like, nice colors together.
00:07:07.110 - 00:08:24.756, Speaker A: So that's not to say if you're not putting like jpegged out edges that you're making corporate art, far from it. But all to say, it does give it this kind of edgy character by, again, upsetting what our conventional aesthetic norms is where I'm going with this. And that's what makes it so exciting. That is the water in the desert when, as we've commented on the arty hands, it came up during the arty hands space. We're all consuming probably a thousand images a day, right? A huge amount of images a day, whatever it is, and a huge amount of art I would probably unparalleled, you know, before the Internet and especially with social media, and especially if you're in the NFT scene on X or on Instagram, you know, a lot of people are consuming a lot of art on Instagram as well, we should recognize. But all to say, if you're consuming a thousand images a day, it's nice to have your expectations upset on what is beautiful and then to have that challenged and then further be persuaded. It's like that classic, you know, situation of some of your favorite albums, music albums you don't really necessarily even enjoy on the first time.
00:08:24.756 - 00:09:00.584, Speaker A: And sometimes those become your all time favorite. Beautiful composition here, I might add, with, and just beautiful contrast here. Working on a formal technical level here you have the super gradient light gradient and then contrasted with this sharp, you know, completely different tools creating a contrast. And when you zoom out, a beauty of sorts and actually a really nice pose of the bird here too, of the flamingo. So how much did this sell for? Nine tezos to Emilia Versace. Picking up another one. Nice, nice pickup there.
00:09:00.584 - 00:09:52.748, Speaker A: And finally another one here, caballol, which I think is horse, if I'm not mistaken. This going also to Emilia Versace, nine tazos, and playing with different colors here. Again, like, what is this gradient here with the horse here? Right. This, you know, what I like to loosely call outrageous decisions here and here, right. So quite exciting work. And then when you look at the portrayal of the horse itself, you know, quite, you know, tempting to call it masterfully done, the way that this is done over here, the way these, you know, gradiented squares, rectangles are, you know, cut and paste and everything here, even here in the head and then going down here. Get ready to upset your expectations some more.
00:09:52.748 - 00:10:30.014, Speaker A: I mean, you know who it vaguely reminds me of here, I mean, and who else challenges your expectations? And we're going to see this right away here. No hygiene. No hygiene. Right. With those kind of outrageous AI works which are quite, starting to sell quite a bit. So maybe just to kind of summarize this, maybe one of the many conclusions we could come to here, maybe it's bullish on this whole scene that not only is work like this challenging work being made, but it's also being sold. People are buying it.
00:10:30.014 - 00:11:24.886, Speaker A: And so, you know, again, I would just from a very big picture perspective, this upsets the stereotype of NFT collectors and of artists from outside, because the stereotype I get at least, you know, six months ago, you know, being, it's like, well, isn't all that NFT art terrible? Assuming that it's all just like a few, couple of, you know, and them thinking, oh, I don't like people, so therefore it all must be terrible, is what they're thinking to themselves. Or maybe it's the bored ape yacht club and they see this stuff on tv and they just go, I don't need to care. I would say this definitely upsets that whole narrative, that whole way of thinking about this scene. So more grounds for optimism here. And here is NUV 19 fourteen's page. We've been showing a ton of these. This sold.
00:11:24.886 - 00:12:07.846, Speaker A: I was tempted to pick that up. Yeah. And this you can get on secondary for 20. This one's still ten. And of course, the collaboration with Zvoso, like, what a cup you know, that's a whole lot of imagination in that collaboration, in that duo, so to speak. So, you know, hugely prolific artist putting out several works a day now putting out a lot of one of ones, which I find very exciting and I think really good for object, frankly, because it encourages you to stay on the platform because you don't know when NUV 1914, for example, or your favorite artist is going to mint a one of one. So very cool work there, as usual.
00:12:07.846 - 00:12:50.552, Speaker A: Now, a huge thank you to Tesnowns. This was like an Internet honor over here, Tez nouns, a special edition variation for the Teznowns collection, bridging the gap between PFP inspired by the Creative Commons, or cc zero, I should say, spirit of nouns on ETH and an iconic artist on Tazos that is a homage to Adrian Pokebelly. So I totally appreciate this. Tez nouns and tez vending machine, maybe flexosaurus in there for good measure. And there I am, and there is the bookshelf there. So again, I was kind of rendered mute there with speechlessness yesterday morning. So that was really, really cool.
00:12:50.552 - 00:13:13.844, Speaker A: So thank you for that. And a one of one sent over. I will treasure that, as I posted in the tweet. And here's another one. Since we're on the Tez nouns, this is one that was made by Uri J. Of course, a lot of artists make tez nouns. I thought this was a brilliant one here, because you're going, well, where's the Tez noun? Well, it's here in the glasses on the book.
00:13:13.844 - 00:13:52.244, Speaker A: Another example of the creativity at work here with this wonderful artist. Again here, this kind of fuzzed out a little bit, almost out, slightly out of focus patterning here and jpegization, embracing it. It's back to Warhol's embrace the mistakes. This is almost the visual equivalent here, or what we're seeing in NUV 1914. It's almost one way of looking at it. It's like paint drops randomly falling and not worrying about it and thinking, I don't need to clean this up. This is just.
00:13:52.244 - 00:14:11.432, Speaker A: That's okay. I'm gonna just cut this out. And if it's a little out of focus, if it's a little blurry, that's great, you know, because I like, you know, brush drops on the paint. That looks good. That is adding to the richness of this work. And it does. It adds to the, you could argue it makes it a more complicated, sophisticated work.
00:14:11.432 - 00:14:49.528, Speaker A: This isn't an accident, right? This is on purpose. The artist is very well aware. So is NUV 1914 about what's going on here? Okay, so, uh, just a really super original, uh, uh, tez noun from Yuri J. So super cool there. And a huge thank you to Annas Abdin and Dina Chang and everybody who came out to this, uh, Twitter space, this X space yesterday. It was fascinating. If you haven't listened to Anis Abdin, if you haven't listened to this, and you are a pixel art fan, you will probably really enjoy it.
00:14:49.528 - 00:15:42.356, Speaker A: It was one of the most energetic spaces there, and I don't even know why, but it was just, maybe I just had two coffees beforehand, I don't know. But the energy felt really great in that space. And it was the first time, I'm proud to say, that Annas Abdin actually spoke in a space. And let me tell you, Annas story is quite a whole story on plagiarism at the end involving Hollywood, which I dont think anybody really expected. And if you dont know who Annas Abdin is, a wonderful pixel artist here, as you will see. And releasing now one a day on here on X and also on Reddit. They're being released and I think minting some of them on foundation here.
00:15:42.356 - 00:16:14.504, Speaker A: And maybe if I can do a little more research here, wouldn't it be wonderful to have this on ordinals? And we're going to talk about that. You kind of got to. It's almost like, if you're thinking about it, at least the message I'm seeing, as we're going to see here, it's starting to pick up momentum, and there's something to be said for, I don't know if you're early anymore, but you're not late, but you could be late if you wait a couple of months. Let's put it this way. Anyway, this is today's post. Look at how beautiful it is. Focuses on nature.
00:16:14.504 - 00:16:49.658, Speaker A: So just a really awesome pixel artist. So thank you, everybody, for coming out to that. And thank you, Annis and Dina, who is wonderful, she's going to be on next week as well. And so just looking at the comments here, last episode, let me just pause that. So little cakes on the New Yorker magazine article. I ended up reading that again. Remember Alan's survey? My kind of, I don't want to, I don't know if I'd call him my guilty pleasure as far as Twitter accounts, but pretty close, like, yeah.
00:16:49.658 - 00:17:48.206, Speaker A: And we'll see more from Alan survey, maybe not this episode, but I'll come back to Ellen survey anyways. Ellen Survey posted a tweet about this New Yorker magazine article on Internet on IP, on intellectual property and AI, and where, again, where the very fascinatingly, it wasn't the AI that was being called into question. And how dare the AI use the people's intellectual property to make something new. It was more saying, maybe the intellectual property is what needs to change, not the AI, which I thought was just a very fun approach to the way of thinking about it. So anyway, littlecakes, read the article and also listening to spaces Convo this morning with Anis, lots of Ip thoughts swirling around, because of course, Ip came up in the Hollywood issue with Anus Abdin. Also here, Justin Kagan's dissent. The rest of the majority had no understanding of art.
00:17:48.206 - 00:18:43.788, Speaker A: To know why a Warhol silkscreen counts as transformative, to give musical definition to a song's feel, you need a kind of expertise that most judges, most people don't have, right? And I think this is referring here to like, there was a ruling against Warhol for the prince. Remember prince, the musician? There was a portrait, and the person that took the portrait, warhol, made an image out of it, and it was generally with fair use. It's considered if you transform the work, and that's a loose definition on purpose, then you basically are free from copyright. But let's just finish what littlecakes has to say. I feel it's important as an artist and consumer of images, to know as much as possible about cultural and art histories, so that I can be a better judge for myself of whether a work falls into appropriation or is insensitive. And that goes for something I create as well. And so that's why the Warhol one ruling.
00:18:43.788 - 00:19:29.124, Speaker A: And I think, I'm not sure if it was kagan. I think it was actually a different justice sotomayor, I think was who ruled against the Warhol estate, or whoever it was. So all to say finally here, which is maybe strange, considering I use AI to create work. But I think it becomes even more important when one does so that one is doing their best to create something original or personal, or so that one can explain their references in depth and not just on a surface level. Yeah, I suspect, you know, the whole AI IP debate, I suspect where this goes, at least in 300 years, is IP disappears. I suspect. But I mean, that's just a loose.
00:19:29.124 - 00:19:55.582, Speaker A: Because it's getting too convoluted with these, what do they call it in technology, these patents and everything. I suspect at a certain point, IP is going to go. I don't know if it's going to be in 50 years or like 300. But that's where I suspect this all ends up. A few other comments I just want to touch on here. Ceriza, thank you for mentioning my work here. Love this broadcast already.
00:19:55.582 - 00:20:15.318, Speaker A: Thank you. And that was a beautiful work that was there with the woman and the skeleton there. Beautiful illustration. Umska thank you. Nopro. I love that long bear at beginning, you know, so it's resonating out there. And I noticed also on Instagram, Martin Bruce's bear, like, did really well.
00:20:15.318 - 00:20:51.018, Speaker A: So very interesting, isn't it? W 74? These journals are such a guilty pleasure. Timestamps on YouTube, please. I like to bookmark stuff to revisit later. Humble request from a regular. Yeah, so if this show ever starts making money and if there are ever, like, for example, you know, I have weird issues. Like, I would upload these to Zora for people to mint, but my Internet in Berlin here is so slow, it literally takes an hour and sometimes it fails. So that's, you know, so I have weird stuff like that.
00:20:51.018 - 00:21:35.066, Speaker A: And so if there's ever, if this ever starts making money beyond me selling art, then I will, as I told W 74, this will be the first order of business is timestamps and also maybe uploading to other platforms. I know, like when I'm in Rome, it uploads in two minutes, or London, it's two minutes. In Berlin it's an hour. So all to say thank you. Thank you for the comment. And it's good to know because once I do have that opportunity or it comes up, then it's like, I know what to do. Love that radioactivity performance, referring to the craftwork piece and minimum, maximum.
00:21:35.066 - 00:22:03.520, Speaker A: And yes, bitmap thingies for a screen print. So remember that screen print that axin had done of the bitmaps and it looked like it was two colors, kind of offset. Very, very cool. And of course, the radioactivity. And as I said there, that album, if we had more time, I mean, we're already 20 minutes in here. Minimum, maximum craft work. This is a brilliant double album here.
00:22:03.520 - 00:22:20.584, Speaker A: I thought the COVID was red. I guess it's white. Maybe I'm thinking of the stage here. This is an awesome. Yeah. So all to say, this is a really cool album. And if you ever hear let's let that go, numbers on there is epic.
00:22:20.584 - 00:22:35.524, Speaker A: The version there, one of my favorite tracks of all time, as I told Uck in the comments. So thank you everybody for the comments. There also comments on YouTube quickly here. Mcrenders. Much love. Kyle Flemmer and I had a lot of fun with that one. Appreciate you featuring it.
00:22:35.524 - 00:22:47.808, Speaker A: Always the best way to start my mornings. Well, coffee. Cheers to you, McRenders. That's great to hear and cool work. Ana Luisa. Muy interescente. Gran artisa.
00:22:47.808 - 00:23:12.054, Speaker A: Excellente an analysis. So forgive my Spanish there, ana luisa, but thank you for the comment and also Morgan. And we're gonna actually, there's a quick correction here. Great. As always, thanks for sharing. And I referred to Morgan's work the other day as Rainbow and she sent me a message. So I'm gonna quickly show that work here and here, Tom battle.
00:23:12.054 - 00:23:37.944, Speaker A: I see a new video, I automatically click and like it. And that's why we love you over here, my friend. So thank you, everybody, for the comments. It's very encouraging and just very fun to hear back from people. So here, if you remember, if you watched last episode, this work, you know, maybe three quarters the way through, I showed I couldn't find the artist's name. Here it is. This is Morgan Hgby.
00:23:37.944 - 00:23:48.836, Speaker A: Morgan B. Flowers. Morgan G. Hgby flower. So kind of a tricky name here. But as you can see, that is the artist who did this. Not rainbow, pink middle orb.
00:23:48.836 - 00:24:10.518, Speaker A: And we're going to have a couple more, actually, from Morgan. And there's Curio fringe picking one up. Always such a great curio fringe. Could be a great consultant for art collectors. Just really smart buyer finds gems for very little. I mean, it's going for a tezos. All to say, a couple more from Morgan this episode.
00:24:10.518 - 00:24:20.390, Speaker A: So let me. This might be slightly. Here we go. Put this over here. I believe. Slightly out of order. All right, Xerox, back to ordinals.
00:24:20.390 - 00:25:06.122, Speaker A: I minted an ordinal on BTC and pretty hyped about it has nothing to do with recent sales over the last 24 or 48 hours. I'm not doing it for the money or even the claimed foreverness of the inscription. No, to be honest, I just want my future grandchildren and heirs to be proud of their granddad and one day be able to boast my granddad was one of the 145 million people to mint his skull art on bitcoins. So maybe a slightly satirical writing here, thus giving them entree into the cabal of the global elite. After which I can only hope that they'll look on irreverence to the stunned faces of their fellow classmates in their AI virtual classroom or whatever. So all to say, I'm not sure. So I'm not sure.
00:25:06.122 - 00:25:47.652, Speaker A: But maybe Xerox is going to mint and I'm not sure. Maybe this is just trolling a little bit, but I'm kind of. Again, I'm so excited about Ardon bitcoin that even just the possibility that Xerox would mint something is pretty exciting. And just the fact that Xerox is discussing it shows how kind of, you know, this is a major part of the conversation, as many of us know. Here's another example. Nullish announcing remnants of a distant supernova, my newest collection of 1111 pieces that symbolizes the cycle of life, death and rebirth in the universe. My decision to begin a permanent move to bitcoin.
00:25:47.652 - 00:26:23.710, Speaker A: So I hadn't heard of nullish before, but very interesting statement here. I could, you know, you could see this happening. Like, that's the, you know, tantalizing aspect of bitcoin. Like, if they actually figure out L2s and all that sort of stuff to make it where, you know, I've used lightning network the other day, and I have to say it was very impressive how fast, and it cost a penny. So that was interesting. So details below. Maybe we can see where it will mint.
00:26:23.710 - 00:26:47.654, Speaker A: Do we have this looks like here, that looks like Opensea, but here it's a medium. Interestingly, let's just really. And launch website. So nullish.org dot. So, of course, don't connect your main wallet to anything that you don't know about. So I don't know about this artist.
00:26:47.654 - 00:27:13.934, Speaker A: So again, do all your due diligence. But all to say, I thought a very interesting statement from an artist in the web3 community here. Here's another example. Ord IO breaking. Someone spent $6,100 over the past 24 hours to inscribe these eight high resolution jpegs on bitcoin. So, you know, let's. Maybe we can see how big this, these are.
00:27:13.934 - 00:27:59.504, Speaker A: Wouldn't that be interesting? Because so 246 kb, so costing only $800. So again, because again, this doesn't line up. If this was $10 a kilobyte, this would be $2,400. But they did all eight of them for $6,000. So I suspect there is a cheaper way to mint on bitcoin than I have been doing. And again, for me, I'm just, you know, throwing darts with a blindfold on as far as doing it. So that's kind of exciting for me, because if you divide this all by, you know, 24 here, and then you have 16 kb, like, you can do quite a bit with 16 kb, in my opinion.
00:27:59.504 - 00:28:27.564, Speaker A: So all to say. But. But as you can see here, I guess my sort of. What I'm trying to illustrate here with these three tabs is the momentum is growing in this ordinals thing, or at least it's not going away, let's put it that way. So very interesting, tuks and that. And the reason I'm just for people that deal with flashing here, so maybe I can. There we go.
00:28:27.564 - 00:28:59.844, Speaker A: So Tuks taking. So Ethereum is still making sales though, so coalborn from the Museum of Crypto Art. Big shout out to Colborne, who actually picked up a few of my works a couple of years ago. So much appreciated there. Thanks for kicking off the auction for shadows on pastel walls on super rare, and thank you for the anonymous bidder for immediately getting a second bid. So there is life out there. And don't forget about Ethereum here too, with all of this discussion of all these different chains.
00:28:59.844 - 00:29:45.564, Speaker A: Took's getting some bids here. And so interesting piece here too, as usual. Always experimenting there. So RJ, so another solo show, so to speak, curated by RJ on object. Another feature, so to speak, in this very interesting format that RJ, I would argue was the first to do as far as I've seen. You know, you could call it intuitive, but the actual way that you mint the artist statement here, the way that it's the whole process, I find quite creative and interesting. And it kind of feels like a first mover sort of thing in this format, using of course, objects, curator tools.
00:29:45.564 - 00:30:19.344, Speaker A: Second deep dive essay, this time on no hygiene and the imperative of acceptance. So kind of what we are discussing here at the beginning, challenging your aesthetic assumptions and what is supposed to be quote unquote beautiful. And of course no hygiene is also. So again, just the fact that people are discussing this, I find quite, it seems sophisticated to me. So this is up on object. The essay has currently only been read on tea as object was having some PDF troubles. So.
00:30:19.344 - 00:31:01.344, Speaker A: And I think I brought it up here, let me see. Here is the show. So here's the show and what I found really interesting about this, you know, working the curator's editing or the curators, you know, tools here, quite with a lot of muscle. And what I mean by that, only putting 2468 like a very selective curation here by RJ. And I thought that was quite interesting in the way that RJ really curated the show. Like, I thought it was actually a really interesting show. And here is the essay here.
00:31:01.344 - 00:31:35.564, Speaker A: So super interesting. No hygiene and the imperative of acceptance. So another one from RJ and no hygiene replied, I will read this wonderful text in detail, which highlights the relationship between AI and art, as well as this duality between the urge to disgust and the obligation to accept. I would also like to thank you for this wonderful act of kindness. It is a superb article at an academic level. So no hygiene showing. Like when you start seeing lines like that, you start to go again.
00:31:35.564 - 00:31:57.434, Speaker A: I guess this is on purpose, right? So which shows a fair amount of sophistication. Again, I would argue. So, interesting response from no hygiene. Here is the work it is showing up on object. So good news there. And another essay by RJ on an artist in the community. So very cool.
00:31:57.434 - 00:32:20.644, Speaker A: And finally here RJ. So so glad this seems to be going down well. A note though, if you give it a read and take complete issue with the argument or anything in it, please share. I'm pretty used to peer reviews so no feelings will be harmed. And the whole point of this series is to help open up critical chat. So RJ, used to the pure reviews here. It's all sounding very good from over here.
00:32:20.644 - 00:32:59.932, Speaker A: And who is next? Who is next? This is why I brought this up. Had a great time with this deep dive. Now who is next? As RJ asks if there are any artists who you think are making art that begs some critical attention, let me know below. So very cool. Ed Marolla Kandru Kryptoo and let's give them a follow. Posted by isolationist just a couple of news items here that I thought were interesting. So remember the Parthenon marbles, also known as the Elgin Marbles and that are in the british museum.
00:32:59.932 - 00:33:59.440, Speaker A: And of course Athens, Greece has been trying to get back these relief sculptures, deep relief sculptures from, I think it's the pediment, the triangle at the top of the Parthenon there in Athens. So just on that whole, you know, appropriation front. And actually I was having this discussion, I'm glad this came up with Ken Consumer, who actually I saw the other day. Thank you to Ken consumer for giving me this beautiful pen plotter work here. Just do it vertical so you can see it. And who was I met the other just on Tuesday night in Neuqual who was discussing how blockchain in Providence, how important it is for these museums where blockchain is very important in order for situations exactly like this because it can record the provenance. So anyway, big shout out to Ken consumer for giving me that as well as ah heck for setting that up.
00:33:59.440 - 00:34:33.560, Speaker A: And I'll definitely go back to that bar. Anyway, so this is within the whole discussion of, you know, having other countries works. And here's another example. So BBC ascente gold UK to loan back Ghana's looted crown jewels. So here, these are from Ghana. These beautiful objects here, probably real gold in there, ceremonial cap. And let's just take a quick look at here because I thought it was actually quite interesting what was said.
00:34:33.560 - 00:35:09.217, Speaker A: The UK is sending back gannets, crown jewels back home 100 year, 150 years after looting them from the court of the Asante king. A gold peace pipe is among 32 items returning and this is the key. Under long term loan deals, the BBC can reveal this is what they were trying to do with Greece as well. Say, look, we'll give it back to you as a loan, but there are laws in the UK against us giving it back. So sorry, we can't give it back, only a long term loan. The V and A. The Victoria and Albert Museum, a very famous museum in London, is lending 17 pieces.
00:35:09.217 - 00:35:56.422, Speaker A: It's kind of like a design museum to a certain degree is lending 17 pieces and 15 are from the British Museum. So Ghana's chief negotiator said he hoped for a, quote, new sense of cultural cooperation and, quote, after generations of anger. And this was the quote that I wanted to highlight here, but let's actually just read it very quickly here. Some national museums in the UK, including the V and A and the British Museum, are banned by law from permanently giving back contested items in their collections. And loan deals such as this are seen as a way to allow objects to return to their countries of origin. But some countries laying claim to disputed artifacts fear that loans may be used to imply they accept the UK's ownership. Indeed, from a legal perspective, that is not crazy.
00:35:56.422 - 00:36:55.890, Speaker A: And this is what I want to highlight. Tristram Hunt, director of the V and A this museum in London told the BBC that the gold items of court regalia are the equivalent of our crown jewels. So it's hard to imagine here that they would allow because of course the crown jewels are in the Tower London, like the british, so they're being loaned. But again, England is basically saying our hands are tied. There's nothing we can do, there's a law against it. So it's becoming more of an issue here and I suspect they're not going to get them back because who's going to be the politician that gives them back and let you know? So that's also an interesting question. Will they get them back? I'm not sure if it said how long the loan is for.
00:36:55.890 - 00:37:38.524, Speaker A: Shall we just very quickly look, I'm not sure if we're going to be able to find it. Is this just an ope with an option to extend three year loan? With an option to extend for a further three years? So an interesting situation here. A three year loan agreement with an option to extend for a further three years. I suspect they're not going back, but that is just a hunch on my side. And I love this headline here from Art News, because I've been discussing this, frankly, for years. Oh, no, another Picasso show. And Picasso is great and everything, but Picasso fatigue is a real thing.
00:37:38.524 - 00:38:21.936, Speaker A: They're finally, finally starting to address this, experts say, but few are ready to leave the artist behind. Yeah, just last summer, I was seeing another Picasso show here in Berlin on the subway. So I just thought that headline was funny. Picasso fatigue. It kind of speaks. Yeah, because again, I mean, it speaks again. It's another reason to be excited about this scene, because it's a whole bunch of new artists, right? Because what's the problem with going to a lot of museums these days is you've kind of seen a lot of it before, and it's not necessarily, you know, gonna grab you in the same way as it did maybe the first few times you went to those museums.
00:38:21.936 - 00:38:45.558, Speaker A: And now we're all familiar with these artists. He goes, even brilliant artists like Magritte or Dali. I mean, you've kind of seen it, right? So kind of speaking to the. You know, it's almost like the museums are. They need new content. Like, their content. They've kind of recycled it so many times, you know? And I think you're starting to see some hints here that.
00:38:45.558 - 00:39:02.978, Speaker A: And, you know, I've been hearing anecdotally that museum attendance has been down. So not too. I don't know too much about that, though. Let's continue here, Zora. So introducing a really interesting new feature here. Canvas. Draw, type and layer images to create anything on chain.
00:39:02.978 - 00:39:21.818, Speaker A: Find freedom on this canvas. So another great. Some more great copy there from Zora. And here. Wow. So making it on chain. So how cool is this? Zora co createcanvas and already Kappn free mint created on site using the canvas feature.
00:39:21.818 - 00:39:52.704, Speaker A: And what's hilarious is it totally looks like a kapn work already. And I don't know if you can see those mountains in there, but one of my favorite techniques, actually is putting white on kind of a lighter gray or on a gray. Very powerful here. Here you have this mountain, what looks like mountains, and then some code over top by just having fun, but all of these different styles making a really nice contrast with each other. Bit of text. Nice big chunky question mark here. Again, cap.
00:39:52.704 - 00:40:30.524, Speaker A: And making it look very easy here. Here's Pamela Cerone trying the new amazing tool on Arzora. Looks like on the tablet. How cool is that? Who knew? So, you know, that's looking like a pretty practical tool here, isn't it? So pretty cool to see that, too. And also stippin pixel also making a cat here. So, I mean, I think it's just a really, really cool iteration, you know, by Zora here, as usual. And they have another one here, too.
00:40:30.524 - 00:41:07.924, Speaker A: So cool work here from stippin Pixel. And I'm very excited about this. This is something I was looking for, which is follows, because now one of the trickiest parts of Zora is being able to follow or be notified when an artist that you like mints a work. So hopefully I'll have more works on Zora now or on this show as a result of them having follows. So that is great. Speaking of that, I've started following people on foundation, which is a great way to get a feed here. As you can see, the feed button here and that you can track basically any ETH works come out through here.
00:41:07.924 - 00:41:28.046, Speaker A: Of course, this is cider. Cider released, a few works. And look, I mean, again, more action on ETH here. 0.75. So the market, you know, may have slowed down, but for. It's just more selective, though. So, I mean, as you're gonna see here, cider's done very well.
00:41:28.046 - 00:41:46.226, Speaker A: I mean, 0.75 ETH. Really nice work here. What is the title again? Guidance. Seeming to have a Jesus figure here. And we'll see if we can zoom in a bit here. Not having any luck right now, but very great negative space here, too, with the black background there.
00:41:46.226 - 00:41:59.074, Speaker A: Here's. We got a few of them here. Traveling salesman. And this has been minted, but not. Not picked up yet. But just beautiful textures here, as usual, kind of abstract. Kind of looks like a house.
00:41:59.074 - 00:42:15.604, Speaker A: And you see a little bit of what looks like a photograph, but heavily treated here. Insider style. This one, I wasn't sure. It was called summer. It almost looked like a body, but then I just wasn't sure. Heat wave, but fresh. A play of distortion.
00:42:15.604 - 00:42:44.256, Speaker A: So maybe just an abstract here. Great color here from cider. And I actually brought it up big here just so we can see, you know, what is going on here. You know, a lot of kind of different, you know, kind of multicolored noise in here. And as you see here, just the texture on the black is pretty cool. So, you know, really cool. Work here from cider, as usual.
00:42:44.256 - 00:42:58.720, Speaker A: Kind of looks noisy. Maybe a little transformed out. Just great, great digital textures here. Beautiful. Great color too, by the way. And here, I think, is one, or actually maybe a couple more casual drive. Interesting.
00:42:58.720 - 00:43:21.080, Speaker A: Again, kind of looks transformed out a little bit, doesn't it? So maybe part of what's going on here. Interesting colors here. And that has not sold yet. And finally we have another one here, battlefield, which looks like a soccer field here. And with maybe some explosions on it. Hard to tell. And maybe some players.
00:43:21.080 - 00:43:38.936, Speaker A: So, pretty interesting. Maybe a combination of a war map and a soccer field, perhaps. Hard to say. A play of distortion with digital illustration and collage. Of course, distortion is another way of describing this. Very cool work from sidere. Demon ego.
00:43:38.936 - 00:43:58.624, Speaker A: With some cool work here too. Let's see here. This kind of looks sprinted, it's not clear. Almost has a bit of a soccer field feel to it, but more of a celebrating the selection tool. And almost what you'd see is the toolbox in photoshop, but not quite. Again, interesting structure. A lot of experimentation here.
00:43:58.624 - 00:44:27.604, Speaker A: Again, it kind of looks printed and everything. So this is posted on x. And we have another one which looks like it has more drawing on top of it. And I wonder, this looks like the under layer of this. So isn't that interesting? It is. So you can see really how demon ego really builds one of their works. So this is like a, you know, underlying canvas.
00:44:27.604 - 00:44:57.818, Speaker A: And then all of the drawing comes on top. Beautiful. Kind of vague echoes of polka Sigmar Polka, as well as even like the Warhol basque collaboration, because you see, you know, Warhol would screen print underneath, kind of. And that's almost the equivalent of this, whereas. And then afterwards, Basquiat would doodle on top, basically. And then here you see the doodling on top, creating a beautiful contrast here. So cool work from demon ego.
00:44:57.818 - 00:45:19.450, Speaker A: This came out earlier, but I didn't see it. This came out, I think, on the first. And this is a signature by rinifish. And I thought this was pretty cool and just wanted to highlight it. Of course, rinifish was hacked the other day, so do support rinifish. I thought this was quite cool and I don't think we've seen that before. So just wanted to highlight that.
00:45:19.450 - 00:45:40.438, Speaker A: That's a part of the Tazo signature series, which is really cool, I think put on, if I'm not mistaken, by Pierrot. So, cool work here. That is 50 tezos edition of 20 on secondary, I believe. Yes. So. Oh, selling for pole. That's funny.
00:45:40.438 - 00:46:08.544, Speaker A: So that is on secondary. Now a new one by axin here. And let me just make it bigger here. So cool work here. What does this say? Please stand by. So you know what this reminds me of? This reminds me of Euxine's earlier work, where there's always kind of a metaphysical under toe or a theme, you might say, to the work. You know, how beautifully this is done.
00:46:08.544 - 00:46:41.034, Speaker A: And this beautiful angle, just a simple angle between the walls here and also here. And the window here. This kind of window to nothing. And beautifully painted there, by the way. Yeah. So it kind of reminds me of Euxine's metaphysical work. I mean, it kind of has a little bit of a play on the cave, so to speak, where there's the fire behind the people that are looking at the, projecting the thing, the light that's coming in, and they see the shadows on the wall.
00:46:41.034 - 00:46:59.218, Speaker A: Kind of looks like a play on the cave. Holographic void. Cool work here. Now 225 tezos on secondary. And what did this sell for? 79 tezos on primary. Nice work there from edition of eleven. Beautiful work as ever.
00:46:59.218 - 00:47:32.190, Speaker A: And here's a work posted by oxyen hilariously with this text, I thought, just interesting. And of course, coming from that meme. And also probably a painting that I don't recognize, but nice again, making it look easy here. Super textured, very noisy version of this, you know, friar or monk from the that meme, that x meme. Continuing on the myth with notorious b I g. Really cool work here. And interesting, intense expression here.
00:47:32.190 - 00:48:05.174, Speaker A: Love the color of the shirt as well as the background here. No boxing gloves, interestingly so. Great choice of subject. Interesting how there's no boxing gloves on this one, but having the same maybe, maybe notorious b I g doesn't need boxing gloves because it still feels like a part of that series, doesn't it? So cool work here. Ten tazos, and there are two left on primary. Get it while you can. Dan control was another super interesting subject here.
00:48:05.174 - 00:48:28.430, Speaker A: I guess you'd call this cat's cradle is the game where you get the string and your hands and then you play all the tricks and everything. Very nice piece here. Good morning from Dan Control. Again, looking like it's using the 16 nine ratio canvas size. So very interesting. And beautifully treated there, too. Interesting white background as well.
00:48:28.430 - 00:48:54.502, Speaker A: Interesting choice. I like the minimalism of that. And just it's all about the subject matter here. Your girlfriend. Okay, so this is rustic digital art again, playing off of the video game ideas. And here you see kind of a racing figure here falling off of what looks like, almost like a hard hat Mac or donkey Kong type structure here. And here is with a background.
00:48:54.502 - 00:49:25.294, Speaker A: So again, just very, again, embracing irrationality here, as I always say, with rustic. And here, it's almost like Mario is up here, even though it kind of looks like Donkey Kong. And there you have the duck hunt. So combining different images from game, Nintendo games, let's say high score, the hearts, and then putting a kind of painterly background. Interesting composition, interesting work here. And this was burned, so I'm not sure. There could be a newer one or just burned.
00:49:25.294 - 00:49:47.724, Speaker A: Not sure. Continuing on, Santiago. And this is interesting. So there are two works here, and, of course, they take a little while to look. You'll see they're very similar. One, you could argue, is the rawr version, watching a very sad movie. And then you see all of this text here, and we'll just make it big here for a second.
00:49:47.724 - 00:50:15.030, Speaker A: So another abstract by Santiago. I love the. I love how it's the, I love how it goes right to the edge here, but then here, there's a lot of breathing room. Again, it just gives a different feel. Just another beautiful abstract here. Another thing that's interesting, though, is what you're going to see here is there are certain elements. Like, you see this here, the green brush.
00:50:15.030 - 00:50:52.818, Speaker A: This is like a earlier or later, maybe some layers removed. It's right here, too. And then you look at the title and watching a very sad movie without all the other text, so it's a more raw, for example, version. And I think it brings up that whole interesting debate of where do you stop as an artist. Right? And they both have their merits. Again, as I like to say, it's like, in design, there's more than one right. There are right answers and wrong answers, but there are more than one right answer.
00:50:52.818 - 00:51:04.130, Speaker A: And I'd argue that's what you have here. It's like they're both. None of them. Neither of them is quote unquote wrong, as far as I can tell. Looks fine to me. So it's just interesting. So, you know, I think it's.
00:51:04.130 - 00:51:36.398, Speaker A: It just illustrates the decisions that artists need to make. It's a very much a decision making process, as almost everything. Here's more here, physical drawing. And, of course, I follow Santiago. That is an x glitch there, and just nice drawing paper, this kind of nice torn paper here and looking like a kind of a watercolor, but you see, like, similar style here, but physical. So interesting there, too. Continuing on cycles of eternity by Lu Lan Wu.
00:51:36.398 - 00:52:05.044, Speaker A: If I'm pronouncing that. Right. And this is new on super rare, minted on January 21. So another interesting illustration here, and let's see if we can go any further. So here it is. My computer is already starting to act up a bit, so I'm not going to magnify any more in case it's a huge file, but pretty cool kind of skeleton. We've seen their work before and just an interesting combination of almost kind of architectural elements.
00:52:05.044 - 00:52:20.714, Speaker A: You know, stairs, little bell tower here. There's a sun, but kind of designy. Just interesting work. Recognizable color scheme. Again, Lulan Woi. That's a reserve of 2.26 ETH on super rare.
00:52:20.714 - 00:52:55.014, Speaker A: Lewis Osborne with a work. And what is this amount of? 30 listed on object in the limelight. So we're watching the work in progress here on this one. And kind of a, you know, a play on the surveillance. Remember, we were seeing the cameras and there was the, you know, the person, I think, surrounded by surveillance cameras. Here's another take on it. Almost this panopticon idea, where, again, you have the person in the middle with the unhappy face and eyes watching from all corners.
00:52:55.014 - 00:53:14.448, Speaker A: So more surveillance theme in the limelight. Kind of a subtle title there from Lewis Osborne. Not listed yet on object. Very cool. And Katarina create with a couple here in the rider series. Joyful rider. And this sold for 20 tezos to humans of the universe.
00:53:14.448 - 00:53:41.874, Speaker A: And a nice, nicely illustrated and animated work here with this time, looking like a Pegasus here. And the figure. The Catrina create character here with a flower, with flowers growing out of the body here and here, out of the Pegasus, maybe. And just nice colors and everything. Great textures here. Again, kind of a dream world. Kind of clouds here.
00:53:41.874 - 00:53:57.314, Speaker A: You could say it's snow, but it's more like clouds and kind of gives the impression of warm weather. Joyful rider. Interesting piece. Mysterious piece. This one was great, too. Flying rider. And here, kind of a dove like figure, character, animal.
00:53:57.314 - 00:54:35.920, Speaker A: And the figure this time with darker hair. So maybe a different character with maybe a different haircut here, riding this dove. And here, almost kind of a Christmas feeling here with these plants, but not necessarily almost like those berries you find at Christmas. Is that mistletoe? Not sure, but this is probably just a flower, abstracted flower going through the air. So in kind of a different feel to this one in terms of how you don't have the landscape ground in it, but works quite well. Beautifully balanced here. And there are a few raindrops coming in, a few illustrated raindrops.
00:54:35.920 - 00:55:03.516, Speaker A: Just a really interesting. Again, kind of a surreal illustration 30 tezos edition of one on object there. And here we have a new one by Jake Studios. Patron saints of mixed signals. Let's look at this. And again, kind of like this crown of thorns barbed wire reference here. And these red marks kind of evoking blood and then kind of like a ghost here.
00:55:03.516 - 00:55:41.152, Speaker A: So again, kind of a very kind of intuitive and suggestive sort of image here, feeling like it refers to Christ, but not necessary, but not directly. And then you have all of these screens attached to the barbed wire with happy and sad faces and different information on it. And then alive, you know, just to cap it off there. Alive signal, as if it's a tv broadcast. Interesting background here with the. This very interesting gradient because it looks like it's kind of stretched out a little bit, or noisy, so to speak. Very digitally drawn animation.
00:55:41.152 - 00:55:54.734, Speaker A: Jake Studios edition of ten for seven tazos. Cool work. Original. Let's continue here. If it loads, we shall see. Here we go. Oh, that's why it took so long.
00:55:54.734 - 00:56:17.840, Speaker A: Okay, so this is a massive file. Hopefully it doesn't crash the computer here. It's 15,000. It's La Pepesis. And this is several artists here. Aloho en Laflour, Morlakos, Wasteman, Goldman and Pepelandia. So we can't zoom in because it may crash my computer.
00:56:17.840 - 00:56:44.140, Speaker A: But I did want to highlight this because I thought it was quite hilarious. Kind of has a bit of an Ezra Eslin feel to it, playing with the. And there's where's Waldo over there. And then you see all sorts of stuff going on here. And there is McDonald's and it's Pepelandia 24. Just a fun, cool work here. Collaboration here in the street, here in the city scene with a whole bunch of pepes there.
00:56:44.140 - 00:56:57.396, Speaker A: Let's see what's going on on the market here. Ten tezos edition of 33. And there are how many listed? 25 listed. So cool work there. Look who's back. Look who's back. It's Adelia.
00:56:57.396 - 00:57:40.080, Speaker A: I'm very happy to see Adelia back, who took a break here in a collaboration with one of one neo. And this may have been burned. I think there's another version just to play, give you a feel. Pretty cool music. So pretty cool album cover and music here from Adelia. And I think it said one of. One of one neo.
00:57:40.080 - 00:58:14.646, Speaker A: The music who made the written and performed. So who did the music in visual art by Adelia? Again, great to see Adelia here. And one of Adelia's kind of favorite things is to do the synths here. And here's the person, you know, making their music at their computer. You know, if you go to Adelia's early work, some of my favorite nfts, they're just beautiful and just really capture. Again, I almost put it. It has a manga feel to it, but I almost put it under, like, a contemporary illustration category, which is kind of its own weird genre.
00:58:14.646 - 00:58:51.878, Speaker A: Weird in the sense that illustration and contemporary that this is a thing, but it most definitely is. I think Tornado Rodriguez commented on that at one point here. Again, you see kind of like the Mac window circles here, just very modern. And maybe our friend here, the musician, dreaming of the girl who is coming through the computer screen here in love, making the music to impress, perhaps pushing daisies. Really, really cool work here. This is a one of one. There may be a newer edition on the market there.
00:58:51.878 - 00:59:23.734, Speaker A: Dana Ulama, good night. And I thought this was great, too. I didn't remember, it's probably an older one, but I didn't remember seeing it. So I thought, let's add this. And again, you see all of the brilliance of Dana Ulama here with the person looking in the rearview mirror. The cyberpunk colors, although a little bit of a morning cyberpunk palette here, as Dana Ulama was pointing out in another time. But again, feels like the future here with these traffic signs over top of this freeway and even just the way the freeway is done.
00:59:23.734 - 00:59:40.466, Speaker A: Really, really cool work. And there's the city in the background. Very ambitious and beautifully animated. So cool work there from Dana Ulama. And another one by Seba Sistero. Memory number eleven. Again, surreal, like illustration here.
00:59:40.466 - 01:00:33.856, Speaker A: And with a lot of texture in here, too. Interestingly, with this kind of rolling or cycling background here, that's a little bit on, purposely out of focus in a kind of pixelated way. Cool work here. All to say enigmatic with the hands here and the different colors. And again, what do we see here? If we had to interpret this, it looks like the back of a head, right? So again, what are we seeing here? Is this the inside? Is this inner space, in other words, like, is that what's going on here, these fragments of images, these memories? And then a weird kind of, you know, surreal person standing on a chair. An interesting kind of, you know, almost illustration of thinking here to a certain degree, one could argue. Interesting piece.
01:00:33.856 - 01:01:04.628, Speaker A: Memory number eleven. Again, we're kind of back to memories here. Really interesting. And the fuzzed outedness of the background. Well, maybe that's the fuzzed outedness of our memories right? It's not like it's in high resolution when we remember something necessarily web lilies. Cool work here by don't buy. Putting a little bit of blue computer screen here and some text here in the middle and using the outline of a flower, almost like collage here within that.
01:01:04.628 - 01:01:24.564, Speaker A: Just an interesting combination here. And color contrast. And as you see the rose or the rose petals or flower petals, kind of moving a little bit here. So interesting piece. Cool write up here. See colon flowers that will never wither slash. And also so this sold.
01:01:24.564 - 01:01:47.422, Speaker A: Let's look at the history here. 15 tezos, 815 tezos. And there is Phoebe Hees, who's coming to Berlin, who I am going to message here and meet up with. Edition of three. This is on September 25. And so this sold for 15 tezos each. Got it figured out here.
01:01:47.422 - 01:02:17.724, Speaker A: Retro man stage five. Starwave trader. So a new one from Retro Manny. And of course yesterday's show, the Twitter space. We had a ton on video games and it was great to hear retro Manny see retro Manny in the audience and liking the show. So here is another addition to this work here. This goes for a minute and I'm not sure, I don't think there's, there's no volume, but continuing the video game vibe and pretty exciting work.
01:02:17.724 - 01:02:41.588, Speaker A: And again, someone was mentioning that it's like Star Fox, beautiful landing and everything. So just really just a cool work here. And there's tuna Kuna, so. And off we go. So cool work here. Three tezos, edition of 50 and already selling well here. How many are left? Already got 18 owners.
01:02:41.588 - 01:03:05.994, Speaker A: There are 31 left on primary. Continuing on green ginger. As we pass the hour mark, we're going to speed up here. Unavoidable fate. This is an edition of 20, I thought, kind of an edgy work here. And it's kind of like in its somewhat obscurity, you might say, this tower that's kind of fading away into pixels. Interesting piece.
01:03:05.994 - 01:03:39.780, Speaker A: So this is 1250 by 1250 edition of 20 for three tazos. This was beautiful. This was on the homepage of object coin with screen. This is element Li with what I'd say is a rare kind of full, you know, pixel painting often, almost always. Element Li purposely leaves things as we're going to see maybe in the next one here. This is more kind of typical element ly as you're going to see here. Of course, we looked at element lis the other day, element Li's work the other day.
01:03:39.780 - 01:04:07.264, Speaker A: And here I thought, just really nicely colored. It's interesting to see element Li's work when it's kind of filled out, so to speak. Again, playing with this idea of, like, what is finished and what is raw and where does an artist stop? So coin with screen. A fictional coin that could show its value change in real time. The shape comes from ancient chinese coins that have a square hole, which would be a good fit to put in a little mini screen. So interesting. It's like a concept piece.
01:04:07.264 - 01:04:24.042, Speaker A: This is ten tezos edition of 30. And there are still 25 left on primary. Here's another one. Gates. Another. Just super interesting work here from element ly, this time on Instagram. Continuing on.
01:04:24.042 - 01:04:44.406, Speaker A: Three works here by mech txt boyhood. This is three. This is acceptance. So doing this in backwards order here. And here, another landscape, ample. This is number one. So kind of a more brighter, interesting kind of is this 16 by nine interesting ratio here.
01:04:44.406 - 01:04:58.794, Speaker A: And here is another one. Angst. So kind of, you know, again, kind of wonderfully obscure here a little bit. Especially here. I mean, is that rain? It's almost like the japanese woodcuts. A little bit in the way that's being treated. Even, like right there.
01:04:58.794 - 01:05:19.474, Speaker A: And of course. Yeah, and right there, of course, mech has posted a lot of that, so that wouldn't be a huge revelation here. Pretty cool work. Their triptych, I believe. Finally, you have arrived. This is figments with Kruger. And so this also has some music in it.
01:05:19.474 - 01:05:56.010, Speaker A: A quicker beat with cap or figments. Who is capping? There we go. Pretty fun. So this is 15 tezos, and this is an edition of 20. And there are 16 left. So another cool addition to that, you know, music collaboration that figments is doing there. Here's manadult on Zora.
01:05:56.010 - 01:06:09.976, Speaker A: So a black and white work. Meow conversations. This is being minted for free here. A nice piece here. The black and white ones. Look how good that looks. So it's always interesting now, I'm not sure.
01:06:09.976 - 01:06:30.992, Speaker A: Sometimes it seems like this is one bit, as manital says, I'm not sure if there's a color version of this. You gotta love the background here. There's something to be said for sometimes just taking your work and desaturating it. And it can. It's like a whole other mix that can really look great. Here's another one. This is Maison.
01:06:30.992 - 01:06:59.574, Speaker A: Probably the same account as Maison the third abyssal embrace. So this is also on Zora. So interesting piece here would hang pretty well with kappan, I think, here. And just kind of a Sci-Fi space with some kind of interesting noise in the fills here. Mason flow again on Zora. Here's another interesting work. So go Golitis back on the scene with Gangoya.
01:06:59.574 - 01:07:24.420, Speaker A: And of course Gangoya has made a huge amount of collaborations with people with this kind of gangoya figure in profile. And here is the go go litis version in black and white here too. Or desaturated, shall we say. Maybe a touch of blue in those grays. Pretty interesting piece here. This is 69 tezos. This is an addition that is on secondary.
01:07:24.420 - 01:07:48.424, Speaker A: And these all sell kind of a cult. It has a bit of a cult following. Gangoia here, a highly advanced Tamagotchi mecha feline edition of 24 on Tazos here. And another work. So go Golitis is back, which is great to see after taking a little break there. Holographic meteor shower. So more experimentation, almost hard to process here.
01:07:48.424 - 01:08:20.172, Speaker A: And interesting again. It looks almost like rain, but I guess it's a meteor shower. Let's see what's going on here. Accept offer of twelve tezos. So I think accepting offers, if I'm not mistaken, here on primary from Gogolitis. And here's Zoxo. Zoxo circles who often plays with elements from Nintendo and maybe Super Mario and other video games, as you can see here, making abstracts basically out of it or geometric abstract.
01:08:20.172 - 01:08:43.114, Speaker A: Zoxo Circle 982 tezos. So that must have been a one of one that went for auction to trippie or catacomb. Picking it up for 296 I think, edition of four. So very cool. Here's Haiti Rockette with a hockey Nintendo glitz Rom. So I thought this was great. Just fritzing out or glitching out the left hand side there.
01:08:43.114 - 01:08:56.610, Speaker A: The audience also looks great. Nice. Just a beautiful piece. I mean there's not much to say about it. Interesting. Haiti's using hockey in this one. And I thought, again, it's just a real standout.
01:08:56.610 - 01:09:19.182, Speaker A: You just. I love the composition, so to speak. Continuing on Windows XP by Ugo Ugo DG. So interesting take on the Windows XP home screen here. Processing it out with these huge almost Zozo like pixels. Interesting. Very interesting.
01:09:19.182 - 01:09:43.740, Speaker A: Cool work there, Pebuso. That was posted on X Pabuso. This is an edition of one for ten tezos. I thought an interesting work here. Kind of fuzzed out a little bit or fuzz, you know, slightly out of focused anime figure here, painted here. Just an interesting piece. And what is going on? This is a one of one from Kikilo, ten tezos.
01:09:43.740 - 01:10:07.804, Speaker A: Pretty reasonable. And that was just minted today, so maybe that's still available. And here's a new work from Wok now. Three tezos, 25 tezos cents edition of one. And from what I believe is a September 11, 911 series here, going minute by minute. Now we are at 10:00 it'll be interesting to see when it stops. Obsolete language.
01:10:07.804 - 01:10:33.958, Speaker A: This is by Gonz. Just an interesting abstract here. And as you can see up close, all sorts of action going on in here. And again, you get that kind of colorful noise that we're seeing in Yuri, that we're seeing that colorful digital noise. We're seeing insider kind of another, an interesting contrast with the green in the background up there. Interesting piece. Obsolete language.
01:10:33.958 - 01:10:49.784, Speaker A: Love the title glitch. Abstract artwork made with code by Gonz. This is 60 tezos. It is a one of one. And here is inavare Rainbow connection. And this is five sol by now. And this is on exchange art.
01:10:49.784 - 01:11:23.258, Speaker A: So on Solana here. So another just really kind of beautifully textured and colored analog video glitch from innovare, who has sold for five sol here before Saul. So continuing to look at, look at how great these look together, too beautiful. This sold for five Saul here as well. And this one sold for five Saul. So doing really well here on Solana in Avare. There is an audience for analog glitch on Solana.
01:11:23.258 - 01:11:39.430, Speaker A: I thought this was great. This is John Cates, an Internet catch, an Internet question. Have you seen this cat? And beautifully glitched out here. And maybe that's an Internet meme in there. Not sure. But I thought just a nice piece. Eizo with another portrait.
01:11:39.430 - 01:12:33.700, Speaker A: Paula MorALes it was great when I worked with Eizo, when Eizo did the portrait that I did, what was cool about what Eizo was saying is working with all kinds of artists from big and small and everything, and just a really, really well managed collaborator, which, you know, I always say, like, I like collaboration in theory, but in practice it can be pretty challenging. Eizo is a great collaborator. And here's just another really cool work here as Eizo continues to do portraits of artists within the community, I assume. Paolo Morales, you know, to Eizo's point, I'm not sure I know. Paola Morales so another, let's see. Yeah, so, you know, mission accomplished there, Eizo, as we just, you know, a way of getting people's art out there. Interdisciplinary artist explore the intersections between different medium, styles and cultures.
01:12:33.700 - 01:13:25.064, Speaker A: PRmVM Palomarles here's another one by Klaus, a composition number 92. More beautiful colors here. And great glitchery by Klaus and approaching 100 on these works here for 24 tezos that has just been minted out. And listed here is House of the model. More awesome, awesome music. I hope you can hear that. I mean, I don't want to stop it.
01:13:25.064 - 01:13:48.064, Speaker A: I don't want to stop it. There is so much good music out of this scene. There's the culture from the Kurt Hussle collective, those artists there, host of the model, who I've long said, kind of an inside joke here on this show, but not really. If there's a Tezos party host of the model, we want to be like the headliner there. But I mean, you could have. There's so much good music. Look how great this is.
01:13:48.064 - 01:14:00.662, Speaker A: Like, so just out here on the blockchain. Super great musicians. And nice glitch there, too. In the video. It goes perfectly. It's a perfect video. Sango by Reinke.
01:14:00.662 - 01:14:24.758, Speaker A: This is an edition of one. This is 60 tezos. More innovation here. You know, Renki has been putting out, I think, a work a day, or at least every weekday, probably every day for what feels like a year. And you just get the sense that Reinky is just going to keep going. It turns into a massive body of work and it's just quite interesting to follow where it's going to go. So, cool work here.
01:14:24.758 - 01:14:52.764, Speaker A: 60 tezos, one of one on primary. And here is Morgan Hgby flowers, who I was calling rainbow before. So it's because tea is kind of hard to find the name here sometimes. So here, curls by Morgan. Cool work here. And here, that is three tazos. And here's an addition of 50 for one tezos, also by Morgan Croucher skin.
01:14:52.764 - 01:15:12.314, Speaker A: So just interesting. I guess you'd call this analog, or I guess you'd call it just video. Abstract video. And here, glitch here. So we got a clue here. So analog abstract video glitch is, I think, what we'd call this. It doesn't feel super analog, but it's hard to tell.
01:15:12.314 - 01:15:27.754, Speaker A: Who knows? Similar colors here from skammer. Also using stable diffusion. Kind of abstracting things out a little bit, right. Kind of removing a lot of the details. Kind of a raw look here. I don't think we've looked at this one. I love what's going on here.
01:15:27.754 - 01:16:05.378, Speaker A: Very powerful, the computer, even the outline here. I think we might have looked at this one because I do remember this gradient. So it's possible we looked, but we may have passed over it too quickly because that computer and the typing and how it just disintegrates I love that. Again, that is beautiful. That's why, again, I'm kind of back to this. What makes art art is it's got this kind of irrational component like this doesn't really make sense, right? But it does within the context. It's kind of back to this idea.
01:16:05.378 - 01:16:28.114, Speaker A: It must be art. Let's continue here. Bolin 132, oil painting. Now, I believe 1933, woman on a chair. I believe this is AI, I think unquestionably here when we look up close, so. But AI, oil painting, shall we call it? Pretty nice work. Kind of nice, kind of classical feel to it.
01:16:28.114 - 01:17:00.920, Speaker A: Woman on a chair. And again, one of the many ways you can use AI is you could use this also. It's a work in itself. You could also use it as a source for oil painting as well. Has a touch of a Picasso feel to it, doesn't it? Let's continue here. Already at hour 16. Interesting work put on exchange by Riop, who I think, I don't think I've seen before spring is constantly calling me four of four soldiers and not sure, maybe I don't see for how much here.
01:17:00.920 - 01:17:33.472, Speaker A: Nice piece, though, which is really what I wanted to highlight here. Looks like some kind of photography collage. Digital collage, perhaps, but maybe not maybe real collage with what looks like real brushstrokes here. But this. This purple here kind of looks painted. It's getting harder and harder to tell what a digital brushstroke is. That looks pretty real in the top, right? Doesn't it? So hard to say, but I'd guess that this purple here in the marker, I'd argue that's digital.
01:17:33.472 - 01:17:51.288, Speaker A: So it looks like a hybrid. It looks like a hybrid. Cool piece. Minimal color with black and white. You know, that could be almost any color, that purple, if you made it red or orange, you know, just that minimal color with black and white. Often it just seems to work. This is really cool.
01:17:51.288 - 01:18:23.792, Speaker A: By sky Goodman Sega Forever is the title here working in all, like, who knows how Sky Goodman made this? But again, kind of looks like some AI, some process, huge processing here. Look at how just, like, destroyed these lines are here. And this pixelation here. Just really interestingly done. And there's something about the video game character and even colors here that kind of really grounds this work. Even here. Kind of.
01:18:23.792 - 01:18:53.638, Speaker A: It is reminiscent in a distant on. In a somewhat distant, not too distant way of video game pixelation. And just, I guess, animation. A nice piece. And here, of course, no hygiene. Who we're seeing RJ do a show on earlier and write an essay on baby with new hair transplant made with mid journey. So more just edgy, risky AI art by no hygiene.
01:18:53.638 - 01:19:22.054, Speaker A: Baby with new hair transplant made with mid journey. Pretty interesting. Again, car accident in person, looking into the broken mirror with fear. So interesting piece. And kind of looking pixelated here, but as you'll see, kind of curved pixels here. Again, in AI, the pixelation is not perfect, so you get these weird little, you know, anomalies. So it feels like pixel art, but it feels also, but not exactly so interesting work here, by no hygiene.
01:19:22.054 - 01:19:52.274, Speaker A: And the George Costanza of NFT is picking this one up for seven tazos. And that is an edition of one. Interesting experimentation from Mo. Shit time after birth here. Some AI artwork as well, with some great textures in here. Kind of feeling like a medieval manuscript on one hand, and also like a modern city is being depicted here on the other, with what looked like volcanoes almost in the background, with kind of rainbow colors coming out. And, of course, some AI text, which is the giveaway here at the bottom.
01:19:52.274 - 01:20:33.872, Speaker A: Time after birth, 30 tezos edition of one on object. And this was interesting, too. Cursed King by Ilya moved and almost, I think Ilya moved, if I'm not mistaken, does those stitched AI works, the AI works that look like stitching and textiles, and it kind of looks like that's what's going on here. Interesting piece of this medieval looking, you know, 12th or 13th century looking king with the eyes leaking there. Continuing on, Lily illo with a really nice, what almost looks like an oil painting here. What is this called? Avoiding innocent comfort. I printed it out and pinned it above my desk, and it has inspired me.
01:20:33.872 - 01:20:56.708, Speaker A: Oh, maybe. Sorry, the. After I read your words, I printed it out and pinned it above my desk. Not sure if that's referring to the words or to the work, but again, this feels like a painting, doesn't it? It's got the texture of a painting here. And again, playing with this chairs and architecture series, I believe. Continuing on as we wrap up here, Olivera Durdevik. And here, bliss.
01:20:56.708 - 01:21:18.432, Speaker A: And kind of a family scene here. Mom and child, maybe, and an outdoor with this pink sky AI artwork. Interesting. Just sitting on, like, a bean bag of sorts. Cool work here. And this was transferred to Daniel King AI collection art addict, edition of ten, available for six tazos on primary. Here's another one by mo.
01:21:18.432 - 01:21:54.674, Speaker A: More experimentation here. Kind of has a little bit of a body cell y kind of feel to it in the hair, doesn't it? Also has a little bit of a joan of arc feeling in the subject. And here, kind of a religious feeling. And you see these cupids here also vaguely has a birth of Venus here, but also with Leonardo here in that Madonna of the rocks. So whole bunch of stuff going on in this very interesting AI artwork with six. Is that six fingers? 12345. And then if you add the thumb, that would be six.
01:21:54.674 - 01:22:21.994, Speaker A: Interesting piece here from Mo eleven tezos edition of one AI artwork. And here is Parsa Mostagim with a. What is this, CGI? So interesting work here by Parsa. Look at that. The inside of the guts and everything. So this is CGI starving in the belly of a whale. So kind of a biblical theme here or reference, likely.
01:22:21.994 - 01:22:46.384, Speaker A: So that is interesting. Continuing on, look at this great painting as we go into the physicals. Bill Russell, Boston Celtics there's something extraordinarily charming about this work. Like this work could have started this show for me. There's something very touching and beautifully painted about this work. Acrylic on wood. Maybe that's what gives it its beautiful textured quality.
01:22:46.384 - 01:23:09.964, Speaker A: You really do get the wood really comes out of here. A very, very interesting artist. Isabella Disclafani. Bill Russell. So Bill Russell is the artist Boston, or wait, that's the subject. Bill Russell is the subject. Isabella Disclavani is the artist, I believe, available in my shop.
01:23:09.964 - 01:23:30.964, Speaker A: I wonder how much that is. So this is interesting. We've been looking at a lot of Mark Belden as we wrap up here. And Mark Belden typically does flowers and often a home, as people who have watched this show will know. It looks like we have a couch. So my, you know, that definitely set off alarm bells in my brain here. I can't believe we have a couch.
01:23:30.964 - 01:23:48.872, Speaker A: Yellow sofa. This is from 2022. Oil on linen, 36 by 41. So it is an older work. Very interesting. I'm really enjoying seeing different subject matter from Mark Belden with this gorgeous sense of color that this artist has. Just incredible sense of color.
01:23:48.872 - 01:24:08.914, Speaker A: Machine, how girls sleep by machine. So kind of a. One assumes a satirical work here by machine, but you never know. And so here is machine sleeping in money here. And just an interesting kind of hilarious piece. You know, we comment on the humor. I've commented on the humor here.
01:24:08.914 - 01:24:53.700, Speaker A: We see it with also bozo Bandizo, this kind of new school humor that has entered the visual arts, which is kind of a little bit Internet y, but it feels like, you know, next generation ish. We see that with machine there, too. Here's another work by nuggetbrain and pretty fun. Two with two lambs, seemingly almost a biblical kind of theme there with this beautiful background and then cherries, almost like representing these two lambs together here, united by twine, by the same kind of stem here. Just one of my favorite artists, I have to say, of physical work. Like, we looked at this the other day, you know, like, this is just amazing to me. Just amazing.
01:24:53.700 - 01:25:14.848, Speaker A: I just love this artist, the computer. Just a brilliant, brilliant artist. Nugget brain, Abel Burger here, I believe. Kind of an interestingly painted work here. I like the size, too. Look how great that looks on the wall. And then you look at the details here.
01:25:14.848 - 01:25:33.376, Speaker A: It looks like a multimedia work, you know. Again, it's back to this looks like art thing. It's like, oh, no, I'm not going to worry about going right to the edges. And you know what? That makes it more interesting. I'm not going to worry about, you know, doing this all perfect. And it's more interesting. I don't mind if it bleeds extra here.
01:25:33.376 - 01:25:54.212, Speaker A: And then I get a darker blue here. And here it makes it more interesting. Again, it's this embracing the, you know, randomness of physical reality. You see it here, you know, kind of, it's another take on the non finito, in a sense. It's leaving it partially unfinished. And here we see it here. It's like, no, I'm not going to worry about finishing in all of the bowl here.
01:25:54.212 - 01:26:28.084, Speaker A: Looks beautiful. Instant poetry continuing on. It's not gallery has posted such, so many interesting works I've started to notice have come from it's not gallery. And so here's another one, Eliot Gamer, you know, really on the forefront, you know, that humor I was discussing, you know, it really seems to understand there's something very next generation ish about it's not gallery. So another kind of interesting artist here, Elliot Gamer. Interesting piece here. Kind of has a bit of a medieval feel to it, interestingly.
01:26:28.084 - 01:26:53.930, Speaker A: And just different treatments. And just what is going on with this faded image? Is that like erased? And then they try a different image. Who knows? Bondozo Bandido, Jeff Koons. Look at this. I mean, this is just so fun and interesting and putting out works like every day that are just super interesting here. There's something to be said for working fast. Like this person seems to be working constantly.
01:26:53.930 - 01:27:14.354, Speaker A: I think it's Enrique Herms. And when you do that, you're not worrying about like every tiny little. You're not fussing over every little detail. It's a very fun way to work. So it's very fun to just work fast for the sake of working fast sometimes. Zoe Kim because what happens is you start to normalize working fast. That's the benefit.
01:27:14.354 - 01:27:55.844, Speaker A: And then all of a sudden it's, that's how Picasso, you know, it's like, it's almost like this show, you set a deadline and then you just do it and whatever comes out comes out. And then over time you're going to get better at doing that show, right? So it's the same kind of mentality. Zoe Kim illustrations for Sandwich magazine so here are some of these. This, I'm not sure if it's an airbrush artist and that's another theme we've been seeing. But all to say again, just very interesting kind of illustrative artists here for sandwich magazine and that is your show. My friends, thank you for joining me in this hour and a half here and sharing your time with me and I totally appreciate it and everything. So have a great day and until next time, take care.
