00:00:04.200 - 00:00:22.654, Speaker A: We are getting into the groove, ladies and gentlemen and everyone, welcome back. As we continue our journey here. Only two more days till I may take. Actually, I am taking an extended three week vacation. That is this. This music is me taking my vacation. Flying over.
00:00:22.654 - 00:00:55.942, Speaker A: Flying over Italy, over to Sicily. Artist journal, April 10, 2024. Broadcasting from the plane in my mind as I look down on the italian coast on my way to land in Catania, back to Taormina. I had to go back. I had to go back and back to Syracuse and then back to Rome to visit the relatives. I've been practicing my Italian. I'm very curious indeed, very curious to see how that all turns out for me from a language perspective.
00:00:55.942 - 00:01:17.530, Speaker A: But. So the show, I guess, show note, the show will be sporadic. It will go off of its regular three day structure here, and it'll be more improvised, I assume. I will do one, maybe even two or three. It's quite fun when you do it on the road and you have an incredible view. But they will be more sporadic. It's good to recharge.
00:01:17.530 - 00:02:19.564, Speaker A: It's good to take breaks in all your creative endeavors and just all things in life. I've been seeing all these in the YouTube algorithm. All of these videos have been coming up about regrets in life, death, people at the end of their lives. Did they have any regrets? What's quite interesting, and I've been seeing it in my twitter, too, I don't know if it's something that is in the algorithm or what is happening, if everybody else has seen it or just me, but on x two, and really at the top of it, was this over concern? The biggest regret, generally speaking, is an over concern for money and for material possessions, generally. They're asking people who seem to have a fair amount of money, interestingly, maybe that's even more interesting to a certain degree. And so why am I bringing this up? It's good to take breaks. And the other one was, I worked too much.
00:02:19.564 - 00:02:37.080, Speaker A: I worked too much. Was the other one. I don't feel that way. Kind of feel like I'm on a mission here to a certain degree. And I actually, this is a journal, so. But all to say, it's good to recharge, even in your art projects and everything. My Donne pixel art thing, this is on ordinals.
00:02:37.080 - 00:02:58.496, Speaker A: This is. This is acid. Killer acid. This is killer acid. This is on ordinals. I'm getting excited. I don't know if you can feel the hype, but the runes thing, if you're in the bitcoin bitcoin, kind of ordinal development on bitcoin space.
00:02:58.496 - 00:03:21.780, Speaker A: This runes thing, the hype is getting pretty darn loud. So it's getting interesting. Let's actually put it this way. It continues to be interesting on bitcoin and art on bitcoin continues to turn the head. And we saw a preview of what's going to happen here, I think is this. I think on in. I think it's April 12.
00:03:21.780 - 00:04:11.552, Speaker A: We're going to see the tweet in a second. But where super rare and gamma IO are going to collaborate for this drop and for those that aren't on super rare, I was thinking to myself, and I don't even have a profile on gamma, but for those that aren't on super rare and you kind of wish you were on it, I think it I again, I'm pretty sure you can just sign up and be on gamma and start putting your art there. And it's kind of like the bitcoin equivalent, if bitcoin is your thing and it's not everybody's thing. So I'll just say, look at how interesting this is because you have to keep it low file size. I mean, this is still, I think about 100 kb each of these and there's 40 of these. It's kind of like a PFP project to a certain degree. Let me show you here.
00:04:11.552 - 00:04:57.530, Speaker A: So this is on the ordinals or Ord IO website. I think Leonidas owns or started this website, if I'm not mistaken. And interestingly, you see this, I don't know if you can see that it says parent. So there's a way of inscribing these, I guess the parent child programming relationship, so to speak. And I don't know how to do that, but I sure am curious, let's put it this way. So this all looks pretty cool. Again, killer acid, a fairly prominent artist, I'd say, on the scene, has this, you know, kind of, I'd say kind of, you know, zap comics of the seventies shout out to Rada.
00:04:57.530 - 00:05:33.526, Speaker A: It kind of has a zap comics kind of feel to it, right, with the psychedelic counterculture comics, c o M I X as they put it, in the underground comic sphere. So pretty cool work too, actually. Pretty cool artist, as we see here, this skull with a tongue hanging out. And of course, we've been seeing a lot of killer acid over the last few months, you know, starting opening a store, if I'm not mistaken. And was it Oakland, maybe? Somewhere in California. So doing all sorts of very interesting things. It's got a California vibe to it for sure.
00:05:33.526 - 00:05:57.996, Speaker A: Again, that psychedelic underground comics sort of vibe. There's, of course, a bitcoin coin in the mouth of this almost like as gold aztec statue. So just really interesting work. So here's the info. It is tomorrow, Thursday, April 11, at 02:00 p.m. eastern Standard Time. Killer acid's first collection of bitcoin ordinals and no brainers.
00:05:57.996 - 00:06:20.084, Speaker A: They're called, hilariously, 40 hand drawn one of ones. And they are 0.1 bitcoin each, which may not look like a lot when you look at that number. That's $7,000 each. So not cheap. And it is a blind mint, so you don't even necessarily know what you're getting, interestingly. Or which one.
00:06:20.084 - 00:06:49.556, Speaker A: How interesting. Killer acid, super rare and trigamma. So it's going to be very interesting. I assume this is going to sell out just because we have a very prominent artist and we have all of the hype of, you know, super rare and gamma IO together. There's only 40, so, yeah, should be interesting. Let's take a quick look here. And I brought up some others, but there are 40, so we're not gonna be able to look at all of them.
00:06:49.556 - 00:07:29.754, Speaker A: Kind of interesting. The background here, you see how there's this textured background that goes across these vertical lines, and then here there's a textured background. So just from a graphic design perspective, for lack of better term, this one's quite beautiful in the colors too. It's an interesting technique. You see it here, a different texture on each one. And then one of these, you see here, 110 kb. Now, from what I remembered from my experiments and when I knew very, when I was just starting and kind of flying blind, it was about $10 per kilobyte is what it was costing me.
00:07:29.754 - 00:07:56.126, Speaker A: I don't know if it's more expensive now or less expensive. It helps if you do it in the morning european time, but that would mean this would cost about $1,000. At that rate, I assume it's cheaper. And maybe the parent child way of inscribing things, perhaps is a cheaper way of doing it. Creation fee. Shall we look? Shall we look? Okay. 191 sats.
00:07:56.126 - 00:08:20.054, Speaker A: This should be quite helpful. And here's just so we saw that one and a couple of others. There's Pepe in the middle of the brain. That's pretty hilarious. Let's see if we can find and coingecko.com and go to bitcoin. And let's just see how much that cost.
00:08:20.054 - 00:08:45.753, Speaker A: Oh, wait, so Sats. We need a sat to sets to USD converter Satoshi. Yeah, this is actually helpful, by the way. Let's go back here. So 191,370. And here we go. $132.
00:08:45.753 - 00:09:11.593, Speaker A: That's it. Is that wow. So wow. I mean, if you're from outside of the crypto space, you might say that's a lot of money. $132 to make your thing, if that's all it costs. You know, I've been making these four kilobyte files, two kilobyte files, in order to save money. So clearly I need to talk to someone here.
00:09:11.593 - 00:09:31.956, Speaker A: So for now, that's 191 set. So $132 for. I mean, if you're paying a dollar a kilobyte a little more, I mean, that changes everything. So maybe they minted it at the right time. I don't know. This one's only 80. Fee was this, but the fee was more expensive.
00:09:31.956 - 00:09:51.064, Speaker A: Let's just check here. 43,000. But I mean, no, this is $99. So. And then you sell it for 7000. And that is one heck of a nice business that you have going there. So how interesting is that? I did not realize it was so cheap.
00:09:51.064 - 00:10:21.064, Speaker A: I wonder how they did that. So clearly, if anybody knows, feel free to reach out and send me a message. If someone knows how to mint cheap, I need to do some more experiments. Clearly here, and I've probably been way overpaying, but look how cool this is. So all to say, it should be pretty interesting again, I expect this to fly out the door just because if you look at killer acids work on object. I should have brought that up. Let me bring it up quickly here.
00:10:21.064 - 00:10:47.120, Speaker A: If we can find it, it sells for quite a bit of money and we're going to get to this object one drop in a second. Killer acid, as you see here. So here's killer acid's page. There's not much actually. I think he's mostly an eth artist, if I'm not mistaken. Clearly multi chain. But as you see here on secondary, 275 is the lowest you will pay and you can pay up to 1200 on secondary.
00:10:47.120 - 00:11:28.244, Speaker A: And these are, this is an edition of 69. I almost bought this at one point when it was a little cheaper, just to kind of round out when I was making the museum, the digital art museum, then I just couldn't keep up. Okay, so killer acid, also on object, killer acid, worldwide brand. And there's the logo, so should be interesting to watch. Also interesting, John Cates. I am very excited to have John Cates on og glitch artist og glitch artist from the nineties to now. So we're gonna get a story hopefully today at 330 Berlin time, 930 in New York.
00:11:28.244 - 00:12:01.668, Speaker A: Hopefully we're going to get an incredible story today of glitch from the nineties. Again, I had friends in the late nineties, a couple of friends who are pretty big into glitch. It was more of a music thing, but they also made art. So it's just going to be fascinating to talk to John Cates about this creating glitch western genre across digital art forms and chains. So that is coming up on today's space. Check it out. I believe it is pinned in the, it is pinned on my twitter feed, so it may be happening as you're watching this.
00:12:01.668 - 00:12:25.812, Speaker A: Also, just a big thank you to John Cates. So if you remember the article from a few days ago, John had made a few glitch portraits of your host here. And this was one I was like, I really like this one. This one's amazing. So John minted it. So thank you to John for doing that first mint tea green glitches png one of one. So thank you, John for that beautiful gift.
00:12:25.812 - 00:12:57.810, Speaker A: And also thank you to magician who made a couple of purchases here on the on object one from the promoted stories and then picking up rocket booster here for 60 tezos. This one of one. So big shout out and thank you to magician. Great to see you on the scene magician. Let's look, let's try and look at yesterday's or at last show's comments here. Denise Sanchez Dear Adrian, thank you for reviewing my work. As you mentioned, it's beautiful and powerful to create from improvisation.
00:12:57.810 - 00:13:32.540, Speaker A: I started from a random blotch and then a whole universe unfolded not knowing where it would end because it brought its own information. It is a lot funner you feel alive when you are creating like that. Behind it there's a whole system governed by its own rules, living and breathing like an independent organism. While in the process, and due to the speed of my own imprint, I let myself go. Doubts always arrive, but I know what it's best to let it be. And sometimes we and sometimes we have to reload here. So thank you for the comment.
00:13:32.540 - 00:13:49.602, Speaker A: Denise okay, that is the full comment. Thanks for the kind. Also DJ Kiro thanks for the kind words about my artwork. And yes, you are correct, that is a rannic steer collab. So I believe it was the last one we looked at for an easy way to find out who the collaborator. On the right side of the page it shows splits. This is on foundation and you can see who made the art there.
00:13:49.602 - 00:14:09.706, Speaker A: So thank you Kiro. And some great looking work. Last episode, I think we have another one actually by Kiro. This episode, human boy, I will never forget. A few months ago I was watching the show and my girlfriend came into the room asking me why I'm always listening to the Jeff Goldblum show. Why I'm always listening to Jeff Goldblum. Now, don't think I've shared that with you, but the comment made me remember.
00:14:09.706 - 00:14:32.730, Speaker A: I get it a lot. It's probably, I think that's pretty much, I'd say, 99% of the comparisons I get, which is kind of hilarious. Great episode in under 1 hour. You must have been so happy. Yes, I had an appointment, a hard deadline. I was very happy. This is the ideal is sort of 45 minutes, maybe to an hour, but it is a journal, so it can go wherever it wants.
00:14:32.730 - 00:14:47.178, Speaker A: Thanks for the comment, human boy. I'm glad you're enjoying the show. Lupin. I am a big fan of Denise Sanchez, who is our friend up here. Denise, who made that beautiful abstract. I think it was watercolor or acrylic, maybe on paper. Rada, awesome to hear from you, as always.
00:14:47.178 - 00:15:08.530, Speaker A: Big shout out. And I think of you when I see those works by killer acid, because I know you have the knowledge of the underground comic scene there in California. Okay, let's continue. I don't know where Ratta lives, by the way. I almost assume ratta does live in California, but who knows? I have no idea. Also the community. Thank you everybody for posting here.
00:15:08.530 - 00:15:25.666, Speaker A: It continues to grow nicely. Psycho futurist. I actually have a work by you this episode. Here's another one. Kind of a wild one, with all the psychonography in here. There's an ethereum mixed with religious symbols mixed with just different iconography. Edgy, edgy work.
00:15:25.666 - 00:16:01.574, Speaker A: This was super hilarious and interesting. Luke 500 Chris Torres makes his own art on Micromedia fireworks, an old program. I don't know if I've ever. I know there was Macromedia studio. I became an expert in Dreamweaver in like 2007, acquired by Adobe in 2005. You gotta love this, right? And of course they had flash back then. And remember when Steve Jobs, maybe in 2010 or 2011, wrote the letter, the public letter, as to why he's not going to support Flash on iPhones, which killed Flash? Yeah, remember back then, that was macro media.
00:16:01.574 - 00:16:28.168, Speaker A: So isn't this interesting? So this nyan cat, actual size, by the way, 50 by 50 pixels for the pixel artists out there. This famous work that was made with macro media fireworks animated GiF export. So just hilarious and cool. Great post. And also John cates my enjoy genesis. So collect and enjoy, y'all. So enjoy.
00:16:28.168 - 00:17:07.448, Speaker A: I believe is the crypto that is on Zora, which is kind of Zora's equivalent to the degen crypto that's on base. I'm trying not to lose the general viewer here, but yeah, so I don't know what it's worth. We have a work by Flora Marquez, this show she's selling for enjoy. So I don't know how much, you know, how that's all working, but all to say, you can collect that work by John Cates with enjoy. And here's Amelie with some very wild work of what looked like, you know, very cool work here. So thank you everybody for posting here. Super interesting.
00:17:07.448 - 00:17:27.512, Speaker A: We put human boy in here too. Kind of interesting landscape. And Kurt Hussle collective, I didn't add this one, but we have a genius Kurt Hussle collective that was just released. One of my favorites of all time was just released. I got out of bed to buy it last night. So it's almost starting here. It's going to be in a few tabs here.
00:17:27.512 - 00:17:46.954, Speaker A: Also, Kiro, I believe this work is in the show, so thanks for posting that. And Ernesto, thank you for posting this here too. Cool textures and everything. 2002, thank you for posting. Very interesting artist. 2002 has put a lot of work up on Zora. Ok, nart John Cates, sorry.
00:17:46.954 - 00:18:03.354, Speaker A: Here's Oknart in New York City. Thank you for posting. And also, John Cates, this is hilarious. Computer art is called a genuine new art form. So I'm loving what's happening here in psycho futurist. We're going to look at this work in the show. Macro matry.
00:18:03.354 - 00:18:27.578, Speaker A: Thank you for posting. And August ground also, who's going to be on the show in a couple of weeks? But 1st, 1st, we have John Cates this week and then we have pixel lord again. Thanks for the gift, John. And so all to say, if you want your work to be seen, feel free to post. Here's a nice one. Nice analog glitch. Sarah Kretschmer, we have a few works by you, Sarah, in this episode.
00:18:27.578 - 00:18:59.700, Speaker A: So thank you everybody for posting. Napajo and everyone continuing on. So Katya Kazakhina, the art detective, another story on the new market that is in the contemporary art world. The new reality in contemporary art. The art detective pro. If it goes to zero, fine. Why do collectors pay wild prices for new art? Wooed by galleries, buyers chase artworks like prestige fashion objects.
00:18:59.700 - 00:19:40.168, Speaker A: Do they know what they are doing? Katya Kizakina April 5 everyone knows that from an investment standpoint, buying art is a gamble. If you get the right work at the right price and sell at the right time, you might reap huge profits. But many never recoup what they spend. Right now, you can often find a painting, a drawing, sculpture at auction for a fraction of what it would cost at a gallery. So you're seeing the secondary in the trad, especially the contemporary art market. I don't want to say the bottom's falling out, but to a certain degree, that is a not inaccurate statement. Still, art dealers keep asking and buyers keep paying steep prices for new works.
00:19:40.168 - 00:20:11.354, Speaker A: Isn't this interesting? So the secondary is really having issues, but the primary is kind of sailing along, seemingly. Collectors often describe themselves as addicts, driven by passion for art. I'll speak to that. Actually, I can speak to that. Like, when you start collecting, I think most people who have collected on object, once you start, it's like an addiction. Like, that's why people overspend. You hear unknown collector being like, I can't believe how much money I spent on art.
00:20:11.354 - 00:20:58.714, Speaker A: You know, I, to a certain degree, like, I'm amazed at how, like, when I look at, you know, the bitcoin, more than a bitcoin I spent on art, you know? Yeah, you kind of get into a fever driven by a passion for art. The excitement of the chase and the risk involved involved. The prestige of having access to something coveted by many others is a potent aphrodisiac. And blue chip galleries know how to offer an all an ultra exclusive experience. So here's just, I think here's the meat of it here. But what happens when a collection filled with once desirable artists has to be resold at a time when prices for those artists have plummeted? And this is happening with the Rosa Delacruz collection, which is going to Christie's this spring. Even before her death, Dela Cruz and her husband had been selling art, sometimes for far less than they had once paid.
00:20:58.714 - 00:21:49.454, Speaker A: The trove is estimated to generate $30 million, a fraction of what it was worth several years ago when the couple could have reaped $100 million in profit. So it's a sale to watch, is what Katya Kazakhina is saying. And finally, gallery sales have been slower for almost two years now. So interestingly, and while some dealers are offering bigger discounts on occasion, prices remain stubbornly high. Some buyers say emerging art that used to be ten thousand dollars to twenty thousand dollars at a gallery is now priced at $50 to $60,000, said Adam Greene, a collector and advisor. So it all seems kind of unsustainable, doesn't it? Especially there's no shortage of art out there. There's no shortage of artists like.
00:21:49.454 - 00:22:27.272, Speaker A: And clearly I'd actually just add to that, as I long have said, clearly the value is in entezos and it's a lot easier to store. You have artists who are stuck at this price point. So this is also interesting. When it's something you got to be careful of, you finally make it, you're in a gallery, you start to sell, the prices get expensive. You're thinking this is the greatest thing ever. But then all of a sudden the market turns down and all of a sudden you're used to selling works at 60,000 and the market's really maybe 15,000 for you now. And then the previous buyers, then it gets harder for you to sell.
00:22:27.272 - 00:23:11.162, Speaker A: What do you do? Right? Meanwhile, collectors are becoming more selective, scrutinizing artists cv's. Are they collected by museums? Have they appeared at auctions? How did they respond to the Israel, to the Israel Hamas war? Not easy, is it? Some buyers are hitting the brakes. We are out, a new museum trustee told me this week at the institution spring gala. Others are looking for value. There's less competition at the galleries. It's one of those things, art, all of a sudden it can go from totally where people are spending half a million, a million dollars to almost worthless overnight. It's one of those very weird asset classes.
00:23:11.162 - 00:23:51.432, Speaker A: Others are looking for value. There's less competition at the galleries and less competition at auction. The Amsterdam based collector Freddie Insinger said, I only see opportunities. So still bullish. And then here, the status of collecting. And so all to say, we're seeing more, more developments here, more evidence that the contemporary art market is taking a big breather. It's going to be interesting to see how these works survive the test of time, because a lot of them are pretty esoteric, a lot of the art out there.
00:23:51.432 - 00:24:26.384, Speaker A: I still go to some Berlin art shows, you know, even museum shows, I think at kindle, and you don't know what's going on. Like, you walk in, you don't know what's going on, and you're just wishing you had Kurt Hussle collective on the screen so that you could be entertained, right? With some cool art. So all to say, very interesting from Katie Kazakhina, the art detective. Here's Rudy Adler. I think Rudy I think Rudy actually picked up one of my works years ago on super rare, one of the peloponnesian war works. So shout out to Rudyat eth. I think it's the same person.
00:24:26.384 - 00:24:55.624, Speaker A: That work was actually shown in that one of one interview, as a matter of fact, the black one with the orange guy. So anyways, let's continue. Here's some of my strong opinions loosely held about NFTs that most people I know would disagree with. NFTs will not disrupt replace the art market. The killer use case for NFTs is digital collectibles, not art. That said, NFTs will grow a segment of artists who do digitally native work traditionally ignored by the art world. X copy beeple.
00:24:55.624 - 00:26:07.702, Speaker A: And so it's interesting, I've never said that it will replace, I don't think it'll ever replace the art market, but one. But I think it actually, for me, NFTs, it's not so much, it's more of just a solution for digital artists, is how I would be framing this in my mind. But interesting distinction. I'm not so clear on this distinction between collectibles and art. In a sense, on a very primal, basic level, the way I approach this is what I call a radically unsnobby view, where, you know, put it this way. I wrote an essay in 2010, I think, saying, why is Andy Warhol worth like 50,000 times the amount of a Jasper Johns? And it was something like that. Maybe it was 17,000 times, or, sorry, why isn't Andy Warhol or a Jasper Johns painting worth 50,000 times the price of a Jack Kirby, the great Marvel comics artist, and Captain America before that, in the forties, Simon and Joe.
00:26:07.702 - 00:26:27.750, Speaker A: Simon and Jack Kirby. There was an old Captain America page that was, you know, going for a few hundred bucks. It didn't even sell at auction. And meanwhile, there was this Jasper Johns work. And I said, there's a disparity here, and it comes with what we bring to an artwork. Right? Like these assumptions. And so, again, I'm not.
00:26:27.750 - 00:27:02.214, Speaker A: So I find it harder to make that distinction. It's not as clear for me, let's say, between collectibles and art. But they're, you know, but you can, for the sake of practicality, you can make a distinction. I'm not denying that. Let's continue. The future value of an NFT made by a digitally native artist will be determined by the holistic career of that artist, not the collection itself. The future value of an NFT made by a digitally native artist will be determined by the holistic career of the artist, not the collection itself.
00:27:02.214 - 00:27:43.040, Speaker A: If you are buying something because of a historic narrative, it is either a collectible or you're diluting yourself. Yeah, very interesting. So basically, because this is something we've seen, you know, like, we look at the nat cat, I think, is that what it's called, the nguyen cat that we're looking at in macro media, which I think went for a fortune. For a fortune. And that artist has actually built a whole career, I think, you know, I think having done that work, which has become, you know, with the rainbow cat. So that's an interesting point. I generally agree with this, especially over time.
00:27:43.040 - 00:28:46.768, Speaker A: However, I would qualify it by saying there is a weird phenomenon in digital art where sometimes the piece in itself, if you kind of stumble on, if you're an artist and you can stumble on doing something great, and it can really stand out from the rest of your oeuvre, this happens, right? Or you put out something really great, and the market tends to not worry about the rest of your oeuvre, the rest of your works, and just say, hey, this work is special. Therefore, you know, we're going to pay a fortune for it anyway, even if the market's not really loving the rest of the artist's work. But nevertheless, I would generally agree with Rudy on this one, that the holistic career of the artist ultimately probably will be the main driver of value. I don't disagree. NFTs will not cycle pump the same way blockchains do. Art and technology are fundamentally different and don't accrue value in the same way. NFTs are closer to culture, and culture changes frequently.
00:28:46.768 - 00:29:17.534, Speaker A: The chains that capture the trading volume of digital collectibles will outperform 100%, 99.9% of the collectibles themselves. Today's most popular AI collections will not appreciate in value. I'm not exactly sure what Rudy is referring to here. AI collections is that artworks by AI artists that make a series, or is this referring to some kind of. I assume that's what it means. I don't know what else it would even refer to.
00:29:17.534 - 00:29:55.784, Speaker A: 99.9% of it is digital media masquerading as fine art. So again, I don't have as clear of distinctions in my head between, say, digital. Like, I would say a lot of AI art is fine art using digital media is how I would say, how I would frame it. So I think it's just a matter of what is your framework? I mean, this is part of the takeaway. This is why it's kind of interesting to read these comments. I think I have a different framework, but it's interesting to encounter other frameworks, because, of course, Rudy is thinking about these things.
00:29:55.784 - 00:30:25.494, Speaker A: That said, I do think some important AI artists will appear over the next decade, so I'm not exactly sure what Rudy is saying there. Squiggles are collectibles for generative art enthusiasts. So referring, I think, to the Squiggles series from a couple of years ago. Three years ago. Punks are also collectibles, not art, one assumes, referring to cryptopunks. I'm not sure about that. The cryptopunk series, like, I've heard someone compare it to a Picasso.
00:30:25.494 - 00:31:12.816, Speaker A: I think they're. I do think they're art. I think cryptopunks, like, when you really look at them closely and you look at the different series, you know, it's kind of back to this whole idea of, you know, what is the difference between art and design, right? And so. And it's kind of a murky thing, but the way I separate the two, as I always say, is art is underneath the umbrella of design. Again, we have the word stesigni, I think, in Italian. And dessein drawing, design is basically the visual organization of things, let's call it that. And art is a province, is a kind of visual organization of things.
00:31:12.816 - 00:31:42.564, Speaker A: So it goes underneath that umbrella. But I'd say it incorporates a poetic element, which ultimately, I would say is an irash. It uses irrational elements, it uses ambiguity. You know, that's what I'd start, you know, the qualities of poetry, so to speak. And I use poetry in quotes, poetic qualities. So the punks are quite, from a visual perspective, they're quite artfully done, is how I would put it. And so I'm not so quick to make that separation.
00:31:42.564 - 00:32:30.824, Speaker A: Let's continue. Autoglyphs have the best chance of being considered art because the creators never sold it off as intellectual property to Yuga. And I don't think, and I would just go further here. And of course, Rudy was saying most people aren't going to agree with me, is what he opened with here. I don't think this matters at all to whether something is art or not, who owns it. And maybe that's why Rudy doesn't see cryptopunks as art, because Yuga labs owns it, right? So it's a little too inside baseball, to a certain degree, from an art, from what I would call an art perspective, I don't care who owns it. That has no impact for me on whether a thing is what I'd consider poetic design.
00:32:30.824 - 00:32:56.664, Speaker A: So there is Rudy's polemic. We might call it P's. Collectibles are still valuable, but they operate on somewhat different principles and appeal to different types of collectors. P's I only post spicy. Takes once every solar eclipse. Don't expect more of these posts for me to argue back and forth in the comments. So, interesting provocation from Rudy Adler and Arty hands.
00:32:56.664 - 00:33:20.524, Speaker A: How are we doing? 32 minutes. Today's most popular collections will not appreciate in value. Again, I need more specifics here. And shout out to Artie. I don't know. Is that referring to PFP collections? Is that referring to art series? 100% of it is digital media masquerading as fine art. So perhaps responding to Rudy here.
00:33:20.524 - 00:33:41.704, Speaker A: Now, again, that said, I do think some important artists will appear over the next decade. I don't know if this could be a satire, for all I know, because it seems like a bit of a satire. It's a paste. Yeah. So this seems like a bit of a satire here. Today's most popular collections will appreciate in value 99%. Right.
00:33:41.704 - 00:34:08.644, Speaker A: So I think Artie is kind of sensing a little bit of what I am sensing here in the kind of. I don't want to call it. To call it inconsistencies is to overstate it. But there, I think Artie is sort of seeing some of the same tensions that I'm seeing here. I think, okay, through the weeds, we go back to Luke 500. Culturally relevant and economically accessible. This is why digital art is truly having its renaissance.
00:34:08.644 - 00:34:29.974, Speaker A: Interesting point. I get that this is very hard to understand for newbies. So what's the point? To buy a gif. Let me tell you why. To digitally own it and support its artists. Yeah. And at the end of the day, like, I think the reality is, again, if we use the simple definition, art is poetic design.
00:34:29.974 - 00:35:19.854, Speaker A: If we look at the debating point, one could argue, say, for someone that comes in and says, well, this is just video game pixel art. This isn't real art. This isn't the Mona Lisa. What we could argue is they're not understanding the poetry of the work, which is, okay, first of all, it is pixel art that's kind of interesting and fun. And then we have this meme, like, you know, pixelated cat that is dragging a rainbow behind it. And so we kind of have this delightful meme, and to a certain degree, we consider that art, you know, and there's nothing rational about a rainbow, you know, trail for a cat. Right? And then we have, again, this beautiful 50.
00:35:19.854 - 00:35:34.862, Speaker A: I believe it's 50 by 50 canvas here. So, you know, it's just. It's the je ne sais quoi. I don't know why I like it. I just do. But again, there's this kind of. There's an irrational component to this.
00:35:34.862 - 00:36:04.534, Speaker A: There is a poetry to it. There's the memography of cats. So it becomes culturally relevant. It was a meme, but it is beautiful. I mean, you look at the colors. If this wasn't beautiful, would we consider it art? I'm not sure we would. It's because it's actually incorporating all of these things, the pixel art memes, the younger generation that grew up with video games, what I call the second generation of digital art, putting all that together with this kind of.
00:36:04.534 - 00:36:26.900, Speaker A: To a certain degree, it does resist rationality. What is this rainbow that's coming from the cat? Right? Or that's in the trail of the cat that's going through the sky? Right. And look at this. And just finally on this, we've been talking about the dream, the digital artist's dream. Thank you. This is Chris, who I think is the creator of this work. Thank you.
00:36:26.900 - 00:36:57.292, Speaker A: It's my newest piece, over 31,000 minted. So I believe that's about $62,000, maybe more, because you get about $2 a mint on Zora. So how astonishing is that? So pretty interesting. So I don't know if this is the original. And let's look at this one. And then we'll quickly just go back to Luke's post here very quickly, because I'm curious if that's the same cat. Here it is.
00:36:57.292 - 00:37:16.288, Speaker A: Kind of looks like the same one, but maybe this was made recently. So. Okay, so we're all over the place here, so let's continue. Lorna Mills, this is transfer gallery, who has worked with Lorna Mills for years. Sold out. Lorna Mills, another major acquisition by Anon Collector. Foolish boy.
00:37:16.288 - 00:37:42.196, Speaker A: Transfer data Trust facilitated pre sale of yellow Whirlaway for $22,000 ahead of Lorna Mill's solo presentation at Future Fair, New York City. Token transferobject.com for provenance. So, if you remember from a few shows ago. Let me show you. So interesting. And this is, I think, how blockchain is going to work its way into the physical art world.
00:37:42.196 - 00:38:13.604, Speaker A: Let's see if this loads up. Remember this thing? Remember this work? And so I think this person bought the physical, as far as I understand. And then this here is the provenance. Okay. This is basically the proof of ownership, addition of two and one artist, proof of the four installation work. So you get a signed certificate of authenticity and an owner's rights and obligation. So Lorna Mills is a total professional.
00:38:13.604 - 00:38:28.080, Speaker A: Exhibition guidelines. So it's for the physical. Interestingly so interesting. Sale by Lorna Mills on object. Let's keep going here. Congrats to demon ego. You know, the world gets a little smaller here.
00:38:28.080 - 00:39:00.394, Speaker A: What Photoshop retweeted might work. So how awesome is that? Demon ego gets a retweet from Adobe Photoshop. How cool is that? Very cool. And this was sent to me by my friend Carl out of Munich. Card game developers says it paid an AI artist $90,000 to generate card art because no one comes close to the quality he delivers. And I just thought that was quite interesting. And these are the cards here, and they do look like, I think, very professional, and I actually wouldn't expect them to be AI.
00:39:00.394 - 00:39:56.470, Speaker A: So, which is kind of interesting for us to get this with a team of traditional artists, it would cost us a lot more money and time. So this is also something we've seen a little bit of, what I'm tempted to call the hybrid model where you incorporate AI into your work, but it's not necessarily the end all, be all or it's not raw AI. That's probably how AI is really going to get integrated into art outside of raw AI over time. So it says it spent $90,000 on card art, the entirety of which was paid to a single AI artist who received $15,000 per month, despite dedicating less than two full workdays to the project each month. So what this company is saying is they're getting this way faster and it's way better than doing it with a whole team of traditional artists. Pretty interesting. And here's.
00:39:56.470 - 00:40:14.854, Speaker A: Oh my God, I draw it. Or OMG, I draw it in New York City in Times Square here. So congrats to that. Been my dream since I was a kid to be on to see my work on Times Square. And last night it happened, so. Isn't that beautiful? I think I remember that area in Times Square. That's where everybody sits.
00:40:14.854 - 00:40:41.724, Speaker A: Exactly. I haven't been to New York for quite a while. Here, check out these works by mumble boy. These, these t shirts, they look pretty darn good, don't they? I made a new design for Suzer rich, the japanese good sites 10th anniversary sale. I picked recent NFTs, and Justin Boy, who is the sole owner, kindly gave me permission to use it. I think these are mumble boy works. It sure looks like it doesn't it? Look at that.
00:40:41.724 - 00:41:07.416, Speaker A: So pretty cool. Look at the bright yellow hoodie. They work, I would say, remarkably well as clothing. And we're kind of back to this idea of design and art, because in a sense, you could say it's a nice design for a t shirt, isn't it? Or for a hoodie. But of course it's art. Interesting. Those lines aren't very clear in my mind.
00:41:07.416 - 00:41:37.202, Speaker A: So, yeah, and it's a whole discussion. Look at this. Brilliant work by Martin Bruce. This gorgeously colored, very creative work by Martin Bruce. These snakes here, speaking of poetic, these flowers repeated, but not, you know, just a beautiful, beautiful work. Maybe some physical elements combined. And I think it says here, new one of one, anyone? I think this could do really well.
00:41:37.202 - 00:42:12.714, Speaker A: It is gorgeous. A gorgeous work for Martin Bruce. So, not posted yet, just on Twitter. Here, my friends, is the work I was telling you about, the curt hussle collective. Your current waiting time is estimated to be as long as you want. So awesome, awesome, Kurt. Also, club, please remember you are being charged ninety seven cents a minute.
00:42:12.714 - 00:42:47.150, Speaker A: Thank you for holding. This is what I want to see when I go to the galleries or to the museums in the video art, when I'm kind of, my eyes are tearing from boredom in the gallery. Sometimes I think of this, you know, works by Kurt Hussle collective. This would be such a hit, too, in those spaces. Thank you for holding. So just awesome. The music, it's hard to stop it.
00:42:47.150 - 00:42:57.038, Speaker A: Please hold forever. Forever. Forever. Okay. Awesome. That is only five tezos. That is only five tezos.
00:42:57.038 - 00:43:22.876, Speaker A: The curt hussle hold line, a new, wonderful commercial. Only six sold, which is a small crime against art. There are 23. Get it while you can. Evolution by Euxine. So I think this is on object one, as we see up here. I think it's the first time, if I'm not mistaken, that they're doing kind of like a solo show of sorts on object one.
00:43:22.876 - 00:43:54.124, Speaker A: So kind of a different spin on object one, because, of course, we're seeing curated shows before. And so here is one of the works by Euxine, who is getting more colorful. And there are interesting mushrooms over there. And look at these interesting patterns Euxine is continuing to do. And look at these almost like pixelated square brushes here. Interesting textures. Euxine continues to stretch.
00:43:54.124 - 00:44:12.714, Speaker A: Very interesting and interesting colors in the skeleton. Very interesting. A little bit more pink, I think, than usual. Evolution edition of one. So again, I think this is part of the drop. We have the immense pleasure to announce our next solo drop. I don't know if they did one before.
00:44:12.714 - 00:44:41.064, Speaker A: Evolution by Ukscene drop on Thursday, April 11, which is today for all the ukscene collectors. So check that out. That is on object one. And here I think this one might also be in it, but I'm not positive this one is clearly in it because we have object one there, so I'm not exactly sure. I guess we'll find out later today. So cool work there from oxine recollapse, capturing objects. Another interesting canvas here.
00:44:41.064 - 00:45:06.094, Speaker A: Someone at their drawing desk and interest with a nice, interestingly, with a nice landscape in the background. Maybe a self portrait. Unsure. And they're drawing this landscape interestingly. And here we see all the texture that we've seen before. I believe these are purely digital works. So kind of emulating brushstrokes, joy, vision.
00:45:06.094 - 00:45:20.694, Speaker A: Interestingly. And here's the palette. Let's take a close look there. So very interesting. Capturing objects. This is an edition of seven and a couple of offers coming in and not listed yet. Here's Bezaya, prince of Persia.
00:45:20.694 - 00:45:38.894, Speaker A: Farid Mohammed Rahimi. I'm not sure if this is a real person. Maybe it's a real soccer player. Not sure. Pretty cool portrait, though. Classic bezaya. And here's number ten, interestingly, on the prince of Persia with an Iran flag on the soccer jersey.
00:45:38.894 - 00:46:02.562, Speaker A: So maybe from Iran's soccer team. Interesting. And here is Flora Marquez as we go around the world here. New mint fashion beasts. Mia Lullaby. So 150 enjoy, 100 additions. So I'm not sure what enjoy is worth, but yes, I think remember when Zora, just like maybe a couple of weeks ago or three weeks ago, was saying you can use any crypto to sell your work.
00:46:02.562 - 00:46:32.320, Speaker A: So this is almost the result is now we're seeing, you know, these other cryptos come in, like enjoy, or you could start your own crypto, I think. Remember Axin was selling with his own crypto recently. So all very interesting. Beautiful work, as usual from Flora Marquez. Love the fashion Beast series. And this woman here with rabbit ears and kind of a wild kind of shirt here. Cool work, nub 1914, another landscape kind of work here.
00:46:32.320 - 00:47:00.998, Speaker A: So changing up the content a little bit in this beautiful sky and everything. Quite a large work. And here's the river with little ducks on it. And just quite a nice landscape. There's something quite gorgeous about this, isn't there? So loving the new direction from this very experimental style to now just doing kind of pastoral landscape situation. Parque one of one for tentezos. Pretty reasonable.
00:47:00.998 - 00:47:18.350, Speaker A: Here's ax stone. Not sure if this is new or not. Shinjuku versus Harajuku. And this is posted on x. So again, I'm not sure if this is new or not. That almost looks like a sampler there, doesn't it? And just a cool illustration. I don't see a ton of new work from axe stone.
00:47:18.350 - 00:47:40.596, Speaker A: It may be because I'm missing it on my feed. But a really cool illustrator and I think has work on super rare and just interesting work. Nice frame there, too. Not sure what that means. The comeback here is Morlakos. So another work in this series with this almost dystopian landscape. Kind of polluted landscape in the background.
00:47:40.596 - 00:48:09.486, Speaker A: And almost like a steampunk or Sci-Fi kind of dystopia thing going on here. I can't remember the name of that movie with Mel Gibson in 1980. But one of those, you know, in the early eighties. All to say kind of a, you know, a world without oil or something, or too much oil. The comeback. And this is Merlako's three tezos. Looks like it is unlisted or sold.
00:48:09.486 - 00:48:24.150, Speaker A: Others have been transferred. Interesting piece. And here is Jake. Where is Jake's Jake studios. So this is on Solana. Interestingly so. Very prolific and kind of a king Kong.
00:48:24.150 - 00:48:47.002, Speaker A: Let's see if it loads up. There we go. So here looks like Jake Studios is in a UFO and is attacking King Kong. Interesting portrayal of the building. Kind of a different, slightly different kind of style. Even the King Kong is slightly different from this normal illustrative style that we see. And here, the upside down pixelated clouds with the laser going up.
00:48:47.002 - 00:49:04.534, Speaker A: Just a nice composition. This is on Solana buy now edition of ten at 0.3, Sol. Here's Daniel W. Continuing the corporate bestiary series, the board. I quite like this one. I'm starting to really warm up to this series of this kind of satire of corporate.
00:49:04.534 - 00:49:20.262, Speaker A: Of the corporate world. Here's the board. I find that hilarious. And they're, of course, doing a lot of horror. Daniel W. So nice piece. And, you know, as I finished the Dante pixel art thing now I'm just working on the framing a little bit before I post that.
00:49:20.262 - 00:49:45.688, Speaker A: Hopefully before the halving. But as I work kind of from imagination, it makes me really appreciate, say, a work like this. This is, I would say, clearly from Daniel W's imagination. So all to say, and maybe that's obvious to everybody else, but it's a very nice composition. The board. Two colors, cyan and black. Fortezos edition of 18.
00:49:45.688 - 00:49:58.174, Speaker A: Here's a cool work in progress from limbo good morning. Work in progress. Video drone inspired piece is coming. And I follow limbo. That is a glitch on x. Quite a cool piece here. Look at this frame, too.
00:49:58.174 - 00:50:20.778, Speaker A: Very nice. And this person going into the tv with this beautiful kind of checkered floor. Nice, nice perspective. Cool image in the background. So more remember limbo was talking about Sci-Fi horror pixel art, I think was horror horror pixel art. Maybe this is a window into what we're going to see. This is quite interesting to Juan Pez.
00:50:20.778 - 00:50:44.604, Speaker A: This is just poked, posted on X. Just kind of a wild, surreal drawing here of a monster being cut open here and little guts coming out. And these bow and arrow, these hunters, maybe, and someone crying. Kind of wild work. I never did the translation, so I don't know what it says. Santiago ruau observing the events available on Zora. Very nice.
00:50:44.604 - 00:51:08.378, Speaker A: The gradient in the background, this blue gradient from darker blue to lighter blue, I think goes a long way. This really is a nice kind of touch. And I think that's a real. That is a. Yeah, it's not just my screen, is what I'm trying to say. A nice variation on the theme here, too, of these kind of abstract blobs, so to speak. Drawing, painting by Santiago Rao.
00:51:08.378 - 00:51:25.172, Speaker A: Nice piece that is on Zora. Fields of the goblin, a new work by Santiago. A new abstract. This one is square. And as you can see here, this one is pixelated. So very cool work. It'd be tempted, you know, I don't know.
00:51:25.172 - 00:51:51.488, Speaker A: Not every bitcoin isn't everybody's cup of tea, but it'd be interesting to just, you know, you could just sample, you know, maybe something a little bigger than this, but you could take just a little square here and you could put that on bitcoin pretty easily. Again, I'm not. Not everybody is into bitcoin for environmental reasons, so I don't know what the case is here. Anyways, it's a beautiful work. Nice piece. Three tazos and edition of 50. And already selling.
00:51:51.488 - 00:52:06.364, Speaker A: So transferred. Most of them have been transferred. So cool work there. And this was quite interesting, too. This is Gonz kind of has a bit of a. It's kind of like digital meets Gerhard Richter. It's almost like the squeegee Gerhard Richters, but stretched.
00:52:06.364 - 00:52:42.854, Speaker A: Interesting piece. Interesting. Again, it kind of reminiscent. It really evokes the squeegee paintings, but it's clearly digital and it's clearly a different technique. And this is Mac filling my dusty file collections on Zora with my experiments. The third one in the collection, so and of course I follow mech. And so interesting experiments by mech are now being minted on Zora, playing with the operating system tooling as subject matter, which is kind of interesting and just filling the canvas.
00:52:42.854 - 00:53:07.310, Speaker A: So creative as ever. So this is on Zora, and here's Ugo digi. And this is an edition of one that was picked up by Axin, who continues to collect and snipe interesting works here. This is 25 tezos. Nice piece. So in this new series, I believe it's graphics two that Hugo said Ugo is using. So cool work.
00:53:07.310 - 00:53:34.534, Speaker A: And again, just interesting. Kind of reminds you those almost those modular synthesizers playing with, you know, what seems to be like operating system graphics. So kind of a different, you know, variation on what we saw with mech there. Right there's the file, you know, icon and this beautiful gradient here. So very interesting graphics. Two by Ugo DigI edition of one for only 25 tezos. And here's another one.
00:53:34.534 - 00:54:03.624, Speaker A: This is also an edition of one. And this sold Caddipo 2 hours ago. So what's cool about this series is you could probably make a thousand of these in different variations and just change up the gradient. Just, you know, here we have red, green, blue. That's very cool, you know, wiring perhaps going through everything. Very cool. Inspired by vintage software and early game design, each piece of the analog factory is released with a special sale system.
00:54:03.624 - 00:54:29.464, Speaker A: For every purchase, a new piece is unlocked. Very cool. And look at this braindead with a very cool one of one. The longest distance between two files. An edgy composition went for 50 tezos. And of course, as you see files being copied over the classic kind of imagery here, but stretching it way over between folders. The longest distance between two files.
00:54:29.464 - 00:55:03.804, Speaker A: Nice sale. Continuing on element Li with a cool work here. Also adding color and a very strange kind of work where the car almost is pulling a building, but hard to say, it's almost like a surreal car getting very loose in what's going on here. Auto Tower remake 250 by 250. I like this remake idea too. This idea of remaking works is quite a fun idea too. And you also gotta love how the coloring isn't worrying about being perfectly inside, it gives it a painterly quality.
00:55:03.804 - 00:55:27.298, Speaker A: Just interesting work. Here's Anis Abdin, day 99 turbo. Very cool work. And this is on instagram. Very nice. I wish I could magnify more. And of course I keep seeing GiF artists posting both the animated and the still version of the work, which I find super interesting.
00:55:27.298 - 00:55:48.082, Speaker A: So that's day 99 and continuing on, here's another work by Annas Abdin, kind of a nature work. This is called breeze day number 100. And here is the static version. And you see the difference that motion brings to a lot of these works. Here's a cool one by godlike. Never heard of godlike before. Black and the cursed sun.
00:55:48.082 - 00:56:02.950, Speaker A: Lamb of God. So maybe a reference to the eclipse for those that saw it. Saw some incredible images online. For those in North America, la Isla de Taylor. So the Taylor Island. Tierra a lalo Lejos. This is Kappin.
00:56:02.950 - 00:56:24.834, Speaker A: So a new landscape by Kappn. We haven't seen one for a while. A shimmering landscape with what looks like some maybe generative art in the background. Not positive on that. Or just something that is cycling to get that shimmering effect. And there it looks like a monster, doesn't it? That looks like a little monster in the foreground. I don't speak Spanish.
00:56:24.834 - 00:56:51.864, Speaker A: This edition of 20 for ten tezos, there are ten left. Very cool. Here's another one by Kappn and using a different software, I think just an animated abstract. And here's one by popple. Kind of an unusual piece for popple. Glitch base, 1000 degen bits. So I think this is selling for bass on Zora, if I'm not mistaken.
00:56:51.864 - 00:57:16.794, Speaker A: So a cool abstract here from popple animated abstract, coded in processing. Three, then degenized. Popple 2024 1000 degen bits burning and running towards each other. So interesting work there. This is, I think the name is Webgirl, and maybe the artist is Muri Pixel, if I'm not mistaken. It is. And this is on foundation.
00:57:16.794 - 00:57:43.458, Speaker A: Pretty rad. You know, works like this. Again, when you see, when you're looking at works and looking at works and looking at works, all of a sudden something totally different, like, is it Murray girl? Murie girl? Work like this comes out and you just go, this is interesting. This is so different. Just a really interesting canvas, as I like to put it, 0.01 eth. And this is on base, on foundation.
00:57:43.458 - 00:58:27.004, Speaker A: So a lot of people are using base. Interestingly, base is really. Now, it's kind of interesting just from a. I don't want to spend too long on this, but just from a intellectual property point of view, I mean, I think they just copied, you know, arbitrum or forked optimism or arbitrum, and then all of a sudden, they're bigger than them with their version because they're coinbase. You know what it reminds me of? And you could say, oh, well, that's just the ethos of crypto, Adrian, like, what's your problem on that? And I don't necessarily have a problem with it, but it does raise questions. You know what else it reminds me of? Chrome. Chrome is basically what you'd say in Cryptoland is a fork or a copy of the code of Mozilla Firefox, which I believe was open source.
00:58:27.004 - 00:58:59.468, Speaker A: Chrome copies it. Okay, fine. Now Chrome has their thing, and some people will still use Firefox. All is fine, I guess. But now, if I went to use Firefox and I went to add a plugin on Firefox, and it's like, sorry, you can only get that plugin for the chrome store. So now you see Google edging after, you know, the generosity of Firefox, you know, sharing their code with the world. Now Chrome is taking that code and then saying, nobody else is allowed in here.
00:58:59.468 - 00:59:40.994, Speaker A: If you have a plugin, it only works on chrome. You can't use it with Firefox. And so all to say, the ideal of, you know, everything is free intellectual property. Put it this way, because I'm sympathetic to a certain degree, I think a lot of these lawsuits, and I use a lot of appropriation in my work. I like fair use. I think it's actually a really good law that they had until recently with the Warhol issue that the judge ruled against Warhol foundation. But ultimately, I think fair use actually threaded the needle of this very precarious issue, because I would argue, intellectual property is there for a reason.
00:59:40.994 - 01:00:08.380, Speaker A: Right? It came out of necessity because, you know, again, because you see interesting situations like that. Like, I wonder, I don't know who they forked optimism, if base forked optimism or arbitrum, but I wonder, like, surely at some level they're kind of unhappy about that. One imagines maybe they're cool, maybe they're just like, hey, that's fine. And, and that's fine. So I just think it brings up interesting questions. Let's continue here. We've been doing well with the length of the shows.
01:00:08.380 - 01:00:37.404, Speaker A: Glitchy Kaku, kind of in the same spirit of Marie girl. I mean, you could hang them in the same room, I thought, isn't that interesting? It's glitched out. Check out comfy like a fox below. So this is actually the artist Png tuber, enjoyer of vtubers, retro games, pixel art, and crts. So I assume. And there's sound here, too. Pretty wild, actually.
01:00:37.404 - 01:01:21.010, Speaker A: Kind of video game esque. Right? Again, this, you know, a generation that grew up with video games, this is their art I would argue, you know, and even the glitching of the screen, this is from a generation where that's what they were dealing with. Or even the glitched roms. Okay, it's like Nintendo roms that they were. They used, but also they've actually seen the screens go wild like that. Remember Sky Goodman watching the World cup? And then the tv basically froze, and. And there's sky saying and thinking, that's pretty cool, and then changed the direction of Skye's whole creative output.
01:01:21.010 - 01:01:46.134, Speaker A: I think it was a poet before, if I'm not mistaken, on the story. Sky will be on the spaces at some point when the schedule frees up a bit for Skye. So we'll ask more about that. Let's continue here. Haiti Rockette, I'm pleased to say, is back on the scene with this wonderful gif here. And there's dead spelled out in skulls. So edition of 369 for 13 tezos each.
01:01:46.134 - 01:02:09.750, Speaker A: And here's another one. Top stuff. And this is also an edition of 369, so maybe just minted and still available for 13 tezos. So interesting and great to see Haiti rocket back. Tetris. This is by Chaz. How have we not seen Tetris yet? Just a cool to start screen of Tetris.
01:02:09.750 - 01:02:28.056, Speaker A: And there the keyboard is even being pressed, which is pretty cool. And there is almost, like, tetris in the background or on the side of the computer here, which is interesting. Attack of the tetraminos. And this is, I believe this is new. Yeah. Two tezos edition of ten. Cool work.
01:02:28.056 - 01:02:39.680, Speaker A: Here's a Nintendo glitch. Rom glitch. Town arcade. Running too fast. So interesting. Just a little bit of action here of this character running. And that is $0.99
01:02:39.680 - 01:02:58.254, Speaker A: edition of 20. And here's Silva Santus assault. And also a figure running, I think, over here. And you can see almost like a horse that is being cut off here, and the landscape in the background almost separating from the figures. Pretty interesting piece. Intense. Very intense.
01:02:58.254 - 01:03:17.978, Speaker A: Let's continue. Kodonakizono continuousness. Kind of going with a little more dithering. Interestingly, this is a collaboration between Anya Asano and Koto Nakazono. Excuse me. Available on object.com. i don't think we've seen this one before.
01:03:17.978 - 01:03:37.854, Speaker A: Pretty cool work. I like the pixelation. And here's another one. Continuum number 198. Again, codenak with Anya Asano. So interesting to bring in collaboration this far into the series. And as you see here, pretty wild kind of combination of what looks like CGI and pixelation.
01:03:37.854 - 01:04:01.436, Speaker A: Continuing on, Gogolitis is going to be on Zora. It's going to be interesting to see how well this does. So kind of an animated abstract work here. Unless this is just a close up reveal, this is just a small part of it. So a little teaser here from gogolitis. And here is Dave, also known as bees on Twitter. 61,000 views so far.
01:04:01.436 - 01:04:30.024, Speaker A: And another cool animated abstract. And again, 60,000 views. That's pretty impressive. Here's acid boy with a pretty cool work. Kind of a different, kind of folding into itself, kind of a different play on quite again, kind of a mind trick here from acid boy. What are we at? 3000 views, quite a few retweets and likes. GM from acidboy from the studios of acidboy.
01:04:30.024 - 01:05:10.908, Speaker A: Continuing on, psycho futurist. Not completely jaded to human experience. Okay, great textures here in these, kind of gradated, these gradient colors and just, you know, we saw that in the community with all the symbols here you see an eclipse and a triangle and someone on their computer plugging in a pretty interesting edition of ten for 15 tezos on secondary, selling out at four tezos. Nice work. And here's Rannic steer with a cool work. I think this is a collaboration with Kiro as well, so maybe this is a close up. Interestingly so.
01:05:10.908 - 01:05:30.764, Speaker A: GM from rannixteer. And here is Kiro. And Kiro was saying you can look somewhere over here to see if it is a collaboration or not. Split. So. Still working it out here, guys. So this, I think is a new one, if I'm not mistaken, from Curo.
01:05:30.764 - 01:05:53.716, Speaker A: Almost like a real painting in the background there, but completely glitched out with a painting over top. Cool work. 0.01 eth. Again on base that is on foundation. Here's Klaus, composition number 189. Nice rainbow colors here as Klaus verges on 200 interesting textures and everything you can see.
01:05:53.716 - 01:06:12.984, Speaker A: My mouse scroll is starting to move, so I should wrap this up so I don't get a crash sion. Caving wild with a very nice abstract here. I can hear my computer starting to complain. Renki tacho. Cool. All red with a little bit of white here. Here's another one.
01:06:12.984 - 01:06:38.804, Speaker A: So Renki, keeping things very interesting, usually one of ones. And here's Aider Nanoti. Just a small loop of a fish. Very interesting piece. And you almost see like this periscope like framing device. Little fish edition of seven two tazos. And here is wok.
01:06:38.804 - 01:06:53.734, Speaker A: Super silver haze. I'm really enjoying the color in this series. The exploration of color by walk. It's a great series. Two tezos, one of one. Here's human boy with that landscape. Very interesting landscape.
01:06:53.734 - 01:07:09.822, Speaker A: Cool experimentation, I think. Often uses gimp for the texture, if I'm not mistaken. Cool kind of selection there, too. And continuing on, here's Mikael. Most recent work in progress. Feels like something being ripped apart. It is quite something.
01:07:09.822 - 01:07:32.006, Speaker A: I mean, it's almost CGI meets abstract painting, right? It's pretty impressive. And here is Sarah Kretschmer. Good morning. So also doing experiments with these kind of islands in the sky, almost like brushstrokes here and trees. And here's another one, GM. So posting the experiments here on X. Pretty cool.
01:07:32.006 - 01:07:48.944, Speaker A: Very interesting from Sarah. And here's Zach. Discover pure joy on Zora by labisha. So this is labisha. And it's very interesting when you look at this large. We will try and load it without crashing. Look at this.
01:07:48.944 - 01:08:01.012, Speaker A: I assume this is AI. It's so complex. It is so complex. I assume it's AI. Quite interesting. Like just different. Continuing on here is lily illo.
01:08:01.012 - 01:08:16.446, Speaker A: Good morning. Little marks and notations to new forms. So another very cool blueprint here. Working with the chairs. This chair that is almost falling apart. AI is based to the left facing profile of chair portraits. This research outcome is not something I went looking for.
01:08:16.446 - 01:08:35.337, Speaker A: It happened in the doing, which is a very important point and almost brings about Denise Sanchez's comment from the very beginning. The spontaneity of working and not knowing where it's going. But it is a surprise attack on the heart. And I love to notice this in the process of making with these tools. Great comment from Lily. Illogical. And here's one more from Lilly.
01:08:35.337 - 01:09:09.954, Speaker A: This figure that is falling apart, almost beautiful. So I thought this was interesting. Referring to the design versus art weekly illustration for business Week on the agenda section. So, Zoe Kim, we've been looking at as art. Turns out it's like the illustrator for business Week. And it just goes to show, you know, okay, I guess we'd say this is like a design, but if someone made a painting like this, would you know that it's not an art piece and it's actually, well, this is just a design piece for, you know, business Week. I think it just shows.
01:09:09.954 - 01:09:44.394, Speaker A: It's not a clear distinction, is it even here? This was for March Madness, the basketball season, but this was just an illustration for a magazine. But if someone made this as an art piece, you'd say pretty cool, right? So to me, it just goes to show it's fuzzy lines. But this overlap between design and art is very fuzzy, right. I think that's a very concrete example. Very interesting piece here by Haribo or by Ochia Shohai. Haribo. Beautiful drawing here.
01:09:44.394 - 01:10:06.704, Speaker A: And then spray painted over top. Of course, the gummy bears are famous here in Germany. And here's Adelberger, the two ways of life. So another really interesting work here, which seems to hold up quite well on closer inspection. Look at how great that looks from far away, too. Another cool painting, Gwal Gwagan. Air quality.
01:10:06.704 - 01:10:31.514, Speaker A: I thought this was a very interesting painting with the Esso sign there. We've seen this artist before. I think it's logi. It's official doing textiles and beautifully done here. Kind of separated flowers, making it look very easy and then walled off, as you can see here, with this little string. So nature being constricted. Interestingly, here's Mark Belden, main door.
01:10:31.514 - 01:10:45.974, Speaker A: Very nice work here. Kind of looks like a european apartment building. Awesome color. That gouache on St. Armand paper is gorgeous. Here's Cape Mary, opening tonight in New York City. So Cape Mary is going somewhere here.
01:10:45.974 - 01:11:02.744, Speaker A: One of the paintings from my upcoming solo show. It's great to follow people for a long time and you watch them actually blossom, watching their career kind of take off. Beautiful work. Here's Bondozo Bandido. Please don't make me hug you. I think this is a great contrast. This is a very edgy artist.
01:11:02.744 - 01:11:32.470, Speaker A: This is not easy to do, because if you imagine doing this, you'd say, this surely is not going to work, but it kind of works amazingly. And a couple of others. Is it an illustration? Is it art? Is it both? Albion works. So very nice piece here. And also here is a city, this one, this time in violet, kind of nice and non finito in the sky there. Or textured, shall we say. And here is walk with a couple more emojis.
01:11:32.470 - 01:11:48.760, Speaker A: Emojis are art. And of course, I follow the great walk. Beautiful work here. Probably going to be on eBay at some point soon. Thank you for joining me again, and I hope you enjoy the spaces. I hope you join me on the spaces later today. If not, it will be recorded and available on my feed.
01:11:48.760 - 01:11:50.604, Speaker A: Until next time, take care.
