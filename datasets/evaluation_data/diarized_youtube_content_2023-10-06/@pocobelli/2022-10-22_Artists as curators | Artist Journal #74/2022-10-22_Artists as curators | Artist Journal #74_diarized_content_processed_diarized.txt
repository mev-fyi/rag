00:00:02.480 - 00:00:39.230, Speaker A: Well, if you think you've seen it all, I encourage you to watch this program. I continue to be amazed by the depth of the talent in this digital art world we inhabit. So welcome once again. October 22, 2022 Berlin. My name is Adrian Pokebelli, your ever impressed artist reporter, which has special significance. This is not a news program that's gonna turn into a t shirt, I think at some point here. Welcome back.
00:00:39.230 - 00:00:59.864, Speaker A: Thank you for the wonderful comments on Twitter. Just a lot of. Just more positivity that I am vibing off of. So I totally appreciate this. I found this work via Limbo's collection. And limbo, his collection is super impressive. Okay.
00:00:59.864 - 00:01:32.668, Speaker A: And I haven't talked really about almost anybody's collections, but it's almost, in a weird way, this is almost a part two of last episode. We were talking about the philosophy of collecting, which hen collector had put out that piece. And now I. I don't know how I saw it. I just went to two or three collections and then a couple of more artists. Next strange thing. And Limbo posted other works they were collecting, and I found this, which is awesome, edition of ten.
00:01:32.668 - 00:01:47.984, Speaker A: There's still one left. 1.88. And I should stop this because YouTube tends to make it pretty blurry. There's one left. I picked one up. Don't take my child away by Mason III. So just a sensational work here.
00:01:47.984 - 00:02:19.692, Speaker A: Looks like in my universe, it looks like a bit of a breakthrough work. That pixelation on the side there is. And the video game, turning video games into art like that. So super interesting artist. I've just begun exploring that artist found this morning, as usual. So before we continue with some other treasures from Limbo's collection from the last week, let's just take a quick look. So this is the trailer for Art Basel.
00:02:19.692 - 00:02:36.038, Speaker A: So just a quick. This is put out. So I like to look at stuff with the sound down. That's a ballard trick. Watch tv with the sound down because sometimes it gives you a clearer sight of what's going on. But anyways, you see the Eiffel Tower there. I guess the really.
00:02:36.038 - 00:02:51.114, Speaker A: I guess the reason I wanted to show this is look at what Tezos is up to here. It looks pretty impressive. This is with FX hash. And so anyways, they're pulling all the stops. I think they understand. Oh, yeah. And you can hear, like, the promo music.
00:02:51.114 - 00:03:18.014, Speaker A: I think they understand that the NFT scene on Tezos is their ticket to ride. So they're very, very smart to work with art Basel like this. And look at Zancane. We've looked at Zancan's work before. So here is some of the work we've looked before at Art Basel. And I discovered also, this is generative art. I don't see it here.
00:03:18.014 - 00:03:48.954, Speaker A: Gm from Zancane, end of London Minitrip, had a nice NFT display in the bank background. I traded mini guy Mimi for a funny guy's NFT to bring to Paris art basils. Okay, who's in Paris? So, anyways, we recognize this artist. I believe this is Zancan continuing on. Just a couple more people. This is FX hash. Seeing people connect with the live minting experience here at Art Basel is truly special.
00:03:48.954 - 00:04:14.780, Speaker A: When generative art comes alive in physical spaces and enables us all to gather, magic happens. So, again, this is generative art. A lot of what we're seeing here at the Tezos booth at Art Basel. So, Zancane, that's how I connected the dots on that work there. Give Arthropo some support here. I do consult with them a little bit. I don't know.
00:04:14.780 - 00:04:48.872, Speaker A: Money? I don't want any money, and don't take any money or anything, but I've just been giving them my opinion, as you know, I love to do here. And so, yeah, so they have a dystopia thing. So, anyways, keep reminding ourselves and everyone that it's a marathon and not a sprint. And dystopia and Ruralia, still available to mint, Mintarthropo, XYZ. So, anyways, they're putting in a ton of work here. So, anyways, give them a follow, give them a, like, give them a retweet, and they will be grateful. So, limbo.
00:04:48.872 - 00:05:18.870, Speaker A: Let's go back to Limbo's collection here. Some of the pieces I've been scooping up on tezos recently, featuring work by a bunch of artists, 100% cult. And so you can see. And we love that kappan work. And, of course, this is, again, so this is where I discovered Mason III, tradscape, everything. So, anyways, we've seen some of these artists before, but this I've never seen before. And so let's just quickly.
00:05:18.870 - 00:05:35.114, Speaker A: So, these are some works I discovered in Limbo's collection from, like, the last week. So this is October 8. Really cool work here. Edition of ten. I don't know if I got the last one. I just picked this up. There's either one left, or I got the last one, but just a very cool work here.
00:05:35.114 - 00:06:04.152, Speaker A: Tazo's 50, so a nice eye. Another great work. This is from June 21, but nevertheless, just an awesome work. I believe it was in Limbo's collection that I found this. I just started digging and I was like, wow, there is some fantastic work here. So Limbo's got really interesting taste. This is by Kikilo, and this is one of the more recent ones from October 14.
00:06:04.152 - 00:06:28.952, Speaker A: This is sold out, edition of 25 and just kind of fits our. I don't know if it's japanese or not, but kind of our, you know, japanese pop, I want to call it. Maybe it's a different language. I assume it's Japanese. And we're going to see some more of that. So again, kind of like Adelia's work. And then this other artist that we recently discovered who also has a new work, who we're going to see here, another work by Helleni three.
00:06:28.952 - 00:06:57.074, Speaker A: So that last one was by Helleni three. So again, just really interesting. You can buy this one for five tezos, and you can see a small version, almost like it's an album cover or something. Seems like one of these, like, virtual pop stars or something. Kirakira is the most popular idol in the world. So again, maybe everybody else knows more about this than I do. Another work from Limbo's collection, yucca ice cream buy for three.
00:06:57.074 - 00:07:23.320, Speaker A: So we're going to look at a few works that I was discovering in people's collection and just on twitter that people retweeted. So again, just kind of really interesting work here. This is a genre, like, I don't really know too much about. Like, the anime. Like, I read manga and anime as a teenager, just as one of the many comics that I would read. But again, I'm not, like, I won't call myself at all an expert. So I'm just kind of happily discovering this.
00:07:23.320 - 00:07:47.252, Speaker A: Ibea riffin another work from Limbo's collection. Just really, really interesting work here. I believe this is sold out. Edition of ten was selling for seven. And, yeah, sold out a couple of days ago. Look at this. So again, I think this is the final work by limbo, but I gotta say, like, limbo can curate.
00:07:47.252 - 00:08:21.812, Speaker A: Okay, this is my point. Check this out. So this is by. Check this out. So just really, really, really nicely put together. Like, I guess I'd call this cyberpunk. Again, you get, like, the asian writing.
00:08:21.812 - 00:08:48.644, Speaker A: So anyways, just super cool. And you got to see this other work by atmo, I think. So here's Atmonez's work. Motion designer. And then I loaded up this one. Check this out. Like, whoa, wow.
00:08:48.644 - 00:09:06.204, Speaker A: Whoa. I hope that, like, this should be at Ark mazel. Like, this would blow everyone's mind. It'd blow my mind. I'd be like, holy jeez. Like, wow. I could just leave that looping on 45 tezos.
00:09:06.204 - 00:09:19.310, Speaker A: Wow. Zetdao technical problem solving department. Always working to the last drop of fuel. Don't try to escape. Stay safe. So a bit of a cyberpunk vibe there. So pretty cool.
00:09:19.310 - 00:09:45.178, Speaker A: This one was a work tweeted by Sky Goodman, and only a tezos still available, I believe I picked one up. There's still ten here. Check this out. Won tazos. Like, wow. Like, you know, the. It's like a cascading waterfall, like, or it's like a dam bursting.
00:09:45.178 - 00:10:07.854, Speaker A: The amount of talent here, you would think. Whenever you think you've seen it all, there's like, ten x. More like, that's kind of what's going on here. So another just super cool work. Cello. Cello. Just, you know, another artist I just don't know anything about, but I'm happy to follow.
00:10:07.854 - 00:10:41.642, Speaker A: So just very, very cool. Oh, a cellist. Cellist composer, producer, NFT creator. You know, this brings up another kind of really interesting issue, which is how many people are kind of getting into digital art and NFTs who are maybe not traditional artists, like, in the sense, like working out a painting or working digital for the last 20 years or whatever. I find it really interesting. You know, you get, like, creative directors because you can do that with digital. It's not like you need to be a brilliant oil painter.
00:10:41.642 - 00:11:16.254, Speaker A: You know what I mean? Like, if you have some tools and some ideas and an open mind, there's a lot of open minded people who will happily collect this continuing on. So, Elie Lo, remember this crazy artist? This looks like a burguin or something. This looks like a crazy Sci-Fi club, kind of risque here. Cover your eyes. You can almost hear the bass drum in the background. Look at this. The talent, guys, the quality of the artworks.
00:11:16.254 - 00:11:34.494, Speaker A: So anyway, yeah, 50 tezos cents. So another awesome work by Elie Lope. Look at this. Axin put it on the market for 333 tezos. This work, survival guide. It's beautiful. Interesting work with a diskette.
00:11:34.494 - 00:12:00.930, Speaker A: You know, just super original as usual. One of. One sold within ten minutes. Okay, so 333 tezos. So axin is really, you know, on a roll, like, creatively and from a market perspective. Look at the skull on the diskette. Creativity is just flowing out of axing here.
00:12:00.930 - 00:12:19.706, Speaker A: So, yeah, you can read that on your own. So this is also. So remember the Adelia type, kind of Sci-Fi anime manga artist. Now, the last one was, I was going to say was animated. Looks like this one is too. And it just wasn't loading before already. 1.4
00:12:19.706 - 00:12:49.942, Speaker A: ETH. The artist is Ardhura Putra. Here we go. So let me see if I can make this bigger. So, you know, again, just kind of like kind of similar to Adelia, but much more Sci-Fi and even more hardcore kind of japanese pop in a weird sort of way, for lack of better term. Again, I'm not an expert in these things, but just a really, really nice work here. So again, that is Ardhira at 1.4
00:12:49.942 - 00:12:59.994, Speaker A: ETH. 4 hours to go. Do we have a history here? Not really. Okay. Oh, here we go. Yeah. So a few bids.
00:12:59.994 - 00:13:37.314, Speaker A: You know, so different wallets. One 1.251.4. Now, just so you know what's out there, too, here's alien queen, also on super rare current offer, $14,000 for the thinker. So a tip of the hat to Auguste Rodin. And we can actually bring that up because I'm sure you all know that one of the most famous statues in history and alien queen often has these basically super psychedelic illustrations. Sorry, we had that cut off a little bit. And so let's just look listed yesterday at 04:00 p.m.
00:13:37.314 - 00:14:00.494, Speaker A: And it is already at 11.2 ETH. So when the devil comes knocking on your door, it's hard not to let him in. So the thinker Auguste Rodin. It's been a while since I've looked at this. So one of the most famous statues you're ever gonna see. It's interesting.
00:14:00.494 - 00:14:46.942, Speaker A: I mean, this was made when Le Penseur the thinker in French, 1904 at the Musee Rodin in Paris. The work depicts a nude male figure of heroic size sitting on a rock. The pose is one of deep thought and contemplation, and the statue is often used as an image to represent philosophy. Rodin conceived the figure as part of his work, the Gates of Hell, commissioned in 1880, but the first was made in 1904 and now at Musee Rodin in Paris. So if you're in Paris, you can also check that out. Ratcloak was referencing a new collector. A non gentleman is reaping many grails from secondary by myth.
00:14:46.942 - 00:15:15.194, Speaker A: Sum bazaya die with the most likes working class gloom tube. Take a look at this collection. So here is the collection. And so a lot of our, you know, favorites here die with the most likes myths. What I wanted to show here, because in a sense, this is nothing too new. A lot of people like these artists, right? But a new collector and I think that's what rat cloak was pointing out. This goes back twelve days.
00:15:15.194 - 00:15:45.834, Speaker A: Okay, so this, you know, this is how fast things can happen here. This wallet was started, started collecting twelve days ago. So I think that's significant and is spending a lot of money from the looks of it. Okay, so interesting new work by myth. Now, this is called, I believe, Uncle Joseph. At first, this wasn't appearing on object. Object was having issues this morning, but it was minted on tea.
00:15:45.834 - 00:16:30.274, Speaker A: I wonder if this is like supposed to be purple drink or something with the purple mask. I have no idea, as usual, what the references are, but the colors are, are awesome creativity with a darker blue sky and, you know, love the orange going with, you know, almost a Halloween flavor here with the black and the orange, the black cap and the orange hoodie. And then of course, some myth's trademark colors sneak in there and it's, I don't know who Uncle Joseph is, but I was like, is that purple drank? Continuing on. Strange thing, sharing his collection, you know, and this is for an event that I hadn't heard of. Tez girls. Tez Girls is all over the world. Woman NFT artists community October 21 23rd.
00:16:30.274 - 00:17:02.546, Speaker A: So this weekend list 100 of 100 editions for one tezos. And so here are a few. And of course we see Varya, one of our favorite AI artists. And also, who is this grandma's favorite earring, maybe by Tromfimomacado complex by Petra voice. And let's get that first one here. And the soul by moonchild Tamu. This was in Hades collection.
00:17:02.546 - 00:17:42.124, Speaker A: And I was just checking at his, seeing if there's any new work. And I was like, oh, what's he up to? And actually it was also because this work was going around. He retweeted this work, a very nice pixel work. And then, so I went to his collection and we'll go to that work in a second here and found this. Check this out. So forgive the Internet here, folks, but you get the picture. Just a very, very, very fun work.
00:17:42.124 - 00:17:58.624, Speaker A: I love it. Computer in the grass. And so this is by be a stereotype. Buy for three. So I don't think I've picked this up. Yeah, I might need to pick that one up. Bookmark that guy.
00:17:58.624 - 00:18:20.638, Speaker A: And continuing on. And this is by someone whose name I don't know, but maybe if you go to their twitter, but I don't know what their twitter is. But anyways, a really cool work. Home world memories, zero. One warm time and so just a cool. Looks like a wheat field and city. So kind of surreal.
00:18:20.638 - 00:18:37.314, Speaker A: A little bit. Not quite sure what's going on here, but just a cool work. And I looked at their page. They have some nice pixel work, but it was actually what I found on page one, which I loved. I had to pick that up. That was three tazos. Just an old cell phone.
00:18:37.314 - 00:18:56.836, Speaker A: So just a really, really nice pixel work. So just doing a bit of digging today. Hello, Slider. Back to the times when phones was cool. And continuing on, a new work by Kristen Roose. This is an edition of 100, and you can buy for five. So let's see if we can make that bigger.
00:18:56.836 - 00:19:11.196, Speaker A: I guess that's what we got. So there you go. A really cool pixel artist. I think we. I don't know if he'd actually like to be called a pixel artist, but a really cool artist does pixel work. Here's some more pixel art. This one was fantastic.
00:19:11.196 - 00:19:34.698, Speaker A: I don't know if you can buy Morley's work, but you can look that up yourself. But this is a beautiful work, in my opinion. I just love the subject matter and the treatment and just everything. More pixel art from Michael Macasso or Mech TXT. Again, I love the colors. And this guy is just putting out tons of work. Quick warm up doesn't.
00:19:34.698 - 00:19:58.904, Speaker A: He can mint all this stuff and he doesn't gm. I don't know why I love to draw landscapes so much. Most will say that it's boring. It sure isn't. But for me, they kept me sane and honest. I keep coming back to this contrast between digital pixels and organic curvilinear nature. It's kind of a classic theme that you might even.
00:19:58.904 - 00:20:29.304, Speaker A: We're talking about the persistence of memory in that rectangle coming off the beach. The contrast of rectilinear forms with curvilinear forms. In a sense, with nature, we get that contrast of kind of organic curvilinear forms with pixelated rectilinear forms. So just a strong contrast. So that's why I think pixelated nature works so well. So not boring at all. That's why I keep showing it every day.
00:20:29.304 - 00:20:48.236, Speaker A: A work by Puro Mae showing the vanguard gang. So I just thought this was kind of cool. This looks like more lackos and maybe geeks in here. Is that kappa? I'm not sure who everybody is. Is that strange thing maybe? I'm not sure. So, anyway, you guys can figure that one out. Here we go.
00:20:48.236 - 00:21:19.586, Speaker A: Kappa, sage, los morlacos, ilojo, and la flor. And motem t three, Vanguard gang. And continuing on, remember the person who we were looking at, the Mickey Mouse and I think there was a bugs bunny. And I just saw another work by Nelta. And this looks physical, I'm not sure what it is, but I just think they do what they do very well. And I think this actually looks chinese, is actually what this looks like. Like those chinese dragon figures.
00:21:19.586 - 00:21:48.296, Speaker A: So again, not an expert. Gora has a new piece, not cheap, but Gora's a pretty good artist. So I don't know if any have sold yet. This just came on the market. So for eight tezos, but only an edition of ten. And yeah, Gora is just a very interesting one of these very original artists. Okay, like again, if Gora didn't make this, nobody would have made this.
00:21:48.296 - 00:22:12.104, Speaker A: So, yeah, so just a cool work. Sentries, delusion, cool color. Very interesting choices here all round. Tons of creativity in this. Moving on to AI twins by Soliev. I'm not sure if we've looked at Soliev's work yet, but this is going for auction. It's already at 70 tezos and there have been two bids.
00:22:12.104 - 00:22:39.106, Speaker A: And yeah, you got 5 hours and 55 minutes. So by the time you watch this you still might be able to put in a bid also. So Charles AI, I think this is the person that was doing the super large windows. Just a really beautiful work here. And sold another piece collected by an anonymous collector. Thank you so much. So very nice, AI art from my perspective, just something about it.
00:22:39.106 - 00:23:03.244, Speaker A: I love the colors and I love that floor. And again, just the weird ceilings. Just beautiful work. And this the Ouda museum pointed out. And I really like the color solutions and ideas and works by Neville Glover. And I agree, I think this is also a nice work. So nice shout out there, Uda of Neville Glover.
00:23:03.244 - 00:23:34.080, Speaker A: So again, just kind of a weird surrealist kind of work here with a touch of Sci-Fi in it. Mother Louisiane has sold a work to clownvamp, another AI work here. And they seem to be getting more abstract with mother Louisiane. I mean kind of a lot of abstract shapes and textures with chairs and tables and. Looks like some water, but it's not. Thanks a lot dear clownvamp and ghostbaby Tez for collecting my new pieces from the error places collection. So we're just seeing new imagery.
00:23:34.080 - 00:23:58.536, Speaker A: Strange thing with a new shoe. Experimenting with AI fashion inspired by the Renaissance period. From colorways and architecture to masters of the arts, not ferment. I'm enjoying seeing these works that are not ferment. I think it really creates depth as an artist. So I'm tempted to start just putting works that I don't mint. And I think a lot of us have a ton of work we don't mint.
00:23:58.536 - 00:24:32.380, Speaker A: This is an artist who was sent to me by a viewer of the channel, Tish Barzanji. And I'd never heard of them before, but they're on super rare and just kind of an interesting artist. Kind of, yeah. Just has its own feeling here. Nothing quite like it. I mean, this is what I'd consider, like, a classic super rare artist. You know, like, it's just got super rare written all over it.
00:24:32.380 - 00:24:46.224, Speaker A: So reserve price. So, Tish. Stop that. Did I bring up. Yeah. So Tish sells his work. I think Tish is a guy, you know, $21,000.
00:24:46.224 - 00:25:08.844, Speaker A: $21,000. So, for a pretty penny over here, puts. And it's also interesting listed for 71 ETH. So 92,000. Sometimes you got to wonder if you put, like, a super high listing, if that helps. Just a question. I don't know, as we're trying to sort all this stuff out on how best to sell work.
00:25:08.844 - 00:25:30.580, Speaker A: So tish is going. Has been doing quite well. No list price, and usually just takes offers, from what I can tell. Okay. This is a generative art piece that sort of just impressed me by El Uatu. This is chipset, available for three Tezos edition of four. So it's still available.
00:25:30.580 - 00:25:47.810, Speaker A: I just thought it was kind of interesting. It was made done in python three. Okay, so I believe we could call this generative art. That's how little I know about generative art. Leave it to the experts there. And a couple of physical works here. The morning cloak.
00:25:47.810 - 00:26:15.550, Speaker A: And who is this by? Ben Crace, who has his first solo exhibition in London today and tomorrow. So I've never heard of Ben Crace or school still out. But I just saw it and I thought, hey, that's a pretty cool piece. Oil stick, pigment stick, oil, pastel on canvas. So, good luck to Ben Crace and his opening in London. And I never do photos, but there's always room for exceptions. So this is on Manifold XYZ.
00:26:15.550 - 00:26:27.294, Speaker A: I believe it's a photo. This is by Ray lives. And I just thought it was a pretty picture. So, with that, I hope you enjoy your weekend. Until next time, take care.
