00:00:03.520 - 00:00:26.206, Speaker A: It begins again. Welcome back, my friends, as we continue to sail forward here under beautiful sunny skies both inside and outside. I swear to God, I am hallucinating while I am talking to you. Fully sober. Coffee, sun, and good vibes. Welcome back. Artist journal, February 26, 2024.
00:00:26.206 - 00:00:43.400, Speaker A: Broadcasting from the inner half of the nervous system. My name is Adrian Pokebelly, and welcome back, and welcome all newcomers, too. There are newcomers. It continues. It continues. You know, as we were saying, you know, it's not life. It's not.
00:00:43.400 - 00:01:04.434, Speaker A: 80% of life is showing up. 100% of life is showing up, practically. And, yeah, you just keep showing up and you kind of wonder where this will all end up. So I'll just say, I hope you had a wonderful weekend. The sun came out here, and it just is, to use a cliche, it is a game changer here. So welcome back one more time. We have braindead here.
00:01:04.434 - 00:01:39.920, Speaker A: Braindead. We've been watching this work develop over the last week, and really interestingly, I feel like Braindead has quite resolved it brilliantly, actually. And I'll tell you what I love about it. There's a couple of things. First of all, I have a very superficial thing that I love about it, which is, you know, it's a sort of, you know, it's kind of classic comment, I would think to myself, which is, I love the margins. I love the spacing. You know, this could easily have been cut off, like, right here.
00:01:39.920 - 00:02:15.020, Speaker A: And I love how braindead is letting this work breathe, giving it some margin. It's almost like a kind of passepartout. You know, the thing that goes around, like you have your framed, you have your image, your print, and then you put the passepartout around the print, and then you have a frame. Kind of gives it that special, gives it some oomph, you know, gives it a little bit of punch, as they say in the graphic design business here. It kind of just lets it breathe. It kind of gives it a little bit more. I don't know if austerity is the right word, but just importance, it's.
00:02:15.020 - 00:03:06.108, Speaker A: It gives it a little bit more significance to a certain degree. But let me get to the real part that I'm really impressed by, although I am impressed by the margin, it is how Braindead has basically taken a certain, you know, I would say kind of, you know, it's as we. If we look at Kareem Safa. Sorry. As I was going to say, it kind of has a Kareem safa feel. Some of these earlier works. If we look at Braindead's page, what I love about what Braindead did here was we see the evolution, you know, here kind of playing with some of these kind of pixel art tropes, you know, again, kind of having a little bit of a cream sapphire, obviously, one, one imagines, and also maybe go go litis, you know, these pixel art factories, right? And actually doing quite a bit, but also doing animations, pixel art drawings.
00:03:06.108 - 00:03:52.422, Speaker A: And what I love is how, you know, Braindead has, it seems, has incorporated some of those elements into the mix, but completely made it their own, right. So because this, you know, these are not the colors of gogolitis, these are not the. These are not the black and white. This is not a pixel art factory. It's actually quite a different composition all round. This is a whole bunch of user interfaces and we can zoom in a little bit. We have a whole bunch of user interfaces here and they're all connected and there is a chaos to it, which I feel like we can relate to as we step back here, right.
00:03:52.422 - 00:04:29.254, Speaker A: I mean, to a weird degree, you know, this is us to a certain degree, one could argue. And here you have all of, like, just too many interfaces, right? I mean, that. And then you have the power, you have interesting little drop shadow creating space. Interestingly, as you see here, you know, that is a difference, at least with, say, kareem Sapphire, you know, and also in the color, this beautiful, you know, purple, you know, violet and kind of orange. A beautiful combination here. Never seen it done with circuitry before. Gorgeous.
00:04:29.254 - 00:05:20.958, Speaker A: Again, not something we've seen in gogolitis. So really adding to that whole pixel art factory, for lack of better term, genre, I mean, really the genre is probably pixel art, but within the genre of pixel art, we could say there is the pixel art factory thing, motif, perhaps. So all to say, just gorgeously done here. And there's something quite poetic about it and really making it Braindead's own, you know, incorporating influence and making it your own and doing it in style. Which is why we start the newspaper, the imagination here today with braindead, gif and of course, really cool. Right up here too, you know, these are nice little details here, and there are still some left. It's an addition of 25.
00:05:20.958 - 00:05:42.240, Speaker A: There are eight tezos each and there are still 17. So you still have time here. System V, three down, underscore, xx, xl. So just very cool. Nice collectors in here, too. Uxine, mech, TXT, Kyle Flemmer and more. Doctor Lee NFt massive, massive collector there.
00:05:42.240 - 00:06:12.588, Speaker A: So beautiful work from Braindead. And as you see here, kind of feels like a breakthrough work. And I love this work. Braindead actually gifted this to me, this melting heart after I showed it on the show actually, last week. So thanks for that, braindead. But, and having nothing to do with actually starting here, this just worked its way, fought its way to the top here on its own merits here. And the color, you know, it's a richly colorful work.
00:06:12.588 - 00:06:52.042, Speaker A: It may not be rainbow colors, it may not be red, yellow, you know, all these, there may not be a lot of colors in here, but it's still, I would say, an intensely colorful work. You know, that's not a gray, that looks like more like a green beige gray, even in the, you know, that's not just like, that's not just a pure desaturated gray here. They're very rich grays. And then again, the purple with the orange, it's really a stunning piece. You could make a print out of this, you know, without the movement. You could make a print out of this and go, that's beautiful. That is beautiful.
00:06:52.042 - 00:07:15.090, Speaker A: I'll put that on my wall, you know, so I'll just say, cool work, braindead. Very cool. Let's go to the comments here for last episode. And yeah, that was how did we do? So pretty good on YouTube here. Really nice ratio there of the likes to watches. And let's check out the comments here. Hey, pokebelly, my name is yo ao Valadao.
00:07:15.090 - 00:07:29.904, Speaker A: Valadeo. Yoeo Valadeo, I believe is how we'd say it. And I'm graveotopia. So nice to meet you, Yoao. And thank you very much for showing my work and for the kind words. I am very grateful. So you are more than welcome.
00:07:29.904 - 00:08:41.833, Speaker A: And yeah, keep up the great work and looking forward to seeing more and thrilled that you're watching the show. So thank you for the comment. Yuri J. Thank you, Adrian, for keeping the conversation open. So, so here I'm actually still trying to figure out what Uri Jay was saying, but to kind of briefly recap, Uri Jay opened the conversation of what does it mean when we're simulating oil paintings with AI? We've talked about this for a couple of shows now, and I'm happy to keep talking about it because I think it's bringing up really interesting issues of that kind of come to the very basics of actually aesthetic philosophy, which is what are we doing if we, you know, just to actually take a step back while it's in my head here, you know, what are we doing in at least what we might call figurative or maybe representative, maybe narrative painting, what are we doing? We're taking copy. We're at least copying things that kind of elements that come from the so called real world, and we're kind of representing them. We're making a copy of sorts.
00:08:41.833 - 00:08:54.621, Speaker A: Right. In on. On an art piece. Right. This almost takes you to kind of platonism, you know, mimesis making copies. Right. And its most basic thing, at least representative art.
00:08:54.621 - 00:09:45.246, Speaker A: What are we doing? We're making copies. Right. So there's a kind of copying that's going on now. So that is the, what we might say, like a, I would argue a kind of foundational layer as we move forward on this discussion. Now, let's see what, I was trying to figure out what Yuri Jay was saying here. Let's see if we can figure it out. It is a very interesting point about artworks belonging to the Internet, since, in my head, working with Renaissance is a privilege of people being born or have a strong relationship to Italy, since it adds extra depth and meaning to the artwork and the whole process, you know, this golden age that may never back drama and so on, like works of Nicola Samori, who I wasn't sure.
00:09:45.246 - 00:10:21.074, Speaker A: I did a quick search. I didn't know, like works of Nicholas Samori. Maybe some people have heard who this is. But if it is all about mostly aesthetics, maybe the cracks we are seeing on AI painting that were made just a few days ago, say, and again, I hope strange thing is okay with me mentioning, but I think it's just such a. It's like a paradigmatic example, a strange thing, because he does it so well. Right? And it's so beautiful. And then the cracks on the painting are almost becoming this subject matter in itself.
00:10:21.074 - 00:10:55.664, Speaker A: And that actually brings up a very interesting point. And actually, Jeff Koons is going to come up in this discussion. So I'm actually Jeff Koons Mona Lisa because this brings up a very interesting point while we're on it now, Jeff Koons made this artwork. Actually, it was his team, I believe, who made this artwork. But if you look super closely, I don't. Gazing ball, Mona Lisa, high res. I don't even know if we'll have one of these.
00:10:55.664 - 00:11:46.214, Speaker A: But if you look closely, the cracks are painted. Okay. We'll see 253 pixels wide. If you look closely at all of this series, the gazing ball series, what they did, as far as I could tell, was they painted the cracks in, you might say, a hyper postmodern thing to do. Right. And so as we think of the cracks within AI and this idea of kind of simulating the preciousness and the physicality and the age of the work in AI here, we see an interesting antessa or precedent with Jeff Koons, who we're actually going to have a story on. Katya Kazakhina has a big story there that we're going to get to.
00:11:46.214 - 00:12:28.828, Speaker A: So just to kind of add to our discussion here, as we continue to navigate, again, a very, we're getting into the, I think, the philosophy of aesthetics here, which is fascinating. And I didn't even, you know, but when we're talking about copies, like, what are we doing here? And we're mimesis, which is the Greek for copy. That's the territory we're starting to get into here. But if it is all mostly about aesthetics, maybe the cracks we're seeing on AI painting that were made just a few days ago is a sign of a 10 zero year old Duchamp gesture of drawing a mustache on top of a Renaissance icon. Back to the Mona Lisa here. And, of course, Duchamp's Mona Lisa. Let's just bring that up.
00:12:28.828 - 00:12:56.372, Speaker A: So I'm sure everybody knows what we're talking about, but let's just take a look. I believe it's a postcard. Yeah, right. El ash au au ku, which is a play. That is a French. For those that don't know, that is, I'm sure most of you know this, but for those that don't know, that is a play on the French. And Marcel Duchamp loved word games or, you know, puns of sorts.
00:12:56.372 - 00:13:16.036, Speaker A: And that what that means in French is she has a hot behind, so to speak, au coel. So just so you know, there. So kind of. And then putting the mustache there. Is this the version I thought it was? Maybe there's more than one. I'm not sure. Maybe it was this.
00:13:16.036 - 00:13:38.164, Speaker A: I didn't realize it was desaturated. It's such a famous image, you almost never look at it. If this is what it is. Tableau dada, pal. Marcel Duchamp, maybe this is the one. So now I think what Duchamp was doing was just like the futurists. If you look at the futurist manifesto, it's sort of like burned down the Louvre is what they're saying.
00:13:38.164 - 00:14:15.082, Speaker A: Pretty extreme manifesto with the futurist. Very early, I think, like 1904, you know, I think it was bocconi who wrote it, if I'm not mistaken, Umberto Baccioni. So let's get back to Yuri's comment here. So, and I think what Duchamp was doing there was basically calling it, it's sort of like the futurist saying, burn down the Louvre. Like, let's start fresh. We have a new world, right? Let's start fresh. And you kind of get a similar, I would say spiritual, for lack of better terms, a similar kind of outpouring of sentiment from our friend Uri J.
00:14:15.082 - 00:15:22.892, Speaker A: Here. Like, let's kind of start fresh here is kind of part. Why are we re emulating, you know, the past? Right? So, but mostly, but if it is mostly all about aesthetics, maybe the cracks we're seeing on AI painting is a sign of 10 zero year old Duchon gesture of drawing a mustache on top of a Renaissance icon for how long this postmodern moves will be acceptable. So I love the question, although I'm still trying to piece together the point here, and I don't know. Nicholas Samori super well, again, I did a quick search here, so I almost just need more information on this. Yuri, I need you to go more in depth. But what I would argue similar to what we see with Jeff Koons or his team, and, you know, Jeff Koons directing and the team producing, I think, these oil paintings at different scale, importantly, with the, I don't like the ball.
00:15:22.892 - 00:15:45.808, Speaker A: I think you could do it without the gazing ball. But I think Jeff Koons felt it needed something. Okay. It needed that kind of provocation. But just like they painted in the cracks, one could argue it is a similar gesture by emulating these oil paintings using AI. Okay. It becomes a hyper postmodern gesture, for lack of better term, maybe we coined a new term here.
00:15:45.808 - 00:16:42.774, Speaker A: It is like a hyper postmodern gesture, you know, so it's almost like it's calling attention, because if, let's say again, let's just back up to our aesthetics here. What is Leonardo doing when he paints the Mona Lisa? He is copying nature. Right? Mimesis. He is copying nature, and then he has his work. What is Jeff Koons doing? He is taking the artwork, the copy, and then making a copy of the copy with his gazing ball, Mona Lisa with a few transformations and interestingly, highlighting the physicality of the artwork itself. It's not like Jeff Koons was trying to re emulate what Leonardo originally had. Jeff Koons is actually re emulating the work as we have it, the physical work, the artwork.
00:16:42.774 - 00:17:19.584, Speaker A: So it becomes a representation of art, which brought us back to what I think you were talking at the start here about all these artworks on the Internet. So, so interesting. So you could make the argument just to wrap up this point and we will come back to it. Please keep commenting as long as you keep commenting. Yuri, I'm happy to bring this conversation continue because I think it's getting us to interesting places here. I wish I remembered my last point. I had like the killer point here was about to come down on us.
00:17:19.584 - 00:18:21.530, Speaker A: So let's so all to say here, I remembered, I remembered. So we could argue. We could argue, as I shout to the apartments around me, we could argue that this move, let's say again, to use our friend strange thing, and I hope you're feeling better, strange thing, who is suffering from COVID and kind of had it come back a little bit. Shout out to strange thing and thank you for your patience as we discuss your work. You could argue it is along the same lines from a conceptual angle, a kind of hyper postmodern move that is on par with Jeff Koons. One could argue, I would argue, one could interpret this kind of almost fetish, fetishizing the cracks in the painting to an extreme degree. That almost becomes what Jeff Koons was doing on steroids, like the AI version of it, I would argue.
00:18:21.530 - 00:18:56.150, Speaker A: And then it becomes like, maybe this is like killer concept art, rather than this being like, hey, why are we kind of going back and, you know, trying to re emulate the oil painting? One could argue this becomes like hyper postmodern artwork. Like, very interesting on a conceptual level. The argument could be made. So it continues here. So again, thank you for provoking this discussion, Yuri. And again, feel free to weigh back in because maybe more interesting discussion will result. Let us continue here.
00:18:56.150 - 00:19:09.038, Speaker A: Ikana, later. Your channel is a great service to artisan collectors. So a very nice comment. Thank you. And Radha, awesome to hear from you. Number one, as ever. Eredus Ain, we need your book.
00:19:09.038 - 00:19:40.208, Speaker A: Poco. That is hilarious. You know, we talked about this and of course, there are a few books out. You know, the book of, I think I called it actually the book of the imagination, which is maybe, I don't know if that's a good title or not. Maybe it should be something like that because you know, the problem. And actually, this is kind of where all of these tabs here of comments are going. You know, I think the important thing to do is nobody can put together the definitive story.
00:19:40.208 - 00:20:22.124, Speaker A: Say, let's just say for the sake of argument, I would argue on almost on any art scene, but say on this digital crypto art scene, like, I don't think anybody can do that. All you can have is different accounts we're not in the province of physics or mathematics here. We're in the province of story. We're in the world of story. So all we can have are accounts, right, of. And reflections and, you know, how hypotheses, you might say, like, we might call it social science at best, right? And some comparisons, we can look at the market, but then we can also look, okay, this was clearly a brilliant work that wasn't recognized by the market at first, but then later. So then, you know, so I'll just say thank you for the comment.
00:20:22.124 - 00:20:50.574, Speaker A: Ered Dessein. And now that there is kind of a big book out, it does make you the thought. I was talking to a friend this weekend and saying, you know, maybe now is the time to actually approach a publisher and actually put a book together. So I'm excited. Let's see. And we'll see if I act on that one thing at a time, as ever. So over to our YouTube comments, and we got some great ones here.
00:20:50.574 - 00:21:01.674, Speaker A: And again, thank you for the massive response here. 17,000 views there. Big response on Twitter. Ain't nothing. Here we go. Mister Pokebelly. Awesome to hear from you.
00:21:01.674 - 00:21:24.604, Speaker A: Do oh, do. Thanks for the mention, Jiro Kuei. Hope you enjoyed the song. And I think that was the Zora work, wasn't it, with the album? And I think it was kind of like jazz, and it had a cool vibe. Ellie Lo, thanks for the episode. Pretty interesting conversation about AI and oil paintings in a prism of playing violin with a sampler and simulacrum. So this is also.
00:21:24.604 - 00:22:07.476, Speaker A: This needs to also be brought in because, of course, simulacra and simulacrum are. Simulacrums are about copying as well. Okay, so we may even need. I hesitate to say this, but we may even need to get to a little bit of greek aesthetic philosophy, like just some foundational ideas out of Plato, Plotinus. And then we go back to Baudrillard, and then maybe we return to our own discussion and we bring our own thoughts, all of us, to this conversation. Glad you're enjoying it, Ellie. Love your work.
00:22:07.476 - 00:22:20.844, Speaker A: We have a work by you, actually. This show, as I was saying, it feels like a weirdly complicated topic. It is. Yeah, indeed. Cedar plank. So hasrubble waffles and wow, wait till you hear this. Thanks so much.
00:22:20.844 - 00:22:55.744, Speaker A: Pokebally. No, AI. Right, because I was speculating, how was the other version of this work made? This version here, those JPeg distortions, lots of revisions due to abandonware J's site finding errors and panicking when the original image disappears. Originally this was a senior citizen brawl, but lizard appeared. Pink, blue, pink. Ensenada residents always also new handle might look familiar. Cedar plank.
00:22:55.744 - 00:23:29.552, Speaker A: Plank cedar. So all to say, you won't believe it, but Hasdrubal waffle sent this to me on ethereum. A one of one of this earlier version of this just raw masterpiece is how I want to call it. So I thought to myself, oh, and here it is now, I bought this work actually for quite a bit of money. I think it was like, how much was that? I think it was like, was it 0.2 bitcoin? Kind of scary. During the bear market.
00:23:29.552 - 00:23:45.220, Speaker A: I don't know if it was that much. It was $750 during the bear market when bitcoin was like 15k. So it was zero five BTC. All to say it's one of my favorite works ever. And this is where the name comes from. Cedar Plank. I'm into CB.
00:23:45.220 - 00:24:04.508, Speaker A: My code name, Cedar plank. This was a masterpiece I'll never forget. The reason it was so expensive is because me and Legojo both had to have it. And Legojo has great, great taste. So I think. And so there we were both battling. Legojo still says that is one of his greatest works there.
00:24:04.508 - 00:24:24.108, Speaker A: This awesome, awesome piece. Okay, let's continue. And do we have any more? Oh, this is actually. I brought this up and the theory of obscurity. Meet the residents wiki. So here, I actually brought this up. This is super interesting.
00:24:24.108 - 00:25:10.040, Speaker A: So I'm just going to read the first paragraph here because, of course, Waffles uses a lot of different aliases. Right. So if you want to understand that the theory of obscurity is a musical, a musical theory attributed to bavarian avant garde composer n sonata. So there's the sonata that we just saw. The theory posts that an artist does their best work when working in obscurity, even to the point of complete seclusion, unhampered by the expectations or influence of their potential audience. Very interesting. The theory is best known for inspiring the resonance philosophy of anonymity and ambiguity, which has remained consistent from the earliest years into the present day.
00:25:10.040 - 00:25:45.654, Speaker A: Perhaps the fullest musical representations of the theory of obscurity to date is the resident second album not available, which was recorded by the group in 1974, but withheld from release until 78, apparently in accordance with the theory. So it's interesting how it's now best known as Sonata's musical work or in relation. So now he is known this, I think Neil? Sonata, if I'm not mistaken, end Sonata. So just very, very interesting. So thanks for sending that to me. Waffles. I should actually put that.
00:25:45.654 - 00:26:10.308, Speaker A: I just closed it, but I should put. I'm going to start putting the articles in the community. And here is the work, by the way, that was sent to me by waffles. So just a massive thank you. That is a gift I will not forget. I was thinking to myself, well, you know, maybe this will help my retirement here, because there is no. Let's, let's continue.
00:26:10.308 - 00:26:24.580, Speaker A: Let's continue. Martin Jo, epic episode. Always impressed by the amount of art and information we consume on a daily basis. Thank you, Martin. Great to glad you are enjoying that. And I always appreciate your huge support. Never before in history.
00:26:24.580 - 00:26:54.246, Speaker A: Very interesting about the Taschen book. Whenever I see one of these attempts to write the history of art today, Giorgio Vasari inevitably comes to mind. Well, there is kind of a. I really appreciate that and that is humbling. There is kind of like when I build this show, I am, you know, to a certain degree I do think of people who are unborn potentially watching this, whether they will or not. I think as artists, all of us are. Ideally, we are kind of, you have to think big picture.
00:26:54.246 - 00:27:26.564, Speaker A: If you're going to spend the time, why not have the ambition to hopefully that people will care about your artwork in a thousand years? So all to say, I kind of, it is kind of loosely, a bit more classical in structure. You might say this to a certain degree, but I mean, it's still kind of a newspaper. The imagination of sorts. So anyway, but the way we kind of look at different artists and learn about these different artists. Thank you, Martin. I really appreciate that. Lily Illo Pokebelly thanks so much.
00:27:26.564 - 00:27:45.436, Speaker A: Great episode. Would love to see a book of all the art you love. So we got a few comments like this. So I appreciate that. And the idea is in my head, I may approach a publisher, but that is put it on the to do list, especially with all your encouragement out there. So I appreciate it. Porn xboyd awesome to hear from you.
00:27:45.436 - 00:28:09.966, Speaker A: Such a classic, awesome artist. Nat cat and just highlighting color, color there. Who had a wonderful work last episode there and human boy. Great episode and Happy Friday. Thanks for sharing my art today. Your comments on the mosaic filter have inspired me to post some of my favorites I have made using it, using it as I use it quite a bit. Well, I had no idea, however, in gimp and not Photoshop, so I'm not sure how different they are.
00:28:09.966 - 00:28:38.764, Speaker A: Well, maybe that's the reason why, because I have used the photoshop one and exactly I don't recognize this mosaic filter, whereas I think Uri J might is, I suspect, using the Photoshop mosaic. Very cool, though. And good to know. So thank you, human boy. And I think, is that all? So here is the work. And the hasdrubal waffle puts out another stunner here. The chicken heads are back.
00:28:38.764 - 00:28:58.470, Speaker A: They're eating kind of big legs here. And it looks like the monster. And this sold. And I love the title here. Wednesday, May 23 513 2900 ad only two megabytes. Derfanger put in an offer there. And that's a significant amount of money right now.
00:28:58.470 - 00:29:33.500, Speaker A: 100, probably $60, maybe more for this beautiful artwork here. So has dribble waffle. You know, he started posting on ETH before Ethan really started rocket launching. So now that's starting to pay off for the great hastrubal waffle. RJ watching while laid up with COVID Excellent relief. Well, again, another artist with COVID It's kind of freaky how COVID, you know, how prevalent it is. So hope you're feeling better, RJ, and glad it can give you some relief here.
00:29:33.500 - 00:29:50.268, Speaker A: A little bit of what I mean. So we're wondering about the computer art that RJ was. Maybe this is what RJ was talking about with excellent relief. Looking at this computer art, a little bit of what I mean, in London and zoom, there were great talks from the computer art society. And here's the link. Lots of resource. So these are.
00:29:50.268 - 00:30:15.324, Speaker A: This is a post that RJ put out. Lots of resources on net art and various histories in Warhol, which are great. Okay, this is great. And with many more recourses out there, of course. And there are things like digital art within contemporary art, like Jenny Holzer or Hockney, color cycling of Jim Sachs, Susan Cates drawings. Just a sample. Essentially fighting the belief that computer art started with nfts.
00:30:15.324 - 00:30:37.990, Speaker A: Indeed. Also, I recall you saying you were thinking of writing a book one day, eagerly awaiting that version of NFT history over here. Well, you'll definitely be in that book, RJ, without question. So I'll just say that's why. But I think nobody can have a final word on these things. It's sort of like, as Martin Joe was saying, it's like Vasari. It's like Vasari, just boom, boom, boom.
00:30:37.990 - 00:31:05.848, Speaker A: It's not like that. Those are the only artists that matter. Puts out his book. And I think that's the way to do it, rather than trying to say, this is it, and this is all that matters. And, you know, avoiding absolutes in a. In a discussion that doesn't offer you absolutes, right? So all to say, thank you for the comments there, RJ, and shout out and hope you feel better. Also, this was posted by Luke 500 in the community.
00:31:05.848 - 00:31:35.964, Speaker A: And thank you everybody for posting in the community a few works. I put in this work right here, but we won't spoil it. But I did want to highlight this post that Luke 500 just put in to the community, the artist journal community, which you can find on my profile page and where I also want to post the links. Say, like what we had with hysteruble waffle. Wouldn't it be great to collect all that? Amazing. You see it and then you can read up on it. I gotta say, this is truly the BTC ordinals starter pack, while it is as much as important as minting service.
00:31:35.964 - 00:32:02.318, Speaker A: Yeah. And I would actually, you know, again, I lost an ordinal of one of these bitcoin puppets because I don't know if I probably screwed up somehow. It got transferred out of my wallet. Maybe I accidentally spent it. Whatever happened, that's worth like, a painful amount of money. I think, like $7,500 now. So all to say I was using uniset, and so the wallet, maybe use x verse is what I would say.
00:32:02.318 - 00:32:22.446, Speaker A: And here. Anyways, take a screenshot of this if you're looking to get started on ordinals. Leonidas, you know, the great ordinal leader really has posted the basics here for you. So inscription tool, unisat. So use Unisat to inscribe. Cool. So nice and decentralized there now.
00:32:22.446 - 00:32:49.008, Speaker A: Okay, so we had the book on Friday. Now we have the economist. Rafiq anadal is using AI to become the artist of the moment. So I thought this was interesting and illustrative because, of course, we all have been. So Rafiq Anadal, for those that don't know, is an AI artist showed in the moMA somewhat controversially. Jerry Saltz, of course, was calling it like a lava lamp. You know, and I think a lot of AI artists sort of felt that, you know, it's always heavy.
00:32:49.008 - 00:33:11.348, Speaker A: It feels a little heavy handed when, say, moma comes in and they pick a winner. It's almost like there's going to be winners and losers. It's kind of like the Taschen book, which is why I bring up these. It's more just about accounts. There's no absolutes in any of these stories. And so this is why I'm always suspicious of absolutes. Like, there shouldn't be, you know, oh, now he's the artist of the moment.
00:33:11.348 - 00:33:46.424, Speaker A: This is an absolute. Now there's an argument to be made, and let's look at it here. They swirl on super bright screens, creating what Mister Anadal calls data paintings, and shout out to Arno for sending this to me. Thank you. And wiggles on walls, data sculptures, some compares animations to glorified screen savers and lava lamps, referring to Jerry Saltz, more spectacular than substantive, but tap in the link. So this is just on Instagram here. But I actually brought up this on purpose because I could have brought up the article, which is here, but I want to show you what's going on here.
00:33:46.424 - 00:34:23.150, Speaker A: So you click on the economists, let's go to the link, right? And then you go to the link and then subscribe now. Okay. So one has to also keep in mind that part of what the economist is doing here is trying to generate kind of, you know, action on their page so that people come to the Economist and subscribe, you know, and click on here. And it's. It's not like you get the story. It's all, you know, so you can subscribe. Right? So let's read just what they have here.
00:34:23.150 - 00:35:07.826, Speaker A: With all that in mind. Last year he was in high demand. Last year, Rafiq Anadal projected luminous images of Corel onto a wall at the World Economic Forum in Davos Davos, and covered the exterior screen of the sphere, a new concert venue in Las Vegas, with animated, tumbling blue blocks. In October, the MoMA in New York acquired unsupervised machine hallucinations, in which a machine learning model generates artworks based on those in the museum's collection. On February 16, echoes of the Earth, his largest ever show in Britain, opened at Serpentine London north gallery in London. He's a 38 year old Turk who lives in Los Angeles, is riding widespread public interest in artificial intelligence, become the most visible, visible digital artist of its generation. And again, it's kind of like a sweeping statement.
00:35:07.826 - 00:35:34.676, Speaker A: There may be, you know, maybe that's true. I mean, it's an. I just actually asked that question, like, do you think that's true? It's an interesting, because I think the argument actually could be made. I guess I would qualify it again, I'd say maybe for now. And like, since when? Since the last, you know, you know, since the last few months. Because, of course, Moma. How long ago was that? That was within about a year ago, maybe a year and a half.
00:35:34.676 - 00:35:56.244, Speaker A: His work reflects the innovation and anxieties of the current moment. As Mister Anadal sees it, AI is a powerful creative tool. In a world where there's so much life happens in a digital realm, he argues, data has become a new pigment. A nice quote there. So just kind of interesting. I kind of. I thought it was interesting, especially within the context of the Tashin argument.
00:35:56.244 - 00:36:18.384, Speaker A: It kind of feels like this is my issue with the article. It's not kind of more just it's not as. It doesn't feel super, as descriptive as it doesn't feel totally objective. It feels like they're trying to push something on you. Like, this is what's happening and you have to believe it. And this is how it is now. It's at serpentine, so it's over.
00:36:18.384 - 00:36:59.936, Speaker A: And what that does is it all of a sudden the moma, you know, a few people at the moma, a few people at Serpentine, and then maybe a couple of people at the economist have made a decision. And then it becomes like, you know, in total, how many people were involved there? 15 people, if that. And then all of a sudden, he's the most important person ever, according to these 15 people that are making these decisions. You know, these are just the sorts of things that go through my head. So anyways, all to say congrats to Rafiq Annadol, but I do. It kind of reminds me of the Taschen book, which it feels like there's kind of a push. People are saying this is canonical and this sort of thing.
00:36:59.936 - 00:37:26.364, Speaker A: What was happening with the Taschen book, these are accounts, is how I put it. So let's continue here. And then here's Hans Ulric Obrist, a prominent curator. I believe he does the curation at serpentine. And the serpentine. So maybe Hans Ulrich Oberst. So we'll make it 16 people, right? And then, so you have all of these influencers, for lack of better term, or at least Hans Ulrich Obrist.
00:37:26.364 - 00:37:57.114, Speaker A: And then all of a sudden, narratives are being pushed that you have to think this way, or at least seemingly. Let's see what Hans has to say here. Rafikanidal is now open. A pioneer in the aesthetics of machine intelligence, artist and technologist Rafik Anadal is known for his innovative media works and large scale public installations. Now, another thing that should be noted here is Warhol's famous dictum. It's not what they say about you, it's how many inches they write about you. And referring to.
00:37:57.114 - 00:38:31.604, Speaker A: It's not if the news about you is good or bad. It's how much print, how many inches of print have been written about you. And remember the big thing with the big snafu with, you know, with Jerry Saltz and Rafik Anadal. That was all good for Rafiq Anadal. Now he's showing it serpentine and the economist is writing, and it's like, wow, he must be a big deal. So verifying, one might say, a Warhol's dictum, like, kind of showing it a demonstration, one could argue. So here it is, the show, and you can see it here.
00:38:31.604 - 00:39:30.794, Speaker A: So there we go. The exhibition investigates the ways in which technology alters our perception of the natural world and our experience of time and space. Now, I would just finally add on this, this statement here, written by Hanselrich Oberyst, could be written by a first year art student on their artist statement on their show. This exhibition investigates the way in which technology alters our perception of the natural world and our experience of time and space. So I just say that not as a criticism, but just as a way of illustration, that, you know, these idols that are sort of paraded around as, again, people that you have to believe as being the experts, myself included, think for yourself. And this is one thing, I hope that this show is different in the sense that I'm never trying to lord my opinion on anybody. I'm not trying to convince anybody.
00:39:30.794 - 00:39:51.030, Speaker A: I'm sharing a public journal. It's part of why I do this format is, you know, and then people can figure it out for themselves. That's what I prefer. So anyways, I don't want to sound like overly polemic here. It's just interesting. And thank you again, Arno, for sending me those links. Very interesting.
00:39:51.030 - 00:40:19.786, Speaker A: Now, kind of fitting within this whole issue. So we're back to Jeff Koons, and this is quite a story by art Detective Katya Kezekina on her instagram here. Jeff Koon's art is on the moon. As we. I posted that actually in the community, but. So nfts went to the moon that was posted in the community, if you scroll through it. But as prices have cratered, can power players reignite as market? And again, we're almost, it's almost becoming somewhat political here.
00:40:19.786 - 00:40:49.906, Speaker A: We're starting to see the power structure, to a certain degree of the contemporary trad art market here. Major shows will soon hit Hong Kong, New York, and London. Will a collector pay more than $50 million for his sculptures of Michael Jackson and Bubbles? Let's take just a quick look, because I find this very interesting. February 23. The artist's soaring ambition shows no signs of abating. Market doldrums be damned. In the past year alone, Kunz has taken on the moon where his sculpture has just landed after a week long journey and the sun.
00:40:49.906 - 00:41:17.974, Speaker A: More on that later. But look at this. So sales are down. Several significant works that the great collector originally acquired are now heading to Hong Kong for Japan. Koons at art Intelligence Global. The exhibition unites a dozen pieces from Koons early series. And now I thought I saw here, sales are down 84% is what I saw here.
00:41:17.974 - 00:42:15.850, Speaker A: And maybe that was in Katya's stories here, which are starting, but his sales are down. Maybe it's here. Here it is. Let's just go with the summary here. And of course famous work by Jeff Koons and just on Jeff Koons and I'm taking forever here. I used to be quite skeptical of Jeff Koons and I'm not like 100% on board, but I have to say I watched an interview with him where he described being a 19 year old going to New York and finding Salvador Dali's phone number in the phone book where it was calling Salvador Dali and asking if he could basically come over. Dali invited him to his hotel that he lived in in New York City, and Kunz was saying basically how he never forgot the grace, basically, and the generosity of Salvador Dali when he did that.
00:42:15.850 - 00:42:53.318, Speaker A: And I think Kunz gets criticized a lot, but there is a heart there. And with all the money and everything, but I get, at least that's my impression, there is a heart there. He's actually like, the more you see him interviewed, the more you kind of warm up to him, I would argue. Let's look at Katya's statement here. Some of Jeff Koon's biggest champions are working hard to reverse the recent downward trajectory in his prices. The stakes are high. Kun's auction totals have plummeted since his gleam, gleaming steel rabbit fetched $91 million in 2019, making him the most expensive living artist in the world.
00:42:53.318 - 00:43:45.630, Speaker A: The crown he still holds last year was particularly bad. Sales fell to just 27.8 million, down 84% from the peak of 170 million in 2014, according to the Artnet price database. Almost 40% of 292 Kuhn's lots offered failed to find buyers. He ranked 72nd on a list of artists annual auction revenue, down from 55th itself, a demotion from 2019 when he was 15th. This spring, several powerful secondary market players are mounting Kunz exhibitions in New York, London and Hong Kong to remind everyone of his greatness or to remind everybody that you should pay more money for his work. So you know that museum show that you're going to of Jeff Koons in New York or London or Hong Kong, one wonders the motivations behind it.
00:43:45.630 - 00:44:36.092, Speaker A: Like, again, to me, it starts to show kind of a power structure of sorts, potentially, if I understand Katya's description here, right, that really, okay, the market's down. Let's remind everybody of his greatness, but also of all the works we own of Jeff Koons that have come down, you know, dramatically in value that we can't sell anymore. So just kind of interesting, especially within this whole discussion here. Now we got a few just book comments I want to follow up on here. The tasian NFT book thing should serve as a reminder that if you are from the global south, you got to make your own darn book. And that crossed my mind as well. This, it felt very American centric, and it also felt very ETH centric, didn't it? So that was interesting.
00:44:36.092 - 00:44:59.748, Speaker A: I thought that was a very interesting comment here. In all seriousness, it's a lovely book. An artist deserved to be in there. Indeed. Of the Horowon artists featured, 7% were from Africa, six from Latin America, and 5% from Asia, 18% total from the global south. It's a sad ratio, but I get that it's important to consider the timing of it all. Book publishing cycles are much longer and slower than the digital arts space.
00:44:59.748 - 00:45:42.906, Speaker A: Much of the community input taken by editors came from and 2022. Most of the selection centered around ETH nfts during the 21 bull market. So Sotheby's was mentioned way more than hicket nunc, which is where the explosion of global south artists came from. So it's an account ultimately, like all things, that sprout organically without the fertilizing effects of global north capital. I think it will take time for people to realize how special hen was in imagining a pluralistic art world where. Where global south artists are on the same playing field as established local north artists, I think local, and where we all support and learn from each other. So maybe one day they'll make a book on devoted to Han and of this wave of global south artists.
00:45:42.906 - 00:46:38.900, Speaker A: What I would prefer, because in a sense, I would prefer just like put it this way, if I was to make an account, I would just try and make a raw account, forgetting about all the market stuff and then bringing in kind of art history into it and just going, okay, how does all this stuff, you know, kind of like this show, contextualize this, this work within the larger tradition to see what we can kind of make of it, to try and place it, you know, not necessarily try and make some huge statements about now, here are all the, in this case, global south artists. But how do, how do we understand it better rather than trying to almost pick to a certain degree, winners and losers to a certain degree. So all to say, interesting take here from Sabato. Here was another. So X copy wrote, the book is good if you're in it, the book is bad if you're not. And Luke 500. I thought Luke was actually absolutely right here.
00:46:38.900 - 00:46:54.448, Speaker A: And I agree with this. And I think I kind of said this. This is good for NFTs in general. The book is good for those who are in it, and the book is good for those who aren't in it. And I actually totally agree with that. This is good for nfts. It helps legitimize, you know, what's Tashin is saying.
00:46:54.448 - 00:47:18.128, Speaker A: Hey, this is cool. Let's take a closer look. Artie hands. I'm so thrilled Damien Hurst and Sotheby's finally get credit they deserve on nfts. Yes. So, you know, just some criticism coming out on the book. Unknown collector who needs that new book if there is NFT yearbook? And there are several accounts that are out there by the community, so I'd never even heard of NFT yearbook.
00:47:18.128 - 00:47:58.712, Speaker A: A project really caring to cover web3 culture and making a ton of money for artists with a special book cover editions as nfts 100% to artists, if I remember correctly. So interesting there. And there's RJ smashing all computers since I didn't get in the book with this beautiful Rubens work that he did. Beautiful pastiche of several couple artists there. Josh Blockchain is the only book that should matter in this space. It's all very archaic. And this is an interesting thing, too, because I did, actually, I mentioned it, like, about a year ago, this idea, maybe more of doing a book just out of, you know, just mentioning it in passing.
00:47:58.712 - 00:48:55.402, Speaker A: And one of the reasons why I thought maybe, I'm not sure about it is a lot of this artwork is moving, right? And so adding to Josh's point, you know, getting a book and who reads books anymore? Like, I have a lot of art books, you know where they are right now? Like, four of them are, or three of them here are propping up this computer here, and they're doing a mighty fine job of that. And, yeah, okay. I wish I had something that could prop up my computer better. But, you know, who's reading books anymore? You know, to generalize, you know, all of us read, I think. Well, some of us read sometimes, but, you know, I'm online. Right. And so then it goes, you know, who's reading this book or any book on art, you know, to a certain degree, do we need a book on art? Like, who's, if I was to make it, who's going to read it? You know, like just an interesting question, right? Is it just.
00:48:55.402 - 00:49:23.014, Speaker A: And again, is this all just about social proof? Because as humans, we look at a book and it's like the Bible. Well, it must be true. If it's written down and published in a book, it makes it look like these words are more important than words that we speak, you know, so. So let's continue. Chicago, my quick thought on the Taschen book, and for that matter, any top hundred inner circle or ranking, focus on the work. Be happy for your friends. Don't take it too seriously, but appreciate it for what it is.
00:49:23.014 - 00:49:46.862, Speaker A: That kind of sums up actually how I feel about it exactly. Be happy for the people who are in it. Don't take it too seriously. And it just would appreciate for what it is. This is an account, okay? It's not the final. You can, if you don't like it, you can always write an account, your own account. Right? So I thought that was kind of wise words.
00:49:46.862 - 00:50:23.100, Speaker A: This was interesting. So, shifting gears a little bit. So Raoul, pal, of course, from real vision, big crypto bull, got people like me into crypto. To Ral's credit, it took me a while watching real vision in 2020. That's what kind of Raoul's outrageously bullish sentiment towards crypto, which he was actually pretty right about. It took me a while to get it at first. It took me a while to get out of the bloody mid curve, but I now see clearly that the top of the pyramid of the entire crypto economy are art NFTs, and in particular, deeply culturally relevant and truly pioneering digital artists.
00:50:23.100 - 00:50:49.404, Speaker A: And I have a feeling he's thinking more probably of ETH culture. But, you know, and this is something that 6529 has been saying for a while. And actually there was comment, they'll only get more expensive in time, too. I actually think this is an open question because they're pretty darn expensive as it is. But maybe it's possible. Art NFTs are the left and right of the bell curve. All other NFTs except punks are mid curve.
00:50:49.404 - 00:51:37.646, Speaker A: That's fine. And many will be valuable, but not in the same ballpark ballpark as the rarer art. So he's not too specific on which ones he's discussing, but one imagines x copy squiggles kind of the stuff you'd see in the Taschen book one imagines Raoul pal is discussing. Interesting comment, though, from just like a purely investment perspective, because that would also have implications, I think, for tazos art as well. So let's continue here. Curio Fringe it's hard to believe we're almost an hour in and look at how many more I'm going to have to speed up here, guys. It's starting to seem to me that Tezos platform will again begin implementing more incentive programs for minting and collecting, which means charging service flat fees per transaction with rewards to going to those that draw the most transactions.
00:51:37.646 - 00:52:04.306, Speaker A: So just an interesting comment there from Curio French. I wonder if Curio is thinking that not enough people are collecting right now. I think object seems to be doing fine from what I could tell. But, but interesting point here from Curio French. So we'll have to watch for that wok. Am I the Tezos artist? Meme inventor? I do believe so. I mean, walk's the first person that I saw hosting that, so shout out to walk.
00:52:04.306 - 00:52:38.642, Speaker A: Omz a crypto artist doesn't just use crypto themes in their work. It isn't enough to mint art on the blockchain or be here early. And again, I'm kind of weary of these absolutist statements in this whole discussion. A crypto artist embodies a defiant but collaborative spirit, advocating for autonomy and decentralization for all. Does this mean everybody who's on Solana is, no, not an artist or not a crypto artist? You know, so I'm weary. Crypto artists built this space. I'm also weary of comment.
00:52:38.642 - 00:53:08.106, Speaker A: So interesting thoughts, but I'm wary of these absolutist. Again, I'm weary of anybody who's trying to make anybody think anything, like tell people how to think, you know, and so trying to make the point. And, you know, it's, let's be generous here, trying to make a point. So interesting, but I'm weary is how I feel about that. Relax. Over a quarter of artists polled would not be making art if they weren't in web3. Kind of an interesting poll from relax.
00:53:08.106 - 00:53:43.934, Speaker A: And again, this was posted in the community here. Would you still be making art if you weren't in Web 327 percent saying no? And yeah, so again, who knows how? I don't know if these are the most scientific polls in the world, but an interesting question. An interesting question, like if Web three disappeared, you know, how many would go back to picking up the paintbrush? I probably would. I'm sure I would. I wouldn't know what else to do with myself to a certain degree other than, you know, talk to you every well, which is pretty fun actually. Let's continue here. So interesting provocation there from relax in the poll.
00:53:43.934 - 00:54:05.076, Speaker A: So this is in Paris. So this happened I think last week, 25th to the 29th. So it's on right now. Crypto art version eight. Just a really cool ad in there is Romania's first in real life gallery. I don't know if that's the name of the gallery inaugurated at Crevoya Museum of Art. And there is a beautiful lily illo work.
00:54:05.076 - 00:54:36.596, Speaker A: And there are all the people. And there was also a show from Dina changing and Tim Sechenti, if I'm pronouncing that right, did a on cyber installation midnight arboretum, curated by Dina Chang. So let's just take a quick look here. I'm gonna mute the music in case it's copyright. So that is. Here's the beginning. And so just.
00:54:36.596 - 00:55:08.900, Speaker A: I guess this is just a somewhat of a teaser of the gallery, so to speak. But we have a work here today. Are there others? So yeah, so I guess that's just the intro. Here was a shot from Sabato work. So you see very wide angle, interestingly, from Skye Goodman here, viewing Sabato's work at the here and now Exp festival, curated by the Deana changing. So cool shot here. So I guess this is somewhere.
00:55:08.900 - 00:55:28.284, Speaker A: I'm not sure if this is the metaverse or I assume it's the metaverse, but I'm actually not sure. Here it is. Immersive experiences. Maybe it is somewhere, maybe it's in LA, I'm not sure. But there you see El Craygo, Empress trash, Lorna Mills, max capacity and Xerox. So very cool. Let's continue here.
00:55:28.284 - 00:55:41.666, Speaker A: We got a ton to get through. Luciana guerra cooking something. Very cool painting here. And I of course, follow Lucian Aguera on X. That is a x glitch. And here is Santiago painting here. So more works in progress.
00:55:41.666 - 00:56:06.338, Speaker A: So physical, you know, so a lot of people will be doing physical painting. That's almost the way to go, right, is to make physical while you're making digital as well. Donia. This one's really rad. Also, sorry for my footage is blurry, so I need a new phone case. So just more of these awesome phones that we see here from Donia, aka also known as let's glitch it. Really cool glitch.
00:56:06.338 - 00:56:16.154, Speaker A: Cameras. And this was hilarious too. Kodak. Every flea market has the camera guy found ours today. He said he's got tons more at his house too. Told him I'll buy him out next time. Hilarious.
00:56:16.154 - 00:56:46.758, Speaker A: And I followed Donia there, of course, as well. That is hilarious. So putting those cameras to good work. And here is Vinnie Hager with a cool physical here, big vase here. Kind of reminiscent of some of those, almost like kind of ming vase type thing, but with Vinnie Hager's Mark making over top. Adam Dissolve, plotter, Twitter. Pretty nice, pretty precise work here.
00:56:46.758 - 00:57:10.396, Speaker A: Another very interesting physical, beautiful neutro. So a few shots of the art residency that's going on. We're on day three, probably day four today. We started the day experimenting with a beautiful technique, cyanotype. And so here's some cyanotype here, as you see the blue and there. Let's just see if we can go through it. So, yeah, this is classic kind of cyanotype.
00:57:10.396 - 00:57:46.056, Speaker A: I've never actually done it, but you see how powerful it is as a medium, right? So very cool there. And you see all the results. So just very interesting to see the residency. We got a few more shots here, different rooms. So it's just all very impressive. The mood at collective neutron. So two locations, weird moments at bosque.
00:57:46.056 - 00:58:10.586, Speaker A: Gracias. So it's all pretty hilarious. I just wanted to highlight this because I thought it was great. Let me just stop that. And here is, I think, Emmy Emmipixel. I received this beautiful print of emmipixels on chain piece, artificial renaissance. Now, this is quite a rich black, and it'd be tempting to think it was a screen print from the richness of the black, but it looks like it is an inkjet.
00:58:10.586 - 00:58:34.298, Speaker A: So interesting to see this dithering here. And this is dithering for those that are wondering this kind of digital gradients of sorts, made of pixels. So interesting looking piece here. Nice kind of simple color, two color work there. And here is ratcloak on a t shirt courtesy of Mikey de la creme, who, of course, I follow. That is an exclge. Say hello to my little friend Ratcloak.
00:58:34.298 - 00:58:51.168, Speaker A: So on a t shirt. So that is RAD. And continuing on, spoogles all over the place here. People are doing things all around the world. So here's some of SpuegEL's work. Very interesting display here. Unique, I would argue.
00:58:51.168 - 00:59:08.222, Speaker A: So Spiegel's doing very good. Spiegel's maskinen glitch. Garten LED setups available to purchase for collectors of the one of ones. So if you buy a one of one from SpiegEls. You get the physical. So very cool there. And I believe that is sprigls, Spiegels Maskinen.
00:59:08.222 - 00:59:34.354, Speaker A: There will be in the garden from twelve to two, drop by or right if you want to say hi. So isn't that great? Congratulations and looks awesome and great to see spiegels there. Let's continue here. Finally, object has created their own paint program. And it's just like paint Microsoft paint. Dive into nostalgia with object paint 98. Create your masterpiece in our MS paint web interface and mint it directly to object.
00:59:34.354 - 01:00:06.812, Speaker A: So very cool. Taking a page so it kind of looks like, and I have no idea, maybe this initiative was around for a while, but it seems like Zora is borrowing from object and object is borrowing from Zora, seemingly. I don't know that for a fact. All to say, I think it's awesome. That's what all these platforms should be doing, is taking all the great ideas from that public platform. Like, you know, why not incorporate following and notifications if you're Zora? Why not incorporate a paint program if you're object? Makes a lot of sense to me. Here it is.
01:00:06.812 - 01:00:35.858, Speaker A: Actually, I haven't even tried it. I loaded it up and I wonder if we can make this bigger. So it's very fun to work with limitations, isn't it? So here it is. And then you can just probably put all this in and hit mint. So if you don't have any software now, can you affect, surely you can affect the size. I don't know how though. So all to say, you know, just very cool.
01:00:35.858 - 01:00:48.826, Speaker A: So obviously need to learn how to use that. But that's it on object. And here's Suizoichi. Suizoichi. The app is so cool. Go try it. So much has a lot more dexterity than I do there on the paint program.
01:00:48.826 - 01:01:05.878, Speaker A: And here's another kind of beautiful work here. This is by mighty moss minted, my first piece using paint 98. That was fun. So cool work there. And I think this was, this is also object. So cool work here by human boy. Let's see if we can make it larger here.
01:01:05.878 - 01:01:32.382, Speaker A: And some nice dithering going on. So pretty cool, isn't it? So from human boy. So that is three Tazos edition of 15 so cool initiative. And you can see it on object paint 98 here. As we finally dive into the art here. So I'll have to figure out how to make bigger brushes. Here is a beautiful work by Santiago as we begin an hour and 1 minute in three hidden rolls of language.
01:01:32.382 - 01:01:54.130, Speaker A: This was brilliant. This could have started the show. It is beautiful. It is a new kind of, you know, Santiago is trying stuff out here. I love, I think it's the negative space that I love here. And you see this almost looks like waffle draws. And we have a few works from waffle draws, but this is combining waffle drawers.
01:01:54.130 - 01:02:26.562, Speaker A: This looks like physical, doesn't it? So all sorts of stuff, and I love these kind of threads that move in and out, all this different mark making, all these details. And then we zoom out and we get this grand abstract here. So just very cool work. Three hidden rules of language. Love the title from Santiago Tentezos, edition of five foregone. So one left there, get it while you can. This is an, so SaNtiago doing some incredibly interesting experiments here.
01:02:26.562 - 01:03:00.320, Speaker A: Here's another one with a abstract, kind of a minimal abstract work with some marks and then putting some gif behind and changing the colors. Very interesting. Just very, very interesting. And here's the waffles draw program. We've seen this before, Santiago, since we're on Santiago, I guess it's the one year anniversary of a drawing tool, I think inspired by hastruba waffle, if I'm not mistaken. And here, as you see, you can try this out somewhere. I think there's even a, you go to waffle draws.
01:03:00.320 - 01:03:37.190, Speaker A: Waffle draw, wafflesdraw Tez page maybe, or waffle draw. Tez, I think is where you go, I'm not sure where you go celebrating waffles. So there is one work, this is guru guru hyena with a work here. So a really cool tool that you see here. And here's another one, this is also guru guru hyena, so cool kind of brush sampler here. Again, using JavaScript tools one could imagine again, and I mentioned this a long time ago, that in the future one could imagine artists making their own software. It's just like this, right? And to get their work.
01:03:37.190 - 01:04:02.756, Speaker A: And then how would you ever copy that? Right? So very interesting. But then these guys, it's all open source, so very interesting. And I think now, experimentalwafflesdraw dot blogspot.com so cedar plank, aka waffles, chimed in here. Not sure, but I just used the triangle, square, circle one at blogspot. No clue which version. So you know what's funny about this? It kind of looks like hasdrubal waffles, kinda.
01:04:02.756 - 01:04:40.924, Speaker A: You see it in the expressions here and the kind of the mark making, interestingly so cool work there. And continuing on, Yuri J. Who we had the extended discussion on at the opening there with a really cool abstract here with a ladybug emoji. Just another interesting abstract that I hadn't seen before. I love the red kind of surrounding here too. Gives it a lot of spirit or background, we might say. This was interesting and it was just posted by naturalictourism, who I do follow GM and here just I think.
01:04:40.924 - 01:05:10.068, Speaker A: I'm not sure if we've looked at this and it may be older, but I thought it was just a beautiful painting that we could put in with the abstracts. A beautiful piece. Not sure where it's minted if at all. Emilia Versace with a couple of abstracts here. This is part of emergent properties, so these are kind of AI abstracts, but they fit so nicely over here, I thought I'd add them in color therapy. Part three, long form generative AI powered by M props minting today, and that was February 23, so they are available. So pretty nice looking abstracts there.
01:05:10.068 - 01:05:35.232, Speaker A: Again, the textures from emergent properties are very rich. Here's another nice piece. Safe Dave, understanding your surroundings. It looks physical. I'm not sure anymore, but I suspect this is a physical kind of a cool work. Has a bit of a, I don't know, maybe a bit of a surreal, almost like like elements of de Chirico, elements of Kandinsky. Kind of a modern feeling to it.
01:05:35.232 - 01:05:52.304, Speaker A: It definitely looks like painting from here these days. I'm not sure anymore. This could be impromptu for all I know, but I think it's just physical painting. This is interesting too. LXt Xcx corrupted folder mania. And this is kind of a vaporwave work. So interesting.
01:05:52.304 - 01:06:11.438, Speaker A: And let's zoom in here. You see a little bit of physical texture on this work that I thought just another nice addition here for our abstract section. Just interesting piece. Cool. And the fact that it's vaporwave and corrupted folder mania. Interesting work here is mumble boy with another work. Seismic.
01:06:11.438 - 01:06:41.516, Speaker A: This is an edition of two as we continue with our abstracts here. All sorts of interesting abstracts coming in. And again, this could hang well with the Santiago work, with all of the kind of chaotic detail, but all treated and all considered seemingly contamination. Also an addition of two, changing up the color scheme a little bit here. And again, interesting piece here, and fuzzy and sharp. A lot of contrast going on here. A lot of different works.
01:06:41.516 - 01:07:08.264, Speaker A: Kind of looks like physical, kind of looks like digital. Interesting piece. That is an edition of two. And this was posted in the community Ruslan core and I thought a pretty nice work here on Solana. This is exchange art, and be nice if they had that zoom tool in here, too. Kind of has a bit of a CGI feeling to it and kind of an abstract here. Almost looks like a windows butterfly here, with a little bit of Wi fi, perhaps.
01:07:08.264 - 01:07:30.678, Speaker A: Interesting piece. This is an edition of one, I think, and 3d art. And this is, for one solution, the reserve sound in my shadow. That's Ruslan core or rustlen on exchange art. And here's Gozo. This feels like it could hang in the same show here. Failed the moon animated digital collage by Gozo.
01:07:30.678 - 01:07:50.968, Speaker A: This just came out February 23. So adding, I think the other works we've seen from Gozo are static. So adding a little bit of different renderings here in this work. Interesting textures here. Almost looks like a coffin with a rose on it. Kind of a surreal. Again, another surreal looking work.
01:07:50.968 - 01:08:04.904, Speaker A: Animated digital collage by gozo. 1080 by 1080 edition of 25. And taking offers. And they're coming in pretty high here. So nice work for Gozo. Continuing axin with a couple of works here. I thought this was quite brilliant, actually.
01:08:04.904 - 01:08:40.936, Speaker A: And happy birthday to Axin, who I believe just celebrated yesterday on Sunday. And here is a beautiful kind of headphones and a happy face here without the head, I thought was quite brilliant here. And we had another one, I believe. I thought this was quite brilliant, too, putting hype. And you have the monks with the skeleton kind of hand, but it's all small, which I thought was quite brilliant. It reminds you of the inferno, where in the inferno, the devil is huge. And then I was listening to a lecture on the paradiso, which I haven't gotten to yet, apparently.
01:08:40.936 - 01:09:10.960, Speaker A: It's just, you know, when you get to God at the end of Dante's divine comedy, it's this tiny little thing, you know, this little light that's kind of dancing. I haven't read it, but that is so I kind of, when I see this kind of a big thing, like hype, but made small. So interesting move with the sizing here. Huge kind of margin here. Interesting. Very kind of smart image making, as usual from Uxie. And here's grimoire anxiety with the surveillance camera here.
01:09:10.960 - 01:09:30.124, Speaker A: A little bit of the facial recognition software going on here, or whatever you would call that. And here, just kind of almost like a classical statue. This is ten Tezos edition of ten. And not sure there are two owners so far. I miss this one. The failed artist. Number 69, self portrait.
01:09:30.124 - 01:09:47.866, Speaker A: One of my favorite series ever on the blockchain. Tezos veteran homeless. Please help. Great textures there. And beautiful. Look at how great the painterliness is in the hand. As we look up close at the failed artist here at large with the McDonald's hat.
01:09:47.866 - 01:10:12.814, Speaker A: I just love this theme. And here are some employees and there is a cactus interestingly. And tezos veteran homeless, please help, I think lost his job at McDonald's and there's McPurgatory over there. Paint stripper, do not consume. And there is the cast. So just hilarious. Beautiful work here from wasteman gold Minovitch.
01:10:12.814 - 01:10:23.074, Speaker A: Is that sold out? It's sold out. Good work. Oh no. There's one for three tazos. There's four left for three tazos. Get it while you can. Another work by wasteman Goldman guided by voices.
01:10:23.074 - 01:10:56.694, Speaker A: And here this is just a cool painting too as you see the KFC there. Carefully painted super prolific artist as we pointed out and I think that's the name of a band but kind of used as inspiration maybe for a work. Interesting piece. Enigmatic and kind of dark with this skull on the tv and the sky. Yeah so provocative, provocative work there from Uistman Goldman, Lukes Migone. This was just posted there on twitter. Kind of almost looks physical but I suspect it's digital.
01:10:56.694 - 01:11:34.078, Speaker A: Interesting color combo I thought beautiful color combo. And here you see bodies and skeletons dancing between shadows and skeletons. Very cool. John's still life's window. Still life number 110. And here we see another work in John's kind of, you know, new series as far as I know so kind of interestingly, kind of painterly series here by John, you know, who often has the skeletons working out. A very interesting piece here and selling for 50 tezos edition of 25 and there are seven buyers so far.
01:11:34.078 - 01:12:25.754, Speaker A: And continuing on Nuv 1914 with another really interesting work monedas not sure what that one is, what that one means. And nice big work here, nice experimentation is ever cool use of color putting again, always pushing the envelope of what is, you know, quote unquote aesthetically acceptable here like would you put, would you ever make. And one question you can ask yourself is would I ever put like a work like that on top of a work like this and make, you know, maybe but I don't think I've ever done that, you know, like so I'll just say upsetting aesthetic expectations as I always like to say here, just a great artist. Nuv 1914 and that was an edition of three and all three selling for $7.50 each. Uri J. Picking up the first one.
01:12:25.754 - 01:13:21.342, Speaker A: Quilanina, sacred fire. Cool work here by Quila Nina who sometimes I like to call, you know, in the tradition of kind of visionary artists at Argentina and Peru, if I remember right, interesting blue cloud. I believe this is a digital painting. This one, interesting plant here, kind of looks like the tree of life, also looks like a marijuana plant. And here just, you know, it kind of has this kind of mystical folk art kind of feel to it. There's some amanita muscaria mushrooms there and a, you know, hallucinatory snake, and then someone passing on the brew, and you almost wonder, is this ayahuasca here? Hard to say. And the priestess here, so to speak, with, what would you call this again? Not a wand, maybe a wand or a caduska or something.
01:13:21.342 - 01:13:39.754, Speaker A: There's a word for that. And then sacred fire. So powerful work, as you see here, kind of mystical artwork, edition of one. And accepting an offer of only 15 tezos. Good deal there. And here is die with the most, like. So, of course I follow good meat.
01:13:39.754 - 01:14:05.418, Speaker A: And I thought this was hilarious doing the zodiac here. And here we see all the different constellations, but they're all meat. So hilarious. They're continuing on Uyoh 66, the archangel. Again, continuing with this 3d kind of feel here. So I imagine if you put on those traditional red and blue glasses, this will start to look 3d. So there's Mike, and here's caliburn.
01:14:05.418 - 01:14:30.218, Speaker A: All these different kind of characters here. Kind of has a 1950s kind of feel, Looney tunes feel to it edition of one transferred. So all sorts of interesting mechanics going on. This was an interesting piece I saw on x, Sergei Verisayev. And this is on foundation. This is actually from a few years or, sorry, a few months ago, a typical landing in a typical apartment building in Berlin. And I thought that was pretty funny.
01:14:30.218 - 01:15:01.994, Speaker A: And just a nice, interesting illustration here. Nice color. And here is Ciba Sestaro, who I also follow, neural data processing. Another interesting take who's been playing with memory, psychological spaces, things you remember. Really interesting piece. I'm really enjoying this exploration here into the unknown, into this representation of psychological remembering, neural data processing. Cool title two.
01:15:01.994 - 01:15:27.066, Speaker A: And here is Spontor, who I haven't seen work from for a while, pool party. And here, kind of a looser work by smaunter here. Always having an interesting angle on the shot and people at the pool, always an interesting composition with smaunter, pool party. And here is Katarina create. This is an edition of ten for five tezos. And picking up a lot of buyers. Here is this.
01:15:27.066 - 01:15:56.434, Speaker A: Sold out, one left, and that's on secondary. So actually this went for one tezos each. So a cool work here, a nice kind of painterliness, so to speak. In this kind of illustration that is animated like a gif from Katarina. Create kind of cool drawn pixels there in the socks. Really nice and cool kind of framing here in the margins with the. And contrasting well with the static parts of the work.
01:15:56.434 - 01:16:18.410, Speaker A: The moving parts contrasting with this nice red static background. Cool work. The leka interpretation of a painting by ukrainian female artist Maria Primachenko. So maybe a homage of sorts there. And here is pipi universal with what looks like James Brown. There is the. And we can't actually, there is a way to zoom in, but I'm not going to do it right now.
01:16:18.410 - 01:16:50.608, Speaker A: Someone told me how to zoom in on mp4 s. Actually, we can try, I think in safari you can zoom in on the mp4 s. So interesting work here. Experimental work with a bit of a drone from PB Universal, Afro funk, psycho seventies. And that is seven tazos and edition of five here is Saiko, also known as score, spiritual glow. A cool. A cool animated work here using probably touch designer.
01:16:50.608 - 01:17:11.604, Speaker A: And you see the beautiful animations here, so. And interesting, again, contrasting with the staticness of the figure here, these moving areas. It just makes it more poetic, I would argue. So. Powerful move. Minted 0.01 ETH by score mid journey and touch designer and Adobe.
01:17:11.604 - 01:17:30.084, Speaker A: Interesting piece, 0.01. Not sure if there are. I think there might be more in the collection. Here's the work by Sabato at an hour. And 17 here, ocean wide. And this is 1472 by 566. Interestingly, multiplied by three.
01:17:30.084 - 01:17:47.288, Speaker A: The apocalypse will blossom. So kind of a mysterious work here. I assume Sabato made this for a stage for Dina Chang's show there. And there's Paul. Awesome. And, you know, some nice dithering in the background. So I assume for that large projector space.
01:17:47.288 - 01:18:35.216, Speaker A: So adapting the artwork to the canvas and interesting subject to do that, which is kind of what looks. It's almost like it's commenting on that very issue with what looks like a building here. Right. And how would you portray a building? It's almost like an extreme kind of pressing in of the composition, compressing of the composition here of this vertical building with this very horizontal move. So seemingly, you know, cropping in it. All done on purpose, it looks like, to me, making a comment, it seems, on canvas size, interestingly, fossils gamma with another one of these really cool walkers here, with all of this kind of noise in the background. That's three Tezos edition of 16 as we continue to run here, arm drop.
01:18:35.216 - 01:18:53.728, Speaker A: This is also a new. You see some beautiful dithering there in the arm. It's another interesting animation by the ever prolific gamma. And here we have Madant's beautiful pixel artwork. Look how minimal this is. You gotta love this kind of minimal. Big pixels here.
01:18:53.728 - 01:19:17.040, Speaker A: You can tell it's someone kind of, or a bug or something or someone dancing. But it's become abstract, you know, it's been turned into pixels. Madans raw. So very cool work from Francois Gamma. And here's Jean Provencher, I think with more just super interesting work. It looks like dune processed in a certain way. I just love Jean Provencher's work.
01:19:17.040 - 01:19:24.884, Speaker A: I don't know what else to say. Other people do too. 136 retweets. Nice work. Haha. John X. I wonder if these are minted.
01:19:24.884 - 01:19:51.412, Speaker A: I don't know if Jean Provencher mints Renato touch grass or put life into a folder. So just an interesting pixel artwork here as we see kind of the folder. You know, it's like operating system landscape meets actual landscape here. So playing with these different spaces here by Renato. A pretty interesting piece. Raffle t shirt, Pam. So this is Pamelo Cerone.
01:19:51.412 - 01:20:06.594, Speaker A: One of one. Unique. So there's a raffle for a one of one. So I think you mint here to enter the raffle, I believe, here. And so just cool, more exciting, fun work. Where do you see this eight by eight work? GM Tezos fan. Let's see if it works.
01:20:06.594 - 01:20:40.204, Speaker A: I thought this, you know, because we've seen the eight by eight, many of us have worked with eight bidoo. The eight x eight pixel structure here. Big pixels. I thought this was a really interesting solution where Pamelo makes it his own by, you see, the colors, the texture, and then just the rhythm of the work. And it's completely recognizable as Pamelo's, even though it's just pixels blinking. Pretty cool, if you ask me. So, continuing on, Murray pixel, as we run through this episode.
01:20:40.204 - 01:20:59.094, Speaker A: Hard to say if there's AI in here. I love the experimental nature of this work. Kind of feels like manga or anime here. Almost looks like a death star, but it's all super processed, edgy work here. Seven minted by Murray pixel, if I'm not mistaken. There. That's on Zora.
01:20:59.094 - 01:21:26.914, Speaker A: Just super cool work there. Here's Reykjay's. We've looked at a few works, I think, by Ray Kay's. This is another super interesting kind of horizontal, you know, ratioed pixels here, with someone made of flowers on profile, seemingly. And here's element li with a kind of unusual work here. Seems to be working with a thicker pencil here. Doesn't it look that way in this kind of odd work with the small person on top? Observation, 200 of 200 pixels.
01:21:26.914 - 01:21:48.954, Speaker A: 200 by 200 pixels. And you see the hand kind of partly done. And then here's some pixels. Just super original artwork, Shukak by Stalomere. This is an edition of 33, and they're 20 tezos now. And they've all been transferred. So there is one of these kind of monsters here, and someone almost like a Star wars scene here.
01:21:48.954 - 01:22:04.374, Speaker A: And there's Stalamere's signature down here. I love it. That is super cool. So cool. Sci-Fi pixel art from Stalomere. Here's Svezer, if I'm not mistaken, the rise. And this is on object as well.
01:22:04.374 - 01:22:23.224, Speaker A: Edition of ten for three tazos. So interesting. Kind of different, you know, sections of pixelation here. Very interesting piece here. And then a lot of static at the bottom, a lot of movement on top. You have these two kind of noise areas here. You have the bugs that move once in a while.
01:22:23.224 - 01:22:33.492, Speaker A: Interesting piece. Edition of ten. Again, three tezos. Three are gone. Sabato picking one up, continuing on. Green ginger. This was a fun one.
01:22:33.492 - 01:23:07.374, Speaker A: So again, I think this is playing with a certain software where, or at least as a reference, which kind of puts things, because we've seen a lot of works that have this kind of architectural space, shall we say, cozy Monday pixel art. So turning, you know, you see one of these kind of lie down couches and some retro lamps. Just a cool living room space. Cool piece. We have another work by green Ginger here. Now they're using pick square, which is a pretty cool, as you'll see here. I find it a touch awkward using it, but I think.
01:23:07.374 - 01:23:36.586, Speaker A: I think you could get used to it, though. Hey, like, I've probably put like four or 5 hours into pick square, so not a ton. Green Ginger here, looking like they're doing a lot more work. They have grouped layers here and everything. And really interesting putting in this kind of angled piece, and then putting in van Gogh, using van Gogh as a reference here. We were mentioning this before, not tracing directly, but just kind of eyeing it and making a pixel artwork out of it. Quite beautifully, I might add.
01:23:36.586 - 01:23:51.002, Speaker A: So this is a work in progress, intentionally missing one element. We have a plan to work on it. What do you guys think? I think it's beautiful. Do we have another one? I think we do. If it loads up, we shall see. It did. And that looks like the scream.
01:23:51.002 - 01:24:14.006, Speaker A: So another interesting piece here. As we go into the hour 23 mark. I'm going to speed up a bit here. This is by Pixel magic or sorry, this is by Takeshoshi, I think, from a series called Pixel Magic. Fade away shot. So interesting pixel artwork with a little bit of sports, interesting patterning at the bottom here. And I love the way that the people are done here.
01:24:14.006 - 01:24:29.134, Speaker A: Just an interesting piece on Zora. This is Elie Lo. Let's see if we can get this to play. Trash bag season two, episode six. I sold them to Hispanic. Awesome. Not in the sky.
01:24:29.134 - 01:24:58.530, Speaker A: It lay right there along the rotten wasted pieces of the monster which call itself society. Things with dawn seems necessary. The x parts of the dream life degrees around being attempted to fill the pretty rad. Big shout out to Elie Lo, who left a comment there earlier. Pretty nice piece there. Digging the music. Tape cassette audio.
01:24:58.530 - 01:25:11.818, Speaker A: So that may have been. Hopefully we don't have any copyright issues there. Tape cassette audio. All to say, really interesting piece. That is only a Tezos 40. And that is on object. There are nine left.
01:25:11.818 - 01:25:29.270, Speaker A: You can still pick one up. Moving work, that music. Powerful trilobite who I follow. Nice piece. Kind of combining things almost like this character animation with a whole bunch of kind of chaos in the. Almost like fractal chaos. That's hard to focus on.
01:25:29.270 - 01:25:56.720, Speaker A: Speaking of fractals, here is Louise Andre Gammer, a great fractal artist, I believe. A fractal artist we could call at least in this series here. So interesting color scheme. Here's another one just posted on X. And these are doing pretty well, as you can see here. So just interesting work there. Here's datura with an addition of one, which means dream in or treume Tudrim, maybe in German there.
01:25:56.720 - 01:26:17.600, Speaker A: Trauma traum with no unglaut. There is dream. I don't know, trume might be something different in German here. Anyway, nice piece. Cool colors. Automatic memory is a series, a one of one for 60 tezos. And here is Kyle Flemmer and dither combining.
01:26:17.600 - 01:26:36.564, Speaker A: So Kyle Flemmer's work in the tv, of course, dither doing the tv itself. And there we see some stickers and patches and everything. And there is a Kyle Flemmer work inside edition of 20 for 250. And they are just. And here they are. And they're selling. So I think they might all actually be sold out.
01:26:36.564 - 01:26:53.432, Speaker A: This GLB, there's one left. One left. So nice sale there. Here's of course, curo Badonk. And another video glitch, animated abstract, shall we say here. So cool work here. Familiar color scheme here.
01:26:53.432 - 01:27:18.022, Speaker A: Interesting composition from Quiro. And this was interesting too. I love the title because I remember there was a work that or Carl Malone. Not the title, but there's Roberto Baggio is at the start of this. Who of course missed the penalty shot for Italy. One of the ideas that I touched in my film Roberto. Is the fact that many football matches are decided by imponderable details.
01:27:18.022 - 01:27:43.082, Speaker A: And unlike in other sports where there are rounds, sets or rematches to verify the winner deviation. We can't watch the whole thing. But I had to show the Roberto bad show part afterwards. Things that seem nice crop too or nice cut, nice edit where you don't see the thing. It just kind of stops with bad Joe pondering the ball. Very nice. So all to say it's two minutes.
01:27:43.082 - 01:27:58.050, Speaker A: We can't watch the whole thing. But very interesting work from augurs. Also known as Enrique Cartaho. Augurs on object. That is an edition of 32 for 15 tezos. There are ten owners so far. Here's Renki.
01:27:58.050 - 01:28:14.272, Speaker A: Edition of one Sana. And another interesting piece here. As we see the light shift across this abstract kind of situation. Geometric situation here. How are we doing for time? Hour 28. I do not want this to be a habit. Walk 1027.
01:28:14.272 - 01:28:28.504, Speaker A: So another September 11 piece here. I think we had so much commentary at the start of this show. So this is settled for six tezos. So they're starting to go up. This is quite a beautiful one too. With the light here of the walks. September 11 series.
01:28:28.504 - 01:28:42.144, Speaker A: Here's another open edition. One running. And this is an edition of. So this is six tezos. And maybe you get it. Maybe if there aren't too many people that mint, you might luck out here. Interesting work.
01:28:42.144 - 01:29:01.004, Speaker A: Almost looks like a toreador, but not sure running. Maybe someone running here. Interesting piece. And mechanism there from walk. Here's bosque gracias with a couple summer. And again these are the original colors of the negatives here from. And interestingly, putting one upside down.
01:29:01.004 - 01:29:21.794, Speaker A: I'm managing to keep things creative here from bosque gracias. Very nice edition of two. Here's another piece using the purple with this dark sweet purple dream. So another beautiful work here from this awesome series. Native textures. And that is an edition of two for ten tezos. One is available for ten tezos.
01:29:21.794 - 01:29:53.324, Speaker A: And continuing on, this was posted in the community. This is simulacro. I think they're out of Argentina. Kind of glitchy. Glitchy work here. So pretty interesting. Cool audio there too.
01:29:53.324 - 01:30:08.426, Speaker A: So called resonance. This is an edition of twelve. And it looks like it sold out at six tezos each. Nice work. So simulacro, you know, someone was messaging like, oh, maybe you should have other artists. You do it in the community. That's how people.
01:30:08.426 - 01:30:27.854, Speaker A: That's how I find out about new artists from people. Just post it in the community if you see someone that you think should be on the show. So very cool there from simulacro. Cool name too. Here's Martin Jo. Kinky base God. So let me get some audio, kind of a shorter video, 8 seconds.
01:30:27.854 - 01:30:45.434, Speaker A: And this is on manifold. And we see the zipper. It almost looks like a tes noun, doesn't it? So interesting piece there. 0.002 ETH on again Manifold from Martin Joe. Here's Mo. Shit.
01:30:45.434 - 01:31:11.048, Speaker A: Are you dead? Yes is the answer in the description. And there we see. So we're going to see a little bit of CGI. But I want to preface it with just this work here because it was an interesting combination of the CGi and kind of reusing a piece, I think perhaps, or repeating it and then with a little bit of animation. That's an edition of 15 for three tazos. And then here's another one by Moshit. This is an edition of one.
01:31:11.048 - 01:31:29.902, Speaker A: And this sold, both selling to Somfei. This one for eleven tazos. Kind of looks like the original, doesn't it? Again, looks like CGI. I was saying an earlier episode. Maybe this is AI. It's not according to Mo. Here's Retro Manny with a GLB here, a virtual sculpture.
01:31:29.902 - 01:31:49.228, Speaker A: Orion Starbase. So continuing the theme here. So cool work. And this trophy is worth the 800 retro Manny. And here you is this. So this was transferred maybe to previous collectors or so. Eleven editions, trophy zero two.
01:31:49.228 - 01:32:09.060, Speaker A: Orion Starbase. Nice glb here and even cool pixelation there underneath. And here is no hygiene. With a few more experimental works for us. Leg zero, this is an edition of one. This is eight tazos. Again, kind of feeling kind of data over here, isn't it? In no hygiene's works.
01:32:09.060 - 01:32:42.294, Speaker A: I thought this one was a standout index hole. This is twelve tezos. Pretty interesting, you know, just new visual experiences here, courtesy of no hygiene's raw. Very raw AI. Extremely raw AI from no hygiene kick. Another just wild series taking huge, I'd say, aesthetic risks here, which is what I am celebrating here. Who'd ever do this? And is this just raw AI? Maybe some collage involved, who knows? Novel imagery courtesy of no hygiene.
01:32:42.294 - 01:33:03.374, Speaker A: Again, hastruba waffle highlighting that a couple of months ago, this artist aylay rare Rome sun. So a few more horse works here. Maybe for the horse trading. This one's from Ilay and we are still recording here. Okay, awesome. And so another cool AI artwork from ilay. Maybe made with improps.
01:33:03.374 - 01:33:13.654, Speaker A: Interestingly. Just very nice and painterly. Emperops is amazing. The textures that they get there. Here's a work by tewks. An interesting painting here. More on the experimental side.
01:33:13.654 - 01:33:33.308, Speaker A: When you talk with people in the dark, GM. So tewks constantly working, one assumes an AI artwork where Tewks focus is right now. Again, coming out of glitch. Lily illo with an interesting piece here. Pick up sticks Sunday. And again, almost recognizable Lily illo colors here. And you have pickup sticks.
01:33:33.308 - 01:33:50.568, Speaker A: So an interesting AI artwork here. Half abstract, half figurative. And here, another really cool chair that has been abstracted. And of course, I follow Lily Illo. Very cool. Orange in the background here. Outrageous shadow.
01:33:50.568 - 01:34:08.998, Speaker A: Well done, Lily Illo. Just very cool work here. Boiling it down too. It's just the wall and the floor and weird shadows with these kind of abstracted chairs. Just super cool. Here's strange thing. And we're commenting, let me.
01:34:08.998 - 01:35:13.196, Speaker A: So you know, again now let's think of Kunz here. So Kunz painting, or at least the team painting, the little cracks of the oil paint simulating here, you know, you see the simulation, really, of the photography, probably from the source images, but the simulation of the photography of the painting, conceptually quite interesting, I would argue adding some personal touches here with the pixelation here. And again you see this kind of physicality, which again, reminds me of coons here, you know, not as intense on this one. And then they're a vision pro with a renaissance, you know. So again, even combining the Renaissance clothing with modern clothing in a pretty powerful way, I have to say. And then here, just classic kind of, you know, 17th century to Renaissance like, you know, what do you say? Foliage, trees? It's been an hour and 35 minutes, my friend. Please forgive me, Mister Bizzold.
01:35:13.196 - 01:35:38.374, Speaker A: This is awesome. Nice work, besold. So, AI artwork here, right? You can see it in the faces, raw. AI love the color contrast. And then you see it being taped here to this backing board where the work is being done to, you know, a wooden plank, you know, where you often put your drawing, tape your drawings to. To a drawing board of sorts. Really, really, really cool.
01:35:38.374 - 01:35:58.274, Speaker A: From Mister Bezold, edition of six. And none listed yet, maybe just minted. Here's more in that series. Here's number six, edition of four. And again, just super interesting here. And again, you can see the AI, when you look up close, beautiful texture here. Over here, though.
01:35:58.274 - 01:36:31.250, Speaker A: I don't know what John Bezold is doing, but it's pretty powerful. Or Mister Besold, I should say, is doing, but super powerful. And here's one more. This is an addition of four, and I don't know if any of these have been listed yet. Just again, outside, providing an awesome contrast and kind of creating a meta layer. Right, like a metaphrame to read this internal story in. Pretty cool, right? Again, there's something almost kind of classical and postmodern at the same time.
01:36:31.250 - 01:36:59.334, Speaker A: And that kind of structure there, eudaimonia, which I believe is greek for happiness. I believe in the nicomachean ethics by Aristotle. That is what you want. You want, which is, like, true, like, not happiness is like an emotion, but, like, inner peace. And eudaimonia is kind of the goal of ethics, I think. But now I might be a bridge too far on that one. Anyways, interesting surreal artwork here from Elly Pritz, I believe, using AI.
01:36:59.334 - 01:37:16.004, Speaker A: I thought I saw AI somewhere on here. There it is, listed in AI. So interesting piece here. Huge eye. Definitely kind of has a surreal quality to it. And finally, as we wrap up here, here's Skomra with an abandoned building. Nice minimal piece.
01:37:16.004 - 01:37:36.944, Speaker A: You could easily screen print this skamra. Beautiful textures here. Really, you know, boiling it or really just working the textures there. And here's Mo again, who's putting out a ton of work. Faith, no more AI artwork here. And you see this wild. Again, more novel imagery courtesy of AI.
01:37:36.944 - 01:37:59.044, Speaker A: Just, you know, this interesting textures here. And not a huge work. This is the full size. And you see this wild ship here with texture. And here's another one by Mo, almost using the matrix. The numbers coming down from the matrix. Pretty hilarious with this textile texture here.
01:37:59.044 - 01:38:16.150, Speaker A: And continuing on here is Danielle King, GM lovelies. Really interesting AI photo here. You can tell in the chair. I believe this is AI. Very interesting piece. I think Lorna Mills posted. That's how I saw it.
01:38:16.150 - 01:38:44.254, Speaker A: I think she was saying, I love this composition and great light and everything. Just a really cool piece. And this was posted in the community. Very cool work. Frank Cappa just wanted to share my artwork link. So interesting piece here with this woman kind of flying through the air and people with smiles on their faces here as something is going on, but surprisingly happy as we see the smoke coming from the car here. So interesting AI artwork here.
01:38:44.254 - 01:39:00.802, Speaker A: And continuing on, venta to anus after Daniel Richter. So venta times AI. So using Daniel Richter as inspiration here. And we see Venta's kind of skulls. Obviously an AI artwork. Kind of has a 3d feel to it. Interesting piece.
01:39:00.802 - 01:39:34.934, Speaker A: 30 tezos edition of one. And this is Shilly Preston, who I definitely follow there. That is a Twitter glitch, reading up on how we all die alone. And interesting work here in AI with a nose on the skull, hilariously here, and almost like a hip on the bones here. Interesting piece from Shilly Preston. And here's demon ego, who I think is working with AI now and playing with all sorts of different mediums in a kind of experimental period here. Very interesting work here.
01:39:34.934 - 01:39:54.780, Speaker A: Always combining things. The great combiner, demon ego, transitory. Another interesting work here. This looks like more mid journey, like recent mid journey work here. One imagines so pretty detailed work here. Pretty wild work. And blueprints in the background.
01:39:54.780 - 01:40:11.776, Speaker A: Interesting piece. This is an edition of one for 30 tezos. And here is a work by. So, working all across all mediums here. Demon ego. Here you see some collage with some colored pencils working on different layers. Really cool work there.
01:40:11.776 - 01:40:41.026, Speaker A: Just a GM from demon ego. And here is Yoa Osalazar, a work in progress here. And getting back into it here, I think, after a little break. And this looks like acrylics, doesn't it? So you see kind of the early stages, kind of blocking off these different sections of Yoao's work. And I think we have a later one, too, which I think we may have seen before. But a cool work, I think there was an interesting title here, if I am not mistaken. Reminiscence, there was.
01:40:41.026 - 01:41:02.506, Speaker A: And so kind of nostalgia. There's the Rubik's cube and everything. Old computers, teddy bears, and there's a skull looking on, made of plasticine. Everything made of plasticine. This was super interesting. This is Oichie Shohei, who, I feel like I've seen their work before. And this shoe just kind of smushed.
01:41:02.506 - 01:41:17.766, Speaker A: And this is a three dimensional work, I believe, as you can tell from here. So wild piece here. Wild art object. I didn't realize it was layered like that, physically. Exactly. Josh. Here's Martin Bruce with another interesting work.
01:41:17.766 - 01:41:29.438, Speaker A: Look how beautiful that water is. The colored water there. Another. And then the plants just kind of left in there. Super edgy work from Martin Bruce. And there's something else from Martin I wanted to show. Look at this.
01:41:29.438 - 01:41:47.338, Speaker A: So we see the famous bear, what I call the famous bear. Now look at it. You gotta love this treatment here. And I don't know if this was just a casual move here, but I love this. I love this kind of retreatment. It's a completely different work. Lunas by Martin Bruce.
01:41:47.338 - 01:42:06.770, Speaker A: So just looking like there's a show going on there on February 24, and then finally, a few physicals here. Moto Motohiro, whose work we've seen before. Hilarious, interesting. Really cool, kind of retro feeling artists there. Tim Lahan. Interesting work here. We've seen some of Tim's work before.
01:42:06.770 - 01:42:22.322, Speaker A: Never like that. DZ Vigne studio. Interesting, almost interesting. Kind of modernist feel to this painting here. And Polykymart, here's another. We may have seen this one before. Not sure I thought.
01:42:22.322 - 01:42:32.562, Speaker A: Interesting addition of purple and nicely painted. Sold. Heaven on earth. Fresh off the easel. So this is new. This is poly Kim art. And this was interesting too.
01:42:32.562 - 01:42:56.674, Speaker A: Cas land. Beautiful color in this one, isn't there? Just kind of a simple, weird one. I like it. Eleven by 14 inch wood panel, acrylic oil pastel pencil, helter skelter to the sky. So super interesting. Really beautiful one here by Bondozo bandito, Casper Johns. And we have caspar the ghost with a gumball machine.
01:42:56.674 - 01:43:16.674, Speaker A: And we have a couple more here. Look at this. Three heads steel, better than one. So 210 by 190. So interesting experiments here. What I love about Bondozo Bandido, where I show a ton of Bondozo's work and actually has a. I think it's Hermes Cartaoho, if I'm not mistaken, is the name.
01:43:16.674 - 01:43:43.154, Speaker A: I just love the experimentation. Like, this is a courageous artist, in my opinion, is willing to try different things and try stuff out. Here's another one. Look at this. So we have these spears going into the work, just endlessly trying new things. You get the sense you're getting 100% of bondozos, of Hermes soul is going into his work, just communicating through art. This was super interesting.
01:43:43.154 - 01:43:58.850, Speaker A: Jokin Muhlen brink. Interesting concept here. Almost like a bathroom mirror here. Fuzzed, you know? And then you see the person, you know, glimpsing through with the drop here. Pretty interesting piece. This is on instagram. Here's another weird one.
01:43:58.850 - 01:44:14.436, Speaker A: Emma Beatriz with, like, a monster truck rally with a spider web on top and some script writing. Totally wild work here. It's not gallery. Posting it again, full credit. It's not gallery. Who really. Here's another one by.
01:44:14.436 - 01:44:34.298, Speaker A: It's not gallery. I mean, really on the forefront of what I call the new humor, and not all of it being humor here, but just like there is. But there is definitely a sense of humor to this work. Mario Ayala. And again, playing off the pop goes the world by men without hats. Great album, by the way. Canada's craftwork, I call them.
01:44:34.298 - 01:44:48.210, Speaker A: So anyways, nice pastiche here. I could never dream of making this. That is hilarious. Adam Lister studio. Looking like a Pokemon work here. And you see it in progress. Really manual in a sense.
01:44:48.210 - 01:45:13.384, Speaker A: Nothing too fancy on how this is made. Very interesting there. And finally, Cyberkid original drawing by invader. And if you look closely, I don't know if you probably can't see it, but you see there's a little pencil grid there. I thought a really nice way of rendering a black and white pixel artworks. You put them all together, it makes a beautiful art piece. You could screen print this, or you could just, if there's pencil work, you just fill it in and there's an original art piece.
01:45:13.384 - 01:45:33.174, Speaker A: I thought, just pretty cool. And that, my friends, is your show. It was so huge, I forgot to have the closer there, unfortunately. You know what I was going to do, though, for the closer, I can find it. It is right here. Thank you for joining me, and until next time, take care.
