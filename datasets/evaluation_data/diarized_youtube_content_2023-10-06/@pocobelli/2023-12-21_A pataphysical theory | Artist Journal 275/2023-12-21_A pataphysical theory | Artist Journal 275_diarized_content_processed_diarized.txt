00:00:02.680 - 00:00:30.304, Speaker A: My first words of the morning once again to you, dear viewer. Thank you for coming back and joining us on our one of a kind show featuring artists from around the world. As you're going to see here, Okote Global south series. Doing it like no one else does. Welcome back. Artist Journal, December 21, last day of fall, 2023. Broadcasting from the inner half of the nervous system in Berlin, Germany.
00:00:30.304 - 00:01:14.000, Speaker A: My name is Adrian Pokebelli, and welcome back. A one of a kind show, I dare say because of the people that are in it. And this kind of captures it to a certain degree. We've been following, you and me, both have been following this series. For those that have been watching for the last few weeks, this AI art series, these AI paintings by Okote is how I would pronounce it. And I just think they're so topical, so fun. You know, part of, you know, the joy of art for me is a kind of, you know, commentary on the world we live in.
00:01:14.000 - 00:01:43.362, Speaker A: It's not simply a, you know, delightful pleasure. It's not simply about the beauty. It's also commentary on the world is kind of what makes some art, a lot of art, important. And I would argue we have commentary on the world here with Okote's work. And let's just look at the title. It's a pretty like I'm sitting here in the west and they will have their revenge. I'm getting a little worried.
00:01:43.362 - 00:02:01.630, Speaker A: Getting a little worried over here. Because what if. And I suspect Okote is maybe perhaps capturing some of the spirit that is out there. So it's, uh. Yeah. So here it is. Okote edition of 13 Toutez.
00:02:01.630 - 00:02:18.426, Speaker A: Fifty cents. And however, it is not the commentary that grabbed me on this. It really was the painting. It was the technical. And when you have the technical, kind of just the. It's just a. Again, it was just like.
00:02:18.426 - 00:02:39.034, Speaker A: It's almost like a national geographic. It reminds me of a cover of National Geographic, but done differently. Right. But painted. Even though this is AI. But painted in AI artwork in a painterly style. And look at how great this is with these, what look like headscarves here.
00:02:39.034 - 00:02:57.826, Speaker A: And even the yellow eyes of these kinda, you know, figures here. Almost has a bit of a Star wars feel to it. So pretty interesting. Otherworldly. A little bit, at least for us out here. And look at everybody sitting in the water. I mean, it's.
00:02:57.826 - 00:03:38.696, Speaker A: It's kind of easy to gloss over this work here, this painting. It's easy to gloss over how unusual it is here. Everybody is sitting or this group of people are sitting in the middle of a lake, seemingly, which makes you wonder just what on earth is going on here. And the reflection, interestingly, pretty well done. I mean, it looks like a painting, doesn't it? And for all intents and purposes, it is. They will have their revenge in the water that is the mother and the world the moon inhabits their heart. Indignation fuels their spirit.
00:03:38.696 - 00:03:58.128, Speaker A: They wait patiently. They will have their revenge. Oh, coat edition of 13. How is it doing? Ten left. And so many interesting. And one sent to the global south art initiative, which I have never heard of before. Maybe we'll open that up since that is kind of the.
00:03:58.128 - 00:04:09.978, Speaker A: Here it is. So. And maybe Globalsouth. Tez. So interesting. Maybe related to Okote, because we see three other works there as well as the same title of the series. So.
00:04:09.978 - 00:04:26.986, Speaker A: And this is O Cote's page here. Mexico City based visual artist and social psychologist. Public space intervention, street art and digital crafts. So here you are. And we've looked at a few of these. There's a couple of Tez poles. We have looked at a few of these.
00:04:26.986 - 00:05:01.412, Speaker A: They were eye catchers from the very beginning and very, I'd say, original in their. In their, you know, concept and execution and really nicely executed. I mean, this one really does leap off the page, doesn't it? You know, kind of because we've seen a lot of these warm colors in the other ones. This is interesting what's going on here. It really did kind of, you know, go in a slightly different direction. Painterly. A bit of a national geographic direction, I'd be tempted to say, for lack of better terms.
00:05:01.412 - 00:05:43.122, Speaker A: So all to say, it's a beautiful work by o coat and pretty original and interesting, with a good dose of ambiguity in it as far as them sitting in the middle of this lake. And the interesting eyes and even the garb or the clothing is interesting, trying to place it there. Very interesting work from Okote, as usual. Continuing to develop that super interesting topical series. So big shout out and thanks to everybody who showed up here to the mech TXT loving type group exhibition. A fabulous. Let me see if we can get.
00:05:43.122 - 00:06:31.804, Speaker A: Here we go. A fabulous description of the loving type show. We had artists who were in it, some of the partners of mech TXT at the studio they run in Indonesia, and also mech TxT sister. And a great discussion on hieroglyphs and how interestingly, how mechding font, weirdly, is a very similar process to hieroglyphics, hieroglyphs and just a small little tidbit sometimes they're called hieroglyphics. They're actually hieroglyphs. And I think if you were to describe something as being hieroglyphic, but it's actually hieroglyphs. They're not hieroglyphics.
00:06:31.804 - 00:06:54.272, Speaker A: Just a little tidbit there. So I've heard from, actually, I was going to bring this up, and here, actually, is that I've heard from a teaching company series. I'm going to show it to you, actually, I'm going to bring it up. And here is the series, actually, just really quickly, just so here's mono Mech's font. So mech txt's font. These are fabulous. These are very similar, weirdly, to hieroglyphs.
00:06:54.272 - 00:07:56.712, Speaker A: And let me just explain how very quickly. So Mech has basically made a font where instead of it showing a letter, when you type the letter f on the keyboard, it shows, let's say this, o, right? And then, so mech will then put in a poem, and then it turns out there will be a different image for each letter. And so, interestingly, if you were to read this out, if you knew what each image represented, the sound that it represented, you could actually read out this Desderata Max Ehrman statement here, interestingly. And that is how hieroglyphs work. As we're discussing in the spaces. The great discovery, the way they actually deciphered hieroglyphs, was understanding that the images didn't represent the image inside. Generally, I think there were a few exceptions, but generally speaking, the images represented sounds in hieroglyphs, in ancient egyptian hieroglyphs.
00:07:56.712 - 00:08:35.528, Speaker A: And so here. And that was the key to decipherment, which I think they did in the 18th century. Here, you actually see an analogous process where, you know, the, these images really, if you're going to try and decipher this, what you need to know is that they represent sounds or letters and that that is how you can learn how to read this. So just kind of interesting there. So just a final thing on, hopefully, I can minimize this. So just a final thing on how to navigate Mech's. See this? You go here, and then down you can go.
00:08:35.528 - 00:08:53.224, Speaker A: And these are friends of mechanical. Go back to the atrium, and then you can go to here, the San Rock studio, which are collaborators of Mek. And we looked at some of these works yesterday. So very cool. We talked to Tito. We talked to, this is Tiffany. Alexandra is Mech's sister.
00:08:53.224 - 00:09:10.846, Speaker A: And we also talked to Sandy Pirouzzi here. Eat, sleep, study, repeat. So that was a great discussion and thank you, everybody, for attending. And thank you, Skomra Pokebelly in the study with a laptop. I thought this was a really great. I love this work, Skomra. So thank you very much.
00:09:10.846 - 00:09:39.274, Speaker A: I thought it was a very poetic original. I just loved the work. A beautiful addition to this room in my mind with all of these kind of works here that we've seen, the Pokebelly portraits, so to speak. And I love this there you almost have the bookshelf in the background there. Pokebelly in the study, I thought. I loved it. Again, using AI and the stable diffusion and diffuser textual inversions.
00:09:39.274 - 00:10:04.430, Speaker A: And thank you for sending me one great piece. And so comments on yesterday's show. First of all, thank you, Bea, for enjoying the hash. You know, if I had, let me, actually. So Bea was complimenting the show just a quarter through and distrust the institutions. Build your own measure of success. The work of art in the age of digital reproduction loses its aura when printed.
00:10:04.430 - 00:10:27.990, Speaker A: And I love the interpretations, actually, of what's going on here. But, you know, if I had thought of this, I probably would have called last show hash artshows. That is a great. That is a great term, which I never said, like. Yeah, so that is great. A great synthesis of what we're discussing is what I'm trying to say here. And continuing on.
00:10:27.990 - 00:10:36.512, Speaker A: Kika Nikolayla. Thank you for. For the comments. Tornado. Chaz, this is a great comment here. Just. Or a very.
00:10:36.512 - 00:10:57.288, Speaker A: And again, forgive the hair. Forgive everything. Today, my friends. Chaz, you're creating an environment that allows the artist to explode with creativity. I mean, I can't think of a more wonderful thing for this show to be doing. It is completely unintentional, I think. Not sure.
00:10:57.288 - 00:11:15.830, Speaker A: As Ballard says, unconscious assignments run our lives, you know? So who knows if you dig down deep enough. But all to say, a wonderful comment here from Chaz. Thank you. I'm glad to hear, is how I put it, as I said here, glad to hear Chaz. Lucas ochs. Thank you. And thank you.
00:11:15.830 - 00:11:29.780, Speaker A: Chrome. And this is important. Bigfoot or Sasquatch is what I was trying to remember. The word I was trying to remember there. And I think Albert Hoffman. Albert Hoffman. Humphrey Osmond is there.
00:11:29.780 - 00:11:55.948, Speaker A: Albert. I always Albert or Humphrey Osmond and Albert Hoffman. Albert Hoffman was a. Because, of course, Humphrey Osmond was the guy who actually moved from London to Saskatchewan, actually. That's why I'm confusing the two. And then there was another guy, Hoffer, who actually collaborated with Humphrey Osmond. They started with mescaline, actually, in England.
00:11:55.948 - 00:12:27.728, Speaker A: There was too much heat on Humphrey Osmond, so he moved to the middle of nowhere, Saskatchewan, to continue his psychedelic research in the fifties, where they actually had a huge impact on what were thought to be incurable alcoholics at the time. Something like 80%, at least for the first six months cure rate, which was unheard of. And they're just starting to rediscover that now, so well ahead of their time here. Anyway, way off topic here. Rural idol. Great to have you back, Adrian. Your thoughts about the 20 minutes mark in dialogue with popple are spot on.
00:12:27.728 - 00:12:42.600, Speaker A: I think that was the part we're discussing. Unprintable and the whitney. Perhaps our need for accept on here it is. Our need for acceptance. Status approval can feel so retrograde. Right, exactly. You have a deaf knack for conveying what I think many of us feel with such a light touch.
00:12:42.600 - 00:13:05.226, Speaker A: Thank you. Yeah, it's good to not just, on that note, it's good to never take things overly too seriously or take oneself too seriously. So I appreciate that light touch and everything there. So welcome back, journalist, artist, reporter mo. Cool t shirt. Thanks. That was my brother actually gave that to me.
00:13:05.226 - 00:13:16.194, Speaker A: Gons the myth. Indeed. And Tristan the myth. Cool piece. Absolutely. And here, popple left a comment actually, on the show before that. I wanted to hit here.
00:13:16.194 - 00:13:39.714, Speaker A: Yes. Everyone's wallet. Everyone's wallet is their storage and everyone's phone is their gallery. Making unprintable art is making art for the future that we are in already but not realizing it as much. So interesting. Interesting. Like, we're all trying to solve this problem of how do we display digital art? There's no great way to display digital art.
00:13:39.714 - 00:14:07.956, Speaker A: Maybe we already have our way of displaying digital art, and it's how we experience it right now on our screens, on our phone, as popple would say, or I'd argue, maybe on your desktop or laptop computer or iPad. Right. It's how we already see it. I mean, very interesting thought. Let's look at the comments on YouTube quickly here. And here we go. Adrian, great to see you back and bringing the passion.
00:14:07.956 - 00:14:27.036, Speaker A: This is Kelly Burns. Thanks for the mention of lil cakes. One of one also Sasquatch and Albert Hoffman. Thank you. It is Albert Hoffman McRender's much love. Everything in the don't pull the cartridge so far is gathered from physical cartridge tampering, which I think lends itself to some more of the textures you mentioned. So good to know.
00:14:27.036 - 00:14:47.496, Speaker A: I thought maybe there was like a video layer, kind of a glitch, video processing layer on those pieces, all from the physical cartridge tampering. Impressive. Mick, very cool series. Great textures in there. Skomra excited that you showed Haru Komoda's work. He and Keiko Kitahara are worth the follow. Great show.
00:14:47.496 - 00:15:00.576, Speaker A: Thank you for the tip, Skomra. And the comment. The video was this, I think is maybe a sp, well, I was gonna say spam, but maybe not. The video was so eye popping. Thank you for sharing. You're welcome. Sulkian, thank you.
00:15:00.576 - 00:15:25.462, Speaker A: Great to hear from you. And good morning. Santiago is a codel. Great to hear from you as well. And there was one comment here from Roentoon that we also from the show before, a lot of talk about crypto in this episode, and I find that interesting. You make the comparison of crypto transactions to banking transactions, and you're totally right. I would be furious with my bank if I got any of the difficulties and fees I get with ETH transactions.
00:15:25.462 - 00:15:49.272, Speaker A: I have quite a few works ready to mint, and while I'd love to mint them on ETH, there are endless headaches involved. It's no wonder that Sol and Polygon have taken off recently. Exactly. Saul, especially, is on fire right now. And it's, I mean, the transaction fees are minimal. I don't think the speed bothers people so much on ETH, but it's the fees. It's kind of a Walmart.
00:15:49.272 - 00:16:30.600, Speaker A: Why pay more? Like, this is a real Achilles heel for ETH that they keep, again, I already mentioned this. They keep saying they're going to fix it on the next upgrade. And they keep like, and then you still see, like, I was making a crypto trade this morning and it was like, $40. It's $40. And I was thinking to myself, like, is that all the profit that I made on this crypto? Did I just give to ethy? So all to say, yeah, totally agree. Now, Chepki had asked a couple of days ago, and I almost forgot, had asked to about the works I had made. That took me a year on average.
00:16:30.600 - 00:17:06.884, Speaker A: What I'd do is I'd work on these two works here and they'd take me two years, so they'd be a work a year each on average. And then I said the story about how, you know, I did that for three years, making six works when I was in Toronto. And then after that, I had a, I just frustrated with the slow progress, I decided to make a work in a night. And then I ended up liking that almost as much as the others. And in retrospect, I think I like it more as you'll see in a second here. So these are the works I worked so long on, kind of madness to a certain degree. This was to Mars and the stars.
00:17:06.884 - 00:17:45.174, Speaker A: What if 2012 never happened? Never happened? And this was kind of. This was done, this was finished, I think, in 2012. And this was kind of a homage, in a sense, to Terence McKenna to a certain degree, and the whole mayan calendar. And Terence was basically saying the great psychedelic philosopher, mushroom philosopher of the 1990s. And he was saying, you know, of course, that he had had all this, the time wave novelty theory and time wave zero and all, which hasn't held up, but a beautiful, what I'd call pataphysical theory. It's a wonderful pataphysical theory. It's kind of a beautiful piece of what I'd call fiction.
00:17:45.174 - 00:19:08.934, Speaker A: It was a brilliant piece of fiction, the novelty time wave zero theory, which is this idea that information in the universe. If I was to try and summarize here on the spot, information in the universe gets more and more complex over time in that ultimately it reaches a kind of singularity of sorts, and where a kind of omega point where you pass through, what do you call it, the archon. There's the origin and the arcade and the. He called it the Eschaton, where it reaches the end of history, and then everything basically changes, kind of ambiguous as to what that meant. Physical reality, does society change? And he grounded that in Alfred North Whitehead, hilariously, I would add, in this idea that culture has fits and starts of habit and novelty. So the renaissance on his graph that he would point out would show novelty at the Renaissance, or, you know, newness, right? And then, you know, then the culture goes, and then it gets more habit, and things stay the same, and all of a sudden you have something like the Internet and boom, right? And maybe AI. Boom, boom, boom, right? So habit and novelty.
00:19:08.934 - 00:19:45.638, Speaker A: So just as a way of looking at history, I think it's brilliant and I actually think it's useful. But all to say, this was kind of like my big question, what happens if 2012 never happened? And this painting was my answer, which was to Mars and the stars. Basically, we go to space. And here was Kalina, the world's best kind of soccer referee. Kalina wins the match. And there you have the drudge report there, who I considered at the time. I've changed my views on this since, but at the time, considered the world's best news editor.
00:19:45.638 - 00:20:12.050, Speaker A: He was at the time. I don't know who runs the drudge report anymore, if it even is. But anyway, let's not get lost on that. And a grand stadium here and a kind of hakusai like wave. And this kind of, you know, unknown, infernal unknown in the background here with a little selection there and a dolphin playing wildwork. So that was the start of this visual novel here. I won't go in depth on each one.
00:20:12.050 - 00:20:40.376, Speaker A: This is visual analysis. I was big into the financial theme early on, as you can see here. That's what James Dines called technical analysis, one of the original newsletter writers. And here you kind of have the elements of someone's life here. A marriage with the Financial Times pink in the background there. And then here you have kind of major commodities that this person needs. Oil, something to build their house, cattle, wheat.
00:20:40.376 - 00:21:07.928, Speaker A: And then here is the gold chart. So finance mirroring the heartbeat, so and all in the form of a website. And here kind of reduced to advertising. And this is actually the ads. This is from an ad that I actually made for the graphic designer. And what did this mean? This is a hieroglyph, actually. And I believe when you have the circle around, that's when it's for the emperor.
00:21:07.928 - 00:21:38.744, Speaker A: And I think this is ancient egyptian for love. And then we have the. When you have the circle around, I think you call it. Is it the cartoon that you put around whenever you see hieroglyphs and there's a circle around, that's the pharaoh's name, I think you call that the cartoon, if I'm not mistaken. And then at the top you have the Photoshop menu. So you see, so, and here's James Dines, actually, that newsletter writer I was telling you about. You have to look wrong to be right.
00:21:38.744 - 00:22:21.974, Speaker A: And again, here are the four elements of Dines investment philosophy fundamentals. So I have a table of the elements, the mass psychology, so the mass media here, the crowd, technical analysis, or visual analysis as he called it here. And then here was inner baggage, which I decided to portray as someone wanting the classic dream. And one of Dine's famous. Is it an aphorism? You have to look wrong to be right, writing down his statement. So all to say, so I did four of these. And finally, this is dynamic noetic objects, kind of a psychedelic painting here and kind of a vision in a dream, as Coleridge would say.
00:22:21.974 - 00:22:38.174, Speaker A: Gillette here. Yeah. And there's some kind of dynamic noetic object, as I like to call it here. And finally, the threads of fate. So this was going to be a twelve part visual novel. And this is based on Plinko, actually, from the prices. Right.
00:22:38.174 - 00:23:09.444, Speaker A: How do you portray fate. And I decided, I know it took me a while. Again, I worked on these for months, like a year, actually, two years. These two works, you know, basically whenever I wasn't working in the office. So. And here, you know, the. Again, the elements of someone's life at the office, the parents, you know, the at school, the at work, you know, first kiss, all this sort of thing, the threads of fate, kind of a medieval vibe.
00:23:09.444 - 00:23:28.672, Speaker A: So all to say, so I was working on these forever. And then this is the work I did in a night, which is hilarious. So then I did this work in a night, which was just me taking my projector. And what I did here was. And this is oil. Oil on canvas. And what I did is I took.
00:23:28.672 - 00:23:52.368, Speaker A: This is I took some screenshots that I had and put up my projector. And it's a very fun way of working, actually, where I put a layer of what was a space structure, you know, that space photography, that's where you get the rectangles from. And I never even filled it in. I just put it, you know, just working quickly, which is part of the magic. Then this is from a Shakespeare book, this thing. And so I projected that on top. Top.
00:23:52.368 - 00:24:07.376, Speaker A: And then it, I think of. That's most of it. And I may have even just added this as a decorative element on top. And then here were some numbers that I think I also. I don't think I did it in the morning. I think I did it that night. Maybe I did it in the morning.
00:24:07.376 - 00:24:31.586, Speaker A: All to say it was done within 12 hours. And there, look at this. See the signature there? I screwed it up the first time so that I painted over it, and then I did it again. But then it makes this beautiful kind of color here. So working fast is interesting. So, you know, when I looked at this this morning, of course, I haven't looked at this in years. I was like, I think I like this one way better than the other works.
00:24:31.586 - 00:25:03.654, Speaker A: So anyway, thank you, Chepki, for asking. But there's a power to working fast, right? I mean, this is much more I find engaging for the eyes, right? Anyway, enough of that. Let's get to the talk of the day here. Mal, art collector. Why Solana? What happened to Tezos for NFTs? So there's been a lot of talk of Solana versus Tezos. So I kind of wanted to weigh in here. On the record, Solana has swiftly overtaken Tezos in the NFT market.
00:25:03.654 - 00:25:47.702, Speaker A: Very debatable. Depends in what way? In terms of financially, probably. Especially now, once a domain where Tazo shined. The NFT landscape is now increasingly dominated by Solana. So I think this is a very debatable situation, and I'll tell you why in a second, and you can agree or disagree with me, this shift raises question about tezos, about what Tezos may have missed and how Solana capitalized on these gaps. So you're seeing a lot of artists are minting on Solana right now, but I think artists are just doing what artists should do, which is trying to capitalize on the situation. In other words, what is going on? So Solana has gone up.
00:25:47.702 - 00:26:39.864, Speaker A: Why are artists going to Solana? Solana has gone up from, say, $16, you know, maybe eight months ago, a year ago, to $80 now, $85, whatever it is. So Solana has gone up enormously. And what happens when a crypto goes up is all of the art within that crypto ecosystem appreciates in value. Because all of a sudden, let's say you were used to buying art at one sol. That was at $16. All of a sudden, that same work of art that you would have bought for one sol, you'd need to spend 80 or $85. And this is why I think that's my reasoning, why ETH art is so expensive in the 2021, because people were trading, buying and selling it for an ETH when ETH was like $80.
00:26:39.864 - 00:27:24.990, Speaker A: And then that price structure was more, was stuck to the crypto more than to the fiat value. So what you all of a sudden had was when ETH was at four or $5,000 a coin, for lack of a better term, the art appreciated alongside of it. So all of a sudden, people were spending, spending 500 ETH, but all of a sudden that turned into, you know, what is that, like $2 million at the height? Right? So all to say, I think that's what's going on with the artists. I don't think it has anything other, like, as far my interpretation. Feel free to disagree out there and leave me a comment. I'll happily read it. And maybe I'm wrong, but I think that's the main impetus behind artists going.
00:27:24.990 - 00:27:51.488, Speaker A: And I've long advocated here that artists should be multi chain for this, you know, because maybe this person is right. Right. Like, if Ma. If Mal is right, then artists should be diversified. And again, as I always say, blockchains come and go, so you really don't want to have your eggs all in one basket here. So let's just continue. Solana's meteoric rise is largely attributed to its lightning fast transaction speed and minimal cost.
00:27:51.488 - 00:28:20.658, Speaker A: So I think here, you know, regarding Rune tune and ETH costs, and I've heard a couple of artists mention having a series ready for ETH but not wanting to mint it. And I don't blame them because it'd probably cost you 50 or $60 us. I mean, that's a huge amount of money. This advantage starkly contrasts with tezos, which, despite its strengths, lags in transaction efficiency. I don't think the artists, I don't think it's slow enough, though. I don't think it's a speed that are bringing the artists. I think it's the money.
00:28:20.658 - 00:28:41.406, Speaker A: A critical area Tezos needs to address. Then there's the marketing that Solana is marketing strong. Tazo seems to be outmaneuvered. That might be fair enough. Solana's success is its user friendly ecosystem, making it accessible to a broader audience. Tezos, you know, that's possible. I don't disagree.
00:28:41.406 - 00:29:10.600, Speaker A: But as far as, in conclusion, Solana's ability to outpace Tezos in the NFT arena serves as a wake up call. This. Yeah. Again, like I, I would be, I would want to see, like, in terms of volume, how are you measuring the art versus the PFPs? And, like, I find tazos right now still resilient. Like it's. And you'll notice a lot of the artists are still minting on tazos as they mint on Solana. Right.
00:29:10.600 - 00:29:35.458, Speaker A: Because Tezos brings home the bacon for a lot of artists with these, like, additions. And then you sell them at five or $10 each. It's a very rich, strong, resilient market. So I don't see artists leaving Tezos. I see them also wanting to mint on Solana because there's money to be made. There is sort of what I see. Let's continue here.
00:29:35.458 - 00:30:11.510, Speaker A: Ryan from Tea Cafe. Tezos artists doing work on Saul is what musicians call a wedding gig. It's a time of great hype where a lot of cash gets thrown around, usually for no good reason. So they take those gigs playing music that nobody even really listens to in order to pay the bills. Musicians need to eat, too. Now, I agree with the side of it being about the money here, but I don't think. I think it's unfair to Solana and really to that ecosystem to say it's like a wedding gig in the sense that, that, because that's kind of a pejorative.
00:30:11.510 - 00:30:33.158, Speaker A: It's sort of like it's just a wedding gig. It doesn't mean anything. It's not about the art and liking that gig. It's about kind of bringing home the bacon so you can continue to do your real art on the side. But of course, this is not what they want to be doing. They usually have a separate space to do the types of music they really want. And so I think this is like the opposite extreme.
00:30:33.158 - 00:30:54.898, Speaker A: And I disagree. I think Solana, for artists, it's always been a kind of a nice ecosystem. It was pretty quiet about a year ago. So artists go where the collectors are too, and they're just being pragmatic. And I think it's all about financial motivation. And I think artists like Tezos and the whole community. Absolutely.
00:30:54.898 - 00:31:22.650, Speaker A: But there's a community on Saul too, as far as I understand, of course. Right. But of course it's not what they want to be doing. They usually have a separate space to do the types of music they really want, which are usually found in the indian underground scenes of the art districts of various cities and the globe. That's what Tezos is right now for a lot of artists out there. It's the place they keep on coming back to so they can be themselves. I think it's the place they to be, you know, at the core, to be Walmart about it.
00:31:22.650 - 00:31:54.812, Speaker A: It's the place they keep coming back to because it keeps paying them. That is my take on it. If Tezos stopped paying out, if the collectors disappeared, if all of a sudden there wasn't that resilience that I was just describing, I'm not sure they would stick around. I think then they might go to Solana if that's where all of a sudden the collectors were. So I think that is my take on this. So we can't read all of this, but it was a very interesting post and yeah, I think it's an interesting kind of topic. Kika also weighed in.
00:31:54.812 - 00:32:30.638, Speaker A: I find the whole fight between chains a bit silly because we need to join forces in order to show the world the potential of web3. Artists have always needed to diversify to survive. I think the point I'm making here, each chain has pros and cons. The future is cross chain. Totally agree. Art is art no matter where it is minted. And we were talking with Luke 500 last week, and I asked him a question that I sometimes wondered to myself, which is, do you think the art in 100 years or even in 20 or 50 years, do you think it's going to matter what chain the art was minted on? And he said no.
00:32:30.638 - 00:33:07.700, Speaker A: And with a kind of a certain amount of what is the word? Conviction? And I kind of like that is how I, you know, I was thinking like a year or two years ago as well. Now I'm just. I don't know. But I thought that was quite interesting, because if that's the case, if the chain doesn't matter, then really the value is on Tazos, isn't it? From a. How much money you're going to spend for the art, you're getting equation perspective. So finally here, maybe some collectors are pushing for one or the other because they have invested in this or in that, but honestly, that's a bit of a. Whatever.
00:33:07.700 - 00:33:22.620, Speaker A: A lot of platforms accept payment and credit card and or other coins as. Yeah, as we'll see here in a second. And I've even heard it's possible to bridge tokens from one chain to another. Is it true? If not now, surely one day. I'm pretty sure that's true. Finally. Yes.
00:33:22.620 - 00:33:46.240, Speaker A: I personally hate paying for gas or having complicated ways to get the money in my wallet, but I won't crucify the artists who still enjoy minting on ETH. It's their choice. Absolutely. Exactly. So it's kind of. It was interesting. Like Claire Silver had that initiative where here's a bunch of money for maybe 150 artists or so, if I remember correctly, to mint their work.
00:33:46.240 - 00:34:15.278, Speaker A: I should have brought that tweet up here, because that's interesting, too. Like, you see the problems that ETH is having right now, because why would an artist mint on ETH unless they kind of knew they were going to get something for it? So. Or, you know, you could lose $70 just like that. As an artist, you put all this work in and then you're paying the chain and then nobody even wants to bid and all this sort of thing. But there are, you know, there are sales out there. Magic Eden. We're thrilled to see Phantom.
00:34:15.278 - 00:34:45.423, Speaker A: So the phantom wallet that is popular on Solana, join us in the growing BTC bitcoin community and build a stronger ecosystem. Congrats. So, Phantom bitcoin on Phantom, you can now buy, sell, trade, transfer and Hodl bitcoin ordinals and BRC twenties with your favorite multi chain wallet. Here's what to love. So how cool is that? So let's just cancel that. And this is also so OKX. We saw, I think, in last episode or the one before.
00:34:45.423 - 00:35:09.616, Speaker A: How is OKX that was doing the great majority of the ordinals trading, interestingly, the NFTs, so to speak, on bitcoin. And so here is Okex and I never looked it up. I think it's a korean exchange, if I'm not mistaken. I could be wrong about that. Bitmaps. So this and the bitmaps. On ordinal.
00:35:09.616 - 00:35:23.180, Speaker A: On ordinals. To my understanding, this is like a metaverse of sorts. And these are starting to go up quite a bit. Zero, zero, seven bitcoin. So that sounds like about 800 or $900. So these are going up. They have the most volume.
00:35:23.180 - 00:35:44.436, Speaker A: Bitcoin frogs, fuzzy fox, bitcoin punk. So you see what's going on here. So here's the market on OKX, which I thought was just a trading platform. It is, but they put a ordinals marketplace smartly. And here, finally, Zora. You no longer need to bridge across chains to mint what you love on Zora. Simply choose which network to make to pay from.
00:35:44.436 - 00:36:05.946, Speaker A: Click mint, and enjoy. So, as you'll see here, you hit mint, and then you choose your chain. I mean, how impressive is that? So you could use optimism or, you know, Zora, or you name it, so. Or ETH or whatnot. So interesting developments here. This was really cool, actually. I got some of these.
00:36:05.946 - 00:36:24.364, Speaker A: I think my Internet is having issues here, but we don't have time. Yeah, unfortunately, the Internet is having issues. I got this, too. I was going to bring it up. Axing on. Let me actually, I'm going to bridge to my phone very quickly here. Just give me a second.
00:36:24.364 - 00:36:45.620, Speaker A: Axeen on arc crush. And here's an Axeen physical as I turn on. Let me see if I can just. There we go. So I have figured out how to do this on the fly, which is go to my phone for Internet and even here. Now let's do this. Okay.
00:36:45.620 - 00:36:57.092, Speaker A: And let's go back. And we should be able to reload. Here it is. Okay. We are back in business, my friends. Okay. With art crush gallery.
00:36:57.092 - 00:37:23.090, Speaker A: Actually, I got sent this, too, over the holidays. This is awesome. So I'll show mine as well. Axeen's work here on the side of what looks like a bus shelter here and also in the world. So how cool is that? And even in what looks like a train station here, I think this is in Brussels or around maybe Belgium. Very cool. Love to see God afk on display.
00:37:23.090 - 00:37:43.298, Speaker A: Thank you, art crush gallery. So, yeah, big shout out to art crush as well. I'll show mine, maybe next show. And here, let's just reload this. Here is the oxine physicals that we're just looking at. So kind of mysterious here. Looks like a woodcut, doesn't it? And a skull.
00:37:43.298 - 00:37:57.394, Speaker A: It looks like a woodcut. And then you have an auxine sticker in there. So similar to Rada. They're sending some stickers. So just very cool little package in a ziploc. This is maybe a certificate of authenticity. Not sure.
00:37:57.394 - 00:38:18.810, Speaker A: And you can see for scale there a ten euro note. So very cool preview there from oxen. So, rinnefish. So let's just hit. So very interesting work here from runyfish. Let's get the. A more complex work from rinifish.
00:38:18.810 - 00:38:52.418, Speaker A: Let's get the title end of pain. And let me see. We can't. There is no time to restart this program today. And so let's just see if we can do it. But anyway, a great piece here by rinnefish. Kind of, you know, seems like stretching out a little bit, trying different things with figures inside this larger animal here.
00:38:52.418 - 00:39:09.274, Speaker A: And here are figures at the bottom. Really doing some interesting experimentation here. End of pain. And this is from December 20, 2023. And this is on object, minted on tea. Very cool there. And of course, you remember the screensaver.
00:39:09.274 - 00:39:31.066, Speaker A: So as you can see, a bit more of a complex work here from runyfish. Interesting to see lots of work coming out, which is awesome. Creating the bugs nub 1914 with a pretty interesting work. Arbol de limones. So maybe that's lemon tree. And here, I assume is the lemon tree. And almost a princess figure or a queen with a crown.
00:39:31.066 - 00:39:51.914, Speaker A: And here maybe a plant of sorts. So another just kind of interesting, ambiguous, mysterious work from NUV 1914. Super original. A one of one. And this sold, let's see, still eleven tezos to one of one. Big shout out to one of one as well. So cycle of life, this was another interesting work here.
00:39:51.914 - 00:40:27.866, Speaker A: Interesting contrast with these kind of hard angles and water, which is anything but hard angles. So interesting rendition of the water too, as these gradients. Just really interesting piece here. Kind of circular too, in that it seems to be going up here and going back to the back, up and then down. What is the title? Cycle life Escher revisited. Very interesting edition of 20 for three tezos. Here's Elna Frederick, who you probably recognize the style here.
00:40:27.866 - 00:40:48.864, Speaker A: And, you know, this kind of cycling optical illusion. And really nicely done here with this epic tug of war with people already falling off the cliff here. The winner take all tug of war here. Jury, jury plaque. So kind of an interesting, ambiguous title. And let's just see what these sell for. Two.
00:40:48.864 - 00:41:10.488, Speaker A: Sold for 50 tezos each. So nice sales here from Elna Frederick, continuing on Jan. This was pretty interesting. This is I believe on chain, this is on super rare, and I've never seen this artist work before. Get something out of your system. It's called on chain architecture. So I'm pretty sure this is on chain work.
00:41:10.488 - 00:41:28.104, Speaker A: And as you can see, there's not much. Usually on chain work is pretty simple, so to speak. And here it is. So really nice abstracts is how I would describe this. Here's another one. So we let everything load here. OCA number two.
00:41:28.104 - 00:41:47.344, Speaker A: On chain architecture number two. So really nice color scheme here too. And almost like this tron like grid. And let's check out the last one here. And here is the last one. So very interesting. Cool landscapes, for lack of better term.
00:41:47.344 - 00:42:13.894, Speaker A: From Jan on super rare. So very cool on chain art. I couldn't see how big this was from the metadata. There was no metadata, which probably echoes the on chain nature of the works. Dylan, philosophia philo Sophia. Love wisdom in Greek. And so separating the words here, the love philosophy, of course, meaning the love of wisdom.
00:42:13.894 - 00:42:54.124, Speaker A: And here, another just beautiful abstract. I think a digital abstract, especially when you see right here, that sharp, sharp line here as well as here, but here it's more blurred out. And here you see kind of this influence of the physical world, even though it looks digital and kind of, you know, with influence from the physical world here, as we can see in the paper, textures here and even in the treatment of the one of one. And the writing on the print, as you would a physical print. And then these brushes that are maybe done in procreate, if I had to guess. And again, kind of a woodcut feeling here. And minimal color.
00:42:54.124 - 00:43:13.762, Speaker A: So cool concept and cool execution from Dylan. A one of one for only 15 tazos. Haiti rocket interconnection. So looking like it's designed for a tv screen, perhaps. And more abstract work from Haiti Rockette. Cool colors. And again, making it look easy.
00:43:13.762 - 00:43:34.630, Speaker A: Amiga 1200. Cool title. Amiga 1200. And Photoshop. And probably not available anymore since I loaded up this shoichek quickly. Usually these go off the market pretty quickly and maybe the Internet is going to protest too much here. Let's keep moving here.
00:43:34.630 - 00:43:56.844, Speaker A: Oh, is it going to show up? We're not going to try this experiment again. It is still available for 37 tazos. Okay, so this may have just been minted. Five left figments. Also known as captain, a ge astral grid emulator. So a cool abstract here from figments. And you gotta love inside that sphere there.
00:43:56.844 - 00:44:08.640, Speaker A: That is going for 15 tezos. Addition of seven. There are five left. So nice sales here at 15 tezos. Each two to not a number. And here's another one by figments. Plantlab.
00:44:08.640 - 00:44:43.748, Speaker A: Zero, zero, two. So almost doing a bit of an office idea here. Almost combining the plants, you know, Kappn is also plants, or figments is also known as plants. And so starting to combine the plants with the computers and all of a sudden you're in an office when you start to do that. Look again. These horizontal pixel lines are just delightful here. And even here in the background, this window with what look like curtains and maybe a mountain and a moon in the background with some clouds, static, you know, contrasting with all of the movement here in the work.
00:44:43.748 - 00:45:01.568, Speaker A: Totally awesome. Twelve tezos. Is that on primary? It is on primary. There are ten left edition of 16. And here is manital, two of pentacles. Nice addition to the cat tarot series. Pretty hilarious, actually, on the unicycle, of all things.
00:45:01.568 - 00:45:19.438, Speaker A: And then balancing these two stars here with a ship in the background and a bird and a cat. Also looking on there. Nice piece. And that is six tezos. And there are eight left. And this is an addition of ten. I'm not sure if there are that many left still.
00:45:19.438 - 00:45:42.044, Speaker A: Tomb and retrospective edition of 20. This may have just been minted here. Not listed yet, but probably listed by the time you see this. So some retro computers, you see some three and a half inch disk drives here. And there is our popular character from tomb. And battle's work again, eight bit retro, eight bit nostalgic colors reminiscent of eight bit games. Retrospectiva.
00:45:42.044 - 00:46:05.196, Speaker A: Maybe a cool title for a show. A couple of works by Hasdrubal waffle here. Let me make them big on Zora. They're almost impossible to get. They mint start at 17 hours ago, and it'll be like within 30 minutes, the mint will be over. So true love will find you in the end. So I've been missing all of these, unfortunately, even when I think I'm early.
00:46:05.196 - 00:46:22.388, Speaker A: Look at this in this great, great margin around here. So anyways, very fun. Cool works here. This one's a little gory, but still great. Hi yah by also hasdrubal waffle. As you see, mint started 17 hours ago. Most recent mint was 17 hours ago.
00:46:22.388 - 00:46:41.964, Speaker A: Now you got to go on open sea and get it on secondary. So great textures and everything here. Just always fun. Delightful. Makes it look so easy. Kurt hustle collective Paris Renegades, Ratty ray Ronson Legris. So a new trading card here from Kurt Hussle collective, 1997 World Series.
00:46:41.964 - 00:47:00.954, Speaker A: That is hilarious. I feel like I remember this trading card series with the gradient. If there was that like a Don Russ, like one of their last editions. I think they went out of business eventually. Don Russia. But maybe this is just original to Kurt Hussle collective too. I love the background on there too.
00:47:00.954 - 00:47:29.492, Speaker A: Very cool rustic digital art. Mi viejo IO and what kind of looks like a Warhol figure and kind of looks like a Jack Nicholson figure and Pikachu with some math. I'm always a huge fan actually of math. I used to put a lot of math in my work, believe it or not, back in the day in art school and even sometimes in the peloponnesian war. You'll see that. Anyway, cool work here. Nicely painted hair from rustic digital art.
00:47:29.492 - 00:48:01.910, Speaker A: Nice brushstroke here too. Always interesting and just a cool digital painting available for 420 and there are eight left on primary. Check out this awesome work by runetune. I love the care. So Runetun is in creme de la creme and is celebrating his accession into the group there. Monopole 2023 societe civille du la creme de la creme proprietaire rune tune de la creme de la creme appellation rune tun contreole. So just hilarious.
00:48:01.910 - 00:48:31.584, Speaker A: I'm not sure if these are available to buy. I thought just a really cool work edition of 86. Let's see if any have been. So none available yet, but they are coming. Really cool. Brukabiram Gojira, known as Godzilla in the west, is an iconic figure in japanese pop culture and global cinema, portrayed as a prehistoric reptilian monster awakened and empowered by nuclear radiation. So this is part of an exhibition at Aurora Sushi bar in Istanbul.
00:48:31.584 - 00:49:08.774, Speaker A: So a cool, of course Birka is from Turkey and so a cool rendition of Godzilla there in Berka's unmistakable style here and cool work there. And here. Another work by Pomelo. Another awesome. Let me see if we can get the Christmas came early. It feels like the weekend came early with this music. Always a cool groove with Pomelo.
00:49:08.774 - 00:49:47.004, Speaker A: Very cool series here. And that is, let's just see, it is only two tezos edition of eleven. And here is Pamelo Cerrone Cherone Pamelo Cherone magic mash Pam Pam mixtape sampler DJ set. Look at how great that is. 19 December so you know, Pamela Cirone just keeps moving here and it seems like this style works really well with like this kind of advertising. It feels like it works really well in advertising. And we saw it, it looked like in a lineup for tickets.
00:49:47.004 - 00:50:10.364, Speaker A: It was also some Pamela trone. So it continues here just the super prolific artists there. We had a great space for those that are interested, great Twitter space. While I was in Saskatoon three weeks ago or so, Chaz. Sow the seeds, reap the memories. So another cool retro computer video game work by Chaz. And this time, looking forward.
00:50:10.364 - 00:50:42.492, Speaker A: Here, an interesting keyboard here, it almost looks like a gaming station of sorts, but here, it looks a little more retro in a tv, glass of red wine and a cigarette. So seeds of memories invites you to a nostalgic harvest moon. Three tezos, 45 tezos cents. Look at this. Minimal work by pixel dealer. Quiet, it is called. And what it looks like is a moon with maybe reflections on the water, I would think.
00:50:42.492 - 00:50:58.444, Speaker A: And so just an interesting work. Maybe that's a boat. Hard to say. Interesting piece here by pixel dealer. Edition of 15. And they are listed at 15 times 15 tezos. So interesting piece.
00:50:58.444 - 00:51:42.414, Speaker A: Kf with a little more work with the tiles, we are all a little flicker of matter. So I thought a really interesting take. So it looks like it's based. Today's pixel art exercise is based on north american pelican nebulae. So based on this, you know, shot of outer space, and then taking a very simple tiling that you can do an aseprite. Now, as we're seeing kyle do with ultima four tiling, and applying that here, a really cool, interesting concept here. And there's kind of a natural contrast there as well, going from these kind of like tiny little stars, but using these big kind of tiling.
00:51:42.414 - 00:52:07.762, Speaker A: Using tiling, you know, these big blocks. Just a very interesting way of almost categorizing visual imagery. Right? Because all of a sudden you go, okay, this is a few stars with some cloudy nebulae. More stars in the cloudy nebulae. And then you just start to. It's a way of abstracting from that image. Interesting, interesting work there.
00:52:07.762 - 00:52:19.690, Speaker A: Retro. Manny, a couple of. So here are the works, boss. Fight. So, here are the works. Is this sold out listings? Okay, it is already sold out here. Let's see if there's.
00:52:19.690 - 00:52:30.704, Speaker A: Yeah, so this is it. Use a barrel roll. Left or right? Twice. So here it is approaching the tesbull. And we have another one here. Airspace. And let's play this one.
00:52:30.704 - 00:52:56.924, Speaker A: And here, we saw a preview of this on the Twitter yesterday. So here are the works. Power up. There is retro man. And so very cool there. And I think we have one more Zavari mountains. So, as you see, different renditions of the video game here, which you start to wonder, this very well may happen at some point here.
00:52:56.924 - 00:53:29.088, Speaker A: So, anyway, cool work here by retro Manny. As usual, this is still available for three tezos and there are 20 left. So cool work there. And continuing on, LB Santa Barbera. Look at this. So LB starting, continuing to kind of break out. If LB was like a stock or a crypto, I would say, you know, back to our visual analysis theme.
00:53:29.088 - 00:53:48.874, Speaker A: LB is breaking out here. This is very interesting work. And it seems like there's, he's breaking out from previous patterns here. This is great. Santa Barbara, very cool. Here's Klaus, composition zero nine. And this series is also looking just super cool here.
00:53:48.874 - 00:54:11.990, Speaker A: Very interesting stuff going on in the analog video glitch department. Also Klaus, composition eight. Another really nice work here. So these are one of ones, by the way, and let's just see what they're selling for. Only 1212 tazos to not a number here and here. Skull takes so great deals here for these. One of ones.
00:54:11.990 - 00:54:46.020, Speaker A: Chan Luc edition of seven. And I think these are going for 150 tezos each. And here we go. No title as far as I could tell, or at least maybe icons for a title. And just a really cool abstract work here with what looks like maybe a speaker perhaps that is turning and some abstract rainbow lines moving through the frame. Instantly recognizable as Sean Luke. And so is this sold out to four, five pretty much.
00:54:46.020 - 00:55:00.244, Speaker A: For all intents and purposes. No more listed, let's put it that way. Renki hyogo. So another cool animated abstract from Renki. And this is an edition of one. So let's just see what happened here. So not listed yet.
00:55:00.244 - 00:55:34.564, Speaker A: And continuing on, Roccano DD crew. So that seems to be the name of this arcade game here. And as you can see, brilliantly putting palm trees in the background just to make the image that much cooler. And you see the joysticks on this arcade game kind of deconstructing for lack of better word, even though that's not really the right use of the term, but we're not going to worry about that today. Reader machine exe so a couple of GLB's here. Look at this. This is Ivan Hugo.
00:55:34.564 - 00:56:05.322, Speaker A: Look at this. So interesting. Looks like an old game Boy, but with a battery on the side. Kind of almost like a steampunk without the victorian theme, but almost like a steampunk game Boy, right? And then here you have a little screen or interface. It looks like a steampunk Game Boy is actually what this is, but I don't see. Yeah, but not directly steampunk. So anyway, cool work for tezos, $0.20.
00:56:05.322 - 00:56:25.786, Speaker A: That is still four left on primary. And we have another work here. This is mewgi with Intun. Kind of a similar idea. I wonder if there's some sort of festival going on here. Kind of like a Game Boy here as well, but a little bit different. And there's Muji's work inside of it that is pretty cool in the screen.
00:56:25.786 - 00:56:54.630, Speaker A: Great concept. And again, kind of steampunk. And I don't see steampunk mentioned anywhere here, but kind of the same idea, isn't it? This is an edition of 20 for ten tezos each. There are eight left. And continuing on, kuhei Yamashita. And so here, another GLB, which is pretty interesting, with a heart where the pupil is, and kind of reminiscent of some sort of ancient egyptian statue fragment. Here is a GLB.
00:56:54.630 - 00:57:09.118, Speaker A: And again, an emoji in the eye. Little cakes with some interesting works here. 30 tezos, one of one. The whole series is pretty kind of. I don't know if a gory is the right word. Maybe satisfying hunger on the go. It's edgy.
00:57:09.118 - 00:57:29.724, Speaker A: Let's call it that way. Happy meal five. And here you can see others here. We're going to bring up a few. Happy meal two, satisfying hunger on the go. So again, kind of gory, edgy works here of people eating in cars, but almost looking like blood at the same time. Happy meal three and happy meal four.
00:57:29.724 - 00:58:00.336, Speaker A: So pretty hilarious work by little cakes. Of course, these are AI artworks, and this was sold to no hygiene, who does. Or transferred to no hygiene, who does very experimental AI art as well. Here's happy meal six, eating what looked like a popsicle here, but maybe is turning into mouths with teeth. And here we see someone kind of crunched on the top here. So very edgy work here. Finally, happy meal won by little cakes.
00:58:00.336 - 00:58:16.288, Speaker A: So pretty cool. Available for 30 tezos. On primary here is Richard Nadler. The day has finally come. I'm so happy that we will unleash the waves and wonderful Izanami Islands artworks today at four. It's an absolute honor and pleasure to share that moment with you. So it has finally come.
00:58:16.288 - 00:58:40.708, Speaker A: These almost like the Hakusai wave inspired works, but there's more to it than that. They are actually island works, as you can see, there's a lot of the waves, but there's also just island works here. And this is verse, which of course, has a very nice website here. So as you'll see if this loads up also. So this is AI here as well. So just doing the islands here, too. This is great.
00:58:40.708 - 00:59:02.954, Speaker A: Kind of reminds me of a rousseau a little bit. Here are some other waves by Richard Nadler. And so just cool series here from DER Nadler on verse, which has been doing some nice work. Look at that. So great color AI artwork. Really textured, almost three dimensional. Again, a landscape from an island.
00:59:02.954 - 00:59:17.646, Speaker A: And just cool work here. Another take on the wave. And I think we have one more here. So cool work. What are these selling for auction one, 1.44 tez. So doing or ETH.
00:59:17.646 - 00:59:30.158, Speaker A: So $3,000. So doing very well. That is impressive. Auction one by oxs. Wow. So these have done phenomenally. This also went for 1.44
00:59:30.158 - 01:00:08.786, Speaker A: ETH. That is impressive. So making a killing here on this series here is strange thing with an awesome, another awesome juxtaposition or combination of a baseball player, basically a baseball card, kind of iconic looking. Looks like Mickey Mantle or something, in the context of an oil painting. Of course, that's a duomo in Florence in the background there with this beautiful cracking oil paint. And even here, beautifully painted, I dare say, by strange thing. And here is another AI painting, rabid dog by Olivera Durdevik.
01:00:08.786 - 01:00:34.964, Speaker A: And, you know, I was thinking we were going to be at 40 minutes today, and here we are at an hour, but we are almost done. So Olivera Durdevic with another cool AI painting, rabid dog. Nice and minimal. A lot of texture there. And here, as we go into the physicals, John Bergerman, you know, just an interesting artist here, I think. Doing fairly well in the contemporary art world. In the trad contemporary art world.
01:00:34.964 - 01:00:59.848, Speaker A: Just a cool, interesting artist. Again, this spray paint airbrush thing that we see quite a few artists employing it both digitally and physically, especially physically. Seems to be a trend, doesn't it? Here is a beautiful drawing. A Maggie Margaret Cowles. The sauce and its dance partners. Look at how great this is. Just a beautiful work in colored pencils.
01:00:59.848 - 01:01:13.950, Speaker A: Food is always an interesting topic. And let me just go through it here. I wonder, I have another work here. Is this the same artist? Here it is. Okay. Sauce packet. Maggie Margaret Cowles.
01:01:13.950 - 01:01:36.102, Speaker A: So again, a ketchup packet here. Just beautifully drawn, isn't it? Beautifully rendered. And here's Julian Pace. That could probably hang in the same show with a McDonald's drink. Kind of beautiful, non finito. Huge texture in this, you know, in this paint that's circling it. To me, what it looks like is someone who.
01:01:36.102 - 01:02:00.014, Speaker A: They were going to do the background and they just stopped right there. They just said, you know what? This is done. If I keep going, it's not going to look as good, which is the case, they kind of rightly stopped here. It almost looks like the charcoal or the black paint is bleeding into the white there as well. So that looks like oil, if I had to guess. Nice kind of work. Just a nice stroke down there.
01:02:00.014 - 01:02:23.760, Speaker A: Really nice piece. Julian Pace, two words made in America. And this is another artist, Morgan Voorh, Wilhelm Lundstrom, that we've been looking at here doing these super interesting textile works here, basically sewing into the canvas. More food, actually, of all things. I love that as a topic, food. That is your show. My friends, thank you for joining me today.
01:02:23.760 - 01:02:26.464, Speaker A: And until next time, take care.
