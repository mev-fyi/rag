00:00:02.600 - 00:00:37.854, Speaker A: Welcome back, everyone, to your newspaper of the imagination, broadcast around the world four times a week, believe it or not. Then we have the Twitter space on the Wednesday. This is a five day a week operation. So welcome back. Artist Journal, September 21, 2023, broadcasting from the cartographers workshop deep in inner space. My name is Adrian Pokebelly, and welcome back. And probably many of you already have seen this or know who this is.
00:00:37.854 - 00:01:04.402, Speaker A: This is Sabato, and we have seen many glitch roms. Almost every episode there's a series of glitch roms that I go through. There's just something about them that just give pleasure. So I love to look at them, and I find them poetic in their own way. And I love the challenge of the medium. I even bought a cheap pc at one point, which I haven't. I loaded up the programs, but I was just trying to do too many things.
00:01:04.402 - 00:01:38.844, Speaker A: You got to pick your battles. But I still have a cheap pc because I don't think it works on Mac. You know, this glitch rom software, at least I haven't seen any. It's kind of like these small softwares and whatnot. And so all to say, we see a lot of glitch roms, but this series here, there's two things that I love about it. The first actually is the color, particularly that kind of violet and yellow screen that we saw there, the colors. And maybe it's because it's Mario paint, which is the second reason I love this.
00:01:38.844 - 00:02:12.846, Speaker A: I love the meta of this work, the meta being we are taking a painting program from the super Mario paint, I think it's called, and we are taking that, or Sabato is taking that and glittering, glitching it out. So there's something just very general that I love about it. It kind of encapsulates so much. And as he says in the description, or as they say in the description, it is a digital painting. A digital painting. Here it is. Animation studio.
00:02:12.846 - 00:02:50.732, Speaker A: I love the title Le Myster Mario paint by Sabato Box. Sabato is great with titles, great with color, great with titles, automatic and gestural. I mean, you have to love this description here. Automatic and gestural digital paintings created by glitching Mario paint, Super Nintendo Roms and using the game's attract mode demos. So just an awesome piece. And you even have to love how Sabato did the page here on Zora where it is a free mint. Here you can choose how your page looks, and they have little templates.
00:02:50.732 - 00:03:23.674, Speaker A: I think you can also do them yourself. And so really nice color combination here. That light blue, so prement. And again, just kind of. It's the generality, like, it's the big picture ness of this work that I love because it kind of encapsulates to a certain degree in one way or another, you could say it's a form of encapsulation of this scene. It is taking video games, and we're going to get into the different generations of digital art. There is debate on this issue.
00:03:23.674 - 00:03:45.046, Speaker A: It's taking what I would call the second generation, whatever we want to call it. It's the people that grew up with video games and glitching the paint program. There's so much in here and it's done, but it's rendered so simply. It's. Let's take, you know. And it's an easy. In a sense, it's an obvious idea in retrospect.
00:03:45.046 - 00:04:13.146, Speaker A: Hey, let's do glitch roms of Mario paint. And maybe we've seen that before over, but I don't really recall. And maybe here and there, maybe lb did one. But there's just something really beautiful about that idea. And then you put a beautiful title of the series, beautiful title of the work. All of it together makes a beautiful product, I dare say. So.
00:04:13.146 - 00:04:39.484, Speaker A: Awesome, awesome. I was telling you about an image of the surrealist last episode, as we were saying, as I was calling it, a homage to inner vision. And here, this is a really important image. Now, I thought there was a magritte nude in the middle. I misremembered it. I hadn't seen this image in years. But what you see here, this is a very important image for me.
00:04:39.484 - 00:05:09.524, Speaker A: Or I would say, here you have Andre Breton here, Salvador Dali, Max Ernst, Yves Tanguy there. Basically, you have this surrealist group. And this wasn't an easy image to find, by the way. This was not an easy image to find. And I don't know who's in the middle. Maybe that's Paul Eloire, I don't know. And you see here, I'm not sure if you can see that, but the eyes are closed and then irises or, you know, are painted over top.
00:05:09.524 - 00:05:36.764, Speaker A: And so you see here, this kind of encapsulates this whole. You see how important inner vision was to the surrealists. Like, I think that's what we can say is going on here. Pardon the technical difficulties here on the hair here. So I just find this profoundly poetic. And it also brings about. It's not just the poetry, though.
00:05:36.764 - 00:06:46.208, Speaker A: It is also the philosophy and this idea I mean, as Ballard, JG Ballard, who I would argue to a certain degree reinterpreted the surrealists, kind of turned it systematized. I would actually argue philosophically, surrealism, as Ballard said repeatedly, he saw the innovations of the surrealists as on par with the discoveries in quantum physics. A fascinating, provocative idea that ultimately, this exploration of inner space, as Ballard called it. Again, this is how he codified this, what I'd call a kind of surrealist philosophy, which he argued persuasively, not to go too long on this, but which he argued persuasively, was the most logical way of dealing with the world that we live in. In this surrealist world that we live in. These people provide us with, as he would call it, the user's guide. A user's guide to dealing with.
00:06:46.208 - 00:07:12.224, Speaker A: With our current very surreal, media saturated world. Billboards. Massive billboards. I mean, you know, as he said, we can go into the introduction to crash, but you can just read it yourself. Politics conducted is a branch of advertising, an overlit realm. So all to say, this is an important image. It says a lot continuing on.
00:07:12.224 - 00:07:50.032, Speaker A: And by the way, there was an episode that I did about, I don't know, a month ago saying not all things make it online. This image was very difficult to find. The only way I found it, by the way, is on Pinterest, and you want to see something interesting. So Pinterest, I was like, oh, okay, now let's go to the original tweet. It's been removed, maybe for copyright reasons. So Pinterest kind of probably downloads the image to their server in order to keep it, to prevent this very thing. As you can see here.
00:07:50.032 - 00:08:17.824, Speaker A: Dalai Breton Tanguy, Sarah Bugnil. So surrealists here, just all to say, not everything makes it online. Or if it does, it doesn't necessarily stay online. Interestingly. And we see this also with a lot of, say, like Basquiat paintings. Sometimes you'll only get really low resolution versions now, whereas before you might be able to get more higher res versions. Just an interesting thing to note here.
00:08:17.824 - 00:08:40.909, Speaker A: So continuing on, thank you, everybody. Especially Kableen Ombelin. Kableen goes under Kablein one on Twitter for an awesome space yesterday with runetune. Rune tune. Loved it, too. It was a really just super interesting to hear unbelien's story. And it was just a great, great audience out there, too.
00:08:40.909 - 00:09:09.064, Speaker A: I mean, it was a big audience and everything. So thanks, everybody, for coming out and showing up. And Arthur, Mort or Arthur Moore, I think, is how you'd pronounce it who's actually is gonna be on next week. Came on stage and curating, exhibiting, collecting and writing about all things related to crypto art. Former Sotheby's NFT specialist. So Arthur Moore, if I'm pronouncing that right, is going to be on next week. So something to look forward to.
00:09:09.064 - 00:09:34.976, Speaker A: Just a heads up and has really nice things to say about Kabelene. Kabelene is a work, is a workaholic and perhaps the most professional, ethical and knowledgeable curator in the entire space. Respect by both the collectors and the artists. Respected by both the collectors and artists. If I had a structure, I'd try to hire her at all costs. So very nice words there for Kablin, also known as ombelin. That is her first name.
00:09:34.976 - 00:09:54.244, Speaker A: She was saying a medieval french name. A big thank you to Skomra. I have put a new promoted stories. I've been putting some of these on Zora. Thank you, Skomra, for the purchase. Now I'm going to put a few one of ones on tazos. A few kind words about the most evil man in mankind's history.
00:09:54.244 - 00:10:16.162, Speaker A: I didn't realize this was Emmanuel Kant, but someone was saying, what does Emmanuel have to say? I was like, oh, maybe that's who this is. So thank you to Skomra for the purchase there. That was awesome. And also a couple other sales very quickly. Magician back and picking up some poke bellies here. Mobile tracking station. These were sitting on the market for quite a while.
00:10:16.162 - 00:10:36.660, Speaker A: And wheatfield of the eight bit nature series. So thank you for the purchases. Magician, some comments here on last show. You're always. Thank you so much. Fernando Valente. You're always bringing an amazing show, tradscape, always showing us some legendary content is also really nice to see.
00:10:36.660 - 00:11:11.832, Speaker A: It's true if you go to tradscape speed, if I understand this comment correctly, and tradscape, of course, does the music for the opening of the show as well as the closing. Those were NFTs where tradscape gives permission to basically use them how you like. And yeah, so big shout out and big shout out to tradscape. It's also really nice to see some of my buddies in the show. People on Tezos are grinding and doing experiments. It's really nice to see you that you're watching and talking about them. So, yeah, people on Tazos, I agree, they are grinding and trying things out.
00:11:11.832 - 00:11:27.576, Speaker A: The auctions have been going pretty well. Bijou, I think, picked up a few of them for pretty nice prices. How much did the work yesterday. Go for. We'll see. We'll see as it comes. Let's continue on here.
00:11:27.576 - 00:11:43.388, Speaker A: Retro Manny. Well, this is awkward. So referring to not private shop, but pirate ship. As I went off on talking about all the different ways I can monetize. But Manny was just talking about getting on the pirate ship. But thanks for the shout out. Now I need to get my hands on that ticket from Ed.
00:11:43.388 - 00:12:01.932, Speaker A: Yeah, if you go to Ed's feed, I think if you put in maybe search Pokebelly and you'll see a pirate ship sort of thing. We're joking and it is just an ongoing joke. Maybe we do something with it, maybe we don't. About that being the ticket to the pirate ship. There are 200. They're like a tazos. Each great episode, as usual.
00:12:01.932 - 00:12:25.264, Speaker A: Really appreciate when you show artists like Harvey Dean. These pieces really resonate with me. The attention to detail and the nostalgia always hits the. Another artist similar worth checking out is Gordon Zuckold. And I actually brought up some Gordon Zuckold here, just so people know who we are talking about. And there's actually some music here. So this is Gordon Zuckold.
00:12:25.264 - 00:12:54.952, Speaker A: So just some cool pixel art, kind of cinematic. I mean, it's a. It's a four minute. I mean, how astonishing is that? This is a four minute loop. So that is wild. So short story bastard or buying cat food in New harbor. So like a movie here.
00:12:54.952 - 00:13:07.044, Speaker A: So that is who Gordon Zuckold is. So great mention there. Salier, salieri, AI. I've already. I've already incorporated my daily dose of art. Great as always. Keep it up.
00:13:07.044 - 00:13:54.034, Speaker A: You are more than welcome and thank you for the encouraging comments. Definitions of digital art and this is what I was mentioning earlier here, definitions of digital art, glitch art specific as that's where I'm from. Precursors in this category, we could say is Stan Brakhidge, Jordan Belson, I've heard of Nam June Paik and others, including Dan Sandeen, creator of the Sandeen image processor. Thus godfather to video circuits based analog glitch art, which we see almost every show here. So here we're talking about different generations of, I guess, digital or glitch art. Let's see. First generation those who made pre Internet as we know it, but still on computers or with computer based hardware software, possibly using bulletin boards.
00:13:54.034 - 00:14:57.092, Speaker A: Second generation artist making work pre social media and often under the loose title of netartists. Maybe a convenient starting point would be the release of Windows 95 and the take up browsers such as Netscape and Internet Explorer. This era could be defined as ending sometime around the start of Facebook in 2007. 3rd generation, those starting to make and propagate work via social media websites such as Facebook, Reddit, Tumblr especially, and other sites such as YouTube, Instagram and Twitter especially. For the NFT space and fourth generation, it's possible the fourth generation would be better defined from the move to mobile devices, away from desktop or laptops and into apps or apps on devices. I guess my concern, it's an interesting thesis, and maybe this is how it should be. So again, I'm never asking people to agree with me, but I guess if I was to ponder on this, I guess my concern might be that, I guess when I say the second generation of digital art, it's kind of.
00:14:57.092 - 00:16:19.358, Speaker A: Maybe it's just a loose way of saying there seems to be something different in the aesthetic of people who have grown up with video games. And I suspect, and though even a lot of these artists will say that, that, you know, the aesthetics of video games is something, and we see it in the art, whether it's like showing a game Boy, whether it is, you know, in Gogolitis, we're going to see a great work by Gogolitis, which is almost like a computer game. So, yeah, I mean, so we saw Kareem's work yesterday, which also seems to celebrate the video games. We see this often, and we're going to see it as usual, we'll see it today as well. And so I guess my thought to me, this is almost, it may be technically true from an abstract, but I just like, there are pixel artists that started, say, in 2002, so. But are they, you know, pre Facebook? I think it gets confusing. I think, put it this way, philosophically, I think we need to use the art itself as the guide, shall we say, of, if we're going to try and categorize this, these generations, so to speak, we might want to call them waves, but if we're to try and categorize these, I want to use the art itself.
00:16:19.358 - 00:17:24.084, Speaker A: And for me, there's something inherently different in this kind of nostalgic joy that takes place in celebrating the pixel and video game aesthetics, one might say, and referencing them. And there's something kind of distinct about that vibe that comes from the art that is different from, you know, I see it a lot out here at the digital art museum, which if you ever come to Berlin, you should go to. I think it's still going, the physical space, if the digital, you know, the earlier, you know, a lot of it's german, but you know, from around the world. But there's a lot of early digital art. It's a little more abstract and cold, shall we say, for lack of better word. And so to me, I see a different, like, that's why I almost want to say generation. It's almost like parents versus the kids, and the kids are going, that's all fine and good, but we're over here and that's what we care about, and that's kind of how it feels to me.
00:17:24.084 - 00:17:39.196, Speaker A: So. Yeah, but thank you for the super interesting comments. And there may be actually a lot to what you're saying here. And there is a. It is persuasive in. In the way that this is divided up. And maybe you're like, maybe this is coming from.
00:17:39.196 - 00:17:59.740, Speaker A: I don't know if this is coming from a textbook, for all we know. For all I know. So maybe this has all been figured out already, and I'm just trying to figure it out on the spot here, trying to remake history here. Thank you for the comments. Crash stop. That was fascinating. And feel free to again, share more as we go here.
00:17:59.740 - 00:18:31.604, Speaker A: So, Jack, according to TZKT, we currently have 12,000 object users per month. We're not many, but we are good. So quite interesting. Hey, so at the heights, we had just under 30,000. Considering that the prices for a lot of crypto are down 90%, I actually think this is a very impressive number here. And I'm actually kind of. And you see, it's like, it's kind of like it's.
00:18:31.604 - 00:19:03.486, Speaker A: It's not dropping precipitously, as it did say, after the peak here in January, let's say, 2022, it looks like that was basically when nfts peaked as well. From a financial perspective. I remember there was a big boom when the mfers. I had like nine of those things went to six ETH, and unfortunately, I didn't sell any because I thought they were going to 50. That's how it goes, though. We learn as we go. So all to say 12,000 object users.
00:19:03.486 - 00:19:31.174, Speaker A: I talk about how this is probably a couple thousand people. This scene sounds about right, doesn't it? Because if there's 12,000 users, well, who's. There's probably about three or four Macs that are kind of in here daily. This is probably people who log in like once a month, maybe sometimes artists who are, you know, not necessarily. So all to say, interesting. How small? Small, but not too small. We are not many, but we are good.
00:19:31.174 - 00:20:15.218, Speaker A: Sad news from demon ego. Please read my object account may have been hacked. Today, someone else connected to my object account accepted an offer and immediately transferred 258 tezos to a new wallet. Since these two transactions took place very quickly and the amount stolen from me was not visible in the account sent, I guess it was a bot attack. I'm not an expert on this, you know, I remember the last time I heard Francoise Gammer was the last person I heard who got hacked, and that it's just horrible for artists, especially this heartless, these heartless hackers. Please do not collect anything, anything on my object account for now. I mean, imagine an artist having to say this.
00:20:15.218 - 00:20:41.340, Speaker A: Please do not collect anything from me. I'm trying to contact Kukai wallet. Also, if the main account of mine is really hacked in such a way that even transaction can be controlled, unfortunately, this scenario may happen. We'll have to open a new account with regret. I'm so sorry about this situation. I don't know how it happened, so that is just terrible to see. And my heart goes out to you, demon ego.
00:20:41.340 - 00:21:07.880, Speaker A: And if anybody knows how to help, send demon ego a message. Another interesting comment here. Anis Abdin, the great pixel artist here. Look at this. This may sound insignificant to some of you, but today I had a rough one at work and felt completely oppressed. I think we've all felt that in our lives. I've worked hard on a project for three months just to find out that a quote unquote first class citizen colleague will get all the press attention and credit.
00:21:07.880 - 00:21:38.884, Speaker A: When I questioned about what was going on, he actually had the audacity to call me, and he literally said, who's here? A higher class? So clearly, this person has issues. Feeling bad, I came home and found out at an auction that an auction had started on Voyager. This gave me little hope and a push to throw these kind of people behind my back and continue my journey in creating art and sharing it with the world. I can't wait to be able to quit and relocate one day. It'll happen. Yeah. Just stay focused on that and relocate.
00:21:38.884 - 00:22:01.794, Speaker A: Interesting. Yeah. So beautiful work here. And kind of like, I guess we could call it a happy ending, getting a bid, only, like, I mean, this work is cheap. I mean, Anis Abdin is a great pixel artist, as we have another. He's been posting a lot of work, and you see how interesting and innovative as a pixel artist he is. 0.15
00:22:01.794 - 00:22:31.014, Speaker A: ETH, pretty reasonable. So, yeah, uh, it's just. Yeah, reality sucks sometimes, doesn't it? Mikey de la creme just got pulled over after picking up my myth hoodie from Crypton XYZ officer took one look at the hoodie and kept it moving. He didn't want no smoke. And here, look at how beautiful this hoodie is here. So if you are interested in your myth paraphernalia, your myth merchandise, look at how great that is. Go to crypton.com
00:22:31.014 - 00:22:51.622, Speaker A: dot IO and you can find all sorts new. The myth times krypton. So beautiful over here. So how much is this? $79 or the t shirt is 39. Pretty reasonable. Continuing on, clownvamp has sold out. So congrats to Clownvamp Detective Jack the cold case.
00:22:51.622 - 00:23:11.544, Speaker A: Minted out 500 pieces of alt history mystery Barbie noir that uses a new story mechanic, the case file selling out in the depth of of a brutal bear market. In short, I feel love. Including how we find what's next. Including how we find Tiffany. So I think they're at 0.1 ETH. So, I mean, that turns into 50 ETH in the middle of a bear market.
00:23:11.544 - 00:23:28.018, Speaker A: I mean, that's like $100,000 or what is that, like $80,000? Huge. Congrats to clownvamp. That is impressive, if I have that right. I mean, that is incredible. Sky Goodman. So proud of this exhibit. So this is at the I'm not art show in Chicago.
00:23:28.018 - 00:23:57.598, Speaker A: So proud of this exhibit. We nearly sold out every single work from the show. Only two editions remain of Kapow's work. Opening was packed and full of great energy. What a success. So, you know, as we saw here, with the wallets, with clownvap, with sky in Chicago, here, the market, this scene is far from dead. Is one conclusion that we could come to rare, and that's from a market perspective.
00:23:57.598 - 00:24:25.972, Speaker A: And just like people logging in and everything, 12,000. It's not terrible. Again, in the depths of a bear market, considering the peak was 31,000 users monthly. Rare tomorrow's mint, Edith and spot is based off the painting the honorable Edith Helen Chaplin Marionis of Londonberry DbE with her favorite greyhound. So this is by Philip Alexios Delazio. Continuing with juxtapose of old and new surrealist technological paintings. So here we see the comparison.
00:24:25.972 - 00:24:44.380, Speaker A: So here, of course, is rare's work. And here is the original. So a few clues here into Rare's process. And a really nice piece here, a poetic work from rare. And a little bit in the process here. Problems with paintings like this is that spot has no neck. You shouldn't be able to see his face.
00:24:44.380 - 00:25:10.172, Speaker A: So there is spot. So fudging the drawing sum using 3d assets as a reference, because there's no way I can afford one of these guys yet. So using 3d assets. So this is probably. Yeah. So in other words, rare can't afford a Boston dynamics dog yet. Who knows how much they go for? So using 3d software, it appears trying to capture a feeling instead of a direct one of one copy.
00:25:10.172 - 00:25:44.718, Speaker A: So that is interesting, too, I'd say wisely, even trying to take into account oxidization and color correctness. I learn every time I do one of these pastiches. And who was it? I think it was Sabato saying, with the Keith haring, it's well worth your time to make copies. We are all standing on the shoulders of titans. And so finally here, when you look at the pieces all together, it starts to make sense. Taking today in modern placing into victorian, 17th, 18th, and 19th century, and even comparing real oil paintings from masters to using digital means to make them look authentic. So here are other works by rare.
00:25:44.718 - 00:26:25.442, Speaker A: We've seen all these. And rare always puts these beautiful simulated paintings here in the gallery. And wouldn't that just look grand? So very cool there from rare. A little on the process jumping into the work. Curator by axin. So always, I mean, axin has very complicated narratives. I mean, if so, the curator here, perhaps with the skull here, the teddy bear, with perhaps clown paint on the face here, crying, maybe dripping paint of sorts, dripping light paint, art made of blocks.
00:26:25.442 - 00:26:48.350, Speaker A: And then maybe these tears are running down over here. And beautifully painted here. So a little meta on the art scene here. And look at this beautiful brushwork over here. So a complicated narrative. I'm not exactly sure exactly what the commentary is, and maybe we're not supposed to. It's good that it's not overly literal or, as my friend says, overly didactic.
00:26:48.350 - 00:27:00.444, Speaker A: Like this is. You know, this takes some interpreting. And there is the teddy bear. Let's see if there's anything else. No, just 2023. So this is her. Nine tezos on secondary.
00:27:00.444 - 00:27:19.904, Speaker A: And selling out at. Let's just see here. Look at all the action here. 44 tezos on primary. Pretty reasonable for an axcene edition of 21 on object. Cool title inside, number one. So, rustic digital art coming back again and again, playing with the synths.
00:27:19.904 - 00:27:50.386, Speaker A: One of our favorite icons here. Or image. Some of our favorite imagery on this show here. And this piano. Kind of beautiful here with the sheet music and just showing the top there. A little cigarette plant, kind of half painted, kind of very modern and painterly, isn't it? And even, like a windows looking computer here and a lamp there's. Something very kind of capital m modern feeling like almost like early 20th century in this beautiful digital painting here.
00:27:50.386 - 00:28:02.498, Speaker A: This is an edition of ten. There are still a few left here. Two left at five tezos. Really nice inside number one. So beautiful piece. Even the title is kind of modern sounding. Early 20th century sounding.
00:28:02.498 - 00:28:26.774, Speaker A: Rinnefish, cappy bug marathon. So another work by rinnefish. See if there's any volume. No volume on this one. So another cool, translucent pastel monster here. Or bug, shall we say, with really big teeth here and beautiful eyes and that beautiful noise and looks, looking like a cat is hanging off the back of this work here. Edition of 15.
00:28:26.774 - 00:28:51.134, Speaker A: And let's just see. Maybe taking offers. Offers are coming in. Not listed yet. Beautiful. And continuing on, this is machine whose work we've seen before here on this show. I don't know if this is new, but just such a, you know, I've been talking about, like, alternative digital art or indie digital art maybe is a better way of putting it.
00:28:51.134 - 00:29:17.784, Speaker A: This is one of those artists too, that I just think are so interesting. Easy to pass over on a first glance. But when you really look, you just think of how strangely original this is. Boldly, I start to say courageously original, and you just start to go, this is really interesting. Challenging. These are challenging works. So that is machine.
00:29:17.784 - 00:29:33.024, Speaker A: And I don't know if that's a new work. So I love my beautifulest ex friends. So having fun on Twitter. Great to see and hear. Let's just give that a like. And this was quite interesting too. I think Rob, I think, might run foundation.
00:29:33.024 - 00:29:50.474, Speaker A: This became part of a space world minted on super rare. So you can do that. I've done this, actually, where if you're on super rare, you can mint it there and then you list it on foundation if you want to be part of a. A world that is doable. So current bids. .169. Bit of a bidding war here.
00:29:50.474 - 00:30:12.422, Speaker A: So that is cool. 0.10.12. So again, kind of not bad in a bear market here. And a pretty interesting work. Kind of has also a bit of a modern feel. I mean, it feels pretty original, doesn't it? It's almost, you know what it reminds me of if I had to. It's kind of like a Picasso.
00:30:12.422 - 00:30:51.760, Speaker A: And it's almost like, actually Salvador Dali's portrait of Picasso. So let's see if we can find that portrait of Picasso. Dali loved Picasso. Here it is. And so you see here kind of, I mean, that's pretty far reference, but kind of this is a beautiful portrait. Isn't it? So here, but just kind of like pretty original work here. The artist, lest we forget, is Baisu, B E I S S U, created and developed by the brazilian artist Pedro Ribeiro, also known as baisu.
00:30:51.760 - 00:31:32.468, Speaker A: So really interesting, cool work there. Artist on superwear, NUv 1914, visitante. So we're talking about kind of indie, indie digital art. Here we have another one from NUV 1914, who has been quite prolific as of late. And here again, what I'm tempted to call like a gradient artist of sorts here, but really bold decisions here. And again, doing what seems to be a plant, these leaves seem to be circular gradients here, this interesting stripe, this beautiful, kind of almost like it was the framing device, but then removed the other three. Just beautiful.
00:31:32.468 - 00:31:53.854, Speaker A: So interesting, right? And challenging. I picked one up, visitante. Cool title. Again, this looks very like Capital M, modern in kind of tone. There's almost, again, it kind of has that almost cubist kind of feel to it, but completely different. Also, another kind of experimental work by Zuozo. So remember the bear.
00:31:53.854 - 00:32:52.774, Speaker A: Now, this one does not have audio, but another just super challenging work, I would say. Look at the, again, the foliage here, look at the leaves in this case, and what looks like an agricultural, you know, setting here with clouds almost in the background. I mean, the boldness of what's going on here. Not afraid, again, to challenge the viewer here, only three tezos shiki Ono revisited. Again, this is the sort of stuff on the first glance, it can be hard to understand, but then when you look and you start to appreciate, it really starts to resonate. So, edition of 2019, available for three tezos, asteroid Pixel City. So an interesting animated abstract work here.
00:32:52.774 - 00:33:17.784, Speaker A: And almost playing with these gradients here, these fuzzy cubes, again, kind of fit with the last work here. So put those together. This is on object for five tezos, an edition of eleven, sorry, of 20. And there are eleven left. So interesting work from Federo Pazza. And here's some of the other work. Let me give a follow here.
00:33:17.784 - 00:33:35.224, Speaker A: Just found their work on Twitter. This was a really interesting work here. This is with gallery data, cygnathunda. This is a video, 30 seconds. So I assume the artist is Simon Lazarus, 84. So maybe born in 1984. Let's just see this thing.
00:33:35.224 - 00:34:15.074, Speaker A: So again, challenging, very challenging work here. And you have these super soft, you know, shapes here. And that is contrasting with pretty sharp, almost pixel esque. Here's you got, like, super sharp black and white, you know, pixel like work, as you see here, too. So almost, you know, geometric, super precise and that is contrasting with the colored super soft kind of brushwork. Very interesting experimentation. This turned into an edition of one Bijou, bought them all for 50 tezos each and burnt four.
00:34:15.074 - 00:34:40.904, Speaker A: So it continues on the burning front here. Lxt XCX computer saudade. Now this is a new one, interestingly, on versum. So versum is still going, by the way, and look at how much this is going for on secondary. Let me just see what this minted out for 20 tezos each. Again, challenging. And so here are some windows with some interesting gradients.
00:34:40.904 - 00:35:15.003, Speaker A: I mean, just there is the Hourglass classic, kind of early two thousands, late nineties windows. So just very interesting work. An old monitor, fascinating edition of ten. Let's quickly look at LTX CX's work here and look at just very interesting, original and challenging work here. So fascinating, these gradients. And by Vicky, Dan. This is by Vicky, Dan Control and Marcel Muntianu.
00:35:15.003 - 00:35:52.400, Speaker A: So three people working together, fully made from gradient paintings of impressive digital and traditional painter Dan control. Metahuman model by Vicky Conceptual digital fashion and two and a half D surreal ready made accessories by Marcel Muntianu. So just an interesting GLB here. Almost has a Magritte feel to it with the person in the suit there, with the clouds on the suit and there looks like Dan control. Cigarettes and lighters in the pocket. I guess we can zoom in here and look at that. I mean, that almost looks like NUV 1914, but maybe that's Dan control.
00:35:52.400 - 00:36:11.164, Speaker A: I wonder if Dan was influenced by NUv 1914. You know, gradient artists, right? So they could all hang in the same show, that's for sure. So cool work here, 250 tezos. I guess that's on secondary. So sold out. Kika Nikolayla put it on secondary there. Sold out at 20 tezos.
00:36:11.164 - 00:36:34.844, Speaker A: Pretty awesome. Another awesome work by Gozo. So we were singing the praises of Gozo here. I was singing the praises maybe last week, electric whisper. This is Dina Chang's new curated show on object one. This is one of the works here. And again, let's not forget what Gozo was saying.
00:36:34.844 - 00:37:16.224, Speaker A: Remember that comment that Gozo left out after the show? That these are made in stable diffusion at low resolution and then upscaled. So this is why you're getting this incredibly both original work. It's using AI, but then it's making collage out of the AI. And to me this sounds like a very exciting avenue for AI or sorry, for collage using AI elements. And here we see it to stunning effect. To absolutely stunning effect here. And you see, you know, it's always worth trying out new things as an artist, and you always have to, again, like, I've brought this subject up, but not for a while.
00:37:16.224 - 00:38:14.866, Speaker A: You know, artists often feel like, in the gallery system, often feel like they get trapped, because basically, whatever series they're working on that got them basically in the gallery, often there will be pressure for them to keep making that kind of work or not deviate too far away from it, because that's what the gallery thinks they can sell, right? So sometimes artists can get all the way, make it to the gallery, they've made it, and then they're kind of depressed and they feel trapped. And so here with Gozo, as we were looking at last, last time we were looking at Gozos work, Gozo has, like, some quite different other work, and it pays to try different things that promoted stories, series. Interestingly, like, I'd been working on that series since 2016. It was my first show in Berlin, promoted stories. But it was only in the last couple of months where I had this idea, literally for years, of how I wanted to do these things. I finally started applying it, and then I was like, oh, this is great. And I'm super excited and inspired to do it now.
00:38:14.866 - 00:38:45.060, Speaker A: And I working on it all the time. And so all to say, it's important, like, if you get bored with doing your work, it's good to stay consistent, right, and not do too many things. But it's also important to experiment, because look at what Gozo is doing. You never know what you're not doing. You know, the opportunity cost. It's like investing, you know, what is the opportunity cost? Continuing on while growing under the nasty smell of pleasure. So this is a demon ego from ten days ago that I had missed.
00:38:45.060 - 00:39:05.360, Speaker A: This is also in the space world showcase with a reserve of only 0.2 ETH. So another super interesting work by demon ego. And I don't think we saw this one with some really cool kind of iconography. Almost looks like egyptian over here. Hieroglyphs. And also just some nice dithered areas here.
00:39:05.360 - 00:39:31.464, Speaker A: Just, you know, really fun over here with this kind of spiraling pattern over here. Again, making it look easy. Combining digital and physical. Really making it look easy here. And just beautiful. Very structured works. Almost reminiscent for me of almost like these kind of medieval works sometimes those altar pieces.
00:39:31.464 - 00:39:43.300, Speaker A: Yeah. So just beautiful. And look at these colors. Everything just beautiful. Only 0.2 ETH reserve stalka with a very cool drawing here. Let's just maximize that.
00:39:43.300 - 00:40:17.900, Speaker A: So stalke is on object, I think also maybe on foundation as well. A really beautiful poetic work here of friends. Like, looks like the same person, but maybe friends are the same person sharing a cigarette here. And just a really. I'm a big fan of Stalka's paintings and illustrations, primarily because it feels like a lot of contemporary illustration. Feels very. The reason I call it contemporary illustration is because it feels like a commentary on our world that we live in.
00:40:17.900 - 00:40:41.106, Speaker A: We see it with Adelia, who has taken a bit of a break. I haven't seen Adelia put out new work for a while. If anybody knows or has seen newer work, just let me know. So anyways, really cool work here from Stalka. Love it. A new work on Zora from Burka Bayram. And so, as you can see here, this is Icarus.
00:40:41.106 - 00:41:17.896, Speaker A: And of course, Icarus is the son, as it was saying here, of Daedalus, think kind of like a machine maker, quote unquote, from ancient greek mythology. And the sun made the wings for Icarus, Daedalus's son, flying too close to the sun and told him not to fly too close to the sun. But a story of youth going too far, too wild does fly too close to the sun, doesn't listen to the parents. And unfortunately, the wings, I think, made of wax, melt and Icarus falls into the sea. So a classic mythological scene here. Now, this is super interesting. It's minted on Zora.
00:41:17.896 - 00:41:45.184, Speaker A: Look at the background. I'm going to try and cycle through these. Maybe they are all the same. I thought perhaps, because I saw here, I thought perhaps they were different, but maybe these are all the same, but they look kind of different, don't they? So I'm not exactly sure what's going on here, but it's pretty cool. And it is a free mint, and I believe it is burka byrams. Genesis work on Zora. So very cool over there.
00:41:45.184 - 00:42:00.324, Speaker A: Here's Burka Bayram. Just a tweet that came out. Look at how brilliant this is. This is the dance, of course, by Matisse. La dance. And just a beautiful kind of homage here in Burka Bayram style, I thought. A brilliant work.
00:42:00.324 - 00:42:17.252, Speaker A: Continuing on. Look at this experimentation by Santiago here. Very good. Afternoon. Looking interesting. And first of all, we're seeing a few different kinds of textures. We're seeing some what look like perhaps kind of sampled and brushes.
00:42:17.252 - 00:42:43.362, Speaker A: That's the way we get dragged here. Also, we're seeing a bit of experimentation, it seems, with these kind of diagonal squares. So kind of interesting how Santiago keeps pushing things. And let's not forget that hundred tweet thread that that person had made of Santiago's work. And when you see it all together, it's actually astonishing. Again, there's something to be said for being prolific. And here is one more.
00:42:43.362 - 00:43:05.658, Speaker A: Speaking of being prolific, memory of NFT war in outer space is from the eyes of someone watching beach volleyball. Beach volley. So also by Santiago, edition of 20. And this massive, another 13,000 by 10,000 piece work. And yeah, big shout out to Santiago for showing up on the spaces yesterday. Always appreciated. So another.
00:43:05.658 - 00:43:31.102, Speaker A: Just interesting work. Almost a white background here. It's probably a little bit off white, but not positive. Just another really interesting abstract artwork. So, Ed Marolla with a new work, and look at how rough this is. Speaking of the experimentation, again, when you're putting out so much work to keep it interesting for yourself, you're going to try stuff out. And so here, kind of blurring stuff out.
00:43:31.102 - 00:44:04.240, Speaker A: Kind of different looking textures over here, isn't there? Almost looks physical and some kind of rubbed outs sort of areas here, making an interesting contrast. And almost like distorted pixels. Just using pixels, you can tell it's made with like, a pixel brush, these skeletons, but processed so much that it starts to lose that pixelation and just becomes a kind of texture. And here you see two skeletons having a picnic with maybe the grim reaper coming. And this beautiful frame here. Totally awesome. Getting ready for a new genesis in a new chain.
00:44:04.240 - 00:44:22.216, Speaker A: So I wonder what that is, because Ed's already been on Zora. So what chain could that be? Very cool. Maybe it's. Maybe it'll be. If I had to guess, maybe it will be on avalanche. Maybe zero one. Another work in progress from Ed here.
00:44:22.216 - 00:44:37.164, Speaker A: Almost looking like a pope in a chair, but not quite. And just an interesting work. So you see Ed working in procreate there. So constantly working here. And one more on Zora. Abstract dream. And this has some music.
00:44:37.164 - 00:45:05.308, Speaker A: Let me see if I can increase. There you go. Look at that. This beautiful city. The turntable with the speakers, the person listening, even this noise up here. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. So this is a free mint.
00:45:05.308 - 00:45:38.294, Speaker A: So, you know, I've been kind of lazy about doing these free mints on Zora, I think. But I'm starting to go, like, you know what? This could be a huge missed opportunity. I was thinking to myself, if I don't mint a lot of this stuff, because there's a lot of just kind of great works that are basically a couple of bucks. Ed Marolla, one more. I mean, look at how much work Ed's putting out this one on tazos. And a very kind of fun work here. Small piece, maybe 100 pixels by 100.
00:45:38.294 - 00:45:54.252, Speaker A: This kind of cat figure. I think Ed's playing with a theremin. Perhaps he was mentioning that recently. Kind of sounds like a theremin in the background. First theremin gem. There you go. Only a tezos.
00:45:54.252 - 00:46:09.184, Speaker A: I picked one up. Look at this. Beautiful, beautiful work by Mewgi. Started as an addition of ten, then burnt, and then made an addition of one. I think a great idea. There is something about this will sell, I'm convinced. And look at how beautiful these different textures are.
00:46:09.184 - 00:46:42.706, Speaker A: And it's just like a gorgeous abstract work here. And the colors, you know, credit to muji, changing up the colors here, this beautiful green, and just everything, like, just beautiful. These textures are just gorgeous in each of these little windows here, as well as in here, the cycling, you know, rainbow gradient, a shining component, a small component meant to fulfill a great purpose. So very cool work from Yuji. One of one. And how much was that? Let's just see. 170 tezos, $113.
00:46:42.706 - 00:47:00.250, Speaker A: Beautiful. You can guess the artistmect. Txt with a work on Twitter. If you find a gate seemingly out of nowhere on your way home tonight, do not enter. So almost kind of looking like a japanese style gate of some kind. Cool work from mech. Txt.
00:47:00.250 - 00:47:14.284, Speaker A: And look at Kappen. Drifting spheres. So perhaps a preview. So this, I don't think. I didn't see it minted anywhere. But you gotta love this static sun. I mean, it would have been so tempting, right, to make this move.
00:47:14.284 - 00:47:39.836, Speaker A: And I kind of love how it's not moving and it's beautiful. Like these beautiful horizontal kind of and even but. But done in the horizontal pixels, seemingly. Or lines within these vertical structures that make up this round sun. And even kind of the noise around of the sun. A beautiful portrait of the sun. Maybe this is the earth here and different planets, perhaps.
00:47:39.836 - 00:47:59.270, Speaker A: Maybe that's Mercury. So you see this looks cosmic, doesn't it? So this looks like the solar system, doesn't it? So just super cool drifting spheres. Great title. Another brilliant work here from Kappen. A day inside a dream. And so finally, a new mint from Kapna. This is at eleven have been minted.
00:47:59.270 - 00:48:33.148, Speaker A: I picked one up, five tezos, 55 tezos cents for the super poetic work here. Sometimes these open mints don't end up getting that many mints. So they do, because sometimes you can be discouraged as a collector on the open mint because you think 100 will be minted, but it doesn't always happen. And sometimes they turn into low editions. So it's an interesting thing to keep tabs on the open editions. And they continue to be popular. Haiti Rocket with a few works yesterday, a few works coming out.
00:48:33.148 - 00:49:08.014, Speaker A: This looks like Kurt Hussle collective, if I've ever seen KHC's prices before. This is at hacker and just a really cool busy Nintendo glitch. Rom by Haiti Rocket here. And just really kind of a noisy one. Really kind of glitched out here and almost looking like the diamonds and the spades have been put in maybe instead of text, not sure, but it's beautiful. And then this figure, this alien type person on the top. Beautiful edition of five only.
00:49:08.014 - 00:49:35.374, Speaker A: So you gotta be quick. I picked this one up. There is Kurt Hussle collective again, I am guessing. Oh, no, they are next in line here. Tubular puzzle. I was able to pick up one of these, kind of like a pin up style work here, I guess some video game looks, maybe japanese writing, maybe like a manga or anime type video game work. And look at this great, like Ford, what I call kind of four to the four, four to the floor, pixelation.
00:49:35.374 - 00:49:57.162, Speaker A: And then this great noise here. Just a beautiful work. And how it inverts here or changes color. I mean, it's awesome. So again, as we look at the influence of video games hookups, bit of a racier one here, but the colors are insanely beautiful here, especially the orange, the dark orange, the light orange, and the white and black. Just beautiful. Just a beautiful work here.
00:49:57.162 - 00:50:15.292, Speaker A: Edition of five. Unfortunately, I missed this one and this. Yeah, so you got to be quick here, look. Minted, listed at 20 112, burnt at 20 115. So you gotta be quick with Haiti rocket. Another Nintendo glitchrom. Silva sand two s with pirates.
00:50:15.292 - 00:50:47.624, Speaker A: And here we see racing games work really well too with glitchrom. So another cool work by Silva Santus, who stays very consistent here with the glitchroms pirates. Cool title, 343 tazos 40 edition of 13. And we're going to speed right along here, chaz Pac man. So more video game references. And this was a super cool one, again, referencing Pac man on a retro computer. Some food, old joystick here and a mouse.
00:50:47.624 - 00:51:27.434, Speaker A: So combining kind of different eras here. A little bit, a little bit. And Pac man is the title, latest video game classic to be lovingly recreated in Lego. Interesting. Here is another reference to video games. So whatever we decide or figure out on the generations of digital art, one thing's for sure is there definitely does need to be a place that one thing we know is that video games have had a huge impact on this generation. Constant celebration here.
00:51:27.434 - 00:51:38.062, Speaker A: Question, what do you get? And here we see the. We just love it. And I love it, you know, and I wasn't even a huge video game player. I have played Mario. And again, here we go again. Go, go. Litus kitty training.
00:51:38.062 - 00:52:14.884, Speaker A: So a new one from gogolitis, I think, taking offers. So super fun. Looks like a bit of a development here in the shiny pixels here in these kind of areas over here underneath. So continuing to evolve and develop. And great colors here with this beautiful kind of orange boiling lava, let's say. And then putting the reflection. So cool light in this one with the cats show, the jumping cats taking the reflection when they're close, and then when they go away, the reflection disappears as they go through this cycle here.
00:52:14.884 - 00:52:40.110, Speaker A: Super interesting work from Gogolitis kitty training. And the offers are coming in. Not sure how it goes as far as what you need to offer. So check out Google idis's twitter feed if you're interested. Do you wish to continue me pixel? So again, old retro technology, old video games, pixelation, old menus. Awesome. And here's another one.
00:52:40.110 - 00:53:16.904, Speaker A: And look at this, notoriousman ETH. So this is often we see notoriousman Xtz. So now on ETH, putting a one of one, I believe, on foundation and changing it up. Remember, notorious man often does these very wide angle works. And so here, changing it up with a almost square work here. And kind of this almost like a wanderer type work by Caspar David Friedrich. Yeah, almost a reference to the wanderer or in that style, shall we say, already dreaming.
00:53:16.904 - 00:53:41.056, Speaker A: And here's another one thinking about you. So just this kind of really poetic pixel art here. And here's another one. This is 25 tezos, and there's 3 hours left. So maybe there's a chance, if you watch this early, to run and get it. And this beautiful pink sea here. So different works here, but a common thread of these people looking over into the landscapes.
00:53:41.056 - 00:54:02.654, Speaker A: Kind of got a romantic feel to it. It capital R and Anis Abdin. And again, these guys could show in the same show, couldn't they? Happiness is a small. Is a smell of fresh laundry. Indeed. And here, just another beautiful, almost impressionistic style work. This could be like a kind of monet of sorts in terms of subject matter and composition.
00:54:02.654 - 00:54:27.616, Speaker A: Semha waiting for the black hole sun. So we've been looking at Semha's work on Twitter, and here's another one. We saw that kind of cosmic work with the doorway. And here is just another kind of metaphysical looking work. Let's continue on and speed up a bit here. Cantabrika, this is by coke ETH, so this is on Zora as well. So just an interesting work here with some.
00:54:27.616 - 00:54:55.876, Speaker A: Again, I don't know if I assume that's japanese writing. Not positive on that. This is part of the wavedrop and the next wave collective on Zora. So I think you can just go to the homepage 254 minted so far, so minting out quite well. Renky with another super cool animated abstract work. Almost taking these noisy pixels and then forcing them into this structure here. So maybe using more than one software, I am assuming there's probably some exporting going on here.
00:54:55.876 - 00:55:32.632, Speaker A: Almost looks like scribbles that have been kind of exported into these animated cubes that are kind of distorting. Super interesting work from Renki. This is called Yu. This is an edition of ten for nine tezos each, and Datura with a work edition of seven Arkad architectonic and patterns. And Datura is always interesting because it's always verging on abstraction, but there is usually a representation. And look at these great vertical lines here for the sky. And then of course some kind of classic Datura noise and animation, so to speak, in the structures here.
00:55:32.632 - 00:55:45.560, Speaker A: And glitching. Great work as usual. One is available on secondary for 42, let's just see. Went for seven tezos on primary. Went pretty quick. So nice work. Datura.
00:55:45.560 - 00:56:08.296, Speaker A: Check this out. Somfei. I don't know if this was Star wars or where this source imagery came from. Kind of reminds me of like that Star wars, like old retro, like old looking, like, is this the Death Star? I don't know, but it looks great, doesn't it? Just really, really cool. You just gotta love it. This is a gif. I couldn't find it.
00:56:08.296 - 00:56:37.610, Speaker A: I don't think there was a link to it. So just really, really cool work from Somfei. Here's another one, an edition of one on object, a Rose Berkuse. So kind of looking abstract, but the title is not so abstract. So maybe it's a rose that is kind of expanding or cycling through, really kind of fuzzy, fuzzed out, almost out of focus. The edge here, I mean, very interesting analog glitch work continuing on fiery thunderbolt. And we have some music here.
00:56:37.610 - 00:57:24.574, Speaker A: This is Max capacity with explainer gallery. So let's get another cool work from Max capacity. So pretty cool piece here by maxcapacity and explainer. So let us continue it on fiery Thunderbolt. And that is an edition of 25 for nineties zero 60. And this was also in Dina Chang's show that she did for object one curated show. Let's just get the, I thought, really original looking art here.
00:57:24.574 - 00:57:52.526, Speaker A: Mixing video and I guess digital animation, for lack of better term. Really nice contrast. These super strong, sharp red squares with a super fuzzy background. Really making again, the physical and the digital work well together again, which is not as easy as it sounds, I would argue. It's just beautiful to look at. Nice music too. So cool work here.
00:57:52.526 - 00:58:17.244, Speaker A: The artist is Mrkdrf, Mister Kadirf. Not sure electric whisper is, or image tension is the name of the work and electric whisper is the name of the show. Do check that out on object one. Koda Nakazono fjallment number eight. A really interesting piece here. Let me make it a little bit bigger. And a high res.
00:58:17.244 - 00:58:34.784, Speaker A: Just very cool, kind of animated abstract work from Koda Nakazono. Super interesting. Is this a gif? It is. Wow. That is a GiF filament number 825 tezos. And there's one left on secondary. And check this out.
00:58:34.784 - 00:59:02.606, Speaker A: Also, super high definition work here by Mika Oladev, Sky Goodman and drain. So look at this. So playing with the sneakers and the high heels and everything in this collaboration worked out really nicely. You can even see down there inside the shoe and underneath, really, really cool hybrid of the. This is something that I'm actually surprised hasn't happened yet. This is a brilliant fashion idea, I would argue. Maybe it's too.
00:59:02.606 - 00:59:23.286, Speaker A: Maybe just is too difficult to do in practice from a fashion perspective. But this idea of a sneaker that has a high heel, I'm sure it's been done, but I've never seen it. Brilliant. How much is this? Ten Tezos edition of 25. There are seven left. And zoom with a room here. This is an edition of one.
00:59:23.286 - 00:59:37.784, Speaker A: So continuing the post room series here. So this is number eight. I think this is going for 100. This is orange for 25 tezos to clown. Vamp. Nice purchase there. And post room number nine, this is for Tezos edition of ten.
00:59:37.784 - 00:59:57.744, Speaker A: So really nice kind of plants. Again, plants in the foreground, interiors and exteriors. And then the wall in between with a window. Beautiful colors, too. Here's another one that's really kind of yellow, kind of almost sunlit feeling. And you can even see the shadow of the plant. And almost like this porcelain vase.
00:59:57.744 - 01:00:21.704, Speaker A: This is 100 tezos. And this is a one of one by zoom. So really cool AI artwork from zoom. And then here is tuques with kind of a different work again, playing with tuks has gone a long way by trying out new things. And here we go again. Here are some interesting, beautiful flowers from tuques here. AI artwork from Tuks V two collection.
01:00:21.704 - 01:00:55.604, Speaker A: So this is 0.15. Reserve or buy now for 0.5 ETH. And that is on foundation. And what is Ayanna? With some cool experimentation here, which added little dark AI and digital painting, and always fun to check in with what is Ayanna? So, again, I believe AI artwork, and then you see a lot of magic wand here to get these great textures. What I would argue is the magic wand, and then paint over top and going with thinner brushstrokes on this one. So interesting.
01:00:55.604 - 01:01:34.418, Speaker A: Look at the, you know, Warhol loved the magic wand or the fill tool on those early works in that portrait of Warhol. Remember the digital portrait of Warhol? It's a bunch of fills. And why, and why does it work so well? Why would Warhol love it so much? You know, it's the same, like. And I love it so much. It's because you get randomness, and it's sort of like the equivalent of when Warhol would say, for example, get an assistant to just get the mop, or him using a mop to do the paint underneath a large screen print. Not even worrying about kind of where it's going to go, working with randomness. Because when.
01:01:34.418 - 01:02:13.084, Speaker A: The great thing about randomness is when it works, it looks brilliant. It's like, how could that person have thought of that? You know? Warhol was a master of using randomness, I would argue, which is, again, why so much the work looks so beautiful and poetic. But it was just him with a mop, let's say, or a paintbrush loosely, you know, even trying to paint bad sometimes. So which, by what is Ayanna edition of 15, nine left for six tezos and Kiro Mello, who I'd never seen before. Look at this beautiful print here, these kind of teddy, these animals, stuffed animals, really playing baseball here. I thought this was a beautiful print. Shipping worldwide.
01:02:13.084 - 01:02:28.436, Speaker A: €200. Artist proof. One of. So these are the artist proofs baseball game. So maybe out of, I'm guessing, Japan here as well. As I look at the script here, but I am not an expert in scripts. Here's another one.
01:02:28.436 - 01:02:47.136, Speaker A: Game of soccer. So I thought these are quite brilliant. And here you can see they have different work here, too. But these two prints really stood out really nice. Artist proof. One of one and one of two and two of two again, €200 each. Kuromello, Luciana Gueroque Guerroque, the beasts within.
01:02:47.136 - 01:03:16.294, Speaker A: So a cool, abstract work here. This is physical as well. So this is an open edition at three tezos each, seven minted. And, of course, here is Yoao Salazar in the studio, working hard, as we've been seeing here, working with both plasticine and paint in different works, getting still a consistent look and style. Just very cool. And, of course, here is tater tots, mood bath salts. Six of 15 editions available on tazos.
01:03:16.294 - 01:03:29.054, Speaker A: So this is on Tazos. And more beautiful physical artwork here from Tater Tots. And that is your show, my friends. I will try and speed up future episodes. This has gone a little long. Thank you for joining me. Until next time, take care.
