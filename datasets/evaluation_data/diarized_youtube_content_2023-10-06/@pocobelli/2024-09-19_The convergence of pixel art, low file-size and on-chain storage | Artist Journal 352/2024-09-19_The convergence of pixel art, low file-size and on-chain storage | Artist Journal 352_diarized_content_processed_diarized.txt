00:00:07.120 - 00:00:34.095, Speaker A: Defying all expectations, shouting into the void in the middle of nowhere. Crete, Greece. Welcome back Everybody. Artist Journal, September 18, 2024. Speaking as if it's my last day on earth, because that is what I need to do in order to shout out here and make some noise in this Airbnb. My name is Adrian Pocabelli. Welcome back.
00:00:34.095 - 00:01:04.441, Speaker A: So this is an experimental show. It's probably going to be remarkably similar to previous episodes, but I think it'll be shorter. The prep time was actually the real revolution. It didn't take very long to prep. Still struggling with object notifications. I keep getting the same 50 kind of rolled over and over and I can't even check beyond that, which is unfortunate. Luckily though, we got.
00:01:04.441 - 00:01:37.955, Speaker A: I managed to see this one look at what November 1914 did once again at the beginning of the newspaper. The imagination of 1914 out of Argentina. One of the many incredibly talented people out of Argentina. And as we see here, I mean, who's not familiar with the original, which I actually brought up here. No, 1914 doing. Doing an homage or a pastiche of Picasso and women running. Two women running on the beach.
00:01:37.955 - 00:02:14.541, Speaker A: The race, 1922, as you see here. What a beautiful, what a beautiful version that we have here with all of Novemb 1914's tropes. The frame, even almost the metallic colored frame. The stunning results here of these gradients. You know, I was reading an article, I think it was Katya Kazakina and she was interviewing a well known kind of collector or gallerist. And I think I bookmarked it. I almost should look and find it.
00:02:14.541 - 00:02:58.807, Speaker A: Maybe I'll find it for next show. What was so interesting about it was a lot of the things she loved were the things that we kind of discuss here with challenging artists. And I think she actually used it this like New York gallerist. The word challenging, how she loves challenging art. I think hilarious because it's a fun way, a kind of neutral way of describing art that's hard. And what do we mean by art that's hard? We mean art that's kind of like you're not sure if you like it or not at first and then you're kind of. But then you're brought in and as that person said, and I'll have to dig up that article, as that person said, you think to yourself, who would ever make something like this? And this is one of the great things of Nova 1914.
00:02:58.807 - 00:03:40.245, Speaker A: And one only need look at this. Is that a cloud in the air here? One need only look at These wild gradients in the background or even this entire work. If you look at even the frame, you know, all of most of us out here, I would argue would be trying to make this look like a real frame rather than just going with the gradient over top of one another. Even fixing. We'd be fixing things like this. Nev 19:14 with all of the experience she's gaining on a daily basis knows, I would argue to leave these errors, quote unquote, which for her probably aren't errors. And even this hand, not worrying about it.
00:03:40.245 - 00:03:55.785, Speaker A: Just glorious here. So a beautiful beginning here for the newspaper. The Imagination still available edition of 3. And look who bought 2. Yuri J. Seeing the value here, I don't know if I have 10 days. I mean, I probably.
00:03:55.785 - 00:04:08.305, Speaker A: I need to do this show and buy this piece. Actually. I kind of need this in my collection, in my. In the museum of my mind, as many of us have now. So. But. So we'll go through again.
00:04:08.305 - 00:04:23.993, Speaker A: We're trying to get through this quickly here. I'm trying to get to Malia. Let me show you. So here's the Picasso. Let me quickly show you. Crete map. This is the nice thing about doing a shorter show in theory is can actually go into other things.
00:04:23.993 - 00:04:35.099, Speaker A: So I'm over. Let's see. Let's see if we can see where I am. So here's Heracleon. You fly into. Here's Crete. Okay.
00:04:35.099 - 00:04:46.347, Speaker A: Here's Greece. Actually, that's Greece too. There's Rhodes, very close to Turkey, as you can see. And here's Heracleon. I am. There's Malia. I'm here in Stelita, a beach town.
00:04:46.347 - 00:05:16.833, Speaker A: I'm trying to get to Malia, to the Minoan palace here. Malia Palace ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE so I'm trying to move fast because of course we have a space with the myth in five hours and it's an hour and a half walk. I think I'm going to walk. You can take a bus, but sometimes the buses are sporadic or full. So it's an hour and a half walk. If I move quickly, basically, if I run through this show, maybe I can make to the Malia. Make it to the Malia archaeological palace.
00:05:16.833 - 00:05:33.411, Speaker A: That is the goal. Otherwise I'll go early in the morning. Tomorrow is probably what we'll do. So as I was saying, the myth, the man, the legend, the myth. Astonishingly, on our artist journal, live spaces. And look who's translating. Santiago.
00:05:33.411 - 00:05:57.645, Speaker A: And I'm sure Santiago will have a question or two of his own. Runetoon is co hosting it should be an incredible show in a very mysterious, enigmatic figure. A total original, a unique artist. Again, one of the great artists of Microsoft Paint. And actually I showed you. I want to show you examples. I'm lucky enough to own actually one of these.
00:05:57.645 - 00:06:17.459, Speaker A: This is Ralph Lauren Ralph Dreams. Again, you can see made on Microsoft paint. This is 100%. Just to give you guys a taste, here's some of the early work. I mean, this early one of an edgy piece, if I remember right. 1500 Tez. Yeah, it's an edgy piece.
00:06:17.459 - 00:06:28.091, Speaker A: This boxing ring. This was the genesis. This is Myth's first work. And there's the myth. I gotta love it. The lemon head there from the very beginning. This is a classic.
00:06:28.091 - 00:06:47.505, Speaker A: I wish I owned this one edition of 15. The man, the legend, the myth. And there's hand with a bunch of money again, out of Argentina. Buenos Aires. So far, two artists in this show from Buenos Aires without even trying. No fear. This is a beautiful piece here.
00:06:47.505 - 00:07:04.957, Speaker A: I do own this one. Just gorgeous. Look at the color there. Again, made with Microsoft paint. Stunning. Only 68 tezos for this August 12, 2021 hen work by the myth. So anyway, so that is coming up.
00:07:04.957 - 00:07:26.289, Speaker A: Very exciting for anybody that's been in the the Tezos ecosystem. They'll know what a huge show it is today. So check that out. Otherwise I'll have it. You can listen to the recording if you're away or you watch this later. So let's look at the comments on last show. Thank you everybody for the support credible physical objects.
00:07:26.289 - 00:08:01.965, Speaker A: Yolantis website mentor Adrian, thanks so much for highlighting the Colonna show, the Michele Kelowna show, or Kelowna Contemporary with photos and videos of Lily Illo's work. I went through it last week on their On Cyber Digital Twin Metaverse site, but couldn't zoom in very close to the artworks. Seeing the photos that show the shine of the texture on the physical piece was great. The framing of the works is very professional and subtle too. I completely agree. Lilly's a designer by trade, or at least so has. Or at least, let's put it this way, has a lot of experience designing.
00:08:01.965 - 00:08:16.575, Speaker A: And so it really shows in the care that is taken in the visual product. So yeah, it's. I completely agree with these comments here. Blue Sky, Ocean. So cool. Awesome to hear from you. Appreciate that.
00:08:16.575 - 00:08:23.999, Speaker A: Mama Deuce. Ow. Very dope selection as usual. Thank you. And 31 of M live. We're gonna go quick. Exactly.
00:08:23.999 - 00:08:38.221, Speaker A: I think that was an hour and 20 minutes. Hilariously. This one should be faster. Let's see. PP Universal. Very fast boy. And finally and a bit of a cringe from Von Gussie Anonymous account.
00:08:38.221 - 00:08:51.861, Speaker A: Throwing stones from glass houses over there. Let's continue. Choose on the Twitter. I'm a half hour from Wayne, Pennsylvania. So crazy. I'm going to try to see this show before I move. Awesome.
00:08:51.861 - 00:09:06.991, Speaker A: Fabin, always good to see you. Cheers. Sailor Marcos who actually have another work by them this episode. Always a pleasure to watch and now super happy to see my work on the Journal. Thank you and thrilled to discover your work. Sailor Mocos. Sailor Mocos.
00:09:06.991 - 00:09:38.025, Speaker A: Awesome. Michele Colonna of Colonna Contemporary. Adrian, are you running away from the law? Maybe it was the unshaven face and trying to go fast and keeping my voice low. Maybe it seems that way. I realize though I do need bigger Airbnbs because even now I hear people going through and I just think to myself it makes you more self conscious, let's put it that way, when you have people right around you when you're doing something like this. Little Cakes and Fear for Tez was for Friday the 13th. Thanks for sharing my piece.
00:09:38.025 - 00:09:48.993, Speaker A: Thanks for telling me. I should really know that by now. So every Friday the 13th is fear for Tez. That completely explains it. Brain dead. Great selection as always. Thank you, appreciate it.
00:09:48.993 - 00:10:11.125, Speaker A: And Little Cakes. It's a lab's comment. Getting clean, clear documentation from RGB Montreal and seeing the care with which they presented each work was refreshing and I'm grateful for it. It was totally refreshing and impressive. When you don't see such treatment, kind of leaves a bad taste in your mouth even if happy for an opportunity. Completely agree. As I said here, it almost sets a new benchmark.
00:10:11.125 - 00:10:32.477, Speaker A: And Aitso replying, I truly hope so. It does set a benchmark. It'll be standard practice for future RGB MTL events. Either way though. Awesome. Exactly. It's kind of like, you know, to a certain degree this show and to a certain degree this scene, it's just at a certain point it's sort of like you can wait for somebody else to do it or you can just do it yourself.
00:10:32.477 - 00:11:04.115, Speaker A: And that's what they're doing. And in the land of the Internet, in the era of the Internet, that's not a terrible outcome. Like it's not a bad way of operating, kind of a fun way of operating. And look at how much success they had by doing it themselves. So you know, like, I mean it was like it really. I think it got a lot of attention. Henry Delbras actually busy doing the same right now too many physical objects are just an afterthought and don't get the attention they deserve.
00:11:04.115 - 00:11:42.769, Speaker A: Indeed. Especially with physical, sorry, digital going to physical and it's really worth putting in that extra effort and conceiving them as physical artworks and and what that all means rather than simply printing it out on a piece of paper and saying there's your physical, really taking the care how are you printing it on what you know, why. And all these things really adds to the work itself and to the credibility, I would argue. Quampa Poco. Awesome to hear from you Quampa Such a great artist. It's just rad hearing from you Qampa. Big shout out Trippy Collector.
00:11:42.769 - 00:11:56.145, Speaker A: Let's go. Lily Illo kicking us off on Monday feels exactly what we need. Awesome. Thank you Trippy and Son of Steg. I'm certain Lily uses the early 1.5 models of stable Diffusion. Looking forward to hearing the rest as usual.
00:11:56.145 - 00:12:14.739, Speaker A: Very interesting. Son of Stag. Yeah, that sounds right. She was mentioning in the spaces exactly what she uses. So if you want to confirm you could go to that space and you'll hear Lily Ilo awesome. So much gratitude for you Poco. This is very awesome to see you opening the show with my work today.
00:12:14.739 - 00:12:44.397, Speaker A: The generosity of Michele Colonna, Trippy Collector and Mikey Wilson throughout this show, posting and documenting the works in this space, championing the works. I'm utterly blown away. Thank you for this little correction in details. I do not use Mid Journey. I love Mid Journey outputs, but for me I think the mid and Mid Journey I think I put the mid in midjourney and prefer stable diffusion version 1.5. So son of Stag on the mark. So work with that and Dall E mostly as well as some other AI tools.
00:12:44.397 - 00:13:11.021, Speaker A: And Lily was saying how she has like a few credits left in the earlier version of Dall? E. Interestingly that she's using just super with a lot of discretion because you can add credits. That space we did with her was awesome. So thanks for the correction. So no Mid Journey. The works are indeed sold at 0.4 ETH or fiat equivalent through Kelowna Contemporary Digital and physical coupled together linked with trace chip from Transient Labs.
00:13:11.021 - 00:13:37.183, Speaker A: I mean, how impressive it is. Also interesting the works sold in the gallery Fiat sales are hard to record on chain, so they get delisted in the Foundation Digital NFT and they disappear from the show on foundation. There must be some fix for it, but it does not seem possible yet. The works are flatbed printed on birchwood here in Melbourne Australia for my work. Woodgrain seemed the perfect surface. Okay, well I'm just grateful. Big smile on my face and beaming heart.
00:13:37.183 - 00:14:07.111, Speaker A: Sending much, much thanks. Well, awesome thank you for all of the information and details on that, Lillian. Just rad to hear from you again. And here's Michele. That's correct, Adrian. Each NFT comes with a physical 16 and a half by 23 and a half single edition print on birchwood board framed and signed with Transient Labs trace chip digital authentication. I mean how professional you get some adults who have a little bit of time to do this and dedication.
00:14:07.111 - 00:14:25.803, Speaker A: I mean you get like this is like professional as if you hired a professional organization to do this for you. And you know, it's just really impressive. It just feels very pro. An amazing value at 0.4 eth. Indeed. I mean that's only like 1100 bucks I think.
00:14:25.803 - 00:14:50.355, Speaker A: And you get a physical and you get a Lily Illo one of one on Eth. Kel's awesome to hear from you and Rafa, congrats. Lily Illo and Michele Colonna well deserved coverage of the show and art. So awesome to hear from everybody And Libro Block as we open the community here. A couple of works here on Tea. Interesting. There's even a little bit of audio.
00:14:50.355 - 00:15:05.807, Speaker A: Cool work. So animated, abstract. A little bit of a kind of lounge chill vibe there. Morgan Higbee Flowers with a video I did. Look at that. Morgan. I'm not going to bring it up here.
00:15:05.807 - 00:15:27.779, Speaker A: If you can get a video though posted to the like as or at least an excerpt we can bring it in. I can show it on the show. Ilia Beribin hello everyone. This is Poetry, my new drop on object. I would be glad if you pay attention and support so Ilya Barabin with a cool looks like a physical here of a dog. Red dog Very cool. Luke500 I could listen and watch to this all day long.
00:15:27.779 - 00:15:44.375, Speaker A: Dr. Bill Kolomichek collab with yes VAMI 100% code art. Very cool. And of course we did work with Dr. Bill a live show with Dr. Bill a few weeks ago. About a month ago.
00:15:44.375 - 00:16:16.465, Speaker A: Of course Dr. Bill being a early generative artist, early kind of digital artist you could say. And there is Kurt Hustle collective on the scene here. Just rad love these guys and awesome music is ever. Just love the vibe from those guys and always hilarious and beautiful. 369 disguiser. Thank you everybody for posting here.
00:16:16.465 - 00:16:35.697, Speaker A: Quite a few works here. Valley Pokan thank you for posting. This is awesome. Ernesto Ash thank you and just Very cool abstract work here. And Austin, a cool pixel artwork. IPhone drawing posted to X seen by enthusiast. And enthusiast reaches out and asks to acquire a one of one makes offer.
00:16:35.697 - 00:16:47.639, Speaker A: Offer accepted. Minted on Tezos. Happy collector, happy artist. Isn't that just so true? How cool is that? Awesome to hear from you, Austin. And Mr. Rero Generative piece We saw this. Okay, we're good.
00:16:47.639 - 00:17:26.645, Speaker A: Wow. A lot of works posted in the last day. So we've been talking about compression, compressionist art. This idea of trying to make works as small as possible. And of course, you know what's funny about this and how it's got this name now. Compressionist Keith Haring Forgery by Sabato it's kind of like, I would argue this is a fantasy, at least I've had in the back of my head for a long time, which is, what if you made very small versions of all your artwork and put it on somewhere like bitcoin, right? Or put it on the blockchain or. But again, something on chain.
00:17:26.645 - 00:18:09.771, Speaker A: And as I was mentioning last episode, we do seem to be getting a convergence of sorts between pixel art, what I'd loosely call compressionism, you know, going for small file size and the on chain thing, the on putting on chain art that doesn't require a cloud. They're all kind of. Weirdly, I'd say they have kind of a shared purpose, right? Which is small file size, you know, pixel art, small file size. Like they all have this kind of. They kind of need one another in order to get to that goal of a small file size. On chain, which needs small file size. Pixel art, you know, often small file size here, Sabato.
00:18:09.771 - 00:19:03.599, Speaker A: Reducing the color in this Keith Haring work. And it's very fun and I'm getting very tempted to do the same thing again, the idea has been in my mind for, I would argue, a very long time, this idea of doing the remixes, because you can't put a five megabyte file, for example, on bitcoin, but you can do very, you know, interesting variations of it. For example, if bitcoin is what you want to put on and you can. So it kind of opens up this whole other kind of world, because all of a sudden, as I've mentioned here before, there's a million different variations you can make of all your works. And then what's interesting about this is the need for a small file size gives it a kind of purpose to making that. Because in a sense, otherwise you go, well, why this then that? And you could just make a million different works of each piece. And I'm not against that.
00:19:03.599 - 00:19:30.437, Speaker A: You know, here we'll put a red background here, we'll put a yellow background here. I'm not against that. I'm actually kind of for it. It's like, I think Warhol actually set a precedent in that respect. But nevertheless, we almost have what's kind of beautiful about this compressionist thing. And again, I do have ambivalency towards a term like this. But, you know, and it's something we're already doing before this word happened.
00:19:30.437 - 00:19:47.757, Speaker A: But it is kind of catchy. Is this need. It's kind of. It justifies itself, we might say, with the low. By needing a low file size to get on chain. And often the route towards this low file size is towards pixelation. Or you take a pixel artwork.
00:19:47.757 - 00:20:08.225, Speaker A: You could argue this deluxe paint work is a pixel artwork. You could argue, although it's debatable. But you see, you know, done at a low resolution file size and then just say removing the color here and all of a sudden now it's only 96 kilobytes. Right. So very interesting. Of course, I follow Sabato. That is a glitch on X.
00:20:08.225 - 00:20:34.335, Speaker A: Another comment here. Dreaming Tulpa kind of feels like the AI art scene on X has died out. Where's everyone? I not what I've seen. I still see, like, really, like, I mean, strange things. New works with the. What looked like again, Michelangelo's dying slave being combined with sports figures. Those are like.
00:20:34.335 - 00:21:06.885, Speaker A: I mean, to me, that was a massive breakthrough that was done there. What we're seeing with Toques continues to be interesting. Look, we just started with Lily Illogical. And you could say, oh, well, that's AI. You could say, that is okay, that's physical, but it is AI art put on physical, right? So I guess it depends where you're looking. Perhaps as a trend, maybe it is dying, but as a specific. But it's specific examples.
00:21:06.885 - 00:21:33.137, Speaker A: You know, I think you can just look at this show here. Now, this is a two minute video. This was awesome. Michele Colonna put it together and it basically explains the entire show. And basically what Lily just explained there, which is if you buy the nft, you also get the physical and just all the details about it. So it goes for two minutes. And so check that out.
00:21:33.137 - 00:21:53.503, Speaker A: I retweeted it. It's in my feed. It's also on Michele Colonis. And this looks like a print, right? And this was actually. This is available as an edition on foundation, interestingly. So how cool is that? I would Love to see this print too, in person, all of it. And here again, excellent documentation.
00:21:53.503 - 00:22:29.445, Speaker A: Signed over here, shipped from Australia. There is the Transient Labs, you know, authentication. Very cool. My only concern would be with this kind of authentication is what happens when, you know, what if Transient Labs disappears? You know, where is this going to work in 100 years? Is my question. And so that would be my only kind of open question on that. But yeah, again, these stunning works and just beautiful photography by the way, of the works, like especially there. I mean, a perfect shot for documentation.
00:22:29.445 - 00:22:55.335, Speaker A: This was also interesting because it gets the. It gets the reflection in the wood. I mean, so again, you see the saturation there. Just stunning. Henry Dobrez preparing a long post to explain it all. But we have spent months with Matter Lab trying to figure out how the best way to respect the work and avoids feeling like a simple varnish. So here, back to digital being made into physicals and back to Art Matter.
00:22:55.335 - 00:23:37.395, Speaker A: Here we see some experimentation going on and so it continues with Art Matter. And thank you for posting that. Henry Dobrez Looks very cool and super interesting. Again, so all sorts of interesting innovation here going on with digital artists making their work physical, which I'd argue again is like when you look at digital art from again, what I'd call the first generation from the 70s to even just to pre. NFTs or up to Tumblr, most of that. Or even late 90s maybe net art where they started making websites. I mean, but up until that point it was kind of all about making it physical.
00:23:37.395 - 00:23:53.079, Speaker A: Right? So it's an interesting just. It's just super interesting to see this continue and evolve. Right. This is August ground. I thought this was actually pretty hilarious. From a recent show of mine. Mixed Media Tongues and Pipes.
00:23:53.079 - 00:24:24.517, Speaker A: Affluent and Language. So a cool kind of surrealist pipe is what I would say. And by the way, there's the one of one we're talking to Surrealist Manifesto today with Santiago will be there, Tim from one of one, Marcel and Runetoon. So by the way, but looks. So I just read the Surrealist Manifesto again and so when I see these tongues coming out of the pipes, it's. There's a hilarious irrational logic we might say to it. Mech.
00:24:24.517 - 00:24:41.365, Speaker A: Txt. Look how great this looks. You know, speaking of this was at RGB Montreal. Look at that. When you have those two colors and even just how this is being displayed right here. Pretty cool, isn't it? So very nice. More examples of RGB Montreal.
00:24:41.365 - 00:25:15.415, Speaker A: Eli Scheinman. No one will believe this has artistic merit. If we keep displaying the work like this, because this is again, this is what you're seeing is, you know, a horizontal work put on a vertical tv. And of course it doesn't look very flattering, does it? So just to send home the point, this is super interesting what dancontrol is doing as usual. Cigarette almost. So here's the gradient tool, what looks like in Photoshop, but making a cigarette out of it. This is interesting.
00:25:15.415 - 00:25:36.315, Speaker A: This is super interesting. I think this is going to go on Zora, if I'm not mistaken. We'll see if there are any others. There's just that one. But again, Dan control with a super minimal conceptual, you know, approach. Very cool and persuasive and just stylish. So very cool.
00:25:36.315 - 00:25:50.785, Speaker A: Yuri J. Washing machine. This went to Sunday Funday for 333 TEZ. And that was just listed. So washing machine. And so another washing machine. I think the other was it a stove.
00:25:50.785 - 00:26:17.501, Speaker A: And here we see a washing machine and classic repetition of elements here or of shapes in some areas and all of these great textures. And then inside the washing machine you get a much more noisy image here. Very cool. Just again, tons of texture, tons of fun. Totally unique, totally Yuri J. 333 Tez. Nice work.
00:26:17.501 - 00:26:38.435, Speaker A: And another portrait of the bathroom here. Beautiful textures here. So seemingly on fire. Yuri J. It's getting pretty impressive and a lot of them are coming out and they're looking pretty great. Even just that color, the orange there. Powerful.
00:26:38.435 - 00:27:06.575, Speaker A: Here's Gozo offering digital collage by Gozo. I believe there's a little bit of AI in here, if I remember right. So I think stable diffusion and digital collage. I think cool abstract here. 30 tez edition of 20 and that's on secondary. Selling out at 15 on primary. Here is Reny Fish Cool green work, kind of unusual lucid dream.
00:27:06.575 - 00:27:32.177, Speaker A: Great title. Let's see. Kind of a fun chill work from Reny fish. Beautiful. That is an addition of 10. Has that gone for sale yet? It has and selling out at 11 tazos. Great work and looking like it sold out in just a few hours there.
00:27:32.177 - 00:27:44.241, Speaker A: Three hours. Impressive. One Don't Knows. Untitled Composition and Color Study 2024. So haven't seen a ton from One Don't Knows in the last couple of years. Just here and there. Kind of more selective.
00:27:44.241 - 00:28:06.685, Speaker A: Did very well in 2020 2021. So it's just interesting. So here on Instagram, just very cool collage here from one don't knows. Cool person, I think out of Indonesia. If I'm not Mistaken. PP Universal. Rad collage here.
00:28:06.685 - 00:28:27.265, Speaker A: Kind of a conflation of elements. Here you see the hammer and sickle of communism being filled with corporate iconography. The old Apple logo, Macintosh, McDonald's. Very cool. Very interesting and stylish works here. Looks like it's sold out. Great work.
00:28:27.265 - 00:28:50.229, Speaker A: PP Universal. Here's Lorna Mills doing the classic masking work using orange. And here is a pepperoni pizza coming in and out of focus here. Or I guess the mask or just, you know, different layers showing up of the pieces of pizza. Great piece and fun piece from Lorna Mills. Siller Mocos. Another interesting gradient.
00:28:50.229 - 00:29:12.870, Speaker A: Almost looking like a cartoon here, but done with gradients. Just kind of mysterious and wild work here. Cherries, what looks like almost a Casper the ghost or a baby figure here. Totally mysterious, Very cool. Here is L'Inquisitor on the fake whale Gallery Art market. La Cour des Miracles, where only souls matter. 4,000 by 3,000.
00:29:12.870 - 00:29:32.001, Speaker A: Burnsey witch. And that is five tazos edition of 13. So interesting kind of digital painting here. Lots of texture in the background. Interesting narrative work here. And strange with the toilet plungers. Again, that bathroom theme reappearing.
00:29:32.001 - 00:29:59.255, Speaker A: Here's the Myth with a new work, Swarm of Souls. And we see all of these myth masks here. Yellow mass and a few of these figures. I almost have to ask Myth about this yellow, red and black figures, which we're seeing a lot in the last few works here. And then lots of faces here at the bottom. Interesting piece by the Myth edition of 10 for 12. Tez and 6 are gone.
00:29:59.255 - 00:30:28.763, Speaker A: And continuing on. Gloomtube. Shortness of breath. So interesting. Always almost like a satire or criticism of contemporary culture. Here is a kind of classic, popular, let's say, winter jacket or autumn jacket with all of these labels on it and kind of wrapped in barbed wire. You see the consumerism sale and all of these little tags on it telling you to buy.
00:30:28.763 - 00:30:49.319, Speaker A: Interesting piece. Shortness of breath. Interesting title. Edition of 10, 555 and 5 gone and 5 transferred and also worldwide. This is GloomTube. And this is an edition of one selling for 75 Tezos and kind of classic. Working again with the garbage bag theme.
00:30:49.319 - 00:31:15.309, Speaker A: And here, out in the rain. Garbage bags. So again, very unglamorous sort of imagery, kind of satire of contemporary culture. Again, really the antithesis of romanticism, we might say, which would be focused on the beauty of nature and beautiful flower. This is a gray, dark, stormy day of garbage bags. Hilarious. Brilliant.
00:31:15.309 - 00:31:39.435, Speaker A: Worldwide Highway 2, hehe Jake Studios. This is an edition of one and this sold for 50 TEZ at auction. And here you see another kind of stream of consciousness illustration by Jake Studios. And here you see more really cool trademark. Upside down pixelated clouds. Cool animations. Just kind of a jittery illustration.
00:31:39.435 - 00:32:03.165, Speaker A: Cool mouse cursor there and what looks like kind of a police car. Interesting piece. Jake Studios edition of one. Here is Katarina Create for people of Tezos. So there is Katarina Create. How cool is that? So self portrait of Catarina here. And you see all of the outgrowths of her imagination here.
00:32:03.165 - 00:32:21.389, Speaker A: The moon, the mushrooms, the flowers and everything. Very cool. Portrait. Self portrait from Catarina create now at 30 tazos at auction. Still at auction as bidding is continuing. Here is Pamela Cirone with a very cool work. Almost looking like a meteor from the sky.
00:32:21.389 - 00:32:54.265, Speaker A: Look at the sky. Look at the wonderful different little flecks of mark making and the texture and this landscape and what looks like maybe a dog and a child and everything. All the energy of Pamela Cirone, who of course I follow out of Buenos Aires or Argentina. Bedala Classic Autumn with a new work here and using a lot of collage traditionally. I wonder if there's collage in here. It kind of looks like there could be. Let's see what Badala says.
00:32:54.265 - 00:33:03.605, Speaker A: Autumn is coming, isn't it? Not sure. Blue illustration. Maybe just an illustration. Nice piece. Edition of 15. Only two tezos. Super reasonable.
00:33:03.605 - 00:33:22.859, Speaker A: Here is Evelyn O with another really interesting abstract. As you can see here. Experimenting some more. Very cool work. I hope these are being minted. That was posted on X. And this must be Santiago because it is a massive file.
00:33:22.859 - 00:33:41.257, Speaker A: Modern history of car parts Art. Just a RAD title. 9-18-2024. And of course Santiago will be doing the translations awesomely today. And as you see here, incorporating some AI elements into the abstraction and collage. So kind of a whole mix. Look at this epicness.
00:33:41.257 - 00:34:05.413, Speaker A: A whole mix of different processes, techniques, technological Wonder. Collage of AI outputs. Edition of 20 for 7 tazos. Here's the Struble Waffle. A couple of new ones on Rodeo and so I actually forgot to mint the other ones. It's a lot, just kind of keeping up with everything. I showed it on the show, the last ones, but forgot to mint it.
00:34:05.413 - 00:34:18.075, Speaker A: Hilariously. I need to do these here. Anyways, cool work. What is the title? Glory. So interesting, kind of enigmatic. And new works here. Nice textures and everything.
00:34:18.075 - 00:34:37.999, Speaker A: When you are a Martian church. Another one, 61 minted here and let's just load it up. So interesting color in this one and lots of eyes and everything. So just having fun. All looks good over here. Just fun and cool. Here's RJ with another figurative work.
00:34:37.999 - 00:34:56.555, Speaker A: Pretty cool. This looks like a nude, maybe male nude perhaps. And interesting. Let's see if we can get some more texture or details on this. They look like AI is being involved here, getting wonderful texture. Once again we're kind of back to texture. Like looking pretty good.
00:34:56.555 - 00:35:17.285, Speaker A: Interesting size. Like they're not huge. They're big, but they're not huge. Like maybe we have. We don't have the pixels size but again and they're kind of rough like when you go up close. And I think that's pretty cool. Like again, like there's something very unique about these works here.
00:35:17.285 - 00:35:36.353, Speaker A: But there you see the square. So something's going on here in these hard edges. Very cool process at work. Here's Stippin Pixel on Zora animation train moment of ant plaza. So of course stiffen pixel. Being a great pixel artist has put a lot of work on Tezos in the past. Here's one on Zora.
00:35:36.353 - 00:35:54.025, Speaker A: A bit more animation in this one and kind of loading up better now. It takes a minute to load up here. It's a little out of focus, but it did load up at the end. There you go. And there you can see the whole work. It's almost like these, I think foundation as well. It keeps streaming.
00:35:54.025 - 00:36:06.549, Speaker A: So it starts from zero every time anyway. Only four minted there. Nicholas Sassoon. So you might get a low edition if you're lucky. Nicholas Sassoon. Good morning. Beautiful here.
00:36:06.549 - 00:36:31.643, Speaker A: Shimmering work landscape. Here's cream Safa pattern cycling. So an abstract here in black and white probably Again, probably a pretty small file one would imagine. Cool kind of cycling gradients. Here is Kristen Roos double ziggurat. Interesting reference to ancient Samaria, I assume. Interesting.
00:36:31.643 - 00:36:46.835, Speaker A: Or maybe Turkey. The ziggurats, you know, Middle Eastern kind of archaeological structures. Nice piece. Nice subject matter. Cool title. And that's an edition of 70. That was for gift day.
00:36:46.835 - 00:37:04.905, Speaker A: I don't think we've shown that yet. And that sold for only 575. What a steal. Here's Hermipe pixel art. This artist is awesome. And what's also interesting about this artist is they get corporate. It's really interesting.
00:37:04.905 - 00:37:19.245, Speaker A: Like look at this piece here. I think it's made on their phone, if I'm not mistaken. And interesting. This is another one I wanted to show. This is for Starbucks, I believe. Let's see what it says. I got to illustrate a Starbucks chilled cup pumpkin spice latte.
00:37:19.245 - 00:37:46.479, Speaker A: So pretty Interesting. I wonder if Starbucks found Hermipe on Instagram like it is. People do get found on Instagram, you know, 321. You get one, you know, post that really does well, but you see it's not huge amount of likes. So pretty interesting. Cool artist. And again doing work.
00:37:46.479 - 00:38:09.847, Speaker A: They had another one. This is for Shiseido, which I think is makeup. So very interesting. What's going on with this Pixel artist? This is pretty cool. Green ginger. Let's give you a taste. There is no way home, but at least I will rest among the stars.
00:38:09.847 - 00:38:32.435, Speaker A: So really cool work, isn't it? By Greenger, the last survivor. 650 on primary. Nice collaboration. And yes, I think two people. It is a duo music made by Greenger using Beatbox. So they also made the music. Here is brain dead with a work in progress.
00:38:32.435 - 00:38:56.475, Speaker A: I don't think this is quite finished yet. So another one of these almost pixel art machines. And there you see hand moving on its own and all sorts of stuff. Surveillance cameras and everything. Candles, machines, spider, eyeball, everything. Here's Popple. Red, green and blue is in the colors.
00:38:56.475 - 00:39:22.105, Speaker A: Circles here and then here. Just another work. I haven't seen a ton minted from Popple recently. I wonder if it's coming. You can almost see the influence of one bit Necromancer, a little bit in this work. I would argue just an awesome, awesome artist kind of horror pixel art kind of vibe to it with that almost that Jason mask. Here's Sabato Zhen Dao Chrome period drawing number 20.
00:39:22.105 - 00:39:42.271, Speaker A: Not sure if this has been minted yet. Really cool piece. I love the kind of the black. Getting the black material there really beautifully with the cycling gradient. And then in the background just static, static pixels on top. Cool. Very cool work.
00:39:42.271 - 00:40:04.069, Speaker A: Semha, a series of grieving, denial. Kind of a cool psychological work here with a little figure being overwhelmed by what looks like a wave in the water. And denial of grieving perhaps. Here's Francoise Gamma. Super cool is actually. Sorry, that's a comment with a work. I'm not sure if it's.
00:40:04.069 - 00:40:25.261, Speaker A: There's no sound here, so just an eye and here it is blinking. Interesting piece there. Acid Boy. Self collapse. Cool. Kind of twisting and turning psychedelic or generative code based art piece. Always kind of trippy there from Acid Boy.
00:40:25.261 - 00:40:45.165, Speaker A: Very cool. Here's Lucas Lejeune gm. And again, kind of overwhelmingly flashing and trippy kind of vector based work. Also one imagines programming this came up earlier. Maybe it's using a certain kind of software. So cool work there that could show. I feel like those words could show in the same show.
00:40:45.165 - 00:41:07.385, Speaker A: Marietta. This is quite cool. Rescue coffee tables are on object.com so this is kind of like the genesis of a glb. It seems to me here you see all of these different kind of variations. The illustration first, then it's colored and then it ends up into this very interestingly. So super cool.
00:41:07.385 - 00:41:22.365, Speaker A: Possible objects are back. That's on object. So. And how much did that sell for? 5 tezos each. Parsa most of touch Starved Pear. Cool. I guess this is a CGI artwork.
00:41:22.365 - 00:41:40.449, Speaker A: There it is, huge file. 8100 by 6500. And here you see it again. And there is even the work in progress or the sketch beforehand. Very cool work here. So CGI Parsa. Most of here's ex mortal.
00:41:40.449 - 00:42:03.282, Speaker A: Uncharted Cool landscape here. I think I just love the side of this thing here. The left hand side is pretty rad, especially these long horizontal gradients. Another kind of cool glitch which you don't see very often here. Doing another landscape. Uncharted. Cool title edition of 13 now 1880 on secondary.
00:42:03.282 - 00:42:25.969, Speaker A: So selling out at 888. And check this out. Summer Ghost AI times hardware analog glitch. So incorporating AI in here. Very interestingly again, exporting through different processes will be very interesting to see what happens here. Should that be pursued and followed. Hesia Un Liberar Cultura.
00:42:25.969 - 00:42:50.665, Speaker A: This is Canexapita. And here we just kind of an interesting piece here. Of course, Kanek Zapata I believe, coming out of Glitch. Doing a lot of AI work and not exactly sure what's going on here, but it's pretty interesting. It's a GIF 1100 by 2200. Pretty large for a GIF. And just interesting use of text here.
00:42:50.665 - 00:43:09.302, Speaker A: I don't know if it's AI. I don't think so. These poems are the result of a Murkoff chain generated through Python. So maybe some programming. Here's Santiago again with another AI artwork. This is my work in progress now. I guess this could have been earlier or I could have put the earlier one later Just with RJ's.
00:43:09.302 - 00:43:26.757, Speaker A: Just like with RJ's work where I'm getting confused between because it looks like AI is being incorporated. It's like. Do you put it in the AI section? Do you put it in the paint painting section? Anyway, beautiful work here. Again, love these margins. The bottom margin here. This negative space is awesome. And the work itself very complex and beautiful.
00:43:26.757 - 00:43:55.123, Speaker A: Here's Toques with a very interesting piece Decision and destiny. Very nice. Kind of spaced out work. And here's another one by Touques, A landscape kind of more minimal. And here's Skomra with what looks like a Mario Super Mario figure, but really hard to tell. And again, you get these stable diffusion textural inverter textures here. Super interesting as we move into physical Mark Tennant art.
00:43:55.123 - 00:44:13.465, Speaker A: Kind of looks like Kate Moss, doesn't it? Kind of a famous picture of Kate Moss rendered as a painting. I think pretty cool. Could be totally wrong about that. And look at this. We've seen this artist a million times. This one was awesome. Kind of looks like a trading card or a playing card.
00:44:13.465 - 00:44:27.633, Speaker A: Bob Bobachi Matija, the favorite customer. 70 by 50 acrylic on canvas. Beautiful. Again, the negative space is rad, edgy composition. Cool repetition. PB universal. With some interesting works here.
00:44:27.633 - 00:44:43.493, Speaker A: Looking very cool just with the painted areas and the pencil contrasting nicely. Cool photo. Nice documentation. And that is the show. I think I forgot to put the outro music. Thank you for joining me in this kind of sped up version. How are we doing here? 44 minutes.
00:44:43.493 - 00:44:51.125, Speaker A: We did it. Thank you for joining me. Hope to see you in the myth space and the one of one space on Surrealist Manifesto after. Until next time. Take care.
