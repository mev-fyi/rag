00:00:05.080 - 00:00:38.294, Speaker A: GMGM Artist Journal, August 27, 2022, Berlin. My first words in the morning, once again, that I vocalize are to you, dear listeners and watchers of this program. People have said some very nice things online, arguably too nice, but I'll take it. You know, the thought that went in my head was. And I couldn't find it. I looked for this. Rimbode.
00:00:38.294 - 00:01:17.400, Speaker A: It's my artist's journal. So I talk about Rimbode, and we will talk about a lot of literary things, actually, as we go on this journey together. Should I keep going? And I'm on episode nine here. There's a wedding I have to attend next weekend in Baden Baden. So, I mean, I'll probably not be broadcasting, as I said in a couple of. In an earlier episode. Like, there are going to be days that I miss here, but I feel this weird commitment to do this, like, religiously, practically, unless I can't, let's put it that way.
00:01:17.400 - 00:02:01.042, Speaker A: So anyways, some words, like I had read in a Rimbode poem, like, 15 years ago were going through my head, which was just like, give me the circus freaks, the mad men, the beggars, and, you know, like this sort of thing. And not to call everybody that. That is not my. But it's like, these are my people, artists. So it's. It means a lot to hear a positive response from artists. I looked for that poem for 20 minutes, actually, before I started this, because I really wanted to share that with you guys because it's some of my favorite lines.
00:02:01.042 - 00:02:21.524, Speaker A: I'm not even a huge rimbo guy. Like, there are. He was a poet who lived in France. I think he was considered an early symbolist, is what you'd call him. He was with Verlaine. He was, like, 21 when he died or something. And he wrote a whole bunch of famous poems which are kind of in the french literary canon.
00:02:21.524 - 00:02:43.864, Speaker A: And I think it's appropriate, actually, that we're bringing up Rimbaud because he's pretty dark. And I'm actually. I think he's a little overrated. But when he hits high, he hits very high. Jeux att in autre I is another, you know, some profound stuff. Also, you know where he's going through the elf del vowels of. I think it's a poem called vowels.
00:02:43.864 - 00:02:58.330, Speaker A: Let's just look quickly before we return to rat cloaksy here. The great rat cloaksy. I'll just show you an example. And actually, this is a whole. Okay, hold on. Vowels. I want to go into that.
00:02:58.330 - 00:03:16.540, Speaker A: Dejeuner, solebe. Two vowels. Rimbode, I believe that is the name. Here we go. This is a little long to read, but I'm gonna read the first line. A, black, you, white, I, red. Or.
00:03:16.540 - 00:03:33.812, Speaker A: Sorry, is that. That's e, a, black, e, white, I, red, u, green, o, blue vowels. I shall tell one day of your mysterious origins. So let's just leave it there. I'm not even. I not like. I laugh at kind of poetry readings for the most part.
00:03:33.812 - 00:04:02.298, Speaker A: But rimbode, we can sort of tip our hat to, because this is actually going to inform lot of things that we are getting into here in one way or another. So rat cloak, see, comes back to bring it back to the Tezos art scene. One of the top. We could call him a top three. And he is back from his vacation, which I hope was restful. Very nice guy. Another disturbing work.
00:04:02.298 - 00:04:44.142, Speaker A: Let's just expand that, you know, another headless work here. And so we're gonna talk a little bit about phone art today, because this is something that's close to my heart. I've been working on the phone since about 2016, maybe even, like, late November 2015. It was when the iPhone six s came out. And it's what I call the first art phone, because there were enough apps you could export, there was enough processing power where you could actually start to build works. And we'll probably take a look at one at the end I'm actually pretty proud of. Anyways, Rhett clokesy has been working with the phone, and he has a very, very nice approach.
00:04:44.142 - 00:05:19.204, Speaker A: I mean, he takes a painterly approach to, you can see in the brushwork over here, it looks like he's putting. This is classic, like, painterly kind of techniques where you basically. And I don't know if this is exactly what he's doing. Who knows what he's doing? But you basically put underpaintings, and you build a painting from the foundation up. So here he'll have, like, a lighter green that probably covers this entire area, or maybe this block here. Probably the entire area, though, of the bottom. And then he'll add, say, this darker green on top, and let the underneath green shine through a little bit.
00:05:19.204 - 00:05:39.110, Speaker A: And you see there's even a darker green. And this was maybe something that he put in before, but he's letting it shine through. This is kind of like, revealing your process. You'll see this in Picasso as well. And let me just plug in my computer here. Running low on battery. So very interesting.
00:05:39.110 - 00:06:20.150, Speaker A: You see it on the blue, too, where he's got a lighter blue. You see a darker blue, bleeding through. You can't tell if these are corrections or what he's doing, but kind of leaving your trail as to how you built a painting is a very modern approach. So this all feeds into my theory that ratcloaksee is a pretty, or I've heard other people mention this as well. So I'm not taking authority on this is my idea, but I think feeds into the view that rat cloak, see, knows what he's doing when it comes to painting. And I think we all knew that. But he is informed.
00:06:20.150 - 00:06:58.932, Speaker A: That's what it tells me. And that actually creates value in a lot of ways for what I'd call for those in the know that sort of understand the tradition and can recognize a good thing that creates value because it shows competence and knowledge of the tradition. And now he's playing off of it in a digital way. And there's also other stuff that's going on. So that's just the technical side that's kind of painterly. If we also look at it, you'll see. To me, these poses are very reminiscent of David Hockney's portrait series.
00:06:58.932 - 00:07:40.786, Speaker A: And I don't mention David Hockney because he also worked on the phone and iPad and was a pioneer of sorts before I ever did, actually. And you got to give credit to an older guy for understanding the potential of these technologies and just accepting it. Like, I've had people, when I came to Berlin, someone in a bar who was, like, some art person, saying, the phone is. That's not, you know, that's a toy. You know, like, people think like this. And so, yeah, so credit to David Hockney and also to Rhett Cloak, see here for, you know, and our generation. Or maybe some of you are a lot younger than me, but let's call it the NFT crowd.
00:07:40.786 - 00:08:16.874, Speaker A: Like, we don't need to be convinced that the phone or the iPad is a useful tool. But amazingly enough, you know, people like Hockney, back in 2007, eight nine, when the phone, when he started using the brushes app, which isn't even made anymore, that was seen as a pretty edgy thing to do. And again, applying kind of painterly techniques. Rat cloak, see, makes it his own. Now, you see this pose here is reminiscent of David Hockney's portrait series. And I think I brought this up. I did David Hockney portraits.
00:08:16.874 - 00:08:40.834, Speaker A: So you see these over here, these blue portraits, like the chair. I almost wonder if he's quoting these. I don't know if we see one with a white suit here, but it's tempting. Or maybe he changes the color. Maybe it has nothing to do. Like, maybe he's doing his own. But when I see all of these and we can go to some of his other works, this very disturbing dark works.
00:08:40.834 - 00:09:17.950, Speaker A: I mean, it's apropos to mention rimboat at the start of this episode, this kind of weird obsession with, you know, chopping heads off and, like, you have this cannibalism vibe in this first one. Here's another one. I mean, he's. People talk about, like, I once in a while see tweets on Twitter about, like, oh, I want some dark art. It's like, well, have you heard of this guy? Have you heard of rat cloak? See, because this is pretty dark art, in my opinion. So, you know, weird obsession with this headless business. And here, just another one.
00:09:17.950 - 00:09:43.834, Speaker A: So, you know, my favorite author is JG Ballard. And he always said, classic surrealist. We will go into Ballard in future episodes. That may be a little later here, but we can't say it all at the start here. But he said, follow your obsessions as an artist. And I think rat cloak, see, is definitely following his obsessions. I mean, pretty wild stuff here when you look at the iconography.
00:09:43.834 - 00:10:11.906, Speaker A: Pretty wild stuff. So, yeah, so he is back. I mean, and let's just look at the market on this, because I think it's worth, like. I mean, if you're looking for real art here on the cheap, this is a one of one. I mean, it sold for 41 tezos. Like, the reason I'm not here buying every one of these things is because I'm just actually trying not to hoard everything. Okay.
00:10:11.906 - 00:10:47.150, Speaker A: I already have three of these. I could have, you know, like, I sure have $60 for a one of one rack cloak seed. That'll probably 100 x at some point. I could be wrong. I mean, this could be worth less in two years. So it's not, you know, financial or collecting advice here, but I'm just saying, like, 41 tezos. I almost feel like maybe I shouldn't even be mentioning this stuff because maybe, like, I noticed Adelia's collection and gloom tube's collection just keep kind of getting more and more thin the floors there.
00:10:47.150 - 00:11:14.654, Speaker A: And I'm wondering if these videos are actually. People are acting a little bit on them because these floors are razor thin. I mean, you buy one work, and the price goes up 50 tesos. Like, that's how thin some of these floors are. Like, we could quickly look at a gloom tube here, and I'll just show you. Like, you don't need to. You can literally buy one work, you know, like, see, this guy got bought.
00:11:14.654 - 00:11:36.450, Speaker A: Now it's 50. Right there is 18. I paid 18. There's one listed for 20, and that's gone now. And now we're at 50. So I say, with some reluctance, these things, I almost think, like, I don't want to let the cat out of the bag too much here. But these artists also deserve what they're worth.
00:11:36.450 - 00:12:01.824, Speaker A: And if that means things get a little more expensive, well, you know, we all know who rat cloak see is the community. We do, right? So, you know, so save your money and start buying is my. It's not financial. That's my opinion. Okay? That's what I say to myself. And I don't think it's fair for me to. And I don't have endless funds either, as I've mentioned many times here.
00:12:01.824 - 00:12:41.444, Speaker A: I don't think it's fair for me to just try and get them all. And, you know, that's not cool either. So let other people get their pieces here and get their one of one rat cloaksies. I don't need, like, seven rat cloaks you want. I'll happily take them, but let's spread the love. And it could hurt the market if one person starts owning everything, okay? And that's not good for anybody, collector or artist. So just on rat cloaks, if you've never seen his work, he basically has two series that I can tell this finger art gallery, he calls it finger art, what I call phone art, or what I used to call mobile art, but it never took on, never.
00:12:41.444 - 00:13:30.252, Speaker A: Because I think that the key sort of essential characteristic for me of phone art or whatever is the fact that it's mobile. It's actually, I put the iPad in the same category because it's sort of working with these apps. You can export and move things back and forth between apps if you want, and you can be on the move. And to me, this is like the equivalent of the impressionists with their. All of a sudden, they had tubes of paint, because the industrial revolution and everything and technological progress, they could go out to the countryside and start to paint. So all sudden, you get van Gogh or Monet putting their little portable stuff, and they are painting. I think that's the same revolution.
00:13:30.252 - 00:14:01.768, Speaker A: So I still, you know, in my heart of hearts, I call it mobile art, even though this is not taken on at all, despite my, you know, hundred views of my essay, you know. So he calls it finger art. And fair enough. I mean, again, who's to say? And everybody has their view and look at how good he is at this. So, you know, I was lucky to win this lottery here for this guy. Yeah. So, I mean, I don't need to own everything.
00:14:01.768 - 00:14:32.878, Speaker A: Look at this. A little non finito in here. I wonder if he's working with many layers. Obviously, he's working with many layers. And again, we saw this in sum, Ryusi's work, where I suspected maybe layers are getting turned off. And so you get this kind of non finito, and we'll go into the non finito, I promise, in a future lecture. A fascinating history that dates back to Michelangelo, and Warhol, of course, was the master of the non finito, the unfinished work, which actually makes it look more poetic.
00:14:32.878 - 00:14:47.270, Speaker A: More poetry. Sorry. Instant poetry. We will get into all that, but for now, we just see it here. Looks like some layers are being turned off again. I think I own this one, too. Exactly.
00:14:47.270 - 00:15:17.286, Speaker A: So I'm kind of like, unless I see something, I must have. I am kind of letting everybody else get their take, because I like this community that much. And. Yeah, so a couple other things. So I want to go to some of his old work, because it's absolutely spectacular. And this episode is starting to go along. This was the work that I actually.
00:15:17.286 - 00:15:55.634, Speaker A: How I discovered him. I just saw this on Twitter, and I just thought to myself, this is, like, insane. This guy in a straitjacket. Again, we get this Hannibal Lecter mask with his kind of rat cloaksy, sort of black star on the eye look. You get this wild, almost like Jupiter, with, I don't know, a couple of supplicants. Is that what you'd call it? I don't know. So, anyways, and then this wild, you know, this polo hat with the, you know, modern machine guns, the north face.
00:15:55.634 - 00:16:20.774, Speaker A: It's kind of terrifying, actually, his work is quite terrifying. So all you people on Twitter that are looking for dark art, I mean, you might get more than you bargained for with Ratcloaksee, because it's. It's bordering on. And I like dark, you know, but it borders on almost too dark at times. I also want to. This was a one of one I got. People have pointed this out on Twitter.
00:16:20.774 - 00:16:56.162, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, there's a whole story. I mean, I kind of already told it quickly, but, yeah, I just happened to be on when this thing got minted. This was during the one of one kind of festival that was, like, three months ago or whatever, what was July 4. And I just happened to see it, and I just thought it was 500 tezos, which is about $750 and I thought about it for about two minutes, and I just thought, you know what? Like, just go for it. I had just discovered his work, and I was like, oh, my God. Like, now I have the opportunity for a one of one. So, you see, like, it was listed at 1249.
00:16:56.162 - 00:17:20.896, Speaker A: Yeah, I took about two minutes, and I was just like, just go for it. And, yeah, I'm glad I did. I mean, I call this almost a museum maker. And let's look at his work really close, because it actually stands up, but it's worth the look. Look at this. I think this is made in Microsoft paint, but you see the beauty. And again, like, it's got, like, this.
00:17:20.896 - 00:17:46.532, Speaker A: I don't know if we can even. You know, it's got this square pixel, you see, like, the roughness. And that's the great thing. I mean, my dad always said, like, when you go to the Vatican, he grew up in Rome, my dad, and he moved to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. He was a physicist. Gustavo Pocabelli. And he always said, you know, and he used to spend a lot of time at the Vatican when he was a kid.
00:17:46.532 - 00:18:14.804, Speaker A: He was what he called a Sunday painter, actually. He's very good. He made a lot of abstract works, and he's actually very good. Like, better than a lot of the stuff I see in the galleries. But he got zero. He wasn't very social, and, you know, so he's still around, though, so props to him. But you see, what he would say is, you know, you look at these old Renaissance paintings, they actually get pretty rough when you go close.
00:18:14.804 - 00:18:44.514, Speaker A: And that's basically what you're seeing here. And again, it's kind of like this revealing the process a little bit. Like, if it was too smooth, it wouldn't be as interesting, if you ask me. And you see all the labor that goes into this, you know, so just a gorgeous work of art. Another thing that's interesting on this is the color we were talking about, de Chirico's green skies. And here you have, like, green clouds, a dark green sky. It's like a blue green.
00:18:44.514 - 00:19:16.484, Speaker A: And it's, again, the St. Christopher, I think it's called, and patron of travelers. And you see, you know, some of the work seems to be revolving around the Ukraine war. You see these mines. So a lot of symbolism. There's just so much going on in his work, and you can't tell if that's a sun or a halo around. And he always has this kind of hat tip to italian painting, which is always appreciated in this neck of the woods.
00:19:16.484 - 00:19:33.376, Speaker A: Let's look at the eyes, actually, really quickly. Do we have this open? Let's look at the eyes. Because the eye. The details. Actually, we have a much better, I think, rendition here. Here we go. Yeah, yeah.
00:19:33.376 - 00:19:53.864, Speaker A: Look at the eyes on this thing. So, I mean, again, I call this, like, a digital art revolution that's happening on Tazos. And look no further. You know, so, yeah, so there's that. So, ratcloakseed, check out his work. There's. We're gonna go to other.
00:19:53.864 - 00:20:02.444, Speaker A: I'm not gonna spoil. Like. I mean. Okay, we'll go to one last work. His first work is. Or. No, not his first work.
00:20:02.444 - 00:20:28.144, Speaker A: Let's see if I can find it, because this episode is already going long. But, you know, there's just so much to talk about with him and maybe. I think it's the fall of Pepylon. I mean, it's, like, unbelievable work, this work. Oh, it raised the price. Did someone buy this? I was looking at it at a thousand. I was seriously considering buying this at a thousand tezos.
00:20:28.144 - 00:21:00.716, Speaker A: Did someone buy it? No, the price just got relisted two days ago. Darn. I mean, like, that may have. The train may have left the station on this, guys, I wouldn't be selling this for a thousand tezos in a million years. It's an edition of 15. So, I mean, this is, like, one of the most spectacular digital artworks out there. Again, he's got this, like, reference to, like, the fall of Babylon.
00:21:00.716 - 00:21:15.180, Speaker A: Like, we've seen this before. I'm trying to think. Who is that? Bruegel? Shall we look? Let's look. Bruegel. Babylon. Yeah. Okay.
00:21:15.180 - 00:21:39.984, Speaker A: All right. I don't know if this is the direct reference, but yeah, you see? Okay, Peter Bruegel the Great. What is he, like, Flemish? It's german Wikipedia, so I'm not sure. Yeah, but, I mean, you see this thing here. So. And then we go back to here. So I'm not sure which reference he used.
00:21:39.984 - 00:22:03.688, Speaker A: Maybe he made it his own, too, which is always nice. I'm sure. A lot of this stuff, actually. So who knows where he got a lot of this from? Here's the creme de creme crowd, you know, one of the main groups on tezos. There's, like, a pepe in the background. I mean, let's just maximize this. So, yeah, I guess I missed my opportunity.
00:22:03.688 - 00:22:36.824, Speaker A: But again, like, you can't own everything, and I can't own everything, that's for sure. I mean, a spectacular work of art. I mean, the fall, it's just spectacular. So yeah, you see the shoes, the detail, so they rose the price on this wisely, I was like, I almost moved in on this. I was thinking, I'm gonna lose my opportunity. It looks like I did. I mean, knows, maybe you could probably put an offer for a thousand and maybe there probably would be a taker.
00:22:36.824 - 00:23:08.684, Speaker A: So, like, the last offer that came in was for 169 from Vincent van Doe, who has actually pretty good taste. I have to say, I learned a few things from his collection, so props to him. And, yeah, so I don't want to go too far. What I did want to do, though, is just. I want to show you sort of like an early phone work that I did. I'm actually pretty proud of. I see if superwear actually works today.
00:23:08.684 - 00:23:27.224, Speaker A: Let's see. This is also made on the phone. Actually, this is not as early. This is maybe. Let me see if I put the. Actually, sorry, that's in the main collection. I have a couple of works that I could show you that were done on the phone.
00:23:27.224 - 00:23:51.344, Speaker A: I still think the phone is a majorly underutilized tool. A lot of these compositions here actually start on the phone. Let's see. Here we go. This was a very early phone artwork that I did. This came. We actually have an offer on that, an early iPhone work by Adrian Pockebelli.
00:23:51.344 - 00:24:21.504, Speaker A: I was calling it Internet pop. A thousand by a thousand. I used. Yeah, so, yeah, so basically what you have going on here, I'm quite proud of this work. This is basically a Robert Rauschenberg painting that stretched the hell out of using some sort of glitch app. Then I used the layout app, which I think is owned by Instagram now. And so I took a iPhone ad, or, sorry, an ad, a mobile ad on classic 300 pixel ad.
00:24:21.504 - 00:24:40.882, Speaker A: And in that app, you could actually move the image where, like, the top will be at the bottom. So that's the bottom of the ad. This is the top. And so based on a screenshot, then I put a little bit of an angle on it. I was really proud of this. So this was. I did a few car ads, and then you get the drips, but you also get this digital thing going on.
00:24:40.882 - 00:25:00.154, Speaker A: Car ad number two. And one more digital. Yeah, this was another really interesting one. So I say again, combining traditional painting, sampling. Okay. Like, this is like hip hop for me. I'm not even a huge hip hop guy.
00:25:00.154 - 00:25:26.424, Speaker A: I'm more techno. But you see sampling paintings. This is from a Larry Rivers painting and taking the brushstrokes and then using layering to, like, not sure what you're doing. Then you remove and add layers, change to multiply, and before you know it, you have something pretty interesting on your hands. Again, composed on an iPhone six s. This is my genesis piece. It's actually.
00:25:26.424 - 00:25:36.870, Speaker A: Someone is selling it. Instigator. Wow. They even put it as their profile picture. Thank you. Instigator. They're selling it for ten ETH.
00:25:36.870 - 00:25:48.366, Speaker A: Wow. Okay. So I guess they like the work. I like the work, too. Isn't that great? I'm glad that they like it. So, you know, it's in the right hands, and they're selling it for ten ETH. Okay.
00:25:48.366 - 00:26:03.750, Speaker A: Thank you very much. I'm glad you like it. So this is from my peloponnesian war art book. I call it study for the Peloponnesian War. We have many episodes to go here, folks, so let's just leave it here. We will go into that and what's going on in that series in a future episode. Thank you for joining me once again.
00:26:03.750 - 00:26:07.934, Speaker A: I hope you enjoyed it. Until next time, take care. Bye.
