00:00:04.960 - 00:00:49.444, Speaker A: Well, we may be blinded, we may be broke, but we have each other. My friends. Artist Journal, November 14, 2022 in Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pokabelli. I'm so happy tradscape made this music. It's in my head, you know, every so often I'll be in the middle of the night and I'll have this music and I'll just be so excited, actually, so excited to get to where, where I am right now to talk to you and have this great discussion, this great ongoing discussion that we are having. And look at this, another portrait.
00:00:49.444 - 00:01:46.724, Speaker A: Humbling, humbling from trezodinks, one of our favorite, I consider a concept artist of sorts, even though some people don't like that term. And yeah, so that's a whole discussion. What's a concept artist and et cetera, et cetera. But I find his works conceptual and just very fun. So anyways, Pokebelly's phone designs for living and the dime store Pepe's mint features a portrait of the artist and broadcaster Adrian Pokebelli inspired by an explanation of bad design ideas given on his artist journal YouTube show. So of course we were using the example of, remember, in design, there are right answers and there are wrong answers and there are many right answers. There are good choices and bad choices and there are many good choices.
00:01:46.724 - 00:02:30.958, Speaker A: But I was asked to give an example of a bad choice in design. I was like, well, or in art. And again, I consider design as the greater thing, design, you know, again, if you go to the. Do I have it here? If you go to the lives of the painters and sculptors, you know, I believe it's at the start of Michelangelo's or at the start of the book, it says, you know, masters of design is how the Italians put it in the Renaissance there. So anyways, so design. So again, I consider art design as the greater umbrella, you might say. And art is a section of design.
00:02:30.958 - 00:03:03.264, Speaker A: And I consider art a poetic form of design. It's basically design with the poetic element, which brings in an irrational element. But to simplify the discussion, we're discussing about design, you know, and there being good and bad choices. And what is a bad choice? Well, maybe putting the keyboard on the side right of a phone rather than putting it underneath or hiding it within, which both could be considered good choices, depending on your purpose. Sorry. The sun is very bright. It might be this way for a few weeks, guys, just so you know, this morning.
00:03:03.264 - 00:03:53.774, Speaker A: So anyways, so it appears here we have a inventor, the pepe guy with his pipe pondering this side keyboard on the side with this wonderful portrait, by the way, this very nice portrait of this channel. So thank you again. It's always hilarious. You know, there are different kinds of fame. You know, there's pop star fame where it's like, you know, you're famous for the moment, and then it all disappears, and it's kind of like, it's very ephemeral, and there's long lasting. And I love being like, this is great, guys, because you never know how the future looks on these works. And that's the kind of the, you might call it the more important kind.
00:03:53.774 - 00:04:29.678, Speaker A: And we do that with each other in this community. We're gonna see KHC does it with Haiti Rockette. And again, just look at this beautiful portrait. So really, really nice work. And I also like this contrast of, you see the textured brush here, like the oil paint brush simulation. And this contrasts really nicely with what I'd call a native digital brush here, that this native digital brush work here. So just kind of an interesting contrast, because the temptation, I think, is to do it all with this textured brush.
00:04:29.678 - 00:05:00.174, Speaker A: But no Trezail rodents is putting some smooth, untextured work in there, and it creates a pretty nice contrast. So, anyways, big shout out again. I think Treza Rodanx, also known as vax machine, fax machinevich, and wasteman gold Mineovich is probably the person that's appeared on this show the most. So, anyways, big shout out. I've been loving and enjoying the work, and it's always a lot of fun, which is what we have here. Digital bobbles also having fun. Holy Sunday.
00:05:00.174 - 00:05:15.334, Speaker A: So glad to pick up this piece by pokebelly, dude. Killing it again. So thank you, digital bobbles. That made my day that you were so happy to get it. It's what you want as an artist. It's nothing that makes you happier. Someone buys your work and is just thrilled that they were able to get it.
00:05:15.334 - 00:05:42.708, Speaker A: That is a wonderful thing. And here is the work. So, again, just part of this pixel art sketchbook, and again, my definition of pixel art. And feel free to disagree and leave a comment if you disagree with this. I'm calling it a digital art made with a square brush. That is my definition, rather than a circular brush. Because if we just say simply pixelated art.
00:05:42.708 - 00:06:12.404, Speaker A: Well, if you zoom in enough with a circular brush, it's all going to be squares, right? It's all going to be anti aliased squares, right? If you use a round brush in Photoshop, it's still going to be little squares. So that's why I put the emphasis on the brush. Digital art made with a square brush. That is my definition of pixel art. Feel free to agree or disagree in the comments. I love the comments. We have a couple coming up here.
00:06:12.404 - 00:06:40.344, Speaker A: And just finally on this nine books, Elon Musk recommends to turn your life around. I've been working with these promoted stories for years. It was my first show in Berlin, actually in 2016. I moved here in 2016, and I had a show like February 2017. I remember my friend that was like, I don't know if you want to move here. It's not as easy as it sounds. She's like, I can't believe you have a show already.
00:06:40.344 - 00:07:01.110, Speaker A: That was great. And I got very lucky. I was drinking and I ran into the bartender that I knew, and he just happened to run this gallery. And then he's like, oh, you should have a show. It was like underground Berlin. Constantine from Zedbar, you know, which Fatimorgana. I should show you guys the pictures of the last day of Fatimorgana, which was two weeks ago.
00:07:01.110 - 00:07:37.864, Speaker A: Too much to do here. Anyways, promoted stories have been a theme of mine for a very long time, and here we have nine books. Elon Musk recommends to turn your life around, along with some screenshots of other stuff, some sort of weight gain sort of stuff. And it's interesting to do a series and it evolves and it's just, I love this pixel art sketchbook thing. From a personal point of view. It's very fun to do because you can kind of do anything. It's a sketchbook, and I'm really enjoying that kind of freedom of not having too many rules other than I'm using a square brush and playing with some themes that are kind of similar.
00:07:37.864 - 00:08:15.210, Speaker A: Anyways, continuing on, Runetune has a very, I thought, a nice addition to our conversation on displays. Here it is. Display tech for NFTs is something I think about more than anything, in my opinion. There is no one simple answer. Certain artwork, I think, requires a certain frame, just like physical artwork needs a variety of framing solutions to best fit each work of art. Your tempelhof or rowers in the River Urumea, for instance, look fantastic on the Kindle's matted paper, like black and white display. And you might remember that from an earlier show.
00:08:15.210 - 00:09:18.570, Speaker A: Runetun put out a tweet of how those works, those black and white works looked on a Kindle display, and they look fantastic. It looks like the best way to show those works or any other kind of sketch kind of work is actually on like a Kindle display, you know, like, with all these ideas. Like, you know, these are worth money, these ideas, because if we ran a display company, we'd be like, yeah, we're going to work on our actual something for sketches. And we'd have a totally unique product, you know, continuing on, whereas Haiti Rockette's work, I imagine, on an old television from the nineties, I think he'd like that. A Sears 13 inch CRT tv, for instance, and other work would look better projected or framed on a nice flat screen. So, yeah, so I guess the point is here, and I think rune tune makes an excellent point. It kind of depends on the work, right? Like, and it's also, you could just say, like, a square work like Hades on a tv, 16 by nine tv wouldn't really work because, I mean, you have these huge black things.
00:09:18.570 - 00:09:40.254, Speaker A: I mean, you could do it, but it's just, you know, so I totally agree. And I think this advances the conversation actually significantly. I think it's true. Good point. The artwork that is being displayed speaks to what the display should be. I totally agree. Great point.
00:09:40.254 - 00:10:16.638, Speaker A: So, object.com, they have put out a statement along with FX, hashtag community and versum official on this whole royalties debate. So despite the price of tezos crashing through the floor, it was below a dollar again. Nevertheless, maybe this is the more important thing. Shout out to our friends, FX hashtag community and versum official for all coming together with us to protect artists royalties on tazos. And here is the statement. Respect artists royalties.
00:10:16.638 - 00:10:44.514, Speaker A: Without artists, there is no art. We pledge to never switch to 0% creator royalties, protect artists earning rights, and empower artists in web3. These platforms respect royalties. So big shout out to object, fxhash and versum, you know, that's, you know, we like that. Thank you. You know, shout out. Interestingly, Opensea reversed course.
00:10:44.514 - 00:11:18.134, Speaker A: Update. We will continue to enforce creator fees on all existing collections. Now, I got an email from super rare, along with every other person that probably is on that email list. They were taking issue with Opensea calling it fees. They're like, they're royalties, they're not fees. And I thought that was actually a pretty good point, because all of a sudden, fees, it sounds like a tax, right? Like, I mean, semantics. These things matter, you know, so you can tell the way they're trying to frame it originally is, oh, these are just fees.
00:11:18.134 - 00:11:54.444, Speaker A: And who wants fees, right? Whereas royalties for artists, that's a great thing. So anyways, you can read their tweet but basically the long and the short of it is the community pushed back quite hard to the community's credit here. So that's, you know, thankfully. So that's a good sign, right. There is hope out there. Despite all the sort of scammy business we've seen in the last couple of days, not really a shock to anybody or, sorry, I should say shock to some people. Not really a shock to me or to many of us, let's put it that way.
00:11:54.444 - 00:12:21.166, Speaker A: I did want to point this out, though. Opensea put out, in their defense, they put out this bar chart here. So in the red here, you see more and more people. This is like, by the week, like this is October 12 and this is November 2. So you see less and less people were paying the fees on like, on collections as they're saying. This isn't theoretical. This is happening.
00:12:21.166 - 00:13:04.960, Speaker A: And more and more collections are not getting their fees. So it's something that, yeah, so you can understand where they're coming from. If the, if all of a sudden everybody's like, hey, we don't, if all the traders are like, we don't want to use your platform because we have to pay the fees personally, don't. Yeah, like, I want to be on Opensea and just not think about it. So I think they made the right decision. Continuing on, Haftka just found out everything I posted recently on Twitter has been minted by a faker on polygon. So we were talking about like the, the kind of, the great look it makes of posting work that you don't mint.
00:13:04.960 - 00:13:31.170, Speaker A: It just looks like you have tons of work. It's just a fun thing. Right. And see, works in progress, you don't need to mint everything, right? Like, sometimes it's just a work in progress. Are you gonna mint that? Well, some people are. So someone was minting Haftka, who we remember. He's the guy that made a couple of speeches who's got works in the SFMOMA, a bit older, and he's been doing really well on Ethereum.
00:13:31.170 - 00:13:49.674, Speaker A: I think he's on super rare. I'm not sure. If you think you're looking at my mint, make sure it's not by the scammer. So someone posting some of his unmented work. This happened September 11. It makes me reconsider posting work in progress and unmented work. Yeah, it's kind of interesting.
00:13:49.674 - 00:14:32.982, Speaker A: Hey, it does cross my mind, like, I mean, at the end of the day, collectors gotta know where they're buying from, right? Like. Cause I still kind of want to do it, but it does like, oh, also, I'm like, oh, maybe I don't want to post XYZ work. Because that one, I'd hate to see someone mint that first, because all of a sudden, there's a kind of a legitimacy issue. If you're the first to mint something, it kind of gives you a certain claim, doesn't it? So, yeah, so it's kind of a bit of a tricky issue here. So I just wanted to highlight that because I thought it was quite interesting. So this person is unhappy about Tezos price. And here is Minta on the crypto roller coaster.
00:14:32.982 - 00:14:54.920, Speaker A: We are experiencing some emotional trip with this crypto market. Me and my friend Pepe, we are luckily. Okay, good to hear. This is a drawing. Now, I assume this is a drawing in procreate. I quite like this Tezos comet. And actually, the whole concept is quite smart, I think, of being actually on a roller coaster and just the whole thing, I just really like it.
00:14:54.920 - 00:15:25.124, Speaker A: So, nice work, Minta. Buy for five tezos and sold out at a Tezos 50 on Friday and Saturday. So there's the live Tezos price for you. And I just wanted to point this out. Okay. So, a year ago, Tezos was at $5.87. So looking at the glass half full, you are getting basically an 80% off of your collecting.
00:15:25.124 - 00:15:57.834, Speaker A: So, again, when I started this program, I said, this is not. This is not a common scenario where the middle class gets to collect high quality art for next to nothing. This never happens. Okay? And you're getting it for a song. You're getting these works for very cheap. So, heads up. Put on your collector's hat is sort of my, you know what? I would suggest axine.
00:15:57.834 - 00:16:28.204, Speaker A: So, working in multimedia, as he put here, quoting the program, shout out, aksin. We are multimedia. Multi chain. Okay? And so he is working multimedia. And you know how we're talking, you know, being multi chain, how diversifying across chains? Well, I think it also behooves us to diversify across mediums. Cause let's say crypto does crash and is down for two or three years again. It's sort of like.
00:16:28.204 - 00:16:57.346, Speaker A: It's like a financial portfolio. You don't want to put all your eggs in one basket. You don't want your business to just depend on one little section. You want to kind of have business development in all these areas, because a lot of the collectors do not overlap. You know, people who might want to buy this physical work here, they may not even have started. They probably don't have a kukai wallet or a Tezos wallet. They may never even have no clue what metamask is, right.
00:16:57.346 - 00:17:18.714, Speaker A: And how blockchain works. And they might be curious. They might want to know, but maybe they're willing to give you $20 for this work here. Okay, so very cool oxine. And, you know, and we haven't even talked about the work. Like, look at how interesting it is to see his digital work physically rendered. Physically so fascinating.
00:17:18.714 - 00:17:34.286, Speaker A: Look at. And you get all this stuff that doesn't. That happens only in the physical world. This stuff here. Beautiful, right? These sort of accidental things. See, the ink or whatever it is seems to have collected here. Right? So again, yeah.
00:17:34.286 - 00:18:05.540, Speaker A: Multi chain multimedia. So diversifying across mediums as well as chains. Why shouldn't we? I mean, again, and just, you know, the person on the street will take you more seriously if you're not just like some, you know, and I love nfts, but you're not just some NfT artist or some digital artist. You have sculptures, you have prints, you have et cetera paintings. You have. And you are on the blockchain and you're not just on one. Okay.
00:18:05.540 - 00:18:35.080, Speaker A: Then it's like, okay, I should take this person pretty seriously is basically what is communicated there. And speaking of multimedia, we have t shirts here. Here's merch. So Mikey de la creme, personally not a big brand guy, been rocking these isolationist shirts. And we have covered isolationist. I realized on the weekend we covered isolationist's genesis on super rare. Because I was saying on Thursday or Friday, I wasn't sure if we'd covered him or not.
00:18:35.080 - 00:19:06.992, Speaker A: And we have, and here is a t shirt by isolationist. Pretty cool. And this is by ad, I believe, whose work we're going to see later in this show. So very cool, right? And also, speaking of Mikey D la creme, read this. I put my heart and soul. I put my heart and soul into two upcoming eavesdrops on Arthropo NFT, bringing some of the best up and coming artists from the Tezos scene. Let's see who is truly here to support artists.
00:19:06.992 - 00:19:32.054, Speaker A: Tomorrow we kick it off with my homie gloomtube. And we have this new work by Gloomtube on Ethereum. I think it's his only mint that'll be on Ethereum. And a very cool work here. A classic sort of suburban kind of nightmare. Yeah. So anyways, so give Arthur Poe and Mikey some support.
00:19:32.054 - 00:19:44.924, Speaker A: And here is the schedule. And again, I consult once in a while with Arthur Poe. LFG. Here's the drop schedule for next week's. And this is Vincent van Do is involved as well. Picks for the field trip. Mint.
00:19:44.924 - 00:20:11.028, Speaker A: Very prominent collector in the space here. Gloomtube is on Monday, Bazae is on Tuesday. Sumi is on Wednesday, Gabby Walter is on Thursday, and Lavon is on Friday. So you have a full week of basically great art on Arthropo to just kind of keep tabs on, on Ethereum. Bringing Tezos artists to Ethereum. Dana Ulama. Just a cool work in progress.
00:20:11.028 - 00:20:46.056, Speaker A: Let's take a look that might have started halfway through, actually, let's start at the start here. You see all the little adjustments. And I'm loving this whole, like, anime manga, vaporwave thing, kind of cyberpunk thing that I kind of discovered from limbo and everybody else, you know, Atmos, the guy who does those insanely great cyberpunk works. Look at this. So again, classic colors and then look at all. Look at all this stuff. So good night, Dana.
00:20:46.056 - 00:21:05.044, Speaker A: Goodnight. Like, wow. More interesting colors from Michael Macasso and who seems to be recovering from his flu. Another bigger landscape piece done. I think I'll have to descale my daily piece back to basics in the next few days. I feel like I'm missing something fundamental. I don't know, I kind of like it.
00:21:05.044 - 00:21:42.330, Speaker A: I actually quite like it. And the color I find actually, is that is the star of the show here. Like, to me, in a sense, the landscape, which is really well executed, it's so well executed that you don't even think about it, you just accept it and the sky and all of these little decisions, and then it becomes about the color, which is really, to me, unusual in a very, very good way. There's another one here where he's experimenting daily practice. So the time lapse is coming out of this soon. So hopefully that crosses my desk and we can take a look at that. And look at this.
00:21:42.330 - 00:22:13.430, Speaker A: I missed this edition of 20. We saw the preview on twitter there. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful pixel artwork. Looks like a japanese inspiration. This was interesting here, trying to translate and appropriate the Shin hunga notable technique with the pixel art medium. So remember we were talking about combination before and the nature of technology, that book. So, yeah, so just combining different things to get to new results.
00:22:13.430 - 00:22:53.878, Speaker A: Look at how effective this is. And this was basically, offers were accepted between ten and 20 and a couple of early ones for four. So not exactly sure how this all worked, if it was a lottery or what. But all to say, yeah, if you blinked, you missed it, and I blinked. So gate, look at this. This was, like, super duper cool. Kurt Hussle collective combined with Haiti rocket in the background and a portrait of Haiti, who's dazed by his own work in his own VR Windows world here.
00:22:53.878 - 00:23:21.732, Speaker A: And this is just totally rad. Right? So, yeah, I mean, what is there to say? But, you know, your mouth agape and just staring at this incredible show. What a great portrait. He has been acclimated into the puppet pioneers. So congratulations, Haiti. Is this fun? Us all doing portraits of each other and everything. So rip hen happened.
00:23:21.732 - 00:23:33.304, Speaker A: And this is also by Haiti rocket. Never rip. Cool message. And a very cool work. Interesting colors, too. Very interesting colors. That green with the red.
00:23:33.304 - 00:23:52.336, Speaker A: Rip. Rip. And then you can see hen is right there. Okay, so a diskette with a skull on it. Hilarious. And then a big skeleton here. So, yeah, so people are marking the one year anniversary of when Hen went down and basically disappeared.
00:23:52.336 - 00:24:25.626, Speaker A: I think his name was Charles, the guy who started Han, and then he just took down the website one day. I think, as someone pointed out recently, the great thing about decentralization is we could just set up a different website and you just plug into the blockchain and you're good. Like, it's not like it disappears because it was on someone's server. Right. So really, the virtue of decentralization is reminded to us with this hen rip, you know, one year later. So access denied. This is by popple.
00:24:25.626 - 00:24:39.978, Speaker A: This is great. But it's still here. So it never disappeared. The hen and the spirit of hen. And I love the signature down here. So access denied. And then the skull or the skeleton comes up from the dead.
00:24:39.978 - 00:24:49.548, Speaker A: Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. Popple. I picked one of these up. It's still here. Great title. Heroic title. Richard Nadler.
00:24:49.548 - 00:25:05.460, Speaker A: Look at this. So one of the most, biggest collectors on hand. He's probably bought some of your works. He's bought some of my works. Shout out Richard Nadler, who is on super rare. And what an incredible journey this year was. Started at Hen, collecting wonderful art.
00:25:05.460 - 00:25:28.382, Speaker A: And now my dreams have come true and I have become a full time artist. That is the dream for so many of us, isn't it? Thank you all for your support alongside my journey. Looking forward to 2023 with all of you. Almost an early New Year's message from Richard Nadler. Shout out. Huge collector and huge patron of the space. Really? Yeah.
00:25:28.382 - 00:26:00.350, Speaker A: So that's exciting. Just wanted to shout that out. And also, so our guy, Edge Q, who does, like, these collectible cases and trading cards. Big favorite subject of mine, actually. And I thought this was a really nice, charming tribute to hen. Kind of putting the hen website not loading up properly within this collective casing. So a very smart design is how I'd almost put this.
00:26:00.350 - 00:26:19.982, Speaker A: I need to mint hen crashes. That's okay. It's part of the charm. And so there it is. New work by Edgeq celebrating Rip Hen. Also, limbo put out a work it was tough to see. This is a pixel artwork, so beautifully done here, but you don't really see the pixels too much.
00:26:19.982 - 00:26:44.502, Speaker A: I think it's because it's this. I'm not sure if this is a preparatory sketch or if this is the work, and it's just twitter is kind of low res, but again, pixel art is, in my opinion, you know, art made with a square brush. So this may have been made with a square brush, but it doesn't exactly look like it there. So maybe this is just preparatory. It's a work in progress. Should I drop it when it's done, or does it sucks, be honest. Bye.
00:26:44.502 - 00:27:18.624, Speaker A: Ah, so limbo is an awesome follow is all you need to know from that tweet, and it's a beautiful work. Limbo, here's some preparatory sketches for his super rare genesis, which, I gotta say, him talking about it for a couple of weeks is generating the hype in my mind. It's like, I can't wait to see what this is gonna look like. And he's got all these great sketches here. Like, you see the artistry of limbo here, and just these notes, artificial, interchangeable hand. So just super duper cool. As per usual here, this was interesting.
00:27:18.624 - 00:27:47.454, Speaker A: Kind of reminded me of a, you know, those fashion designer sketches. This is a new artist who we haven't seen yet, so just kind of like almost a. It looks like it's digitally made and kind of like an ink and gouache sort of look to it. Minaloy tez woven sketch seven. And so I thought that was pretty interesting. And you can see Minaloi tez's work here. Just a quick overview.
00:27:47.454 - 00:28:12.318, Speaker A: So doesn't it look like a bit of a breakthrough work here with this gouache? Sort of like gouache looking digital paint, and I assume it's digital. So just a heads up there. And look at this. Another, you know, tempting to call this a masterpiece. Another beautiful work by Adelia. Morning routine. So her morning routine divided into a comic sketch.
00:28:12.318 - 00:28:51.788, Speaker A: I think it's brilliant again. And so here is her getting woken up by her alarm as she's sleeping. 08:00 then she starts to eat, like, some dumplings or something brushes her teeth and eating some more. I'm not sure how it works. Or maybe it goes here and then cooking and then eating in a big GM super duper. Cool. I love how she doesn't say little decisions, like, not making that paneling like pure white, and even putting this where it's like, you can close it just like a window, like a Mac window.
00:28:51.788 - 00:29:44.472, Speaker A: So just beautiful, beautiful work. Only went for 140. I put in a couple of bids, but it was just too much for my current situation, my daily routine in the morning. How about you? So, just an awesome, awesome work. You know, I was thinking to myself, at the risk of being pretentious, it's sort of like if you think of Picasso and cubism as kind of like, you know, if you were to take me and then you divide it cubistically, for lack of a better word, it would be like me from different perspectives, right? And then kind of all smudged together in one piece. And what you have here is instead of it being cubism of space, it's kind of like a cubism of time. It's all these different moments in the morning, all smushed together in one piece in a comic book form.
00:29:44.472 - 00:30:04.464, Speaker A: I mean. So, again, maybe I'm taking it a little farther, but that is the thought that kind of crossed my mind. Beautiful, beautiful. One of one GM from byte by bit. So, sticking on the GM theme. So, again, using. I think it's called Bannermania.
00:30:04.464 - 00:30:17.512, Speaker A: Love this one. Would have loved to have picked this up. I think it sold in, like, two minutes. Let's just see. Yeah. 15 tezos, minted at 43, sold at 45. So congrats on that.
00:30:17.512 - 00:30:34.376, Speaker A: 15 tezos 1989 banner mania. You can just imagine that at the entrance of a museum, the museum of your mind museum. In your mind of your digital museum. GM, you show up banner. It's fun already. I already glad I paid for that ticket. Continuing on, Daniel W.
00:30:34.376 - 00:30:58.848, Speaker A: So the series didn't end with the owl heads up palmistry. Except for the old diagram on the wall, it's empty like the other rooms. You know what? Maybe this isn't part of the weird and terrifying series. Okay, so maybe it did end with the owl. I thought this composition was quite interesting. Bit of a golden ratio thing going on here. Let me just maximize this bit of a golden ratio thing going on here.
00:30:58.848 - 00:31:22.016, Speaker A: Like, you know, you could divide it into third. The rule of thirds. Right? So, kind of. You can see it almost here. Like, the focal point is here a little bit, maybe there a little bit lower with the palm somewhere between the eye and the palm. And so interesting, kind of how there's this big wall, and then this is just kind of put here. And even this weird kind of dotted area.
00:31:22.016 - 00:31:48.722, Speaker A: The glue is almost coming off the wall or something. And then just some other interesting compositional elements here. The plugin the socket kind of balances out this composition a little bit, doesn't it? I'm not sure if that's british socket. I'm not sure. And even the floor turns this from just kind of a. You know, it turns it into a space, like an architectural space. Also the socket.
00:31:48.722 - 00:32:03.594, Speaker A: So also kind of interesting, as well as this kind of little detail here, so. And the rip and everything. There's a physicality to this. So just. I found it to be a pretty interesting composition. Sold out right away. Edition of 23.
00:32:03.594 - 00:32:19.222, Speaker A: Look at this stunning work by uxing. Question authority. A self portrait. Like, this is awesome. Kind of reminds me of William Burroughs with the firearm here. Yeah, dangerous artist, question authority. And kind of.
00:32:19.222 - 00:32:44.534, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, just playing with that whole italian religious imagery. And then, you know, the three, like, it's awesome. Awesome. I would have loved to have picked this up. I had no money in my wallet, so. Yeah, but just a beautiful work, the skeleton. Even little details like the skull at the bottom of the hourglass looks like a army figure fail now.
00:32:44.534 - 00:33:16.384, Speaker A: Which looks like a Campbell soup can, but, you know, appropriated from the malware museum. Oxy. Now you have to buy for 50, or you can put an offer in. People aren't taken at 15. So, again, a rad, rad work here. Interesting abstract work by Max Drecker, synth, as we move into our abstract section. So, again, playing with that op art sort of thing, because as soon as you try and render the space here and figure it out what it's supposed to be, it starts to decompose.
00:33:16.384 - 00:33:33.004, Speaker A: So you. Yeah, kind of an AWP art business here. Kind of escher meets, like, Bridget Riley or something like that. Or an AWP artist of some kind. Max Drecker edition of one. Did this sell? Yeah, for 60. Pretty nice price.
00:33:33.004 - 00:33:50.144, Speaker A: Dan control with €10 done in his ASCII format. So another kind of semi abstract work. Just very interesting. Love all this stuff here. All this, like, punctuation and quotes and commas and apostrophes. I love it. I love it.
00:33:50.144 - 00:34:20.014, Speaker A: And again, remember, asymmic writing, which is writing that's been divorced from its meaning. It's just kind of its visual components that we're kind of focusing on. And there's a lot of that going on here. Again, it's using ASCII like text. It's easy to forget, but with some color and with his own kind of flair, measureless has a new one in this. It's kind of a new series of these animated abstracts that measureless has been putting out. Pretty nice.
00:34:20.014 - 00:34:39.425, Speaker A: Sold out edition of 24. And I think it was a Tezos 20, if I remember right. Yeah, it was a tezos 20, and now it's 640. So you had to jump on that one. And you see here. So this was the first series, which I'm a huge fan of. You can still get this series for basically $20.
00:34:39.425 - 00:34:53.333, Speaker A: Okay. And this is a very, very nice series. The one with the black background. This has a dark green background. So it's like a new series. And so anyways, it's interesting to just see the experimentation. I think measureless is really onto something.
00:34:53.333 - 00:35:28.574, Speaker A: Ox three y three, who I think we've shown once or twice, at least, with a beautiful animated abstract. It looks like an infinite staircase here with some flashing lights. Give you guys a break from the flashing here. Chrisopia landings, minted for rip hen. So cool. And then Kristin Roose, another prominent animated abstract artist, or digital artist that works with abstracts, has this beautiful work. Do we have any info? Not really.
00:35:28.574 - 00:35:50.052, Speaker A: So, edition of 100. I think the mint price was five. And so, yeah, sold out of that. So, I mean, nice business, right? 500 even. $500. Imagine if tazos was like a buck 50. Like that becomes like you're paying rent, you know, making rent.
00:35:50.052 - 00:36:04.364, Speaker A: Kika Nicolela. Shout out to her. She's picked up a couple of my works. And these are really interesting. These are like the 3d scanner over the photography. Like, it's. What does she call it? Atelier of the artist.
00:36:04.364 - 00:36:34.104, Speaker A: Detail number two, cloud series is a series of photographs taken not with a photo camera, but from cloud points derived from 3d scanned spaces. Okay, and then, so these are the interesting results. So interesting experimentation. More experimentation from rustic digital art playing with the just abstraction. Right. And this pairs really nicely with that other work that we saw, I believe, on Friday to buy for a tezos. Nice and cheap.
00:36:34.104 - 00:36:59.216, Speaker A: Uri J. Put this out time. This is also, I believe, part of rip hen and just a really cool work of a clock. And it looks like in a office of sorts with a ladder going up light. So just lots of fun experimentation, as usual from Yuri J. It's really going somewhere, isn't it, with your EJ? That's my impression. It's just going somewhere.
00:36:59.216 - 00:37:25.076, Speaker A: And it's gonna be fascinating to watch where it goes Diego Barrow with a new work edition of three for five each a night in Istanbul. I think they're having some issues in Istanbul with Internet and whatever. I saw Sumi Ray put out a tweet about that. So I wonder if Diego's in Istanbul. Digital oil painting made on procreate. So knight in Istanbul. Yeah, you could almost start the show with this one.
00:37:25.076 - 00:37:44.224, Speaker A: It's very topical, isn't it? And beautiful work. Again, kind of looks like it's playing with the photos. And here the photo has disappeared. And using procreate and an iPad. Interesting. This little red line here kind of reminds me of Warhol. I do this, you know, leave the mistakes, embrace the mistakes.
00:37:44.224 - 00:38:11.954, Speaker A: And it's tempting to see that there, but it's hard to tell. Anyways, it's beautiful work. I'm tempted to pick it up. Nohe un Istanbul and another natively digital work by Quilanja, waiting for the rain. And the work is called La Tormenta. And it's a huge work, actually. What is the 6000 by 7000? Okay, so that's huge and interesting.
00:38:11.954 - 00:38:28.296, Speaker A: Beige clouds. A little hut at the top of this mountain here. This woman seems to be like, semi telepathic. And again, just that mystical work. Some mushrooms, a cutoff tree. Very, very, very interesting. And this ring around.
00:38:28.296 - 00:38:59.774, Speaker A: And this is that the sun behind. So again, just very fun to watch her go digital. And speaking of cosmic works, we have life and death. One word, do we? By Ed Morolla, who kind of has a hamlet type figure talking to a skull with a laptop that is unplugged. And a Tezos sign down the road under a starry purple, starry sky and looks like one of those vases. So kind of a mysterious work. Naked dude.
00:38:59.774 - 00:39:25.558, Speaker A: And this sold for 22 tezos. One of one. So you can add that to your collection. A couple of interesting works by Sabato. This new series that he's working on seems to be an interior. I like this kind of news thing. And it looks like a gun shop or something, but it's hard to tell, actually, because this kind of part here looks like it's just kind of pasted on to this other part here.
00:39:25.558 - 00:39:58.534, Speaker A: The guns are kind of floating in the air, isn't it? So just kind of mysterious. See it at the there? Is it on a table or is it just kind of floating there? The fan is kind of fun too. There's another one in this series, Degen Lair. Kind of a reference, I think, to our crypto crash that's going on here. And this looks like some sort of medieval, almost stained glass or tinted stained window. And another kind of tv. And this looks like eighties Eurovision or something.
00:39:58.534 - 00:40:19.150, Speaker A: Very interesting. He's just commenting on how people are, like, raising the price of the works by, like, 0.22. Just a heads up that there's a secondary edition listed for 2.22. Tez. Just 0.22 over the floor. Anyone want it? I'm sorry, but these flip tactics are annoying and stupid.
00:40:19.150 - 00:40:49.570, Speaker A: We are here still buying art because we're crazy mfers, not because we're trying to get flips. So people trying to make like $0 and just maybe they just are addicted to flipping, you know, they just love the rush of buying and selling, making that sale. Br eleven with interesting work for the drinkdao. So again, drankdao holders get this for free. They've gotten a ton. Beautiful, beautiful works. This goes for two minutes.
00:40:49.570 - 00:41:19.688, Speaker A: So we're not gonna play the whole thing, but this, you know, almost ancient looking classical setting looks like the. Right. So a play on the colossus of Rhodes, the colossus of thodes, so maybe of toads. And there's your pepe with a purple drank. That's my interpretation. If you can do better, leave a comment below. Yeah, the colossus of Rhodes, I believe.
00:41:19.688 - 00:41:42.194, Speaker A: Yeah, it's like one of the seven wonders of the world that didn't survive. Nice stories on that, Padrino. So let me just load this up. So, eight bit Padrino playing with AI art. So back to this. Pixel art and AI, which I just find incredibly interesting. So Padrino is making some self portraits, I believe.
00:41:42.194 - 00:42:04.854, Speaker A: And just very interesting kind of stuff here. Eight bit Padrino. I'm having too much fun. And here's another one. The beard's super interestingly rendered too, as well as the glasses and everything. Look at even just like those waves on the sea. So just super duper interesting.
00:42:04.854 - 00:42:26.590, Speaker A: Also, what is Ayanna? A little update on what she's doing with AI and digital painting. See, AI painting. So here is the AI, here's the digital painting. So just a very interesting contrast. And so, continuing to experiment, there are black and white stories. And this is something called. From a series called random Untitled.
00:42:26.590 - 00:42:56.594, Speaker A: So again, just playing with this, you know, digital brushstrokes and Mark making a lot of it over here. And with AI, I just find this to be a super interesting contrast with a lot of potential. Look at Venta. I don't know if we've seen this before, but if we haven't, it's worth looking at. Again, these AI works by Venta, like the development venta has made since going into AI is crazy. Crazy. So maybe this is v four of mid journey.
00:42:56.594 - 00:43:28.298, Speaker A: I don't know, but they're, they're quite something, you know, they almost remind me. And maybe this is, maybe one of the sources is Yves Tangi. Oh, I need to show you guys pictures of that surrealist show. I almost forgot about that. I'm gonna try and I'll write it down and I will do it. I'll try and do it tomorrow. This show's long anyway because it's kind of after the weekend, but kind of reminds me, Yves Tanguy is a famous surrealist, and his later work.
00:43:28.298 - 00:43:48.236, Speaker A: Yeah. Almost reminds me what Venta was doing. Almost reminds me of this. Right? Can you see it? These are great paintings. I'm not sure if I actually saw this on the weekend. These are, like, some of his greatest paintings. Anyways, suom, just wrapping up here.
00:43:48.236 - 00:44:12.220, Speaker A: Almost done. Assume. I'm not sure if we looked at this either on Friday, but I thought this was new because we actually had what looks like the artist for the first time in one of these rooms in one of these modern art studios. So I thought that was really cool. Their digital art, AI art mixed media work by Zoom edition of ten. So nice low edition there. And the future of architecture by Mister Ginger sir.
00:44:12.220 - 00:44:36.514, Speaker A: This is using mid journey four. So I'm going to have to break out midjourney four here sometime very soon, too. I mean, that looks pretty cool and kind of really highly rendered. Look at young caravaggio. I noticed this on his instagram. So again, combining AI with contemporary kind of clothing and fashion with Renaissance art. Right? Look at these.
00:44:36.514 - 00:44:59.392, Speaker A: I feel like I know the painting that this came from, these colors. So, anyways, very interesting work. Kind of in the spirit of strange thing a little bit, but totally its own thing. I mean, combining with these Renaissance painting objects. Very interesting. Kind of floating. I believe Pauly Jojo sent me this piece, this tweet, chicken and rice.
00:44:59.392 - 00:45:25.020, Speaker A: Digital and physical, sold for 3600. So again, physical work being sold in a digital marketplace, $3,600 US. This isn't like an NFT. That's a lot of money for physical work. So that's pretty great. And this sold, interestingly, to Richard Nadler. So remember, ad is the guy with the shirt who had the shirt that Mikey de la creme was talking about.
00:45:25.020 - 00:45:56.864, Speaker A: And Richard Nadler is that collector who is now surviving off of art. I don't know if we, I don't want to call him a collector artist because maybe he was an artist first. Unknown collector is kind of our collector artist guy. But anyway, this is really nice work, and it kind of makes it more impressive to me that this was made physically because there's no undo on physical. So obviously, ad is quite a good artist. Now, it's interesting how Adad decided to sell it. Chicken and rice, digital and physical, sold for 3600.
00:45:56.864 - 00:46:22.990, Speaker A: So just another kind of play on this interrelationship between the digital and the physical. So very interesting. Another, I believe, physical work by walk of Mike Tyson. Another just totally original portrait, and which looks totally like Mike Tyson. I think maybe it's just the tattoo, but it looks like Mike Tyson. Just a virtuoso of spray paint, in my opinion. Like, I mean, incredible.
00:46:22.990 - 00:46:28.934, Speaker A: And that, my friends, is our show. Thank you for watching, and until next time, take care.
