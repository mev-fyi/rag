00:00:04.960 - 00:00:51.066, Speaker A: Here we are, the last show of 2022. Inspired by Gertrude Stein's salons of over a century ago. We return a digital art salon for the 21st Century Artist journal, December 30, 2022, Berlin. My name is Adrian Pokebelly. I welcome you back. My friends, my digital friends, true friends out here with all the support that you have given me in this last, since August 12, when I started this, you know, show with scotch tape, scissors, and duct tape. And here we are.
00:00:51.066 - 00:01:51.320, Speaker A: So, anyways, huge thanks for all the support, the comments, you know, ilay with the. Again, the summaries and everything, the retweets. I mean, yesterday, there's over 160 views in, like, the last 18 hours, which might not sound like very much, but this was literally built from, like, you know, the 30 subscribers I had had for ten years who were just, you know, friends and acquaintances that happened to subs, you know, accidentally be subscribed to my channel. So, in other words, we're at, like, 330 subscribers new that we've scraped together in the last few months, and it is much appreciated and all that stuff. So, anyways, I hope you're gonna have a very happy new year here. So Daniel W. With a new piece in his redux collection, the creation of Adam, of course, one of the most famous images in, in the tradition.
00:01:51.320 - 00:02:41.930, Speaker A: And the. I was going to say, you know, in, in. I mean, how do you say it now? I mean, you could say in the western tradition, and that would be true. But I think we could call it in the world art tradition, because it almost seems like, because we're all global now, right? Like, we know this. I know this from the Twitter spaces that I've done. You know, where was the last guy from? Was he from Georgia? You know, like, we're, you know, totally global, and so, which is super, you know, it's easy to forget. So it almost like, so we're not really anymore, you know, just by virtue of the artists that we're dealing with on a daily basis here, you and me, who are on these platforms, checking things out on Twitter and wherever else, this is a global situation here.
00:02:41.930 - 00:03:35.302, Speaker A: So it's hard, you know, so it seems like rather than a western or eastern or whatever, this is a central, a major image in, for lack of better term, and help me out in the comments, if you have a better term, in the global art tradition, in world art. How's that? Okay, so, anyways, I could go on and on. Now, some of you, first of all, the rendition is pretty cool. Cmyk digital. Cmyk cyan. This blue here magenta, this kind of pinkish color, yellow and k is black in printing, for those that don't know, and you might be wondering to yourself, well, what about the green? Well, the green comes, of course, in printing. And actually, Dan does a really nice job of leaving the traces here when you put cyan on the yellow, and there you have a green.
00:03:35.302 - 00:04:09.228, Speaker A: So, anyways, kind of hilarious. Almost a middle aged Adam with a receding hairline here, which is actually pretty funny. And there's a lot of creativity here that's easy to miss. The no pupils in the eyes even, just like the almost anxious face here, the x's on the body there, and the belly button and everything. A lot of you might not know, even the angels. There's a lot of interpretation here that would be easy to just kind of gloss over and go, oh, of course, that's how it should be. But as they say, great artists make it look easy.
00:04:09.228 - 00:04:41.260, Speaker A: And Daniel W. Is making it look easy, isn't he? Quick thing on this image. Let me just do this. Thank you, Alexi, for the command zero there. So creation of Adam, I brought it up here. Now, there are interpretations, and probably most of you will know this, but there are interpretations. I believe, if I remember correctly, that this is also a reference to the heart because they were studying anatomy, and that was new.
00:04:41.260 - 00:05:25.668, Speaker A: And anatomy is kind of like one of those sciences, one of those areas of knowledge that I put right up there with what I was going to call earth sciences, but geography or, sorry, geology, I should say, and what else? And astronomy, you know, like, it's one of those real things that it's just there. And, you know, we can debate on perception and all that, but basically everybody has a heart. Everybody has a nose. Everybody has, you know, generally speaking, you know, there is a sky. There are things we can kind of agree on here that aren't overly theoretical. We can theorize about them and how they came to be, but the fact that they're there, you know. So anatomy, for me, is one of those.
00:05:25.668 - 00:05:50.752, Speaker A: It's tempting to call it a kind of, for lack of better term, universal knowledge. And so here we have it here, right at this God enveloped in what seems to be a heart. Maybe you could also make the argument that this is like a brain. So interesting. I mean, you look at the color and you could argue a heart. Maybe it's none of those things. But anyway, just some food for thought there.
00:05:50.752 - 00:06:15.964, Speaker A: And so interesting. And you see kind of the interpretation that Dan W. Puts on it. So anyways, I thought, pretty brilliant, sold out out or, no, not sold out, just sent to probably some collectors. Mikey Wilson, Flexosaurus. You know, familiar names for those that watch this show and who are on the platform. So anyway, it's very cool work.
00:06:15.964 - 00:07:02.314, Speaker A: Shout out to Bridgetnyc, another name that a lot of us will be familiar with, who picked up Rainbow? I need to put more work on. That's kind of like my new year's resolution. Like, I haven't been overly productive since this show started. Like, it's taken a little more time than I expected, but I'm thrilled with the show, and now I'm basically working it and getting used to everything about it, working the schedule out and everything. So, anyways, I hope to be so much more productive because the more productive you are, and this is the, you know, maybe a takeaway for you, or at least this is what I find, the more productive I am, the less I'm concerned about what I'm putting out. And that's kind of a good feeling. You know, it's sort of like Picasso doing his painting a day, and it turns out how it turns out.
00:07:02.314 - 00:07:35.364, Speaker A: And to me, it reduces some of the self consciousness rather than, okay, here's my one artwork every three months, and then everybody. For everybody to scrutinize. And then we can judge, you know, Pokele based. So there's another virtue in putting out a lot of art, because in a sense, the expectations are diminished, which is nice, as an artist, to actually, because you feel freer and you don't feel like, okay, this has got to be the Mona Lisa here. Okay, so anyways, shout out to Bridget NYC. Thank you for collecting. And also a shout out.
00:07:35.364 - 00:07:53.580, Speaker A: She brought up a really interesting thing here. My object link wasn't working. And she said, and I bring this up because you might have a similar issue. Sometimes those links won't work. She said, use this link because it's shorter. So very helpful. Nice message from Bridgetnyc.
00:07:53.580 - 00:08:16.306, Speaker A: Shout out to you, object.com. So this is a way of shortening your object link if it's too long or if you're having issues, like I had in the Twitter description here of it getting screwed up and I'd have to check on it every so often. This is how you fix it. Object.com at and your username. Thank you, Bridget. So a couple of comments here.
00:08:16.306 - 00:08:42.462, Speaker A: Um, one actually got erased, which is unfortunate. Like, I just put a like on it and sometimes I'm out and about. So I'll reply to it later. I'll like first and reply later. But they're wondering about Manifold XYZ and how it works. And I also got another message from someone about, because we sent out the emergency everybody mint on manifold. So I'm going to go a little bit into that, just a tiny bit, just to give people a clue.
00:08:42.462 - 00:09:24.838, Speaker A: But yeah, I basically barely figured it out myself, but we'll go just very slightly into that so people have a clue. We heard from Runetune as well and yeah, this was great. So first of all, it was definitely me shouting out the LB in the spaces the other day. As I recall, my train of thought was on both the variety of tools being used in the digital art space as well as our penchant for retro hardware and imagery, which was a super interesting discussion. Runetune was suggesting actually that we use like Nikia phones as displays, for example, or retro tech. Very interesting discussion. So LB was one of the first to come to mind and yes, and this was the big highlight for me here of this comment.
00:09:24.838 - 00:09:59.056, Speaker A: I'm very much on board with co hosting a regular weekday spaces happening sometime in the morning estimated. So I'm going to continue with Wednesdays at 930. We're going to try and figure out this medium and try and have a sensational show there. So use links and whatever, just so. I'm excited. Rune tune sounds great too, as we discussed last time. So huge shout out to runetune and if our mystery co host comes back, we can have like three or four co hosts on one Twitter spaces and that might just add everything.
00:09:59.056 - 00:10:24.880, Speaker A: So all is good everywhere. But if Runetune wants to do a regular Wednesdays, that would make my ear okay. This was a really nice comment too from Lucas Andrade de Almeida. Love your videos. Very important, which is a very nice comment. So thank you for that. Also just on this show from a couple of days ago, I was trying to remember the artist here who makes works like this.
00:10:24.880 - 00:10:41.068, Speaker A: And of course Lauren McLaughlin chimes in. Thanks for the fascinating insights. That element of Nicholas Dietrich's work reminded me of Alexander Calder. This may be what you were thinking of too. Exactly. Exactly. You nailed it.
00:10:41.068 - 00:11:18.994, Speaker A: So Alexander Calder and I've never been a huge Calder fan, but I kind of looked up just a little bit here. And of course this is Alexander Calder and the mobiles. Right? And so this was interesting just in this first line here, his innovative mobiles that embrace chance in their aesthetics. So it did make me appreciate a little bit caldermore because they are kind of drifting with the air currents and so you do see chance in action, which was kind of a. So it just made me appreciate Alexander Caldermore, this tiny little write up here. He has other works. This looks like Berlin, actually.
00:11:18.994 - 00:11:53.396, Speaker A: This looks like the Neue national Galerie in Berlin, which is a new museum, I mean, newly rebuilt. So here's Manifold XYZ, and I'm going to keep this pretty short, but just to give you guys a clue. So here is the website, manifold XYZ. You can enter the site, but really you want to go here to the studio login if you want to set up your own contract. And this is what you're going to see here last, this is what we're talking about here. Last chance for OpenSea legacy royalties enforcement. See Opensea here.
00:11:53.396 - 00:12:46.578, Speaker A: Creators have until January 2 at noon Eastern to deploy contracts and mint at least one token to maintain collection contract eligibility for OpenSea royalties without blocking zero royalty marketplaces. So it has to do with royalties. I'm not even super clear on what is what I'm like. It sounds like if you want to kind of create some contracts where you're going to ensure that you get your royalties, that this will help that process future, proof your work by deploying contracts and minting your contracts. First token, now prepping for a future collection. Deploy a new contract and mint a single token with placeholder artwork and metadata to use later. So you see, they're saying, just create your contracts now.
00:12:46.578 - 00:13:12.282, Speaker A: You can fill in the blanks later. Okay, just put a token image there, maybe even a gray rectangle if you want. And then, so you hit deploy a new contract. And then you do stuff like poke belly. Put your symbol, say, like poco. And then here you put an ASCII mark, and so you link down here. And then there is an ASCII generator.
00:13:12.282 - 00:13:33.826, Speaker A: So then you can put pokebelly. And I liked the, was it here, the other ANSI regular. Then you hit select and copy. Put that in. Now you're going to see here. So I'm creating at least two contracts here. When I do it, I'm going to make one for ERC.
00:13:33.826 - 00:14:33.974, Speaker A: Seven hundred twenty one s and one for ERC 1155. So if you're doing additions multiples, you use ERC 1155. If you're doing just one of ones, you'll want to use ERC 721. This is also, I think if you're putting out like a PFP project, probably a lot of people use manifold, I would assume. I don't know, because a lot of PFP projects are 721. So anyways, then you have your put it paste in your ASCII text, deploy on girly now, I've already done this one, let's call it composites, actually, and my mom actually was concerned, rightly so, that some of those composites I was showing yesterday that use three Google image results and then are all put together. You might want to be careful, as she was saying, because maybe if there's a copyright issue, they remove that and you no longer have your kind of opensea royalties locked in.
00:14:33.974 - 00:15:07.404, Speaker A: Kind of. Anyways, I don't want to lose you guys, but all to say, that was an interesting point, but. So I thought I could make multiple contracts here, but she brought up a really interesting point just on copyright there. So composites, I would make ERC 721, because I'd want to do one of ones, maybe I'd call it Poco C and then pokebelly, maybe I'd call it. So I'll try and make one actually pokebally composites. And then we're going to move on here. Because I know you guys are here for the art, but I just got too many questions on this.
00:15:07.404 - 00:15:27.292, Speaker A: So you see something like that. Okay, let's say deploy on girly. And then. Yeah, so then you sign. Now there's something. So what is Gurley? Right, so this is all on Ethereum. And I am going to kill that, because I don't want anybody to see I'm super paranoid about security, even though I don't think that.
00:15:27.292 - 00:15:56.762, Speaker A: So your metamask, and if you don't know metamask, you're probably going to have a hard time getting this all done in the next two days. I don't think it's the end of the world, to be honest. If you don't have this done, but you're going to need probably to know metamask. So this is on the girly testnet. So when you set this up, it asks you to switch your metamask over to girly from the Ethereum main net. Then there's a place where you can get. And you'll find the link.
00:15:56.762 - 00:16:27.124, Speaker A: If you don't have any girly ETH, you go to gurleyfawcet.com, that'll take you here. So it's a little complicated, but if you're familiar with metamask and Ethereum, it's not going to be rocket science. You're going to be on Gurley and then you have to sign up. It's just name, email password, sort of thing. And then once you're signed up, you put in your wallet address. Enter your wallet address here, send me the ETH, and then they send you girly ETH, which isn't worth anything, and that you can use to deploy your contract on manifold.
00:16:27.124 - 00:16:54.396, Speaker A: So I hope that's not too complicated for you, but that is kind of like a brief walkthrough. If you have questions, I'd put it out on Twitter. You can maybe put it in the comments of this Twitter when I tweet this out. Maybe there's someone out there that can help. But I basically just figured this out yesterday. Okay? So best of luck. That's basically the best I can do here within the context of this program, because we've already taken five minutes, and most people are here for the art, so I hope that helps.
00:16:54.396 - 00:17:14.054, Speaker A: Okay. And this is kind of what it looks like. And then after then you deploy a contract on the mainnet, mint a token on the main net. First, you mint a token on girly. Sorry. Then deploy on Mainnet, mint a token on Mainnet, and set up royalties. So for those who are familiar with metamask, you kind of have everything you need kind of here that I've given you here.
00:17:14.054 - 00:17:42.564, Speaker A: There's a bit of a learning curve, but you'll figure it out. Okay. Don't get psyched out by the test net, the girly testnet, because you can get your ETH, they'll send you some free ETH, and it's just like, it's girly ETH, so it's not worth anything. It's testnet ETH. So here's someone that's actually done it. And we looked at Buboy, I think, just yesterday, and they put out a really nice work, actually, another nice drawing. What is this called? Buboy holiday vibe.
00:17:42.564 - 00:18:02.942, Speaker A: An illustrator. And, yeah, open edition, sold 27. So this is an 1155 open editions, because there's more than one. He made an open edition. You see, it says 1155 there, if you want to do one of ones. So I'll create a contract for one of ones. I'll create a contract for.
00:18:02.942 - 00:18:34.808, Speaker A: For Pokebelly editions, and then maybe I'll create a contract for a series, like, just for composites, and go, okay, I want to put the composite series on manifold. I'll make one for that there. And as far as my mom's concerns, I think they're well placed. But at the same time, I think, and I'm not totally sure, I think we have total sovereignty on our contracts. So I'm not even sure they can delete anything once it's up. But she brings up a very good point. So I'll probably start with others and maybe also do a composite.
00:18:34.808 - 00:18:57.724, Speaker A: Let's see. But anyway, thanks, mom. A good concern. So anyways, that person actually buboy sold 27. Nice cheap price, you know, not bad money, frankly. That's probably half an ETH, right? So pretty cool. Turkarak so sold this one of one only for 20.
00:18:57.724 - 00:19:35.532, Speaker A: So five. Turkarak is, of course, you know, kind of focuses a little bit on not in this work, but on the grotesque side of human nature and just kind of interesting social situations. So here it looks like some partiers spray painting after a long night or something. So Turkarak I continue to look at, and I guess this person who bought the work this morning, Captain Kimmy, is also a believer in Turkarak. All the one of ones got snapped up in the last few days. I feel like I should have bought more of them. They're really cheap.
00:19:35.532 - 00:20:06.754, Speaker A: Maybe more will come out. But the race is on now with Turkarak. So anyways, also an illustrative artist. I thought this was just an interesting work that I saw on Twitter. Time to dissociate. And faith love is also on super rare. And so I looked faith love up and I thought this was actually a pretty interesting work here with the, you know, I don't even remember what you call these games, but where you trace the line through the numbers here, follow the numbers to trace the line.
00:20:06.754 - 00:20:26.548, Speaker A: I haven't used one of those for so long, I don't even remember what they're called. Pretty cool works on super rare. And this sold for almost two ETH, 1.9 ETH in September. So just another artist for us to look at here and you can get a sense of their work here. So just interesting. Always, you know, a new discovery here.
00:20:26.548 - 00:20:54.928, Speaker A: You see kind of a similar theme to that one we saw on Twitter with the space in the head. So anyways, interesting. Also very interesting here. Just a unique artist. This was retweeted by Weblinks today and Varro Gan, and I think he's been championing Vargan for a while. And anyways, I thought kind of went well with our illustrative area, part of our program here. So anyway, it's just kind of an interesting work here.
00:20:54.928 - 00:21:28.198, Speaker A: Kind of mysterious with this, what looks like a browser, right? You see the, you can always put the web. So just kind of a mysterious work here. Maybe it's on the wall, maybe this is like a digital frame. So kind of deceptive work in what's going on there. A portrait of what used to be the best month of the year, but now it's a distant, quick mess in which everything happens so fast, but one's trying to stay chill and pretend nothing is happening. So a little bit of darkness there from Varogan. Midnight in a perfect world.
00:21:28.198 - 00:21:58.522, Speaker A: This is one we missed from paper crane from a couple of weeks ago. And I thought this was a really nice, just kind of holiday work from paper Crane. So anyways, edition of 30 and let's do this. And yeah, went for actually pretty cheap for paper crane 1215. Actually. Primary sale of 470. Often paper crane is much more expensive than this.
00:21:58.522 - 00:22:24.998, Speaker A: So anyways, cool work. This is another one I found on Twitter. So a few new artists say, louie, fuzzy feeling. This is kind of going around a little bit. Editions of 400 and just a really interesting use of circles, I guess, and a little kind of like dot kind of printing sort of thing. I'm not even sure. But interesting work combined, you know, contrasting with this kind of gradients in here.
00:22:24.998 - 00:22:41.094, Speaker A: Kind of weird abstraction of people, you know, weird portrait sort of thing. Fuzzy feeling. It's good to take care. And only one left. Okay. A ton were transferred, so maybe sending them out to people. 400 editions.
00:22:41.094 - 00:23:08.934, Speaker A: Interesting. And here's some of Louis other painter, animator, comic artist. So a bit of a standout piece here, isn't it? In the sense that it kind of gets your attention. Feels like a bit of a breakthrough work. So again, one of the great things about object is how you can look at the history. And then all of a sudden, like, if I'm Louie, I'd go, hey, let's just make a series of 20 of these because this seems to have hit a nerve. New one from Jan Lucas Migone.
00:23:08.934 - 00:23:34.240, Speaker A: Bright fire, the shiny dark life collection. Is this a one of one? Let's just see what it went for. 125. So pretty respectable money there for, you know, continuing the kind of dancing skeletons vibe with some really interesting colors here as well. This is another one we missed a couple of weeks ago, I think. Let's look at the date. December 15.
00:23:34.240 - 00:24:04.050, Speaker A: Yeah. While I was gone in Canada, this is by working class. And I thought this is just pretty interesting descent to consciousness, so I didn't want to miss it. And just kind of weird, right? I mean, McDonald's and made in Microsoft paint, which is almost a genre in itself, but I'd probably categorize that as tough call. Maybe digital painting is what I'd call that. Microsoft kind of misspelled working class. I guess it's a WK.
00:24:04.050 - 00:24:36.348, Speaker A: Life is good. Someone saluting, maybe something graphic here, perhaps a plant. So just maybe a portrait with a myth hat. So a lot going on here, isn't there? I thought a really kind of cool, ambitious work. Again, it looks like this is not just making a pretty picture online. This is like, there seems to be some concepts here. You know, this is the kind of thing you'd see kind of ideas you run into with a Rauschenberg or something like that.
00:24:36.348 - 00:25:06.894, Speaker A: Right. Where you're getting different, you know, artist, reporter kind of ideas, right? Just different impressions of reality that your perceptions of reality that you're putting on the canvas. Right? So life is good descent to consciousness. So working class with the cool work. Another kind of bold work, this time from Dextere. Look at this composition, this outrageous composition. Gas station.
00:25:06.894 - 00:25:37.330, Speaker A: And I, you know, I just think, you know, making things interesting, because, again, rationally, we want to do some golden ratio things, rule of thirds type things, things. Or because you probably. Or you could even put it in the center. But I mean, this whole piece revolves around the fact that it's kind of this outrageous composition. So I thought really original, keeping things interesting. A picture where Jason is in the middle of a trip and stops at a gas station. 3000 by 1500 pixels by Dexter.
00:25:37.330 - 00:25:48.330, Speaker A: Buy for 350. I picked one up. Sean. Luke, doing very well here. Two and a half. Ethan, two point. So almost $3,000 on super rare.
00:25:48.330 - 00:26:20.034, Speaker A: And this is great, because I think he's pretty recent on super rare. So anyways, this is shadow hider. Let's see if we can make it bigger. So, again, playing with this kind of glitchy pixelation and shapes. So, again, someone that comes out of object that now is on super rare, which I think is awesome. I'm so glad that things have sort of turned out this way, because, again, it's great to just have works on both. And Ethereum, you're going to pull in a little more cash, generally speaking.
00:26:20.034 - 00:26:43.864, Speaker A: So shadowhider, doing well there. Interesting. Dimension six r 90 by six r ninets. So not huge, but you don't need to be huge in the pixel world, in pixel art world, which is. This is somewhat pixel art. Very interesting work from Kristen Roos to our travel through the mediums theme. So if you're not familiar, most of you are familiar with Kristin Roos.
00:26:43.864 - 00:27:24.116, Speaker A: This is Kristin Roose, who kind of brings almost a gallery museum sort of vibe to his work. Very experimental, sells really well. Nfts that are created with vintage software, and who, if you follow his feed, you get the sense, has a real sense of the history of digital art. So what's cool about Kristen Roose almost taking what we're seeing there in those gifts and putting them in physical form here. Hand operated jacquard weaving in process. Happy with this new experiment. I agree.
00:27:24.116 - 00:27:55.254, Speaker A: It's looking really interesting. You see the yellow is behind. So almost taking that digital ideas and putting them into physical, which I think kind of, yeah, like, I mean, it's exciting and kind of make breathes new life into physical work. Right. You know, again, works that couldn't have been made but in a digital world would never have been thought of, you might say. So cool work from Kristin Russ. Check this out.
00:27:55.254 - 00:28:24.046, Speaker A: Work by Ed Marolla. Lady in yellow dress, smoking and drinking tego tego wine. So again, deviating from the purples, interestingly. And listen to the music. Let me just turn things up a bit here. And I mean, the music really adds a lot. I mean, it's back to.
00:28:24.046 - 00:28:47.244, Speaker A: We're not just making pretty pictures here, there. These are poets that we're looking at here. Okay, so this is three minutes. So I'll let you play the rest on your own. But you can buy that work of art for five tezos, which these days is. Nair 325, $3.25 us probably.
00:28:47.244 - 00:29:09.336, Speaker A: So very keeping it interesting. Very cool work from Ed Marolla there. Continuing on bite by bit with a few. One of ones. Okay, cheap one of ones. Okay, folks, space runner Nebula's exploration 2066. And again, let's not forget, and sorry, object makes things like move to the top here.
00:29:09.336 - 00:29:48.856, Speaker A: So I can't control that. Unless Alexi has another hack for that. But we saw bite by bit, I think, yesterday, posting works from like 2002, I think, or 2003. So you can buy one of ones from an artist, a pretty cool pixel work for ten tazos, which is again, like maybe $7 750 from someone that's been going on and on. These are deceptively simple looking. So again, using one of our favorite themes here, which Kristin Rus vintage software, what I call retro tools 1988 pc paint 3.1 is being used here.
00:29:48.856 - 00:30:20.232, Speaker A: So this is part of like a, what seems to be a Sci-Fi theme. He's got some others here. I'm a huge fan of these nebulas, Cat Paws Nebula, where he'll basically take, you know, telescope images and reduce them to or turn them into pixel art and using vintage software. So very, very cool. Cat paws nebula. This one went pretty quickly. Let's see, cotton candy nebula, still available for ten, you know, so interesting.
00:30:20.232 - 00:30:51.554, Speaker A: Almost looks like a canvas underneath here. So interesting color choice. He also puts out these fake video games, something that I remember first seeing that was my first, if you go to my collection, the first work I think you'll see is from ghost shoes. Who I see is back on Twitter. She has kind of like these simulated video games, you know, video games that never existed. And you see, byte by bit is doing a similar theme here with extreme pong, copyright 2022, byte by bit. Byte by bit.
00:30:51.554 - 00:31:08.498, Speaker A: So anyways, extreme pong, a fake video game. Very cool. Mech TXT. Now, a lot of us, I think, have seen this image. I think it was his profile picture on Twitter. Or at least its profile picture here. Or at least is similar to it, not exactly like it.
00:31:08.498 - 00:31:33.094, Speaker A: And so here's a one of one. You know, I'd love to see like mech TXT has quite a fan base, I would say, from his pixel artwork. I'd be very curious to see what one of ones would go for. He had one like a month ago that kind of flew under the radar that someone got for 50 tezos. Now I think would be, you know, in the hundreds for sure. Anyway, here's a one of one. We'll see what he does with it.
00:31:33.094 - 00:31:59.664, Speaker A: And another, here's mech txt on Twitter just posting another image she was working on. So again, this nature pixelated nature always kind of looks great to me. And interesting. Almost like some nice. Almost like a medieval manuscript type look or japanese book sort of thing. Just kind of nice patterning on the side there. Let's not take shortcuts.
00:31:59.664 - 00:32:19.670, Speaker A: Friends. Indeed a few more. So I never showed this one by Tom Bombadil, but he had a couple of UFO works that I liked quite a bit. So this sold out pretty quickly. This is called run with his character with the mask there. And his character not with a mask. Interesting.
00:32:19.670 - 00:32:33.282, Speaker A: More UFo's though. Really nice gif work here. Let me just make that bigger. I love the clouds here too. So just interesting Gif work from tomorrow. Bombadil. And this one just came out yesterday, experiment.
00:32:33.282 - 00:32:56.234, Speaker A: And so you see this guy is looking, it looks like a medical device. And these guys are analyzing the brain. So just kind of interesting, kind of Sci-Fi esque works and pixel art. And with the retro game colors, nostalgic colors, reminiscent of eight bit games. So very productive there too. Now check this out. Maze in the third.
00:32:56.234 - 00:33:39.074, Speaker A: Kind of a really edgy artist, I'd argue. Now here, there's kind of a Nintendo glitch rom thing going on. But listen to the music here. Let me get this started. The music is more beautiful music again, which makes the piece. Listen to this. It sounds like beautiful Brian Eno or something, right? I mean, makes the piece, like, it's sort of like, take that, neue national galerie.
00:33:39.074 - 00:34:10.294, Speaker A: So really. And this is the name of the work. And look at this. The poetry. The poetry. Like, if anybody has any doubts that there's something going on over here, look no further, please. Set side b, the poetry.
00:34:10.294 - 00:34:28.806, Speaker A: So, anyways, I could play that on and on. Awesome work from Maison the third. Continuing on. Buy for five, by the way. Buy for five tazos. And, like, that incredible work. I just picked one up.
00:34:28.806 - 00:34:51.274, Speaker A: There's eight left. Okay, last we checked here, nobody. It's like, wasn't even barely selling this, you know, tempt. I mean, you don't want to overuse the word masterpiece here, but with that music, I mean, it's just pure poetry. Pure poetry. Speaking of which, Martin Grasser, look at this work. And maybe a lot of you have heard who he is.
00:34:51.274 - 00:35:18.990, Speaker A: Like, I never followed the generative art ever too closely, so that's a whole other area. But when I see something that really impresses me, I have to show it. And this is really impressive. So punch out. Interesting title. And so I went to his profile and everything. So I guess he works with art blocks, right? And so he's put out a series here of.
00:35:18.990 - 00:35:40.760, Speaker A: And these go for actually, quite a bit of money. And I'll show you. But here's just an example, right? So you see where this all came from. Very nice, generative art. And you see, like, look at how good it looks just on its own here. Squares number one, you know, has offers for $2,000 here. And, yeah, it's quite a few offers.
00:35:40.760 - 00:36:09.532, Speaker A: I guess the bots are out and minted for two ETH. So basically, it's kept its value, okay, because people are bidding 1.77. So, anyways, just really cool on this kind of gradient theme. Dan controlled. So he's put together, interestingly, all his other works and put it into one big work here. Buy for ten editions of 20. So you'll find all these in separate works.
00:36:09.532 - 00:36:24.388, Speaker A: I think I have a few of these for sure. And anyway, interesting work from Dan control. Still friends, still life. And 15 are left. Bye. For ten. Sometimes he burns, so you might want to go quickly.
00:36:24.388 - 00:36:44.794, Speaker A: So from that, you know. So Lorna Mills plays with taste. Okay, so that's why we have Dolly Parton doing questionable things here. Sing a song for me. Buy for 15, edition of 30. And of course, Lorna Mills has been around making gifts for, like, almost ten years. From my understanding, maybe 2014, maybe earlier.
00:36:44.794 - 00:37:20.388, Speaker A: So anyways, it's nice to see, like, artists of repute on the platform and regularly, too, not putting a drop in August during the bull market and then disappearing, which does happen from an artist who shall remain nameless, who is very famous. Venta. So we know Venta from some incredible AI work. Okay. And Venta has a new series. And to me, this looks like sampled paintbrushes, right? Where you take a sample of something and then you start painting. But I'm not exactly sure.
00:37:20.388 - 00:37:41.808, Speaker A: Like, I mean, that's what this looks like, especially at the bottom, right? And we've seen there's another artist who I was showing his instagram, who's really. He's at Knip, I think is how you g n y p in here in Berlin. He's had a show. I can't remember his name. I always forget it. Anyway, he also uses that style. This seems to be using a few different things.
00:37:41.808 - 00:37:59.086, Speaker A: Anyways, digital painting. Follow the leader from Venta. I thought it kind of reminded me in a kind of oblique way. It kind of echoes in a weird way, Les demoiselles Davignon by Picasso in the rose period. It just kind of has a weird. Just kind of echoed. It made me think that, here's another one.
00:37:59.086 - 00:38:23.834, Speaker A: Don't cry over spilt monster. And again, really edgy, the way that these arms are being drawn and everything, I just thought, really interesting work. Bad year, you know, the clouds and everything. Just interesting digital painting. One of ones went to OMG blog, who I think we just saw before on that maze in the third work. Look at this clown vampire. So interesting.
00:38:23.834 - 00:39:08.724, Speaker A: Now, if you don't remember. So this is also Venta. Okay, so we're just looking at this, and we're looking at this. Okay, now, Venta, you might remember from these awesome AI pieces, and I kind of feel like Venta had created their own thing, and I think eventa just kept going. I think these pieces would all be sold out and would be at maybe ten x or maybe not ten x, but you know what I'm saying? Like, basically, like, they still weren't selling, selling out editions of five. You can still get them. The editions of one are sold out, actually, no, you can still get this one here.
00:39:08.724 - 00:39:40.774, Speaker A: But you see, they're really going somewhere, so it'll be interesting to see if she picks it back up. I think it's a she because I really thought Venta had made a little kind of space for themselves in the AI scene. So, anyways, maybe just got tired of it, of the series, and did what she wanted to do. That happens, too. So anyways, very interesting work, as usual from Venta. Here's a couple more whelp, a one of one for 50 in the digital painting sphere. And here's almost home.
00:39:40.774 - 00:40:06.916, Speaker A: So again, almost like an Ed Marolla feel down here, interestingly. And looks like a house or a barn on fire. Or a house on fire. Interesting. Here's another AI artist who I'd never seen before, Leila Ru. Me and my character available on foundation. So I looked up her work on foundation and some pretty nice work, right? And I think this uses AI and illustration.
00:40:06.916 - 00:40:27.052, Speaker A: Let's just open AI art and sol. And so if we go back there, I think clownvamp picked that one. Yeah, sold to clownvamp. So you see these collectors. When was this? December 1. So just, it's a total addiction, and they're on a rampage here. And very nice work.
00:40:27.052 - 00:40:43.124, Speaker A: So this went for half an ETH. Nice AI work by Leila Ru. So someone else to look at here. And here's just a quick overview, quick feel. Speaking of AI. So this was just interesting. Charles was revealing some of his process.
00:40:43.124 - 00:41:14.898, Speaker A: I use a mix of mid journey Daly and stable diffusion, and sometimes Runway. Now, I've never heard of Runway, and this is also interesting. So this meta Riley was asking, like, what do you use? Which can be a sensitive question. It can be. Sometimes people will just share, as Charles AI is, thanks. And he's Matt O'Reilly says thanks. Any tips or threads for those studying or thinking, too? And this was also, I thought, really interesting.
00:41:14.898 - 00:41:49.018, Speaker A: I got here by pure trial and error. So I can't really give you any specific reference, though I'm sure you can find a lot of tutorials on YouTube. And in a sense, there are no shortcuts here. Like, if you can watch a YouTube video and then get your results, then it's probably too easy anyway. So I'll just say Charles AI says, like, basically, you have to work your way to get something that you like, and that is going to be, you know, that people appreciate. There are no shortcuts. As Mec TXT was saying, don't take shortcuts.
00:41:49.018 - 00:42:56.224, Speaker A: Another one by helix. And just to show that the market, again, something we were mentioning yesterday, an axine. I don't know if you've been to Axeen's page, but it is, like, blowing up, okay? Like, it's constant sales for, like, days, and it seems to be ramping up. So, and remember this theory I had that with xcopy kind of giving the blessing to uxine, that some Ethereum collectors might feel the need to get onto Tezos in a way that they hadn't before, especially because of Euxine's work. If you like X copy, you're going to like axine. And I have a theory, part of the reason, perhaps a speculation, that things are getting more competitive and really buzzing, I would say, on Tezos right now with sales and everything is perhaps the axin effect, because that was, or the xcopy effect from early December, you know, because it takes a while, as we discussed on the Twitter spaces, to kind of figure out what's going on on object, to kind of just understand what you're seeing. Okay.
00:42:56.224 - 00:43:21.708, Speaker A: Hopefully this show helps. So anyways, Halley X, whose work we were looking at yesterday and earlier, 14 pieces picked up by anonymous. So pretty cool. Okay, so there are. Now's a great time to be releasing art guys, because people are out there collecting, they have time off, maybe a bit of extra money, and they're going for it. New one by Mister shapeless, which was slightly different inner dialogue. Good night.
00:43:21.708 - 00:44:09.428, Speaker A: So just interesting post here. A bit of a dally feel with these small kind of figures in this landscape, vaguely dahliasque, and these beautiful clouds that Mister shapeless loves. Another one, as we wrap up here, this time from any shelf for my dream, for any shelf, for many dreams. So again, someone in a modern room, this looks, these shelves almost look like a painting in itself. But anyways, a really beautiful work. I'm pretty sure Zoom uses Dali and maybe, maybe does a few touch ups afterwards. Kind of has it when I upload works, which is one of the things you can do on Dali, it does start to give you these kind of rough, feely looks like you could almost.
00:44:09.428 - 00:44:36.146, Speaker A: It'd be interesting to make a work and then upload it to Dali and see, see the result. A new one from Ilya Shipkin. This one moves. So playing with movement here. This is an mp4, abandoned muse. And Ilya Scheepen, he uses AI and digital painting, from my understanding. So a cool one of one not for sale yet.
00:44:36.146 - 00:45:00.554, Speaker A: And here's another one that seemed to be using a few things. I mean, it's tempting when you see all this, to think it's AI mixed with painting. This is from an artist called Indi Solta. Maybe we've seen them before. Digital artists since 2004. Father I turn ugly into beauty works available on foundation. And John Roose, who we've also looked at, that's where the whole Francis Bacon episode came from.
00:45:00.554 - 00:45:45.440, Speaker A: So just posting another interesting work, I believe works physical, as you can see here, and turns them into nfts, which sell quite well, obviously a super talented artist, kind of a head turner. When I was on Twitter here, number eight by Arash, and I'd never heard of Arash before, but they have an object and a foundation and let me just see. Yeah, so cool. So physical paintings, as we wrap up here, and here's Arash's object here. So again, putting physical paintings as nfts. It's interesting when you sometimes this is controversial because some people want something that is kind of digitally native. Like myself, I have a slight bias, but I think anybody should do whatever they want.
00:45:45.440 - 00:46:12.418, Speaker A: And if people want to sell and buy, I think it's wonderful. People are making art and selling it and buying it. That's great. From my perspective, which nobody needs to share. When people start animating in it, though, I think it starts to go in more of a gray zone where it's like, oh, well, this is digitally native because without this animation, it could not exist. So, but it's kind of a gray zone. It's not a black or white clear distinction.
00:46:12.418 - 00:46:28.090, Speaker A: Here's another example of that Ducante draws. So here with an animation. So then it's like, oh, okay, this isn't just a physical NFT. Cool work. Auto portrait. Auto portrait. So self portrait in, like, French.
00:46:28.090 - 00:46:49.438, Speaker A: And then you could also say that in Italian, del Cante draws with another beautiful work. And here's a new one from Filippo, who we've also looked at in the past. This is an oil painting, cosmic scream abstract oil painting for 0.25 east. So another physical work as an NFT. And it's interesting. Filippo does physical and digital paintings.
00:46:49.438 - 00:47:11.418, Speaker A: Okay. So they kind of mix it up. And so you'll see this. I feel like we've looked at Filippo before, but it's always good to revisit. So we're getting a good feel for the scene here as we go on our journey. So thank you for joining me, dear viewer, this year and this episode, and hope you have a happy new year. A safe and happy new year.
00:47:11.418 - 00:47:13.274, Speaker A: Until next time, take care.
