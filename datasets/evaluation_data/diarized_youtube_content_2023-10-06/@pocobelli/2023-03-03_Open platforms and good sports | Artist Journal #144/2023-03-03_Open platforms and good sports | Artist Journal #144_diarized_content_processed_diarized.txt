00:00:06.320 - 00:00:38.966, Speaker A: You know what I was asking myself as I looked at this just a minute ago? This beautiful work by Marcelo Pinel is. I don't think you can paint this like you could paint it, but it's not. If I paint a picture of Hercules, is that going to excite you? But you can do it digitally and it remains kind of relevant, exciting and contemporary. Welcome back, everyone. Artist Journal, March 3, 2023. Broadcasting from Berlin, Germany. Not as sunny as yesterday.
00:00:38.966 - 00:00:56.574, Speaker A: It is not as sunny as yesterday. Newsflash. I'm going to try and make these fast. My name is Adrian Pokebelly. Welcome back, everyone. Thank you for all the comments and all the mayhem out there on Twitter and everywhere, YouTube, etcetera. Welcome back.
00:00:56.574 - 00:01:15.560, Speaker A: I hope you have your coffee. I'm trying to, once again, I want these to be like 20 minutes. That's sort of like the sweet spot for me. Thank you for the patience. In the meantime, let's see if we can make some progress on that today. Awesome work by Marcelo Pinello. Is it Pinel? I think it's Pinel.
00:01:15.560 - 00:01:47.008, Speaker A: Let me just look. Also known as cybermystic with a I on Twitter, Marcelo Pinel. So, yeah, I mean, classic, you know, extraordinarily psychedelic, unique work by Marcelo Pinel on manifold. It's actually like, not a bad price, 0.08 ETH. So maybe $120 edition of 25, only six minted. And yeah, that is the deal here.
00:01:47.008 - 00:02:58.484, Speaker A: So what do we see here? Very quickly, Hercules again. And so I come back, it's like, you know, from a contemporary art point of view, can you paint Hercules today? Like, can Richard Prince do his version of Hercules? And for lack of better term, like, the word I would start to use in my mind is it might be kind of trite, might be a little bit trite, like a little like kind of off feeling. But in this digital medium, again, I don't think this work could have been made 20 years ago. I don't think you would have had the processing power, frankly, unless you're at NASA, but you wouldn't have had the software, right? So this is a undeniably contemporary work that we're looking at here. And I would maintain that as a result of that, by virtue of that, it makes the content, it kind of reinvigorates the content. Where I want to see Hercules, I want to see more mythology. I love this kind of ancient thing done with this, you know, extraordinarily contemporary medium.
00:02:58.484 - 00:03:17.968, Speaker A: Isn't that weird? Feel free to disagree. Leave a comment if you. But again, can you paint Hercules? I'm asking myself. And I'm. You could, but I'm just not sure it would, you know, work in the same way. But you can do it this way. So anyways, really beautiful work as ever.
00:03:17.968 - 00:03:35.976, Speaker A: Look at, and this is a Hercules fighting the Hydra here. I was looking it up, the second labor. And we'll actually just take a quick look at Wikipedia. But before we do, I mean, can we zoom in here? Maybe we can. Quickly. No, this is a video, so it's a little trickier. Oh, look at that.
00:03:35.976 - 00:04:16.263, Speaker A: It's a little trickier. Maybe we can do it now. No, we can't. But I just wanted to point out the eyes here. Like, look at these awesome eyes. I mean, it's, it's truly like visionary, the experience here, you know, it's an authentically visionary experience here with even the Milky Way in the background here, almost, you know, evoking the constellations a little bit, and maybe hercules as a constellation in the sky here with these wonderful, you know, frames. So anyways, just a buffet, a rich buffet of color.
00:04:16.263 - 00:05:03.460, Speaker A: Maybe that's what I should call this video, a rich buffet of color. Just very quickly, since we like to stay on top of these things and ground ourselves in the, you know, in the tradition and in stories that, you know, that have stood the test of time. Just very quickly. It's called the lernaean hydra, or Hydra of Lerna, more often simply known as the hydra, is a serpentine water monster. In greek and roman mythology, its lair was the lake of Lerna in the argolid, which was also the site of the myth of Danaides. Lerna was reputed to be at the entrance of the underworld, and archaeology has established it as a sacred site older than the mycenaean argos. In the canonical hydro myth, the monster is killed by Heracles.
00:05:03.460 - 00:05:32.744, Speaker A: In roman mythology, Hercules as the second of his twelve labors, and so on and on. And the way they killed it, maybe you want to hear how they killed it. And then we will move on. The Hydra possessed many heads, the exact number of which varies according to the source. Actually, let me go back a line. It had poisonous breath and blood so virulent that even its scent was deadly. The Hydra possessed many heads, the exact number of which varies according to the source.
00:05:32.744 - 00:06:05.530, Speaker A: Later versions of the Hydra story add a regeneration feature to the monster. For every head chopped off, the hydra would regrow two heads. Heracles required the assistance of his nephew to cut off all of the monster's head and burn the neck using a sword of fire. So nothing too creative. There let's just burn the neck and we'll take care of business. So anyways, very cool work. Still available edition of 25 by Myrcello Pinel.
00:06:05.530 - 00:06:57.344, Speaker A: Pinel. So just very quickly, some comments yesterday, and I thought this was actually quite nice. Runtoon mentioned that he had forgotten to mention or never mentioned some of his heroes of the imagination throughout his life has been his friends and professors and artists that I know in real life. And what I love about the digital art community I am a part of today is that once again, I am surrounding myself with real people who make art and have interesting ideas that are more inspiring to me now than any of the greats with widespread recognition that we celebrate. So, you know, again, it gets like, look at Marcelo Pinel, and then it's like, okay, that's a pretty cool work. Again, something released in the last 24 hours here. We're spoiled for talent here.
00:06:57.344 - 00:07:33.412, Speaker A: And then like, you know, tell me the next time you're at the gallery in IRL and you're like blown away. Like, I mean, so, and that's not to say it can't happen, it does happen. But all to say, it's very fun to reevaluate things. And these received stories from authority as to what is important and what is not should always be questioned. And I think as artists, we kind of do that by nature. And thank you, Ariel and Antonio, for the positive feedback on the show, as well as Skomra and runetune on copyright. Yeah.
00:07:33.412 - 00:08:20.504, Speaker A: Surprised? Yeah. Germany is very strict, and I wanted to get to this part by Matthias Espinoza on this conversation of the new curation and object one platform. So Matthias Espinoza, I thought, had a really good observation here. Let's call it that. It does feel weird as a business strategy. The name is probably the issue, and I think Matthias is on to something, the name, because if they called it something completely different, this one of one platform, maybe it went, yeah, I think that might be at the core of the issue. Then it wouldn't necessarily feel like a competition of sorts or, you know, this.
00:08:20.504 - 00:08:51.746, Speaker A: So it's like OpenSea launched a one of one curated collection and featured it prominently. I think the angle is to be super rare of tezos, which I agree with. I suspect you're right, Matthias. And yeah, by definition, curation is exclusionary. Whether it's good curation or not, that's the question. And that's right. And I don't want to be anti curation or, you know, like, I think curation is, you know, it has its place right.
00:08:51.746 - 00:09:37.544, Speaker A: I mean, we have to admit that curation has its place. And, and so I think the, the issue is, you know, from yesterday, and again, I think we should all just have very open minds and really just patience. And I would say the stakes are small, but actually they're not that small when you see people making $16,000, people can buy, start to buy real estate, you know? So in a sense, the stakes aren't as small as we think. But we might think. But, yeah, I think the, the issue is this open platform ethos and then you have the one of, one platform that is not open. Right. So anyways, I don't want to make a mountain out of a molehill, as they say.
00:09:37.544 - 00:10:27.084, Speaker A: We'll come back to that. And we're actually going to look at some of the works from object one today. They're doing quite well. I mean, so, and again, we can't, you know, if I'm, I don't want people to tell me how to run my business right at the same time in this whole conversation. So I might feel a certain way or I might think, this looks, maybe this is weird, but I don't want to tell any, like, people are free to do whatever they want with their business. And that's why I always kind of preach, you know, multi chain, multi platform, multimedia. Diversification for me is kind of a solution to all of this, because then you're not relying on, you can't rely on, you have to assume that everything's going to kind of break down at a certain point and hope that it doesn't.
00:10:27.084 - 00:10:49.748, Speaker A: Quick comment from oxen. We were talking about the ad, for lack of better term. That was for the tes vending machine. I was like, oh, I wonder if Oxyn made the music. Not my music, but you're really good on reading my mind, actually working on some distorted loops on a drum machine. I'm so not surprised without knowing what to do with them. So there you go.
00:10:49.748 - 00:11:19.604, Speaker A: I wonder what the drum machine is. The conversation continues. And look at this. So the, he's actually, they've done quite well, it looks like, with the Tes vending machine. And look at this secondary sale here, 3700 tezos for this one of one here, that really cool one with the ante on top. So this sold for 3700 tezos, so. And for those that don't know, maybe that's like $4,500.
00:11:19.604 - 00:11:45.914, Speaker A: $4,500 for this one of one work. So congratulations to Axie. Very cool. And thank you for the comment, as always. Back to the object one kind of debate and just conversation. And, you know, again, I don't really, my role here in my world is to really just illuminate, put light on and just like, let's just, it's worth discussing. Right.
00:11:45.914 - 00:12:38.134, Speaker A: So let's look at what Daniel Cantor had to say. Does this new object one platform diminish the work of one by promoting that of another? And the reason I highlighted this is because I think Daniel Cantor has nailed the question. It's their debut and am staying open minded and haven't formulated an opinion either way yet. Time will tell after a few months pass and multiple different curators have done their thing. And I think that is exactly the right attitude now. I think the reason why it becomes an emotional issue, say, for we're going to look at August ground here in a second. And actually, before we go into this, this is the question, does object one diminish the work of one? Does it diminish the object itself? Which is, I think, a totally open question.
00:12:38.134 - 00:13:30.342, Speaker A: And I think you don't want to run away with that either. Again, I think we all have to be just kind of good humored about it and not, frankly, worry about and worry about our art at the end of the day. But I think that is the question as far as we look at this issue and, you know, and here, and then we'll come back to the emotional side of things in a second. But August ground, who we were looking at yesterday, who basically has been causing, asking a lot of questions about and, you know, skepticism on this whole one of, one curated platform. And the reason I think, you know, this is an emotional issue for August, which I'd argue, maybe he'd disagree with my characterization of that, but which I think a lot of us might feel. I think he's kind of speaking something that a lot of people feel, but might not feel the need to voice. Like, that's kind of where I was.
00:13:30.342 - 00:14:35.140, Speaker A: I kind of agree with a lot of what he's saying, but I'm not like, it's not really a hill I'm ready to die on, let's put it this way. But he maybe is. I think he might be. And I think it just speaks to his passion about the whole thing because, and this is the thing, this is what I'm kind of long windedly trying to get at here for so long, what feels like maybe 50 years, maybe longer. The art scene, the contemporary art scene has been this gatekept world, and it's kind of been that way, arguably for the most part until object. And what we saw is once it was just made this open platform, basically free market, where it's basically collectors can just buy what they like and then it creates its own marketplace. Once that happened, we saw, I'd argue, as I keep calling it, a cascade of creativity, cambrian explosion, as I keep calling it.
00:14:35.140 - 00:15:49.714, Speaker A: And so I think that's why it becomes kind of an emotional issue, because it's finally, it's like the masses, people who are not living in New York City, you know, people who come from countries that maybe don't have much of an art scene or small towns or whatever, all of a sudden have a legit shot at, you know, putting their work out there and just be judged according to the merit of their work on a free market with no gatekeepers. And so I think that is why it's kind of a touchy issue because it's finally been kind of broken and now it's like, oh, well, is this kind of being clawed back a tiny bit? And I think that's why there's, this is my way of kind of explaining why I think there is an emotional component to this whole side of things. But again, let's look at August ground's comment here because as, just as he says, just to be clear and lower the temperature a bit, after a lovely and in depth discussion with Kablan, one who is a curator on object, I'm more accommodating of object one. There is no us versus them. We're all, all on the same tezos team, even if I believe and speak for others about a different methodology. And. Yeah, so I think that's great.
00:15:49.714 - 00:16:17.496, Speaker A: And exactly. We, you know, there are stakes. You know, the stakes actually are surprisingly high. I tend to, you know, overly, you know, understate the stakes in my own mind of many of these things and think, well, at the end of the day, maybe this probably just doesn't mean anything anyway, but there are actual stakes here. You could argue. At the same time, you could also argue, you know, what's happened on object. It's too late.
00:16:17.496 - 00:17:17.822, Speaker A: There's already been this kind of enormous flourishing of talent that's kind of been from this whole model of a lack of gatekeeping, and it's almost too late in a weird sort of way. And that can't be undone is another way of kind of looking at the story. One more from August ground before we actually look at some of the work from object one and see what's going on over there. I believe, and I'm seeing evidence that a lot of artists on tezos have trauma from curatorial rejection or bias from the past. It makes sense that we would all collectively flinch at anything that draws lines between who is in and who is outside the gallery. We all want a voice. So, yeah, like, I mean, it's a tough thing, right? Because I think curation, I don't think should be erased in the name of everybody getting in, because we all know from a pragmatic, practical perspective is if you do open the floodgates, you're going to get a bunch of stuff that maybe, you know, isn't going to work, for lack of better term, you know.
00:17:17.822 - 00:17:56.834, Speaker A: So anyways, it's kind of a thorny, interesting issue, which is why I'm bringing it and just kind of highlighting it here. I just think it kind of, this is kind of a underlying issue that is kind of floating under this scene as well as, frankly, the contemporary art scene and art scene in general in the big picture is it kind of brings up this situation. And so anyway, yeah, let's, let's look at some of the work. It's quite interesting what's going on here. So this is the page. And they've actually had a pretty good, I'd say 24 hours here. Let me just.
00:17:56.834 - 00:18:17.496, Speaker A: They have auctions in progress. This is what I want to show, though. So the Salvador Dali picture, which we will look up close, there's a bit of 1800 tezos. So maybe like $2,300. Look at this. Zancan, a generative artist, 17,000 tezos. Like $20,000.
00:18:17.496 - 00:18:36.376, Speaker A: Let's call that. So that is impressive. Neurocolor hasn't sold, but is on sale for 25,000 tezos. So maybe $30,000 and Ezra Eslin. And this is also something I want to show, you know, who bid on this. Ezra Eslund is August ground. And I'll show you that in a second.
00:18:36.376 - 00:19:02.756, Speaker A: Here, let me show you that. So look at this. If you look here, August ground has is the bidder. So all to say, I think kind of, it's kind of an all's well that ends well. And I don't think, you know, what matters at the end of the day is your art and your process. But I understand the concern and I kind of share a lot of that. But I'm not like, again, I'm, it's not necessarily a hill I'm willing to die on.
00:19:02.756 - 00:19:58.324, Speaker A: And it kind of brings up other issues of, you know, it's their business, you know, and I think it's important, like nobody, it's the free country. You know, it's a free world, and people should be able to do whatever they want to do. If they want to start a curated platform, that's. That's okay, you know, and that's their choice. But as we're going to see with, like, a foundation and whatnot, that's a risk. And that's kind of where I was coming from, was just more kind of analytically looking at this from a business perspective and saying, you know, do they run a risk to a certain degree with what we're going to see with what's going on at foundation by kind of doing a kind of super rare model, which is arguably in the process of being disrupted by this foundation curatorial model. So are they kind of chasing after fighting the last battle to use military metaphors? Now, let's get to the work here.
00:19:58.324 - 00:20:31.452, Speaker A: Enough of my opinions on things here. Moving towards to catch a sunset in New York. So, again, this went for basically $20,000, maybe even a little more. So pretty impressive from Zancan generative art, who we showed months ago on this program, a pretty prominent artist. Here is the work by Ezra Eslint. And as you can see, basically a murder and kind of classic Ezra Eslin and having a glass of wine and a smoke after maybe murdering her boyfriend or something. A little donut there.
00:20:31.452 - 00:21:10.620, Speaker A: So, anyways, cool work. So, again, August ground a good sport, and that's kind of, I think the key for all this is just. Yeah, I think it's good that. I think it's great that August has just been a good sport, lowering the temperature a bit and just, you know, as our first commenter said, just, like, wait and see, reserving judgment. And there's no. There's no need to rush to judgment on these things. Anyway, neurocolor, I always don't want to spend so much time, but I feel like we should because it's kind of become an issue neurocolor with another really cool work here.
00:21:10.620 - 00:21:31.822, Speaker A: These are some of my favorites. Here's one by Lorna Mills. Ava atquest valet, I think is how you pronounce that veil. So just a beautiful sunset. I've never seen a Lorna Mills like this. So she brought her, you know, her, definitely her a game to this one. This is a beautiful work, a sunrise a la Lorna Mills.
00:21:31.822 - 00:21:55.070, Speaker A: Beautiful. So this is being bid on. So, I mean, and their business model is working so far. So, you know, if they're kind of achieving whatever their goals are, who, what does it matter what anybody else thinks? You know, it's kind of. It's their business at the end of the day, you know. Id, ego and superego. This is a really cool work.
00:21:55.070 - 00:22:16.676, Speaker A: This is going for 27,000. I don't even know if I've heard Omento Jovam Tez. Probably a pretty well known artist. It's pretty cool work, which is why I want to highlight it. Just kind of a cool abstract work here, I think. So anyways, not cheap. Id, ego and superego.
00:22:16.676 - 00:22:37.184, Speaker A: So pretty cool. And finally, a beautiful photograph of Salvador Dali here. This was done in 1963 with the maestro. And there's actually some cool volume here. Let me just turn it on. It's just like bugs if you can hear it. Let me just get this going.
00:22:37.184 - 00:22:58.984, Speaker A: Well, it's just like crickets and whatever. Maybe this. There we go. It's that sort of thing. Anyways, we get the picture. So there is Salvador Dali and that is going for 1800 tezos with 3 hours left to go in the auction. So anyways, they're doing well and I think that's all good.
00:22:58.984 - 00:23:41.472, Speaker A: Now, however, check this out. Pablo Puncazo. Very excited to add utopia Las Vegas by Isyev art. So we've seen Isyev art before with these really cool, kind of retro looking futuristic scenes, illustrations. And so Pablo Poncasso, who threw down the gauntlet earlier this week, basically saying out to disrupt super rare with this kind of. With these curatorial tools that are available on foundation to anybody, puts together a Punkasso world. And this is what I wanted to show you almost when a work sells on a foundation world, it disappears from the world.
00:23:41.472 - 00:24:07.628, Speaker A: Okay, so I remember there being a whole lot more works here. And look, these are about to disappear. You know, going for one and a half ETH, maybe 2500 bucks, 25 maybe. This is 3000 here at 1.8 ETH, if that's. If they're not even going to be bid more for sales of 52 ETH adding to the collection. I mean, you wonder what the sales for super rare this week have been.
00:24:07.628 - 00:24:24.197, Speaker A: You could probably look that up. I mean, it's, you know, it's probably in the same ballpark. I don't know. But then there's the sustainability. Like, will they look at this. Hodl France Charles AI sold 4.75. Ethics.
00:24:24.197 - 00:24:47.438, Speaker A: So all very interesting. And here's another one. This one's curated by Clownvamp, also on foundation. So again, like just from. And this is just me opining. This is me having a coffee with you, my friend. And my take on this is object needs to be fighting the current battle as well, like, that's just my opinion.
00:24:47.438 - 00:25:08.914, Speaker A: They can do whatever they want, but give us curatorial tools. Open it up, do it on object. You guys have object one, have your special curators. But look at what's going on here. All these black ones have bids. This is curated by clownvamp for super chief gallery, deep fake. And things are selling here.
00:25:08.914 - 00:25:37.384, Speaker A: It's working. It's working. And the curator, as far as I understand, gets a minimum of 10%. I think they determine that ahead of time. Here's that work we started with yesterday at 44 ETH, maybe $700. So anyways, look at all these bids, right? Like, to me, this is incredibly exciting. Okay, just again, it's this idea of opening.
00:25:37.384 - 00:26:06.814, Speaker A: It's this openness that is the kind of the real selling point here. Let the masses, you know, have their way, you know, let them have their say, and let's see what happens. I mean, it's pretty exciting. This was just kind of a funny thing that happened that got my attention of this to this artist. Troy Guinard. 40th bid was made by mistake. Unfortunately, it's impossible to finish the auction ahead of time.
00:26:06.814 - 00:26:30.886, Speaker A: So I'll wait till the end, return the ETH to the bidder, and get my work back and make a new auction on Monday, unless, of course, someone else decides to bid the for ETH. So just kind of a cool work. I believe it's AI and painting. Path of despair, gan assisted work. And I believe that means AI. So anyways, so here is the artist. Pretty cool.
00:26:30.886 - 00:27:06.236, Speaker A: AI works, I think, just kind of these solitude kind of landscapes here and. Yeah, sold for half an ETH. 44 40.45.4. I mean, pretty nice sales for pretty nice art. So anyways, artists exploring the true magic of AI, infusing it with my art again, that combination has always excited me and Troy Guinar. So, anyways, good sport. Here is another interesting artist that I've never seen before, multidisciplinary artist.
00:27:06.236 - 00:27:40.166, Speaker A: And this is Microsoft paint. And it looks quite beautiful, doesn't it? A study in Microsoft paint. And here's some close ups here. Let's see if we can go through it. So here's a little bit of close ups here. I mean, I think it's the grand work, which really stuns me, but here is the close up. And then again, more kind of just showing that, you know, this is not some naive scene here.
00:27:40.166 - 00:28:09.254, Speaker A: It was inspired by Picasso's sketches for this one and this beautiful sketch by Picasso, who just makes it look so easy, makes it look so, so easy. And so anyways, that inspired this work here. This very cool work. I'm not sure if it's for sale. Instagram is the link here. So who knows? Flora Marquez with some inspiration for today's drawing. So here is what looks like a monk from eastern.
00:28:09.254 - 00:28:28.774, Speaker A: It looks like an eastern sculpture. Hard to say. I don't know the source. Inspiration for today's drawing. And also Haruki Murakami on a Kindle. And to make this beautiful work here. So we see the thing, the wire coming out of the mouth with the people on top.
00:28:28.774 - 00:28:50.692, Speaker A: And then if we go back here, we'll see that here. So anyway, just really cool work. I will protect the secrets that need to be protected. Continuing with the nice colors here, these new colors. And Captain Kimmy picks up another one for 17. And now you have to buy it for 2000. Really, really nice piece.
00:28:50.692 - 00:29:09.564, Speaker A: And here's flora working with pen and paper and maybe some marker or something. And this is hilarious. Today I tried to zoom in at least three times. I think we've all been there. When we go to physical, we want to like zoom from time to time. I go back to paper so as not to lose the habit. Probably a smart move.
00:29:09.564 - 00:29:34.374, Speaker A: And some other illustrations. This time from Daniel W. One daily mess a day keeps the creative blocks away. So similar idea. And so here are just almost like a maze of people here from Daniel W. And here is another one with different people and different pattern. There are four of these and daily mess number three.
00:29:34.374 - 00:29:56.634, Speaker A: So just cool experimentation here. And finally, and these are all different. And again, these would all just, they almost look like physical work, but they are not as far as I understand. I think they're digital. They definitely have a physical feeling, though, when you look in here. So anyways, interesting. 3000 by 3000 png.
00:29:56.634 - 00:30:22.130, Speaker A: And what do we have here? Well, I'll show you this. This kind of can. I don't know, I guess it confused me. The collection consists of nine interconnected canvases, unlockable prints, details to follow. The auctions will go live on Wednesday, March 8, with pieces open to offers until then. So I just thought they were good looking abstracts here. And just interesting digital mark making.
00:30:22.130 - 00:30:46.858, Speaker A: And here is the foundation for this artist. NW 123 new works January to March 2023. So here are the works. And I guess they're interconnected. Maybe they make a big one because it looks like this corner maybe goes on that corner and this stroke kind of goes to that stroke. So anyway, just more interesting experimentation. Santiago drying.
00:30:46.858 - 00:31:21.764, Speaker A: But I'll stop now and go to the gas station. So I'm glad Santiago's car is working again. I tell you, when I had a car, you're always waiting for that shoe to drop on. You're going to need to repair something, and it's going to cost you $2,000. So, anyway, glad things are running. And here's just some work in progress in GimP was kind of trademark Santiago line work. And here is a painting by Santiago, a digital painting, PNG inkscape from physical work, edited on gimp previously, too.
00:31:21.764 - 00:31:43.116, Speaker A: So just kind of a cool abstract again, in what's become a trademark style. And here are some other works that seem to kind of fit with Santiago's nzfs. This could kind of hang in the same show. Hey. Edition of ten for five tezos. So just kind of interesting experimentation. Kind of abstract.
00:31:43.116 - 00:32:04.088, Speaker A: Here's another one that's kind of pixelated. So interesting. Entremado de bamboo. And here is another one. So again, kind of reminiscent of San Diego's work. Slightly different, you know, process here with these squares in the background. So anyways, just kind of interesting.
00:32:04.088 - 00:32:36.954, Speaker A: Here's another artist that I've never seen before, Kazuhiro Ihara. And this would kind of fit with some of the other works we've been looking at in the abstraction, in the kind of glitch, abstraction area. So kind of interesting. Hey, so just pretty cool edition of twelve buy for 29. And this is on primary, so not cheap on primary, but they are selling, so people enjoy them as well. Here's Kazuhiro Ihara's. Give him a follow.
00:32:36.954 - 00:32:57.024, Speaker A: Never die before going to outer space. And so here's some of the work here. So, anyways, always a new discovery out here. And also an interesting Twitter discovery here of birds flying through the air. But then their trajectories are abstracted. So that's kind of cool. Some audio.
00:32:57.024 - 00:33:18.116, Speaker A: It's pretty cool. Cool, fun, creative and interesting. Looks like it's doing pretty well. Quite a few retweets and views here. 50 birds flocking. Yoshida yoshi soda. Yoshi soda.
00:33:18.116 - 00:33:35.544, Speaker A: And exmortal. A few more. This one looks abstract. So some glitch work here from xmortal. And we have another one that we missed, again, using hardware, video synths and glitchgear. Here's another one. Better living through mechanization.
00:33:35.544 - 00:34:02.594, Speaker A: I mean, the fact that it comes from hardware kind of makes it extra exciting, you know? And. Yeah, like video created and captured in real time on February 25, 2023, using all hardware modular video synthesizers. You wonder. I guess he's using a video camera to capture it, but pretty interesting. And here's one we missed that. I quite liked, hot tube. So an old tv.
00:34:02.594 - 00:34:37.704, Speaker A: And again, it's an interesting trope, the whole taking a retro piece of technology like a tube tv and then putting it in a, you know, 360 like we see it with the floppy disk. I mean, I think a Haiti rocket and I think of, you know, Kurt Hussle collective and others. Anyways, interesting. LB, also a glitch artist with a couple of stills that I thought were quite nice and beautiful colors here that worked out quite well. Still 26 and still 25. Buy for two, edition of five. So pretty reasonably priced there.
00:34:37.704 - 00:35:03.486, Speaker A: Buy it for a song. And Skye Goodman strapped four fifth sector highs, so it almost looked like ski boots or something. Anyways, pretty cool work here. Exporting a lot from Sky Goodman with beautiful colors and the beautiful shoes, as usual. And there was another one that he gifted to collectors. Thank you, sky, for this work. I got one and it's.
00:35:03.486 - 00:35:36.314, Speaker A: It's pretty awesome. And what was the title? Silver mids with 3d printed souls. Again, these works are just waiting to be 3d printed, some of them even just to feed this, if you could even make a file that could create one of these. Anyways, very interesting as ever. And beautiful. So Ilya Scheepen is working with super chief gallery Nikita and Rurutu for doppelganger. And Ilya Schpin usually uses AI.
00:35:36.314 - 00:36:04.650, Speaker A: Yeah, you see it here, AI and painting in combination. Looks like it may be part of that maif, that deepfake show, maybe, perhaps. So anyways, just an interesting work here. Doppelganger and Venta, target practice. Almost going back to the greek mythology here with a centaur shooting an arrow out. And again, the sampled brushes. Very nice treatment in here.
00:36:04.650 - 00:36:27.760, Speaker A: And I actually really like this too, how it's just kind of masked and so all sorts of creativity here. And it's quite beautiful, isn't it? And even the sun, almost like a kid drawing, but with these sampled brushes. Target practice. And we're running through it here at the end. Yoain, Miro, pink officer. So slightly different. So maybe this explains it.
00:36:27.760 - 00:36:54.942, Speaker A: A collaborative effort between the artists atozechs, Yoain and Indie, utilizing AI art tools and some minimal post processing in Photoshop. So that's why it looks different. It is a collaboration between these three artists. So anyways, you can see Joa's stamp on this. I'm not familiar with the other artists. I don't think we can look super quickly, super duper quickly. Icelandic artist.
00:36:54.942 - 00:37:10.804, Speaker A: Yeah. So here is Indi Sulta. And here is etozek. So some other artists who use AI. Interesting, very interesting. Tokyo rush hour. And finally, Kaylee van Fossen, becoming a muse.
00:37:10.804 - 00:37:42.038, Speaker A: Just saw this on Twitter, a one of one, and just thought it was an interesting, nice work. And composition here went for 150 to clownvamp, who is the rampage? Continues. Artificial memory twelve. We've been looking at these images of the week, which I believe is using previous collages and then processed basically through AI to make these kind of gorgeous compositions here. So very cool. Let's just see what these go for. Five tezos each.
00:37:42.038 - 00:38:18.034, Speaker A: So pretty reasonable, isn't it? And another one, quantum spirit, with another interesting AI artwork. Again, you'd never make these on your own without AI, would you? So interesting kind of rainbow piece. And Robnis V 255 Tezos, where he combines the Buddha and a. Is it a totor that they call him the trash can? So keeping with the trash art, quite like the green frame there. Meditation on the flow of refuse. 55 tezos at auction here. 18 hours to go.
00:38:18.034 - 00:38:33.700, Speaker A: It'll be interesting to see what that goes for. Here's just an interesting artist I don't think I've seen before. Joey Mano. This looks like physical. I thought it was just kind of original abstraction here. It looks like physical work, but you actually never know. This could be AI, too.
00:38:33.700 - 00:38:52.264, Speaker A: It's actually hard to tell. This could be AI. And I didn't see any. I didn't see any clue as to how it was made. Multidisciplinary artist, abstract artist based in Indonesia. So there does seem to be texture, but it's hard to say. It could be AI, too.
00:38:52.264 - 00:39:05.592, Speaker A: I'm not sure. And finally. I don't think we looked at this yesterday. Every influencer becomes one. I meant to look at it if we already looked at it. Yeah, I don't think we've looked at it. Kind of liked it.
00:39:05.592 - 00:39:27.692, Speaker A: Quite liked it, actually. And the word smooth is repeated here. So the physical work by die with the most likes continues. I think he's getting better and better. I think that's what I see. And I even love just like, this irrational element with just. Let's just paint a yellow stripe across and then also the smoothing out of the influencer.
00:39:27.692 - 00:39:42.684, Speaker A: Right. Over time and everything, you know, the refining of the image here. So, anyways, cool work from die with the most likes. That's your show, everyone. Enjoy your weekends, and thank you.
