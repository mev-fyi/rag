00:00:06.360 - 00:00:33.174, Speaker A: Well, I mentioned this at the beginning of the Twitter spaces yesterday, and I mention it again, this work is gone. The sale has ended. But there are more ways to give to our friends out in Turkey and Syria. The images are heart wrenching. So welcome back, everyone. Artist journal, February 9, 2023. Broadcasting to the world from Berlin, Germany.
00:00:33.174 - 00:01:05.164, Speaker A: And, yeah, you probably know who this is. This is axin with a. You know, I almost hesitate to talk about the art here. I almost hesitate to talk about the art because of the nature of the situation. But let me just say this. You see, frankly, what a master communicator, axing is a visual community. A master visual communicator.
00:01:05.164 - 00:01:42.874, Speaker A: And, yeah, so that being said, let's look at what happened here. So this work is called aid, and it was created to help and support people in the earthquake region. All proceeds will be sent to nonprofit organization ah Bop. Yeah, so anyway, there are a lot of ways to give, and I mentioned it at the start of the Twitter spaces, but of course, people are still filing in. So unfortunately, this one is gone. And look at how much money oxine raised here. 567 times zero three.
00:01:42.874 - 00:02:09.134, Speaker A: That looks like maybe 16 ETH. So more than $20,000 if my math is on target here. So nice work from uxine here. And here's another one. Here's a way you can donate, actually, this is from popple Palm pilot wallpaper, Tezquake aid. So this is another way you can find ways to give. Again, the images are heart wrenching.
00:02:09.134 - 00:02:35.724, Speaker A: And earthquakes are a strange news event in the sense that sometimes they take a little bit of time to register is sort of my experience. And then the. Because of the enormity of the damage and because it's not from, you know, an act of violence from people against people, it's a natural occurrence. So it's kind of its own. You know, it's like a tsunami. It's like everything and that. But the tragedy is real.
00:02:35.724 - 00:03:06.746, Speaker A: So you can help out with money. And this is a pretty cool thing that he did, that popple did here. You can either contribute a tezos, or you can contribute to Tezos or five or ten. So that is really cool. And this, of course, is going to help further relief in Turkey and the Syria earthquake. So shout out to popple and uxine and blue retina here. Finally, GM fam hope is all we need.
00:03:06.746 - 00:03:43.188, Speaker A: I want to share below some great art and turkish artist friends who will donate all the income from their mints for Turkey earthquake victims to official organizations. I'll be adding to this thread as much as I can. Even sharing is help. So blue retina here, I've retweeted this and so you can find that on my feed and you can find all the different ways you can give. And I think it's actually a beautiful way to kind of loosen the purse strings. I mean, picking up an auxine for, you know, I guess it's $50 sure makes it a lot easier. You know, it just kind of psychologically it's great.
00:03:43.188 - 00:04:16.684, Speaker A: And so you see the power of open editions still, you know, and so I don't think the that chapter is over. And again, it's tempting to just see it as a fixture in the digital art space that we are so fond of here. So anyways, check that out and do what you can to support. Thank you to Kappn. I got a gift, I got a few gifts and we're going to go through them really quickly here. Birthday cupcake from Capn. What an awesome surprise here.
00:04:16.684 - 00:04:34.572, Speaker A: A one of one and was hilarious because my girlfriend made cupcakes for me and they didn't look that dissimilar to this. So that is awesome. So thank you, kappin. A beautiful gift here and unexpected here. Let me just make it bigger. There you go. So, and with that great background and I'm a huge fan of that series.
00:04:34.572 - 00:04:57.744, Speaker A: And also ilay with a beautiful one of one AI another prism sky. So thanks, guys. It's deeply appreciated. And again, makes me feel special featured on Adrian Pokebelly artist journal number 100 720 9 December 2022. So I guess I showed this way back when. So full circle here. Full circle.
00:04:57.744 - 00:05:17.504, Speaker A: A one of one. Yeah, the first. Wow. Okay. So I mean, again, and thank you to runetune for this spaced out guy having a summer treat here. And, you know, we didn't talk enough about Runetune's art yesterday, but luckily he's on weekly on the Twitter spaces. And big shout out to everybody who came out.
00:05:17.504 - 00:05:59.614, Speaker A: And because I'd like to talk more about Runetoon's art and again, and he's just so helpful and just a great conversationalist. So again, it's thrilling to be able to do that weekly. So hopefully next week we can talk a little bit more about, about what Runetune is up to. And finally, Santa Claus, I think, also known as Nikupi on Twitter, if I remember right, with a portrait of Terence McKenna, which done within the JavaScript sort of generative art style. And I didn't see it at first, but then of course, of course, of course, there is Terence. And very quickly here, the write up was actually pretty cool. The truth.
00:05:59.614 - 00:06:45.454, Speaker A: And of course, you know, Terence McKenna, for those that might not know, he was the basically the big psychedelic mushroom philosopher of the 1990s who really got famous. He was already famous in the counterculture before. I only learned about him from a book called the Archaic Revival, which was a collection of essays, you know, and with works like talking about the voynich manuscript and so many great essays in there. And so, yeah, I mean, I consider Terence McKenna, like, I don't know if academia has embraced him yet. I'm sure there must be references, but I consider him. I call him the most imaginative philosopher of the 20th century. And he did die, I think, right on at 2000 there.
00:06:45.454 - 00:07:11.894, Speaker A: But he was definitely, like, unquestionably in my mind, he was the most imaginative and, you know, a brilliant, brilliant. Just new territory, tons of new territory, really delivered the good. So let's just see what he has to say here. Here's a quick quote. The real truth that dare not speak itself is that no one is in control. Absolutely no one. And, you know, I have a line.
00:07:11.894 - 00:07:36.840, Speaker A: It's sort of like the only thing more terrifying that people. That there is some sort of conspiracy and that people are in control is that nobody's in control. That's the. That's the most terrifying thing of all, I would argue. So a similar thought here. I probably got it from listening to Terence. Terence McKenna was an american author, ethnobotanist.
00:07:36.840 - 00:07:57.904, Speaker A: You guys can read that. The Timothy Leary of the nineties. Terence was a true philosopher indeed. It'll be interesting. You know, scholarship was pretty late to the party with JG Ballard. I imagine it's going to be the same thing with Terence. I mean, it's probably already started, but I don't know, you know, so it'll be interesting to see.
00:07:57.904 - 00:08:31.348, Speaker A: And finally a quote. This is a famous one. You want to reclaim your mind and get it out of the hand of the cultural engineers who want to turn you into a half baked moron, consuming all this trash that's being manufactured out of the bones of a dying world. He was a massive influence on me because of his ability, his ability for speech and just his imagination. Right up there with Ballard. One bit portrait made with JavaScript cellular automata in P five J's huge file. So anyways, thanks, guys.
00:08:31.348 - 00:08:51.704, Speaker A: Totally awesome. And a big shout out. These were a couple of people that showed up on the spaces yesterday. Ladice Silvera, thank you for calling in from Brazil. And I didn't get everybody but I got a couple of people here and can't. Here is a work black or white series playing with gender. Actually, I think it's quite brilliant.
00:08:51.704 - 00:09:21.216, Speaker A: Just kind of highlighting in these everyday situations the aspects of gender that may not be highlighted of this guy just standing at a table there. So I think kind of fun and pretty interesting. So anyway, shout out to Kant, Lediche and everybody who spoke yesterday. Again, great opportunity. I think 120 people, last I checked, listened. There's maybe 50 in the space, and people listen after. And it's going to go on Spotify.
00:09:21.216 - 00:09:59.574, Speaker A: I'm going to start uploading today, actually pieces and further just on that point, I'm also going to be starting to put out short form content based on the spaces. So if you put out some killer quote that could end up on who knows where, but just as sound bites all over the place. So a nice opportunity to share your thoughts and get out there. Another kind of interesting community note, Mikey Wilson put out this piece. This too shall pass. And so kind of a mysterious work. I just saw this on Twitter and kind of a cutoff shoe of vans.
00:09:59.574 - 00:10:23.348, Speaker A: And we'll go through this quickly. We're already ten minutes in here, but this is. I wanted to cover this. It's that kind of episode today, guys. I spent the entirety of 2016 in Montgomery county correctional Facility. And again, most people know Mikey Wilson as one of the most generous, giving people on the Tezos platform. He is a mega collector.
00:10:23.348 - 00:10:53.036, Speaker A: Okay. Not long into my time. So due to driving while high, not long into my time there, I got in trouble and had to kick heroin while serving 30 days in the hole. I wrote this on my sneaker to remind me that one day I would be free again. This, too, shall pass. Then I found out that my father was dying and he passed away before I was released. Yeah, a heartbreaking, heartbreaking story here.
00:10:53.036 - 00:11:22.996, Speaker A: Heartbreak doesn't begin to describe the pain I was in. I kept my eye in mind on these words. No matter how bad or good things seem, there but fleeting moments that will eventually pass. So again, we see the. This is in my universe, this is real art. This is one of the main functions of art, you know, for expressing these kind of things. And so this, too, shall pass.
00:11:22.996 - 00:11:44.010, Speaker A: And it's a, you know, important, wise reminder that enjoy the good times because they may not last. So. And also the bad times. As Oxine says, if you're in hell, keep walking. This, too, shall pass. So, interesting wisdom from the. From the scene here, guys, check these out.
00:11:44.010 - 00:12:02.326, Speaker A: So Kristen Roose, traveling through the mediums he is. I don't know if you'd call it knitting, but we were looking at earlier images. Maybe he has what he weaving. These are starting to come together. These are the first of my weavings to be stretched in frame. So. And here's another one here.
00:12:02.326 - 00:12:31.502, Speaker A: I mean, so we were looking at these being created. Right in previous episodes. I didn't clue in, in my brain that he would mount these on stretcher bars. And then. And it really, I think, brings up some really interesting questions, because he's not only is he not painting on canvas, but he literally is creating his own canvas and making the art out of the canvas. And it looks stunning. Okay.
00:12:31.502 - 00:12:56.534, Speaker A: Like, look at that. So just really, really cool. You can see why he has such a, you know, loyal collector base. And this looks great. Again, traveling through the mediums, we saw it with axine, scanning from that zine and then using that as, like, the laser somewhere. So you just see how powerful it is. And so, anyways, stunning.
00:12:56.534 - 00:13:22.622, Speaker A: You almost see in the. Like, it's stunning. Like, even the threading and everything, it looks like he made it himself. So just super duper cool. Another testament to the richness and the depth of this scene here. Continuing on, the master of psychedelic abstraction, as I like to call him, acid boy in the house portal. And here it is.
00:13:22.622 - 00:13:39.772, Speaker A: I believe this is on tezos. And I'm telling you, like, I think this is for 650 tezos. This one of one. I feel like it was like three or four months ago. You could get an acid boy for 25 tazos. Maybe it was four or five months ago. I think I picked up a couple.
00:13:39.772 - 00:14:08.842, Speaker A: Now they're going for 650, so. And it makes sense. I mean, he's selling on super rare regularly, so it's great to see. And just more really attractive, cool, psychedelic abstraction from the masta. The masta acid boy. So continuing on Tuks with a nice one here. So he was doing a lot of AI abstraction, and we can see it here.
00:14:08.842 - 00:14:24.462, Speaker A: I assume this is AI. It looks like he's continued the theme. Let's see if he put any information here. May your children know the truth. Let them shine like the brightest star. So no details on the actual creation of the work. And I didn't see it minted, but it may be out there somewhere.
00:14:24.462 - 00:15:03.554, Speaker A: Anyway, I thought, pretty attractive and interesting. And look at MCH X, released just yesterday, another one of these color field paintings, digital spring one. And look at how gorgeous this is again, like, this looks like a museum here today, guys. I mean, it's like your daily walk through your digital art museum here. And what's incredible is, like, again, this is all released in the last 48 hours. So the fundamentals of this scene continue to dazzle, frankly, at least me, on a. Enough to make these videos on an almost daily basis.
00:15:03.554 - 00:15:30.074, Speaker A: Here, look at Felix Le Peindre. Some, you know, again, what I would consider gallery like experimentation. And you're going, Adrian, that's a. A blue square. What's the big deal? Check it out. Blue haze. I upscaled one pixel of hashtag zero zero five af zero, so hexadecimal to 7776 by 7776 to see what happens.
00:15:30.074 - 00:16:05.488, Speaker A: Topaz Gigapixel AI created some interesting artifacts to it as the software tries to fill in missing information. Feels like a layer of fog blurring its source. Again, I would say this is pretty sophisticated experimentation, and you might not be able to see it, but I think if you look here, I made it large. So here is a very close up version. And you can see on over here, it's darker. It's darker on the left, and there's just like, as I scroll through it, you can start to see, like, almost this fog that he's talking about. So fascinating.
00:16:05.488 - 00:16:38.072, Speaker A: I'm kind of back to this qualitative science idea. Like, to me, this is. This is science without number, although you could theoretically attribute number to it by measuring the hexadecimal of each, you know, pixel in here and then, you know, seeing the variation and whatnot. But nevertheless, you know, what I'd consider almost like, you know, quasi scientific and maybe it's not even, you know, investigation here. Exploration. So just super cool from Felix Lipandre. So that is cool.
00:16:38.072 - 00:17:08.266, Speaker A: And look at this more fascinating abstraction here. Good morning from feels and just really cool. And just a beautiful, beautiful texture here. So it all continues to happen. And here's some more abstraction, another one from Cato for only a tezos here, and some beautiful colors. And I believe that this looks like almost a yellowish cream gray in the background, which works so nicely and complements these beautiful gradients here. And kind of op art.
00:17:08.266 - 00:17:34.704, Speaker A: Again, feeling from Cato. Another one from Koda Nakazono, who continues with his abstraction here. So, again, you can see, like, again, this is the last 48 hours. You can put together an abstract show, a digital art abstraction, you could say digital art abstraction. Now there's your show and use works from the last, like, 48 hours. Here's another one. Kit Balo.
00:17:34.704 - 00:18:00.932, Speaker A: I can't make this bigger, at least not right now. I just stop it when I click on it. But anyways, kind of an interesting, again, interesting work, I guess. You see a computer repeated over here playing with patterning, almost looks like a windows 95 type desktop with a lot of dithering and gradients flowing through it. And of course, detour. A mirage number 3850. And.
00:18:00.932 - 00:18:15.704, Speaker A: And this is an edition of eleven buy for ten. So more cool work from Datura. Look at that sun. I assume that's a sun mirage. Yeah, and it's beautiful. Great title too. And look at all this movement here.
00:18:15.704 - 00:18:58.474, Speaker A: Kurt Hussle Collective, they have another work on manifold. So that is on Ethereum limited edition of ten for 01997. And just an interesting video here again at that digital art, the genres of digital art show. Kurt Hussle Collective, I have to say, was a fan favorite there, those early commercials. And so anyways, some new work from Kurt Hussle Collective. And also another one with their kind of trademark humor, the Hustle Bay upload download to and from the Hustle bay brought to you by Kurt Hussle Collective. So again, it just feels like a gallery in here today.
00:18:58.474 - 00:19:17.958, Speaker A: Continuing on, a new guy who I've never heard of till now. I feel like maybe I should have heard of mental barf, but a memorable name. And there he is. Let it burn to rise up through the ashes. Mental barf 2023. This job has worked zero days without getting burned. So interesting.
00:19:17.958 - 00:19:37.404, Speaker A: And maybe some references to the open editions here, maybe a security guy and the world is on fire, but making. But he's looking at his open editions here, maybe. So anyways, edition of 15, buy for 50. So that is on secondary. So popular. Look at this. Bezaya on foundation.
00:19:37.404 - 00:20:12.476, Speaker A: So Bezaya is all over the place here. He's on super rare, he's on foundation, he's on object. So check this out and die with the most likes. Has placed a bid, has met the reserve of 0.1. Now Legojo is coming in for the Pamela Anderson reference, the Baywatch reference. A famous, you know, character, I guess, from the eighties and late eighties, early nineties, I would guess. I mean, I remember Baywatch when I was like twelve or 13 with kind of characteristic bzaya, Chanel, Paris and supreme.
00:20:12.476 - 00:20:44.566, Speaker A: And then putting on the. Is this Louis Vuitton patterning? I'm back to strange thing and that patterning. So anyways, cool work and it's popular here. It's on, bidded on right away by some stars in the ecosystem. Varya was just kind of an interesting work. We've been following Varya, so I thought this was just an interesting development because Varya does a lot of AI and then the sampled brush work. And so I thought this was just interesting to see the variation here.
00:20:44.566 - 00:21:18.544, Speaker A: Good morning, everyone. New new drop on World of V art, which I haven't heard of before. World of V NFT marketplace. So maybe that's a new one on ve chain I'm trying to think of, what with zero gas fees, green nfTs. I'm not sure what blockchain that is. Ve almost looks like Aave or something, but they don't have their own blockchain, as far as I know. RJ with a new one on objects still available for a tezos just kind of snuck in there.
00:21:18.544 - 00:21:51.964, Speaker A: What I liked about this, there's a lot of. I love RJ, as you know. And what I liked about this was a couple of things. First, the dirty screen here, or what seems to be a dirty screen, but maybe that's just a reflection. And the other was the reversal he turned. Usually it's the screensaver that is the star, the movement here, but instead it's the outdoors. So it's kind of been reversed where the external world is the thing in movement and changing, and the computer remains the same.
00:21:51.964 - 00:22:16.384, Speaker A: Gmgn. The days pass. So again, just a real poetic artist in my view. G shadow burned. So I've never heard of g before either. So we're bringing in the new artists here and kind of a ghost like figure, some digital painting at a gas station. And the gas station has Instagram and Twitter on it and some interesting textures here.
00:22:16.384 - 00:22:57.040, Speaker A: So anyways, interesting artists, let's just quickly bring up their page. So, yeah, so new on the scene here. Fail. Another failed artist. Okay, well, it makes you wonder, you know, does that have anything to do with our other failed artist? Is that a clue? And so anyways, interesting Padrino with his second work here, untitled Self Portrait, and with the glorious apple iie that my mom will recognize and I will recognize, our first computer and untitled self Portrait 2016. Rip. Sometimes things stay burned into your retro retina from different moments in your life.
00:22:57.040 - 00:23:25.410, Speaker A: So another, you know, kind of. It's that kind of day out here, guys. It's not all sunshine and rainbows out here. So sometimes regret bleeds down into your eyes as you look on to what you have sown behind in your life. Untitled self portrait is a digital painting series that examines the inner and outer self and the things that stay burned in our minds over time. It is a series of portraits painted by me, of my friends, peers, and those who have an impact on my development as a digital artist. Buy for 338 on secondary.
00:23:25.410 - 00:23:53.138, Speaker A: It is sold out on primary editions of 37, so he's doing great here. So another self portrait. And that, my friends, looks like Mikey Wilson, the guy with the van shoe at the beginning, I believe. Now I'm not positive on that. So maybe a response to the other one, to Mikey's work, I'm not sure, but just kind of interesting. I think they could hang together, that's for sure. Deadman with toaster.
00:23:53.138 - 00:24:11.630, Speaker A: And of course this used to be Trezor Rodanx. So with a Microsoft paint kind of digital oil painting, stuffing pizza and chicken into a burning toaster here. So all sorts of mayhem here. Let's see what he does next. Let's see what he does next. One of one at auction for four. Let's see how much time is left.
00:24:11.630 - 00:24:54.650, Speaker A: There are only 4 hours remaining, so you may be able to sneak in and get that one for a song. Edmarrola this feels like it complements the painter nicely. Now we have the writer, and I believe this was a one of one that sold for 55. So I thought it was quite cool and just, you know, that kind of profound, almost ancient, mysterious quality that Ed's work has. And shout out to Ed who couldn't make it to the spaces but wanted to. I'm not sure if it just doesn't fit his schedule, but it would be awesome. I'd love to change the schedule to accommodate people here and there, but then I think people won't know when it's on, so I just kind of religiously stay to that.
00:24:54.650 - 00:25:14.058, Speaker A: 09:30 a.m. Eastern standard time. It's not perfect for everyone, but it seems like a balance. So anyways, hopefully Ed Morolla can make it out sometime. Rustic digital art. Forest Gump so this is another addition to the cloud period series. This one moves interestingly.
00:25:14.058 - 00:25:48.830, Speaker A: And you know, as I'm not super movie literate and I have not seen Forrest Gump, I know there's something about running so I don't know the reference other than that it's about Forrest Gump and that something to do with running. But I'm sure everybody that's seen that movie will understand it far better than I. This is available for 18 tezos on secondary, so sold out on primary, so more interesting work from rustic digital art. Shout out. Thank you for the birthday wishes. This is an interesting new artist that I'd never seen before. Nyx nicosis.
00:25:48.830 - 00:26:32.348, Speaker A: Now this is the last minted work and again just posted on twitter, you know, here was my last minted work of 2022 and so that's how I found it. So here I am talking about it, you know, here we like looking at it and finding out more. So I thought it was actually a stunning work. So I'm kind of back to this idea of how worthwhile it is to just post your work on a regular basis because you're just going to get more people knowing about your work and checking it out, you know. So here's just some very beautiful, you know, beautiful. Is this a digital painting illustration, you know, and so a JPEG fairly large with a poem. So interesting and for available for 0.11
00:26:32.348 - 00:26:50.564, Speaker A: east. So interesting and original. And here's some of their other work. So anyways, just kind of interesting here. Here's some movement and see them develop and some are selling quarter of an ETH here. So 0.15 ETH.
00:26:50.564 - 00:27:59.512, Speaker A: So anyways, it's always worth it to keep putting your art out there. And again, I say that as much to myself, maybe more than anybody, continuing on, another artist that I don't think I've seen before, Mohammed Rnft GM and I thought this was quite stunning. It reminds me of a lot of that patterning that you'll see in middle eastern art from like the 700s because the reason why they have a lot of pattern is because I believe it was against Islam to represent icons, as far as I understand, and correct me if I'm wrong because I'm not an expert, but there's a great, at the Pergamon, there's a great islamic art section and it's all patterns. Like there's no representation that I remember because you weren't allowed to show icons. So it was all this really elaborate patterning. So the reason I mentioned that is because in the background you can kind of see an echo of that patterning. And so here you have it and then some representation on top, a beautiful contrast and very interesting post office.
00:27:59.512 - 00:28:38.244, Speaker A: Nft so this was again something that was posted. It was an older work, you see it's way down here and he's released a bunch since. So 21 years of experience in visual arts. So anyways, an interesting artist and there it is on foundation again, which continues to collect these artists because there is no gate on foundation. So I just think it's great. And like what's cool about foundation is it retains its collectability. It's not this, it's not like, you know, just open platform where you don't feel like it's collectible because the platform actually does matter, as we know.
00:28:38.244 - 00:29:14.694, Speaker A: Right. So anyways, cool work from Mohammad Rastami. And here we go. Going into some pixel art here, byte by bit with a landscape. And I kind of like just the simplicity of this, just the different, you know, dithering densities, I guess you'd say, dithering sizes, densities here in a landscape, and then white and black for the actual land, and then just a kind of a blue, straight up web blue sky in the. In the sky. So, Pixeland 4004, again, pc paint 3.1,
00:29:14.694 - 00:29:55.870, Speaker A: that might have supposed to been in the pixel art section, but we're going to move on here, boo boy, with a cool illustration, again, referencing what we saw with mental barf. These open editions here, it's over for fundraising to help the earthquake plan total sales. So it looks like this was also related to fundraising for the earthquake. So anyways, cool work from Buboy. And again, these open editions, I think are awesome for exactly for this purpose. And again, like, Euxine raised like $20,000 in, you know, a couple of days. Lewis Osborne with a new work here.
00:29:55.870 - 00:30:26.588, Speaker A: This just got minted. And very nice work here where the color, when the bouncing ball head hits the underlying, you know, structure, color is inserted. So. And of course, his typical classic colors, his trademark colors is what I'm trying to say here. So very cool work from Louis Osborne, edition of 16. Nice and low. And this looks like it's an mp4, if I am not mistaken here.
00:30:26.588 - 00:30:47.364, Speaker A: Yes, mp4. So cool. And I thought I'd bring up Lewis Osborne's. We didn't see this work here. This is from on super rare from January 14, endless cycle. And let me just see if there's sound. There is no sound, but you see a person kind of this portrait of daily life here.
00:30:47.364 - 00:31:23.916, Speaker A: So again, art we can relate to, you know, and. Yeah, so just going through your routine here, again, this makes me incredibly bullish on this scene when I see this kind of thing, you know, it's just, again, art that you can relate to. So fascinating. Did this sell? It did for one ETH. So, endless cycle. Tomorrow is another day by Lewis Osborne on super rare. Another piece we've looked at Ilio Gible before, I believe a tribute to all the artists who play beautifully every game.
00:31:23.916 - 00:31:45.020, Speaker A: So a pretty cool work here. Another nice illustration and kind of semi abstract. You know, you see a shoe here, but kind of stretched out. So this looks like a body, but repeated. This looks like a soccer ball, but then there's a weird background. The shadow doesn't continue. And so what's going on? Current bid, 0.15
00:31:45.020 - 00:32:02.838, Speaker A: ETH. So again, you just got to be happy about this. The market is strong here. And continuing on, how are we doing? Pretty good. So. So we've looked at flusty tenarum before. And again, they just posted a GM on Twitter, probably of a previous work.
00:32:02.838 - 00:32:27.866, Speaker A: And we've looked at their page before. And look at this stunning frame here. So again, it's always worth posting your work, because I don't recollect seeing this, even though we probably did look at this before. And here's a semi robotic guy and a UFO on the moon, let's say, in the earth on fire. And this gorgeous multicolored starred sky. So hope beautiful. That's what we need today.
00:32:27.866 - 00:32:42.842, Speaker A: We need hope. Tired pixels by Armilk. And I'm not sure if this was a birthday present. This was sent to me. And I like showing Armilk's work. And you know what I find particularly fascinating about this work is the muted colors. It's a fairly.
00:32:42.842 - 00:33:07.308, Speaker A: It's almost like print colors or something. So interesting. Muted colors, interesting decisions. And, like, is that a, you know, a sun or a moon? So anyways, cool work from Armilk. 88 edition of 14, now available on secondary for 1250. And it sold on primary for five. And it probably sold out right away.
00:33:07.308 - 00:33:20.324, Speaker A: He's pretty popular. 430. Yeah, in like six minutes again. So the things are booming. Things continue to boom here. And I'm seeing new collectors show up, so I think on tazos. So pretty interesting.
00:33:20.324 - 00:33:48.334, Speaker A: My friend Ben the painter sent me this, and I thought this was kind of interesting. I wasn't sure. This is available on Saatchi, so I wasn't sure. I guess it's physical, if it's available on Saatchi art. And I just thought this was a cool version of lady with Ermine by Leonardo, which I think we all recognize here. So just kind of interesting. So, just in passing, and here is a pixel artwork.
00:33:48.334 - 00:34:09.452, Speaker A: And I don't know if this is minted anywhere. You see a fair amount of japanese pixel art that is just on Twitter. And here is a very, very nice work. I mean, it would sell, I'm sure of it. Canal district. I don't think we may have looked at this before, but anyways, again, the power of showing your work on Twitter. Here's some more pixel art.
00:34:09.452 - 00:34:39.188, Speaker A: Manital the cat tarot. So we have new ones here and some really nice dithering in the background here. So here's the emperor, and here is the. The hierophant the. Which I believe would be like the kind of the high priest magician type thing. The hierophant. Do we have a definition? Often known as the teacher or the pope and represents established principles and institutions.
00:34:39.188 - 00:34:58.988, Speaker A: The hierophant can stand in for a spiritual or religious advisor as well as a counselor or mentor who will offer you advice and direction. So super cool. Sold out and beautiful. I am loving the cat tarot. Eternal in my universe. It's like an instant classic in my universe. And this is cool.
00:34:58.988 - 00:35:38.454, Speaker A: Speaking of the instant classic, check it out ga with my work in progress of the lovers cat tarot. Have a great lunch. And this looks like aspirite. Or however you pronounce that software, the main pixel art software that looks like aseprite. So anyways, another clue into the cat tarot and Sabato laundry hole, the offshore firm volume two. So this is part of a series that we saw before with I think the guns in the office. And so kind of again a mysterious kind of pixel ish work and playing.
00:35:38.454 - 00:36:01.080, Speaker A: It's almost like a movie but it's a gif, you know. Interesting, right? And I mean Sabato's. You see the glitch here? There's probably glitches. And so just interesting work as usual here again, this feels like a gallery. A museum gallery. Our daily walk through the gallery here. Available for five Tezos edition of 25.
00:36:01.080 - 00:36:27.496, Speaker A: Do we have any other 3D Gif? And yeah, it seems to be part of a other series that we were looking at before. You can read the details here. And a few works by Eizo and a more just extremely rich glitchy color. So it's beautiful. And a piano. Great subject matter. You can hear the music coming out of those colors.
00:36:27.496 - 00:36:41.244, Speaker A: It is beautiful. And I love the title future piano one. And we have future couch four. This is an edition of one. Shall we see what it sold for offer of five. So this hasn't sold yet. So pretty cool.
00:36:41.244 - 00:37:06.246, Speaker A: And wouldn't you love to have a couch like that? And future bed four. This is an edition of 25. And let's just see what happened. And sold for five in probably right away within like let's just look. Listed at 745 Berlin time and sold out in five minutes 25. So a cool hurn 25 tazo. So Eizo continues to rake it in.
00:37:06.246 - 00:37:31.734, Speaker A: Deservingly here is a work by host of the model, another song and a really nice actually digital work here. Kind of a club track. Let's just see if we can get some volume. Volume here. Set the mood, a little bit of hope. So. Pretty cool.
00:37:31.734 - 00:37:52.042, Speaker A: House of the model has really nice melodies. Like, they're what I call cool melodies. Kind of that. It's got that final, off key little part that just makes. Gives you all that, gives you all the energy. Anyways, available for one Tezos edition of 10,000. Get it while you can.
00:37:52.042 - 00:38:09.490, Speaker A: Maybe they will burn at some point. Look at how gorgeous the sky Goodman is. All your dreams are drip highs, AI kicks, plus pixel sorting. This is gorgeous. And the color combination and everything. So, you know, it's fun to watch this evolve. It is beautiful.
00:38:09.490 - 00:38:30.146, Speaker A: These, like, you know, imagined sneakers with AI. And the grip seems to be floating off here. Very beautiful and wonderful color glitch art. Buy for six. Still, still available edition of ten. And Sulkian, you may remember, and we're going to look at a. Another point here.
00:38:30.146 - 00:38:50.164, Speaker A: Maybe we can look now. Has just released a series on FX hash, and I was trying to load up the individual works, but they were really slow. Maybe it's FX hash. Maybe it's my computer. I don't know. So anyways, terabytes. And he's the guy that put together the sizers, the synthesizer, and there's a few, actually, you can see, like, right there.
00:38:50.164 - 00:39:09.414, Speaker A: And maybe if we go to his really old work. Yeah, like, he's the guy that did this. This wonderful work here. Do we have volume? Oh, this is just a animated. Let me show you. I showed this, actually at the show. And these works, I think these are great.
00:39:09.414 - 00:39:26.894, Speaker A: If you've never seen these before. Buy for nine. Yeah. Try not to crash my computer here at the end. So just kind of cool. Super cool. Like garden airplane traps here.
00:39:26.894 - 00:39:44.940, Speaker A: Cool. Like Max Ernst continuing on. So he's got a new effects hash. Look at this. I picked this up, a one of one from Porta Malmar. And remember, he's the collage, or she. Porta Malmar is the collage artist.
00:39:44.940 - 00:40:09.996, Speaker A: And look at how fabulous this collage is. This looks like George Washington or something. And some botanical and then some really nice chunky finger painting here. Digital finger painting, for lack of better words, some nice digital shapes. I ran to pick this up for 20 tezos. One of one beautiful in my museum here. Our morning digital art museum.
00:40:09.996 - 00:40:31.156, Speaker A: A tiny moth by Lily Illo. Buy for 49 edition of 20. So this must be on secondary. It is. And kind of has a nice, what shall we say? A nice cubist feel to it, doesn't it? It has those cubist lines. I mean, it kind of shouts that from the rooftops for me. With a couple of butterflies in there.
00:40:31.156 - 00:40:52.504, Speaker A: And so this is AI. Okay. Australian artist Lily illo in collaboration with AI 2023. Tiny moth. Beautiful work and some physical work. And I've never heard of shodier art, so double check. Always double check, you know, but I assume it's.
00:40:52.504 - 00:41:10.440, Speaker A: Oh, and so shodir, this is probably his site. This is showdirs. I was wondering because I thought maybe it was a platform. Anyway, look at this. So this is acrylic. I was looking it up and just kind of a cool acrylic work here. And yeah, just kind of nice work out there.
00:41:10.440 - 00:41:43.008, Speaker A: And continuing on Quilania with another physical work. And again, kind of continuing her mystical, kind of south central american kind of vibe here. And what is this called? Imanjia acrylic glitter sequins in Photoshop 2017 and Photoshop, interestingly. And finally, another one from Bruno Miguel studio. It's funny, I posted one of these on Instagram and stories and a friend of mine was like, oh, you're posting Bruno's work. I know Bruno. So that was Tyanne.
00:41:43.008 - 00:42:03.994, Speaker A: So shout out to Tyanne, who is in Berlin here. He's from Brazil. So anyways, small world and just more beautiful work. And another one from Jesse Maconson. And this is at which gallery again? Francoise Gabali. And so here are more, you know, pieces here and pretty stunning work here. So just beautiful.
00:42:03.994 - 00:42:09.594, Speaker A: And that's your show. I hope you enjoyed it. And until next time, take care. Keep the hope, guys.
