00:00:02.880 - 00:00:42.510, Speaker A: I don't know how we're gonna do it. We have a lot to go through, probably an hour of content in the next 50 minutes. So let's see how we do as we, you know, navigate the waters of the visual arts underground here with stunning works like this by Kristen Ruse, Artist Journal, September 28, 2023. Broadcasting to the world from deep in inner space in Berlin, Germany, on a beautiful sunny day here. My name is Adrian Pokebelli, and welcome back, and a big thank you to everybody who came to the Twitter spaces yesterday. That was awesome. Artemort, Brian, super interesting.
00:00:42.510 - 00:01:24.880, Speaker A: 25 years old, speaks like a 40 year old professional. You know, a total impressive, just an impressive person, and just a super interesting discussion there on the Twitter feed. We'll look at it in a second. But a lot of very interesting things were discussed. You know, the difference between crypto art and art on the blockchain, which I think sometimes gets blended together a little. We have a very clean distinction, courtesy of Brian, of what that all means. Of course, long story short, crypto art would be art that references the crypto ethos.
00:01:24.880 - 00:01:58.364, Speaker A: I mean, it's beautiful. It's almost out of Oxford English dictionary type definition there. Awesome. And whereas art on the blockchain, which Brian distinguishes from crypto art, is just basically like any digital art, like maybe like this by Kristin Roose here, minted on the blockchain using tokenization in order to kind of transact and buy and sell, you know, create ownership and everything. So it was just a really cool space. And thank you, everybody, for attending, and thank you to Ardemore for being a guest. Thrilled with how those are going.
00:01:58.364 - 00:02:17.924, Speaker A: So here we are. Kristen cityscape. This is from onverse, and I believe they go for auction tomorrow. This is a one of one. And I love this for a couple of reasons. Maybe at this point, some of you are starting to guess. Well, first of all, I mean, what is the kind of, the first thing that kind of pops up to you is the stunningly gorgeous color.
00:02:17.924 - 00:02:53.708, Speaker A: Of course, Kristin Roos calls this vintage software. I like to call it retro tools, but I think vintage software is actually a little bit more technically precise. But it's kind of the similar meaning. And I'm not sure if this is deluxe paint, because we've seen a few artists. I played with deluxe paint once, and so I'm not quite sure, but I know Kristin Roos has used deluxe paint in the past, although it's not exactly, say, similar to Sabato and Muji. But maybe it is. Like maybe, or there's different kinds of deluxe paint, too.
00:02:53.708 - 00:03:32.596, Speaker A: Like, there's deluxe paint two, three, and four, and maybe the original. So not exactly sure which tool. It doesn't say in the description, but this beautiful cycling color. The colors are stunning, aren't they? And also, this is a cityscape, right? So you see the outlines of buildings, opportunities to put in patterning, or, you know, as we've seen in many artists, whether it's human kernel, just, we've seen it as it's a very commonly thing. Use PP universal, create the outline. And that's an opportunity to just put something in there that's fun. Right? And here it is again.
00:03:32.596 - 00:04:19.460, Speaker A: I mean, take a city block with this really cool entrance here and, you know, billboard, and you just create outlines and they become opportunities for patterning, you know, or whatever you want to call it, for just, you know, whatever you want to put in there. So we see that here. An interesting attempt at three dimensionality here, too, which is really cool. So very, very cool artist, I believe, out of Copenhagen, Kristen Roos. And I'll tell you the final thing that I love about this is the wonderful, the wonderfully beautiful contrast. And which contrast do you say? Do you ask? It is this wonderful cycling color, which is just a massage on the retina, right. It just massaging my retinas here.
00:04:19.460 - 00:05:10.558, Speaker A: And that is contrasting with this beautiful. It's dynamic as well. And that is contrasting with this black and white, you know, not the absence of color kind of background, for lack of better term, with these great, you know, almost look like flowers or they're dots, but with like, little smaller dots within them that almost make an x out of it. It's like there's a little gray pixel in the middle of these dots, and they are still right. So we have the contrast of the dynamic buildings, or color cycling on the buildings with the static, you know, circular pixels is kind of what it looks like outside that are monochromatic. So beautiful contrast here and just stunningly gorgeous work. So this is starting bid of $800, $800 us on versus website.
00:05:10.558 - 00:05:35.792, Speaker A: And I have to give verse credit, like they have a quanta drop that I think is also happening. It's pretty impressive. They're very kind of tight curation. They're doing it really well. And, yeah, and the website looks pretty nice. It'll be interesting to see how they do on these auctions here. It's on the Ethereum blockchain, interestingly, even though it has dollars.
00:05:35.792 - 00:06:34.568, Speaker A: So you see they're almost trying to appeal to a crowd beyond crypto. And this came up. I highly recommend you listen to the spaces yesterday that we had with Artemort, because Artemort worked at Sotheby's in the NFT. He was an NFT specialist, I believe it, at Sotheby's in Paris before they shut down, if I understood the story right, and always check with him, and he's doing all sorts of amazing things. But I asked him, like, what is your sense from the inside, seeing these collectors, seeing these experts in art, what is your sense of their understanding, their awareness of, say, art on tezos, for example, or say, art like this? And it was a really interesting answer, which was, everybody's just kind of concerned with their own thing. And I totally under. So nobody's overly interested, because everybody are specialists in these things.
00:06:34.568 - 00:07:16.300, Speaker A: They want to know more about that thing. And I understand it because in a sense, what it got me thinking is, when you don't know something exists, you don't expect it to exist. I didn't expect all of the, like, I was on the blockchain for a little over a year, I think, when I discovered through going, you know, like, I first minted on super rare back in. I'm not sure if it was October 2020 or March 2021. Then I minted on hen or not hen, a tea hen was already shut down. I minted on Teia in December of 2021, started. And it wasn't until two or three months after minting on Teia.
00:07:16.300 - 00:08:02.698, Speaker A: So over, like, let's say, a year, being aware of NFTs and even minting as an artist in selling that, I started to see what was going on on tazos. And it really. It started with Haiti Rockette. And then, of course, then I found out Kurt Hussle collective, which used to be called JNK, through Haiti's collection. So I started jumping from collection to collection. And yeah, I mean, it was kind of life changing, but I just did not expect it. I thought when you heard NFT art, it was basically x copy, you know, in a handful of super rare artists from back in the day that were there first and who were kind of doing incredible things at the auction houses, I thought that was the extent of it.
00:08:02.698 - 00:08:35.830, Speaker A: I also discovered Rata's pixel art. Big shout out to Rada. I also discovered Rada's pixel art, which was a real. That's when I really got kinda thinking, I need to buy some of this stuff on tazos. So all to say, I understand, I don't condemn anyone, or, like, I can relate if you don't know about this, and you don't think it should exist because I think it really is an awareness issue. And there's all sorts of interesting things said in that conversation. So I highly recommend it.
00:08:35.830 - 00:08:51.454, Speaker A: So here is the whole series by Kristen Ruse. So cityscape. So it looks like they basically commissioned a series of sorts. And it's gorgeous here. I picked some of my favorites here. And here is another one. This one is called cityscape structure number three.
00:08:51.454 - 00:09:16.374, Speaker A: This is an edition of ten, only 0.06 ETH or $100. So pretty nice. Like, I expect this to sell out like probably close to instantly, I would imagine. I mean, this is on ETH, a 0.06 edition of ten sounds pretty reasonable. For these gorgeous Kristin Roos works, you can pay by credit card metamask tazos or prepaid USDC.
00:09:16.374 - 00:09:37.082, Speaker A: Interesting. So they're really trying to bridge the gap here. And here's another one, cityscape structure number four. So just, again, just washing across the visual field here. Just stunningly gorgeous work by Kristen Rus. I like this download thing here. That there too.
00:09:37.082 - 00:10:07.494, Speaker A: Like, I mean, it really kinda shows the, I guess that's kind of part of the ethos of the blockchain there too. Here's another one. City structure number five, with these stunning violets and blues and gorgeous blues and turning green. Look at that. The color, the color, the color, the color. So just stunningly gorgeous. So that is on verse, I think the website, let's just quickly see the website is verse works.
00:10:07.494 - 00:10:25.048, Speaker A: Nice website too. So they have put a lot of care into what they're doing over there. So worth checking out and tracking. So again, big thank you. Nice turnout here with artemort, aka Brian. Thank you, roon tune. It was super fascinating episode comments from last show.
00:10:25.048 - 00:10:54.014, Speaker A: So remember last show we were talking about, is negative art criticism necessary? My provocative question there, and we got some responses. And just on the show in general and on that question, Marcel Muntiano Tezos culture is something the shape of which we can actually feel right now. I hear you, I hear you. It is. It's very exciting. What's happening, magician? Hey man, I like the way you sometimes pronounce my name. So we got confirmation that it is magic magician.
00:10:54.014 - 00:11:07.890, Speaker A: But yeah, it's pronounced just like magician. You know, it's like the Aleister Crowley magic. I love it. It's almost kind of magical. That's almost how I was imagining we pronounce it. You totally caught me off guard this morning with showing my work. Thank you.
00:11:07.890 - 00:11:26.090, Speaker A: What you are doing with the artist journal is invaluable. Whenever, wherever you decide to mint it, I will collect. And I may do that as soon as tonight. I may put on four episodes here. I'm kind of behind. I need to just get that done. Working on just putting together a nice little kind of terms like, you know, you can't rebroadcast or license.
00:11:26.090 - 00:11:56.046, Speaker A: This isn't a license is basically what I want to put. Maybe I'll get chat GPT to help me write that. Have you ever considered creating a discord? It's come up in the past. Right now it's just, it's mostly a matter of time is kind of the issue. Like, it's already hard to kind of track all the Twitter. Then there's the YouTube comments, which I love like this, you know, and so I want to be able to reply to all of them. So if I have a discord, it might just push me over the edge.
00:11:56.046 - 00:12:14.344, Speaker A: But I. I do like it in principle. I do like it in principle. The idea, it could serve as a center of gravity for all the energy swirling around the magical pirate ship of the mind that you're chartering. Thank you sincerely for all the work you're doing. Thank you for the wonderfully beautiful comments. And magician, thank you for the collects as well.
00:12:14.344 - 00:12:32.088, Speaker A: Thank you, DJ Curo. Thank you, sir, for showing my artworks again. It's an AI generated contemporary painting with analog treatments. I love it. An AI generated contemporary painting. The crazy text says rhyme. Is that crunchy? So then we get some crazy text here, some cut up text.
00:12:32.088 - 00:12:47.824, Speaker A: Loving the shows, watching daily and collecting the works. That's a just, that could be like a, that's like an Airbnb review. It's just a beautiful. I almost want to quote that. Watch this show. And there's the quote underneath. Skomra, great show.
00:12:47.824 - 00:13:06.240, Speaker A: Thanks for showing my work. Again, it's all AI. So we're going to look at another scammer today. I make my own models, textual inversion or embeddings to help me get the styles and sometimes objects that I'm going, that I'm going for. For me, AI art is about what it means to be human at this moment. I think you said topical. It sure is topical.
00:13:06.240 - 00:13:38.054, Speaker A: It's the new tool. So it gets to represent the new milieu, at least in my head. In this series, I'm enjoying playing the AI ness, the textures and extra fingers, etcetera, off the immediately and off the immediacy and authenticity that we associate with drawing. Well, they're looking fabulous. Skomra, they're looking really just fabulous. So thank you for the comment and the explanation there. So to the art criticism topic, tragic.
00:13:38.054 - 00:14:06.630, Speaker A: 991 about Paul Reed topic, which I'm a huge fan of. I mean, really huge. Yeah, I'd never heard of Paul Reed before. In my opinion, to be criticized, even in a bad manner by these guys, it means you really made it. I would personally be honored to get that comment. That one bad comment made him, gave him more exposure than a thousand good ones. And absolutely, that is the right, you know, and I think he rightly kind of promoted because you didn't kind of turn away in shame and hide the comment.
00:14:06.630 - 00:14:42.834, Speaker A: He told everybody, hey, look, Jerry Saltz's making a nasty comment about my artwork. So, as you know, it brings up, I think it's the ABCs of Andy Warhol, which is actually a great book. I think it's that or the philosophy of Andy Warhol. It came out around the same time. I think it's not what they write about you, it's how many inches do they write about you? Referring to newspaper articles, like, how much are they talking about you? Kind of a law of pr. I mean, that's like a New York print kind of lost. So this is totally in that spirit, isn't it? Also, Jerry is known to like to do that.
00:14:42.834 - 00:15:09.498, Speaker A: A lot of critics intentionally give bad reviews when they want to help artists because they know it will cause more disturbance. Yeah, I've heard the soul mentality. You know, maybe you've seen it in your own life with friends, like, oh, I'm just being a jerk to you because that's good for you, and it's going to help you. I'm kind of, you know, it's just a different philosophy. I don't think making people feel bad about themselves is helpful. Some people do. Other people.
00:15:09.498 - 00:15:56.042, Speaker A: To me, it's how to win friends and influence people. Chapter one. Never criticize if you're working with someone at work, especially with graphic designers. And I know the graphic designers out there will likely relate to what I'm saying. If you're dealing with a graphic designer, for example, or an artist, frankly. But let's say a graphic designer, for the sake of argument, the first thing you say is, I really like how you did this part here, or I really like something about it. Start with something positive, and then it's like, oh, what do you think about for the parts that you're having issue with? What do you think about maybe trying a different thing over here? Because, you know, all to say, my philosophy on this, and people have different philosophies on.
00:15:56.042 - 00:16:23.134, Speaker A: It is, as they say in how to win friends and influence people. When, rather than criticizing, when you start saying, oh, I really like how you do that. You know what happens? The person starts working three or four times harder. They are excited and they're like someone. It just gives like a big boost. Their self esteem goes up, they feel great and they want to make more work for you, and they're working twice as hard. That's what happens.
00:16:23.134 - 00:16:56.556, Speaker A: And when you start with criticism in a, say, graphic design ad agency environment, it makes them dejected. It was like, why did I even do this? This person doesn't understand me. The ego comes in and then it's just an ego battle. So I just, it's, for me, it's pure pragmatism. Positivity is pragmatic, right? I would argue, but that's just a philosophical thing. I mean, I've had friends again where it's like, oh, I'm just being a jerk to you because I like you, right? This whole thing. So I'm always a little suspicious of this argument, but I understand it.
00:16:56.556 - 00:17:12.452, Speaker A: I don't know if here is the case, and I'm not defending him, but I think this can only help Paul in the long run. And it absolutely did help Paul. And we're going to look at the show actually in a second here. Excuse me. Ps, I love this episode. Like all others keep showing up, people are already starting to notice what you are doing. Well, thank you.
00:17:12.452 - 00:17:36.202, Speaker A: And yeah, it feels like there's a before and after from when we started, when I started posting on Twitter. And I'm really gonna have to run through the rest of this episode. Putting those Twitter videos up has really increased the reach of this entire show. Runetune. The Jerry Saltz comment is confounding and totally insensitive. Unknown collector brings up a point about the setting space in which criticism can be helpful. It requires either.
00:17:36.202 - 00:18:14.044, Speaker A: Well, exactly. It requires, it's about context. Because some people are saying, well, what's wrong with criticism? Like you, you know, it's all about context. Using clothing as an example, you're never, you shouldn't probably, I would argue, feel free to disagree, but if someone's wearing a shirt you don't like, are you going to start going, I really dislike your shirt, or is that just rude? Right. But if you go to fashion design school and then it's about, hey, and you make a shirt and you're looking for feedback, then you go, okay, this works. This doesn't work. And that's okay.
00:18:14.044 - 00:18:47.094, Speaker A: It's about context, right? And that's just like you go to art school, and so if people are soliciting it, it's a completely different story. Sometimes you pay for the criticism, right? So that you can be better. But I think it's important that people are asking. It requires either a relationship or an agreed upon setting in which criticism is expected or invited. I would never disparage an artist or their work totally unsolicited and publicly bad form. Indeed. Yes, it's bad form, I would argue, and I don't think it really worked that well for Jerry Saltz.
00:18:47.094 - 00:19:31.872, Speaker A: Like, does Jerry Saltz look like a winner after all that? Like, maybe to some people, but I didn't get that impression. Within the arts and beyond, criticism of that kind is more of a spectacle than it is constructive, because that type of sensationalism sells. I think food critic Pete Wells will sell more articles if he disparages restaurants in his New York Times article. And I must admit, some of those critic takedowns are indeed entertaining. Or they can be. On the other hand, they are totally insensitive. Has Pete Wells ever owned and operated his own restaurant? And this is another excellent question here, and I was kind of alluding to this, but it's kind of like when art critics comment on artists work, having not put their own artwork there, not only made it themselves, but put it out in the public to be scrutinized.
00:19:31.872 - 00:20:18.360, Speaker A: It's like me reading a book on plumbing and then trying to tell plumbers how to do their job. What do I know about plumbing? I know next to nothing. And it'd be like me reading a few reading articles and studying it all in theory and then trying to say, well, actually, the book says you should do this to a plumber, a business that has such excruciating thin margins of profit. Take your point about Saltz not contributing much to the arts himself outside of his criticism in quotes, might I add that Saltz blocked me on instagram after I made a comment pushing back on some of his commentary in a post he made. Yes, how weak is that? He deleted my comment and blocked me rather than use his professional rhetoric to respond to me. So, yeah, thank you for the comment. Roon toon.
00:20:18.360 - 00:20:32.248, Speaker A: I totally agree, Rada. Love the show, mon. Feels like home. Yes, I was almost tempted. I thought it might sound a little much at the opening there, the home of the visual arts underground, but I love it. Thank you, Radha. It's always awesome to hear from you.
00:20:32.248 - 00:20:51.004, Speaker A: K Blein on Jerry Salz. Unfortunately, this horrendous comment is true. It's really disappointing. There is no review, just these words. I don't think it could qualify as a proper art critique, to be honest. I read horrendous comments of art critics in the past, but that was to provoke. And the rest of the review went more in depth, at least.
00:20:51.004 - 00:21:26.994, Speaker A: Yes, it came off as just kind of like sniping and without giving any. Yeah, but again, probably in Jerry Saltz's mind, because everybody thinks they're a good person. So I assume in Jerry Saltz's mind he probably thinks, oh, I totally helped that artist, and they're going to get attention and maybe they'll get better too, is probably what Jerry Saltz is saying to himself. But I agree. Cabling rosatio, I believe the word you're looking for is retrospective. Indeed. Whose retrospective was it? Santiago we were thinking of a retrospective, watching a retrospective in real time.
00:21:26.994 - 00:21:46.834, Speaker A: And finally, and thank you, indio on point with art critic relevance. Indio robot thank you. Yo uh oh. Xylograph is the same as a woodcut, if I'm not mistaken, so excellent. We'll look this up in a chat GPT sometime soon. Acid boy Jerry Saltz is losing it these days. Yeah.
00:21:46.834 - 00:22:03.488, Speaker A: Jack, coffee, Macbeth. Thank you, metageist. Thank you. Flynn, DPZ, Martin Joe, awesome to hear from. And here's rosatio on critics about critics. I remember the time when I had to do an artist talk in 2014. It was my very first contemporary art group exhibition.
00:22:03.488 - 00:22:19.284, Speaker A: I'm a self taught artist. I was not in the art scene. I was shocked when one of the discussants, an eccentric professor, also an artist, criticized me. I never had an experience like this. He said something like, whose artwork is that in the corner? I don't recognize him. It's bad. My niece can do that.
00:22:19.284 - 00:22:42.020, Speaker A: It hurt my heart. But when I think about it now, his words made me always think about how I can make artwork better. So yeah, sometimes I need the criticism when it's ass like in an artist's talk. But when someone out of nowhere talks badly about my art on social media, I will just ignore them. But then again, when someone has the time to write something about my art, even if it's a critique, I will feel humbled because they spared their precious time for me. Exactly. Back to Warhol here.
00:22:42.020 - 00:22:50.388, Speaker A: I hope it makes sense. Pardon for the long. Not at all. Thank you for the comment. And this is the artwork from the exhibition. So Rosatio has been at work. That must be Rosatio.
00:22:50.388 - 00:23:19.314, Speaker A: Big shout out. So here is the work a controversial work. And you can even see the kind of elements of Rosatio's work here way early on. That's great documentation there, great photos, Rosatio. So here is the work just very quickly. And I had another thought on this because I think I understand when Jerry Saltz says, this is horrendous, I think referring to this work here, I think I understand what's going on. Like why Jerry Saltz is saying that.
00:23:19.314 - 00:24:03.544, Speaker A: And I suspect that the reason is, is Jerry Saltz says, oh, this is kind of corny, is probably what Jerry Saltz is thinking. Otherwise, like, technically, this looks like it's done quite well, right? It's not like these are technically bad paintings, but that kind of makes. What kind of brought that up in my mind, though, was that's nothing that's going to be fixed by a criticism. If someone has that kind of aesthetic that you don't like, you're not going to fix that with criticism. That is what they're going to do and they're going to stick with that. So I found it truly unhelpful because I think I under. It's just for him to think that's going to help anything.
00:24:03.544 - 00:24:36.250, Speaker A: So it sort of becomes about to each their own, you know, unknown collectors. So glad that in this space, some platforms really care for democratizing the art world. We always talk about artists, but also for me, as an aspiring curator, I would never gotten a chance in trad art, of course, but object one, Kika Nicolela and Kabling one gave me a chance without looking too much at my background. But by seeing my work. Very good point. Unknown collector. One of the beautiful things about this space is it is more democratic.
00:24:36.250 - 00:25:04.790, Speaker A: It's not like, I mean, in the traditional art world, contemporary art scene, it's like, what school did you go to? As if that makes a difference. Right? This is what this space is about. Of course, we need professionalism and quality art and work around art, but we are also here to experiment in every field and give people chances. We need a healthy balance to make it different here. Amen. Just on the whole royalties front, this was fascinating. So this is account called cigar.
00:25:04.790 - 00:25:35.132, Speaker A: Yuga Labs is not messing around. They made it clear that their collections will only be traded on royalty enforced marketplaces. X two, y two and pseudoswap. So smaller marketplaces. So their latest mara collection blocks trading on Opensea, blur looksrare and pseudoswap v one. So that is pretty interesting because Yuga labs, of course, has some of the most expensive, uh, nfts in the whole space with their now it's by a $40,000 board, uh, ape yacht club. So that's pretty interesting.
00:25:35.132 - 00:25:53.544, Speaker A: And this was also hilarious. And then I have to literally, unfortunately, go too fast through this show. Uh, die with the most likes. Replying to what looks like the real blur account. GM, we notice your collection isn't tradable on blur. It's currently tradable on Opensea without royalties. If this was unintentional, please let us know and we'd be happy to assist.
00:25:53.544 - 00:26:32.270, Speaker A: Shaking right now at the prospect of getting passed around like a Costco rotisserie chicken in a cash for gold marketplace built on the dying dreams of artists, every meat market is unbearable. It's just a matter of finding a butcher with some discernible, albeit dwindling, morsel of humanity remaining. So, a poetic response. And here the art detective, Katya Kazakhina. A tsunami of lawsuits hits the art world as this is what I wanted to highlight. As money gets tight, so the art world, we've been tracking this since May, continues to tighten up in terms of liquidity and money. Regulars descend.
00:26:32.270 - 00:26:48.314, Speaker A: So now there's art. As the money tightens up, we're getting a tsunami of lawsuits. Pretty interesting. Here's one of one. We just started looking at NUV 1914 recently. One of one has just put out this interview with them. And so check this out.
00:26:48.314 - 00:27:04.654, Speaker A: I've actually never been to one of one site before. It's a sub stack and it looks really cool. Issue number 18. I read this interview on the subway, the U Bahn out here. It was awesome. I, and I learned a couple of artists there too, that NUV 1914 likes. This is super interesting here too.
00:27:04.654 - 00:27:37.642, Speaker A: Something savage. And shout out to Tornado Rodriguez for sending this to me. So as you can see in this video here, a pen plotter and almost like, look at this. So this looks like a physical kind of gif. But things are starting to blend into each other because it looks like it starts with a digital file that gets rendered physically and then basically gets turned digital again with the giphysation. And that overlap, as this person points out, is also beautiful. Continues to be an incredibly exciting area of investigation.
00:27:37.642 - 00:28:03.544, Speaker A: Francois Gamma, Amstrad Action Way 1986 so this is interesting. Conveyor belt by Roger Wilson and swirl by Paul Fairhurst. So you start to see some of Francoise Gamma's influences here on Instagram. I thought that was super interesting. And here's Luciana Guerra. Painting always wins. So an update here on the oil painting work by Luciana based on her digital.
00:28:03.544 - 00:28:13.968, Speaker A: That is very cool. And maybe you can guess the artist here. I just love this shot walk. Look at this. Look at that wall. The wall is stunning. It is just totally awesome.
00:28:13.968 - 00:28:36.836, Speaker A: Okay, we got to run. Goyang arts, this is going to be on AOTM on October 3. I have 20 minutes, so I apologize if we go too fast here. Look at how beautiful this is. I love gui young arts. Just beautiful. Nice textures.
00:28:36.836 - 00:28:56.510, Speaker A: Just so much fun and beautiful. And the wolf going with the deer underneath. It's beautiful. Continuing on, Kappen commission work for space wizard. So just a classic Kappn. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful from Kappn there. So commission Gozo is back interior.
00:28:56.510 - 00:29:24.102, Speaker A: So again, using digital collage, pixels and maybe some stable diffusion, I think SD materials here. Digital collage 2023. I mean, I almost should, probably should put this in the AI, where I kind of group together the AI works. But, I mean, to me, they're just beautiful paintings, and they almost look more like paintings than AI works. So I expect this trend to continue. This almost looks like a fire. It's kind of representational, kind of abstract, beautiful.
00:29:24.102 - 00:30:08.830, Speaker A: I expect this trend to continue where it's going to get harder and harder to tell how things are made. And the only clue we're going to have of something like this being an AI work is the fact that we don't know how else it would have been made. And it seems almost too original. That's how we're going to know Nirvana by Flosstinarum. A beautiful illustration here on super rare. Kind of has a kind of eastern feel to it, with the framing and even in the subject matter and even in the composition, kind of the center alignment here and there, you see almost like a buddhist temple in the background of sorts. And this cool kind of three dimensionality in the front here with these foreground objects, almost like a Renaissance painting.
00:30:08.830 - 00:30:45.900, Speaker A: Interesting, I think of Bellini, you know, one of the Bellini's interesting, so cool work there. Spiritual machine. RJ, have you said your prayers? So these are only a tezos, and this looks like it's incorporating AI as well. Doesn't it seem to have a similar feel to Gozo's work that we're just looking at here? And it's almost like the AI version of this patterning that you find in the Mac. It's almost like it's been put in to a AI, like, combined, and then maybe work done again. Something's going on here. There's something kind of unusual about that.
00:30:45.900 - 00:30:58.340, Speaker A: Only a tezos there edition of 250. And look at this new tezos. One of one tomorrow. So something to get excited about from RJ again here. Katuna on detaste amnesia. I dreamed that I sleep. I don't fill my grave yet.
00:30:58.340 - 00:31:17.542, Speaker A: Dark work, beautifully textured, made on a phone. And the phone is my main tool these days. I basically am using the phone for the promoted stories series. And then I master in Photoshop. But then 90% of the work is done on the phone. So good for the taste. It looks great.
00:31:17.542 - 00:31:38.050, Speaker A: And, you know, made on an iPhone. Maria by the myth. So an interesting portrait here. Kind of much more roughly painted, but very precise in the eyes. And the eyelashes here, so interesting. Makes a nice contrast, actually. All this roughness you see in the background with those very precise eyelashes.
00:31:38.050 - 00:31:54.666, Speaker A: Interesting and nice. Kind of beautiful. Procreate painting, I believe by the myth. A one of one for 150 tezos and sold to Hegel art collector. How are we doing? Continue to run here. Sumi reusi. Immotility, which is a word I've never seen before.
00:31:54.666 - 00:32:17.354, Speaker A: And just kind of a dark work here, seemingly with the vines that are growing. Maybe dark, I imagine kind of dark, but not necessarily with the vines growing across the person here. And so just an interesting painting here. Edition of 520 tezos each. And there is one left. So cool. Digital painting from Sumi Ryusi.
00:32:17.354 - 00:32:37.094, Speaker A: Kappa Sage freedom two. So a portrait of someone, maybe Kappa, in jail here. And interesting composition here, with maybe some people in the background hanging out here. Interesting work. And pictures on the wall. Counting the days here. And lots of tattoos.
00:32:37.094 - 00:32:52.166, Speaker A: Really nicely done tattoos there on the body. Capsage edition of ten. Freedom two. So selling for eight tezos each. Rustic digital art. Look at the sky. So now you may not be able to see it.
00:32:52.166 - 00:33:13.478, Speaker A: Luckily, I brought it up close. Kind of looks like the night sky, but I brought it up close. And what you'll see is it's made of little marios. So the Marios are back. And of course, as we know, with rustic digital art, celebrating irrationality. And as I say, it's not easy to be irrational. And rustic is doing a really good job of doing it.
00:33:13.478 - 00:33:43.426, Speaker A: So more cool work there. Memory number three from Sebast Sestaro. This is an edition of 15 for five tezos. Just another original, interesting kind of spray, almost like airbrush, with illustration work and kind of a surreal illustration. Santiago with another super cool abstract here, edition of 15 for three tezos. What is this? Many AI outputs put together as a collage. So AI outputs used for collage.
00:33:43.426 - 00:34:02.872, Speaker A: I mean, it's just. It had to happen, and it's happening and it's glorious, actually. Look at how cool this is. It's glorious. Three tazos and quampa. Let's just get a Windoj Microsoft paint 2023. This is commissioned by cryptopathic for the own the doge community.
00:34:02.872 - 00:34:15.952, Speaker A: So maybe this is. There's the doge that collectively owns the iconic doge meme. Oh, so they own the doge meme. And they commissioned Cuompa. And there's Doge. And there's another doge. That is pretty hilarious.
00:34:15.952 - 00:34:31.164, Speaker A: Doge is the dog, of course, the crypto. The meme crypto. And there's another dog. Really, really beautifully done. Really beautifully done. Let's open this super quick. We don't really have time, but I just want to see a little closer look at how brilliantly this is made here.
00:34:31.164 - 00:34:49.170, Speaker A: Again, taking the outline, maybe even removing the outline and just filling it in here with this patterning. And this is really cool, too. I'll look forward to seeing an even higher resolution of this. And here, look at how great this looked. This is on verse. Verse works. I'm absolutely ecstatic to announce the continuation of simple thoughts by quampa.
00:34:49.170 - 00:35:08.166, Speaker A: This is lonely boy arriving on verse works October 12. So verse works. It's looking good. It's looking very, very good. Tyrants. So this is the demon ego, kind of, for lack of better term, it's a series. I don't know if I'd call it a PFP series, but it's almost in that spirit here.
00:35:08.166 - 00:35:22.136, Speaker A: And they're a reserve of 15 ETH. And I think there's nine tyrants, at least so far. So very cool here. That is on foundation. Ed Morolla with super interesting work here. As you see, it's a figure. Look.
00:35:22.136 - 00:35:45.626, Speaker A: Many worlds, one eye. It's for Tezos edition of 25. Almost like, I mean, this is. You would have thought this was physical before, but this is probably just made in procreate, these original brushwork, brush marks. And here you see kind of a figure that is like a big eye, but it's a head. And then the tree for kind of a brain. Again, always kind of like ancient looking, archaeological looking.
00:35:45.626 - 00:36:06.218, Speaker A: Ed Marolla. Great color, very subtle color. And a beautiful work here by stippinpixel on Zora. Just awesome. I love the Cats series. Who doesn't love cats? Kind of a fitting, you know, for me, this is like a fitting kind of follow up to, like, Warhol's cats. Kind of celebrates the same kind of things, which is just like the.
00:36:06.218 - 00:36:21.294, Speaker A: The greatness and the cuteness of cats. There they are on a table just hanging out. Nice animation. Beautiful kind of pixelation here. That four on the floor pixelation as I like to call it. Smartly colored. Very smartly colored.
00:36:21.294 - 00:36:39.952, Speaker A: Michael Macasso with a beautiful work here. This is not a goodbye. And of course I follow Michael Macasso. That is a Twitter bug. Look at how beautiful. All this dithering is kind of a classical theme. Beautiful background here and just a beautiful work just put out on Twitter.
00:36:39.952 - 00:36:57.984, Speaker A: Metax position. This is pinky blue and this is also on Zora. So Zora continues to attract artists from across the blockchain. This is awesome. So pinky blue here, who you usually use is pink and blue. And here you have kind of like a two faced person. Meta times position.
00:36:57.984 - 00:37:38.724, Speaker A: Meta Exposition 15 minted free mint blue Anis Abdin so this is probably an older work, but I just wanted to show it because Anis Abdin has been posting a lot of beautiful work here. And here you see a nature scene done in pixel art style with what looks like some crocodiles coming through here. So just a beautiful work there. Some experimental pixel art from Element Li Transfer 256 x 256 again, I think uses an iPhone. If you go to element lis object page, I believe it's experimental pixel art made on an iPhone or made on a phone. So that's maybe part of the secret as to why these look a little different. Here's the colored version.
00:37:38.724 - 00:37:53.192, Speaker A: So very cool. You could sell both, couldn't you? And I love how the outline, not following the outline too closely. Same here. Very nice. And nice kind of patterning. Just super interesting as always. This is tickle tokens.
00:37:53.192 - 00:38:24.622, Speaker A: This is a, as you can see, it is a work that you can basically affect. Interactive work is the word I'm looking for. So just interesting. Hey, then you click. So this is a whole new genre, I'd argue, of art, especially in digital art, let's say, where you can really create the composition here in real time. I also like the idea of being able to export where you actually are co creating the work in a very real way. If you can do exports of what you're doing.
00:38:24.622 - 00:38:33.742, Speaker A: Here's a one of one from Rinnefish. I didn't see that was a one of one. Cool. I'm a big fan of these. One of ones on Tazos. I've been doing them. I love them.
00:38:33.742 - 00:38:51.834, Speaker A: It's just fun. Fun. Look how beautiful this is. Very poetic and beautiful. These psychedelic pastels here. Some underwater looking creatures, maybe some bugs, a couple of dogs there, a heart. Just beautiful.
00:38:51.834 - 00:39:10.694, Speaker A: Look at this brilliant work, of course, who can't help himself, Danny P. Thibodeaux, aka his trouble waffle, just cannot help being brilliant here. And here's just another example of this person looking like they're watching a tv screen. And people love this work. It went for. There's a bidding war. It went for 100 tezos.
00:39:10.694 - 00:39:33.990, Speaker A: It's an addition of six. And it's not easy to get these works because it's always tricky with the way that Denny P. Thibodeau or Hasdrubal releases the work. He really likes to play with the mechanics, as he was saying in the space that we did a few months ago. Some interesting works by NUV 1914. So again, really experimental stuff here. Even this line here.
00:39:33.990 - 00:39:54.972, Speaker A: Beautiful gradients playing with iconography of a certain kind. Esps, espacial, espas, Douai. Edition of two. Simbrando edition of two. So just interesting works here. Quite beautiful. And, you know, I love artists who can kind of mystify me, you know, where you just have no idea what they're going to do next.
00:39:54.972 - 00:40:12.170, Speaker A: And NUV 1914, I mean, look at how radical this work is. Again, I highly recommend reading that interview. It's not too long. You can read it in a subway sitting. That one of one did Lucasil. Interesting titles too. So you see how just kind of.
00:40:12.170 - 00:40:29.934, Speaker A: Again, we're back to this kind of boldness in the experiment, in the experimentalism. It's very interesting work. Here's another one. Kirinos. And how are we doing here? I have to speed up. So just another one here. Alambratas.
00:40:29.934 - 00:40:48.870, Speaker A: Just super interesting work. Edition of two. I found. I feel like I've seen this artist's name before, but NUV 1914 mentioned Martin, Brooklyn. I think we've shown work by Martin Brook before, but I'm not positive and hadn't seen in a while. Bulbasaur rain. This was mentioned by NUV 1914 in the interview.
00:40:48.870 - 00:41:11.984, Speaker A: And so just interesting work here. Again, very experimental. Really. I find it the most exciting area right now that kind of excites me is just this what I'm calling like indie or alternative digital art. This is Spiegel's maskinen open edition for $30. So this is nifty gateways. So I wonder if this is going to become a trend where we start seeing more and more things sold in dollars.
00:41:11.984 - 00:41:47.274, Speaker A: Kind of a different feel for Spiegels. It's like, where's all the dithering? I mean, there's a little bit, but it's a different feel. And I feel like I've seen this one before. So taking elements from maybe previous works here, almost creating a movie out of them almost reminds me of abnormalities. The music, it's beautiful. I might have to. Oh, it's beautiful.
00:41:47.274 - 00:41:59.754, Speaker A: The music is beautiful too. Like, okay, we got through it. Wow. $30.01 sec. Spiegelsmaskinen. Zero editions minted so far.
00:41:59.754 - 00:42:39.374, Speaker A: Might be a find there. A little treasure there. And this is chimecraft. This is part of a bigger show. Phosphor operator is the artist here. Just awesome. I go to nifty gateway and or to phosphor operators page to get the full work.
00:42:39.374 - 00:42:50.682, Speaker A: Just very cool. Sky Goodman. Look at this. Obliterated highs. So a very textured sky Goodman here. Really cool. Look at how gorgeous this is.
00:42:50.682 - 00:43:03.934, Speaker A: Beautiful. Beautiful textures here. Very contrasting with the shininess, you might say, of Skye's other work. Edition of eight for eleven tazos. Really nicely done. Micah Oladef. An addition of one artifact, number 44.
00:43:03.934 - 00:43:26.862, Speaker A: So another cool glitched out work by Mika Oladev. And let's keep going here. Score. Phalaenopsis. So let's play this. Good to see score on the scene again, I believe uses, I think it's called touch designer. Just really cool art.
00:43:26.862 - 00:43:43.710, Speaker A: It'd be cool to get score actually on the spaces at some point. So just interesting work here. Very cool. So that is a one of one. And let's just see what happened. Transferred to Bijou. So maybe a commission for Bijou.
00:43:43.710 - 00:44:09.674, Speaker A: Ugo, Morpheus, take the red pill or the blue pill here, done with the new Ugo treatment here. Looks awesome. Nice chunky pixels, Ugo looking good. Edition of 1015 tezos acid boy. Great to see acid boy again, as I like to call him, the master of psychedelic abstraction, as you can see here. With a bit of a different feel on this one. So maybe taking a break and coming back with something a little different.
00:44:09.674 - 00:44:30.698, Speaker A: So very cool here. A star is born. Great title. Continuing on, measureless is also back byline number two. So very cool. Animated abstract works from measureless. So super cool edition of 200 for two tezos dead pixel party by trilobyte.
00:44:30.698 - 00:44:53.944, Speaker A: And these could all just hang in the same room, couldn't they? So yes, trilobyte edition of 13 for five tezos. And Santiago is a codal, a watcher of this show. Eee one. And here's a gif. And again, this could hang in the same room in the psychedelic room of our visual arts underground exhibition here. Just super cool. Look at that.
00:44:53.944 - 00:45:21.288, Speaker A: Awesome. And doctor version, I think could join the party here. Edition of one spark aligner. And there is volume, which I think is unusual for Mister version or Doctor version. So this one's a little bit more cinematic than previous. It's very cool. It has a bit more of a narrative or a peak, so to speak.
00:45:21.288 - 00:45:36.426, Speaker A: Very interesting from Doctor version. Let's just see. Went to Bijou, so still okay. Just on an offer. Interesting. Lorna Mills money trail. How are we doing? I have about five minutes here, so apologies if I have to run through it looks like a car rolling through.
00:45:36.426 - 00:45:52.722, Speaker A: Beautiful work from Lorna Mills. 20 tazos edition of 32. Roccano color game. And here is the Game Boy color coming apart and together. I think I had one of those, the translucent purple one. Silva Santos. Look at this experimentation with Nintendo glitch rom.
00:45:52.722 - 00:46:11.226, Speaker A: Gamery. Very cool. Almost looks like a tapestry of sorts flow. And here is, I think it's called symbolic visions genesis. So just taking elements from a whole bunch of different games and putting them into one piece. Super interesting and cool. Seven tezos edition of ten.
00:46:11.226 - 00:46:42.724, Speaker A: And here is Pamelo Corono on Zora. So more just super cool music from Pamela. Here's another. Just very fun. I love the music in this scene. Very good musicians here. Marcel Munteanu with a couple here, c 25.
00:46:42.724 - 00:47:00.400, Speaker A: And here is c 24. So just playing with different elements here. Very segmented and structured. Vintage mirage facing uncertainty. Blotter nft edition of ten. So interesting work here. Almost has a bit of a popple feel to it.
00:47:00.400 - 00:47:15.444, Speaker A: Blotter nft. And here's Daenerys who did that. Awesome. Key to success work now is on Zora and doing very well. 137 minted here for this. Buy one, claim some dither glitter open edition until the end of times. Or, you know, Zora.
00:47:15.444 - 00:47:31.898, Speaker A: Very cool. And gogolitis is going to have a series on ETH. And this is a bit of a preview. So look at this. Nice big pixels, very cool. And here's chaz preparing error. So again, playing with the vintage computers, pixel art.
00:47:31.898 - 00:47:49.658, Speaker A: So continuing that series here. Edition of 15 for four tazos, $0.50 probably on secondary and bite by bit golf arena hole number 13. Edition of one at auction for five tezos. So continues to be super fun from bite by bit. And here's Skamra. Edition of 20.
00:47:49.658 - 00:48:07.384, Speaker A: Tree two. So again, using AI. But it's just. It would really hang well in the same show with Gozo there. It's got those same kind of AI textures, but doesn't feel quite like AI. Maybe they're both because they're both using stable diffusion, maybe. Very interesting.
00:48:07.384 - 00:48:38.698, Speaker A: Again, the software dictates the tools. Elsie, very excited to show summer daydream at Weir unit, London. So it's kind of hard to see. Let me see if I can make this bigger here. So as you can see here, looks like some kind of generative art, if I had to guess, but I'm not sure. It almost has a bit of a Monet meets Syrah meets almost. What is the name? Pizarro funfair sum with a couple of really beautiful AI artworks.
00:48:38.698 - 00:48:50.294, Speaker A: Really nicely done. Could illustrate children's book beautifully. Like fun, fair like. It's beautiful. It's beautiful. Beautiful. Some more great work from editions of ten for four tazos.
00:48:50.294 - 00:49:07.654, Speaker A: And what is Ayanna? Good day. This was burnt, I think, but I thought this was super interesting here. The textures that are being used by. What is Ayanna? Brilliant. I really like AI digital painting 44. Another Patrick Henry who I haven't seen before. Cloud painting.
00:49:07.654 - 00:49:20.626, Speaker A: This is a one of one for 55 tazos. I thought pretty, pretty cool. Beautiful pixelation here. Very kind of high res AI. Just really cool looking. Cloud painting. AI assisted in digital painting.
00:49:20.626 - 00:49:35.026, Speaker A: And here's another artist I hadn't seen. Neural rain. I'm not sure if it was like Cosmo de Medici had picked one up. I saw this on Twitter, quite liked it. Remind me of Yoain a little bit. They could hang in the same show there. Really cool work.
00:49:35.026 - 00:49:48.564, Speaker A: Dungeon and dropper and almost have to go here. Toques with a beautiful work. And then paper doll. Tomorrow's full moon edition of five. Beautiful work here. Sold out. There's magician Mikey Wilson.
00:49:48.564 - 00:50:01.744, Speaker A: Very nice work here from paper doll. And Danielle King. Bus stop. This is part of artificial Childhood Memories series. Check that out on Twitter. It's curated by Fort gallery NFT. So just another beautiful AI photo.
00:50:01.744 - 00:50:21.306, Speaker A: This is by walk, Mona Lisa. And I thought this was brilliant. You can see the Mona Lisa and then the crowd here in front. Brilliant work by walk. And here's Roon Christensen, who we've seen before as we go into physical works. Nugget brain with another brilliant work. And here is Donnie O'Donnell with what looks like a cat.
00:50:21.306 - 00:50:24.834, Speaker A: And that is your show, my friends, thank you for joining me. Until next time, take care.
