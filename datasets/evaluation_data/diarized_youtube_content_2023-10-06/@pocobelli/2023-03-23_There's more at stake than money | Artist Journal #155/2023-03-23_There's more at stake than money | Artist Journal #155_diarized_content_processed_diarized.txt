00:00:06.120 - 00:00:50.486, Speaker A: I used to let the music play more. Amid an uncertain world, we return here to look at the latest and greatest, really, the revolution that's going on. Interestingly, on the blockchain in digital art, a revolution in the visual arts. Welcome back, everyone. Artist's journal, March 23, 2023. My name is Adrian Pokebelly, and once again, we're gonna have to sprint through this episode because too many people are saying too many interesting things and too many artists are making too many beautiful works and more than beautiful, thought provoking works. So welcome back, everyone.
00:00:50.486 - 00:01:11.914, Speaker A: I am fresh from the gym, so I am also running behind schedule. So let's go. Joa in. That's how you pronounce the name joa in. Let me know. Maybe a few months ago, yo ain here with a stunning work of art. This is a combination of digital and AI.
00:01:11.914 - 00:01:50.888, Speaker A: And I'm kind of back to the textures. I mean, there's something kind of, like, when I look at this, I see something kind of weirdly Picasso esque in a kind of demoiselle d'avignon kind of way. You know, one of the most famous, provocative works of 20th century art. Like, it just kind of echoes that kind of composition. You know, you have a few figures. The colors are trademark yoain. And I'm back to these textures here, these wonderful, beautiful textures.
00:01:50.888 - 00:02:07.768, Speaker A: Maybe we can make them bigger with my new mouse. I got the magic mouse. Thanks, mom. Shout out to mom, who, yeah, look at these textures. Although I'm not sure I know how to move around here. Um, yeah, so here we go. We can just do that.
00:02:07.768 - 00:02:48.570, Speaker A: So anyways, it almost looks like what I associate with Del e kind of textures here. We see it with Aile's work. I think she uses Delhi. And we also see it with sum, these kind of very texture ish kind of works here, kind of mark making. Who knows what yoa in uses, but that is what it makes me think of. So, I mean, just a stunning work of art and kind of in that, you know, that special zone here where. Where this hybrid where AI and digital painting work together.
00:02:48.570 - 00:03:53.390, Speaker A: To me, that's one of the kind of promised lands in this space. And we were discussing it on the spaces yesterday, how I love writing as a, as a kind of, as a way of understanding what AI is and what it does, so called AI, because with writing, we see a very simple, straightforward example. So if I put in, you know, as I was saying, I can put in, I can get the transcript of this show, and then whatever we're discussing, I can take those two paragraphs, if there's some topic, say form function, and then, you know, discussing form function shutting down, and then you can feed that into chat GPT and it's going to give you an article. But the problem with that, when you look at it, is it's too, there's a lot of sentences that you can get rid of. So this is why I think, like, the editor is a million dollar job. But my point is what you need is a hybrid, because it's not good enough, in my opinion. I can't release an article like that.
00:03:53.390 - 00:04:42.684, Speaker A: I think some people might be tempted because it is almost good enough, but there are too many sentences and there are word changes that can make it better and just kind of more personal, personalized. And so when I see Joa in doing this kind of digital painting with AI, that's kind of the promise. That's kind of why I'm kind of so excited about that area, because it's sort of like writing, you know? But although I think raw AI art has it, it has its place, as we've clearly seen, there is no debate about that. There is some stunning raw AI, and it has its own kind of qualities that we can enjoy. I'm not sure that translates to writing, though. Okay. So anyways, a really cool work by Joa in.
00:04:42.684 - 00:05:05.004, Speaker A: It's actually really cheap, I mean, at least for the reserve 0.69 when you consider it. This was minted yesterday, so very cool. For what? Nft La World. Maybe we'll just quickly look at that. And this is curated by super chief Gallery, Nft La World. So here we go.
00:05:05.004 - 00:05:28.970, Speaker A: And another world. And we're going to hear more about curation this episode. And I am not running through this episode so far, am I? So I'm going to have to pick up the pace. This is interesting, isn't it? So look at Joa in's work, which just. Yeah, it just screams at you off the page. Gossip goblin. So anyways, pretty interesting stuff to see what's going on out there.
00:05:28.970 - 00:06:15.216, Speaker A: A stunning, stunning, stunning work. Here's just some other stuff I haven't seen all of yo in's work, and this was posted. Maybe this is a work in progress, maybe it's an old work, I'm not sure, but more just kind of interesting work here. So this is a GM from the 21st, so a couple of days ago. And here's a work. I'm not sure if we covered it or not on February 23, last dance we probably did, but I don't quite recall seeing this. So anyways, you almost see a Guernica in the like, I kind of wonder if Picasso is involved in these prompts because there is kind of a Picasso line work that I see here.
00:06:15.216 - 00:06:46.978, Speaker A: There's something about this, about Yohain's work that kind of says, shouts a little bit Picasso to me. And I almost feel like, you see it here in the top right? It feels like Guernica over there. And you almost see a face calling up, you know? So anyway, it's gorgeous work and a reserve of one ETH and still available. So very cool. Thank you, everybody who came out yesterday, you can tell I need a vacation because I forgot to press record before you set it up. There's a little knob. And I was sure I had done it.
00:06:46.978 - 00:07:03.682, Speaker A: I had not done it. So, unfortunately, that one is lost in time. So you would have had to have been there live. But it was a fascinating episode. What are your favorite art tools? And again, not bad. When 59 people are showing up to discuss this. I'm thrilled.
00:07:03.682 - 00:07:37.412, Speaker A: And, yeah, I mean, some really interesting things were said. If I could summarize, I mean, what I can remember off the top of my head here, it was sort of like, I mean, the things. My takeaways were a couple of things. There was Tammy, who, with her AI prompts, she uses. She prefers mid journey. She says she writes, like, in the neighborhood of 500 words. So, like, that's like a page and a half, double spaced, 500 words for a prompt.
00:07:37.412 - 00:08:12.694, Speaker A: So that was news to me. There was a painting app that was mentioned, I think, rebel painting app, which sounded interesting. There's a great pixel art app that I was mentioning that I use on the iPad, because we don't have aseprite. I think it's called Pixaki, P I x a, maybe ki. And so there was that. And there's also just this idea how, you know, it's almost like we've been discussing how the curator and the collector and the artist are kind of all starting to get blended together. But now we're almost seen with a 500 word AI prompt.
00:08:12.694 - 00:08:53.368, Speaker A: And Tammy, I think, was mentioning a friend who's a copywriter who is releasing work, and you're almost seeing the writer, the artist, and you could argue the movie maker also start to blend into one thing. And I was like, this is almost like the term that we hear in ad agencies a lot. The creative, it's almost all just, like, blending together into this, you know, kind of what I've always considered a bit of a corporate word, but I have no problem with it. The creative. So anyways, it was a great discussion. Thank you everybody for attending. And yeah, vacation, quick show note, vacation in April 1 here.
00:08:53.368 - 00:09:20.110, Speaker A: So in about a week and a half, I will be off to Tuscany and that will be glorious. And so I'm going to take a week off there. I may still do the, the Twitter spaces, though. Let's keep that open. So just a comment from Sabato regarding the Lego because we're discussing, and shout out to San Diego who put out that hilarious screenshot. I should have brought it up here of me discussing the Lego. That was hilarious.
00:09:20.110 - 00:10:08.168, Speaker A: Anyways, so Sabato had this great comment and it's regarding these kind of sets here. Okay, so maybe it's good that we look at this. This is an article I wrote and I was going to get to this after, but just so you guys know what we're talking about, when I read Sabato's comet, this gorgeousness here, these are like, you know, iconic images from the early eighties. Again, these smiling spacemen here, these smiling astronauts. And we're discussing how Lego had transformed over the years from this really optimistic, kind of fun, really simple and beautiful, you know, aesthetic to here. It's kind of like here you see the unhappy guys. They're pointing guns at you.
00:10:08.168 - 00:10:38.692, Speaker A: It's Star wars, it's corporate IP, you know, here's the more unhappy guys. And then you go back and you see the stuff from the eighties and it's just so beautiful, international and optimistic. And you see even just the design, the planet behind the Lego, it's masterpieces of design. So that is the context here. Sabato. Aw, man, I missed out on that one of one, the homage to these sets that I had made. It's so great, 100% with you on the eighties Lego.
00:10:38.692 - 00:11:11.192, Speaker A: I had those spaceship sets as a kid and they were so much fun to play with. I'm with you. That the whole vibe shifted in the mid to late nineties when they started painting more detailed expressions on the Lego person's faces. The underwater exploration sets were the last ones I really enjoyed because after that, more and more Lego sets featured Hollywood movie crossovers. The space Legos were all replaced with Star wars. And today, I think most of the Lego products are tied to some corporate IP intellectual property. Maybe it's just me, but I think that limits the imagination of a child.
00:11:11.192 - 00:11:42.398, Speaker A: I completely agree. It's different when you have to make up the whole backstory for your Lego guy who is stuck in outer space compared to playing with Lego Anakin and Lego Darth Vader who already have all this lore trademark attached to them anyways, cures. So thank you for the comment, Sabato. That is, you said a lot of what I have been feeling for a while and that I wrote in this essay. And thank you everybody else for the comments here as well. They're all appreciated. This was written in I posted this in 2011.
00:11:42.398 - 00:12:12.704, Speaker A: I think it was actually written before that. But anyway, so this is an old estate old essay. Why is old Lego so much better than new Lego? I'm gonna post this in the description, a link to it if anybody is interested. What you'll see Sabato, if you're watching or anybody else, is a lot of the same points that Sabato makes is here. So anyway, I'm glad to hear and I got a this was just kinda. I didn't really promote this article at all. It's gotten some comments over the years which, which is kind of interesting.
00:12:12.704 - 00:12:38.168, Speaker A: Like it hits a nerve, that whole subject matter, which is why I'm discussing it. Popple, thanks for talking about my stuff. Pokebelly about boutique art. It's like Linktree for Tezos artists and collectors for the Tezos artist collector. I find it a neat tool to quickly build portfolio pages based on creations on Tezos. Surprisingly, not more people are using it, considering most of us here are Tezo centric. So that is more info.
00:12:38.168 - 00:13:09.140, Speaker A: And thank you for the comment. Popple an axing. I mean, it's I feel so honored that all these artists are replying to this show like it's a real honor. And this is hilarious. I mean, I was trying to get. I had the axeen there that was flashing, and I was trying to get both images. Well, Axeen has very nicely provided the other image that was flashing in the image that I had in the GiF that I was trying to pause.
00:13:09.140 - 00:13:29.144, Speaker A: So there it is. It is green. Interesting colors, isn't it? So you see how rough and beautiful oxygen's work is. Really, I just want to say, like, he makes very smart art and I love it. A couple of other things. I mean, there's too much interesting things being said here, guys. And there's a ton of beautiful art to look at here, too.
00:13:29.144 - 00:14:00.200, Speaker A: The first thing that we showed, it was a difficult decision. There's a lot of great art in this episode. Unknown collector the last thing I'd ever do is curate to just collect sales. Some people will put sales over actual curation, in their judgment. Yeah. So this is kind of like the other side of this foundation worlds curated space thing. Because there is an incentive for the curator to bring in work that's going to sell because they get their commission.
00:14:00.200 - 00:14:43.048, Speaker A: And so it's almost like, is this curation? I think some purists in the curation world might say, which is why we're looking at definitions. I think it is a kind of curation, but it does definitely impact the nature of the curation. I think undeniably I'm curating as part of art, trying to achieve a beautiful flow between artists, artworks and curation. Randomly putting artists that sell well together is nothing for me but a popularity game. I think Santiago had a nice word for it, which maybe a more neutral word for it, which is showcasing. It's showcasing. If you want to support pure art, check out and share my foundation world unknown self with zero commission.
00:14:43.048 - 00:15:19.894, Speaker A: By the way, I didn't know you could do zero commission. Everything stays with the artist link in my bio. So interesting thought, I think because I think the unknown collector is kind of targeting a kind of attention, for lack a better word, that exists with these curated worlds, which is the whole financial component. And I was bringing this up in a spaces a week and a half ago, like a week ago, that, you know, curators might think we're just all about money out here. And it's kind of a. It's not a terrible criticism. It's not an unfounded criticism, as we're going to see here.
00:15:19.894 - 00:16:16.946, Speaker A: And unknown collector posted, I think he was replying to this tweet that we just looked at to make it clear because I felt it wasn't after reading one of my last tweets. Again, the beauty of decentralized curation with foundation worlds is that everyone could do it like they want. Totally agree. They can just chase sales or they can put their favorite artists together, or they can curate with a theme. And as a more whole experience, like I prefer to, and I agree, let freedom reign and, you know, the market, there's something to be said for the market because, and for money, I mean, we shouldn't be purists and think, oh, money shouldn't matter at all. Because I would argue, and I think it's actually self evident and obvious that this scene wouldn't be nearly as evolved, we wouldn't have nearly as much art if there wasn't a financial incentive. So, you know, if people weren't making money, I'm not convinced that we're going to have the same output here.
00:16:16.946 - 00:16:39.100, Speaker A: So there's something to be said for money. Right. So it's kind of a balancing act. I think it's great. You know, and in the history of art, you know, the Medicis were bankers, right? So that has to be kept into mind here. That has to be, you know, we can't be purists about this either. It doesn't matter.
00:16:39.100 - 00:17:05.310, Speaker A: Everything is valid. And just because I have other preferences, it doesn't make those other ways less valid. Worlds are open to interpret in your own way, as a world builder, this freedom is built into the concept, and I think, beautifully put. And I think if you become someone who puts together brilliant shows with no regard to money, you'll get rewarded for that. Maybe, anyway, because people will go, those are fantastic shows. So big props that could work. That's.
00:17:05.310 - 00:17:41.100, Speaker A: Maybe that's playing the long game, you could argue. Big props to foundation. They're always innovative, innovating, and love how they keep building no matter how the market is acting up. Totally agree. I mean, again, I kind of felt like, as a brand, I kind of felt foundation, and this is totally not a, you know, it's just a sense. I had a sense that basically, foundation was almost left for dead a year ago and they kept building. And now, I mean, I think they're doing pretty impressive.
00:17:41.100 - 00:18:27.050, Speaker A: We'll have to get Igor, get some more numbers for us because they didn't seem to be doing too badly at all. Here's another comment and going to run through this. Captain Mori, unless certain collectors back your curated world on foundation, it's extremely hard for the artists you're working with to get bids. So kind of feeling like, you know, it's not an easy game if you're not kind of in the right circles. From the sounds of it, there's no reason some worlds are struggling to get recognition while other worlds catch 15 bids off rip within minutes of launching, certain curated worlds are catching bids like they're trying to pump a PFP project. I'll come across jaded because I'm really trying to understand the quality of the art isn't the issue. The artists aren't the issue.
00:18:27.050 - 00:19:12.684, Speaker A: So what's the issue? Should we all get burner wallets and self bid our own pieces to drive hype? Should we throw 50 artists into one curated world that don't fit thematically together to drive FOMo? So kind of pointing out this, you know, again, this financial component, and what does it mean if your artists aren't selling? I'm serious, because this doesn't make sense. Come on. We all see each other's tweets. Whether we're engaging with them or not. We all see each other on a daily basis because the space is extremely small and niche. Surprisingly, considering how much money is involved and how much it costs to get your tools together and make work. This is a surprisingly small scene, and it may not last like this in one way or another, whether they ban crypto or whether millions of people join us here.
00:19:12.684 - 00:19:50.404, Speaker A: If quality was truly rewarded in this space, a lot more artists would be getting bids, not just the ones backed by certain collectors. This could all be in my head, and I'm just delusional and salty. Well, you know, my take is, I think the important thing is to not focus so much on the money. The money is great. I think it's great if, you know, I've sold for more money in NFTs, in the bull market there than I'd ever sold on my own. Selling physical art, spending my entire life as an artist. So money is great, but you can't.
00:19:50.404 - 00:20:12.738, Speaker A: I don't think you can worry about it. You kind of have to be about the art, in my opinion. So I wouldn't worry about it because I think you just keep doing your thing, you know, is what I would say. I wouldn't worry about it so much. It doesn't need to sell. I mean, that shouldn't be seen. It's a form of kind of feeling legitimate.
00:20:12.738 - 00:20:28.602, Speaker A: You mean legitimized to a certain degree. But it's not like it shouldn't be your be all and end all. And you should have enough conviction in your. Whatever you're doing that even if it doesn't sell, that's okay. That's sort of. And finally, there's so many comments on this scene. It's great, though.
00:20:28.602 - 00:20:58.228, Speaker A: I mean, this is like a newspaper unto a newspaper of the imagination, as we keep saying. Deltasauce, prominent AI artist who's done very well. Remember that massive manifold XYz sale? We gatekeep ourselves. But by putting these supposed rules down as the right thing to do, or the thing we must do. At times it feels like we're all walking this tightrope, and it can be quite exhausting. Don't put too much art out. Slowly raise your floor prices over time.
00:20:58.228 - 00:21:41.958, Speaker A: Don't get on the bad side of collectors. Feels very artificial. Like we're all trying to fit into a box of conformity to what works. Yeah, exactly. I don't exactly like. I'm kind of back to where we were before, which is you have to focus on your art and frankly, on the big picture, because ideally, what we're involved in here is much bigger than money. As I was saying in the interview with Die with the most likes and threesomes on their podcast, the reason for me personally, I kind of feel like it's easy to not make it about money is because I feel like what's happening here is perhaps way more important than if I live in some bigger house or something like that.
00:21:41.958 - 00:22:21.642, Speaker A: So I would, you know, let the. I think people and collectors and, you know, collectors are different, different kinds of people. I think they're going to see. Some of them are going to see an authentic person, artist making their work, and they're gonna reward you, maybe, you know, so, I mean, you can play this game, but to me, this is the short game. You know, if you start worrying about floor prices and you should be conscious, you should, you know, you are a business person. You are developing an entrepreneurial venture, so you shouldn't ignore these things. You should take care to, you know, people who've bought your work and then don't super undercut it.
00:22:21.642 - 00:23:02.650, Speaker A: But that's just managing your business, you know, not trying to conform, because I think it easily turns into, you know, people trying to conform. So, anyways, interesting comment, deltasauce. And finally, I mean, money, money. Grant Riven Yoon I think about this chart from BSY a lot at the time. I did not factor in, in that this is a dynamic relationship. More so than we passed the PFP phase for good, especially looking at project volumes on Dune for the past three months. So anyways, Nft money flow, and what you see is at the top, PFP projects, profile picture projects, crypto punk sport, API club, etcetera.
00:23:02.650 - 00:23:40.524, Speaker A: And then generative art projects and fidenzas, autoglyphs, and then one of one art, super rare foundation, async, etcetera. And it seems, yeah, money seems to flow. I mean, it's true. Like, I was listening to, I'm editing these older Twitter spaces that I did in January with Joe Rogan's dad. And what was I gonna say about that? I actually lost my train of thought there. Anyways, all to say, let's move on here. The money and the time.
00:23:40.524 - 00:23:59.462, Speaker A: Yeah, let's just continue. It's vacation time, folks. Thank you for the patience, everybody out there. I am editing those Spotify episodes, by the way. Look at this really cool work by Louis Osborne. Sticker bomb zero one. So one of my favorite themes.
00:23:59.462 - 00:24:33.824, Speaker A: Shout out to runetune, traveling through the mediums. Mediums. Sticker bomb Zero one is ready to go. This piece will be used as a burn token to redeem the individual animated stickers holders will be given the option to receive the physical version of the individual stickers they own. So, first of all, just a really cool image. And it looks like, interestingly, this digital image is almost composed of, like, sticker like images, right? And probably taken. They look like they're taken from Louis Osborne's oeuvre.
00:24:33.824 - 00:25:07.854, Speaker A: Let's just look here. The stickers will drop in sets of four every following Monday. At the same time, they have been grouped into tiers, which will require x amount of burn. So all this burning and stuff, though, the crypto world loves its kind of mechanics. Its burn mechanics. And, I mean, it's kind of a. It's a double edged sword, this financial side of things, because it's actually pretty cool and pretty fun, all this, like, what, say, Louis Osborne is doing here and playing with the burn and all this sort of thing, the burn mechanics.
00:25:07.854 - 00:25:46.114, Speaker A: So anyways, there are stickers, and here they are, one burn to redeem. And then you burn two of these, you get the 10 April. So you have to buy, like, six of these things, as far as I understand, if you want to collect all the stickers and then to mint it is zero one. So maybe it will cost you $100 to mint as many as you need in order to get all your stickers. I wonder how he's going to deliver the stickers, how they'll be sent out. So that'll be interesting. And Lucas Jan, Lucas Migone, just with some work in progress here.
00:25:46.114 - 00:26:24.076, Speaker A: Gonna mute that. So anyways, I thought just we all, most of us will recognize this artist's work. And we see him in the studio here, and it's very cool. Looks like he's working in Photoshop. Interestingly, he is. So we recognize from all those, you know, works of, you know, skeletal figures kind of dancing and anyway, just really nice to see these works in progress like that. And Rada, there's a ton of, like, show notes here before we go into our paintings, but we're almost done here.
00:26:24.076 - 00:26:50.724, Speaker A: I have to, you know, this is really cool. Like, I mean, Rada showing how the bull, as far as I understand, what's going on here, he's showing how the bull is mirroring the landscape. I mean, this is. I think this is a traditional. This is almost like renaissance style painting, where the sub, you know, where it all kind of. This is how it all works together, the composition. And you get these, I think you see it in, you know, artists like Raphael.
00:26:50.724 - 00:27:19.456, Speaker A: So here's Rada, you know, again, high end pixel art, GM. So just very cool. To see that. And also Absil, this is a friend of Ezra Eslin, and she was just basically saying, he's new, or I don't know. Actually, Absal is new on Twitter. New account here, and my mom thinks I'm cool. Anyways, we've seen Absal's work before, I think on super rare.
00:27:19.456 - 00:27:50.490, Speaker A: So pretty cool artist. And you gotta like the addition of these kind of windows, windows 95 type windows operating system. Here's another one, a little edgier, and just some different portraits, and then cubicles, a little bit of financial charts here, maybe a nod to crypto. And then these windows almost. So there's a lot going on here. You see the old recycling bin that's pixelated here. A lot going on here with this artist.
00:27:50.490 - 00:28:21.736, Speaker A: And here's another one. You're all equal, but some are more equal than others. Metaverse stream so just kind of an interesting artist. Just kind of. A few people were posting because Abd Lissol now has a Twitter account, probably because you have to have a Twitter account in this scene, don't you? And also, I thought this was really cool. Rinny Fish flying to Cali. So not sure what the deal is if this is a print or if she did this physically, but it looks really cool.
00:28:21.736 - 00:28:58.412, Speaker A: So here's a physical version, and this is really cool too. I mean, whatever is going on here. So I'm not sure what is going on, if this is physically done or if this is a printout, but it looks great. And it's just really interesting to see physical renditions of digital work. I think the next Twitter spaces, we're going to discuss this idea of how to get to the physical. And, you know, should we make physical work? And that whole discussion. And how does one go about making physical work from digital? It's an interesting conversation.
00:28:58.412 - 00:29:20.834, Speaker A: So I'm thinking next spaces, unless anything pressing comes up. And then here, look at Rosatio's work here. This is at digital theater of digital art, Dubai. And you're going to see Rosatio. There's Rosatio's work here. So of course, we've seen this on this program. There's the Jeff Koons balloon dog, Rosatio.
00:29:20.834 - 00:29:41.048, Speaker A: So look at how incredible that looks. And as I always say, the alchemy of scale. You see how fantastic these works. Look when you make them big, and you can make them big. So, you know, need a t shirt. Like, tvs are a crime as far as digital art. And I'm exaggerating.
00:29:41.048 - 00:30:19.184, Speaker A: Sometimes you just gotta do it to make it work. And also, Roger House, he had this cool, here's a preview of it. Kind of like a cool trading card anime manga series here. And it looks like he used AI to make it. Anyways, I just think it's. They're pretty attractive, aren't they? You know, there I spent like four or five years doing the peloponnesian war two heart 200 work trading card set. And then here, Roger house, like maybe a lot quicker than me, has put out 40 images high, and they look great.
00:30:19.184 - 00:30:43.104, Speaker A: So even the preview thing. So this is doing a collection kind of like, you know, as Grant Rivigny was talking about, the pfps. The pfps are kind of bleeding into foundation a little bit here, though, aren't they? And I think I find that interesting. I like all this stuff getting mixed together personally. So very cool. So onto the painting. So rare released this work.
00:30:43.104 - 00:31:02.384, Speaker A: This is part of the Pablo Punkasso drop, my new edition Cerberus drops. And this was done a couple of days ago. So this already dropped 100 additions. 50 airdrop to Pablo Puncaso passholders. 50 others can be bought for 0.1. Allow list will run from 09:00 a.m. To nine PST.
00:31:02.384 - 00:31:37.774, Speaker A: Any not sold will then be open to the public. So anyways, cool work here. Let's take a closer look. And this is one of the things that, you know, I really like about rare is the pr, the public relations, like, taking the time to put the work up in a way that looks kind of really attractive in a gallery like this, I think is a brilliant idea. When he first did that, I thought it was real. I was like, did he just, you know. But I think it's just how he kind of sells the work, so to speak, as an image, how he presents the work, I should say.
00:31:37.774 - 00:32:10.070, Speaker A: So anyways, these all minted out, sold out. Congratulations. 100 at, you know, $880, I guess, 50 at $180. And the other to the Pablo pump castle holders. But that is a nice payday in a really interesting rendition, where sometimes rare shows, you know, the movement a little bit. And here you see the dog's head, the Boston dynamics dog head, kind of moving back and forth, almost like a real dog. And you even see this great brushwork here.
00:32:10.070 - 00:32:44.818, Speaker A: And you have the where's rare poster. And there's Pablo Puncaso, probably here. So just a lot of very smart work here. And this was just put together, I think, in the last week or so because, remember, he scrapped his previous work that he's struggling with, started the new one found a great composition. And off he goes. Hilarious work by Beziah Greg. Greg is, of course, for those that might not know, Greg is a kind of a legendary figure on Twitter.
00:32:44.818 - 00:33:10.616, Speaker A: Kind of like the ultimate, I don't know, meme guy and a hilarious Twitter account. And so Bezaya, very wisely, has done a portrait of Greg. And I believe this is on super rare. And putting all of Bezaya's kind of classic tropes here. The Gucci, Gucci belt. The colors are classic bezaya. Even the hat is hilarious there.
00:33:10.616 - 00:33:24.454, Speaker A: So just kind of cool with some interesting hands, gestures. Not exactly sure what that means. I'm bizaya. I like to paint in pink and find streetwear and have fun. From Argentina. I'm an artist. I like to mint on NFts on the blockchain.
00:33:24.454 - 00:34:01.914, Speaker A: So I wonder if he's making. I think there's two things going on at work in my sort of interpretation of the description. I think he might be kind of making fun of how Greg talks or making light of and maybe just parodying it a little bit. But also, he's also introducing himself because this could go viral, this kind of thing, a painting of Greg. And so anyways, this is kind of a smart description because whoever comes across it will then learn who buzziah is. So anyways, very cool work. And the myth with interesting, kind of edgy work, as the myth tends to do.
00:34:01.914 - 00:34:24.504, Speaker A: What is this called again? Let's get a title on this. Lord of Saturn, one of the masters that fills our beloved myth with knowledge and wisdom. So probably a friend of the myth. Pretty interesting work with a huge head and a gun pointing at us. So interesting. Looks like it was made with procreate. Based on the textures that I'm seeing, particularly in here.
00:34:24.504 - 00:35:01.506, Speaker A: So this does not look like a Microsoft paintwork. And, of course, we see the roughness here. Anyway, really cool composition. I have to say, I didn't notice this before, but these, I love how the reflections in the river, what should be a river or could be a river, how similar they look to the clouds here. So an interesting mirroring, again, kind of reminiscent of what we're seeing with rada there, kind of like the landscape emulating the bull. Here's a different kind of mirroring. And you will see that in kind of classic Renaissance painting a lot, these kind of mirrorings in the Raphael's lamentation.
00:35:01.506 - 00:35:27.564, Speaker A: We do not have time to go through it, but let's go through that sometime soon or. Sorry. The deposition, I think, is what it's called. Which is in the Galleria borges in Rome. That's stunning work. There's all sorts of mirrorings going on. So anyways, very cool work from the myth collect for 20 tezos.
00:35:27.564 - 00:35:43.324, Speaker A: And let's continue editions. Eleven of 15. I think eleven are left, so we still got a few left. A very dark work from Ratcloaksea. It's great to hear from Ratcloak GM. New drop today. Kind of double meaning on drop there.
00:35:43.324 - 00:36:07.602, Speaker A: So a very, very dark work, expertly painted here. So it'll be interesting to see where he posts this. Probably on super air, but who knows? Classic rat cloak. See colors here. And even the iconography is actually is not new to Ratcloaksea. So very dark, beautiful texture on the walls here. Kind of looks like a Microsoft paintwork based on the edginess.
00:36:07.602 - 00:36:29.534, Speaker A: See, almost the square brush here. So anyways, maybe it's combining more than one software, but kind of looks like it actually looks like two different kinds of software. Who knows? Anyways, Newark from Rec cloak, wasteman, goldmine of ish. We're gonna have to run through the rest of this episode. American ruse, bad optics. So just an interesting painting here. Kind of a different.
00:36:29.534 - 00:36:48.146, Speaker A: I don't want to say a different style, but kind of a somewhat different style. I think he's already worked with digital painting here before. Anyways, kind of a. It's different from the failed artists series, let's put it that way. It's the same artist, but you can see the McDonald's there. Maybe joins everything together. They all share McDonald's together.
00:36:48.146 - 00:37:16.812, Speaker A: And look at stalker. I'm a big fan of Stalka and cosmic. The beginning is now live. Great to see her have work again. This is on Nifty Gateway, so that's cool. And anyway, just a really interesting artist here with this kind of almost ring around the rosy, kind of almost a witchcraft kind of feel to it, perhaps. And schoolgirls at night and this strange figure with the sword and the pink skin and the spiders.
00:37:16.812 - 00:37:36.160, Speaker A: On and on you can go. Pink stars. Amazing. Mikey Wilson, rustic digital art. The long awaited collaboration. And it did not disappoint here with the mayhem. And it looks pretty cool, doesn't it? It's like a video game, as we can see at the start.
00:37:36.160 - 00:37:58.534, Speaker A: Almost like Burr selectors. Burstector's you win. Kind of has that feel to it. Mikey Times rustic 2023. A reference maybe to Mario. And we have these crop Marios and someone who looks like they're riding a horse of crop made out of crop Marios. And then just so this irrationality that we know and love from rustic digital art continues here.
00:37:58.534 - 00:38:15.034, Speaker A: And then a reference to Zelda, I think, that is, and then a highway. Anyways. And there's the clouds and the Mario boxes and everything. Just an interesting work here. Let's see if anything has happened yet with this. Just offers coming in. The offers have begun.
00:38:15.034 - 00:38:51.332, Speaker A: Very interesting work, isn't it? Ram by Ed Morolla. So continuing these interesting colors, and what I found really interesting about this is it almost reminds me of a photo I've been looking at pictures of the Mona Lisa, which I've been just kind of combining together for the. What is that? Composite series. But anyways, when I was looking at these different renditions of the Mona Lisa, one of the things you notice is of these photos of oil paintings is this almost looks, like reminiscent of the reflections you'll see oftentimes, the light. And that's what that reminds me of. So this is called Ram. And, yeah, it's.
00:38:51.332 - 00:39:23.678, Speaker A: I'd say it's almost abstract here because it's not quite clear if this is a ram here and there's maybe a fire, really? Or is this the ram here with the horns? Hard to say, but there's something kind of special about it. 90 tezos, one of one on object. And this was interesting, too. So. By Ed Marolla as well. And just interesting, you know, adding dithering to the mix here. So a more dithered piece.
00:39:23.678 - 00:39:47.088, Speaker A: But again, these great textures and classic, you know, the classic purple of Edmorola here returns and think about you in my dream. So another one of one for 90 tazos. And then you see this image back here. And this is what I want to show you here. Techniques. This is really interesting. The central image is AI generated.
00:39:47.088 - 00:40:28.946, Speaker A: So this image here imported into procreate. The rest of it is done in procreate, finishing an upscale in aseprite. So going through a few different techniques here and apps, which I'm a huge fan of. Again, that episode with Joe Rogan's dad that I was just telling you about on Spotify, Sky Goodman, maybe this is what I was going to mention. Sky Goodman discusses their process in that episode, and it's how exporting from app to app to apply it really just kind of creates a work that feels very sky Goodman. Not okay. Here's your procreate work.
00:40:28.946 - 00:40:43.014, Speaker A: Here's your. You know, there's the ace bright artist. When you start exporting through to everything, it's. That's Ed Marolla work that's a sky Goodman work. So anyways, interesting. Thanks for sharing, Ed. Super interesting.
00:40:43.014 - 00:41:05.094, Speaker A: Yuri J. The bedspread. I like how this kind of has a bit of a french impressionist sort of feel to it in terms of the title and the subject matter. It's almost something like Edouard Manet would do or something. So not this time. This is Uri J. And there is what seems to be the bed spread with this almost couch bed and all of this experimentation here.
00:41:05.094 - 00:41:18.434, Speaker A: This is on super rare and it's not expensive. It's 0.2 ETH, $350 the bed spread. So very cool. New work from Uri J. Just minted on the 21st. Very nice.
00:41:18.434 - 00:42:00.092, Speaker A: Santiago with a couple of scientific speculative works, fake science, as he's calling it, possible cells, text to image and gimp. So here is, and I think text to image is Santiago's way of saying AI, because I don't think he necessarily agrees with this idea of calling it AI. So again, we're seeing like kind of anatomical and scientific biological imagery and just kind of colored and interestingly depicted here. Here's another one. Possible cell number two. So I just kind of like the speculative scientific aspect. I like bringing science and the imagery, the iconography of science into the work.
00:42:00.092 - 00:42:32.132, Speaker A: It kind of gives it a, even if it's kind of fake science, it gives it a kind of relevance of sorts. So, very interesting idea for a series. Possible cell number two. And Flora Marquez with a super cool monster here. Six eyes and four arms and hard to say how many legs, four legs and some bones here. And eating these apples that have been personified here. Something has to be offered to the monster of the seasonal change.
00:42:32.132 - 00:43:00.544, Speaker A: So maybe making reference done on the 21st, making reference to the first day of spring there. Actually, that was the 20th. And a hilarious kind of play on the wave. Haku sai Hakusai's wave. Good meat by die with the most likes. Turning it into ground beef, probably his favorite image or subject matter. And gloom tube solutions for a changing world.
00:43:00.544 - 00:43:26.856, Speaker A: So, interestingly. So here's this financial guy pointing way down at us. And there is the sun in this kind of polluted sky here and money raining down. So money is the subject of the hour here. Again, playing with these textures here, which is interesting. And this guy in a suit and everything. Solutions for a changing world.
00:43:26.856 - 00:43:41.918, Speaker A: A thousand tezos. Is that gloom tube sprites? It very well may be. It is. So gloom tube raising the prices on the one of one here by now is still available. Daniel W. Pink on blue. So starting.
00:43:41.918 - 00:44:04.094, Speaker A: And you see like almost like these physical textures here, but I think it's digital, digitally rendered, digitally created. And there's a cigarette. So anyways, playing with interesting zooming up close. And you see it here in this other work here, too. Blue on pink and pink on blue. So interesting little series here. It'll be interesting to see if he continues.
00:44:04.094 - 00:44:32.452, Speaker A: And then Michael Macasso with a new landscape, pixel art landscape with some beautiful colors. I particularly love the pink on the red here. That is gorgeous in the reflection here. Is there anything I'm putting my best shot on discipline and natural growth daily with occasional visits to my roots. Very nice. And look at this holographic factory by gogolitis, edition of 20. So a pretty wild work.
00:44:32.452 - 00:44:58.502, Speaker A: And the color, again, is fascinating here. And you're starting to see this pixel art factory trope start to break down a little bit and turn into these bricks here and everything. So just super interesting experimentation from gogolitis. Love the frame too. So very interesting. And I think this has something to do. You see all these triangles here, I think he mentioned in a tweet.
00:44:58.502 - 00:45:21.930, Speaker A: This has something to do with a, I believe, a fractal. So interesting. Now look at. Look at Sabato. I mean, we could almost. We could have started with so many of these images, right? So Sabato's noun, I think we already looked at the noun, but it went on auction when. I'm not sure if we looked at it or if.
00:45:21.930 - 00:45:41.666, Speaker A: Because it might have just went on auction. Either way, I think we did look at it. I'm sure we did, actually. So this went for. There's a big auction war for it. These two accounts went from, basically from 210 all the way up to 609. So when you have a one of one, it's kind of.
00:45:41.666 - 00:46:08.064, Speaker A: It's kind of really dramatic to watch that stuff and look at how the price is being raised here, you know, 400 and 5469. 499. And then this account's like, screw it, 555. And then it's like, this guy's not, or this person is not letting it go. And 609 would have been interesting to see how far that would have gone had the other bidder continued. So part of the Tez nouns series. Super interesting.
00:46:08.064 - 00:46:24.214, Speaker A: Again, so many works that you could start with in this program. La reine de Bijou. I believe the queen of jewels would be the translation there. Beware of it. What you're offered for. Everything's ever changing. The world is full of secrets and the unknown is always ranging.
00:46:24.214 - 00:46:50.224, Speaker A: So I thought this was a gorgeous work by popple. Here, part of this monster series. And you could almost see, like, these. This, like, almost severed spinal cord here of this monster. Again, just kind of, you know, magical. And I don't know if totemic's the right word, but just kind of. Yeah, just kind of gorgeous, magical stuff.
00:46:50.224 - 00:47:09.222, Speaker A: From popple, 900 by 900 pixels edition of one. I think it sold out right away, yet 250 tezos sold in three minutes. So someone made the offer and popple accepted. Bijou made an offer, and it was accepted. Okay, so there we. That's what happened. Nice one of one.
00:47:09.222 - 00:47:30.502, Speaker A: And here, I think. Let me see if we can. I just wanted to go up close on this, just so we can see what's going on here. And these beautiful colors here. So just beautiful kind of shimmering movement here. And this big crown, this mysterious queen. So pretty cool, if you ask me.
00:47:30.502 - 00:47:49.688, Speaker A: Great color. Francoise gammer, continuing the super interesting experimentation. Lat crew. So here's the walking person. Okay. It's amazing. Like, I mean, isn't it incredible how much work comes out since, like, when I do the spaces on the Wednesday, that gives us, like, 48 hours, almost 72.
00:47:49.688 - 00:48:11.890, Speaker A: And it's like, there's so much work. Here's another one by Francois Gammer, continuing the exploration of the person walking. Lacru zero two. Very interesting. And here's another one. Branch grasp. Because it's like, what works are you going to leave out? You know? So here's a beautiful pixel artwork of what seems like a plant, a branch, maybe.
00:48:11.890 - 00:48:28.686, Speaker A: So very interesting. Tom bombadil radiation. So a new one from Tom Bombadil. Looks like a guy at a gas station here on his motorbike and some bit of a sci-Fi feeling. Again, these clouds are gorgeous. These four to the floor. Explore.
00:48:28.686 - 00:48:52.078, Speaker A: Dithering here. And even back to that kind of pink and purple, that kind of red and pink and purple. Very nice work. And by Tom Bombatl and pixology jungle beat. So, back on the scene here. And just kind of an interesting work here. Interesting frame, interesting subject with the drumming.
00:48:52.078 - 00:49:06.506, Speaker A: Interesting treatment. So I think this is made on aspirate. Aspirate. So 700 by 700. Original is 350 by 350. So multiplied by two. Rata with a tribute to x copy.
00:49:06.506 - 00:49:24.382, Speaker A: And I brought up the x copy here. Let me actually bring that up first. So here is the original, all time high in the city. And it seems to be a reference to someone crossing the River Styx or something. You know, this is. What is the name of the guy? It's not Cerberus. Cerberus is the dog.
00:49:24.382 - 00:49:46.814, Speaker A: But then there is a name for this guy. We'll look it up. And who, you know, crossing the river Styx. So this is a very famous x copy work with what looks like a businessman on it, all time high, maybe, you know, a jab at the financial side of things. This financial guy, perhaps 2018. So pretty interesting. And let's actually go super up close.
00:49:46.814 - 00:50:04.890, Speaker A: Then we'll go back to Rada. So just so you can see what's going on. We did this last time. You see, this is slightly lower resolution than the newer x copies. I mean, this is from 2018, so you can't really blame them. So anyway, just interesting to look at this up close. So let's look at Raddatz now.
00:50:04.890 - 00:50:25.384, Speaker A: So here's Raddha's pixel art version. And the business person here is a rat. So following his whole, you know, theme here with the rat. So anyway, super cool, nice fitting tribute. Let's see what happened to it. Just minted and nothing happened. No offers, no.
00:50:25.384 - 00:50:58.724, Speaker A: No listing. Gift, death rat, xcopy debt. So very interesting, Elbie, as we run through the rest of this episode here, who wants flowers when you're dead? I thought this kind of fit well after the crossing the River Styx, what I think that is crossing the River Styx. So anyways, just kind of a cool glitch work with a skeleton in it by Elbie, edition of 20. And couples sold here. I guess not many are available. Sort of holding a lot too in his account there.
00:50:58.724 - 00:51:23.412, Speaker A: Eli Lowe with a super cool work here. Very unpredictable. Kind of reminds me of KHC in the unpredictableness. Kind of upbeat. And the circle is completed there from Eli. Low nine tazos. Is that primary? Let's look quickly then.
00:51:23.412 - 00:51:39.820, Speaker A: We got a run through this episode here. No. 450 on primary. But again, prices are higher than before. And look at this. Another beautiful, beautiful work here, this time from Spagelsmaskinen. And what do you call this? Bank run.
00:51:39.820 - 00:52:00.708, Speaker A: Bank holiday. So very topical, right? And here you have a bank. A bank underwater. Someone was saying on Twitter, maybe it should be bank liquidity. So anyway, pretty great bank holiday. I love it. So very cool work on foundation, 0.75
00:52:00.708 - 00:52:28.914, Speaker A: ETH spagel, one of one. And here you just release this as well, which is just kind of cool. I don't know what to cut out of this show, you know, like, how can you cut this out? You know? So there's just too much. There's too much greatness here. So it shows you're turning into an hour. Look at this. I mean, okay, so this Sabato retweeted this.
00:52:28.914 - 00:52:46.242, Speaker A: This is from a show called Superstar. And the artist is score. And look at this wild work here. I'll try and stay. Oh, here, let's try. Yeah, my computer is protesting on everything. But you get the picture here.
00:52:46.242 - 00:52:57.510, Speaker A: So really interesting. Cool work. Here you go. Wow. Right? The ascii text here. It just looks great. So anyways, there's that.
00:52:57.510 - 00:53:25.630, Speaker A: Now let's see if. Yeah. So I think the artist mentioned that she's a VJ, a video dj. So that might explain. I'm actually surprised there aren't more video dj's actually in this minting work because you see how powerful the technology is. I'm sure a lot of the glitch artists are using similar mixers, so. But you see how great this looks.
00:53:25.630 - 00:53:41.274, Speaker A: This is an older work, same artist score. Sk o hr last sold for 0.3. Really nice use of ascii text. This is by exmortal. Sold for 47. 69. So nice price.
00:53:41.274 - 00:54:11.060, Speaker A: And a couple of people were trying to bid at one bid for 269 and the other one for 0.47. So a nice payday for exmortal there. That is totally awesome. So anyways, this is on foundation, luxus fluce. And here's x mortal, part of Xmortal Studio here. So just some crazy retro video tools, I guess. Can it video art? We're going to find out.
00:54:11.060 - 00:54:31.524, Speaker A: So anyway, that is part of the secret sauce for ex mortal Eizo. Eizo is back with the furniture this time. I think it's for outdoor furniture for your modern cookout. So now that spring's here. So another beautiful piece here. And future patio chair. I love this piece.
00:54:31.524 - 00:54:46.370, Speaker A: I think I bought this. Yeah. Like, I just love this piece. I love these kind of chairs. I used to almost had a collection of these kind of lawn chairs. There is an art. This is a really particularly nice one, I would say.
00:54:46.370 - 00:55:09.270, Speaker A: So I had to pick that up. So anyways, really cool sky Goodman Corel and shell highs AI and glitch kicks. So just a really, really nice piece from Sky Goodman. I love the color. The color is beautiful. I like to just see how this series continues to get more evolved and complicated and frankly, beautiful. Great work.
00:55:09.270 - 00:55:18.430, Speaker A: Look at venta. I mean, there are so many works that you could have started this show with. This is one of them. Spagels mess Kina. I mean, on and on. Popple. Go, go.
00:55:18.430 - 00:55:34.228, Speaker A: Light us. You know, on and on you could go. And here's just a beautiful AI work. The circle of life. Venta times AI edition of ten. It was on primary, I think, for six, and now it's 18. So just a really, really nice work there.
00:55:34.228 - 00:55:56.936, Speaker A: And this is don't be so Vasya, I believe. Good morning, friends. I want to show you a new work from the Nocebo collection. God hates a coward.

So using a lot of AI, different AI tools, just who we haven't seen for a while, I think did the frogs way back when nasturtium dreams. I thought this was just a really nice looking work, as far as I remember, with just. It uses AI, but it uses, as far as I remember, a lot of different things. But here she says AI art, so it's hard to tell. Maybe this is just raw AI. Hard to say.
00:56:43.048 - 00:57:06.188, Speaker A: You might remember some of these works here. So just. And here's another one dreaming digitally as we wrap up here. Really interesting looking work, isn't it?
