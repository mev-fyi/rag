00:00:02.160 - 00:00:31.354, Speaker A: We are gonna have to absolutely zoom through this episode here. And I had to return, though, to this RJ work. Artist journal, June 12, 2023. Broadcasting to the world from the editor's desk on the pirate ship of the mind in Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pokabelli, and welcome back. So, again, this is gonna be a sped up show here. All apologies in advance, but maybe it's funner that way.
00:00:31.354 - 00:01:05.066, Speaker A: RJ, I had to return to now, I was lucky enough to pick this up after Friday's show. There were still, like, five left, so I was again thrilled to be able to pick this up at .1 ETH. It's one of one. I can't tell if it's a pastiche or not, because I don't know if this is. If there's an original artwork here that this is based on, but I'll tell you what I love about it, which is several things. There seems to be, again, the laptop, which is RJ's trademark, really seems to be.
00:01:05.066 - 00:02:14.732, Speaker A: There's always a personification of sorts with the laptop. And here you have this incredibly beautiful light here in what I want to call this canvas, this digital canvas. And the guy is looking out introspectively out the window, as the laptop is as well. Meanwhile, the sun shines in, and you have this green and yellow, you know, palette, except for the laptop, which is this kind of cold gray. But otherwise, it's kind of weirdly, even though you're inside and everything in the suits of civilization here, and a chair, and with laptop and everything, there is nature everywhere in this work. And it's almost as if this guy here, this man, is looking out the window longingly, almost in a melancholy way, perhaps, at this relationship between himself and the laptop. And so just an interesting dynamic here.
00:02:14.732 - 00:02:56.430, Speaker A: It seems to be about humanity's relationship to technology in the light of nature, shall we say, within the confines of civilization here, shall we say? So anyways, a thrilling work. And it was one of these. We may have looked at this before, but I didn't quite see it the first time, which is why I bring it up here again. And let's just quickly, this is the other one that I picked up, and I don't normally show works that I picked up, but I was just. I just wanted to. The first one, especially this one we did, I'm sure, see before on Twitter. And there is something I want to point out, though, which is the title, 23 59.
00:02:56.430 - 00:03:12.842, Speaker A: And the other one, let me just show you here. It's part of this series, is called conversations. And this one, it is 23 59. That one was, you know, 1726. So maybe 05:26 p.m. So all in the evening. This is the morning.
00:03:12.842 - 00:03:32.802, Speaker A: Actually, this is the morning. So all times of day here. Although I have to say, this doesn't look like night here. 1159. And the sun comes in. So kind of mysterious there, too. Anyway, big congrats to RJ for picking up a the or for selling out on the series.
00:03:32.802 - 00:03:57.898, Speaker A: And a little teaser RJ should be showing up on. I am sending out the confirmation, so I probably shouldn't even announce it, but I don't have time to. To. Basically, RJ should be coming up on Wednesday for the Twitter spaces. So fingers crossed. If not, we'll figure out another time, but I'm pretty sure that should happen then. And thank you, everybody, to all the collectors here who picked up this pixel art sketch.
00:03:57.898 - 00:04:18.596, Speaker A: Ten symptoms of liver damage. Thank you. Ilay Defi, Boston, ahec, Walu, Lone wick and not a number. And treeskull town for getting everything started. And here it is just big where it's not distorted by the. When you minimize dithering, sometimes it gets distorted a little bit. So there is just a quick look at what I was working on there.
00:04:18.596 - 00:04:53.538, Speaker A: So thank you for all the support, popple. Okay, we're back to the numbers. We are back to the numbers. I mean, so 3.7 million views on this work here. Now, I do have a theory that Twitter is picking up on what TikTok had figured out years ago and what Instagram and Facebook were clueless on, which is people like seeing their numbers go up. And the more their numbers go up, the more they want to use your platform.
00:04:53.538 - 00:05:32.650, Speaker A: And I think Twitter has clued in. So I think they're taking a TikTok approach to views, whether it is actually sharing people's work more. When it does go viral, it feels like a bit of a. More of a TikTok algorithm is at work here and also what else is at work here. Yeah, and again, Instagram kind of strangled reach where you hardly got any, and then they wanted you to pay for it. All that happened was everybody went over to TikTok. So I think on one hand, they are actually improving people's reach.
00:05:32.650 - 00:06:00.146, Speaker A: On the other hand, they may be, you know, really juicing these numbers to a certain degree. In the sense that. Put it this way. There was Tucker, right? Tucker went from Fox News to Twitter on Fox News. Apparently he was getting something in the neighborhood of 3 million views of the show on Twitter. It's like over a hundred. That video has over a hundred and some million.
00:06:00.146 - 00:06:46.398, Speaker A: 120 I think is the last I heard. So now does, did he really get, you know, 40 times the viewership? It's possible. It's possible, but I think it's a combination of they are giving more views. I think they are juicing it a little bit, though, is my kind of inner suspicion in the way that it's almost like Instagram wanted to make it look like you weren't getting that much thinking that you would pay for it. Whereas TikTok understood that the more it looks like you're getting in terms of exposure, the more you want to use the app because it's working. I mean, people stopped using Instagram, a lot of them, because they felt like nobody saw what they were doing. There'd be like 20 views.
00:06:46.398 - 00:07:11.114, Speaker A: Right. So that is part of what I think is going on here. But I mean, 3.7 million views. To contextualize that, I mean, for many of, you know, like the main probably aggregator on the Internet, the Drudge report, that's at 20 million views a day. Okay. And again, remember Fox News with Tucker at 3 million views.
00:07:11.114 - 00:08:01.050, Speaker A: So we're starting to get with these like millions of views, whatever that means. We're starting to get into like cable news territory here. As far as the numbers are concerned. It seems a little kind of hard to believe. Is popple getting more exposure than the current lineup on CNN or Fox? I mean, that's why I say the implications, because it's like, what do you mean, 3.7 million views? And maybe he is, maybe he is like, I mean, and then again, and if that's the case, then, you know, what next? You know, and I mean, we have to look at, the retweets were at near 10,000. So that is as real as it gets.
00:08:01.050 - 00:08:11.890, Speaker A: 186 quote retweets, almost 3000 bookmarks. So that is impressive. That is from June 6. This one as well. Your reality is broken. 2.2 million views.
00:08:11.890 - 00:08:32.912, Speaker A: Again, this is better than most CNN shows. I don't know if CNN has a show that has 2.2 million viewers. Right. But popple is doing it many, several times a week. So that is interesting. And remember, on Friday there was 50,000 followers.
00:08:32.912 - 00:09:02.756, Speaker A: Now he's picked up another 7000. So this strategy here of putting out a photo with a couple of hashtags that are good has been working wonders here. And mech TXT is also in on the action. So June 10, 483,000 views. So that's like a CNN show. On good morning, hopeless romantic. So the pixel art, and there's no actually hashtag here.
00:09:02.756 - 00:09:30.878, Speaker A: Interestingly, this is based on retweets and likes, so that is super impressive. Here is another one. Good night. 266,000 views. And again, 1330 retweets and no hashtag, amazingly so, because you'd think this is just yesterday. So it all continues. So here you get a little bit of the same action here, pixel art in Japanese.
00:09:30.878 - 00:09:59.226, Speaker A: And in English, 129,000 views. So it's interesting. It's almost like the hashtags maybe secondary, interestingly. And here is another, and this is from June 9 and 115,000 here using the hashtag. So he almost ditched the hashtags on the most recent ones. And here, Bombadl using the hashtags 20,000. And Bambattle has been doing really well on Reddit, don't forget.
00:09:59.226 - 00:10:29.934, Speaker A: It's easy to forget, but Bumbattle has been at the top of the charts of some, you know, boards on Reddit recently as well. So all very interesting. I tried to get in on the action. I'm at 1200. I was trying digital art, and I even put it in Japanese here. But all to say, and other artists are doing it, too, and I think it's kind of fun. And you know what? It felt really good to actually just put your art out there and just remind people that, okay, here's my art.
00:10:29.934 - 00:11:01.194, Speaker A: You know, you spend all this time on your art, you should show it. And I think that goes for everybody. Like, show your art. And I'm saying that to myself as much as anybody. And this, I wanted to actually add to this, to this very topic here. I'm not mister, you know, I'm not like a huge Mark Zuckerberg fan, but I thought this was an excellent idea here. Your ability to keep doing interesting things is your willingness to be embarrassed.
00:11:01.194 - 00:11:37.408, Speaker A: And I think part of why people might not show their art is because, oh, well, what if there's a bad reaction? What if there's no reaction? Right? But memories are short. And so I think this is worth keeping in mind. Your ability to keep doing interesting things or even to move forward is your willingness to be embarrassed. So I thought that was just a really interesting idea. Good and thought. Quick comments here as we continue to run through this show. Thank you, retro Manny, for the comments here.
00:11:37.408 - 00:12:07.840, Speaker A: To answer your question, yes, I did the music for all the pieces in the cyberpixel collection, apart from the piece. Next stop, Utopia Claudia, aka 196 pixels light, did that. So doing the music for those retro Manny level video games. And great comment from DJ Kuro here. Great show. Crazy about the reach strengthening is getting fire. I got like two to three likes on my instagram, like five views on my Twitter.
00:12:07.840 - 00:12:27.614, Speaker A: I was hacked last year and now all my posts are shadowbanned, whatever that means. Oh well, interesting news about ordinals too. Love the hair. Happy to see it getting bigger each episode. And it will, I think it's not for another week and a half, my haircut. So it will get, it will continue to get bigger. It's a little more tame today, but anyways.
00:12:27.614 - 00:13:06.026, Speaker A: But yeah, crazy about reach strength strengthening, about all the reach I yeah, indeed. This was great. This was a strange thing on display at NFT Lisbon via Foundation super chief NFT. So just to show you and you see how good it looks on the screens and how they display it, I would have loved to have picked that up, too. So there it is. Strange thing at NFT Lisbon. And here is another one, goyong Goyeong Arts, who we're going to see a couple of works of.
00:13:06.026 - 00:13:39.336, Speaker A: And so they did a really nice job. You see, again, the superiority of the projector over the tv here. It just, you know, digital art can be made so big and it just, you know, it's engulfing and it's huge. Like, look at how incredibly amazing that looks. So just really cool there from Goyong. And strange thing at NFT Lisbon, an interesting, just physical here, Arata. So signing this printing, this big shout out, bling bling venom.
00:13:39.336 - 00:14:10.324, Speaker A: Great collector of immeasurable patients who waited a year for this museum quality print signed by your favorite crypto artist, crypto crypto radist. I've been busy and kind of lost in my current Medici quest. We have a lot of drops awaiting after that. Thanks again for all the love. So there it is, signed there beautifully by Rata with a nice little pirate flag there. And so just nice to see how this prints out. So a rendition basically looks like an inkjet of pixel art.
00:14:10.324 - 00:14:33.200, Speaker A: So lone wick. So just a couple of comments here as well on the market. The current crypto market is making NFTs cheaper by the minute. Don't fear. Collect subtle contradictions by Rannick Steer. So I didn't even know Rannick Steer had work on foundation that I remember here. And what you'll see here is this wire, 3d wire sculpture changes colors.
00:14:33.200 - 00:14:55.260, Speaker A: So pretty nice piece here. That lone wick, I think, picked up on foundation and totally, I mean, again, tazos is at $0.70 here, so not great for artists. Wonderful for collecting. Also retro. Manny, my humble observations and advice. I've been an artist for 20 years.
00:14:55.260 - 00:15:23.320, Speaker A: Never have I seen opportunities so readily available as they are right now as an artist. And I completely agree. Like, look at what's happening with popple. If you're old enough to remember the early zero zeros, you know what I'm talking about. Totally, totally, totally. What would you do? It was all about can you get a gallery? I mean, otherwise, what what hope did you have? Here's my advice. Spend time establishing your true self.
00:15:23.320 - 00:15:49.182, Speaker A: Be cautious of the temptations of middlemen. Allow yourself to be consistently creative over a long period of time. Don't worry about where this is all going. Enjoy making, breaking, sharing, failing, and growing. This is a time for appreciation. So kind of a nice bookend to what Mark Zuckerberg was saying, which is like, your ability to grow is based on your willingness to be embarrassed. You know, like in a sense, this show.
00:15:49.182 - 00:16:41.832, Speaker A: And you know, you got to be willing to be embarrassed and just live with it, right? I mean, anything that you put out there publicly and the more you sort of not care about that, there is a power in that. And finally here mech txt since I couldn't speak for everyone, it's only proper for me to speak at least to all my friends and appreciators who collected my artworks. List my artworks below primary if you have to. Your survival is paramount and nothing else matters. I won't judge you as a bad friend and exactly like, maybe it's not thrilling as an artist to see, like, something go for under the primary cost, but once you sell it, you sell it and they bought it off you and they can kind of do what they want with it, you know, within reason. But buy my artworks from those who list below primary. That's just how the market is right now.
00:16:41.832 - 00:17:21.594, Speaker A: Exactly. You want your market to be strong enough where if someone sells it for cheap, that other people are going to be excited. Like when I saw this tweet, I went to Mec TxT's page and said, where are the deals? Show me the deals, right? And you'll be lucky. And you'll be the one lucky bunch to seize the opportunity, right? So I won't judge you as a bad friend appreciator if you sell for a low price. I said it once, I'll say it again. Secondary market dynamics is always something that's truly fascinating for me. Seeing it evolving to whichever direction and watching it grow beyond my control is a personal fascination, almost akin to the feeling of when people interpret my work beyond my own narration.
00:17:21.594 - 00:17:38.994, Speaker A: It has a mind of its own. Be at ease, friends. Exactly. So I just totally agree with this entire sentiment there. I thought this was just another kind of, we saw the crypto and AI tweet, pivot to AI. I thought this was another. Just a measure of the sentiment out there.
00:17:38.994 - 00:18:12.204, Speaker A: Art pleb crypto is done. People keep acting like it's a normal cycle, but it is a complete failure. The market is over. It has been hyped for years with nothing to show. Other assets create real value, and this one is just a bunch of failure. There won't be another cycle. And I'm still back to this idea that the one use case that I'm sure of, like people will point to aave, you can borrow money for a mortgage and how amazing is that? But you can do that in the physical world too.
00:18:12.204 - 00:18:54.248, Speaker A: You can do a lot of these financial things, you know, machinations you can do in the physical world. I'm kind of back to the, the use case that to me is unassailable is digital art. This idea of being able to buy and sell digital assets is the real use case. Like a JPEG, like a, like any, like, you know, anything digital and art in particular. Digital art. So that would be my one response to this person, to artpleb, is, you know, I take your point. You know, it's an interesting point.
00:18:54.248 - 00:19:37.416, Speaker A: And who knows, right? I would say digital art, though I'm not sure. Without crypto, there's still not a solution for it other than passing USB's around, which is pretty lame, right? So. And there's no sense of security of, well, who's made copies of this? And why is this JPeg on your USB worth a lot? And then the one on your computer that you can copy infinitely is not. So finally, Elon Musk. In a few weeks, Twitter, which I think he's going to change to x or x, Twitter will start paying creators for ads served in their replies. First block payments totals $5 million. So the more engagement you get in your tweet, the more replies.
00:19:37.416 - 00:20:15.618, Speaker A: Now, note, the creator must be verified and only add served to verified users. Count. Well, maybe popple is going to have to verify himself, because if we go here, the question is now is how many comments is popple getting? Because if he's getting hundreds of comments, all of a sudden this could turn into quite the payday, right? So I'm not sure how many comments are here. Maybe we can see here 18. So that's 1443. So pretty interesting. Pretty interesting.
00:20:15.618 - 00:20:33.294, Speaker A: 110. That's pretty good. So maybe that starts to pay. Interesting. So back we go to our show here. So just interesting on Twitter there, the end of the road. So here's a beautiful work by Uri J.
00:20:33.294 - 00:20:54.520, Speaker A: Almost a night summer scene, another summer scene, but this time at night again, we got a laptop here and classic Uri J. Just beautiful rendition here. A digital painting in the true sense of the term. Nice. Like palm tree and island over here, also on the right. And different kind of tree in the middle with a house. And it looks like a cottage.
00:20:54.520 - 00:21:18.048, Speaker A: It looks like a, you know, in Toronto, you'd call this cottage country outside the city, going to the lake, looks like at the lake, the end of the yellow road. So cool, cool work here from Uri J. And sold for 25 ETH. So nice work there on super rare. And here's goyong arts. Good morning, my friends. Have a nice day.
00:21:18.048 - 00:21:48.004, Speaker A: So a cool, again, kind of a nature work here. And you see the transition here from day to night and night to day. So nice piece here from Goyang arts. Not sure if it's been minted yet. And here's another one. Just kind of a beautiful sunflower, kind of vaguely reminiscent of Van Gogh, but very distantly goyeong arts. So anyways, just beautiful, beautiful work here.
00:21:48.004 - 00:22:23.546, Speaker A: Continues to be from goyong, trampling over the remnants of our illusions. So interesting piece here. And the person stretched out. This is a pretty interesting, I mean, bold move here. First they're stretched, and then it's just like, copied over and over, almost absurdly here. And then what looks like maybe some kind of alcohol, perhaps. Perhaps mixed with a surveillance camera and two old Macs and maybe a deflated balloon with a happy face on it.
00:22:23.546 - 00:22:54.658, Speaker A: So another metaphysical work here, trampling over the remnants of our illusions by Euxine. And this did very well in a tough market. So 125 tezos each sold out within two minutes. So big congrats there to Euxine edition of eleven. This is a pretty nice piece that I saw by pixel Lord. They're posting this on the AI surrealist show and just in the feed, like, oh, I would have loved to have been in it, you know, let me in. And I just thought this was a really nice piece here.
00:22:54.658 - 00:23:08.254, Speaker A: So beautiful. Surreal digital painting by Pixellord. And here's a work by runetune. Let's get this going. Spins two. An experimental variation on the original spins. So let's just get this going.
00:23:08.254 - 00:23:27.830, Speaker A: And there we go. So maybe this is after a day of drinking a night of drinking, you get the spins. So here it is. And this looks like alcohol. Bottles of alcohol here. So pretty interesting effect. Kind of masked out shapes over here.
00:23:27.830 - 00:23:43.370, Speaker A: Interesting color palette and everything. Almost as if these shapes drag a little bit here. Interesting work from runetune. The experimentation continues. Available for 424. Left edition of 20. So almost gone.
00:23:43.370 - 00:24:20.214, Speaker A: And here is. This is. What is the name of this artist again? I want to call it baba Boo boy. Thank you, Booboy. And this is a collaboration, so it's. The artists together are called blank embrace and visual artist. Maybe this is buboy working with AI, because I saw on their twitter that look, if you look here at the top, spiral passages live by Buboy Blank.
00:24:20.214 - 00:24:33.864, Speaker A: And let's just see the details. My first collab. Hope you enjoy with connecting both of our worlds. So I'm not sure who the collab is. Maybe it's AI. Not very clear. It does have a different feel to it, though.
00:24:33.864 - 00:24:53.984, Speaker A: Maybe it's the artist who does this. Blank embrace. Or maybe it's blank embrace and bhuboy working together. Interesting combination here. So there it is. And let's just quickly look at the work. Spiral passage, so very interesting collaboration here.
00:24:53.984 - 00:25:10.514, Speaker A: That is what it looks like. Blank embrace and bhuboy. So there it is. Interesting work here and available for 0.5 ETH on foundation. And here's Sarissa Kojima. She comes in colors and quoting the rolling stones here.
00:25:10.514 - 00:25:38.148, Speaker A: So just another interesting kind of cartoony work here of a woman with VR goggles and all sorts of stickers on it and a blue background. So just kind of interesting edition of 30. There are 26 left at five tezos and summer blues. So Andre, summer blues, soft inside with a new work on tezos from June 7. So last week available for eight tezos. There are 16 left. And here it is.
00:25:38.148 - 00:25:56.756, Speaker A: And kind of a skeleton, almost looks like a. Like a wolf skin or something. Like a wolf head on top of the shaman or something. There is a psychedelic vibe sometimes. To Andre, summer blues, soft inside. Every part of me deserves healing and I allow it to happen. Cool work.
00:25:56.756 - 00:26:24.224, Speaker A: Very nice work. Interesting texture here in the paper. Continuing on, demon ego, the blind spot. Try to reach us. So more experimentation here from demon ego. Gotta love the color on the right and the person kind of fix scratching and fixing back their head. Totally experimental here you have dithering on this middle square here and some other effect on the left combined with collage.
00:26:24.224 - 00:26:53.878, Speaker A: So continuing to push the envelope here. Edition of ten for ten tezos, each, nine left. So just listed dan control with a fun. This kind of matches with RJ's work a little bit. It's like these two works. The tvs are in dialogue here, just like the guy in the chair and the laptop are almost in dialogue looking out the window, you know, in introspection here. Well, here the tv, the old tv and the new tv in dialogue here.
00:26:53.878 - 00:27:26.018, Speaker A: Sold out at how much? At four tazos, so nice sale here and transferred to the other five. And so at four tezos, each now available for 50 on secondary comparison. And a new work by Roccano. And how are we doing for time here? Going to keep it fast. Mushroom nightmare. This is pretty cool too. I really like the video games works where Roccano is sticking Super Mario on the tv as it's playing like that is a nice added touch here.
00:27:26.018 - 00:28:02.980, Speaker A: And then we have some of the video game elements like the mushroom outside of the tvs too. So just kind of a cool work here again. And this is available for 13 tezos on secondary and sold out for five tezos on primary Haiti Rocket with a Rom glitch ROM and nice control. So again, the racing. And it felt like we saw a very abstracted version of the racing last time. So here is maybe a slightly more together in terms of only half abstracted. You can tell it's a road, you can tell it's a racing car.
00:28:02.980 - 00:28:26.284, Speaker A: Really nice at the bottom though here. Just master of the glitch Rom here. And this is available for 45 tezos edition of 16. I mean, it's not that much money anymore. 45 tezos is now $32. I mean, it's significant, but Tezos is on sale. Kurt hustle collective with a new one, which I'm thrilled about.
00:28:26.284 - 00:29:10.532, Speaker A: Cult of the coin here. Pump those pennies. So some market commentary, some great music, very chill music, just very cool. These are my favorite works by Kurt Hussel collective, these wonderfully beautiful commercials. So that has just been minted. So that is great to see. Only an edition of ten for only seven tazos placewoz Gamma continuing to show a lot of works from 2009.
00:29:10.532 - 00:29:41.184, Speaker A: So showing that Francois Gamma has been around for a long time and again playing with this 3d kind of rendered software here. And let's quickly bring up gamma. You're going to see a lot of work from 2009 is populating the feed here. So you see just how incredibly prolific Francois Gamma must have. Like thousands and thousands and thousands of work. Remember, Francois was hacked and already there's five pages here. That was only like six weeks ago maybe.
00:29:41.184 - 00:30:04.244, Speaker A: And this was interesting too. So this is Francois Gamma showing what looks like some retro software tools. Lightwave scene, Linux layout. Maybe part of the how this work is made here by Francoise Gamma. So just a look into the software here. So that is pretty cool to see. Martin Joe with an abstract here.
00:30:04.244 - 00:30:38.714, Speaker A: Let's see if we can get almost like a drum and bass beat here with some colors and everything centered experiment, the pursuit of abstraction. So maybe there is another one here too. And there is. So we'll very quickly look at that one here if it loads up first. Experiment. Here we go. Maybe playing with the bear theme a little bit here.
00:30:38.714 - 00:31:04.488, Speaker A: So very cool abstraction there. Pamelo Sirone with a one of one. It's only at five tezos right now, which is quite cheap for this artist, as far as I understand. So anyways, this is five tezos and another 11 hours in the auction. So you can still get that maybe for quite cheap. Santiago with an open edition. Very nice.
00:31:04.488 - 00:31:27.450, Speaker A: Kind of feels like, I don't know what kind of software this would be. You see how this almost looks like. You know, what this looks like to me is almost like the picture of a screen with like some eight bit camera or something. I mean, no, harn, 800 by 600. So maybe a screenshot upscaled to 4000 by 3000. Great title art for humans. Love the title.
00:31:27.450 - 00:31:49.790, Speaker A: Only one Tezos open edition. It's all dithered. Very interestingly. And here, speaking of dithering, Sky Goodman has a birthday present from Sabato. Sabato made me this one of one gift to welcome my first child, probably my only child into the world. What an insane present. Can't wait to show this to Ezri when they are just a little bit older.
00:31:49.790 - 00:32:08.194, Speaker A: So there is the child and celebration. So pretty nice. I mean, a testament to the community over here. And a pretty cool, you know, work here. A one of, one of this drawing series by Sabato. So a beautiful present here. And kind of mystical.
00:32:08.194 - 00:32:27.544, Speaker A: Just very cool. Speaking of pixel art, two of cups, manital. So continuing with the cat tarot here and there, we see it. So nice and simple. Continuing on, Haiti. Rockette mimic line. So another abstract.
00:32:27.544 - 00:32:48.636, Speaker A: And these are selling quite well, by the way. Again, using balance 2.0, these are selling for like 50 tezos each. Beautiful abstract. And how many sold here? Already selling five. So 250 tezos in a bear market. So Haiti Rockette shows resilience here with his collectors.
00:32:48.636 - 00:33:11.032, Speaker A: Datura edition of 20 for. For tazos. And this is just another beautiful semi abstract landscape here. You gotta love the bottom part, how it's moving, and the top, how it's not going from left to right. So that is super cool. Just very powerful abstraction here from Datura. And this was hilarious.
00:33:11.032 - 00:33:36.782, Speaker A: Ex mortal with some palm trees. And one of my favorite topics here. So I'm not sure if this is a crop of the other work or if this is just the top half, but it looks great. Nothing like palm trees there. No link there. And max capacity with a really cool glitch here and kind of a car exploding. And so it's pretty awesome, actually.
00:33:36.782 - 00:33:56.614, Speaker A: I mean, so this is at auction for 6057. And so I'm not exactly sure what the addition count is here. One of 38. Wow. So maybe this is an older work, perhaps. Let me just go back here. This is note, this is June 9, 2023.
00:33:56.614 - 00:34:12.048, Speaker A: So pretty awesome. Let me just look at the history here. Okay. Selling for five tezos across, and then one person is creating an auction. Got it. Ozpren with a what look like Air Force ones with a black background. So that is cool.
00:34:12.048 - 00:34:38.678, Speaker A: Could hang in the same show as Sky Goodman there. And continuing on, Kita Savvy. Good night. So just an interesting abstract here with these kind of three dimensional works. And just an interesting artist, Keeta Savvy, whose work I don't remember seeing before. So interesting over there. And look at JoA in April was the month of new art explorations.
00:34:38.678 - 00:35:05.379, Speaker A: Never stop expressing. So, again, that's almost the theme of this episode here, is kind of taking chances and never, you know, put yourself out there. New art explorations and with good effect. Like, look at this. I mean, pretty impressive abstracts here. And so painterly looking. I mean, you would hardly know that these are AI, but I assume they are.
00:35:05.379 - 00:35:46.038, Speaker A: I mean, Joa in uses digital painting, too, so maybe it's a combination. This is AI suom with another one of these mirror works. It's called Mind palace. So this is just, again, we're kind of back to this introspection also that instead of a window, the mirror is providing, but kind of, again, kind of similar setup to RJ's, just less of a light shadow dynamic. But again, you have, like this, almost this vermeer setting here with the light coming in the side window. Anyways, beautiful with the mirror here. And just there's something about these mirrors that I find super psychological and interesting.
00:35:46.038 - 00:36:15.514, Speaker A: And here's Mikey Wilson. Strawberry fields blues. And so some interesting, almost. Not sure if this is how these aren't how strawberries grow, but so a surrealist kind of, you know, field here with, again, a, someone playing the blues in the middle of it with a beautiful sky there. Nice and painterly sky by Mikey Wilson. And I think this is sold out at ten tezos each. Very nice for Mikey Wilson.
00:36:15.514 - 00:36:39.244, Speaker A: Martin, Joe, the sum of all trends minting soon. I thought this was great. So someone on the VR and you see, actually, you might see your work in here. I thought I saw my work in here really briefly once. So kind of fun. Kind of fun. There's mentalist 420.
00:36:39.244 - 00:36:56.244, Speaker A: Almost a celebration of the scene here. Axin there is strange thing. There's me there. There's everybody. So all very cool. Diego Barrow with a really nice painterly work here. Torre de margaritas.
00:36:56.244 - 00:37:27.396, Speaker A: So a whole bunch of flowers here. Beautifully made work here by Diego Barrow. And here's Diego working with pen on a canvas here. So that is also pretty cool with big sound effects. I can imagine the noise of Spanx. So beautiful though, isn't it? So again, nice to just see people working physically. Nice and short video too, I might add.
00:37:27.396 - 00:37:39.452, Speaker A: The 14 seconds is cool. And then here's strange thing. Check out this bike. So pretty cool. Renaissance type bike. Here's a scooter. Scooter, right.
00:37:39.452 - 00:38:09.274, Speaker A: So again, working with Renaissance relief and, you know, modern, you know, transportation, I guess, or, you know, bikes. This one's really interesting, too. It has the feeling of, okay, maybe that's what a greek statue of someone on a bike would look like. Or on a scooter, for that matter. And a couple of physical contemporary artists. This is Joachim official for the armory show, which I thought just kind of a nice piece here. And here's more of their work.
00:38:09.274 - 00:38:30.214, Speaker A: So they're with that gallery that we've been looking at here, too. Christian Hjalerjerdi Gallery. I think Norwegian there. And so this artist is Antwerp based Joachim Lambrex. So here is just a quick, like, pretty cool work here, as you can see. Pretty big. Looks pretty great.
00:38:30.214 - 00:38:48.242, Speaker A: So I guess that's the artist there and the artist studio. So pretty cool. Here's another one. Shane G. Meyer with some nice work. Kind of nice, kind of pop feel to it, but with like a popeye with a kind of dog head. And let's actually just go.
00:38:48.242 - 00:39:02.494, Speaker A: This is a little bit more of their work. So just an interesting artist over here. Right space credit card. Just interesting work here. Marker drawing. So cool work. Shane G.
00:39:02.494 - 00:39:08.654, Speaker A: Meyer on Instagram. And that is your show, everyone. Thank you for joining me. Until next time, take care.
