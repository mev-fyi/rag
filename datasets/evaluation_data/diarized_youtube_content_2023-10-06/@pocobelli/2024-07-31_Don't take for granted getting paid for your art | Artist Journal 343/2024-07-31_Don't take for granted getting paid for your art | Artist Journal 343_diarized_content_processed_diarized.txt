00:00:04.600 - 00:00:36.634, Speaker A: On a mission we are running. I am meeting a friend. I have an appointment in 85 minutes, so we're gonna try and keep it under an hour, if possible, in this one of a kind show broadcast around the world. Artist Journal, July 31, 2024. Broadcasting from Berlin, Germany, on a beautiful, sunny summer day. My name is Adrian Pokebelly. Continuing so very challenging work, I would argue.
00:00:36.634 - 00:01:25.612, Speaker A: I am going to present here for you today. But when you consume as much as we do on this show, you know, I'd say, you know, or just if you're paying attention online at your Instagram. And I do highly recommend X for those that are looking to actually get involved in this scene. X is very important. Formerly known as Twitter. I remember when I was onboarded to super rare, one of the first things they'd tell you, they have a little meeting and to kind of, you know, get you started and get you, you know, one of the things is most of the digital art collectors are on x kind of important information. So I'm getting kind of more and more comments from people who are interested in this scene and are trying to figure out how it works, the minting.
00:01:25.612 - 00:02:06.284, Speaker A: I want to put out some videos on that, just, you know, as far as I can. I've been trying to put out a how to inscribe on bitcoin for the last, like three weeks, but it's always just a race against the clock over here. But I really want to put that together. But one thing you can do in the meantime is get signed up on X because a lot of, there's a lot of great art there that you're not going to come across on Instagram. And again, back to our, you know, discussion earlier. Who's going to websites anymore here and there. But really from the socials, interestingly and arguably, object where this work here is, is on a social, is a social network.
00:02:06.284 - 00:02:30.500, Speaker A: And that's kind of actually an increasing discussion here. Anyways, so here is this incredible art. Let me actually get the artist here. This is on object.com, as you can see, Mishi Asu. And actually, we're going to look at the full name, I think. So this is the, this is it, the name of the artist on objects strolling on air July 29 so 48 to 72 hours ago.
00:02:30.500 - 00:03:35.046, Speaker A: Let me show you some challenging art. Let me get the. Feels very, here we go. You know, we, I've discussed the avant garde here with Robert Wilson, Philip Glass doing Einstein on the beach, and there's something very kind of wonderful about this. And again, when you consume as many images as we do here. What's interesting is it's actually this is, I think, where some, you know, obscurity, which I often criticize in the art scene, this is where some of the obscurity comes from. Where if you've been to, you know, to take the contemporary art world, if you've been to a million art fairs, you've gone to all the galleries in New York a million times, and it's like your job, all of a sudden, more challenging artworks start to become.
00:03:35.046 - 00:04:06.750, Speaker A: Have a kind of resonance. Like people who are really, as I like to, you know, pushing the aesthetic, the frontiers of aesthetics, becomes its own thing. So when I first came in the scene, I might have saw something like this and thought like, how weird is this? Or just like, kind of unmoved by it. But when I see it now, I go, whoo, this is different. This is kind of exciting over here. Who's this? And I think it was Curio. Fringe, excellent.
00:04:06.750 - 00:04:48.134, Speaker A: I don't know if Curio would call themselves a curator, but I would call them an excellent curator. Someone to follow on x. If you're looking for kind of challenging art, I would say that's the first name that comes to mind. So here is Michi Asu's page, and I brought up a few of the works here, but you're seeing this kind of fuzzy yellow and green palette, but also other works too here. So I brought up a few of these. Some of them have audio, some of them don't. Movies, I mean, I would say largely, you know, one of one for eleven tezos.
00:04:48.134 - 00:05:33.362, Speaker A: I mean, that's $8, another one for ten. Like, I'll probably pick up a few of these, hopefully, if I finish this show on time, where I can actually, before I hit publish on this video. So there's really great work here. So let's look at some of it. So here's the. Just to give you some background, here's the object profile, here's the Twitter lukewarm image of mind. You know, when I start to think of, like, the challenging nature of NUV 19, fourteen's work of Zuozo's work of, you could argue, his dribble waffles work of Curio, Fringe's work, what I sometimes like to call here, indie visual art, in the same way that we might have thought of indie, you know, music scene.
00:05:33.362 - 00:06:02.606, Speaker A: Even though I never really used the word indie, that kind of came after for me, it was always new wave was my indie. So, you know, Devo, you know, again, I think research publications, you know, William Burroughs, the whole, you know, eighties counterculture. Anyways, let's not get off topic here. So here's Mishi Asu and looking at the feed, you're actually going to get some, a little revelation here. So interesting. Completely different work here. Today's anxiety, May 31, pinned.
00:06:02.606 - 00:06:36.024, Speaker A: Interestingly, Dan Kelly. So we've seen Dan Kelly before and look at this kind of filter, but you're going to start seeing another Dan Kelly. There's little cakes, really cool work here using runwayml. And then, okay, the work here, and then there's mumble boy. So you start to actually be able to ground the artist by looking at their feet a little bit and look at who you find here. A retweet of little cakes tweeting hastrubal waffle work, which we looked at last episode. And then again, Curio Fringe.
00:06:36.024 - 00:07:01.392, Speaker A: How did I learn about Curio Fringe? I think it was waffles that was saying how, or maybe I was looking at a work on the show and waffles was saying, you know, big influence on a lot of us. Curio Fringe. So here. And here's website. So Asuka Mishihiro, I assume sounds japanese. I'm not an expert, but look at this website you got. I assume the broken images are on purpose.
00:07:01.392 - 00:07:14.130, Speaker A: They look fabulous. I hope it is. I assume it is. This is my virtual portfolio site. Hope you enjoy it. Thanks. So, and here, more lovely broken images here.
00:07:14.130 - 00:07:43.090, Speaker A: Not sure. And you see, so, you know, kind of a, I think we could call a pretty serious artist here. You might have looked at those initial works and go, that initial work and go, okay, someone, someone just being weird here. But no, this person is quite serious, as you say, as you can see here, list of works, even look at this. And maybe the broken images are for real. Too bad. Yeah.
00:07:43.090 - 00:08:21.584, Speaker A: So we'll just leave that open here. I'm going to show you some more of their work, though, as we continue here. So one of one available for ten tazos, a still image here, weirdly, like. And I, you know, in a sense, apologies to the artist, as I say, weirdly, I find this so powerful. But, I mean, this is really pushing aesthetic expectations, right? I mean, if you show this, you know, I, in a sense, to a certain degree, you know, this is not typical fair for the COVID of the newspaper. The imagination, as I always like to say, you want kind of something bright, shiny, easy to understand. This is not easy to understand, in my opinion.
00:08:21.584 - 00:08:48.560, Speaker A: This is kind of obscure, kind of fuzzy, you know, not easy challenging, as I like to say here. So, and largely, you know, undiscovered, I would say, as far as we see all these. One of ones for seven tazos in the greenhouse. Another one. And here's another one. A movie, eye temperature. This came out July 28, so a day before that initial one.
00:08:48.560 - 00:09:37.580, Speaker A: That's a similar kind of sound vibe to Zuozo. It's like, you know, again, when you're consuming as many images as we are, I have a feeling a lot of the people that regularly watch this show are going to be very excited by this work. Whereas if you're coming here for the first time, you might be like, what is going on over here? What are these guys so excited about? Right? But again, so it's kind of back to acquired. You know, we're developing an aesthetic, to a certain degree, appreciation for these artists over time, which is why I am starting with it like it merits it. And look at these again. There's a lot of outrageous decisions here. This kind of spectrum rainbow.
00:09:37.580 - 00:10:01.098, Speaker A: You know, you have to ask yourself, artist or not, would I ever make something like this? And I think of NUV 1914, the sheer originality and persistence. Consistency is what I'm trying to say. It looks like persistence here, too. Here's another one. Goodnight. Also available, ten tazos. So I'm gonna pick up a couple of these, warn you.
00:10:01.098 - 00:10:18.242, Speaker A: Look at the music. Love the kind of piano thing. Beautiful. Wish it was louder. Beautiful, beautiful. And here's another one. This is just a gif mirror of conversation.
00:10:18.242 - 00:10:41.458, Speaker A: So communication, reflection. Also available, one of one for ten. I mean, you almost wonder, like, sometimes I think to myself, like, there is this curio fringe, you know, I don't think so. But you do start to. It looks like the website. There's everything we just saw. Like, I mean, this is, again, startlingly original work.
00:10:41.458 - 00:11:17.730, Speaker A: Here's another one, also available, all available edition of 110 tazos. One of these is not, unfortunately. Wait till you see this one. This is probably my favorite, the music. Wish I could make it go louder, maybe. No, that's full blast. Love the vibe here.
00:11:17.730 - 00:11:39.838, Speaker A: Like, loving the vibe. Would love to own this. Amelia Versace. Nice work. Amelia Versace. And it looks like AV collection and only a tazos. Summer pool and beautiful work.
00:11:39.838 - 00:11:58.016, Speaker A: July 6. Here's dance of consciousness. Also available edition of one. So you see kind of a different kind of look here in the work. And also let's. Now there was one. Did we get everything? I think we did.
00:11:58.016 - 00:12:21.220, Speaker A: I think summer pool was the last one. So just so the artist, Asuka Michihiro. Not too much information. On Xdev, but here it is on X. So if you're new to X, here's a first follow for you to the art scene on X. There's an awesome first follow for you. You will learn a lot from these kinds of accounts.
00:12:21.220 - 00:12:43.136, Speaker A: So I think that's it. Yeah, we started with the new one. Okay, let's continue. A big show today. So it's a busy day over here. Runetune has just put on a show a couple of weeks ago in Omaha, Nebraska, with partner, actually. So I wish.
00:12:43.136 - 00:13:16.988, Speaker A: Well, I'll mention it in the with Kavanaugh 121, who had to start a new account, by the way. So give them a follow. I want to do more digital art shows. So we're going to talk about this art show that runetude and Kavanaugh 121 did in Omaha, Nebraska. And they did quite a beautiful job of it. They said there were a ton of people, which is quite interesting. They're probably thrilled to have like a cool, edgy, you know, you know, digital art show, but done with a lot of care here, as you see these old kind of tv monitors.
00:13:16.988 - 00:13:38.242, Speaker A: Look at all these people. Great shots here. And look at this. So people just probably happy to see something completely different. So we're gonna talk about this show that happened in Omaha, Nebraska, the home of Warren Buffet, as I like to say. Yeah, so hilarious and beautiful. So that's coming up.
00:13:38.242 - 00:13:54.074, Speaker A: Also new work by Runetune here. Portal. This came out taking the original portal and turning it into a gift. So interesting. I think turning a previous work and adding animation. And this an edition of ten and sold out, or at least the four that were available. Sold out at seven tezos.
00:13:54.074 - 00:14:07.542, Speaker A: Actually. No, sorry. Still available. Seven tezos. Each portal on object.com. and thank you for the sale for this promoted story to first syndrome. This is actually, you can't.
00:14:07.542 - 00:14:30.244, Speaker A: I think it's censored because I think objects algorithm thinks there's too much flesh here. So thank you for the person putting their faith or changing their settings in their browser for picking up this work here. Still six left. Thank you. Thank you. Let me get the name again. First syndrome.
00:14:30.244 - 00:14:45.012, Speaker A: Thank you for the collect. Let's look at comments here on last show that. Yes. Where we continued the breakthrough there on these image making technologies. Let's see. Mistyart found this online. This is super interesting.
00:14:45.012 - 00:15:03.602, Speaker A: Found this channel recently and started watching these in the background while doing art. I think a lot of people do. Interestingly, I find it impossible to do video and art at the same time. But I'm thrilled that other people can. I've learned so much about NFTs and the online modern art scene. I'm not sure what people call this sort of thing. You know.
00:15:03.602 - 00:15:32.132, Speaker A: You know what we call it? We haven't called it this for a while. I at least what I call it, I call it the visual arts underground. That's what it is. It's basically, to me, it's kind of in my mind, and maybe this never happens. It's kind of like the next big thing to a certain degree, this art. And as you see, I mean, what, like, as we saw with Michi Asu, I mean, here you have this refined artist putting out these interesting works. Like, that's where they are.
00:15:32.132 - 00:15:59.186, Speaker A: They're in this little ecosystem where you can sell them for crypto. Anyways, let's continue. I'd have never learned about any of these artists or the community behind them if it wasn't for these videos. It's probably part of the reason why I actually started doing this. I was like, this is like a great, like, this is totally untapped. Anyway, loving the videos. I'm definitely subscribing and I'm definitely going to attempt to make an NFT collection one day if I can figure all this out.
00:15:59.186 - 00:16:30.572, Speaker A: So I'm really glad you mentioned that. If I can figure all this out. So there are wallets. Start with the wallet is what I would say. Because who knows when I make a video, could be tomorrow, could be a year from now, hopefully it'll be in a week or something like that. There are wallets and you know, what's a famous kukai wallet? And there's also, there's one that starts with temple. Kukai and Temple are good places to start for Tezos, which is where object.com,
00:16:30.572 - 00:17:06.778, Speaker A: where you can buy and sell, generally. Just finally, you need to go on binance or Coinbase to get your fiat in. You still need to go to these big centralized exchanges, generally convert it over from your fiat that you've basically transferred over to Coinbase or binance, and from there you can buy Tezos and then you send it to your digital wallet. That's how it works. But of course, and there's actually a ton of demos, I'm sure on YouTube, but I'll probably put something out and also how to do it on bitcoin, which is pretty exciting anyway. Really. I love comments like that.
00:17:06.778 - 00:17:42.846, Speaker A: It makes me really excited. Marcel Munciano for sure. Akump Arts having a show even tomorrow in Twitter and every month in their meta galleries, made like a new type of art piece all soon will be the auction of their metagalleries. So we always welcome you, dear Poco in our Twitter spaces to talk about real digital artists participating in it every time and curators like Elna Frederick and Francois Agamemnon last auction. So yeah definitely I think I put a reminder in it so I'll keep putting reminders as I see a comparts putting out spaces. P's tomorrow will be yeah, I put a reminder. I think I was out.
00:17:42.846 - 00:18:04.390, Speaker A: I can't remember what I was doing actually. Where was I? Where was I? It's been a busy oh I was at the gym. I went to two gym classes in a row. That was awesome. I felt so good so I yeah I was in the gym. Anyways, thank you for the invite and I'll keep my eyes open. P's tomorrow will be a compart's first year birthday.
00:18:04.390 - 00:18:27.662, Speaker A: Twitter spaces and recent auction with the great Martin Bruce and all other OG artists. Spiegel will also speak. So welcome. Thank you so much. And here's Sabato actually added a comparts is probably the most underrated digital gallery in this space. So high praise from Sabato. They put so much care in making the virtual galleries and are an all round great group to work with.
00:18:27.662 - 00:19:06.030, Speaker A: Nothing but love for a comparts I have to like, you know, I don't know too much about them but I have seen them and you gotta love the curation. Like it looks great to me. The, you know, so it just looks awesome and you know, easy to like, let's put it that way. So again, very interesting retro Manny, the show feels like the new meta is having your artwork criticized by artist journal viewers and then you picking that criticism. Apartheid agreed with your response by the way. Looking forward to the day my stuff is insulted for being childish and derivative garbage indeed. You know, as you know, there's no such thing as bad publicity.
00:19:06.030 - 00:19:46.242, Speaker A: You know, at the end of the day, you know, it's sort of like, you know, classic. I think it was in the philosophy of Andy Warhol from a to b and back again. If I remember the title right, there's you know, classic New York tabloid mindset is again there's no such thing as it's not what they say about you, it's how many inches do they write about you, how many inches of text, how long is the article about you? Like this is what I'd call New York PR thinking. So you're absolutely right. Like in a very real way. Right? So I'll do my best there, Manny, to create controversy around your work. And also a lot of comments slash show.
00:19:46.242 - 00:20:05.078, Speaker A: Thank you for the math. You know, these are the numbers right now for, these are really good numbers for election season. So thank you for the, you know, eleven bookmarks is wonderful. 53 retweets. Really nice tuks. The great tuks. Amazing as usual.
00:20:05.078 - 00:20:20.890, Speaker A: Thank you. Skull takes great show. I don't mind cheap mint platforms like Zora and rodeo. I think people should tailor their time accordingly. Maybe don't mint finished work in the physical realm. We have stickers, t shirts, postcards for cheap. These platforms feel like the digital equivalent.
00:20:20.890 - 00:20:48.532, Speaker A: Yeah, fair enough. Fair enough. We're going to come back to this later in the tabs here, so let's leave this kind of free mint meta discussion till then. But let's keep it in mind as well. Let's yeah, and as I said, I think you should be able to mint wherever you want without judgment. Kells great show, Adrian. Admirably, admirable how you go all in on thoughtful replies like the one on Santiago's recent piece.
00:20:48.532 - 00:21:03.240, Speaker A: Feel better soon. Thank you. And feeling much better. We'll see how the we'll see if the screen unfreezes here. Thank you. Kels and Kells just put out a video. By the way, I late name of artist is santiago ni Marquez, so I believe.
00:21:03.240 - 00:21:30.846, Speaker A: Not sure how Santiago says his name in speaking or officially. He should have the comment to that specific reality at the time of his choosing. So here is the actual name of the artist for that person that was asking, I believe, on YouTube. And actually they replied, we'll get back to that in a second. So there is the name Santiago ni Marquez K's works, also known as Oyeni Coyote. Marvelous watch as always, and thank you so much for the feature. Much appreciated.
00:21:30.846 - 00:21:59.996, Speaker A: I do resonate with artists, being technologists, making images and creating an effect, one that can only be triggered by viewing their work. I do enjoy your style of analyzing the pieces. Thank you. I believe you can go deeper if you choose to, and you do so in some instances, but like you said, it defeats the purpose of your journal and will take much longer than an hour. Absolutely. And I'd rather kind of COVID a lot of what's amazing out there than again, who wants? Yeah, we made the points last episode. Thank you.
00:21:59.996 - 00:22:34.326, Speaker A: And yes, digital art has come a long way to the extent that it is almost indistinguishable from traditional art. And artists, me included, have begun to experiment with a more textured finish as compared to a more refined and blended look. That characterized digital art. It's fun blurring the lines, experiment and exploring what's possible. Digital art has so much potential. I totally agree what I, you know, I think we're just scratching the surface, so to speak, of digital art in a sense, no pun intended. With all the discussion of texture, we are just scratching the surface here of what's possible.
00:22:34.326 - 00:23:07.344, Speaker A: Like I see it as an artist, the possibilities are endless. Here they multiply, every software multiplying against. You could combine two softwares at random and start coming up with a new process, a new image making technology. As we were discussing retro Manny, it happened. Santiago has finally entered the zeitgeist. That long comment king slime. I like how a big, how a guy critiquing art on Tezos has the ability to comment on how they believe zero one isn't growing.
00:23:07.344 - 00:23:55.740, Speaker A: So yeah, so this is interesting. So I just haven't seen anything on zero one, which is why I was assuming it isn't growing. But as I say here, fair enough. If it's growing and then zero one chimed in, actually, mobile app has created a lot of new and renewed engagement, many global new users joining and over 1000 nfts created every day. Why not give it a try? So yeah, I'm not huge and we'll discuss the free mint thing. I mean, put it this way, I think it's a really special thing that digital artists can get paid for their work and are being paid for their work the last two or three years. But I don't think we should take it for granted at all that it will always remain this way.
00:23:55.740 - 00:24:31.032, Speaker A: So, yeah, so I'm not huge on, oh, let's just give the art away, whatever. Zero one has its own meta with like trading and its own thing and that's cool and fine. Right? Same with rodeo. You know, nothing against anyone, but I, again, I don't think it should be taken for granted that people will keep getting paid for their digital art. So I think it's, yeah, so that's kind of so I'm not dying to in a sense, but I appreciate that. And it's really awesome to hear from zero one and Kingslime, you know, fair enough. Maybe it's huge.
00:24:31.032 - 00:24:48.540, Speaker A: Zero one again. I'm not seeing anything on Twitter though, just across my feed and that could just be my feed. But thank you and congratulations on the app. Marcel Munciano. Oh, that's so great. Beginning of the show today. Dear Poco, we're always welcome on conversation.
00:24:48.540 - 00:25:00.676, Speaker A: Tuna comparts thank you. Show tomorrow birthday. Thank you, Marcel and heart of the computer era. We have a beautiful work actually from that show. And here are all the speakers and everything. And there it is. 31.
00:25:00.676 - 00:25:13.080, Speaker A: Only 31 tuned in. This is a crime. It's summer. That's what I would say. So yeah. But I thank you for the invite and please feel free to message next time you have a show. I will do my best to attend.
00:25:13.080 - 00:25:33.560, Speaker A: Very cool show. We have another work. I think it's ugodigi with a fantastic work. This episode from that show that accomparts did, rural idol, found the seed phrase to my old psychedelic wallet finger. So over to the community. So people posting their work here. Rural idol, who we've had on the spaces, found the seed phrase to my old psychedelic wallet finger.
00:25:33.560 - 00:25:53.624, Speaker A: Painted mobile works from 2022. Idly made during discord and Zoom calls. So very cool here, let me know. Let's just take a quick look. And tea is loading up so much better. So very cool. So it looks like maybe this is made and is this made on his on phone first? Painted mobile works very cool.
00:25:53.624 - 00:26:19.142, Speaker A: I still think the. Like this is classic. As many of you know, I've worked on the phone a ton. It's still my favorite tool and one of the reasons I like it is because I feel like the composition by virtue of the small canvas, but that you can zoom in, you know, almost infinitely to a very large degree. It creates a fresh compositional style. And you see it here. You see how this is like.
00:26:19.142 - 00:26:41.250, Speaker A: If you were working on a two meter by two meter painting, would rural idol have done this? Probably not, I would argue. Whereas if it's on a tiny thing, then it's just like do, do, do. And then just do, do, do. Or I'll do this at the bottom. And there's your work. So you see how the scale of your canvas changes. But with digital, you can still make it huge and you can make this the side of a wall.
00:26:41.250 - 00:26:57.666, Speaker A: So I continue to be super excited with just mobile and the freshness of how it looks. So thank you for posting that. Oh yeah. Blizznets hey fam. So philosophy day. This is on exchange art. So cool work here by Ilya blizznets.
00:26:57.666 - 00:27:11.466, Speaker A: Very cool. Kind of painterly work here. And that again is on Solana Louie. Awesome to hear from you. Two and a quarter years and a thousand minutes later, it all began with the incubator. Incubator. And has arrived at born to play.
00:27:11.466 - 00:27:30.242, Speaker A: The inscription for the first ever object.com mint was somewhat cryptically presient. The journey is yet to begin, but it's a course set in motion long ago. So here I believe are a couple of works by Louis. I think we were just looking at a work by Louis yesterday as well. And here the Kurt Hussle collective posting some work here. Hilarious.
00:27:30.242 - 00:28:02.276, Speaker A: And wait till you see, actually auctions are happening. Pretty significant auctions for Kurt Hussle Collective's work first syndrome. Thank you for posting. A 1960s filmmaker that experimented with light play, rapid cuts and texture, and Requiem de la Nuez, a new painting here sold out on object.com. congratulations. Looks very cool and Kurt Hussle and we are done with the community. Martin Bruce thank you pokebelly for featuring and starting your amazing show with my work dinner.
00:28:02.276 - 00:28:11.090, Speaker A: I'm really happy to be a part of your show. The digital artwork is available for auction for only 0.05 on a comparts. Just saying. So awesome. Thank you. It's awesome.
00:28:11.090 - 00:28:41.244, Speaker A: Always awesome to hear from the artists in the show. Gloom tube pokebally does such a good job showcasing artwork, but also articulating and dissecting the concepts inside them, often better than the artists kid. It's nice to hear and yeah, it's great. I'm glad you appreciate it. And those trash bag window works are hilarious from Gloomtube. Check them out on object Edmarola I'm updating my website and it got me thinking about the meaning of art. Again, I'm very close to a conclusion, and it is something in the lines of there is no art.
00:28:41.244 - 00:29:01.124, Speaker A: Art doesn't exist. But how? What are we doing here? What is all this stuff we call art? Will I be able to follow the discussion with pokebelly last week? I got it. I understand my point of view. Art is abstract, therefore it only exists in our imagination. That's an interesting point. That's a very interesting point. So far so good.
00:29:01.124 - 00:29:53.822, Speaker A: There is no natural trait to an object that classifies it as art. Nor art, nor art like in fine arts. You know, you could argue, I would argue, you know, what makes humans different from animals? And I would argue the difference between humans and animals, actually, and it's not necessarily black or white, but let's call it 95% dark gray, is the ability to appreciate beauty. And this ability to appreciate beauty is arguably what civilizes us in the moral sense, right? Which, and maybe Kant would totally agree with all this. So maybe I have inconsistencies. Let's see. But it's, you know, when we see a beautiful action, we say, that is morally good.
00:29:53.822 - 00:30:12.090, Speaker A: And that's a beautiful. When someone does something nice, we go, isn't that beautiful. Ultimately, it's a thing of beauty. And when someone does something violent or terrible, we say, ooh, that's ugly. I don't like that. Right. So this idea of beauty, I think, is kind of at the core of kind of what civilizes us.
00:30:12.090 - 00:30:39.006, Speaker A: And so to your point, so it not being in nature, it's kind of an interesting point, one could argue it's kind of a aspect of humanity that's different from the rest of nature. Let's just finish what Ed is saying here. I'm confused again. I believe art doesn't exist yet. I make it every day I get the chance, all day, every day when I get the chance and when I don't feel bad. So maybe art is therapy for me, an activity. Maybe for you, it's something else.
00:30:39.006 - 00:31:07.960, Speaker A: Art is a job, like Santiago reminded us a few months ago, very important. But what consists of this job to give the public's mind a mirror where they can feel part of their time, to explain in an incomprehensible way what it is all about makes no sense. So the struggle continues. And I thought this was quite brilliant. I'm going to go quite quickly. So Ed's showing just a window into the behind the scenes here of Ed's files. Look at all the work and everything.
00:31:07.960 - 00:31:33.900, Speaker A: I think this is great. This is kind of like going into the artist's studio here to a certain degree, and doing this is like a studio visit of sorts. I mean, hilariously so. Interesting post from Ed. So now, cyber mystic, also known as Marcelo Pinel. So another big sale on Tazos sold on secondary. Thank you so much to Adir collectors who collected four pieces in secondary.
00:31:33.900 - 00:32:01.194, Speaker A: So more sales, kind of. I feel a glow emanating from tezos. And for those that don't know, this is Marcelo Pinel, a very cool, you know, psychedelic artist. I consider the, the heir to Alex Gray, I think, in my mind. And so, yeah, just an awesome artist there. So more sales, though, is where I'm going with this. Here's Kurt Hussle collective edition of one now at 250 tezos.
00:32:01.194 - 00:32:27.904, Speaker A: I guess the auction just finished, so sold for 250 tezos. Here a die with the most likes just went for $1,500. 2000 tezos dine at Annie's pretzel. So an early die with the most likes. This is an edition of three. So impressive in an early John Carroll work, windows still life number 74. And this sold for 800 tezos, or $600.
00:32:27.904 - 00:32:50.020, Speaker A: So some pretty interesting moves here. It seems like some collectors are starting to want to secure these early grails of the Tezos ecosystem. How else would it start? And back to Haiti. Rockette just went off here. Look at this. Hyper media dreams. Look at the date on this.
00:32:50.020 - 00:33:24.574, Speaker A: November 1 to January 31, 2016. So 2015. 2016. There's Xcopy, right? And all these artists here. So John Cates, awesomely. So again, for those that don't know Haiti, Rockette, like, I mean, true, you know, someone making digital art on the scene really radly, you know, before any of this NFT, you know, crypto business, unknown collector. So gonna have to go as fast as we can here.
00:33:24.574 - 00:34:01.140, Speaker A: Interesting read. So fungible, a prominent account here, basically compared rodeo and Zora, rodeo's platform and Zora's app and basically said how, you know, basically compared the two. So something to look at. Unknown collector, interesting read. Definitely it's fun to use, but I also both platforms or maybe rodeo. But I also personally feel the free mint meta is corporate advertising much more than really helping most artists in the long run. That said, there are clearly different examples and artists paying the bills with them on Zora.
00:34:01.140 - 00:34:38.020, Speaker A: And this is kind of what it all comes down to for me personally. Like, I'm not against rodeo. If all of a sudden rodeo is bringing a million collectors and then we charge ten cents and then we get $100,000 for a work or whatever the case might be, or you get 100,000 collectors, but that's not where we are right now. It's largely an unproven case. On rodeo. You really post for free and I wouldn't recommend giving away your art like that. They also don't advertise it like that and see it more like an instagram where you can earn a little with normal content.
00:34:38.020 - 00:35:10.646, Speaker A: So a place for I'm not sure what BTS is, but works in progress, etcetera. So always know what you mint and where and why. Definitely recommend checking out everything new that comes to the market and can help you pay the bills. But also be cautious about risks and pitfalls. So more pushback on rodeo. And I totally agree, I think proceed with caution. And again, I'm kind of back to that statement I was making earlier, like, do not take for granted that you are paid for your digital art.
00:35:10.646 - 00:35:32.352, Speaker A: That doesn't need to happen. Look at the music industry. I think actually this is what Nicholas Assun says. Collecting art for pennies is not sustainable for artists, might be fun and engaging for other types of content, but 99% of artists will never make a living through such economic models. If you need a sad example, look at the music industry. Exactly. Don't sell yourself short.
00:35:32.352 - 00:36:10.624, Speaker A: No, exactly. And there is. Yeah, like because it can happen. It can be spotified and even fungible was mentioning how, you know, maybe rodeo needs to at least raise the fee to a dollar, right? So Addo, who of course I follow that is a glitch on x when you are minting or so when you're opening a whole bunch of tabs. This, please be mindful what you give away for free, especially as the free mint meta has taken over the east space. So again, I'm not against, say, Zora because Zora charges like $3 for the free mint or whatever it is, the last I checked. And then they split that with you, as far as I remember.
00:36:10.624 - 00:36:37.000, Speaker A: I mean, so you're getting a couple buck, $52 from what I remember from Azora Mint. So that's not bad if all of a sudden 100 people mint your work. Some people do really well. There's a huge community on Zora, so. And they built that community first, and then they did the free mint. Interestingly meta. And that kind of changes, you know, like they have a huge community, kind of like an OG community there on Zora.
00:36:37.000 - 00:36:55.666, Speaker A: Object one after a small break post basel, we have the pleasure to announce our next solo drop. Barbie World the breakdown sessions by Sabato. So that's on Thursday, August 1. So Sabato on object one. So very cool there. So I guess object one is curating that. And here's Hermipe pixel art.
00:36:55.666 - 00:37:31.878, Speaker A: So more examples. I think these are other Rezo graphs, as you see here. And you see how powerful resograph makes a lot of sense to me for big pixels. It made me think that kind of eight bit nature series I have, who would that look like as Rezo? Because you get the texture inside, but you still get kind of like the hard edges of the pixels because it's printed or photocopied, whatever you want to call it. Very, very interesting solution for kind of big scale or low resolution pixel art, as you see here. So quite powerful. Nice combo.
00:37:31.878 - 00:38:00.894, Speaker A: Rezo and pixel art. So into the works we go. I think we're doing pretty good for time. Ratcloak, check this out. How weird is this? Your MLB team, of course I follow the great ratcloak there. Your major league baseball team. It kind of looks like a play on a baseball card, but a La Ratcloak here, still playing with this almost kind of liquidity that the figures turn into here.
00:38:00.894 - 00:38:37.142, Speaker A: This melting figure, distorted, transformed, kind of wild painting style here. And again, even kind of echoing here in this background structure, a baseball card kind of structure here to a certain degree, but also the mound. Very interesting work from Ratcloak. And maybe we can actually very quickly see if we can make that bigger. So a pretty rad, very beautiful digital painting. Rat cloak out of Ukraine. Continuing on Rosatio when you're ready to go.
00:38:37.142 - 00:39:06.200, Speaker A: But croc breathes fire. So a tribute to John Carroll, one of the Windows series, with other references to Debbie T. Gogoporin and NFT update, you can other, for sure. So Rosaceo meets John Carroll here in this Rosatio work. Really nice homage, I thought, beautiful edition of 18 and looks like it's sold out. So nice work from Rosatio. A lot of action on this.
00:39:06.200 - 00:39:34.896, Speaker A: Selling out at five tezos, so edition of 18, so almost like 90 tezos there. And here's another work from Rosatio that I missed. Gatekeeper, digital collage from CC Zero. I mean, this is what, you know, I've been given many invites to Rodeo's app or Rodeo's platform, even the Zora app. And it's sort of. I'm not into, like I was saying last episode, like, I don't come to crypto for gatekeeping. Like, this is it.
00:39:34.896 - 00:39:58.866, Speaker A: To me, it's almost anti crypto gatekeeping. Like it's against the ethos of crypto that you come here, finally, finance, you know, is, isn't it, isn't it a contradiction? You show up, finally, no banks, intermediaries between me and my finances. I can do what I want with it. I don't need permission from the bank. And then all, suddenly we have all these platforms that want to gatekeep. Sorry you have to do this. You need an invite.
00:39:58.866 - 00:40:22.104, Speaker A: And it's almost a disqualifier, you know, almost. I love Zora and will continue to use it, but for me, it's just like it's a turn off gatekeeping in crypto. And I can mint on bitcoin right now, finally. Like, it's really cheap right now. Let's see if it's still cheap. Still need to put out this video pronto, so everybody knows what they're doing. I mean, it's six.
00:40:22.104 - 00:40:49.122, Speaker A: This is very low, the fees. And you can even go through here. Look, it was four, four, three. You know how cheap this is getting. And you're going to worry about some gated platform, you know, and I'm going to waste my time looking for invites when I can mint on the big daddy ultimate blockchain. Anyway, rant over Rosacea's title triggered me. Anyway, beautiful color from Rosato here.
00:40:49.122 - 00:41:06.402, Speaker A: Kind of collage meets digital painting with GIF. GIF animation. Beautiful color. Day's awakening. New digital painting by uxine at a turkey. Rad work here. A little bit of humor with the microwave and the homunculi in the microwave.
00:41:06.402 - 00:41:23.860, Speaker A: Beautiful. Look at all the little details, the color, this beautiful palette that euxine has developed. Even the skull. Pixelated skull. There's so much going on in here, you know, painted pixels, by the way. And look at the files going across. Quite crispy, too.
00:41:23.860 - 00:41:47.352, Speaker A: They're quite crisp, interestingly. And here, a little bit of meta, you know, almost like this metaphysical painting here, hilariously, a kind of crucifix. Crucifix cross a lot going on here. And you gotta love the kind of ASCII drawn out ASCII text. Just rad, rad, rad. Sold out now 60 tezos. So it's sold out at 30 tezos on primary.
00:41:47.352 - 00:42:08.620, Speaker A: And just a beautiful sketch here. I don't know if this is a preview or of a former work, but you see here, you see just all the detail that goes into Euxine's work with this little bit of spray or mask here. Sprayed mask. Not sure in the computer. Instantly recognizable as Euxine here is rhinifish. As we continue here. Tame your inner critic.
00:42:08.620 - 00:42:32.630, Speaker A: Great title. Brand new from runifish. And let's see, this is full size and kind of playing with the background here a little bit. Doing some development on the background textures here. Almost like this pixelated, textured, pixelated environment. Kind of breaking apart the mold a little bit. The traditional look of stretching.
00:42:32.630 - 00:42:56.070, Speaker A: Rinny Fish's work. Interesting clouds here too, but playing with, but keeping the basically psychedelic transparencies, those pastel psychedelic transparencies. Just rad. Big shout out and thank you to Ilay for sending me one of these. Really cool work. Eternal recurrence by hasdrubal waffle. This is powerful.
00:42:56.070 - 00:43:29.504, Speaker A: And listen to the music. Beautiful drone. It's for four minutes. Great musician as well. And look at the originality of this work. Just a fabulous, fabulous work, one assumes, referring to Friedrich Nietzsche in the eternal recurrence. And yeah, so, edition of seven, Kuala Lumpur marathon.
00:43:29.504 - 00:43:47.488, Speaker A: So other works by so hastrubal waffle, this time going under cedar plank here. So pretty edgy. We like to challenge our aesthetic expectations out here. Not easy, you know. And again, this is what happens when you're consuming so many images. All of a sudden this is like, oh, very interesting. Look at this speed sign.
00:43:47.488 - 00:44:09.416, Speaker A: Look at how different that is. Look at these interesting colors. You know, daring, you know, is what you say. Whereas if you came to this, like, early on, or if you're just getting introduced to this scene, you might be like, what on earth is that guy talking about? Kuala Lumpur marathon. Awesome title. And here, using fantavision, one assumes ode to OBe. And maybe Obi Wan.
00:44:09.416 - 00:44:30.598, Speaker A: No, maybe a biker with a mustache. Not sure, but awesome orange frame there, too. Cool animation. And that's available for 50 tezos on object from. Also from cedar plank. And that first one was hastrubal waffle, putting out tons of work. It's very exciting when that happens.
00:44:30.598 - 00:44:45.742, Speaker A: Zozo. Beautiful peacock here. Divan. Peacock. I think the divan is the name of this chair, if I'm not mistaken. More interesting audio. Love the idea.
00:44:45.742 - 00:45:04.454, Speaker A: Peacock. Peacocks are so beautiful and interesting as subject matter. So how are we doing? We're doing quick. Good for time. As we continue to cruise. Look at this brilliant work by NUV 1914. Just gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous.
00:45:04.454 - 00:45:40.070, Speaker A: What is going on in this bizarre flower that's almost like, made of neon? Looks like a neon light that's been curved over. Imagine making a physical. You could, I think of, like that bent. You know what they make for neon light signs? That would be some gorgeous flowers. They look gorgeous there. Again, if you're new to this scene, you might go like, not sure I understand what you guys are loving about this, but this, you know, this is, if you follow this artist for a while, this is spectacular, this work here. Look at the juxtaposition again, this upsetting of aesthetic expectations is kind of like a huge deal.
00:45:40.070 - 00:45:58.332, Speaker A: Even this frame here, but no frame there. Just interesting focal edition of two. Interestingly, there's first syndrome. Awesomely new collector. I wonder. Here is an artist I hadn't seen before, Eofeo Dwyer. If I'm pronouncing that right, this is on rodeo.
00:45:58.332 - 00:46:09.804, Speaker A: So again, we don't have the maximize. Let me see if I can make it bigger. Amelia Versace. So it's nice to have comments here. And 28 mints so far. Looks like AI. This is AI.
00:46:09.804 - 00:46:30.944, Speaker A: Interesting. So very interesting AI artwork here. Beautiful color, as Amelia points out. So that could be in the AI section here is a hilarious work by cider with stretching things out here. Let's see what happens when we zoom in. Look at this. Look at these wonderful painterly textures that cider has here.
00:46:30.944 - 00:46:52.794, Speaker A: Just amazing. And a little bit of humor, too. And this looks like maybe a CRO magnon. Look at this. Almost like, yeah, that looks like an ancient, ancient skeleton. There's actually some, it's a fascinating, what would we call that? Paleo anthropology? If you go to the British Museum. Which one.
00:46:52.794 - 00:47:15.128, Speaker A: It's not the British Museum, it's actually the natural History Museum in London. That you will, there are some fantastic. You have Lucy. I mean, for example, I was just there actually a couple of months ago, three months ago. Here is definitely worth a visit. Here's Dancontrol on rodeo. So to Dancontrol's credit, starting an ok new platform.
00:47:15.128 - 00:47:59.486, Speaker A: Here's a new series and I think that's cool. I take the same approach if I'm going to hit a new platform, like I did say with exchange art, let's make a new series. How does this platform feel? Pretty cool work too here with combining text. Quite smart I this work and adding a little bit of gradient, which is Dan Control's kind of, you know, signature move here. Quite, quite smart. And a nice addition to the oeuvre as we were discussing using that word last episode, the myth on Zora, the joy of death, of course, the myth, one of the great artists out of the tezos scene. Also minting on Zora Whydeh.
00:47:59.486 - 00:48:32.288, Speaker A: Probably because, you know, you all six minted so far, just listed yesterday and already, you know, $12 in his pocket. You know, how many will he have by the end of the month? So continuing on, Kurt Hussle collective gradients from the Olympics. Banned from the Olympics. There's JNK and Terry visual what happened there is a melting basketball and a broken skateboard. So I have to admit I haven't watched a ton of the, I haven't watched any of the Olympics. I watched a couple of things on, on XDev and the Olympic rings. I thought it was hilarious, though.
00:48:32.288 - 00:49:14.722, Speaker A: Edition of 97 for three tezos each. Haiti rocket picking up a couple psycho futurist simple machines for world domination. I thought this was pretty rad. We see these kinds of animations from psycho futurists often kind of these almost metaphysical looking animations. Very cool version with all of this, you know, Im like, because for me, normally I would think of this as kind of like archaic or archanic, I want to say imagery, but not necessarily anchor from a ship, you know, so interesting combination of objects here. Simple machines for world domination. And what a title edition of ten sold out.
00:49:14.722 - 00:49:35.512, Speaker A: The market continues to show a wonderful resilience here. And here is Ed Morolla. It's unlike anything I've seen before. Word. So interesting title edition of 30. And here just a small animation in this work of someone looks like a woman sitting against a wall. It's a cool cap.
00:49:35.512 - 00:49:58.314, Speaker A: And all of these, the beautiful textures and everything that go to make up an ed Marolla work. And look at the contrast with the bottom here. All of this kind of complicated texture contrasting with this very simple floor. Brilliant. And look at these great cowboy boots. Look at the interesting ratio of the canvas. Canvas ratio.
00:49:58.314 - 00:50:25.522, Speaker A: Very interesting promo material for balla film, hallaha film. Not sure what that is, but we'll keep looking. Here's Santiago on x. Look at this. So pretty interesting piece here, as we see from Santiago. I am accepting this beautiful colors here and interesting looking. Like it's using illustrator to maybe trace a lot of these textures in here.
00:50:25.522 - 00:50:45.770, Speaker A: Kind of looks like vector, vectorized. And look at that. Interestingly, kind of gets his results and then maybe puts it into illustrator. A lot of exporting. This is quite hilarious. I assume referencing the comment from last show, not pushing any artistic boundaries that I haven't seen explored for the past quarter century, at least. Hilarious.
00:50:45.770 - 00:51:06.828, Speaker A: I even own one awesomely. Thank you. Thank you to Santiago. And I should have brought up that tweet where. Yeah, anyways, uh, just rad artwork here. Look how cool this is. So again, uh, yeah, pretty, as far as I'm concerned, uh, pretty original stuff out here.
00:51:06.828 - 00:51:30.766, Speaker A: Look at this. Uh, and I love the. I love this kind of, you know, we saw it in NUV, 1914, almost like these kind of double compositions, but there is overlap here, but like, almost like, almost like a diptych, but nothing. Very, very, very interesting. Looks like art, doesn't it? Looks fabulous. Here's someone called Internet junk, I believe. And this is on Zora.
00:51:30.766 - 00:51:51.144, Speaker A: Danielle Junkwira is the name. Kind of a wild work here. Almost abstract, but not actually has a ton of stuff in it. And interesting border here as well. Right? Not your typical rectangular border. Kind of looking like a collage of sorts. Pretty cool.
00:51:51.144 - 00:52:14.544, Speaker A: 27 minted so far. And also at 111 mints, equals a physical print. Interestingly so, not exactly sure what that means. If you make maybe 111 mints, you get a physical print. So people having fun on Zora, already 27 minted again. Here comes the, you know, it makes a huge difference. The multiplier on it being $0.17
00:52:14.544 - 00:52:35.810, Speaker A: or ten x that, right? Luciana Guerra. So a new work edition of one. And this is owned by Danielle King, 50 tezos. Getting a one of one Luciana guerra out of Argentina. Maybe I will see Luciana. I am off to Argentina, actually. Show note, I am going to Argentina in about a week here, a little over a week.
00:52:35.810 - 00:52:57.442, Speaker A: So shows will be happening, but sporadic for about. Till August 25, two and a half weeks. Look at how beautiful this, these interesting, interesting artists. And I believe this is a digital work. Of course, Luciana works also physically. How are we doing? We're doing wonderful mumble boy, the invention. Great title.
00:52:57.442 - 00:53:23.520, Speaker A: And again, a very refined process here. An image making technology with several parts to it here. And even upside down photos. Awesome mask combining, like, digital elements. Just really super interesting and beautiful edition of one, only twelve tezos. And here, a couple of works by Braun. Loving these kind of, again, this nice white breathing space here.
00:53:23.520 - 00:53:43.120, Speaker A: Blank dot wave. Something about the simplicity of the color of this one. The colors really work here. And this is a little bit bigger. Yeah, so just super interesting abstract here. Some moving, some nothing, kind of looking like there's a static layer on top of a moving layer. Here's another one.
00:53:43.120 - 00:53:57.744, Speaker A: This one's on rodeo. Drop it and we'll see if we can make that bigger in another tab. How many minted? 85 minted. So. Right. I mean, it's not, it's not nothing. You know, if all of a sudden you're getting 15, $16, it starts to get interesting.
00:53:57.744 - 00:54:47.078, Speaker A: So let's see what happens. But again, it's always like we, you know, do you really want to sell your work for less? I mean, this is the ultimate question, because if, if they start getting, taking over, so to speak, the whole scene, like, your artists are just gonna get ten x less money. I mean, this is the question, right? Maybe the key, you know, is if you want to use it, you know, maybe as I think, as unknown collector was saying, you just don't go exclusively. And again, I wish everybody the best, but it is hard to get behind and excited about something where all of a sudden artists get way less for their money. Again, it's don't take it for granted is kind of the mantra here on this show. Look at Suisoichi Frenzy whistle 0.011 ETH open edition for another five days.
00:54:47.078 - 00:55:15.442, Speaker A: One minted so far. I thought this was a brilliant, brilliant work. This jester of sorts here. This is a super interesting, cool work. Playing the flute with this kind of radical, you know, gif style here. Kind of pixelated, you know, hand drawn animation is what it looks like, you know, cobra choral Sabato putting out a beautiful work here. And again, playing with this awesome contrast.
00:55:15.442 - 00:55:46.662, Speaker A: A new contrast, I call it, between moving and still arguably, commonly new. Anyway, newer contrasts here with the moving snake and the static images in the background and interesting. Again, this background is so interesting and cool subject matter. Also here is Ui. Touch me without using your hands from upcoming collection. So sad. So beautiful illustration here.
00:55:46.662 - 00:56:18.244, Speaker A: Kind of a surreal illustration. Let's continue getting weird freezes on the computer here. Caesar I exist. So this was actually on the object homepage and edition of one. Someone was mentioning that. And so kind of a very contemporary illustration here, right? Could be in any store that you walk into today. And there are works in the background and interesting work here from his 21st Earth song Caesar July 30 self portrait.
00:56:18.244 - 00:57:14.416, Speaker A: Interestingly, 21 tezos edition of one. Here is nesva ricuerdos de verano. And quite a cool actual animation here. Kind of a moving, moving piece. So not sure what that means, but sold out at six tazos. And here I thought this was quite brilliant too, the early stage of the piece because, you know, one of the most powerful, one of my favorite kind of ways of working is you have gray so that you can use white, and then white starts looking like white on gray. It's just gorgeous as you see here in the splashes, right.
00:57:14.416 - 00:57:28.080, Speaker A: It has its own effect. So anyways, cool to see that too. Here is sumi ryusi. Daisy. So interesting work from Sumi. Kind of more illustrative. And I think this is a friend of hers.
00:57:28.080 - 00:57:53.780, Speaker A: Interesting piece with the water and the duck looks like a pool and the duck is crying. Daisy. So I think a friend of hers. So maybe a homage of sorts to her friend. This is 500 tezos edition of one Seba sistero Onion. So edition of 15. And here, just interesting, kind of suggestive onion here.
00:57:53.780 - 00:58:15.976, Speaker A: And look at how huge this is. A little bit of texture there in the leaf. Interesting shadow. Kind of a surreal illustration from Seba sistero and a few selling danielle king and Cody of Houston. Picking up one here is Katarina. Create sandy beach and here, so a little bit more beach imagery we're seeing here. So just hanging out at the beach.
00:58:15.976 - 00:58:43.392, Speaker A: Beautiful umbrella and very fun water. Love the curly waves there. And half almost all moving except for the sky and the blanket. Interesting contrast. Here's oratur interesting piece on Instagram, as you see here. So kind of a surreal, you know, it kind of fits into a whole style like buboy and a few other artists. Here's another illustration, a lot of illustration.
00:58:43.392 - 00:59:04.672, Speaker A: This show. Jordy Gandal testing my beliefs. Kind of an old school Tezos artist. Interesting. Always kind of often does these city blocks here with different variations on it, different colors continuing on. OMG, I draw it also a OG Tezos account. You look at the art and it looks at you.
00:59:04.672 - 00:59:26.376, Speaker A: So you look at it and it looks at you. So another interesting illustration here, reflecting on art. And you see kind of some of it moving, some of it not just cool contrast. Interesting floor there. Edition of 51. Now ten tazos and selling a ton. Has a huge look at this huge collector base.
00:59:26.376 - 00:59:48.324, Speaker A: And that's just not even all of them. Here's Jake studios edition of one Encanto from New York. This came out a few. This came out maybe a week ago. This one went for only 14 tezos for this one of one from Jake Studios. Again, look at this kind of surreal animation here. Look at all those ears and tattoos.
00:59:48.324 - 01:00:04.204, Speaker A: Interesting piece. Here's another one. Jake Studios Lara one. This is on Zora. And so playing with a couple of ducks here, playing around in this piece. Interestingly. And there is, I think, Jake, if I had to guess, maybe those are the kids.
01:00:04.204 - 01:00:21.514, Speaker A: I don't know. Cool work there. This is not a paid advertisement. So Jake studios, I think putting his own work in a tv on. So kind of using the platform to his own ends. Rodeo, maybe. Not worrying.
01:00:21.514 - 01:00:30.826, Speaker A: Twelve mints. That's pretty good. And also some. So who knows? Who knows? Who knows? Let's continue. Daniel W. Arrival. So kind of a.
01:00:30.826 - 01:00:49.030, Speaker A: Almost a Sci-Fi metaphysical work from Daniel W. Interesting eye. And is that a geodesic dome? I'm not sure. It almost looks like UFO's in the background here. Not sure. And the person, the child with the long shadow. And interesting over there too.
01:00:49.030 - 01:01:06.436, Speaker A: So interesting piece. Edition of 140 tazos out of Brazil. We had Daniel W. On the spaces maybe six months to a year ago. Sahara sunset. This is element Li and we are going to have to start to hurry, but we're almost done here. So interesting element ly.
01:01:06.436 - 01:01:18.356, Speaker A: Putting out a ton of work here. Kind of a landscape. In this case, interesting light. Here's e boy arts. E boy wholesale. So I believe this is a real pioneer of pixel art here. So this is on.
01:01:18.356 - 01:01:49.008, Speaker A: We looked at the physical here the other day and here playing with this kind of 45 degree angle cube as a canvas, so to speak, or as a setting or a template. Here is, I believe, ugo digi. Ugo digi. Look at this beautiful work. This is fabulous. I don't think we've looked at this so simple, you know, again, if we weren't trying to be so challenging with the newspaper, the imagination could have easily started with this. Gorgeous very.
01:01:49.008 - 01:02:10.960, Speaker A: Again, part of it, moving part of it not nice. Rainbow again, contrasting with the black. Even this awesome kind of RGB, you know, cord for the mouse. Beautiful work this on a comparts. Another great piece. People bringing their a game to a comparts, aren't they? Andre Olivere Cibola interesting work here by Andre cool. Kind of red and black.
01:02:10.960 - 01:02:30.870, Speaker A: You gotta love red and black pixel artwork. Zrt ctrs 306 edition of ten for only 333. And this is pixelfool. Some graffiti and we are done. So not exactly sure. I think this is just like a piece. A cool piece I find just kind of interesting.
01:02:30.870 - 01:02:59.216, Speaker A: Mint on bitcoin for almost free at this point. Secure system. This is eight bit kit, I think. Posted by august ground here. What is the name? I thought it was kit velo maybe on x. Interesting piece, isn't it? Let's just zoom in a little bit as we speed through this show. Interestingly, Uri J's kind of early, kind of early stage of the process, seemingly not necessarily, but I think this is a work in progress.
01:02:59.216 - 01:03:20.982, Speaker A: Kind of working quite well in this part of the show over here. So interesting. Looks like Yuri J. This is kind of a window into Yuri J's process here. So very interesting. And cool here is, I think this is also Andre Oliveira, but I can't get the name here. Sable lander.
01:03:20.982 - 01:03:39.974, Speaker A: This is on rodeo. And this is generative art. Pixel art 13 minted so far. So interesting. Cool piece. And here is Francois Gamma OXP, I thought pretty cool work from Francois Gamma. Just a cool, different looking minimal work, a different kind of rendering.
01:03:39.974 - 01:03:58.454, Speaker A: Edition of 20, none sold so far. Three tezos native ed, flashy composition. Open edition for only eleven tazos cents. Pretty cool, pretty cool. Kind of animated abstract. And here is acidboy. Let me just fix this.
01:03:58.454 - 01:04:14.986, Speaker A: And this is on x. So psychedelic. Animated abstract from Acidboy. Here is Sean Luke. That's what I'm trying to do. Try shuffle. And here you see another classic Sean Luke piece.
01:04:14.986 - 01:04:31.150, Speaker A: Interesting frame here. And then just an abstraction. Animated abstract inside as well as the frame, animated. And again selling 55 tezos. 55 tezos $40 each edition of seven. Huge collector base there. Silva sand two's glitch fall.
01:04:31.150 - 01:04:55.048, Speaker A: So interesting from Silva sand two's here getting more abstract in the Nintendo glitch. Rom looks like a waterfall as we continue through our journey here. And here's John Cates on rodeo. Twelve and five, minted so far. And here I think I've seen. I want to say I've seen this work before. Just a cool glitch here.
01:04:55.048 - 01:05:16.978, Speaker A: Edgy glitch from John Cates, the pioneer of the glitch western genre inavare with a cool banana. I don't know if I've seen this one before. Cool. Analog video glitch here. Nice combination, nice subject and everything. Breakthrough from LB edition of ten for five tazos. So new lb work.
01:05:16.978 - 01:05:35.690, Speaker A: Again, analog video glitch. Kind of looks like a figure here, but mostly, mostly abstract. And here, DJ Curo on rodeo. And here, one minted. And another video painting. Cool. Abstract painting here from Kuro.
01:05:35.690 - 01:05:51.978, Speaker A: And here's another one. This one's on Zora 17 minted. So you see a little comparison there. An interesting game boy in the background there, video painting from. From Curo. Very cool. And here is Klaus on rodeo.
01:05:51.978 - 01:06:15.852, Speaker A: And here you see a little bit 30 minted. Interestingly so there it is. So different variations. So Klaus bringing a different kind of work to rodeo. Of course, we know Klaus from the compositions here of 251. Here we are at. So kind of soothing work here.
01:06:15.852 - 01:06:35.602, Speaker A: Beautiful color as ever. And that sold to Doctor version for 21 tezos. And here is walk with a digital artwork, this time natively digital artwork. And I believe, again, this is from the Pokemon card series. Drowzee is the title. And that sold for three tazos. Good deal.
01:06:35.602 - 01:06:56.204, Speaker A: And here's RJ doing some AI work, I believe. I'm not positive on that, though. Game 20. So putting out a ton of work. These are additions of one. Maybe it's AI that eventually turns, it gets pixelated, or maybe it isn't AI at all, but I kind of felt like it looked like Aihdenhe. Maybe it's generative art.
01:06:56.204 - 01:07:18.560, Speaker A: Here's another one. Not sure what's going on here, but quite a few released here at 13 tezos each and has been playing with AI. So I wonder if it's AI. Here is bedala in the wild, number five experimental digital collage and drawing base of my old NFT. So this is actually experimental digital collage. I thought this was AI. Amazing.
01:07:18.560 - 01:07:38.208, Speaker A: So this, you know, kind of like these wild masks that you see on mumble boys work. Look at that. Amazing. Bedala edition of 710 tezos. And that is on secondary selling out at three tezos. Only here is Santiago. Again, I don't think we saw this one.
01:07:38.208 - 01:08:25.618, Speaker A: So another thing that makes Santiago's work persuasive is the consistency in tackling. Like, he'll put out 30 or 40 or more works. When he's tackling a certain idea, you know, a certain process, a certain aesthetic, you know, image making invention that he's doing, he'll really tackle it, which helps add to the credibility of the situation, I would argue. Here's Lily illo in the closing minutes here. Mother figure kind of has a pieta look to it, doesn't it? So cool AI painting by lily Illo, again using older I versions, I believe, of mid journey and stable diffusion and dal e. This gorgeous AI artwork by tuks, who we heard from in the comments there. Beautiful.
01:08:25.618 - 01:08:51.080, Speaker A: I mean, look at this. So original. Only colors bleed. Only AI would have made this. I would argue von Doyle with what is Virgil? The aeneid Venus could bear no more of his laments and broke in on his tale of endless hardship, the wasted Venus. So here, I think this is mostly AI AI in the tags here. So surreal AI from von Doyle.
01:08:51.080 - 01:09:23.370, Speaker A: And here's Filippo Francocci as we go into the physicals here in the closing couple of minutes. So interesting abstract, I believe, from Filippo francocci, again using random and then refining it from the random. This is gorgeous. A monotype. Interesting printmaking from the carpent on Thomas Carpenter on Instagram. Very cool. How many followers does this guy have? 8500.
01:09:23.370 - 01:09:50.274, Speaker A: Pretty good. Look at how great this is, you know, very nice piece. Nice color there too. It's not gallery continuing to deliver watchlist swag is the account. And look at this work. Hilarious kind of someone with what looks like a beer, but maybe it's just a drink and, you know, on their phone. So not paying attention at all to the road.
01:09:50.274 - 01:10:07.224, Speaker A: Speed limit 25. Your speed, 60. So a delinquent driver here as someone is crossing the road and a little girl on a bike. So little anti driver commentary here. Who can't relate to that one though. Schwarzer, Stefan Schwarzer. We've been following a lot here.
01:10:07.224 - 01:10:35.898, Speaker A: Doing really well, I believe, out of Germany. And this is at the Academy of Fine Arts in Leipzig. So nice piece here. And here is Abel Burger with another work on paper, I believe, mixed media on paper, wood. And nice contrast between the color, the drawing, again, you kind of got this white on the colored background here. Very nice. Or background color highlighting the white girl with pink cap.
01:10:35.898 - 01:10:55.350, Speaker A: Saniyo, Sani Yosebek. As you see here, the artist, oil pastel and mixed media. So this is on object. So a physical artwork here. Interesting piece. Edition of 50 for 150, selling a whole bunch. If you're starting, it's a good way to go, is just make it cheap.
01:10:55.350 - 01:11:26.894, Speaker A: You're much more likely to start getting collectors and getting people interested in your work. Another McDonald's work by Noah Verrier. My oil painting of the Oreo McFlurry. I think these are brilliant, you know, because at least you're getting the contrast between very modern imagery and, you know, traditional oil painting. And here is dye with the most likes and with some, with some poetry, we might call it, or with some writing. Beautiful painting. Look at this great work in the background here with all.
01:11:26.894 - 01:11:41.974, Speaker A: Doing a really good job of developing his physical art skills. I believe this is acrylic. Really beautiful. Doing just such a hard worker. And here's walk with Andy Warhol. I'm not sure if I've seen this one before. So cool portrait of Andy Warhol and chill.
01:11:41.974 - 01:11:52.710, Speaker A: Love it, love it, love it. From walk as well. And that is your show, everyone. Thank you for joining me. Hopefully I see you on the spaces. Until next time, take care.
