00:00:04.080 - 00:00:34.534, Speaker A: Take one. Here we go. It is haircut day, and we are continuing to move forward under a very interesting situation here geopolitically. Can you just feel the burning ness of the present burning through your consciousness right now? Welcome back, everyone. Artist journal Friday, March 1 It is March. The screen is freezing and there is nothing I can do. My name is Adrian Pokebelly, and welcome back.
00:00:34.534 - 00:01:03.350, Speaker A: This is the thing. This is the thing. The screen is freezing because I have so many tabs open, so I think I have to. And it's taking forever. I think I spent 3 hours compiling all of my bookmarks, so I have to somehow I need to reduce, and I think it's harder to consume for the viewer. So I'm gonna. I keep telling myself this.
00:01:03.350 - 00:01:29.518, Speaker A: I've literally been telling myself for this for a year. As long time viewers will know that I'm trying to reduce. We're gonna make it shorter. I keep promising, but I think I really do. And who knows? Like, it's always this balance here between, you know, curating and bringing in new people. Because you don't want me to show the same ten artists here, you know, every. And.
00:01:29.518 - 00:02:08.080, Speaker A: And that would be boring, even for me. So you always want to be bringing in new people, but it's always this kind of balance between the curation and inclusion really, here. So I guess let's not worry about it too much and just enjoy the fact that it is Friday and that the world continues here. And other than that, yeah, kind of a hard deadline in a couple of hours here, so we better finish before then. And I hope you're well. I mean, there's an incredible amount of news here. And I was almost thinking to myself, just finally here, like, you could practically, and, you know, you could.
00:02:08.080 - 00:02:44.712, Speaker A: There is so much art coming out in this scene, and just in general, digital art on the blockchain, but also on Instagram, contemporary art. And it's almost like we're in this unique time where you can kind of see it all. People are posting it in real time, you know, their finished works, and you could literally live stream. And I already spent a ton of time doing this, so. But it's an interesting thing. I mean, maybe just purely as an experiment, experimental broadcast, you could literally just go, okay, this. Let's check instagram.
00:02:44.712 - 00:03:27.564, Speaker A: Okay, this is out. Isn't this interesting? I don't think it would be as tight of a show, but just to demonstrate or just to illustrate or just to try and explain. Like, there's constantly interesting art coming out. And I was just thinking, like, how different this is from like 2000 to 2010 when it felt like. When it felt like nothing was happening, at least for me, maybe it was kind of like a hangover from the nineties. It felt like music was still trying to do what it was doing in the nineties. Art, you know, what was it, zombie formalism? Like? It felt totally desperado, I guess, in the digital sphere, you know, there was net art and everything, you know, so there was stuff going on there.
00:03:27.564 - 00:03:47.814, Speaker A: I was weirdly like, I love screenshots, but I was never really. I'm probably more into net art now than I would have been back then. I don't know how persuaded I was back then. So all to say to evolution here and to our own, the evolution of our consciousness. So here we. Let's begin. Here it is again.
00:03:47.814 - 00:04:21.572, Speaker A: It's hard to begin because there's so much to go through here. It is a titanic task here, but we're going to do it. And so why this? Why start with gloom tube here? And I'll tell you why. It's because it speaks to our moment. This is something we have all seen, I would venture to guess. This is something we have all seen, you know, an underpass of a highway, you know. Again, we're kind of back to gloom Tube's dystopian nightmare that we live in from Gloom Tube's perspective here.
00:04:21.572 - 00:04:54.742, Speaker A: And we see the homeless, you know, really setting up shop. Their homes are underneath this, you know, steel and iron here, you know, cement. And there was an interesting title on this was like, sigil. And then let me just check the title. Sigil's under the bridge now. I thought Sigil. I didn't look it up, but I thought Sigil, isn't that like a magic marking of sorts that people do? And I wonder if the sigil is referring to the graffiti here.
00:04:54.742 - 00:05:21.306, Speaker A: I'm not sure. Or maybe it means something completely different. And here, I mean, there's a bucket here. What are these people up to? Right? A book, a shopping cart. And then they're beyond the pollution. You know, in gloom tube, you'd almost have to assume this is haze. The polluting haze lies the larger downtown core of the city here.
00:05:21.306 - 00:06:02.992, Speaker A: But, you know, like, I was at an art opening yesterday and, you know, this is starting to become. Unfortunately, it's not even uncommon here in Berlin. But in North America, where I come from, you know, this is not an uncommon situation. But neither, you know, in Berlin either, you know, it's. I'd say it's not as common, but it's in North America. There are major problems here. So gloom tube, artistically recording, documenting, you know, artist, reporter, you know, to use Rauschenberg's term, which we haven't looked at, obscure, obscure Robert Rauschenberg term.
00:06:02.992 - 00:06:50.714, Speaker A: The artist reporter. I used to start this show. Maybe I'll start again this show with that term. And we can. Let's. We want. I want to review that term because here just documenting, you know, another just final thing before we move on here and basically sprint through this episode is we've been discussing a lot of literary ideas with this idea of incorporating historical antecedents, other authors, and as one of the ways you can go about creating work that is very kind of playing with what we might call the history of ideas as its kind of subject matter.
00:06:50.714 - 00:07:24.046, Speaker A: And then I saw this and I thought, how does this contrast with those kind of ideas and works? And you see how art is just so immediate. There's something moral. It's like nothing needs to be said here. You see, in a sense, this discussion for me personally, is highlighting the different qualities that say visual art has versus words. This speaks for itself. You don't need an explanation here. It speaks for itself.
00:07:24.046 - 00:08:07.498, Speaker A: And it's just simply, this could also be a photograph and it would probably have a similar effect, but it's maybe more powerful because it has been transmuted that the artist has decided to carefully, you know, has chosen, you know, to put, you know, there's more intent here because each little thing had to be drawn versus a photograph as we talk about all these different mediums, whether it's writing. And look at that. That's like an old. Looks like an old CD drive or something with a little motherboard there, circuit board. Just a powerful, powerful work. And interestingly, no people. And even interesting, you know, we were talking about photography here.
00:08:07.498 - 00:08:22.646, Speaker A: An interesting depth of field in the front here. So gloom tube keeping it interesting. This is an edition of one english auction. Not sure what that is. This is on Tazos greatest Tanuki. Got it for 90. Tazos, $113.
00:08:22.646 - 00:08:40.286, Speaker A: And Roerich starting the auction there with 80. So very cool. Congrats to both. Really just a moving piece. Thank you to Skomrog. Just posted to work yesterday, the Venus sketch. I am making art.
00:08:40.286 - 00:08:57.634, Speaker A: And so finally starting to post stuff now that I have a little reservoir here. Enjoying just. This is from the pixel art sketchbook. Just dithering and whatnot and everything. So again, thank you, Skamra. I put that at 25 tezos, and Skamra picked it up. So big shout out and thank you.
00:08:57.634 - 00:09:19.714, Speaker A: And I never mentioned this last episode, but it was great object here. We're happy to share from now on. Our front page includes a space for featured curations. Of course, I curate the show. All the Tezos works get put on my profile there on object. Everyday curations from the community will be highlighted. One more reason to try curations feature.
00:09:19.714 - 00:09:39.996, Speaker A: So they're starting to add them to the homepage we're kickstarting with four curations made by Pokebelly, who has already done no less than 20 curations. Yes. So big shout out and thank you to object. And I think I got a few followers out of that, made a few sales. Hopefully the computer doesn't crash here. So anyway, big shout out to object and thank you. Let's look at the comments here.
00:09:39.996 - 00:09:57.572, Speaker A: There's a hilarious one. Let me just make this a little bit bigger. So, last show, Muji, great show as always. Thank you so much for showing one of my pieces again. My pleasure, Muji. I believe we have another one. Another one of your beautiful deluxe paint computer works.
00:09:57.572 - 00:10:12.364, Speaker A: That was really poetic work too, that game Boy that was split in half. I remember Braindead, you know, relating to that. Pipi Universal. Excellent show, Pocompre. Best for you in your days. Legend of the game. Thank you, Pipi.
00:10:12.364 - 00:10:21.766, Speaker A: It's awesome to hear from you. And Kappa. Awesome to hear from you. I feel like this is like the argentinian contingent here. Great job. Thank you. Right click.
00:10:21.766 - 00:10:40.766, Speaker A: Awesome to hear from you. Get well soon from the airwaves here and the Internet in Berlin. And this was. I thought this was hilarious. This kind of made my evening. I came back from the art opening where. And I post them on Instagram, by the way, in the stories, if people just want little kind of glimpses into Berlin art scene.
00:10:40.766 - 00:11:20.320, Speaker A: Tyler, this show is so weird and rad. It's like art school critique as home shopping network. So this was hilarious and I loved it. And, you know, the last couple of days, the hyper postmodernism episode, for whatever reason, has something like 1200 views on YouTube, which I think is, you know, weirdly, I've done this show for like a year and a half. It should be getting more views to a certain degree on YouTube, but I don't really do a ton of SEO at all, actually, and. But maybe people are putting in post modern. Anyways, I got a few subscribers and so what this reminded me of is the bubble.
00:11:20.320 - 00:11:58.912, Speaker A: Like, we talk about the bubble here and how people might kind of see the artwork that we're doing here from outside the bubble but this kind of really reminded me of, like, how weird would this show be if you just kind of stumbled across it, maybe putting in postmodernism into YouTube and you have no idea what's going on here. So anyway, Tyler, thanks for the hilarious comments there and welcome all new subscribers. If you don't know what's going on, this is normal. This is totally normal. You'll get it. And if you have questions, just leave a comment and I'll answer them. Whether it's trying to figure out wallets, whatever, I can point you in the right direction.
00:11:58.912 - 00:12:21.586, Speaker A: If people are confused here, and that includes family members, shout out to mom, too, who does seem to understand, though. But other family members sometimes get confused. Anyways, let's continue here. So we talked about Luciana Guerra. So that was awesome. By the way, the space we did with Luciana Guerra, check that out. It's still pinned up there.
00:12:21.586 - 00:12:40.718, Speaker A: And I also just wanted to bring up, there is so much going on in this episode. Okay. And I want to bring up the comments also. So again, that's pinned up in the space in the tweet. Thank you, runetune and Luciana, for an awesome space. Super interesting artist out of, I believe, Argentina. Out of Argentina.
00:12:40.718 - 00:12:56.150, Speaker A: Kells, great stuff. Adrian, thanks for sharing. My pleasure, Kells, always great to hear from you. Appreciate the support. Kurt hussle collective with some dolphins there. And so great to hear from a legend. Speaking of legends there, Kurt Hussel collective, Juano Pedro, the neighbors.
00:12:56.150 - 00:13:08.224, Speaker A: Babe, wake up. The new artist journal just dropped. Hilarious. Denise Zonillard and primitive, thank you for the works. Again, feel free to post these. This is pretty cool, by the way. Primitive.
00:13:08.224 - 00:13:31.850, Speaker A: Post these in the community because I actually, that's where I look like for, so, you know, for lack of better term submissions, which I'm trying to kind of reduce the amount of works in a sense, in a daily show. But I still want to be able to look at everything. So post it in the place you post is in the community, and I'll show you that in a second here, if you don't know. Thank you. Imitras amazing creators. Totally. Lepro chant.
00:13:31.850 - 00:13:48.282, Speaker A: Awesome to hear from you. And Noel Rose, I hope you dedicate number 313 to Donald Duck. I didn't know what that meant. Is there, I don't know the association with 313 to Donald Duck, but I feel like I should. I'm like, is that. No. The first appearance of Donald Duck, that was four color comics.
00:13:48.282 - 00:14:07.792, Speaker A: Number four, right. Like I feel like I should know with all my comic lore. So again, thank you, everybody who's posting. The community continues to grow. Here it is on my profile. You just, I'll just show you here quickly. You just click on here on my x profile and it takes you to the community.
00:14:07.792 - 00:14:49.000, Speaker A: So thank you, everybody who is posting. And it's actually, again, it helps the show. We're actually going to discuss this in a second here. Luke 500. We're starting to see institutions, for lack better term, buy in, back into crypto. I think this ETF business, this bitcoin ETF business, say, when I go out yesterday, sometimes I'm introduced as like the digital art NFT guy. And again, the first thing you hear from people outside the bubble is scams like, oh, isn't that the thing with all the scams? Like, is it not dead? And you have to say, well, actually, bitcoin's almost out of record here, but a lot of these people still own crypto, hilariously.
00:14:49.000 - 00:15:18.780, Speaker A: Or a little bit of bitcoin. Um, so, moma, you're starting to see a few different moves here. And I think the bitcoin ETF is helping legitimize from an institutional perspective, an art institution perspective that, oh, you know, maybe these waters we can go back into. Tippy toe back into. Because what if. And this is another thing, you know, bitcoin's been going vertical and in the last, like few weeks, at least. Last, right, the last few weeks.
00:15:18.780 - 00:15:41.180, Speaker A: I mean, year out of nowhere, it seems like we're almost at the all time highs. And then with AI, I was listening to an interview with a prominent AI newsletter writer. I mean, it's astonishing what's going on. And actually I posted a link that I learned. This is great. I never even saw this azaniyar. I'll show you the link in a second.
00:15:41.180 - 00:16:02.514, Speaker A: So just a wonderful place to enjoy art. And the link is actually below. And here's bolles with a very cool work on Zora. So isn't that great? And I love the selection, the dancing ants from Photoshop, making that a part of the work is super original. Thank you for posting that. Wizardkin with some edgy works. Thank you for posting those.
00:16:02.514 - 00:16:22.294, Speaker A: And Verkanter, whose name is Eggy. This is what I was talking about. App suno AI. This is a music generator where you basically put in the prompt and so you can find it in the community. Here, the link, Edmorolo was using it. And I mean, yeah, so anyway, we're having a lot of fun over here. This, I put this in the show.
00:16:22.294 - 00:16:41.198, Speaker A: I hadn't seen Emily's work before. So same with this one. So I'll just say these, all these works, actually, a lot of these works have been in, are put in the show. So this is Sphero file, which is the moma's minted on Ethereum. Right. So this is the moma curator. Moma, right.
00:16:41.198 - 00:17:08.124, Speaker A: Group exhibition. So it's, you see how they're almost, it's like they don't want to call it Moma crypto Ethereum. It's like they still want to put like. And maybe Fiora files, like some other thing, but it seems like they don't want to put it on the MoMA website just yet. Maybe they have, maybe I'm mistaken. But again, it's, to me, this is like dipping your toes in the water, but they don't want to get burned if all of a sudden something happens. And crypto is, you know, all of a sudden Persona non grata once again.
00:17:08.124 - 00:17:21.100, Speaker A: So some sort of sound machines. Again, I found it confusing. 30 sets of five works. Thank you, Luke. 500 for posting. Nice piece here. Play from memory number one, but then a yoko Ono piece.
00:17:21.100 - 00:17:55.484, Speaker A: And then, you know, so just kind of weird set number two. And then they have the same artists, but like a different kind of rendition. So may, you know, maybe that's part of the concept of the show. I don't know what they're doing. Just be super blunt about it. But it's interesting that they are doing something and bidding starting at three ETH, right. So money, you know, you know, again, we're, and I don't know if I have the alliance survey, we'll see if I have the alliance survey tweet.
00:17:55.484 - 00:18:26.884, Speaker A: Because, you know, being the art world is not exactly booming right now in terms of the physical, contemporary art world. As far as what we're seeing in stories, I'm not in the front lines. I'm not in the galleries. I'm not on the phone. But what we're gathering and just kind of little hints here and there would suggest that there has been a slowdown. Of course, we've seen stories from Katya Kazakhina, the art detective on Artnet, to that effect. Now here's another interesting move.
00:18:26.884 - 00:19:05.942, Speaker A: So Musee d'Alce, the famous impressionist museum in Paris. There, housed in a former railway station in the heart of Paris, today the Musee d'Orsay has the largest collection of impressionist and post impressionist art in the world. They have some sort of thing that they've done with object one. So again, more institutional interests. This was just announced in the last couple of days here, as far as I understand, major institutional, you know, the institution of impressionist art. And then I opened opensea today. And isn't this interesting? Elman X the Scream 1895 Litho.
00:19:05.942 - 00:21:00.876, Speaker A: And this has something to do with the Art Institute of Chicago. So, you know, again, what's so weird, you know, and the radical thought I had in my head as I walked in the sun yesterday was, what if, you know, we think of 2021, 2020 and 2021 as the greatest speculative bubble of all time. I put the tulip mania to shame. Some of these people were making 1000 x on their investments, astonishingly, getting rich overnight, buying the right meme coin and becoming millionaires. And what if, and it's a radical thought and definitely not financial advice, and I'm skeptical of it myself, what if, with AI and crypto, what if bitcoin does go vertical? What if bitcoin goes to 500,000? What if it goes to a million dollars? What if Cathie wood is right? What if Raoul Powell is right? What if the AI thing and crypto basically launch us to an unrecognizable world in ten years? You know, and then, you know, maybe, you know, first of all, that's kind of a mind like, what if 2020 and 2021, the greatest speculative bubble of all time, was an appetizer in this kind of, you know, what do they call it, the exponential age? It's a kind of a scary thought, isn't it? Like, so just for me, like, you know, personally, like, that's like, what if? And I I don't even just the fact that I'm thinking that that might even be a possibility is shocking to me. So all to say, institutions, the hype train is getting warmed up here, shall we say, salwaki bringing it all back home here. March 1.
00:21:00.876 - 00:21:53.128, Speaker A: Happy birthday, hicket nunc. This day, three years ago, I created a Tezos wallet, and my life has changed for the better since then. And Saloaki, of course, is one of the first mentors on hand. And so congratulations to Salawaki, who we had on a space, a great individual, I think we have a famous, one of her famous trout works, I believe is in this show. So anyway, so, you know, Han Naotea is now three years old, and this is interesting as well. So Zora now has blast support, I think blast is another L2, on Ethereum, on the Ethereum blockchain, which I think is related to that newer marketplace that disrupted Opensea, who's blur, I think. So again.
00:21:53.128 - 00:22:41.374, Speaker A: So I bring this up just because it's airdrop season. Who knows? Again, not financial advice, but you see already 7500 minted. I think the reason people are minting this work of art here is because maybe you get an airdrop. I think it's the. With the hope of getting an airdrop. I minted one because, of course, blast is expected, I believe, to do an airdrop, which is free money for those that are wondering, Zach, who is, I'd say I'm not exactly sure what is Zach's role? I was gonna say chief curator there and just kind of found curation and partnerships at Arzora and also founder of the Museum of Queer, interestingly. So shout out to Zach, who's actually going to be on the Twitter spaces.
00:22:41.374 - 00:23:07.722, Speaker A: It might even be next week. I'll have to go check that out. So it'll be great because last time I kind of got rugged when I was in Heathrow there, the space that we had with Zach, so really happy that he's coming back on and we can do that again proper. So, Zach, I really like working at Zora because artists are earning money there. Supporting artists has been my life's work, starting with grants. I convinced my first job to create in 2011. Without art, the world stagnates.
00:23:07.722 - 00:23:36.350, Speaker A: Without funding, artists can't make art. Creators made $1 million on Zora this month. That is impressive. And a lot of these creators are in countries like Argentina, you know, from around the world. A true service, changing lives. So Zach works there. Zach's work matters, especially in the arts, because, of course, if you're making money from art, some of these people are making more reliable money because a lot of them maybe are freelancers.
00:23:36.350 - 00:24:13.650, Speaker A: And then anybody that's freelance knows half the battle is getting paid, right, and so, or paid on time. And so, you know, blockchain and, you know, selling your work on Zora, you get 100 mints. All of a sudden, that's worth two or $300 to you. So all to say, great work from Zach and Zora. If you've never made an edition on Zora and it costs you nothing and want to get started, reach out. So, DM Zack, if you're curious, if you're new to this show and you're trying to figure out how to do all this, DM Zach, he'll set you up. It's the easiest place to get started because you can create without crypto.
00:24:13.650 - 00:24:27.098, Speaker A: We'll cover your first rewards. Withdrawal contracts are sovereign. Metadata is updatable. File limits are huge. True plays well with farcaster frames in app rating and painting tools. Remixable. I didn't know it played with Farcaster frames.
00:24:27.098 - 00:24:48.606, Speaker A: That's awesome. Remixable. NFT splits, collaborative contracts, batch upload, easy interface. All to say, if you want to get started, Zach's right, it's a awesome place to get started. And Tezos is cheap. This is actually what I was talking about here. So Allan survey posted this video here and at the 50 minutes mark.
00:24:48.606 - 00:25:57.154, Speaker A: Interesting to hear confirmation from Josecu Carreras, director of Hauser Wirth, a very prominent contemporary art organization or gallery with many locations, that the new model of co representation had the aim of supporting smaller galleries in the larger art ecosystem. So again, like, imagine you're a smaller gallery right now selling physical art. What a lot of artists who have work in physical galleries and on the blockchain will say is like, they make more money. Generally speaking, on the blockchain, it's not easy to sell physical art because blockchain's more liquid, right? Because let's say I buy it, I don't need to. Because if I buy a physical work of art, where am I going to sell that? You know, do I bring it back to the gallery? Who do I even talk to? And then who wants a cut of that? Whereas on the blockchain, I get it, I pay my royalty and end of story, you know? So all to say, interesting. They're trying new models here, Hauser, and worth working with smaller galleries. They split the costs and the proceeds 50 50.
00:25:57.154 - 00:26:41.054, Speaker A: And I think this is a sign of a tightening, financially tightening contemporary art world that is. Otherwise, why are they doing this? Because I think Hauser and Wirth realizes that they need the smaller galleries in order to kind of develop artists where. Because they probably take from smaller galleries, right. So they're realizing, if these small galleries go down, then where does that leave Hauser and Wirth? A forward looking idea. RJ Bull market thoughts? Easy to think as bull is back. Gets constantly thrown around that all art should sell instantly. I think art NFTs work differently in that actually artists constantly experience their own cycles irrespective of what the coins are doing.
00:26:41.054 - 00:26:59.892, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I basically mostly agree. I would say there's just different. Put it this way, if everybody's. Well, it's hard to say. I was gonna say if everybody's broke. That's when a lot of people were selling their most artists in a weird way. Like, we experienced the bear market on this program, a lot of it.
00:26:59.892 - 00:27:38.320, Speaker A: And that bear market could return pretty quickly. But to a weird degree. It's almost like the bear market was when the bear market was. There's nothing to do because nobody was speculating. Now, people, they want liquidity because there seems to be an opportunity around every corner here. And as the opportunities come, you don't want to be stuck in some illiquid art. Now, in a sense, in a weird way, with a market that's going vertical, the last place you want to be from a financial investment point of view, is in art, because it's just not as liquid.
00:27:38.320 - 00:28:21.556, Speaker A: Right? So that's why we're seeing pfps do fine, you know, hot PFP projects, because they're liquid. You can kind of sell them profile picture projects for those that are wondering. So interesting. But I agree, though, with the tenor of this comment, though, which is artists have their own cycles and that those are largely independent of what's going on outside. A notable sale here, lovers by Dan Control, sold to Vincent van do for 420 tezos. So it's probably a one of one here. So nice sale for Dancontrol, who is on a roll, doing very well, seeming to kind of achieve another level there in kind of collecting of people collecting Dan's work.
00:28:21.556 - 00:29:03.672, Speaker A: So just being consistent and being smart in the art, conceptual, prolific, consistent, all that stuff just kind of adds up where the collectors just all of a sudden you hit a threshold and Dan seems to be kind of crossing a threshold here. So congrats to Dan. August ground, who I want to invite. I haven't done this yet, but I say this out loud to myself to remind me to invite August ground for a Twitter space. I think it would be awesome soon enough. Bling bling bling blang. All those grails and five tezos pieces you bought because they were by undiscovered geniuses, will get wings and fly to the heavens and everyone will live happily ever after.
00:29:03.672 - 00:29:56.666, Speaker A: Yes, it is kind of one of the dreams of the collectors of, say, artwork on tazos, where you're buying these works for like three tazos. Like what if, right? It's kind of back to this. What if. What if bitcoin goes to half a million dollars or more, you know, again, we may run out of steam today, but if this thing actually goes exponential, what are the implications for, say, blockchain, art on the blockchain, you know, or art on tazos, you know, what happens to the tezos price? So just kind of interesting time right now. Again, if you're new and you don't understand what I'm saying, don't worry. It's a really interesting time to start poking your head in. Maybe that's why there's new viewers as well, is because of this rise in crypto, this extremely fast rise.
00:29:56.666 - 00:30:43.650, Speaker A: And when I have another comment by August, and when have I honestly ever sold for a profit, if at all? Mostly, it's always been spending what little I have to support people who make things I think are beautiful or profound or frightening. It's a vote of confidence for the things that speak, sing, whisper in a new voice. So our patron saint here, collector of the on the blockchain here, August ground, with some beautiful thoughts. Speaking of sales. Now, Pixel Lord has just put out this series here. I think I mentioned it last show, GM Desales, his bitcoin project here on ordinals a collection, is doing very well. So again, big congrats to Pixel Lord.
00:30:43.650 - 00:31:06.576, Speaker A: This is a head turning kind of situation over here. These are not small amounts of money. Zero if bitcoin is $60,000.00.00, you know, four if you round it up here. Bitcoin, I mean, that's real money. So again, big congrats. And I think inspiration, remember, I don't know if I put the tweet in an earlier episode.
00:31:06.576 - 00:31:36.472, Speaker A: I remember this tweet, though, by Pixelord spending $5,000 to mint this series. Well, I think it paid off, didn't it? So, just fascinating. And again, the courage of your convictions there, Pixel Lord. It's great to see vending NFT. So the Tes vending machine got a. Another star here. Marcelo Pinellas vending machine project is extremely pleased to announce our next machine takeover will feature the artwork of the fantastical cyber mystic, also known as Marcelo Pinel.
00:31:36.472 - 00:32:08.308, Speaker A: So we've, of course, you know, just an awesome, you know, the person I consider to be the, you know, digital inheritor to Alex Gray, as far as I'm concerned, you know, in the visionary art department, great artist here. On March 13 at noon, he's going to bring his own dayglo wizardry to the Venn. This will be epic indeed. So you have, you know, almost two weeks to figure out what you're going to do here. How are you going to play this one? So, pretty awesome. Elly Lowe. This is interesting.
00:32:08.308 - 00:32:48.504, Speaker A: Some tape noise here. So just a little bit of a window. Look at how ancient these video cameras are. So just a window into what Elie Lowe is doing. Who made this music, by the way? We asked, like, put this on tv. Put this on tv. That's the tv I want to watch.
00:32:48.504 - 00:33:19.292, Speaker A: Maybe that's why I'm doing this show. Really cool video there. Again, just put this on tv is all I have to say. Whoever's got to make the decision there, just totally awesome machine. An interesting post here from machine on using the airbrush. The most fascinating thing about airbrush is that unlike digital art or oil painting, I can't foresee the end results. I can't make it perfect and I don't know what I'm doing until it's finished.
00:33:19.292 - 00:34:01.378, Speaker A: There is no undo button and a mistake cannot be corrected. This is very interesting and it's kind of. This is what she finds fascinating. And I find this fascinating as well. It's sometimes, put it this way, sometimes I like to work with layers and work almost blindly where you can't tell what you're doing. So it's a way of incorporating in her experience with airbrush randomness into the work. And that creates a sense of interest, I would argue, in the work rather than some super, extremely intentional direct painting, so to speak.
00:34:01.378 - 00:34:33.810, Speaker A: Anyway, interesting comment here from machine, and actually we got a couple of great machine works at the end of the show, so stick around for that. Anyway, just, just an interesting. And what does it say here? Can you just paint over? Technically, yes, but it costs more time than making a new painting from scratch. So basically just something generally to be avoided. Very interesting comment there. Donia, proud to present unedited photo of a cactus from fake whales art market. Before I was a glitch artist, I was a pro photographer, actually kind of similar to, I think to Sabato.
00:34:33.810 - 00:34:57.484, Speaker A: There I was in a series of car wrecks which made running around at events with a big DSLR unfeasible. Discovering how to make these circuit bent cameras has really reawakened the photog in me. They weighed about 5oz and are pocket friendly, so it doesn't wear on my back. The sense of discovery is a feeling common to both glitch art and photography. And with here cameras, they've merged seamlessly. So just more. Look at this.
00:34:57.484 - 00:35:25.006, Speaker A: So with Donnie has self made cameras here. Just incredible. I love how it can actually how it works. So just really cool. Never get tired of those, of these glitch cameras here by Donia. Another one new cam listed the grunge caster. So here is a cool purple one, as you can see.
00:35:25.006 - 00:35:53.690, Speaker A: And again, just a really. You could almost see these going into mass production. Here is John Cates. Hey, y'all. In the category of sharing artists works, here's a thread of digital artists who have just dropped their alpha Genesis works for my glitch art gallery and exhibition here in Taipei, Taiwan. So John Cates, I believe is in Taipei. And so here is a part of the show.
00:35:53.690 - 00:36:12.124, Speaker A: So putting on a show there, just, you know, again, just another sign of the international nature of this art scene here. Here's Spiegel's. Meanwhile, in Seoul. Seoul, Korea. And look at how good this looks. This is a pretty rad room. And you gotta love the black.
00:36:12.124 - 00:36:37.338, Speaker A: I don't know how they're projecting light on the black. Maybe the black is. Maybe it's just a really good projector. And so the black is being projected, I guess. But all to say, wow, Spiegel's maskinen on a roll without question here. And look at the ball. Just a really, you know, just fun and cool and contemporary.
00:36:37.338 - 00:37:19.242, Speaker A: So just gotta love it. So congrats, Spiegels. And also unknown collector doing the exhibitions in on foundation, beyond the hype, into the unknown. So here now, it was kind of interesting, like you couldn't click on here we have some video. So it's like an essay on these works here now I think, I'm not sure. I'm not sure if this is actually a show that you can buy works from. So all to say, though, I assume there is or it's just an essay.
00:37:19.242 - 00:37:44.244, Speaker A: So maybe this is just like, maybe you're not supposed to be able to buy the works. It's just a way of kind of showing work and a place to show work. So maybe different from the worlds that are curated. Right? So kind of a gallery esque experience here. This is cool with the phone there. Uri J work. So extensive work here from unknown collector, as you see here.
00:37:44.244 - 00:38:12.794, Speaker A: Extensive essay, which is an exhibition of sorts. There's Siba Sistero. So very cool. So just wanted to highlight that. So just a few as we almost get to. Well, we are at the work here, but just wanted to touch on a few more of these works using Microsoft Paint 98 or object, their new in house play on Microsoft Paint 98. So here's Tornado Rodriguez making some very beautiful art here.
00:38:12.794 - 00:38:40.038, Speaker A: Again, limited tools can do. It's a nice composition. Hey. And it's just a, you know, and you know what else is interesting? Like, again, I'm always like, well, how easy of a screen print would this be? You know, all you'd have to have is colored paper. It's one pass. And there you have just like a really cool screen print with all of this kind of, again, hard pixelation here. Dream vacation.
00:38:40.038 - 00:38:57.310, Speaker A: So these are selling for two tezos, each sold out edition of eight. Here's another one I got a clean up self portrait. Hilarious. And again, just a really nice composition and everything. And so screen printable. These are went for one tezos each. Now 40 tezos on secondary Katarina create.
00:38:57.310 - 00:39:21.444, Speaker A: Also using object paint 98. Again, a retro tool. And actually a pretty cool work here with some tiers. So you see the style of both of these artists. But then, you know, getting the Microsoft paint 98 treatment here on object. And here's one by rustic digital art. So different kind of canvas size here, much larger canvas.
00:39:21.444 - 00:39:36.414, Speaker A: And here you see what look like some flies and a horse and everything. So very cool experimentation. Horse drinks water near the sea. That's rustic. They're selling well, too, which is interesting. The market likes them. So a quick 20 tezos.
00:39:36.414 - 00:39:52.994, Speaker A: And here is human boy, three legged friend. So a abstract work here, as we see the dithering here. Human boy 98. And so, yeah, just different shapes and dithering. And that is ten tezos. And that is an edition of three. Onto the.
00:39:52.994 - 00:40:43.186, Speaker A: Onto beyond. You might be mistaken. You might think that this is still Microsoft paint, but this is probably some other retro tool. So this is cedar plank hastrubal waffle. So I kind of love it. Like, it almost turns into a burger at the end or something. So let me like, just, again, just making it look so effortless, you know, like cedar plank, aka hasdrubal waffle, has developed this doodling style.
00:40:43.186 - 00:41:16.346, Speaker A: So once you kind of get good at the doodling style, we should all develop our own doodling styles, frankly, because once you get good at the doodling, this just looks like the super fun, cool work that I'm basically opening the show with to a certain degree, or at least the second part of the show with. It looks like it was maybe made in 20 minutes, you know, probably longer, maybe a couple hours. But, you know, it's. And I could be totally wrong, but it doesn't seem like waffles is spending, you know, days and days on this. But it works. And that's what's exciting about getting good at the doodle style. Here's some other works.
00:41:16.346 - 00:41:39.196, Speaker A: These could all have been made in the same day, for all we know. Achoo. Kind of a green, a lime green there. And we see the sneezing and the eyeballs. Because, of course, if you sneeze with your eyes open or eyelids open, the theory is that your eyeballs fall out. So seeming to play off of that. And just one more cannibal papaya here.
00:41:39.196 - 00:42:18.584, Speaker A: So I don't know what software cedar plank is using. And there's a cedar plank cannibal papaya. So these are kind of eating each other, but just a lot of fun here is being had. Raykeys. So we saw the first four floral works in this, you know, I want to say, surprisingly original take on pixel art here. And look at how nice and large this is. I like this a lot when pixel art, where you can zoom in and see, because sometimes you could have this at like, I mean, how big is this? Maybe it says it doesn't, but let's say this is like 200 by 200 pixels here, and then probably upsized from there.
00:42:18.584 - 00:43:01.718, Speaker A: If you just have a tiny one, you kind of can't see all the detail up close. So it is nice when you get this magnification, because you see all the delight here. And again, I'm always back to, you know, how big is this file? How much would this cost to mint on bitcoin? You know, back to the ordinal debate that. So floral number five, this transferred so maybe to previous collectors, not sure. And another work posted on. On X is kind of has a japanese woodcut feeling, I think. And again, you see this really kind of just interesting take on pixelation here on pixel art, really somehow developing.
00:43:01.718 - 00:43:19.174, Speaker A: Ray K is developing their own style here. It all looks familiar, but it's different, isn't it? And to great effect here. So just really interesting work from Ray case. This is an interesting work, too. This is color Charlie. And this is on Zora. Last couple of days to mint this, actually.
00:43:19.174 - 00:43:44.804, Speaker A: So mint it while you can. And let's see if we can zoom in here. So, as you see, kind of. You see the pixelation here and interesting kind of distortions, almost like transformed a tiny bit here. And just a fun flower here with this kind of stylized stem here as well as. Is that a pot? Is that maybe a spilled flower pot? Cool work from color Charlie. And who is this? Ryland closed and the grass began to whisper.
00:43:44.804 - 00:44:16.474, Speaker A: Excuse me, in the collection of. So this is maybe an older work, kind of. You almost see that whole style of putting, almost patterning into different outlines here, getting different textures. Just an interesting landscape there from an artist I don't think I have seen before or recently at least. And the name of the artist, quickly, is Ryland. Close at the fallen Saul. Continuing on, we have a few works by RJ.
00:44:16.474 - 00:44:43.952, Speaker A: This is an edition of one for 100 tezos. Kind of beautifully pixelated works here. Kind of have a bit of a hockney feel to them. And just maybe AI pastiche, not sure. In this series, the Internet also is a terrifying place, which kind of sounds like AI as well, doesn't it? So RJ, this is 100 tezos edition of one. Interesting colors. We have a similar color scheme here in room number four, 5000 by 2500.
00:44:43.952 - 00:45:05.568, Speaker A: So we should be able to zoom in. And it's nice, right? When you can zoom in like this, you can really appreciate all of the artistry here of this pixel artist here. So interesting. And you know, it's interesting too. Just how these. It's not as easy as it looks in a sense. Like look at that eye and then you get the shadow under the eye.
00:45:05.568 - 00:45:33.412, Speaker A: Kind of counterintuitive stuff, even the nose, but it works interestingly. An interesting architecture in the background for good measure in these colors too. So cool there, room number two. And almost like these different generations here hanging out together. Just very interesting to see these up big like this and the pants and everything. Just a simple horizon line there. Room number two.
00:45:33.412 - 00:45:51.154, Speaker A: And here's room number one. This is. And how much is this one? This sold for 100 tezos to Marching square. Nice one. And here again you see this beautiful kind of jagged pixel art here. And again, this massive eye here. Just unapologetically pixelated.
00:45:51.154 - 00:46:12.070, Speaker A: So just very cool work. Of course, RJ works on, I believe, in browser pixel art program. Some more interesting pixel art here. Totally experimental element, liquid, three stage perspective. So interesting. This is the colored version, as you see here. Beautiful with the clouds here.
00:46:12.070 - 00:46:48.486, Speaker A: Maybe we can make this slightly bigger. Here we go, nice and big. So as you see here, just beautiful. I guess we'd call that, I call it four to the floor dithering here. This kind of checkerboard dithering here's some kind of looser dithering here. So really just kind of interesting piece here. Kind of what I call computer graphics perspective, kind of that video game perspective where you're kind of simultaneously almost bird's eye here, but if you take a step, but simultaneously, you're kind of looking on a landscape like you normally would.
00:46:48.486 - 00:47:29.524, Speaker A: Or like maybe this is like 45 degree angles on the city here, but when you look off into the distance, it's more of just kind of looking straight. Isn't that a computer graphic space worth noting here because we see it often. And even the composition, a wanderer type, Delvanderer type situation here, looking off over the cliff, but also kind of a video game esque perspective. But we do have also perspective here because of course this figure is closer to us, it's larger. And then you'd imagine that figure would be a lot smaller if he went down that trail or she went down that trail. And just beautiful, this coloring here. Now we have.
00:47:29.524 - 00:47:45.736, Speaker A: Let's just go here. We have some other versions here. So you kind of get a window. So probably starting here, interestingly. And then you see how experimental this pixel artist is. The great element. Lee, very prolific.
00:47:45.736 - 00:48:18.090, Speaker A: Again, I think, making it all on the phone, and you got to love that. So very cool work there. Here is popple. We're actually kind of making pretty good progress here, Popple, with this beautiful work here. I'm not sure if we looked at an earlier version of it. This one seems particularly powerful, though, with this figure here. And you can even get a window into the different kind of renderings that are all kind of working together here, you know? And, you know, auxine does this, too, where it'll just be different renderings.
00:48:18.090 - 00:49:02.434, Speaker A: And, you know, if you took this static, perhaps it wouldn't have the same excitement, but you just take some different renderings here, and then, you know, maybe adding light or whatever it is, saturation, contrast, whatever it is that popple's doing, and then you start to turn that into an animation, and you have this static image, but that is kind of shimmering with life, just, you know. So learn from the masters here, like Euxine and Popple. Here's another one by popple. And this, I think popple works with generative art. And this kind of looks a little bit generative esque. So an interesting kind of blob cat. Blobby cat figure in a forest here at night, perhaps.
00:49:02.434 - 00:49:18.104, Speaker A: Mysterious work here. And again, you start to see some generative art, I think, in these bubbles. So popple has long combined generative and pixel art. This could be an older work. Look at that. 21,000 views there. Of course, popple has a huge following.
00:49:18.104 - 00:49:55.130, Speaker A: 12,000 views after getting that 4 million views maybe a year ago now, at, like, something like 65,000 followers, I think, you know, so pretty impressive. And, of course, I follow Popple. That is an x glitch. How could you not follow Popple? Jean Provencher, you know, again, continues to be interesting, this artist here. Now, I don't know if Jean Provencher. I don't know if they mint or if John Mints nfts, because I'm not sure I've ever seen that. But Jeff, definitely a pixel artist and definitely works outside in physical mediums, as we've seen before.
00:49:55.130 - 00:50:13.274, Speaker A: Very interesting artist here. Consistently like, interesting. Getting a nice kind of reaction here, too. So very cool there, Argyle. So this is. Okay. So this looks like that very well known artist whose name is escaping me right now.
00:50:13.274 - 00:50:34.822, Speaker A: Nifty monkey. Nifty. This looks like a nifty. So I thought this was a nifty monkey post, but maybe this is an older piece. But I know Nifty Monkey has been releasing artwork here recently. Anyway, another interesting pixel artist here, continuing on here is Slava three with a cool open edition. I don't think we looked at this one.
00:50:34.822 - 00:50:58.652, Speaker A: Yeah, this is February 29. This is brand new. And this is the maximum we can go in here. But interest, you know, Slava three has been experimenting with different kinds of renderings. And here we see some dithering here you see, you know, kind of larger pixels and then combining everything. And here, again, you kind of have these classic kind of retro elements. The big screen monitor, the big keyboard, and, you know, skull.
00:50:58.652 - 00:51:21.212, Speaker A: It's starting to feel like crypto art, isn't it? Especially with the. With the skull conscious chaos. And this is again, open edition for 550. And about five have been minted so far. Kappen, also known as figments with a cool piece. And here. Gotta love this one, don't you? So kind of a very cool piece here.
00:51:21.212 - 00:51:59.600, Speaker A: Just red, black, and the white on the figure here, looking off into this landscape. Is it a sun, is it a moon? And these look like stars here, these flattened stars, these horizontal ratioed pixels, these, you know, nice kind of horizontal pixelation here. So. And then a nice contrast here between the static pixels here on the whole right side and on the left side is all animated. It's almost like two works put together. Very cool, wide angle, interesting canvas size here. This is an edition of 30 now on, only 366 on primary.
00:51:59.600 - 00:52:23.932, Speaker A: Now it's 1111. So, Ed Marolla with some cool work here as part of the. What is the name of this series? They are dreaming us. So more work from this series here. And so interesting animation. You see different renderings of the pixelation here or of the dithering. And here, almost like a Renaissance painting, a saint of sorts.
00:52:23.932 - 00:52:52.784, Speaker A: Almost looks like the Virgin Mary coming from above. And here, interesting transforms, interesting everything. And is that Ed Marolla in the river here in this massive dragonfly wing? Perhaps so, again, influence. The main subject for Ed is dreams. And put out something on Twitter. Really cool. I think it's in the community, actually using that AI music generator.
00:52:52.784 - 00:53:08.764, Speaker A: Satoshi Nakamoto by Xin. So an edition of eleven. And this sold for 69 tezos. So, you know, a quick thousand bucks. Tezos is at about $1.30, I think around or maybe a dollar 25. And here, this is what I want to show you.
00:53:08.764 - 00:53:43.030, Speaker A: Actually, if we could freeze this, I should have brought up the x version. All you would see is different renderings of the image, different dithering, so to speak, or different kinds. There's the paint version and there's the exported out. You do ten different exports, five different exports, maybe change the colors, and before you know it, your static image has come to life. Right, so kind of a similar technique, one could argue that we see in popple. So again, in this cool kind of card format. Just love it, love it, love it.
00:53:43.030 - 00:54:04.952, Speaker A: 690 tezos on secondary dream device. So muji is back on the show here. And these nice contrast here between the super large and the super. And the smaller pixels here to good effect. And maybe this is my favorite part up here. These kind of dancing lights here on the interface. Just another cool, beautifully colored work.
00:54:04.952 - 00:54:28.966, Speaker A: Dream device. Awesome title concept edition of 20 for five tezos on object. And here is on Zora Mandel with a new. I think there's gonna be a cat a day. And here we go. This might be a collab on one of these little, I think, self robotic vacuums. I think so.
00:54:28.966 - 00:54:40.956, Speaker A: Mannadil's awesome. As you can see. Great, great pixel artist. Where are we? 19 minted. Just minted here. Today is a classic cleaning day. So this is.
00:54:40.956 - 00:54:57.236, Speaker A: Yeah, cat once a week series. So pretty cool work. This is brave. Haven't seen from brave for a while. Lazy day, time passing. And we are just chilling edition of 13 and two sold here at 1141. And here it is.
00:54:57.236 - 00:55:11.660, Speaker A: Kind of a nice monochromatic work here with this house and maybe a car and maybe a crow. So interesting to see. Great to see. Braveback. Cool title there. Lazy day again. Eleven tezos on object.
00:55:11.660 - 00:55:49.626, Speaker A: And here is Chaz with another video game, arrow a row. And this is an open edition for a tezos 50 as you see here. And you can kind of zoom in. And behind the back end of the arcade game seems to be reflecting the inside of the game itself. So just another cool work there from Chaz as we continue our shopping network here of the soul, our shopping network of the imagination here. This is meta norm in a work called touch. And here playing again with a cursor.
00:55:49.626 - 00:56:11.134, Speaker A: And this is on Zora. So just kind of a cool pixel artwork. And you see maybe clicking there when you see touch 179 of six. So nice take there for that artist on Zora. Here's fornix void. Makes you think of Haiti. Rockette.
00:56:11.134 - 00:56:45.158, Speaker A: Radical rider edition of ten for nine tezos. Get it while you can. So just Fornax void, a really interesting artist here. And so radical rider. And of course, making the music. Fornax void makes the music there. This was posted in the community, and I thought it was pretty cool.
00:56:45.158 - 00:57:05.944, Speaker A: I'd never seen it before. Emily. And those nice big chunky pixels at the end there. Beautiful color. Interesting concept. Cool work. So that's on object at first pixel.
00:57:05.944 - 00:57:20.406, Speaker A: And that is 888. And addition of eight. And how many are left here? And that's now on secondary. So, sold out. So nice work there. Thank you for posting that. Very cool Francois Gamma twist on plane.
00:57:20.406 - 00:57:44.404, Speaker A: So here. And of course, we looked at Francois Gamma's work, opening the show there, last show. So here is kind of more classic francoise gamma playing with the figures. This one's not so much walking, but just very cool. And playing with these kind of softwares, seeing what the softwares do with simple ideas here. Twist on plane, simple concepts. Three tezos edition of 40.
00:57:44.404 - 00:58:02.024, Speaker A: Sebas Estero edition of one. I think this sold 80 tezos to unknown collector. So nice sale there. And you gotta love all this pixelation in here. Kind of dancing around the pixels. Dancing a little bit. And the fuzzed out pixels in the background.
00:58:02.024 - 00:58:25.724, Speaker A: And of course, I mean, often playing with memory. And, you know, these kind of portraits of inner space are experience of our internal experience here. And cool little square here, where it's almost like what the person is seeing, but then all of the memories we bring. Very kind of metaphysical work here. Memory number 13. Very cool series. Seba sistero.
00:58:25.724 - 00:58:50.024, Speaker A: As we continue here, Jake. Jake Studios. How are we doing? An hour. The end is sphere, and we saw an earlier version of this on x, but now we see here, interesting kind of rendering here. And we see an upside down McDonald's bag. This kind of looks like the Jake figure, but not sure the Jake character. And look at that.
00:58:50.024 - 00:59:11.024, Speaker A: Look at how cool that is. That see through briefcase with a jpeg in it. Interesting treatment. Kind of experimenting. And a couple of drones with eyeballs dripping, maybe crying upside down clouds. Kind of experimenting with what looks like a bit of a spray paint in the background. Airbrush, so to speak, but pixelated.
00:59:11.024 - 00:59:27.584, Speaker A: Cool work. Very cool work. And that is an edition of one. And that is at 111 tazos. So I think fake whale, I'm not sure fake whale has. Or maybe that's what you have to start at. Not sure.
00:59:27.584 - 00:59:52.050, Speaker A: Cool work from Jake Studios. And here is Lewis Osborne, carried away. Let's take a look. Always interesting illustrator out of bristle in the UK there. So interesting. Always playing with the happy and sad faces, balloons. And here they mostly look sad, as if they're floating away and they can't get back to earth.
00:59:52.050 - 01:00:21.310, Speaker A: And just infinitely carried away here. So this is. This went for 30 tezos, each edition of ten from Lewis Osborne. And here is Caterina. Create with an interesting piece, blooming creation. And here, playing with the color and make animating with color here, this illustration here. And there's a snail, kind of a surreal illustrator of sorts here with the flower, the plants and, you know, in the middle of the heads here.
01:00:21.310 - 01:00:34.108, Speaker A: And joined by the butterfly wings. Just a cool work. Blooming creation. Number three. And this was cool, too. Nico Lasalle saw this on x. And I don't know if there's.
01:00:34.108 - 01:01:07.554, Speaker A: I doubt there's volume on this, but a cool illustration of skeletor here. So hilarious. I remember this from the he man action series or action figures and cartoon masters of the universe, skeletor. So that is edition of six, only 0.3 Sol, which is probably $40 now. Sol just kind of had a big launch there, too, la Delmos. So this is a preview of a work that's going to go on Zora today.
01:01:07.554 - 01:01:32.260, Speaker A: But I thought I'd show the preview here. Let's see if it loads up. It's a little bit fuzzy. So I thought a cool adult. So kind of reminding. Reminding you of Rata, those ads that Ratta did. I mean, those captured my, like.
01:01:32.260 - 01:01:49.374, Speaker A: I mean, that's how I started collecting on Tezos, was seeing Ratta's ad of the Kazumoto Medici figure, you know, doing the hunt there in pixel art. And I was like, I. I have to buy this. I have to own this. I could not afford that one, of course. Cola's garden. This is by Morlakos and a.
01:01:49.374 - 01:02:27.978, Speaker A: I think you'd call these a cholita figure here, if I remember right, a beautiful work here. A poetic work by Morlacos. Kind of, again, a real latin american feeling to it. And walking up the stairs there and there's a figure, just a really classic, you know, kind of, again, feels like a latin american painting. And you have to love the circles here and even the stripes. Do you see the light circles here? So pretty cool. Murlaco is, again, always impressive here and here in the dress.
01:02:27.978 - 01:02:48.026, Speaker A: Just a really interesting artist, I believe, out of Argentina. And look at the hair, this big brush. You almost wonder if this was using Windows or Microsoft paint, but I don't think so. Yeah, beautiful, beautiful work. Rustic digital art. Chapad MAlal so this is an edition of ten. This is seven tazos.
01:02:48.026 - 01:03:13.264, Speaker A: So going back to these kind of landscape paintings here. And, of course, a ton of experimentation here. This is all on purpose. If you're new here, this is all on purpose. So just very cool, intentional work here. Just another super original landscape from rustic Chapad Malel. Again, seven tezos and one listed, one left.
01:03:13.264 - 01:03:25.604, Speaker A: So very cool there. Recollapse. This is pretty fun. Tennis tournament celebration. This is kind of how I felt. I was almost tempted to start with this. This is Friday for me, tennis tournament.
01:03:25.604 - 01:03:42.874, Speaker A: This is a celebration of sorts here. And again, just kind of almost has a physical feeling to the textures here. But I think it's all digital. So interesting piece here. Tennis tournament. Always love sports as well. And this is sold out.
01:03:42.874 - 01:04:18.644, Speaker A: Interesting piece on x here is we continue to run here jazz club by Bear XV. And just a cool work, I think. Almost looks like AI, but I'm not sure, but I assume a digital artwork. And here, kind of a jazz feeling to the whole thing. Cool work. And here is Lanqueziteur, who, of course, I follow Burnsiewicz new physical nature morte au saintrier. And here, just a kind of a surreal nature malt or still life here.
01:04:18.644 - 01:04:38.024, Speaker A: And the flower coming out in interesting shadow. Interesting piece. I mean, in the crazy mouth there with the backward cigarette here is Jan Luques Magone. Loading. Mutation digital fantasy collection. So playing, it seems, with the apple vision pro idea. So all sorts of new things.
01:04:38.024 - 01:05:22.362, Speaker A: And of course, we saw, I think we saw what I missed the last on the last piece was there's a crypto, a reference of someone who is looking. Yeah. And here's another one, kind of a crypto art feeling to this one with the Ethereum symbol here. And just an interesting painting, plain, you know, again, there's definitely a technology theme with these works here. And I believe a painting probably made on procreate with different kinds of brushes here, I believe a digital painting, beautifully done and interesting color here, as you see this figure with the apple vision pro on, I assume, or some sort of VR with. It's almost like they're entering the metaverse here is almost what it feels like. Let's look at the title again.
01:05:22.362 - 01:05:55.854, Speaker A: Loading. Mutation digital fantasy collection. This is 20 tezos, 19 tezos on secondary and selling out for twelve tezos on primary 30 editions. Nice take. Here is Iris Deleuze, someone I discovered on Twitter or maybe was posted in the community, perhaps just a really cool, interesting, different kind of artist here, as you can see, kind of has a collage feeling to it. Just very interesting and beautiful. Kind of looks like digital collage.
01:05:55.854 - 01:06:08.842, Speaker A: Nft. Surreal. So 100 tezos on secondary, selling out for only one tezos on primary. Cool piece. Here's Dan control. Smoke. Smoke till you die, as he says here.
01:06:08.842 - 01:06:35.734, Speaker A: And kind of looking like a combination, again, of older works. We have the, what looks like, almost like the vape cigarette here, but hard to tell. Maybe that's a regular cigarette. And then I think we've seen the smoke before. And here's the fire. Hilariously done with gradients. So another interesting, minimal, minimal work here with the white background here.
01:06:35.734 - 01:06:56.692, Speaker A: So just an interesting piece. And again, the composition going right to the edge here, you know, again or almost right to the edge again. Everything intentional here. Smoke. And again, that's 15 tezos edition of 20. And here's NUV 1914 dragon. I don't think we looked at this one.
01:06:56.692 - 01:07:18.420, Speaker A: So this is an edition of three for eight tezos. And so now increasing the edition size, we saw a ton of addition of one s in the last couple of months. And now going to higher editions, so get the one of ones while you can. Here is Gozo. Uncertain gaze. Just a little post here. And just beautiful textures.
01:07:18.420 - 01:07:45.404, Speaker A: Again, incorporating movement back into the works here. Very interesting and cool work from Gozo here is Lorna Mills. Interesting, you know, ancient theme here. The biting the apple here with a deep red, but also just working on a food level here. Working on multiple levels here. Again with that deep red. Just cool work from Larna Mills on Instagram there.
01:07:45.404 - 01:08:15.854, Speaker A: I'm not sure if that's been minted yet. Kurt Hussle collective. Street violence. Kill them all. So let's see what's going on here. We're at that gang fight location, Willie. Guys, you'll never make it to undercover.
01:08:15.854 - 01:08:36.990, Speaker A: So totally wild. Totally wild work. I mean, beautifully done here. Beautiful soundtrack. American hustle games indeed. So, Kurt hustle collective, three tazos. Totally original duo there.
01:08:36.990 - 01:08:56.442, Speaker A: JNK and Terry, visual edition of 25, three tazos. As we continue our shopping network here, let us continue here. Zora, this is cypher by Katasavi. Cool piece. I think it's doing pretty well, too. Just a different kind of abstract that is on Zora. Here's another one by Braun.
01:08:56.442 - 01:09:16.226, Speaker A: I think a newer series, pulse zero one. So continuing with this kind of a larger pixels here. New title for this series, so maybe slightly different. These ones are this one's square pulse number one. And this is an edition of one selling for 15 tezos. Very cool. Good deal.
01:09:16.226 - 01:09:33.235, Speaker A: Congrats to all there. This is a new work by Santiago on Zora. So pretty cool here. Just an abstract classic kind of santiago. Abstract and attractive work. Here's a really cool piece by Santiago. Coexistence, which is also on Zora.
01:09:33.235 - 01:09:50.014, Speaker A: Last drop in the collection of the residence neutral arts and bosque grazias. Very grateful for all. A really nice piece here. I like the horizontal composition. Just kind of keeping it new. Very cool and just interesting shapes. And twelve minted so far.
01:09:50.014 - 01:10:04.906, Speaker A: Cool title. And here's a very cool piece from Rannixteer. That very cool blue. That cool blue of the future here. So that is on foundation. And again, kind of really minimal works. 0.03
01:10:04.906 - 01:10:23.238, Speaker A: e. So that would be maybe. How much is that? Maybe 90, but $100. So cool minimal series here from Rannix deer. Endless is a series. And this is kind of endless here too. Top floor by Roccano.
01:10:23.238 - 01:10:46.250, Speaker A: With this kind of endless elevator ride, so to speak. This loop. So cool variation here on this series from Roccano. Intranet edition of five for five tezos. And here's another one by Roccano. Chocolate surprise. Taking the basket of eggs, so to speak, and then turning them into kindle.
01:10:46.250 - 01:10:57.214, Speaker A: Kinder surprises, which is pretty cool. Chocolate surprise. That's five tazos on object. Go, go. Lightus inclination. I don't think we've seen this. This was just minted yesterday.
01:10:57.214 - 01:11:13.686, Speaker A: So plain St. Morr with this kind of abstract animation. Again, kind of. Again, kind of would hang well with acid boy there. Kind of this psychedelic, you know, almost op art esque kind of style. So go. Go.
01:11:13.686 - 01:11:37.834, Speaker A: Light is continuing to grow as a creator and pixel artist. Inclination edition of 30. And offers are coming in for 18 tezos. Very cool. Here's another one just posted on x here. So playing with masking, it looks like here because you can almost see across this one, the color underneath. And then just putting these masks over top, right.
01:11:37.834 - 01:11:59.054, Speaker A: Very interesting there. 6000, 6000 views. 437 likes doing well. Here's pixel fool with some more interesting pixel art. Feel like maybe this might be an older one, but not sure. I've seen some of these kind of, you know, animated pixel art tropes before. It's almost like their pixel fool is combining a few of them together.
01:11:59.054 - 01:12:24.504, Speaker A: A nice piece there. And this is Niko, Nico Arbogast waiting in progress. So interesting animated abstract work there. Great color as we see it cycle through. Pretty interesting. Continuing on, Louise Andre Gamma flashing the infidelity of color series. So more, more fractals here.
01:12:24.504 - 01:12:48.064, Speaker A: Keep that one short for the flashing there. And here is somfake. Connection machine. So, as you can see, these could all kind of hang in the same room here. Just interesting experimentation in digital abstraction. And here is kodonakazono, continuum number 193. And we see some pixelation here, some dithering, and some pixelation on the top right as well.
01:12:48.064 - 01:13:08.402, Speaker A: And again, one of these kind of liquid, you know, animations on top here. An interesting background there. This is $26.90. So selling out on primary at 15 tezos each. Nice one. And here is Elly Pritz, virtual culture. Aure flora magnifica.
01:13:08.402 - 01:13:25.844, Speaker A: So it kind of has a latin plant textbook name, as we see this flower. Beautifully textured flower here. Blossom. And I believe Kiro posted this in the community. So this was just minted, a new one from Elly Pritz. So that's cool. February.
01:13:25.844 - 01:13:46.484, Speaker A: And here's inavare with, I believe, a new mint here as well. And this is called cloud bursting. And this is on exchange art. We'll let it load here again. Just another hugely rich texture here. As I get ready for my haircut here. Within 2 hours, I will be walking in the door.
01:13:46.484 - 01:14:02.448, Speaker A: So, very cool work there. And here's another one. Tug can. Again, these could all hang in the same room, couldn't they? All in, I guess I was going to say all made in the last 48 hours. This one's from January. So this one, I didn't see that this was minted earlier, but beautiful. I don't think we've seen this before.
01:14:02.448 - 01:14:21.578, Speaker A: So again, super rich textures here in all of these works. Here's Klaus. We're on composition. I think we actually hit 150. Here's composition 143. And just continuing here, this is 22 tezos, addition of one. And this is composition 151.
01:14:21.578 - 01:14:41.002, Speaker A: I think that's where we're at. And that sold for 25 tezos. So nice work from Klaus. It continues. And here is the fantastic interactive GLB. And this is Antea. So I guess you can move this around.
01:14:41.002 - 01:15:01.110, Speaker A: Antea. A famous trout here from Salawaki. So cool work there. Edition of 20. And again, that is on tea art. And here is Evelyn o. Very interesting piece here, I think, AI.
01:15:01.110 - 01:15:20.802, Speaker A: But some animation in there. I've never seen anything quite like this, to be honest. Great color in here, too, AI. Digital painting and animation edition of ten for 30 tazos each. Very cool. And check this out. So I believe this is Kuila Nina doing.
01:15:20.802 - 01:15:45.058, Speaker A: I saw that on X. I'm pretty sure this is Kuila Nina. It looks like her work doing. AI, how cool is this? This is an edition of one for three tezos you can get the first quilanina AI work. So I think I have two tezos in my wallet. Otherwise I would pick this up. I think I just picked up the cholita by Morlakos there.
01:15:45.058 - 01:16:17.494, Speaker A: So all to say, yeah, cool to see Kuila nina work in AI. Some beautiful work here by Ilay Tableau. Another beautiful AI artwork. Let me just zoom in. Okay. This is the full size here, but nice and painterly. And again, you're like, just interesting composition, kind of representative, figurative, where you can see the pots of flowers, but also kind of abstract, kind of flat in a nice way.
01:16:17.494 - 01:16:44.044, Speaker A: The piece in a kind of modernist way here, created with improps, which is probably how we're getting all of these incredible brushstrokes here. Very convincing improps. Here's tableau two also by Ilay, edition of ten for Fortezos. And here we see kind of a more representative, kind of more figurative work here. Clearly figurative and. But very cool. Again, kind of painterly here.
01:16:44.044 - 01:17:07.272, Speaker A: And some chairs and tables and fruits, almost like cezanne, like fruits there on the table. Still life, AI. So one going to little cakes, edition of ten. And here is lily illo, iron, and three reduced to iron, too. So very cool blueprint here. This looked great. And almost like one of those chairs, but done like a blueprint.
01:17:07.272 - 01:17:32.798, Speaker A: And there's even the AI writing a beautiful piece from Lily Illo, keeping it interesting. And here is a painting by Lily Illo. Almost looks like Mark Zuckerberg, not sure. But here it kind of looks like the architects in chairs series. Some great distortions here in the hand, AI distortions, different hands. Kind of mastering that distortion, mastering the errors of AI. Lily illo.
01:17:32.798 - 01:18:02.620, Speaker A: Very cool. And here's strange thing with almost raphaelesque AI artwork here, perfectly rendered here, and with beautiful textures on the side, the hyper real textures, as we were kind of mentioning in an earlier discussion. We actually have to return to that discussion. Maybe we can make this big really quickly. Exactly. And so here you see it all up close. And interesting solution here from strange thing.
01:18:02.620 - 01:18:16.704, Speaker A: Just leave the hoodie empty. Pretty good solution, actually. And here you can see it's AI. Pretty powerful. But when you zoom out, I mean, the texture on this painting, it's just. It's glorious. It looks like.
01:18:16.704 - 01:18:50.260, Speaker A: It looks like when you see those companies that do very close up versions of, like, the Mona Lisa, and they take, like, you know, a 50 gigapixel version of the Mona Lisa, that's what this reminds me of. Maybe a five gigapixel here is true face sold out the passengers. Curated by fake whales. So congrats to true face Pablo radicche selling out this work, the passengers. Cool AI artwork. Super cool AI artist makes their own algorithms. So shout out to Pablo, little cakes, sweet dreams.
01:18:50.260 - 01:19:03.824, Speaker A: And kind of a hilarious work here. More experimental AI with a little bit of video in there, perhaps. So just a fun work from little cakes. And here's another one. This one's a minute. So if we. I don't know.
01:19:03.824 - 01:19:41.966, Speaker A: So, yeah, it looks like AI video, doesn't it? Kind of underwater. So cool work there. Cool audio, too. Clips created on hugging face and borrowed from USC optical sound effects library. So very cool. From little Cakes edition of 15. That looks like it's sold out at 666.
01:19:41.966 - 01:20:01.278, Speaker A: Congrats to little cake, little cakes. Good work. Kanek Zapata, who puts out a ton of very interesting experimental AI. Here's another one. Just this kinda, you know, what looks like a rendering of, you know, autocad rendering of a person, but done with AI and some interesting light there. Just interest. Netsgeist.
01:20:01.278 - 01:20:18.374, Speaker A: Cool title, too. That is 665 soldiers edition of one. And here is Shilley Preston on the island of the sun and doing really well here. 136 minted. Of course, Shilley Preston was looking to raise some funds. Zora. Zora, I think, is delivering.
01:20:18.374 - 01:20:35.054, Speaker A: So very cool and great looking piece. I still want the maximize button here on Zora. That would be awesome. But anyway, cool AI artwork from Shirley Preston. That's on Zora. You can find it Shillypreston ETH on Zora. And here's Skomra.
01:20:35.054 - 01:20:57.666, Speaker A: Another cool work here. That almost looks like apple colors, doesn't it? The old apple computer colors or logo colors. Anyway, this is Skomra. Really cool piece. Kind of looks pixelated, but then you see it's like probably the stable diffusion textures, textural inverters, I think they call them. Really nice portrait here. Great color from Skomra.
01:20:57.666 - 01:21:56.830, Speaker A: And check this out. No hygiene with this outrageous pixelation here. Just very amazing. Again, you know, I saw that hen collector had written a post on Farcaster, and I hadn't logged into Farcaster for a few days, kind of wondering, had collected a no hygiene work and was kind of wondering what it all meant. And I was like, you know, I think the big attraction for me to know hygiene's work is the sheer kind of audacity of trying to, you know, just go breaking new ground using AI, you know, you know, in a way that AI, you know, is maybe, you know, in ways that AI is not being used by anyone else. And yeah, like just bringing new imagery, novel imagery, I think is one of one of the many things that we can appreciate here in this incredibly experimental, interesting works. I mean, maybe no hygiene.
01:21:56.830 - 01:22:24.604, Speaker A: It'd be awesome to bring no hygiene on the spaces. That would be fascinating. MO s h I t with a beautiful work. I think this is a little cakes portrait. I think one was sent to me, actually. I put this in the show and as I was putting the music at the end, I saw that one maybe had been sent to me, but I thought it was a beautiful work and. Yeah, and as you see here, we see the textiles and everything and maybe little cakes at the computer there working perhaps.
01:22:24.604 - 01:22:41.328, Speaker A: Very, very, very cool work by Mo. So co cool work. And this was, I think, posted in the community. Peter the Roman. So another interesting artist. Now, this is a big fan of your show. It's an oasis in a sea of noise.
01:22:41.328 - 01:22:55.026, Speaker A: Thank you. I thought I would share a selection of works now. Thanks for looking and keep up the great work. My pleasure. And very interesting. I wouldn't mind a little bit more information, like are these actual sculptures? They look like it. These are actual sculptures.
01:22:55.026 - 01:23:23.698, Speaker A: So pretty amazing work, isn't it? So more information. Peter the Roman. Feel free to write more about what is going on. Is this ceramic? Is this wax? Is this AI? I think it's real, like, so to speak, 3d. Very cool. I'm loving how this community is going as far as just discovering new work, bringing new people, and constantly look at this work by Martin Joe. Kinky ceramic stuff.
01:23:23.698 - 01:24:00.060, Speaker A: This has definitely a marquee to sad kind of feeling to it. And of course, Martin Jo, heavily influenced by the sad or sad, and there's the arms surrounding it. Cool. Very interesting to watch Martin Joe at work there and here, I think this is Gabby Walter, who I definitely follow that is an x glitch cooking the next drop. So working physically here and of course, working often with the Mickey mouse, the broken ear and here, and often pastiches of, you know, 16th and 17th century paintings as we go into the physical art here. In the final sort of stretch here, look at this. We've been looking at Adam Lister.
01:24:00.060 - 01:24:14.326, Speaker A: I was like, oh, working big here. Pretty powerful. Again, that style just looks great. Large here. I don't know if we have any more. That's everything. And this is Richard Prince.
01:24:14.326 - 01:24:39.898, Speaker A: And I find the Richard Prince is an incredibly interesting artist here. Working across several mediums here, I think. Do we have a close up? No, but as you see, it looks like it's collage, but then we have like oil stick, perhaps. And then we have a little bit of paint. Right? And then it looks like. I think he calls this is a woman series. I think here it is.
01:24:39.898 - 01:25:03.554, Speaker A: Untitled, inkjet. Inkjet. Inkjet. Oil stick. Acrylic, charcoal, gel, medium, and collage. Remember, I was talking about, you know, traveling through the mediums as being kind of, I would argue, still one of, if not one of, if not the main. From a technical perspective, the main conversation in.
01:25:03.554 - 01:25:26.434, Speaker A: In contemporary painting. I would argue, again, feel free to disagree. If you've watched this far, feel free to write a comment on that. But I would argue it's the main conversation, and I think that's what you're seeing here. I think that's what Richard Prince is basically voting in that direction with his paintbrush and collage and inkjet. Okay, very interesting work from Richard Prince there. Here's beers, London.
01:25:26.434 - 01:25:45.394, Speaker A: Two dogs and three ducks. Really nice composition here, isn't it? Tons of good work coming out. And the artist is Liam Alvey. And there's a solo show, feast of the Great Lakes. And I think that's in London at Beers, London. Very cool work here. And a very interesting composition here from machine.
01:25:45.394 - 01:26:13.910, Speaker A: Not sure what that means, but looks like a kind of cigarette of sorts, and just a great composition here. Again, using the airbrush and getting all sorts of interesting results there and wondering if that's machine there in the background. So cool work there, there. And here's another one from machine. Cool subject here. Girls in the club, 2024. Airbrush on canvas with this kind of stretched out rendering here.
01:26:13.910 - 01:26:41.642, Speaker A: Just very cool work. Cool colors, making each person a different color. Great piece. Very prolific machine here. I'm trying to buy one of your physical paintings and haven't been able to do so. So hilarious. Tim Lahan, whose work we've looked at quite a bit, again, kind of working with this spray paint, airbrush thing, clock a new open print and then putting this kind of pixelated esque mask.
01:26:41.642 - 01:27:04.954, Speaker A: But it's all done manually, but really nicely. Just really cool contemporary art here. And here is now Rustlin Vialtzev, of course, whose work we've looked at before. So another beautiful piece here. Just super interesting. Return of a green king. A lot of novel, cool artwork coming out right now.
01:27:04.954 - 01:27:39.714, Speaker A: Here's Strangford with a Rizzo print, pangolin Rizzo prints in floral, pink, and green on the way when the shop reopens. So two color rizzo print, which is like a color photocopier, but, yeah, beautiful. Actually kind of has an 18th century woodcut feeling to it, doesn't it? Great work there. And I love this piece. Becky Ayumi, a sketchbook here almost looks like, so I guess this is like a nightmare. And then it's kind of fire coming from the lance or whatever you would call that. And then the skull's just a brilliantly imaginative work here.
01:27:39.714 - 01:27:57.168, Speaker A: So the sketchbook is looking good. That opener is killer. Just really interesting artist. And that, my friends, is your show. Thank you for joining me once again, thank you for making it this far. Thank you for all the support. And until next time, hope you have a wonderful weekend, and take care.
01:27:57.168 - 01:27:57.564, Speaker A: Sa.
