00:00:05.680 - 00:00:36.450, Speaker A: I am in my old bedroom, if you can tell from the 1970s esque wallpaper, I suppose it was 1982 when this wallpaper was first applied to these walls that I grew up with. You are in the inside of my mind. Welcome, truly my old bedroom. As I was saying, this is what I was raised on. Welcome back. Artist journal, June 14, 2024. Broadcasting from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, on the road.
00:00:36.450 - 00:01:00.230, Speaker A: My name is Adrian Pokebelly. Continuing again on the road. Kind of weirdly ironic. I mean, Art Basel. Art Basel is not that far from me in Berlin. And here I am crossing the world over to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. I was thinking to myself, I was seeing the photos and everything, like, I need to go to this thing sometimes.
00:01:00.230 - 00:01:22.610, Speaker A: Like, will is everything here. I'm going to Brazil next week. If I can go to Brazil, I can surely make it to Basel, which is far closer to Berlin than that. Just visiting a friend who invited me out, and I never would go otherwise. So I'm just thrilled to go to Brazil. So going to Fortaleza. So we'll see what happens with the show.
00:01:22.610 - 00:02:02.384, Speaker A: I may just want to soak it all in. Then I'll be back in Berlin for a week and then back over to Spain for a week, and then everything should be back to complete normal. So it's going to be a little sporadic for the next two or three weeks, but I'm keeping, it's very important for me to just kind of keep a narrative here. I can't just ditch this thing for three months and expect anything, right? And in a sense, this is going to come up a little later here. You can't expect anything. I don't expect anything anymore to a certain degree. So all to say welcome back and thank you for supporting the show and I hope you're enjoying it.
00:02:02.384 - 00:02:26.242, Speaker A: And it's, I hope it's easy to enjoy with artists like Murakat. Murakit, a fabulous artist here we've been looking at. And let me just make sure I'm getting all of the name right. This is on foundation. I think it's mirapixel, but I'm pretty sure it's mirrorkit on Twitter. We'll see in a second here. Let's just see.
00:02:26.242 - 00:02:57.320, Speaker A: It is Murakit NFt, if you're wondering. And here is actually that first image that we're looking at here that is on the wall, as you can see here, a fabulous image. An artist we've been looking at for, I want to say, like two or three months, only maybe three months ago, four months ago, and has quickly kinda you know, put it this way, I. You know, you see, it's really fresh. Let's put it this way. It's different. It's fresh again.
00:02:57.320 - 00:03:26.910, Speaker A: And I even, like, say here, of course, this is a gif. Kind of looks like an anime figure, right? So what would traditionally be kind of like a line art illustration, right? But here, pixelized. Pixelated. And you have kind of a strange subject. I mean, this could be a still from, like, a manga. And for those that don't know, manga is the comic. Anime are the movies, so to speak, or the, you know, animated, actually the video.
00:03:26.910 - 00:03:55.580, Speaker A: Right. So manga are the comics. If anybody's more of an expert, by all means correct me. But I'm pretty sure from having worked in a comic store here in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, that is how it works. But again, making it look easy here with the things that are left out of. See this face here? Like, if you're working on this at home and you're making this work, there would be little temptations that, oh, is this not enough? Right. So there's a lot of decisions that look pretty good here.
00:03:55.580 - 00:04:40.462, Speaker A: Again, making it look easy. Even this gif, you know, even though it's a video, but this gif, like animation of, what, two frames, two, three frames? It looks like two frames. Just kind of slowly, you know, going back and forth here and kind of giving it everything it needs. Weirdly, just. And I, you know, it's a very painterly work in the way that this kind of illustration that is pixelated, right? This illustration that is pixelated. And then little areas are missing here, you know, just a beautifully kind of. Again, I want to say painterly.
00:04:40.462 - 00:05:29.878, Speaker A: And it's. It looks like an outline in large part, the woman here, but really. So which gives it, you know, and gives it a kind of texture and everything. So there's a lot to go through here, and I don't even know what's going on. Kind of hilariously, like, is that a bird in the girl's hand? Are these flowers, these yellow things? Or are they other animals? Is this behind her hand in the pond? Or this little puddle? Is it a puddle? I assume it's blue. It's the right color. But you see what I'm saying? And always with mirror kit, I kind of have this sneaking suspicion that the way we're getting these rich textures are effects on effects, I am not sure, but that is kind of like my ongoing thesis here.
00:05:29.878 - 00:05:49.282, Speaker A: So this is on foundation, which. Now this is on Ethereum, I should add, because foundation does base as well. So this is on Ethereum, so very cool. Murray dot murraypixel is the name on foundation. Let's see what it says here. Gm my collection, aquapixel. Beautiful title.
00:05:49.282 - 00:06:15.912, Speaker A: At sauna Disco parties in Guadalajara. Jalisco, I think, is how you pronounce that. So in Mexico, it is now minted and open to offers. So here is a nice big version of it. And there are other works, too. So you see, again, this textured, this beautiful texturedness. And there's just a sense of, you know, there's something very fresh and exciting about what we're seeing with Murakit, I feel, and it really feels to be going somewhere.
00:06:15.912 - 00:07:07.942, Speaker A: And Murkit's also like, on a roll, we might say, and quite prolific right now. And again, I see these kinds of interesting, complicated pixels here, complicated textures, digital textures. And what I see as a result, I would argue, is, again, it says to me, it cries out effects on effects, which is, I don't want to say it's untapped. I mean, the analog video glitch, people, as we were seeing last episode with X Mortal, who started the show, that's kind of like their stock in trade, is like, we'll put it through this process, then we'll put it through this process, then we'll put it through this process. So just an interesting. But I do want to say, to a certain degree, underutilized technique. I would argue.
00:07:07.942 - 00:07:23.684, Speaker A: I would argue if that's what's in fact going on here. Here's another one. It's on Zora. Part of Zora mafia circuited emonia, if I'm not mistaken. So more interesting titles. Free mint. Five minutes so far.
00:07:23.684 - 00:07:44.470, Speaker A: Here's another one. So you see a. You see a commonality between the works here. And you gotta love this. Almost like a video game here. The others, or like a website, these almost look like buttons at the top. And again, these wonderfully textured, you know, these wonderfully shaped buttons here.
00:07:44.470 - 00:08:07.894, Speaker A: And even just the very simple animation. It's an animation that's designed to give it life and no more right to give it that sense of animation, but then nothing more. And I like that. I think it's really interesting. I have a series on exchange art on Solana beached. And it's a. And so I've played with this idea.
00:08:07.894 - 00:08:51.569, Speaker A: It is effects on effects on effects. And one of the things is, do I want to animate this? And if you do, you know, if it's the sun over top of the water, are you trying to animate the water or are you simply kind of trying like this, you know, different kinds of animation, we might say, or are you just trying to make it dynamic? End of story. Are you just trying to make it move? Are you trying to make it feel alive, give it the quality of life without necessarily animating it? So. And that's what I'd argue we have here. This isn't an animation, so to speak. Although maybe technically you could say it's two different things moving against each other, but it's more just about giving the movement, adding movement to the static image. Right.
00:08:51.569 - 00:09:09.810, Speaker A: Beautiful. Again, looks like a screenshot. Could be AI. I mean, this could be AI, anime, manga, you know? So here's actually up close to further, and you see these little. Again, what kind of. I wish I could. We can zoom in.
00:09:09.810 - 00:09:57.700, Speaker A: You see how it's not like perfectly square, although it is kind of square, but you see how we kind of have all these variations here. The reason I say effects on effects is because I don't think mirror kit is drawing every one of these little things like this is a process, is what I think we can say was certain degree, certain degree of certainty here. This is processing the image and then taking different renderings or outcomes. And then, you know, perhaps animating two different outcomes, change the dithering amount or whatever, change the contrast, and then you get these gorgeous textured digital paintings. Right again, these canvases. So let's see. Let's continue.
00:09:57.700 - 00:10:20.040, Speaker A: So, just beautiful, beautiful work here. This is Mirikit on Zora, and we've seen these works here before. I believe I brought this up. And we've been looking at this work for, yeah, a few months here. Interesting. Interestingly. And here's one more, again, kind of a different take on it, but you see these brilliant outlines.
00:10:20.040 - 00:10:53.920, Speaker A: And of course, we saw Murkit on artsy as well. So working with a tradart gallery, doing selling, interestingly, the gifts through artsy, showing a static version, interestingly. So the gallery getting in on the situation, we'll have to return to that at a certain point. This is also on Zora, 43, minted. That's an older one, still 19 hours left on this older one here. You got to love the composition as well. Just this upper area, the lower area, even a touch of a skomra sort of feel to it.
00:10:53.920 - 00:11:33.670, Speaker A: They could, you know, these textured works. And again, you wonder to yourself, is this AI, you know, composition that has been processed the heck out of? Who knows? Very interesting. Another person who works with illustration and dithering and pixelation is Limbo who we had on last episode on the Twitter space on the x. Space on Wednesday was an awesome space, long overdue to get Limbo on the show and was just an awesome space. Talked deep on comics at the start and then all sorts of stuff. So great, great episode. Highly recommend it.
00:11:33.670 - 00:11:59.012, Speaker A: And also limbo is putting out. And of course I follow Limbo. That is a glitch on x when you load up 700 tabs like I do. Yeah. So Limbo is working on original comic book the earworm, and it's going to be on Solana and you can see it there. So go to Limbo's page if you want to be a funder for only $6. And you see there, you know, some of limbo's like, awesome.
00:11:59.012 - 00:12:36.794, Speaker A: I want to say somewhat earlier work that you'll find on object, beautiful, kind of surreal illustration. Now, the more recent work incorporates dithering this kind of pixelation. So we're all getting influenced by the pixel art over here. So last episode, again, pretty interesting view count. I don't know what's going on with the algorithm, but it seems to be plain nice on YouTube. 478 is pretty good for this show in one day, usually 300 is pretty good. So 478, or I guess it's been a couple of days, but nevertheless, these are more good numbers on YouTube, which is always exciting.
00:12:36.794 - 00:12:49.004, Speaker A: Let's look at the comments. Mandalore, thank you so much again for you, poker. Bella, you are welcome. Mandal, absolutely welcome for adding our cats into your channel. You made our day. Well, I'm thrilled to hear that it can have that effect on you. Mandel.
00:12:49.004 - 00:13:06.120, Speaker A: Still, I just love your work. Kelly Burns, New York. Great to see you again, Adrian. And I believe this is the same Kells or Kelly Burns who has a show. We're going to look at that right over here. We're going to look at Kells. We have a new show on the ecosystem here.
00:13:06.120 - 00:13:15.670, Speaker A: And cider. Hey, brother, thanks for featuring me on this episode. A great one. Thank you. Cider. Just rad to hear from you, as always. Dima Karlov.
00:13:15.670 - 00:13:25.370, Speaker A: Thank you so much, Adrian. Very interesting, as always. You're welcome. PP Universal thanks, Poco. And that says very grateful. Really. Well, that's awesome.
00:13:25.370 - 00:13:52.150, Speaker A: And I believe we have one or two more from PPE this episode. This was hilarious K Town cryptoking who always has kind of the far out comments with all of the, I want to say, wing webdingsh and everything. Wow. Fellow flatlander here. So, Prairie, someone else from the canadian prairies, born in Humboldt, Saskatchewan, which I think is just a few hours drive from here. Summer of 69. I can see you from here.
00:13:52.150 - 00:14:05.078, Speaker A: Hold the line. Hilarious. So that is hilarious. So great to hear. Cape Town cryptoking is from Humboldt, Saskatchewan in the middle in Canada's midwest. Retro Manny great show Jeff. Hilarious.
00:14:05.078 - 00:14:50.046, Speaker A: I mean Adrian, some great art today, and thanks for showing my latest trophy piece. A few topics that gave food for thought today. Firstly, the NFTs are a scam comment, and actually we have more on that is both old and new at the same time. Always sobering to remember how small a community we still are who actually perceive the value of nfts and does always come to perceive value. Selmy this pen comes to mind. I think you give a balanced and thoughtful response too, right? So of course this is referring to the other. I don't want to call it a trolling comment, but kind of a comment saying, you know, these NFTs are worthless, they're simply links to, you know, something on IFPs, if I am remembering that acronym correctly, to some other website, basically, or, you know, protocol, decentralized protocol.
00:14:50.046 - 00:15:16.428, Speaker A: But nevertheless, another protocol regarding AI. Another oldie but goodie. We're going to come back to that discussion in a second here. Rune tune left a detailed comment regarding AI, another oldie but goodie that always crops up. I am always to and fro with this one. The initial rise of AI art was the motivation for me to change my own style and approach. Not to say I haven't collabed with AI artists before and created some of my fastest selling works to date.
00:15:16.428 - 00:15:41.724, Speaker A: For me, it comes down to just the end result. I would agree with you there. It's about how the process of using AI creates new things, and about how the artists commute, communicates their intentions and expresses themselves through it. Not just to mimic traditional art in an obvious way, because they don't want to learn how to, for example, paint. And I think people who use AI are all lumped together in one pile, which is unfair to them. Yeah, excellent point. There is an overgeneralization that happens there.
00:15:41.724 - 00:16:11.738, Speaker A: Sky Goodman, human boy, AI machina, strange thing all come to mind when I think of artists using AI in the most profound way I can really appreciate their craft. And it's true. Anybody who actually tries to make AI art, you see actually how unsimple it is to make something poetic and well crafted. There is an artistry to it. Just like with sampling, there's an artistry in transforming things. And, you know. So yeah, the works speak for themselves, you know.
00:16:11.738 - 00:16:36.144, Speaker A: Again, I think a strange thing. Huge body of work now. And thug Lord was, of course, like a major work that was, you know, again, this kind of undeniable. An undeniable work. We have a work by Sky Goodman, this episode of really rad work, actually, and human boy has just been tearing up x. We'll have to take another look at human boy sometime very soon. So thank you for the comment and just a few more.
00:16:36.144 - 00:16:47.006, Speaker A: Niko, amazing show, Adrian. I'll. I've watched it tonight and very much enjoyed it. I'm thrilled to hear that. Niko. Totally awesome. Kels, great to see you back.
00:16:47.006 - 00:17:15.144, Speaker A: Adrian would love to hear more about Socrates, and that is the plan. And it would behoove Tezos foundation to listen up here at 1620. Brilliant idea. And I believe this is. This idea. You know, I. Why, you know, if you're going to be the art blockchain, I don't even see why they don't like, as far as I understand, you could theoretically have, like, bitcoin has, as far as I understand, four megabyte blocks.
00:17:15.144 - 00:17:49.774, Speaker A: If. Why don't you make an art blockchain that could be 100 megabyte blocks, let's say, or even 200 megabyte blocks. I assume that's possible. And then everything just goes on chain, you know, and if Tezos was to do an upgrade like that, I mean, it would change the blockchain. But, you know, just from my limited perspective, I am not an expert. I would say, you know, go all in on the art, because that seems to be the main value of the blockchain. From my limited, you know, unknowing perspective, go all in and just make it where it's all on chain.
00:17:49.774 - 00:18:06.990, Speaker A: I mean, that would be amazing. And if it. I. Weirdly, it hasn't happened yet. As far as I know, there should be a blockchain where everything is just purely on chain, and you can put 200 megabyte files. So I'm glad you enjoy that idea. Kels, more from Kelsoon here.
00:18:06.990 - 00:18:18.070, Speaker A: Human boy artist journal around the world. It sure is. Hope you are having a wonderful visit home. Great episode. Thank you, human boy. I totally appreciate that. It is great to see everybody.
00:18:18.070 - 00:18:30.664, Speaker A: Sanro, great episode. Thank you. I believe we have a work a portrait by Sanro in this episode, too. Thank you. Ilya Barberin. Great job, dude. What you do is simply amazing, and I never get tired of comments like this.
00:18:30.664 - 00:18:43.340, Speaker A: Thank you, Ilya. I think we actually have a drawing by you of a cell phone in the studio. Oxdk. Always like your positive vibes. Adrian. By the way this artwork is by Yafeeg. By yafig, if I'm pronouncing that right.
00:18:43.340 - 00:18:58.144, Speaker A: Thank you, Oxdk. Thank you for correcting me on that. I think I was getting confused there by post and whatnot. Anyway, thank you, Trippie collector. Let's go. Late night north american episode. That's exactly what happened.
00:18:58.144 - 00:19:18.272, Speaker A: Kiro eath. Welcome back. Thank you, Kiro. Just trying to put them in. I'm basically, for the next couple of weeks I'm doing them when I can and trying to the Twitter spaces and everything, the X spaces and we're doing okay. We just got to keep the show on the road here until we're back. And the Internet is working in Berlin if you missed that last episode.
00:19:18.272 - 00:19:28.794, Speaker A: So that is good too. Berku or Bayram. Great to hear from you as ever. And Obu and oh Booby have to start watching to the end. Awesome. Thank you, booby. So that is great.
00:19:28.794 - 00:20:09.890, Speaker A: Let's look at rune tunes comment here. 1350 decibel 825 said NFTs are a scam. I won't give that notion words, but your response pokebally provoked me because I wasn't totally unsympathetic to this idea. And of course I don't think they're a scam, but this. There is a point of failure here between a link. Put it this way, I think this idea, just to restate the argument, as far as I recall, is this idea that there's a link to some external file and that really, this is the record of the link to that external file which is stored in the inter. Was it international protocol file service or something to this effect.
00:20:09.890 - 00:20:47.202, Speaker A: You know, there's a point of failure there. And I was sort of pointing out how bitcoin, what's kind of cool about inscriptions is there's no point of failure. I would argue it is putting everything on chain, right? But you have to make tiny files or spend, you know, a fortune to put like 100 kilobyte file on there. Right? Like I'll put in a ten kilobyte file. It'll cost me $30 if I'm lucky. Right? So all to say so just to open up the conversation here, I want to understand why that's so important to you. As far as you can put a lot of stock into this idea of inscribing blockchains with art.
00:20:47.202 - 00:21:22.250, Speaker A: I want to understand why that's so important to you and stoke the conversation here. I'm under the impression that inscribing art onto the blockchain makes its token of authenticity as a digital asset more immutable. That would be the general. There's one less point of failure, is how I would put it. As decibel 825 points out, most NFTs are just digital transactions with a link to the art, which can be easily right click saved. And this part I don't mind, like, or I doesn't really carry much water with me, but it's actually the link. It is the link that is the issue, the point of failure.
00:21:22.250 - 00:21:44.030, Speaker A: So if the platform or IPfs crashes, your digital asset is gone. And that, I guess that's the idea. That is the concern. Why do you care about this? Why do we care about this? It's because we value digital assets. Then maybe that's the point I'm missing. Yeah, I would say. I would just call it a structural resiliency.
00:21:44.030 - 00:22:38.220, Speaker A: There's something to be said for it's just one more point of failure. Whereas bitcoin, you put it all on, as long as bitcoin survives and they don't prune everything. As Santiago pointed out, the other Santiago with, as long as they don't do some update, getting rid of all ordinals, then it's kind of there and you can't do anything about it. It's there, you know, it's quote unquote immutable. Let's continue. But if we care because we value art, is this really a problem? Well, I'd say we're so early on this, put it this way, as some people call it, I think accurately, the bitcoin blockchain. And history is the hardest data layer known to humanity.
00:22:38.220 - 00:23:51.960, Speaker A: Right? So given that, as an artist, particularly as a digital artist, it kind of presents an opportunity, I would argue a royal opportunity to have your work inscribed somewhere that can be retrieved theoretically for a thousand years, maybe longer. And we have to be, I would say we have to be honest with ourselves. Do we think IPFS is going to be around in a thousand years? Maybe bitcoin won't. Maybe it gets cracked next week. But I'd say in terms of our best bet at what you might call resiliency or quote unquote permanence, I think it's unquestionable that the bitcoin blockchain is our best bet, so to speak. To me, it doesn't have anything actually to do with the art itself, but in terms of where to put it. And there is also the sense of value of it being on bitcoin, the kind of granddaddy blockchain there is a sense of you're putting it on digital gold, whereas you don't have that, I would argue with ipfs.
00:23:51.960 - 00:24:40.116, Speaker A: Let's continue. But if the art is truly valuable, I keep sensing this impression that inscribing art onto the blockchain, inscribing it onto the blockchain makes the art more valuable. But if the art is truly valuable, won't it inherently hold its value through people's appreciation, sharing, engagement and purchases? Yeah, so I would say we're talking about different kinds of value here. You're talking about the value of the work of art itself. But if we had no nfts at all or no blockchain, the thing is, as a digital artist, your work, it could have been the greatest work in the world. But there's no credible way of buying or selling it, I would argue. I've been there and some people were trying to tell me, you can put it on a USB and then you do a certificate of authenticity.
00:24:40.116 - 00:25:27.592, Speaker A: I personally don't find that credible in my world. Nothing against anybody that that does. And for me, when I see something like, you can put your work on bitcoin and everybody has to make their own decision on that because not everybody's into bitcoin for environmental cost or whatever other reasons, but I see something like that, the hardest data layer known to humanity. And I go, that's pretty darn interesting as a place to put my art. And oh, by the way, you may not have much time to put your art on there, right? And oh, by the way, you know, as far as inscribing it directly onto that blockchain, we only started doing that a year ago. So there's this little window, theoretically, where you can put your art on there even though it has to be small size. But hey, what if.
00:25:27.592 - 00:26:09.932, Speaker A: And then all of a sudden, and I would just kind of finally argue on this, there's like, there is art on the bitcoin blockchain. There's a lot of nice art. There's not that much art, though I would argue like it's all things considered, I don't see a huge amount of what I would art that I need to go and kind of purchase and be excited about. There is some, and you know, I, you know, just to speak very generally, it is a under. There is not a ton of art on the bitcoin blockchain. There is art, but there's not a ton. And I also think that's an opportunity, especially if this thing goes to 150,000 or 200,000 or the fees go up.
00:26:09.932 - 00:26:54.388, Speaker A: As I was saying last episode, some people think the guy at sovereign calling bitcoin block space in a year could be the most expensive computing that you can get. Imagine if you had your work on all that being said, imagine you had your work on bitcoin and you had the foresight and took the risk, and then all of a sudden you have 200 works on bitcoin. How rad would that be? Is kind of the thought process that I have going on. And finally, one less point of failure. I don't need to worry about ipfs, right? And, you know, like, the older I get, the less I kind of believe in anything, you know, any institution. So any, oh, ipfs is going to be there forever. You know, like.
00:26:54.388 - 00:27:12.212, Speaker A: Or, oh, objects going to be there forever. Bitcoin should outlast, one would think, all of these things. So again, so I don't want to belabor the point here. Let's continue. But I would separate the art itself from where you're putting it. To me, they're kind of, like, different. They're different.
00:27:12.212 - 00:27:31.442, Speaker A: Like, that doesn't mean if you put up any work of art on bitcoin, it's going to be a great work of art. Or if you don't put it on bitcoin, it's not going to be a good work of art. Not making that argument at all. Decibel 825 seems to believe that the easy duplication of digital art makes buying and supporting the artist a scam. Right. I. So the whole right click save thing.
00:27:31.442 - 00:27:48.354, Speaker A: Yeah, like, we're long past that whole criticism, I think. And, yeah, that's a. In a weird way, you could say that. Undermine decibel 820 five's point. I think if they just stopped at ipfs, then it's like, I'm not unsympathetic to this. And look, I bought a. Bought a Zozo.
00:27:48.354 - 00:28:06.360, Speaker A: One of one. I think we'll see it today, yesterday. So it's not like I've stopped buying, but it's like it's a point of failure. You could argue. And so let's continue. What seems like a real scam to me is artists being exploited through minting and mining fees, which benefit anyone but the artist. Bitcoin and ethereum transactions are not cheap.
00:28:06.360 - 00:28:25.050, Speaker A: Well, it depends. I mean. Yeah, like with. Yeah, I mean, everybody's got to come to their own decision, is how I would put this. Bitcoin is not cheap. I would say, you get something for your money, you're getting a ticket onto the. Again, the hardest data layer, the most resilient data layer.
00:28:25.050 - 00:28:52.936, Speaker A: I mean, a different person was describing it. Like, if the US army wanted to take this out, they couldn't, right? I mean, that's resilience, right? So let's continue. Money is incentivizing, no doubt, but the true value of art lies in the interaction between the artwork and the viewer. Indeed. But there's a difference between that and the credible way of selling it. And this is what I would say. Like, I mean, I, look, I made art before nfts existed.
00:28:52.936 - 00:29:27.710, Speaker A: I made a lot of digital art. I didn't know what to do with it. And my whole challenge was how to make it physical, right? So when selling nfts was an awesome way to be able to do that, it was a more credible way than the USB and the certificate of authenticity. For me, it was actually the first time it was actually credible. Okay? It does this link to ipfs and it's registered on the blockchain. All of a sudden it's like, hey, this is credible. I would actually say it's credible despite the point of failure that exists between the blockchain and ipfs.
00:29:27.710 - 00:30:04.060, Speaker A: However, I would say it's even more credible from just a way of buying and selling the art. I would argue when you inscribe it directly on chain, there's one less point of failure. Right. And in that respect, in that regard, I. You have a better, like, I would just argue a more credible way of buying and selling. I don't need to worry about it other than if the bitcoin people decide to get rid of all ordinals, which is not impossible, but probably unlikely at this point. It's like the battle has kind of already been won, from what I understand.
00:30:04.060 - 00:30:35.106, Speaker A: So, yes, let's continue. Like, as an artist, am I really going to spend $10 so someone maybe buys my artwork, of which I will give a fraction of the full value due to minting gas, whatever. I can't subscribe to this idea that it's exciting to see what artists can make with kilobytes of space because bitcoin is so darn expensive to inscribe. Well, you know, when it was at eight, it was at eight v bytes recently. Like, I mean, it's expensive, but it's cheaper than Ethereum. I would argue at times when the fees go low, like, Ethereum can actually be a lot more. And.
00:30:35.106 - 00:31:03.306, Speaker A: And you're putting it directly on chain. Right. So it's, again, it's all about what are your concerns? Everybody has kind of has to make their own decisions on this stuff. But I have to say, working small and seeing what you can make is, I find, profoundly exciting as an artist. I'm working on a whole other series, the Dante works. There were like four to 5. Never would have made that series without these limitations.
00:31:03.306 - 00:31:22.480, Speaker A: And I love these limitations. Like, what can I make a work look good? That's 2 kb. That's exciting. Like, what if I can. Like, how cool is that? And you know what? Then I can put it on bitcoin, right? I would love some clarity. So I hope I gave clarity in this discussion here. Atlas pop.
00:31:22.480 - 00:31:55.860, Speaker A: If the ipFs. If IPS fess is broken, the contract still exists. So if you can't see the files, say, a JPeG from the contract location, maybe in the future you can verify the contract on the artists or art organization's website where they might store all of their assets and their associated contracts. It's like, yeah, maybe. Right? So all to say, thank you, everybody, for the comments here. Runtoon. In other words, I'd rather mint a thousand artworks on tezos for pennies than to spend two figures on a single mint on ether.
00:31:55.860 - 00:32:20.264, Speaker A: Bitcoin, right? So I think it's. Everybody has to make their own decision on this. And again, I would love to see something like tazos. I don't know. It's probably too late at this point, but what if they had, like, 200 megabyte block size? And if not, there should be a blockchain that does that, you know? So let's continue. And just a few from the community here. Bosque grazias.
00:32:20.264 - 00:32:39.270, Speaker A: Awesome. Look at this rad work here. Made my collage made by collage magazine at Malaga. We're traveling and doing collages locally from postcards, magazines, and books. So also working on the road and so very cool. Hopefully I see Bosque in Berlin when I get back. I think Bosque is visiting.
00:32:39.270 - 00:33:02.580, Speaker A: Skull takes scanner by ld Art Gallery yes, this was an interesting artist that I'd never seen before. Thank you for posting skull takes with another rad work by no hygiene. We actually have at least one in this episode. And Sanro, great to hear from you. And we have an artwork by you in this episode. And of course, Kurt hustle collective. And I think we looked at this last episode doing the lime.
00:33:02.580 - 00:33:19.896, Speaker A: Just love their work. So we were saying Kells. Kells is on the scene. GM massive cringe alert. YouTube channel launch a mess on this first attempt. Apologies on the weirdness, stalling, and bungling, but maybe scrub through if you'd like. I can totally relate, Kells.
00:33:19.896 - 00:33:55.478, Speaker A: Thanks, Pokebelly, for the inspiration. So thank you, Kels, for the shout out here. So Kels is doing kind of like, as you can see, just talking about nfts here. And I started watching some of it and I think it's, you know, I just got to commend Kells. It takes a lot of courage. The hardest part is starting, and you really are just kind of fumbling and, you know, as he says, fumbling pauses and cluttered disposals. There's no workaround, I would argue, to broadcasting.
00:33:55.478 - 00:34:41.450, Speaker A: There's no shortcut like it's, you have to, there's like a price to entry, which is failing in public for a certain amount of time. And I'm not saying it looks like Kells actually did a pretty good job, and you're probably better than you think is often what happens, but there is a cost to entry for broadcasting, and it's not for the weary, I would argue. Like, you have to truly kind of, to a certain degree, not care and just be willing to, you know, every day, every time you post something, really put your reputation to a certain degree on the line and just say, that's what it is. This is me. So big shout out and congrats to Kelly Burns, New York. What's the musings? 16 subscribers. So growing nicely actually, after one episode here.
00:34:41.450 - 00:34:58.424, Speaker A: So congrats to you for posting this, Kells. It takes courage. It takes courage and it looks pretty cool. I started watching and it. Nice voice and everything. Okay, let's continue, Beanie. This was interesting.
00:34:58.424 - 00:35:41.684, Speaker A: This is fascinating. So finally, the, it would appear sensationally that the NFT, like in terms of the PFP profile picture project, that bubble seems to be bursting shockingly. I mean, it's always a shock until after it starts to happen and you go, of course it was a bubble. Who knows? And I think it was Beanie, who's actually a pretty controversial ex poster here. Let's see what Beanie has to say. Of course, these are the crypto punks. For those that don't know, the famous crypto punk, nearly no liquidity right now in the cryptopunks market.
00:35:41.684 - 00:36:17.500, Speaker A: And of course, the crypto punks are the most famous, most expensive, most celebrated profile picture projects in crypto on the Ethereum blockchain. Likely. I think it's on Ethereum, or at least, at least celebrated by the ETH people. Likely. We don't see the bottom until punks over the counter capitulates as he's so some account punk's OTC capitulates as he's the only buyer at the moment. The seller huddled or held for two years and lost 62 ETH. Now ETH is at $3,300 about right now.
00:36:17.500 - 00:36:56.872, Speaker A: So however, because they bought the crypto punk when ETH was at $1,100, the damage is not as bad, although in dollar value it was only a marginal realized loss, as ETH was about $1,100. So he was. Beanie was also commenting, crypto punks have gone below 30 ETH. Like this was a big deal. It is at $102,000. I've been following it. You know, like when you look at, you know, if you haven't looked at OpenSea and the PFP projects, like if you look at Bored Ape Yacht Club, you know, another celebrated, it's at eleven ETH, the floor at one point that was at 150.
00:36:56.872 - 00:37:18.540, Speaker A: If I'm not mistaken. Those were going for half a million dollars. Now they're going for 33. And let me just show you something here. Opensea, like, it's like I'll just show you. So, because it's quite remarkable what's going on here and it's not getting a ton of play. So here's bored ape yacht club.
00:37:18.540 - 00:38:03.342, Speaker A: Let's see if here it is. And you go to activity, right, just as an example, you see floor price and you see what happened here, up here, know, 129, 158 eth average price, 158 eth at the peak. Now we're at ten. And what you'll see here, you see there with Eth and then there it's weth wrapped eth. These are when there are bids beforehand, so you can just accept. Right? So you see the lack of liquidity. Here's someone who bought someone is going, okay, it's low enough, I'm going to buy at ten eth, but you see all these w eths rapt east, these are all just people who'd made offers and they're being accepted.
00:38:03.342 - 00:38:39.448, Speaker A: And so you see how few buyers there are on the market. Here's another one, like buyers who are actively buying, who haven't already put in a bid. There's two in the last, you know, 25, here's three, here's another one. So, I mean, it's quite remarkable what's going on. This is all 60 in the last 16 hours. So you're seeing a, I would argue you're seeing a bit of a panic, you know, and you kind of don't want to use that word lightly, but it seems like a bit of a panic. Here's an interesting tweet here.
00:38:39.448 - 00:39:11.772, Speaker A: Kobi wan. I feel like the NfT bubble popped without a lot of folks on my timeline realizing. Yeah, like, the only reason I found this tweet is because I put Nft bubble into the search, because I'm like, why isn't anybody talking about this? This is like, this is sensational, what's going on? Like, I mean, it's quite something. Now here, uh, this is a Jani Soordis Greek DX replying to Artie hands, who is saying the Tazos volume. Right. Right now looks like a howdy do bid. Uh, tezos not doing that terrible.
00:39:11.772 - 00:39:35.640, Speaker A: I mean, 2000 tezos here, top buyers. I don't. I've seen tezos at like $250, uh, in the top ten. That's not so bad, if you ask me. Like, there is life, and that's only at the bottom of the top ten. So I think, you know, to me, this isn't as concerning as what we see here, which is which Jenny posted here. This is Opensea volume.
00:39:35.640 - 00:39:55.530, Speaker A: So Opensea is the website. We're just on a major marketplace selling nfts. Look at this. So going from billions to who knows how much this is, but almost flat. I. It'll be interesting to see this month with all of the panic selling, if that goes up. I imagine it will, but it's gonna be at lower prices.
00:39:55.530 - 00:40:28.508, Speaker A: So, all to say, quite interesting, what's going on in the, what I'm tempted to call the PFP. I mean, we've seen the art market kind of dry up a little bit on ETh just because fees were expensive. It was getting expensive. People kind of would rather hold their etH, which was going up. Tezos, to me, looks actually pretty good these days. Like, and it's cheap, which is what you want, like the art. So for me, kind of back to the rune tune discussion, for me to take the leap and go, hey, I'm going to spend $9 us or 14 tez on a Zozo.
00:40:28.508 - 00:40:59.666, Speaker A: One of one. I can say to myself, you know, this may be worth nothing, right, in ten years because. Not because of Zwozo, but because of blockchains and how everything turns out. But I can also go, but if it is, maybe this could, like, be worth 100 times what it's worth. It's not crazy to think, as Zuozo, one of one in ten years is going to be $900, you know, if this stuff does catch. So I look at the risk reward and I go, okay, Tezos looks great. I mean, it's always been a feature the cheapness, not a bug.
00:40:59.666 - 00:41:32.608, Speaker A: It's a feature. I think Tezos is $0.88. It's like good people are going to keep selling their work because the risk reward you're getting, really nice, cheap art. Really nice art for cheap. And if this technology somehow holds together, and it seems to have been since 2020, you know, we've seen auctions. If it all holds, and there's no reason to really think it won't, then you could really do well here and also get a fantastic art collection. And that's another thing.
00:41:32.608 - 00:42:23.406, Speaker A: Even if this is all worthless in the end, I can still go, hey, look at my awesome art collection, and I can still go, you know, this gallery may think it's all that, but I think I could clean the floor with this, you know, with what I have here. You know, I could just, like, completely, you know, obliterate to say, you know, even some museums, I would argue you could some people's collections here, I would argue. Maybe that's a controversial take, but I would argue, you know, there's something major going on. So even if it's worth less for me, it's still worth something. And in that respect, probably to someone else too, right? Actually, let's quickly look at this tweet here by Artie hands. My relationship with the space has fundamentally changed in the last 12 hours, much to think about. The reason I hate the trad art world just happened here.
00:42:23.406 - 00:43:10.220, Speaker A: I'm livid and so incredibly disappointed. Well, almost to rune tune's point, like, I assume it's for some financial reason, right? Or some sort of trading thing. Like, I'm kind of. As long as I stay focused on the art, I'm kind of. I don't really worry too much about this scene. I go, this scene is kind of better than ever when you're looking at it from an art perspective. There are so many great artists right now, and they've all been getting better through this little market engine, free market engine, you know, even if it's just on Tazo, selling works for $10, it's enough of an incentive for people to keep making art and selling their work, you know, buying groceries with their art, getting a haircut, as Sky Goodman pointed out a long time ago.
00:43:10.220 - 00:43:50.316, Speaker A: So that would be my kind of response to this is just, look, the art will make you excited. And finally, we can't expect the digital art scene to be any different from the trad art scene in terms of human nature. It's all just humans working together. I would say the only difference is structural, where the tradart scene has much longer time to build up all these structures of gatekeeping, which really results in gatekeeping, whereas here there's still more opportunity because there aren't as many gates. And yeah, there is gatekeeping in the digital art world and in this scene and whatever. But I'd say it's just far less. It's still more open pastures you can do.
00:43:50.316 - 00:44:18.452, Speaker A: You know, you can. Things can happen really fast. Even with Instagram. You don't even need to be in the crypto side of it. Look at Okote, look at strange thing on Instagram, right? Look at human boy on x, right? Like when you start, if you can get attention, you have a business. If you can consistently get a certain amount of attention, you have a business as an artist. And just as anything, because the worst case scenario is you sell some advertising if you can get the attention.
00:44:18.452 - 00:45:05.510, Speaker A: So the attention economy, as they call it, another just kind of take on it, you know, again, we don't need to be entirely crypto focused. I would also say, like, here's walk. 24 hours left on Woody. So a physical work here and walk, you know, being an Internet based artist, selling on eBay and continuing to sell work, like $51 for this gorgeous work of art, this is a total win win. This is a win for walk, and this is a massive win for whatever collector walks away with this, probably for under $200. We saw how good these look in the past, part two. And as we know, walk does a super professional job, as you see the other side stamped certificate of authenticity signature.
00:45:05.510 - 00:45:29.890, Speaker A: That's how you do it, you know, creating value. It's very important. Those steps. Just another kind of interesting physical artwork here. As you see, this artist, I'm trying to figure out, kind of looks like cutouts. 16 and a half by eleven inches. It looks like scissors here, so maybe just like colored squares, as you see here.
00:45:29.890 - 00:45:46.396, Speaker A: So making quite a beautiful. Almost looks like an AI artwork, doesn't it? To our AI discussion. Look how beautiful this is. It looks like a painting. So just really talented. Lola Dupre. And here you get a little hint of what's going on.
00:45:46.396 - 00:46:03.356, Speaker A: Or is it painted on top? I'm still trying to figure it out, but the. The results are beautiful. Lola Dupre. Let's see how many, just what kind of reaction this is getting. 69 retweets. 537 x is a good place to still post your art. 14,000 views.
00:46:03.356 - 00:46:16.086, Speaker A: I mean, that was worth posting, wasn't it? Pretty good. And here is Ilya Barabin. I'm working. Hi, y'all. And I thought this was hilarious. A cell phone. This is like a modern, you know, painter's studio.
00:46:16.086 - 00:46:29.994, Speaker A: And there is the cell phone being painted, maybe with an airbrush and everything. There is the background color. I draw slowly. I wanted to do it more. I want a personal exhibition. So just awesome. And here it is on Zora.
00:46:29.994 - 00:46:42.802, Speaker A: Look at that. So a physical work. Free mint, a thousand additions. Phone of joy. I love it. A magic wand when you feel sad. Photo of the work paper, 30 by 40 acrylic oil, pastel, pencil, and airbrush.
00:46:42.802 - 00:47:00.968, Speaker A: Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. So that is on zora as an NFt. And I thought this was hilarious. Trippy collector posting this. The plotters keep getting smaller. So Galitzer park is in Berlin, kind of an edgy park in the middle of Kreuzberg there. For those that know they're Berlin, Linus and Golitzer park.
00:47:00.968 - 00:47:24.634, Speaker A: So pen plotting at Golitzer, which is pretty hilarious. So even has a little battery there and everything. How cool is that? We have to speed up 47 minutes. Clownvamp last year. So this is also really cool. Last year, I busted my art budget chasing a Harold Cohen Triptych. So we saw there was the show at the Whitney.
00:47:24.634 - 00:47:49.810, Speaker A: Remember Harold Cohen, early AI artist pioneer? It's been home for a few months now, and it finally feels like mine. So I wanted to share and explain the context. It spans 45 years from before AI in 1964 to 2009, a few years before his death. And so here are the three works. I retweeted this tweet. If you want to see it, if you want to read it. We can't go through the whole thing, but here's some early work.
00:47:49.810 - 00:48:19.590, Speaker A: Quite beautiful, I have to say, and then hear more interesting work here. So this Harold Cohen guy, pretty awesome artist. So let me just see. And, yeah, we'll just go through this here. So interesting results here. Trying all sorts of different things. So Harold Cohen looking very interesting.
00:48:19.590 - 00:48:46.198, Speaker A: And here is this. Okay, let's continue. Element li perspective. So some physicals, some more physicals by element Li. Probably using painting or staining on top of this cardboard, and then probably using, I would think, a laser engraver. But what does it say? Cardboard, acrylic and wooden frame. Is that acrylic paint? I think.
00:48:46.198 - 00:49:08.628, Speaker A: I suspect it's acrylic. Is probably the brown here on the paint, on the cardboard. And then probably laser engraving is what this looks like on the cardboard. Digging in a little bit into the cardboard and probably making it a dark color through the burning. So just more super interesting. Work by. This is in Vienna.
00:49:08.628 - 00:49:19.740, Speaker A: Veen, element li. So element li doing really, really well. Here's another beautiful work. Gotta love the wood kind of setup here. And then this. I mean, incredibly original work. Road.
00:49:19.740 - 00:49:53.338, Speaker A: This is also in this exhibit, I think, just doing really awesome work here. I love the brush strokes underneath because it's just like. It's like any of us could, you know, theoretically. Not necessarily could have theoretically made these brushstrokes. And then you just put this on top, employing kind of classic techniques that you'd find in Warhol, sigmar, polka, you know, paint underneath, and then you put a layer on top that basically has nothing to do with the underlying layer, you could argue. And here, it just creates instant poetry, is what I call that. So just beautiful work from element ly.
00:49:53.338 - 00:50:07.466, Speaker A: Here is another work. Flower. Interesting kind of colors. This one's digital, of course, and looking like thorns here. A little bit of texture, some color, gray background. Object. This is on Instagram.
00:50:07.466 - 00:50:21.450, Speaker A: Here's another one. Road. This is called nightgrass. So just more beautiful pixel art from element ly. Very prolific. That's just a hint, a snippet of what element ly is doing. So here's another gorgeous work.
00:50:21.450 - 00:50:43.884, Speaker A: This is Sabato. Look at these colors. Free as a kite. So this is for nowhere to run, Art Basel. And I believe this has to do with raising funds for the UN HCR on June 20 in honor of World Refugee Day. So here it is. Another awesome, gorgeously colored work by Sabato.
00:50:43.884 - 00:51:13.104, Speaker A: And here, all these kites in the sky and all the different colored kites and everything. And someone getting one ready with what look like surveillance cameras, don't they? Surveillance drones on both sides, looking at the refugees, perhaps. Who are the refugees? You know, gorgeous work. I even love the pink. The decisions, like, the pink of the string of the kite is a beautiful decision. Really beautiful, beautiful work. Kind of looks like sunset.
00:51:13.104 - 00:51:39.176, Speaker A: So this is zero editions. Not exactly sure. We have a couple of more works from this show. Let me just quickly know where to run. Nft drop UNHCR, and let's see if we can bring up the works. And so you see here, le chat noir, Sabato axine. I believe I brought this up, as well as mech TXT, Violet Bond, Diane Drube doing her trademark clouds here.
00:51:39.176 - 00:51:54.622, Speaker A: So we got a few clouds. And Eduardo Cac, legoglyph, crypto animation and animation here. So that's on object on Tazos. So here's another work. This is Zora. Another work by Sabato. Please visit the Museum of Contemporary Art.
00:51:54.622 - 00:52:11.206, Speaker A: They have a new parking lot. This is part of a series called Degen drawings. And you see beeple, Balthus and more. And look at this beautiful parking lot here. You can see the different patterning here. Really beautifully, beautifully done. The parking animated.
00:52:11.206 - 00:52:28.400, Speaker A: And what looks like a big contemporary art sculpture in the front. And maybe that's the building and even the bottom, these big chunky squares with a circulating gradient there. And also here. Not exactly sure. Maybe that's a flag. Not sure. And a duck and everything.
00:52:28.400 - 00:52:45.770, Speaker A: Hilarious. Beautiful work, this on Zora, free mint 25 minted so far. Beautiful. Love the font and everything. Nice production from Sabato, as usual. Nicholas Dietrich. So f hash is the harmonic of the earth.
00:52:45.770 - 00:53:25.576, Speaker A: So classic Nicholas Dietrich. Color is kind of a different style of composition, more of a kind of freewheeling composition. Almost these windows here, kind of experimental, I would argue from Nicholas Dietrich's kind of more traditional, what I'd say narrative painting style kind of has always a bit of a Paul Delvaux feeling to the work. Enigmatic pixel art is what I like to call this stuff. And here you see just some beautiful, beautiful colors, like what is going on in this kind of pyramid here. This looks like a pyramid of Giza, the inside. So very interesting work here, as usual.
00:53:25.576 - 00:53:42.010, Speaker A: Nice composition, you know, when you take a step back. So just beautiful work. Still available for five tezos. Only five sold, edition of 20. So that's. I mean, Tezos is cheap right now, so $4.06. So pretty reasonable.
00:53:42.010 - 00:54:07.524, Speaker A: Here is Mac, also in the nowhere to run series, a giant pool of red mud. And so that is the name of the work. And this is. There's an offer. There's an addition of 20. And as you can see here, kind of minimal color scheme, almost monocolor. But then with this beautiful pink or purplish pink and red, and kind of a classical feel to it.
00:54:07.524 - 00:54:31.340, Speaker A: Pixel art with kind of, like, combining a lot of things and then a bit of a kind of pastoral landscape in the background. And this looks like water. So kind of a wild work here. A giant pool of red mud by mech txt Michael Macasso. Here's another work Martin Bruce organic bought. I don't think we saw this. And this is the full size.
00:54:31.340 - 00:55:03.228, Speaker A: And just another one of these, what I almost want to call symmetrical works by Martin Bruce. And of course, he was on the spaces the other day, last week. And just a beautiful work. Just completely original and kind of has a bit of an organic bought feeling. And, of course, Martin Bruce. I mean, again, the reason it's kind of hard to discuss a Martin Bruce work is because I don't think Martin Bruce is discussing it in his head. It was like the title of last episode, visual thinking.
00:55:03.228 - 00:55:32.380, Speaker A: I was talking about Martin Bruce when I titled when I was discussing visual thinking in last episode. This is visual thinking at work here. Yeah. Like they're, in a sense, to try and explain it other than you can say some formal things that, you know, it's moving, it's symmetrical, it's got some interesting texture. But you're not going to get much further than that, I would argue, because you're dealing with kind of intuitive visual thinking. Here's the zozo. So I picked this up, actually, last night.
00:55:32.380 - 00:56:01.032, Speaker A: 14 tezos, $9, I think. Let's see if we can hear it. So you can. So there it is. Just another cool, cool, cool work by Zozo. Even hear the running water. I don't even know what it is.
00:56:01.032 - 00:56:18.112, Speaker A: I know not what it is, other than maybe a plant and kind of got a feeling of a window. Interesting composition inside plant house. Maybe that's what it is. Let us continue here. So 14 tezos, one of one. I wanted a zozo. One of one.
00:56:18.112 - 00:56:34.654, Speaker A: So I was thrilled to get that. Neurocolor on o matidia. Just another. I'd never seen this work by neurocolor before. Kind of cool. Just a massive response here. 144 retweets, 20,000 views, 100 bookmarks.
00:56:34.654 - 00:57:02.480, Speaker A: Yeah, nice piece. So it looks like a new one, if I had to guess from neurociller, whose work was selling for, I want to say, like 100 ETH at one point, which is a huge amount of money. Like, imagine like two or $300,000. I'm not an expert, though, so that might not exactly be super accurate, but that's what I remember. Pbuniversal with some more interesting pieces here. A gun holding a cigarette, interestingly. And what looks like maybe a shot of alcohol here.
00:57:02.480 - 00:57:22.646, Speaker A: Beautifully colored. So cool work. This is on Instagram from pipiuniversal. And here's another one. This one's on object testas tetas in me perfeel, maybe head in my profile, not sure. Edition of five for seven tazos each. And here, kind of looks like a bust of someone.
00:57:22.646 - 00:57:44.380, Speaker A: And here, beautifully rendered, kind of texture and pattern contrasting with a pretty, not entirely flat blue. Almost like a pool here, but unsure. Very ambiguous. Cool work, though. And nice texture. Here is Yuri J. A concrete superhouse designed by award winning designers.
00:57:44.380 - 00:58:18.286, Speaker A: So new work here in this incredibly gorgeous pattern in the wall, which is capturing me by Uri Jay, of course, working with musical instruments often. I think this is a one of one. There's a bed, and there seems to be kind of a large window looking off onto a lake and maybe a setting moon. And look at this great kind of wall interior, this very rich interior. 33 tezos, one bid so far from Kobe. Sayso. I mean, only $26.
00:58:18.286 - 00:58:42.220, Speaker A: I mean, there could be like. This is when I start to get interested in collecting, when, like, tazo starts to go down. NFT, market crashing, all of a sudden you go, okay, I don't mind putting a little bit of capital to risk on a few artworks here. $10 here, $10 there. Here's one by RJ. This is from June 6, so we missed this one. Technological obsolescence.
00:58:42.220 - 00:59:05.288, Speaker A: So playing with a few different works here. Kind of has the feeling of a David Hockney portrait, mixing it with some kind of gif like snow. And also a little bit of animation in the figure here. So interesting piece there. And that's an addition of one. And sold for only $21.26 tazos.
00:59:05.288 - 00:59:19.020, Speaker A: So you see good deals. That was a week ago. Good deals to be had. Here's one by Euxine. Personalize your world of generalized. Personalize your world of generalized hysteria. This edition of 2022.
00:59:19.020 - 00:59:44.552, Speaker A: And this sold for 30 tezos, each selling out. Nice work in a tough market. Kind of has a bit of a feeling of the thing from the fantastic four, but not sure on that. Probably a different source. And this knight in jail with a computer and some of these hoses and everything. So interesting piece from oxine. Classic colors.
00:59:44.552 - 01:00:06.802, Speaker A: You almost see like. Almost like a knights of Templar type thing here. Interesting. So 44 tezos on secondary. And we have another one. This is also in the nowhere to run series, the familiar unknown. So again, kind of a looser axcene here, and we see even some interesting outlines, which we don't often see that are lit up.
01:00:06.802 - 01:00:27.548, Speaker A: So continuing to experiment and innovate here. Classic surveillance camera with the arrow through it. Hilarious. The mask over top again, kind of bringing in a little bit more of the metaphysical elements that we see in the early work of Axeen. Kind of tied up here. Always ambiguous. There's always a lot going on in a.
01:00:27.548 - 01:00:40.956, Speaker A: Love the arrows through the surveillance camera. That's brilliant. This was posted on Instagram. I'm not sure if it's an old one by myth or not, or one that's not released. Kind of liked it, though. Just a nice portrait. Beautifully done.
01:00:40.956 - 01:01:04.110, Speaker A: I wish I could magnify more here. But Instagram's a little tricky for that. So classic myth here is rinnefishen. Listen to silence. Let's see if we can get some, get some audio. Nope. Beautiful colors here.
01:01:04.110 - 01:01:26.084, Speaker A: Kind of switching over to, like, green, green and pink. Nice music. Just awesome. So this is. This is on. This is on Zora 19. Minted so far and minted June 13.
01:01:26.084 - 01:01:50.812, Speaker A: So fresh mint there from rinnefish. Keeping it cool. Pinel, Marcello, sawfish and manticore, part of bestiary series. So we have a few of these. So this is a pretty fun one where they're in the sea, kind of almost giving it like an animated, like, as if the animation isn't just for movement but where it actually looks like it's going somewhere. But I think that's just a function of the illusion. Here's another one.
01:01:50.812 - 01:02:06.088, Speaker A: Sawfish and Mandicore, also from the bestiary series. So kind of a. I don't think there's sound. Kind of like a medieval feeling work. Like it seems to be, if I had to guess. Yeah, there you go. Creatures based on medieval bestiaries.
01:02:06.088 - 01:02:20.848, Speaker A: It seems to be inspired by medieval manuscripts. So pretty cool work here. And here's one more. Phoenix Salamanders, also part of this 23 part series. So very cool. Here's two of them. I'm gonna close that.
01:02:20.848 - 01:02:49.520, Speaker A: In case of issues with. In case of issues with the processor and the Ram. Let's continue mumble boy with another hit here. Emo ni chan rad rad artwork here. We saw it on the guitar. So physical, digital kind of nice spray. Looks like a digital kind of airbrush here with a gradient in it, or at least maybe not a gradient, maybe cut off there in terms of the color.
01:02:49.520 - 01:03:13.484, Speaker A: But again, you see all the care that goes into these really big compositions. I mean, it seems like mumble boy can pump these things out. There seems to be a lot of work on it, though. So just, it's amazing how mumble boy can make these very complex works and then sell it for only twelve tezos. I mean, that's $10. So edition of one. And we have a few.
01:03:13.484 - 01:03:35.374, Speaker A: By Nuve 1914. Sabato picking up another 115 tezos. Beautiful musical work here. Playing the cello in nature and with this gorgeous purple sky. Love it. From 1914. Beautiful, kind of metallic, metallic blue gray, light metallic blue frame.
01:03:35.374 - 01:03:56.390, Speaker A: Here's another one. Otonyo. Looks like people having fun in the forest, carrying each other, piggyback. Nice kind of circular radial gradient in the middle. Very fun work. Looks like two women boxing. Boxeo also sabato swooping in.
01:03:56.390 - 01:04:31.064, Speaker A: So more just awesome, awesome work here at a great price from Zuozo boxeo. And one more escondidos. And here you see the teddy bears that we sometimes see in of 19. Fourteen's work in a kind of, with some trees, beautiful pink radial gradient, almost using perhaps the same template here. And also in flowers in the trees, almost looking like koalas or koala bear. Maybe that's what an Escondido is. 13 tezos.
01:04:31.064 - 01:04:55.594, Speaker A: And that was sold on June 10. Here's walk Carmeleon. We saw the. I think it's Woody Woodpecker at the start. And I believe this is part of a Pokemon series. And applying Wok's kind of classic kind of, you know, noise spray kind of technique here. Digital artwork edition of one, three tezos at auction.
01:04:55.594 - 01:05:12.524, Speaker A: You gotta love walks, consistency. And I'm just gonna put it up. I don't care what it sells for to a certain degree. If it goes for more, great. I'm just gonna put it up at one tezos, whatever it goes for. There's something very philosophical. I would argue about how wok approaches pricing.
01:05:12.524 - 01:05:25.684, Speaker A: It's very much. Here it is. Let the Internet decide, right? Same thing on eBay, but it's the same thing. Very cool. Gloom tube. Pool sharks. This came out a few days ago, May 31.
01:05:25.684 - 01:05:42.292, Speaker A: We haven't shown this one. So gloom tube. Experimenting here with a very kind of textured style. Interestingly massive white ball here. Pool shark. So I guess this is like a depth of field thing. Maybe there's a smaller pool ball here underneath.
01:05:42.292 - 01:06:02.748, Speaker A: Not sure, but almost reflecting the head here. Interestingly cool composition. This is. And this was sent to me. I think this was sent to just as a contest to previous owners of one of ones, if I'm not mistaken. Maybe through a lottery of a certain kind. Some crazy theories.
01:06:02.748 - 01:06:30.030, Speaker A: Some kind of crazy theories. So continuing with the alien vibe here, also gloom tube, as you see here, some weeds. And again, playing with perspective. Depth of field, very kind of near and far right. You see the moon. You see this very up close, you see kind of mid ground, foreground background. Interesting compositional experiments from gloom two tentezos edition of 20.
01:06:30.030 - 01:06:44.470, Speaker A: Here is a cool work by Jake Studios. This came out in April. I completely missed this. I was just checking in on Jake and seeing what he was up to. Pretty fun, actually. Of course, object.com, where a lot of these works are posted.
01:06:44.470 - 01:07:12.636, Speaker A: Very cool work and interesting background here. Not exactly sure what's going on here, but kind of looks like something, I guess, part of the textured background. Not exactly sure what's going on, but pretty cool. It looks like a wall is being painted over. And then here you have some kind of fence, a wire mesh fence. Wet, faint edition of 100 for 77 Tazosense. Here's a.
01:07:12.636 - 01:07:38.244, Speaker A: I believe Suizoichi it is. And I follow Suizoichi. That is a glitch would go really well with our opener Murakit, wouldn't it? I mean, those guys could do a show together. Beautiful. And you see some combination of noise with the pixel art, with what looks like would be traditionally an illustration. So just cool mix of stuff here. Super original.
01:07:38.244 - 01:08:02.464, Speaker A: Even the yellow, the application of the yellow here. Just very interesting work. Here's a new artist I haven't seen before. They may not be new, but an artist I just found on Instagram, drain cane, after the storm emerged a scourge. And I just thought it was quite interesting. You see paint here and you see pixelation here. And just fusing the two seems to work, doesn't it? So just interesting work.
01:08:02.464 - 01:08:18.304, Speaker A: Seems like maybe climbing a mountain or something. A couple of figures here. Interesting piece. And let's continue here as we wrap up. This is pixelare. $102,000. Not exactly sure what this is.
01:08:18.304 - 01:08:36.664, Speaker A: Design stupidity. Sofa. So maybe it's a sofa. Just super pixelated. And again, doing this kind of animation without animation. Like movement, but not animation. Right? Dynamism, but not exactly trying to show a narrative.
01:08:36.664 - 01:08:50.850, Speaker A: Animated narrative. One of one there. And what is that? That probably sold. Sold for 26 tezos. Nice sale. Here is Anis Abdin with a beautiful nature work. And here you see it.
01:08:50.850 - 01:09:08.338, Speaker A: Beautiful sunset, obviously. Or almost always doing nature as his subject. Continuing on, Francois Gammer. It was a work I'd never seen before. A style or a concept I'd never seen before by Francoise Gammer. Some big pixels here. Beautiful color.
01:09:08.338 - 01:09:31.338, Speaker A: And then you have this walking figure, which is a theme that francoise gammer often uses. And then repeated the whole kind of spectrum of greys, interestingly. And here's another one. I think I discovered this in hastrubal waffles x profile to retweet. Nice, nice find. Contortion zero, two. A different take here.
01:09:31.338 - 01:09:45.328, Speaker A: Edition of 30 for two tazos. And ahec, picking up one. Here is braindead doing Keith Haring, dancing dog. So a cool tribute to Keith Haringen. Pause and dance. Pause. Dance.
01:09:45.328 - 01:09:59.448, Speaker A: Almost like a video game. Nice dithering and everything. Cool, warm grays edition of eight. And this is an open edition for one tazos. So you can pick up it up. Pick it up for a dollar. And here is green ginger midnight star wishes.
01:09:59.448 - 01:10:25.530, Speaker A: Cool title and edition of 20. Unleash your wish beneath the whispering stars. So cool again. Whenever I see these like minimally colored pixel artworks, you go, oh, that could go on bitcoin 18 kb, but that's probably after it's been made larger. So this thing's probably only like 4 kb, maybe less. So you can mint that these days. Maybe $20 if I had to guess.
01:10:25.530 - 01:10:51.458, Speaker A: Let's continue. Silver san two's annihilation and so silva sand two's pushing the Nintendo glitch roms here with the spaceships going one way in the background, seemingly going at a different rate in the opposite direction. Addition of four for one tezos each. And here's another one. Invasion. Very cool work here. And kind of looks like the same horse, but you can't tell.
01:10:51.458 - 01:11:14.212, Speaker A: And just another cool glitrom. This is an open edition as well, taking almost a similar attack to walk. Just put it out of Tezos open edition. Whatever sells, sells interesting. Here's RJ again with a super minimal work that was just minted green. A so interesting piece. At first I thought maybe this is even a soccer work with the Euro Cup.
01:11:14.212 - 01:11:28.034, Speaker A: I think that starts today. The euro cup starts. It may even be on right now. I'm gonna have to check that. So anyways, kind of has a bit of a soccer feel. I have no idea though. And this is an addition of five for only two tezos each.
01:11:28.034 - 01:11:54.228, Speaker A: And a cool work here. Another car by Lorna Mills. And as you can see here, kind of funny, just kind of spinning the wheels and letting the burning rubber here. And a nice dark blue, dark blue mask with his classic car here. Cool work. Posted by Lorna Mills and here is John Cates Glitch western Wednesday y'all. New art soon on tezos with fake whale.
01:11:54.228 - 01:12:26.508, Speaker A: I also need to post. I need to post to work to fake whale. So hopefully I joined the party there. And just cool glitches from the western glitch artist glitch western artist John cates who was on our spaces and that was super interesting as well. Out of Taipei, Taiwan, here's Dylan. This is a digital drawing, interestingly that looks like a woodcut, so would work fabulously as a woodcut. So just very interesting piece here from Dylan.
01:12:26.508 - 01:12:50.220, Speaker A: A nice kind of minimal black and white and really nice texture. Addition of one for five tazos. And here's Sanro Howdy from 2022. So just a big head texturized here. And again kind of almost like a basque type head here, but done in its own way. And beautiful kind of textures here. Cowboy hat and who knows what.
01:12:50.220 - 01:13:09.520, Speaker A: Cool work. Here's Inivari. The tide is calm. I think at least one of these axe people holding axes on the sea. I feel like I've seen different colors of this. And so interesting combination. We were seeing this in the X mortal, where there's movement in this looping video.
01:13:09.520 - 01:13:29.460, Speaker A: And the X mortal is with the waves here. We're seeing it with the dress, but then there's the looping of the tech, right, that's looped on top, which is its own kind of loop. So interesting piece. Beautiful texture, beautiful colors. Love the pink and orange. And this really cool kind of boat in the background. Ambiguous work.
01:13:29.460 - 01:13:49.880, Speaker A: I get wild. Available on our Zora. So cool walking figure here with some cats walking in different directions or jumping different directions. Interesting colors. And here is Kiro protest. And let's take a look here. So beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.
01:13:49.880 - 01:14:05.898, Speaker A: Kind of has a bit more of a mechanical feel to it. Nice colors and everything. This is on foundation. This is on base. You can place a bid for 0.011. Continuing on, continuum number 200, kota Nakazono. And Klaus.
01:14:05.898 - 01:14:52.626, Speaker A: You know what I'm kind of back to. I think of Roontoon's comment again. Like, put it this way. I would, you know, roon tune talking about, like, what difference does it make what chain? But then I'd say, well, maybe you want to mint your work on, uh. On, uh, Matic, right, on Polygon. Why don't you work mint your work on Polygon? Well, you could argue the network effects on tezos and whatever, but I guess at the end of the day, the blockchain matters is actually another way of kind of attacking that discussion. I would argue the blockchain matters, right? And each blockchain has its own qualities, which actually, weirdly affects the art, I would argue, at least in my case, it's like, okay, I got to make small files.
01:14:52.626 - 01:15:04.922, Speaker A: What does that mean? Okay, pixel art, right? For bitcoin. Let's continue. Koda nakazono. We're already at hour 15. I want to speed up here. Koda nakazono with another work here. Another beautiful work.
01:15:04.922 - 01:15:18.746, Speaker A: Fortunately, I can't zoom in here, but looking beautiful. Continuum number 200. So big. Congrats to Koda Nakazono. Klaus picking that one up at 50 tezos. So, joining the 200 club, here's another one. Yama.
01:15:18.746 - 01:15:40.900, Speaker A: This is Renki. Yamato Futami. Always keeping it new and different here. Always progressing with the experimentation. Here's another one by Renki, this time on object, and again, just posting it but not listing it. So interesting piece here. Animated abstract, continuing on.
01:15:40.900 - 01:16:12.220, Speaker A: Look at this gorgeous work by Sky Goodman. It kind of has the feeling of shopping, which I'm a huge fan of, and I just love this work. It also gives a sense of, like, a Pinterest or a Google image results, which I also like. Very, very. I love this kind of structure here. Super interesting. And even, like, these brushstrokes that you see here in the back, I mean, it really holds up too, when you zoom in.
01:16:12.220 - 01:16:36.722, Speaker A: I have to say, like, you know, like, this is pretty awesome. I think, actually, sky, I believe, is on the spaces this Wednesday, so we can ask sky directly about this edition of ten, and I believe, sold out at five tezos each. Nice work. Sky Goodman Sabato, trippie collector art. Monochrome and more line extension. Very cool work. This is a wild kind of Kanak Zapata work, riding the wave.
01:16:36.722 - 01:16:52.706, Speaker A: An old meme text is a screenshot of a text of a McKinsey wark. Paint as a draft is a doctor alt paint. Kirby is Kirby. So Kirby, I think, is a character. And then you have this kind of conceptual thing. What might be more interesting is to consider how the very. So.
01:16:52.706 - 01:17:35.042, Speaker A: And then there's maybe some kind of definition of digital objects, which is a whole other thing. Yeah, which is a whole other discussion. The digital matter theory, which I'm seeing on bitcoin. I think it's kind of like in a world where what do you rely on? What's resilient? Using, again, the blockchain data as a foundation to build on the, I think is a really interesting way of applying, of just kind of building again, I'd say an incredible way in the digital world. But before I get too abstract here, let's finish this show. No hygiene. With some experimental work on Zora.
01:17:35.042 - 01:18:01.440, Speaker A: More wild AI playing almost with the selection AI version of the magic wand, seemingly. And this wild, wild work here, figure free mint on Zora. Zach Krevet from Zora, picking one up. Look at this. Beautiful, beautiful work by Tuks. This is stunningly gorgeous. I mean, amazing AI.
01:18:01.440 - 01:18:23.624, Speaker A: So, yeah, some more. Just beautiful, beautiful work by tuks. AI artists coming out of glitch. So didn't start with AI, which maybe helps tooks escapes. And here, this is part of a huge series, a gorgeous, gorgeous series. This is on verseworks from tooks. So all sorts again.
01:18:23.624 - 01:18:54.098, Speaker A: When you just look at the art, it's super bullish here. And I think that's where we got a focus, you know, thinking of Artie hands there earlier in the show and everything. Like, I think you just have to focus on the art and kind of that's where it starts and ends. Santiago, with some beautiful additions to this AI art series. Here's one, here's another. This one is on object us at work edition of 15, so. And here's another one.
01:18:54.098 - 01:19:11.010, Speaker A: Magical protection gnome, little cake zones. This looks pretty spectacular, you know, and we haven't even zoomed in. I hesitate to do it because these files are so huge, but I can't resist. Just beautiful. I mean, look at that. Amazing. Nothing like it.
01:19:11.010 - 01:19:36.536, Speaker A: And some really interesting works here. Speaking of cryptopunks, which we saw earlier in the show, Mikey de la creme, doing this AI variation on it, getting these incredible textures. So it's really hard to dismiss AI when you see these kind of textures, these kind of remixes. This stuff's gorgeous. Just stunningly gorgeous. Even have a little underpainting there. Beautiful, beautiful textures here.
01:19:36.536 - 01:19:54.856, Speaker A: So AI continues to dazzle, and this is kind of funny. This looks like. I think this is die. I got this toad whisback or die with the most likes AI Grail for $325, edition of five. So I didn't realize that die with the most likes did AI. So joining the AI party here. It's hilarious.
01:19:54.856 - 01:20:27.640, Speaker A: It kind of looks like old works, you know, combined and mixed with a whole bunch of AI distortion. And here is some physical, another physical from die with most legs. These are gorgeous. These beautiful watercolors with pen and ink serve the customer. Maybe a customer's head in a microwave wrote, so sending these out to people, just very cool. Here's Moto Motohiro. Just more beautiful, original, surreal drawings here.
01:20:27.640 - 01:20:41.028, Speaker A: Here's a painting. See if we can get a closer look here. I think it's a painting. It looks like it. Definitely. Yes. Just super interesting artists, from what I've seen, what we've looked at, these aren't huge.
01:20:41.028 - 01:21:13.070, Speaker A: These works, like, they're kind of like, you know, like, they're not huge. You can easily kind of buy and sell them, put them on the wall, you know? Again, if I was an art consultant, I'd be like, you might want to find out how much these are, because maybe they're only a few hundred bucks, and they look great. Continuing on to another interesting meme artist here that I'd never heard of. Cara Benedetto with the night gallery. Kind of a well known gallery, I believe, out of LA. And, yeah, so here is the meme I love. Drunk me, but I don't trust her.
01:21:13.070 - 01:21:42.628, Speaker A: And. Yeah, so just really nicely painted. A good solution, you know, for kind of having it looks like acrylic if you just do it straight up. Acrylic is this acrylic, aluminum gouache, oil pastel, prismacolor, and sharpie. But adding this kind of Sharpie kind of adds. I kind of was doing stuff like this, frankly, about seven years ago. Not, obviously, not exactly like this, but when I see this, I see, oh, yeah, I know that solution because you're trying to make it different from just straight up.
01:21:42.628 - 01:22:13.530, Speaker A: You're trying to add some kind of brush work to it, some life. So it becomes a bit of a design solution using the Sharpie here or these acrylic, what look like acrylic markers. So interesting piece there. Also Joachim, official Miles Davis Quintet, and kind of like record posters or record album covers or music posters. Very beautiful work there. And here's bondozo Bandito with some more, just incredibly original compositions. Trying to all sort ducktales.
01:22:13.530 - 01:22:27.184, Speaker A: Here's Ben Steyer pages. So a pretty good looking notebook, if you ask me. Kind of a new discovery for me. Ben Steyer on Instagram. Huge amount of followers, if I remember right. 57,000. Yeah.
01:22:27.184 - 01:22:49.472, Speaker A: So pretty popular. One of these Instagram kind of artists, you almost want to call them Donny O'Donnell. So we've looked at Donny O'Donnell before. A new work here of a dog. Get in touch if you'd like to commission a painting or your pet. So there's a ton of good art out there, you know, again, art Basel is happening right now, but I think the deals are still, you know, on tazos and on Instagram. Jerry Meyer.
01:22:49.472 - 01:23:12.574, Speaker A: This is a super cool artist. Like you see here. It's like a lo fi jpeg and then painting it all out. Does it say, I assume this is like an acrylic painting? Here's another take on it, right? Crocodiles. Right. So I think a pretty, pretty cool artist here. And see if we can find maybe just one more here.
01:23:12.574 - 01:23:36.602, Speaker A: You see a polar bear. So playing with that kind of jpeg artifacts or, you know, pixelation. When you zoom in, you see it really nice in the shark there. Very cool. And logee, it's official. Harabelles in a package of sugar free Smurf pastilla. So textile artist, you could argue with some pop culture imagery, some nature, not worrying about filling in the background.
01:23:36.602 - 01:23:48.762, Speaker A: It's perfect. Absolutely beautiful. Here's another variation. And then doing all these variations. I mean, just, there's a ton of great art out there. As you can see, you do not need to spend a lot of money. And walk once again.
01:23:48.762 - 01:24:06.194, Speaker A: God, look at the virtuosity in walk's application of spray paint. Here. A total virtuoso collected by axin. The guy with the eye. That is your show. My friends, thank you for joining me, and I will get back when I can. Otherwise, I'll see you on next Wednesday.
01:24:06.194 - 01:24:10.100, Speaker A: I believe Skye Goodman is the guesthouse. Until next time. Take care.
