00:00:08.920 - 00:00:57.334, Speaker A: When I think of crossover between the digital art space on the blockchain and art in the museums, I usually think first of the work of Sabato. When I was at the Altapinacotec in Munich, I couldn't stop imagining his work on the wall in front of me in large scale. Today we're welcoming Sabato to join us to share his latest thoughts on digital art, glitch and technology. Artist Journal, June 7, 2023. Broadcasting live from Berlin and New York City on Rugradio via Twitter spaces. My name is Adrian Pokebelli, and we welcome back co host, artist and conversationalist to the show rune tune. How is your week going?
00:00:58.994 - 00:01:05.266, Speaker B: Busy as ever. Glad to be here. I see Sabato, Sky Goodman.
00:01:05.410 - 00:01:07.094, Speaker C: I see a lot of good faces.
00:01:07.434 - 00:01:09.322, Speaker B: This is going to be a good space.
00:01:09.378 - 00:01:33.934, Speaker A: Well, I'm sure Sabato is going to attract a wonderful crowd and. Yeah. So I am just absolutely thrilled. And I know what you mean about being busy. It's like the slight little pangs of terror are starting to sink in of all on the apartment search here. But I do have leads, so I am starting to feel a little bit more better about it. How about yourself? How was your week going, Richard?
00:01:35.514 - 00:01:38.974, Speaker B: Oh, it's going good. Got together with a friend.
00:01:39.594 - 00:01:40.242, Speaker C: Yeah, it's.
00:01:40.298 - 00:01:48.266, Speaker B: My dad visited over the weekend, so I got to hang out with him, show him around New York a little bit. Drank a ton of wine on Monday.
00:01:48.450 - 00:01:50.454, Speaker C: That was fun. Or not Monday.
00:01:51.614 - 00:01:55.314, Speaker A: It sounds like a ton of wine. Red or white?
00:01:57.054 - 00:01:57.794, Speaker B: Both.
00:01:58.934 - 00:02:02.194, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, I see. That sounds very fun. Do you have a preference?
00:02:04.054 - 00:02:06.902, Speaker B: Oh, no, I like it all. I mean, I work in wine, so.
00:02:07.078 - 00:02:11.174, Speaker C: I'm someone who's around it, you know, seven days away.
00:02:11.214 - 00:02:15.754, Speaker A: Wow. And so do you have a favorite red that you particularly like?
00:02:17.314 - 00:02:35.214, Speaker B: I wouldn't say I have a favorite. I like exploring, you know, everything. But what I had the other night was really fantastic. I was with a friend who's a sommelier at this place called one White street. It's cool. A restaurant in Manhattan. It operates out of what used to be the town home for John Lennon.
00:02:35.214 - 00:03:02.208, Speaker B: So there's, like, a little interesting story there. But, yeah, he was the one picking out the wines, and I let him, and he picked out very well. He got this. This pinot noir from Burgundy, from the cote de bon by this producer called Deroy Gentil. And I'd never had this producer before, but it was just fantastic. It's just one of those really soft, ethereal reds that just kind of, like, goes down, like some sort of spirit or ghost.
00:03:02.336 - 00:03:32.490, Speaker A: You know, you describe the pinot noir perfectly. I call it kind of silky smooth, and it is my favorite, actually, if. Now that we're discussing it, and I am not a wine expert, but I know I love the pinot noir. It is just such a. Like you say, it's just like a ghost that enters your system. Anyway, I feel like I have an idea for a show, which is runetune as special guest, and we discuss wine. But today, let's talk to Sabato.
00:03:32.490 - 00:03:40.094, Speaker A: Let's welcome Sabato. Sabato, I'm so pleased you came on and are willing to do this. I'm thrilled to talk to you. How are you doing?
00:03:40.994 - 00:03:41.466, Speaker C: Hey.
00:03:41.530 - 00:03:50.214, Speaker D: Hey, poco. Hey, Ruhn. Good to be with you all. It's a lovely day here in western mass. I'm doing all right.
00:03:51.034 - 00:03:55.214, Speaker A: Excellent. And so the weather is better out in.
00:03:55.914 - 00:03:56.562, Speaker C: It's nice.
00:03:56.618 - 00:04:10.166, Speaker D: You know, actually, yesterday we had a weird day because of the wildfire smoke that's coming in from British Columbia. So, like, yesterday, I walked outside. It was, like, nine or 10:00 a.m. And there was this, like, orange glow.
00:04:10.230 - 00:04:13.230, Speaker C: Like, cast on, like, the place I.
00:04:13.262 - 00:04:26.714, Speaker D: Live and, like, the driveway and, like, the trees. And I was like, what's going on? And then I realized that the sky was, like, super hazy. So it was kind of a weird day yesterday, but today seems like it cleared up a bit. Doesn't smell like smoke, and the weather's lovely.
00:04:27.294 - 00:04:41.570, Speaker A: That is incredible that it reaches that far. I mean, my mom was mentioning it. She's in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, so, you know, it's not uncommon for there to be forest fires that kind of make their way over there, but all the way to Massachusetts.
00:04:41.722 - 00:04:45.674, Speaker D: And I heard ruined in New York got hit by the smoke yesterday.
00:04:45.834 - 00:04:46.826, Speaker C: Oh, it's horrible.
00:04:46.930 - 00:04:47.826, Speaker A: It's horrible.
00:04:47.930 - 00:04:48.194, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:04:48.234 - 00:04:51.794, Speaker B: I can't be outside for more than ten minutes without my eyes getting a little sore.
00:04:51.914 - 00:04:56.330, Speaker D: Yeah, yesterday was weird. Like, it smelled like smoke. Like, it was like, there's a giant.
00:04:56.362 - 00:04:59.786, Speaker C: Campfire, except the campfire was Canada. You know?
00:04:59.810 - 00:05:03.104, Speaker D: It was like, yeah, totally.
00:05:03.144 - 00:05:04.504, Speaker A: Canada is on fire.
00:05:04.664 - 00:05:09.008, Speaker D: I was like, I don't want to stay outside too much, but. But I'm glad that today is, because I'm outside right now.
00:05:09.056 - 00:05:11.584, Speaker C: I was like, it's so beautiful.
00:05:11.624 - 00:05:12.968, Speaker D: Like, I kind of want to, you.
00:05:12.976 - 00:05:15.432, Speaker C: Know, have this talk outside where, you.
00:05:15.448 - 00:05:18.284, Speaker D: Know, I can talk loudly without waking anyone up and stuff, so.
00:05:18.584 - 00:05:21.924, Speaker A: Well, yeah. And it's early in the morning where you are, I suppose.
00:05:22.264 - 00:05:25.952, Speaker C: Yeah. It's not too early, but good it's.
00:05:25.968 - 00:05:31.134, Speaker D: Kind of like the end of the school year. So I think, like, my family is kind of, like, being lazy and staying in a lot. So.
00:05:32.634 - 00:05:40.774, Speaker A: Very good. And, you know, one of the benefits of the. Of the forest fires, if there is one, is the sunsets can be gorgeous.
00:05:42.434 - 00:05:48.402, Speaker D: I believe that I should. I'll keep an eye out tonight. I didn't look at yesterday just because it smelled so weird. How?
00:05:48.538 - 00:05:52.578, Speaker A: Well, the sun right now is like.
00:05:52.746 - 00:05:58.144, Speaker B: It looks like it's supposed to be evening here. Like it's a sun setting, but it's just the sun up in the sky.
00:05:58.184 - 00:06:00.088, Speaker A: I can see. It's incredible.
00:06:00.216 - 00:06:01.456, Speaker D: New York is still kind of in the.
00:06:01.480 - 00:06:04.764, Speaker C: In the thick of it. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
00:06:05.424 - 00:06:15.912, Speaker A: It is spanning the continent. Well, Sabato, enough of the pleasantries. I want to ask you, how is the super rare application going?
00:06:16.088 - 00:06:22.710, Speaker D: Oh, I'm not a. You know, it's funny because I think I just like talking shit more than I like applying.
00:06:22.742 - 00:06:24.214, Speaker C: A super rare. Yeah.
00:06:24.334 - 00:06:44.038, Speaker D: Yeah. Personally, I have beef with the video application. I think. I don't think anyone should be making a video to apply for Mark for, like, that kind of platform. Like, here in the US, there's, like, the American against Disabilities act, like, forbids, like, this kind of thing if you're applying for a job, unless it's, like.
00:06:44.046 - 00:06:47.564, Speaker C: An acting job, because it.
00:06:47.654 - 00:06:55.112, Speaker D: To me, it's, like, a vector for discrimination. So I just kind of against it, and I'll happily join super rare if someone invites me.
00:06:55.288 - 00:06:57.204, Speaker C: But I'm not filling out an application.
00:06:58.224 - 00:07:03.844, Speaker B: I didn't realize that the video application, the video acceptance thing was a requirement.
00:07:04.944 - 00:07:06.592, Speaker D: You know, maybe it is, but everyone.
00:07:06.648 - 00:07:07.844, Speaker C: Says they made one.
00:07:08.504 - 00:07:43.734, Speaker A: I remember going through the process, and I have to say that that is why I delayed forever more, just out of self consciousness at the time, because I had spent no time on video at that point, and I was just. I felt kind of weird about it, you know? And maybe, like, on a deeper level, I did kind of have a sense of, like, this sense of, like, what is this visual thing about? Like, I think. I mean, to be charitable, I suppose they're thinking this is a way of just kind of getting to know who this is. But it is kind of weird because there's so many anonymous accounts out there, too.
00:07:44.674 - 00:07:45.250, Speaker D: So.
00:07:45.362 - 00:07:47.146, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm surprised to hear that they.
00:07:47.170 - 00:07:48.654, Speaker C: Still have it, actually.
00:07:49.634 - 00:08:07.404, Speaker D: Yeah. I don't know. And it's funny because of friends who applied and sent in videos, I know some Fei made a crazy video and then had to wait a long time to hear back and Lorna Mills made a funny video, and then they never got back to her for, like, a year, at least a year.
00:08:08.304 - 00:08:08.952, Speaker C: So I don't know.
00:08:08.968 - 00:08:10.752, Speaker D: The whole, like, that whole process to.
00:08:10.768 - 00:08:12.200, Speaker C: Me just seems kind of.
00:08:12.392 - 00:08:13.564, Speaker D: Kind of iffy.
00:08:14.824 - 00:09:04.294, Speaker A: Well, it's a black box, right? It's a black box, you know? And so it always just kind of raises, like, who's deciding all this and everything? I mean, I have to say, like, it was thrilling to get in when I was so, like, early on, and I kind of was just sort of. I'd been making digital art for years, and I'd known about it for a couple of years, actually. I knew super rare about super rare, at least in 2019. I don't know when they started. And that was the biggest obstacle. I was like, oh, I mean, maybe on a certain level, I was like, oh, they'll never accept my art, blah, blah, blah. But I was also like, the video was the, like, I still would have applied, but the video really was what delayed it for two years, and then it was the bull market in 2021 that really just, I was like, okay, the world's going to start banging on the door here, so I better get in while I can.
00:09:04.594 - 00:09:05.546, Speaker C: I mean, that's smart.
00:09:05.610 - 00:09:09.734, Speaker D: And, you know, you have a good video presence. You know, you do your journals and stuff, so.
00:09:10.514 - 00:09:32.356, Speaker A: Well, thank you. I mean, it took. Yeah, maybe if you look, I looked at one of the earlier episodes. I can't watch any of them, basically, but I looked once earlier, like about a month ago, I looked at an early episode, and it's much more muted, and it's almost like it's kind of funny. Like, it does evolve over time. That whole, you know, quote unquote presence. You have a great presence, too.
00:09:32.356 - 00:09:36.824, Speaker A: Sobato. Well, thank you. As Runetun has sort of pointed out there.
00:09:37.964 - 00:09:39.744, Speaker D: So I appreciate it.
00:09:40.124 - 00:09:58.680, Speaker A: So to get us going here and welcome everybody who showed up again, I mean, it's just like an all star cast here. Santiago Sky, Goodman Mech TXT, Mikey Delacreme, Sean Luke. I mean, Ilya. It's like Doctor version. Lily illo and on and on. Haiti, Rockette. I mean, it's an all star cast.
00:09:58.680 - 00:10:25.264, Speaker A: So give us an update. Sabato. Like, I mean, I think the last time we had a kind of in depth discussion on here was maybe in February where, like, I still, you know, I think Rune Tuden might echo this. I learned a ton from what you were saying about glitch. Like, it really did help illuminate. So give us an update on what you've been up to. I think you've, to me, like, from over here, it seems like you've had a pretty wild three or four months.
00:10:25.764 - 00:10:26.948, Speaker C: Is that fair?
00:10:27.116 - 00:10:28.052, Speaker D: It's fair to say.
00:10:28.108 - 00:10:38.220, Speaker C: It's been, like, crazy busy. I think around, like, in the march, early April, like, I got, like, a big moment of crunch where it was.
00:10:38.252 - 00:10:42.732, Speaker D: Like, the first time in my life as an artist where I had, like, multiple things kind of do at the.
00:10:42.748 - 00:10:44.544, Speaker C: Same time, and I had to, like.
00:10:44.844 - 00:10:50.596, Speaker D: Stay up all night for, like, a week to get things done. So that was, I mean, it's kind.
00:10:50.620 - 00:10:57.116, Speaker C: Of cool, like, to just have that much work going. So I was, like, you know, just.
00:10:57.140 - 00:11:44.764, Speaker D: Trying to embrace it and do my best. And then the past, like, three weeks, like, it's been, like, the opposite, because I think the market's been kind of a lot quieter than usual. So I've been, like, doing IRL gigs mostly photographing and doing video for, like, college commencements, graduations, and reunions and stuff. So it's been a lot of running around. And now what's going on now? I just started as artists in residence with this organization called Wild XYZ, and they do a, they focus on experiential art. And so I'm doing. I'm part of, like, a ten week kind of, like, online residency program.
00:11:46.704 - 00:11:47.064, Speaker C: Where.
00:11:47.104 - 00:12:09.826, Speaker D: At the end of it, I'll make some kind of, like, interactive experiential, like, virtual sort of art piece. I'm not sure yet what it'll be yet, but I have ideas in my. In my head, and there's, like, a lot of, like, really cool people working with that organization that can help in terms of, like, you know, putting together, like, a world in unreal engine and.
00:12:09.850 - 00:12:15.266, Speaker C: Kind of, like, helping design the interactivity and kind of, like, the game ness.
00:12:15.330 - 00:12:42.504, Speaker D: Or the, you know, however the project is going to be. So I'm really excited about that. There's some, like, amazing artists also in the cohort. One of them is here, Sky Goodman. I'm really excited that we were, like, in this together. And there's a few other friends, like Riddell Warner's in it, Violet Forest, and others. I'm really excited to see what we all create.
00:12:42.504 - 00:12:57.864, Speaker D: And it just started, so I think this is the first time I'm talking about it. But as the weeks go on, and I think as people's projects start to coalesce, I think you'll see a lot more of these kind of wild XYZ projects pop up in the space.
00:12:58.024 - 00:13:00.204, Speaker A: Well, go ahead.
00:13:01.592 - 00:13:01.732, Speaker C: I.
00:13:01.780 - 00:13:08.708, Speaker B: And maybe you said this already. But for this residency, for this wild XYZ, I'm assuming there's a. It culminates in a show.
00:13:08.756 - 00:13:11.260, Speaker C: And when. When is.
00:13:11.332 - 00:13:14.824, Speaker B: When is it going to be over or when. When do you have a show?
00:13:15.244 - 00:13:21.476, Speaker D: So it ends in. I think it ends in September. Like, end of September is when the sessions end.
00:13:21.620 - 00:13:23.436, Speaker B: That's a really long residency.
00:13:23.620 - 00:13:33.120, Speaker D: Yeah, it's, I mean, it's online, so it's kind of like once a week, you know, people join together. There's like a session. Um, and it's like every week there's like an expert.
00:13:33.192 - 00:13:36.928, Speaker C: Like, uh, um, this week we, we.
00:13:36.976 - 00:13:40.200, Speaker D: Talked to Wade Wallerstein and Sirwa.
00:13:40.232 - 00:13:43.456, Speaker C: I can't remember her last name, but.
00:13:43.480 - 00:13:49.124, Speaker D: She does like incredible, like afrofuturistic 3D Art. She's based out of Australia.
00:13:51.984 - 00:13:55.652, Speaker C: But yeah, so it's like, it's, it's exciting. And I don't think there's going to.
00:13:55.668 - 00:13:58.740, Speaker D: Be like a physical exhibition, like in a traditional sense.
00:13:58.772 - 00:14:00.068, Speaker C: I think there's going to be a.
00:14:00.076 - 00:14:01.508, Speaker D: Lot of artists projects who are going.
00:14:01.516 - 00:14:05.172, Speaker C: To drop and I feel like these drops are probably going to be their.
00:14:05.188 - 00:14:10.464, Speaker D: Own thing because they tend to be pretty kind of like big immersive sort of experiences.
00:14:12.564 - 00:14:21.644, Speaker B: Is it, do you think a lot of the artists, are these projects dropping in the form of nfts or, you know, that marketplace or is it some.
00:14:21.804 - 00:14:50.044, Speaker D: Okay, it'll be all like Ethereum based. I think wild has their own sort of platform to sell, but everything is like tied to. It's tied up, you know, to Ethereum or opensea. So it's like, it's still, like accessible, but from what I saw, previous projects, they would be like, you know, like they have their own website, their own thing. A lot of them, like, require kind of like going into like a virtual space to, as part of the project.
00:14:50.744 - 00:15:19.194, Speaker A: So just out of curiosity then. So this is a residence. And do you have a lot of experience doing residences? Like, I only learned recently, like, you know, two years ago, that that is actually how you make your way up in the contemporary art world. If you're kind of starting out is you actually go to residencies and then, you know, curate, you have a little show and then curators get to know you and gradually you kind of work your way into the museums is actually how it works. So do you have a history with us?
00:15:20.214 - 00:15:24.094, Speaker D: No, actually this is my first artist in residency, so I'm, like, really excited.
00:15:24.174 - 00:15:25.966, Speaker C: About being able to put something like.
00:15:25.990 - 00:15:27.154, Speaker D: That on my cv.
00:15:27.814 - 00:15:44.848, Speaker A: I can imagine. I don't think I've ever done one myself and I only started applying. I think I put in two applications and usually there's so much work to put, like it's a full day of your life, at least to put in some application for a residency. So that's also.
00:15:45.016 - 00:15:51.224, Speaker D: Yeah, and a lot of them ask for letters of recommendation and, like, it feels almost like applying to a college. Like it's.
00:15:51.264 - 00:15:52.048, Speaker A: It's hardcore.
00:15:52.136 - 00:15:52.920, Speaker B: 100%.
00:15:52.992 - 00:15:54.056, Speaker D: Yeah, it's hardcore.
00:15:54.120 - 00:15:54.368, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:15:54.416 - 00:16:17.504, Speaker A: Like I was. And once you, like, once you start to understand that that's how the system works and feel free to disagree if anybody thinks otherwise, but then you start to understand, like, oh, okay. Like, yeah, especially the good residencies. Like, like you say, it's like applying for a job or college. Like, it's kind of serious business because if you get in, it's kind of like social proof on steroids in some of these residences.
00:16:18.484 - 00:16:20.484, Speaker C: That's how I've always understood it.
00:16:20.604 - 00:16:34.464, Speaker B: And especially if you wanted, if you ever had your eye on specific galleries, like, they're probably not going to take you seriously unless they see on your resume you've got a few residencies under your. Under your, you know, on your experience.
00:16:35.994 - 00:16:49.214, Speaker A: Is that a surprise for you, Sabato? Or, like, is this something that you knew or is this something. Because it seems to me like you've been an artist for quite a while. So, like, did you understand that that, or at least have an idea that maybe that's how things worked?
00:16:50.794 - 00:17:26.490, Speaker D: You know, I did just from what friends have told me. And I've, you know, had friends, like, list, but like the three or four residency in like, the northeast us that are, like, relevant. But I think for me it's like, as a digital artist and especially one as, like, I tend not to. I haven't had that much history making, like, site specific sort of digital art for institutions. And I feel like if you don't have that kind of practice, it's really hard to land a residency because there's still, you know, there's very much that traditional art mindset. And I think when digital art comes.
00:17:26.522 - 00:17:28.884, Speaker C: Into play, like, they will think.
00:17:29.044 - 00:17:58.024, Speaker D: They usually think like, oh, you know, digital art has to have, like, a very physical, very site specific component for it to be successful. And I think this idea of, like, digital artists where we can, you know, just go and just kind of do our own thing in, like, digital environments is kind of like a new aspect of residencies in and of themselves. Like, in the past, like five years, I started seeing more like, online residencies, like, or like, you know, where people, like, let you, like, take over, like an Instagram page or like a Twitter.
00:17:58.064 - 00:18:00.280, Speaker C: And it's like, you know, you're, you're.
00:18:00.312 - 00:18:08.296, Speaker D: Right, you're, it's your resident quote unquote residency, and then you, you know, can post whatever you want and share a project, that kind of thing. I've been seeing more of these kind.
00:18:08.320 - 00:18:11.352, Speaker C: Of, like, proliferate, but I haven't, you.
00:18:11.368 - 00:18:27.170, Speaker D: Know, I haven't applied to many, and so this is the first one. I'm just kind of happy. Like, it does sound like I, you know, from, from, from what I see, it sounds like if you are a wild XYz residence, it's the kind of thing where, like, you do a project, then you come back and you teach.
00:18:27.202 - 00:18:29.402, Speaker C: A session next season.
00:18:29.458 - 00:18:38.294, Speaker D: They have, or you help with something. So they have. It's true. There is that kind of, like, you know, you've been a part of this program, and now you can come back, you can help, you can contribute.
00:18:39.674 - 00:18:40.962, Speaker C: So I definitely feel that, and I.
00:18:40.978 - 00:18:47.598, Speaker D: Hope that, you know, that that's something that helps me grow my career and, and meet people and network and all that goodness.
00:18:47.686 - 00:19:20.946, Speaker A: I'm sure it will. And I think it's really interesting what you say almost about digital art. Like, it's almost like, like I was thinking about Guido's style when you said that, because she'll have, she's, you know, very prominent contemporary artist based out of Berlin, actually. I think she works at the oude cas or the, I think that's the academy of art or whatever it is over here. And I saw her work in Munich when I was there. And it's not just like a tv. It's like, you know, sandbags are like the couch.
00:19:20.946 - 00:19:25.010, Speaker A: It's like a whole installation. And I almost feel like, you know.
00:19:25.042 - 00:19:28.210, Speaker C: To your point, it's almost like the.
00:19:28.402 - 00:19:43.758, Speaker A: Institutions, if you're not thinking about how it's going to work in the physical world, maybe it's, you know, it's not really taken as seriously in some quarters. I mean, just, I mean, I'm just speculating out loud here as I spill my coffee.
00:19:43.806 - 00:19:45.394, Speaker C: But do you have any thoughts about that?
00:19:46.974 - 00:19:50.518, Speaker D: No, I think that's very true. And the stuff that I have applied.
00:19:50.566 - 00:19:53.874, Speaker C: In the past, like, I've applied to, what's it called?
00:19:55.014 - 00:20:01.114, Speaker D: I'm gonna fuck up the names real bad. But it's the solitude. Was it FKN solitude?
00:20:02.454 - 00:20:03.694, Speaker C: They're out there in Germany.
00:20:03.734 - 00:20:08.896, Speaker D: Like, they have like, a lot of new media sort of projects and residencies. Like, a lot of their requirements were.
00:20:08.920 - 00:20:14.152, Speaker C: Very much like had this, you know, if it wasn't physically site specific, it.
00:20:14.168 - 00:20:25.064, Speaker D: Had to be, like, very, like, intensely conceptual. And usually like, they gave you a theme, like, you know, like, solve global warming or, like, solve radicalization online.
00:20:25.144 - 00:20:31.248, Speaker C: It was like, very, like, intense social themes, right? That me as a digital artist, you.
00:20:31.256 - 00:20:33.752, Speaker D: Know, like, thinking about all these things because I'm like a poli signer and.
00:20:33.768 - 00:20:37.834, Speaker C: It'S still the kind of, like, you know, none of my work is, like.
00:20:38.534 - 00:20:46.310, Speaker D: You know, exists to, like, try to solve global warming. Like, I don't know, that's like a really big ask for, like, one digital artist, you know?
00:20:46.382 - 00:21:33.434, Speaker A: Well, let's just. Let me halt to you there, though, because that's fascinating. And after that, I'll pass over to runtoon to ask some questions. But what do you think about this whole idea of, like, in a sense, I think the surrealists were fairly neutral from a moral perspective. And how do you feel as far as, like, in a sense, art is a vector for political change of that sort. Let's say it's okay, we have to create awareness for global warming or climate change, whatever you want to term it. How do you feel about that whole thing? Do you take a more neutral approach? Do you sometimes have your issues that you want to push through your art? Do you push stuff through your art?
00:21:34.494 - 00:21:41.598, Speaker D: I have. I've done, like, you know, works about, like, immigration and, like, immigration rights because I was in that situation, and it.
00:21:41.606 - 00:21:42.862, Speaker C: Was just like, kind of, like, I.
00:21:42.878 - 00:21:48.766, Speaker D: Wanted to speak to my experience. You know, it's like a complicated question.
00:21:48.830 - 00:21:51.190, Speaker C: Because, you know, a lot of us.
00:21:51.222 - 00:22:01.000, Speaker D: Have progressive political tendencies. And, like, I think these things do kind of shine through our art regardless of subject matter. But I also think that, like, art.
00:22:01.032 - 00:22:04.192, Speaker C: In and of itself isn't an end.
00:22:04.288 - 00:22:13.524, Speaker D: In terms of politics. Like, it doesn't necessarily trump, like, collective action or, like, collective organizing or solidarity across groups.
00:22:14.584 - 00:22:16.072, Speaker C: And I think, like, the actual kind.
00:22:16.088 - 00:22:18.472, Speaker D: Of, like, political organizing that needs to happen.
00:22:18.528 - 00:22:23.116, Speaker C: Like, you know, art's kind of tangential to it. Like, maybe, you know, it helps to.
00:22:23.140 - 00:22:25.812, Speaker D: Kind of decorate these movements and, like, make things better.
00:22:25.868 - 00:22:27.428, Speaker C: But, you know, at the end of.
00:22:27.436 - 00:22:28.516, Speaker D: The day, I think it's like, if.
00:22:28.540 - 00:22:30.084, Speaker C: We want to kind of, like, affect.
00:22:30.124 - 00:22:57.558, Speaker D: Change in terms of, like, having more sustainable world that isn't kind of, like, destroying the, you know, destroying the environment everywhere. Like, I think these things come through collective action. Like, I think, like, having art that is, like, too overly didactic and overly kind of, like, trying to, you know, hammer away these themes. Like, can, you know, they don't work on everyone. Like, I think you're kind of, like, reaching to the choir with a lot of these things.
00:22:57.606 - 00:22:59.550, Speaker C: Like, people are going to gravitate towards.
00:22:59.582 - 00:23:01.034, Speaker D: It that already agree with you.
00:23:01.894 - 00:23:27.202, Speaker A: I think you put it beautifully with the overly didactic. I have a friend who, his joke, when he goes to the gallery, his joke criticism is it's too didactic. And, yeah, yeah, I thought it was hilarious. And I think you're right. Like, and that's the problem. Right from a aesthetic point of view, it becomes like you're being preached to. And so sometimes that doesn't kind of.
00:23:27.202 - 00:23:42.644, Speaker A: I almost prefer, you know, if you're going to have, like, a political, you know, edge to it, which in a sense, we all do to a certain degree. It's more about raising awareness than anything, you know? And maybe that's a distinction without a difference, but it feels a little different to me.
00:23:43.824 - 00:23:47.584, Speaker B: The way I always experienced it when I was a student in art school.
00:23:47.744 - 00:23:49.960, Speaker C: Was that, you know, you want your.
00:23:49.992 - 00:24:45.944, Speaker B: Art to have some sort of meaning. And that time in everyone's life, when you're a young student in a college somewhere and you're being opened up to all these new ideas, you become, you know, that little political dial that's inside of you gets turned way up. And what ended up happening with a lot of classmates of mine is they wanted to latch on to this sort of social activism by, you know, imbuing their art with this social activism. So it has a lot of strong meaning, but then they ended up making a lot of bad art. And so it just kind of, like, was a car crash of two, you know, two things that they were trying to achieve that ended up not really getting them anywhere because it became activism using art as the vehicle. But then the art wasn't any good, so it didn't make me want to take their activism very serious.
00:24:46.444 - 00:24:46.964, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:24:47.044 - 00:24:55.004, Speaker D: And, yeah, that's the thing, too. Like, you see kind of clumsy attempts at art that are also, like, you know, and again, like, you agree with the message.
00:24:55.044 - 00:24:57.484, Speaker C: It's like, fuck, yeah, fuck racism, fuck.
00:24:57.564 - 00:24:59.264, Speaker D: Colonialism, fuck all these things.
00:25:00.084 - 00:25:00.408, Speaker C: But.
00:25:00.436 - 00:25:12.400, Speaker D: But, you know, if the art, sometimes you see art that it's just like, about that, and you're kind of like, ah, the art isn't that great. And then you can't, like, you feel you can't critique it much because you don't want to critique the message.
00:25:12.552 - 00:25:17.164, Speaker B: And what I like about your work is that you do keep it close to your personal experience.
00:25:17.584 - 00:25:20.448, Speaker C: And, you know, maybe I kind of.
00:25:20.456 - 00:25:32.306, Speaker B: Want to say this just because maybe there's someone in the audience right now who is kind of like me, but you are someone who was always on my radar from a very early time, getting into Twitter as, like, this place to kind of meet other creatives.
00:25:32.450 - 00:25:33.970, Speaker C: And I would see you post off.
00:25:34.002 - 00:25:38.418, Speaker B: And your name became familiar. And it wasn't until that Twitter spaces.
00:25:38.466 - 00:25:40.954, Speaker C: We had much, you know, many, many.
00:25:40.994 - 00:26:14.034, Speaker B: Many episodes ago about the writer's influence, and you dropped all this incredible knowledge, and it was just, it was something where it's like, I had seen your art before. I always liked it, and I recognize you as this, like, multimedia artist, but hearing you speak and having all these really interesting ideas and this strong sensibility, it just was this kind of, like, powerhouse for me. And anyone in the audience who hasn't listened to that episode should definitely check it out because there's a lot of good information there.
00:26:15.854 - 00:26:16.774, Speaker D: Well, thank you.
00:26:16.854 - 00:26:17.742, Speaker C: You know, it's.
00:26:17.878 - 00:26:29.570, Speaker D: I try to, like, I think my approach usually, like, with the drawings, for example, I'll pick some kind of random topic and then make, like, a silly drawing. And then for me, like, the subtext is what is where you, if you want to delve into, like, the politics.
00:26:29.642 - 00:26:33.098, Speaker C: Or the, you know, the meaning or.
00:26:33.186 - 00:26:35.898, Speaker D: Even the didactic things. Like, sometimes I'll, like, pick a subject.
00:26:35.946 - 00:26:37.322, Speaker C: Matter that's, like, really obscure.
00:26:37.378 - 00:26:54.382, Speaker D: And then you kind of require, like, a little write up. Like, if I draw, like, a racing horse from the 18 hundreds, like, no one's gonna know who potatoes was. But, you know, that's why you have a little write up, write it out, you know, talk about the history of that horse and stuff. But I like that, that, that, like, approach to it where it's, like, the surface is surface.
00:26:54.438 - 00:26:56.190, Speaker C: Like, it's very, you know, it's fine.
00:26:56.222 - 00:27:05.878, Speaker D: If it's fluffy, if it's, like, exists just to kind of, like, attract the senses, attractive viewers, get people involved. But then, like, the subtext, I think.
00:27:05.926 - 00:27:08.862, Speaker C: Is, is like, where, you know, the.
00:27:08.878 - 00:27:12.342, Speaker D: People who, who really resonates will look at that and then maybe that will.
00:27:12.358 - 00:27:15.414, Speaker C: Like, plant a seed in them for.
00:27:15.454 - 00:27:26.306, Speaker D: Something they'll do down the line. They'll think of. Of whatever. I don't know. You know, it's an interesting question to consider. Like, how does art actually influence the.
00:27:26.330 - 00:27:29.738, Speaker C: Viewer and how it influences people?
00:27:29.786 - 00:27:50.112, Speaker D: Like, I heard this quote by Lenin, vi Lennon after he listened to Beethoven's, I think, was his appassionada sonata, or was it the. I forget. It was like one of his piano sonatas. And he was like, if I listen to this every day. Like, there's never going to be a need for revolution. And so I like wondering, like, how. What kind of art is.
00:27:50.112 - 00:27:52.216, Speaker D: Has a narcotic effect where it, like.
00:27:52.320 - 00:27:56.272, Speaker C: Comforts people to the point where they're just like, you know, and what kind.
00:27:56.288 - 00:28:18.456, Speaker D: Of art has an instigating effect where it makes people, like, want to do something? I think artists, like, throughout the. Throughout history, kind of, like, have. Have wondered that, like, brack, that was definitely his. His, like, approach to theater was like, this idea that, like, you know, if you show different forms of alienation, either by the way, aging or by, like, the plot or the humor, you can, like, put these seasoned people that, like.
00:28:18.480 - 00:28:20.296, Speaker C: Down the line, they will, you know.
00:28:20.320 - 00:28:26.244, Speaker D: They'Ll want to, like, have. See help enact political change or something.
00:28:27.904 - 00:28:51.070, Speaker A: Fascinating. And if anybody wants to join the stage here, feel free to put a request to speak. And you can join the conversation here with Sabato and Rune tune. And so bado. I have a couple of questions just on, I guess the first is on glitch. And, I mean, it's been around for. I mean, you'd know better than I would, but it seems like it's been around for.
00:28:51.070 - 00:29:17.896, Speaker A: At least you could probably trace it back decades. But where are we with glitch right now, from your perspective? I mean, it seems like with that Sotheby's show that you're in, that we sort of. It kind of. I don't want to say it hit a mainstream, but it seemed to hit a bit kind of a new kind of, you know, came out of the shadows, into the light, out of the underground, into the overground, so to speak. Like, what is your sense of where.
00:29:17.920 - 00:29:25.672, Speaker C: We are with glitch right now? You know, I. I think, yeah, I.
00:29:25.688 - 00:29:27.504, Speaker D: Think the Sotheby's thing was, like, honestly.
00:29:27.544 - 00:29:32.148, Speaker C: Like a big win for the culture. There was a lot of, you know.
00:29:32.156 - 00:29:36.812, Speaker D: If you follow, like, the whole story of the auction, there's a lot of drama involved because, you know, at first.
00:29:36.868 - 00:29:39.196, Speaker C: It was like, this one collector is.
00:29:39.220 - 00:29:43.036, Speaker D: Like one collection that they were. That they gave the Sotheby's to auction off.
00:29:43.180 - 00:29:45.532, Speaker C: And then Sotheby's, like, created this.
00:29:45.668 - 00:30:09.574, Speaker D: You know, the way they, like, marketed it was as this. Like, we have this, like, the first glitch art show. It's all these pioneers. And then people looked at the roster and there were no women, there were no queer people. It was also very much limited to that collector's, like, interpretation of Glitch, which focused on artists who kind of are web3 native and who mostly do illustration based art. Glitch art.
00:30:10.194 - 00:30:25.894, Speaker B: It was a first in many ways, in my opinion, where it was like, you have this mega institution, Sotheby's showing interest in an art like glitch, but then also these glitch artists and the people expressing their concern about the selection.
00:30:26.414 - 00:30:30.110, Speaker C: And Sotheby's pivoting and changing and like that.
00:30:30.142 - 00:30:32.430, Speaker B: That was pretty incredible, in my opinion.
00:30:32.582 - 00:30:38.038, Speaker D: That was, yeah, I don't think anyone, any of us who ended up in the show expected that kind of turnaround.
00:30:38.166 - 00:30:39.734, Speaker B: I certainly thought we were talking shit.
00:30:39.774 - 00:30:50.494, Speaker D: You know, like you usually do, right? It was kind of funny because we're, like, a lot of us are used to being in this, like, shit talking mode on social media, where we just.
00:30:50.534 - 00:30:54.458, Speaker C: Kind of, like, you know, we just, like, we see someone, like, have a.
00:30:54.466 - 00:31:18.294, Speaker D: Glitch show and say something that isn't true or that isn't representative, like, all of the glitch communities that we've been part of, and we'll point it out. And I think that actually, people listening and people being like. And this is also thanks to, like, you know, the artists who were in the roster who advocated to have a new show and, like, getting, like, Dina and Donia on board to curate.
00:31:19.544 - 00:31:20.616, Speaker C: You know, I think there was, like.
00:31:20.640 - 00:31:28.240, Speaker D: A big community response that was unprecedented that I haven't seen before, like, this kind of, like solidarity.
00:31:28.312 - 00:31:30.632, Speaker C: So, you know, I think despite all.
00:31:30.648 - 00:31:43.112, Speaker D: The drama and, you know, still challenging the work with Sotheby's, like, they are like a very commercial auction house. They only care about, you know, their bottom line and stuff, and they take forever. The fucking pay. I still haven't got paid for my.
00:31:43.288 - 00:31:44.004, Speaker B: No.
00:31:47.304 - 00:31:50.000, Speaker D: But this month, it should come in, like, the middle. In the middle of the month.
00:31:50.032 - 00:31:52.456, Speaker C: But, like, it's weird, you know, like.
00:31:52.560 - 00:31:53.964, Speaker D: Why does it take so long?
00:31:54.544 - 00:32:01.124, Speaker B: Well, if it takes any longer, you could always start shit talking on Twitter, and I'm sure they'll have to change course.
00:32:01.824 - 00:32:13.656, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I get why. Like, you know, you're. If you're selling, like, you know, million dollar pieces like it does, I get it takes half an hour. Not half an hour. It takes 30 days to clear. Well, a million dollar check.
00:32:13.680 - 00:32:13.888, Speaker C: Right?
00:32:13.936 - 00:32:41.304, Speaker A: We're not used to that in web3. Right. We get paid. You know, it's kind of like the resurgence of trad, you know, trad art world in a sense, as awesome as it is that you got on there, too. And you know what's funny? Just on that whole point, like, it did seem like it was quite healthy. At the end of the day, and really, the controversy, I think, just kind of, you know, it gave, you know, there's no such thing as bad publicity sort of thing. Like, it turned out, I think, great for.
00:32:41.304 - 00:33:06.310, Speaker A: Because that's all anybody saw in their timeline for a few days, there was, what's going on with this glitch show? And it seems to me like, you know, just anecdotally, it seems like your glitch work that you've been posting, Sabato, it seems to be going pretty fast. I'd almost say surprisingly fast in the sense that I remember you posting some glitch work, you know, six months ago, which didn't seem to run out the.
00:33:06.342 - 00:33:09.126, Speaker C: Door as quickly, you know, like, and.
00:33:09.190 - 00:33:11.230, Speaker A: Not because of, like, I was buying.
00:33:11.262 - 00:33:12.996, Speaker C: It, you know, but here it seems.
00:33:13.020 - 00:33:16.384, Speaker A: Like it's moving faster. Do you get that sense as well?
00:33:17.684 - 00:33:26.264, Speaker D: I did get a sense that there was a bump in. Just in when I. When I dropped glitcher. Like, I think there's more interest now.
00:33:26.764 - 00:33:28.668, Speaker C: Um, and I think of.
00:33:28.756 - 00:33:30.548, Speaker D: Yeah, I I think that has helped.
00:33:30.636 - 00:33:33.044, Speaker C: Um, just getting the, you know, getting.
00:33:33.084 - 00:33:36.364, Speaker D: The rat, rallying the troops, I suppose.
00:33:36.444 - 00:33:37.868, Speaker C: And I don't know, you know, I.
00:33:37.876 - 00:33:48.836, Speaker D: Don'T know if anyone saw it. Rosa Minkman did, like, a spur of the sales of, you know, how the Sotheby show ended up being. And it was. What was wonderful about it is that.
00:33:48.940 - 00:33:54.500, Speaker C: It showed that, like, you know, the artworks that were curated by the community.
00:33:54.612 - 00:33:59.948, Speaker D: By Dina and Danya, we all met our expectations or exceeded them.
00:34:00.116 - 00:34:03.252, Speaker C: And then the original cohort, like, they.
00:34:03.308 - 00:34:25.636, Speaker D: Had a way less success rate in terms of meeting the Sotheby's estimates or exceeding them. So I think it shows, like, there's a narrative that, like, will actually, like curating. Like, community based curation actually does produce more interesting work and better work and more supported work. And, you know, I think the reality is that most of the bids that.
00:34:25.700 - 00:34:27.164, Speaker C: We got came from our community.
00:34:27.244 - 00:34:35.274, Speaker D: Like, I know some artists got, like, a Cosmo bid, and there were people who are outside the community bid, but a lot of the bids, you know, they started off from.
00:34:35.364 - 00:34:37.430, Speaker C: From within, kind of like the community.
00:34:37.502 - 00:34:42.166, Speaker D: And people who support the glitch artist community, but. Yeah, I see.
00:34:42.230 - 00:34:46.822, Speaker A: I was just going to say yes. Skye Goodman, welcome to the show. Thank you for your patience. Hi, Skye.
00:34:46.918 - 00:34:47.958, Speaker D: So glad you came.
00:34:48.086 - 00:34:54.434, Speaker E: Thank you. I have to talk quietly because my four month old is napping next to me.
00:34:54.814 - 00:35:00.526, Speaker A: Well, we can hear you loud and clear, sky, so all is good over here. Welcome to the show. Where are you calling from again?
00:35:00.590 - 00:35:02.230, Speaker E: Perfect. I'm in Chicago.
00:35:02.342 - 00:35:02.998, Speaker D: Oh, awesome.
00:35:03.046 - 00:35:03.574, Speaker A: Of course.
00:35:03.654 - 00:35:07.954, Speaker E: Which has a great history of glitch roots, actually.
00:35:09.134 - 00:35:09.542, Speaker C: Good.
00:35:09.598 - 00:35:23.314, Speaker A: And what are your thoughts on what we're saying here and about that whole glitch show and how it sort of. It feels like it's kind of. It kind of. I don't want to say it hit prime time because I don't know if it's hit prime time yet, but it's like getting closer.
00:35:24.374 - 00:36:08.372, Speaker E: Yeah, well, I was just thinking about how it tied into what you were talking about earlier with art and activism and collective action, because that was like a perfect example of collective action. Like creating direct results. Like, if the community, if the glitch art community hadn't responded without rage and kind of get almost a viral moment happening that then caught other people's attention and kind of snowballed. I don't think, um. Like so many other times, I don't think anything would have happened. Uh, we've seen so many other. Other times in the space where, um, people are misrepresented, or there was an all male curation, or this, that and the other.
00:36:08.372 - 00:36:43.096, Speaker E: And it doesn't attract enough attention. Attention, and there isn't collective action. And then it's just. It just happens. You got a lot of sad artists talking behind the scenes and DM's, but then nothing happens kind of on the public stage. So I felt like this was a really great win for the space and for us, those of us that have been in glitch, you know, for over a decade or more, to say like, wait a minute, this show is kind of. This curation is kind of B's and not representative of what glitch is about.
00:36:43.096 - 00:37:53.134, Speaker E: And for me, it was more than just it being an all male cast. It was that the show was not really representative of the varying styles of glitch and the history of glitch in the space. Like Sabato said, it was just one style web, three natives. And it kind of almost this revisionist glitch history where it's like almost as if glitch only existed since people came into the space two years ago, when actually there's this really rich history of glitch art that also spans all the way back to, you know, video synthesis artists and video artists in the sixties and seventies, and people like John Cage and Nam June Paik and Daddys movement and all this other stuff. And it just felt like, I dont know, just felt to me like a really good win that we were able to kind of have Sotheby stop, recalibrate and then recurate and bring in people, you know, a diverse cast of characters.
00:37:54.114 - 00:38:08.774, Speaker D: And pay people, too. Like, they paid Danya, they paid Dina. I think that was. And they lost, you know, I think it's great. They lost a lot of money because during the first auction and the section auction, the NFT market totally cratered.
00:38:08.934 - 00:38:09.998, Speaker C: So this wasn't.
00:38:10.086 - 00:38:16.862, Speaker D: I don't think anyone intended this, but I think, like, as glitch artists, this is like the glitch art effect, you.
00:38:16.878 - 00:38:18.782, Speaker C: Know, is that we managed to make.
00:38:18.798 - 00:38:20.846, Speaker D: A large institution lose some money, and.
00:38:20.990 - 00:38:23.990, Speaker C: We managed to make our community get some money. So.
00:38:24.062 - 00:38:24.914, Speaker E: Exactly.
00:38:25.654 - 00:38:56.720, Speaker A: You know, it's a common criticism. We hear sky about the in web3 is like, you'll sometimes hear it with the generative artists as well, and just digital artists in general. It's like there was a digital art before blockchain, before Ethereum was created. And you do kind of see, especially in the generative art space, you do see that criticism. And it almost seemed like it was kind of an echo of that sort of sentiment that it did feel very, you know, what it was?
00:38:56.752 - 00:38:58.924, Speaker C: It was almost like glitch was appropriated.
00:38:59.664 - 00:39:17.410, Speaker E: Definitely. It is. Everyone kept calling this one style of art, like flashing skulls, glitches. And it just was so confusing to me because it was like you wouldn't run around blasting, like, polka music and be like, this is biggie Smalls.
00:39:17.562 - 00:39:18.894, Speaker C: You know, like.
00:39:21.194 - 00:39:31.506, Speaker E: It'S just not. They're just calling it glitch. And I'm like, where did you even get this name from? You don't know anything about this movement. How did this happen?
00:39:31.650 - 00:39:32.346, Speaker C: I don't know.
00:39:32.410 - 00:39:41.854, Speaker A: I think I know. I have a theory on this. And it's the flashing lights. I think the flashing color is why people think it's glitch, because it's kind of glitching.
00:39:43.634 - 00:40:06.004, Speaker B: Well, it's not too bad that the first stage for, you know, a mega institution to kind of give the world some glitch art was Sotheby's because it's really just an auction house. Whereas if it was something like MoMA or the Whitney or like a big museum, you could have had a little bit more of a didactic element in the show and something a little more informative.
00:40:06.464 - 00:40:20.884, Speaker A: Well, that's a great point. Like, has there. I mean, Sabato and Sky, like, has there never been a proper glitch exhibition in, like, any sort of institution? Like, that sounds almost hard to believe. Like, is that true from your.
00:40:21.304 - 00:40:30.630, Speaker B: Has Chicago ever done anything? Because I know you were speaking to that earlier. I'm sure the Chicago Art Institute would be a great platform for something like that to emerge.
00:40:30.702 - 00:41:28.444, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, I know that, you know, the school of the Art institute is here, and John Cates, who is really active in Tezos and the web3 space, used to be the head of the media and animation department, was the chair head of that department at SAIC for many years, and then left academia and is focusing solely on art. But he's been a glitch artist since the nineties. Also a good friend of mine. And so I know that he has done a lot of work in Chicago, like, in connection to SCIC. And then there's a movie theater here called the Gene Siskel, which is also, like, funded by the art institute. So John was able to present his glitches western, which is, like, I think, the first feature length film made of glitch. It's incredible.
00:41:28.444 - 00:42:15.096, Speaker E: And so that was like, a full house, and he gave a Q and a there. I know that he's also co curated another exhibition in Chicago that kind of looked at the history of glitch and video games. But there has nothing been properly done in the art institute itself or in the MCA, which is like our little Moma and I. And I also do know that back in, it might have been. I don't know if it was 2015, maybe Sabato remembers, but the Tate in London had a little glitch exhibition. Both Sabato and I were in that and also took. Yeah, I think.
00:42:15.240 - 00:42:19.364, Speaker A: Is there a. Sorry to interrupt. Do you hear what I hear?
00:42:21.064 - 00:42:26.744, Speaker D: Do you hear beeping? Sorry. There's, like, a big ass truck pulling into my driveway.
00:42:26.784 - 00:42:37.520, Speaker A: It's a glitch. We have a glitch. That is hilarious. Okay, there. I think it disappeared. Awesome. Sorry.
00:42:37.520 - 00:43:04.624, Speaker A: Where were we? Where were we? Oh, yeah. Just the institutional representation. Well, and, you know, it's just, like, to add to the point, we don't need to belabor it, but it's sort of like they keep showing the same 30 artists over and over and over. They have a Gerhard Richter show here at the neue national de Le. And it's like you'd think they'd be jumping on something like this and just going, here we go, people. We have something fresh for you at last.
00:43:05.044 - 00:43:08.128, Speaker C: You know, that would be fun. Yeah.
00:43:08.176 - 00:43:08.840, Speaker E: Still waiting.
00:43:08.952 - 00:43:10.664, Speaker A: Still waiting. Still waiting, I guess.
00:43:10.704 - 00:43:11.920, Speaker E: Which, you know, it's always.
00:43:11.992 - 00:43:12.312, Speaker C: It's.
00:43:12.368 - 00:43:13.404, Speaker E: It's, um.
00:43:13.744 - 00:43:14.104, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:43:14.144 - 00:43:23.004, Speaker E: Comes from the underground, but I guess to be in Sotheby's is to not really be that underground. Anymore. So I guess it's time for a museum to do a big show.
00:43:23.744 - 00:43:24.600, Speaker C: I agree.
00:43:24.752 - 00:43:39.534, Speaker D: I think there has been, like, shows that are about glitch in museums. Like, actually, it's funny. The Hudson Mocha had a show that was, like, had a theme of glitch that was curated by legacy Russell back in 2018, 2019.
00:43:41.074 - 00:43:47.242, Speaker C: But it was. It was interesting because I don't think, like, I submitted work and it didn't get chosen.
00:43:47.418 - 00:43:54.734, Speaker D: And then from what I saw, like, a lot of the works chosen were mostly, like, traditional paintings or very physical, physically based artworks.
00:43:56.834 - 00:43:57.674, Speaker C: And then I thought.
00:43:57.754 - 00:44:00.386, Speaker D: And, you know, it was, again, it's one of those things where it's like.
00:44:00.410 - 00:44:03.492, Speaker C: I think until this hasn't been a.
00:44:03.508 - 00:44:07.944, Speaker D: Glitch show, where it's like, let's do a survey of the different glitch communities.
00:44:08.284 - 00:44:09.340, Speaker C: I feel like a lot of them.
00:44:09.372 - 00:44:58.134, Speaker D: Tend to focus on, like, either, like, you know, the curator's interpretation of the, you know, the subject matter, or it's like, one specific community. Like, the artists who came from kind of like an academic background, you know, from the two thousands, like, they definitely am. I feel like they've gotten shows with each other together. But I feel like, for artists that came into glitch after that, through the glitch artist collective or through web3 or through Tumblr or whatever, I think a lot of us haven't had that moment where an institution was like, let's get all these different communities and kind of do a survey and see how different people approach the topic. Because it's not just different online communities, it's also different parts of the world. South America has their own histories. You know, if you go to, like, Asia, you'd find that, too.
00:44:58.214 - 00:44:59.446, Speaker E: So, yeah, there's a rich.
00:44:59.510 - 00:45:00.606, Speaker D: I think there's a lot of potential.
00:45:00.710 - 00:45:20.646, Speaker E: There's a rich glitch community that's come out of Iran, Argentina. There's. I know there's, like, a lot that happens just in Zagreb, Croatia, as well. Like, a whole kind of subculture of glitch came out of. Out of there. And so, yeah, there's a lot to explore. It'd be great.
00:45:20.646 - 00:45:35.078, Speaker E: Sabato and I, before we got into web3, we talked about actually creating this massive textbook of a survey of glitch art of across all continents and countries. But then we got sucked into this space.
00:45:35.206 - 00:46:07.296, Speaker A: Then we started making money. Yeah, you guys should totally do that. By the way, I was almost thinking, while you're describing all this, it's like. It's almost like it needs to come from within, you know, if you don't tell your own story, someone else is going to tell the story. And do you guys have any thoughts, like John Cates, I don't think, made it into the auction? Do you guys feel like, was that, like, sort of something that got missed by accident there, or. I guess not everybody can make it in, but it was kind of. It seemed to me like he was an obvious person to kind of throw.
00:46:07.320 - 00:46:11.216, Speaker C: In the auction there. Yeah.
00:46:11.240 - 00:46:16.884, Speaker E: I don't know exactly the decision making process of the curators.
00:46:17.224 - 00:46:18.872, Speaker A: Sure. And I don't want to put you.
00:46:18.888 - 00:46:28.534, Speaker E: Guys on the spot, but I do know that they were just limited with the amount of people that I think Donia and Dina could bring in an extra six people.
00:46:29.114 - 00:46:33.554, Speaker A: Right. Okay. Yeah. So it's just like, there's just only so much space. I was just wondering.
00:46:33.594 - 00:46:33.978, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:46:34.066 - 00:46:39.074, Speaker E: And I know there were different people who got thrown around and then still didn't, you know? Right, right.
00:46:39.114 - 00:46:42.546, Speaker C: Yeah. Yeah. Like, love, it was supposed to, was.
00:46:42.650 - 00:46:46.962, Speaker D: Originally included, but I don't think they were able to finish a piece in time with the crunch.
00:46:47.058 - 00:46:50.764, Speaker E: And there was talk about Jamie Fenton also being included.
00:46:52.464 - 00:46:54.384, Speaker C: But maybe it still.
00:46:54.424 - 00:46:58.564, Speaker E: Was hard to bring in people who aren't as active in web3. Right?
00:46:59.104 - 00:47:00.472, Speaker C: Yeah. Yeah.
00:47:00.528 - 00:47:33.114, Speaker A: Interesting. Sabato, I want to just. There's a question I want to ask you, too, just on this idea that you make all these different series, and I think you do fairly well at that. Like, it's a challenging thing to do sometimes for an artist to kind of have these different styles. And so I'm wondering, like, do you have a philosophy about that? Because from indirectly, I'd say they actually do have quite a consistency. Conceptually, there's a style, but it's not overt. But it's almost like you can tell.
00:47:33.114 - 00:47:51.894, Speaker A: I might not be able to tell that they're the same artist without knowing that ahead of time, but once you do, you go, yeah, that makes sense that this is the same artist. Do you have any thoughts on this idea of doing different kind of series? It tells me that you're kind of a somewhat of a conceptual artist in how you approach things.
00:47:54.194 - 00:47:56.706, Speaker C: Yeah. You know, honestly, I think from my.
00:47:56.730 - 00:47:58.362, Speaker D: Point of view, it might come from.
00:47:58.378 - 00:48:02.282, Speaker C: Like, a pragmatic, like, thing, because, you.
00:48:02.298 - 00:48:06.354, Speaker D: Know, if I'm working on a series, I think I'll get to a point where sometimes I just get burned out.
00:48:06.434 - 00:48:12.102, Speaker C: On making the work for the series, and I need to, like, you know.
00:48:12.118 - 00:48:22.798, Speaker D: Kind of change gears and do, you know, do a different approach or work on a different media just to kind of, like, rest from the previous one. Like, I think a drawings is a.
00:48:22.806 - 00:48:30.318, Speaker C: Good example because, like, I can't actually just keep making drawings nonstop because my hand hurts.
00:48:30.446 - 00:48:38.498, Speaker D: You know, just, like, something about drawing with a mouse. Like, it's not always comfortable. And so when that happens, I'm realizing all my hands starting to hurt.
00:48:38.546 - 00:48:39.562, Speaker C: Like, let's.
00:48:39.618 - 00:48:49.098, Speaker D: Let's do some data bending. Let's, like, play with video and play with other media because, you know, it's a different process. And then I feel like I'm operating.
00:48:49.146 - 00:48:51.522, Speaker C: On a different level and kind of.
00:48:51.538 - 00:49:00.362, Speaker D: Like, it, like, allows me to rest from, you know, the drawings or from whatever series I was, like, working really hard on. And I think this idea of, like.
00:49:00.418 - 00:49:02.034, Speaker C: Kind of, like, bouncing back and forth.
00:49:02.074 - 00:49:04.298, Speaker D: Is more of just, like, how do.
00:49:04.306 - 00:49:07.586, Speaker C: You keep saying while maintaining these series.
00:49:07.650 - 00:49:11.930, Speaker D: That you kind of want to continue for a few years at least, or you want to just, like, build out.
00:49:11.962 - 00:49:15.254, Speaker C: Into, like, their own kind of, like, bodies of work?
00:49:15.834 - 00:50:13.074, Speaker B: You know, this is something that I've responded to as well with your work. And so I'm glad you bring this up, Poco Billy, because I think something that we all like to see in NFTs and in this digital art community that's so vast is to see someone who uses a variety of tools, and you're exactly that person. And, you know, my whole experience is in academia and with galleries and institutions. They expect you to be very, very cohesive. If you're a painter, you do mostly only paintings, even sometimes a gallery wanting you to stick to a certain color palette and not breaking outside of that or a certain subject matter. And you're not allowed to, like, kind of go off from that. Otherwise, you're completely subverting what your work is for the audience they perceive it to be.
00:50:13.074 - 00:50:50.288, Speaker B: And so it's always nice to see that you're doing so many different things from pixel to glitch to AI to post photos, photography to regular photo. You know, it's just like, it's. I've always wondered that about you. It's like, how do you identify as an artist? Because it's so easy for someone to be like, well, I'm a painter and I do painting, and sometimes I do drawing or printmaking. And, yeah, I mean, I know it. Like, on your, you. You call yourself, like, a new media artist and photographer, but, like, like, what do you tell people when you, like, meet someone for the first time and you're out with friends and bar or something?
00:50:50.456 - 00:50:52.964, Speaker D: I mean, I guess it depends what kind of friends.
00:50:53.664 - 00:50:55.084, Speaker C: Yeah, I suppose that's true.
00:50:58.864 - 00:51:28.266, Speaker A: It depends on the friends. I love it. Well, you know, I call them process machines. Like, to me, it seems like you have these different processes that you put together, and, like, it's kind of like Warhol. I mean, it has this process, and then you explore that process and what that machine, that conceptual machine can do, whether it's using the, you know, deluxe paint or making, you know, disturbing a jpeg or these other works. You know, what does that, right?
00:51:28.290 - 00:51:31.010, Speaker D: And I'm saying, like, glitch art. Like, saying someone, I'm a glitch artist.
00:51:31.042 - 00:51:32.994, Speaker C: Is, like, for, you know, for people.
00:51:33.034 - 00:51:36.858, Speaker D: Within new media circles, they'll get it. But I think, like, for a regular.
00:51:36.906 - 00:51:38.474, Speaker C: Person, like, they'll be like, what?
00:51:38.514 - 00:51:44.606, Speaker D: What does that even mean? So I just, I think for me.
00:51:44.630 - 00:52:22.858, Speaker B: Like, one of the. So pokebelly was talking about how, you know, amongst this wide range of, like, images and tools that you use to create art, there is, like, a common thread. And for me, it's like this shared experience we all have with, like, digital things, whether it's, like, Internet stuff or video games. And one of my experiences was very, very early on when I was, like, kind of new to. I was just, like, exploring a ton of art on object and just diving through wallets, and I was very bad at, like, clicking the follow button. And it was one of those things where, like, I would come across art.
00:52:22.906 - 00:52:24.074, Speaker C: That was like that.
00:52:24.234 - 00:52:47.694, Speaker B: At the time, I was just like, it was entertaining to me, but then it just, like, the idea, the image just stuck in my head, and I'd go, oh, I got to find that artist again. I have to see that collection again. And it would have been, like, something that I saw a month ago. So there's no use in trying to, like, use the history or any of that to locate the artist. And that happened with you once where it was your echo, the Dolphin series.
00:52:48.274 - 00:52:50.698, Speaker C: And, you know, it's just another one.
00:52:50.706 - 00:53:26.264, Speaker B: Of those examples of, like, that one, for whatever reason, really spoke to me because of this, like, shared experience of, like, you know, clearly I'm assuming you have an experience playing ecco the dolphin, because why else made that series? And so I was trying to find it for one thing to, like, enjoy it for myself, but to show it to a friend who doesn't really, you know, look at digital art a whole lot and just, I was gonna use it as something, but I remember even making a tweet being like, can anyone help me locate this artist that did a whole series on glitching echo the dolphin, please. And I just.
00:53:27.324 - 00:53:33.000, Speaker C: It's funny how it's that shared experience of digital media that kind of, for.
00:53:33.032 - 00:53:35.644, Speaker B: Me, is like the common thread in a lot of your work.
00:53:37.424 - 00:53:37.968, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:53:38.056 - 00:53:38.824, Speaker D: And it's true.
00:53:38.864 - 00:53:40.432, Speaker C: I. I had echo as a kid.
00:53:40.488 - 00:53:45.264, Speaker D: Like, I got it as a Christmas present and then couldn't get past, like, the first level because it's a hard.
00:53:45.304 - 00:53:48.712, Speaker C: Game and then didn't play it for.
00:53:48.728 - 00:54:02.338, Speaker D: Like, ten years until I was, like, in high school and then had, like, you know, you're, like, in high school and you're bored and then you play all the old games for whatever reason. And then I got really into echo and because I was older and I could, like, had Internet, too, so I.
00:54:02.346 - 00:54:04.498, Speaker C: Could, like, look up how to get past things.
00:54:04.546 - 00:54:09.734, Speaker D: I could look up, like, the passwords to skip levels. Like, I managed to beat the game.
00:54:10.234 - 00:54:11.226, Speaker C: And then I was, like, in love.
00:54:11.250 - 00:54:12.738, Speaker D: With the game because it's so beautiful.
00:54:12.786 - 00:54:15.858, Speaker C: Like, there's so much to that game.
00:54:15.906 - 00:54:37.894, Speaker D: That I think people kind of missed out on. Like, those sprites and the levels and, like, the music. And I think, like, when I. When I first started glitching game roms, Echo was the first one that came to my mind because it's like, it's an obscure game. Not a lot of people liked it, but it's like an incredibly beautiful game. So I was like, this has to be. Have to glitch it.
00:54:37.894 - 00:54:40.798, Speaker D: And then what I found out is that, like, I can't stop glitching it.
00:54:40.846 - 00:54:43.054, Speaker C: Like, if, like, a lot of games.
00:54:43.094 - 00:54:47.954, Speaker D: When you glitch it long enough, like, you kind of see repeating patterns and you do see that with echo.
00:54:47.994 - 00:54:50.082, Speaker C: But I think there are aspects of.
00:54:50.098 - 00:54:53.082, Speaker D: How the game is designed. Like, there's like a sandbox level and.
00:54:53.098 - 00:54:55.514, Speaker C: There'S, like, different elements that come into.
00:54:55.554 - 00:54:57.066, Speaker D: Play in ways that are always kind.
00:54:57.090 - 00:55:01.602, Speaker C: Of, like, unique and, you know, like, surprising.
00:55:01.698 - 00:55:05.934, Speaker D: I'm still surprised by the glitches I see in Echo, and that doesn't happen with a lot of video games.
00:55:06.474 - 00:55:14.740, Speaker B: Do you recall what made you want to start glitching video games in the first place? Was it, did you just see someone else do it and you had to. You, you just had to, like, play around?
00:55:14.772 - 00:55:20.264, Speaker D: Oh, yeah. It was Cory Archangel and Super Mario clouds, which was like a classic.
00:55:20.884 - 00:55:23.700, Speaker C: That was my, that was my first.
00:55:23.732 - 00:55:31.052, Speaker D: Kind of, like, exposure. I mean, honestly, the first exposure is you're playing games yourself and it glitches and then you're kind of like, haha, that's cool. Sure.
00:55:31.148 - 00:55:32.104, Speaker B: That makes sense.
00:55:32.564 - 00:55:49.472, Speaker D: And also an inspiration. Danya Darkstone also glitched. I think she did. She did some game glitches that were really great. And, um, this other artist, Jordan Bortner, I think he went by JPEG stripes back on the Tumblr days.
00:55:49.648 - 00:55:52.872, Speaker C: Um, and he was also, like, you.
00:55:52.888 - 00:55:57.560, Speaker D: Know, kind of influential, like, seeing him kind of glitch games and stuff.
00:55:57.592 - 00:55:59.880, Speaker A: Don't drive away, Sabato. Don't drive away.
00:55:59.992 - 00:56:03.936, Speaker D: Oh, no, it's, it's, I'm outside, and it's like I'm hearing all the, like.
00:56:03.960 - 00:56:13.954, Speaker A: You'Re about to say goodbye as you drove off into the landscape. Slime brands. Thank you for being so patient here. Who had their hand up? Welcome to the show. Where are you calling from?
00:56:15.334 - 00:56:19.614, Speaker F: I'm in Dallas, Texas. This is Curtis, by the way. So it's just.
00:56:19.694 - 00:56:21.150, Speaker B: Oh, welcome, Curtis.
00:56:21.302 - 00:56:21.814, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
00:56:21.854 - 00:57:07.894, Speaker F: This was rune tune. Wouldn't quit talking. He kind of, Andy also stole my question. That's what I was kind of thinking as you guys were talking. I was wondering about inspiration, because when you guys were talking about a common thread amongst the work, I feel like that's something what a lot of artists struggle with. When, you know, you learn these tools, you learn the history of art, and then you get in there and you start making, but finding a style that you're happy with and also that you want to stay in that cut in the focus and run with it, I think is really difficult for a lot of people. So I was kind of wondering, what were your inspiration? Like, what were your aha moments where you were like, okay, this is.
00:57:07.894 - 00:57:11.054, Speaker F: This is for me, and this is what I want to continue to make.
00:57:11.834 - 00:57:15.242, Speaker C: That's a good question, I think, because my.
00:57:15.298 - 00:57:19.818, Speaker D: A lot of my work starts from the point of glitch. Like, a lot of my aha moments.
00:57:19.906 - 00:57:22.122, Speaker C: Are, I would say, process based.
00:57:22.298 - 00:57:38.134, Speaker D: Like, you figure out, like, one. One way to break an image or one way to something or an approach. You know, you find a new format or something. Those are big points of inspiration for me. But then it's like, the question is, it's like, you have the process, like.
00:57:38.174 - 00:57:39.822, Speaker C: What'S the next step?
00:57:39.878 - 00:57:45.754, Speaker D: Which is, you know, coming up with a concept and trying to figure out what kind of imagery you want to explore.
00:57:46.054 - 00:57:48.206, Speaker C: And honestly, like, I like when I.
00:57:48.230 - 00:57:58.664, Speaker D: Started making glitch art, my approach was, like, very simple. It was like I had a process, and then I picked random photos that I thought looked cool or had interesting colors or compositions, and I would just.
00:57:58.704 - 00:58:00.720, Speaker C: Kind of put him through the process.
00:58:00.792 - 00:58:08.616, Speaker D: And see what came out. It was very experimental. It wasn't as, like, conceptually coherent as I think, like, over time, you just.
00:58:08.640 - 00:58:13.256, Speaker C: Get better at that. So I think there's like that it's.
00:58:13.280 - 00:58:17.324, Speaker D: Kind of like that old proverb where it's like, big part of inspiration is, like, perspiration.
00:58:17.704 - 00:58:19.096, Speaker C: And I think a big part of.
00:58:19.120 - 00:58:25.902, Speaker D: It is just kind of getting yourself, forcing yourself to be consistently in that process of creating.
00:58:26.038 - 00:58:26.382, Speaker C: Right?
00:58:26.438 - 00:58:30.814, Speaker D: Even sometimes when you don't have necessarily have the best idea or you don't.
00:58:30.854 - 00:58:33.342, Speaker C: Have, like, you know, the answers or.
00:58:33.358 - 00:58:49.182, Speaker D: You feel like you're not quite there with your aesthetic or your own style, like, I think the best thing is just to keep going, keep kind of doing, even if you're making art that you think is bad, like, just keep making it. Like, it's better to have something made and to revise it or even throw it away than it is not to.
00:58:49.198 - 00:58:51.194, Speaker C: Have made it in the first place.
00:58:51.534 - 00:59:04.774, Speaker D: So I think, like, you know, you just got to keep going and you got to trust in yourself and, you know, see what's around you, too. Because I think, like, with time, you find. You find, like, where you want your place to be and what your voice. You find what you want your voice.
00:59:04.814 - 00:59:05.834, Speaker C: To be as well.
00:59:06.174 - 00:59:48.714, Speaker A: That was beautifully put, Sabato, and I totally agree with you. Like, I used to be sort of this quality over quantity, of course, but no, now I'm actually quantity over quality, which is kind of a copernican revolution because I wasn't making any work. And now it's like, I'd much rather be making a lot of work that maybe I have doubts on or whatever, than to be, you know, a perfectionist and trying to get this perfect thing, which is not a great place to be. Actually, I'd argue, as an artist. One thing I wanted to mention about all your work, though, another kind of quality that I think has not been discussed is I think you actually have a very. There's a very aesthetic side to your art, though. Like, it's not just purely process.
00:59:48.714 - 00:59:59.974, Speaker A: It is like, it seems like you're breaking things, but then you very. Are very much are about the. This kind of beautiful result. Do you have anything to say about that?
01:00:00.954 - 01:00:03.682, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I think you're right.
01:00:03.738 - 01:00:07.546, Speaker C: Like, for me, like, the aesthetic kind.
01:00:07.570 - 01:00:10.582, Speaker D: Of like the ineffable experience of art.
01:00:10.638 - 01:00:12.406, Speaker C: Like, this idea of, like, you know.
01:00:12.430 - 01:00:13.798, Speaker D: Trying to reach the sublime or trying.
01:00:13.846 - 01:00:14.554, Speaker C: To, like.
01:00:17.094 - 01:00:20.394, Speaker D: You know, when you create something that you. That it has to be beautiful.
01:00:20.734 - 01:00:22.478, Speaker C: Like, I think it's like, I don't.
01:00:22.486 - 01:00:42.752, Speaker D: Know, it's kind of hard to explain it, because to me, it very much touches on these ideas that are, like, ineffable or, like, unspeakable or you're trying to communicate things that you can't necessarily communicate with language. I think that's a big part of it. And, I mean, I was, you know, growing up, I was really inspired by.
01:00:42.848 - 01:00:46.528, Speaker C: Cinema, by, like, you know, by just movies.
01:00:46.616 - 01:00:48.928, Speaker D: And my favorite films are the ones.
01:00:49.096 - 01:00:53.284, Speaker C: Where the cinematography is just, like, gorgeous throughout.
01:00:53.704 - 01:01:03.914, Speaker D: And the visual language of the cinematography speaks to, you know, how the movie develops. You know, it gives, like, another layer of meaning to the film.
01:01:04.414 - 01:01:07.838, Speaker C: Like, great examples would be like, you.
01:01:07.846 - 01:01:36.500, Speaker D: Know, Chris Marker's Legite, which is made entirely out of photographs. Any photograph is fucking gorgeous. Or, like, you know, Antonioni's films, like Zabrisky Point is a good example, I think, because it's not a great film as a film, but it's a film that communicates everything it needs to just through its visual language. And I think that's really cool. And that was always something that, like, moved me. And so when I create art, when I make art, I, like, very much.
01:01:36.532 - 01:01:38.284, Speaker C: Think it's like I need that, like.
01:01:38.324 - 01:01:54.784, Speaker D: Visuality to be there, you know, independent of everything. Like, I think if it has that thing where it kind of attracts people and brings in the viewer and viewers are like, oh, this is. This has an aesthetic, you know, complexity or something about it that they respond to. I think that's.
01:01:55.134 - 01:01:56.834, Speaker C: That makes the art successful.
01:01:57.894 - 01:02:09.910, Speaker B: Sorry, I have a question. Not to derail from this particular topic, but you're talking about film now. And I remember from conversations past, you said that you wanted to go to school to be a filmmaker but ended.
01:02:09.942 - 01:02:12.382, Speaker C: Up studying political science.
01:02:12.438 - 01:02:12.934, Speaker B: Is that right?
01:02:12.974 - 01:02:13.230, Speaker A: Instead?
01:02:13.262 - 01:02:14.430, Speaker C: That's correct, yeah.
01:02:14.622 - 01:02:25.414, Speaker B: And so, like, at what point did you. At what point did you, like, become an artist or think of yourself as an artist or start making art? Is this just it? Was that something that you'd always done?
01:02:25.794 - 01:02:28.618, Speaker D: Well, I've always, like, drawn. I've always been creative.
01:02:28.746 - 01:02:34.770, Speaker C: Like, I think, like, there's a point where I wanted to be a cartoonist, you know?
01:02:34.962 - 01:02:53.198, Speaker D: Yeah. And then I wanted to be a filmmaker, and then I went to college, but the college I went to didn't have a proper film program. And then I, you know, I had, like, an immigrant, kind of like the immigrant story where it's like, I grew up, I wanted to be an artist. But because, you know, you're an immigrant in the US, like, you're not allowed to be.
01:02:53.206 - 01:02:54.398, Speaker C: It had to be like a.
01:02:54.566 - 01:02:56.314, Speaker D: Some kind of job where I made money.
01:02:57.894 - 01:03:00.350, Speaker B: And part of me, I'm college was.
01:03:00.382 - 01:03:18.714, Speaker D: Like, studying something that made money. And it didn't go well because I flunked out of college. When I was studying to be a biology, I was studying biology and I flunked out of organic chemistry and biochemistry. And then there was a moment, like a semester where I wasn't going to school, but I couldn't tell my dad that I flunked out.
01:03:18.874 - 01:03:19.514, Speaker C: So I had.
01:03:19.554 - 01:03:28.094, Speaker D: I made up this, like, double life, and I, like, was able to launder my tuition money and, like, get myself an apartment and buy myself a digital camera.
01:03:28.394 - 01:03:30.194, Speaker C: And that's when I, like, decided I.
01:03:30.194 - 01:03:51.810, Speaker D: Was like, well, I really just love art. And that's kind of like that semester where I flunked out. I, like, taught myself digital photography, and I, like, got to drawing because I used to draw cartoons. And I had a friend who was like, Sabato, I love your cartoons, but why do all your characters look like the Simpsons? And, you know, she was so spot on with that critique that I was.
01:03:51.842 - 01:03:54.674, Speaker C: Like, I did not draw the circle.
01:03:54.714 - 01:04:02.778, Speaker D: Eyes like the Simpsons again. I need to develop my own style. And so that moment where I flunked out was, like, the decisive moment where I was like, all right, you're going.
01:04:02.786 - 01:04:04.630, Speaker C: To be good at this now because.
01:04:04.662 - 01:04:10.914, Speaker D: You'Re obviously not fit to be a science student because you don't want to do homework. You know, you just want to party.
01:04:12.734 - 01:04:26.114, Speaker A: Well, there's hope there for all these kids that do fail because now a lot of us there are kids around and, yeah, they fail through school. And it's nice to actually hear stories that, well, it all turned out in the end.
01:04:26.534 - 01:04:31.894, Speaker D: It turned out, and I grabbed my degree, I came back. You know, I unfailed myself and, like.
01:04:31.974 - 01:04:34.158, Speaker C: Barely got through but got my degree.
01:04:34.206 - 01:04:36.798, Speaker D: And I just wanted to jump in.
01:04:36.846 - 01:04:44.154, Speaker E: To say that I'm in the same school and had to fail and unfail myself and didn't want to do homework.
01:04:45.254 - 01:04:46.270, Speaker D: I don't know what kind of school.
01:04:46.302 - 01:04:47.046, Speaker E: Of art that is.
01:04:47.110 - 01:05:00.714, Speaker A: You know, I don't think I did homework ever. Like, I don't, like, maybe once, you know, like, I never, ever did my homework. And it's kind of a miracle that I got through everything. Like, I mean, that's amazing. Yeah.
01:05:01.134 - 01:05:02.598, Speaker E: And we've all found each other.
01:05:02.646 - 01:05:03.274, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:05:03.814 - 01:05:12.634, Speaker A: So, Santiago, I see you have. Thank you for coming on stage. It's great to hear from you. Calling from Uruguay. Santiago, welcome to the show.
01:05:14.454 - 01:05:21.406, Speaker G: Hello, friends. Hi, boco. Hi, Ron. Hi, Sabato. How are you doing?
01:05:21.590 - 01:05:30.514, Speaker A: It's doing even better now. We're hearing from you as we wrap up here. We'll start to wrap up, but, yeah, go for it. How are things going with you?
01:05:31.244 - 01:06:27.992, Speaker G: Yeah, it's great to hear you guys. I love Sabato's work, of course, and I agree very much on what he said about overly didactic art or kind of art that says too much. And I stand in a similar place. But I want to ask about a particular piece that I love and that has some political components in it. That is this waiter that went as an open edition of foundation. I'm very curious about what you have to say about that piece because I love it. And I think, for example, that the motion in the walking of the waiter shows so much the effort of a day of physical work.
01:06:27.992 - 01:06:32.004, Speaker G: It's beautiful and very deep to me.
01:06:33.984 - 01:06:35.064, Speaker D: Thank you so much.
01:06:35.144 - 01:06:35.764, Speaker C: I.
01:06:36.184 - 01:06:41.624, Speaker D: It means a lot that that work resonates with you. And, you know, I'm a huge fan of your work and practice as well.
01:06:41.664 - 01:06:43.884, Speaker C: Like, I feel like.
01:06:44.304 - 01:06:56.496, Speaker D: I feel like I don't have enough money to collect all your works because I love so many of them. And then, like, your experiments with, like, creating drawing tools and, like, exploring different, like, tools themselves, I think it's always, like, a pleasure.
01:06:56.680 - 01:06:58.240, Speaker C: But with.
01:06:58.312 - 01:07:08.432, Speaker D: With Garcon, I'm happy. You know, I think you read it really well. It is very much about kind of, like, the toll of labor. And also I think it's like, you.
01:07:08.448 - 01:07:10.576, Speaker C: Know, it is about, you know, the.
01:07:10.600 - 01:07:12.136, Speaker D: Service industry and being, like, just kind.
01:07:12.160 - 01:07:14.312, Speaker C: Of, like, you know, doing that work.
01:07:14.368 - 01:07:37.854, Speaker D: Day in and day out. And the way the motion. The way I kind of designed the motion was that I wanted the. The hand holding the cups to be really still and non moving. But then I wanted the robot, the character's motion to be kind of jaggedy and to be kind of messy. It actually came out cleaner than I was hoping. Like, I wanted it to be even more, like, all over the place than it turned out.
01:07:39.314 - 01:07:40.562, Speaker C: But the idea was kind of like.
01:07:40.578 - 01:08:05.656, Speaker D: To have that contrast between the really still hand that keeps the glasses perfectly well, and then the body, which was totally chaotic and, like, totally going into overdrive, doing everything possible to keep that facade of, like, you know, perfect service of, you know, the, like, aura you get, like, at a fancy restaurant. And I think, you know, as a south American, I don't know if it's.
01:08:05.680 - 01:08:07.616, Speaker C: Like, common in all of South America.
01:08:07.640 - 01:08:09.392, Speaker D: But, like, in Brazil, for example, like.
01:08:09.528 - 01:08:15.256, Speaker C: It'S really common to, like, you know, if you're for, like, the restaurant patron.
01:08:15.280 - 01:08:23.124, Speaker D: To be really demanding on the waiters, you know, like, especially Bougie. I've known that bougie people in Brazil, they asked for all sorts of, like, absurd things from waiters.
01:08:24.384 - 01:08:25.776, Speaker C: And I kind of wanted to get.
01:08:25.800 - 01:08:36.680, Speaker D: That, like, that element, because I feel like in web3, a lot of us are kind of that. We're kind of those garcons. We're kind of the waiters. You know, we always have to be serving this, like, beautiful art.
01:08:36.872 - 01:08:38.208, Speaker C: And, you know, it's.
01:08:38.256 - 01:08:43.612, Speaker D: I've noticed that it's a space that when you do create and you do drop something that's good, like, they usually.
01:08:43.668 - 01:08:46.804, Speaker C: Responds, like, responds to that.
01:08:46.844 - 01:09:10.531, Speaker D: But then, like, this effort of always having to produce something that's good, like, it takes a toll. And sometimes it's hard. Sometimes you're, like, going crazy in the background. You're, like, fighting with family or you're having a meltdown or you're just sick or you have COVID or God knows what. But you still trying to create something beautiful and trying to put something that has that veneer where you're like, I'm an artist. I make things all the time. Touch something, it becomes beautiful.
01:09:10.531 - 01:09:15.427, Speaker D: But, you know, the truth of the matter is that there's a lot of, like, physical effort and emotional effort, and.
01:09:15.475 - 01:09:16.463, Speaker C: It can be hard.
01:09:19.363 - 01:09:24.035, Speaker G: I'm so glad I asked this. I love what I said here.
01:09:24.099 - 01:09:24.963, Speaker A: It's an awesome question.
01:09:25.003 - 01:09:26.143, Speaker G: Thanks so much.
01:09:26.843 - 01:09:28.195, Speaker B: Thank you, Santa.
01:09:28.339 - 01:09:37.228, Speaker A: That was a great question. And, you know, one quick question on a work that I completely missed here, the remixed fabulous monsters. I was.
01:09:37.316 - 01:09:37.740, Speaker C: It's like.
01:09:37.772 - 01:09:49.068, Speaker A: Looks like a trading card. It's gorgeous. I've never seen it. It looks like a collaboration here with Pearl Hyekens. Have you ever thought about doing trading cards? Because that would be unbelievable.
01:09:49.156 - 01:09:50.100, Speaker D: Oh, my God.
01:09:50.292 - 01:09:53.764, Speaker C: You know, it's funny. Like, I think it's like.
01:09:53.844 - 01:10:28.534, Speaker D: I don't know. You know, I've thought of it, but I haven't yet. I think we're up in, like, it's a brazilian. There's, like, a brazilian kind of aspect to, like, growing up with trading cards. Like, when I was a kid, there was a card game called Super Troonfo, and it was basically like, if you can imagine Pokemon cards, but, like, it's with cars. So it's like, you have, like, you know, card with, like, a fiat sedan, and then you have another card with, like, a Ferrari, and you basically just, like, Pokemon. You kind of put cards down, and then it's like, the car that's fastest wins or something.
01:10:30.214 - 01:10:30.566, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:10:30.590 - 01:10:51.154, Speaker D: You know, I've thought of it, like, I think card games are just, you know, there's such a part of, like, growing up, too, but I don't know, the piece with Pearl Hyacinth with, I think her IRL name is Melody Owens. She's an artist down in Australia. And she was doing these, like, augmented reality collaborations with different artists where she would do a collage.
01:10:51.454 - 01:10:54.214, Speaker C: And then if you hold your phone.
01:10:54.254 - 01:11:14.320, Speaker D: Over the collage, like, this other artwork would appear. And that's kind of what this work is. It's, you know, there's an augmented reality from Melody's original collage where if you like, you know, look over it with your phone on the. I think the app is called Ajac.
01:11:14.512 - 01:11:16.032, Speaker C: If you look, look over it with.
01:11:16.048 - 01:11:27.324, Speaker D: Your phone, like, my work would appear my drawing, and it's kind of like, they're very similar, but I haven't, I haven't actually listed it yet. I was planning on doing it maybe later this week, early next week.
01:11:28.194 - 01:11:30.226, Speaker C: I was just kind of waiting for.
01:11:30.250 - 01:11:32.386, Speaker D: The right moment to list it.
01:11:32.410 - 01:12:03.098, Speaker A: And you know what else I love about it? Sorry to interrupt. What I love about it, maybe one of the things most of all, is you have, like, tiny dithering in one area, but then it's like, you have, on the top, you have, like, big pixel dithering. Do you know what I'm talking about? Like, in the background, you have kind of, it's like, this feels like really small, one pixel dithering. And then. Yes, I've just in love with. When I see that. And I've seen a few other artists just, like, in totally different ways.
01:12:03.098 - 01:12:09.346, Speaker A: I think Kappin had something where it's like, really big pixels with small pixels. It's beautiful.
01:12:09.450 - 01:12:10.074, Speaker C: And like these.
01:12:10.114 - 01:12:20.604, Speaker A: Yeah, you could have, like, a total trading card, you know, digital art, kind of with this deluxe paint. You know, it just feels like a tough. Anyway, on and on I could go.
01:12:20.764 - 01:12:39.268, Speaker D: But, you know, those photoshop, like, because I had to, like, resize, you know, deluxe paint, u export, you have very specific sizes because of, like, just the software's native resolution and all that. Um, but with a project like this, it's like, I have to size things based on Melody's specifications for her AR app.
01:12:39.436 - 01:12:41.708, Speaker C: So, you know, the.
01:12:41.796 - 01:12:47.004, Speaker D: It was a little tricky because if you, you know, if you ever played with pixel art, you know that, like.
01:12:47.044 - 01:12:49.398, Speaker C: You really kind of have, like, you.
01:12:49.406 - 01:13:07.594, Speaker D: Have to size at certain intervals, otherwise the pixels get all like. And so, like, part of it was just me making big pixels because I could just stretch those, you know, the still art out. And then with the animation, it's like, well, you have to keep that at a specific size so the animation will look crispy.
01:13:08.214 - 01:13:08.934, Speaker A: Super.
01:13:09.094 - 01:13:16.572, Speaker D: But I, you know, the fact that I stuck out, that's definitely something, you know, I should be exploring more. It's just kind of like playing with these different resolutions.
01:13:16.628 - 01:13:35.420, Speaker A: Well, I totally agree. And it's something that, I just think it's so powerful. And again, it's almost like by putting it in Photoshop, because I noticed at the top there's no movement in the image. And it's probably because you had to, you know, put it in Photoshop. And so, anyway, just super fascinating. It's gorgeous work. I hope to collect that.
01:13:35.420 - 01:13:38.544, Speaker A: So, as we're wrapping up here, Sabato, what's next?
01:13:39.964 - 01:13:40.790, Speaker C: What's next?
01:13:40.892 - 01:13:43.626, Speaker D: Um, you know, that's a good question.
01:13:43.690 - 01:13:44.074, Speaker C: I'm.
01:13:44.154 - 01:13:49.138, Speaker D: I guess I feel like I never know how to answer that. I mean, I'm working on the residency.
01:13:49.306 - 01:13:51.394, Speaker C: What else have I got coming on?
01:13:51.434 - 01:13:53.334, Speaker E: You should show our collab.
01:13:54.074 - 01:13:55.574, Speaker D: Oh, yeah, that's true.
01:13:58.834 - 01:13:59.962, Speaker C: So, yeah, just.
01:14:00.058 - 01:14:21.366, Speaker D: Or a few days ago, I minted this collab with Skye Goodman, and this was a. This was actually work that we made for an IRL exhibition. It wasn't designed for NFTs, which is kind of like, lately has been kind of the exception rather than the rule, but yeah. So the work is called Spawfist Solutions.
01:14:21.510 - 01:14:23.950, Speaker C: It was for a show called Spa.
01:14:23.982 - 01:14:32.030, Speaker D: Corps, which was held in Chicago at the Pope Prosperity Gallery in April. And the exhibition is centered around this.
01:14:32.062 - 01:14:34.102, Speaker C: Idea of, like, you know, let's look.
01:14:34.118 - 01:14:48.372, Speaker D: At wellness capitalism, at like, this culture of like, of wellness and how it relates to labor and how it relates to kind of like the endless and precarious labor we have to do. But then let's look at it in kind of like a funny, campy, kind.
01:14:48.388 - 01:14:51.700, Speaker C: Of like, horror film style lens where.
01:14:51.732 - 01:15:14.634, Speaker D: Everything is, like, terrifying and absurd. And so the exhibition was held in April. It was. It went over really well. There were, like, about 40 artists from around the US showing. And then Skye and I had a collaboration, which was, it's a video work. It was created in the three do game.
01:15:14.634 - 01:15:18.514, Speaker D: What's it called? Life stage virtual house.
01:15:18.974 - 01:15:21.846, Speaker C: And what I did is I created.
01:15:21.870 - 01:16:03.304, Speaker D: These spaces that kind of mix, kind of like a spa with tubs and kind of like, resting areas, and then put, like, all these screens. And then in the screens, I composited Skye's incredible video art. And then I just kind of created this short two minute, sort of walkthrough through these spaces that are very spa like but also have a lot of screens. With Skye's work, I think the idea is kind of like creating these environments where it's like you have to rest, but you also have to work at the same time. And it's interesting because what I found is that people's reaction are usually like, oh, this actually sounds wonderful, but I'm like, well, no, this should be terrifying because you should just be sitting at the tub without the screens.
01:16:03.644 - 01:16:05.636, Speaker C: But, you know, it's such a part.
01:16:05.660 - 01:16:11.104, Speaker D: Of our lives now where it's like you don't. You want. It's like you want the.
01:16:11.964 - 01:16:13.580, Speaker C: You want the chains to be there.
01:16:13.652 - 01:16:28.974, Speaker A: It's almost like there's a. There's a sense of a lack of something if we don't have a screen around that somehow we're missing out on what's going on. Any final thoughts, Sabato? Any final thoughts? Anybody or everything, anywhere?
01:16:30.514 - 01:16:39.226, Speaker D: Ooh, no, I'm really bad at final thoughts. Just be kind, everyone be kind to each other, I guess. And you don't drink a lot of water.
01:16:39.330 - 01:16:53.900, Speaker A: I love that, actually, because you know what? Those are actually two really good final thoughts about. It was so nice work there. Anybody else on stage there? Any thoughts? And rune tune. Any final thoughts for us? Oh, yeah.
01:16:53.932 - 01:17:13.204, Speaker B: It's just been such a pleasure following you, Sabato, over the last couple years and kind of seeing what you're into and learning about those things. The spa corps video that you shared yesterday, or maybe it was a few days ago, I'm not sure, but I saw it last night. And you're always someone I like to follow. You always have interesting things to say and share.
01:17:13.324 - 01:17:15.388, Speaker C: So thank you. Thank you, Roon.
01:17:15.436 - 01:17:20.404, Speaker D: Thank you, poco. Also thanks, Santi and Sky for coming on board, and Curtis, too.
01:17:21.104 - 01:17:21.904, Speaker C: Thank you all.
01:17:21.944 - 01:17:36.924, Speaker D: And I'm. I'm seeing, like some. A lot of homies here in the, in the audience. Shout out to tooks and Mac and Mikey, Evelyn, Edmarola, Martin, Jo, Sean Liu, Gilea, Doctor, virgin, art theft, mental noise.
01:17:38.064 - 01:17:40.084, Speaker C: You know, I'm seeing a lot you don't.
01:17:40.664 - 01:17:42.536, Speaker D: I can't name you all, but I love you all.
01:17:42.600 - 01:17:44.920, Speaker C: And thank you for showing up and.
01:17:44.952 - 01:17:46.382, Speaker D: For being a part of this.
01:17:46.438 - 01:18:02.914, Speaker A: It was awesome. And I totally agree with Roon. I think you really add something to the space, and I'm thrilled also. Yeah, I've been excited about your work since I first saw it. When I landed on Tazos, it took me about one session. It was the basketball, the hand in the basketball net. It was our early drawing work.
01:18:02.914 - 01:18:08.462, Speaker A: Remember that? And you know how I discovered it was actually through Haiti Rockette's collection?
01:18:08.598 - 01:18:09.110, Speaker C: Oh.
01:18:09.222 - 01:18:29.394, Speaker A: Because I was buying Haiti Rockette's work, which is kind of one of the first things I got into. And so, anyways, yeah, you bring a lot to the space. And thank you for doing this. And thank you, everybody who came on stage. And thank you, everybody who came and showed up to listen. Thank you, Sabato. And thank you once again, runetune, for co hosting and doing a wonderful job here.
01:18:29.394 - 01:18:33.454, Speaker A: Until next time, everyone, take care, and I hope you enjoy your day.
01:18:33.834 - 01:18:35.114, Speaker C: Thank you. Y'all have a good day.
