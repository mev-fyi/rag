00:00:06.080 - 00:00:31.012, Speaker A: Artist Journal September 14, 2022, Berlin. My name is Adrian Pokebelli and I welcome you back. Always back. Let's see, let's see, let us see. So thanks again. More nice comments. Even Xerox was weighing in, you know, and it's great.
00:00:31.012 - 00:01:06.820, Speaker A: I mean, I feel like I'm kind of the guy that showed up to the party 2 hours too late and now I'm trying to tell everybody what to think about the party and what's going on. So anyway, I really appreciate it. And yeah, the numbers are doing just this channel is going swimmingly. It's just going kind of nicely. And I just like the small organic growth that continues. And actually, speaking of growth, we have an event. There is an event that I'm going to attend today by art to act NFT London.
00:01:06.820 - 00:01:34.534, Speaker A: These guys are prepared so they are taking this event seriously. So it's probably something you want to check out. There are some awesome people involved here. Mikey Wilson, Rex Flexosaurus, Saucebook Underground, NFT Purple drank, Museum of Crypto Art, Joe Rogan's dad. And guess Pokebelli's in there, which is hilarious. And blue seven. So anyways, how art meets collectors should be a great discussion.
00:01:34.534 - 00:01:51.626, Speaker A: It's today at 05:00 p.m. Berlin time. So that would be 11:00 a.m. New York Toronto time, eastern standard time. So calibrate yourselves accordingly. Just wanted to let everybody know. So that is exciting.
00:01:51.626 - 00:02:06.426, Speaker A: So very cool work here, which I missed by Dancontrol. D a N c t r l. I assume I'm pronouncing that right. It's always a challenge here. Message me if I get it wrong. Really awesome. Game Boy.
00:02:06.426 - 00:02:25.252, Speaker A: I think this is Game Boy advance sp. How long have I not used it? How long? I haven't played with it. So some poetry there from Dan Control two. You can buy this for two tazos. I saw this on Twitter yesterday. I thought, how did I miss this? Because I was following this guy. Pretty sure I follow this guy.
00:02:25.252 - 00:03:09.096, Speaker A: If not, let's oh, I need to follow. That's why I missed it because he put out also this awesome work of the lighter, which was a head turner a couple of weeks ago and also still available for fortezos. I mean, it reminds me, I think I brought it up here of Mel Ramos, the famous pop artist. I mean, he's not, I guess you'd call him like pretty famous. I mean, he's not on, he's not a household name necessarily like Warhol, but he's pretty famous. And it's these you know, he's part of that pop art canon. And you see these air, the airbrush style even here in the shadow.
00:03:09.096 - 00:03:35.020, Speaker A: And his thing was sort of these nudes and consumer items which were often kind of phallic in nature. We can go back to. Yeah, you see the cigar here now? I don't think. I think so. I just see it in the style of Dan control and look at the color and everything. A lot of creativity actually in the color. So another really nice execution there.
00:03:35.020 - 00:04:10.068, Speaker A: I mean, you can tell Dan is experimenting with different stuff here because you go back to the lighter. Yeah, that was just a couple of weeks ago. You see kind of mixed results that got the coffee, but it's actually worth selling for more. So again, the chair was really interesting. I was thinking of picking this one up. So anyway, kind of a very interesting kind of artist to just, you know, again, that, that this piece just, I love. So there is that.
00:04:10.068 - 00:04:59.100, Speaker A: What else do we got on the menu here? You know, I actually did this episode and I finished it, and then I went to hit stop record, and then it was like, start recording. Like, it wasn't recorded. So I'm a little more prepared, actually, hilariously. So anyways, I decided it's more important for me in my head to show up than, frankly, even to put out a good episode. So let's see if that continues. But it's sort of like, as I was saying in the last episode that wasn't recorded this, do not wait for inspiration. Like, in a sense, I assume people in this scene already know that they're quite productive.
00:04:59.100 - 00:05:49.286, Speaker A: But, you know, the amateur artist, you know, and we've all been there. I've been there, you know, will wait to be inspired to do their work. And really, the professional artist treats it like a nine to five, and you just show up and you can't worry about, in a sense, what's going to come out or not. And if you do it enough and if you're kind of, you know, that determined and that obsessed about it, you're probably going to turn out some pretty good work over time. So it really is about showing up. This whole idea of, you know, waiting for inspiration is kind of a terrible idea, in my opinion. I mean, you may feel different and it might work for you, but, you know, all these guys who are kind of at the top of the scene for the most part, you know, like a Jeff Koons or.
00:05:49.286 - 00:06:10.310, Speaker A: And I'm, you know, I'm ambivalent. I don't hate Jeff Koons like a lot of people do, but I don't love him either. I think he's interesting and quite smart and surprisingly humble. A lot of people might debate me on that. Anyway, I don't want to get lost in the weeds here, but it's just important for me to show up to this thing. So here I am again. So, couple of works.
00:06:10.310 - 00:06:48.954, Speaker A: I kind of got to go back here because what I originally wanted to show was this awesome dollar bill. Remember WOC or walk from the September 11 works a couple of days ago. I really like this work, this $1 bill that's just like, sometimes a work just hits, you know? And this is what happens when you go to the studio or wherever your studio is. A lot of us are digital. So my. I joke with people. My studio is sometimes, like, terrasse on a Starbucks coffee shop or nice coffee shop because I work on my phone, but sometimes works just hit.
00:06:48.954 - 00:07:06.394, Speaker A: And this work just hit. Just like that game Boy work just hit. That lighter just hit. This work just hit. And it is a digital work again. I'm tempted to think, like, there's, like, a gaussian blur tool being used here. I mean, maybe it's not that simple.
00:07:06.394 - 00:07:39.634, Speaker A: There's probably more going on. But sometimes, like, this is just a poetic rendition of the dollar, which we often see in kind of the crypto, twitter, nft scene, these kind of commentaries on the dollar. And I thought this was a particularly good one. If you want to buy it, you have to put an offer in because it was sent, I think, to previous collectors. So that's. Yeah, so I'd love to pick up a copy of this, but let's see. I think it'll go great in the collection.
00:07:39.634 - 00:07:56.284, Speaker A: But before we forget. So this was another work by walk. Just look at his portfolio. So you see a lot of this kind of blur, for lack of better, kind of noisy blur. I saw this work, and I thought. And I was actually looking for it. It's good we're recording.
00:07:56.284 - 00:08:18.978, Speaker A: Re recording this because. Or recording for the first time because I actually took a minute to find what I was looking for here. An allegory with Venus and Cupid by bronzino. And so you'll see, like, kind of a cool take on that. I'm sure. This is that I recognize the color. You can see the composition move my cursor here.
00:08:18.978 - 00:08:58.576, Speaker A: So just some more interesting work by WOC, who just continues to get attention here to get. To turn my head again. That dollar bill is fabulous. I thought this was a really great work that I had missed as well by wastman Goldman, the failed artist self portrait. So a brutal rendition of the failed artist. And I just thought this was kind of hilarious, you know, pretty brutal too. If we look at the hamburger and what else is here? Lying basically in an alley, looks like someone tattooed on him.
00:08:58.576 - 00:09:32.628, Speaker A: You know, I've heard a story in Berlin of people who no longer on the street, but who were tattooed when they're like passed out, like pretty brutal. So anyways, so here is the failed artist buy for 95. I was looking, you know, Diego just sold one for twelve. Diego Barrow, who's doing some nice work, who we will return to in a future episode. You buy this for Tezos 20. He did a nice ten x on it. And now if you want to buy it on the market without making offers, you got to pay 95.
00:09:32.628 - 00:10:14.730, Speaker A: Again, one of my favorite works by wasteman Goldman, a nice one. Francois Gamma just put out this work this morning, which I thought was kind of interesting. You might remember him from the abstract pixel work that we were looking at. To me, I don't know if this is an actual play on vesuvian man by Leonardo, but it kind of feels like it. Interesting, original take. Even if it's not, it's still interesting, right? So just kind of another interesting work by Francoise Gamma, who just continues to put out work. These were all sent to Jano Lapin Gallery, who I've never heard of, actually.
00:10:14.730 - 00:10:39.434, Speaker A: Montreal based contemporary art gallery, representing artists, curating innovative exhibits, and offering an artist residency program with our 14 studios. Well, if you guys want to go to Montreal, you might be able to set something up with these guys. So. Yeah, so interesting. So put out on versum, maybe they will put it for sale. I used to live in Montreal for eight years, by the way. That was quite a while ago.
00:10:39.434 - 00:11:09.828, Speaker A: So I was looking at this strange thing sent me, he said, look at these sales that are going on, on this thug lord. And he's absolutely right. You have to spend ten tezos now to buy this. And it's easy, this is an addition of 1000. Okay. And the sales, if we look, did I bring them up here? Let's just reload for the latest. Yeah, there's been more sales since, so.
00:11:09.828 - 00:11:32.498, Speaker A: Okay, so 650 is the latest, 610. These sold for one tezos before a few days ago. Really? Nine, six. So 13, 1312, addition of a thousand. So the demand continues. This work we're talking about, some works just hit. This work just hit.
00:11:32.498 - 00:12:18.978, Speaker A: That's almost, I think that's the name of this episode, you know, some works just hit. Because that's what we're seeing here, we saw it with a dollar bill, we saw it with the lighter and the game boy they're just hitting and so interesting. I mean to me that says there's a little bit of depth here in the collector's market on Tazos. If you have a thousand addition of 1000 making this many sales on the secondary for this high, you know it shows. Again, this work just hit now I went through the owners, there is someone that owns 100, some people own 21. So it is also part of the speculation. A lot of people own more than one so that's also to be kept in mind.
00:12:18.978 - 00:12:44.932, Speaker A: So there is a kind of a, I don't want to say an artificial reduction of supply but there are people that own just a lot. Look at that. Decentrals owns 100 now. I'm ambivalent on whether this is good or bad by the way. I think it's great for the artist. I mean strange thing picks up 100 tezos from it's a free market and it's probably best that way. And it's all transparent.
00:12:44.932 - 00:13:06.100, Speaker A: So everybody knows who's buying this. I mean you can put maybe you put an offer in, you know like let's look at the offers like for six. You can't. These guys are waiting. Oh is that right? Yeah, these guys are waiting to pick it up for six. So that's a six x in a few days here. This came out what September 4? So.
00:13:06.100 - 00:13:39.264, Speaker A: And it's selling again like you see the power of art when it hits. These are like ten x, you know twelve x in certain cases 13 x. But be aware there are people with 100 of these. But probably a great speculation 49 but that's vending nfts so they probably put it in their vending machine. I assume that's so you know. So again you can't be judgmental on these things. But all to say you should be checking this stuff just so you know what's going on.
00:13:39.264 - 00:14:32.772, Speaker A: So you're aware. And a very cool work all time high for strange thing at 356 tezos for this work with the McDonald's eating McDonald's and it's hilarious. These huge fries I think it's like you see the hand and the fries. I almost expect like a 6th finger here. So anyways cool work. He's going to town on the logos here so he's taking no prisoners on the fair use copyright laws. And we can go deeper into copyright actually maybe because I've actually consulted with a copyright lawyer here in Germany so I can share because for my screen memory series, I use images that are taken from the history of art and.
00:14:32.772 - 00:15:14.272, Speaker A: But I transformed them. So anyways, we'll go into that maybe tomorrow or the day after at some point because there's some actually very interesting things to know and I'm not a lawyer, but just I'll tell you what I think I know and so that's useful. So congratulations to strange thing on the latest sale. So continuing to do fabulous more AI works here, I think. I mean, Eddie Tree doesn't say it, but I look at this and I go, you know, this looks like a really nice impressionist work that I've never seen before. An interesting doubling is going on. I mean, we have two sons and almost at the same distance apart we see these two people, but slightly different.
00:15:14.272 - 00:15:40.470, Speaker A: So it's tempting to think there's a bit of a. I'm really tempted to think this is AI, but I do not know, again, it would be nice to know. So that is not Eddie Tree's price here of 250. He's selling them pretty cheap at five for one of one. And creators gallery goes, thank you very much. That'll be 250 if anybody wants to buy it from me. Another one here.
00:15:40.470 - 00:16:25.474, Speaker A: So these are, it's turned into a nice little business for Eddy Tree. Again, this looks like a Monet sky here, but the landscape frankly looks more like a pissarro who had smaller brushstrokes. Where the sky is, I'd call, say, clearly a monetary maybe. What was the name of the english sounding guy? I can't remember. But anyway, this looks like a combination of impressionist paintings. So again, but if you didn't know about AI and you just saw this and just saw it, you'd go, okay, that's pretty impressive. You know, impressive impressionist works that you've never seen before.
00:16:25.474 - 00:16:49.154, Speaker A: At least I've never seen it. Again, this looks like AI influenced work as well with Hannibal cash grab. Again with that german expressionist sort of look. So just doing a little AI update here. Nice. The thing is, is a nice composition. I mean, one of the nicer paintings I've ever seen of the Joker original.
00:16:49.154 - 00:17:17.414, Speaker A: So that's why it's tempting. It's almost a little too good, is the thing, the composition, and there are maybe issues with the mouth here I was noticing and whatever. And maybe again, that's just part of the charm. But again, tempting to think this is AI buy for five. What else here? So this is just another thing about these larger editions that are doing quite well. I mean, this is almost sold out. So this isn't on secondary.
00:17:17.414 - 00:17:53.986, Speaker A: This came out a week ago. So it's doing okay for Adelia. It's collaboration with Jay Byrne and some music. Let me just do that. So pretty hilarious. So just kind of interesting, this combination of audio in the NFT or digital art space. Like you can do this technically, I guess, in the physical arts world by putting a speaker underneath.
00:17:53.986 - 00:18:17.674, Speaker A: But it's not really a part of the work. If you put it beneath a painting, let's say it's not really a part of the work in the same way that this audio is a part of this work. Like love by Adelia and Jayburn. And again, they're almost sold out of that, actually. Let me just show you. So they're, but they're selling quite well at nine tazos. Okay.
00:18:17.674 - 00:18:52.884, Speaker A: Another large edition by Lewis Osborne, edition of 50, which is selling for 20, edition of 40 selling for 17. This is a week ago edition of 50 selling for $12.50. Thank you IC Jules again for sending this to me. Very nice gift. I think it's iC Jules. So all to say, these large editions are doing quite well. I was also looking at Lewis Osborne's just kind of latest sales just for a very quick update on that.
00:18:52.884 - 00:19:22.140, Speaker A: And he's doing again this balloon series. Here it is, you know, was basically sold in the last two days. It basically all went for between 60 and 62 here. He accepted offers. I think he's accepting offers above 60 and maybe did it randomly, I think is what happened. Now it's 80. So it's actually not too much more than those offers.
00:19:22.140 - 00:20:07.760, Speaker A: So that's kind of interesting. This was sent to me and I don't, wouldn't normally kind of profile works that are sent to me, but I actually kind of like this piece. I do like this piece. Thank you tot for sending it. That's why I'm showing it. And I just kind of like this idea of charts as art, you know, particularly now as we are in this kind of, I guess we're coming off of this historic speculative mania that probably really got going in March 2020 and all those stimulus checks where everybody was bored and just put their money in the market or crypto ended insane. So now we're feeling the hangover of all that.
00:20:07.760 - 00:20:38.840, Speaker A: So just a cool work. So thanks tot, for sending me that very, just interesting and cool. Made a sale to a significant player here. Fork gallery NFT has acquired a pokebelly and they're putting a nice hefty price tag on it. This coach ad, a screenshot just from the sketchbook here. So thank you to Fort Gallery NFT for adding that to your collection. Again, just very fun and it's great to be a part of it.
00:20:38.840 - 00:20:56.104, Speaker A: Thank you. So yeah, I was selling it nice and cheap, but can't get it cheap anymore. 1200 tezos from Fort Gallery NFT. So other than that, let's leave it there. Thank you for joining me once again. Maybe I'll see some of you later on Twitter spaces. And until next time, take care.
