00:00:05.480 - 00:00:38.294, Speaker A: I hope you've had your coffee because we have a ton to get through today and we're gonna race through it. Look at this incredible work here. I think her name's Dana. We'll check out the name in a second. But what an awesome kind of Sci-Fi manga thing. Artist Journal, October 10, 2022, Berlin. My name is Adrian Pokebella, your artist reporter, and I continue to find like incredibly beautiful works like this one here, which seems to be like a window into our future, maybe in Tokyo.
00:00:38.294 - 00:01:07.686, Speaker A: This is what it's like. I don't know, it's like a genre of sorts. A genre of sorts. This kind of anime, Sci-Fi manga, even these colors, we saw them yesterday in that machine where you get the teddy bears with the claw. I don't know what those are called. That you find it fairs and arcades corrupted by Dana Ulama. We're going to see more of Dana's work later in the program, but that, you know, this.
00:01:07.686 - 00:01:36.860, Speaker A: I wanted something for the COVID and that kind of fit all the requirements there. So really awesome work. And I did actually want to read the description very quickly because it's actually kind of poetic, a little bit. Winter 20 21 22 was one of the toughest for me. I created this while recovering from an illness that affected my drawing hand illustration made in procreate animated in Photoshop. Well, it's a beautiful, beautiful work. Great title.
00:01:36.860 - 00:02:03.270, Speaker A: Corrupted on super rare. So we continue to be cross chain here. Quick thank you to the people who bought snow, part of the eight bit Nature series here. I slaved over every one of these pixels, so thank you for the purchases. At only a Tezos 32, the price is going to go up in about 24 hours or so. I'll put out a tweet. Thank you to doctor scratch and sniff, Paulie Jojo and the anonymous collector.
00:02:03.270 - 00:02:31.674, Speaker A: Much appreciated. Yeah, I'm a big fan of winter scenes and just doing Christmas shows. Maybe we can think of something. Estelle and Ed chimed in, so it was great to hear from them. Thanks, Adrian, for mentioning connecting chaos latest mints in stage Dreamers, the collaborative project in which Eduardo Pulitzer, Ed Marolla and I work towards the purple infinity. So thanks for the comments, guys. Ed chimed in here somewhere too.
00:02:31.674 - 00:02:58.444, Speaker A: And so that's awesome. And just a work in progress from Ed that kind of turned my head that I saw on Twitter. It's just pretty, you know, it's kind of like that AI palette tool that we saw yesterday. Like, I almost want these to be incorporated into the works a little bit. Ed's such an original artist to me. Like just kind of unapologetically himself. And it really, the more you see it, the more you just start to go.
00:02:58.444 - 00:03:14.104, Speaker A: Yeah. Thank you to burka Byram og on the Tezos scene. So I appreciate you. I appreciate the shout out. So thanks for that. As I said, long overdue. So shout out to Burka Byram.
00:03:14.104 - 00:03:30.604, Speaker A: So that's awesome. Shout out to Greco. Thanks for talking about. My head is about to burn a piece that I decided to change the number of editions. So that's cool. So thank you, Greco. And thank you to so eturamsa.
00:03:30.604 - 00:03:49.872, Speaker A: I'm gonna say, hey, look, I'm on tv. So here you are again. A big thank you to our artist reporter, Adrian Pokebelly. As I said, probably won't be the last time either with. And I think he's gonna burn. I think he did burn, actually, a bunch of these comics that he did. Look at this super long article.
00:03:49.872 - 00:04:35.866, Speaker A: So thanks to mom also for sending me this link. Why Silicon Valley is so excited about awkward drawings done by AI. Okay, so AI is starting to hit the mainstream, okay? Because it's now on CNBC. So now your friend's dad will be like, hey, what's going on with AI? So you can tell this is a very introductory article. Several new programs, commonly called Generative AI pictures are anything but perfect. They give you infinite, you know, so all the hyperbole that we come to expect from the mainstream media, infinite images to choose from. And there's nothing stopping a human from using a generated image as a starting point for a more polished piece.
00:04:35.866 - 00:05:09.094, Speaker A: And that is actually very important. This is gonna, I think design, like graphic design, is what's really gonna be disrupted by this. Because all of a sudden we saw it with tradscape when he put out a music for a poster for a music show. It looked like it was done. It was nice, but it looked like it was probably put together in ten minutes, maybe less. You know what I mean? And I think anybody's going to be able to create their own music posters soon. Or just your design friend will be able to put spectacular music posters together very quickly.
00:05:09.094 - 00:05:33.734, Speaker A: So let's just take a quick look at this. There are a couple of interesting quotes here. One is by David Bezel, venture capitalist. Next few ventures in the last three months, the words generative AI went from. No one even discussed this to the buzzword du jour. The buzzword du jour. So I've been calling this AI summer.
00:05:33.734 - 00:06:13.642, Speaker A: And I guess summer's over. But yeah, I mean, it kind of puts a nice little, you see the venture capitalist view, last three months or so. It's inspiring people to leave their jobs, start new companies, and dream about a future where AI could power a new generation of tech giants. And so anyways, there is another couple of quotes I want to. There's another AI tool, crayon, generative AI. And the creator of that, Boris Daima, was quoted. The impressive part, even for me, is that it's able to compose new stuff.
00:06:13.642 - 00:06:45.350, Speaker A: It's not just creating old images, it's new things that can be completely different from what it's seen before. And finally, we have Sequoia capital, who many of you have heard of, and they said in a blog post that was actually half made in AI, generative AI has the potential to generate trillions of dollars of economic value. I agree with that. I think design and probably art is probably going to be turned upside down. Okay. It's kind of in the process of being turned upside down. We're seeing the very first iterations of that.
00:06:45.350 - 00:07:37.050, Speaker A: The VC firm predicts that generative AI could change every industry that requires human humans to create original work, from gaming to advertising to law. And finally, Sequoia also notes in the post that the message was partially written by GPT-3 a generative AI that produces text. So probably novels are going to change. So it's back to this idea that this is going to be a tool. As the person on that Twitter spaces mentioned a couple of days ago, it's sort of like if you ignore AI, it's kind of like ignoring digital when Photoshop began, it's kind of the equivalent. And to me, that was a very, that argument really resonated is the word I like to use with that, about that. And here's crayon in action.
00:07:37.050 - 00:08:07.060, Speaker A: So another tool, I've never even heard of Crayon, but so you can check out this article. It's very long, actually, so we can't go into all of it, but thanks, mom, for sending that. And also another very interesting little detail here. Olia Zakoski, back on the scene. Hey, Adrian Pokebelli Mortezos, nFT news from Reddit. This time, a new marketplace for, quote, world renowned artists and quote, prestigious galleries admire nfTs. 5% platform fee and 5% royalties for artists.
00:08:07.060 - 00:08:47.238, Speaker A: Know your customer, aml I hope the NFTs can be seen on object. You know, if they're not seen on object, I think that's going to hurt them. Like, yeah, like, I think, yeah, it's interesting. It seems kind of low the royalties for artists, too. Like, just the fact that the artists can't even set their own royalties, you see the control and that the platform fee. So I guess they're trying to compete somewhat with object and with tea. I'm just making wild assumptions here, but just based on what we see first, you know, first NFT marketplace, I think we have the.
00:08:47.238 - 00:09:33.354, Speaker A: So this is Tezos News, first NFT marketplace dedicated to world leading artists and galleries. So again by Alan Walters. This kind of reads like a press release, doesn't it? It kind of reads like a press release. Like admire art. Put this out and then like is, I want to go to, who's the author? Background in law. Okay, but it's still, but, you know, I don't know if you know how the news works, but sometimes the, you know, the journalist will put like two lines in and then they just put the press release, you know, because this is kind of news. So a unique marketplace offering nfts from traditional world known living artists.
00:09:33.354 - 00:10:08.580, Speaker A: World known living artists. The one of a kind platform already trusted by prominent galleries, revolutionizes the digital art world by finally offering a dedicated space for established artists and leading galleries. So, yeah, the language is a little heated for me, but let's see what they do. I think you just keep an open mind and that's all you can do. I mean, there's no sense rushing to judgment on anything, but the language seems a little heated here. But let's see. I mean, I'm not out to, again, rush, there's no point judging things and overly judging things.
00:10:08.580 - 00:10:46.494, Speaker A: You just see what people do. This is also interesting. By bringing, this was a tweet put out by admirer, by bringing the most prestigious galleries into a market from which they were excluded. Now, I think that's a debatable point. Is anything stopping any gallery from going onto object? That is my question. Is any like so excluded? Really? Is any like. I don't how you know, but let's continue.
00:10:46.494 - 00:11:25.494, Speaker A: It's interesting how the tables have turned, isn't it? Admirers. Admirer gives art lovers the opportunity to collect nfts from the world's most famous and valuable artists. And then they start putting this hierarchy business in here. And yes, we are hierarchical animals, but you see, there's almost like an attempt here to put the trad art world onto the web3 world and to keep that kind of system. And you see it right here. I mean, they put it loud and clear for you, minted by artists sold by the galleries. In other words, the middle person and collected by the collector.
00:11:25.494 - 00:11:46.778, Speaker A: So this is an attempt to kind of keep the gallery model going. It'll be interesting to see. I think they're kind of trying to swim up a river that's flowing in the opposite direction is kind of my take on this, but I could be wrong. I mean, there is a place for curation. Okay. And we're going to get to some. There's a lot of kind of news bits here today.
00:11:46.778 - 00:12:03.132, Speaker A: And here is their website. So again, let's not rush to judgment. Maybe you want to join. I don't know. This was super interesting. Let me just show you this. I was looking at this gallery here, speaking of exhibitions.
00:12:03.132 - 00:12:44.470, Speaker A: Now we're used to on cyber, right? And I'm a little, I'm a little kind of reluctant to use on cyber because I end up, whenever I go on, I'm like 20ft from the entrance and then I have to go another hundred feet. Just like it takes me two minutes just to see an artwork. It's too labor intensive. And then when I see it, it's at an angle and yeah, I can click on it. There's too much being required of me, which is why I haven't done an on cyber gallery of, say, my work or part of my collection. It's just too labor intensive. And I think what these guys are doing, what are they called? The Museum of Wild and Newfangled art.
00:12:44.470 - 00:12:53.166, Speaker A: M o w N A. I really like what they're doing. Here's their exhibition. Okay. So they have a piece here. Here are the artists. Enter exhibition.
00:12:53.166 - 00:13:36.214, Speaker A: You have your artist statement of sorts, and then you just go through the work. Now, I want even more control than this. But to me, this kind of saves a lot of walking around. In trying to replicate this gallery experience, what I want is even more a little risque work here from Lorna Mills, one of our favorite artists here. So anyway, so you can go through, I want even more control where I can actually choose the works myself. What I want to look at almost like Pinterest or like object. Again, I think there is a place for an exhibition.
00:13:36.214 - 00:13:53.814, Speaker A: I think they're closer here, actually. Then on cyber is my kind of little editorial on that. Feel free to disagree with me. Again, I'm not trying to tell anybody how to think here. That's just my take. I like the simplicity and the ease of use. Less is more, in a sense.
00:13:53.814 - 00:14:07.586, Speaker A: Right. We've been talking about how Heidi Rockette might have turned off his notifications. Actually, he didn't. And we have an update. People telling me that they are not getting notifications for my drops on object.com lately. Now we test it out.
00:14:07.586 - 00:14:28.042, Speaker A: And no notification sent by object. Anyone else experienced that issue? Lol. Facepalm so he did not turn off his notifications. It's just object is not working, at least for his account. So not sure what's up there. So just so you know. So just to update on that.
00:14:28.042 - 00:14:43.004, Speaker A: And yeah, we've been missing a ton of Haiti's work here. A couple of really beautiful pieces here. Just. And Niko. And this Niko piece is fascinating to me. You know, why? Okay, first of all, it looks like a portrait. Okay, Niko.
00:14:43.004 - 00:15:15.208, Speaker A: And then you go down here. Sent to Niko Arbogast. So it looks like it was a commission. And there is a great tradition in the history of art, of portraits basically being the way that artists support themselves. People like having their portrait done again, it comes down to these very anthropological, basic, you know, needs. Like, art is a real business, you know, like, it's not just, you know, you know, pretense and, you know, intellectuality. Like, it's a real thing.
00:15:15.208 - 00:15:50.244, Speaker A: People like having their portraits taken or done in art, and that'll never go away. And, you know, like, you know, you could argue that Mona Lisa is a portrait that was probably a commission. Salvador Dali did a ton of these, and he actually hit loggerheads with the or, hit, you know, butted heads with Andre Breton. I think he was actually removed from the surrealist movement because he was making all this money doing portraits. And this was seen by Breton, who was on the left, arguably a communist. I don't want to. I'm not sure about that.
00:15:50.244 - 00:16:16.650, Speaker A: But he opens some of his, you know, casca, say, le surrealisme talk with dear comrades. So he was definitely on the left. And that, you know, Dali was more on the right. So just interesting, the politics there. Anyways, I'm all for portraits, as Leonardo and, you know, Raphael and all the others did. So I just think this is a great business for Haiti. He can do his Petsky filter thing and do people's portraits.
00:16:16.650 - 00:16:40.024, Speaker A: It's brilliant. So I just found that really exciting. And here's another piece, edition of three, only owned by Haiti, interestingly. I mean, maybe that's why he got the heads up on the notifications, because it's pretty unusual for him to not sell any. Usually people come in very quickly. Very, very nice piece here. I'd love to own this piece.
00:16:40.024 - 00:16:57.458, Speaker A: Just. It's called. And again, you see, he minted at 536. No one bought. And that's very rare for Haiti. So, yeah, cryptoronin came in at the last second, but it was too late. Everybody came in a little too late, so.
00:16:57.458 - 00:17:21.443, Speaker A: Right. A beautiful work by beautiful. I put in quotes by die with the most likes. Hard hitting work is how I'd put this, a pill container filled with ground beef. So just kind of another kind of brutal death is just all over. Die with the most likes work. There's just something about it which really hits hard.
00:17:21.443 - 00:17:46.162, Speaker A: It's almost hard to look at, but powerful. Spagelsmaskinen hit the front of object.com. I don't want this to be a news show, but there are some just interesting news events here. And so you can see Spalos maskin in here. You can sort of file through. So congratulations to him. He's on the front page, which is awesome.
00:17:46.162 - 00:18:18.394, Speaker A: Kappin here also is there, and even Glitchtown Arcade. So a few familiar faces here I've never heard of Kikilo, who seems to have some pretty cool work there. And here's that Kappen work that we looked at before. This just went to previous collectors, I believe, so you'll have to make an offer if you want that one. And another work by Kappan that he just posted, which was just kind of out of the ordinary for him. So I thought, oh, just kind of interesting. We can check in passing interesting texts there, too.
00:18:18.394 - 00:18:41.634, Speaker A: Continuing on, this is the person we opened with, Danau Lama. And this was the work that turned my head, that made me check out her super rare. And that piece we opened with here. So a darker work here, clearly in a bathroom. So it's great colors. Let's all give up hope. So, dark work.
00:18:41.634 - 00:19:11.938, Speaker A: This is kind of in that same genre, a different artist. K Juni, departure. Explore the new beginning, starting with the first stop, city of dreams. Again, kind of similar colors, similar feel, that kind of anime, you know, japanese writing, I think, and another one with this similar palette. So I just kind of want to highlight this. This seems to be a bit of a thing, a bit of a genre here. Still available.
00:19:11.938 - 00:19:35.094, Speaker A: This is by moronoise. All different artists here. So this is available on object. And this is just abstract work that I saw on object that I thought was just kind of nice and interesting. This is by Lu lan. So again, just more originality coming across the blockchain here. And we have a couple of pixel works by mech TxT.
00:19:35.094 - 00:19:53.454, Speaker A: It's called deep sleep two, I believe. So a couple of nightworks just want to pass on, pass over, look at. And again, look at how small. 120 by 150 pixels here. This part here. So very interesting. A new work by Dextere.
00:19:53.454 - 00:20:29.494, Speaker A: Nothing moving interestingly. And that's unusual for Dextere, but kind of an interesting portrait. My first JPEG for new collections. Right? Normally Dextere does gifts, so his first JPeG buy for 260, a new drawing by Santiago, which I thought was just kind of attractive. Interesting yellow background, too. It's like doing it on yellow paper again, these kind of Vincent van Gogh esque lines that are just really beautifully done, but totally his own. So very nice new work by sad music for kids.
00:20:29.494 - 00:20:50.964, Speaker A: That illustrator who we saw do the UFO and the fish, I'll show it to you in a second. So this is only a Tezos edition of 100 for the Hen reunion. Kind of a late addition here to the Hen reunion tour. Remember the UFO and the fish. Interesting illustrator, Jakarta based designer, sad music for kids. I had to pick this up. Fax machine.
00:20:50.964 - 00:21:10.064, Speaker A: Fax. Machinovich edges his way onto the show again with a MacDonald's work coming out of a fax machine. Just the combination of all this stuff. I just had to bite. So I picked up a piece. I picked up one of these editions by fax machine. You still have eight left, so lots left there.
00:21:10.064 - 00:21:37.318, Speaker A: I was looking at Lee Krasner here because Sigmar polka times Lee Krasner. And I was like, who's Lee Krasner again? Lee Krasner is the wife of Jackson Pollock also. So she's a painter in her own right. So I brought up her work here. So abstract expressionist as well, doesn't really get much attention. I think in recent years, she has so interesting artist. Actually, I find her work, frankly, as interesting as Pollock.
00:21:37.318 - 00:22:15.722, Speaker A: So that's interesting. So here, our friend Danielle King, she is mixing through AI, Sigmar Polka, who we've discussed, and Lee Krasner. So interesting results. I almost find these kind of, again, kind of scientific in what she's doing. Juan Miro and Joan Mitchell, two famous 20th century artists in combination here, very interesting results. Also by Danielle King, a work by Shilly Preston. Mixing Rousseau in the outdoors here, almost Max Ernst's take on Rousseau with an x copy.
00:22:15.722 - 00:22:45.244, Speaker A: So stable diffusion times, Photoshop just kind of had an interesting feel to it, so I decided to put it in. I just, I like also just this orange wall with, you know, opposite of the color wheel, complementary color of the green and this kind of green landscape. And then the strong contrast with this moving x copy, half cut off. Yeah. Rousseau x copy, stable diffusion. Interesting. And here is clownvamp.
00:22:45.244 - 00:23:17.444, Speaker A: Now clownvamp. Finally, we're going to kind of end with clownvamp here and a couple of other AI works. So he brought in some very interesting insights. My conviction that AI assisted art is a major historical moment is at 100% so 100% conviction, and I feel lucky to be alive in this moment. So he highlighted a few artists. Building a universe with a color red shows what's possible with AI. You can build a style around a theme, a concept, a texture, or even a color.
00:23:17.444 - 00:23:51.460, Speaker A: Nikita Blank uses AI assisted techniques to show us movement. Let your eyes follow the details, the figures, the action, constant motion. So using AI for motion. So this is kind of, we started with, like, the mainstream CNBC article. Now we're going to the bleeding edge with clownvamp here. Hood laboratory delivers us abstract textured worlds that show us the weird and wonderful possible in the latent space. Remember the latent space, the photography for the imagination, the latent space.
00:23:51.460 - 00:24:12.120, Speaker A: Our mind. AI allows us to remix concepts in a way only a human brain can imagine. Interesting idea. So here are abstract textured worlds by hood laboratory. So, again, it's good to just consume as much of this stuff as possible. These are beautiful here. Textures, patterns.
00:24:12.120 - 00:24:39.134, Speaker A: AI learns concepts and as a result, can assist in creating intricate details beyond what we can imagine as possible. We saw that almost in strange things work, that almost. Rococo dome work with the Louis Vietn logo. Here we have Lily illo, who uses with incredible success with their series that is immersed in patterns and textures. Every corner demands to be touched. Yeah, like, look at all this detail here. These works.
00:24:39.134 - 00:24:56.022, Speaker A: Look at this. It's. Yeah, and it looks familiar, but new at the same time. So pretty spectacular. The dress and the wallpapers. AI doesn't have to be figurative. There's an increasing number of artists using it to create amazing abstract work.
00:24:56.022 - 00:25:19.640, Speaker A: Mother Louisiane does it with their iceberg Tornette series, which the draping of a net and the resulting textures to create soulful pieces. So just some interesting abstracts here using AI. And that's a wrap. So interesting from clownvap. And just a couple that I came across on Twitter. Javier Tomao. Red flowers.
00:25:19.640 - 00:25:41.604, Speaker A: Some more beautiful botanical works. Another botanical work by CCddbb, who I think we saw yesterday. And Red Rum also sold this one of one. This is actually a pretty cool one. Man finds himself in the body of the robot, and the robot in the body of a man. Redrum 2022. This went for 250 tezos.
00:25:41.604 - 00:26:00.144, Speaker A: A one of one. Again, this could go on the COVID of a science fiction pulp magazine from the 1940s. And even the theme is straight out of, like, galaxy Science fiction magazine or whatever the case is. Anyways, that's your update for today. My name is Adrian Pokebelli. Until next time, take care.
