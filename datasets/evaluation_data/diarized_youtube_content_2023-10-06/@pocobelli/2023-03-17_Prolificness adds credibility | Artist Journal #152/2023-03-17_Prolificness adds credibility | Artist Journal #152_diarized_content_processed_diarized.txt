00:00:03.920 - 00:00:51.110, Speaker A: Never a dull moment here, ladies and gentlemen. It is haircut day, so I am going to have to run through this episode by necessity. So I'm excited, and I'm sure you're excited about that. Artist Journal, March 17, 2023. Broadcasting to the world from Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pokebelly, and we have a beautiful work by Lorna Mills here, a what I would, you know, once again call a boundary breaking work. As far as what I've seen from Lorna Mills, and as I've mentioned many times before, I know Lorna Mills work from Wolf Leiser, who runs the digital art museum here in Berlin.
00:00:51.110 - 00:01:42.662, Speaker A: Just having. You know, I think I went to a talk when I first came to Berlin maybe six months after, in 2017. I came here in 2016, but I think I saw Wolf for the first time in 2017, and he mentioned Lorna Mills, and that's where I heard of her, as I've told you before. And so I've always known her. And for those that might not know, let me actually just quickly show you the person. I mean, you probably recognize these works as well, even if you're not that familiar. I mean, Lorna Mills has done this style of, you know, the hard mask, you might say, with the pixelated mask here, with the solid color, and then often, not always, but as you can see here, you know, subject matter of questionable taste, which, as you can see here, a very interesting artist.
00:01:42.662 - 00:02:01.992, Speaker A: Okay. Pushing the boundaries. See if we can bring that back up. So, here, she put out a work called Devil's Lake, and I'm going to magnify it for you so you can see what's going on. Cause it's a little dark, and maybe you can't see it. So kind of a different take on the whole style. And, I mean, it's pretty exciting.
00:02:01.992 - 00:02:42.950, Speaker A: It's. I think it's 500 tezos, which these days, I'm guessing, is, like, maybe a little under $600, you know? Yeah, I mean, I keep saying it. It's kind of got the, like, you know, as I like to put on my hat of, oh, running form function. If I ran an institution, I'd be like, ooh, there's a little acquisition for us. I don't know how it works for them. They probably can't just do it willy nilly, but maybe they do have people in charge of acquisitions. All to say, it's super cool because we still see consistency in the style, as you can see here, with the kind of the hard, pixelated, moving mask with a solid color.
00:02:42.950 - 00:03:09.008, Speaker A: But we see a different version of it here, and a poetic version. And interestingly, as well, from the subject matter point of view, it is not of questionable taste here. So I'm a big fan of where this is going. I'm a big fan of her work regardless. But I think this is really interesting. It's kind of like, in a weird way. You know, it's almost a weird kind of.
00:03:09.008 - 00:03:32.228, Speaker A: I don't want to call it impressionism of sorts. I mean, that's a. Maybe a bridge too far. But all to say, it's just a really interesting work. And it's the process that I like a lot, too, because I feel like you can do this process in a million different ways. I mean, one other like. Or variations where you could do clouds in the sky, and you're kind of doing the same thing.
00:03:32.228 - 00:04:07.376, Speaker A: One other thing to note here is the color. It's almost monochromatic in the sense that it's almost all basically this blue, which is also kind of interesting. It looks like a lake at night. So, anyways, devil's Lake, 500 tezos, $600. And that is available on object and just minted, I believe, last night. And you're still getting the deals on object in terms of valuation, because remember her super rare works that just sold for two ETH, which, you know, is $3,200. So quite the disparity there.
00:04:07.376 - 00:04:44.116, Speaker A: This is only 20%, you know, and you could put this nice and big on the wall there of your institution. So, anyway, we're having fun here. This is exciting. I'm very excited about this, which is runetune, just chiming in that I would totally watch and enjoy a full episode on your dissecting Ballard's crash. And I was mentioning the introduction to crash. You know, I have had this kind of, like, this show. I've had this in the back of my head for a while, idea of doing, I think I was going to call it lectures on the atrocity exhibition.
00:04:44.116 - 00:05:20.424, Speaker A: Because it's kind of a mysterious work, which is also by JG Ballard. And it's kind of. The roots of crash can be kind of. If you understand the atrocity exhibition, from my perspective, maybe people disagree with me out there. If you understand the atrocity exhibition, then I think then crash is kind of a. You understand everything that's going on in terms of. Conceptually, I would argue, for the most part, it's kind of a novelistic version of a very experimental thing that's going on in the atrocity exhibition, which is also a novel, but far more experimental.
00:05:20.424 - 00:05:41.760, Speaker A: I'd argue. It's Ballard's response to naked lunch. As we always say here, artists respond to each other. And I would argue the atrocity exhibition is Ballard's response to naked lunch by William Burroughs. And he even got William Burroughs to do the. I think that was a preface to the atrocity exhibition. So anyway, it is.
00:05:41.760 - 00:05:56.440, Speaker A: I'm glad to hear that. And I'm glad. What a cool audience this is. Yes, we'd love to hear more about crash. That's awesome. So anyways, that is. Let's put that one a little closer to us on the shelf in the pipeline.
00:05:56.440 - 00:06:14.752, Speaker A: That is super interesting, and I'd love to do that, you know. Yeah, there's a few kind of subjects I'd like to tackle, so one at a time here. Anyways, thank you for the comment. Rune tune. And look at four, like. Yeah, so I'm excited that you're excited, everybody. For those four or five people here, I'm excited that you're excited.
00:06:14.752 - 00:06:32.608, Speaker A: Just like this show, it started with like ten people. And, you know, it's only. Yeah, you know, I'm okay with small. Let's put it that way in terms of, you know, just, it doesn't take many people. Anyways, let's keep going here. You know, human boy love all the camp cram artworks that have come out. Very cool to see my work.
00:06:32.608 - 00:07:03.474, Speaker A: So human boy is antiquities. The one where we saw kind of the mosaic filter. Rosatio also commented, yes, it is a continuity of my experimental approach from the previous series, their small works compared to my regular ones. Been experimenting with the low reserve price, too. Thank you for your kind words. So yeah, we're commenting on the colors and everything working the mech TXT and everything else. So it's beautiful what Roseto is working on.
00:07:03.474 - 00:07:35.992, Speaker A: And I think this low reserve thing is quite interesting because again, you put it low enough, you're more than likely, if you have enough of a quote unquote brand recognition, you're going to get a bid. And the thing with ETH is, is like 0.07 ETH. I mean, 0.01 would say be $170, you know, $100, $110 is not a horrible outcome, is it? You know, so again, very interesting. And Ed Marolla, the whole camp thing is delicious, and we're going to return to it. Thanks for the comment, Ed.
00:07:35.992 - 00:08:14.584, Speaker A: And I'm still trying to. And I think this is maybe purposefully irrational from Santiago, quote, how hard is it to be irrational? Piano, piano, piano, dear. So I think he's being purposefully irrational here, you know, I'm always the last person to understand these things. Anyways, I thought this was a great comment here. And I think purple drank actually was the person who tweeted this out or retweeted this? Ex Nardo da Vinci, 20 paintings, 6000 drawings. Rembrandt, 600 paintings, 2000 drawings. Van Gogh, 900 paintings, 1200 drawings.
00:08:14.584 - 00:08:49.052, Speaker A: And you know what's astonishing about this? You might not realize, like, most of the Van Goghs that we know and cherish were all made in the last, like, from age 37 to 40, I believe, basically the last three or four years of his life. Okay. And then you go back to, like, age 35, 36. You see those really early ones where it's like people peeling potatoes, where he hasn't quite congealed his style. So he just painted nonstop, basically. I mean, 900 paintings, let's say three years, basically a painting a day with a break here and there. Okay.
00:08:49.052 - 00:09:17.210, Speaker A: So, yeah, and I think, you know what? If you have kind of, like, the eye, what you could call the eye or whatever, innate talent, if you have a little bit of talent, I think if anybody starts painting a painting a day, like, basically non stop, it's gonna go somewhere. It's really gonna go somewhere. Warhol, 9000 paintings, 12,000 drawings. Basquiat, 600 paintings, 1500 drawings. And I think he died at 27. So that's a nice output there. And this is the point, though.
00:09:17.210 - 00:10:01.834, Speaker A: Don't worry about scarcity. Just create. Because in the NFT scene, because it's so financialized, there is a sense that, oh, you shouldn't release too much because that will hurt your, you know, your scarcity, you know, and I'm completely in 120% agreement with ex Nardo here that don't worry about scarcity in these, you know, you're in good company, is what Xnardo's saying. And in my world, actually being prolific is a. It's actually is makes you. It's more persuasive for me, when I see an artist who is putting out works left and right and all over the place I go, this person knows what they're doing to me. It creates credibility.
00:10:01.834 - 00:10:22.402, Speaker A: So. And I think about that myself. I don't release nearly as much as I'd like to release. So I'm trying to fix that, actually. I am reworking, rejigging my schedule outside of this program, so I may be able to do that. So all to say, very interesting comment from the tezo sphere. This is kind of interesting.
00:10:22.402 - 00:10:52.664, Speaker A: TZ creator art. Always double check all these links and don't connect unless, you know, what it is. I just saw this on Twitter. I have never connected to it, so be very careful. Early access users will now be able to create and deploy contracts on tezos, mint tokens with contracts and even list them for sale. So what this looks like to me is Manifold XYZ, doesn't it? I don't think we tackled this yesterday. This looks like Manifold XYZ.
00:10:52.664 - 00:11:09.452, Speaker A: And maybe we did look at this. Maybe and then we had the popple comment. So anyways, this continues. TZ creator art. So anyways, it continues. So we're going to track that object.com exciting news.
00:11:09.452 - 00:12:00.104, Speaker A: We now accept payments in ETH ETH whales. You're officially welcome here. So that is interesting because you know what that makes me wonder, and maybe it's a bridge too far. But what that makes me wonder is what if you can mint on ETH like again, I feel like the promised land for a platform like object is if you can basically to go multi chain like we were talking about form function. What if you can mint on dot and all these sort of things? Because object has a great website and the notifications, I would argue, which I don't know why Opensea hasn't emulated that. I'm sure they have their reasons, but that kind of Facebook red notification thing, yeah, I think it's a very powerful. So anyways, all to say Ethereum is you can now pay with Ethereum.
00:12:00.104 - 00:12:34.368, Speaker A: So we are seeing small steps and there's Piero. We are seeing small steps towards kind of a multi chain situation, although this is a very small step, but it's interesting nonetheless. Speaking of form function. So we got a very interesting comment here. Pelizard de Volpeido, his beautiful name. Regarding form function, they probably put their funds in the wrong bank and VC's didn't want to feed them any longer due to the current market conditions. Tazo's shutdowns are more theatrical and far less white collar ish.
00:12:34.368 - 00:13:12.460, Speaker A: Probably referring to hen, as we all know. So I thought this was a great theory that the reason, maybe that's the reason why form function kind of folded so quickly and just said okay, we're done here, is maybe the money just dried up and the fact that it's on Solana also kind of a heavily VC chain by reputation, a chain that has a lot of projects funded by VC's that would also add to that whole idea. So great theory here. I tend to. I would suspect you're right, Pelizard. Thank you for the comment. Very interesting.
00:13:12.460 - 00:13:53.194, Speaker A: And just on the whole, form function then I saw this interesting tweet from a collector or maybe a gallery house of deluxe gallery. Dear form function, unfortunate news to hear that you'll be shutting down. As an artist and collector, I've got a few concerns. There is no plan to make it easy for collectors to move their collected pieces out of form function. This should be your number one priority. So I haven't spent much time on Solana, but I'm kind of surprised to read here that it might be the case that you, you know, your form function works don't show up on exchange art. I just assumed that it was sort of like, you know, form function is like, let's say tea, and it shows up on object.
00:13:53.194 - 00:14:21.632, Speaker A: And I even so does exchange art not show form function works. I'm surprised to hear that. And that does seem to be an issue, because if they're not, then where on earth are you going to show your form function works? This seems to be rush only allowing two weeks before closing the doors. Doesn't give much time. Again, feeding into, is it Pelizardo? Let's just look here. I want to get the name right. Feeding into Pelizard's theory here, it seems rushed.
00:14:21.632 - 00:15:13.768, Speaker A: What if an artist or collector is traveling or unable to take care of business before closing? It is very kind of, you know, it's kind of back to the crypto fly by nightishness of crypto. On the other hand, I think what kind of makes it bullish for us as artists is to me, as I see this narrative of, like, you know, marketplaces shutting down, like, can, you know, a year ago and then now form function and this sort of thing, that's exactly kind of what legends are made of. As far as, you know, this whole scene. I mean, it's like those were the early days when things were kind of collapsing all around them. You didn't know, you know, and so all this sort of thing. So it kind of makes me a little bit bullish that it's kind of like we're in the early days of something and it may even disappear. But I doubt it.
00:15:13.768 - 00:15:40.664, Speaker A: I think a lot of us kind of doubt it. Again, it's surprisingly small community, isn't it? Right? Like, we recognize. Like, it's very possible I could look down here and find people you or me might recognize in the comments. Let's quickly just finish this. There is not a mention of shutting down on your homepage. You should have a big above fold post or button that makes it easy for artists and collectors to protect their assets. I think that's true.
00:15:40.664 - 00:16:05.312, Speaker A: And that's a very good point. Because imagine I feel, you know what I thought to myself as I went to form function. I brought it up here. You know what I thought to myself, wow, I sure am glad I didn't collect on form function because who wants this headache, you know? And I bid on some works by Adelia. I didn't win. And now I'm like, oh, that's a relief. So what does that say? Right? Good etiquette would dictate to make the transition more seamless.
00:16:05.312 - 00:16:37.060, Speaker A: I believe you need to be a bit more accountable with how the shutting down is handled. You owe it to the art community. Yeah, I mean if people are spending money on the platform, yeah, I kind of agree. Like, and whether it's the VC's or, and nobody expects you to work for free, but then maybe the VC's should be more accountable if that's what's going on there. So I agree with House of deluxe. Like, you know, there's, and here's the website, you know, so there's a little, you know, link here. But really I totally agree, you know, migrate, a big migrate button.
00:16:37.060 - 00:17:04.144, Speaker A: Migrate your works. We're shutting down. It would be nice, wouldn't it? Anyways, it's a good looking website. So again, it seems unfortunate that, and then the name and the brand recognition, it seems unfortunate. It's got a nice feel to it, you know. And again, here's like the detail page you might call it, where there's a work on it and everything. So anyway, and people are still bidding I guess as of two days ago.
00:17:04.144 - 00:17:29.072, Speaker A: So there you have it. So the latest on form function and agor, NFT. Big shout out to agor. He had an NFT art market update which I thought was actually really interesting stuff. I've been wondering. So foundation had $136,000 of sales, I believe that's what that says. And 1000 transactions, super rare.
00:17:29.072 - 00:17:56.518, Speaker A: I wonder if this is related to those x copy works that went. Or maybe it was something else. $864,000 of sales. So you know, five or six times foundation at least. If this is, I'm not sure if this is in a week or in a month. I would love to get that information here too. Agor, if you're watching this, maybe say for the month or for the week or for this date, to this date, would it be even better? That would be cool.
00:17:56.518 - 00:18:23.034, Speaker A: Object $51,000 effects $31,000. So anyways, isn't this interesting to see all this information here? And the top trending artists. So here you can see it's super rare. Top trending artists, they're strange thing, videodrome, rip cash. So, you know, and it looks like, see, there's a $432,000 sale. I think that was videodrome. So sometimes super rare.
00:18:23.034 - 00:18:45.266, Speaker A: So if they didn't have that here, it's a bit of a different story. They wouldn't be hitting it out of the park as much. And you see here, they're up 400%. So, yeah, this is probably regularly, like, I'm guessing, like, maybe $200,000, and then that's a little closer to foundation. So, Agor, I love the stats. I'd love to keep seeing that. Thank you for reading.
00:18:45.266 - 00:19:03.222, Speaker A: This is great. Top trending artists on foundation. Spagels, maskinen there. So this is also a great way to discover artists, isn't it? So a great service here from agor. Just distilling it for everybody. And look at this sale. I just saw this in the effectshash sales bot, you know, Zancane, this generative artist continues.
00:19:03.222 - 00:20:02.924, Speaker A: We saw the big sale on object 131 thousand, $500 on FX hash here for this. I believe it's a one of one generative artwork. So, you know, it's not just a one off. What happened on object one? It sounds like this artist is consistently making multi tens of thousands of dollar sales for works. So just showing a real market for generative art, like, you know, and who knows? Like, this could be, for all we know, like, traditional art money, right? Because I think when Tezos goes to, like, art Basel, I think often they'll show someone like Zancane or Zancan's work, and I think that audience really resonates with that. So just kind of an interesting, interesting sale there continues. Unknown collector has put out a world on foundation.
00:20:02.924 - 00:20:22.734, Speaker A: Unknown self and unknown collector is always interesting. And here's that work by Venta, which we were looking at yesterday, already has a bid of 0.3. You know, I really like these bids because to me, it just shows. And 0.2, like, this is. I. You know, and it's kind of, maybe it's sad for the artists.
00:20:22.734 - 00:20:36.334, Speaker A: This is the new normal. I. But I think it's great because, I mean, these are still, like, 0.3 ETH is still 800, $900. Like, look at how many are being bid on here. Like, you have nine works. This is terrifying.
00:20:36.334 - 00:20:56.678, Speaker A: This eraserhead, I was going to put it in. I almost wanted to start with it, but it's just too terrifying. I didn't want to give people nightmares there. But check out in the mouth of madness there by eraserhead. Anyways, we're seeing a ton of bids here. So this is impressive. Kazuhiro Ihara and again, just like these, you know, between 0.1
00:20:56.678 - 00:21:20.834, Speaker A: and 0.5 ETH so far, and they may go higher. But all to say, that price point, as we were discussing with Rosaceo's work, I think it's cool. And, like, having just sold some work, the peloponnesian war stuff, it's good. And then maybe you get some bidding, you get collectors. This is all good. You know, speaking on the other side of the scale, though, look at oxine Sotheby's.
00:21:20.834 - 00:22:17.470, Speaker A: And isn't this a wonderful story? Like, when we think, like, when I started this show in August, Oxine seemed to have a nice thing going on on object, kind of a nice thing. I think going on on Opensea was just starting to kind of break through the new, what I'd call the more recent style. You know, just evolving into that more recent style that we're very familiar with now. And here we are, you know, in March and Sotheby's. So to me, this is the promise of this space. Because, again, going out in the contemporary art world in Berlin here, it's not like you hear of people who are unknown six months ago and selling at Sotheby's or eight months ago, or quote unquote unknown or kind of known, and then all of a sudden, they're being auctioned at Sotheby's. This is the promise of this space and why I continue to be very excited.
00:22:17.470 - 00:22:46.350, Speaker A: And you gotta love, frankly, this image that, you know, Oxym just kind of keeps evolving here. Could easily just put his skull, but put this beautiful kind of digital noise here, getting better and better. It feels so painterly, doesn't it? It feels so painterly. And that's not an easy thing to do with digital. I love it. Go go Litus with a super interesting collab with native Ed. So two people were familiar with here.
00:22:46.350 - 00:22:55.302, Speaker A: It will be released in the coming weeks. So. Looks exciting. A bit of a windows 95 feeling. And there's the folder. It's gonna be interesting to see. And.
00:22:55.302 - 00:23:15.838, Speaker A: Yeah, and there you see the hourglass and everything. I guess you don't see the hourglass anymore, do you? So another artist that I haven't seen before, maybe you've seen before. Brutal ETH. Brutal ETH. Marco Bonafe. I don't think we've looked at their work before. This just came out on super rare.
00:23:15.838 - 00:23:32.374, Speaker A: It is at 65. Started at. Was there an auction? Well, these are just offers. And then the reserve price was met after a few offers at 0.65. So now, I guess. And then it was one for 0.65. So let's look at what this is default.
00:23:32.374 - 00:23:56.774, Speaker A: And here is the work. And I just thought it was quite interesting. Like, I have no idea how this was made. It almost has a bit of a noise feeling to it when you look in here with all the different colors. I guess we'll risk opening this large. And here you see a bit of a windows 95, for lack of better term, you know, retro operating system. Look to it.
00:23:56.774 - 00:24:17.394, Speaker A: Let's see if we can. You see the x there, close window. Default sounds also like that. So let's see if we can zoom in. Because you see the noise here. It's almost like the noise filter has been added to this, or for lack of better term, just speculation. And it gives it texture.
00:24:17.394 - 00:24:49.988, Speaker A: And again, this is noise that often you are trying to not have in your photographs. But, you know, it's kind of like we're back to this. It's not a bug, it's a feature. And here's some interesting, you know, splashes, you know, and you wonder, was this done physically? And then it sampled across and then brought in as a layer, you know, so interesting. Or maybe it was just all physical or, sorry, digital, which is also possible these days. So again, interesting texture here. So we kind of zoom in to get the deets on this work.
00:24:49.988 - 00:25:19.258, Speaker A: Interesting contrast here with this noise. And then a solid color here and there. Again, some more, you know, retro operating system references. So, Marco Bonafe from Italy. And this was an interesting thing, I thought, as well. The task of art today is to bring chaos into order. Theodore Adorno, a famous marxist, what would you call him? Intellectual, I guess.
00:25:19.258 - 00:26:15.220, Speaker A: Critical theorist, I guess we'd call him a theorist. And from the 1940s or fifties or so, or maybe the thirties as well, I'm not sure. The task of art today is to bring chaos into order. And you know what I thought when I read that is this conversation we were having on rationality yesterday and this idea of spagels maskinen having the screensaver outside the screen and this delightful irrationality and contrasting that with the rationality of driving and how we kind of need to be rational to a certain degree. So it's kind of, you know, another way of reading this is bringing the irrational into the rational, right? So anyways, very interesting artist Marco Bonifai. And I don't. I doubt this is new but neurocolor posted this, and I'd never seen it before, so I thought I'd share it.
00:26:15.220 - 00:26:38.136, Speaker A: There are a few artists here. I kind of found a little corner, I think Uksin had retweeted something from machine, and I found this whole little crazy corner of, like, the Twitter art scene. And so neurocolor showed up in there. And so, anyways, we were happy and we didn't know it. Just kind of a cool work from neurocolor. And here's some work by machine. And this isn't new.
00:26:38.136 - 00:27:06.220, Speaker A: This was minted ten months ago, but I just don't think we've looked at it. And I'm always trying to find other artists, so we're not showing the same people every time. And pretty interesting artist. So, again, this is machine, and this is called mountain dogs machine with an s here. And, yeah, digital art, not too many details. Done in 2022, listed for seven. No bids yet, but interesting artist.
00:27:06.220 - 00:27:32.852, Speaker A: And here we see more from machine. And there you have it. So here you see like a snail with a cigarette almost, you know, like the airbrush, almost kind of campy. And we're going to get to the camp e works in a second. And so, anyways, here's just a quick look at machine, and I think I brought up a couple other works here. So this is called no title, which is kind of interesting. No title, I think 0.5
00:27:32.852 - 00:27:58.774, Speaker A: ETH and a suggestive looking snail here with some hearts and whatnot. So, anyways, sold for 0.5 ETH to jeezy. And so anyways, just kind of interesting work here. Here's another for sale for 0.7, listed just actually in December here. So a fairly recent work for machine.
00:27:58.774 - 00:28:27.220, Speaker A: So just kind of interesting, isn't it? You know, Anthill here. I mean, just a wild sort of artist. So, anyways, here's another one that I found in this little corner of Twitter Em or emi m hazydream. So this is on Nifty Gateway. And actually, this just came out a few weeks ago, February 24, original listing, $495. Let's just see if we can make this bigger. And I believe.
00:28:27.220 - 00:28:45.030, Speaker A: Yeah, and it moves. Let's see if it can move. I guess we'll only get the moving version here. I have other works by Em or Emi. So a lot of pop culture references in here. Here we go. Almost like Dali's melting clock a little bit there, and some stretched out figures.
00:28:45.030 - 00:29:07.824, Speaker A: So, again, using just a lot of kind of pop culture, zaniness is always what I'd call this wildness. Here. So just kind of interesting. And they all seem to kind of go well together. Just like, again, I almost want to call this zaniness. And you see the nice pixelation in the background as well. So just a whole bunch of kind of, you know, it almost feels like.
00:29:07.824 - 00:29:21.472, Speaker A: What do you call it? Web art. Right. And just kind of posting all these kind of crazy gifts here. You haven't even masked out the glasses. UFO everything. Orange days. Reserve of three and a half ETH.
00:29:21.472 - 00:29:30.484, Speaker A: So not cheap at all. And here's another one. Reserve of five ETH. I thought, these are great. These are old ones by. I think it's Emi. Look at this.
00:29:30.484 - 00:29:42.300, Speaker A: I don't think there's volume. Just make sure. No volume. But look at this. Bosch or Bruegel. Peter Bruegel is what we have here. And kind of playing off of it.
00:29:42.300 - 00:30:03.284, Speaker A: And I think just really cool. And even making this guy move. So some of these people are moving and then mixed in, I think just a really kind of fun remix. Just cool work is what I'd call this, the Neverland. And here's another one with the Mona Lisa cy Vogue reserve of five eths. So not cheap. Very cool.
00:30:03.284 - 00:30:19.244, Speaker A: And then you see Mickey Mouse shaking someone's hand on top. So again, just kind of wild stuff. Kind of reminiscent of web art. Or if anybody has a better name for it, feel free to leave a comment. Look at the past and future. Yeah, that seems to be what this is. It's a mix of the past and the future.
00:30:19.244 - 00:30:42.094, Speaker A: On to Camp creme. And look at this beautiful work by Murlacos. Out of the shadows here is Morlakos and his classic kind of iconography here, but kind of. I can't tell if this. I think it's a digital painting, but it almost looks physical with these brushes here. But I think it's. I think it's digital.
00:30:42.094 - 00:30:57.938, Speaker A: And here we have the crazy lion. So. And, you know, the kind of campy colors, I guess, is where this is coming from. Created by Morlakos in 2023. Morlakos e l leon. So this is probably Morlakos here. And there's the lion.
00:30:57.938 - 00:31:18.662, Speaker A: Buy now for three. Edition of 50 for Camp cram. I think a pretty nice work here is more of the campy. What a festival they've had out there at Mikey Wilson. I can't help but think this is a massive success. Tazo Creme. Also for the camp creme doing campy works here a la Susan sontag.
00:31:18.662 - 00:31:45.674, Speaker A: And here is another one with Kappa. Kappa's Kappa sages. Traditional. You know, work with the knives or the guns and everything kind of the gang look, but again, with very campy colors. And there's a show tip of the hat to Beziah here and the Dennis Rodman work. So anyways, ton of fun here and the fishnet almost armband there. Okay.
00:31:45.674 - 00:32:17.004, Speaker A: Edition of 20 now available for eight on secondary. And it looks like the final work by Sabato for Camp Creme. This brilliant juxtaposition of these angels with classic cars and quotes from the old testaments. This is from psalms. I said, you are God's children of the most high, but you will die like mortals and fall like princes. So just a really cool juxtaposition. I ended up buying a couple of these.
00:32:17.004 - 00:32:34.824, Speaker A: You know, it's real. I like it that it's a series. When I saw the first one, you know, it felt like a cool one off. But when you see the series as a collector, you just go, I want to have the whole thing. But now if you want to get the first one, it's 90 tezos, so you pay for waiting. Anyways. And one more thing here.
00:32:34.824 - 00:32:51.040, Speaker A: Mid journey v five. Interesting. Using the brand new mid journey. I think that's brand new and processed with. It is brand new and processed with deluxe paint. Four. So this, you know, and you wonder how quickly this can be done.
00:32:51.040 - 00:33:22.684, Speaker A: So I guess you can import layers into deluxe paint. I'm not sure how that works, but pretty interesting. And you gotta love the text here. So, Asaph cabriolet, very cool. Now it's 45, I think I picked up the last one on primary NSX four told. So we looked at this the other day, and again, you see, I think I picked this one up too, so I don't think there are any left. So anyways, this is a great series here.
00:33:22.684 - 00:33:40.040, Speaker A: And this is the one. Now you got to pay 90 or make an offer on it. So edition of 15. Awesome, awesome work. So here are some of the other new ones. And not a number weighed in with this AI dog head. So anyways, the fun continues over here at Camp Creme.
00:33:40.040 - 00:33:52.432, Speaker A: What an awesome week they've had. And here is not a number. He's a dog. Absolutely. By now for 420, I believe. So anyways, hilarious. And here's another one by Ugo.
00:33:52.432 - 00:34:20.724, Speaker A: I thought this is a pretty cool one. Edition of three, still available for two tazos. And here, what do you call these again? I used to have a pair of these. It's escaping me with the balloon dogs. And anyways, so kind of gaudy, kind of campy couples days in agreement. Others not tutezos. And here seems to be a portrait of Mikey Wilson, the, you know, the initiator, the founder of Camp Creme, we might say.
00:34:20.724 - 00:34:45.028, Speaker A: And here is a portrait by Dextere with a pixelated portrait, his second piece for Camp creme. And here is another one by Moda Mt and purple drank. It's called fashion. You wouldn't get it. So anyway, more campyness from the. As part of the festival this time. Moda Mt and purple drank and some fashion guys from.
00:34:45.028 - 00:34:59.062, Speaker A: And this is in the drank Dao actually. And here's one more. Eterna cogitatio. Well, this is my humble contribution to camp creme event. And this is Pomelo. So this looks like Microsoft paint or something. Very cool.
00:34:59.062 - 00:35:13.150, Speaker A: And camp Creme. And there is a little bit of leopard skin and everything. So there you have it. Buy for 322 edition of 14. And actually there is one more. Susan's technicolor dream. I think she would have loved this.
00:35:13.150 - 00:35:36.204, Speaker A: Like I haven't read barely any Susan's own tag but it's hard to for her, you know. But for all the Susan Sontag people out there, I think she would have loved this. This is by Louis, Susan's technicolor dream. Like what an. What an awesome tribute to Susan Sontag. Like I you she would have. Art is a form of consciousness quote from Susan Sontag.
00:35:36.204 - 00:35:59.022, Speaker A: So I'm sure she would have loved this. Buy for three tazos from Louis. So moving on. Just an interesting work here with noise by dj pants. Kind of a CMYK color scheme. Just an interesting abstract here. Burning trash.
00:35:59.022 - 00:36:10.454, Speaker A: Fragile beauty. Useful for scaring the person next to you. Fortezos edition of four. A very tiny addition. Board me social club. Fat face freddy. Nice painterliness down here.
00:36:10.454 - 00:36:30.414, Speaker A: And just an interesting work here from board me social club. So unusual and surreal as usual. And changing the north face there logo. Nicely painted here. Vampire stuff. Interesting. So this is probably a famous reference to a famous vampire or something.
00:36:30.414 - 00:36:54.362, Speaker A: Quilanina, this interesting, what I want to call visionary artist out of Peru and Argentina makes another digital work here, camp creme. And actually participates in Camp creme. I didn't realize this was part of Camp creme. So very cool. And there you have it. So you see it in the colors, I'm guessing. And there is the leopard print and everything.
00:36:54.362 - 00:37:16.704, Speaker A: So anyways, Quila Nina. This is edition of ten for 950, still available on primary. And continuing on one bit horror. Do the gods look at us from time to time? They must. However, what are they looking for? And do we want their gaze? So, more work by one bit. Horror on Instagram. A very unusual kind of mysterious artist.
00:37:16.704 - 00:37:47.014, Speaker A: And something from KHC, a one of one. This sold, it looks like, for 57 tezos to Haiti. Rocket. A one of one. And let's just see if we can get the volume here. It almost looks like clippy or something. Meet paper.
00:37:47.014 - 00:38:10.954, Speaker A: Paper dares you to write on his face. Paper bets you won't do it. Paper thinks you're scared of commitment. Anyways, so cool work from Kurt Hussle collective. More interesting experimentation from side hustle Escherich. So, playing maybe with Mc Escher as a source here, we kind of see it with this sideways staircase, really. I love this experimentation.
00:38:10.954 - 00:38:34.526, Speaker A: I mean, because, again, the easy thing would be to actually add color and all this stuff, but we're getting challenged here by side hustle. So very cool. Made with graphics, too. So retro tools and pixel nachos, I think, is the name of the artist. 2023 edition of five for five tazos. And also playing with stairs. Ed Marolla under Temple.
00:38:34.526 - 00:39:11.734, Speaker A: So, playing with these ancient themes and these digital, it's a great contrast, this ancient subject matter, and then these very kind of modern digital, you know, sampled brushes or whatever is going on here. And here we see someone in the background there. Let me see. There we go. Here we see some couple of eyes here, just barely a few pixels, you know, selected to make a face. And we see this woman going down the stairs here into these fuzzy pixels of this temple, and it. And a devil like figure, and there is some dithering there.
00:39:11.734 - 00:39:37.444, Speaker A: So super interesting. Very rich, isn't it? Let's actually just quickly look and see if this sold great colors, by the way, too. 90 tazos. So Ed continues to sell on a daily basis, again, making. He's doing well. Like, I mean, if you're selling and making work every day and it's selling and you're bringing in $200 us a day, that starts to turn into a real salary there. So that's pretty cool.
00:39:37.444 - 00:39:59.604, Speaker A: Stippin pixel. So another work in the prismatic City series, prism four joy. And just a very cool. Just another cool experiment with pixels from a cool pixel artist. And we go here, and we see the different ones. We see five of them here. So they're still all available for five.
00:39:59.604 - 00:40:20.412, Speaker A: And they're very low editions. And Kappin's gift shop, I guess this sold out tres leche, or this went to Epinalga. This was just transferred. So a pretty cool, good looking pixel work. Maybe it was for a birthday made using with deluxe paint two and gimp. I'll have to try gimp again. I haven't tried it in years.
00:40:20.412 - 00:40:43.314, Speaker A: Vanilla flan. Here is another one which I missed the other day. So doing the desserts here with a little more color. So just interesting. This sold, are they still going for ten? They're still going for ten. And this sold on the 15 March and chocolate ice cream pop. And this probably went for ten and took a while, took 15 hours.
00:40:43.314 - 00:41:06.838, Speaker A: But they do sell within a day, so not bad at all. Chocolate ice cream pop. Nice treatment here. And again, kind of static in the background here and dynamic over here. Great contrast. Really adds to the whole piece. DMT vision, who is a super old school Tezos artist, or at least one of the kind of the early artists you come across when you first come to object conveyor belt, the ego factory.
00:41:06.838 - 00:41:33.630, Speaker A: So, you know, this kind of plays with a lot of DMT visions, themes. I thought this was actually quite a powerful work. I mean, you know, everybody on the treadmill of life here, kind of a dark work, but there's some light there too. Available for 950. Pretty low edition. DMT vision, I think, traditionally does very high editions, I think, if I remember right, Ezra Eslin. So this went really quickly.
00:41:33.630 - 00:41:52.088, Speaker A: Error. A very modern looking illustration. So here you see the curved screen, which is hilarious. And then some old, what looks like windows errors. They will kill you. And there you see the cigarette smoke treatment. Is also really interesting, kind of half opaque.
00:41:52.088 - 00:42:14.484, Speaker A: And you see a woman at her desktop with of course trademark blood on the keyboard and mouse and coming out of the drink and everything here. So just another cool work. A skull that's bleeding and some edginess in the poster on the wall. Just a really good looking composition. And this is an edition of 20. Let's just see what it sold for on primary. Only 15.
00:42:14.484 - 00:42:36.024, Speaker A: Pretty reasonable. And this sold out within three minutes. I'm surprised you had three minutes to buy this. And so again, that went for 15 x 20. So a cool 300 tezos for in like four minutes for Ezra Eslin. Gotta love that continuing floaty stenarum, who we haven't looked at for a while. Just released a new work.
00:42:36.024 - 00:43:02.908, Speaker A: I believe this is on super rare. A new illustration. Again, kind of surreal, kind of with a bit of a hat tip to what feels like more eastern sort of. I don't want to say iconography, but structures, at least in some of the previous works. So this is for seven ETH, and this is on foundation. Not super rare, it's on foundation so interesting work. Even the colors, though, still feel, from my perspective, kind of eastern.
00:43:02.908 - 00:43:23.038, Speaker A: Even the illustrative style kind of reminds me of those kind of Buddha Krishna type illustrations. More illustration. Another one from Flora Marquez. I never want to stop learning. So a new piece march 16 here, playing with the new march colors. Interesting. Four arms and four legs.
00:43:23.038 - 00:43:38.834, Speaker A: So again, mysterious here. Ko bought it for 17 tezos. Very cool. And here we have some music. This is exmortal. All the stars belong to you. And so adding music to the glitch here, let's see if we can get.
00:43:38.834 - 00:44:02.252, Speaker A: So, pretty cool. Five tezos edition of 15. And we have another one. Let me just turn this mic here. And we have another one also. So xmortal has been putting out a lot of work here. And it seems to be going pretty quickly here.
00:44:02.252 - 00:44:37.124, Speaker A: Like, listed at 16, at 442 and gone less than an hour later, within 40 minutes. Sold out at five tezos each times 15. I mean, that's 75 tezos, maybe $100. Okay, signal surfing. So there continues to be a great market for, basically, video glitch work here and does a beautiful job of it. This was really interesting, these works by Francoise Gamma, kind of almost reminiscent of Heidi Roquette's glitch rom work here. And this is called error walk.
00:44:37.124 - 00:45:05.606, Speaker A: Send two. I wonder if it's a little slower than it should be here because of my computer. Anyways, it looks cool. And you see doing the traditional person walking and experimenting with that. But here you see almost what looks like glitch ROM type samples on top. You see, like, I mean, that looks like total glitch RoM type. So anyways, here is the work, false gaMma's work.
00:45:05.606 - 00:45:32.036, Speaker A: And you see, again, the walking person. This was a fantastic one. So there's also this one here, Arawak zero one. This one's a little faster. And again, you see the same kind of what I call samples. So just kind of interesting how Francois's gamma can keep tackling this with different variations on it and keeping making it new and interesting and evolving. I'd actually argue, as we saw with Lorna Mills, to open it.
00:45:32.036 - 00:45:57.204, Speaker A: As we rush through the end here, a door, a new one by byte by bit is a new banner mania work. And we haven't seen byte by bit for a while. So I thought, oh, let's see what they. What byte by bit is working on. So again, another work with Bannermania, one of one for 15 tezos, and House of the model with a cool track in a cool image. Let's see if we can get this working. There we go.
00:45:57.204 - 00:46:16.324, Speaker A: So back to the party. Cool. Techno 99. So for a Tezos edition of 10,000 too many sold. Only nine sold. So pretty cool. The energy.
00:46:16.324 - 00:46:35.234, Speaker A: I'm at a cool party. It is very loud. It is a little overwhelming, to be honest. Sure sounds like conversations you'd have at a too loud party where you can barely talk to each other. House of the model and burka Bayram with interesting series that flooded my notifications here. The Birk AI image generator. Turkish coffee.
00:46:35.234 - 00:46:54.968, Speaker A: I'm pretty sure burka is out of turkey. And so anyways, so that is pretty cool. And another one, sad soul. Almost looks like the Pac man ghost. And so a whole bunch of these came out and. Yeah, from Istanbul again, has been on tezos for a long time. Has, I think, a ton of collectors.
00:46:54.968 - 00:47:13.260, Speaker A: And anyway, here are a bunch of. One of ones and they're starting to move here. A lot of them are starting to move. There's still a few you can get for 15 tezos. There's a great one, outer space. So anyways, a whole bunch of these came out from Birka Bayram. And finally, Jan Lucas Migone with a new one.
00:47:13.260 - 00:47:38.944, Speaker A: And of course the person, the artist that does the skeletons. And I thought this was a beautiful color. Like the coloring was excellent on this. And just kind of beautiful. You see almost like VR glasses on these guys with angel wings and lasers coming out of the VR glasses. So just kind of interesting variations. Again playing kind of like Francois gamma playing variations on a very kind of narrow subject.
00:47:38.944 - 00:48:02.952, Speaker A: And buy now for twelve edition of 30. And that is on secondary. Some back into AI lay with a really cool work. I'm tempted to think this is Del e that makes these gorgeous textures here. This is a very interesting work, isn't it? I wasn't quite sure what to make of it. Little cakes, tea party, cool table. So kind of interesting.
00:48:02.952 - 00:48:17.308, Speaker A: Painterly. Again, direction here. So I just thought this was really attractive. So nice work from Ilay. Edition of 15. Looks like it's sold out or just transferred to the gang here and did any. And there was an offer on it.
00:48:17.308 - 00:48:37.384, Speaker A: Yeah. So this is just a transfer and another work and a dart. Look at what she put out. And these are, I believe are raw AI. So which I think is super interesting. So these brush marks. I love this idea of AI generated brush marks because I think that's what we're seeing here.
00:48:37.384 - 00:49:04.026, Speaker A: And again, the portrait in the middle here, kind of grounding the whole composition with a subject. And then you get this great. You know what you'd never do, like, again. Where I come from, I think, oh, this is so sampleable. You know, if you just have this stuff and then you just sample through the layers, and then you're putting that into your own composition. But, I mean, this is beautiful. And the colors are beautiful that Anna Dart is doing.
00:49:04.026 - 00:49:18.538, Speaker A: So just cool work here and just. Yeah, all of it. No sun, no name. Number ten available for seven. Edition of 15. There are seven left, so get that one while you can. And strange thing, GM family.
00:49:18.538 - 00:50:23.248, Speaker A: I decided to challenge myself to create 17 fashion pieces within 24 hours using mid journey. V five focus was mainly on the photography side and carbon footprint, as opposed to concepts being the focal point. The reel with 17 pieces is now up on Instagram, so I will show that. So playing with photography, which, you know, mid journey seems. V five seems to be particularly good at, you're seeing the distortions start to get ironed out, aren't you? So it's getting interesting here because, again, if you're working, hiring models, I mean, that business seems to be in the process of being disrupted, because I go, am I going to hire a model for however much a model costs per day? Or am I just going to get someone that knows how to use AI to put together some work for us? So all interesting. No lights needed, no photographer needed, right? I'm sure you recognize who this is. Some really cool physical work from die with the most likes.
00:50:23.248 - 00:50:45.580, Speaker A: You know, working across mediums here. Super cool. Very nice. I'd just like to say very nice painterliness, you know, I think die with the most likes. I'm not sure how long he's been painting, but I really like. You can tell he's painting a lot, though, now. And almost, like we were saying with van Gogh, when you just do it a lot, you're gonna make progress.
00:50:45.580 - 00:51:08.024, Speaker A: And I think that's what we're seeing here. So really cool work. Precious moments, I assume is the title, and it even comes with a poem. This is on expanded art, currently resting in the skin tagged underbelly of Berlin. Okay, so maybe this is an older work, and expanded art is here in Berlin in. I actually tried to find it once, and I couldn't find it. It was, like, right in front of my nose, but I couldn't find it.
00:51:08.024 - 00:51:26.674, Speaker A: Let's just see if we can load this up. Yeah. So there you go. So. And I believe expanded art is affiliated with Koenig Gallery, which is a very prominent contemporary art gallery, actually, globally, particularly in Germany. So die with the most likes is doing well. Okay.
00:51:26.674 - 00:51:55.390, Speaker A: Doing very well. So showing with expanded art. So that sounds great. Threesomes with a really cool piece of trading cards. You know who this reminded me of, and I'll show you in a second, was Jasper John's numbers series. I have to say I love, and again, die with the most likes works physically, and then takes pictures, as far as I understand, of the works, or maybe scans them, whatever he does. But I love the painterly quality of all these.
00:51:55.390 - 00:52:26.202, Speaker A: Like they're very nicely painted and I love how they're not completely filled in. It's just really interesting and beautiful. This came out a couple of days ago and yeah, I don't even know how you would get one. And you almost see that nine trading cards sleeve sort of page. And this is what it reminds me of. It's kind of like this Jasper John's number series almost put right on top of the trading cards here, but slightly different. But you see what I'm saying? And this is a very famous series.
00:52:26.202 - 00:52:45.970, Speaker A: And. Yeah, like, as you see here, he did different variations on a very simple theme here. You put every number on top of each other, right. And here's just numbers all across, right. Painted in different ways here. They're all on top of each other. So again, just exploring a very narrow theme here.
00:52:45.970 - 00:53:10.934, Speaker A: And then doing it in different ways here. I'm going to do numbers all across again. It's like Francois Gamma, just really narrowly targeting a certain subject, which is super cool. This was another interesting work. I kind of found it with those earlier kind of zany works that I was discussing, shady lady GM with another new piece. And here. So this is physical work and we actually see the process, which is always fun.
00:53:10.934 - 00:53:32.964, Speaker A: And so here it is. And you see all the work that's gone in. And there's even a video at the end, the finishing touches. It looks like these Posca markers are really good. I made the mistake of buying a bunch of Molotov markers and I don't like them as much as the Posca. Posca seems to bleed a little bit better. So anyways, shady lady seems to like Posca too.
00:53:32.964 - 00:53:57.150, Speaker A: And just a final one from Paula, from Ollie Izikowski, also known as Paulo Muloki. And another physical work. Art is just that, a journey through the process. Indeed, Ollie, indeed. So just another really interesting work. Seems like it's using different mediums, colored pencils, marker maybe, and some paint perhaps. And that is your show, everyone.
00:53:57.150 - 00:54:00.974, Speaker A: Have a great weekend. I hope you enjoyed it. Until next time, take care.
