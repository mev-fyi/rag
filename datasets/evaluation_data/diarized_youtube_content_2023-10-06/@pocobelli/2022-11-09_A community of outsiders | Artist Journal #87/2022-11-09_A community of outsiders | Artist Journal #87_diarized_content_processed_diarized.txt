00:00:03.600 - 00:00:40.024, Speaker A: Are you feeling a little confused? Artist journal, November 9, 2022 in Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pokebelly, and I welcome you back in a huge mega shoutout. This is a show of surprises here today, guys. A show of surprises. And a mega huge shout out to Xander Price. Thank you for this wonderful portrait. What a surprise it was for me.
00:00:40.024 - 00:01:12.484, Speaker A: I was working like crazy yesterday. I think I put in a 14 hours day yesterday just getting everything done that I need to get done. And I turned on Twitter after being off of it for a couple of hours. And much to my surprise, I saw myself. So a wonderful, wonderful surprise. And I gotta say, it's, as I put in the comment in a couple of comments, very humbling. I mean, I started this show, you know, not really expecting anything, to be honest.
00:01:12.484 - 00:01:47.724, Speaker A: And oftentimes that's the best way to start things, even a work of art, not trying to make a masterpiece, but just starting and seeing what happens. And sometimes your best work comes out. And this whole show, I really expected very little. I just thought, okay, I'm just gonna put my thought, put a record out there for. And at the end of the day, I did think, you know, if I do this for like, 200 days, it's gonna probably go somewhere and it'll probably help me. But I am, you know, I guess I. I don't want to say I'm shocked, but I am.
00:01:47.724 - 00:02:11.074, Speaker A: I'm totally shocked and surprised at how this community has really just kind of embraced this program. So thank you to everybody, and thank you to Xander Price. I mean, there's a lot going on in this work, isn't there? Like, first, like. So we have our host over here in. At first, I wasn't sure is like, this is not a mirror. This is a portrait. Right.
00:02:11.074 - 00:02:38.144, Speaker A: And a very nice portrait someone pointed out. I mean, it looks exactly like me, I think, you know, like, it looks like it totally captures me. My sort of strange, you know, flexed out facial muscles. Right. I mean, sometimes I always look at these YouTube thumbnails and I'm sort of like, I guess that's me. You know, you just go with it. And I think Xander has captured me quite well, even down to the color of the eyes.
00:02:38.144 - 00:02:52.160, Speaker A: But anyway, I don't want to focus too much on me. But again, it's a. Imagine that happening to you on Twitter. I'm sure it's happened to some of you. It's. Yeah, what a day yesterday. And there are more surprises in store coming up.
00:02:52.160 - 00:03:24.484, Speaker A: Continuing on just with the piece, though, was Xander's very complex piece here, a narrative painting. And we have Bob Ross painting a tezos, a black flag, almost like a pirate flag, which I think we all identify with. This show is a bit of a pirate ship of sorts, isn't it? And on a laptop. So maybe studying painting with tezos as his kind of goal of sorts. A rose. So a lot of symbolism here. A vase, a Coca Cola and a corona beer.
00:03:24.484 - 00:03:45.832, Speaker A: And so this is probably just his workspace in my room. This is called. And this is interesting as well. We have the banana, the famous banana. I can't remember the very famous prankster artist, as we all know from art Basel Miami last year. The banana tape to the wall. So a little bit of a.
00:03:45.832 - 00:04:09.088, Speaker A: Maybe a reference to pranksterism of sorts. And here it looks like a skateboard with America. Illegal business drolls. So very interesting. And a stussy. There's always so much detail in Xander Price's work. And a stussy shirt, but it looks, like altered with a rat or a rabbit of sorts.
00:04:09.088 - 00:04:26.106, Speaker A: And of course, the alter ego Xander Price himself. So again, huge shout out to Xander Price. Thank you for that. Yeah, I mean, my girlfriend loved it, too. Yeah. And the hair and everything. So, anyways, I could go on and on.
00:04:26.106 - 00:04:49.474, Speaker A: For those that might not be familiar with Xander's work. I was first introduced over here with this awesome Mark Zuckerberg painting on duty. I still want to pick that up. 40 tezos, though, on. I mean, tezos is getting very cheap right now. And isn't it great? Like, as the crypto markets crash. Yeah, it affects us.
00:04:49.474 - 00:05:15.266, Speaker A: You know, we transact in crypto, but we're still having fun over here, aren't we? You know, I was just thinking, like, things are crashing and we're having a ton of fun. The party continues. So, anyways, here is Xander's work for those that are not familiar. And, of course, yes, this was. Yeah. How I got introduced to his work. There's a gallerist I work with, Steven in Minnesota.
00:05:15.266 - 00:05:36.280, Speaker A: My one gallery that I work with, and he saw this was the first episode he saw was where this painting was shown. He's like, that is an amazing painting. So, yeah. So, Xander. Yeah, get out there, because there are gallerists who think your work is phenomenal. So isn't that exciting? Another surprise. Look at this.
00:05:36.280 - 00:05:52.254, Speaker A: So yesterday was a surprise. Then I wake up. Haiti is wishing my mom happy birthday. So happy birthday, mom via Haiti. I thought, oh, that's nice. And then I go to my object and look at this. Look at this.
00:05:52.254 - 00:06:27.520, Speaker A: I was shocked. Again and surprised by this wonderful community here. We have something very special going on here. You know, it's almost. I feel like it's a community of outsiders have found each other via the Internet, and it's a wonderful thing. So, artist journal, you know, super cool hype the art, which is the name of the piece, a Haiti Rockette, one of one glitch rom work. Hype the art via Haiti Rockette, Haiti.
00:06:27.520 - 00:06:46.040, Speaker A: Again, speech. I was rendered speechless yesterday. As I said, a rare occurrence. And this morning as well. Super cool pokebelly artist journal. So, anyways, guys, guys, guys, this is awesome. This is why it doesn't get any better than this.
00:06:46.040 - 00:07:04.442, Speaker A: I've never seen an art scene like this. Thrilled to the bone. Okay. And Roerich is also wanted to wish mom a happy birthday. A little late, but better late than never. And so shout out to mom from Haiti and Roerich. So the fun continues over here.
00:07:04.442 - 00:07:30.924, Speaker A: And a quick shout out. I sold a bunch of these eight bit nature series to Ilay, so just a quick shout out to her and also to Lewis Baker island, who actually has a comment here as well. So thank you, guys, for the sales. So, I mean, bear market. Crypto crash. What bear market? We're having a ton of fun here. So, continuing on, a couple of comments that I want to highlight.
00:07:30.924 - 00:07:50.058, Speaker A: We were talking about the music playlists in the acid house. Aksine can wait, but wants the acid stuff. Maybe not doing the show weekends, but adding tunes to a playlist. As I said, a very fun idea. I love this idea. It's. Yes, yes, maybe.
00:07:50.058 - 00:08:21.470, Speaker A: I'm not sure about this weekend, but you know what it's gonna take. I was thinking to myself, I just gotta buy a bottle of wine and kind of have a couple of drinks on my own. And before you know it, Spotify come resurrects. And before you know it, you guys are gonna have. I'll be drinking and tweeting again and saying stupid things. So anyway, that is, you know, I'll go buy a bottle of wine and for axine, and then we'll delve into the Spotify. I love this idea, and I think we're going to do it.
00:08:21.470 - 00:08:46.720, Speaker A: I'm going to make a playlist. And why not? All we need is it takes only two people to make a party, oxine. And everybody else is invited. Also, Baker Island, Luis Lantigua. So we were talking about cross chain diversification yesterday. So let's get into it here. I agree with you that ecosystem diversification for artists is important in my crypto journey.
00:08:46.720 - 00:09:16.600, Speaker A: As a proud baker for Tezos. I have become a Tezos maximalist. And I would love to persuade you a bit about decentralization. I'm kind of sold on it already to a certain degree. But I take your point. If I'm saying, hey, let's go hang out on Solana, I mean, it's a massive debate because some people, as we're seeing, Cherniak, I think Daniel Cherniak, he was saying how Tezos was overly, you know, centralized. So it's kind of a huge debate.
00:09:16.600 - 00:09:51.104, Speaker A: What makes decentralization. Obviously it's the ideal, right? Because just not relying on any, on anybody, excuse me, for anything, right. It's all decentralized. That is the ideal continuing on, technically speaking. And if you think in terms of network security, decentralization is huge to protect your creations and investment, we can make the same argument. And I agree with you. You know who I'm excited about, and I mentioned this about 20 episodes ago, I have some locked up dot, but Polkadot.
00:09:51.104 - 00:10:32.510, Speaker A: And that's something that's completely not on the NFT radar. But I don't know if you saw a little that crypto news that came out that the SEC, as far as I understand it, sounds too good to be true, but I think it is because they tagged the SEC and said Polkadot. And the web3 foundation, which is Polkadot as far as I understand, has been working with it, working with the SEC, the regulators in the United States, and they are now a software, they are not a security. So I highlighted Polkadot about 20 episodes ago, and I do own a small amount of Polkadot. I want to buy more. And again, not financial advice. Crashing hallelujah.
00:10:32.510 - 00:11:18.218, Speaker A: Because to me, the biggest threat if I'm ethereum, I'm, my biggest concern is Polkadot. My biggest concern out of all of these, for all of these chains, it would be Polkadot. And you know why? As I mentioned in an earlier episode, as far as I understand, I heard Gavin, the main guy who used, who programmed Ethereum, put the language together. The Polkadot can be felis, like the chains that Polkadot puts together. Those I think in theory can be felis. And if you have a felis, I saw him in an interview at the end and as he said, that alone will trump everything. And I totally agree with him.
00:11:18.218 - 00:12:12.138, Speaker A: And so the dark horse of all these, you know, different chains I have my eye on, actually dot, which I don't think anybody in the NFT space is looking at right now, but they have security and decentralization to the core as far as I understand, you probably are a bigger expert than me on these things. So continuing on, and this was a really good point. Also, as important as security is living in an open source environment, think of how hen was able to preserve itself literally overnight. And that's an excellent point. We have been so indoctrinated in centralization in our life and so used to folks preserving the source that we have forgotten to democratize economic systems. Also, artists may not know that there are bridges being built across the entire crypto that will allow folks to move back and forth across chains. Hello.
00:12:12.138 - 00:12:26.588, Speaker A: Polkadot. Also, what's the other one? Not atmos, but there's another one that's cosmos. Cosmos. I'm sort of. I have a feeling. Yeah. Anyway, let's not get into that.
00:12:26.588 - 00:12:45.024, Speaker A: I'm kind of more of a dot guy than cosmos, but I don't know enough about it either. Not meaning to be preachy, just passion for Tezos and what Tezos means to the world. So excellent, and thank you for the nice comments here. Greetings from Seattle. Well, greetings back. I love Seattle. I've been there a couple of times.
00:12:45.024 - 00:13:19.814, Speaker A: I have some friends over there, some very close friends. So, yeah. So, anyways, the debate continues. And I hear you like, and I listen, I think it's. Is it Kevin who's the founder of Tezos, or kind of like the guy in charge of it? I don't know who the founders are, but all to say, I love Tezos. But, yeah, as I like, you know, in a sense, it hasn't really changed my mind on anything here. I think we do need to just diversify among chains.
00:13:19.814 - 00:14:10.290, Speaker A: And again, the archivists, as long as they can load up Solana, I'm not too concerned, as long as I'm not exclusively on a centralized chain. You know what I mean? And sometimes different chains are excuses to make different series, because I might think in my head, what kind of series would work well on Solana. And it's a fun way of working, of actually trying to make a series for a certain chain. My pixel art sketchbook is actually a series that's kind of designed for tasos, and I like it that way. And then it gives me a challenge, and it's like, okay, what kind of work might fit that chain? Anyways, continuing on, I want to speed through this. Just a quick shout out to Dana Ulama, whose name I am pronouncing right, pokebelly talks about my work. Thank you very much.
00:14:10.290 - 00:14:30.138, Speaker A: And he pronounced my last name correctly. And so, my pleasure, Dana. And great to hear from you. I'm a huge fan. A recent discovery via limbo. And here's a very cool GM from Dana Ulama that she released yesterday. So, yeah, just a really interesting artist.
00:14:30.138 - 00:14:53.864, Speaker A: And we looked at her work from a year ago. When you look at the evolution that's occurred here again, just like ratcloak, like, where's us gonna be in a year? I don't know, but it's pretty exciting. KHC Kurt hussle collective spotted in Prague, Czech Republic. I was just in Prague. I had nothing to do with this, as you'll see. I had something to do with another one, which I will bring up. But look at this.
00:14:53.864 - 00:15:24.736, Speaker A: And I have a friend I sent my YouTube video to channel to, and she was, like, in Saskatoon. And she was like, who's Kurt Hussle collective? Those guys are awesome. And so there they are in Prague. So anyway, that looks exactly like where I just was. Prague. That looks like a typical Prague street right now. This I did have something to do with Kurt Hussle collective spot in Brooklyn.
00:15:24.736 - 00:15:58.248, Speaker A: Now, I was kind of low key about this. Like, I didn't really tell anybody. I didn't tell Kurt Hussle. There's a Haiti work on there, and there's, like, a couple others who will look at here, because a friend of mine who's a curator, Leo Kwelb's collection, they put on a show called Lightyear that's monthly on the Manhattan Bridge here. That's what this is. And he was just asking if I knew any NFT artists. So I sent a few links, and then they got put up pretty quickly, and I should have reached out to the artist because I think it's just good form to.
00:15:58.248 - 00:16:13.426, Speaker A: And I think you should ask for permission. Right? And so anyways, it happened very quickly. And so I was just like, okay, whatever. Let's just be low key about this. And who's going to notice? Well, they noticed. So anyways. And people seem happy about it.
00:16:13.426 - 00:16:33.556, Speaker A: I mean, I should have put my own work up there as well. I literally forgot. So here are some of the artists. It should say Kurt Hussle collective, not Jnk here. Again, it was very kind of no money changed hands. It was just like a curator. Hey, do you have anything? I do this monthly thing, and I sent over some links, and before you know it, they are up.
00:16:33.556 - 00:16:55.716, Speaker A: So, anyways, pretty awesome. I should have sent links of my own work that my space work, Space Odyssey work would probably go really nice on that bridge. So, anyways, maybe. Yeah, so you can ultra shorts and nfts and. Yeah, you can just get a sense. So projectors again. Yeah, so anyway, there it is.
00:16:55.716 - 00:17:22.034, Speaker A: Can we see the Haiti work here? There's the spagels maskinen and so anyways, there's the Haiti work. Yeah, so anyways, if anybody has any issues, just drop me a line or anything. But I think, you know, it's kind of fun. So all good, hopefully. All good. It seems like it's all good. I messaged Kurt Hussle and all good pupil, la delay.
00:17:22.034 - 00:17:40.914, Speaker A: Tada. Which I'm probably not pronouncing right. Santiago? Just kind of highlight this psychedelic digital art show. I think that was show, not salon show. So anyways, just a head up. Heads up here on the spanish front. I think that's Spanish.
00:17:40.914 - 00:18:22.990, Speaker A: So continuing on. Sorry, guys, I'm. Another thing I want to do is shorten these programs, and I'm not doing a very good job of that right now. Vertical crypto art in London. So I thought just in terms of displays, I thought this was kind of interesting just to contrast because it's just one of the many things we discuss here is how digital art is displayed. And so it does look a lot better if you're going to go with the tv screen or the digital frame, that does look a lot better than, I guess, what we saw in NFT London. So, I mean, it's still very tricky.
00:18:22.990 - 00:19:11.890, Speaker A: I mean, maybe what we're not seeing here sometimes is how this art gets cropped, right? And because I've had work on tvs, and usually the first thing they ask you is, do you want it to be cropped or not to fit the, you know, 16 by nine ratio. So vertical crypto art put on what looks like a pretty big show. They also have a space in Berlin here, which I walk by every so often, if I walk to the gym. And so, continuing on, Roon Toon and Joe Rogan's dad collaborated. So that's a lot of fun. I don't know if I've ever seen Roon Toon put out a new work since I started following him a few weeks ago on object. So family business and two well known players now on the Tezos scene, of course, Joe Rogan's dad here, two cousins take care of business from a secured location.
00:19:11.890 - 00:19:38.592, Speaker A: I assume. This is Runetune digital animation, created using a combination of Photoshop and AI tools. Ori for $38.80 is what you gotta pay for this. I think it sold out very quickly, minted, listed at 414 Berlin time, and basically sold out within less than 2 hours. So congratulations to Runetune and Joe Rogan's dad. Very cool.
00:19:38.592 - 00:19:54.848, Speaker A: And so there was some AI, so they collaborated and I guess they're cousins. So all in the family there some bullet magazines and a grenade. Okay. Okay. Before the sensors walk in on me here. Okay. So continuing on.
00:19:54.848 - 00:20:07.004, Speaker A: Look at this. I thought this was really cool. So I haven't heard from typed art for a while. I made a few pieces. I have ideas for other works I want to make on there. I made some of those tb three hundred three s and the nine hundred nine s. Speaking of acid house.
00:20:07.004 - 00:20:27.024, Speaker A: So pale blue pixel made a new and I thought this was a really nice work. It was fun to make this space invaders ASCII in typed art, although it only works for the desktop version. Luckily we are on desktop, so here it is. Let's see if this works. Zooming in. Yeah. So a really, really nice work.
00:20:27.024 - 00:20:46.820, Speaker A: Addition of 41 tazos. So I picked one up. I mean, Tezos is like at a dollar ten right now, so it's very cheap to buy art right now. If you ever want to be an art collector, like now is your chance. If you're just starting out, you're not going to get much better deals. This is, you know, $2.40. Okay.
00:20:46.820 - 00:21:07.950, Speaker A: This another. So another ASCII work. Of course, this is by Dan Control, who is experimenting. And what is the name of this? Yu Gi. Oh, the back of the cards. So I guess this is some kind of card game that I am not aware of. And so anyways, I'm very interested to just keep watching how Dan experiments with ASCII.
00:21:07.950 - 00:21:33.492, Speaker A: Look at this. Kristin Rus, who we know from several of his abstract works, which are highly collected on tazos. A new direction with my weaving. Excited about this new series. So this is a whole other way of rendering art, particularly pixelated art. Art is tapestry, and there is a great tradition of tapestry. So.
00:21:33.492 - 00:21:54.344, Speaker A: And I think they can do. And I feel free to send me a name again. If you post links in the YouTube comments, I think they. I can't see them. They just kind of get disappeared. You can tell there's a comment, but they get disappeared. But if you know the name of a weaver that does digital art or that can do that sort of thing, I've looked a few times, I know it exists.
00:21:54.344 - 00:22:25.358, Speaker A: But another heads up, say like popple, again, think of weaving. And again, if you're like an artist and you have tapestries, you have screen prints, and you're doing nfts, it's just good for business. And it's a lot of fun. And it just like my friend was saying, you should make a sculpture from that show way back when, just to make it look like you have more depth. That's what you need, is basically what he's saying. It's like pr advice, public relations advice. You should make a sculpture.
00:22:25.358 - 00:22:37.446, Speaker A: Which I thought was great advice. I haven't followed up on it yet. I'll just add it to my list of things to do here. But what was his name? It's not Paul. That's what I thought it was last time. It's another. It's not Dan.
00:22:37.446 - 00:23:15.734, Speaker A: Anyway, here is another work. Let's see if we can get the audio going. Here we go. So, three minutes and 32 seconds. We are not going to play the whole thing, but look at what this is combining. We have pixel art, which is like, basically, we have a single, and it's a side a and side b, and we have the combination here of visual art, and we have two tracks. So it's like a single pixel art, animation and music by p one.
00:23:15.734 - 00:23:40.772, Speaker A: So just a. Very interesting. Again, we're seeing this more and more, this combination. It's like, again, the rebirth of the single. This combination of music and visual art as an NFT. And now the visual art is moving, and it's almost unlike pixel art. Like a lot of worlds are colliding here.
00:23:40.772 - 00:23:54.496, Speaker A: And so, definitely worth our attention here. Is this for sale yet? Edition's a 20. Minted. So not yet. So you can still get that. That's pixel scrapbook by p one. Very, very cool.
00:23:54.496 - 00:24:19.354, Speaker A: A couple of color studies from Michael Macasso. Get well soon. My body is scattered in the valley. My soul remains on the summit. And I thought this was interesting, too. Just the vaporwave colors, that kind of. We keep seeing these colors, Dan, dana, ulal, uval, or I hope I don't have her name in front of me, whose name I was pronouncing correctly.
00:24:19.354 - 00:24:31.374, Speaker A: She uses these colors. I've used them. I keep saying that. I'll show you guys one day. They're great colors together, and we see them. They're kind of classic vaporwave colors. Some more experiments.
00:24:31.374 - 00:24:48.964, Speaker A: And this is kind of interesting. Lunch break studies. It's very hard not to make a cliche out of the color red. I've never thought about that. Interesting idea. The temptation on using it as a trendy gimmick rather than a foundation is immense. That's how powerful red color is.
00:24:48.964 - 00:25:09.174, Speaker A: So interesting. So a couple of landscapes here, pixelated and going well with empty mountains by Ed Morolla. Another one of one. So I thought these works kind of paired up nicely. Again, you could show them in the same room. A one of one for only 20 tezos, which these days is practically $20. A little more than $20.
00:25:09.174 - 00:25:31.134, Speaker A: Another work. Byte by bit. Playing with the. With vintage software help. So pretty cool. Is this for sale? Buy for 15. One of one.
00:25:31.134 - 00:26:11.764, Speaker A: So all very reasonably priced these days, isn't it? So very cool. Animation made by 1988 Fantavision sound on. So I think sound might be new for byte by bit. This was also sent to me, I assume because I own other work by Elie Lo. Let's just maximize this. So trash, right? Trash artist. Probably my favorite trash artist actually.
00:26:11.764 - 00:26:32.054, Speaker A: Like. Yeah, like it's very rock and roll. Again. You feel like you're. Or even like Bergain. You feel like you're at a massive nightclub in Berlin is kind of the vibe that Elie Lowe gives. So I believe this was sent out to previous holders is how that one worked.
00:26:32.054 - 00:26:48.638, Speaker A: So very cool. Trash bag. Trash berth number 22. And look at this work by Uksin. Not minted, as far as I know. I went to his foundation and his object to see. So playing with the crash, right, the big crypto crash.
00:26:48.638 - 00:27:23.280, Speaker A: And there's the metamask, you know, fox that we see up there. And I thought just a really, really cool work. And you see the market's going down here and the fox is looking down. Just another very well thought out work by Oxine Murlakos, who I feel has been gone for a while. I think he went to bitcoin world or the rare pepe world for a while. He has a work as part of the Drankdao series. And look at this edition of 52 purple drinks Morlacos.
00:27:23.280 - 00:27:51.364, Speaker A: So just another awesome Morlaco's work doing the skeletor, which we remember from he man back in my youth. Yeah, I'm old enough where I remember he man. I think I had an action figure. So just a super duper cool work by Morlakos. Loved the color and just done in his trademark style. So very cool. And of course the ladders in the clouds are just pure morlacos.
00:27:51.364 - 00:28:20.614, Speaker A: Working conditions from home. This is by Turkarak. And I just thought again, you could argue a art of the present. Not my present, I think, but kind of like I like the edge of Turkorak. I think Turkarak has a real edge, which is why I keep coming back to it. Just kind of interesting working conditions from home. Buy for five tazos continuing on, an interesting work in progress from Minta.
00:28:20.614 - 00:28:44.720, Speaker A: So I guess she's getting some negative comments. Inspired in comments I've received recently. What else can I do but make art out of them? Stop Minta art. We want gangster art. No more concept. So I guess people are criticizing. Yeah, that comes with the territory, you know, again, as I said in a previous episode, like, 98% of being an artist is rejection.
00:28:44.720 - 00:29:04.532, Speaker A: That's why it's so beautiful, really, what's happening here with this community and just doing little gestures. Not so little gestures like we saw from Xander in Haiti. I mean, really. So, yeah. So anyway, she's minting tomorrow. I'm tempted to just buy in and. Yeah, it's a beautiful work, too.
00:29:04.532 - 00:29:43.340, Speaker A: Nice. Like, it's tempting to leave it unfinished, isn't it? This nice, non finito. Let's see what she does. And another nice oil painting from Trez, a rodanx who finds his way on the show. Again, portrait of Gary Bussy. And I just think a delightful oil painting, isn't it just a very nice oil painting. I mean, you know what another way of doing this would be, which would be really weird, but you could print this out on a canvas, and then you put, like, maybe a layer, traditional oil painting, you'd put like a brown or a sepia or even like an orange underneath.
00:29:43.340 - 00:30:20.346, Speaker A: You see that sometimes in my pixel art sketchbook or nostalgia studies, I'll put an orange, like a brown orange background. That's kind of a classic. Or like a umber or, you know, a burnt umber in oil painting speak, that's kind of a classic kind of oil painting. How you start building oil painting from the foundation, you'll put a layer of sepia of some kind. And it would be tempting with this guy. As you print it on a canvas, put a layer of sepia so you can still see through it, and then maybe you have a reference, and then you just kind of remake this as an actual oil painting because it's actually quite beautiful. But maybe you don't need to.
00:30:20.346 - 00:30:46.550, Speaker A: Maybe you don't need to do that at all. Anyways, is this for sale at auction? For 15. So, yeah, there is a bid from maestro museum. Again, like, beautiful work, you know, so nice experimentation there we see the finished version of Turamza's work. Let me just look at Turamza. More music and. Oops.
00:30:46.550 - 00:31:28.784, Speaker A: More music and fun. So it's kind of magical, isn't it? You know, on a quieter day, we could have opened the show with that guy. Like, just very interesting, magical delightful work. Kind of captures the spirit, doesn't it, of tezos in a lot of ways, this journey into our imagination that we seem to be taking on a daily basis here. The Tezos life, as people call it, continuing on. So Santiago is going cross chain. Happy to present you all my form function, Genesis.
00:31:28.784 - 00:31:51.766, Speaker A: So got onto form function, which from my understanding, is like the main one of one platform on Solana, basically the super rare, we might say, of Solana. So congratulations to San Diego for getting on there. And three sol reserve, which is also going down quickly. So only $60. I think it's probably even less now. I hope I did the settings right. If not, please help me understand.
00:31:51.766 - 00:32:24.660, Speaker A: Okay, so anyways, just a really cool abstract work, as per usual from Santiago. And interestingly, we always like to look at the process here and how people are working. So this is fascinating. This is the brush, which I've done 130% of my digital work on. And so this looks like a Photoshop screen capture here. So if you're really curious about Santiago's settings, you can look here. It's really cool when people make their own brushes, isn't it? So props to you.
00:32:24.660 - 00:32:53.688, Speaker A: Santiago Tuks, who we were looking at, who has all sorts of interesting abstract work, has a one of one that was released, which is semi abstract but almost half representational. Is there AI in this? Yes, there is. Yeah. So AI assisted with mid journey and slight post production in Photoshop. And we have some news on mid journey, which we're going to get to here, which is very interesting. So anyways, very interesting. One of one, buy for 150.
00:32:53.688 - 00:33:22.530, Speaker A: Has anybody bid? Oh, no, it's just a straight up list price and buy for five. Hacking student. Another AI assisted work using mid journey and Photoshop, also by Tuks. So just kind of a cool work. You can tell it's AI by kind of the curvature here and just the shapes, just those kind of AI distortions, as I like to call them. So buy for five. And a few have sold.
00:33:22.530 - 00:33:43.842, Speaker A: Dirnadler and Lily illo. Yeah, so we recognize a lot of names here. And remember this work, it sold, I think we were talking about it yesterday. It sold for $2,921.02.22 ETH, the virus of life. So that was quick and that was popular. So just shows how quickly things can happen here.
00:33:43.842 - 00:34:10.220, Speaker A: And a collaboration between Sky Goodman and what I want to call Strano, perhaps Skyno number one perpetual disc. So this looks like, I guess Skye Goodman is well known for these sneaker works that he does. So it looks like impossible sneakers. Remember that. But there's something else I want to show you about this. So Xcollabs is also a creator. Now, again, I'm always a fan.
00:34:10.220 - 00:34:44.068, Speaker A: If you put the artists on top of the gallery, but that's kind of beside the point here. A web3 art gallery with a focus on curation and creation of fine art. Nfts. So my prediction. Or I could just see this happening more and more, these kind of web3 art galleries, because you can do it. When you mint an NFT, you can put someone else. So if you're making deals and maybe a gallery is going to promote you and you're getting something out of it, if you want to collaborate with a gallery, you can do it at least on object.
00:34:44.068 - 00:35:17.690, Speaker A: In tezos, like, it's pretty simple to do, so it shows up in everybody's profile. Everything's cool. So mid journey, my favorite collector, artist unknown collector. With the new mid journey update, it is clear that the evolution of AI will be exponentially fast. And everyone, quote, traditional that doesn't have a unique style will maybe vanish very fast. For me, this just shows that the best and most creative will survive in the future. Get motivated.
00:35:17.690 - 00:35:54.594, Speaker A: I think there's a lot of truth to this, isn't there? Like, in a sense, if you're just painting what he calls traditionally or like everybody has painted in the past, AI will probably replace you. So it's, you know, it's sort of like, find that thing that's unique about yourself and kind of bet on it and, like, kind of bet all on it. Like, kind of go with what maybe you thought was the strangeness of yourself. In a sense. That's kind of what this show is. I always thought, oh, you know, I never did well on Twitter before. I thought people thought I was a little strange, but I was just like, with this show, I was sort of like, screw it, I'm going with me.
00:35:54.594 - 00:36:14.306, Speaker A: And that's basically what unknown collector's saying. And the reason I say that is because I think we should all be doing that. Bet on yourself. As Ballard says, who I love to quote here, pursue your own obsessions. What makes you you, and then double down on it. Yeah. And here we go.
00:36:14.306 - 00:36:45.024, Speaker A: Don't get replaced by a machine. Push yourself and your art to the absolute maximum. This is a tough test for artists, and you need a lot of grit and inspiration to get through. Wish you all the best unknown collector. So on our AI front here, Charles AI, who has been doing spectacularly the last few weeks, crypto markets right now. And I thought this was a nice piece. Again, I'm always into this news art idea and kind of remixing and commenting in real time.
00:36:45.024 - 00:37:08.388, Speaker A: I think that's a way of making art incredibly relevant. So this another kind of example of how that might occur. Looks like Rome burning or some sort of AI Sci-Fi landscape burning. Look at this work by Venta. Buy for ten. Only additions of five, really. I wonder if this is using the new mid journey, because it looks spectacular.
00:37:08.388 - 00:37:31.044, Speaker A: It looks very high resolution. I wonder how big this can print. Do we have. I don't have dimensions here, but wow, that is really seeming to go somewhere, doesn't it? It seems to be developing and evolving and it's really just stunning. So king and fool. Very nice. Right.
00:37:31.044 - 00:38:03.804, Speaker A: So, finally, just a few more works by Danielle King, who we were looking at at earlier episodes. An AI artist who combines artists. And here I thought this was worth our attention. Salvador Dali and mixing with fashion with Yves Saint Laurent. And of course, we see this in strange thing. More, we might say Renaissance paintings combined with fashion. So, anyways, maybe Louis Vietn, maybe in his case, a little more.
00:38:03.804 - 00:38:26.154, Speaker A: So here are just some interesting classic Dali shadows here. Long shadows, psychological shadows. There it is. Mixed with some Yves Saint Laurent via Danielle King. And one more. So there we have it, my friends. Another episode and a big shout out to all of you.
00:38:26.154 - 00:38:54.808, Speaker A: And may you all. Oh, well, lest we forget, Quila Nina has another acrylic work and another physical work, which we also like to celebrate here. Just a wonderful, wonderful artist. I'd love to get one of these originals, acrylic and oil on canvas, 2017 Annabelli. Shout out to Quilanina, who is experimenting with procreate and has actually just released a piece. Anyways, thank you once again, my friends, a big shout out to everyone. May you have a productive day.
00:38:54.808 - 00:38:57.384, Speaker A: And with that, until next time, take care.
