00:00:03.640 - 00:00:19.194, Speaker A: More people are boarding the ship. It's quite a crew we have here, folks. I think I was at 568. I mean, a little thanks to Robnisv. Two there for the extra help last night. I think I got ten new subscribers. So welcome, everybody.
00:00:19.194 - 00:00:43.016, Speaker A: Artist Journal, January 31, 2023. Broadcasting to the world from Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Vocabelli. I welcome you all, old and new to this show. And here we go. So, uxing, making it look easy again. And I think this is a manifold XYZ.
00:00:43.016 - 00:01:13.796, Speaker A: And we have a couple of corrections or clarifications from a couple of artists. And you gotta love it from my perspective, when, you know, great artists like oxine and hasdrubal waffle are chiming in because they saw something on the show. Rob Nasvi. I mean, it's an embarrassment of riches over here. So, anyways, enjoy the good times while they're here. You never know what happens. So, anyways, with that, let's look at oxen.
00:01:13.796 - 00:01:34.254, Speaker A: And oxen. He had a great title on this one. Let's take a quick look. If you are going through hell, keep going. You know, sage advice, by the way. Keep walking, keep walking, keep going if you're going through hell. We've all been through hell, and we all probably will go through hell.
00:01:34.254 - 00:02:04.442, Speaker A: So, sage advice. Actually, ten of ten have been minted, 0.69. So a cool, you know, ten grand, maybe a little more, actually, for uck on this work. And a great work with the, you know, all the trademarks. Like he's got his own, you know, toolbox of iconography. The friar, the skeleton with the, you know, the gift out, you know, flashing. And brilliantly done, by the way.
00:02:04.442 - 00:02:41.232, Speaker A: Like, let me just show you here. And a lot of people who are familiar with oxygen's work are gonna. But you see this over here? It's like these little details, just this kind of digital noise and distortion that he puts in here that really are just the, you know, I want to call it the missing link. You know, that added detail that when you look up close to what uxine's doing, it stands up, and it's wonderful to see. So, anyways, really fun to watch his progress over here. Now, let's see if we can continue here. So, this was pretty hilarious.
00:02:41.232 - 00:03:06.408, Speaker A: Mardo did. Our pirate ship in the sky is now being. We have a visual, as I said, on Twitter. So this is pretty hilarious as we are building it in midair. So here we go. So, anyways, Mardo made it a prompt somehow and made this beautiful work here. Of this pirate ship in the sky, you know, that is wonderful.
00:03:06.408 - 00:03:34.946, Speaker A: So anyways, I don't know if she's gonna mint it, so just hilarious. So continuing on, big announcement, I guess. So tomorrow. I have a really packed schedule here. I actually. Yeah, you won't believe I have to finish this show that I'm actually going to show in Berlin tomorrow. But before that we're going to do a Twitter spaces on the same subject, what are the main genres of digital art? And so let me get out of this mode.
00:03:34.946 - 00:04:33.094, Speaker A: Here we go. We're discussing the main categories of digital art on this week's salon on Twitter spaces. Join rune tune and I and have your say so just as like a primer here. I've been putting this show together for just like, it's very low key, you know, kind of friends and some artist friends sort of thing at the kino, the cinema at the back of Zedbar, this small theater and this cool bar in Mitta. Anyways, these are the categories that I'm working with right now. So just to get you sort of thinking, pixel art, vintage software glitch, media art, which kind of is more or less the GiF category, animated shorts, which is more or less the video category, abstract collage, digital painting, illustration, generative art, and AI. So maybe that's too few.
00:04:33.094 - 00:04:55.934, Speaker A: Maybe that's too many. Maybe that's totally not right according to your thoughts. So here, my friends, is your chance to weigh in. Let me pin this to my profile here. So if you just go to my Twitter profile, you can set a reminder and have your say. I'm sure Runetune's gonna have a lot to say. I've been really ruminating about it as I've been going over and really creating this show.
00:04:55.934 - 00:05:23.702, Speaker A: And I have halfway to go, so let me continue here. So that is happening tomorrow, Wednesday at 09:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, and then at 830, if you're 830 in the evening, Berlin time. So a few hours later, we're going to put a show up in the cinema there at Zbar Kino in Zedbar. And it's just going to loop. I'm going to do introductory remarks at 830, basically talking a little bit about what we just talked about there. A big shout out.
00:05:23.702 - 00:05:38.538, Speaker A: Thank you. We're selling more of these eight bit nature works. Rain went to magician magickian, and this went. And the rainbow went to Lou Greed. And I believe also beach went to Lou Greed. So thanks, guys. That is awesome.
00:05:38.538 - 00:06:10.716, Speaker A: I saw my wallet perk up a little bit this morning. So that was really cool. So back to uxing. So axin left a comment, which is totally awesome. And I was talking about this work yesterday, and I was sort of saying, I think, you know, I was sort of speaking off the cuff and just being like, I think it was like mint in an hour or like going to take the top ten offers in an hour, but always go to oxen's Twitter to get the full details. And I'm not sure if there is an issue with the. Sometimes it's tricky when you're trying to take offers.
00:06:10.716 - 00:06:38.544, Speaker A: I've seen it repeatedly with Louis Osborne and others. So he mentioned oxen, left a quote, a comment, lack of detailed tools. I started to pick random nine, a one top offer above 250. As always, trying things don't go based on what I said. Always go to Aksine's Twitter feed. And it's always great to hear from you. Aksin, who's a long time watcher of the show, and we've been showing his art for a long time.
00:06:38.544 - 00:07:03.572, Speaker A: So it's awesome. Great, dude. And also, one other thing here, this is kind of funny. So remember, Charles AI used meta in his tweet. And just very quick context, Bishop Kanye said you asked if meta is a typo. It's a term from video games when players find the best weapon or strategy to win. It's referred to as the current meta.
00:07:03.572 - 00:07:31.594, Speaker A: For example, the shotgun meta is when shotguns are overpowered and the best weapon to easily win. When this inevitably happens, the game devs will update the shotgun to reduce its damage. So in other words, Charles AI was talking about open editions as the current meta, as far as I understand the use of the term. So that. So that was not a typo. So thank you, Bishop Kanye, for weighing in there, and thank you for all the comments, everyone. Very cool.
00:07:31.594 - 00:08:24.284, Speaker A: And continuing on, just one more comment from a few episodes ago that came in, and I thought this was quite interesting. Joe Chiapetta, as a longtime cartoonist, collector, and crypto artist, I very much appreciate your comparison between the golden age of comics and the NFT space. It is a spot on analysis that sadly, most of the traditional comic market and critics of today have not been taken very seriously yet. It is interesting. Like, I worked in a comic store and was obsessed with comics from about the age of, let's say, twelve to maybe 18. Like totally obsessed. And like, a lot of my collecting sort of chops come from comic collecting and whatever.
00:08:24.284 - 00:09:07.754, Speaker A: And yeah, what I. And having. Being obsessed with that, you go back and you look at the Silver Age comics and the golden age comics, and to Joe's point, you know, it is surprising to see not more comic people kind of get on board the NFT thing because it has all the hallmarks of the classicness of a golden age. Like when you see, as we're going to see here, Robnis v. Two, minting the right click, save as guy and pulling in thousands and thousands of dollars and everybody else, frankly, or Charles, AI, you name it, pulling in all this money. To me, this is not a normal situation. It's easy to take for granted.
00:09:07.754 - 00:09:46.970, Speaker A: But I don't see this as normal. I see this as this has all the hallmarks of, you know, the roaring twenties. It's one of those things like, can you believe it when someone could just mint something and walk away with ten grand the next day? Like, like, this is not normal. Okay? And so anyways, I think this is really great because I'm kind of out on a limb when I'm saying this is like the golden age of comics. I mean, I'm not saying that because I heard that somewhere else. So for me, it's kind of reaffirming or confirming to somewhat there's someone else who agrees. It's very interesting to hear that from Joe Chiapetta.
00:09:46.970 - 00:10:12.974, Speaker A: So thanks for the comment. I think it's just a very interesting analogy. Robnis v. Two, thanks for the shout out. Look at this. Props to pokebelly in all caps, in his trademark all caps. And honestly, am honored to even have Duchamp even brought up, as I said in my comment, you know, it genuinely feels like it wasn't just saying it for the, you know, to make some hay here out of stuff.
00:10:12.974 - 00:10:54.658, Speaker A: It genuinely felt like a Duchamp moment. And what was also interesting, as I mentioned yesterday, I don't think just anybody could have pulled that off. Like, I think, like, again, this is the guy who did the McDonald's resume, right? And when the bear market hit or when things started to go bad, like a year and a half ago now, or maybe that was a year ago. So he has a track record of doing this kind of thing. And so, yeah, so I think he's kind of uniquely positioned, shall we say, to actually kind of pull this off in a credible way. Okay. And then doing it and then having the idea and then doing it.
00:10:54.658 - 00:11:26.174, Speaker A: And a very nice comment here. Probably the best YouTube content actually referencing art. So thank you, Robnis, awesome to hear from you. It's great when there's people you've been talking about on the show chime in. I mean, as I said, you know, for a long time, the people that watch this show are the people who are in this show. So anyways, great to have you watching Robna. It's totally awesome and a big contributor to the thought, you know, not to use a cliche, but a thought leader in the space, as we all know, who pay attention.
00:11:26.174 - 00:11:48.810, Speaker A: And I just thought we could, uh, look at the, uh, the amount that have been minted. So he's at ten ETH now. Ten and a half ETH. So again, nice payday. Very, very nice. And RJ, you know, our out of recluse here, our artist in recluse, out of recluse now losing it over this. A crazy good collection of artists here.
00:11:48.810 - 00:12:23.046, Speaker A: Thank you so much for the inclusion. Pokebelly, as Robnis official has said, an honor. So that is totally awesome. And you know, again, this is like a visual journal or a video journal of basically kind of my thoughts on the scene. So it's kind of, it's not my point to go out there and really promote all these artists, but if that's an accidental effect of me just kind of saying, look at how great this is, and I can't believe, then I think that's awesome. So this is great. Like, you know, so that is great.
00:12:23.046 - 00:13:00.682, Speaker A: So awesome to hear, RJ, I'm a big fan and truly I was heartbroken to see those one of ones disappear on object about three weeks ago. Hasdrubal waffle or Hasdrubal wolf at Teen Wolf two. So back to the waffle situation here. Another awesome show, the AI Polaroids. Another clarification, actually, the AI Polaroids and Kappn's gift shop one of ones are so radio. Totally agree. Just to clarify, I am an animal lover too, with four cats and other assorted animals and a member of the humane society.
00:13:00.682 - 00:13:42.084, Speaker A: The pieces are juxtaposing dark films by Mique and Godard with the cuteness of Richard Scarry. So, yeah, and I never would have imagined actually that hasdrubal wolf, as he's now calling himself, was anything other than an animal lover. He's one of the nicest people you'll actually find on Twitter. So I wanted to make sure to highlight this though, because he, because it could be misconstrued, especially when I was saying, oh, I'm a cat lover. So it's hard to look at this one. But he is also a cat and animal lover. And as he actually says here, I just want to mention it because I am part animal after all.
00:13:42.084 - 00:14:03.788, Speaker A: So anyways, and there he is, the wolf. Hasdrubal wolf. So glad. Thank you for the clarification and happy to share that. And he also, I have to mention this. I mean, this is hilarious. He also posted Wesley Willis, who most of you might not be familiar with, but if you're of a certain age, Nirvana kind of made a big deal about Wesley Willis.
00:14:03.788 - 00:14:30.918, Speaker A: He was a guy who lived on the street but released an album that was kind of a cult classic. And a lot of us have had this album, Wesley Willis's greatest hits. And, you know, hasdrubal waffle might not believe me because I mentioned how I met Jello Biafra at his 50th birthday. There's just a few of us, at least in the afternoon there, and I still haven't found the picture. I need to email Vail. I hope to get Vail on a program. I haven't talked to him in years, maybe three or four years.
00:14:30.918 - 00:14:53.994, Speaker A: Anyways, I met Wesley Willis, believe it or not, Ezdrubble Wolf, when he came to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan on tour rock and roll McDonald's. We actually had a bit of a moment, which was hilarious. Very nice guy. I'm not. I'm not sure if he's still alive. So anyways, check out this rock'n'roll McDonald's. I would play this, but the copyright police will probably be on my tail if I do that.
00:14:53.994 - 00:15:23.470, Speaker A: And again, the waffle situation continues to mystify. So here's Santiago changing his name to Santiago. And I changed my name to that because the series neats by team wolf two hit 100 tokens and they will be back doing neat one of ones. So it's all greek to me over here. So interesting to follow what these guys are up to, though. And finally, and then we're actually going to look at some art here. The great poke.
00:15:23.470 - 00:16:01.564, Speaker A: Well, pokebally found the right title and this is what I wanted. So he's gone official is what I want to say. Acid boy is now officially a master of psychedelic abstraction. So I again, like I replied in the tweet, I don't know what else to call you. Like, what would you know? So anyways, master of psychedelic abstraction eight so has released his studio tour. And let me tell you, if you are a glitch person, this is for you. So you can hear, I don't know if you can hear it to make it look like this.
00:16:01.564 - 00:16:43.030, Speaker A: Anyone familiar with chroma king or green? So Eizo, the maker of extremely rich glitch work, is revealing all. So how cool is this. Look at this. He's like, use this HDMI converter. I mean, this is getting in the weeds, and so you have to love this. And then he shows the whole processor and a CRT television. So how cool is that? So if you are interested in knowing Eizo's process, whether you are a collector or an artist, and how he gets those incredibly rich textures, well, he reveals all how I glitch furniture for tomorrow's modern home furniture series.
00:16:43.030 - 00:16:59.338, Speaker A: How cool is that? So give that a like. Very cool. And here's the latest. So into the art we go. At last. So, future end table. So, as I, you know, so I think we could call this glitch, you know, in that category.
00:16:59.338 - 00:17:14.354, Speaker A: Weigh in if you feel otherwise. These are very. These categories blend into each other. But anyways, here is a very nice piece. Again, future end table. I was going to say, they almost look like speakers. Maybe they are a table and a speaker.
00:17:14.354 - 00:17:58.834, Speaker A: I'm not sure. You know, I used to have a name for this kind of furniture. I used to call it space age seventies, and I kind of feel like he's on the same tip a little bit. Like we're zeroing in on a similar dynamic, which was kind of architecture and furniture, shall we say, and that stylings from the seventies that were kind of space age. And I kind of feel like he's really just zeroed in and nailed on that whole vibe, aesthetic motif, whatever you want to call it. Elby, another glitch artist, checkered using Ederalv and a panasonic, I believe, mixer recorded with capture cards. So very cool.
00:17:58.834 - 00:18:21.494, Speaker A: So more of an abstract one from Elby. So again, these guys could hang in the same show. You could have, like, Elbie and Eizo and many more. There's max capacity and many more. Kurt Hussle Collective has a new three minute and 48 episode of the talk night show. So I'm not gonna. I'm not gonna play the whole thing, but I am gonna give you a taste.
00:18:21.494 - 00:18:27.114, Speaker A: So you know what's going on here, and it's kinda like a detective.
00:18:29.454 - 00:18:46.934, Speaker B: I'm currently driving downtown to DBO studios to look for clues following the disappearance of Trimmy T. Trimmer. I mean, several signs the public have witnessed, myself included, are leading me to believe this is a direct correlation with the broadcast catastrophe in 97.
00:18:47.474 - 00:19:12.458, Speaker A: So you're gonna have to go to his page to watch the whole thing. This is a one of one, by the way, and let's just see what happens here. You see that? So immaculate production here. And hilarious and everything we love about these guys. Again, one of one. And, yeah, paper trail. So kind of like a detective episode there.
00:19:12.458 - 00:19:40.354, Speaker A: So very cool from Kurt Hussle collective. And continuing on, I just found this on Twitter, which is, again, such a great art discovery tool, particularly for digital art. Right? Are you spiraling up or down? This is by Les Kogumelos, who I hadn't heard of before. A really cool GiF here. Almost like golden ratio stuff going on over here. And then. So he has a super rare.
00:19:40.354 - 00:20:06.842, Speaker A: So I checked that out. And so, again, Twitter is a real great discovery tool for digital artists, to state the obvious. And here you go again. So. And it's not like that was for sale. It was just, you know, posting his work. So, again, it's really worthwhile as an artist to just post your work, because it's just free advertising is really what it is, an opportunity.
00:20:06.842 - 00:20:47.340, Speaker A: We were talking about it, and I kind of hate the term funnel, using the consumer funnel or whatever it is. But the collector funnel, we've kind of been discussing here, and why not? We're in the business of art as well. And the funnel, you could argue one of the entry points into the funnel is posting your work on Twitter, and that doesn't mean you are posting something that you just minted. Okay, so we're back to that. And here I end up on super rare and on Les Cogimelo's page. So out of Brazil, interesting. Artist nurse of kindred by popple.
00:20:47.340 - 00:21:13.024, Speaker A: So the latest in the sanitarium series, and this you can buy for tentezos. I'm not sure if that's primary or secondary. So the mystery continues here with this mysterious monster series called sanitarium. Very interesting. Is this on primary? There's one left. It's probably gone by the time you watch this on primary for ten. So a cool 250 tezos, which is more than $300 these days.
00:21:13.024 - 00:21:32.724, Speaker A: And look at the little young birds here. And that looks like brain. That's great. Sometimes I have to look at this stuff twice if that's what's going on. And probably another amazing poem here. I'm going to risk reading this poem because. Because, again, I'm not a big poetry guy, but popple, I think, is a great writer.
00:21:32.724 - 00:22:11.948, Speaker A: She tends to them with gentle care, these creatures that others scare, their teeth and claws, their scales and horns, yet to her, they're just forlorn. There's a real romantic capital r, like 19th century kind of feel to his meter and to his rhyme. Wyrus, pixels, grace guy. Just a discovery on Twitter, you know. Here you go. Just a very basic contrast here of, you could say, like, brushwork and texture with big, chunky pixels. I was going to say almost reminiscent of Sky Goodman.
00:22:11.948 - 00:22:38.724, Speaker A: And there's sky Goodman chiming in. Beautiful. So that is cool. Anyways, nice piece, pixels. Gray sky. So also another, the recluses are coming out. Golitis, who I haven't heard or seen from since August, or I was in Crete, actually, it was maybe July was the last kind of mention I remember of gogolitis, and I hope to see him back.
00:22:38.724 - 00:22:59.984, Speaker A: He just put out this tweet yesterday. A late thank you for you guys for collecting on secondary, one of my early pixel art pieces, robotic delivery service. And if you don't know, go go Litus. He is like a pixel art classic. And there's a lot. I was on his page, so this is one of his pages here. This is second page.
00:22:59.984 - 00:23:18.384, Speaker A: I mean, this is a total classic here. And, you know, edition of 15 for 1770, giant cube Factory. This is an edition of 40, but this is a total classic as well. I think I brought this up. Here are some of the early works. I mean, color factory. Look at that.
00:23:18.384 - 00:23:41.392, Speaker A: And so here's mystery box factory, just to, you know, like, most of you who have been on tezos for six months, let's say, will know this, but a lot of you might not. So I share it. Like, look at how great this is. Kind of these pixel art factories is what I like to call them, and kind of playing on Mario a little bit. Beautiful. Beautiful work. Interesting color, too, this one.
00:23:41.392 - 00:24:36.334, Speaker A: So anyways, I hope to see go go Litus back. And look who else showed up, the guy who created the music for this show at the start, tradscape, who a lot of you will be familiar with, who also does the music at the end. I was lucky to buy both those nfts. And so anyways, tradscape on the scene after a hiatus of sorts. So interesting piece, too. Look at the elk or whatever it is, these beautiful pixels, and he makes all the music. You can kind of hear the waterfall in the background, kind of serene, beautiful, totally original, like a Tezos original artist.
00:24:36.334 - 00:25:16.914, Speaker A: So anyways, you can watch the full minute and listen. Shimmer falls, entrance to shimmer vaults guarded by a single sunbuck, does not appear on your map. Buy for 15, edition of 14, which is pretty low. And I brought up his page here. And as you see, like, yeah, that's not a bad deal at all there. And not financial advice, of course, buy art because you like it. There's a tweet I actually should have shown you where someone was like, I think, rare put it out, and he was showing how this other guy who was buying the open editions, someone else's open edition, and that his investment was going bad because he bought eleven or something.
00:25:16.914 - 00:25:49.292, Speaker A: Yeah, buy art because you like it. And I mean, you can speculate on it, but, I mean, it's not exactly a liquid investment, okay? And you got to be ready to sit on it, and it may not turn out. So buy what you like. My own collection, even if it went to zero. I was talking to a collector that messaged me about a week ago. I'm not concerned about that. I mean, it would suck, but I'm not concerned about that because I feel like I have a major cultural trove, as many of you do, who watch this program.
00:25:49.292 - 00:26:20.520, Speaker A: So, as we were saying, time, not money, is the real measure. That will be the real judge, shall we say. So, the market, you know, Tezos could easily go to $0.40 in the next six months. Okay. Am I going to regret buying all that art? No, because I think bigger things are at stake here. So, anyways, quick aside, there, he did this brilliant work for the hen reunion of the witch with this awesome music.
00:26:20.520 - 00:27:02.474, Speaker A: So anyways, and here's another one. I'm not sure what all this seemingly looking AI one of ones are, but he has this really great pixel art. I just don't know what it was a project that I never followed and wasn't sure about, but you can find some really great pixel art, like this guy, the Alchemist. And then I think novitiate or something. And he, of course, did the sewer king, which I'll play a little bit of. This was on the homepage object for a while. So very cool.
00:27:02.474 - 00:27:32.414, Speaker A: And the audio, like, again, he made the music for this show. Like, I bought the NFT, but he's a very talented musician and artist. Okay, so hopefully tradscape will continue to release. That would be awesome. Another kind of pixels and sound. So I believe we saw manital from the tarot, the cat tarot. I believe it's the same artist here, because it looks almost identical.
00:27:32.414 - 00:27:59.750, Speaker A: So this is on form function. Pretty soothing. Would make a nice gift. So anyway, cool work from Mantel. Working with P with one. So maybe P with one did the P, one did the music. And we also recognize him from tazos.
00:27:59.750 - 00:28:38.634, Speaker A: So very cool, rustic digital art with a work called Don Quixote. So we see windmills made out of the crop. Mario Brothers. So now I've only read the first hundred pages of Don Quixote, and you gotta love the first or, sorry, this cloud that looks like a mountain, but then leaves this tiny little thing here. So you're really not sure if it's a cloud, the irrationality. But I have read enough of Don Quixote, and I actually really want to pick it back up because it feels like a must read. But the great thing about Don Quixote that I remember is it's totally this mad guy who is hallucinating constantly.
00:28:38.634 - 00:29:16.498, Speaker A: And so maybe, you know, and, you know, Dali loved Don Quixote and Don Quixote, as my girlfriend would say, she's from Bolivia. And, you know, I think Dali kind of was very inspired from a mythological, like, on a personal level, by the spirit of Don Quixote. So, anyways, so interesting, I think reference in the context of what I keep calling this very kind of irrational celebration of irrationality in this series here. So very interesting. One of one at auction for 50. And continuing on. I already know who's.
00:29:16.498 - 00:29:49.302, Speaker A: Yeah, it's Santiago's. I always know Santiago's works because they take a while to load because they're 10,000 pixels large, parallel, unrelated, forgotten memories of my childhood. So another abstraction here using vector shapes that came from stable diffusion made soda cans in space and other random thoughts. So it's pretty cool. And again, I like the square here. I don't think we showed this yesterday. It's pretty cool how you can take things from just anywhere and then kind of process them and then be left with something in his style.
00:29:49.302 - 00:30:18.300, Speaker A: So what is this going for? Buy for eight? And, yeah, this just was listed this morning. So we didn't show this yesterday. Excellent. So anyways, there are 14 left as I record this. And this. Also, some more information on it, actually, a screenshot of my desktop background, which is today a digital painting made on inkscape using vector shapes that came from stable diffusion made soda cans in space. And other random thoughts.
00:30:18.300 - 00:30:52.800, Speaker A: I mean, almost reminiscent at a distant level with dye, with the most likes, kind of stream of consciousness sort of style here, which goes very well, frankly, with this kinda. With this kind of art. It's kind of stream of consciousness art to a certain degree, but we're overstating things and we're not being super careful with our terms. Let's move on. At first, I thought this was venta intro void. So another artist that is using these sampled, you see, kind of sampled brushes. And so just very interesting, like, treatment, we could say.
00:30:52.800 - 00:31:24.604, Speaker A: And hard contrast here. Of this kind of staircase in the background with the fuzzy sun here. So I thought a very interesting work. Again with the cube here and the kind of, for lack of a better term, roughed up face with paint work. Kind of reminiscent of bacon, Francis Bacon on a distant level, isn't it? Especially with this space here, this created space. So very, very interesting. Digital painting on the blockchain, courtesy of intro void reserve of point.
00:31:24.604 - 00:31:49.740, Speaker A: And hopefully we'll come back to their work at a future point as well. Hasdrubal waffle. Sorry, wolf. Hasdrubal wolf with a new work that will be minted tomorrow. Or minted it was minted January 29. Deleted scene from Videodrome where James woods loses his last bag of cheese puffs inside his abdomen. So maybe this was released.
00:31:49.740 - 00:32:10.780, Speaker A: I haven't looked. We don't have time to go through, but we will return, obviously, to Hasdrubal wolf. I thought this was just a nice gif. As we kind of move into an illustration area, the atoms that make up my body dissolve night after night and float in the air. This is by Mireille Mizu. And how are we doing for time here? Good. 32 minutes.
00:32:10.780 - 00:32:30.084, Speaker A: This is excellent. So just an interesting work here that I thought was attractive. Not minted anywhere that I know of. And Flora Marquez with a beautiful work that's at auction. 31 January. I don't want to be a bad ghost. So these seem to be developing and getting more ambitious.
00:32:30.084 - 00:33:01.390, Speaker A: So it's looking really beautiful. And I'd love to pick up another one of one from Flora Marquez, who has her own kind of little mythology. And I just love the treatment of this, as I keep saying, almost what looked like mistakes or erased brush marks here. And she keeps it just Warhol's creed, you know, embrace your mistakes. And Flora Marquez is doing that here. Antonio loves with another one, and I believe this. I don't think we've seen this yet either.
00:33:01.390 - 00:33:24.282, Speaker A: Angel Saints prophet 16, Mount Horeb. So an interesting one with face for a son. And I so kind of another one of these kind of mystical works here. This almost looks like a staff that's also a flute. And so very mysterious work. I think that's part of the joy of Antonio's work. And shout out, thanks for the comment, Antonio.
00:33:24.282 - 00:33:54.324, Speaker A: Glad you're liking the curation here. I'm like the accidental curator is what I am, because I have zero ambitions to curate, but that's what I do every day here, which is kind of funny. Maybe not zero ambitions, but you know what I'm saying. So anyways, just fascinating work here. I mean, it's easy to overlook, but you see the clouds, which are kind of strange and suggestive, a tiny bit, and then you have these stars in the middle. I think, people, it feels like art to me, let's put it that way. So, edition of seven.
00:33:54.324 - 00:34:27.369, Speaker A: This is on secondary for 42. The collectors are loving it. And again sold for 1777 on primary. So very cool. Turkarak, who, you know, I categorize with Ezra Eslin and die with the most likes, is always kind of plain like. There's a slight, what's the word? Always playing with questions of taste and also kind of a dark vision of human nature, shall we say? Or just kind of an edgy satirical vision. So here's another one.
00:34:27.369 - 00:34:53.513, Speaker A: Kind of picnickers and maybe a mysterious work for me. Maybe other people have a. Looks like they're just kind of. I think you call that shotgunning, where you just down a beer and they're just, you know, in nature here on some grass, at least. And kind of a more ambitious background, from what I can tell here. Almost a painterly background for Turk rack. And even the treatment of the figures is a little bit more painterly here.
00:34:53.513 - 00:35:22.643, Speaker A: Interesting development from Turk rack. This was picked up. How much for 15 from Captain Kimmy, who also likes Turk rack. I've noticed Porta Malmar. So remember, our collage artist has raised the prices. Remember, you could put in an offer for like three or four tezos. Now this digital collage artist, now they want 20, which I think is totally legit, especially after they've kind of paid their dues and they've given away, frankly, a lot of art for almost nothing.
00:35:22.643 - 00:35:52.378, Speaker A: So here's a new one. Ousted no es sumente collage number 634. Nice resolution by Porta Malmar. So very cool. And continuing on into AI we go, Marina Amadova with a beautiful work here that just showed up on Twitter. I'm not sure if this has been minted, but it looks great. Again, AI really just stretching the possibilities here.
00:35:52.378 - 00:36:23.054, Speaker A: Just making combinations that you just never would have thought of without the AI. I assume this is AI done in Marina Amidova's trademark style. You know, there's a book that I've mentioned previously called the Nature of Technology, which is actually a fascinating book. I've only read the first 3rd, but it goes through, actually, the philosophy of technology. Was a financial guy that was recommending it. Big bitcoin lover from the trad finance world. I can't remember his name.
00:36:23.054 - 00:36:54.754, Speaker A: Bill. He wears the bitcoin hat. Interviewed every six months or so. Anyways, in the philosophy of technology, combination is one of the elements that brings about new technology. So you may have the elements of a jet engine, like a semiconductor, and then some, you know, piece of metal that is, you know, advanced. And once they come together, then all of a sudden you have a jet engine. And that is kind of how tech, one of the ways that technology moves forward.
00:36:54.754 - 00:37:29.764, Speaker A: And I kind of see that with AI here. We're seeing different elements, say, like these abstract circular elements are being combined with the individual, like, say a traditional painting of a person, of a young woman here. And they're being combined. And that is really the evolution that we're seeing here. None of these on their own are original, but when you put them together, the bubbles and the flowers put this way, and then the portrait and then these strange, amazing flowers, then it all becomes kind of new. So that's the evolution. Really nice there, too.
00:37:29.764 - 00:38:23.076, Speaker A: So anyways, very cool. Our pirate ship in the sky artist Marteau also put out another beautiful work, spiralure. So she's on a roll and just kind of a magical kind of ninja figure coming out of the clouds here and a, what looks like a middle eastern city in the background here, or architecture almost looks like, you know, 14th century Baghdad, if I had to guess or something. So anyways, very interesting from Mardo and Zoom, finally with some rooms here, some very nice additions to her AI artist studio works here. So here is one and here is another kind of focusing on the chair. Interesting how she's, you know, the roughness. I really like there's always this balance between the roughness and the painterliness.
00:38:23.076 - 00:38:47.696, Speaker A: And so anyways, it's very fun to watch Zoom evolve here. Speaking of evolution, and this looks like there's maybe a bed, I'm not sure. So it's so suggestive, you can't even tell. Again, impressionistic. And these beautiful brushstrokes here, but created by AI, so very cool. And a new polaroid from Danielle King. A new AI portrait via Polaroid.
00:38:47.696 - 00:39:06.298, Speaker A: Very brilliant idea. And this one's quite convincing. Beautiful piece. One of one. Let's just see if it sold, if it has been listed yet. Listed for 50 and sold within two and a half hours to Klaus Vilca. And that, my friends, is the show.
00:39:06.298 - 00:39:39.266, Speaker A: Let me just show you this piece of technology because we do like to keep tabs. So this is a VR thing. I know I'm late to the party here, but Maestro is a fantastic concept. It's more than just another VR music rhythm game using hand tracking, you take control of a full orchestra. Oh, and this demo is free. Okay, so just to give you a clue here, so there is VR conducting games, I guess. And visually quite interesting, isn't it? I mean, a lot of us have used video games.
00:39:39.266 - 00:40:05.694, Speaker A: It's like a trope, using video games as a kind of visual template to make artwork. And so, you know, using that logic, then we can start to look at the VR and go, well, how is that going to transform into art? Look at this. I mean, pretty cool. Amazing. So anyway, I'll stop that before the copyright police come. Thank you for joining me once again. I hope to see you on Twitter spaces tomorrow.
00:40:05.694 - 00:40:11.834, Speaker A: Come in, chime in. It's always a great discussion. Thank you for joining me. And until next time, take care.
