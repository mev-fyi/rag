00:00:02.280 - 00:00:11.758, Speaker A: Here we go again. It's almost vacation time. I'm getting excited, actually. I'm going to Rhodes. It's really close to Turkey. Rhodes, Greece. In August.
00:00:11.758 - 00:00:36.214, Speaker A: I may do live shows. I think two weeks is too long to not do a show. But all to say. Artist journal, July 10, 2023, broadcasting from the cruise ship in my mind as we sail across the sky in Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Focabelli, and probably a lot of you saw this image. It was. I love the color on it.
00:00:36.214 - 00:01:08.454, Speaker A: It's by Mikey Wilson. Again, the promise of this space. Here's someone, as far as I know. I mean, I don't think Mikey really put out any AI before, like, max, three months ago. And correct me if I'm wrong, Mikey, if you happen to see this, but here has just been evolving and evolving and developing, and all of a sudden, it's like, mikey's like, you know, one of my favorite AI artists. You know, like, maybe you feel the same way. I mean, look at the incredible texture on the coat.
00:01:08.454 - 00:02:00.244, Speaker A: Look at this beautiful painterliness, and, like. And it's back to this idea that I want to say, like, it's some beautiful painting by Mikey, but it brings up this whole idea. Like, of course, he's not the person that actually made the brushstrokes, but he did guide it. And, you know, it's back to this idea of the artist as editor. The artist as editor in the sense that if we use the analogy, you know, he's not writing the text, and then he's more like an editor at a newspaper that says, hey, give me a story on this. I want Bob Dylan playing a guitar with a fireplace, maybe a window, and make the guitar red and a coffee cup in the front. Let's say if he's using the imagine prompt, which would be unbelievable.
00:02:00.244 - 00:02:30.840, Speaker A: That would be unbelievable. I'm using the blend prompt. If you can do this with imagine, you know how to do your prompting. So back to this idea. It's the artist as editor rather than the artist as the writer, you know? And so it kind of just puts a different spin on authorship here, because it does take a lot of skill. Like, if you actually try AI art, it's not like it's a completely different way of working. It's not like you're bringing up your.
00:02:30.840 - 00:02:59.636, Speaker A: It's not like any brush is required, but you do need a certain amount of, for lack of better term taste. You need a certain amount of judgment. I mean, that's a better way of putting it. And you need some imagination. And you also need to know how to kind of get what you need, how to use the tools. You know, to quote Ed Marolla, ahead of time here, you got to learn how to use the tools. So that is what Mikey Wilson is doing.
00:02:59.636 - 00:03:42.682, Speaker A: And now you're starting to get some pretty stunning results. I mean, if I saw this in a local gallery as a painting, you know, I would probably be pretty impressed. I say, this is beautiful color. Look at that red guitar. That beautiful red guitar. If you said, what's your favorite part of the piece? I'm really torn between the beautiful texture of the coat, which seems gloriously painted here, beautifully rendered, just beautifully rendered here, and the color, this beautiful white and, you know, the gray with the beautiful red guitar and everything, and just that painterly floor and everything. So a beautiful work here.
00:03:42.682 - 00:04:11.734, Speaker A: Looks like Bob Dylan to me. I'm not sure even that beautiful bandana and everything. So beautiful work here from Mikey Wilson, available for 20 tezos on secondary, sold out for ten on primary. And so there's oxine Padrino. Yeah, so Buzzaya, Michele Kelowna, Mopey Wellington. So, yeah, beautiful work here from Mikey Wilson, and it is being recognized. Make art, not friends blues.
00:04:11.734 - 00:04:59.030, Speaker A: So beautiful. And thank you, everybody who collected this work here. Sybil, kind of a, you know, I was talking to Clownvamp on the last Twitter spaces, which I actually just uploaded last night. So if you make AI art, or if you're just interested, that is a wonderful episode. He shares a lot of, I guess, for lack of a better term, alpha on how he a lot about his process. And as I was explaining to clownvamp, I'm really into the blend function with mid journey, where you can, instead of using the imagine prompt, the blend prompt, I just put in old artworks and start combining them together and started getting pretty magical stuff. So, anyways, I'm thrilled about what's coming out.
00:04:59.030 - 00:05:20.436, Speaker A: And then, of course, you iterate. And it's not like it's a one and done. You process and process, change the colors, bring it into other programs and on and on. But very fascinating. So AI with editing is what I'm calling the description of the work here. And thank you, everybody, for collecting it. More on the way, maybe today.
00:05:20.436 - 00:05:50.226, Speaker A: And thank you to Valdez Vampy Tez for it's already up in a gallery here with some really great works. We're going to look at this one, actually. We're going to look at that, and we're going to look at Smonter's awesome new work there. And there's Pipi universal wasteman gold minevitch with the Bill Gates food paste. We've seen that one. Board me social club Turkarak with a risky work and morlacos and Santiago gloom tube. And there we are, already in a gallery within 24 hours.
00:05:50.226 - 00:06:03.592, Speaker A: So that is thrilling. Thank you, Valdez. And continuing on, thank you, Lord Misfit. This is hilarious. And there's the ship in the background. There we and everything go. I'm glad you're enjoying the show.
00:06:03.592 - 00:06:29.644, Speaker A: That means a lot to me and it's just really cool. So thank you for the Gif here. Also, some comments on I noticed I miss a lot of comments on the tweets. We can't hit everything, but I do. This one really warmed my heart, so I wanted to read it, boss. Grazias. We have enjoyed each image, each artist watching with family on a Sunday afternoon.
00:06:29.644 - 00:06:52.926, Speaker A: That warms my heart and that makes me very happy. I take pride on making this as much of a family show as possible, a classy kind of entertainment experience. And so I'm thrilled. I want people to be able to watch this with their kids and to learn and have fun. This is a big mission accomplished for me. So thank you for that comment and thank you everybody else. India robot.
00:06:52.926 - 00:07:17.886, Speaker A: That was hilarious. And Haiti Rocket, Treeskullstown, Jnk walk, Natty and regular Jake and Kurt Hussle collective. And finally, a couple of more comments here. Just thank you, Bumbattle also for the very nice comment. And Mick renders rata and runetune. I want to read this one out. People say I have pretty big gaps when it comes to crypto art.
00:07:17.886 - 00:07:33.836, Speaker A: So, quoting last show, my response to that is that we all do. No one has the time or bandwidth to not have pretty big gaps in their consumption and awareness of all that crypto art that is out there. Exactly. Yes. So. Exactly. You know, everybody brings what they have to the table.
00:07:33.836 - 00:07:59.108, Speaker A: And if you the thing is like, it's better to start something without being totally prepared than to wait till you're 100% prepared before you start something like the show or an artwork or whatever your project is. Because if you wait, you can always prepare more. So you just got to jump in the deep end. So, yeah, so thank you for the comment there, and thank you. Santiago is a codal. Great episode. Thanks for the commentary on this topics.
00:07:59.108 - 00:08:23.044, Speaker A: And I think probably referring to the crypto art here. So anyways, great to hear from everybody and thank you for the support. Just really nice to hear. So Ed put out a new show, and Ed's actually got like 14 or 15 more subscribers since we last looked here. So he's at 259 subscribers. Pixel art Marolla style episode three. And I put a comment, just awesome.
00:08:23.044 - 00:08:38.576, Speaker A: Pixel network is growing. And I kind of like how art has been removed from the pixel. I was calling it the Pixel art network. Pixel network. I think that's pretty cool. So what I did, I did a search on Pixel.net work.
00:08:38.576 - 00:09:05.336, Speaker A: Some actually, small business owns it. You might be able to get it. But what I did is I actually bought the Pixel network. And then I did Pixel network with a p one, x three l, sort of like strange things, style. So I also bought that just because it's too much fun. And maybe we just do it very lo fi, organic. You just have two feeds, you know, just a web page that collects the videos.
00:09:05.336 - 00:09:41.252, Speaker A: You know, start very slow, simple, because who needs another project, right? But if we just keep it really simple, that could be a lot of fun. So just very, very fun. Chimasuku Jackson so showing the Kurt Hussle collective live, you know, so Chimasu Jackson and the hologram gallery, which again is in Seattle, Washington, downtown. And I'll have to visit at some point. I do have relatives in the city. This week I had the pleasure of hosting Kurt Hussle 90 seven's first solo show at Hologram Gallery. It was a great experience and dope to see web3 in real life.
00:09:41.252 - 00:10:08.156, Speaker A: Immersive installation. The cyberslums were popping and there you see like a physical emulation of what we were seeing in the cyber slums. Even the ceiling almost looks like it's done in cyberslam style. I don't know if maybe that's the normal decoration. But all to say they have the tvs, everything, it looks like a cyberslum. So they emulated it quite beautifully. And there's even different tvs with different commercials.
00:10:08.156 - 00:10:23.828, Speaker A: They did a really nice job here. The lighting, all the different VCR's and everything. Just very cool. So congrats to that. Just some interesting comments. 6529. Most NFT art is unconsciously copying physical art.
00:10:23.828 - 00:10:59.464, Speaker A: Almost everything is a 2d rectangle and approximately the dimensions that would make sense in a physical gallery. It is natural at this first stage, but eventually will look quaint. Well, yeah, I don't know if I. I was actually going to highlight Dana Ulama's quote, but, you know, 2d physical art static, will that eventually look quaint? I. Leonardo is everything that's ever been, that's all gonna look quaint. 2d rectangle. I don't know.
00:10:59.464 - 00:11:42.514, Speaker A: Like, I actually have a special kind of deference. You know what it is? It's almost like what I love actually about it doesn't need to be a rectangle. It can be like, I think we're calling that a tende or something. The circular work, it can be circular, but the flat, what I love about it is actually that boundary there that makes a work, that empty canvas. What it does is it kind of separates actually, the artwork from the external world. And in there, anything is possible. It's kind of like where you can juxtapose any two ideas in the world, and there's nothing like that anywhere.
00:11:42.514 - 00:12:35.324, Speaker A: I would argue maybe writing, maybe in writing, but where else do you have that kind of space? So it's kind of a window into a universe, quite literally a window shape. So I'm not quite sure that the 2d rectangle is going to look quaint, but that's not why I brought this up. But, and, you know, just a final comment on this, actually. Like, I want to see 6520 nine's art. If 6529 is such an expert in, you know, in all this, in art making, where's 6520 nine's art? You know, so it's, this will all look so all our, all your work's gonna look quaint according to 6529, if you're doing 2d rectangle work. Okay, so continuing on, Dana Ulama. This is what I wanted to highlight, the word Nft art.
00:12:35.324 - 00:12:59.654, Speaker A: So most NfT art, the word Nft art never really made sense to me. It's like saying MP3 musician. And as for digital art, not installations, it makes sense that they somehow follow the device dimensions on which they are viewed on. So I would say the shape of a computer has more influence on digital art than the shape of a physical painting. Yeah. And we have discussed this in the past. It's actually a super interesting discussion.
00:12:59.654 - 00:13:58.748, Speaker A: I discussed it with Clownvamp, actually, this idea that its horizontal works are more rare because of, by nature of the media that we're working on. You can see the fly in the background here and that there is even, there is a bias towards the portrait versus landscape mode or towards vertical work. And it's quite interesting. We were discussing that in regards to Clownvamp, who knew he was making art for a tv. So the 16 by nine ratio there. So that impacted how his work was made for that show in New York. It's a very interesting discussion and yeah, I'd have to say, yeah, yeah, I think this is maybe 6529 is just trying to be provocative here and drum up some traffic continuing on.
00:13:58.748 - 00:14:21.258, Speaker A: Ben, this is a little long, but we're just going to touch on a few things here. I'd like to share some thoughts on the current state of the on chain art market, where I think it goes from here, and the opportunity. I see. So where are we? Things are slow, but. How slow? Combined sales volume on super rare and foundation in June was $2.1 million. So one month, $2.1
00:14:21.258 - 00:14:44.304, Speaker A: million. I mean, that's not terrible. Down 61% from June 2022. So last year was $5.4 million and down 96% from October 2021 of $56 million, the peak of the last bull market. But we have to say that was probably total madness over there at that point. I mean, that was arguably the biggest speculative bubble in the history of the world.
00:14:44.304 - 00:15:05.164, Speaker A: And it probably was like, it's not even an exaggeration. You buy your bored ape yacht club for, you know, $100 and watch that go to like 300, $400,000. I think it peaked out at $600,000. Bored ape yacht club. So, yeah, I mean, that was probably. That puts the tulip mania to shame. Right.
00:15:05.164 - 00:15:43.004, Speaker A: Continuing on, it's down even more in ETH term since June 2022 and down less in ETH term since 2021. So all to say, I guess this is what I wanted to show, is it's slowing down. But what's interesting, I think, and it's kind of back to this tezos, it's a feature, not a bug, is look at Mikey Wilson selling his stuff. I'm selling my art. I mean, a lot of people are still selling their art, as you're going to see in this episode. So it doesn't. You don't need to be making $10,000 a work if you're bringing in $100 a work, that's still, like, for an artist, that's good.
00:15:43.004 - 00:16:11.476, Speaker A: That's good news. You know, that's good news. It's not a bad day, you know, unless you're coming down from selling your works at 10,000 and then you're getting 100, maybe that's a bad day, but overall, things aren't so bad. So this is really long. But what I want to highlight is basically, this account basically says, here it is. Well, it's a tough time for money. The good news is that other people's apathy is your opportunity.
00:16:11.476 - 00:16:39.334, Speaker A: Whether you're a collector, artist or builder, if you're a collector, it means less competition to bring home great works. As scarce as capital is, conviction is even scarcer. So if you still have capital, and conviction. You're in a phenomenal position. If you're an artist, it means you can really stand out in the coming months. If you stick around and double down on what you're doing here, if you come out of this bear market with a stronger skill set and a stronger network than you had coming into it, you'll be in a wonderful position. That's true.
00:16:39.334 - 00:17:18.083, Speaker A: This person goes quite in depth, interestingly so. Sees opportunity with emerging artists, AI art, interestingly. And let's just see what and establish artists on the secondary. Let's just look at what they say about AI art and move on. I believe the opportunity in AI art right now is somewhat akin to generative art in early 21. AI is one of the biggest technological and cultural themes of our time and arguably one of the biggest unlocks art has ever seen. I think we see that with the Mikey Wilson, you know, again, like, you see how fast it can happen.
00:17:18.083 - 00:17:50.312, Speaker A: So it's pretty interesting and impressive. So just kind of an interesting comment on the market there. And another one, Beanie Maxi hearing from multiple NFT collection founders that they want to exit, but that nobody's that, but that there's nobody acquiring these companies. So these are more like these PFP projects that are kind of like quasi companies of sorts. Royalty revenues are non existent. Right? Remember blur and new mints simply aren't selling. And new mints simply aren't selling.
00:17:50.312 - 00:18:30.334, Speaker A: So the magic is gone a little bit in the NFt PfP scene. Venture capital funding in the space has evaporated. Young smart builders want to move, want to move on, but feel trapped. And this is something that people warn you about, that if you start a, like an NFT project and you offer utility with that project, I own this NFT, therefore I get certain privileges. People never, you're wed to those people forever. And after you make your first sale, then what do you do? So it's just interesting. So continuing on, so figments Kappn with another magical work here, too, actually.
00:18:30.334 - 00:19:17.120, Speaker A: And it continues on with this figure here looking in a landscape. It's almost like a drive in movie theater with mountains in the background. And interestingly here it looks like a sun and a sea and this beautiful figure. And some of my favorite parts of these captain works, or figments, I should say, are these kind of flashing areas here and then almost like these little pac man esque pixels that are just kind of rotating around. And again, that contrast between the black and white and the color, the moving and the static, like what a interesting crop on the moon here. Like, I was almost like, is my screen cutting this off? Like. And then this beautiful floor again, that looks like Ultima four.
00:19:17.120 - 00:19:34.446, Speaker A: Some of the floor in, like, the. In the castles there. So really interesting, fascinating work here. Here's another one that was just released. Htrae cosmic dust. So this one is also. They're both going for about 20 tazos.
00:19:34.446 - 00:19:51.140, Speaker A: This one's 18. So they're very popular. And the flippers like them, too, because they're so popular. So you've got to act really fast. I mean, not a terrible price compared to the original. I think the original is eight. Yeah, it sold for eight, so you can buy it for 17.77.
00:19:51.140 - 00:20:17.622, Speaker A: So just a really, really cool series from figments continues to just evolve. Here is element li. I came very close to starting with this work. There's something gorgeously warholian about this work, isn't there? But it's totally its own thing. Again, this experimental pixel art. This is a green onion, I think is what you'd call that green onion. 200 pixels by 200 pixels.
00:20:17.622 - 00:20:34.522, Speaker A: Kind of looks like Germany, where they call organic bio action means sale. And this looks like a euro sign. €1.39 even. The sign is gorgeously done. The color and everything. This is a beautiful work of art.
00:20:34.522 - 00:20:47.844, Speaker A: I don't know where it's minted. I don't think it has been minted. So. So, yeah, so just beautiful, beautiful work by element ly. Here's another one. And this looks more like a classical painting here. Cloud.
00:20:47.844 - 00:21:09.510, Speaker A: And this looks like someone on a cloud here. And it's just beautiful. This beautiful, you know, pixel art, experimental pixel art that, you know, is instantly recognizable as elemently. It's nice color there, too. So, looking forward to see where these are going to be minted. And here's one more by elemently. This one a little bit more closer to a photograph, you might say.
00:21:09.510 - 00:21:37.422, Speaker A: And this looking like somewhere in, you know, looks like the western United States or something in Nevada or something like that. So just beautiful work here from element ly. 150 pixels by 150 pixels. Not minted anywhere, I don't think. This came out last week, PP universal with some really cool works. I picked up a copy of this, this he man here. And I gotta say, this technique, there is something to be said for it.
00:21:37.422 - 00:22:06.632, Speaker A: Just basically seemingly tracing the outline and filling it with pattern is quite powerful. But not as simple as that either, because we see, you know, the hair is quite nicely done and everything. So it's not purely flat, but it's quite an effective technique, isn't it. You see it in the arm here and even the background. I find this quite beautiful small edition number, the real he man. I think there are seven tezos each, and. Yeah, so just really cool.
00:22:06.632 - 00:22:37.672, Speaker A: And here's another one by PP Universal. These two crash test dummies, you know, about to kiss. And again, just beautiful texture there in the background and everything. There's something really just powerful in PP Universal's technique here, when you both know it will end in disaster, but you don't care. And the whole poetry, these crash test dummies, you know, these sad crash test dummies. So pretty powerful stuff. Small edition numbers.
00:22:37.672 - 00:22:59.932, Speaker A: I picked that up, too. There is me in a picnic, which is kind of funny, this crocodile entering the picnic ground, or the, you know, the blanket here and the little picnic basket, and maybe a PEPC. So very cool work here. And this one's pretty funny. Seven tazos. How many are left? There are three left by PP universal. Powerful technique.
00:22:59.932 - 00:23:15.052, Speaker A: Learn the tools. Watch me create this. So, Ed is starting to combine his YouTube with his nfts. I love it. 20 tezos, an edition of 16, sent me one. Thank you. And here it is, just, I think.
00:23:15.052 - 00:23:37.474, Speaker A: So watch me make this. So you can watch Ed make this work on YouTube. So how cool is that? Leaving the trail here. Watch me create this. So that is just very cool, like, where that's going. You can probably recognize the artist here, some experimentation. RJ with a work I am online.
00:23:37.474 - 00:24:08.412, Speaker A: I'm not sure if that's the title, but very cool work. Again, kind of like these Hockney esque figures here, kind of mysteriously looking off into. At the wall here, or almost into themselves, looking into their own minds here. Look at this great green outline here. And then it's. But it's the same outline as the wall, and this figure is almost blending in with the wall. And so very interesting experimentation here from RJ.
00:24:08.412 - 00:24:27.744, Speaker A: Really nice how it kind of the. The floor, pat the. The lines on the floor just kind of extend a little bit higher here, kind of making it not too perfect. Very nice work here. Even these strange colors on the side here, the plant. Just really interesting work. Popple with a new work here.
00:24:27.744 - 00:24:55.408, Speaker A: Mermaid of Speliotham. I hope I'm pronouncing that right. In a cavern's depth where shadows weave resides a mermaid, the ghost of Eve, with skin of moonstone as pale as despair. She dwells with a lurking monster in her lair. So popple showing off his writing skills, and here the face kind of turns into a monster here again. So the mon. So the mermaid in the cave here.
00:24:55.408 - 00:25:19.756, Speaker A: And just beautifully, this almost looks like an octopus here. Some sort of octopus monster. So just another look at the shimmering green turning to like blue and almost turquoise in here. That shimmering is just gorgeous. The colors are gorgeous in this. So the more you look at it, the more you kind of fall into it. Only 21 tezos here on secondary.
00:25:19.756 - 00:25:44.756, Speaker A: Get it while you can. Went for primary for 16, so you can still get it at a pretty reasonable price. Muji with a new work, cyber brick. Changing the colors a little bit here. Going with a green and this beautiful sort of pixelated inside of the square here, another screen here. And just a gradient that is cycling through with, again, some astronomical backgrounds. And this beautifully dithered gradient.
00:25:44.756 - 00:26:05.844, Speaker A: This is an addition of ten already 40 tezos on secondary and sold out at 13 on primary and sold out within an hour. So pretty nice haul actually, in 3 hours. Sorry, 420. It sold the last one. So very cool. Great work. Look at this work by human kernel.
00:26:05.844 - 00:26:20.486, Speaker A: This looks like Robocop, doesn't it? Peep cop day. Peep cop day. So maybe that's it. Pip cop day by human kernel edition of a hundred. I own two. I guess they sent me two, unless I bought one. That's pretty funny.
00:26:20.486 - 00:26:34.034, Speaker A: Look at that. Great background. Just an awesome. And over here, beautifully, beautifully done. I think this is Santiago. I'm not sure it's beautiful though, that much I know. And.
00:26:34.034 - 00:26:54.374, Speaker A: Yeah, so here it is. Beautiful piece. And it looks pretty reminiscent here to Santiago's work here. Auberd, I think this came out on Saturday here. My entry for object. For object two. So there's a lot of aubergine works that were being made here.
00:26:54.374 - 00:27:11.120, Speaker A: I never, I didn't really know the details on that. But anyway, a cool work here. And just another nice abstract here from Santiago, still available for one tazos. And another super cool abstract here. This one's in black and white. A little bit more ambitions. Ambitious from.
00:27:11.120 - 00:27:52.660, Speaker A: Not a number in the composition here, just more experimentation. Not just the simple gradient, but some kind of interesting squares here. It's almost like a really big dithering is being combined with really small dithering, which is actually a very powerful technique combining different pixel sizes. That is very interesting technique because what generally happens with pixel art is you tend to have your one size of canvas and you tend to stick to it. And so to do a whole bunch, let's say you're working with these tiny pixels to make these big pixels. You're not going to draw each one of these out. I mean, you might, but it'll be a lot of work.
00:27:52.660 - 00:28:25.840, Speaker A: So usually what's a good idea is you take like, 100 pixel by 100 pixel canvas and then put it into Photoshop, and then take a ten pixel by ten pixel canvas, and then you stretch it with reach the nearest edge or whatever that is. Right. With the transform so it doesn't distort. And all of a sudden, you're getting completely different size of pixels, and it makes a nice effect. That's kind of what looks like is going on here a little bit interesting kind of gray version, too. And this looks like it's sold. It did for five tezos to mick renders.
00:28:25.840 - 00:28:44.088, Speaker A: So these are selling all of them. It's great. This is really cool, too. Who did this? This is Mika Oladev, who we saw collaborate, I believe, with Sky Goodman last week. So glitch artist. And so just interesting glitching here of an eye. So just more interesting work here.
00:28:44.088 - 00:29:08.206, Speaker A: Interesting crop and composition and nice noise here. Beautiful texture pixels. So this is also by Kappin, if I am not mistaken. And so here is multipixular. So basically playing with biology and pixel art. So, and almost these kind of marble like works here. And I think I brought up.
00:29:08.206 - 00:29:33.198, Speaker A: Yeah, there are a few of these were released, and so here they are, all sold out, as far as I can tell. Here's one for 50. So one of, you know, Kappn's many them projects, there's plants, there's figments, there's pixels, there's Kappn. Maybe there are more. There's also Kappen's gift shop, so you got to love it. Francoise Gamma with a new Rom. This one was quite experimental.
00:29:33.198 - 00:30:04.736, Speaker A: What I really like about Francois Gamma's Nintendo glitch Roms is how different they are. They're quite experimental, which is really interesting to see. And so they really bring their own flavor. I mean, this looks like a racing game, doesn't it? It looks like a racing game, like you're going down the road, but it's so abstracted that it's just become this completely other thing. So that's still available on primary. There are three left at three tezos. Mo shit with a cool landscape.
00:30:04.736 - 00:30:32.040, Speaker A: This kind of looks like a. We're discussing sampling video games with Santiago's abstracts. This kind of feels like a little bit of sampling video games, too, doesn't it? I mean, this looks like kind of some video game here, or just glitched out video game. It looks like those kind of has that kind of glitch rom feel to it. I thought it was just an interesting work here. It's a one of one for 20 tezos landscape. So nice piece there.
00:30:32.040 - 00:30:58.804, Speaker A: Manital working with explainer gallery, who is working with a ton of artists on tezos, smartly, brilliantly. And here is a new one. And look at this. Almost like the video game vibe in this one too. As you go down, as you cycle through the different categories here, the character costume or the character basically changes. So a bit of a video game feeling to this one, too. Nice little spider cat, everything.
00:30:58.804 - 00:31:21.164, Speaker A: Just beautiful work from Manital edition of 25 to this. This has not gone for sale yet. Here's Cyberhens. And this actually has some sound. It's actually interactive where you can actually play with sound. So you see the guy with the headphones and the numbers here. Let me just try, actually.
00:31:21.164 - 00:31:59.272, Speaker A: And now that may be another window. That is pretty wild. So this. So it's just like a drum machine. So that is pretty hilarious. And. Okay, now, if you don't know cyber hen, we might need to wait for that to finish there.
00:31:59.272 - 00:32:14.552, Speaker A: If you don't know cyber hen, they put out all these super cool trading cards. And there were some. I wanted to show you these ones down here. These were the ones. I saw these really early on. See, it's November 16, 2021. If you don't know about these, they're pretty cool.
00:32:14.552 - 00:32:36.988, Speaker A: Like, this is Cosimo de Medici with the GM. And here is another one with Cosimo. And then here's Rata Yankee. So these were works that I found also very early on when I came to object and I kind of had to have them. I just thought they were so cool. So this is the cyber hens collection. So they're still being released.
00:32:36.988 - 00:32:52.114, Speaker A: And we just got that super cool interactive sound. One couple of golf works by bite by bit, which continue to be super interesting here. Beautiful. One of ones. I think this went for five tazos. And you just got to love the simplicity. Retro tools.
00:32:52.114 - 00:33:12.186, Speaker A: Kind of doing a retro games, retro video game style as well. I love the sports theme, as ever. Five tezos. One of one. You can't complain about that. This is available for one tezos and a different. So again, the golf course as visual, you know, image as subject of a visual art piece.
00:33:12.186 - 00:33:28.014, Speaker A: I love it as a composition. As an art composition. Brilliant and beautiful. It's just like the tennis court. It makes a beautiful subject matter. Here's a beautiful work by Spuegelsmaskinen. Another combination.
00:33:28.014 - 00:33:59.692, Speaker A: Remember we were talking about. Remember how we were talking about the plant and the computer that were being combined. So it looks like he's also doing that. It's like beyond juxtaposition, they're kind of being fused. And here it looks like he's doing the same thing, but he's turned the head here into this kind of grid. And that probably works better than having like a human head here. So interesting experimentation here from Spuegels maskinen.
00:33:59.692 - 00:34:31.320, Speaker A: And this is going for two ETH reserve of one, so not cheap. Nice work from Spuegels. Look at this. This is about a month old from perfect loop. I think I discovered perfect loop from explainer gallery. And what I found so fascinating about this is, you see, it looks like water, right? But it's almost like you see little bits of text in. It's almost like that pesky text is in the water, in the waves, but it barely shows.
00:34:31.320 - 00:34:49.788, Speaker A: So just kind of beautifully done. It just kind of shimmers in there a little bit, but not entirely the whole thing. Ocean view, one of one, and just transferred to xerox. So interesting. RJ with a abstract here. Blue on white static. So interesting.
00:34:49.788 - 00:35:08.944, Speaker A: I don't know if I've ever seen RJ do an abstract here. So more experimentation here on the blockchain. And just interesting, interesting, interesting. And this is. Did this get burned? All five were burned. Well, let's hope we see more of it. Blue on white static.
00:35:08.944 - 00:35:32.998, Speaker A: Mcrenders. Don't pull the cartridge. So more glitch rom, but processed, which gives it that extra rich sort of look. This looks like Robocop again. So I guess robocop. Maybe the reason Robocop is so popular is because it's kind of like the human machine fused. And maybe that's.
00:35:32.998 - 00:35:50.274, Speaker A: Or maybe it's just the movies. So here it is. Don't pull the cartridge collected from physical hardware glitches on an NES clone console. Export it in after effects Gif in Photoshop. Nice and cheap edition of 25. So pretty reasonable there. And Renki with another cool work, kumasaki.
00:35:50.274 - 00:36:13.288, Speaker A: And here you see this kind of red square kinda dissolving into vapor here, somewhat. So interesting color, interesting abstract from Renki. Edition of ten. There's one available for ten tezos. And I actually had to pick this up. I thought it was hilarious. I mean, it's probably Independence Day, which I haven't seen for 20 years or more.
00:36:13.288 - 00:36:28.930, Speaker A: Mega fireworks extravaganza. I just thought it was hilarious. So there it is. Just kind of a simple glitch. Video work here, a ton of analog video gear done. You can just keep watching that over and over. So that's why I will stop it.
00:36:28.930 - 00:36:58.342, Speaker A: Edition of 22, available for five tezos. And here's e boy, Tokyo Pixarama. So this now I believe DJ Kiro, actually, he sent me a link a couple of times from these guys. This is probably why I have it in my list here. He was saying these were big innovators, pioneers of pixel art, these e boy guys. And I believe they're out of Germany, too. So this is interesting.
00:36:58.342 - 00:37:14.934, Speaker A: Last sold for twelve ETH. Okay, so, e boy, when is this from? May 2, 2021. Okay, so this was sold to me. Now, this was at the height of the bull market. So this was sent to me by Curo. I didn't realize this was old. So here it is.
00:37:14.934 - 00:37:41.534, Speaker A: These guys were pioneers of pixel art. According to Kiro, they've been doing it since, I think, the early two thousands. So interesting work here. Kind of that 45 degree angle and everything looks great. Twelve ETH, that's wild. Pamelo Cerrone with a one of one at auction for five. Al vaca, again out of Argentina.
00:37:41.534 - 00:37:58.386, Speaker A: So more cool. One of ones from Pamelo. And it's just looking cool and great. Love to see so much work coming out. I'm not sure what that translates to, but looking cool and fun. Another illustration, this time from Zepar. Sorry, from Daniel W.
00:37:58.386 - 00:38:29.038, Speaker A: Called Zepar the ars goesia. And here we see it's always. We continue to see this kind of mysterious series where it looks, like, familiar. You know, you think of the two headed dog, maybe Janus or whatever, but here it's a knight. And it feels like different mythological tropes are being combined here. But I'm not sure because, I don't know, it seems to be something here. So I'm not sure what Daniel W.
00:38:29.038 - 00:39:05.714, Speaker A: Is up to, but it looks pretty cool. And here's a very poetic work by appreciating existence. And just a beautiful, beautiful, classic work that we could all relate to of some person on their laptop, looking outside at the grass. And just a nice, simple, beautifully done work with a fancy chair. You know, I call this contemporary illustration, this genre. You know, for some reason, there is a whole genre that just does contemporary world as illustration. You know, I think of Adele, Adelia.
00:39:05.714 - 00:39:28.622, Speaker A: There's several artists actually, in that whole kind of genre that exist. And definitely smaunter's work here definitely fits in with that cool laptop and everything. Buy now for ten tezos. So edition of 22 of 20. So sold for next to nothing. Just $0.50. So interesting.
00:39:28.622 - 00:39:55.888, Speaker A: I picked that up for five tez on secondary. And you saw it was in that gallery at the start. Well, gloom tube with a cool stamp, trampled stamp. So, yeah, more dystopia from gloom tube. More misanthropy, you know, a little bit from gloom tube. I say, in the most generous sense, trampled stamp. So more satire of contemporary society in a dark way.
00:39:55.888 - 00:40:21.600, Speaker A: So beautiful work by gloom tube 444. Nice screen here. And again, just questioning humanity's motives and everything. So just beautiful work here. Mary Migraine, shiny violet with another kind of wild work here. We remember the other one with a person whose head was melting with the migraine. And here is another one, shiny violet.
00:40:21.600 - 00:40:40.808, Speaker A: This is an edition of 15, is it sold out and just offers coming in. A lot of people want it, so just cool work. Band aid coma. Seems to still have a bit of the migraine feel to it. And these cool hearts here and everything. So cool work from Mary migraine. Big shout out.
00:40:40.808 - 00:41:05.604, Speaker A: And continuing to the AI zoom sleep late. So continuing this kind of pale figure here. The following the life of this pale figure. And just cool sitting in bed here, looking at home. Interesting sort of background here. So AI maybe going to bed and there's another one before sleep. So same subject here.
00:41:05.604 - 00:41:37.680, Speaker A: So plants and everything with this strange figure here. And interesting colors and combinations. Almost like a claustrophobic space here. A little bit interesting picture in the background there. Available for five tezos edition of ten. Continuing on, Lily illo with a cool abstract, I think silverfish feast, I think this is called. So pretty interesting AI abstract here.
00:41:37.680 - 00:42:04.270, Speaker A: And again, kind of back to look at how beautifully painted this is. Look at how beautifully painted this is. These great textures. Lily illo in collaboration with AI. Exactly. Because, I mean, raw AI is one thing, but a lot of the time, I think a lot of artists are editing it and why not? So on to physical work here. Now axeme with just some cool skulls.
00:42:04.270 - 00:42:32.194, Speaker A: Almost using a point, like just making dots to create the image here. And you see a skull and kind of a Euxine style skull. In greek mythology, tantalus was a punished figure trapped in the afterlife. He stood in a pool of water beneath a fruit tree. But whenever he tried to drink or eat, the water and fruits would recede forever, just out of his reach. And another work here. This is also a physical work by Diego Barrow.
00:42:32.194 - 00:43:07.200, Speaker A: Fake lighthouse digital photo of a physical artwork. Original is rollerball bic pen on cotton canvas. So this is an NFT of a physical work. Nice composition here. And very nicely done by Diego Barrow with a ballpoint pen available for 15 tezos edition of one walk with an older work from 2017, just Nike Air Force one. So again the shoe theme which a lot of us love here and just beautifully painted, isn't it? So nice piece there. And finally Yoao Salazar on threads.
00:43:07.200 - 00:43:39.640, Speaker A: And here is just a beautiful work here that Yoao is working on. So again breaking out the paint and just, you know, it's, it's funny how well Yoao's style translates from plasticine to paint. Beautifully painted. And here's my friend Ben out of Germany. I thought this was hilarious. He often does a lot of memes. So here's Bigfoot and this is from a famous picture, picture of Bigfoot and so here you can barely see it and maybe that's the point.
00:43:39.640 - 00:43:48.104, Speaker A: So I just thought that was hilarious that he was doing the Bigfoot photo. And that's your show, everybody. Thank you for joining me. Until next time, take care.
