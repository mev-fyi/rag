00:00:05.160 - 00:00:21.249, Speaker A: A happy new year. Can you believe it? September already. I was raised on American television. So this is my new year. This is the media new year. This is the new year for creatives, as they call them in the corporate world. We are creatives over here.
00:00:21.249 - 00:00:52.067, Speaker A: Welcome back. Artist Journal, September 2, 2024, broadcasting from Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pocabell and we are back. You know, K Town with all the crazy kind of magical signs and sigils was saying this should be daily again. And, you know, it's where it started. And I'm going to Greece because I'm in denial of. Of summer being over.
00:00:52.067 - 00:01:30.705, Speaker A: And it's not over. It's still another three weeks technically, but I'm still in denial. And I want to prolong my den by going to where the weather is just like in July and August in northern Europe and other climbs. But I'm going to continue doing the show and I am kind of like, I love our new schedule. What I'd call new, it's been going for probably about a year now, where it gives the video time to breathe, where you put it out, and then it has two days to kind of breathe for people to consume it. If you do it shorter, though, you can theoretically do it more often. So anyways, I toy with these things in my mind.
00:01:30.705 - 00:02:34.695, Speaker A: I may experiment in Greece because I'm not going to want to spend, you know, hour and a half preparation and then an hour and a half, let's say, recording with the beach right there, but I still want to put something out. So perhaps, as many of you know, I've been struggling for a year, year and a half on how to make these shows shorter. Perhaps this kind of forced deadline of the beach being, you know, not too far away and freedom being not too far away, maybe it will force my hand into trying to carve out something that is shorter for this show. I was talking to some friends this weekend, new friends, and they were basically saying, sounds great what you're doing, but there's no way I would watch an hour and a half of this, of this, you know, but 10 minutes, I'll totally check it out. So it's not gonna be 10 minutes, but all to say, very interesting, I'm gonna break up the show as well into a playlist, which I've thought about where, let's say you have pixel art as a video or. Yeah, there's a lot of things you can do. Or you have a different channel that just has clips of, say, 10 minute sections.
00:02:34.695 - 00:02:57.169, Speaker A: You know, you do the pixel art section, you do the glitch section. There's a lot of different things you can do, but I probably have to get a bit. So I say to myself, I have to get a bit smarter about how I'm kind of approaching this whole thing. In the meantime, though, the journal as it stands continues. And so here we are. Has dribble waffles, puts. Puts works out on Rodeo.
00:02:57.169 - 00:03:30.241, Speaker A: Just when Rodeo seemed to really be getting quiet on the timeline, here comes waffles. And it's funny, it's the first time I actually felt the need to sign into Rodeo. All of a sudden there were seven waffles there. And I was just like, ah, maybe, just maybe I need to pick this up. So at first I wasn't sure if this is a gift, but it's a png. I was wondering to myself, is this moving? Isn't it moving? It is a png. But you see all the majesty and fun, really of a hasdrubal waffles work and the mischief.
00:03:30.241 - 00:04:00.575, Speaker A: Even putting it on Rodeo to a certain degree, I thought was kind of mischievous a little bit. And this is called Hooters. Again, playing with the mischief there. But here it is the eyes, and they are being repeated here, almost like antennae. And this wonderful again, almost like the airbrush, interestingly. And you almost see what looks like the background, but probably not. But you do see kind of a checkered background here.
00:04:00.575 - 00:04:37.485, Speaker A: It does seem to be cut out a little bit. Just a portrait, Just a fun portrait with all of these colors. Could have been made in 20 minutes for all we know. And that's how easy Waffles makes it look. But all of the delight that we have here, and I have a few to look at here, so I won't take too long on this. But you see how here, the delight for me of waffles, among many other things, one of our favorites here, as many of you know, is here it'll be, you know, a little bit crisp, and then here it won't be. And it's.
00:04:37.485 - 00:05:35.025, Speaker A: We're kind of back to digital texture, aren't we? Which is kind of interesting because it's almost like digital texture equals painterliness, right? It's. It's like. And what do we mean by digital texture? Because it's not the same kind of texture that we find in physical. But when we start to get like kind of this distortion, I mean, how else would you describe this? When you start to get this kind of distortion here, this kind of blurred outedness, you start to feel texture, particularly in contrast with this kind of slightly sharper area. So different kinds of mark making, I suppose we could say, which is a little bit more medium agnostic to a certain degree. This is digital mark making versus physical, but never but mark making nonetheless. And here you almost seem to see what seems like a digital airbrush.
00:05:35.025 - 00:06:11.583, Speaker A: I mean, if you really look here. So all kind of interesting. I was thinking to myself, finally, you know, with waffles work, it actually made me think, because let you know, I don't know about you, but I'm sure many artists out there, sometimes you think about this kind of weird dilemma of what does it mean to use a physic, a digital brush that is imitating a physical brush. Right. What does it mean to use a program that is imitating paint. Right. Digitally that's imitating physical paint with your digital brush.
00:06:11.583 - 00:06:53.969, Speaker A: Right. So it creates almost this illusion of three dimensionality. And I go, does that make sense? Is this weird? Does this kind of conceptually. How does. How does that work out conceptually in my artwork? What does it mean to me to do that? You know, I've incorporated physical into my work, but I haven't like, personally, I haven't used a ton. I have used brush, I think I'm pretty sure I've used like brush kind of work, but not necessarily physical. But what I love about waffles work and what waffles work has dribble waffles work actually made me think about is to not care at all.
00:06:53.969 - 00:07:18.835, Speaker A: In a sense, this kind of whimsical kind of thing. Don't think too hard on this pokebelly. Just if it's there, it's there. If it's a digital thing imitating a physical, who cares? It can make some beautiful marks as we're going to see here. So just kind of opening thoughts here. So this is on Rodeo Hooters 81. It was basically free.
00:07:18.835 - 00:07:45.819, Speaker A: Like, I didn't think I had any eth left on base. And then I managed to pick up all seven of these. So they're very cheap, you know, so very interesting. It's available for another six hours. And I think that short time period also was what caused the FOMO for me. So pretty awesome. So here it is on Rodeo Hastuba Waffles account.
00:07:45.819 - 00:08:05.899, Speaker A: So just starting here. And here's another one. Again, no maximize here. So I bring it up in a separate. This is called Pogo 45, minted here. And here we see it fitting nicely to the screen here. And not exactly sure what the reference is here, but we seem to see different softwares here.
00:08:05.899 - 00:09:00.626, Speaker A: Look at the bricks, these beautifully colored bricks. Maybe it's using some of the, you know, here it looks like a brush that has been made here it's probably bricks from a program. And then contrasting with this kind of freestyle drawing, again, process here, like one another kind of insight. This is why I enjoy Waffles work so much and maybe why a lot of you do too. It's because it's not like this is the most realistic drawing of what maybe is a dinosaur. And I don't even know if it matters, because what matters here, what's interesting, and I would argue why it works, is actually the process and the thinking of contrast. The dynamics, the system of this work, the relationships, the spray paint underneath with the moving line on top.
00:09:00.626 - 00:10:05.643, Speaker A: So all of a sudden that takes precedence on why this works. You know, say the static in the background with even a little bit of flashing here. I don't know if you can see that. You see over there, all of a sudden that takes precedence over, oh, well, how beautifully drawn was this dinosaur all of a sudden it's the relationships, it's the contrasts, it's the system, the system of imagery, icons, process things working together, the dynamics of the image. We're almost back to Dunamis. So, you know, so and this is why we almost have all these kind of slightly different styles, but they all are somewhat unified, right? Like there's probably using a different software here than the other, but still recognizable in if, you know, Waffles work. You could still say, if you had to guess, probably a waffles, right? So also interesting, this is a beautiful one too.
00:10:05.643 - 00:10:48.367, Speaker A: And let's see if we can zoom in a bit. So just a cycling gradient again, I almost, you know, as an artist, almost annoying at how easily Waffles is putting this work together. Like all of a sudden, six works come out, seven works come out. I get the impression Waffles had like a couple hours to spare on the weekend and put out seven works. And all of a sudden, and then people like me are like, I must have these seven works on a, you know, that I haven't even connected to before and didn't want to because I was like, oh, this is too cheap. But, ah, okay, let's not be ideological about this. Here's what I was talking about now, kind of an edgy work.
00:10:48.367 - 00:11:27.155, Speaker A: Will pretend not to know what's going on here. Miss you. Brilliant. Also, though, I would say in composition though, just this kind of mirroring of this person who seems to be alive with the person Underground in the gravesite. This is quite a novel composition. This is what I was talking about though. This is what kind of inspired like me on this and all these wonderful textures and even the ground, the lack, you know, again, almost annoying at how easy he makes Waffles makes this look.
00:11:27.155 - 00:12:19.421, Speaker A: But this part here, this kind of top area is where I kind of had the sense that, you know, you can't care if it's like or, you know, you shouldn't worry about that because look at how beautiful these textures are. So are you not going to use this? You know, because maybe I might put a block up in my mind and say, don't go here. Because this is just kind of, you know, some kind of cheap looking brush that's trying to make some emulation of an oil paint where I'd say, like, what on earth am I doing here? But what I love is not only. And it would be different if that's what Waffles exclusively used. I think to myself, you know, as I kind of figure out, you know, what makes sense, why does this still make sense? But it's. It'd be different if this was only the brush he used and it was always physical. I think it could still work because sometimes he'll have works that are like that.
00:12:19.421 - 00:13:04.845, Speaker A: But really, if you look at the frame completely flat and digital, you look here kind of looks like a different kind of beast over here that maybe even this was copy and pasted and then this brush was put over top into a different program. Maybe this was put in. Right. So I think there's also like screenshots, copy and pasting into new. Again, for those that might not know. And I highly recommend the X space we did like a year and a half ago with Waffles that where he'll have like nine different browser tabs open and he'll just kind of doodle throughout the week and then works kind of come together. So he's probably copying and pasting that goes into a different browser which will have a different software on it.
00:13:04.845 - 00:13:57.905, Speaker A: Also brilliant, right? Also part of the art. This, you know, again, what I call Internet artists. You know, a true Internet artist here, you know, using browser tabs like you want a cheap, you know, entry point, you know, as far as making your art, you don't even need Photoshop in. I got a David, another work here and do I have this large. So here we go. So again, kind of looking like different brushworks again, not worrying at all about the physical versus the digital and me, you know, trying to, you know, wrestling with myself of what does this mean? Just going for it and not worrying about it. And here again, kind of looks like it was just kind of cobbled together, but there's something just kind of delightful about it.
00:13:57.905 - 00:14:49.705, Speaker A: And again, this isn't the Mona Lisa in terms of execution of realism here, but we look at this and you go, oh, what an original way of, say, doing the pupils or the eyes right? And then you have this red underneath and you start seeing the painterliness and all of a sudden you go, well, this guy's a great painter, isn't he? Great digital painter, we can say. And even just the mark making here, some of my favorite works I've done, it's with the mark making. It's with the, you know, the action of the arm. And it's probably being done, I'm guessing with a mouse, interestingly, probably right. And that creates its own kind of interesting thing. There's a lot to say about Waffles work and I believe this is the last one. Roms, interesting title here.
00:14:49.705 - 00:15:33.429, Speaker A: And not even sure, you know, you have a couple of people with their nose bleeding, this person in the middle, who knows what's going on here. And in a weird way, it might not even matter. And I was thinking to myself about this today, it's even drawing the text. I was like, you know what? I'm going to draw the text in some works that I was working on. And so rather than like trying to trace the text, draw the text. And here, just this kind of freedom here. So all to say, super interesting is that everything, look at this all at once, not even worrying about it, being able to put out so much work, I'll just.
00:15:33.429 - 00:16:02.943, Speaker A: And here it is just filling the space. Reminds you of Basquiat, doesn't it? Just can go, go. And then it comes out and it is what it is. And it's basically, you know, for lack of better term, some sort of collective unconscious image from a generation of sorts, you know, from an Internet generation. Artist as Basquiat was for a 1980s, you know, artist. So just awesome, Just awesome. And here also.
00:16:02.943 - 00:16:34.831, Speaker A: So also Waffles. And I have quite a few more images from RGB Montreal. So also Waffles was shown at that RGB MTL show. And there you see it's Droobble Waffle. Just hilarious. And look at how good this looks. You know, as Popple is going to say in a future tab here for Artists by Artists, how I used to start this show a few times two years ago for Artists by Artists.
00:16:34.831 - 00:16:57.921, Speaker A: I felt like it Wasn't the most inclusive, you know, way to open the show. So I kind of faded off, faded it a little bit in my. But nevertheless, you do see here. Look at how brilliant this display is. Like I think Warhol would go, oh, nice one. Very nice, very nice. Right? So nice display here.
00:16:57.921 - 00:17:40.105, Speaker A: And here you also see some more waffle gifts. Thank you so much for the documentation and curation, Kozlowski. And I believe we have a work by Kozlowski also from RGB Montreal. So you see how good this looks and you even see in the photography like these old TVs how they render things differently. And you can't tell if it's the photo, like with the screens being curved or if it's, you know, actually the TVs that are creating this difference in the rendition. So just very interesting when you get artists doing the work here, doing the displaying and there are three artists, it's more than eightso. And we'll get into.
00:17:40.105 - 00:18:05.059, Speaker A: I think it's Strano and Nicholas Sassoon all putting on this show. And we'll get to that in a second. This Wednesday, I'm pleased to have Ex Mortal on on Glitch and video art and just a classic in the scene here. So very excited to talk with Ex Mortal. In a sense we don't have enough of the video glitch artists on the spaces. So starting to fix that now. So X Mortal on Wednesday, come check it out.
00:18:05.059 - 00:18:21.675, Speaker A: Should be awesome. On to the comments we go here. So starting with that myth work and here we are. A lot of great comments actually this episode. Radiankey. Awesome show my friend. And again, I totally appreciate that.
00:18:21.675 - 00:18:47.187, Speaker A: And again, like, once again it just shows how like I got a pretty good response on this show and I was like, eh. I didn't feel so great about it interestingly. But as I was saying at the start of that show, you just have to hit publish because you're gonna be the worst judge. Same with art. There's kind of an interesting lesson there. Sometimes works that you think are like, meh, people love and they'll be like, that's my favorite work that you've done. So anyway, Rata Yonkey, awesome to hear from you.
00:18:47.187 - 00:19:06.441, Speaker A: Great to hear. Echo Textile Studio. Hi Adrian, thanks for this great show. Thank you for telling me that. Thank you for the comment and thanks for posting the video on on Sao Paulo. Excellent. So of course the work we saw of the AI over Sao Paulo, I was impressed as well.
00:19:06.441 - 00:19:21.013, Speaker A: Sao Paulo is a mad city, all right. But awesome for art. I Want to go back? I may go back quite soon, actually. I'm feeling sorry for digital artists there who used X to advertise. So until their art. Exactly. To or show and tell.
00:19:21.013 - 00:19:48.897, Speaker A: So. And tell their art exactly. Because of course, users in Brazil have been banned from X, from using X because of this dispute between the Supreme Court judge and Elon Musk on censoring accounts on X. So it's going to be interesting to see how that plays out, because of course, in Argentina, X is huge. And also in Brazil, it is huge. It's very important. So one wonders at what point.
00:19:48.897 - 00:20:16.267, Speaker A: I mean, this is what I ask myself. At what point will the politicians in Brazil start to be annoyed with this? Right. And I think that's probably what Elon Musk is betting, because what do the politicians do? Like, they're kind of. Kind of have their huge audiences. It's probably one of the things, the most powerful things they have is their account on X. At what point are some politicians going to be like, what are we doing here? So I have a feeling that's the strategy. Let's see how it plays out.
00:20:16.267 - 00:20:54.625, Speaker A: Where shall we find them? Now, this is a great question. And you know, I talk about Object being a futuristic social media network because it has notifications, very minor kind of social, like there's following and there's notifications. Once again, Object is kind of here to take the spoils of everybody else screwing up to a certain degree. And also an Object. Once again, it's like, well, at least I have my notifications on Object. I just kind of cleaned up my super rare, so now I can go to the feed. And you know, I did that this weekend, so I'm.
00:20:54.625 - 00:21:33.637, Speaker A: Because now it's more important because all of a sudden it's like, exactly to your point, there's Instagram and there's not everybody set up on Instagram. I don't necessarily follow all the Brazilian artists that I follow on X on Instagram, for example. So where should we find them? In fact, I only learned about closing of X in Brazil through a Brazilian artist post on Instagram. I guess this closure of X in Brazil sets an incredible precedent. Yeah, I say let's see how long it lasts. There's either going to be a deal, there's probably going to be some sort of compromise or negotiation. I don't see it being permanent because I think the political class at a certain point is going to be really annoyed.
00:21:33.637 - 00:21:43.317, Speaker A: But who knows? I mean, that's just my what I suspect. Den Holmes. Awesome to hear from you. Great stuff. Awesome Heidi thing. Nailed it. Poco as ever.
00:21:43.317 - 00:22:24.751, Speaker A: First thing I tend to do with an NFT article is I see, I see is Apple F tazos. So find control. F tazos. Look for it. They're always found wanting. And it speaks volumes, doesn't it, that here we are in 2024, going on 2025, and the mainstream art media still, you know, basically has, you know, for all intents and purposes, if they can't even distinguish between PFPs and say, the Ethereum art market, think of how, like, far away what we're doing is here. Kind of interesting, isn't it? Kind of.
00:22:24.751 - 00:22:49.711, Speaker A: Very interesting in a certain sort of way. And I'm glad because in a sense, if Art News was covering the same things that we're covering over here in this journal, then it's like I'd probably have to find something else to talk about, right? Tim Rinaldi. Awesome show, Adrian, and thanks for mentioning that piece. Made a proper YouTube account to comment. Awesome. I love. You know, thank you everybody so far for the amazing comments.
00:22:49.711 - 00:23:01.171, Speaker A: It's. It's quite a. A positive crowd here. Cryptocurrency. Crypto King. Two episodes in three days. Yeah, buddy.
00:23:01.171 - 00:23:29.973, Speaker A: There's enough art to have a daily show. And in fact there is. It actually makes it easier to do the show in theory because all of a sudden there's less to compile and it's a shorter show, it's a quicker upload because my upload speeds are terrible out here in Berlin. So there's a lot of, you know, reason to do this. But it is a different kind of commitment when you do it every day. But there is just. There is a rationale and I am considering it.
00:23:29.973 - 00:23:42.345, Speaker A: Also, great timing for West Coast Canada. Release around 6am it also would go out faster. Goes great with the morning coffee doobie ritual. Stay relentless. Anthony Pompliano. Hilarious. Yeah, that was the.
00:23:42.345 - 00:23:59.879, Speaker A: This was the original. I'm sure most of you know this, but I believe Jeff Bezos, this was the original name of Amazon, was relentless. Stay relentless here. Anthony Pompliano. Interesting. Thank you for the comment, K Town and the ongoing support. Geo9800 Gucci.
00:23:59.879 - 00:24:12.355, Speaker A: Cap. Adrian, you gotta know your Gucci by now. Hilarious. So that is not Louis Vuitton in the myths cap here. This is Gucci. Of course it's Gucci. I say to myself, of course.
00:24:12.355 - 00:24:37.605, Speaker A: Handful. Oh, flight. What's the intro sound from? That is Tradscape. That is a NFT I bought from Tradscape. So he is the artist here. Usually it should be in the music by Tradscape here. You know what I might do though? I'm going to put a link to Tradscape here in this kind of default text to his Object.
00:24:37.605 - 00:25:06.027, Speaker A: But if you put a search on Tradscape in Object you will find this track. It's called Midnight Sunburn I think is the name of the track as well as the Outro song is also by Tradscape. So he is the brilliant artist. And isn't it wonderful that we can get music from this scene to open the show. And pretty original music too. Here is so thank you for the question and the comment. Hen Collector awesome to hear from Hen Collector.
00:25:06.027 - 00:25:44.763, Speaker A: As ever, a very thoughtful one of the big collectors. Wrote this great essay, I want to say like a year and a half, two years ago on what's going on in Object and we've gotten a couple of comments from Hen Collector. It's always awesome to hear from them. Hydron back again in reference to all the talk about Zora, rodeo, et cetera. Maybe I'm just a simpleton, but I really don't have the time to manage all the constantly changing dynamics, platforms, politics and whatever else, you know. And this is an excellent point. Like serious in a sense, that's kind of like this is exactly it what I was going to say.
00:25:44.763 - 00:26:28.527, Speaker A: And you know, in a sense, no offense to anybody, but you know, with all these wait lists and whatever in the crypto world, all that tells me is this is for people who have too much time on their hands. Oh, I'm going to go follow this wait list that I had to find in this discord and I'm going to take all day on X so I can get the airdrop. You know, I don't, you know, I say this with no judgment, okay, But I would say and don't take it the wrong but it's like serious people do not have time to. They have too many things they need to do. People like Hen Collector at least shall, shall we say, I just want to keep it simple and collect. I think many other serious collectors. As hen puts it, Hen Collector might feel the same.
00:26:28.527 - 00:26:50.331, Speaker A: I totally relate and agree as far as the whole crypto airdrop thing, like I've totally, I've stopped caring. I'm like, keep your $10,000, keep your three. I I don't care anymore. It's not worth my. It's not worth my time. I think I made that move at the exchange art because and I had decided I was like, I'm not going to try and manipulate this. I've been a community member of Exchange Art.
00:26:50.331 - 00:27:16.405, Speaker A: Let's see what they do. And I think I got $4 if that, you know, and I had collected for over a year. I had posted works, I had sold works, right. So I had done everything that a community person does and then they're, you know, and then. But we're going to give the, you know, the person with too much time on their hands who's farming all day and doing all this manipulation. We're going to give them all the money. Give me a break.
00:27:16.405 - 00:27:35.725, Speaker A: You know, so time is worth more than money. I've decided. And that is how I live my life. That is why I'm speaking to you right now. Because of that philosophy. Let's continue to me, platforms on Tezos have always kept it super simple and unpolluted from different schemes and wait lists and manipulations. Amen.
00:27:35.725 - 00:27:53.575, Speaker A: And these are like a very. These are very carefully chosen words. Different schemes, wait lists and manipulation. Like very accurate assessment. I definitely have never been a Tezos maxi. Nor have I. I just want to be able to collect with all the.
00:27:53.575 - 00:28:38.031, Speaker A: Without all the BS and Tezos platforms do that. It's that simple. It's why even after the greening of Ethereum, I never moved over. I just want to stay focused on the creator and the art without any of the politics and games. What attracted. So, you know, and this is, this is interesting, right, because hen collector is what I would call more your typical art collector that you would find outside of crypto who isn't interested in like, you know, what I think they would think are as dumb, weightless, for example, or allow lists and all this sort of jazz. What attracted so many of us to hen it was truly simple and pure experience, right? There's art, you buy it and it's pretty good value.
00:28:38.031 - 00:28:54.295, Speaker A: It's different. It's that simple. It's why I continue to stick with the offspring of hen on Tazos. Another very carefully chosen sentence words here. The offspring of hen on Tezos. And fair enough, right? Object. It like object came after hen.
00:28:54.295 - 00:29:51.767, Speaker A: Hen really was a breakthrough and there's something quite special like it is becoming mythic, isn't it? Hen. And I think it's like, you know, Alan Moore, the great comics writer, he made an argument and I can't remember in what context it was, but I think he had proposed to do a project for D.C. and he said for from what I remember of the argument and the essay, which I read like maybe 20 years ago, that what we need to do. In order to turn Superman, Batman and everything into true myths, we have to kill them. We have to show their death. And dc, of course, rejected this idea, but that's kind of what happened with hen because it's dead now. It can become a myth.
00:29:51.767 - 00:30:24.889, Speaker A: But if it was still going, yeah, okay, it's maybe a myth thing, but it's not dead yet. And that's what that makes me. You know, when I say hen has almost become myth, it's because it died that it can now become a myth. Interestingly, a minute free of navigating the complicating, complicating menagerie and mess is a minute more I can focus solely on evaluating pieces and artists, which to me is the whole point. And, you know, it's tricky enough, frankly, just. Just following all the artists. You follow on object.
00:30:24.889 - 00:30:55.115, Speaker A: Right. Like, it's kind of enough to just go through all those notifications and again, I wish they would kind of upgrade the notifications so that you could filter it by just new NFTs, because if someone relists their prices, it kills and I and all miss works because then the scroll thing, I'm still having issues and I need to resend a message to the dev that reached out to me. Thank you for reaching out. Said it was fine and then it stopped working the next day. For me anyway. Yeah. So I'm all with you.
00:30:55.115 - 00:31:27.951, Speaker A: If we want to attract serious collectors, as hen collector puts it, you got to, you know, offer a serious experience and you got to not waste people's time. That should be kind of front and center. And then if that's the mentality which Tezos has done, they don't get in the way. Half the battle, I would argue, in life is kind of not screwing up royally. Right. Let's say hen collector as well. The nature of digital art itself clearly makes it very difficult to create a feeling of texture.
00:31:27.951 - 00:32:01.457, Speaker A: So how the discussion we were starting with in this show, zoom into a high res uri J and they are managing to master this with phenomenal composition and inspired textures. Every piece a lush and tranquil invented world my eyes can swim in. Exactly. And so we went through this whole work here and exactly. There's a richness here. You can look at any part of this work and there's some. It overwhelms you and there's just a ton of delight.
00:32:01.457 - 00:32:23.635, Speaker A: There's. It just overwhelms you and it's aesthetically interesting and beautiful. So it's just, you know, we're back to digital texture, interestingly and let's just quickly look at the comments here. Thank you Hen Collector for the comments and very interesting comment on Yuri J there as well. Yolantis. Thank God it's Friday. Good morning indeed.
00:32:23.635 - 00:32:39.055, Speaker A: And it is the Happy New Year. The Happy Media New Year. Chain Controller, great show. Thank you for keeping me excited. Just loving the vibes here. Thank you Chain Controller Rorich Coffee, cigarette and Artist journal. What a great start to this beautiful Friday morning.
00:32:39.055 - 00:32:57.979, Speaker A: So you gotta love the vibes here everyone. I am. And again when I posted this I was. I wasn't sure about it as ever. Kel's another banger. Adrian, loving the possibility of new treasures grabbed off the bookshelf, but really missing your little birdhouse. Yeah and so that was a.
00:32:57.979 - 00:33:22.751, Speaker A: Just a great card from my mom. Actually may have been a Christmas card or a birthday card. I've learned from other from my brother and other family members. Don't leave the cards up forever. Anyways, shout out to mom on that one. Awesome cards on that 1 yen Lucas Magone what a good way to start. Yeah, so awesome to hear from you Yan.
00:33:22.751 - 00:33:48.377, Speaker A: And actually we have a work in progress From Yan already 33 minutes and low trips. Art news segment was on point. Yeah, that was shocking, wasn't it? Like it's almost like you know, NFT evening. I was thinking to myself you could have called that NFT Sunset. Like it's all over for nft. The NFT scene. And again an anonymous website, you know, NFT Evening, whatever that is, anonymous.
00:33:48.377 - 00:34:23.451, Speaker A: And then their art news, their art news writes a whole article on this anonymous article. Basically it's like I put something up and write up and did they have their sourcing? I'm curious. Probably some sort of on chain data, I don't know. But anyways I'm glad that resonated with you. Lotrips Chromevoid Clip Art so I was wondering what is the definition of clipart? Clip art is similar to stock photos, just visual material created to use freely in other contexts. That sounds totally right. That link is.
00:34:23.451 - 00:34:51.359, Speaker A: That link is kind of like finding an old record full of samples and drum hits that are explicitly royalty free to make new music with. So of course from last episode you saw we had some clip art. So it's similar to stock photos, just visual material created to use freely in other contexts. So kind of royalty free visual material. Interesting. Thank you for the explanation. Chromevoid Sip and Pixel the myth based yes indeed.
00:34:51.359 - 00:35:10.855, Speaker A: And there is the myth. The mythic myth is a comment. It's awesome to hear from the myth on this on the show. And I think I can mention it. The myth is going to be on September 18th. We're going to have a space with the myth. Santiago is going to do the translating if everything goes according to plan.
00:35:10.855 - 00:35:24.513, Speaker A: But it is confirmed, so I'm announcing it here. So that is super exciting. And continuing on, Olivera Durdevic. Great show, Adrian. I'm slowly but surely falling in love with pixel art. Thank you for the feature. You're welcome.
00:35:24.513 - 00:35:40.365, Speaker A: And congratulations. I think it's going to happen to us all. Fernando Fragoso, great to hear from you. And Nav, awesome to hear from you as ever. And of course, we have a couple more by nuv this episode. Also. I'm glad I brought this up.
00:35:40.365 - 00:36:04.241, Speaker A: So here we go. More studying works from RGB Montreal. Okay, so. And Danielle King, importantly must be noted that the gorgeousness that was RGB Montreal was 100% due to the incredible hard work of these artists. Strano, Nicholas Sassoon and Labs. So thank you for noting that, Danielle. And big shout out to Danielle.
00:36:04.241 - 00:36:31.359, Speaker A: Just checking out the community here, which is growing nicely at 508 as we continue to grow here. Skull takes Data Navigator. Data Navigator by Miken T. So pretty cool. Kind of pesky ASCII animation, but not just using it. Cool kind of separation with the background being a different kind of technique. Interesting contrast there.
00:36:31.359 - 00:36:41.435, Speaker A: Skull takes very cool. Prim. My Indian take on the Joker. Hope you like it. Please share your thoughts. Tantric Joker. It looks like a jester figure.
00:36:41.435 - 00:37:08.337, Speaker A: Interestingly beautifully drawn. The line work is gorgeous. That is my take on it. Interesting way of presenting it. You know what it kind of reminds me of is those fashion design sketches that you see, but more rendered, shall we say? Prim Pridham Nilapudi. Thank you for posting. Luke 500 centralized social platform with almost 300 Brazilian artists in it.
00:37:08.337 - 00:37:33.773, Speaker A: So this is on Warpcast and many more. I highly recommend to follow Marcelo Natta on warpcast. So there are a ton of people. And also this is on the Hug Brazilian artist collective. So as as the lights go out in Brazil on Twitter, we're finding different alternatives here. Whether it's Warpcast or Hug XYZ or you name it. Skull takes Amazing.
00:37:33.773 - 00:37:54.981, Speaker A: You know, I think Hug XYZ isn't that Mark Zuckerberg? Zuckerberg sister, if I'm not mistaken. Who put that together? I mean, that should be our social. Like someone's gonna do it. So let's see what happens here. Skull takes Amazing. Definitely collected this one and now I have to go find A copy of that PS1 game. This is Agnes Evergrace.
00:37:54.981 - 00:38:13.405, Speaker A: So interesting. Kind of. It looks like CGI and I'm gonna go through it kind of quickly. So. And of course those dismans which were very painful to to use because if you walked with them they would always skip and everything. Portable but not super portable. Anyway, cool work there.
00:38:13.405 - 00:38:27.319, Speaker A: Thank you for posting. Wavypeso So a work in progress here and I'm gonna. So cool. I guess there's F1 this weekend or something. I saw a bunch of posts on it. I didn't realize F1 was so popular. Cool work there.
00:38:27.319 - 00:38:43.751, Speaker A: Louis with another work here and again using 3D. Very cool. Talking about the youth. Japan's youth loneliness crisis. So sad to. Sad to hear that there's a lot of loneliness out there. Not quite sure what the solution is other than going out.
00:38:43.751 - 00:38:58.945, Speaker A: If you do feel lonely, it's good to go out. Art shows are a good way to do it. Zizo hi dear King Tree Bear. This is my digital art for this amazing contest. So this is something else. So just posting some work. Interesting Trees kind of look futuristic here.
00:38:58.945 - 00:39:15.917, Speaker A: Very cool work. 69 ghosts. And I think we're going to look at this later this episode. So we will look at this again. And E Boy is talking me back. Berlin poster they did a while ago is maybe taking me back. So again, a cool physical of pixel art.
00:39:15.917 - 00:39:43.837, Speaker A: You get the sense with what we're seeing with E Boy and then I think it was Louis Vuitton. And then here you get the sense that pixel art is going to break through is breaking through the mainstream. Like the Louis Vuitton one that Kiro sent me. That link that Kiro sent that was a real. And it's going to happen. I think what happened to me personally, I think to me it's hard to accept. It's hard to accept.
00:39:43.837 - 00:39:58.319, Speaker A: It's like this is too childlike. This is like a video game. It's like. But I love it and that's why it's going to work. Filippo Francocci, great to hear from you. And a very interestingly textured work here. Filippo Francocci of course working with a lot of physical.
00:39:58.319 - 00:40:22.645, Speaker A: I think sometimes combining it with digital and also thank you for posting. Luke500artnews not differentiating between digital art and collectibles. Plus not filtering their sources. Exactly. Plus kept ignoring my PRs about OG pioneer artists inscribing historical computer art on bitcoin for forever data preservation. Yes. So in a sense it's a good.
00:40:22.645 - 00:40:45.615, Speaker A: Yeah. And here it is a report published earlier this month said the market for NFTs has been in such a dramatic downturn since 2023 that 95% of them are considered dead. So and again, referencing that anonymous website and combining PFPS and art. No mention of Tezos. That's art news. It just is what it is. But I think this is illustrative of how actually the media works.
00:40:45.615 - 00:40:57.895, Speaker A: So be skeptical. Out there is, I think the takeaway doctor Version. Awesome to hear from you. Cool new work here.Structures001 Interesting. Looks like a new series. Morgan Higbee Flowers thank you for posting.
00:40:57.895 - 00:41:22.935, Speaker A: And I think we saw these ones and there's the clip art that we were just discussing. So some early 2000s clip art here. Very interesting. Thank you everybody. Boske Grazias at Berlin. The original slide of this time harvesting is now in the hands of Pokebelly. And yes, this is another work that I never that I never showed last episode.
00:41:22.935 - 00:41:41.215, Speaker A: A slide. This slide. If you can see that. The slide of this work. Like how wild is that? I mean, so what a gift. What a gift. What is that worth? Priceless.
00:41:41.215 - 00:42:22.625, Speaker A: And look at how beautiful this is. So how cool is that? Again, big shout out to Busque Grazias visiting in Berlin. Awesomely so. Continuing on, I thought this was interesting. I kind of didn't agree with a lot of what was being said in this post and maybe we can look at a little bit of it, but I thought it was interesting and I think I can explain. At least I have my take. Why does x copy art NFTs hold better value than an established artist like Hearst? Official an understanding of the medium A recent post by Guardi Guark pointed out how poorly the NFTs from Hearst have performed, even though the physical versions still do all right at auction.
00:42:22.625 - 00:43:02.503, Speaker A: And I think the so oops. So this work here, this is the Damien Hirst work. And I thought it was quite obvious when I saw all of a sudden, if I put it this way, if I had owned the NFT of the work, I definitely would have wanted the physical and I don't want to carry around physicals. I rent apartments. I don't have my own place where I can kind of put up massive physicals, frame everything. Not yet. And so I think it's quite straightforward why the Damien Hirst originals are doing better than what I'd call the photo of the physical of the nft.
00:43:02.503 - 00:43:21.075, Speaker A: Because it's a native. Because the basically it's a photo of a work of art that's been nft that's been turned into an nft. It has been tokenized. Right. Whereas here, this is just a native digital artwork. Right. So I think it's that simple.
00:43:21.075 - 00:43:44.401, Speaker A: So. And yeah, like, you know, Rothko, like, I. It's funny that this came up because we were discussing this a couple of months ago, you know, Rothko paintings here. Adam Cochran says Rothko paintings aren't impressive. When we render them on the screen, they lack the scale and presence of the real thing. I was commenting. And interesting comments from Adam Cochran, by the way.
00:43:44.401 - 00:44:18.629, Speaker A: Thank you for bringing this interesting topic up on the timeline, but I actually feel exactly the opposite. It's actually Rothko only works, I would argue, or works much better as a photo or on the screen when you take pictures of it and otherwise in person. I'm kind of chronically let down by Rothko. So. Yeah. So I don't agree with the logic of all of this, although interestingly argued and really interesting post. But I think it's as simple as this is a photo of an art piece and that's what's being tokenized.
00:44:18.629 - 00:44:48.565, Speaker A: And that's okay, you can do that, but don't expect it to be worth as much as the. What I'd call the original. Right. Whereas with Xcopy here, yeah, I mean, that's the work, right? The JPEG is the tokenized version. That's the quote unquote original or, you know, the first derivative, so to speak. Lily Illo, my deep gratitude to Michele Colonna and Colonna Contemporary for hosting the show in September. Your unwavering support has always been felt, and I'm honored to get to bring this body of work to your gallery.
00:44:48.565 - 00:45:21.789, Speaker A: So Lily has been putting together these incredible physicals, right. Putting this AI artwork on wood. And I thought I had another. Maybe it's here, another example of this, because this is pretty. Like, you see how beautiful this looks. And by putting. We're back to texture and the importance of texture by printing this out on wood, amazingly, inkjet on wood is, I think, what this.
00:45:21.789 - 00:45:57.971, Speaker A: It gives you the texture. So it's a brilliant solution. And in contrast, in contrast to what we're seeing with Hearst, this isn't just a photo of a digital like this. Let's say this starts with a digital artwork, the AI artwork. But then because it is put on a medium and it's thawed out, then we go I in what I call this a separate artwork. This is a different iteration of this kind of what we might call the original, the AI artwork. But this is a different iteration.
00:45:57.971 - 00:46:33.821, Speaker A: And because it's so thought out it. The way you choose to physically produce a digital artwork is, you know, makes it the art that it is. It is part of the poetry, like it. So if she. If Lily had just put this out on a regular piece of paper that you're going to find on your printer, it wouldn't be as impressive, is it. So the way you make that artwork is part of the art, and as a consequence, it becomes a new art object. Which is interesting, right? Because sometimes.
00:46:33.821 - 00:46:57.205, Speaker A: But with say. And you could actually argue the same thing back to Hurst, Hearst is going the opposite direction. He's making a physical first with the dots, and then he's going, hey, I'm going to take a photo of this, and then I'm going to tokenize it. And that's fair enough. It's a different artwork. And we're even seeing the market, you know, divert. Diverge.
00:46:57.205 - 00:47:45.295, Speaker A: Right. Because now the market's going. I prefer the physical of the Hearst, probably because it's rendered more nicely than a photo of a physical, which isn't as satisfying, at least for, I think, the general. There's going to be exceptions to how people feel about that, but generally speaking, it's just not as satisfying as what you're tempted to call the real thing. And so you could call it a different iteration, but is it as thoughtful as, say, what Lily Illo is doing here? So all to say, I think you can make different iterations, but a photo of a physical with. Without any additional kind of digital manipulation, for example, it's not as exciting, I would argue. Right.
00:47:45.295 - 00:48:19.643, Speaker A: But nothing against. Because a lot of people do put their physicals as digitals, and there's nothing wrong with that, you know. So just. So this is interesting too. A final thing I want to note on this as the show just like balloons out here, Final thing I want to note on this is this punning, this visual punning that's going on here. We have what looks like almost like a wood masonite background, but this is going to be put on top of wood. And this is actually quite brilliant.
00:48:19.643 - 00:48:56.511, Speaker A: I don't know if it was by accident or if Lily put that in later. If that was put in later, it would be absolutely brilliant. Because what that's going to do is it's going to confuse the eye. And all of a sudden you're not going to know as a viewer, I'm betting sometimes of what's the wood, what's the digital. So this becomes quite a brilliant solution, I would argue, of putting this kind of almost wood looking Background even making it brown. So very interesting solution here for AI. I feel like we're treading new ground here.
00:48:56.511 - 00:49:30.137, Speaker A: Like, I mean, I'm not seeing a ton of AI artists do what Lily just did there. I've never seen it done on wood. In a weird way, it kind of works better than what we saw with the manipulated textures of say, art matter, where we put the texture and then the inkjet on top and then to emulate painting. This feels more elegant to a certain degree and so, so to speak. But all of these experiments are important, otherwise we don't learn anything. So nothing against art matter and I'd love to have my work done with art matter there. Kenji Pop.
00:49:30.137 - 00:49:56.851, Speaker A: Kenji Z. For those who don't know, I live in Brazil and Twitter will be banned here. It was a pleasure to be here with you. I will be active on Instagram and appreciate to keep connected with you. It would be pretty devastating, wouldn't it? I mean, I think of just how much value and investment we've all put into Twitter and all of a sudden to be cut off. I mean a serious amount of artists are being cut off here. So hopefully this is temporary is my sense of it.
00:49:56.851 - 00:50:18.245, Speaker A: Object. We're highlighting today a few works by Brazilian artists along with other ways to contact them, follow them outside of X. So this is really cool. And again, I think Object. If they had. Yeah, Object. You know, once again, by not screwing up, all of a sudden it's like, hey, at least I can go to object and check my notifications.
00:50:18.245 - 00:50:43.795, Speaker A: Edmirola Twitter Armageddon starting soon, of course. Ed out of Brazil Neutral Arts Collective celebration. So this happened last week and we have some footage here. Of course. Neutral brought me out to Buenos Aires as part of the ALIF Con conference. And this was also part of the ALF massive like global crypto conference in Buenos Aires. Great night during the Neutral Arts exhibition.
00:50:43.795 - 00:51:04.029, Speaker A: Mine included. This is fake. Later we headed to the Forma City event and finished the night with vermouth and music. And here you kind of see. I believe it was a sold out event. Now this is just the exhibition. I think there's a whole other thing which I'm gonna.
00:51:04.029 - 00:51:20.265, Speaker A: We're gonna see in a second. Or maybe this is the. I'm trying to see if. So this is what I was thinking of. This is pretty impressive. I mean, look at all these computers here. So super impressive.
00:51:20.265 - 00:51:41.287, Speaker A: Performance and outing by by Neutro and I think we have just a few more. Yeah, just more. I saw all sorts of great video here. So there's Neutro, look at this setup. I mean, it's pretty awesome. It's a great group. Neutro over there.
00:51:41.287 - 00:51:59.385, Speaker A: So very cool. Here's Lucas, who helps run it with Dem Bulls. And here again you just see. And there is Nivo, there is Salkian. So yeah, so just. There's Argentina at work. Just awesome.
00:51:59.385 - 00:52:15.309, Speaker A: Aliyah84 yesterday was at the digital art exhibition in Kazan. Nur now N in German means only. I don't know where Kazan is. Maybe that's Japan. I'm not sure some of my artworks were exhibited there. So this is Alia 84. A new discovery here.
00:52:15.309 - 00:52:36.675, Speaker A: And more pixel art out in the wider world. So it's interesting, isn't it? More pixel art. Little cakes. Also on the installation front. I love how this installation integrates the display screens, adding the texture on top. And they aren't just flattened, everything around them. Totally in love.
00:52:36.675 - 00:52:51.011, Speaker A: So pretty fun display here. Look at that. I mean, it kind of looks like. Actually this looks like AI or something. Or augmented reality ar. I don't know. I don't know what's going on here, but it's pretty interesting.
00:52:51.011 - 00:53:04.735, Speaker A: And just some highlights. Again, just more stuff. Across my feed from RGB Montreal, here is Popple. You gotta love this four screen display. We saw the five screen display with waffles work. Like, look how good that looks. The repetition.
00:53:04.735 - 00:53:25.325, Speaker A: Super cool. To get kind of glitch artists or just cool digital artists putting this all together. This is. This is curated by Kozlowski and I think this is Tug Can. Not exactly sure who that is. Matau. So my own video work thanks to Etso and Fosvoo Operator.
00:53:25.325 - 00:53:47.547, Speaker A: So pretty rad. Here's the five screens that we saw with waffles work on. And this is someone else. This is Absurdity. Whose work I think we just started looking at recently. So another video glitch artist. And continuing on, here's Danielle King.
00:53:47.547 - 00:54:02.135, Speaker A: So again, putting large versions of the work here. Always looks great. So there's a ton to look at here. Keselowski, good morning. Please book your flight for next year's edition. Thank me later. It looks great, doesn't it? They really did a good job.
00:54:02.135 - 00:54:31.595, Speaker A: Bosque. Gracias. With work there on the five TVs just rad. So I didn't get everybody. Here's Danielle King on the TV screens, but looking pretty cool, isn't it? And the different TV renderings is just golden because it's just like a Warhol, isn't it? You know, the different renderings, the repetition. But they're all different and it's just like a Warhol screen print of like five elvises, but every rendition is different. Incredibly interesting.
00:54:31.595 - 00:54:59.887, Speaker A: The curation there is art. Kozlowski Kiskalowski so here some work by Kiskowski on the screens. And finally this was sent to me. Saints app. So interesting. There's kind of a Patreon for Tazos which is kind of an interesting thing. So creators have already earned a thousand tezos so where people can subscribe to like a digital art subscription.
00:54:59.887 - 00:55:48.693, Speaker A: What's funny about this for me personally is when I was In Toronto like 2015, I had started a digital art subscription and where I just send people the jpegs and I would try and make it like, oh, you can put it as wallpaper on your phone Again, this is pre nft like that's kind of what we're at. And okay, maybe I can charge like 7.99amonth, you know. So when I see this here ten years later, pretty much it does interest me. I mean this whole idea because what does that become? The beauty of a subscription is its regular revenue, right? So very interesting. Saints app on Tezos Kika Nikolayla this is pretty interesting with their like we know about the referrals, but I'm starting to wonder maybe I should be posting this referral link when I buy stuff. This is so cool.
00:55:48.693 - 00:56:19.535, Speaker A: I love the idea that a few pieces get sold every day because I shared them and I get a few Tezzis to keep collecting art. It is a perfect system. It looks very elegant, doesn't it? So I share pieces get sold, I get Tez Tezos, I collect. I share what I collect. I mean it is quite beautiful. I mean the people at Tazos at Object are very, I'd say very sophisticated in their web design and their web thinking from my perspective. Jan Lucas Migone sketch vs original not sure if we looked at this, I don't think we did.
00:56:19.535 - 00:56:51.929, Speaker A: So beautiful sketch here and then we see where it goes with Yan Lucas Magon this is on Object now available on Object. Bosque Gracias in the studio. So this is hilarious. Like Bosque Gracias is visiting from Argentina brings a lot. Like a lot of this is just stuff that she had to bring with her to on her travels because she has to keep working. So minting some of these works. We're going to look at some of those works is finally 56 minutes maybe.
00:56:51.929 - 00:57:13.473, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know what to do anymore. Ed Marola Me using VPM to access forbidden sites this is gorgeous. Isn't it? Let's see if we can make it slightly bigger here. Let's do this and then maybe we can do this. Exactly. Pretty cool work here. Kind of a smaller work.
00:57:13.473 - 00:57:43.587, Speaker A: Interesting use of the square brush here to contrast. And there is Edmirola as skeleton. Maybe using VPN but shouldn't be in the painting. Fiction, of course. And there is the frame. Beautifully done with this kind of sampled brushwork. Beautiful colors, isn't it? To me, this was like the work of the VPN that kind of just showed the story of the vpn and here captured, shall we say, the story of the vpn.
00:57:43.587 - 00:58:07.479, Speaker A: Love this forest bath. Ed putting out like six works. Stunning works here. And again, we're just seeing this evolution in complexity of these artists in a good way. Like, we're just seeing works that are getting harder and harder to really copy and imitate and just getting more and more kind of evolved. It's quite bullish. Here's another one.
00:58:07.479 - 00:58:33.605, Speaker A: Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, but most times you lose. And again, maybe referring to the Brazil situation, but again, you look at these textures here. You look at the square brush. You look at what Ed drinking, the purple drink there as skeleton. Quite. It's quite remarkable as you see here. Dreaming of regulated social media.
00:58:33.605 - 00:58:59.901, Speaker A: Right. So another work here. And again, different beautiful textures here. Different brush strokes, different kind of brush marks. As you see here. You see here, it looks kind of like kind of a rougher brush, like more of a imitate, you know, maybe a charcoal kind of brush. Whereas here it looks more like just a straight up square pixel brush, you know, like, these are refined works.
00:58:59.901 - 00:59:15.717, Speaker A: These are true paintings, digital paintings. This is at auction for 55 Tezos, waiting for its first bid. Memory from a Mother's Day. Ed Morola also. So putting out a whole bunch of great works here. And as you see here, again, we're back to texture. Look at the sky.
00:59:15.717 - 00:59:33.343, Speaker A: And this beautiful kind of work of a mom and kid. Probably Memory from a Mother's Day. Beautiful title here. Interesting composition. Hundred tezos, edition of 5. Cut his head for Love. And so one more here as you see this awesome underneath here.
00:59:33.343 - 00:59:52.475, Speaker A: And again we see this, like, texture in the background here or on the side in the frame. Well, it looks like a Jesus on a vase. Jesus's head on a vase. Maybe some blood around. Kind of more stream of consciousness art from Ed Morola. Dreams are the main subject matter for Ed. And here you see this, like, flaming sword.
00:59:52.475 - 01:00:13.295, Speaker A: Very interesting again, sort of like hen collector was describing the Uri J. You can Just kind of lose yourself anywhere. Like all great paintings you can generally it doesn't matter where you look. You're gonna. You'll be able to lose yourself. Look at this stunner by Nev 19:14. I mean makes you almost want to see like the, you know how people use neon.
01:00:13.295 - 01:00:37.045, Speaker A: Makes you almost want to see a neon physical of this interesting three dimensional kind of. Look at this. Yeah. So. And even the frame, like the multi color frame here and then this three dimensional frame again, kind of an outrageous decision here. Very nice. Flores Brilliante sold for only 9 tazos edition of 1.
01:00:37.045 - 01:00:47.617, Speaker A: Tons of deals to be had here. Michi Asu with a very cool work. Kind of wish I picked this up. I saw it being minted. I didn't. But I didn't stick around to see it be listed. And then it sold.
01:00:47.617 - 01:00:58.893, Speaker A: I. I didn't think it would sell for $3.19. This one of one by Michi Asu. Touch of green color. Very cool piece. Then putting out this other one. Just interesting.
01:00:58.893 - 01:01:13.623, Speaker A: Right. So a different work and temper picking up both. You might as well. Right, get both. And this is 2002 Digital Wizard. So 2002 putting out a work. This on Zora.
01:01:13.623 - 01:01:44.165, Speaker A: Just an interesting piece here. Kind of juxtaposition, different shapes, often digital, a few gradients. Just interesting digital artwork. Very original. And now is this an older work? Let's just see details. So this is on Zora and I think it's a new mint. Like I think it's a couple of days ago it looks like from the comments again it's kind of hard to tell there it you know, you'd have to go through 111 to find out the mint date.
01:01:44.165 - 01:02:26.659, Speaker A: Cool piece. Here is Wozo as we pass the one hour mark. Yin Yang Kitties. Rad music and so here are some Yin Yang Kitties by Zuozhou. It's just kind of like Zozo gives you everything. Like with digital aesthetics Zozo just overpowers you, overwhelms you with just rich, you know, a lot of digital aesthetics, you know, is like loving like a huge big juicy pixel. Well, Zozo will just give you a whole bunch of those, animate them together, make them beautiful and then add some gradients.
01:02:26.659 - 01:02:46.479, Speaker A: Beautiful sounds, beautiful PB Universal. Very interesting piece. Lula El Dictator. So perhaps referencing the Brazilian situation here. And interesting again kind of playing with outlines and filling it with textures. Beautiful piece here. But then here for contrast really in this beautiful color.
01:02:46.479 - 01:03:11.021, Speaker A: The purple is flat but then you get some textures. So Creating some nice contrast here. Beautiful piece. Kind of has a physical quality to it from PP Universal. Still available for six tazos. Nice work, Judith. By Walk picked up by Mikey Wilson for a mere 10 daysos and getting another one of one from walk which seemed like just walk is.
01:03:11.021 - 01:03:28.799, Speaker A: Yeah, I still need to get like a walk physical. I need some more one of one. I don't know if I have a one of one digital. I need to make sure I do. I think I do, but I'm not positive Cider. So I think we may have seen this Cider found account. I think we may have seen this on.
01:03:28.799 - 01:03:52.877, Speaker A: That looks like a PNG actually I think we may have seen this on Twitter but not positive. And so looking at my super rare feed again, so cool work by Cider on superrare and this sold. And let's just see what happened here. Just transferred. So private sale. And here Cider posted some details here. So again look at what we're discussing.
01:03:52.877 - 01:04:21.305, Speaker A: Digital texture. Look at the richness of this. So very interesting xing with more texture here. An interesting juxtaposition of kind of brushwork, digital brush, kind of square brushes and what again. But there's kind of like you see the arm in motion here and then especially in this kind of sketching part of this work here. So GIF is a gif. Interesting title.
01:04:21.305 - 01:04:46.735, Speaker A: That's just on X Cosimbotus platyrus. So this is Grimoire with a pretty nice looking surveillance camera and a nice kind of classic crypto art iconography. Nice colors too. Even the shadow is quite nice. So that is 579 and that looks like it's almost sold out. Addition of 30. So actually there's maybe 10 that are gone here.
01:04:46.735 - 01:05:08.759, Speaker A: Eight that are gone. Continuing on here is Daniel W. Imago Anima. So interesting move by Daniel W. Kind of looking like a Bernini is what this looks like the ecstasy of St. Agnes. Is that what this is? I can't remember but it looks familiar.
01:05:08.759 - 01:05:41.962, Speaker A: And so nice illustration by and probably a pastiche by Daniel W. Although it's probably a drawing of a sculpture is really what this is I think. Rami Mamedi Overture so here, nice kind of digital illustration. This is on foundation. And here just an interesting different kind of abstract. Abstract illustration. Sorry, this is on Exchange Art and that is for a reserve of 3 Sol.
01:05:41.962 - 01:06:03.565, Speaker A: And so interesting piece there. Here's Pamela Cirone 1999 Livis. So just more cool work from Pamela Cirone. Almost looking like collage. But is an illustration nice kind of textured Background edition of one three tazos at auction. So you might get lucky. Kel's put in three tazos.
01:06:03.565 - 01:06:22.449, Speaker A: Demon Ego also a work. This is an edition of one and this sold for 44 tezos. So the market healthy as ever. Cool video. Or at least gif looking a video that's been gift. I guess so pretty nice piece. Kind of almost looks like a poster.
01:06:22.449 - 01:06:50.285, Speaker A: A moving poster. Planet 64 by Demon Ego September 2024 and here's a wild kind of collaboration. Santiago and Rada. So you see the rats here and so getting the Santiago's abstract art treatment here. And there is another one. So pretty awesome collaboration from Rada and Santiago. X rayed night scene showing loud arrival of alien pirates.
01:06:50.285 - 01:07:10.043, Speaker A: So I guess these are the pirates over here. Interesting mix of abstract and representation. Anis Abdon Pixel art. So here kind of a cool one. And as I almost feel like the color palettes are starting to change. We saw it in the last the purple and the blue. I wonder if it's a season change at all.
01:07:10.043 - 01:07:33.525, Speaker A: But anyways, here is a beautiful composition of an apartment building seemingly by Anis Abdin. Here is AK Dell with what looks like Venice. It is Venice edition of three. So nice big pixel art piece from AK Dell. Nice color there too. And that's called 22. Here is Aleja 84.
01:07:33.525 - 01:07:55.405, Speaker A: So scary. Scary Winter Forest Road. It's a little bit of kind of 8 bit music or synth music. Pretty hilarious to just put the red lights here and then everything else just kind of desaturated. Pretty cool. The frog xylophone. Here is another piece of first syndrome.
01:07:55.405 - 01:08:17.665, Speaker A: Kind of a video game. Kind of looks like AI. I have to scroll through it a little bit for time. We're already at an hour eight. So again kind of looks like AI here, doesn't it? So but kind of pixel AI. Pixel art AI. Here's her Mape Pixel art.
01:08:17.665 - 01:08:40.633, Speaker A: So believe they make this on their phone. Interestingly beautiful pixel artist. You can find them on Instagram. Element Lee also works with their phone. Cornfield in Two Worlds. Very interesting avant garde pixel art here. Here's Jean Provencher and it looks like a trading card kind of pixeled out here.
01:08:40.633 - 01:08:58.491, Speaker A: Or sorry a playing card. Maybe the queen. Or it looks like the queen of hearts over here. So interesting piece. Braindead who of course I follow work in progress for upcoming drop. So cool kind of synth work here by Braindead. Cool colors too.
01:08:58.491 - 01:09:27.209, Speaker A: And here's one on object pixel art. Bird Army. This is five Tezos and referencing the toolbox here that Classic sort of digital art UI interface using the fill tool. Hilarious. Interesting, interesting, interesting. Here is Noodler. I thought Noodler was maybe mech memories woven through cobalt, but I'm not sure.
01:09:27.209 - 01:09:49.657, Speaker A: Kind of has a similar style, but maybe it is, but not entirely. Maybe it's a completely different person here and it is quite different in its own way. So orange and blue, cool contrast here. And so here is a figure and kind of a poetic work here. Lots of different designs and everything. Edition of 20 now 20 tazos. Selling out.
01:09:49.657 - 01:10:07.153, Speaker A: So nice work from noodler. Only two tazos. Pretty reasonable. 69 ghosts. So we saw this in the intro. So a lot of beach activity, which looks awesome here. Can't wait to go to the beach in Greece and relive that pixel artwork.
01:10:07.153 - 01:10:33.009, Speaker A: R presti estrado number 13. Interesting pixel art abstract here. So continuing on with that September 2nd, here's Psycho Futurists. Marbles that cracked. Marbles that will not crack, marbles that will never be played. So here adding a little more dithering into this work here. Interestingly so very interesting, but with the similar animations, but maybe kind of rendered.
01:10:33.009 - 01:10:54.625, Speaker A: Really the way this child is being rendered here is quite interesting. Almost as if there's like a cycling gradient that's going through it, kind of masking it. Sean Luke with a pretty cool work here. Headless Summer. Definitely feels like summer in the colors there, and that is appreciated. Headless summer edition of 22. Let's see how it's doing.
01:10:54.625 - 01:11:12.199, Speaker A: Has just transferred to probably previous collectors. Continuing on, press any key to continue. Renato Marini, Paradise Grass. This is from July, but I believe we missed it. So just saw this on X and thought, oh, cool work here. Some grass again. Kind of has a summer vibe to it.
01:11:12.199 - 01:11:49.243, Speaker A: Abstract Art Digital compositing edition of eight. And this is sold out at 666. Here's Elna Frederick, 45. Not sure what this is referencing to, but some patterns and of course the cycling kind of flashing style that we know Eleanor Frederick for. Here's Lorna Mills and I feel like I've seen this work maybe on Instagram, but I could be wrong, but just minted to the airborne and this cool kind of mustard yellow, maybe a little darker ochre. And here, Beautiful nature work by Lorna mills. Edition of 30.
01:11:49.243 - 01:12:04.681, Speaker A: And that is 20 tazos. And there are 10 left, maybe 22 left. Kotenakazono continuum number 206. So cool. Animated abstract from Kota Nakazono. We're familiar with like the biomorphic. Biomorphic Animation in the front.
01:12:04.681 - 01:12:28.945, Speaker A: Kind of a different move in the background with this almost like kind of collagey Photoshop Y background that is cycling through in the gif. Here's Renki Echizen Hanando. Super prolific, I think. Puts out work every day. This is probably a one of one and doesn't even bother to list it. I do that with my bitcoin work. I don't even bother to list it.
01:12:28.945 - 01:12:45.257, Speaker A: Not yet. I kind of relate to Renki in that respect. Little Octopus. This is by Sabato and Aitso. So another collaboration here we saw the animal from before whose name I always forget like the Capar Bara or. And here we have an octopus. So.
01:12:45.257 - 01:13:08.001, Speaker A: And I believe this is based octopus drawn on Textura landscaper circuit. Bent my first Sony electronic sketchpad and glitched by John Carborn in a On a dream weapon at ETSO Studio on the morning after RGB Montreal. So it's pretty cool. Shows how quickly art can be put together here. And then here's a different variation. Right. And then just recording the.
01:13:08.001 - 01:13:27.445, Speaker A: Even putting the TV in there and even the videos. Interesting move. And then great color here and just minting that. And then here is kind of more up close. So kind of a window on how some of these analog video glitch artists work. Right. Oftentimes it's just like videotaping the screen.
01:13:27.445 - 01:13:41.949, Speaker A: Interestingly. Little Octopus deluxe edition of 12. And this is at 88 selling for 25 tezos. A lot being sold here. Pretty awesome. This is Bosque gracias we saw at the beginning of the show. This is the Traveler Journal.
01:13:41.949 - 01:14:00.105, Speaker A: So on the road Fantasy Chapters just has to create. So just awesome. So I got a couple of them here. There are five that have been released as part of this journal. The first three are gone and you can get them for 12 Tezos. Here's another one still available. 12 Tezos one of one.
01:14:00.105 - 01:14:19.255, Speaker A: So pretty cool artwork here. Fantasy chapters number five. Here's Ex Mortal who's going to be on this week's Spaces. Kind of a different looking work from X Mortal. We'll see if it loads up. It may not as we hit the 1 hour 15 mark. So I don't know what I'm gonna do to shorten the show.
01:14:19.255 - 01:14:34.861, Speaker A: I'm not gonna worry about it too much. But we will. So I'm gonna have to leave it at this size. In pieces by xmortal. Interesting piece. Kind of a different angle on the analog video glitch. Here is Kiro and let's see if we can make that one bigger.
01:14:34.861 - 01:15:01.773, Speaker A: So playing with Anime and Video Processing or kind of Anime Source and Video Processing has done a few works in that spirit. This is on foundation, but on base. So interesting. And here is Salawaki, the Art Chain Report, a series she's been putting out. And this goes for two minutes. So it's always hard to show Salowaki's work because it's a little long. So I have to.
01:15:01.773 - 01:15:19.549, Speaker A: So again, you see Internet Brazil sadness. So this is On Object. I'm not sure if this is even going to load. It's always a struggle. The larger works. And there's Ed Merola getting a mention. So hilarious as ever.
01:15:19.549 - 01:15:39.127, Speaker A: And the Trouts, of course, had to make an appearance. So this is open edition for two tazos each. Already 70 minted from Salwaki. So we will leave that there. Here's Marietta with a pretty cool chair. New GLB possible objects. So cool looks.
01:15:39.127 - 01:16:00.966, Speaker A: Looks like CGI of a chair. Interestingly nice kind of gradient background there. This is gonna be On Object. And here is Dr. Bill Kolomachek, if I'm pronouncing that right. Fuzz Tessellation number one. So again, very early made generative art in the 1970s.
01:16:00.966 - 01:16:30.265, Speaker A: We did a great space with Dr. Bill a couple of weeks ago when I was in Argentina there. And yeah, just another. So interesting work here. This is On Object using FX hash. Here is no Hygiene as we move into AI here. So experimental AI from no Hygiene as we will see kind of going monochromatic for the most part here and looking like different AI figures kind of collaged together.
01:16:30.265 - 01:16:45.621, Speaker A: Auction starting at 0.08 ETH. Here's another one. This is On Object. And this is an addition of one for 19 tezos. Nice small work, animated, so bringing animations into the piece. This one is quite beautiful as well.
01:16:45.621 - 01:17:07.785, Speaker A: This is going for 80 tezos. And you see almost some nice kind of pixeling rendition. Not sold. Selling for 80 tezos. And I had to show this one, this outrageous work here by no Hygiene. Offending sensibilities here. And just another example of the very edgy work by nohygiene.
01:17:07.785 - 01:17:23.667, Speaker A: Here's rj. This was quite brilliant portraiture. The system is the painting. That is almost what I think I should call this show. We're discussing the system. I think that's why I thought of that because I had read that description in RJ's work. So quite a brilliant work here.
01:17:23.667 - 01:17:44.629, Speaker A: I think it's AI. Not exactly sure. Maybe a combination. It doesn't say. But you See this person from the back and it's kind of animated a little bit. And here in the computer we see the figure in green on this small kind of retro AI computer. We have a few other works by rj.
01:17:44.629 - 01:18:00.629, Speaker A: The Knowing Room. And here again is there animation. Kind of hard to tell. Kind of almost looks that way, but not positive. Here that's owned by AHEC and picked up for 15 tezos. Another AI work. The knowing Room is.
01:18:00.629 - 01:18:14.537, Speaker A: So the works are selling. So that's pretty cool. Pretty poetic. Works here. Kind of has a Hockney feel in their silence, so to speak. Just kind of still works with the technology. People in their computers, you know, the suit.
01:18:14.537 - 01:18:29.361, Speaker A: Big computer. Pretty interesting piece. Drew is a big RJ collector, if I remember right. Interesting floor. They look like AI artworks. It's not clear. The studio one and then a plant, a computer and a frame.
01:18:29.361 - 01:18:43.705, Speaker A: Pretty cool works by rj. Always experimenting. Here's Tokes. Rad AI artwork here. I don't know if we looked at that one, but it is pretty impressive. Here's another one by Touques. Big kind of epic landscape done with AI.
01:18:43.705 - 01:19:07.005, Speaker A: And here into the physicals we go. Berlin Brussels Art Project. This is P. Revel, if I am reading the name or R Reveal if I'm reading the signature right. It doesn't say in the post, but interesting painting. People I know actually who moved to Brussels from Berlin. Isabella Disclafani.
01:19:07.005 - 01:19:30.275, Speaker A: Interesting. Cool portrait of a baseball player. I always loved that kind of subject matter for some reason. Atomized 2024. So this is by Michael Pybus. So interesting, interestingly painted work here of someone looking through books and then having these huge. Kind of almost referencing the printing of the bendy dots of printing.
01:19:30.275 - 01:19:46.237, Speaker A: Charlie Stein, another friend now in New York. Oil on canvas. Parthenogenesis. So getting pretty cool in this kind of robot latex kind of vibe. 36 by 72, not small. Mark Belden Yellow sofa. Oil on linen.
01:19:46.237 - 01:19:57.559, Speaker A: 36 by 41 centimeters. This one's quite small. Beautiful, beautiful work though. You gotta love. I don't know if you can see it. So it's like an old sofa. You gotta love the texture of this gorgeously painted artwork.
01:19:57.559 - 01:20:18.295, Speaker A: Not too big. Bandozo Bandido Harry Pottery. This is funny vase. 480 BC off white trademark. So interesting piece here as ever. And Aryo Tojojo from It's Not Galleries. Kind of a funny work with an alien giving the finger another airbrush work.
01:20:18.295 - 01:20:40.445, Speaker A: Seemingly Moto Moto Hero. This is part of a six meter painting. So just an awesome painter who I think is doing quite well. Kind of where illustration meets painting a little bit with this work. And here you see one of their drawings, one of their amazing drawings. Human helicopter. Such an interesting artist David Hale has been following for years.
01:20:40.445 - 01:20:53.777, Speaker A: Just a really look at that. You see the artist at work here. Amazing. You gotta love this. Beautiful. I really love this kind of unfinished aspect of it. There's a natural contrast there.
01:20:53.777 - 01:21:18.831, Speaker A: And continuing on PP Universal again with just a cool physical here. PP puts out a work a day. He was mentioning sometimes more. I didn't realize that when but until I talked to him and that my friends is your show we'll see on Wednesday. And there's a don't forget the Twitter space, the X space with X mortal on Wednesday at 9:30 New York time. 3:30 here in Berlin in Central European time. Thank you for joining me.
01:21:18.831 - 01:21:20.575, Speaker A: Until next time, take care.
