00:00:02.560 - 00:00:24.590, Speaker A: Good morning. Artist journal, August 28, 2022, Berlin. My name is Adrian Pokabelli, artist reporter on the scene. Once again, amazed and delighted with the response of yesterday's video. But I'm not surprised, actually. Ratcloaksee. Yeah.
00:00:24.590 - 00:00:46.126, Speaker A: And I'm just not surprised that people enjoy someone talking about his work. So, anyway, it's almost overwhelming. I won't call it an overwhelming response, but it was a very nice response I got there. Continuing, continuing to get it. So appreciate that. And so we continue here. Let's get to it.
00:00:46.126 - 00:01:28.584, Speaker A: Let's keep it short because I think there's value in keeping these things short, really. Today. I, it is actually, first of all, I would have looked at Morlatko's work, who I'm a huge fan of anyway. But I also want to give a tribute to those people that are kind of doing nice things, like, we're going to come back to Morlakos in a second here, who I just find he's, again, just one of these kind of unique kind of talents. Let's just go. I mean, just to show you guys, I mean, probably most of you guys saw this, the people that watch this channel, I mean, hilarious, right? This is by Minta. And, you know, screenshots.
00:01:28.584 - 00:02:01.788, Speaker A: Screenshots are close to my heart. I mean, I used to call myself basically a screenshot artist. I was telling Minta, minta's like, you know, don't feel you need to mention this or anything. And I was like, well, I'm not gonna mention this because this is probably the first time I've ever actually had my portrait done. I think maybe I've, I should be doing my portrait as an artist. I should be kind of doing self portraits, but it's just never really been a huge problem priority for me. But so this is pretty funny of the myth video.
00:02:01.788 - 00:02:19.316, Speaker A: And my favorite part is the subscribe. So anyway, thank you, Minta. A few hearts there. Thank you, Minta. And it's just fantastic. And, yeah, I mean, I'll just go back because I was telling Minta. So I brought up some old screenshots.
00:02:19.316 - 00:02:38.590, Speaker A: These are on my website, but you can't even find these on my website. They're on the hidden pages of my website. And I think it is kind of worth bringing up. And, I mean, it's kind of hilarious. So you see, I mean, these are old Twitter screenshots. These are oil on canvas. Game of war, actually, a funny story on this one.
00:02:38.590 - 00:03:08.484, Speaker A: The CEO of Game of War actually messaged me, emailed me, and I think, and he was interested in the piece of buying this. Like, he just kind of cold called. Like, someone showed this to me on Twitter, a different version. And of. I think I made the price too low. I was like, I don't know, I was sort of like $800 and I never heard back. So either he lost interest or maybe it was too low for a CEO of some gaming company.
00:03:08.484 - 00:03:30.140, Speaker A: Just like, these are the real life stories of artists. Not only do you have to be a master of your craft or brilliant or whatever the case may be, you also have to be a salesperson. You got to have your website updated. Mine's not updated. I mean, it's July 28. I go, okay, good enough. I mean, I need to kind of need a new website.
00:03:30.140 - 00:03:57.204, Speaker A: I was looking at it. I wasn't happy with it. So anyways, annual air crash fatalities, we have a Ballard influence. Okay. Remember we were talking about JG Ballard? So anyways, I don't want to go too far in this, you know, but just to say the screenshots are a. Let me see if we can fix this. Are a part of my work.
00:03:57.204 - 00:04:14.198, Speaker A: So my screen is back. And, yeah, you see more. I even had the tinder one, which is hilarious. So I think Mint is on the right track here. This was a diptych. I don't want to go too far into my work, but just to show you. Yeah, and here's actually the peloponnesian war.
00:04:14.198 - 00:04:42.570, Speaker A: So you see, these kind of ideas were percolating in different forms. This is a different kind of take on the screenshots. I actually sent this one to the reporter, Katya Kazakhina, and she loved it, actually. Well, why not? If someone's doing a screenshot of your story? She's actually a famous arts reporter. She worked for the New York Times for a bit. Now I think she's with some big art publication. I don't know her or anything.
00:04:42.570 - 00:05:02.162, Speaker A: I mean, that's probably the last contact. I like her posts once in a while on Instagram. So Murlako's also says some nice things, but that's not why we're talking about him. I was going to talk about him anyways. I assume Morlakos is a dude. We'll just call him Morlakos. This piece always sort of really excited me.
00:05:02.162 - 00:05:32.984, Speaker A: I mean, I saw Cimabue, what I used to call Cimabue, but it's actually by Berlingiero circa 20, circa 1230. We can actually do a quick search on that. You know what's kind of funny? I never noticed the knife here. I never noticed the knife until today. So that's kind of funny. I just liked kind of an original rendition of, like, a modern rendition of the Madonna and Child, I guess. That's just how much I like.
00:05:32.984 - 00:05:56.984, Speaker A: That's how much I like italian painting. Let's see if we can. Oh, yeah, here we go. Berlinghiro at the Met, the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Let's do this. So, yeah, pretty cool. And then we'll go back to this.
00:05:56.984 - 00:06:20.336, Speaker A: So a nice original rendition. I love Morlaco's style. Let's look. He has this other one, which is classic for him, only for four tazos, I might add. And that was part of a new series he had. And this was a classic. I mean, I had to buy this.
00:06:20.336 - 00:06:36.220, Speaker A: I think I paid, like, 20 for that or something. I paid 18. It's ten now. So again, like, these are classic. Classic to me. These are classic tezos works and. Yeah, let's go to one more that I remember.
00:06:36.220 - 00:06:58.630, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, he's got a couple. I mean, one he has the myth in. I mean, this is an amazing one. The Red Knight. I love these ones, you know? And I was just imagining to myself, these on the gallery wall, my gallery in my head, because I'm still not sure how these will actually all be shown. Go to one more here. Yeah, this one has to be shown.
00:06:58.630 - 00:07:33.834, Speaker A: I mean, you can get this for 17 still, edition of 25. Would I pay 16? So I think Rata had a couple of copies. It's always nice. Another little tip here is to go in here and to see if a lot of people have, you know, if someone has, like, seven, it kind of screws up the market a little bit. For me. It becomes slightly less appealing if you see there's someone with seven. Cause you feel you're gonna buy it, and someone will just put it back on the market and, you know, like, in a sense, like, it's about the art, but it's nice to feel like your investment is gonna go well.
00:07:33.834 - 00:08:01.860, Speaker A: If you're spending $100 or 30 or even $30 on a piece of art, you kind of don't wanna feel like you kinda wanna feel like it's a good investment, too. I mean, that's part of the art business. Business as a collector. So I sometimes look at the owners, and I sometimes look like, is there someone that owns ten of these? And that will make it slightly less desirable. But what an awesome work here. Again, the myth. I mean, you see the myth.
00:08:01.860 - 00:08:38.234, Speaker A: I mean, someone was calling him, like, the spiritual, not the avatar. I mean, that's an overstatement, but the spiritual kind of. He had a great word for it. I can't remember it at the top of my head, but kind of like, let's just call it inspiration for lack of better words, for a lot of people. And he's on the astral plane or something to that effect. Someone wrote a really nice message about that. So here's the myth again, and this is important, this is part of what makes Tezos awesome too, is you see, there's almost like this mythology that's growing up.
00:08:38.234 - 00:09:20.510, Speaker A: Speaking of myth, around the whole ecosystem, like you see, like there's a rat cloak. See, with the myth, you see these celebrations. Yeah. And here you see. Thanks, myth. Okay, so you see, like, again, especially for those people that are in the ecosystem, particularly those people who've been in it longer than I have, this is not news, but there are a lot of people probably that are watching this perhaps, or a few people who are kind of clueing in and being like, oh. And that's kind of what makes Tezos ecosystem as an art ecosystem special is you do start to see these kind of hat tips.
00:09:20.510 - 00:10:07.544, Speaker A: And maybe this brings it back to art history, because what you see is say, like, I remember, I can't remember the exact works, but often what you'll see, say in modernist art, for example, where in the history of art is artists will respond to other artists. So there's a piece, I think it was Duchamp made a piece. And I remember one book talking about how Max Ernst had made a response to Duchamp's piece. I think it was to the glass or something. I don't know what Ernst's response was to that. I think I know, I think it was like a 1950s Ernst work, which I mean, Ernst in the fifties. I want to keep these short for you guys.
00:10:07.544 - 00:10:26.984, Speaker A: Let's just see if we can quickly see. Yeah, I don't think. I don't think we'll find what I'm looking for here. Yeah, Ernst's work in the fifties is actually quite interesting. Always interesting. Max Ernst always evolving. A fantastic painter.
00:10:26.984 - 00:11:07.800, Speaker A: Anyways, that's not the point here. Max Ernst. The point is this idea of there being responses to the idea of making a response to another artist. You see that on tasos to a certain degree, or even referencing this kind of narrative, that kind of forms. And it's like, because what is myth doing here? So anyways, I wanted to touch on that and very quickly, Lewis Osborne again had a drop. And I just wanted to show you, like the update. I mean, in a sense, this does become like a kind of the latest the news here.
00:11:07.800 - 00:11:28.294, Speaker A: Let's just actually quickly look at his activity. You know, nice activity, nothing too crazy, but this is the thing. Okay. Actually, there is some pretty wild stuff here. Balloon four launched yesterday. And you see. And he put out a tweet.
00:11:28.294 - 00:11:49.784, Speaker A: Let's just go to Louis. Sorry, hide this. Lewis Osborne, he put out a tweet, which was kind of interesting. Sound like the sale went kind of crazy. Thank you all. Here it is. Thank you all so much for your offers.
00:11:49.784 - 00:12:13.844, Speaker A: That was pure chaos. I couldn't accept offers as people were canceling them while I was accepting, so they failed. I used the history tab and accepted the top nine offers that came up to 16:00. Anything after that time did not count. So. And then you look at the offers, and then we'll wrap it up on that. So let's go to the work.
00:12:13.844 - 00:12:28.430, Speaker A: Interesting work. One of his balloons. Edition of ten. Buy for 121. Let's look at the history. The last sale was for 130. It's a skunny.
00:12:28.430 - 00:13:05.650, Speaker A: So it's getting serious over here with Lewis Osborne. It continues to be serious. The longer this goes on for, the less of a flash in the pan. This looks like, the more kind of like this looks solid and it's not just like a crypto pump and dump, so to speak. And you look at the offers that were accepted. 108, 8757-5717 and the lowest was 68, and then reselling for 130. So just a quick update on Lewis Osborne scene here, because it's pretty kind of.
00:13:05.650 - 00:13:50.506, Speaker A: Again, this is our case study of what I think we can come to expect further down the road here with other artists. So back to this idea of are you going to spend 70 tezos and, like, be right beside your computer to get the latest of your artists that you're buying now for three tezos, because it's back to this idea of kind of buy while you can and create a collection while you can. Because there is a possibility here that a lot of us get priced out really quickly because, you know, all of a sudden, you have to reconfigure and reimagine what this all means. If you have to pay €120 versus, sorry, 120 tezos versus two. Two. I don't think twice. It's like, cool.
00:13:50.506 - 00:14:04.994, Speaker A: It's a cool work. I'll give you $3. So anyway, so that is the latest. We're gonna keep it short and sweet here today. Thank you for joining us once again, until next week's. Until next episode. Take care.
