00:00:03.280 - 00:00:32.874, Speaker A: It's feeling 24/7 over here as we continue to sail forward through icebergs and blue skies with sun. And here in the external world, it's kind of a combination of cloud and sun as well. Your weather report from Berlin, Germany. Artist journal, February 16, 2024. Broadcasting from the ship in my mind, where I have an editor's desk. And here we sit, my friends, you and me, one more time, capping it off. It is Friday.
00:00:32.874 - 00:00:58.524, Speaker A: Hallelujah. A true, deep hallelujah. And welcome back. So an absolute ton to get through today. There were so many works I could have started with as well. And again, it's only been 48 hours since the last show. Isn't that interesting? And it recalls a conversation I was having with my new friend Arnaud over coffee yesterday.
00:00:58.524 - 00:01:17.092, Speaker A: And it was a very interesting. A common kind of response I get. I brought this up in the space with unknown collector last night. A common response I get to. This show is kind of a. It's interesting, but I have no idea what's going on, this sort of thing. And it really just reminds.
00:01:17.092 - 00:02:02.978, Speaker A: It's a. It's a stark reminder that what is. Has become normal for a lot of us in this scene. As far as aesthetic understanding of a certain style of working and doing art is not necessarily, you know, as easy as it might sound. And I was bringing up, just finally here, since one could argue, this is kind of like pixel art, I was bringing up how, and I've brought this up before, how, when I started this show and I started bringing in pixel art. That was a big decision for me. Like, I was almost, to a certain degree, do I want to go there? And, you know, now, it would have been absolute foolishness not to show pixel art.
00:02:02.978 - 00:02:24.164, Speaker A: But I say that as a way of illustrating how the external world outside of, you know, a fairly large international bubble. Which is why I went with this, actually. The year of the dragon here by Sabato. It is Chinese New Year's. I think that goes for a week or two. I should know more about it. It's happening now, as I understand.
00:02:24.164 - 00:03:14.436, Speaker A: I should celebrate that this weekend. But all to say, it's easy for us to forget that people who are not, you know, speaking our language, our visual language, it's easy for us to forget that they might not really. That this is not as accessible as it might seem in the same way as me speaking to you. I just assume that you understand what I'm saying. But maybe some of you are in different languages, and I know there are, and you have to have the translator and everything. So all to say, isn't that interesting? Isn't that interesting? And, yeah, let's just leave that one there because there's literally like, there's too many tabs to go through here. And we have just so many beautiful works to go through.
00:03:14.436 - 00:03:43.560, Speaker A: So let's begin. This is Sabato. This is on Zora, which is a L2 on Ethereum. And almost, as I have to remind myself that there are constantly new viewers here, too, that I have to make sure they understand what I'm talking about. So L2 on Ethereum, Zora, a marketplace. And here we're using deluxe paint for what I like to call retro tool. A retro tool.
00:03:43.560 - 00:04:38.808, Speaker A: So which is a classic glitch art technique to use retro tools, or at least you'll see a lot of glitch artists do this. Sabato, I think we could call a glitch artist or has been on the glitch chat boards there and has put out a lot of glitch work. So this is kind of, you know, working with these vintage softwares, as I think Kristin Roose puts it, and I think is more commonly explained, as you know, is kind of a, a technique of sorts or of way of operating. So here we have deluxe paint. Four, I think, came out in the late eighties, and we see a dragon. And what's interesting about this is it's kind of, again, it's kind of deceptive in its complexity because it has a fairly like look at the, what I find interesting, you know, of many things, is, first, the color. The color works on what I call the reptilian level.
00:04:38.808 - 00:05:23.992, Speaker A: It works just immediately. As soon as you see it, you delight. It kind of has that, again, these cycling gradients, and it just creates this sense of pleasure of color, this kind of dance of color. It delights the eyes, and it's just kind of hypnotizing. And then you even have a beautiful black, sorry, blue backdrop with some gradients in there again, a few gradients in there again, making kind of, this is deceptive, looks deceptively simple. The real revolution, though, I would argue, of this work, is actually how this dragon, and it's called the year of the dragon, is kind of blockily, you know, portrayed here, which I think is quite interesting. Beautiful eye there, too.
00:05:23.992 - 00:05:53.616, Speaker A: Kind of reminiscent of those dragon costumes, for lack of better term, where you'll see several dancers. And then that eye kind of reminds you, but it's just a rainbow gradient, interestingly. But doing this locky like format. And also, if you look at the scales of the dragon. You know, the skin of the dragon, the scales here. It's interesting, I think, as well, how it turns into kind of. There's a.
00:05:53.616 - 00:06:58.324, Speaker A: In the last little area here as it tapers off. It's a different kind of portrayal. And it's almost as if this is to give it a sense of space, because up here in the neck and the head, we see a very kind of detailed portrayal here. We see, like, kind of a middle ground of sorts and then a background, kind of a foreground, middle ground and background of sorts, creating, interestingly, a sense of space, but also keeping this kind of squarishness here. And also, you know, the leg looking pretty much like the same sort of size as this leg here, all giving it a kind of computer graphic y kind of look, which for, again, for those that are not necessarily been exposed to a lot of this is a kind of aesthetic of sorts, in a sense. Maybe part of the mission of this show is, you know, and I didn't have this when I started this show, but is kind of helping. One of the things it can do is help explain this kind of aesthetic, you know, of.
00:06:58.324 - 00:07:30.304, Speaker A: Of this scene to a certain degree for those that might understand. So, anyway, many things we can do here. Just a beautiful work, interestingly, a blocky head here and cool little flaring nostrils. A delightful, fun work that kids can understand, but still sophisticated, you know, for the connoisseurs. So let us continue here. And so this is called year of the dragon, and it's on Zora. There are 187 minted.
00:07:30.304 - 00:07:48.266, Speaker A: This is what's called a free mint. In other words, it costs a couple of bucks to mint this thing in fees. And then. Yeah, so just a gorgeous work here. Nice work on the text and the background, too, which Sabato controls. Lots of nice comments here. One of the nice things of Zora.
00:07:48.266 - 00:08:38.622, Speaker A: And this is available for 30 days now. We have seen this before. I did want to bring this up because that blocky, you know, portrayal, again, kind of computer graphic. Yeah, portrayal kind of reminiscent very obliquely of what we see in Ultima four. It's like a space that is created through kind of computer graphics because what's going on in Ultima four, it's kind of simultaneously, there's the figure, and I don't want to go too far because a lot of people might not know what I'm talking about here again, but there's the figure who you see kind of going through space, and that's kind of like straight on. But it also feels like you're taking at least a 45 degree angle, but it's so flat, so it becomes a kind of computer graphic space. And I think we're seeing something similar in the dragon there.
00:08:38.622 - 00:09:08.656, Speaker A: And we saw it kind of here, too, with the goose. And these are Sabato's drawing exercises here on object, which is on the Tezos blockchain, of course. And as you see here, we saw it like, I was like, I've seen that kind of structure before with Sabato again doing an animal. And here we have, you know, which was making light of the goose auction, the artwork. And so that was. When was that? June 16. So that was about six months ago.
00:09:08.656 - 00:09:31.294, Speaker A: Seven months ago. Adezos. You know, Sabato's secondary here is doing quite well on these drawing exercises. And as you see here is at 68 here, just of the ones that were put on object. And it's a really delightful series. And just finally here, here's VFX farm, probably one of my favorites, actually. I'll show you my favorite.
00:09:31.294 - 00:09:55.274, Speaker A: I think there's a lot of favorites. This one's great. Just people working in the office with drones. I think if I had to pick one. And who wants to just pick one? The ping pong player is actually also pretty awesome. This one is also. And it's kind of back to this kind of just, you know, you see the power of aesthetics and just pure aesthetic, you know, again, just kind of like cycling color here.
00:09:55.274 - 00:10:12.174, Speaker A: This is the one that would come to mind. But there are a ton. But just a delightful composition here. And execution. High rise window washer. How much is that? Not even for sale. Very low, very low edition for this series, 16.
00:10:12.174 - 00:10:46.544, Speaker A: So really cool work there from Sabato. So go mint that it will cost you only a couple of bucks for the year of the dragon. And. Yeah, let's just keep going here. I guess the final thing I want to say on this is I'm thinking of doing some sort of intro videos so people understand where I can say at the start. If you don't know what I'm talking about, check out the videos below. And then you'll have something like an hour on pixel art, an hour on, you know, various different kinds of genres, maybe glitch, whatever, all the digital painting.
00:10:46.544 - 00:11:40.516, Speaker A: And then just to introduce people and then talk about that. So people have kind of a clue going into this because, again, it's easy to forget. It's the most common thing I hear from people outside of this scene is it looks interesting, but I don't know what's going on. And it's a stark reminder for all of us within it that this may not be as accessible as we think. And we think what's not accessible about pixel art, but it's about the kind of leap in judgment that one requires to say, I would argue, feel free to disagree and leave a comment. I would argue it's the leap that says this is art that we can take seriously. And that's not a, it's kind of counterintuitive because it looks like a video game, it looks like this looks like kids stuff, right? If you don't know what you're seeing, right? Or if you don't understand maybe the subtleties or, or you just haven't been exposed to a lot of it.
00:11:40.516 - 00:12:09.280, Speaker A: So all to say, lots to do here. The mission continues. Artist Journal lives so we had Calo on digital art and NFT media. Now for those that are kind of looking to sharpen their entrepreneurial skills, I highly recommend to give this a listen. It is in my feed. It was super interesting how Calo has turned his newsletter into a business, and it is a true business. I was taking note there and it's super interesting.
00:12:09.280 - 00:12:39.350, Speaker A: So maybe, just maybe, we can do the same thing here. So again, if you're kind of wondering about just good ideas, I guess Calo, I didn't realize, I think, studied data science and entrepreneurialism as kind of specialties. I think in college, as far as I understand, it's all in the space there. A super fascinating space. So big shout out to Kalo and thanks for coming on the show. Unknown collector. So this was fun too with click create last night.
00:12:39.350 - 00:12:55.774, Speaker A: Collector's corner digital art and culture with Adrian Pokerbelly. So big shout out to unknown collector and click create. Thanks for having me there. That was a ton of fun. Just did that last night. It is 24/7 over here. Hilariously, that was just a really, really fun conversation.
00:12:55.774 - 00:13:18.896, Speaker A: So that is also posted in the feed if you're interested. I go into the background and all sorts of stuff of my history there. Okay, so comments on last show. We are all remixers. That wonderful statement by Dan Control score, also known as Saiko. Thank you so much for reviewing about Art fair Tokyo and the exhibition. Yes, the exhibition has been held in Tokyo.
00:13:18.896 - 00:13:35.854, Speaker A: There are so many legendary artists in the lineup. I'll share photos and videos of the art fair. It must be interesting there. Indeed, please do. And we will show them here. Santiago Ruau I always discover new artists in your program. Thank you and I really appreciate that, Santiago, because I believe you've been watching for quite a while now.
00:13:35.854 - 00:13:54.842, Speaker A: So I'm glad to hear that. Very glad to hear that. Crash stop. Remix culture is at the heart of any going back to the Renaissance or further. Indeed. It's like with a different name, but exactly. I mean, t's Elliott, I think, called it the anxiety of influence.
00:13:54.842 - 00:14:31.814, Speaker A: Right. We should actually, if we were to get really high end here, we should open that essay at a certain point. Maybe I'll try and I'll take a look at it on the weekend and see if it's something that is kind of YouTube friendly, you know, show friendly. Here, let's continue with what Crashtop is saying. Remix culture is at the heart of anything going, of any art going back to the Renaissance or further. Each generation looks at previous generation works and borrows themes, iconography, techniques, or just plain copies. As Lawrence Lacige I've described what I mean by remix, by describing a bit of its practice, whether text or beyond text.
00:14:31.814 - 00:15:06.260, Speaker A: Remix is collage. Interestingly, it comes from combining elements of read only culture. Very interesting. It succeeds by leveraging the meaning created by the reference to build something new. You know, I can relate to this a lot. I mean, very rarely do I start, you know, I'm kind of marvel at artists who just decide and, you know, it's kind of one of those things I'd like to try one day. I've done it before, but very rarely do I just start building a work from nothing, right? Just from pure imagination and go like.
00:15:06.260 - 00:15:48.442, Speaker A: I almost always bring in a reference of sort of, kind of appropriation of sorts. So it's interesting. So I do relate to this statement a lot. And again, exactly. And there's kind of a rationale for it. One could argue in the sense that if you're bringing in, it's sort of like what we saw with, you know, it was strange thing at the end of, I think it was last episode or the episode before, who had the Tiberius, or however you say, the name of the river God in Rome. But we find that in Le Dejeuner Solebe and there, and we've seen Wasteman Goldminevich comment on it.
00:15:48.442 - 00:16:52.524, Speaker A: And when you become a part of that conversation, like there's something to be said, and I would argue it's actually more than remixing. It is quoting and quoting. You know, maybe there's a difference, an important distinction to be considered here between quoting and remixing. And I think they overlap, but, you know, I think what they called remixing, and maybe they still do in, say, the literary arts. It's kind of like quoting, not necessarily direct quoting, but it's a way you can do it in painting, too. And again, just like Edouard Manet is quoting that classical sculpture, and again, making, I would argue, making the work more relevant and arguably, depending on where you come from. But if the tradition is your starting point, it makes the work more meaningful, because then all of a sudden, Edouard Manet's Dejeuner Solebe is in discussion, so to speak, with all of the other, you know, representations of that sculpture, going back to that sculpture.
00:16:52.524 - 00:17:12.950, Speaker A: And it becomes a kind of classicism in this modernism, but very subtly put in. So all very interesting. Right. So I feel like we're just beginning what is a profound discussion, isn't it? As RJ said, in a second here. We'll go to that in a second. Thank you for the wonderful comment. Crash stop.
00:17:12.950 - 00:17:25.540, Speaker A: Louise Andre Gamma another awesome video. Thank you. Kuro. Thanks for showing my artwork. Looking at digital art in japanese text, it's a woman watching digital art on her computer in bed. Hilarious. Those are beautiful work.
00:17:25.540 - 00:17:44.736, Speaker A: A lot of beautiful work from Curo and also on X here. HJ NFt, New York City great as always. Thank you. Lucas Le Jeune. Thanks again for the feature. Regarding the programming aspect, I use a bit of scripting, but it's all done in after effects. Interestingly, I never would have guessed.
00:17:44.736 - 00:18:28.410, Speaker A: And most shapes are drawn in illustrator. Right now I'm working on a new series using AI generations from a customer SD model and animation with Adobe or with after effects. Very interesting, very complex, or at least very refined sort of process there. Thanks for sharing, Lucas. And I think it just really adds, it's really nice to hear the process because then you return to a Lucas lesion, and I think we have one in this episode again. And then, so with all this information, we re examine your work and then, like, people will re examine your work and all of a sudden it's like, oh. And then you come to a kind of a deeper understanding and arguably, appreciation of the work.
00:18:28.410 - 00:18:39.802, Speaker A: Let's continue. Thank you. Roman Dritz. Thank you for featuring my piece with Mikey Wilson. You're more than welcome. And great to have a new artist on the show there. Human boy really love remixes myself.
00:18:39.802 - 00:18:56.444, Speaker A: Need to do more of them. But always fun practice and learning experience, you know? Yeah, and this was coming up too. It's just a way of starting somewhere. Thanks again for featuring my art in today's show. You're welcome. I've actually not used stable diffusion yet. Maybe the textures you're referring to are added in gimp.
00:18:56.444 - 00:19:21.438, Speaker A: And maybe that is the case because I have never used. I haven't put it this way. I used gimp for an afternoon and found it kind of hard to use. That was about probably eight years ago, though, so it's probably. I have a feeling it's a little easier and just kind of better right now because a lot of people use it and I didn't remember it. I felt like when I used to try and use it, it felt like a difficult photoshop. Like a photoshop, but hard to say.
00:19:21.438 - 00:19:45.372, Speaker A: So all to say, thanks for the extra info in there and good to know. And so not stable diffusion ain't nothing. This is relaxing somehow. I can't wait for you to discover my art, sir. Did I bring you like, I think I may have found, hopefully it wasn't in one of the bookmarks. If it is, then it'll probably be on Monday. I may have taken a look, but actually I think that was someone who emailed.
00:19:45.372 - 00:20:12.434, Speaker A: Someone emailed me, and I'm not going to say who, but who's in this show, who's just like, just giving it a long shot here, and then emailed my website and then sent me their link to their work. And I think they had like one work, so I'll leave it a secret who that was, but I was like, ah, that's pretty cool. So I put it in the show. Anyways, let's continue here. Thanks. I'm taking note and I, yeah, I'm trying to keep tabs as much as I can, but it's challenging, let me tell you. But thanks for the comment.
00:20:12.434 - 00:20:30.294, Speaker A: Ray case, Lucas Lejeune, Beck and Tez friends. Great to hear from you, RJ. Super interesting episode today. Love the discussion around remixing, which had the ETH for the Dan control piece. What a banger. And thank you also for sharing the latest pieces. And this is hard.
00:20:30.294 - 00:21:23.094, Speaker A: Like, we talk about accessibility, I would argue this is quite a difficult piece to a certain degree, even from within the scene. Like, again, you didn't see the tweets get a ton of traction because maybe half the people, if not three quarters of the people, don't even recognize the reference. And then if you don't know the reference, then how are you going to really understand the work, right? But all of a sudden, once you realize, oh, this is a remix of Blue Monday, and then Dan is remixing this remix after he saw, you know. So to a certain degree, you want the art to speak for itself, but this didn't require you could actually theoretically put this all together if you had all your references in your head. So, yeah, all to say, brilliant work from Dan. And thanks for the comment, RJ. And interesting to hear you as well, thinking this is pretty exciting work.
00:21:23.094 - 00:21:47.022, Speaker A: Yeah. So all to say, because again, it wasn't like super celebrated out there. So Dan controlled. And this came out, actually, before the show was put out. This came out the morning after I recorded, but before I posted, then I saw this tweet from Dan Control. Finally, someone who criticized me and goes against me. So someone made a comment on Dan's work.
00:21:47.022 - 00:22:18.812, Speaker A: I am a remixer, not an illustrator, an artist, not an inventor or craftsman. Dig deep, never take it for granted. Art should make you think and reason, not simply admire and hang in your home. I copy and do it very well. So, of course, for those that aren't aware, this is a Dan control work that we started the show with last episode. And then here, a whole bunch of work that Dan Control has appropriated from. I would need many complaints and complaints and complaints.
00:22:18.812 - 00:22:42.342, Speaker A: Duchamp, Picasso, McDonald's, Mickey Mouse. On and on it goes. So, yeah, so just very interesting comment from Dan control there, doubling down on a remixer. Julie W. Design. So this is some AI account, I think, or just maybe this is someone from the scene, actually, I'm not sure. Julie W.
00:22:42.342 - 00:23:21.194, Speaker A: Design, OpenAI's newest text to video model Sora, might actually win me back. So this is pretty impressive. So OpenAI, of course, now that's chat. GPT right? So it looks like OpenAI because, you know, because mid journey, that's interesting, because this is incredible. Look, the cam prompt, the camera rotates around a large stack of vintage televisions, all showing different programs, 1950s Sci-Fi movies, horror movies, news static, a 1970 sitcom, etcetera. And this is what the AI developed. And again, you can see maybe up here, just a touch of AI.
00:23:21.194 - 00:24:12.034, Speaker A: Now, what's interesting about this is, first, how complex it is in like, in what it's giving you. Like the fact this is a pretty hard thing to do. This person, though, Henry here reminds me of this artwork in DC and links to this Namjoon Paek work, I believe, a korean artist and who used a lot of tvs. If you go to a lot of, you know, modern museums, you'll see this artist, kind of the first, I think one of the earlier, you might say, conceptual artists using tvs and this sort of thing, you know, kind of more installation esque, shall we say. And you do see this, and you do go, oh, maybe, maybe there is a structural similarity here. And maybe that was the source. It does remind you of that.
00:24:12.034 - 00:25:06.136, Speaker A: So just kind of interesting, but impressive and worth noting here, Robnis V three, just a market, kind of. So Opensea is a market. Of course, as most of us know, Opensea is going to be a barren wasteland this next cycle, if not already. Pretty interesting comment here, because, of course, Opensea was the main marketplace in the 2021 bull market, historic bull market there. And it's starting to. You know what I think the biggest threat to Opensea is magic Eden, which is another marketplace because of the ordinals. Like magic Eden, they started, I think, with Solana, and they're multi chain, and they just kind of, to a certain degree, they own the ordinal marketplace space because they adopted it early and they seem pretty committed to it.
00:25:06.136 - 00:25:24.244, Speaker A: I don't know what Opensea is doing. Like, they had all that vc money. Why didn't they do ordinals? They could. Yeah. So all to say, interesting comment from Robnis v three, gogolitis. I'm seriously considering turning this into a real playable game. Just whip up a small level like this one to see what I've got, what it.
00:25:24.244 - 00:26:06.660, Speaker A: To see if I've got what it takes. So this is, of course, a go go Litis pixel artwork. And you see the little kitties here. And I think that's a wonderful idea. If it's not like a crazy, insane amount of work, how cool would that be? And it kind of speaks, you know, to this. It's kind of coming full circle because a lot of the aesthetic, what I often call the second generation of digital art here, the way I loosely define it, is people that grew up with video games. So they kind of grew up with a certain kind of digital pixelated landscape, you know, visual landscapes, for lack of better term, or uis and everything.
00:26:06.660 - 00:26:43.734, Speaker A: And so, you know, just through nostalgia and experience and just growing up, cultural expert experience, there's kind of an aesthetic there that you see works like this that are highly collected by people as well who kind of grew up with that or who appreciate that. So, yeah, so interesting now to turn this art into a video game. Very, very interesting. Interesting developments, I'd say. We talked about a soft market the last six weeks. I think it's kind of starting to unsoften. Amazingly, the resilience of this market is amazing.
00:26:43.734 - 00:27:12.788, Speaker A: Now, this doesn't speak directly to that, but we'll get to others that will. But look at this strange thing, blown away by the incredible support from legends in the music world lately. From Milli Vanilli to the game Bugsy Malone. And now Adam. Adam Lambert here. It's surreal. So strange thing continues, you know, because of course, strange thing is out of this kind of blockchain art scene, you know, renowned AI artist.
00:27:12.788 - 00:27:42.710, Speaker A: So how interesting for strange thing starting to get serious follows here from some pretty, you know, influential musicians and artists here about my. And this is. I woke up in the middle of the night thinking a poor strange thing and his COVID. After my bout with COVID these moments feel even more precious. Truly grateful for this journey and share it with you all. So again, huge shout out to strange thing. Get well soon, and congratulations on the follows there.
00:27:42.710 - 00:27:58.460, Speaker A: Now let's look at the market again. Evidence that the market is not that soft already. Maybe it's because bitcoin's just shot past 50 grand and people are feeling rich again. Let's see. And that is all she wrote. This is Tess vending machine. We are sold out.
00:27:58.460 - 00:28:17.044, Speaker A: Do you believe it? Michael Macasso and Tess vending machine. Tez art community truly is the greatest force. People might not know yet, but events like this will bring awareness and big time, y'all, rock. And here is the tes vending machine. And the idea is you put in a couple of. Maybe you put in some tezos and you get work out. Not cheap.
00:28:17.044 - 00:28:46.106, Speaker A: Well, 33 tezos, but you're getting Michael Macassos oftentimes, I think, is how it works. Or there's a whole bunch of Michael Macassos in there and you can resell those for much more than that. Retro Manny speechless. One of my favorite Og pieces from 22 artificial dreams just sold for 100 tazos. Big love to tuna Kuna for scooping this up on secondary. So another big sale here. From reference from Retro Manny, here's cider traveling salesman problem.
00:28:46.106 - 00:29:10.834, Speaker A: This sold for six ETH, $1,691. Not the sense of a soft market, is it? And we saw that last episode where works were selling out. It's heating up again, astonishingly. I mean, the bear market in this scene is like six weeks. Hilarious cider testing out a few prints. So this is also cider. And I wasn't sure what cider meant first bought.
00:29:10.834 - 00:29:33.864, Speaker A: I don't know if making light or if it actually is a bot. All to say someone spent 0.6 ETH testing out a few prints. Here's cider. So this is interesting, too. A very challenging situation for cider, I would argue, which is how to make these works physical because they're very textured. Maybe this is the best way to do them.
00:29:33.864 - 00:29:54.232, Speaker A: They look like likely inkjet, but not exactly sure. You have all these gradients. They are, in a sense, somewhat photographic in their detail. So likely inkjet is the way. But this is the kind of. Yeah, I wrestled with this. These kinds of problems for years.
00:29:54.232 - 00:30:06.320, Speaker A: And you may have to. Yeah. Like, just keep on coming back to this and coming back. It looks pretty good. It looks pretty good. One wonders the different ways. It's pretty tricky with all these colors.
00:30:06.320 - 00:30:59.644, Speaker A: I think inkjet probably is your thing, but then I guess this is what I'm getting to here. Then all of a sudden, things like the kind of paper that you're printing on become of paramount importance. Right. Because ultimately, I would argue, just as with the digital work, but with the physical work you're trying to create, I would argue a sense of preciousness of the work. It has to, you know, it's why you see, like, if you see warhol screen prints, often they're on torn paper and really nice paper. Maybe you'll see a little stamp on them, like embossed, embossing stamp, all those little details, signing it really nice with, like, the perfect, you know, lightness of pencil or darkness of pencil, all of those things start to come in. I would argue, in creating the sense of value of this work and that this isn't simply just, you know, pressing print.
00:30:59.644 - 00:31:26.874, Speaker A: This is something special. Precious. This is precious. So that is, I would say the challenge for cider is how precious can you make these works feel? So very cool to see and very cool to see you working. What I learned from these, my prints need to be bigger, right? Like, this is. And, you know, nothing beats experience, right? I got so much more details to show. Like, nothing beats experience.
00:31:26.874 - 00:31:48.042, Speaker A: This is a scientific laboratory, you know, like, so cider has opened up the laboratory, okay. Of the. On the printing side of things. So just super cool. Congratulations for doing that. I'm sure you've done it before, but, you know, big applause from over here for doing that. Here's Santiago ruau, late GM.
00:31:48.042 - 00:32:06.866, Speaker A: So look at how good this looks. We've seen. We may have even seen this piece. Look at how slick this looks on some very nice. You can see it's almost like shiny paper. So again, and looking like professional printers here at work. So just very interesting there from Santiago Rou, more interesting physicals.
00:32:06.866 - 00:32:47.602, Speaker A: And I thought this was hilarious, this kind of, you know what I almost consider a famous work in this scene, this instantly famous bear that nobody can forget once you see it with a stretched neck, the digitally stretched neck this wonderful work here, which if you haven't seen this, I go into detail. It starts a show, so it's easy to find on YouTube. So interesting to see a physical version here from Martin Bruce of this wonderful, wonderful work. Interesting work here. This is Luciana Yovain, I think also Luciana guerra. And this is called runes. So I believe this is her first mint on Zora.
00:32:47.602 - 00:33:07.864, Speaker A: So interesting kind of physical kind of photography with a. Looks like a physical work hanging, being stretched out in the window here. So very interesting. Beginning here. Painting and ruins in Buenos Aires with beautiful sun there. I am envious of the sun there. Emerged.
00:33:07.864 - 00:33:33.284, Speaker A: So getting started on Zora. Very cool. And look at this. This is Cwampa. Little work in progress. So a little clue and let's see if we can make this bigger little clue here of how Cuampa makes these epic works of art. Starting with what looks like a one pixel, you know, pen or pencil or brush.
00:33:33.284 - 00:33:53.230, Speaker A: When it's one pixel, it doesn't matter. And creating all the outlines. So very interesting. Hopefully we get other updates too, so we can kind of watch this develop already 16 megabytes, hilariously with two colors. So, uh, you see all the work that is in Aquapa. And I thought this was great too. Retro.
00:33:53.230 - 00:34:07.598, Speaker A: Retro. Manny, handmade birthday card for my wonderful daughter's birthday today. So happy birthday to Manny's daughter. And what a beautiful card here. So thought I would put it here with the physicals here. So happy birthday, daddy. Ah, hilarious.
00:34:07.598 - 00:34:35.894, Speaker A: Okay, now, maybe I shouldn't have juxtaposed this work here. Here's a pretty sobering work here from die with the most likes. And I believe Xerox, I think a collab here. And maybe Louis Ponce. So three way work here. And this is, I believe, an edition of 34. Yeah, you can see the Louis ponce here in this kind of rotating in the circle here, this kind of design here.
00:34:35.894 - 00:35:08.824, Speaker A: Maybe down here as well. And you see the die with the most likes here in the outlines. I wonder if Xerox is in the textures here and maybe a bit of the background there. Pretty cool collab. Pretty, you know, as you can see here with these drones dragging these figures across. A very dark work here. And here you see figures and like, almost like the skin or a swine being, you know, gutted here with this figure with a mask.
00:35:08.824 - 00:35:23.848, Speaker A: So all to say, very edgy work. Interesting color. Very interesting color. The rise and fall number 34. And so there, I think there are 35. There are 35 nfts. So selling out, as far as I understand.
00:35:23.848 - 00:35:43.988, Speaker A: And now is six, selling out at 0.311. So a third of an ETH. So bringing in, I think, ten ETH, is that right? 30 times 0.3. That sounds about right, yeah. Ten ETH, which is these days, like $28,000. Not bad. This could have also started the show here.
00:35:43.988 - 00:36:19.932, Speaker A: This beautiful Ed Marolla, the first tego dago I've seen part of this. They are dreaming us series, multi chain series here. And look at how awesome this structure is. And whatever is going on here, even incorporating what looks like a bit of glitch, you know, styling, so to speak, with this kind of, as you see the image move there, there's the. They are dreaming us. And this beautiful border, which may have influenced a project I'm working on, these kind of. I put a border on a pixel artwork, and I thought I was like, this feels like Ed Morolla.
00:36:19.932 - 00:36:43.994, Speaker A: And I thought, you know, I wonder if that's an Ed Marolla influence. Anyways, look here. Almost like a lily pad type situation there. A leaf, and so all sorts of juxtapositions. And this figure with kind of like a cross and an ancient vase. So just a beautiful, beautiful piece, is it not? Two tezos edition of 100. So just very, very cool here.
00:36:43.994 - 00:37:00.474, Speaker A: And. Yeah, so you can read the write up there. Yeah. So how many are left here? There are 60 left. So it's selling pretty well, actually. Already 39 gone, as far as I understand. This also could have started the show.
00:37:00.474 - 00:37:53.614, Speaker A: Remember we saw the lawnmower that Hasdrubal waffle did? And I mean, people like, this is where this show probably gets inaccessible, right? Because people just go. Because the first time I saw Hasdrubal waffles work, I was sort of like, well, these are kind of like kids drawings. Like, what's the deal here? But when you kind of get to learn deeper and understand here what's going on, I would argue there's kind of a. On one level, and it's not just conceptual, it's like you start to appreciate the aesthetics, but a kind of digital expressionism, shall we call it, you know, where it's just kind of not having to be too perfect, you know, in terms of, you know, you see all this roughness and people that might not. That might not be familiar with our scene. This is kind of your classic example of them going like, what are you talking about? Right? And meanwhile, I'm saying, oh, this could have started the show. And I came probably this close.
00:37:53.614 - 00:38:44.254, Speaker A: I went with the international year of the dragon, you know, but this could you know, and not only that, so there's the beautiful kind of rendering here, again, using kid softwares or softwares found online also, you know, weird stuff that hysteruba waffle will find on eBay. So not only is there kind of what, you know, takes a bit to understand this aesthetic here and what's going on, but once you do, then you go, then you start to love it. And it's actually kind of back to what I call the second generation of digital art. Rightly or wrongly, that's just what I call it for now, until kind of strongly corrected in terms, and then I'll change. But I still kind of see it that way. You see the kind of a video game esque aesthetic here. But you know what else I love about this and why it would have started.
00:38:44.254 - 00:39:26.310, Speaker A: It could have started in my mind, and why I was very tempted to. This, to me, was kind of a metaphor for the entire scene. This is like, it's done in this kind of video gamey, kind of, you know, expressionist way, but what is it? It's like a figure skater who has done this, you know, acrobatic act, you know, in digital form here on. And then here we see, like, the lawnmower work did it again. Remember the lawn mower work where it's got a digital texture? Maybe we can very quickly bring that up. The lawn mower work where there's a digital texture here, this work here, which reminded me again of that. Caillebotte the floor scrapers.
00:39:26.310 - 00:39:58.898, Speaker A: Right? And here, this is brilliant. Again, this totally, you know, and accidental or not, who cares? This is brilliant. Where the digital textures are being mowed down here, and you see the pixels flying out. You could argue this is a similar. Like, what a perfect duet these would make in the gallery in your mind, right? Like, I can't remember who picked this up? Someone Uri J for 0.05. And then this one was picked up by Daedalus Zeus. I mean, you could put these in the same room, because they're kind of saying some.
00:39:58.898 - 00:40:31.714, Speaker A: All of a sudden, you see this texture that's being formed here with this ice skate, and then it creates this different kind of digital texture here. Kind of a similar thing going on here. And almost like, this line is the skate, like, being dragged by the artist here. This pixel brush is also, you know, the skate here. And this is the artist, you know, like, that's what I see. The artist has done this acrobatic act and is like, ta da, right? And so just brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. And even the line itself, you know.
00:40:31.714 - 00:40:49.950, Speaker A: And so just. What's it called? Swole capades. Only four megabytes. 2600 by 1648 png. So the brilliant, brilliant hasdrubal waffle added again. And that is sold. The Internet is our frontier now.
00:40:49.950 - 00:41:26.474, Speaker A: So a new one by RJ. So, of course, Caspar David Friedrich's del Vandereur. A famous massive artwork, you know, probably the symbol, really, of romantic painting at the end of the day here. Gets the pastiche treatment here in this beautiful kind of retro monitor. Green and black from RJ here. And then a little bit of noise, some colorful noise here to fill in the outlines here, or the gaps, so to speak, or to fill things in to give it kind of a special look. A beautiful contrast and everything.
00:41:26.474 - 00:41:45.542, Speaker A: This is a one of one went to Flexosaurus rex. Maybe a private sale or just sending it after wanderer above the sea of fog. Very interesting. Here's another one that was posted on x. I'm not sure if this was minted or if we looked at this. I don't think we did. Of course, Vermeer here, the.
00:41:45.542 - 00:42:05.174, Speaker A: What is it called? The milk, the something pours or something like that. Of course, we all know this painting here. So another cool one, turning the milk, adding a little bit of noise there. Visual noise. And then we got this Picasso, Guernica. The Internet is also a war zone. And kind of interesting focus on the Internet here.
00:42:05.174 - 00:42:30.526, Speaker A: And kind of changing up this snowy movement here. Adding a sense of foreboding with the red. And again, doing a cool pastiche here. Kind of a simple pastiche, but effective pastiche in this green and black. You know what it looks like to me, this series, it looks like it was created. And this is how so many series start. Particularly for me.
00:42:30.526 - 00:43:00.082, Speaker A: Like, this is why I assumed this is. This was probably RJ's putting out the outlines as we were seeing, with almost Cuompa putting out the outlines to make the work. And probably he was doing it in green, or maybe a variation of the green, and just looked at it and said, you know what? I think I like this. And then adding the noise, the static here, the movement here, and then going, oh, I have a new series. I have a new way of doing it. And boom, boom, boom. Don't even need to color stuff in.
00:43:00.082 - 00:43:17.126, Speaker A: And it's just as effective. It's almost back as our raw. Back to our raw discussion here. You know, kind of a variation on the non finito. This is like not the full pastiche. It's just a hint towards the pastiche. It's a step of the pastiche, but you could obviously take it further.
00:43:17.126 - 00:43:32.202, Speaker A: But is it poetic? More poetic leaving it half finish. Finally getting some light in here. And so 35 tezos at auction. So nice sale there. Tezos above a dollar. Look at this splash screen. Cool title.
00:43:32.202 - 00:43:40.570, Speaker A: David Hockney. This is also RJ. Great sales here. 30 tezos each. Not cheap. Edition of five. And selling out.
00:43:40.570 - 00:44:02.882, Speaker A: Uri J, picking up two of them, so loving them. Let's take a closer look. And I think this may be. Was this a Valentine's Day? No, after David Hockney's Peter getting out of Nick's pool, 1966. And of course, a lot of us are familiar with this wave here at the water. And there's a computer looking on, splashing. You almost see a screensaver of the splash there.
00:44:02.882 - 00:44:34.930, Speaker A: Brilliantly done. Just an awesome, awesome piece. Again, the market, like 30 tezos, edition of five, you know, sold out, you know, looking like probably pretty fast market, you know, crypto maybe with crypto coming back, this market is starting to feel strong again here is death of zero. So this was finally minted by rare. This was just put on foundation, reserve of one ETH. And again we see this. I think it's death of Murat.
00:44:34.930 - 00:45:13.036, Speaker A: And this is hilarious here. Now we can see it looks like a seed phrase of the. So, of course, the seed phrase being the code that you need for crypto to access your digital wallet for those that might not know. And there you see even a little signature of rare. And then Tesla robot. So, digital painting, pastiche based on Jacques Louis David's 1793 masterpiece, the death of Murat, with revolutionary martyr Jean Paul Marat, replaced by Tesla's Optimus, two human eyed robot. The narrative, by replacing the Marat with the robot, the narrative has shifted from the french revolution to the robotic AI revolution.
00:45:13.036 - 00:45:42.052, Speaker A: We're all on the cusp of very cool, very sophisticated. And I actually brought it up big just so we could see a particularly detailed pastiche here, having that beautiful kind of oil paint kind of look here. And this is hilarious. It's even a little bit of blood and there's a little pepe snuck in there. And so very cool from rare. So that's on foundation. This is also on foundation.
00:45:42.052 - 00:45:59.292, Speaker A: Matthias. Matthias Murano, the freedom. And I believe this was just minted. It was stirring emotions. And so we saw some work by Matthias on object recently. So here's another one. And always kind of with a bit of a mythological feel to it.
00:45:59.292 - 00:46:22.940, Speaker A: Definitely has his own style here and interesting kind of tattoos all over these two bodies. Here as well as these cupid figures here. Just interesting. And a few, you know, bitcoin kind of coins here flying through here. A nod to the crypto art scene. Very interesting piece, interesting title. This is chapter three and this is going for 0.7
00:46:22.940 - 00:46:44.764, Speaker A: ETH. And this is also in this space world showcase. So I think those are in the same show, if I'm not mistaken. Shall we be blinded from the sun today? This hasn't happened since my last apartment. For longtime viewers, you may remember that maybe it's good lighting. Finally. And a harbinger maybe of summer here.
00:46:44.764 - 00:47:14.730, Speaker A: Let's continue here. Jan Luke es Magone. We have another interesting work here on a bull with these skeletons here. The bull getting a different kind of treatment than the skeletons. The skeletons, of course, more painterly here with these beautiful brush marks here. And here we see the bow and arrows here of this person. Oh, it kind of has a mythological feel to it, doesn't it? Kind of reminds me of a futurist work actually, to a certain degree by, I want to say, Umberto boccione.
00:47:14.730 - 00:47:40.714, Speaker A: Let's just take a very quick look here. Paintings. Very quick look kind of like. Was it this one, maybe? Kind of like that one. Kind of remind. Maybe it was this one that I was thinking of. And here's kind of like this one, but pretty different, actually.
00:47:40.714 - 00:48:00.450, Speaker A: Kind of had this feeling though, didn't it? Doesn't it? The city rises. Interesting political painting there. So pretty different in the end there. Interesting halo. And this is LFG Archer. That is hilarious. So Jan Luke es Magoan and also has it on the website there.
00:48:00.450 - 00:48:43.106, Speaker A: 5000 by 5000 edition of 30 and selling out at eleven tazos. So what bear market. We're back to what bear market? What softness in the market? The existential threat posed by novel technology. This is quite interesting. To sum it up here. Weisman Goldman was in a waiting room and found the work of this artist and saw this work in the waiting room, maybe a reproduction. And this is by an artist troublemaker in Barcelona in the 1890s which he was ostracized from the art world and painted odd portrait for members of the provincial bourgeoisie to make his way.
00:48:43.106 - 00:49:08.438, Speaker A: He was alcoholic and homeless and he was forgotten until his reappraisal in the 1960s which resulted in a posthumously granted reputation as a visionary. His work is now worth a fortune. So pretty interesting. So painted this from memory. Interestingly. Pretty cool work. We're kind of back to this remix idea, isn't it? Aren't we? So again, this kind of upside down phone hilariously.
00:49:08.438 - 00:49:31.350, Speaker A: And the cigar, one imagines that the cigar is perhaps, just perhaps, a wasteman gold minevich addition there. And there's a little mouse, very cool to paint from memory like that. Beautiful work. And so this is three tezos. There are four gone, edition of eleven. And here is axine limited edition of 33. Here, a Valentine's work here.
00:49:31.350 - 00:50:01.806, Speaker A: Is it called hype? H y P E. So hype, just like, you know, kind of a, you know, kind of a mixed kind of message, one could say, of Valentine's Day. And the valentine rose here with thorns on it and a skull on top. And hype put in the corners there. A very cool work from uxine. And that is on a manifold, if I am not mistaken. Yes, that is on manifold.
00:50:01.806 - 00:50:29.210, Speaker A: XYZ. Here's another work point of view. Of course, I follow axine. That is x. Big glitch in x is why it says that big egalitarian government exploits third world countries while you're leaving your nine to five job in your electric cart and sipping your oat milk latte with a paper straw. So, interestingly, of course, Aksin out of Turkey. So, you know, it's interesting, these tools here.
00:50:29.210 - 00:51:19.248, Speaker A: Someone was making a comment, and I think it was in the bookmarks that weren't loading up for me after I simply loaded up too many Twitter pages this morning. But someone was mentioning how hen was kind of the revolution of the global, kind of an art revolution of the global south. And I thought that was kind of a poignant, interesting take on that. And that a lot of these blockchain artists, especially, one could argue on tezos because of the low minting fees are coming out of, you know, what is often called the global south, you know, and in other words, which is kind of often in distinction to the west, you know, so very interesting work here. So just posted on Twitter. And so here, point of view. So a little bit of commentary here and beautifully painted here by.
00:51:19.248 - 00:51:33.952, Speaker A: And adding, keeping, adding in a few more colors here from oxine. And there's a happy face on the latte. So a visual representation of some commentary. Coquette. This is bizaya. Three a, five a, one a. Also known as bazaya.
00:51:33.952 - 00:51:55.834, Speaker A: And this is on Zora. So cool here. This was minted when probably, probably recently, maybe a day ago. And here's just a new work here with this figure here. It's the apple vision pro in a pool. So just a cool, fun, bizarre work out of Argentina. Right? So there's something to be said here.
00:51:55.834 - 00:52:12.872, Speaker A: I mean, where is detaste from. I think detaste maybe is from Latin America as well, if I'm not mistaken. Not everyone that shines is God or lux perpetua. So, interesting. I don't have Latin. There is a thief on that cross. Okay, so here a little poem.
00:52:12.872 - 00:52:35.764, Speaker A: This is an edition of one for 25 tezos. Let's take a closer look. Kind of a roman statue here with a little cross and some candles. Interesting floor. And then here we see a figure with a lacrosse, white lacrosse sweater. And kind of all the eye is black, interestingly. And then a little bit of a nod to Jeff Koons here.
00:52:35.764 - 00:53:06.170, Speaker A: Right. So, you know, just more evidence for. Just interesting commentary here of. And again, more evidence for the sophistication of this scene here and how there may be going. More going on here than might be realized from the outside, from outside of this world here. Interesting landscape here, done almost in a renaissance type style where it starts to get kind of hazy in the background, interestingly. So that's a one of one for 25 tezos.
00:53:06.170 - 00:53:32.004, Speaker A: Couple of interesting works by sum. Against all odds, so soon going back. This almost has a bit of a de kooning type feel to it, doesn't it? So looking like me, you know. So playing around almost looking like a de Kooning type woman. Type figure here. Look quickly here. I haven't looked at de Kooning woman.
00:53:32.004 - 00:53:52.618, Speaker A: I mean, pretty vaguely, not too close, but almost, you know. And you see it in the mark making here. Almost a touch of Picasso. And it's kind of blockiness, you might say, here as well. Anyways, beautifully painted by zoom here against all odds. And this was burned, but there may be a newer version. Let's just take a closer look here.
00:53:52.618 - 00:54:14.694, Speaker A: But really nice piece. Nice kind of pencil work over top of the color and everything. Like, look at how textured this is, right? Like, look at how, just frankly, how painterly and beautiful this is. Very like beautiful work here. So against all odds. Cool title. And, yeah, that was just burnt and never reminted.
00:54:14.694 - 00:54:27.788, Speaker A: We have a new one here, the king. This is three tezos. So interesting. Very painterly, looser style here. Very cool. I think it looks great. And this is called the king.
00:54:27.788 - 00:54:42.504, Speaker A: This is edition of ten for three tezos each. And here's another one called high. And this is an edition of ten. And these you have almost sold out. It is sold out. So nice work there. Again, very painterly.
00:54:42.504 - 00:55:15.282, Speaker A: Again you see these kind of almost like pencil or graphite or colored pencils or, you know, wax crayon or something over top of the painting. Almost has a bit of a multimedia feel in the different digital textures here. Again, wonderfully painterly here. Isn't it beautiful? So very interesting work here, isn't it? Continuing on, Zisus blietkis. We haven't seen new work. At least I haven't seen new work from Zsys for a long time. Airplanetary lux system.
00:55:15.282 - 00:55:37.106, Speaker A: Very interesting artist edition of 20 for ten tezos. I feel like it's been, like, six months since we've seen work from Zsus. Maybe I just missed it. Very experimental. Interesting artist here. Kind of one of the more earlier experimental artists that I would show on this show. I think I showed it, like, once or twice.
00:55:37.106 - 00:56:08.998, Speaker A: Zsus's work. Look at this. And we have this great zoom tool, thanks to object, and even this figure, this cat in the ground, and these great plants. You see all of the work and all of the experimentation, and then you see this rendering here of the grass and then painted over top. Interestingly, it's like you get this kind of retro rendering of the grass and then painting over top of that. Pretty interesting work. Even a touch of collage kind of feel to this landscape here.
00:56:08.998 - 00:56:25.022, Speaker A: And looking like a laser or something coming down. Airplanetary lux system. Interesting. Microsoft paint, which is a whole other thing. Again, for those that might not be familiar, it's almost like a whole genre to a certain degree. Paintings made with Ms paint. I wonder.
00:56:25.022 - 00:56:39.406, Speaker A: I don't think I brought up the crayon. Someone was using crayon. Working class. Shall we look really close quickly here. I'm not sure if it's. It may already be in the feed here. I was looking at it here.
00:56:39.406 - 00:56:55.798, Speaker A: Let me just. Very quickly, if we can find it. Otherwise, I'll try and bring it for next show here. Yeah. Where is working class? Last shot here. Here it is. Okay, we found it.
00:56:55.798 - 00:57:20.884, Speaker A: Look at this. Ms paint with crayon. Okay. I thought this was quite an interesting experiment here. So playing with Microsoft paint crayon, and actually putting out a work here. So pretty cool experimentation here with these tools here, because the easy thing to do would just be. And look at this wild trumpet blowing out blood.
00:57:20.884 - 00:57:34.154, Speaker A: I think Dali would approve of that. Very cool. I'm falling in love. Darn. And there, the tears of the lover there. Hilarious. So blood.
00:57:34.154 - 00:57:50.386, Speaker A: Love the rock. This is an edition of one for 140 tezos, again using Microsoft crayon, Ms Paint. Crayon. Very interesting. Here's another brilliant work. And we're back to the year of the dragon here. Also could have started this show, right.
00:57:50.386 - 00:58:16.604, Speaker A: Marcelo Pinel, blessing of a new dawn. And this is on, interestingly, this is on Solana. So exchange art. I mean, look at that. So surely, even if you're from outside of the scene, this is something that can be appreciated here, this beautiful work here by Marcelo Pinel, with these great fireworks and everything. So chinese new year here. Blessings of a new dawn.
00:58:16.604 - 00:58:37.184, Speaker A: This is a reserve of ten solutions. And so we'll see how it does. I wonder if it's on the homepage, because I could see this ending up on the homepage, let's put it that way. Maybe it already was. So very interesting. Here's actually some progress shots from Marcelo Pinel on Instagram. So again, we see the outline.
00:58:37.184 - 00:59:09.486, Speaker A: We saw that with Cuompa. We've seen that with RJ's pastiches. And we've actually seen that with rare in previous episodes, where, you know, the beginning of the pastiche is this kind of almost a bright green line, I believe that rare was also using. And then you see just the progress shots here, not animated here. And then adding more volume, shading, interesting black and white version, all mintable. And then there's the final work there on Instagram. So very cool there from Marcelo Pinel.
00:59:09.486 - 00:59:34.064, Speaker A: So that's on exchange art. This is, this is, of course, demon ego, also part of the stirring emotion show. So I'll have to take a look at this stirring emotion show on foundation. Where to put this love, how to fill this gap. I mean, it's pretty incredible. Again, the amount of work that is coming out here every, you know, 48 hours, it's like, it's. It's hard to keep up with.
00:59:34.064 - 01:00:03.690, Speaker A: And so here's demon ego again, combining digital and physical. Here we see notepad, a little bit of drop shadow there, and then all sorts of stuff. And then just something still in the middle here and on the side. And interesting kind of colors on the border here. Just interesting work. Here's a almost tempting to see self portrait of sorts, because, of course, demon ego often works with these notebooks here, seemingly. And so this is 0.25
01:00:03.690 - 01:00:23.262, Speaker A: reserve, and this is minted on Valentine's Day. And there is a poem there, too. Let's continue. This is Vinnie Hager nebulous electronic ether post collection claim. So, not sure, but cool kind of has a cool. Again, that's kind of sketchbook look. It's not exactly a space here.
01:00:23.262 - 01:00:52.254, Speaker A: It's more a juxtaposition, almost like closer to what I sometimes call the doodle style that we see with Basquiat or Keith Haring. Right where it's like the traditional space of a work. The narrative space, one might say, is kind of. It's. It's flattened out. It's now about just like the two dimensional piece of paper and juxtaposing things and not worrying about it working in space, so to speak. This seems to be what we see here anyway.
01:00:52.254 - 01:01:12.254, Speaker A: Cool work. Interesting background too going from orange to pink and all sorts of iconography on top. Very interesting. Here's NUV 1914 casita on el arbol de Narania. I think this is a one of one. This has this sold history, maybe just minted it. Sold to illusional for nine tezos.
01:01:12.254 - 01:02:08.254, Speaker A: So let's take a closer look here. Again, very. This is like. And for those that maybe are outside of this scene this is hard for people in the scene to understand but once you do you really start to appreciate this work here so seemingly like a treehouse, right? And then some wild, you know, part of it is if you see thousands and thousands and thousands of digital images which many of us do in this scene then all of a sudden something that's just breaking convention trying out different ways of working that are completely different can be really appealing and a source of interest and even aesthetic pleasure here as we see with a lot of Neve 19 fourteen's works and this sheer unpredictability of it. You know, you see these kind of wild gradients here, all sorts of things here. So cool work. Selling for another nine Tazos Nuff 1914.
01:02:08.254 - 01:02:34.664, Speaker A: Continuing with the daily sales here. Here's an artist macro G Mitrai. If I am pronouncing that right, this is from. This is a one bit work and as we see here, a seahorse. And let me just bring it up a little bigger here. This is on foundation and this is a reserve of 0.28 and as you see here, black and white and just constructed of all these tiny little elements here which is interesting.
01:02:34.664 - 01:02:55.444, Speaker A: Particularly love at the end there where it's almost just these digital elements. Very nice. So just interesting work here from an artist we haven't seen before. Macro g matry. So that's on foundation. So cool work there. And here's Lord, who I haven't seen for a while.
01:02:55.444 - 01:03:32.904, Speaker A: Lord Neutron. So here, this is a one of one. This was minted on Valentine's Day and of course, Lord always has these, you know, again, another, I'd argue fairly difficult artist but always has these kind of metaphysical feeling works here. And we see, you know, the skeleton turning into almost like a nervous system here turning into the full body cgi rendering, so to speak. And here, just an interesting kind of surreal space here with a tree at the bottom. What is the title on this work? The spiral of life. So again, always kind of metaphysical here by Lord Neutron.
01:03:32.904 - 01:03:52.870, Speaker A: Very interesting. Unique artists there. Here's Ezra Eslin. Another work again that shouted front cover, right? Maybe I should have started with this. The monster Ezra Eslin reserve of 0.88. Again, part of this space world showcase, stirring emotions. I quite like this.
01:03:52.870 - 01:04:20.832, Speaker A: I found this a powerful work. You know, someone who's basically not feeling too happy, you know, the monster here and then just kind of crouching within this larger city or society there that is half on fire and ghosts everywhere. And the wounds here, really nice, powerful Ezra Eslin piece. The monster. Let's destroy that monster. Interesting. Cool work there.
01:04:20.832 - 01:04:50.288, Speaker A: Here is Lewis Osborne with a very interesting piece here. Let's actually see the artist cycle. I guess it's time to put the kettle on. So here is coffee. A crucial part of my own process here. And then the person on the laptop and then checking maybe their social media, posting on social media, liking seeing other people's social media, crying and resting and then more coffee. That is hilarious.
01:04:50.288 - 01:05:00.952, Speaker A: The artist cycle. And it's all social media here. This is brilliant. This one was burned. I assumed there was another one. So. Yeah, just burned so far.
01:05:00.952 - 01:05:30.192, Speaker A: So found another one in the ether here. And here's Ouyo 66, another prominent illustrator. Mount almost has a weird sort of cinematic feel, this one, of course, illustrator here. But you see the red and the blue, it's almost got like this 3d. Almost like a glitch filter of sorts. It's almost got a 3d. Maybe this is 3d because these are the kind of colors you would use, right? This looks like 3d.
01:05:30.192 - 01:05:56.264, Speaker A: Interestingly mout the Grim Reaper. So this is edition of one and selling for 30 tezos. Very interesting. And here is an artist I hadn't seen before, Baiba Dolby. Ever fallen in love. So as we continue here, let this load up. So just interesting, kind of illustrated gif with all sorts of chaos going on and this skull that's splitting with eyeballs rolling and coffee is back.
01:05:56.264 - 01:06:10.976, Speaker A: You do a whole show on coffee. That would be fun. Maybe if I do a curated show, I'll do it on coffee. Hilarious. Okay. Ever fallen in love? So this is on exchange art, which is Solana for 0.6. Sol.
01:06:10.976 - 01:06:25.524, Speaker A: Another super interesting, super textured work by mo moe. Shit. Doc. Doc. See if we can get a bigger version of this. None minted so far, but I thought another super interesting work here. See, if we do this.
01:06:25.524 - 01:07:00.554, Speaker A: So mo putting out a ton of work, and it's paying off. It is paying off. Like, look at how interesting this is. You know, just kind of new visual experiences here, courtesy of Mo. And that's another important thing to, you know, as I was mentioning on the space yesterday, and I do like this aesthetically, by the way. But as I was saying, on the space, we don't have to love all of these works from an aesthetic point of view. That's not necessarily the point, right? Like, there does need to be some, because, of course, that's probably the main impulse, is an appreciation of beauty.
01:07:00.554 - 01:07:28.934, Speaker A: It has to be beautiful, whether it's the. The work itself or the idea, the colors there. Beauty is important, but as I always like to say, we're more than making a pretty picture here. And so, you know, works like this. It is actually working on the aesthetic level, but there's all sorts of experimentation going on here, and it's different. It's unusual. And that, again, if you're seeing thousands of images a week, that becomes really interesting.
01:07:28.934 - 01:07:42.014, Speaker A: Like, what's going on over here and why is it working? Right. So just more interesting work from mo. This was interesting, too. Very original. This is Sui. Sui chi. No room for us here.
01:07:42.014 - 01:08:14.794, Speaker A: Who, of course, did that very complex work that we saw the other day here. Another work, and again, kind of mysterious, would hang well, frankly, with element Li, who is coming up here. I never thought of that before. I was like, I sure hope I brought up element Li next. So here, of course, another experimental pixel artist. N 421. Not sure even what this is, but I know I like it, you know? So, okay, so here, kind of an architectural scene here.
01:08:14.794 - 01:08:43.740, Speaker A: Almost like a road, but repeated four times, interestingly. And look at that wild border here. So, you know, just look so interesting. So, looking, like repeating this element here four times. Here, repeating it twice. And on the first, it's almost like this is being put into. There is an app that I used to use that was actually a Facebook app, and it puts everything in squares.
01:08:43.740 - 01:09:06.124, Speaker A: I used to use it, like, years ago. What is that called? And it would do all these effects on your. It was a Facebook app. So anyways, I don't know if that's what's going on here, but it's tempting to think that these are the kinds of results and they're square results that you often get. This looks like the source image here. So just so n four, two and one. Right? So four of them.
01:09:06.124 - 01:09:31.483, Speaker A: Two of them and one. Very cool. More interesting art here. Here's Cano, who, of course, did those amazing Diego Maradona works. If you haven't seen, let me just show you very quickly here. If they load up well, while that's loading here, we have a basketball work here with some really nice stithering here. It does make you wonder what was used for this.
01:09:31.483 - 01:09:45.224, Speaker A: Beautiful. It's a kind of. Kind of a simple but beautiful gradient in the background there. You would think either aseprite or maybe something else, maybe even deluxe paint. Not sure. So anyways, changing. There's Cansino's name.
01:09:45.224 - 01:10:04.190, Speaker A: So anyways, changing the focus to basketball here, as you see. And I didn't even see some of these. Doing a ton of soccer works. And so almost like just straight up. So just. I love the topic here, the subject matter. Putting out a ton of work here.
01:10:04.190 - 01:10:28.076, Speaker A: And there were some really wonderful ones that I haven't seen so many of these updates. I'm gonna start following people on Zora, too. With all that. I'm gonna have to really. It's the editing because I actually have too many things that looks like Kalina with no hair there. Anyways, I'm nerding out here on all the soccer works here. See if any of these, like, you know, some of these older ones.
01:10:28.076 - 01:10:38.172, Speaker A: That's ASCII. So putting out a ton of work. Good to see the update here from Cansino. Yeah. And here it is. The goal of the century. A delightful work.
01:10:38.172 - 01:10:54.656, Speaker A: Only 21 minted. I hope I minted one. I really hope I minted this because I plan to. The goal of the century with that famous goal by Diego Maradona. Cano. Back doing basketball here is Chaz with Chazzer. Realm of adventures.
01:10:54.656 - 01:11:14.736, Speaker A: Eight bit adventures. So now changing the subject matter to. Is that a switch? Maybe a Nintendo switch? And so changing the interface here. One up. Few Mario references, maybe some others. Realm of adventure, Nintendo DS with the excitement of a new age quest. This is only 0.05
01:11:14.736 - 01:11:42.938, Speaker A: ETH on foundation. I guess with ETH doing so well, foundation is becoming a little more popular for the minting right now. A massive nothingness in the core. So here's Radda with a new work here. And maybe referring to the ETH rock thing, because it seems to have that shape, doesn't it? And there's a little rat and some other rats. So a new pixel artwork from RADa. Again, so many works could have started this show.
01:11:42.938 - 01:12:14.578, Speaker A: And the interesting couple of eyes right there. Or those two red dots right there. So very. Almost as if a rat is in the shadow there. So as you see here, every pixel considered by RADA here by the great rata, every pixel considered great pixel artist who got a lot of us into art on the blockchain, frankly, is. And, you know, which is interesting because. And, you know, I've shown those ads before, those older works.
01:12:14.578 - 01:12:34.314, Speaker A: I think it's like Cosmo de Medici going with the hounds through the. On the hunt with classical music that, like, as soon as I saw that, I had to own it. And that's what brought me over to object. And the Tezos blockchain was rada's work. Let's continue here. Not a number. P one and mana mandal.
01:12:34.314 - 01:12:54.754, Speaker A: So a three way combo here. Let's see what happens. Turning into a game. Little Valentine's Day game. That is hilarious, and we can actually play it. So maybe this is why. Go go lightus is like, maybe I should do a game, too.
01:12:54.754 - 01:13:09.762, Speaker A: I mean, it's a whole genre, and I don't know how to stop it. So I'm just gonna. Let's. Let's do that, hopefully. There we go. Out of control video game. Look at how cool this is, though.
01:13:09.762 - 01:13:29.893, Speaker A: So this is only 214. Two tezos on object addition of 100. I need to speed up here. We're already at an hour 13, and we have a ton to get through here. Another work by manito, also with p one doing, I believe, the music. We saw the start. Now here's the dynamic kind of finished diffuser.
01:13:29.893 - 01:14:01.224, Speaker A: So always just kind of fun and cool. Nice color scheme with the red on all the black and white, and just cats hanging out, having fun with kind of more eight bit music. Very cool. Here is Stalamir with a new work. This is on Solana. Reserve of three sahl and kind of playing with these, you know, mother of enki, you know, which sounds like Gilgamesh, enkidu. What is it called? The epic of Gilgamesh.
01:14:01.224 - 01:14:30.712, Speaker A: There's always kind of a bit of a sumerian feel to Stalamir's work here. So it's kind of ancient meets Sci-Fi in the province of pixel art, in the medium or genre of pixel art. So interesting piece here, as you see, again, kind of like ancient looking, but also Sci-Fi looking. Probably an ancient pattern there. Super interesting artist. Very full kind of work as a canvas. Just very cool.
01:14:30.712 - 01:15:04.262, Speaker A: So that's on exchange art, which is on Solana epilepsy. So pixology is back with a little bit of texture there. And let's see if we can zoom in. This is the max. We can zoom in a little bit of texture there in the pixelation, interestingly, with an eye at the center of this mandala of sorts, and interesting kind of techno eye, but also kind of, you know, has an indigenous kind of feel to it. Made on aspirite, a thousand by thousand epilepsy. I'll try to open it.
01:15:04.262 - 01:15:23.162, Speaker A: So, very interesting. And this selling out edition of 20 at three tezos each. Sold out, or, wait, not sold out. How many are left? Four left. But, you know, the market is moving here. I'm not sure if we looked at this one last time, but it related really well because we had an eye. This is brain dead.
01:15:23.162 - 01:15:45.896, Speaker A: This is braindead system v six, AI Xl. And I don't think we looked at it, actually. And here's the eye on the screen. And then you see all of the work that's going into making the eye work. Like almost all the machinery, I thought. Quite a brilliant, beautiful work. You know, this metaphor of the machinery of the eye, you know, quite beautiful.
01:15:45.896 - 01:16:09.874, Speaker A: Five tezos edition of 23 are gone. Here is my space invaders. And this is black and white edition of ten. And I think just minted. I don't know if it's been listed yet, though. It hasn't been listed yet. So interesting move to black and white here in this piece from Mayu, who often uses these kind of, like, purple and yellow colors.
01:16:09.874 - 01:16:30.214, Speaker A: Space invaders. Very cool. This one was eye catching, wasn't it? Maison. I think it's Maison III, also known as Maison Church of the Null. God. And here, just an interesting kind of one bit work here with kind of some effects going on here. A jittery work of this cool architectural castle.
01:16:30.214 - 01:16:50.096, Speaker A: Just an interesting piece that's on Zora, on secondary. Maybe this is older. This might have been on x that I found it January 15. I've never seen this before. So minted about a month ago and probably just expired, probably because usually they're mint for a month. Here's Ray case, ready for the launch of my NFT career. Minting soon.
01:16:50.096 - 01:16:59.520, Speaker A: And check these out. Cool little. What look like pixel paintings. Pixel art paintings. Quite beautiful. Ray K's. I am ready.
01:16:59.520 - 01:17:23.052, Speaker A: Very ready. This is beautiful. Kind of has a bit of a. Kind of, I guess, an impressionist feel to some of these colors here. Almost like a van Gogh like scheme here. If you kind of close your eyes a little bit, you can almost see that a van Gogh like palette here, maybe there, too. Very interesting looking.
01:17:23.052 - 01:17:34.264, Speaker A: Very interesting. So, yes, I am ready for the launch. Very cool work. Ray case. Tim Romanowski. Good morning. So just interesting abstract here.
01:17:34.264 - 01:17:57.604, Speaker A: That I want to touch on and not miss. And here is another one here from Denise Sanchez Arte, who has left quite a few comments here. So great to see your art. This is acrylic on paper and digital collage. So this would hang nicely with a lot of these abstracts that we look at here. So interesting combination of digital and physical here. Quite nice.
01:17:57.604 - 01:18:19.842, Speaker A: And again, could hang out with the santiagos there. The Lucian agueras. Want it just fit right in there. So all to say, cool work. It's hard to tell what's digital and what's physical. Interestingly so, a pretty interesting piece here. You could also make prints out of this too, couldn't you? Space stenographies.
01:18:19.842 - 01:18:47.698, Speaker A: And is this available? And there's Lucian Aguera. I love it. So very cool. Gogolitis. Primary primordial soup for. So here, taking some of the AWP art that, or psychedelic style pixel art that gogolitis was working on, and reincorporating it into the circuitry here of these kind of pixel art machines that gogolitis makes. So very interesting.
01:18:47.698 - 01:19:19.794, Speaker A: Almost reminiscent of the Star wars. Light speed there in the middle there, but beautiful pixel fun. What is happening here on the market? I don't see any listings yet, so just posted, but not listed, I believe. Flux number eleven, this is edition of five by Brown. So another addition here to this very interesting abstract pixel art series, or abstract digital art series, but with a fair amount of actual. Just kinda. It is tempting to call it pixel art.
01:19:19.794 - 01:19:44.254, Speaker A: Some people would define pixel art as having kind of bigger pixels than this, but definitely we could call it digital abstract animated abstract here. Interesting color scheme too. Flux number eleven, this is again, five tezos edition of five. Here's feels another kind of animated abstract artist here. This is called field, and I think this was burned. I'm not sure if there are new ones. Let's just look at the work first.
01:19:44.254 - 01:19:59.898, Speaker A: Interesting masking going on here. And just an interesting, again, abstract here. See if a new one was made. Just out of curiosity. Not yet, not yet. As you see here, really talented animated abstract. I think we might have started.
01:19:59.898 - 01:20:44.624, Speaker A: We started a show with one of these works, I believe. Yeah, like maybe a couple of months ago. So all to say, very cool artists, here's Jada with a very kind of jittery giphy animated abstract work too. I'm not sure if this has been posted anywhere, but another cool work from Jada GM, that's on x. And of course, acid boy here with an interesting rainbow kind of version of the work here. We can even make it full screen here. And another kind of visual dance here for our eyes as we see these kind of plush circles here, you know, orbiting this flashing sphere in the middle.
01:20:44.624 - 01:21:09.804, Speaker A: So trippy as ever from Acidboy. Lucas Lejeune almost looks like a dragon, but hard to say again. So we saw Lucas Lejeune in the comments at the start and describing all of the different tools, after effects, illustrator, not necessarily a huge amount of code. Interestingly so. Very interesting and very cool looking. Here's Strato sandstorm. Take a moment.
01:21:09.804 - 01:21:40.876, Speaker A: So interesting piece here. I mean, look at this, kind of geometric, just kind of, almost has a touch of physics and, like relativity kind of feel to it here. 11,000, 12,000 views so far. This is on tazos. And again, remember we saw the strano work that was, that Sabato had picked up and it was using this kind of pen, plotting here. So physical. I think it includes a physical.
01:21:40.876 - 01:22:01.124, Speaker A: So I guess that's what Sabato bought. How cool is that? So it has a physical work with it. Koda Nakazono with a nice abstract here as well. Cool colors, nice animated abstract filament number twelve. And that is sold edition of one or just transferred. So maybe private sale. Let's speed up here.
01:22:01.124 - 01:22:20.648, Speaker A: The side hustle. Cool. Kind of simple abstract here with nice, with nice kind of colors. Rainbow colors cycling through. Reminds you of Kristen Ruse could hang in the same show, shapes and whatnot. Zero one using graphics too. So remember we were discussing retro tech at the beginning using old software.
01:22:20.648 - 01:22:48.572, Speaker A: Here's Zozo sunbeam. Let's see if we can get this. So I love Zwozo's work. Just a wonderful, wonderful artist here. So just looking up at the sun here and what is going on here. 350 edition one going to Guru, Guru Hyena edition of 20. I think the other one sold out that we were looking at there.
01:22:48.572 - 01:23:12.302, Speaker A: That awesome work that I started the show with, I think that's gone. So get it while you can, all the same. So a lot of horses were released in the last day. I think John Cates was. I think I remember reading was putting on a contest, like horse trading or something. So human boy put out a quick horsing around horse, as he put it on x here. So here is a horse of sorts.
01:23:12.302 - 01:23:30.534, Speaker A: We're going to see more kind of abstract here. Made in gimp again. We're back to Gimp here. So very interesting software. So edition of 50 for two tezos and already selling a ton, which is awesome. There are four left. So very nice from human boy.
01:23:30.534 - 01:23:50.214, Speaker A: Here's walk with another one of these September 11 works. This is 1019. This beautiful blue sky and destruction. One assumes this is at two tezos on primary on at auction. And here's Kurt Hussle. This is a minute 15, so I'll just give you the highlights because it's wondering. This is sector nine, part one.
01:23:50.214 - 01:24:20.826, Speaker A: Where's J and K and Terry? An empty airport arrivals. It seems like an airport. Could be like a flower factory or something, for all we know. So nowhere to be found here. Kind of looking like an airport. Sector nine, so hilarious. Beautiful work from JNK and Terry, aka Kurt hussle.
01:24:20.826 - 01:25:04.720, Speaker A: Collective edition of 25 for three tezos. And here is Elie Lowe. Interesting pixelation there. Interesting piece as ever from La Lowe. Live guitar recording, digital synths, hand paint and photo scan textures, manual modeling. So a ton of work put into this edition of 50. Again, kind of trash artist here.
01:25:04.720 - 01:25:29.984, Speaker A: Trash bag s two, season two, episode four, maybe for a tezos, 40. Selling a lot of them. So very cool there. As we go into the video glitch art, here's lb unwind. So we continue this massive episode here. I'm gonna have to just make less bookmarks, I guess, because it's just becoming a huge amount of work. There's too much fun work to check out.
01:25:29.984 - 01:25:42.320, Speaker A: Check out Elby's work here. Beautiful colors, beautiful textures. Just kind of original. Unwind. Interesting. Cool title edition of ten for five tazos each. Here's John Cates Rainbow mare.
01:25:42.320 - 01:25:57.772, Speaker A: Lost resolution. So putting out a few horses here. Glitch western art. One of one from John Cates to Horse Traders association. So starting a little festival. I wonder if that was why oxine did the Marlborough guy and it was sent to John Cates. Right the other day.
01:25:57.772 - 01:26:11.916, Speaker A: So. So anyway, very cool, this. Sold, this edition of one. Just transfer, I think. Here's Lorna Mills looking like kind of joining the party here with a unicorn. Incurably untrue. Again, a horse.
01:26:11.916 - 01:26:27.838, Speaker A: Racehorse name here. Maybe love the idea of horses because she uses the racehorse name. Cool colors here. Complementary colors, blue and orange, 20 tazos, addition of 30. And quite a few selling here already. Seven gone. So that is cool.
01:26:27.838 - 01:26:44.704, Speaker A: Maybe more, actually pale, ex mortal pale. So another horse here. So the glitch people doing their horse work. And also we got a couple of AI works here with the horses. So pale. This is. And I don't know if this sold out.
01:26:44.704 - 01:27:02.836, Speaker A: There are seven left on primary at 666. And this is in Avare. We looked at this. So this, actually, I think we looked at the original of this and this ended up on object one where they have one of ones there. So really nicely textured work of the dog looking up. I've been watching you. 540 by 900.
01:27:02.836 - 01:27:24.572, Speaker A: 6500 tezos and sold for 500 tezos. Again, nice market. Frankly, I'm not sure if we can call this market soft anymore. Interestingly, Klaus composition 132. Here is another work just minted here in the series. Just running. Klaus here, 22 tezos.
01:27:24.572 - 01:27:55.500, Speaker A: And we have another one here, number 135. This selling for 23 tezos to Conehead squid. And so just running with this beautiful violet too in the background there. Running with this series already in the 130s. Here's Roccano 24 hours. So a cool kind of almost like a fountain you'd find in Italy or something in Rome with a little laptop, ATM 24 hours on it and some palms for good measure. Money coming out of the fountain 24 hours.
01:27:55.500 - 01:28:19.770, Speaker A: It's almost as if this is an ATM, I guess, with the money coming out of it. Interesting. Available for five tezos. Edition of five. One gone. Mika Oladef with another interesting variation here on the bust of a kind of humanoid figure here that is on x. And then we have Louie with an interesting GLB here.
01:28:19.770 - 01:28:48.800, Speaker A: And we have a few GLB's today, which of course, you know, kind of these virtual sculptures, right, floating through life together. This is edition of one for 65 tezos here. And interesting kind of abstract element there in between. So interesting sculpture here and there on top is MD. So interesting piece here. Let's continue. We have Spiegelsmeskinen and I think one of these sold for 0.05,
01:28:48.800 - 01:29:10.232, Speaker A: I believe. Current price 0.05. So that is what it is at right now. And again, you can kind of zoom in here. This is on Akkad art, which I don't know a ton about, but I think they're doing some sort of virtual sculpture exhibition which is well timed with all of the Apple vision Pro there. Kind of a retro computer. It's basically an office, hilariously.
01:29:10.232 - 01:29:42.144, Speaker A: And here's Sabato. Glitch photogrammetry from 3d model scanned in Northampton, Massachusetts. Object data bending GLB compression glitches. Capybara was added to the post. So there's the capybara. And here you see what looks like 3d scanned 3d model somewhere in Massachusetts with a capybara, you know, providing nice contrast, I might add to this whole piece because it's not kind of glitched out in the same way. 3d, very cool.
01:29:42.144 - 01:30:09.804, Speaker A: Current price, 0.1 ETH, which again, is nothing. That's that's no small amount. Now that's $280 us, like, nice, nice take. And here's Zed, you know, kind of playing with the 3d thing. Interesting piece here from XCD, which, you know, playing with this USB stick here with a little bit of aSCII, kind of interesting combination and cool colors as we go into the AI. Finally, another massively long episode here, dancing.
01:30:09.804 - 01:30:30.880, Speaker A: And I didn't open, like, you know, 50 tabs, if you can believe that, 50 bookmarks, which I basically said, we'll open this on Monday. So dancing horses, this is aylay. Look at how great this looks. So using improps, look at these colors. Beautiful colors. Some interesting brush marks underneath. And just interesting portrayal.
01:30:30.880 - 01:30:58.024, Speaker A: So again, doing the horse theme that we were seeing, here's another disappearing horse with a lion. Again, improps has, there's something about improps that is quite beautiful in its textures, and it's just its lines. There's something quite persuasive about it. Created August 2023. Interestingly, improps open studio. Interesting. So maybe just releasing it because of the horse thing.
01:30:58.024 - 01:31:14.190, Speaker A: Because of the horse. Well, for lack of better term, festival lavender horse. Here's circles. So playing with different shapes, but the color, again, just awesome here. And then again, the outline of a horse. Just beautiful AI. Super interesting AI artwork.
01:31:14.190 - 01:31:40.764, Speaker A: I found this one by Lily Illo, super interesting as well. Maybe we can zoom in. This part here kind of screamed at me, this painterly texture here with this kind of, for lack of better term, you know, deconstructed chair here. Or, you know, just. Yeah, let's just call it that for right now. You know, this kind of. This impression, this AI impression of a chair, this geometric impression of a chair here.
01:31:40.764 - 01:32:01.328, Speaker A: And then I just thought this was awesome for whatever. It just added this sense of just another poetic, interesting, poetic element here. Almost the paint referencing, almost like the painterliness of this whole situation. Very interesting. You kind of see it. I see it on this other screen here. A little darker around the edges, too.
01:32:01.328 - 01:32:17.696, Speaker A: Just very interesting and beautiful. Unknown collector posted this. This is intro void. I thought this was pretty cool. I didn't see where it was from, but again, combining, I think, AI and digital painting here. So interesting piece there. Complex work.
01:32:17.696 - 01:32:41.512, Speaker A: Here's venta times AI. Two trees. They could easily hang in the same room there. And here's a really cool landscape here with some beautiful trees. Let's see what happens when we zoom in. Look how big this is. And you see up close everything that's going on with these kind of skull figures again, AI artwork here as we're on the beach looking over with kind of a stormy sea in the background there.
01:32:41.512 - 01:33:00.912, Speaker A: As we continue to sail forward here. So this is an edition of ten for five tezos as we almost finish our marathon here. Here's Okote with just a GM. I think this is AI. Kind of a bit more of a psychedelic kind of feel to this one. Of course, we remember from the global south series here. So interesting.
01:33:00.912 - 01:33:26.592, Speaker A: Almost like techno shamanism type kind of feel to it here. Interesting. Almost black light colors, interesting palette there. Here's Santiago with some interesting experiments. Lone wick, if you've missed Santiago's latest works, do yourself a favor and check them out. He's made yet another beautiful turn in his evolution. So this is on Zora, looking like AI, kind of mixing with Santiago's works.
01:33:26.592 - 01:33:53.532, Speaker A: You know, I could see this just being. Take a Santiago, take some other art piece like a Mondrian, smash it together, hit, blend, and you're gonna start getting wild. Sort of stuff like this. Nice output from Santiago there, courtesy of Lone Wick. Here's Anna Dart, who continues to release work, which is awesome. No son, no name. Again, playing with these kind of brushstrokes over portraits here.
01:33:53.532 - 01:34:05.380, Speaker A: Playing with space a little bit. And just kind of a cool AI art series. And this is not listed yet. Here's another one. No sun, no name. Number 41. This is a PNG using gan.
01:34:05.380 - 01:34:22.750, Speaker A: And again, kind of AI artwork here. Pretty cool. Pretty cool combination of shape, color and form. And here's no hygiene. Another experimental work we were discussing, these kind of pixels here. I actually kind of like them. If no hygiene.
01:34:22.750 - 01:34:45.074, Speaker A: If you're watching this far, I don't mind these outlines at all. Interestingly, because I think no hygiene was mentioning in a comment earlier that maybe was trying to get rid, but maybe it was embracing them here. Interesting. So virtual, again, playing with the experimental AI artwork there. And here's MCH X. Also, this is an AI artwork, I believe. So interesting.
01:34:45.074 - 01:35:04.396, Speaker A: Kind of a light source over here with this gradient here. And then here. A wonderful treat for those that stayed this long on the show. Look at how beautiful this work is by nuggetbrain. A dash of wax pastels. And you see this, what looks like a really cool. Like a kai, maybe.
01:35:04.396 - 01:35:13.660, Speaker A: Massive sampler here. And then you have these tvs. This is painted or. Sorry, wax. Wax pastels. I mean, this is awesome. Little ufo painting.
01:35:13.660 - 01:35:31.474, Speaker A: And then you get these cool kind of retro tv screens. I adore this work. You could just. Another work you could have started with. Here's some other psychological evaluation. Just another amazing artist here. Just like streetcar here is.
01:35:31.474 - 01:36:04.274, Speaker A: What is the name? Clippy. It's Clippy, you know, so interesting, isn't it? You know, imagery we've seen. Remember Ugo doing Clippy? So, you know, I call it the new humor. I call it the new humor. Like there, you don't see it, but there's a new humor that's out on that you see in a lot of contemporary painting. And I'd argue that clippy kind of is on the edge of that new humor. You see it with machine, you know, we'll see it more, we'll go more in depth on what's going on with what I'm calling the new humor.
01:36:04.274 - 01:36:29.050, Speaker A: It's not gallery priest. I think this is a painting, believe it or not. Look at on the edge here, you see, if you look really close, you see a shadow. This is a painting. As far as I understand, this looks like doom with like a fire hydrant here. So like a screenshot of doom with priest. Priest with this artist, I guess priest corp doing the graffiti on this work.
01:36:29.050 - 01:36:56.290, Speaker A: And I think this is painted. I mean, if we can believe that. I mean, let's just very quickly, we've taken forever already with this show. So not sure exactly what's going on because I don't see other pixelated work like that. But what a work. Like, I mean, if this is painted, what a work. And how on earth did you do that? So just super interesting from priest, courtesy of.
01:36:56.290 - 01:37:14.898, Speaker A: It's not gallery able. Burger, more horses. Unrelated to the horse trading that we were seeing earlier. Abel Burger, wind was pushing the flowers. This is work on paper and wood, 70 by 50. Particularly love this one, is what she says here. And I agree, this one worked really, really nicely.
01:37:14.898 - 01:37:40.134, Speaker A: Sometimes when you're working in these kind of beautiful multimedia styles, sometimes you just nail it. And this one Abel burger just nailed. Look at how great the texture is there. Just putting in some paint. Really, really, really nice process. Just again, precious feeling work and interesting kind of the new humor. A bat, right? The outrageousness of putting a bat.
01:37:40.134 - 01:38:19.106, Speaker A: And then you have some sort of clock. Larisa Laban, hora de attende, 90 by 100 oil and acrylic on canvas. So again, looking like that spray paint that we see. And here, Christa Florin, who had never seen before, preparing for our upcoming show in Paris. And here you see all sorts of interesting, you know, here you see the kitchen is in the painting, the kitchen tiling. And then you have all this kind of phone iconography here with the battery or the x being like windows or operating system iconography even here, kind of a eraser, that's a digital eraser. Interesting piece.
01:38:19.106 - 01:38:56.232, Speaker A: The PEPC being kind of turned into spirit with a rose. Lots going on in that work there. Steven WIlson Studio I thought this was just really interestingly treated, created by printing onto a state and pressing onto paper. Almost has a Warhol feeling to it, but not so very interesting. Very interesting process here and results and finally revelts, you know, just keeping pushing our limits here. We have kind of this phone with a shape behind and kind of looking like a figure with some shapes on top. Call me anytime.
01:38:56.232 - 01:39:10.484, Speaker A: 555-2368 so very interesting there. And that is your show, my friends, thank you for joining me on this. Have a wonderful Friday and a wonderful weekend. And until next time, thanks for everything and take care.
