00:00:04.600 - 00:00:36.340, Speaker A: We have broken 300 subscribers, ladies and gentlemen. Thanks to you, dear viewer. Thanks to you. So huge shout out to everybody who is just watching, subscribing, retweeting, commenting, everything in our digital salon, this pirate ship of the mind that we are embarking on here. Artist journal, November 23, 2022, Berlin. My name is Adrian Pokebelli. Welcome back.
00:00:36.340 - 00:00:58.030, Speaker A: And I am a late out of the gate here today. And look at how many tabs we have to get through. So fasten your seat belts. It's gonna be a fascinating journey, hopefully, as ever. And so here we go. This was retweeted via Sabato, so credit to him on the retweet. And this is by though numenal.
00:00:58.030 - 00:01:34.736, Speaker A: I love plotting and painting so darn much. And look at this fantastic contrast combining pen plotting and pen plotting again, is the pen on the machine. And I'm going to show you awesome image of it in an image of it in action from numinal. But look at this. I mean, what a great contrast here, hey. Of this kind of brushwork looks like made with a hand with these kind of really straight lines, you know? Again, it's like the contrast of the precision of a machine with the kind of randomness that a machine would never make, at least. So I think, you know, at least not now.
00:01:34.736 - 00:02:04.264, Speaker A: So anyways, cool work from numenal. Next, let's take a look at the pen plotter in action. So numinal also posted this. And let's just see here. Let me get some volume for extra effect. So look at how cool this is. And, you know, we almost see that Sigmar polka kind of style too, of putting the randomness underneath.
00:02:04.264 - 00:02:57.112, Speaker A: And then you put something completely unrelated, in a sense, over top. And that great contrast, instant poetry that we've been describing. So there's that I want to point out, and I also want to point out the alchemical transformation that occurs. So you see, these are like digital squares, likely made in a photoshop or some other program. And what happens is when you go into the physical world, you start getting weird things like the bleed on the corner, too much ink, right? And this kind of randomness creates a whole other kind of work, right? So again, I I call it an alchemical transformation that occurs when you go travel through the mediums. And sometimes just changing the scale is another way of doing that as well. When you go through the mediums, you do a little graphite pencil and then you blow it up and then you screen print it.
00:02:57.112 - 00:03:32.750, Speaker A: It's a completely different thing. So anyways, fascinating from numenal. Thank you for showing this. I mean, who doesn't want to find a pen plotter immediately after seeing this video, right? What digital artist doesn't want to run over and get a pen plotter? Big shout out to mech TXT, one of our favorite pixel artists who we love to show here for picking up a couple of the eight bit nature series. So nothing like, you know, a great pixel artist picking up some of your pixel artwork. That's exciting. So wheatfield and storm gone to mech.
00:03:32.750 - 00:03:50.070, Speaker A: Txt. Thank you. Big shout out to you. And a massive shout out to ilay for picking up this one of one remix of Raphael Madonna, again, part of the related images series. And this went for 30. So thank you aile and thank you for everything you do. Ilay.
00:03:50.070 - 00:04:22.286, Speaker A: You do the timestamps there and you know, if you miss days or if you just have to stop doing it, I totally understand. I mean, nobody is getting paid here. So I mean, big shout. So give aylay a follow if you like the show, basically because she is really helping it grow. It's probably why it grew to over 300 subscribers so quickly. To me, it was kind of ahead of schedule. As fast as this show actually has been growing, we started with about the 30 subscribers I had for the last ten years, and in three months, you know, we're making really nice growth.
00:04:22.286 - 00:04:38.004, Speaker A: So thank you Ilay, for everything you do. And this is hilarious. Telenft, they put out like teletext. Thank you for the mention. So super hilarious. My pleasure. Thank you for the hilarious.
00:04:38.004 - 00:05:08.276, Speaker A: Thank you. That was hilarious. And we also heard from Uzapas, who also was working with the teletext. Remember the cat from yesterday? The pixelated cat with the strip on the side of the black? And I thought, I kind of like that. It kind of makes it feel like art, you know, when you have these irrational elements put in. And so USapus actually has an explanation. The margin at the right side of the white cat is because this area holds the colorless black line commands.
00:05:08.276 - 00:05:52.512, Speaker A: To color the rest, we use the authentic teletext format that tv stations use. Some tele NFT works are actually broadcasted now. So how cool is that? Kind of like a real world installation. This isn't an installation stuck in some gallery. This is being broadcast through the, I guess, radio waves or airwaves. So how cool is that? They're actually broadcasting some of these teletext works, if I understand USApis wright, Dana Ulama, their great, what I was calling future wave or cyberpunk artist chimed in on the terminology, which is fascinating, actually. A very interesting discussion.
00:05:52.512 - 00:06:26.292, Speaker A: Thank you for the feature. And at 1220, I would say a good term for Gal Barkin's work would be solarpunk, a term I've never heard before. It's futuristic, but not dystopian, like cyberpunk. So I guess cyberpunk is what Dana Ulama probably would call her work. I mean, Atmos's work, I think we could call cyberpunk. Also, I wasn't inspired by any particular subway, but lived in Berlin for six years, so I guess it was subconscious. Yeah, I saw the oo, the u here on top of the thing, and it just screamed ubon.
00:06:26.292 - 00:06:43.166, Speaker A: And so hilarious. So very interesting. Now, let's just. I brought up Gal Barkin's work here. So you see, it's kind of like, as she said, it's not dystopian. It's actually kind of so solarpunk, so kind of sunny cyberpunk. So I guess that.
00:06:43.166 - 00:07:40.684, Speaker A: I guess I would have thought cyberpunk as well, but I thought that was a 1980s term. But then I rethought about it and I thought, you know, maybe it makes sense to call these works cyberpunk. Like, I thought a neuromancer, and again, the eighties, and, like that kind of whole thing. But maybe it still exists, like in the form of, what's that movie, the blade runner? I guess that's cyberpunk. So the question is, is cyberpunk something that we relegate to a certain decade, that is the 1980s, maybe the early nineties? Or is it something that we, a term that we use that transcends the decades? And really it's just about humanity's relationship to technology. And maybe there's a slight dystopian quality to it, and that is cyberpunk. Interesting, you know, so the conversation evolves here to solarpunk is positive cyberpunk.
00:07:40.684 - 00:08:17.076, Speaker A: And here are examples from Galbarchen, who we looked at yesterday. I'm going to kill that. And finally, we have a comment from Axin from a couple of days ago that we missed yesterday. There, Mister Pokebilly. There I was trying to replicate the glitch with screen print using pressured water on a newly coated fresh screen, then dry nit. So let me show you what Euxine is talking about. We looked at this piece a couple of days ago, and I was trying to figure out, like, is this brush work? And then you take a photo, you make it big, and then you put it on a screen, and screen print what oxine is saying he did.
00:08:17.076 - 00:08:55.530, Speaker A: And I actually brought up here, I brought up some screens. Okay, so this is a screen. When you're screen printing, and you see, did the screen print here, you put it on top and you squeegee the color across. So traditionally, the way a screen print works is you make your stencil black on white on a piece of paper. Then you put, like, canola oil on top, and the paper retains its structure, but what it does is it makes the white part see through. Then you put it into this vacuum sealed device with a glass case. You lower it and you seal it.
00:08:55.530 - 00:09:43.496, Speaker A: And then you put a curtain, and then a light comes on. And basically what's going on, you see, wherever there's black, it protects this photosensitive layer that you put on this green photo. So that is photosensitive. And you put that on first in order to make your stencil. So you see everywhere where there's black that was hidden from the light is removed. So basically what happens is the light congeals the green and makes it your stencil. Okay? So what Euxine did is put the green layer on, and before it dried, before the light did anything, sprayed it, put a spray which created this right here, and then let the light finish the job, and then was left with this stencil here.
00:09:43.496 - 00:10:02.152, Speaker A: Okay, so kind of a glitchy way of creating a mark making, and then proceeded to screen print. So that's what was going on over there. Thank you for the comment, axin. Fascinating. Very cool experimentation. Excited to see where the physical works go. That will be fascinating.
00:10:02.152 - 00:10:27.494, Speaker A: So on the, on the polygon Instagram front, runetune had a very accurate comment, is how I'd put it. Instagram needs to make some adjustments if they expect to be competitive with Twitter. For starters, they don't accept gif files. Great point. And they force you into some pretty dumb image dimensions. Another great point. Absolutely.
00:10:27.494 - 00:10:59.304, Speaker A: For the file types they do accept. I would all be for Instagram taking the lead on polygon nfts, but there are too many restrictions around censorship, file types and presentation. That is image dimensions, and max, ten images per post. So a systematic dismantling of why Instagram is not an ideal platform for NFT production. You just. Yeah, itemized it beautifully. I couldn't agree more.
00:10:59.304 - 00:11:29.544, Speaker A: I could have written that. I feel like I. Yeah, I am in complete agreement with you on that. So excellent comment there, arun Toon on the challenges of Instagram. Now, however, I did a quick news search just out of curiosity. Instagram is minting its own NFT marketplace, and they interviewed Alexandra Edmonds, who I believe is with Instagram. And this is the takeaway, the ability not just to display nfts, but to mint and sell them via Instagram.
00:11:29.544 - 00:12:17.716, Speaker A: So you can see where Instagram wants to go with this. When you are putting your image on Instagram, they want you to be able to go, oh, if you have a metamask or if you somehow, maybe their wallet, whatever the case is, you can just hit mint and turn into a collectible, and then with that, we can buy and sell. So NFTs and Instagram, kind of a match made in heaven. Let's see if they do it. But again, it would be nice if they included gifs, you know, so to Runetune's point, so interesting. And just on this whole kind of discussion with Polygon, and again, it's not like my most excited, you know, blockchain to think about, particularly as an artist. But we have to pay attention here, and maybe we want to be early if this actually does seem like a feasible good idea.
00:12:17.716 - 00:12:45.930, Speaker A: So Mando put out this tweet. Polygon and YouTube partnership might be announced today. So I don't think this materialized. Otherwise, I think we would have heard about it and I think it would have been everywhere on Twitter. But just this idea and the fact that this is a rumor, it's a pretty cool idea. YouTube and Polygon, how would that work? Very, very interesting things in the works here. And big shout out to NSFworld, who put out an FX hash.
00:12:45.930 - 00:13:27.732, Speaker A: We are collaborating a little bit behind the scenes on potential merch. Don't want to, like, take that further than it is, but we're just kind of fooling around and trying stuff out and seeing if we can come up with anything. So big shout out to NSFW with this very nice piece that Mikey de la creme got from the Gorefeld and friends FX hash. You see the die with the most likes roast beef in the background, the creme de la creme hat. The, you know, he got the. As Mikey de la creme said, pretty sure I just minted the perfect Gorefeld and friends. And so if you want to help out NSfworld, just go to fxhash and you can find Gorefeld and friends.
00:13:27.732 - 00:13:47.416, Speaker A: And they're minting for two tezos each. And this is a collaboration with purple drank, by the way. Big shout out to Bazaya, who is finally on super rare. That makes me happy, and I'm just thrilled for you. And he wants to give a huge thanks to Xerox. Nft and Chris O. Stoich for onboarding me.
00:13:47.416 - 00:14:20.680, Speaker A: It would be nice to get rat cloak see on too, wouldn't it? So anyway, I don't know how you make that happen, but that would be. Wouldn't that be epic? Because he's someone who I think could do also. Very fabulous. Speaking of cross chain, Mimocat is minting on foundation a genesis on foundation. So that is going to be fascinating because Mimocat has her collectors and it's going to be very interesting to see how that turns out on ethereum. So fascinating. More just traveling through the mediums here.
00:14:20.680 - 00:14:40.934, Speaker A: Bugslayer Betty and she is printing at work. Printing dos trash bird stickers for everyone. Max capacity Empress trash. So look at how good this looks. This looks like, I guess, a five, which is two a four s. If you take an a four and you fold it, you'll get two a five s. And then if you want a six, you fold it again.
00:14:40.934 - 00:15:06.478, Speaker A: So this looks like I would this. Yeah, because you put two of these together, it looks like an a four. So these look like a five stickers. They look pretty good, don't they? So just more interesting traveling through the mediums. Luis Ponce, who I think we looked at yesterday or the day before, who had the crazy prices. Well, maybe this is why. Looks like he's doing something with Christie's bro lp at Christy's inc.
00:15:06.478 - 00:15:28.134, Speaker A: Feels good, man. So we see what looks like an ascIi pepe. So pretty interesting over there. And look at this. This beautiful, my favorite part is the water here, this beautiful rata work in progress. A ship going down. And look at the detail on all of this and the color on all of this.
00:15:28.134 - 00:16:06.844, Speaker A: So very always exciting to see Rata pixel work like this. Some of my favorite pixel art for sure. I'm sure for a lot of people are these, you know, radiworks, the degenaisance, if you've ever seen that one, we'll have to bring those up in a future episode. My first NFT that I like, one of the first I bought was the, I think it was Cosmo de Medici on the horse on tezos. That was one of my first Tezos nfTs. Anyway, continuing on, Gabby Walter with a work in progress as well, on a commission. So again, just love to see the works in progress.
00:16:06.844 - 00:16:50.592, Speaker A: And here looks sculpting, maybe using blender or something really cool. So adding some range with some sculpting. You know, I assume once you get these worked out in these programs that you can 3d print these things too. So, you know, FYI, and speaking of Gabby, Walter, Holyratz is minting on Arthropo. So if you want a gabby Walter on Ethereum, go to mint Arthropo Xyz. And moving into our images here, Dolores Digitis was happy to be on artist journal and mentioned a few people. So here is Dolores Digitis now.
00:16:50.592 - 00:17:21.074, Speaker A: I think we were on this yesterday and we saw this, but there's a new work here. And we missed this other work here. Again, we can't show everything, but here's a nice work by ove. So, you know, just a pretty interesting illustration here with what looks like mushrooms and a cup and just all sorts of interesting. This looks like a larvae, a sun, you know, pretty cool. And also, Amanda hommum, we missed this work. So kind of a Windows 95.
00:17:21.074 - 00:17:57.784, Speaker A: You know, you got the folder up here, you got the window over here with some sort of, you know, the. What would you call this palette? Like, not a neon, but you'd almost call it like creams or whatever, some kind of palette. I don't know. The word escapes me right now. Continuing on, analog video, GiF number 192 by Klaus Tez seemed to fit nicely with those works here. Kinda animated abstract meets glitch. How I described this very interesting.
00:17:57.784 - 00:18:21.112, Speaker A: This very interesting artwork here. Buy for 3.99 edition of seven. So pretty reasonably priced, Elbie with a new work, path to the eternal gloom. Again, kind of abstract meets glitch. So very nice. And, you know, pretty recognizably Elby, which is always a good thing too.
00:18:21.112 - 00:18:48.584, Speaker A: Buy for five edition of 15. And what else do we have here? We have Haiti Rockette and this similar color scheme, interestingly, and I think this is like a big skull, like a big pet ski skull. And it looks like it's moving downwards. So anyways, always cool and interesting from Haiti Rockette. Okay. Okay. Buy for 37 edition of seven Glitchtown Arcade.
00:18:48.584 - 00:19:12.492, Speaker A: And here is another innovation on the glitch on the Nintendo glitch rom. And this looks like almost like a tv show. Like a big tv here, right in the middle. The announcer, your favorite dose of nostalgia. And then we see works all across at the all around. So pretty fun, pretty interesting. And like an old school tv.
00:19:12.492 - 00:19:35.362, Speaker A: Glitchtown arcade. Your favorite dose of nostalgia in one click. And there's the website, actually, you'll have to check that out. Continuing on, Kurt Hussle collective sellout. And there you go, a one of one from KHC for only 52. And it looks like KHC is playing a little bit with these. There's another work here playing with these kind of pixel filters.
00:19:35.362 - 00:20:04.614, Speaker A: These, I almost want to call it like a bitmap or a pattern filter, that kind of one bit on and off filter as looks like it's using multiply on top, a black and white multiply on top. Who knows what they're doing? But just, just, you know, taking a look here at the technical issues. Brendon Burger. Don that burger. So again, classic, sort of always keeping you guessing over here. And here's a work by Ellie Lowe. Let's see if we can.
00:20:04.614 - 00:20:35.374, Speaker A: So more mysterious trash art. More mysterious trash art from Ellie Lowe. Always interesting, always cool. You see, like, they started minting. Yeah. See, these go for $0.80, but they go right away.
00:20:35.374 - 00:20:54.206, Speaker A: And then, you know, people start offering more right away. So the flippers love it, and the collectors obviously love it. Again, it has a real gallery feel to it, or museum, frankly. Axine, with a very interesting work here. Delusion. Again, a lot of flashing images across this entire episode. Be warned.
00:20:54.206 - 00:21:24.820, Speaker A: So what do we have here? A retro looking monitor with almost like a VHS, or a game console here with LFG. Everything is scripted delusion, which looks like an Amazon logo. High anxiety with a half a McDonald's logo, a low life, a skull and a little homunculi, I think you'd call it. You know, in Gulliver's travels and all the little. I think you call those homunculi, all the little guys. Tie him down. Tie down Gulliver.
00:21:24.820 - 00:21:43.930, Speaker A: And a sad face. So with that beautiful matte black that we love. Nice piece by uxine. I think it sold out, like, in ten minutes. Went for sale at 306. Sold out, like, within ten minutes at 15 a piece. So pretty nice business there.
00:21:43.930 - 00:22:24.034, Speaker A: 300 tazos, very nice. Xene, very nice. Boardme social club with a new work. And this is kind of a mysterious work because you see these, like, first of all, it looks like some strip mall beefy, and then this kind of scary looking wrestler figure. And you see the belt here that's kind of off. What's the weirdest part for me is this layer here that at first it looks like tattoos, but then it's over top of the shirt, and then you're thinking, is the shirt see through? Not sure what's going on, so. But interesting edition of five and not sold, maybe.
00:22:24.034 - 00:22:56.706, Speaker A: I wonder if. Yeah, so who knows what's going on there? But anyway, interesting new work from boardme social Club. Daniel W. I missed this work last week, but I want to touch on it. Because it was really interesting just from a compositional point of view and just everything. So you see an empty room and the plugins, interesting colors, you know, kind of two colors, three colors, I guess you got the light switch and you go through the room, and at the back you see this monster figure. And up here you have the light, but, you know, you don't see it.
00:22:56.706 - 00:23:23.962, Speaker A: The first time I looked at this, I didn't even see the monster figure. So interesting, right? Buy for eight. Kind of reminds me of the weird and terrifying, but its own kind of vibe. So this is an experimental series. Timothy Jullien with a very nice work here. Very, very nice work. So dividing up the picture plane, this kind of staircase, but totally, you know, taking interesting liberties.
00:23:23.962 - 00:23:54.878, Speaker A: Like we see with this brown here. You'd think there would be a line here, but they got rid of it. Maybe it's just a wall, I guess, but still just filling in the gaps, you know, of this line drawing with different patterns. And I just love what they did here, showing almost the brushwork with contrast, which contrasts beautifully with these solid panes here and almost the bendy dots over here. Again, a bit of a Liechtenstein feel, but totally their own thing. I even like how they do this little frame here. And you see it's like a.
00:23:54.878 - 00:24:15.634, Speaker A: It's actually a very light gray and a lighter white over top. So I miss this. Mercury. Mysterious title. Continuing on a abstract work, inception by artist Cenk. And let's just take a look as we look at our digital abstract works here. Sorry, the sun has decided to.
00:24:15.634 - 00:24:40.784, Speaker A: Sun is playing games with me this morning, as usual. So anyways, interesting work, this on super rare jank. Someone new experimenting with abstraction. And here's some generative art made on FX hash. And this is made by landlines art, generative. So just more kind of interesting experimentation. It looks like these would make really nice prints.
00:24:40.784 - 00:25:05.604, Speaker A: Also curious about the pen plotter on that one. And look at the different colored backgrounds. So anyways, super interesting. Yeah. So this is their all, you see all sorts of experimentation on their object profile page, putting some lines together to generate unique one of one works. So, very interesting. And here's.
00:25:05.604 - 00:25:32.992, Speaker A: I was tempted to see this as more generative art, but I'm actually not sure. This is from a series called the Distant Sea, Nazare, Portugal. And they look at different coasts. And I thought this was stunning. Again, it's tempting to see this, as, you know, computer generated, because there's so much line work. Right? And you see different, like Indonesia, Big sur, California. So Skorzeny lines.
00:25:32.992 - 00:26:06.036, Speaker A: Geometry and nature. Pretty interesting work. And here's another work that, again, kind of combining geometry and what looks like generative art, but I'm not sure. Beautiful contrast here between just simple abstraction and this botanical, organic, curvilinear structures here. Right again, that huge contrast, these empty rectilinear cubes contrasting with organic nature called Babylon. Nice title. This was released about a week ago.
00:26:06.036 - 00:26:42.688, Speaker A: Missed this one as well for Rip Henry as we go into AI. And this is Rob Nasby, too, with an interesting statement as he continues to explore AI. As I'm moving through this phase of work, I'm really digging the bridge between the surreal and photorealism that AI can achieve if you mold it. Right. The delicate balance in between can give you almost photographic results, yet retain the beauty that surrealism invokes. And that is almost what Dali was doing, was these photo realistic dream images. So you see how AI and surrealism just go hand in hand.
00:26:42.688 - 00:27:14.166, Speaker A: And so let's take a look at some AI. So, new work from Venta, which I thought is making very stunning work here. And just the body abstracted somewhat, isn't it? And you got these different legs, and almost like you'd see, like, eight fingers sometimes. Now you're seeing, like, seven legs, almost like a rat cloak. See, there's their pernicious picnic. And you know who this reminded me of? Speaking of Dali? It screamed the. What is this called? Autumnal cannibalism.
00:27:14.166 - 00:27:48.736, Speaker A: And it just kind of screamed Salvador Dali to rob V two's point. Okay, so, you know, you see the similarities here. Just these biomorphic figures here. And here are some more lean on me Venta Times AI. And so it's really interesting to see artists like Robnis V two and Venta explore AI. And also they have this whole other series of work. And I think that's probably going to be true for many of us as we go down the AI rabbit hole.
00:27:48.736 - 00:28:21.566, Speaker A: But I don't think we should take too long either. And so, yeah, already on the same page, you can see earlier work by Venta, and you see this progression that has occurred, and it's fascinating to watch. Another great reason why object is such a good discovery tool. It's interesting how you know this notification business. Why does Opensea not have notifications on artists? Super rare does, but I don't know what Opensea is doing. Not putting notifications. I want notifications.
00:28:21.566 - 00:28:42.794, Speaker A: I have to go to object. It's even like, object could go multi chain, because the platform is brilliant. Here's new work by Kika Nikolayla, some AI work. So just. She's been making these really interesting still lives. My mom said it's not still lives, it's still lifes. She's been making great still lives here.
00:28:42.794 - 00:29:14.856, Speaker A: Composition number 22. So you see a parrot and, you know, again, very realistically done. So this is Kika Nikolaela, who has actually collected some of my work before. So, big shout out to Kika. And another, a new artist that I hadn't discovered, but Clownvamp collected Moe P Wellington. And this is some very nice AI art, isn't it? So, you know, just very nice. Kind of like a bit of an impressionist feel to it.
00:29:14.856 - 00:29:41.674, Speaker A: Mo P Wellington, artist, collector, and t connoisseur. So, yeah, you kind of get that tea connoisseur feeling. And here's another one. And this was collected, I think, by Artie Hands, who is also a big AI collector. And so it's interesting even, I think, because I'm surprised to see Artie hands, but maybe he's been. I think he's been collecting for a long time on tasos. But what I was thinking, the thought that that provoked, because I see the.
00:29:41.674 - 00:30:20.084, Speaker A: The punk as the. You see the punk here, the cryptopunk as the avatar. And I was thinking, I could see a lot of ETH collectors coming over to Tezos just for the AI experimentation. So here's another beautiful work picked up by Artie Hands. So Mo P Wellington, a new artist to keep track of here, Richard Nadler, collector and artist, now on super rare with some more beautiful experimentation in AI. And look at this. Back to the photorealistic theme here is Alessio La Greca.
00:30:20.084 - 00:30:38.782, Speaker A: Like, look at some of these pieces here, the detail. So I think this is mid journey V four. So it's looking very nice. Alessio like. And look. Starting to sell very nice. And you see the development, too, the evolution here.
00:30:38.782 - 00:31:14.044, Speaker A: So this is all happening very, very, very quickly. So you could be next if you start experimenting and putting. A few hours into mid journey V four, here's another artist, Hallie X, who I don't think we've looked at nature times, art times, technology. And so you see almost a bit of a Charles AI feel to it with the mattedness. And we saw that with deltasauce, Charles AI. And now we have here Hallie X. And I'm kind of always back to this idea of how much is the AI, how much are the artists, the tools of the AI.
00:31:14.044 - 00:31:35.796, Speaker A: Right. You know, how much does the AI want to make certain kind of work? This is beautiful. And the artists are really just helping the AI resolve certain things that the technology wants to do. Very cool. So kind of the light is really nice too. In the painting. In this AI painting.
00:31:35.796 - 00:31:51.732, Speaker A: HS number 34 in a collection called hyperspace. Very cool. Hyperspace number 26. Buy for two tazos. So available pretty cheap. Let's see how many editions here. Only six editions.
00:31:51.732 - 00:32:22.344, Speaker A: So here's a bit of a kind of, you know, not well known artist here, I suspect. And again, you almost get like that interior exterior combination, but not quite. These are more just interiors that have been reshuffled. And here we go again. Charles AI indoor eruption. So you see, you can see directly here, Charles AI is consciously putting the outdoor in an indoor setting or the indoor in an outdoor setting. We saw that a little bit with deltasauce too.
00:32:22.344 - 00:32:42.174, Speaker A: So. And to me, this is just kind of a big metaphor for, frankly, this entire scene right now. This cambrian explosion, I call it. Here's another work, otherfaces Tez. So again, you see almost that photo realistic AI. Look at how much AI is in this episode. And we are almost done.
00:32:42.174 - 00:33:04.330, Speaker A: And here's another AI piece by zero zero nine, which veers towards more physical looking art. Fun exploration in stable diffusion. And this is called off brand. So just another interesting piece. And here's an actual painting. This is by naked Galena, who I've never seen before. What did you do last summer? Original artwork is oil on paper.
00:33:04.330 - 00:33:31.368, Speaker A: And this is a digital copy of an analog artwork. Let's just expand that. Pretty nice painting, though. So I had to include it here. Just an original. And it looks like underwater, like this would look great in a gallery. And again, couldn't you just see the digital marketplace being the place for these selling? It's almost like object needs tools for like shipping and kind of guaranteeing as a buyer, you're going to feel okay about buying that physical art.
00:33:31.368 - 00:34:08.762, Speaker A: But I think there's, you know, because right now you give them the tezos and you pray that they're going to send you the art. And of course, 99% of the time they're going to do that. But imagine if they had just a little bit more infrastructure to facilitate physical sales, the potential of that, because this is too easy. This is not like satchy art, right? And then they just take their 2% or maybe they make it 5% for physical works. Del Cante draws a physical work is an NFT dress for the nose you want, not the one you have. What is this called? It sounded like. Yeah, rhinoplasty in Alaska.
00:34:08.762 - 00:34:43.853, Speaker A: You have choices so, yeah, kind of reminiscent of. There's a Ballard short story at the end of the atrocity exhibition. Prince Margaret's rhinoplasty. Very interesting work. Is that pastiche? What he does is he takes a surgical medical textbook and replaces the patient with, I think it was Princess Margaret. And so this nose job operation, this rhinoplasty, you see in the. It's totally transformed by using a celebrity instead of the patient.
00:34:43.853 - 00:34:59.381, Speaker A: And that was the work. Very interesting surrealist work. So here's a nice piece by Daucante Droz, who is very consistently awesome. And a work by Santiago. Another ink drawing. See, you can't stop me. So beautiful work.
00:34:59.381 - 00:35:10.916, Speaker A: That's why I added it here. A nice physical drawing by Santiago. And look at this. We looked at this about a couple of weeks ago. Diego just gone. Sold out by Wok. I guess the World cup might not have hurt.
00:35:10.916 - 00:35:27.704, Speaker A: And it's a fantastic piece, though, and sold for 35 ETH, so. And that, I believe, was for the physical work that will be sent to the collector. That, my friends, is your episode. Thank you once again for joining me. Until next time, take care.
