00:00:03.400 - 00:00:33.946, Speaker A: We are on a very tight schedule here as we get ready to go on vacation in Rhodes, Greece. I am not sure if there will be shows, but maybe it just doesn't matter. At the end of the day, there will be the Wednesday rug radio, as ever. Welcome back, everyone. Artist journal, August 4, 2023. Broadcasting from inner space in Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pokebelly, and welcome back.
00:00:33.946 - 00:00:50.494, Speaker A: Check out this work, this work. And it's gonna be a short show today, by the way. Maybe it's kind of a. I always. My ideal time is 30 minutes for this show. Even, like, I used to make them 20 to 30 minutes, and that's when they started getting long. They used to be like 15 minutes.
00:00:50.494 - 00:01:31.234, Speaker A: So I strive. Maybe I'll think, you know, very quickly here, you know, like the show, if there's a show in the next two weeks, and I'm kind of reserving the right in my mind to not have a show other than the Wednesday Twitter spaces. But if there's a show, and I think I'll probably do something, it's going to be sporadic, it's going to be improvised, and. But maybe it's good also. You know, it's. It's kind of a lesson for all of us, which I am, you know, I hear from other people, which I share with you, which we all know, that it's good to take vacations. It is good to take breaks.
00:01:31.234 - 00:02:09.234, Speaker A: It helps recharge. You know, the show may be better if I take a couple of weeks off. So it's all you got to balance everything out. So, all to say, I'm extremely excited, having moved this summer, you know, and all the work that entails. I feel like my summer may actually start tomorrow as I walk on a plane, walk onto that Ryanair, and fly over to the forest fires of Rhodes, which actually have been put out a week ago, from my understanding. So I'm actually really excited to get on a beach, uh, as soon as possible. So welcome back.
00:02:09.234 - 00:02:23.794, Speaker A: Now, check out this piece onto the. The task at hand here. This showed up on my Twitter feed. Maybe some of you saw it. I can't wait to see how many views it had. I haven't looked, but look at this. Look at this work.
00:02:23.794 - 00:03:02.354, Speaker A: Hold on. Almost something oddly craftwork about it. Almost like a Tour de France. This would make a great Tour de France by craftwork video. It's. Even the music kind of has that. And this bicycle, you know, just basic technology.
00:03:02.354 - 00:04:11.196, Speaker A: You know, the Tour de France by craftwork is worth, you know, meditating on a little bit because it really was a celebration of sport and technology. And I just don't think that's accidental. Like, I think there was something just very cool that craftwork wanted to celebrate in the Tour de France. It was also very european, kind of when Europe was maybe back in the nineties, that was like the early nineties, when Europe was, like, super chic. It still is chic, but not quite in the same way as it was, you know, in the early nineties, when you had actung baby, the zoo tv Tour, you know, Europe, you know, the wall had just fallen out here in Berlin, and Europe, you know, this kind of pan nationalist structure, it was like, Europe was the place to be. I don't know if that's true anymore. I think times have changed.
00:04:11.196 - 00:04:42.880, Speaker A: It's still a very cool, fun place. But all to say, you know, I think that also factored into the Tour de France by craftwork. So all to say, I just think this is a genius work of art. This, like, beautifully animated here. This is ascii text, of course. So using, you know, text characters to create a brilliant work of art here. I hope this has, like a hundred thousand views.
00:04:42.880 - 00:05:14.234, Speaker A: I'm not going to have a short show if I keep in 28 user interface. And I mean, what is going on here? Time wind, the gauges. This is an incredibly ambitious work of art, isn't it? Even the music, it's masterfully done. Again, if I walked into the moma and I saw this, I would just be like, you know, I guess I got work to do on this show is what I would think to myself. Like, this stuff's coming out. I don't even. You know, this is great.
00:05:14.234 - 00:05:38.180, Speaker A: So let's see who it is. Even that 44 frames per second, 94,000 views. Good. I'm glad to see that. Adele four text mode, pixel art, games and tools support me on Ko fi Mastodon 5000 followers been working on ASCII two UI. That was hard. Yeah, I'm sure it was.
00:05:38.180 - 00:05:59.618, Speaker A: That was a huge amount of work. Let me stop the music here, especially the input range. But I had a lot of fun making a seven segment display font. Like, hopefully I will be able to be more into gameplay with these elements. The wind through the wheels, Ui design. So just fascinating. Just fascinating.
00:05:59.618 - 00:06:14.106, Speaker A: Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant work of art here. Thank you. Big thank you. And shout out to PP Universal. Adrian is important. A. I'm not sure.
00:06:14.106 - 00:06:55.708, Speaker A: I think PP also might be out of Argentina. It's always great to hear from you. And so this was hilarious. So a nice homage piece here. And that looks like your host here looking, watching, as the words say here. Another beautiful work, actually by PP, using this kind of outline and patterning style, which is very distinct and, you know, and beautifully, like, very, like, I mean, it's a great portrait here. It's very original and just everything, you know, and just like these kind of almost laser eyes here, just intently focused here.
00:06:55.708 - 00:07:22.784, Speaker A: So beautiful edition. Like, we've gotten a few works of arts here that have kind of celebrated the show, which I'm always, like, humbled by. And this is just a beautiful addition in the museum. In my mind, I'm gonna have, there's gonna be, like, the rooms, you know, that just have these works in them that we have enough. There's probably over 20. And so. So all to say thank you, big shout out and thank you, PB.
00:07:22.784 - 00:07:31.104, Speaker A: This is awesome. And I'm thrilled. I'm absolutely thrilled. Thank you. Sent me three copies. Awesome. I thought it was hilarious.
00:07:31.104 - 00:07:57.670, Speaker A: I was like, is there still one on primary? No, they sold out on primary. Big shout out, Ilay. And then the flipper comes in to make three tazos. I thought that was hilarious. Continuing on, and just some comments. Zach Lloyd loved Love fool by Lorna Mills was an instant scoop, even though I screwed up my wallet balance of 69.420. Hilarious and big shout out and big love back.
00:07:57.670 - 00:08:34.248, Speaker A: Rada, really appreciate your support and comments over many episodes here, so it's always thrilling to hear from you again. One of the reasons most of us started buying and taking pixel art seriously is because of this guy right here, Rattyonki. And big shout out and thank you to mint dog and demon ego, as ever, always great to hear from you and everybody. Thank you for the comments. I thought this was kind of interesting, you know, David Hockney's style. I just thought this was interesting. I saw this in art News, David Hockney, Portrait of Harry Styles to be displayed at National Portrait Gallery.
00:08:34.248 - 00:09:09.096, Speaker A: So, of course, in London, if you've never been there, is the national portrait Gallery by Trafalgar, if I'm pronouncing that right, Trafalgar. Trafalgar Square, where Canada House is. And I've been to conferences there before. And so, yeah, there's a national portrait gallery there, and there's also another, the most. The National Gallery is also there, which is full of masterpieces. So worth a visit. So David Hockney, who is one of the most interesting and exciting artists, and I think it's for portraits like this.
00:09:09.096 - 00:09:49.512, Speaker A: So here's Harry Styles. And you know what I love about David Hockney's work, there's something almost kind of celebratorily. There's almost. I don't want to call it amateur or I mean, the word that was in my head was naive because clearly this is one of the great artists of the 20th century and 21st. And I might add, as someone who works on the phone myself, and many of us work on an iPad, I mean, Hockney, this would have happened anyway. So I don't think Hockney should have massive props for doing it first. But maybe in the context of the contemporary art world, he was one of the earliest people to take it seriously.
00:09:49.512 - 00:10:32.040, Speaker A: I guess my point is this would have happened anyway. I don't think we needed, you know, necessarily David Hockney for us to start taking art on an iPad seriously or on a phone. But nevertheless, he did it when it was before. It was cool. And I think he deserves a lot of credit. Like, for me, it's more of a sign of his innovation and his understanding, I would argue, and appreciation and, you know, just his open mindedness as an artist. To me, that's more the, you know, it fits into his larger kind of oeuvre as a kind of, you know, a sign of, this is how interesting this guy is.
00:10:32.040 - 00:11:18.656, Speaker A: And so when I see this work here, and of course, he's done a ton of portraits, you can even see another one in the background here. And I'm going to try and show you the larger version. So this was done in 2022. And of course, there's Harry Styles, but there are a few things, like, you see, that I want to point out here, because this is actually a very illustrative image here. And look, we can even, because this is what I want to show you see how the chair here, he just puts lines, but here it's like an interpretation, right? And even here, it's not like he's trying to paint every little, you know, it's probably a wicker chair, is what this is called. It's not like he's trying to paint every little wicket, if that's what you'd call him. He's more just kind of impressionistically and he just knows, you know, and this is where the experience comes in.
00:11:18.656 - 00:11:50.334, Speaker A: If he makes it about that size, it's going to work and it's going to communicate what needs to be communicated. Same with the cushion bit of interpretation, putting a little bit of stripes on the cushion and everything. What I love is just his, what I tempted to call a playful naivete. But again, with Hockney, this is all by design. He's making it look easy. Like, when you see a work like this, it's tempting to think, well, I could, we could all do this. Right? But he's making it look easy.
00:11:50.334 - 00:12:19.594, Speaker A: Every little brushstroke has, you know, a lifetime of experience painting here. And I just want to actually also look at the tools here. This is acrylic paint. And, I mean, there's a beautiful humility in the tools here, too. I mean, a couple, this is stuff that probably most of us have in our respective apartments or homes. Like, you know, you probably have a lot of this stuff. You know, just a couple of brushes, a couple of palette knives, and a little bit of acrylic paint.
00:12:19.594 - 00:12:39.228, Speaker A: It makes you want to paint. And to me, that's almost a sign of a great artist. When you see great, a great artist at work who's making it look easy, it makes you want to paint. So fascinating. And just a couple of. So I brought up the, there's a link to the work that showed up in vogue, exclusive first look. This came out, so it's kind of fun.
00:12:39.228 - 00:13:15.944, Speaker A: Vogue gets the exclusive here. A couple of things I want to notice. Unfortunately, we have these kind of, you know, it's hard to get a proper picture here, but there's a couple of things I just want to point out. First of all, the white background, which I think I remember myth did that about a year ago, had a great portrait of him and what looked like maybe his brother or an alter ego with just a simple white background, looks like Hockney's doing that. And we saw it in this other work back here. Right. So an interesting choice because it really does put the focus on the person.
00:13:15.944 - 00:14:07.222, Speaker A: Because oftentimes when you do a portrait, the temptation is to put a bunch of stuff in the background that somehow maybe is representative of that person, you know, that person represented as objects. And here there's something kind of beautifully naive, is how in the style, not in the execution, this is not naive at all, but there's something beautifully in the style, kind of purposefully naive and just brilliantly painted, again, makes it look easy. Another thing I wanted to mention, finally, and this is a meter 20 by, like, 91. Again, you can see the size here. So, you know, that's actually a fairly large size, and it kind of looks smaller here. But I guess, you know, you put it lower on the, whatever this object is called that I'm blanking on right now. So.
00:14:07.222 - 00:14:57.756, Speaker A: And the denim is quite beautifully colored. I thought this was interesting. The cutoff here, you know, almost as if he had started too low, right? I mean, this is a classic situation where if you kind of start with the face, let's say, and start working, and then you run out of space. So, you know, not blocking things in ahead of time, probably. I mean, this is David Hockney, who, who has written many books on art history, you know, as someone who's paved the way in a lot, in so many different ways, it's hard to see this, and I assume this is the bottom of the work. It's hard to see this as not on purpose, or at least just, again, purposefully naive in its execution, where he probably started here and then went, oh, I'm out of space. And embraced that.
00:14:57.756 - 00:15:24.328, Speaker A: So who knows? I mean, who knows? And you gotta love the texture here, the way it's executed. You see the vertical brush strokes. I wish we could make this big. You making the horizontal lines working with a vertical, you know, that's also super interesting. So just great stuff. A couple of pen plotter works here. Emra Maida, who I don't artist, has work on Tazo.
00:15:24.328 - 00:16:02.672, Speaker A: So here's just some pen plotter work, generative art. So I brought it up close here just so we could get a closer look. And you just see again the magical beauty that the pen plotter can create here. So I'm just. There's something. There's just a natural contrast, again, between the machine making a drawing, between a machine drawing, because you get the accidents that happen with the, you know, the pen and, like, the ink coming out, it's not perfect. So it creates an unperfect physical rendition here.
00:16:02.672 - 00:16:18.884, Speaker A: And it just creates that natural contrast of the digital meeting the physical. So pen plotting. I continue to be wonder. I just have wonder and amazement when I look at this stuff. I can't look at it enough. Here's another one detail from the latest plot I brought up. Big.
00:16:18.884 - 00:16:46.334, Speaker A: So you can see here just different colors at work. So clearly I'm going to have to get a pen plotter or access to a pen plotter at some point. Michael Macasso, who just made a nice sale. We're going to look at that in a second. Just an interesting comment here that I wanted to highlight, would once again say, beyond numbers, beyond all the transactional things in our little space here. It is surprisingly small. I'm truly grateful to be amongst you genuine friends, appreciators, be it from fellow artists and collectors.
00:16:46.334 - 00:17:24.566, Speaker A: You celebrate and grieve along with me as I do to yours. Some of you were even as early as my d one in the space I'm genuinely touched and trying my best to hold shedding any tears of joy would want to as I'm in a public space. As I wrote this, this is what I wanted to highlight, though, so nice thoughts, but this is what I want to highlight. I was largely ignored and underappreciated for 15 years in my in real life career. And you all brought back me and you all brought me back alive in a mere one year. A testament of what real impact this place could bring to those who take things slow and take their time to hone their craft. Thank you for being here.
00:17:24.566 - 00:18:10.094, Speaker A: Come what may. I know I'm home here. So this is, uh, I think this is a very interesting comment because I think of, I think there's a lot of people in this space, maybe myself included, who are here because actually they have been more or less refused everywhere else. You know, as I was thinking to myself, this is like a kind of digital salon des refusee, you know, and I brought that up here. I mean, this is what this reminded me of. And I mean, you don't need to feel too bad about it. Now, for those that don't know, the salon des refuses, which is, of course, french for the salon of the refused.
00:18:10.094 - 00:19:05.050, Speaker A: This was a. Let's just read it here. I brought up on Wikipedia, French for exhibition of rejects is generally known as an exhibition of works rejected by the jury of the official Paris salon. But the term is most famously used to refer to the Salon de refuse of 1863, which, by the way, included Gustave Courbet, Edouard Manet, one of the all time greats here, Camille Pizarro, Antoine Cintroy, and Johann Junkin. But I mean, Edouard Manet was in, so you don't need to feel bad. You're in good company if you, you know, so have not made it in certain, you know, official, established quarters. And so, you know, that's kind of what that reminded me of, that comment.
00:19:05.050 - 00:19:41.782, Speaker A: You can read more on it. Look at this, though. Let's just look at this. More than 1000 visitors a day visited the Salon des refusee. The journalist Emile Zola, who is also, I believe, a novelist, I think I've read a novel by Zola, reported that visitors pushed to get into the crowded galleries where the refused paintings were hung and the rooms were full of the laughter of the spectators. Critics and the public ridiculed the revusee, which included such now famous paintings as Edouard Manet's Dejeuner sur Lherbe. So James Whistler, symphony in white.
00:19:41.782 - 00:20:00.982, Speaker A: But I mean, Dejeuner sur Lherbe. I mean one of the all time, you know, canonical works, I mean, celebrated over and over. So. And look at how Michael Macasso did. Just sold a work, this work here on foundation. Minted it a while ago. I mean, interesting kind of strategy.
00:20:00.982 - 00:20:38.928, Speaker A: Minted June 27, I guess put a reserve and then finally, I guess finally the bid was placed on August 2 and then look at that, at twelve and then goes for 69. So another big sale for mech TXT's pixel art. So super interesting and great and big. Congratulations. And here's just a beautiful work and making a nice sale. But Michael Macasso is, you know, has his own hustle that he does on Twitter. He is constantly posting images that he doesn't even mint.
00:20:38.928 - 00:21:05.564, Speaker A: So has really worked and earned his audience and collectors. So big shout out to Michael Macasso, retro Manny with kind of a similar sentiment here. I minted my first NFT 84 antea art in April 22, 2022. It sold to Sandytoes for 0.8 tez. It's now selling for 20 on secondary. It may seem like nothing now, but those early sales were incredibly pivotal.
00:21:05.564 - 00:21:52.084, Speaker A: They gave me confidence and allowed me to room to experiment and make mistakes. Yeah, there is nothing like finding kind of like this instant market, you know, making a work and being able to put it instantly to market here. As I move into the next chapter for retro Manny, I'm reminding myself why taking that first step was so important and why the belief of those early collectors set me on course for what I went on to achieve over the following 16 months. Gratitude. So just nice stories. Sometimes the space, uh, you know, sometimes this space, uh, kind of has a bad reputation or is seen as like tricksters and hustlers in a bad way and all this sort of thing, uh, these stories to me are testament to the space. This is the space that interests me.
00:21:52.084 - 00:22:11.328, Speaker A: So, continuing on, scratch Williams. A lot of digital art, I see, works so much better as a rough for a painting. I would honestly urge many of you to start producing physical paintings of your digital ones. Food for thought. And yeah, using. I'm a huge fan of this. And just look at that Hockney work there.
00:22:11.328 - 00:22:53.456, Speaker A: If you feel like you can't do it, I mean, Hockney makes it look like almost like a kid's drawing and then makes it beautiful. I would honestly urge many of you to start producing physical paintings of your digital ones. Yeah, and I echo this, I've said this for a long time. Not only does it give you range as an artist, but it also is just an incredibly interesting process. You know, when I make digital art and then I try and make it physical, one of my goals is to have the physical work be able to justify its existence. That's why I'm not a huge fan of, say, just doing an inkjet of a. Oftentimes of a digital work, sometimes it works like the, you know, eight pixel nature series.
00:22:53.456 - 00:23:26.908, Speaker A: I will just do a nice inkjet, and it works because I think it's such big pixels on the print that it kind of feels there's something kind of that does justify it. But otherwise, I've not a huge fan. Probably a lot of you have run into this idea of inkjet and just printing out a digital work. It's kind of missing something. That's why I often introduce screen printing. We've seen the lenticular prints here with popple and explainer. So all to say, I totally echo this.
00:23:26.908 - 00:23:55.326, Speaker A: I don't know about this first part. It depends on the work and everything. But I just think, you know, if you're making digital art, it's a great thing to make physical work, too, and it's a lot of fun, and it kind of informs your whole process. Perhaps grotesque Chicago. As of now, the original hen pieces are going to stay as almost like vintage digital memorabilia. New piece is going to be minted on object.com collection, and this is only on the tazo side, but let's talk about that later.
00:23:55.326 - 00:24:37.756, Speaker A: So, interesting idea. The original hen pieces are going to stay as almost. So probably talking about grotesque chic's own collection as if they're like vintage digital memorabilia. One could imagine that these kind of hen contract, I mean, it's still open, so you can still mint on Hen, but it's kind of an interesting idea. And maybe eventually all of the stuff on tezos, should Tezos sort of disappear, let's say, which isn't a crazy thought, maybe it'll all be kind of like, you know, digital vintage memorabilia. And I actually hadn't heard of grotesque chic, but I think he's a bit of a thing, because there's Elby. He's coming back.
00:24:37.756 - 00:24:57.244, Speaker A: It's that time of year when the dead come back to life. So grotesque chic is back on the scene. It's been, what, six months since my last mint and tweet. Today, we changed that. We had a lot of stuff in this time, art wise, we never stopped evolving over here, we were just opening for business again. So it kind of looks like a cool pixel artist here. So a new discovery for me and continuing on.
00:24:57.244 - 00:25:28.134, Speaker A: So we have some pieces here. Marcelo Pinel. I'm starting to think Marcelo Pinel is releasing this as the months go by because we are in Leo right now. I know my. Yeah, I know someone whose birthday is in is a Leo and in July. So I'm starting to wonder if Marcelo Pinel is actually releasing these kind of at the time of the astrological moment. So interesting kind of change here.
00:25:28.134 - 00:25:49.234, Speaker A: The real sun by Marcelo Pinel. In the sun. I think that's a new. I've never seen that. Looks like a bit of collage has been entered into this. And here is the lion representing Leo. And there is the big heart and everything in this magical, you know, amethyst or whatever this is.
00:25:49.234 - 00:26:07.616, Speaker A: Jewel in the front, gem and everything. So just another cool work by Marcelo Pinel. Already 97 tezos on secondary edition of 25. And let's just see what it sold. 40 tezos on primary. So nice, you know, 1000 tezos there for Marcelo Pinel. Very cool.
00:26:07.616 - 00:26:40.492, Speaker A: Look at this gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous work by Uri J. One of my favorites. Just something really hit in this one. Looks like a bed with a clock on it. The mosaic filter, again, this kind of outrageous filter to use in Photoshop has never looked better. I like, again, if I'm like adobe and I see someone using the mosaic filter like this and actually being able to pull it off and make it look great, that would make me pretty excited. Here's a little swing.
00:26:40.492 - 00:27:01.982, Speaker A: Kind of beautiful, almost like a vacation kind of vibe here. Almost looks like grease and a little bicycle. Another clock, you know, one of Yuri J's kind of favorite themes, I think. An interesting kind of. Almost like a bedroom. A bedroom in the bedroom, perhaps. So just gorgeous, gorgeous work here by Uri J.
00:27:01.982 - 00:27:17.862, Speaker A: Seven Tazos edition of 15 left. Get it while you can. Rustic digital art. Tour de France. I didn't even see the title of this. So maybe it's the time of the Tour de France. Maybe that's why we saw that original work in the front.
00:27:17.862 - 00:27:43.210, Speaker A: It probably is Tour. It's usually around this time of year, isn't it? So isn't that interesting? And almost like a golf thing. Or maybe this is the. Almost looks like a, you know, this is where you golf and try and send the ball. And here are all these bikers. So maybe this is a celebration of the Tour de France, interestingly. And these interesting blocks of color, big happy faces in the clouds.
00:27:43.210 - 00:28:03.974, Speaker A: Maybe they're happy that the Tour de France is on big irrational block here and nice and painterly here as well. And just always interesting. From rustic digital art. Edition of ten. There are four left at five tezos Edmarola with another super interesting work here. Kind of semi abstract. No bow and let me play the music for you.
00:28:03.974 - 00:28:33.122, Speaker A: She kind of makes the piece. No animation. Interestingly nice big synths coming in. It's like the strings, the analog strings are. Let's just nice drones. I love it. So great work.
00:28:33.122 - 00:28:45.378, Speaker A: Five USD tz. I don't know what the deal is here. That doesn't look like tezos. So does it. Although it is probably tezos. Yeah, not sure. Five tezos, maybe.
00:28:45.378 - 00:29:05.322, Speaker A: Edition of eleven USDTZ. I have no idea what that is. And we looked at this yesterday, but it has been minted and it's an edition of one. And I think maybe this white frame was put on it. Just a beautiful work. 77 tezos, also red lady from Edmarola. I thought this was great.
00:29:05.322 - 00:29:28.038, Speaker A: Martin Jo has been watching Edmarola's pixel art program, so has been learning the dithering, so has incorporated it into Martin Joe's work. Bring me the moon. Pixel painting and animation. So I think that's great. Open edition, zero minted. Maybe you can get a one of one Martin Joe for Atezos if you get lucky there, if it flies under the radar. Nice look.
00:29:28.038 - 00:29:50.366, Speaker A: You see the dragging so clearly has been to Pixel Ed Marolla's pixel art masterclass. I love it. Timothy Julien, only $0.50. Really original composition here. Border. Nice kind of deviation from the other works. I like the kind of horizontal composition and just, you know, stretching things.
00:29:50.366 - 00:30:11.758, Speaker A: And interesting building here. Kind of an irrational building, because as you look through the window, it's almost like half built or half destroyed. Just a really nice piece. $0.50 edition of ten. Great to see Timothy Jullienne back on the scene. I thought this was quite funny and kind of like, again, kind of contemporary art museum style.
00:30:11.758 - 00:30:43.364, Speaker A: Crash blossom. Excuse me. Screen cleaner blue. So I don't know if you can see this. You probably can. You see how it's almost like there's fingerprints, it's like a dirty screen? I think that's quite brilliant. And I don't know if it's a photo of a screen or if it's kind of like using a dirty screen as inspiration and just kind of making, you know, a dirty screen version, like a digital version of a dirty screen, almost like a little few pixels missing there.
00:30:43.364 - 00:31:02.576, Speaker A: Kind of a brilliant work. Nine tazos edition of 44. And that's already on secondary. Let's just see what it sold for on primary three tezos each. And it looks like it sold pretty quickly. So within like a day, selling 44 at three tezos. Nice work.
00:31:02.576 - 00:31:24.632, Speaker A: Cool idea. Brilliant. And another work by not a number again, playing with Java. Was it JavaScript? P five js, let's call it that. And gimp, what is it? Yeah, p five js and gimp. So continuing to experiment and push things here as well. It's gonna be interesting to see where this ends up.
00:31:24.632 - 00:31:52.104, Speaker A: So just another cool work, collect for ten tezos, one of. One Mandalorian with the five of cups. So a beautiful, another beautiful addition to the. This is gonna be a real contribution, in my opinion, to the whole tarot, you know, lore will be the pixel art. Like the pixel art, you know, cat tarot to me. It's like this. It's really nicely done.
00:31:52.104 - 00:32:11.864, Speaker A: This will. This is the kind of work that survives your life, that survives beyond your life. Five of cups, edition of ten by Manital. Brilliant and beautiful as usual. Great use of color as always. Stalomer inventor's feast. So pixel art, kind of Sci-Fi pixel art as usual.
00:32:11.864 - 00:32:32.696, Speaker A: Almost like an alien planet. There is an alien there, and here are some aliens. And almost like a banquet on a far off galaxy, in a far off galaxy, you know, star system here. So just super cool as usual. What is the price here? 15 tezos. There are two left on primary. Get it while you can.
00:32:32.696 - 00:32:48.364, Speaker A: Go, go. Lightus tuna mech TxT. So all the great pixel artists picking one up. Look at this, you can recognize who this is. Kappn. I love this piece. Even on the phone it looks particularly spectacular post.
00:32:48.364 - 00:33:00.768, Speaker A: So really cool work by Kapn. Here we have a few by Kappn. So nice work here too. Nice addition. Even the red frame. Here's another work. Gloaming dithered night of the soul.
00:33:00.768 - 00:33:28.114, Speaker A: So just super minimal. And you gotta love that massive use of negative space at the bottom here, as if it's like a picture taken with a phone, maybe vertically, and it's at night and you just. The landscape is at the bottom and you don't see anything. Interesting use of color here too, with the red and kind of like a violet. Just really interesting. Very small edition, which Kappn is doing more and more. People love the small editions.
00:33:28.114 - 00:33:43.994, Speaker A: 20 tezos each. And yeah, sold out in a few minutes, in about 20 minutes. So nice work from Capn. Very interesting piece. This was also posted by Kappen. So just a cool kind of abstract. So just ever experimenting here.
00:33:43.994 - 00:34:07.674, Speaker A: A cool gif and another one. The body is the vessel for the soul. And again, kind of harkening back to other works, maybe the Astral Hazers series on tezos there. So just a more interesting work from Kappen. This is Francois Gamma on Ethereum gear two. Gir two reserve of 0.12. Gorgeous work here.
00:34:07.674 - 00:34:31.023, Speaker A: Like, just super interesting as usual. I mean, Francois Gamma is going to be one of the most prolific artists of all time. I mean, you get the sense that. Yeah. And it's always like, interesting. Great artist Silva Santu, sky destroyer. So a new Nintendo glitch rom in the Silva Santu style and just really nice and interesting.
00:34:31.023 - 00:34:46.074, Speaker A: This is three tezos, 20, probably on secondary. Oh, on primary there are five left. Sky destroyer. Cool title. And here's on Manifold XYZ. This is native Ed. And let's just look here.
00:34:46.074 - 00:35:19.894, Speaker A: I think this is free GM. And so here's a lock of sorts and a kind of humanoid figure and kind of like a operating system here. Morning ritual Gif a free GM to all web3 friends slowly and patiently building with me day by day. 172 minted. Wow. You know, that's a good, like, it's also, we're discussing this with Xerox. You know, people, Xerox was saying people underestimate free and the power of free, you know, so.
00:35:19.894 - 00:35:48.718, Speaker A: Yeah, and here you go, all of a sudden, you know, native Ed by doing, you know, just offering free work is in a, you know, 172 have been minted. Now maybe someone minted like 50, which is totally possible, but nevertheless, it gets your work out there. Unoshima. This is Unoshima Renki edition of ten. There's probably one available, as per usual here. Another interesting kind of, you know, animated abstract work. Quite original, this one.
00:35:48.718 - 00:36:08.742, Speaker A: And interesting use of color, too, with the gray boxes and the colored lines. Very cool work. And finally, it's going to be a short show today. Well, not super short, but shorter than usual. Nature licht urs, natural lecturesem, energy drink, tea time. This looks like a physical 15 tezos. Really nice work here.
00:36:08.742 - 00:36:26.234, Speaker A: We've looked at their work before. I assume this is physical these days you actually can't tell. There are oil painting programs that look like this, but this looks pretty physical. Pretty nice work, I might add, for a physical. Looks great collage drawing, painting. 15 tezos. There are 19 left.
00:36:26.234 - 00:36:48.914, Speaker A: And here, this looks like a physical, beautiful watercolor. We may have looked at this before, but it's worth looking at again by Rada here. What does he say? Gm and good hunt. So a beautiful watercolor here from Rada. Like, what would that sell for. I assume it's from rata, because, you see, maybe that says Yonki. I'm not sure.
00:36:48.914 - 00:37:05.534, Speaker A: I think rata. It's beautiful. Whoever did it all to say thank you, everybody, for joining me again. It's gonna be sporadic at best, and otherwise, I'll see you on Wednesday for the Twitter spaces. I'm a couple to upload all to say, let's see what happens, and I'll see you soon. Until next time, take care.
