00:00:04.200 - 00:00:25.182, Speaker A: It is scotch tape and scissors, my friends. The boat is taking on water here. But we continue. Still Internet issues now computer issues. I can't even log into object. But we continue. We continue to sail forward here on this beautiful sunny day.
00:00:25.182 - 00:01:06.526, Speaker A: In my mind, outside, a little kind of cloudy and rainy. Your weather update, courtesy of your international art program, Artist Journal, May 22, 2024. My name is Adrian Pokebelly. Let's go. So who knows what cosmic forces are at work here that are trying to block this program? Who knows? But we're continuing here. So all to say, I am taking on water. And big shout out, actually, to hasdrubal waffle for the hilarious pompadour.
00:01:06.526 - 00:01:25.048, Speaker A: Maybe if the Internet plays nicely, we can look at that PNG that waffles put out. Waffles has new work on object, too, which is super exciting. But let's look at Kyle Flemmer first with his head turning work. This very fun work. It kind of looks like a glitch. Rom. I'm pretty sure it is.
00:01:25.048 - 00:02:06.020, Speaker A: Screen recording and sprites from McDonald's treasure Land Adventure 1993. It's like, why haven't we seen McDonald's done before? It probably has been, but I've never seen it. And it's just made to order, so to speak. And there's a hamburglar, quite a beautiful rendition. I mean, really, I'm kind of always back to, you know, I think a strange thing with the Nike and, you know, like, if I was Nike creative director or art director at Nike, I'd be like, hey, maybe, strange thing, you should come over here and do some work for us. If I was McDonald's, I'd be kind of like Kyle Flemmer. This is pretty interesting.
00:02:06.020 - 00:02:26.090, Speaker A: We might have to do this. We might need to turn some heads here in the mass media. And so just really cool work here from Kyle Flemmer. And of course, this is a glitch. Rom 640 by 448. And I. I scaled up by two.
00:02:26.090 - 00:02:50.100, Speaker A: I picked one up. You see how much trouble I'm having? I had to go onto safari. You see the little warning sign? For some reason, chrome is not letting my kukai wallet log in. So I had to log in on safari, weirdly enough, through another account. And then I sent this over. So I don't know what's going on, if anybody else is having issues. But just so you know.
00:02:50.100 - 00:03:14.300, Speaker A: So I picked one of these up, still available, a Tezos 50 for that super cool McDonald's work. So that happened. Here's another one by Kyle. Continuity error. And this is also a screen recording. Interesting. Of Virtua fighter, 1995 from Sega 32 X, glitched with real time corruptor and recomposed in aseprite was the last one recomposed in aseprite.
00:03:14.300 - 00:03:55.402, Speaker A: So very interesting last detail there. Of course, aseprite, for those who are unfamiliar, is kind of like, I'd say, your main pixel art software. If you're looking to make pixel art on a desktop or a laptop, aseprite is probably what you want, what you want to use. Some people use Photoshop, which is kind of challenging sometimes just to get like, weird things like a square brush in. Photoshop can be surprisingly, you have to go through a few more, jump through a few more hoops than you might expect, let's put it that way. So you might be better off just with aseprite, if that's what you're thinking of doing again on a laptop or desktop. So here's continuity error.
00:03:55.402 - 00:04:08.990, Speaker A: Edition of 15. We're not going to worry if this loads up down here. So just kind of a cool work here. Continue. Another variation on this whole glitch. Rom. Uh, we don't.
00:04:08.990 - 00:04:23.886, Speaker A: I haven't seen too many continues. We've seen, uh. I. I can't remember Haiti rocket's final work of, uh, that I think it was called 99 and one. It was the start scream. That was brilliant. That was brilliant.
00:04:23.886 - 00:04:42.380, Speaker A: So here we have the continue. Uh, which is pretty cool, too. Continuity error. Great title from Kyle Flemmer. And here we have just a recent work that I had missed. Venus. Since we're looking at Kyle Flemmer's work, framed and enlarged in an aspirate, I thought a nice small work here.
00:04:42.380 - 00:05:06.950, Speaker A: I'm sure this is less than a kilobyte. This is probably like, you know, 500 bytes, which I. Now we're going to look at this in a second. And even with the haircut, the hair here continues to be an ongoing challenge. But we're not going to worry about that. We're just going to make sure this records, because I was actually having warnings before encoding error, etcetera. So back to bitcoin.
00:05:06.950 - 00:05:34.598, Speaker A: We're going to look at this in a second, in a few tabs, but the fees are still low. They were at ten v bytes. I actually have been seeing eight pretty recently. And if bitcoin takes off here, get on the train while you can, if it's something that you're interested in doing. I want bitcoin to go down. Like, that's where I'm at right now, because I want to put more work on there. And I don't want to see $100,000 bitcoin tomorrow.
00:05:34.598 - 00:05:57.210, Speaker A: And all of a sudden, my. You know. And so all to say, I put up a nine kilobyte work. I'll show it to you in a second, in a few tabs. I brought it up on gamma, and it only cost me $22, which is really cheap. So I was paying up to $10 a kilobyte. This is, like, around 225, 250.
00:05:57.210 - 00:06:18.584, Speaker A: So, you know, so works like this might cost you, like, a buck or $2, believe it or not. Maybe $2 on bitcoin. So just so you know, 15 by 15 pixel close up. It might even be cheaper. How cool is that? By Senshi Minako. Or close up of Senshi Minako. So let's continue here.
00:06:18.584 - 00:06:34.242, Speaker A: I don't know what the sales are. Only fifteen cents. Fifteen tezos cents. So thank you. No comments on the last show. It's only been a few shows that that's happened. We do have a lot on Twitter, but.
00:06:34.242 - 00:06:53.250, Speaker A: Interesting. So, for those artists, like, you know, there are different ways to get your name out there. Feel free. I mean, for, you know, for what it's worth, feel free to leave comments. It gets your. I read most of them, if not all of them, sometimes also. But here, let's see if this loads up.
00:06:53.250 - 00:07:14.790, Speaker A: Mega Internet computer login issues today. Andrea Oliveira, Cibola, who we started with last episode. This work here. This very cool work. I loved your view on everything, especially about not needing a PhD in art to like the work. I'll take the opportunity to leave an image of the original scanned object here. So very cool.
00:07:14.790 - 00:07:40.966, Speaker A: Thank you for sharing that, Andre. So, scanning the object. So, I mean, pretty complex, isn't it? This is a scanned object that has, you know, found its way into kind of a pixel art piece, so to speak, or at least pixel pixelated piece object. Thank you. Always wonderful. Well, great to have you. Great to have you on board, object, on our pirate ship here.
00:07:40.966 - 00:07:56.140, Speaker A: Thank you. You're doing wonderful work as well, object. Although I am having a challenges with the wallet logging in. I'm not sure. Is that a Tezos thing? It could be my computer. Maybe it's Kukai. I don't know.
00:07:56.140 - 00:08:17.940, Speaker A: But I've. For days, I've been. It could be my chrome browser for some reason. But who knows? But just so you know, in case anybody else is having it, if nobody else is having the problem, then it's definitely me. Silva Santos. Thank you for the mentions and the words. And, yeah, Silva Santoos continues to just iterate forward in a beautiful evolution there.
00:08:17.940 - 00:08:34.716, Speaker A: Retro. Manny, so awesome to see one of my absolute favorite artists starting the show today. Have been a fan of Sable lander, which is Andre Olivera Cibola for a while now. And happy to say I have an awesome one of one too. And of course enjoying the show. Thank you. Ilya Zura thank you for the comment.
00:08:34.716 - 00:09:05.797, Speaker A: Braindead. This was the first version of it. I think it explains a lot, right? And I think there was another work with a red book with a heart on it that maybe was a bible. I'm actually, I looked at that and I thought, I wasn't quite sure if I had gotten any further on the explanation, but I love these little printers here and it's beautiful artwork. Kells, awesome to hear from you. Thank you so much for the mention. You are more than welcome and thank you for the comment and the ongoing support.
00:09:05.797 - 00:09:21.194, Speaker A: Kels. Denise Sanchez, thanks for sharing my work. We all hope to see your reviews. Thank you. Happy and sunny weekend and back to you. Denise Sanchez, sunny weekend to you and keep up the great abstract artwork there. Elena is born again.
00:09:21.194 - 00:09:30.226, Speaker A: Nice one. Thank you. Frederick Schultz thank you. Yut. Good episode. Thank you, Frank Cappa ge from Paris. Dear Pokebelly, thank you, Frank Capa.
00:09:30.226 - 00:09:43.364, Speaker A: Great to hear from you. Tozart. Really good. So thank you. Thank you everybody. And Hitsuono, thanks for mentioning, literally me. You're really, you really were on spot when you said poetry and code must inevitably unite.
00:09:43.364 - 00:10:27.430, Speaker A: My original intention in the game was to make a world where you could do poetry and code and both would be connected. I lacked creativity to make it happen, though. Well, I keep going back to, I think I mentioned this a show ago or two shows, or maybe it's just in a dream, I'm not sure, but there's a very. I think it was maybe on a space and there's, by the way, there's no space today. It is the first Wednesday I'm not going to have a space since we started, but this ship is taking on water here and I'm still no further on solving my Internet issues, etcetera. So rune tune, I messaged him, no show and everything. And these are spam accounts, by the way, so.
00:10:27.430 - 00:11:46.052, Speaker A: But what I was going to say, a very, very important sort of idea on inspiration, let's call it, which is from Plato's phaedrus. And there's the four forms of divine madness. And as I fix my hair and comment on the phaedrus, I, the. There's a line in there and I have to find it. But basically the line goes to paraphrase, because I haven't read it for maybe five years, maybe longer, is the inspired madman will utterly eclipse all the technical know how of, you know, of a well practiced and, you know, refined poetical, so to speak, to paraphrase, the inspired madman will utterly eclipse. Okay, so in, in that respect, if you don't feel like you have the creativity, well, maybe the inspiration, the possession, as they would say, we'll have to bring up the four forms of divine madness from the Plato's phaedrus there. Anyway, thank you for the comment and for the provocation.
00:11:46.052 - 00:12:08.912, Speaker A: Hitsuono also in the community, thank you, everybody, for posting. Check this out. And watercolor plotting. So as you can see here, always. So the dots go down and then they put water. Pretty interesting. Interesting.
00:12:08.912 - 00:12:23.920, Speaker A: I mean, who would have thought of that watercolor plotting. We are living in wild times indeed. Trippie collector KT new open edition. Okay, awesome. Thank you for posting. Sarah Kretschmer. We're actually going to look at this work.
00:12:23.920 - 00:13:01.030, Speaker A: I saw Sarah on last, I think it was Friday, where there was an opening at this photographics, a massive opening at this photographica museum or something. Photographsica. And hilariously, I had never messaged Sarah, who I've known for five years ago was the last I looked on the messages, because I messaged her after saying, hey, great to see you. I hadn't messaged her in five years, so I saw her randomly at that opening. So that was hilarious. Anyway, we're going to look at this also in the AI section. Nice work from Sarah.
00:13:01.030 - 00:13:24.416, Speaker A: So we'll take a closer look there and look at this leggio with a more interesting work. And I have 150 tabs here. So I'd love to show all of this in the show, but thank you. At least here we get a taste, and then, you know, everybody has a shot here, or at least just gets more visibility. Let's put it this way. Hey, Pokebelly. This is yacht.
00:13:24.416 - 00:13:49.832, Speaker A: And also, thank you, AI. That creates 12,000 new kinds of neurotoxins. Yacht, whose work I've shown here before. I really want to see your thoughts on this artwork called the greatness of reflection. And what I would say is it looks really cool. And this is kind of yacht style, which is kind of black and white interesting. Seems photographic, but not, and kind of surreal as you kind of dream like here.
00:13:49.832 - 00:14:22.312, Speaker A: Interesting texture. So I'd say pretty cool. Interesting title, too. Yacht. So very cool would be my, you know, and I'm kind of back to, you know, maybe not too many colors again, bitcoin's not for everyone, but you might want to consider, because it might. The only reason I say that is because we may be heading into a time where it becomes prohibitively expensive to mint anything. I think we're weeks, if not months, and maybe a year or two away from there, Max.
00:14:22.312 - 00:14:39.768, Speaker A: So it's sort of like, you know, and theoretically, bitcoin is forever, or at least for a long time, maybe 100 years, a thousand, who knows? Skulltakes. Thank you. Love this piece by blank embrace. Yeah. Very interesting work here. Ilya Bliznet, great to hear from you again. The inner child.
00:14:39.768 - 00:14:54.184, Speaker A: This is on Saul. Very cool kind of psychological work. And Jo Howell splish splash, free mint on arzora in my low bias collection. Very cool. An abstract from Joe Howell. Thank you. And Kurt Hussle collective.
00:14:54.184 - 00:15:14.640, Speaker A: Awesome. I remember this piece and just an awesome artist. And, of course, simulacro. And I think we're starting to get an Ernesto, I think we're getting into. Thank you for posting, everybody. I think we're getting into last episodes works. So forgive me.
00:15:14.640 - 00:15:28.340, Speaker A: And yes, indeed, because we saw blue retina there. Okay, awesome. Thank you, everybody. Back to human boy. Back to this developing story, this breaking story with human boy. Check that out. 1.3
00:15:28.340 - 00:15:54.522, Speaker A: million views for human boy. So surfing the algorithm was what I was thinking to myself, 14,000 retweets. So, very interestingly, human boy has tapped into something. It's quite fascinating. Here's another one. Blink and you'll miss it. 356,000 consistently, you know, getting over 100,000 views here.
00:15:54.522 - 00:16:20.788, Speaker A: Here's some trees. Well, here's 53,000 just released yesterday, you know, on its way. 600 retweets. So very impressive on this breaking story. And look at. So I think when this all started, human boy was at something like, I'd guess 1500 to 2000 followers. What feels like a week later, human boy is rapidly getting more followers.
00:16:20.788 - 00:16:47.586, Speaker A: 7862. And so this is going to be really interesting to watch. 14,000 retweets. I mean, just think about that. And so getting, you know, surfing the algorithm, as I was thinking here, and just doing stills and everything, so really tapping into something here, here. 147,000. Super impressive from human Boy.
00:16:47.586 - 00:17:08.320, Speaker A: So big congrats. We will continue to follow that story. Now, we've been following the auction market here, or the contemporary art market. There has been a noted slowdown. We've been commenting on it. We've been finding stories about that. The same reporter, Catchy Casuchina, who kind of, I would argue, was kind of breaking that story.
00:17:08.320 - 00:17:36.730, Speaker A: I found it remarkably quiet in other parts of the media. But Katya Kazakhina was kind of blowing the lid and couldn't post enough stories about how the contemporary art market was crashing. However, in fairness, here she is again. Christie's 20th century art sale totals $413 million. As the market exhales with relief. Exhales with relief. Except for a fight over a large 1964 Warhol that sold for $35 million, it was a relatively uneventful evening.
00:17:36.730 - 00:18:25.936, Speaker A: So I have a theory here, and I think it's. It shows how actually, how much the financial markets and the high end art market, actually, they're kind of. It's an asset class. Okay? It's a financial asset class. And what I think's going on is something that, say, if you follow crypto or even if you follow the stock market, you're going to see a similar thing going on. What's going on in the stock market? The magnificent seven, Amazon, all of the Facebook, they have been kind of leading the charge, although with fits and starts and sometimes pulling back while the market goes ahead. But overall, the market is really favoring liquidity, right? Or not the small things, but the big things.
00:18:25.936 - 00:19:22.600, Speaker A: And we see the same thing in the crypto market, where the big coins, like the solanas, the, you know, pick your coin, are bitcoin, ethereum, are making all the moves, in a sense. And all the kind of side coins, the altcoins or the smaller coins, aren't really doing as much, which is not typical. Right. So it's interesting, and I think it all has to do with the investor appetite right now, especially big money, which moves the markets, is all about liquidity and solid investment. So therefore, Warhol, a safe bet it will retain its value or something close to it, versus, you know, some edgy contemporary art thing that's come out in the last five or ten years that is untested. So I think that's what's going on here. And this is a beautiful painting, by the way.
00:19:22.600 - 00:19:53.454, Speaker A: I don't know who did this, but this is a beautiful painting right there. Monet leads Sotheby's $235 million modern art sale, but Carrington steals the show. That was one busy week. So this is the headlines of the week, interestingly, the ten minute bidding war for. So remember, and we saw the 40, I think this went for $35 million or something wild like that. By the numbers, a breakdown of results from Sotheby's modern art sale. Yeah, it was 28 and a half million dollars for the Leonara Carrington.
00:19:53.454 - 00:20:12.296, Speaker A: Lenora Carrington. That is incredible. So that work right here. And so that was a low estimate of 350,000 for Maria Barrio's La Cena. I think that's evening in Italian. Or maybe dinner. Maybe that's dinner.
00:20:12.296 - 00:20:40.028, Speaker A: Anyway, interesting. What's going on in the contemporary, in the art market, the trad art market, I guess we'd call it rip cash. There's a simpler way to look at bitcoin ordinals and fully on chain art, on ethereum. The analogous way to explain the idea is through the concept of what I'd like to call infrastructure as canvas. This is very interesting. And we can't read the whole thing, but we can take a few. We can.
00:20:40.028 - 00:21:23.224, Speaker A: There's a takeaway here, which is Ripcache is comparing what we're doing, say, on ordinals or on chain art, where we're kind of inscribing on this blockchain that's kind of moving this blockchain infrastructure, and we're kind of putting. Stamping here or post, you know, inserting data here and there. This is similar to graffiti, is how ripcache and, you know, like an erode. Nice analogy. Usually, infrastructure refers to large scale public projects like pipelines, railways, tunnels, bridges, and even power and fiber optic grids. But lately, I've been mulling over various ways I see infrastructure being incorporated into art. Consider a railway network, for example.
00:21:23.224 - 00:21:53.044, Speaker A: Graffiti can be displayed on the sides of rail cars and inside walls of railway tunnels. Uh, and then. And this is the kind of actual contemporary art. Desert X is this, uh, Matt Johnson sleeping figure train car sculpture at Desert X. Uh, this is, I think, the kind of art that is actually suffering right now in the traditional art market. Uh, to over generalize. And who knows? I'm just speculating there.
00:21:53.044 - 00:22:34.900, Speaker A: Uh, so now we can't read all of this. Here's the Berlin Wall again, infrastructure. So pretty interesting. Now, comparing this to bitcoin and ethereum as major global infrastructure projects. So, repurposing crypto challenges traditional norms that embodies the essence of infrastructure as canvas. Returning to the analogy of a freight train for artists, part of crypto's value lies in the infrastructure, which is much less dangerous than sneaking into private rail yards, giving it. Yeah, it's true, given its decentralized and permissionless setup.
00:22:34.900 - 00:22:58.550, Speaker A: So kind of like graffiti. Very cool. And I was looking at this work here, and I was thinking, man, this would be so cheap to mint. I don't know where this has been minted 808 on chain collector. But yeah, like this is only two colors. It's maybe, I'm guessing like 64 by 64. Let me bring up the mempool.
00:22:58.550 - 00:23:31.760, Speaker A: Let's see what we're dealing with here. I didn't leave it open because we're set at 15 which is a little higher. This morning it was at eight and again I think when it was at I put in like 13 or 14 or. Sorry, actually I put in eleven. I had to put in the eleven at with gamma and that turns into about $2 per kilobyte, maybe 225. Amazing, amazing, amazing because all of a sudden you can start to say, whoa, I could put in a 30 kilobyte file. I could potentially put in a hundred kilobyte file.
00:23:31.760 - 00:24:06.800, Speaker A: Yeah it cost me $200 but then I'd have a hundred kilobyte file, you know, on bitcoin. Pretty interesting. And you can probably get your money back, right? If it's, you know, attractive enough artwork. So this is the work I put up. It was nine kb and it cost me 22, 50 like so. Yeah so and here it is. And I just delight in how small this is, right? This is maybe, I think 330 by 330 maybe or 340.
00:24:06.800 - 00:24:48.524, Speaker A: It's not a perfect square, I don't think. But I, you know and as Rada has always pointed out with nearest neighbor transform I can just make leave it small at 8.9 then, you know, it will always be able to be made larger on a different, you know, at any time. So you don't need to make it, you know, two X or three X the size mech TXT also. And let me actually close the mempool because it's constantly eating up data here as I work on my phone. So mech txt one of one auction on Ord City, a million sats, highest bid by Sudo. Right 6 hours left.
00:24:48.524 - 00:25:28.206, Speaker A: So I don't know how much that is a collaborative effort from Skull NFT community amongst many other great artists invited by the great Knox 556. So very cool. And so here is the work. So also some EC txt going on ordinals here. Speaking of Mac, this very fun project here, digital hieroglyphs. One of my favorites of the last year has been this project where you write on your keyboard and it gives you, it's like the webdings and here you see it, you type on your keyboard and you get images. So kind of like digital hieroglyphs as mech is pointing out.
00:25:28.206 - 00:26:01.546, Speaker A: Here is another, this one's got a real ultima feel to it for some reason, which I think was one of the main inspirations here, visually speaking. But a slightly, as you see down here, a different ratio. So instead of it being square, it's kind of a two to one. So being creative there in the ratio, in the pixel ratio, I think you'd call it. So very cool there. And just another one for good measure here from Mac making it his own. Some nice columns here and everything in that kind of computer.
00:26:01.546 - 00:26:22.752, Speaker A: That computer, green from the eighties, the apple Iie, as many of you know that. Many of you know. Who is it? John Cates. Shout out to John Cates. All right, object.com announcing the launch of the object gallery with the exhibition matter and data during art Basel. And yeah, Basel.
00:26:22.752 - 00:26:56.288, Speaker A: I was corrected on that very early on when I moved to Berlin. It's not art basel, it's art basel. Just so you know, a little tidbit there. The inaugural exhibition of the object gallery will take place at the digital art mile at space 31 on June 10 to 16th in Basel, which is in three or four weeks. The exhibition will also be presented online on our platform. Matter and data highlight 17 artists that explore the tension between the immateriality of the digital and the embodiment of, or physicality of matter. Breaking stereotypes around digital art.
00:26:56.288 - 00:27:39.294, Speaker A: More specifically, NFTs Anna Livia Cordero, the inventor of cybernetic choreography and one of the most significant pioneers of digital art, will present an interactive installation with live minting, powered by object. Regina Silvera, one of the most important names in Brazil visual art scene, adapts one of her works from the 1980s into an animation. Zancan Qbien I haven't heard, to be honest about most of these people. I've heard of Zancane, I should. I vaguely have heard of analyze Cordero, I haven't heard. But most of these, I was looking earlier, most of these names, actually, I haven't heard, which is interesting. Roddell Warner, I have heard.
00:27:39.294 - 00:28:15.502, Speaker A: Salawaki, of course. Viola Rama, I think. Yeah, viola Rama. So anyways, something interesting, we'll have to see it when it loads up on object, but, you know, pretty cool that object is at art Basel and kind of trying to do some. I'm sure there's a lot of interest out there. And you know what's interesting? As long as this computer doesn't crash, we're going to see RJ, a work that Skalmer picked up, this beautiful work. We were looking at it last week.
00:28:15.502 - 00:29:13.618, Speaker A: I brought it up again with these almost moonlight colors I mean, 30 tazos, you know, where's the value right now? You know, when I look as far as like, what are you going to do with your investment money, you know, with Tezos? And it's not financial advice because it hasn't really worked out too well for many of us Tezos collectors, to be perfectly frank, from a financial point of view. But I still look at the value and I am a still really impressed right now. I think it's worth it to keep your eye on Tezos art. Like getting one of ones from RJ for 30 tezos, people were spending up to like 700 tezos, not that a few months ago. Right. So just interesting. Kika Nikola, curator at object one, if I'm not mistaken, when I see instructions to buy certain drops, you need to be in an, in an allow list and you need to buy in a certain time frame, then you need to reserve in advance the piece you like, etc.
00:29:13.618 - 00:30:13.768, Speaker A: Etc. Am I the only one that finds this extremely tiring? Do collectors really enjoy this? Yeah, so this is kind of typical for those that are watching that maybe don't know, this is kind of typical for the crypto scene to do these like, you know, you better hurry and like this almost like a toxic relationship where it's like, you have to do this and you better, you know, by the end of it, you know, just tell me what to do and I'll do it sort of thing. So I think that's what Kika's kind of saying. Like, all this jumping through hoops, I find it super obnoxious. And the problem is the people who are going to win are the people with all the time in the world. Like, if you're an art artist, like, who do you want to own your work? The person with nothing better to do than to jump through all these hoops, or the person who doesn't have time for this stuff is making big deals, is, you know, working in the world and doing things. Who doesn't have time to do all of this stuff? Who do you want your collector to be? And that's.
00:30:13.768 - 00:31:03.170, Speaker A: So I actually totally agree with this whole. To me it's, do you want like professional people to be buying your artwork or do you want people who have not all the time in the world? It's just kind of like, you know, so I totally agree with this. And so, yeah, I continuing on, runetune sent this to me. I thought this was super interesting. And rune tune made the observation. So this is Robert Crumb, the famous underground comics comix illustrator comics artist from the US famous for Mister Natural, Zapcomics and Fritz the Cat, which I think was turned into a movie that I didn't see. Radda has talked about the influence of Robert Crumb on him.
00:31:03.170 - 00:31:36.150, Speaker A: And so this came out from the official R. Crumb. And it was pointed out by Roentoon. Look at how Crumb is dividing up the cartoonists and illustrators from quote, unquote, fine art, right? We have da Vinci, Bosch, Bruegel. Bruegel. And Crumb is sometimes called America's Bruegel by the famous time critic Robert Hughes. He used to call crumb America's Bruegel.
00:31:36.150 - 00:31:59.754, Speaker A: Interestingly, within the context of this conversation, because then on the other side, we have these very famous comics artists. Carl Barks, many of you will know. Some of you will know Walt Kelly. Carl Barks, of course, the very famous. I think he might have invented Uncle Scrooge, if I'm not mistaken, in four color comics. Amazingly. Yeah.
00:31:59.754 - 00:32:16.290, Speaker A: And one of the great artists makes paintings. If we had more time, I would bring them up. I have before. I have before Norman Rockwell. He considers an illustrator. I mean, this is hilarious. Jack Davis, who was in EC Comics.
00:32:16.290 - 00:32:39.810, Speaker A: Wally Wood, also Ec comics. Aline Kaminsky Krum, his wife, hilariously so. Very cool, isn't it? Salvador Dali. But interesting distinction between cartoonists and illustrators. And quote unquote fine art. So just interesting. And there's something else that has to be said here.
00:32:39.810 - 00:33:14.720, Speaker A: This is something I haven't talked about since very early in the show, I don't think. But this is what you see here with crumb putting all the influences on one page. That's something you've seen with Max Ernst in beyond painting. We've brought that up again. We'll bring it up again at some point here where he puts Max Ernst, favorite poets and artists. And on one side you have, like Shakespeare, you know, etcetera, and Poe baudelaire. On the other side you have Leonardo da Vinci, Picasso, etcetera.
00:33:14.720 - 00:33:41.198, Speaker A: So we see it with Alfred Jarry, with the life and opinions of Doctor Fostrel Pat, a physician, where he starts listing the library where he hilariously puts himself in it. Right. Peru. Bu, along with Plato and Po. Again. And others. So this is, this is something you might consider doing, let's put it this way.
00:33:41.198 - 00:34:08.404, Speaker A: If you're an artist, to put all your, you know, to do something like this, there's a beautiful, very interesting tradition of doing this. This was posted by Radda. This was hilarious. And I thought this was a very interesting and hilarious piece of course. Life. What is it? Life in hell by Matt Groening here, inventor of the Simpsons. Before he did the Simpsons, he did life, I think life in hell or life is hell.
00:34:08.404 - 00:34:24.804, Speaker A: I can't remember. Failure, success. I mean, it's the same thing. Just the paper has a different mark on it. You know, the papers say different things, but nothing has changed. You know, the same kind of anxious person out here in the world. You know, there's the, you know, a few things.
00:34:24.804 - 00:34:42.291, Speaker A: The novels in the. In the wastebasket here, it's not. But basically just a hilarious piece. This was interesting. A comparts. I'm not exactly sure what a compart is. Let's just look.
00:34:42.291 - 00:34:55.339, Speaker A: It's not. Forgive my Internet. Forgive my Internet. The first web3 computer art auction. Something house. So it's a computer art auction house. Interesting.
00:34:55.339 - 00:35:16.448, Speaker A: This was curated by Elna Frederick and Francoise Gamma. Interestingly. So here are some snippets. Here there's a Dan control. And here, as long as it loads up Elna Frederick classic. Who does a lot of the flashing works there? Pixel fool. And who's this? Francois Gamma.
00:35:16.448 - 00:35:32.182, Speaker A: Interesting. And here, I think this is blue 281. So very cool there. Here's Dan control. Right, brilliant work. Hilariously. The cold wallet with the lipstick and the dentures.
00:35:32.182 - 00:35:44.446, Speaker A: Chris Wood. And here, this looks like Gozo. I haven't seen that one. And more Sean. Luke. So just kind of interesting element li dream corridor. So element ly continues to do quite well.
00:35:44.446 - 00:36:02.050, Speaker A: Again, this thing is probably minuscule. A couple of kilobytes I'm imagining in size. That would cost you like $5, I bet, to mint on bitcoin right now. So, yeah, that's kind of got me preoccupied. And look at this. Ugo digi. So here, we can't go through everything here.
00:36:02.050 - 00:36:17.556, Speaker A: This looks like RJ. Interesting mix, isn't it? Very interesting mix of artists here. And this looks like Datura. I think I brought this up. Yeah, it is Detoura. So as you see here, I'm using a ton of data here to go through this. So I'm going to close that rinnefish.
00:36:17.556 - 00:36:34.496, Speaker A: Dear bug friends, look at it. I don't think we've looked at this, but I saw it a couple of weeks ago. A little bit of a preview. Dear bug friends, in one week we'll start the pre order of my first solo art book. Sometimes mind blowing. Thanks to a very cool opportunity with snap collective world. I'm feeling real nice about it and just wanted to share again.
00:36:34.496 - 00:36:52.690, Speaker A: So, I don't know, look at this. And we're discussing how print kind of builds credibility. And it does. You kind of see it right here. And you go, if you saw this in a store, you'd be like, wow, look at what rinifish is doing. Pretty impressive. If you're a collector, you say, maybe I take another look and maybe I pick up a couple.
00:36:52.690 - 00:37:15.420, Speaker A: So very cool. This is just something that happened on mid journey here. I put myself into a mid journey picture. I still can't believe how easy it was. So here's the original picture, and then here's the person, and then they put themselves into here. I mean, so that's pretty cool. Just kind of interesting developments with AI.
00:37:15.420 - 00:37:30.160, Speaker A: Let's continue. Art in progress. So here is walk, and we'll see if this loads up. It does. So walk in the studio here. And just a window onto how walk does it. And wearing the mask, as walk should.
00:37:30.160 - 00:37:53.604, Speaker A: And here's another one in the studio. Selfie. And here just looks like a bunch of celebrities doing a selfie here. So just awesome from walk. So a few studio shots, and we saw this from demon ego before, but I don't think we saw it quite so in depth here. The demon ego in the studio. So just cool.
00:37:53.604 - 00:38:18.114, Speaker A: And there, that is what I want to highlight there. You see how actually small some of these works are. Two, a four s, which is a three, actually. So very cool there. Into the works we go. Hystrubal waffle, dropping a few works. There's also some that I wasn't able to bring up because of data and time and crashing computers on foundation.
00:38:18.114 - 00:38:40.560, Speaker A: But I will in the next show if I can find them. So GTFO, short for something. And I thought, look at just the fun. I mean, it was tempting. I've started the show so many times with this gerbil waffle. It was getting tempting once again with a work like this, which is just so much fun. But here we are, just beautiful grass and everything.
00:38:40.560 - 00:39:16.190, Speaker A: Someone screaming at, you know, this monster to get off the lawn. Edition of one at auction for only 20 tezos. Ah, heck. On the scene. So you see how you can recognize almost all the collectors right now. You know, if you have conviction in this scene, it seems like a really good time to buy is kind of how I feel about it. And I could be totally wrong and everything, but I don't feel like there's a ton of competition here other than the kind of, you know, locals, you might say, on tazos.
00:39:16.190 - 00:39:48.082, Speaker A: So a lot of deals to be had out here. Life coach with some writing in the back there. It's a family program, so I won't read it, but just a beautiful distortion and just kind of semi impressionistic digital artwork. Beautifully loosely done work here by hasdrubal waffle, life coach, comma, interestingly, at 48 tezos. So all being put for auction. Here's another one. Deliverance at 20 tezos.
00:39:48.082 - 00:40:08.720, Speaker A: And, ah, heck, also trying to. And so I'm not sure how much time is left, but interesting piece here from waffles. Look at how big it is. And these great teeth are really just awesome. Just awesome. So there are deals to be had out there. Let's see how much time is left in this auction here.
00:40:08.720 - 00:40:38.226, Speaker A: 10 hours and 15 minutes. You still have time. So beautiful work from waffles and Nuff 1914. Continuing to put out these beautiful. After a lot of experimentation we've seen from nuff. And there still is. But it's really interesting to take that experimentation that Nev 1914 has been doing and then ground it back into, like, I'll just do a kind of landscape, so to speak, or a couple of people sitting on a dock, romanticas and bringing that experimentation.
00:40:38.226 - 00:41:29.068, Speaker A: Because what it does is it kind of meets you halfway. You don't need to, like, then all of a sudden, it's almost like in techno, to give a very distant analogy. It's like if you were to mix and mix, and one of the techniques, say, that Jeff mills will do for those that know, is to the techno gets drier and drier and more percussive and harder and less melody and less melody. You know, think of liquid room that mix, volume two or whatever, and then all sudden, then the melody comes in after, you know, and it's like water in the desert. Aesthetically speaking, this is kind of similar. You know, Nuv was pushing it, pushing it very abstract. You can hardly, like, is this a work of art or is this just some lines on a page? And then brings it back to something like this? This is almost like water in the desert.
00:41:29.068 - 00:41:58.550, Speaker A: All of a sudden you've been challenged so hard, then you can go back and you go, this is still super experimental for those that have never seen Nova 19 fourteen's work. But for people who have been following, all of a sudden it's like, oh, this is easy. This is great. Look at how, you know, I could put this on the wall right now. Line extension here has been buying everything. So there are very targeted here owner line extension, which are great buys. I mean, they're still only going for ten days.
00:41:58.550 - 00:42:24.550, Speaker A: Those beautiful bike ride in a landscape. I mean, who knows? But these could be worth fortunes one day. I mean, theoretically, I don't know. But like, these are beautiful veciness. I think you pronounce that line extension so people are kind of able to collect here. Look at how beautiful this is. Like, I mean, this is a stunning work of art.
00:42:24.550 - 00:42:51.774, Speaker A: It's not easy, by the way, for those that are maybe seeing this artist for the first time, for those that have followed this artist, this is actually super easy, way easier than normal. And just gorgeous. Look at this great frame off, green frame and here a couple of mushrooms. So just loving this musical. One of one original artwork for ten tezos. Trippy collector, you know, diving in there just in time. Probably had to be super fast about it.
00:42:51.774 - 00:43:10.830, Speaker A: Line extension. It looks like gardening here. Just gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous work from NUV 1914. I'm going to have to try and connect my kukai walleth. Maybe I'll go through safari because it seemed to be working through another account. Maybe I'll do that. My secret account.
00:43:10.830 - 00:43:27.898, Speaker A: Quote. I put secret in quotes because it's not that secret. Zozo, keeping thoughts from yesterday can give you a bad mood. I prefer moments of happiness, you know. So pretty experimental here. Just awesome work here from Zuozo. So another still interestingly like look.
00:43:27.898 - 00:43:47.710, Speaker A: So very challenging, but still quite delightful work here from Zozo. This is an edition of one for only twelve tezos. And not sure what happened here. Sale. And now for sale again. Not sure what happened there. Looks like still available.
00:43:47.710 - 00:44:03.004, Speaker A: Continuing on. This potion will change. And this is a family program. So this is kudu kola. Interesting. Different kind of work here from kudu kola. Kind of like this 3d sculpting.
00:44:03.004 - 00:44:32.680, Speaker A: I feel like waffles has maybe used and maybe moe s h I t has used this software. Like look at the tree. So almost like this CGI type software, but painted with it, seemingly this on Zora, two minted so far. Interesting piece. Maybe you can guess the artist Martin Bruce with another stunning digital painting here. And you can even see it looks physical here. But then of course, you see other areas and you go, this must be digital.
00:44:32.680 - 00:44:48.116, Speaker A: A great hybrid. Another great hybrid from Martin Bruce. So this is posted yesterday. I don't think we've seen this one. And look at these wild forms. Such an interesting artist. And these beautiful brush strokes.
00:44:48.116 - 00:45:06.486, Speaker A: Gorgeous, provocative, mysterious. Oh, let's see if this works. So I was having issues. We'll see if this loads up. It'd be really unfortunate if it didn't. This is mumble boy. And as you see, these are the kinds of challenges I am running into here.
00:45:06.486 - 00:45:18.422, Speaker A: There may be a few other images. Oh, it showed up. It showed up. Dimensional skewer, one of one for twelve tezos. I'm so glad. Check it out. So again, working kind of physical and digital.
00:45:18.422 - 00:45:38.462, Speaker A: Here is mumble Boyden with a super interesting one of one great color. Kind of has that 1980s kind of neon vibe dimensional Skewer edition of one. Again, twelve tazos. Very cool. Inside a dreamy beach house designed for easy living. I don't think we've seen this. This is from Uri J.
00:45:38.462 - 00:46:03.522, Speaker A: Edition of 15 for ten tazos. And seven are purchased so far. And let's take a closer look. So inside a dreamy beach house, so kind of classic, different kinds of, you know, effects on effects, I believe, from Yuri J. Look at this awesome tv here. You see like the tv light almost looks like a video game. There's that wild hat.
00:46:03.522 - 00:46:17.378, Speaker A: Where's the octopus? That is my only question here. So very cool. Maybe went up the ladder. Just beautiful beach scene. Kind of a nice summer work. May 19, 2024. New work from Yuri J.
00:46:17.378 - 00:47:09.774, Speaker A: Here is LxTxCX VIP club 2003. Kind of a vaporwave net art, kind of fusion, if I had to guess. Also a bit of a print feeling to it from this artist. We've looked at them before and you see some kind of Internet icons there within these kind of interestingly textured, almost as if they're printed out. Kind of, what's the word on pastels, you know, almost like this pastel esque work edition of one and sold to Nicotez collection. And here is Wasteman Goldman Provost, which I think is a someone higher up in the university system, if I'm not mistaken. Kind of a wild, surreal work here with you see kind of the burger from Wasteman gold Minevich.
00:47:09.774 - 00:47:52.410, Speaker A: And we were kind of seeing this thing before, I think so. Interesting experimentation here from Wasteman gold Minovitch with the nose turning into a palm tree at McDonald's at night. Wild one edition of one for 333 tezos from Wasteman gold Minevich, RJ Moon screen. This beautiful work sold for only 30 tezos. So if you're on Tezos right now, deals are to be had. One of these beautiful kind of screensaver RJ works. The color is fabulous and also the composition and this kind of painting of space.
00:47:52.410 - 00:48:17.530, Speaker A: Just love it. 30 tezos. Nice one. Here is Euxine on Zora, I think doing 24 hours mints, I think is what Euxine is doing. Still getting 292. So making a nice, generating some good income there. And here is a figure with a sickle and a cold storage crypto wallet.
00:48:17.530 - 00:48:31.906, Speaker A: And with an angel kind of leading the way here. Perhaps an angel of death. Interesting piece. Zero zero dead. Now on secondary for zero zero. Three unique minters. 193.
00:48:31.906 - 00:48:44.044, Speaker A: So some people buying more. Very interesting. And also copy others. Be ordinary. Also by Euxine. This is only 1150, edition of 66. And let's just make that big.
00:48:44.044 - 00:49:02.408, Speaker A: So interesting. Be ordinary. Axeen and cool work here. Again, nice use of Gif to get different variations of the flame. And then cool, kind of drawing out the pixels and everything. Kind of a looser style. Nice work from Ukxine.
00:49:02.408 - 00:49:33.146, Speaker A: And you see the influence of the zine culture on Uksin, even in the composition here. Or the addition of the four corners there. Only 1150. Pretty reasonable for an Euxine. And here is another work by Euxine, also kind of loosely zine esque magic. And you wonder if this is based on Euxine's older work, and maybe he's animating it and just kind of putting it online for content. You see how well it's working for human boy.
00:49:33.146 - 00:49:52.310, Speaker A: Growing the audience just by putting works. It's not like human boy is putting a link in there. Right? So. But just building this huge audience. Oxyn, another work by Euxine. Kind of looks like the car we saw before. I'm not sure exactly what's going on here, but kind of semi crucifixion.
00:49:52.310 - 00:50:10.250, Speaker A: I don't know what's going on here, but it's pretty funny. Yeah. So. And here, this screams Jack Kirby. This just screams Jack Kirby's fourth world from the 1970s. I feel like I've seen this panel before, even the composition. I do not know, though.
00:50:10.250 - 00:50:24.830, Speaker A: So kind of working with the square kind of brush here. Maybe some spacing in the brush, maybe some effects. Not sure. Nice piece. Zoom in. And then kind of a crypto art style. Eyes with the hose here.
00:50:24.830 - 00:50:48.880, Speaker A: Interesting work from oxine. Here's Ed Marolla, fancy dead dancer. And look at the great textures here on this digital artwork. Kind of. Again, you're starting to see what looks like, especially here, procreate. You know, mixing procreate with digital with maybe aspirite, I'm guessing. Kind of a wild work here.
00:50:48.880 - 00:51:16.118, Speaker A: What's the name of this fancy dead dancer? Interesting. Grab it for you at Tesserart Xyz. So interesting work. Here's another RJ work, wired connection. And this came out May 17. So RJ, back on the scene here and doing some experiments with these kind of outlines that are shimmering outlines here. Got one that's red, one that's green.
00:51:16.118 - 00:51:27.516, Speaker A: And then here it looks like this is not based on another. Usually it's pastiche. Not this time. Here's blue retina. Builders on break. So classic blue retina colors here. Blue and red.
00:51:27.516 - 00:51:55.642, Speaker A: And then kind of almost reminiscent of those kind of 1930s, I think, or 1920s New York shots of people eating lunch high up above New York City. The construction workers. So cool work. Nice texture. Nice piece. This is on object for 29 tezos edition of eleven. And they are sold out at eleven tezos, each now 29 on secondary Suisoichi.
00:51:55.642 - 00:52:12.630, Speaker A: Xperolofine season has taken a while. Just cool experimentation here from sui soichi. And what are we at, 52 minutes? We gotta speed up a bit. Here is Daniel W. Good night. Just a work I hadn't seen before from Daniel W. Just nice black and white work.
00:52:12.630 - 00:52:20.958, Speaker A: Cool. A lot of Daniel W. Characters there. Another black and white work. This is Flora Marquez. Look, mom, four. Shout out to mom.
00:52:20.958 - 00:52:36.446, Speaker A: A ladybug of some kind of strange insect being filmed with a very good macro lens. Beautiful work. Nice black and white work from Flora Marquez. Nice kind of mushroom. Almost looks like the Flora Marquez character. And beautiful. Just drawing here.
00:52:36.446 - 00:53:01.424, Speaker A: Nice black and white work. Kind of looks like an ink drawing. These are older, but I thought I'd add them anyway. A crystal spaceship. I just came across these on X and I just thought they were pretty cool, so why not add them in? So artwork by Julie Rose, whose work I'm sure we've seen before. And this was done in 2022 edition of 100. Still 33 tezos.
00:53:01.424 - 00:53:25.562, Speaker A: Look at how big it is. We have another one. This is also from 2022 edition of 133 tezos on secondary. So cool illustrations from Julie Rose, who goes under crystal spaceship, digital artist between galaxies. Here's Berku or Bairam, the story of red. So cool. Abstract here from Berku or Bayram.
00:53:25.562 - 00:53:39.450, Speaker A: And this is Fortezo's edition of five. Nice abstract. Here's another one. Ruslan Byaltzev GM in the name of art. So this may be older, not sure. Probably cool. Again, what I call the sketchbook style.
00:53:39.450 - 00:54:00.670, Speaker A: Just kind of juxtaposing different iconographies, putting a nice gradient in the background. Just interesting work. Braun with a gorgeous work here. Tropics. And I think this did really well. This was edition of 15 selling out at eight tazos. So nice draw for Braun.
00:54:00.670 - 00:54:38.782, Speaker A: And just a really cool work. We've looked at quite a few works by Braun in the past, so this is 100% and really cool. Just kind of pixel art or pixel abstract art or abstract pixel art is, I think, what we call that datamosh and dithering over stable diffusion. So very interesting. I mean, in theory, you can turn everything into like, kind of pixel art by doing that as the final step in your process, kind of interestingly. And that may be where all of this comes together interestingly. Like maybe by step four, you're not there yet, and then step five kind of brings it all together.
00:54:38.782 - 00:54:50.774, Speaker A: Great color, by the way. Just interesting work. Uri J. With a few more. Some abstracts here. Very interesting abstracts by Yuri J. So here's one.
00:54:50.774 - 00:55:05.816, Speaker A: Look how beautiful that is. Edition of 140 tezos. Here's another one. Puzzle edition of 20 for one tezos. And let's take a closer look. Looks like using some noise. And here, like, I could recognize this easily as a Yuri J.
00:55:05.816 - 00:55:27.554, Speaker A: Without looking at who did it, which is always kind of a good sign, recognizable. And look at these great. All the work that goes into this. Interesting corners there as well. 40 tez edition of one. Here's another edition of one for 49 tez. Tezos.
00:55:27.554 - 00:55:42.578, Speaker A: Almost looks like a palm tree, but not sure. So just interesting abstracts. Great title. The shield of Achilles. That's great. A second line, of course, the shield of Achilles. Is it? An entire book of the Odyssey is based.
00:55:42.578 - 00:56:07.256, Speaker A: Just describes the shield of Achilles. It's been a while since I've read the Odyssey, but I'm pretty sure there's an entire book, if I'm not mistaken, which is quite something, or at least it goes on for pages. What's going on in Achilles Shield. Second line, another interesting work here. So they go really well together as a series, too. Ad owns this one, picked it up for 40 tazos. Nice work.
00:56:07.256 - 00:56:17.900, Speaker A: Here's another one. First line. Uri J. And a green one. And I think still available. So just interesting abstracts from Yuri J. Edition of seven for fortezos.
00:56:17.900 - 00:56:45.010, Speaker A: Here is Santiago. No one can tell you what squirrel core was. And here we have a massive. Another massive work here, I dare. Yeah, that's what I thought. Remember, I was just talking about how the final step can be this kind of pixelation process that seems to be what's going on here, which adds a whole kind of cool dimension to these works. And there are several that Santiago has done.
00:56:45.010 - 00:57:04.154, Speaker A: So this is edition of ten for ten tezos, and already three gone. And here's another one by Santiago. This is May 21. Going to love the colors on this one. And looking like a. What looks like a digital drawing. And again, kind of harkening back to an earlier series of just these marks.
00:57:04.154 - 00:57:19.706, Speaker A: Sunflower. Very nice work. And this, an edition of one, and I think was just transferred. And Kristen Roose, Atari artist. Just love this title. This is another work that could have started this show. There's so much good art, I would argue, that's coming up, coming out.
00:57:19.706 - 00:58:04.248, Speaker A: So Kristen Roose, you know, working a lot with the retro tools or vintage software, and really doing the series paint showcasing different artists software paint programs created with Atari artists for Atari XL XE series computers 1983. This one's quite beautiful. You gotta love the texture on this. And you wonder sometimes how sometimes there's an emulator, sometimes it looks like Kristen Roose has taken photos, which creates a whole other effect of taking photos of these old screens. Here's another one. Kristen Roos, Atari 400 800. This is edition of 89, 75 tezos on secondary.
00:58:04.248 - 00:58:21.332, Speaker A: So doing quite well. Selling out at three tezos each. So bringing in a few hundred tezos, two or 300 tezos. Blazing paddles. Here's another one. Edition of ten. Very cool to have the menus, which Kristin often does in these works.
00:58:21.332 - 00:58:41.316, Speaker A: And you see how wild some of these. Again, blazing paddles is the name of this software. So there's an essay that I highlighted on. That's on Kristin Ruse's website. Here's Fantavision for Apple Iie. Of course, we've seen waffles, hasrubble waffle, as well as bite by Bitde. You did a ton of work on Phantavision.
00:58:41.316 - 00:59:10.134, Speaker A: So here is a black and white work by using FantaVision on the Apple Iie by Kristin Ruse. And again, if you go to Kristin Ruse's website, you'll find a whole essay that showcases almost what looks like a pretty comprehensive list of vintage softwares. Here's Sofia O'Gura. I love this piece. Delorem ipsum. Just a great work here. So original.
00:59:10.134 - 00:59:30.716, Speaker A: Kind of like a drawing. But then you have all this glitchery, this digital glitchery. And texture almost looks like a spy versus spy. You see the verses here of these two characters, wild. And then these interesting characters here. Letters. Just a enigmatic work.
00:59:30.716 - 00:59:52.528, Speaker A: And this is an edition of six for 580. As we hit the 1 hour mark, I need to continue to speed through this muji enigma. Very interesting, surreal artwork. Here steps a sword, maybe an egg, maybe a rock. Some planets in the background. Nice colors, as usual. And then you have like this lava river going through it.
00:59:52.528 - 01:00:06.214, Speaker A: A wild enigma. Indeed it is. And so that was burnt, but there's probably a newer one. RJ, again, echoes. So kind of going back to some earlier series. RJ. Here's screens.
01:00:06.214 - 01:00:37.030, Speaker A: You follow a sound you don't recognize and find a litter of abandoned screens. Could have been. This was also picked up for 30 tezos, by the way, to ox Wes, zero x Wes and edition of one for 30 tezos. So a lot of deals out there. And RJ, of course, going back to a few different series. Interesting maybe works that were just on the computer, you know, you know, that never made it to the final cut at first. And then sometimes that happens, and then you go back and you go, I love this work.
01:00:37.030 - 01:01:00.958, Speaker A: One of my favorites. You know, if that can happen to you. Dandelion. Dandelions. This is brain dead. And so a pixel artwork with fans showing flowers that look like they're on a huge painting in perhaps a museum. And there is a interestingly, kind of like a rope or a guardrail of a certain kind, keeping the fans back.
01:01:00.958 - 01:01:25.468, Speaker A: So I guess this is like fans. So a pun maybe on fans perhaps? Not exactly sure. Cool work from braindead. Edition of 20 for six tazos, 66 tazo cents and a sabden. Again putting out a ton of work here is a beautiful sunset, of course, often working with nature. Sun, moon is the name. Almost looks like an eclipse.
01:01:25.468 - 01:01:41.044, Speaker A: Nine colors posted a day ago. Here's someone else on Instagram. Eight pixel, peaceful day. Just a beautiful pixel artwork as well. Interesting clouds here too. Great color palette here. Another pixel artists, actually.
01:01:41.044 - 01:01:57.286, Speaker A: Two p one and manital. Another collaboration. The perfectionist. Hand pixelated and animated. Original dimensions 171 by 171. Again screams bitcoin. So beautiful work here.
01:01:57.286 - 01:02:17.360, Speaker A: And kind of looks like the William tell with one cat pointing and trying to get the apple. And you're waiting and getting more stressed out there as time goes on. Edition of 30 for three tazos. Here's another one. Green Ginger, contingent to paradise. Interesting title. Kind of looks like a portal of an apopto apocalyptic scene.
01:02:17.360 - 01:02:34.840, Speaker A: Going to somewhere with a little bit nicer weather, that is 250 edition of 15. Here's Renato Marini. Art collab could break the Internet. And so again, some kind of windows 95 type iconography. But then illustrated. So very cool work. Framed.
01:02:34.840 - 01:02:59.084, Speaker A: So interesting piece, kind of broken apart, leaking art collab could break the Internet. That's great. Edition of one for 70 tazos. And here's mo with an interesting pixelated work. Kind of looks like maybe perhaps one of Moe's AI artworks that have just been pixelated out. Interesting experiment here. I quite liked just this kind of hard contrast just interesting to look at.
01:02:59.084 - 01:03:19.070, Speaker A: Here's Pomelo. Let's see. I think no volume here. This is a wild one. So trying to go to the kitchen is the title. Kind of a claustrophobic work. You feel like you're too close, right? But it's almost as if, like, the camera is on the glasses or something.
01:03:19.070 - 01:03:31.530, Speaker A: Just kind of. Again, a claustrophobic. Very interesting artwork from Pomelo. Trying to go to the kitchen. Edition of ten. Two tazos. And it is good.
01:03:31.530 - 01:03:46.650, Speaker A: I'm not doing the spaces today, otherwise I'd have to cut this show off. So you wouldn't believe the hurdles I've had to jump through today. You just would not believe. Anyways, let's continue. Macro matry antenna. Cool work. Very cool work.
01:03:46.650 - 01:04:00.334, Speaker A: So, nice piece. This is on axe from macro matry. Cool title. Lorna Mills. Not sure if that was minted anywhere. So, Lorna Mills, we looked at this work, the other show. It has been minted, though.
01:04:00.334 - 01:04:11.132, Speaker A: Beautiful work. So this is on object now. Just a beautiful work. Love the blue and the blue and the car. I love the subject. I love the masking. Sleeping potion.
01:04:11.132 - 01:04:30.954, Speaker A: Another great title. Again, coming from racehorse names and selling out at 20 tezos. So bringing in 600 tezos. So, still delivering the bread and butter tezos. Right. Silva Santu is two guys, one glitch. And here, uh, an interesting glitch.
01:04:30.954 - 01:04:48.994, Speaker A: Rom, from, uh, silva sand, two shadow warriors nes. Some more interesting glitchroms. Only edition of four. Uh, so interesting small series. Here's someone called over melted buckets. So interesting. So, an artist I don't think I've seen before.
01:04:48.994 - 01:05:10.546, Speaker A: Not sure where I came across this. Uh, so one player, two players. So, again, playing with the welcome screen. So another rom glitch artist and selling out at a Tezos. There's Kyle Flemmer. I think Kyle Flemmer had put up a tweet of. And here, let me see if we can get a better.
01:05:10.546 - 01:05:26.230, Speaker A: I'm taking a risk here by, because this might not load up at all. Here we go. I think Kyle Flemmer put out a tweet thread, which wasn't loading up. I was trying. Look at how cool this is. I think this is Armilk. Love the music.
01:05:26.230 - 01:05:44.778, Speaker A: Super fun. Beautiful. Kind of looks like it's using a few different processes. Processes. This doesn't look like one software. It looks like it's using a few different processes. It's looking great.
01:05:44.778 - 01:06:06.636, Speaker A: That's rmilk 88. Catch a little sketch of my mind. Very cool. That looks ready to go. Francois Gamma CL's two who's been putting out a lot of interesting kind of experimental pixel artwork. I mean experimental as usual, but still like not typical Francois gamma work, at least that I've seen. So another really interesting piece.
01:06:06.636 - 01:06:32.130, Speaker A: Love the direction edition of 31 for three tezos. Here's a Renki who continues to keep it original here. Continues to dazzle Reinke's fans and viewers. Just another interesting one edition of one not listed yet as typically Renki does. Senda edition of one also not listed. So another one, a little bit more texture in this one. Or digital texture.
01:06:32.130 - 01:06:58.776, Speaker A: So cool work. Black and white and gray and very cool. Nicholas Assun. Stillness kind of has almost a renaissance type composition here. And you see this almost grand Canyon type, you know, landscape and this beautiful cycling textured color here and there. It looks like a mountain in the background. So another landscape, interesting kind of framing device from Nicholas Sassoon.
01:06:58.776 - 01:07:10.616, Speaker A: 8000 views. Pretty good. 67 retweets. Here's Datura with some new work and let's see if we can make that bigger. Well, we sure can. Look at this. So that worked out well.
01:07:10.616 - 01:07:29.700, Speaker A: So Datura and this is on Instagram. And here's a still so very cool orc here. Rain zero six. This is part of that art show we were seeing before a comparts. The computer art here is Kiro. Spy versus spy. Maybe we looked at this one.
01:07:29.700 - 01:07:45.678, Speaker A: Or this is a different version of spy versus spy. So this is on foundation. Look at how minimal this is. I love this minimal kind of glitch work. There's something quite poetic about it. So this is on base. Here's another one, less minimal.
01:07:45.678 - 01:08:08.752, Speaker A: Agriculture I'm assuming is the name. I'm not sure if this is full resolution or not. It's probably not. This may be, but it could be that maybe I'm again using the phone for Internet. So some of these files we may be stretching my phone to capacity here. Another beautiful, what I'd call video painting from Curo. So cool work here.
01:08:08.752 - 01:08:23.480, Speaker A: What is that called? Dripov. So cool work there. Here's another one. Audio muted. Is there audio? No audio. So again, kind of minimal colors. So all sorts of different works, unfortunately.
01:08:23.480 - 01:08:39.297, Speaker A: Again, I think we're on low resolution here. That could be my phone. That could also be foundation, which maybe does progressive loading there. And here's one more. So cool. Different kind of artworks. It's funny how you can't tell if it's low resolution.
01:08:39.297 - 01:09:02.216, Speaker A: I assume it is, but I'm not positive. So cool work here from Kiro across the board. And here's another one. This is also on bass, so all sorts of really cool experimentation. Now this, let's see if this loads up. This is a tricky one, because it's, I believe, if I remember. Oh, no, this is not the one I'm thinking of.
01:09:02.216 - 01:09:12.696, Speaker A: This is cool, though. This is that pinball guy. Great texture in here. Cool work, I just thought. Super original. You kind of have some text in here. Different kind of digital.
01:09:12.696 - 01:09:40.615, Speaker A: Looks like mixing, maybe exporting ASCII by TPG by the pinball guy edition of one for 20 tezos. Very interesting piece. Here's Klaus on Zora. So, of course, we followed Klaus, you know, over 200 compositions. And now on Zora. I'm not going to kill my phone data because it might cost me, like, $2 just to load this. And we've shown probably a hundred of Klaus works recently.
01:09:40.615 - 01:10:00.166, Speaker A: Anyways, Klaus is on Zora. So cool. It's cool how, again, I close is bringing a different format to a new blockchain, you know, not doing the exact same series, which I think is really cool. Ripple ball. Cool title. And let's continue. This is the one that I'm not sure is going to load by Louie.
01:10:00.166 - 01:10:21.114, Speaker A: This is a 3d sculpture, which tends to be pretty heavy files. So we'll see if this loads up. We'll give it just a couple of seconds. It may not load up. And again, this is probably costing me, but it could show up at any moment here. Again, the rent is excessive. It's too bad.
01:10:21.114 - 01:10:44.518, Speaker A: Maybe if I click on Louis profile, we can see it's small, a few kind of interesting. I think it's one of these. These are pretty cool. So again, yeah, unfortunately, yeah, it's not loading up. Okay. So sorry about that, Louie. Continuing on, Sulkian.
01:10:44.518 - 01:11:15.150, Speaker A: Look at what Sulkian is doing. I think true face was saying how wonderfully weird Sulkian is. And indeed, Sulkian is one of the, you know, strangest, bizarre artists. Physical distortions, transmissions, and you really see it here. Just a wild artist. Skomra, this looks like AI with some cart. You know, animation meets AI or illustration meets kind of AI, textures, kind of almost pixelated AI.
01:11:15.150 - 01:11:46.900, Speaker A: Pretty interesting sketching from lily illo. Has a really nice physical feeling. You know what I'd love to see is an actual sketch. Like, I wonder if that's what this is. Is this AI or not? Because if this is actual, it's hard to tell these days, but if this is actually physical work, how cool would that be? I would find that incredibly powerful. And it's incredibly powerful as it is. But imagine, like, handcrafted, based on AI.
01:11:46.900 - 01:12:09.590, Speaker A: Amazing. Strange thing. Interesting title here. Or quote, art is the most intense mode of individualism that the world has known. Probably true. And here is the work by strange thing with these beautiful textures and colors and. And this gardener here, this Renaissance gardener chopping out GM out of the plant.
01:12:09.590 - 01:12:30.072, Speaker A: Here's a work by Mikey Wilson with what looks like a young Bob Dylan. Hard to say. Kind of nice and painterly. I ain't going to work on Arthur's farm no more. So I think a reference to Bob Dylan, who looks like is, wow, look at how huge this is. Look at how huge. So clearly, AI, when you zoom in, amazing.
01:12:30.072 - 01:12:43.976, Speaker A: Five tezos is the price, as you can tell from the guitar. And also their edition of 15. And some nice works by ilay. Look at this. Let's see if this loads up. Beautiful AI artwork. AI paintings from Ilay.
01:12:43.976 - 01:13:01.950, Speaker A: Still life. Here's another one. Just beautiful, beautiful work. Here's another one by Santiago. A bright memory, but at what cost? So interesting. Another kind of wild AI artwork from Santiago. I believe this is AI Png art.
01:13:01.950 - 01:13:32.164, Speaker A: And here's Sarah Kretschmer flamobster edition of ten for eight tazos. And on the market here, beautiful kind of work with this beautiful chrome, kind of flamingo lobster. I guess that's where the title comes from. So shout out to Sarah Kretschmer if she is watching this. 12,000 by 12,000. Another huge AI work, these upscalers. We were discussing that a little bit in depth with clownvamp last week.
01:13:32.164 - 01:13:59.338, Speaker A: Super interesting machine with another super interesting work. I assume this is AI mixed with, like, photo collage. I think this is AI. I'm not positive, though. So just really cool work with what looks like machine skateboarding or roller skating, who knows what on this wave surfing. These are brilliant. As we were discussing a big shout out to machine.
01:13:59.338 - 01:14:24.894, Speaker A: Thank you for the retweet there. I think that show with machine at the start may be the most popular show in terms of views on X that I've ever. It was around 27, 28,000 views. That was pretty big, pretty high for this show. Ilya Barabin. So this is with fake whale, who actually, I need to put a workout for this Internet thing has slowed me down enormously. So interesting piece here.
01:14:24.894 - 01:14:46.140, Speaker A: What's this called? Street photography. Aggressor and photographer. So here is one work, and yes, that's on object.com. here is walk paper magazine. Kind of looks like a meme of some kind with these brilliant, brilliant execution. Of walk, as usual. And here is Stefan Schwarzer.
01:14:46.140 - 01:15:10.310, Speaker A: Screen print. Polychromos on paper. So is this a screen print? Because you can do screen printing that. That small. But it's pretty tricky. Or at least it requires a lot of kind of accuracy and technical ability to do this kind of four color screen printing. Cmyk screen printing.
01:15:10.310 - 01:15:28.268, Speaker A: I think this is a screen print. Stefan Schwartzer, of course, put out a bunch of Rizzo prints recently. Check this out. Guerrero gallery, another interesting gallery. Honk if you love adult contemporary. I guess they had a show called adult contemporary, which is hilarious. Abandoned track, acrylic on abandoned truck.
01:15:28.268 - 01:15:45.828, Speaker A: Acrylic on canvas. Look at this. So I assume that's acrylic paint, not acrylic ink. So pretty cool work here. So, you know, a. Looks like a painting of pixelation. Adel Berger.
01:15:45.828 - 01:15:58.998, Speaker A: We've looked at their work before. Always two tigers. Just really beautiful. Kind of the sketchbook style. A little bit of space in there. Kind of a coherent interior here, but then kind of sketchbooky on top. Beautiful.
01:15:58.998 - 01:16:22.030, Speaker A: Just the noise, the painting, the whimsicality, just the non finito, the different media. Awesome. And speaking of awesome, look at moto 583. Moto moto hero. These faces. I don't know how this artist is able to work so simply, yet so powerfully. And just these simple juxtapositions, outrageous and beautiful.
01:16:22.030 - 01:16:42.790, Speaker A: I mean, they're beautiful illustrations here. So just great work. As we continue, here's Enrique Hermes, Bondozo Bandido, save the forest, hate the machines. Just incredibly prolific artist here. And just does not care in terms of. I'll just put some big eyes here. Wild.
01:16:42.790 - 01:17:00.950, Speaker A: And then looks like a big caterpillar machine. Here's a really cool work. It's not gallery Paul Robus. And it looks like a bunsen burner, all in blue, blue flames. Just beautiful work. Hulk Hogan by Kristen land. And a very textured painting.
01:17:00.950 - 01:17:18.820, Speaker A: I don't know how you get so textured. It almost looks like. Look at this. So it's almost like the texture is done first. It almost reminds me of art matter, where the texture is done first, and then you kind of paint over top. So it looks like it was kind of textured before, but not positive on that. But it kind of looks that way.
01:17:18.820 - 01:17:40.872, Speaker A: Like painted. Like a painted over painting is actually what that looks like. Hulk Hogan here. A controversial one by Michael Pybus. Or provocative, shall we say? Almost looks like Mario in there with the cactus coming out of the little plant or the plant coming out of the pot. And, of course, probably referring to 911. So very provocative work there.
01:17:40.872 - 01:17:58.144, Speaker A: And finally, another one from Guerrero gallery. Another great find, this gallery. Henry Faye, Lucille. So Topps, of course, the trading card company. And yeah, like acrylic on panel. So pretty wild work here. Here's another one.
01:17:58.144 - 01:18:16.026, Speaker A: A thousand loaded. And you see up close. So pretty wild. I'm not quite sure. I assume this is just kind of treating acrylic kind of like watercolors a little bit, I assume is what's going on here. Pretty original work from that artist. And that is your show.
01:18:16.026 - 01:18:37.660, Speaker A: My friends, thank you for joining me. And yes, no spaces today. I am trying to just stay on top of everything, put out a show today, period, with all of the Internet issues and other issues, computer, you name it, wallet and more. So thanks for your patience. Thank you for joining me. Hope to put everything back on schedule soon. Hope to show up on Friday.
01:18:37.660 - 01:18:43.920, Speaker A: Don't be shocked if, for whatever reason, it's not there, but I'm pretty sure I will be. Till next time, take care.
