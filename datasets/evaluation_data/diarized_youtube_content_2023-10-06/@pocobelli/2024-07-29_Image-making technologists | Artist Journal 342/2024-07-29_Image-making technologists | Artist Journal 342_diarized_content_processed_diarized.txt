00:00:04.040 - 00:00:29.060, Speaker A: Volume up, not down. Welcome back, everybody. A new week, a new journey to the center of the mind, as they said in the 1960s. That wonderful band, was it the 13th floor elevators? One day we will find out, but not today. Artist journal, July 29, 2024. Broadcasting from a beautiful sunny day in Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pokebelly.
00:00:29.060 - 00:00:49.000, Speaker A: Getting over a bit of a cold, as you can hear. Just a mini cold. You gotta be grateful for those rather than a mega eyes. A little bloodshot on the left there. So just so you know, just so in case. In case, you know, questions arise. So let's see if we can make this a shorter show.
00:00:49.000 - 00:01:20.876, Speaker A: I am optimistic as ever. Martin Bruce. We saw the preview of this work. This is the finished work, and I hope you can see it. If you look closely, you can see a bit of a glitch, right? You can see. We saw, I think, the still a preview and of course, a gif made up of, you know, this one, if I had to guess, maybe 25 frames, you know, vaguely that are all in sequence, making a kind of movie of sorts. But it's its own format.
00:01:20.876 - 00:01:37.404, Speaker A: Gifdem. Some people pronounce it jiff. I pronounce it gif. It is a bit of an ongoing Internet debate for our Internet show. We have to touch on it. So all to say here is Martin Bruce. We often look at his.
00:01:37.404 - 00:02:05.418, Speaker A: We look at almost everything Martin puts out, actually. And I was slow to appreciate Martin's work. Admittedly, when I first saw it, I thought it was kind, you know, like, look at it. It's. I mean, it's so you and I would argue, and we're actually going to come to this a little later in the show. It's so unique that it's a bit of an acquired taste. But once you see it again, it's kind of.
00:02:05.418 - 00:02:51.170, Speaker A: You can't unsee the thinking process. But just as we had him on the space, it's hard to put into words what he's actually doing, other than, as I was calling it, I think in a previous episode, this is visual thinking. He thinks with his eyes. Like, to me, that is the key to understanding Martin Bruce's work. It's intuitive, as came up in the space after 45 minutes of us trying to, you know, punch our way through, so to speak, metaphorically, to what Martin is doing and making no progress. And finally is like. It's like you're there is the reason we can't put reason on what Martin's doing is because he's thinking with his eyes.
00:02:51.170 - 00:03:16.184, Speaker A: He's visually, he's thinking visually. And easier said than done. I mean, how often, you know, if you've ever made an image, most people have. You're kind of thinking, okay, I'm going to do this, I'm going to do that. There's a lot of reasoning. There's a lot of reasoning in my work, even when there's unreason, you might say, or non reason or whatever you want to call it. So that's, I would argue, the key.
00:03:16.184 - 00:04:01.668, Speaker A: And so he lets the eyes do the talking, so to speak, or he lets the image is another way of putting it, do the talking. And, you know, you just look at the subject matter. Like, just, for example, if we very quickly here try and understand, like, describe this piece for someone who can't see it, could you do it right? I mean, there's a candles, I think he calls a candle bra, right? A couple of candles, you know, almost like a Gerhard Richter work. But in Kaller, you remember the candles. Okay. You know, I'd say almost a light. I wonder if Martin is doing a very, very light reference here to Gerhard Richter.
00:04:01.668 - 00:04:33.854, Speaker A: I don't know. It could be completely accidental. So what else? And then we have a bit of a kitchen table with a background green, and then, okay. And there's kind of like this cat porcelain statue, and it's kind of fuzzy and it's kind of snowy. And we haven't even got to whatever the heck this thing is or what is on the bottom. Right. We're almost back to this idea, which we saw with Yuri J, which actually we're going to see an update on.
00:04:33.854 - 00:05:36.958, Speaker A: Can you make a Yuri J? Can AI make a Yuri J? If Yuri J. Didn't exist? We're kind of back to that here as well. Could AI make a Martin Bruce if Martin Bruce didn't exist? And, you know, to me, that kind of, it shows the limits of AI and really what artists still have to offer. It's not over for artists by any stretch, and it's not even close. One could argue, can AI visually think like this? I'm sure it can, but maybe not like this far, maybe not this intuitively. Hard to say, but I kind of doubt it, actually, because, I mean, again, what are we seeing in the bottom right corner here? Like, you know, again, if you don't make art or if you're not even really thinking about it, like, I wasn't really thinking about it till now. You look at the image and you, like, imagine making this decision, like, in even the shape of this decision.
00:05:36.958 - 00:06:32.420, Speaker A: Like, this is what I would call an outrageous decision. Who would ever keep that in their work? And that is part of the magistrate of Martin Bruce's work, I would argue it's outrageous in so many ways. The decisions, like, what do you mean? You're gonna have within this, you know, tableau, some sort of snake that's almost coming apart here made of a sampled brush. And then you just put a little kind of happy face, really cool looking snake, by the way, on the table. Right? Like it's so irrational, but it holds together visually almost delicately. And then putting the little kind of snow, if you can see the whole. It's kind of animation without animation, as I like to call it.
00:06:32.420 - 00:07:09.312, Speaker A: The image is moving like a glitch, but there's nothing happening, so to speak. It's not like a Disney movie animation. This is just adding life, you might say, of a certain kind dynamism, of a certain kind movement to the image again. And then, I don't even know, I guess that's a plate with this almost green in there. So just really cool. Martin Bruce starting the newspaper of the imagination for the week. And here it's on a comparts is.
00:07:09.312 - 00:07:21.184, Speaker A: And I think we've seen a couple of things. I'm not sure if they have a show. I feel like we've seen this page before. Right. Current price 0.5 eth and I. There are no bids yet.
00:07:21.184 - 00:07:41.390, Speaker A: Estimate is 0.3. Interesting how they put the estimate. And here you see Martin Bruce. I think he was in Portugal. He was either Spain or Portugal. I think he was in Portugal when we talked to him. Martin Bruce is an artist whose naive blend of traditional and digital art has created a fascinating world of visual exploration.
00:07:41.390 - 00:08:05.584, Speaker A: His journey from the physical brush to the digital realm reveals an intention unafraid to cross boundaries. So true, innovative, engaging body of work that invites us to explore uncharted territories of digital aesthetics. Couldn't agree more. So nice write up there for Martin Bruce on a compart. And here, looks like other parts of the show. That looks pretty rad. Juana Pedro there, Datura.
00:08:05.584 - 00:08:35.754, Speaker A: Awesomely so. Very cool, very cool. The digital art journey continues. So thank you for all the comments last episode, I tell you this for me, only for me. Maybe for me, maybe only for me. But this kind of breakthrough, this was a total breakthrough for me personally. This idea that we came up with on the air, kind of the beauty of doing this, you know, quote unquote live.
00:08:35.754 - 00:09:28.354, Speaker A: It's recorded, but recorded basically live. The beauty of doing this is, you know, you can come across you do enough shows, you come across some pretty interesting ideas, and this was one of them. This idea of art as technology, it really resonates with me. As some people mentioned in the comments. It seemed to resonate with some other people, too, because to me, it almost brings home what it is we're doing. And what was the it almost, it's like we're image making, you know, technologists, like, we're inventors of a kind of tech of what you could define as a technology that makes images a process. And, you know, what is an artist? Someone with a process.
00:09:28.354 - 00:10:01.054, Speaker A: Look at anybody in the museum. Georgia O'Keeffe, Andy Warhol, Leonardo da Vinci, any impressionists, you go through the whole rigmarole. What are, you know, what makes an artist an artist? And I'd argue what makes an artiste an artist is they have a process, and it's probably unique to them. That's why they're famous. That's why they're in the museum. They brought this novel image making technology to the fore. It works in various, you know, contexts.
00:10:01.054 - 00:10:39.372, Speaker A: You can do portraits with this technology. You can do landscapes with this technology. You can do all sorts of things with this technology. And the fact, you know, the most obvious thing sitting right in front of our eyes, I would argue, is that the word techne means art. And it's like, you know, so again, like, it's, of course, that is what we're doing. Like we are, I would argue, just like, you know, technologists of sorts, inventors is maybe a better kind of like, of course, artists are inventors. They're invent inventors of images.
00:10:39.372 - 00:11:15.656, Speaker A: But maybe more importantly, what they're inventing from a technological point of view, they're inventing processes just like a jet engine takes. You know, you need a chip, you need, like, the fan to move the engine. You know, you need. All of these little technologies go in to make a jet engine. I'm rereading the nature of technology, which maybe we bring up here at some point, but all to say to me, this is a complete breakthrough. It's totally brought clarity. Let's see how we're doing in two weeks, and maybe let's see if there's any response to that.
00:11:15.656 - 00:11:58.752, Speaker A: That's kind of like, well, actually not so much, Adrian. But to me, this really has brought clarity to what I am doing as an artist. You're basically an inventor of image making technologies, I would argue. And Steve Jobs, I mean, it's another way of looking at this. Is, what is Steve Jobs? Is he an artist? I think he considered himself an artist. It's just utilitarian art. But is a Mac or an apple iie, you see that object, especially with plugged in and on with Ultima four on it? And are we gonna say that's not like a kind of art or that's not poetic? I'm sure he thought it was right.
00:11:58.752 - 00:12:38.370, Speaker A: So, you know, finally on this point, it's something which I brought up, you know, what's the difference between, many times the difference between a website and a painting? You know, painting incorporates what we might call poetic elements, which oftentimes are irrational or speak to human nature, association. Whatever's going on in Martin Bruce's work, that is not, you know, a website, that is something that's, you know, but that's not to say it's not utilitarian, I would argue, but let's not go back into that whole debate. So anyways, let's go to the comments here. Let's look. Thank you for the wonderful comments all around. Very thoughtful here. Echo Textile studio, great show again.
00:12:38.370 - 00:13:10.836, Speaker A: Thank you. Adrian, your artistic and journalistic educated opinion on this channel are important for many reasons, pointed out by all kinds of people here. Thank you. A very nice thing to say. My selfish interest lays with learning about the economic aspects of this industry, which you inspire. It's pretty exciting, you know, again, like, if you have any artistic ambitions, you have to be here. It's sort of like what I tell everybody, you know, my real world friends, one is trying to actually get me down for a meeting so I can set them up with wallets and whatever.
00:13:10.836 - 00:13:39.204, Speaker A: And so to that person's credit, Bob the photographer, aka Roberto, so hopefully he comes online. So I'll just say, yeah, awesome. Can't wait to get my first digital art account soon and purchase some of your art too. Well, very nice of you to say. And thrilled, thrilled to have you here and can't wait to see it. Ecotextile, really nice comment here. Terry visual of the legendary and renowned Kurt Hussle collective.
00:13:39.204 - 00:13:59.686, Speaker A: KHC. Great feature and topic. It appears as though rodeo, the new digital art platform, are adopting a similar approach to Spotify, which everyone knows is a horribly flawed system. I thought this was a great analogy. You know, where you get like $0.10, you know, listen, or whatever. The case is probably a penny on Spotify, if that.
00:13:59.686 - 00:14:52.520, Speaker A: I mean, what do you get? The only people benefiting from this are the creators of the app and to a lesser degree, and the consumers leaving the artists in the wind, despite the fact it would be nothing without their contribution. Rodeo is new and I really hope that they have a better plan than mirroring a kind of one way benefit system behavior. But from what I'm seeing and reading, it's not looking too positive. As someone that dedicates a majority of their time to creation and as a result is not financially stable, which I accepted long ago when following this path, this really hits a nerve with me. I mean, yeah, I don't like, and I don't say it with judgment because I've never used rodeo, but I genuinely don't understand why people would mint there if it's true that you get about seventeen cents a minute. Because why won't you just put your art on object or zora is kind of what I ask myself. Like, I don't know why people are doing it.
00:14:52.520 - 00:15:06.046, Speaker A: Maybe again, maybe it's this idea. Well, I'll expose myself to new collectors, which is legitimate. Actually. It's a legitimate path forward. So maybe it's just this idea. Maybe rodeo. I don't even know, like in the.
00:15:06.046 - 00:15:33.898, Speaker A: I find the name a little odd to be honest. So anyway, not to be too hard on rodeo, but I, you know, but I'm not like necess. I don't understand why people meant there and put it this way. And I think this is going to come up in a later tab. But remember, zero one right on avalanche. Like are people still using it? Not, you know, not very much. Like there's this big movement and it's like all like oh, it's all about trading and the, you know.
00:15:33.898 - 00:16:03.082, Speaker A: And then. So people trade arth all fine and good. But ultimately, as I keep saying here, the mantra, the beating heart of this scene is the fact that people is. It's a free market and people get paid for their art. That is why it's so, that's why it works. I would argue as you know why is echo textile studio for the interest lays with the economic aspects. Of course, who doesn't want to make money from their art so.
00:16:03.082 - 00:16:15.354, Speaker A: Totally. I thought that was a great analogy. Terry visual it's super awesome to hear from you. I have so much more to say on this topic, but I'll hold out here. Awesome. Great show. Is always a nice one for the feature on the last video.
00:16:15.354 - 00:16:35.068, Speaker A: Just huge fans of these guys. Awesome. Okay, let's continue. What is the full name of the artist? Santiago. I didn't know it speaks to. I was thinking to myself, it's almost 80 or 90% anonymous accounts and I don't know if Santiago is an anonymous account. Maybe he just doesn't put his last name right.
00:16:35.068 - 00:17:10.160, Speaker A: I don't put my first name in my account. I think most people that watch the show, I announce it here every time I start the show. But where you can find his work is on object.com. also, you know where I would go? I would go to X and go to Santiago's account. But I believe it's neymarks. Kind of like the famous soccer player. Let me just actually see if I can bring up Santiago's account here at knee.
00:17:10.160 - 00:17:30.030, Speaker A: Maybe if I put Santiago. Here we go. This is the account neymrqz. And then from here you'll get the super rare. And you should also, if you go to the link. Here you go. Go to the link tree, you get the object, the Zora.
00:17:30.030 - 00:17:56.440, Speaker A: So yeah, if you like Santiago's work, that's how you get there. I'd go to X or put a search on object. Let's continue here. My first thought was, this was edgy is a wild thing to say if you've ever been to any gallery art space. So referring to Santiago's work here again, that we started to, I believe this is the work that is being referred to. My first thought. So this is Dame Aziz.
00:17:56.440 - 00:18:47.440, Speaker A: If I'm pronouncing that right, my first thought was, this is edgy is a wild thing to say if you've ever been to any gallery art space, collage, college, all of the above. Because while Santiago's work is nice, it really isn't pushing any artistic boundaries that I haven't seen explored for the past quarter century, at least. I always appreciate people talking about art and love and love that it feels meaningful to you to discuss it. But I can't help but feel you could push your own discussions of your work, of the work you are looking at. So this is a journal, by the way. So these are just passing thoughts. I'm not trying to do some, you know, be all, end all analysis on the works of.
00:18:47.440 - 00:19:29.942, Speaker A: In a sense, kind of, as I always say here, even regarding to philosophy, I always start with the work and does the work work, so to speak. Does the piece work on a reptilian level on my brain? Does it do whatever that thing is? I usually know within half a second, maybe faster. So I don't know why certain works. And then I begin from there and then I discuss and whatever, but, you know, you know, to the point of. But I am not about. I talk about what I want to talk about in a sense, as far as the work, I don't I almost think I talk too much about it. I don't think there's much to say is actually what I would also say.
00:19:29.942 - 00:20:06.168, Speaker A: I say there's the way it's being made, a little bit of historical context. What's it similar to? You know, other artists in the scene and in previous times. And I don't think there's really, like, when people put out, like, three or four or ten page document on a painting, like, are you reading that? I'm not reading that. And I actually think it's maybe not that necessary. It's about the work. It's not about the writing or the speech associated with the work, I would argue. I'm just kind of pointing it out on, isn't this cool? Isn't that cool? So let's continue here.
00:20:06.168 - 00:20:38.472, Speaker A: For example, the article you brought up that you said was part of the tradition of Santiago's work was an article discussing indigenous work and the actual tradition around its creation that draws from centuries of other indigenous artists and how they relate to the abstract movement. And I did point that out that it was indigenous work. So that's not news. All I was saying was, look at the similarity here. Isn't it kind of funny? I just kind of. I came across it. I said, oh, interesting similarity.
00:20:38.472 - 00:21:11.482, Speaker A: To me, it's important. And it feels weird to ignore the major element when comparing two works together. Let me just see if I miss something here. And how they. So was discussing indigenous work and the actual tradition around its creation that draws from centuries of other indigenous artists and how they relate to the abstract movement. And it feels weird to ignore that major element when comparing two works together. I guess what I am saying is that your discussions feel like a very shallow reading of the work, and they are both abstract art.
00:21:11.482 - 00:21:38.142, Speaker A: And quote is like saying they both have red in them. Yeah, I think that's unfair, to be honest. Yeah. Again, I'm not forcing anybody to watch this either. I'm just sharing similarities here. This is a journal. And, you know, and frankly, you know, this beginning passage here, where are your examples? Like, I don't agree with any of this.
00:21:38.142 - 00:22:05.700, Speaker A: You say this is like, this is a. This is a wild thing to say, that Santiago's work is edgy. If you've ever been to any gallery, I mean, I probably go to galleries like three or four times a week. It's what you do out here in Berlin. I don't know how many you're going to. And as far as museums, I mean, really artsy. So you think, just to be clear and in all, good fun here.
00:22:05.700 - 00:22:47.210, Speaker A: But you think this work, and let me just bring it up here, which has other works seemingly in the past, digital past, part two, as I am calling it here, with all of this AI in it, you think this has been done for the last 25 years? Like, so I challenge you. Show me an example. You haven't listed a single name here of who. It's like, who is it? Like, what work is what I would say. Let's continue. For me, part of art is questioning it. Okay? It doesn't make you a traditionalist or anything to question the intentionality of purpose of a piece.
00:22:47.210 - 00:23:49.778, Speaker A: But the issue, maybe this is the heart of the issue here, but the issue with AI work is that it can't answer those questions because it doesn't have a reason. So my sense from this comment is, actually, you don't like this work or you think it's not pushing any boundaries because it's AI, whereas, yeah, that doesn't seem, you know, this is the new technology, I would argue, you know, so therefore, for you to ignore AI, how, you know, it's a legitimate path. But to attack someone for AI work, I assume that's what's going on here seems a little basically rich. I'd be interested to see how your discussions evolve in the future. But right now, I feel like they are really coming up against that issue, which is still unclear, that I'm not going deep enough, I guess. Again, I have a completely different view, actually. I'm not the kind of person that wants to read three pages or hear half an hour about an artwork.
00:23:49.778 - 00:24:11.500, Speaker A: I think it's inappropriate. It's like, quote Hegel there. It's like it's about the art. It's not about what someone, half the time, if not 80 or 90% of the time, you read art criticism. It's about kind of making that person sound smart. It's not about actually helping you understand the work that kind of criticism does. Existential.
00:24:11.500 - 00:24:38.380, Speaker A: And there's a place for it. I'm not a critic, okay? I'm an artist talking about art and saying, wow, check this out. This is a journal. Okay? So. And it feels like you're coming. Like I'm just accepting this without any of the digging and development that comes with actually developing a new style of art. So again, give me some specifics here to, you know, dame Aziz.
00:24:38.380 - 00:25:14.444, Speaker A: I want specifics of how this has been being done for the last 25 years. So obviously, because of the. I'm actually surprised I haven't gotten more pushback, actually, on my aesthetic, you know, curatorial and the discussion of my art, you know, it's pretty amazing. Episode 300 4341 actually, how little pushback there's been, fascinatingly, because the development of art actually comes from not accepting it. I mean, again, massive generalization here. It's a combination. Let's hear what the person says.
00:25:14.444 - 00:26:08.800, Speaker A: And I'll continue from saying, essentially, the way it has always been made is stupid. And I can do something else. Like, this is how art develops. And I mean, this is a massive overgeneralization. If you go to ts eliot, what is a tradition in the individual talented? And this constant, you know, where he explains, there's this constant negotiation really, between the tradition and doing something new. And in order to be a part of the tradition, if you start having zero reference to what's going on, even Warhol rejecting, let's say, abstract expressionism in favor, let's say, of these graphic design things, he's still putting the drip, he's still putting painterliness. It's still almost about the surface of the canvas, but he's redoing, he's putting different kinds of iconography and saying, eh, you know, check that out.
00:26:08.800 - 00:26:42.918, Speaker A: So I don't agree with this. This is a very overgeneralized, I would actually oversimplifying the situation, I would argue. So regardless of whether people accept or not and changes, more people look at it and critique and put their own spin on it. Less acceptance and more inspiration. So we're not inspired over here. So I have to disagree with all of this. You know, what it reminds me of was that tweet that came out that was attacking the object website as being like this terrible UI and how unfair all the curators were.
00:26:42.918 - 00:27:20.304, Speaker A: And I was like, I don't agree with a single part of this tweet. I didn't even show it because I thought it was like, this is, this is not about objectival, and I don't think this is about this show. That would be my kind of semi sick kind of assessment, semi ill assessment of that comment. But anyways, thank you for the comment and always feel free to respond and leave examples, you know, leave examples of how we've seen this work here a billion times over in the last 25 years. Let's continue. Chus anonymous hotline juice, of course, is goodbye in German. Great one today.
00:27:20.304 - 00:27:36.626, Speaker A: Just listen while making lunch. Thank you. A very nice comment, trippy collector. Oh yes, this Santi piece is so perfect for the opener. Indeed. I was very happy with how the work worked with the title Santi again, technologists here. Cuompa, the great cwampa.
00:27:36.626 - 00:27:50.400, Speaker A: Another great one. Want to have a tea with chupacabra sometime? That's hilarious. I need to. I don't even know what a chupacabra is, but I was mentioning that Filippo Francocci. Great show, Adrian. I'm actually a fan of the long form, Matt. No need to shorten it, in my opinion.
00:27:50.400 - 00:28:14.938, Speaker A: Well, I think if I can just get it to like 45 minutes to an hour, it's kind of like, what do they call it? It's a compromise I'm willing to make, you know, with myself, so to speak. John Cates. Love the end of this ep's title. Love this eP's title. Thanks, John. Awesome artist rodeo. Seems like, you know, John's like that.
00:28:14.938 - 00:28:34.226, Speaker A: Maybe John Cates should just use the rodeo platform because at least he's doing the western glitch. At least it fits rodeo. And I think he is using it, actually. So anyways, awesome to hear from John Gates. Really cool guy out of Taiwan, American in Taiwan. Dropkick pop. Awesome to hear from you, August ground.
00:28:34.226 - 00:28:45.898, Speaker A: Ubuhua, of course. Alfred Jahri's play, Ubuhua knows. Luciana Guerra. Awesome to hear from you, Gonadji. Awesome to hear from you, John Cates. I think you may already love gumby. Life as a mister.
00:28:45.898 - 00:28:58.610, Speaker A: E by paper rad. Pretty cool, cool drawing here. Almost digital illustration. Pretty wild. Unusual K's works. Oyeni Oyeniyi coyote. It's that time again.
00:28:58.610 - 00:29:08.618, Speaker A: Time to settle down for a great watch. Thank you. And I think we have a work in the community chrome void. Thank you for linking to color. Color. August ground. Between the thought and act lies the shadow.
00:29:08.618 - 00:29:23.040, Speaker A: Maybe Ezra pound, right? Or like Lou Reed was saying, between thought and expression lies a lifetime. But maybe Ezra pound. There lies the shadow. August ground. Julian Janes. Ah, yes. Those voices in your head aren't gods at all, honey.
00:29:23.040 - 00:29:38.820, Speaker A: Yeah, radical theory. When we have more time. Oh, I hope we come back. We need to do a chat. GPT on Julian Janes theory of the voice in our head, where it comes from. Santiago, great to hear from you on the COVID of artist journal. Not a news show.
00:29:38.820 - 00:29:49.880, Speaker A: 341, thanks so much. Poco, awesome. Great to hear from you. Always awesome to hear from the artists. And also, this is hilarious. Gotta make the show shorter. Also pokebelly.
00:29:49.880 - 00:30:10.906, Speaker A: And here, talking about Latin, Vita Brevis, Arslang. What is it? Life is short, art is long by, I was gonna say Goethe. That's how I know it, because it's infaust, but it actually goes back to hippocrates as we were learning last episode. Ben, very quickly on the community. Ilya Barberin. Hello, my dears. Now I'm ready to show you my new collection.
00:30:10.906 - 00:30:36.872, Speaker A: It consists of many animations of the theme good, bad. The fourth animation appeared in the collection today and I will continue to replenish it. So let me see. Here we go. So happy faces that are expanding from Ilya Barberin, who makes those great. Remember the happy faces, the airbrush paintings. I think all the happy faces making, if I'm not mistaken, Rosaceo new artwork in Osaka, cyber safari.
00:30:36.872 - 00:30:53.200, Speaker A: So awesome to see Rosaceo back on the scene here. So a very cool work. And what are the details here? This is on foundation. So Rosatio back on the scene. Wavy peso. What's up, y'all? I am wavy peso. Let's be homies.
00:30:53.200 - 00:31:11.114, Speaker A: Nice to hear from you. And here we got a couple of aliens in the studio here. Looks like a digital painting, couple of different versions. Interestingly, Kurt hustle collective, start your day with a piece of video art history. Indeed. Get yourself a Kurt hustle one of one. Subscribe now.
00:31:11.114 - 00:31:34.378, Speaker A: So half selected news. That awesome piece, 97 tazos. I can't believe someone hasn't bought that yet. This is probably gone, but you can check on object skull takes traveling through the mediums. Check out this thread on Lvid Lovid's work. So unfortunately, we probably don't have too much time to go through this. But yeah, you see the weaving here and going back and forth between.
00:31:34.378 - 00:31:58.554, Speaker A: We see this with Kristen Roost to great effect. And we're going to see another example today. So very interesting that of course we are unit London having a foot in the digital art scene here. They're kind of interesting. They kind of have a foot in the contemporary and a foot in the digital art scene. They're interesting, kind of crossover group. We are unit London K's works.
00:31:58.554 - 00:32:25.962, Speaker A: Why do you fight? So here we are. So here we go, painting. It's about a soldier caught an internal turmoil on a battlefield and he has to win the battle. So here it is, a digital painting. Look how beautiful that is. Look at that brushwork. Is that all digital? Is this AI? Is this a combination? Very interesting.
00:32:25.962 - 00:32:45.272, Speaker A: And there you are in Photoshop with some clues. Wow, that is pretty impressive. So thank you for posting that. Kswerks Oyani coyote. Cool work there. Great texture. I'm so impressed with digital painting right now.
00:32:45.272 - 00:33:13.258, Speaker A: There was a time where the brushes were not convincing, where I would just use the hard edge contour of it, the pure digital brush stroke. But now that you see it, with artists like Euxine and many, many, many others, the brushwork is getting fantastic. As you see right there with digital painting. Son of Steg, the push of inertia. These are pretty interesting works. Son of stag. Thank you for posting them.
00:33:13.258 - 00:33:32.470, Speaker A: Great textures here. A combination of a lot of things. It kind of looks like a little bit of magic wand selection. I love that stuff. Kind of gives a sense of randomness. And Peterson's my second work on rodeo. So now, is this the person who put the inside of the book? Interestingly so.
00:33:32.470 - 00:33:46.332, Speaker A: Here. Looks like a variation on a poster study of a film by Michelangelo Antonioni. I hope I'm pronouncing that right. Famous director. And here's apocalypse now. Hilarious. Very cool.
00:33:46.332 - 00:34:07.270, Speaker A: And Lajo X with some work here, interesting kind of emoji like work. And Toro we saw last episode. Thank you, everybody. KF, this was great. So we talked about this work here. The only work I'm holding from IP is Bass Pro, a one of one still from gone bass in a glitch animation I made in early 2024. We're looking at this work.
00:34:07.270 - 00:34:44.278, Speaker A: Pogba Belly recently mentioned in his artist journal as verging on abstract art. I see it as verging on pixel art impressionism, but why not? Both? Very interesting. You could argue, you know, the step towards abstraction in, say, like, you know, abstract expressionism. Those first steps, even expressionism to a certain degree, were in impressionism. So, as you say, kind of same difference. But you know what I liked about you mentioning this KF Kyle, is it does make you look at the work differently as pixel art impressionism. And that is why I mention it.
00:34:44.278 - 00:35:11.462, Speaker A: It's like another. It's funny how just the preconceptions you go walking in, how they do color, how you interpret the work. Ed Marolla this week opened in real life sound art exhibition. Got invited to play a synth at a live gig, talking in real life residence at local digital arts venue, getting a soundtrack ready for next show. Invited to a super cool show with one of the major references in the space Jim. So life of an artist when things are going well. So that's great to hear.
00:35:11.462 - 00:35:29.050, Speaker A: An 80 rocket, the great. I mean, again, I started collecting. There was Rada. You know, the pixel art got me to object. And to Tezos, it was Rata's work, actually. I'd kind of. I think I'd minted a little bit before someone had actually convinced me that it was a good idea.
00:35:29.050 - 00:36:24.614, Speaker A: God, that frozen image there. But it was actually, and I'd been there for a little bit, and it was actually the work of Heidi Rockette that actually convinced me to start collecting and to actually, in a sense, take the work seriously on Tazos in a whole, like a bigger way. So let's see what Haiti Rocket has to say. GM I've been creating on Tazos since April 2021. F all the so called curators who haven't invited me to a single Tezos event in the last three years. Now, I don't know if that means he hasn't been invited to a single event, but, yeah, huge talent. And I would, you know, say under recognized talent ad rocket, a really exciting artist, has been posting on, I think, Tumblr and, you know, Giphy and everything has like over a billion views, views on Giphy.
00:36:24.614 - 00:36:56.020, Speaker A: I mean, he's a major artist, if you ask me. So I just thought I would highlight that a little bit. Let's continue. Why Sigma toad marketplaces are changing their business models to become social media platforms. I'm not sure how that will work in the future, considering the infancy and niche nature of this industry. Now, what's kind of interesting about this, they're changing their business model to become social media platforms. I would actually, I call object, which I consider probably the best website in space.
00:36:56.020 - 00:37:32.080, Speaker A: What was the other way we were looking at Gamma's beautiful, but object is probably the most functional. You can use it, but it's still beautiful, elegant, I would argue. I've long called object a futuristic social media platform. Instead of sharing pictures of your lunch or your friends out on vacation, you're sharing pictures from your imagination, really. And actually works of art. It's basically a work of art sharing platform. Like, it's got the same structure, it's got the red notifications brilliantly.
00:37:32.080 - 00:38:02.918, Speaker A: So I would argue that is why object works and it already is a social media network. You follow people, right? I'm not sure how that will work in the future, considering the infancy and niche nature of this industry. I think it already exists. And you do see, like, Zora move towards becoming more social media platform, which I think actually makes perfect sense. Right? And of course, we see rodeo. We've seen, you know, so I think even foundation, you could argue, is like a social. You follow people.
00:38:02.918 - 00:38:46.008, Speaker A: You can comment right on. I don't know if you can do it on foundation, but most places you can comment, right? So I think this is actually just, it's kind of already happened and it's already, it's part of the evolution. But I think if you're focusing on the social media platform rather than as being a great place to show your art, then I think, which is maybe what wise Sigma toad is talking about, then I think we do actually go too far. And then it's all of a sudden again, is it about rodeo? Is it like seventeen cents and it's not. Why would people use rodeo at $0.17, you know, I don't know, but I guess we'll find out. And here is the tweet I was mentioning earlier.
00:38:46.008 - 00:39:23.054, Speaker A: Woman NFT Zora needs funding to operate. Zero one needs funding to operate. Rodeo needs funding to operate. Artists need funding to operate. And if the artists aren't getting funding, I mean, zero one, like I don't know how much traffic they're getting right now, but I assume it's not that much like I'm not seeing really anything on zero one right now. And why? Because where's the incentive, right? So that's what Zora and Tezos offer, an object, a way to get paid for your art. And so it will continue to me, they will dominate until other people can actually give you as much money or more for your art.
00:39:23.054 - 00:40:07.780, Speaker A: Where you go when you go to mint a piece, you're not like, well, I could put it on rodeo, but am I only going to get $3 for it? Or I can put it on object and maybe get 50 or Zora and maybe get 30. Right? Continuing on, Jack Tazos. After analyzing over a trillion Tezos addresses while working on Bandog, I realize most artists use around 50% of their earnings to support other artists. That is a crucial part of this whole ecosystem is the artists are collectors and spend a decent amount of money of like 50% of their earnings. It kind of keeps the world going around. Like if you didn't have that, we would be in a different situation in my opinion. So really interesting.
00:40:07.780 - 00:40:48.850, Speaker A: Kablien. It took approximately two weeks in 2021 for people to notice the very first window and buy it for five tezos. And now a one of 25 edition is selling for 5575 tezos. I think this went to Vincent van Doe, who is kind of, I would argue, single handedly turning this into a bull market for Tezos art if it did in fact go to Vince van Dot. I am saying that it's food for thought on the narrative that you have to sell out immediately. Exactly. It took two weeks to sell out these works and here you are only three years later selling at 1000 x, right? 1000 x 1100 x.
00:40:48.850 - 00:41:11.642, Speaker A: So let's just see Vincent van Do. Congratulations. So kind of an iconic work, really, these windows on tezos. So interesting there, trill. If I wasn't so illiquid, I would not hesitate to market by that listed window. Still life zero, zero, one for 5000 for $4,500. Honestly ridiculous for such a proper relic.
00:41:11.642 - 00:41:49.330, Speaker A: So people are getting bullish on Tezos grails, even though I own one already. Those are pretty much the Nakamoto rare pepe of tezos nfts. So a grail of sorts of tezos nfts. It's kind of interesting, you know, as potentially as ETH collectors come on to Tezos, I think. And I don't know if this is an ETH collector, but are they going to bring the same. They'll probably bring the same mindset, which is earlier is better. There's a certain kind of collecting mindset that occurred on Ethan, which I don't actually think has worked well, interestingly for a lot of ETH collectors.
00:41:49.330 - 00:42:10.572, Speaker A: So it's going to be interesting to see, I think, like, because, you know, early grails, of course, that has a kind of historical. If Tezos becomes a historical, I'd actually argue it already is a historical thing. Okay, then you have an early grail. Okay, sure. You know, so let's continue. Another huge sale. Object sales, botanical tezzards.
00:42:10.572 - 00:42:28.220, Speaker A: So I guess it's like a PFP project. Sold for 8000 tesO. $6,183. Again, you get the sense that ETh collectors are coming online here. Tezzards. So just a tezzard edition of one. This old.
00:42:28.220 - 00:42:59.648, Speaker A: So interesting activity on tezos here, it continues to be very interesting. Will there be a tazo summer? Santiago when art ascends from everyday images, sounds and things to history, qualitative change occurs. That is an excellent point, that, you know, there is a qualitative change in interpretation. And all of a sudden you see it in a book, and also you go, oh, this is important. But isn't this kind of stupid? Like kind of, you know, it. Like something happens. I think it's called social proof.
00:42:59.648 - 00:43:36.260, Speaker A: That's how powerful social proof is, right? When a museum all of a sudden shows the work and the MoMA shows your Santiago artwork, that changes everything, right? That's the power of social proof. So it's human nature. Kalo, I'm not really a big Seth Godin person, but I thought it illustrated our technology debate discussion. Art and technology discussion. If you're willing to do something that might not work, you're closer to being an artist. And I'd say, you're also closer to be just an inventor, right, to me, or a technologist or like a computer designer. I mean, I think Steve Jobs would consider himself Anhejdehe inventor.
00:43:36.260 - 00:44:03.366, Speaker A: You know, that's what an artist is. So to me, it's just like kind of interesting what they share, I'd call it, you know, in a sense. Again, as I was discussing earlier, artists as basically inventors of sorts, technologists of sorts. Image making technologists. Ox Benji. I don't use my plotter enough, so today I tried to rectify that a little bit. The green Sharpie was darker than I expected, but heck, I still like the output.
00:44:03.366 - 00:44:26.030, Speaker A: Also, getting high on Sharpie fumes was an unexpected gift. So look how beautiful this is. So back to art as technology. You see how important it is here, the technology that's involved here. So very interesting. Here's a couple of works by Oxbengi. I think this is on rodeo club.
00:44:26.030 - 00:44:42.508, Speaker A: So other works, pointillist twelve. Very nice piece. I'm not sure if it's digital only or if it's also. Here's another one. My in real life job has been all consuming lately, leaving a little time for creative coding. So I think these are generative pieces. Quite beautiful.
00:44:42.508 - 00:44:57.392, Speaker A: Generative abstract art. Here's Kristen. Variation on a weaving design in progress. So this is weaving of digital art. So incredibly cool. Very nicely done. So another, I don't.
00:44:57.392 - 00:45:20.128, Speaker A: I think this is a different one from the other one we looked at. Retro Tech USA. I think I need to reduce the news tabs here at the start of the show. CRTs are dead and have been for a long time. There's no future production of the new ones on the horizon. The entire planet has forgotten the art of creating a good glass CRT. So these just kind of celebrating these machines here.
00:45:20.128 - 00:45:45.310, Speaker A: I think it was Kyle Flemmer who retweeted this. Aside from a handful of us brave souls out here trying to save these machines, there is no mainstream or large corporation contributing to saving the CRT. They're probably seen as unenvironmental. I imagine it's sad to watch such an iconic and important piece of hardware disappear, but I'll press on trying to save as many as I can while I can. They are beautiful. They are absolutely beautiful. And other physical digital work.
00:45:45.310 - 00:46:06.836, Speaker A: Here's Mirikit in Playa at Killscreen. I'm not sure where that is curated by Brian Mungia Munja. So another awesome meerkat work. And you can hear it a tiny bit there. I guess there's volume on that. I think we've seen that originally. Anyways, it looks awesome.
00:46:06.836 - 00:46:29.284, Speaker A: I wonder if it had to get cropped for that tv. Interestingly, here's element Li. First person phone collage of digital print on canvas, size variable. Look at how creative this is. Turning the canvas upside down and then printing it out. Kind of pixel art, let's call it. And then collaging it and then even putting a bit of gesso there.
00:46:29.284 - 00:46:50.700, Speaker A: Very wild work from element Li. Here's her Mapi pixel art on Instagram, as you see here. This looks like a bingo card, doesn't it? Or something like that. Maybe this is one of those old computer cards. And then sign, though. Hey, looks like it was made by Hermipe. Very interesting, whatever that is.
00:46:50.700 - 00:47:11.952, Speaker A: And my oil painting of McDonald's DC sign print version. So we looked at this work, I believe, yesterday at the end of the show. And here it is, the sign print version. So very cool there. Here's Dan control, also back in. Interesting display here, combining screens and printing. And here are e boy arts Tokyo poster back in stock.
00:47:11.952 - 00:47:30.062, Speaker A: So I believe e boy arts is a famous pixel art duo, if I'm not mistaken. So here, just pixel artists printing, workout and framing. Very interesting. Bzzaya. Don't tell me what fashion is by bzzaya.com. hilarious. So all sorts of physical renditions here.
00:47:30.062 - 00:47:47.794, Speaker A: Here's Jake studios. I thought this was a very interesting post, which is taking a gif and then dividing it into its different frames. And you see how each one is its own little art piece. Very interesting post here. Frames from Imba weather. Also, Yurij. AI getting better.
00:47:47.794 - 00:48:08.214, Speaker A: So this looks like Urij, probably combining previous works using AI. I think this is AI, you know, when you see in here. I think so. Not positive on that, but I think so. So AI getting better. Anyways, let's go. Yuri J.
00:48:08.214 - 00:48:20.294, Speaker A: Cutlades with puritae. Another kitchen from Yuri J. Here. This on super rare. So more mints on super air that we're seeing July 28. So awesome. Let's see if we can zoom in a bit.
00:48:20.294 - 00:48:47.250, Speaker A: So again, classic Uri J. As you say, the outlines of our lives here, just outlines and then filled with different kind of patterning, beautiful, beautiful textures. I mean, Uri J is doing quite well. I think it's built kind of a nice digital art, you know, oeuvre, so to speak. Like it's quite persuasive. There's the instant pot I have that. I recommend that part of the kitchen there.
00:48:47.250 - 00:48:58.562, Speaker A: These are awesome. Pressure cooker. So beautiful. Work there. Just listed on super rare summer residence, also by Uri J. So minting a ton of work, putting it multi chain here. So beautiful work.
00:48:58.562 - 00:49:18.600, Speaker A: Kind of reminds me of a greek island, maybe not very deep analysis here from me, but that is kind of reminds me of an island here. And here are some boats. And it just looks kind of cool, doesn't it? A little landscape. Weird. Kind of almost frame into space there. A balloon. And again, that same style.
00:49:18.600 - 00:49:37.822, Speaker A: Right? And also we got seven very quick interest. I love the titles of these a series. So, Yuri J. Putting out a ton of work here, lesson one. And you see up close again, Uri J style. It's quite persuasive, everything coming together here. Cube.
00:49:37.822 - 00:49:53.290, Speaker A: Love the titles of these works. Pyramid. These are gorgeous. Look at these great, totally original textures and just works. I mean, it's just original work. Lesson four. So just beautiful.
00:49:53.290 - 00:50:09.140, Speaker A: Lesson five. So these are one of ones, I think they're about 40 tezos each still available. Many of them. All of them, so very cool. Some other works here. So Yuri J has two accounts. This is the one with four extra j's at the end.
00:50:09.140 - 00:50:30.002, Speaker A: Here's lesson seven, interestingly, which is lesson six. So very cool work from Urija and Gloomtube. I thought these were hilarious. They took me a couple of times. Long time no see. So, garbage bags over the window. It's like, you know, there's.
00:50:30.002 - 00:51:29.450, Speaker A: I remember being in english literature class very quickly, studying Tom Sawyer, the adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Mark Twain, and what the professor was pointing out, Peter Stoichev, now president of the University of Saskatchewan, he was pointing out how Mark Twain was. He took out this passage and how it was like the absolute anti romantic passage, like, the fish is dead, the grey fish is dead. Like the exact opposite, he was saying, of romanticism and the brilliant and what we're almost seeing with Kant, like the awesome and terrible power of nature. And there was Mark Twain, the satirist, just needling that whole way, aesthetic idea with Tom Sawyer or Huckleberry Finn and the dead fish in the water, and everything's gray, satirizing this whole notion. Brilliant. I kind of like, here's. So we have to keep that kind of thing in mind.
00:51:29.450 - 00:51:47.840, Speaker A: When I would argue, when you look at a gloom tube here and you're going, well, this is a garbage bag on a window. Like, what's going on here? Long time no see. Great title. Edition of ten for five tezos. Three gone so far, and it's part of a whole series. I find this title hilarious. 05:55 p.m.
00:51:47.840 - 00:52:13.070, Speaker A: so with a garbage bag blocking the sun. Right. Again, always kind of dystopian, a little bit from gloomtube, chronicling the american nightmare to a certain degree. And I use that in quotes, and it's not always a nightmare. And have, yeah, I know people, etc. Etcetera, that are having wonderful lives over in America. But I think if we were to just shorthand it in a very kind of quick way.
00:52:13.070 - 00:52:22.162, Speaker A: And here's another one. What's the title on this one? Go look out the window. Gloom tube. So awesome. And here's one more. A light turned on. Okay.
00:52:22.162 - 00:52:38.550, Speaker A: But you can't see it because a garbage bag is covering the windows. So again, just like the most unromantic image you could ever imagine, a garbage bag on a window. Beautiful. Brilliant. Actually, here's nub. 1914 patio. So once again, wild.
00:52:38.550 - 00:53:03.932, Speaker A: Taking two works, maybe feeling that those works on their own don't work right, or that are not enough, let's say. So it's like, you know what? What if I put these two together? This is. We're back to the pragmatics of art making. That. That's what I see here. I see two works. It's like if we put it together and then you get this interesting kind of, you know, contemporary art piece where it's like, what is this juxtaposition about? Is that the house of the rabbit? It's just association.
00:53:03.932 - 00:53:20.720, Speaker A: It's like Echo of Magritte here, you know, so, nub, 1914. That's on Zora Zozo. Let's listen. The great Zozo. Purple rabbits. We saw the blue dog last time. So very fun.
00:53:20.720 - 00:53:43.756, Speaker A: I think this sold, or interestingly, unlisted. Maybe that's for the personal collection. Maybe has two rabbits. This was fun. David Hockney revisited. So I think echoing a David Hockney work with sprinklers, very, very fun work. Again, screams like, art institution.
00:53:43.756 - 00:53:57.908, Speaker A: Even the wild palm trees there. Elan being sprinkled already. Hands picking that one up. Nice pick up. 30 tazos. Yeah, I would have loved to pick that one up. Beautiful work here is hysteruble waffle ad interim Shangri laden.
00:53:57.908 - 00:54:19.384, Speaker A: So let us get the volume. More edgy, kind of new wave, no wave kind of work here. Beautiful. Just barely get a melody. Great musician, too. Great musician. Waffles.
00:54:19.384 - 00:54:46.180, Speaker A: So what happened here? Edition of six. So selling some at auction. Always tricky to get your cedar plank, also known as Hasdrubal waffle. There's cedar plank on La Playa or doing a work on laplaya. And so very interesting summer work here. Not sure on the software on this one. Hasselhoff, maybe that's David Hasselhoff, maybe it's Baywatch reference.
00:54:46.180 - 00:55:17.256, Speaker A: So couple gone. And here, PP Universal, el domingo mast tranquilo. So feeling like it's referencing a very famous work here of human sacrifice out of maybe the andes there. Very cool work from PP Universal, selling out edition of five at seven tezos each. Nice work. Here's Jake Studios, who we were seeing earlier, planet hopping digitally drawn animation. So another kind of more muted color work from Jake Studios here.
00:55:17.256 - 00:55:42.392, Speaker A: Super prolific artists on the beach. Once again, here's a UFO, and kind of this associative drawing style. So this is Tentez O, suggestion five. And here is element Ly, who we're looking at earlier with the canvas. And so some of the phone work, I assume pixel art. Northern courtyard, kind of a bigger work for element ly, 500 by 500 pixels. Here's another one.
00:55:42.392 - 00:56:01.270, Speaker A: This is 256, more normal size for elemently. And interesting, kind of playing off of an earlier work. Bright and dark methods to depict emptiness and isolation. Very interesting piece. Beautiful work. And here's Haiti rocket system damage. Look how awesome this is.
00:56:01.270 - 00:56:33.438, Speaker A: Beautiful, awesome color and everything. So using, I think some, an Amiga software, I think, edition of three and selling to, at 77 tezos. Very nice, nice sales for Haiti rocket. Let's see if this loads up something on rodeo. Problem with rodeo is if your Internet goes down, all of the rodeo pages don't load up or they have to reload up. It's almost like it's constantly streaming. So here, look at this.
00:56:33.438 - 00:56:52.612, Speaker A: Braun, huh? Eight. So that starts to turn into money. So maybe it's not all bad. You know, if you start getting hundreds and thousands of sales, then, you know, $0.17 makes sense again. So maybe not a. Maybe it's not a bad idea, you know, we'll just continue to see what we see.
00:56:52.612 - 00:57:20.914, Speaker A: No system for art. So, very cool title from Santiago, who I believe has written poetry. And here, kind of a different style. Again, I haven't seen works like this in the gallery for the last 25 years, as our commenter was suggesting. So again, this kind of AI collage style, very wild, wild work here. Edition of 25 for 25 tezos. And they're selling, sorry, at 15 tezos.
00:57:20.914 - 00:57:38.392, Speaker A: Vincent van Doe picking one up. Magician James Bloom actually selling out at seven tezos, I think, at the start, and then selling on secondary. So San Jago doing quite well there. Trails that bifurcate through parallel worlds. This is gons. So gonz here. This is on Zora.
00:57:38.392 - 00:57:58.084, Speaker A: So another interesting using sampled brushes here. Another interesting digital abstract here is Michael Macasso with 34 mints. Knock knock. And playing with these kind of old. I guess this can't go larger. Playing with these old colors here. Almost apple II colors.
00:57:58.084 - 00:58:27.964, Speaker A: And the ultima four like tiling, except at a different ratio, kind of remix tiling here. 34 minted on rodeo. Let's continue. Here is Francoise Gamma. Endos zero four. Super interesting. Totally reminds you of old computer games.
00:58:27.964 - 00:58:44.012, Speaker A: Endos zero four. Three tezos edition of 30. And here's also Francois's gamma. Let me see if we can bring this up. It's having issues with my Internet. I'm on phone Internet again, but it should be fine. Let's go here because otherwise it's been perfect.
00:58:44.012 - 00:58:59.824, Speaker A: Look at that. So a cool francoise gamma work walking figure. And this is back on a comparts which we saw the Martin Bruce work. Here's DJ Quiro. See if there's any volume. I think this is on rodeo. If I'm not.
00:58:59.824 - 00:59:28.330, Speaker A: Yeah, it is. 16 minted. Not bad. So cool work here. And Nintendo glitch Rom. Here's another one. This is Silva sand twos, who continues to just, you know, really just, you know, for lack of better term, deconstruct the image, right? Or just continues to just kind of blow it apart and even the arm disappearing.
00:59:28.330 - 00:59:41.970, Speaker A: Very interesting work and development from Silva Santus as we see here. Just to make sure we get that right. We did. That's on Zora. Here is. Let's just see how many minted. One minted so far.
00:59:41.970 - 00:59:57.314, Speaker A: Sean Luke Chronoweb. So interesting. Almost looking like biological or worms or something. Cool abstract. Look at that frame, that incredible frame. Very interesting piece. Animated abstract from Sean Luke.
00:59:57.314 - 01:00:21.898, Speaker A: Here's reinky with a couple on Instagram. Let's see if we can get this working. So this was interesting, right? Look at that one too. Interesting combination of like pixelation and kind of smoothness. Interesting contrast here continues to be super interesting from Renki. Here's Kareem Safa Earth. A digital animation inspired by seven layers of our planet.
01:00:21.898 - 01:00:34.306, Speaker A: So kind of mixing science. Very cool. And pixel art. Very, very cool. And how much is this? 20 tezos edition of 20. And there are four left. Get it while you can.
01:00:34.306 - 01:00:48.800, Speaker A: Here's neurocolor. Interesting piece. And quite a few views here. 15,000 views. And almost looking like bees or something in a beehive. Who knows? I'm not sure. Interesting abstract is what I would call that.
01:00:48.800 - 01:01:12.640, Speaker A: And here's DJ Kiro with a very cool video painting, as we like to call him. Very up close with this and just a little glitch and maybe a little bit of sky behind there. Not sure. Very cool. That is on rodeo. And let's see if we can get this one working on Zora. This is Kiro also, and this is Salma, Kuro's mom, actually.
01:01:12.640 - 01:01:34.080, Speaker A: So shout out to mom and to all moms out there, to Salma and everyone. Look how beautiful that is. So making a portrait of mom in art. So how great is that? Shout out to Kiro and fam. That's on Zora 32, minted so far. It's pretty awesome. Here is x mortal with another beautiful landscape here.
01:01:34.080 - 01:01:53.090, Speaker A: Beautiful sunset, as you see here. Video glitch, analog video glitch. Arty hands. Picking that up for 96 dezos. Nice sale here is a beautiful one by Klaus, which was just released, keeping it at 21 tezos. Composition 249. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.
01:01:53.090 - 01:02:13.154, Speaker A: It continues. And here's wok doduo. And how much did this sell for? Three tazos. So you can still get a wok cheap here. So again, I think coming from Pokemon cards, I believe. And this one was quite brilliant, wasn't it? The Mona Lisa. This is brilliant digital artwork from Wak.
01:02:13.154 - 01:02:34.550, Speaker A: I'm not sure if this was minted anywhere. Just brilliant, because that is almost the modern day version of the Mona Lisa. This is also interesting. This is by Olga F 2727. I thought just from a. You could totally imagine this in a museum is part of the abstract expressionism or something. Almost has a bit of a 1960s feel.
01:02:34.550 - 01:03:09.320, Speaker A: It's algorithm based art, as far as I understand, generative. Here's RJ, I believe, doing AI as we look up close here, and I think just keeping to these, almost 1000 by 1000 pixel, I think renders. So putting out some AI edition of one for 15 tezos. Cool pools. Here's some more pools. Blue water selling this one. And as you see, again, looking very AI esque, isn't it? So interesting pieces from RJ.
01:03:09.320 - 01:03:34.088, Speaker A: Beautiful work here by Mikey Wilson. Come on in my kitchen. Blues. So very interesting work of almost desaturated window here with color. The suit again, kind of color in the background. And in the foreground, the figure, not as much color, nice contrast, all to say. And even the fruit on the table.
01:03:34.088 - 01:03:47.056, Speaker A: Let's see if we. Wow, look at how enormous this file is. Look at this. So we are dealing with AI art. Look at how huge this is. That is wild. Robert Johnson.
01:03:47.056 - 01:04:05.422, Speaker A: Come on in my kitchen. Come on in. In my kitchen, seven tazos edition of ten and selling six so far. So nice work. Here's Lily Illo, and I think this may be an older work. Interesting echo of the head here. Of course, we just had Lily illo on last week.
01:04:05.422 - 01:04:37.348, Speaker A: We're gonna have runtoon on this week, talking about the show they did in Omaha, Nebraska. Here's Zach, one of the main people at Zora Vox 2024, photography, novel AI checkpoint diffusion outputs and exhibited with Kismet Kaza at Knox gallery in Tokyo. So interesting AI artwork here from Zach at Zora packet Switch Network, Kanexapata. And this is an edition of one. Very interesting. Using a couple of outputs. Stable diffusion output made with prompting changes.
01:04:37.348 - 01:04:53.480, Speaker A: Lora, not sure what that is. Very interesting. No hygiene. Another edgy work here, abstract of sorts. And here's sum de la creme with a whole new series here. New collection, the shared human experience facial expressions. And I think.
01:04:53.480 - 01:05:21.428, Speaker A: I think these are AI, but actually, I'm not sure I thought they were, but maybe they're not, I'm not sure. I mean, Zoom's done a lot of work with AI, and, oh, yeah, artificial intelligence and digital art techniques, so it's actually both. That's why it was hard to tell. So cool series here from Zoom. Cool concept, too. And as we go into the physicals, here is walk again. Tons of work by walk here today.
01:05:21.428 - 01:05:44.760, Speaker A: And just this daffy duck. His interpretation of all of these characters is totally awesome. Like, remember kind of the Christopher Wool like series here, like, you know, no line break there. Very cool. That's on foundation. Here's Bondozo Bandito. And very interesting composition here from Hermes.
01:05:44.760 - 01:06:09.880, Speaker A: Again, just black and white, the outrageous decisions, you know? Francesco Vinoli, this is. It's not a gallery. So more interesting, what looks like airbrush work, of course. Martin Bruce, also experimenting with airbrush recently. Ben Steyer acrylic paint on paper, calligraphy pens and ink on paper. Just a good looking piece here. Interesting design.
01:06:09.880 - 01:06:34.170, Speaker A: Maria Lundstrom studio Saturday. Acrylic on paper with what might be a textile floral pattern. So she's not even sure what it is, but it looks pretty cool. A nice looking piece. C three. Pepe, WTF? Is now available at art of the millennium. And I thought, wow, this is pretty nicely painted, isn't it? Looks like a pepe repeated here, I thought, quite a nice piece.
01:06:34.170 - 01:06:53.022, Speaker A: Nicely done. 90 by 120. Continuing on, Luciana Guerra. And so just some recent works here by Luciana, which look pretty great. Physical works, of course, abstracts, mostly abstract. And we'll see if this loads up. Ruhn Christensen.
01:06:53.022 - 01:07:06.938, Speaker A: This was interesting. A fun time making the six by five meter floral mural alongside great friends and favorite people. So interesting. Big mural here. Not sure where this is. Kind of looks like a beach or something. So huge work.
01:07:06.938 - 01:07:13.010, Speaker A: And that's your show, everyone. Thanks for joining me. And thanks again for all the support. Until next time, take care.
