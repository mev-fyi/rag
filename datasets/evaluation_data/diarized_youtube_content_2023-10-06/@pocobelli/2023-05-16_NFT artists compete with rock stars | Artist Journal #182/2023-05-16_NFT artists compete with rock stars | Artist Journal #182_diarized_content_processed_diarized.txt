00:00:05.000 - 00:00:28.034, Speaker A: A big shout out, and happy birthday to my brother, who turns 50 years old today, Mark Boccabelli. A big hat tip to you if you happen to be watching. If not, I'll see you in Munich next week. Actually, this Friday. So big show note, no shows next week. I think I'm gonna try and do one Friday morning. Artist journal, May 16, 2023.
00:00:28.034 - 00:00:58.958, Speaker A: Broadcasting to the world from Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pokebelli, and welcome back. I mean, yeah, I mean, it. It's just one of those things that only happens once in your life. So I'm glad my brother is coming out to Europe to visit some friends and should be a great week. So, as I like to do here, I think it's good to take breaks, frankly, for this show, too. It's good for people as well as myself just to take a breather, come back to things.
00:00:58.958 - 00:01:18.504, Speaker A: Just like when you're making art, you know, it's good to take little breaks. I'm a bit of a workaholic, as maybe you figured out at this point, but it really is worthwhile to take breaks. So, anyways, check this out. This is Ranex deer. I hope I'm pronouncing the name right. I love this work. It's.
00:01:18.504 - 00:01:53.854, Speaker A: It really stood out, and I was. As I was kind of putting the tabs together for this show, I just kept coming back to this work, and I just kept moving up to the front. And anyways, I just think a really interesting work that I find really hard to pinpoint. It feels familiar, but I actually don't have a. I'm not like, oh, this is that. I mean, at best, it kind of has a bit of a Yves tangy feel to it, but it's quite different. I mean, this is, you know, as I like to say, this is going somewhere.
00:01:53.854 - 00:02:32.322, Speaker A: This is interesting. I mean, what is going on here? We have this kind of semi abstract and semi representational work here. We have kind of a lot of, you know, top right. We have some. A fairly three dimensional, almost like airbrushed looking, 3d sculpted thing turning into, you know, a different. Like, almost like a pipe turning into something else, different colors, and really kind of flattening out into more of a painterly, slightly more painterly kind of look down here. Again, it kind of has this airbrush feeling, but it's a few different things.
00:02:32.322 - 00:03:25.684, Speaker A: So, anyways, you know, the prize for mystifying me is one. And over here, this kind of three dimensional looking object. I mean, the space is interesting, right? I mean, you're wanting to create a space out of this. But it kind of resists an easy, you know, conception of space, shall we say, a spatial representation of space, like an easily understandable space. And this is almost like, you feel like this is almost like a lag. So a very surreal abstract, which is why maybe I'm going to Tangi. Yves Tanguy is my kind of go to, like trying to place this Rannixteer edition of 69 for Otezo 69.
00:03:25.684 - 00:03:51.028, Speaker A: Only two have sold. So one defrancoise gamma. So a little bit of social proof for you there. So Francois Gamma is digging it and other collectors here. Kramer, shout out to both. So anyways, Rannick Steer here, and I think I brought up Rannick Steer's page. So again, we've been, I was sort of, I've been tracking Rannick Steer, kind of rediscovered in Haiti Rockette's collection.
00:03:51.028 - 00:04:15.188, Speaker A: And of course, one of the great things of collecting nfts is you can look at other people's collections. And I was looking in Haiti Rockette's collection a couple of weeks ago. I can't remember which one it was. It was one of these, I think, down here. Another just really cool abstract. But this, you see the color change, like, again, this seems to be being pushed further. This seems to be going somewhere.
00:04:15.188 - 00:04:33.748, Speaker A: So anyways, great work. Ranix Tier, very cool. And yeah, there are 67 left. So you are early tomorrow, Wednesday at 09:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, 330 in Berlin. We're going to have Daniel W. On the show.
00:04:33.748 - 00:04:53.284, Speaker A: And so that is very exciting and I'm calling it special guest Daniel W. On art and alchemy. I'm sure a lot of other things here. Excited to have Daniel W. And Ruinertooner and my join runetune and myself on this week's spaces. Come hang out and talk art, alchemy and the occult. So I didn't pass that by Daniel W.
00:04:53.284 - 00:05:12.572, Speaker A: This whole spiel. But I mean, a lot of Daniel W's work deals with these issues, so it should be super interesting to hear. So anyways, come check it out. Come hang out with Daniel W. And Roentoon and myself and it should be a ton of fun. I have pinned the tweet, I think. Yes.
00:05:12.572 - 00:05:37.664, Speaker A: So you can find that on the profile. So that is cool. And here's just a new work by Daniel W. If you don't know, I think most people who watch this show know, but there's always new people coming and going in a sense. So anyways, you know, my mom, I was like, mom, if you have feedback on the show, let me know. And she's like, well, you say so anyways, quite a bit. And I had no idea.
00:05:37.664 - 00:06:08.804, Speaker A: So anyways, it's great to get feedback of that kind. So I'm not going to try and I'm going to. You can make it a drinking game of will I say it because it's really hard to actually stop doing. Anyway, here's a work by Daniel W. And it's again, so again, just for those who are unfamiliar, again, the print sort of feel to it, it's always got kind of a. I don't want to say oppressive space, but always kind of like. Again, it's kind of occult is how I'd almost describe it here.
00:06:08.804 - 00:06:34.084, Speaker A: It's like you can't tell if this is a mirror that's not working or an image of someone from behind in a frame. Frame. Again, it's got that CMYK color scheme, just the basic prints. So interesting conceptually and from a composition point of view is always interesting too. Fairly minimal in the way that it's approached and everything. Like, it's kind of like a surrealist painting. Like a Magritte.
00:06:34.084 - 00:07:09.994, Speaker A: Almost everything is kind of charged with meaning, whether it's this, you know, light socket here or light switch. Everything, the handle. Everything seems charged with meaning, whether it's this bottom paneling here at the bottom of the wall and beautiful kind of shadow here. Again, architecture and space. Again, to me it has a Magritte. It evokes kind of a Magritte feeling. And actually, I just also want to point out this nice, almost physical looking black that's also put in here and kind of, you know, a few errors here and there to really give it an organic feeling.
00:07:09.994 - 00:07:26.054, Speaker A: This almost looks like physical. And I'm sure this work would work as physical. So we'll ask Daniel W. Tomorrow. What's up? I think this was just listed. 19 are available for three tezos each. So good price, an empty room.
00:07:26.054 - 00:07:54.796, Speaker A: So that is coming up. And thank you for the comments, everybody. On yesterday's show, it did pretty well in terms of views in 24 hours, 239. A lot of likes on that and just some really nice comments. Helpful for artists and collectors. And I'm glad to hear that both and Mick renders also bleu and I had a great time working together and combining our style. I think we'll definitely do something again in the future.
00:07:54.796 - 00:08:21.416, Speaker A: Big Bleu fan and really happy to have gotten to do something with such talent. I love the screen printing that our 4K random girl 4K has been doing. We actually put our collab together today. Another one I was geeking out about. So that's cool and fun and just a lot of collabs going on. So thank you for the comment and thank you Ouyo 66 Andre Blues and cruel Koppinger. So anyways, thank you everybody.
00:08:21.416 - 00:08:38.196, Speaker A: That was awesome. And thank you to popple. So this was funny, actually. So popple commented, and as you can see on my browser here, you don't. The braille turns out differently. Like, let me just show you. So thank you.
00:08:38.196 - 00:09:07.934, Speaker A: Pokebelly. Seems braille patterns are not showing correctly on some browsers. So as you can see here, it looks like popple with just the circles. But as you can see on my browser, you see, it's almost like there's full circles that are white and then empty circles that are the blank space. So that seems to be the difference. I almost like this version better because it's so cryptic, which kind of fits beautifully with popple. So either way works.
00:09:07.934 - 00:09:31.632, Speaker A: But I'd say kind of a really cool, happy accident. It's like there's less. It's almost like there's a halting of communication of sorts to over interpret what's going on here. But I think that's why I like it. It's almost like there's barely anything being said, but if you really look up close, it actually will say popple. So a happy accident, I would say so. Anyways, thank you for the comment.
00:09:31.632 - 00:09:51.840, Speaker A: Popple and Popple retweeted this artist journal tweet here. And this is like, usually it gets like 3000 maybe of reach. We got 8337 for reach. And I can't help but think that was Popple's. Popple retweeting that. Why do I. Right.
00:09:51.840 - 00:10:19.306, Speaker A: I was just going to compare it here as well. So that's what I was showing here. So anyways, thank you to Popple. Now, speaking of huge reach here, and I almost want to apologize for the poofy hair here. I have just come from the gym, so it always gets a little crazy on those days. Anyways, we were talking about a huge reach. We saw that with Popple, which was 200,000.
00:10:19.306 - 00:10:37.426, Speaker A: We saw it with someone else. Now look at spuegelsmaskinen. Good night, everybody. One and a half hours left of auction and 1 million views on this tweet. So let me show you and look at how many it has. 1.2 million views on this phone booth skeleton thing.
00:10:37.426 - 00:11:27.984, Speaker A: So it almost. I was starting to wonder to myself, and by the way, for those, you know, some people say, oh, you shouldn't put the link in your feed or you should put it later. It doesn't seem to be slowing down, this tweet, having the link there. And it almost got me wondering, this huge reach we're seeing and maybe this was happening and I just wasn't aware. But it does make me wonder if you're working at Twitter and there's the new people who've taken over Twitter and you're trying to make that x the everything app, so you want art people to be on Twitter. Maybe they start going, hey, let's actually help the art people here. And we can kind of take that.
00:11:27.984 - 00:11:49.866, Speaker A: We can kind of run. Like, the digital artists are already basically using Twitter more than Instagram, one could argue. One could arguably. So maybe we should just help these guys out a little bit. I mean, I don't know if that's true. It could be just the work itself has garnered that many views. But I just don't remember seeing this kind of reach.
00:11:49.866 - 00:12:05.374, Speaker A: I mean, 1.2 million, 1.2 million. I mean, let's quickly look. I mean, we didn't see it help popple a ton. I mean, popple got 0.69 ETH, which was good, but for 200,000 views, you'd think maybe a little higher.
00:12:05.374 - 00:12:34.202, Speaker A: It may have helped Spuegel's maskinen, though, because 1.69 is pretty good, I think. Like, I'm not sure how much the others went for. See this? 1.1.75. So again, I mentioned it yesterday, this idea that Rob NASV two mentioned that NFTs are like, you know, the next rock stars. NFT artists are the next rock stars. 1.2
00:12:34.202 - 00:13:01.168, Speaker A: million. I mean, you're competing with rockstars, I suspect, with that kind of reach. So it's incredibly exciting is how I would describe that. And if we just go like. And you might be wondering like, what is Spuegels Maskinen's profile here? 13.3. I mean, I feel like I just saw like a month or two ago he was at 10,000. So, you know, pretty interesting.
00:13:01.168 - 00:13:23.464, Speaker A: Again, it's tempting to think maybe something's going on at HQ. Who knows? Just a theory, just a speculation. I don't even. Just a hypothesis, shall we say. So, anyways, congrats to Spuegels on that. Again, I feel like the price is impressive, but the reach is starting to be almost more impressive. Like that is.
00:13:23.464 - 00:13:50.084, Speaker A: I mean, how many contemporary artists. What kind of reach? I mean, a fair question. What kind of reach are the top contemporary artists in the world getting just in terms of their work being seen, I guess art news, you know, shows it. So then maybe that's a few million, I don't know, a couple of million. I don't know what their traffic is. But the plot thickens on this whole reach business. Like, let's see if this continues.
00:13:50.084 - 00:14:39.708, Speaker A: So anyways, I gotta not say that Kelowna contemporary, lots of convos about bear and bull markets. My humble advice to artists is to set aside those concerns and focus on building meaningful relationships with collectors, a strong artistic identity, and a sustainable and consistent pipeline of work with a long term vision. And I think this is excellent advice. And so, yeah, like, never get to, especially in crypto. I mean, everything feels like it could vaporize, you know, tomorrow. So it's sort of like, I think this is really just focus on the fundamentals is what, you know, work on building a business for the long term. You know, it seems like what Michaela is saying through Kelowna contemporary.
00:14:39.708 - 00:15:10.274, Speaker A: Anyway, I thought that was just good advice worth sharing. This was also kind of interesting too. Let's actually start with artnome. That looks like Hasdrubal waffle in art Gnome's profile here. I'm guessing, I don't know. Crypto artists who found success in 2021 for the first time, getting DM's directly from collectors and wondering why they needed a gallery. Right? Who needs a gallery anymore? Many NFT collectors have said it's kind of still, it's not an invalid question.
00:15:10.274 - 00:15:41.272, Speaker A: Many now see the role played by galleries, especially during periods when things aren't so great. And here they have, we are unit London, which has sort of been kind of more in the contemporary side of things. So maybe they're moving into NFTs a little bit. So interesting. So appreciate the physical galleries. As I've always said here, you know, multi chain, multimedia, multi platform. So multimedia being, you know, be in physical, which means you're not.
00:15:41.272 - 00:16:45.446, Speaker A: I mean, theoretically you could sell physical work and it may actually go in that direction on object and whatever, but it's great to have your work in a gallery again, it shows range and it's like, okay, this guy has this, or her has her whole NFT thing. She has her galleries lined up. I mean it's not a, in a sense, you want to diversify your portfolio and your revenue streams, because maybe to art Nome's point, you may be doing really well at some point with NFTs, and maybe at another point it'll be the physical, which is often like, there's overlap between the contemporary art collector and the NFT art collector. But it's not like it's, it's not a pure overlap. There's just a little bit, one could argue. So it's good to diversify your revenue streams and just your exposure out there, you know, get your art out in every way possible. And there's also, it's kind of back to this idea of there is a credibility, I would argue, that comes with being prolific.
00:16:45.446 - 00:17:21.150, Speaker A: One doesn't need to be prolific to be a credible artist, but it does create credibility in the sense that if you have thousands of work out that are of a good quality that is impressive, I mean, that will, it kind of builds its own credibility. And here's a response to this. Absolutely. From public occurrences. NFT galleries are essential to a healthy crypto art market. As an example, Fort NFT has done a phenomenal job in curating leading artists. And yeah, Fort NFT has been around and I guess they have maybe a physical look.
00:17:21.150 - 00:17:42.734, Speaker A: So Art Wolf, Art Wolfe from Fort Gallery, thank you for this recognition. Fort has been committed to exhibiting artists since 2007 in San Francisco. And it's truly an honor to be here now in the metaverse. So anyways, I keep saying it. So mom was right. Mom was right. Anyway, we will continue here.
00:17:42.734 - 00:18:06.842, Speaker A: It may be tricky. Look at this. So just to kind of continue on the contemporary art front. So here is someone, P Azuro, who I don't know a ton about, and they are probably art collector on look. NFT art collector, founder of ox Babylon Azuro protocol. My gallery is so someone who's enthusiastic about digital art. Look at this.
00:18:06.842 - 00:18:43.754, Speaker A: My first Kandinsky. So P. Azuro just picked up a Kandinsky. So how cool is that? And from a collector perspective, you could also argue it's good to diversify and not put everything in one basket. I mean, I am biased towards the digital because, you know, when I own my own property, then maybe I'll have physical art. But until then, it's sort of like having physical art is as much of an encumbrance as a benefit in a lot of ways for me personally. Anyways, look at how beautiful this Kandinsky is too.
00:18:43.754 - 00:19:17.728, Speaker A: And you know what I thought of when I saw this? And especially the violet here, who does that remind you of? This kind of reminds me of rosatio here. So anyway, so I keep saying it. So it's going to be a very difficult thing to stop. But I think it's actually a good advice, mom. So continuing on, and I think I brought up. Actually, let's quickly look at the christie's allow all cookies. Okay, so it went for $252,000.
00:19:17.728 - 00:20:00.202, Speaker A: So that is a lot of money. But it is interesting to think of in the context of the NFT scene, because what does a, what does, like a Dmitri Cherniak or the other, you know, a squiggle. I think a squiggle is ten ETH right now. So maybe that's $20,000. So it's still ten squiggles. But all to say, I think bored ape just went for like half a million to maybe like $970,000 sometimes. The crypto scene, I think it's always good to actually have your eye out on the physical art world if you are a collector.
00:20:00.202 - 00:20:44.344, Speaker A: I remember during the 2021 bull run when everything went insane in terms of digital art prices, I saw, like, Max Ernst painting, not a popular one, but I remember looking at a Sotheby's show, I think it was, and it was available for like $150,000. And I thought, you know, considering what digital art's going for. And there was a Duchamp, I believe there was a duchal work for like 100, 5200 thousand. And I thought that seems pretty cheap relative to what I'm seeing in the digital art market. So, you know, and there's the back, so very cool and rare. So I thought this was super interesting. So let me tell you why.
00:20:44.344 - 00:21:34.668, Speaker A: What are you currently working on? Do you guys prefer works in progress or prefer to wait to show it till it's done? I like the works in progress, and I have something additional to say to this. So here, first of all, is rare, you know, working in progress. It's beautiful, isn't it? And I have to say there's something to be said for this version. Like this, you know, green outline, the color. I mean, it's like this totally artificial digital color contrasted with this traditional painting. I have to say, like, I'd be curious to see what this composition looks like as a whole in its unfinished state here, because it's quite beautiful as an unfinished work. So I just, I just like that really just kind of caught my eye.
00:21:34.668 - 00:22:00.646, Speaker A: I mean, you could have started the show with this piece, I say to myself. So anyway, I don't know if I'll ever cure myself of this rhetorical affliction of the. So anyways, but I will try. I'm going to continue to try. And we shall see if we shall win at this game. Uyoh. 66 gm friends so just another physical work.
00:22:00.646 - 00:22:30.294, Speaker A: And I thought, pretty interesting. I mean, it looks like real paper, doesn't it? Here we can see the pencil. So it makes you wonder if uyoh 66 starts with pencil some more just physical work. And I kind of hope that Uyoh 66 does. And shout out, thanks for the comment, uyoh. I kind of hope that they do because this is very sellable. And could you imagine if there was physical versions of some of Uyoh 60 six's work? I'm sure there are already.
00:22:30.294 - 00:23:13.554, Speaker A: So interesting, Yoao Salazar just in the studio, I thought this was a cool studio shot and we can sort of see. I love how this plasticine works here. It's put on a, like a painting, what do you call these things? On an easel? It's put on an easel and a great shot. I mean, this looks like a true artist shot here. There's some work in the background, the artist in the studio, and there's the plasticine kind of, you know, dripping off, so to speak. So anyways, very cool. Also, Mick Renders, who was mentioning the collabs in the comments there.
00:23:13.554 - 00:23:56.276, Speaker A: The Tezos community is the best. I'm still learning every day, but it felt a warm welcome and can't state enough how ready I am to show the world what I got. The talent amongst you all is insane. I see what this can be and I'm so happy to be here. Yeah, I think this speaks for a lot of people and I'm not sure if Mickrenders how new Mick renders might be to the community, but I think a lot of people like, I'm extraordinarily grateful for really the NFT scene, but a lot of it, you know, on tazos, it's very grounded on tazos because the prices aren't as crazy. So it's a little more perhaps grounded. But I'm a fan of the whole digital art NFT scene and everything.
00:23:56.276 - 00:24:31.040, Speaker A: And it's great to have real community as an artist because it's actually surprisingly difficult to find. You wouldn't think so. But, you know, it's actually hard to find a supportive, fun, cool, talented community and it's kind of all happening online. So I want to highlight this comment. Here's another example. So Lord, who like, we've looked at Lord's work a while ago on super rare and so maybe you're familiar, sells for a lot of money as big collectors. There's Vincent van Doe, right.
00:24:31.040 - 00:24:53.824, Speaker A: 40 00 60 00 30 00 70 00 Right. So, and a lot of work does very well. So Lord started on object. We sold out still speechless for all the good things that have been happening in my life today. And today, another victory. Thank you all for the amazing support coming from this amazing community. I will always do my best.
00:24:53.824 - 00:25:14.660, Speaker A: No matter what the market situation is, I will always be here creating, exploring and manifesting my visions. So kind of summing up this whole kind of news section here in one tweet here. So congratulations to Lord and let's take a look. I'll show you. So here's the work. Show me how to play this. Lord's genesis on object.
00:25:14.660 - 00:25:40.356, Speaker A: So this is the first and only piece Lord has put on object, as far as I understand. So a kind of a skeletal figure here with Rubik's cubes in it. It feels like AI. I'm not exactly sure. Maybe we can go. So just kind of an interesting dark piece and surrealism in the tags here. And let's just see if there's any more clues here.
00:25:40.356 - 00:25:54.730, Speaker A: Artist and father. And let's again go to the super rare and just see if there are any clues. Digital artists. So not many clues here. Interesting here, like here. It looks like some digital photography. If we.
00:25:54.730 - 00:26:22.720, Speaker A: If this loads up on the tree, see this. Or at least like, you know, some kind of. This looks photographic, shall we say? But who knows? And look at this. So a really interesting artist. So anyways, it's gonna be very difficult to stop that habit. So this sold for 30 tazos and so an edition of 100. And I think that sold out amazingly.
00:26:22.720 - 00:26:43.168, Speaker A: So that is 3000 tezos. So starting with a bang, it's probably on object.com. Yeah, there it is. 3573 for Lord's object. So that is very impressive start to the journey on object. There's Ezra Eslund. We're going to look at some Ezra Eslin's in a second.
00:26:43.168 - 00:27:10.336, Speaker A: Rosatio, who to follow? So a new work by Rosatjo. I'm not sure if this is the monster. It is part of the monstrum series. So almost like these. It's almost like action figures of a sort here. These characters made out of collage, a head of an. Kind of as an eye and almost like a polaroid photograph as a wind Mac window and more.
00:27:10.336 - 00:27:37.176, Speaker A: So anyways, classic rosacea. A little bit of animation in the background. The moon, this egg returns and just kind of cool. Almost like crustaceans, almost like crab legs or something. And then there's like octopus with an eye. So anyways, cool work by Rosaceo, who to follow, edition of seven and transferred maybe to people in the community. I think Rosecho might have a discord.
00:27:37.176 - 00:27:54.514, Speaker A: So it could be related to that too. Uri J collaborating with fake whale. Octopomachy. Desperate struggle between the octopuses. The octopi, octopuses and thyme. So let's see if we can find. I think the octopi are over here.
00:27:54.514 - 00:28:36.092, Speaker A: And it looks. They almost look like cherubs with a little bow and arrows here, these like octopus cherubs. And anyways, there is a old camera and there is a massive clock that looks like a door. So kind of a half representational, half abstract work with a lot of digital experimentation inside of it. You can see here the dragged, you know, brush, all sorts of stuff. And look at the arrows coming in from these kind of cupid type figures here at the pointing at the clock. Interestingly so, kind of a lot of big themes going in here.
00:28:36.092 - 00:29:07.934, Speaker A: Love and time seem to be conflated here, hidden among the images here. So let's just see. And there's an offer, but nothing listed yet. An experimental piece by RJ, a digital collage of acrylic on canvas. So this looks like paint and it has been put in this digital window here. The waves grew and crashed upon themselves. So maybe a description, the painted imagery.
00:29:07.934 - 00:29:29.422, Speaker A: So a multimedia work, a photograph of painting that is inside this window here. So very conceptual. Sea voices by RJ. And let's just see if this was listed edition of one and not listed for sale yet. I don't think so. Interesting. Kappa sage.
00:29:29.422 - 00:29:51.454, Speaker A: Shine and pain. Shine in the clothes, pain in the eyes. And this is an edition of 20 for 430. And still a few available here. And always really ambitious compositions from Kappa Sage here. Really cool. Like, it feels like the equivalent of kind of like modern.
00:29:51.454 - 00:30:20.524, Speaker A: Kind of like it's like street art, but it's like street painting. Like, there's a lot of the themes that you'd almost find in street art, but applied to digital painting to a certain degree. This is interesting too here. Almost like the Louis Vuitton pattern and whatnot. There's always a ton going on and it's always kind of edgy with kapasage and a lot of logos and everything. Cool work. Great color, interesting composition, as usual.
00:30:20.524 - 00:30:33.428, Speaker A: So a few have sold here. Quite a few have sold. So this is an edition of 20, I feel like. Is this updated? Yeah. There are three left. There are only three left. This was interesting.
00:30:33.428 - 00:31:02.868, Speaker A: Amanda Holm with the women's museum. Don't call me baby. So a pretty nice work here. Nice kind of surreal eyes in the roses here. And then a phone with kind of like the outline is kind of changed with the Gif or is kind of, you know, the blue is not coordinated with the underneath. Kind of an interesting technique here. And it's this old rotary phone.
00:31:02.868 - 00:31:31.688, Speaker A: So kind of retro tech in a kind of, it almost feels like a Valentine's Day card of sorts. But then you have these roses here and almost in a kind of water, it feels like here. So anyways, a lot going on here. And so 111 tezos, it's an addition of one. So there you go. Amanda Holmum. Let's just see if we've looked at Amanda Holman before, trying to remember.
00:31:31.688 - 00:31:55.784, Speaker A: Maybe. Maybe. Let's see. Okay, so continuing on, continuing on, Joni B with a really poetic work here, the playground. Very poetic. Sticking with Joni B's style here. And again, we're back to this idea of the static, this contrast between the dynamic and the static, between the moving and the still.
00:31:55.784 - 00:32:37.386, Speaker A: And here, I think it just, again, and what we've seen in other works that use this contrast or this technique is, it really seems to just infuse importance and significance into the still areas. It kind of, for whatever reason, having this moving area adds significance to the still area, I would argue. Interesting composition here, let me show it to you. Not full screen, so you can see that, you know it's in the bottom, right. So there's all this negative space here, which is maybe going according to Joanie's idea here. The playground feels empty. In fact, it is.
00:32:37.386 - 00:32:52.682, Speaker A: No one seems to feel like swinging at midnight, so maybe it's a swing at midnight. Very cool work. Only 22 tezos for this edition of one of A. Joanie B. Joanie B released a few, couple of others, too. I haven't seen a ton from Joanie B. That I've seen recently.
00:32:52.682 - 00:33:16.028, Speaker A: Here's another one, the boar and the Molotov cocktail with GM on it. So all available. One of ones from Joanie B. That's pretty cool. Ezra Eslint, addition of 20 for 20 tezos each. Almost like a. What is this? Is this like an ad? It's got a pop feel to it.
00:33:16.028 - 00:33:48.700, Speaker A: Are you sad? Drink energy, ingredients, unhappiness, sadness, tears, your excess blood, anxiety of living, depression, heartbreak. The best flavor, the most delicious. It feels like an ad, almost like a billboard, but with a lot of messaging on it. Done with Ezra Eslin's trademark broken line style. These lines that are just kind of broken every so often, which really creates her trademark look. Interesting piece. Juice, digital art, illustration.
00:33:48.700 - 00:34:27.826, Speaker A: And there are eight left from Ezra Eslin. So very cool. It's not often you can buy these on primary. They usually go really quickly. And here is an edgy work by Turkirak, also kind of in the edgy illustration section. Should you put ice in your whiskey? And so here it looks like a drowned, you know, girlfriend or wife or, who knows, person, woman in this drink here. So I don't even know what's going on here, but it felt like, kind of edgy and kind of feels like these works could hang together in the same show.
00:34:27.826 - 00:34:49.138, Speaker A: Here's another illustration, Julie Rose, whose work we looked at a while ago. Crystal spaceship. So just a cool illustration edition of ten. And kind of interesting colors here. Just kind of a semi abstract work here. And so just cool illustration. Let's just look at Julie Rose quickly because I'm sure we've looked at her work before.
00:34:49.138 - 00:35:19.054, Speaker A: Just a cool illustrator here, a watercolor, digital artists between galaxies. So anyways, that is Julie Rose. Cool, kind of surreal illustration. Elna Frederick, Trademark style here, edition of ten. I thought this one was pretty cool, again, using some sort of optical illusion to create the sense of movement. And so anyways, I really enjoyed the flowers here. So standard deck 91.
00:35:19.054 - 00:35:41.054, Speaker A: And let's just see. These sold for ten tezos on primary. They sold out within, like, two minutes here. Impressively so that is impressive. And so now it's available for $26.90 on secondary Haiti rockette with a new abstract using. What was that software called again? Brilliance.
00:35:41.054 - 00:35:59.954, Speaker A: Brilliance 2.0. Memory breaking. Really cool title. Amiga 1200 Photoshop. So here is another work with a lot of dithering and just digital fun going on here. Cycling gradients and more. So really just playing with the software.
00:35:59.954 - 00:36:19.050, Speaker A: Really cool work. Memory break in available on, I think, primary here. Five left at 37 tazos. Check this out. I was tempted to start with this because we've discussed this before, this idea. This is Kappn. Kaoru is the name.
00:36:19.050 - 00:37:04.156, Speaker A: So maybe that's a bird, maybe it's something else. Technically, I'm excited by this process here, because what it looks like to me, and I could be totally wrong as far as how Kappan made this, but what it looks like to me is two different canvas sizes put on top of each other. Because here you have what looks like really big blocks, you know, with a smaller canvas size. Let's say this is like, I don't know, 40 by 40. And then maybe this underneath with the smaller pixels is maybe a 80 or 100 by 100. And then, so you can take one layer, put it on the other, stretch it with no issues or artifacts. And you start getting super interesting results.
00:37:04.156 - 00:37:23.644, Speaker A: I have no idea if this is how it was made, but that is a way you can kind of get these kind of results. So super interesting from Kappn. Very, very, very interesting. At least from over here, another just cool work by Kappan. Just plain with dithering here. And it looks like an eye or a sun or something. Circles.
00:37:23.644 - 00:37:37.004, Speaker A: No title, no clues. And it looks like an eye. It looks like an eye, according to what kappan is saying here. Kind of reminiscent of that. Magritte. Should we look at Magritte quickly? Magritte. I.
00:37:37.004 - 00:38:02.746, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, kind of. One could argue at least it's in the same style. Like, who knows if there was direct influence but a similar composition, we could say between this and let's see if we can load it. And this in the same province, we could say. And here's another. Tezos art collective is getting artists to do signatures. And I thought kappens especially.
00:38:02.746 - 00:38:32.714, Speaker A: Pretty awesome. So very fun. Very cool. And you know what it looks like? I think we're back to this larger canvas, like, stretching out this pixel art, reusing pixel art, because this looks like something from plants. This looks like some of the psychedelic kind of imagery we see in plants that's being masked here, but then extended. And we have the same thing going on here in this. We have these larger pixels contrasting with these smaller pixels.
00:38:32.714 - 00:39:11.342, Speaker A: Very powerful, isn't it? Like, it really just invigorates this whole image with these different pixel sizes. It's a simple thing, but it's, you know, sometimes the simplest things are the most profound, simple innovation. So very exciting. This is from Loac me, if I'm pronouncing that right, just a cool abstract. And I think Loac me has put out several, like, classic kind of works on object of these. Just kind of beautiful, you know, pixel art, sometimes they're representational, I think. Here's Remy Forte.
00:39:11.342 - 00:39:38.924, Speaker A: And, of course, Remy uses code to make some of her abstracts. This artwork was generated by a Python script I designed, PNG file made in my studio in Lyon, France. So five tazos here. So interesting. I think we were seeing Remy work, remember, with the pen plotter? So. And this is a thing like, imagine what this would look like. These kind of, you know, basic digital shapes here.
00:39:38.924 - 00:40:25.120, Speaker A: Once you start pen plotting, all of a sudden you get the accidental of the physical entering the randomness of the physical, instant contrast, and it starts to look really great. So it's really interesting going to the physical, using the digital as a starting point. And then you use these pen plotters to get back to the physical, to make physical work that, frankly, was not possible without machine. In other words, the pen plotter or without, you know, theoretically you could make this on graph paper, but this was made with code, you know, so digitally made abstraction. So this traveling back to the physical, starting with the digital, I think, is super interesting. More jokes from Sabato. The market may be bare, but the crown is bullish with spry vigor.
00:40:25.120 - 00:41:06.434, Speaker A: What words of wisdom will the newest legendary king and consort ETH offer us peasant artists? So Sabato is off on a limb here when. More frog drat. So more Pepe reference, perhaps? So almost like, again, even like the way this is done, kind of feels like a cartoon a little bit. This kind of edgy painting, too. I mean, and I also like this. And maybe Sabato would laugh that I'm even showing, you know, showing this work, because maybe it was just a joke, but I actually really enjoy what's going on, and I suspect Sabato does as well. Look at all this great noise in the background here.
00:41:06.434 - 00:41:31.986, Speaker A: And again, look at this. Remember we were discussing how if you want instant poetry, put the background first and then put the outline over top. I mean, to a certain degree, we see a little bit of that here where the background. And then just put some lines over top they don't need to match. And so it's looking really good over here. And just kind of funny from Sabato. So kind of mysterious.
00:41:31.986 - 00:41:57.994, Speaker A: I mean, I don't know where Sabato is going with that, but I kind of love it at the same time. Guandanarian was a super small, minimal pixel artwork. Very cool. So interesting to see. Now, just for our reference here, Guandanarian. Like, we've seen pixel art from Gundanarian before. Let me quickly see if I can bring this up.
00:41:57.994 - 00:42:13.446, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. Object and Guan Denarian. Yeah. Works like this. So just cool abstraction here. So a nice kind of minimal piece.
00:42:13.446 - 00:42:33.982, Speaker A: There we go. And then, of course, kind of in the pixel art factory style. So here's some Guanarian. And, of course, we looked at this self portrait for people of tezos, which was awesome. Very cool. Here's a new artist, my insert coin. Classic arcade game where players must insert coins into a machine and use a joystick and buttons to control, play or die.
00:42:33.982 - 00:42:51.018, Speaker A: So a skeleton basically playing an old arcade game. So pretty cool edition of 20. And there they are, three tezos. And looks like it sold out. So a nice start at $0.50 each. And now there's McRender's there.
00:42:51.018 - 00:43:03.546, Speaker A: Google. Lytus, Shilley Preston. Yeah. So awesome. So cool work. And again, Myu is new. So a nice welcoming over here from the community there.
00:43:03.546 - 00:43:26.240, Speaker A: Just sold out on your first drop. That is awesome. The cobbler by tombhambattle. So a new work by tombatl. Endlessly experimenting with content and with the themes and everything. So now his character is a cobbler putting together shoes. And there we see some Sci-Fi machinery and some just really nice animation there.
00:43:26.240 - 00:43:46.982, Speaker A: Especially up here with this kind of robotic arm. So it continues. Love this too. See these pixels in the background here? That is awesome. And even the little mouse. Okay, so anyways, great, eight tezos, 90 on secondary. And let's just look, seven tezos on primary.
00:43:46.982 - 00:44:04.874, Speaker A: Sold out. So nice work from Tombumbatl. Zach Lloyd. So a different work from Zach Lloyd here. And let me speed things up a bit here. So this was interesting. Lonely tower, kind of a windows interface here.
00:44:04.874 - 00:44:29.174, Speaker A: Well, similar to what we were seeing with RJ. And then just different weather. I'm gonna speed it up a bit because it is a minute and so just to give you a feeling for it. And then we have a clock up there. The stars like the rating, some money. So just mysterious work from Zach Lloyd. Lonely tower tourist season 23 by one of one for 33 tazos.
00:44:29.174 - 00:44:49.864, Speaker A: This was cool too. Curio French. Look at this. Very experimental and cool. Again, again. Reminds me of like hasdrubal waffle, where we're getting the spray, but it's almost like dithered. The spray paint here, there's almost like if you look up close, you can see a little bit of dithering.
00:44:49.864 - 00:45:04.452, Speaker A: And then that contrasted with like a big kind of chunky background. Again, different. But you know, it could hang in the same show as some hasdrubal waffle pieces. Right. And would really compliment it, I think. Really cool work. 5000 views.
00:45:04.452 - 00:45:15.748, Speaker A: Not bad at all. Good morning. So that's Curio Fringe. Very cool. Here was an interesting. I think this is a glitch. Bloom raw Cheperton french glitch.
00:45:15.748 - 00:45:41.754, Speaker A: Artists making videos and breaking them with code. So I think you'd call this data bending if that's what's going on here. And so this is just basically a cool glitch abstract by Cheperton. And that is on Twitter. And continuing on, DJ Curo with a cool work here. Let's see if we can load this up. Just a cool minimal work here with a little bit of a glitch.
00:45:41.754 - 00:46:08.764, Speaker A: Kind of a really nice warm quality to the pixels here. Warm color and just a warm feeling overall. So let's see if there's a title. Almost feels like a de curico kind of still life here. A one umpteen billion years big bang supernova gas, brief eclipse of time. So cool glitch from TJ Curo. Three left at three tezos.
00:46:08.764 - 00:46:35.080, Speaker A: Small addition, LB IO 364 using physical hardware here. And this is an edition of 15. I wonder if this is 800 by 600 as well. So interesting kind of combination. Interesting abstract in a sense. A glitch abstract, shall we say, 15 left. So none have sold so far if this is updated.
00:46:35.080 - 00:46:59.424, Speaker A: So I think just released this morning, though. So work from LB available. Too late to say goodbye. John Cates with a really nice kind of cowboy piece. Again, another glitch artist. And I wonder if John Cates says how this is made. No, but maybe AI art, mechanical interventions, glitch art, AI, glitch western.
00:46:59.424 - 00:47:11.124, Speaker A: Anyways, really nice piece here from John Cates. Great color, just great composition. Just cool and fun. So it's AI. This is a 101. Let's just see what it sold for. Just transferred to inavare.
00:47:11.124 - 00:47:36.044, Speaker A: Very cool. And native ed with a cool work. It's got me thinking based on CCO board faunus statue. So I think that's a famous statue of like a pan like figure. So. But put in this kind of tron like backdrop with some even big pixels in the background that you can kind of half see in this interesting door. Cool work by native Ed.
00:47:36.044 - 00:48:01.814, Speaker A: Got a speed through the rest here. Kramer and McRenders. McRenders again in the program here. So cool work here again, this is like a CGI type of thing. Just really interesting and kind of surreal. Entering portals with McRender's computer landscape, zero seven. Remember we were seeing the screen prints of these works, so they're collaborating with McRender's venta bed of leaves.
00:48:01.814 - 00:48:21.004, Speaker A: Venta times AI. Just another really interesting, beautiful AI work by venta. So really interesting and cool. Kind of has a plasticine feeling to it, doesn't it? Addition of ten, nine left at eight tezos, each. Nice blue. This blue is not like, it's not flat. Interestingly.
00:48:21.004 - 00:48:46.034, Speaker A: Very nice work. And strange thing made in AI. This is on Instagram. And I wonder if we have 27, 44 likes here so far. And here is so plain with jewelry. It looks like diamonds and almost these like venetian masks somewhat, but just different kinds of masks. Let's see if there's anything.
00:48:46.034 - 00:49:28.300, Speaker A: Renaissance head ornaments revival. So very cool. I mean, look at this look at the innovation. How many fashion innovations a strange thing come up with in the last six months, like Vogue Italia, to their credit, have finally, like, come to the party and said, like, this guy. We have to pay attention to this guy. It's pretty, like, I mean, it's just innovation every day using AI, you know, harnessing the power of AI, the digital assistant, you know, just kind of takes your talent and can multiply it by ten. Properly harnessed, you know, with me always, but not my friend, intro void.
00:49:28.300 - 00:49:46.016, Speaker A: So here's, I think, Lily illo actually posted on this. This is an AI work, I believe, and just beautiful drips here. I mean, some of the most great, like, I'm loving the painterly aspect of AI. It's creating these beautiful drips. So, like, I. Yeah. And here it is, just another example.
00:49:46.016 - 00:50:07.210, Speaker A: Cool composition here from intro void with me always, but not my friend by for ten tazo, seven left. That is on object. And here's just other work by intro void. And I think I brought up another one here. Let's just see if it loads. Here it is. And kind of painterly digital painting and AI.
00:50:07.210 - 00:50:35.800, Speaker A: Huge file, Santiago esque file here. And. Yeah, so anyways, just digital painting and AI from intro void, the companions, that is from April 20. And here's just another one from Steven Schwarzer. I liked how this, this is more of a. You can see he's experimenting with these different kind of almost like collage here. He's experimenting with structure in the work here.
00:50:35.800 - 00:51:03.380, Speaker A: And here we almost see, like, a physical version of the Photoshop canvas, which really creates a beautiful black and white neutral contrast with all the color that's going around. Just a really cool artist. And look at Dan control. Old gradients. So this is an old painting, I believe, by Dan control. This is a beautiful painting, isn't it? Like, I mean, a beautifully painted Dan. And what's funny is I'd never guess that this was Dan control.
00:51:03.380 - 00:51:20.012, Speaker A: You know, it's like he took his concept of the gradients and ran with it in digital. But, I mean, this is a great painting. So that is cool. We'd love to see more. Jean Saucis, good morning. With a new Tezos mint graphite charcoal drawing. So another physical work here.
00:51:20.012 - 00:51:41.044, Speaker A: And just a cool kind of semi abstract work by Jean Saucis. Looks like there's some mouths and ears and eyes sort of in here. So semi abstract, almost like a face upside down here, stretched out, playing with stuff. Geography is the name of the work. Cool title. And that is your show, my friends. Thank you for joining me.
00:51:41.044 - 00:51:51.054, Speaker A: And until next time, take care. Maybe I'll see you on Twitter spaces join us in Daniel W. And Roontoon. Until next time, take care. Sa.
