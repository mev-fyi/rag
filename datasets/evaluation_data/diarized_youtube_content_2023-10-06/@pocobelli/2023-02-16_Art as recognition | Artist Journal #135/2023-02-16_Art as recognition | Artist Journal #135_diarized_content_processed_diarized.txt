00:00:04.320 - 00:00:32.158, Speaker A: The cough medicine, the cold medicine is starting to hit, ladies and gentlemen. So it should be a fun episode today. Welcome back. Artist Journal, February 16, 2023. Broadcasting to the world from Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pokerbelly, artist reporter. A word which we're going to go, a concept which we will go into in a future episode.
00:00:32.158 - 00:00:57.794, Speaker A: We have gone through it in the past. And big shout out to the people who are watching the previous episodes. I got a couple of messages there and some people are watching the old episodes. And I tell you, it's evergreen content. You know, that's the beautiful thing about art. If you're choosing, okay, which we all hope we're doing, that becomes evergreen content. You know, like a museum is like the ultimate evergreen content.
00:00:57.794 - 00:01:36.254, Speaker A: You know, I look at this work here and I think this belongs in a museum in MoMA, in the entrance of MoMA. This is where I would love to see this in real time, you know, a real time response to a news story. The balloon, and I think that's the title here. Shall we look at the title very quickly, balloon time. And we see a balloon here with this gorgeously dithered sunset and a balloon with some surveillance gear on it, seemingly and released by Sabato. Another wonderful work by Sabato. It is an open edition and we'll talk about that in a second.
00:01:36.254 - 00:02:24.354, Speaker A: But a real time response to current events and a picture of our time, really, everybody's talking about the balloon out there. Imagine, you know, MoMA had a real time, you know, gallery or where they switched it up, at least the image in the entrance. I haven't been to MoMA in seven years, so I assume there's an image in the entrance from that AI exhibition we saw that they had three or four months ago. But imagine you could walk in and you're going to see a different work go there on a Saturday, and then next Saturday there's a different work in the entrance. Maybe they already do that, I don't know. But imagine there's a whole room or series of rooms that switches every week with just the latest and greatest digital art appearing on the screen. You can do that.
00:02:24.354 - 00:02:52.210, Speaker A: And frankly, from a curatorial point of view, I don't think it would be that hard. And it doesn't have to be perfect. People understand, okay, this is made in the last week. They will be forgiving and if anything, they'll look in awe at all the creativity that we are remarking here on on a almost daily basis. So welcome back, everyone, and big congrats to Sabato. For this fantastic, beautiful work here. So many great things happening in it.
00:02:52.210 - 00:03:43.078, Speaker A: And an open edition, which is a new format here from object. So it is selling for three tazos. 33 45 have been minted. So it'll be interesting to see how many mint and how this goes for the artist. This is, again, a new format for object. So another thing that you might notice here is you can pay with credit card now, which is a very smart thing to do, I think, especially in this kind of. As the regulations come down, it may not be as simple to buy your tezos at Binance or Coinbase soon, who knows? So object is wisely hedging their bets and saying, hey, you can just send this to your crypto wallet, which anybody can set up, and then you can buy, you know, and this is almost, interestingly, an entrance into the ecosystem.
00:03:43.078 - 00:04:19.244, Speaker A: It is an onboarding of sorts, because I can pay with my visa, but then in theory, I could sell this work for four tezos, five tezos, whatever, at some point. And I will get that. I'll have tezos in my wallet. Right? So it's an interesting kind of onboarding of sorts, isn't it? So, anyways, cool stuff going on at object. So happy to see that. And thanks to go, go. Lightest big shout out for that wonderful Twitter spaces conversation that we had yesterday with roontune.
00:04:19.244 - 00:04:41.477, Speaker A: And. And there was another guy who was just a huge fan of gogolitis, and he was just so thrilled to hear. So that was a really fun interview so that you can find online, and I will be uploading these to Spotify shortly. A lot of quotable moments in there, so. And gogolite us. You see the depth. So big shout out.
00:04:41.477 - 00:05:10.446, Speaker A: Thank you again for showing up to the Twitter spaces. That was awesome. Just thank you. In order for a couple of bidders here, I have a new work. Thank you to Polly Jojo and Billie Jo. So I have an auction going on right now for bacchanal, and this work here is based on a. This is how I always imagined AI to be used, which is as a resource, as a reference.
00:05:10.446 - 00:05:36.274, Speaker A: Right? And so. Oh, wouldn't that be great just for compositional ideas. So I made a raw AI in mid journey of a bacchanal, so to speak, and got some pretty interesting results. And I was like, oh, let's play with this. And then, so I put this in the digital, the pixel art sketchbook and you. So I'm mixing dithered with sort of solid but still square brushes here. So we're having a lot of fun here, and I'm liking the effect.
00:05:36.274 - 00:06:01.344, Speaker A: And so anyways, it's very fun to have a digital sketchbook here where you can do all sorts of experiments here. So big shout out to the bidders. And that'll be on for another few hours, probably another 12 hours or so, maybe 10 hours from when I broadcast this. So thank you again. And this is hilarious too. Pauly Jojo. He said he put pokebelly into mid, I think it was mid journey or into AI.
00:06:01.344 - 00:06:28.040, Speaker A: And this is what came out. And I love it. Like, I couldn't be more happy to be, you know, that AI thinks it's palm trees and a beach. I wonder if it's the Twitter, because I have a UFO and a palm tree and a wave. You know, a beach sort of palm tree and a wave. Maybe that's why. So anyways, interesting, great output here.
00:06:28.040 - 00:06:52.760, Speaker A: So I was just thrilled and I just thought that was hilarious. So thank you for letting me share that, Pauly Jojo. A quick couple of comments here on. Just comments we've been making and responses from the artist. So I forgot to mention this last episode, but this is super interesting. This is hasdrubal waffle. And I was discussing the neats that he's been working on, the PFP profile picture project, kind of.
00:06:52.760 - 00:07:11.390, Speaker A: I don't want to call it satire. I mean, I guess you could think of it as a satire, but, you know, reference or themed. You know, PFP style works. And I was suggesting, okay, it looks like Mario paint. And I'd heard something at one point. Anyway, he helped clarify. Thank you for featuring some neats.
00:07:11.390 - 00:07:29.190, Speaker A: The name of the project, Pokebelly. Yes. The recent batch are Mario paint. I try to switch them up after every ten or so. After every ten? So the previous ones were kid pics. I've never even heard of kid pics. And the ten after Mario will be dpaint, I think.
00:07:29.190 - 00:07:38.444, Speaker A: Thank you again. Glad you liked them. I love them. And thank you for sharing that. Like, I think this is fascinating. You know, that's why, you know. Yeah, like, I'm.
00:07:38.444 - 00:07:50.844, Speaker A: I was gonna say, that's why artists watch this program. As you learn stuff like this. This is useful information. Hasdrubal, thank you for sharing. And fascinating. I mean, those textures are just wonderful. So big.
00:07:50.844 - 00:08:11.970, Speaker A: Congrats on the innovation. You know, like, that's using child apps, digital art apps. I mean, it's brilliant. It's simple, but it's brilliant. Whoa. Who else is doing that? Like, not many people. I think a lot of us have thought about it, but then to do it and then to succeed artistically with it, make great works is kind of another matter.
00:08:11.970 - 00:08:41.172, Speaker A: Execution is everything. And a quick shout out to Gogolitis here, who commented yesterday before the spaces, and we're discussing this idea of signatures and signing your work with digital art and how that is an interesting topic. Right? Like that work. I was just showing the bacchanal. If I had put pokebelly signed with kind of like a dithered signature, I'm not sure it would work. So that's why I didn't sign it. Sometimes signing ads here, I'd say it adds, like you see here at the bottom.
00:08:41.172 - 00:09:02.732, Speaker A: Right. You'll see gogolitis here. I love it. And so I was commenting on how gogolitis signs his work, and he replied, and again, it's awesome to get these replies here. I started to sign my work because I was a bit afraid of copy minters when I began. And in the end, I think it's a good idea. And so that's really interesting.
00:09:02.732 - 00:09:44.578, Speaker A: And I could understand that, especially with his work, because it's really attractive. And you could imagine if nobody knows who you are, and then you're just starting to mint, and then someone takes it and then copy mints, and then nobody knows who you are, so you sign the work. So that is cool. And again, we've seen artists like, again, one don't knows and popple, who have signed their work as well. In the end, I think it's a good idea. I do too, if it can work. And I think from an aesthetic level, and I think sometimes a signature adds, like when Magritte or if I make a physical drawing, I would definitely sign that, because usually a signature, it just makes it look complete.
00:09:44.578 - 00:10:14.906, Speaker A: There are, you know, again, Magritte's signature there. It's beautiful. It kind of adds to the work, interestingly. So, anyways, it's a fun discussion, the kind of aesthetic and, you know, aesthetic quality of signing your work and just what that means in the digital art space and where it works and where it doesn't. Continuing on, big correction. So, first of all, it is not the Los Angeles contemporary Museum of Art. It is the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
00:10:14.906 - 00:10:51.100, Speaker A: Okay, so I clearly haven't been there, but I'll have to go. Apparently it's a major museum here. And as well, Cosimo did, in fact, donate his works here. So he donated this cryptopunk here, which is probably worth millions. And this other work isn't cheap either, so that was donated. Announcing the first donation of on chain art from a collector to a museum and the largest digital fine art collection to enter a museum that. I'm not sure if it's true, though, but I'm.
00:10:51.100 - 00:11:20.482, Speaker A: But I don't know. But I don't know. But I mean, there's like, I mean, I think of my friend wolf at the digital art museum here in Berlin, and he might wonder about that claim because. Yeah, so anyways, 22 works from the Cosimo de Medici collection have been added to the permanent collection of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. So anyways, that's super cool. And we're wondering what the institutions are doing and if they care. Well, here's evidence that they care, and here's their website.
00:11:20.482 - 00:12:09.630, Speaker A: And it looks pretty good. Like, it's really nicely curated here on the front. It's pretty interesting, like all the images and everything. And they even have like a little bit of a shout out to the metaverse here. Metavesarly, you know, it's some digital work here. So interesting, isn't it? And you know, as the crypto, as a seemingly bull market gets started here, and I think it could end at any minute here, you wonder about the timing of these things because all of a sudden the institutions might go, okay, how about now? Because as we were mentioning in Twitter spaces about a month ago, NFT and crypto wasn't really going to make you too many friends if you start mentioning that at a party two months ago. Oh, I love nfts and crypto.
00:12:09.630 - 00:12:30.386, Speaker A: Although to be fair, I get questions every time I go to a social event. Every. I'm always talking about nfts, and it's not because I'm bringing it up. People are asking me. So that is interesting, you know, and people who are usually outside the ecosystem. So that is interesting. There is interest out there.
00:12:30.386 - 00:12:52.948, Speaker A: And look at this. Sainte Pompidou, le Saintre Papidoux is here. I'll translate this for you guys. Acquires a set of works dealing with the relationship between blockchain and artistic creation, including its first nfts. 18 projects by 13 french and international artists are included in the collection. So another cryptopunk. So they acquired these.
00:12:52.948 - 00:13:36.094, Speaker A: So pretty interesting. And I brought up the press release here, and there is no english version of this, but basically it says it is the time for nfts at the Centre pompidou. Now, for those that might not know, the Saintre Pompidou is basically the museum of modern Art for Paris. So it is a major contemporary art museum, like one of the top. So that is interesting. We wonder out loud to ourselves here, what are the institutions doing? You wonder if the timing is a little better now with crypto, the animal spirits coming back into the crypto markets, at least temporarily. Maybe the institutions are feeling they can do it now.
00:13:36.094 - 00:14:01.126, Speaker A: You know, you do wonder about the timing, because we see two, you know, interesting institutions, prominent institutions, making moves. And here is the announcement from object.com just on the open editions. We're thrilled to announce that open editions on object are just around the corner. They are a new type of contract, fully in control of creators. More info soon. So they are having a bit of a festival about it.
00:14:01.126 - 00:14:20.716, Speaker A: To celebrate this feature, we are hosting a week long open edition event. Object unlocked will take place from February 15 to February 22. During this time, you have the possibility to make your open editions for the first time on object.com dot. And of course, that first work by Sabato we saw there is an open edition. I think popple put one out too. So that is cool.
00:14:20.716 - 00:15:00.538, Speaker A: Great to see innovation from object as well as the credit cards. So they are doing things. Maybe we'll get curation next. So another concept piece from Robnisv two, a similar idea in the sense from the right click save as guy, which he right clicked save as x copies work called right click save as and then uploaded it. A brilliant move, which we all loved out here. And he kind of has another one again. And what is this? This is kind of like, again, this idea of art as recognition, you know, the idea of kind of calling something art is enough to transform it into art.
00:15:00.538 - 00:15:33.682, Speaker A: So we see another. Another move to do that here. A most unlikely banksy trash art incident. And so this is a banksy that was made on Valentine's Day. So just, you know, two days ago, and Banksy created a new piece in Margate City, a city in southeastern England on Valentine's Day 2023. Originally made with a freezer in place, the city removed it, thus sparking outrage for tampering with the artwork. This wheelie bin was put in replacement until city officials returned the freezer after modifying it for safety reasons.
00:15:33.682 - 00:15:46.986, Speaker A: However, I see this as bonafide trash art. So he's saying, look. Look at the trash bin. This is trash art. And I feel the wheelie bin should be protected. His Banksy's piece currently is by a plastic shield. That's just me, though.
00:15:46.986 - 00:16:14.934, Speaker A: So that is kind of hilarious. So anyways, another open edition from Robnisv two in a similar spirit. Again, I want to call this art as recognition. Continuing on another edition, this time limited from axin. So we saw a fragment of this, and now here is the full work. I feel like I recognize the structure of this work, but I'm not sure. It kind of feels like.
00:16:14.934 - 00:16:45.906, Speaker A: But I'm not sure. Again, it kind of echoes Magritte or dali or something, but maybe it's someone completely different, or maybe it's Oxym's own composition, I'm not sure. But it's beautifully executed, as usual, managing to get these beautiful textures here, but for it to feel entirely digital at the same time. And so here it is, all minted out edition of 20 for 0.333 ETH. So a cool, you know, 6.6 ETH, 6.66
00:16:45.906 - 00:17:17.544, Speaker A: ETH, 666 ETH for axing. So interesting work, alive, maybe a topic that's on his mind right now. Essence of tyranny based on Christ and child by Carl's block. So let's quickly look at the work, and then we'll look at the Carl's block reference quickly. So we see what seems to be a mother and child here, or a parent and child with a big stop on the head of the child. So parents telling their children to stop. And so the essence of tyranny.
00:17:17.544 - 00:17:49.304, Speaker A: So a little commentary there from oxen, and I think we see axin's picture here, a little stuck on this column here. And the end is near and by to redeem. Is this a clue, ladies and gentlemen? Is this a clue buy to redeem? Because I didn't see any. Maybe it's just graffiti of referencing the culture. Anyways, essence of tyranny based on Christ and child by Carl's block. Here it is. So an interesting work.
00:17:49.304 - 00:18:19.376, Speaker A: I mean, this is kind of the kind of thing you'd see at your friend's mom who has a image in her office or something of the Lord. And so here it is. And I'll just go back for contrast here. So you get a clue into oxygen's process here and how he looks for images. Interesting choice, isn't it? So, Carl's block, who I hadn't heard of before. So another RJ work on the scene. So RJ is on fire.
00:18:19.376 - 00:18:44.114, Speaker A: Current bid, 0.2 ETH. And this expires, this auction ends in 2 hours and 16 minutes. The blue computer. And this looks like Will Barnett was a cat lover, and his works repeatedly depict people he knew intimately, interacting in various ways with cats. So will Barnett, another artist who I'm not familiar with, and so a really cool one. Many people love the cats, as I do.
00:18:44.114 - 00:19:11.744, Speaker A: And the computers. So another beautiful work from RJ on foundation, part of the computer art collection. So RJ continues to do well. And here was also a series he put out, the metamorphosis GPT, where I believe he got chat GPT to rewrite the metamorphosis from a crypto investor standpoint. We'll look at that in a second. So these are available for. .1.
00:19:11.744 - 00:19:45.850, Speaker A: And this is probably the one that sold, which is now 0.3. So, interesting concept, nice series. And he was working, like, if you go to his Tezos page, he was also working with the metamorphosis in an earlier series. So it's kind of interesting how he's returning to that. And here's the clue. The metamorphosis GPT is retelling of Kafka's 1915 text, metamorphosis, written by chat GPT. In it, a successful anonymous cryptocurrency trader awakens to find himself turning into vermin.
00:19:45.850 - 00:20:09.178, Speaker A: Not into vermin, but a computer. So there you go. A rehash, a restyling, a remixing of the metamorphosis, courtesy of RJ. So again, the depth of. Of this scene continues to be shown, and the oddity of this scene continues to be shown. Audie and misses Oddie are wishing us all a happy Valentine's Day. So a very.
00:20:09.178 - 00:20:31.364, Speaker A: Another odd work from the oddest guy, the oddest painter, Antezos. But I love his paintings. Audie and misses Oddie. I've collected, like, 80%, probably, of Audie's work on tazos here. So some interesting clouds and everything. And that, you know, 18th century, 17th century color there. So hilarious as always.
00:20:31.364 - 00:21:02.116, Speaker A: And continuing on, graphica png. So we were looking at Graphica's work the other day, and I believe it was AI painting and maybe collage to make these incredibly strange, boldly strange works. And here we go again, which is, I love these works. Like, I just find them visually interesting. I feel, again, it feels like new ground is being covered. And that's what I was mentioning, to go go Litis. Like, I mean, that's the beauty of having conversations.
00:21:02.116 - 00:21:37.106, Speaker A: These things come out. I kind of feel with gogolitis there, that new ground is being broken with over here in color. Like, I don't know any work that's really done this. Because as we were mentioning in the Twitter, as he was saying in the Twitter spaces, or I was observing and he was agreeing, he's combining his gradients that move across here with his other work. And again, from a color point of view, I don't know anything that's quite like this. So, anyways, back to where we were. So interesting work from Graphica PNG.
00:21:37.106 - 00:22:03.246, Speaker A: And here's an artist we haven't looked at before, rinny fish. This is available for one tezos, and this is an edition of 100 for Tezquake aid called Bugs. And here it is, just kind of an unusual work. It looks like a broken egg, and not sure what the other thing is. Just kind of classic Internet. A really cool video here. Bunny bug from my current solo exhibition.
00:22:03.246 - 00:22:39.798, Speaker A: I picked this bug to help the regions in Turkey and Syria affected by the earthquake. 100% of sales will be sent to help. So you can buy that now for $1.16. Or one Tezos and Santiago with a preview of a work in progress of his next super rare piece. So another clue into Santiago's process here. And it's looking wonderful. And I love how just, you know, to me, it's a very simple concept, which is putting, you know, this, what I call digitalia, this digital stuff from all sorts of parts of the Internet, let's say.
00:22:39.798 - 00:23:15.312, Speaker A: And then putting it together, these different renditions, and making basically a kind of digital abstraction out of it. I mean, that's what it seems like to me. And you see these beautiful pixel things contrasting with these other SVG type vector like shapes. So very cool and just massive. And I love how he lets it breathe, too, with these big borders and a slightly more orange background here, seemingly. So having a lot of fun again. These, I feel, could hang in the same room, too.
00:23:15.312 - 00:23:46.740, Speaker A: I mean, this kind of has an abstract quality to it, too. Rustic digital art with another work for Tez, quake aid altogether in memory of those who lost their lives and those who lost it all during the earthquakes in Turkey and Syria. So, yeah, so there it is by rustic digital art, available, I think, for one tezos. Pretty moving work, actually. Yeah, buy for one Tezos edition of 100. And continuing on, Daniel W. With a new work, set your body ablaze.
00:23:46.740 - 00:24:09.216, Speaker A: And this seems to be based on, I think, or at least kind of referencing probably a famous monk who set himself on fire. I was just seeing it on Instagram. Someone was posting this work. And so that's what it makes me think of. So, anyways, a nice work here. Somewhat dark. Set your body ablaze by Daniel W.
00:24:09.216 - 00:24:19.216, Speaker A: Big shout out. Thank you for the shout out yourself. Dan W. On Twitter. Five Tazos edition of 36. Very beautiful work. Another one by Muji.
00:24:19.216 - 00:24:50.908, Speaker A: So again, we're looking. He's using deluxe paint, which is a retro tool or a vintage software on the Amiga. And again, putting his spin on kind of a darker, abstract handling of deluxe paint on the Amiga. So really nice work here. Buy for. For tazos. Have you ever imagined the possibility of your city being a giant hardware and you're just a malfunctioning component? No, I have not.
00:24:50.908 - 00:25:07.512, Speaker A: And called system city. So anyways, cool work from Meja. I love this work. I love, love, love this work by Haiti rocket slam dunk. I was tempted to start with this. I mean, it was a tough, you know, like, this is beautiful. It is absolutely beautiful.
00:25:07.512 - 00:25:26.166, Speaker A: It's still available for 14.85 tezos edition of 20. So it's not a huge addition. I love it. Again, I'm thinking entrances to museums here. It just speaks to the spirit of this whole digital art space. Slam dunk or die.
00:25:26.166 - 00:25:56.850, Speaker A: So big shout out to Haiti, who was awesomely in the Twitter spaces yesterday. That was great. And also, so Tom Bombatl, who Gogolitis was shouting out, is one of the pixel artists he's really liking right now. Campfire. So a new one in the nostalgic colors or in the spectrum collection. And again, this really four x four dithering here and looking at a campfire, a robot and the guy with the skull and a little meteor in the air. So beautiful work.
00:25:56.850 - 00:26:10.074, Speaker A: Available for 850 on secondary. Only one left. And this sold for six on primary one to go. Go lightest. There you go. So that is great. And look, I think this may be b.
00:26:10.074 - 00:26:27.900, Speaker A: So that is probably Tom Bombadil's signature here because we've seen it on other works too. A new one this time on Solana. We love being multi chain here by Manitoula. And who did the cat tarot? Let's see if there's music. There is no music here. So interesting. It's on headphones.
00:26:27.900 - 00:26:44.860, Speaker A: So there you go. Just super charming. Pixel. Cat art or cat pixel art brings back memories of my cassette tape. Music listening days. Utilizing a cassette player is a memory machine. I'm reminded of older music.
00:26:44.860 - 00:27:05.472, Speaker A: That's so true. My first album was probably Huey Lewis in the news in grade one. I think I got a Sony Walkman with headphones just like that. Mine was probably a black color. And yeah, those would last about a year before they would start to break. I loved my Walkman. 24 hours auction.
00:27:05.472 - 00:27:19.476, Speaker A: Current bid, 1.8, Saul. And this is a one of one. So a pretty good deal. So Saul again, Saul is not dead. Continuing on Mech TXT. Back from vacation or something he did on vacation.
00:27:19.476 - 00:27:42.350, Speaker A: Weight of love. And this is one of his kind of classical referenced works, or classical looking works, or maybe neoclassical. This almost looks like an 18th century portrait done with his trademark pixel art style. That is so beautiful. And this is an edition of 20. And that maybe taking offers. And there's gogolitis.
00:27:42.350 - 00:27:59.950, Speaker A: Go. Go. Litus is liking what he's seen and it's great again just to see him back. So offers are being taken. If you want to know how to get it, go to mech TXT's Twitter and I'm sure you can get the info. Here's another interesting work. Pixel's dance in the darkness by Denso.
00:27:59.950 - 00:28:28.076, Speaker A: It's an edition of 20, and there are eight more left on primary. This has a bit more of a light bright sort of feel to it. And someone, it looks like in the snow with an umbrella in a city. So just kind of interesting work here. And continuing on, a work by popple. Now, this is an open edition as well. 42 have been minted at two tezos, sateliten, Stadt.
00:28:28.076 - 00:28:47.918, Speaker A: So maybe a little bit of German. So Stadt in English, this is probably german. And in English it means city. So satellite state, I think we could call that as a title. I don't. There's probably no space for a signature in here, unless it's hidden in the pixels here. So, interesting work.
00:28:47.918 - 00:29:22.968, Speaker A: Almost looks like a mayan pyramid or something, with a sun pixelated sun of some kind. So a mysterious work. Looks like a new series from popple 42 minted two tezos, or $2.32 if you want to use visa. Gabby. So, I don't know if I followed Gabby before, but one of these pixel artists you see on the Twitter, which don't necessarily meant their work, they just post their pixel art, as far as I know. And this, at first, when I looked at it, it kind of looked like old computers, but now it looks like buildings.
00:29:22.968 - 00:29:43.022, Speaker A: I thought these were old laptops. So a very interesting angle. It reminds me of almost medieval perspective here. Kind of like video game, certain kind of perspective you might see in some video games. Very interesting work. Is there any? They've seen better days. So, interesting comment there.
00:29:43.022 - 00:30:06.450, Speaker A: And I guess he's referring to the buildings, which are slightly broken down here. You can see the roofs need repaired. So interesting. Very interesting by Gabby. Continuing on, Armilk 88. Excuse me, tired pixels. And how many things have you seen? How many things have you seen this water? It's better to forget it.
00:30:06.450 - 00:30:25.094, Speaker A: So this is for 750, probably on secondary here. A nice, beautiful. I love the animation. How simple. It is. It is just the water passing, this kind of, you know, beautiful city. And I also love how it's not white in the background, but this more muted gray, beige gray edition of 15.
00:30:25.094 - 00:30:52.644, Speaker A: And, yeah, so this sold out on primary for five, so now you can buy it for $7.50 a little bit more. A beautiful work by plants. A new one, I believe. And this is also an open edition, so I'm not sure if there's incentive here to do open editions or if people are just having fun. Four have been minted at 222 22 tazo cents. I thought a beautiful work.
00:30:52.644 - 00:31:15.228, Speaker A: I love the frame. And this is part of Kappan's Plants series, or under his plants moniker. So I really like what I've been seeing from that plant series recently. That last one was beautiful, too, that I think we just looked at. And here's another flower gift studies. And this is teletext. And remember teletext.
00:31:15.228 - 00:31:46.184, Speaker A: And with teletext, you always get this, I guess you can't see it here, but you always get this black stripe, I guess, on the left hand side. And this is basically, as far as I understand, a form of technology that could be transmitted through tv receivers, as far as I understand. So buy for a Tezos edition of 20 spring. And it feels like spring actually out here. I hope it does where you are as well. And more spring themed works. And this is Lorna Mills Universal gladiola.
00:31:46.184 - 00:32:16.062, Speaker A: And so kind of a variation on actually her other pixelated masks here. I haven't seen her where she starts to release or where parts of the mask you don't see through. So this is interesting. And also using a smaller pixel. So development there, from what I can tell from Lorna Mills Universal gladiola buy for 50 edition of 25. So not cheap. And there's one left.
00:32:16.062 - 00:32:37.014, Speaker A: I wonder if this is an older work. It is. It's from July, so I must. She must have listed this and I saw it. Anyways, cool work. Happy to show that sad girl with a new kind of glitchy anime anima manga sort of work, anime sort of feeling work here. This is by for 404.
00:32:37.014 - 00:33:01.532, Speaker A: So I guess this is only on secondary. Let's just see what it went. What happened here? Yeah, so it sold for four tezos $0.44 on primary. And that was in the last couple of days, edition of 14. So now someone wants 100 x on their return here. And hey, if you are, you know, choosing right, you never know.
00:33:01.532 - 00:33:27.444, Speaker A: But of course, not financial advice at all. Here we are, here for the art here is Elie Lo a new one? Interesting one. Always beautiful. Music from Ellie Lowe, trash artist. And there's the main character. So that was it. That was it.
00:33:27.444 - 00:33:55.736, Speaker A: Buy for ten on secondary. So this sold out. Almost feels kind of post apocalyptic here. Trash garbage number 47. And a new one from John Valentine's clearance. So almost all those Valentine's Day cards he made yesterday are going out the window and the skeleton is sending them off. So there they are in a beautiful kind of infinite loop here.
00:33:55.736 - 00:34:21.590, Speaker A: And I love that studio too, this grid studio and how it's just not like purely, you know, across. You see how it's kind of like, you know, slightly diagonal. So all sorts of subtleties here as we kind of discover John's work here. Edition of 25, Bion secondary for 125. He has a ton of collectors. And let me just load this up here. I'm not Satoshi.
00:34:21.590 - 00:34:47.244, Speaker A: So this is by who we were looking at the. This is by stww ts. So I think I saw, came across them on Twitter. Kind of a video game. Video game feeling. It's pretty interesting and cool and it looks great. Fascinating reserve of two ETH.
00:34:47.244 - 00:35:05.288, Speaker A: Already an offer for 1.21 ETH. So very cool work. I'm not Satoshi, and there is an explanation here in the description. So always looking for the new here. And nativad with another work. Anon was here.
00:35:05.288 - 00:35:40.034, Speaker A: So portrait of Anon, the famous Anon from Twitter, is appearing here with a drop of blood coming from his digital eyes, or her digital eyes and some code in the background. So interesting portrait here. Kind of part of this web3 aesthetic where he's kind of where native Ed is commenting on the scene here. So cool work by native Ed. Kurt hussle collective. Let's just load this guy up with one of these. He's been doing these comment works and you'll see here what I'm talking about.
00:35:40.034 - 00:36:00.388, Speaker A: Oh, shit, hold on, dude, I'm hacking a hologram. Oh, shit. Hold on, dude, I'm hacking a hologram. So another mysterious work. As I say, I would never be able to predict their next move from the Kurt Hussle collective. KHC buy for five, edition of 100. And this is going to tezquake aid as well.
00:36:00.388 - 00:36:22.594, Speaker A: Hacking holograms featuring Rick Dre. So very cool as usual. And a couple of works by Eizo. So this one, I don't think we saw a future couch. And you've probably again seen the entire series here. That's a great couch. Again, that space age, seventies sort of look and feel.
00:36:22.594 - 00:36:38.918, Speaker A: I love the furniture choice. It's great. And let's see this one. Future chair, nine. Nice big comfortable chair. And looking beautiful as ever here from eight. So this is an edition of one available for 150.
00:36:38.918 - 00:36:51.754, Speaker A: And the other was an edition of one. And this probably sold for 150. So well done there. And Elbie, another great glitch artist. Call for help. So this is also for Tezquake aid. And I love this piece, actually.
00:36:51.754 - 00:37:17.994, Speaker A: A guy with a trumpet. I wonder where it's from. I mean, it's tempting to think like clockwork orange or something, but I'm not a huge movie guy, so I have no idea where it's from. Again, using physical machinery here, ederal V four and Panasonic mixers recorded with capture card. Also for Tezquake Aid. And another one by LB called Poison. Abstract work edition of ten, available for five.
00:37:17.994 - 00:37:31.812, Speaker A: So tons of glitch video. Glitch art coming out here. Better not touch. And here's another one. I won't leave this too long because it's actually pretty. It's pretty intense. But another one from Doctor version here.
00:37:31.812 - 00:37:49.466, Speaker A: Optics, zero, zero, one. And then we'll stop this. But anyways, that is also for Tezquake Aid. And a cool work, a very cool work from Doctor version there. And here is another glitch work. And this is by McHX, who does the kind of. This color field.
00:37:49.466 - 00:38:15.324, Speaker A: Works in the style of Rothko a little bit, but digital. And this is, I think, combined with maybe Curo, I think. So I think there's a collaboration going on here with McHX. Here is the work. So again, more kind of glitched out video here. And we have another one from xmortal pure seven. And let's just make that a little bigger.
00:38:15.324 - 00:38:42.594, Speaker A: And, yeah, kind of abstract glitch art here. Video captured in real time on two point on February 14, 2023. Hardware, video, synths and glitchgear. So here's another one. And this is pretty interesting write up amplitude, some nice eighties vhs footage of a flowing river in the Grand Canyon. Completely destroyed, processed with hardware glitch tools. So looks like, you know, this isn't a digital tool.
00:38:42.594 - 00:39:07.042, Speaker A: This is a probably a real VHS glitch recorded. So pretty cool. Cato with some abstraction here. Tour de France, 2100, buy for 350. So more attractive abstraction here from Cato. So an interesting discovery here recently. And also Tuks.
00:39:07.042 - 00:39:39.004, Speaker A: And I think we started the show on Tuesday with Tuks. So he is doing a pre sale, or Tuks is doing a presale. It will be exclusive for current holders. If you hold any of my nfts released on foundation, you will build a mint on the 26 February. If you don't own a piece yet, go buy one right now. There are seven pieces listed in the secondary right now, so here it is. And it kind of feels like those collections that people are making, like I think acidboy made one and someone else, I think Marina Omidova made a collection, if I'm not mistaken.
00:39:39.004 - 00:40:05.734, Speaker A: And so here's another one. And I think this is going to be on foundation. So if you want to buy one, it sounds like you need to buy a previous work by tux and a couple of works by Rossettio who is animating these kind of collage sketches that Rossettio has been working on. So that is interesting. So it continues to evolve. And this is called double and the other one is called trouble. So they go together.
00:40:05.734 - 00:40:25.614, Speaker A: And here you can see the mask is basically being animated. All sorts of things are being animated. So interesting experimentation. And for both, I think it's accepting top eight and one random offer. Minimum offer. Suggested minimum offer is 13 tez and that'll happen on February 17. And I think it's the same info on double as well.
00:40:25.614 - 00:41:04.750, Speaker A: Shout out to rosatio Zala. So I just wanted to say we were looking at this artist at least like a couple of months ago. And anyway, digital expressionism was Zala's pure digital work and Zala had sold some physical work as nfts and this was a purely digital series from what I remember. Anyways, it has sold out and I thought it was just a matter of time because they're incredibly attractive works. So congrats to Zala on that. And here is a work by Sumi Ryusi. So this is from her combining her digital painting and AI.
00:41:04.750 - 00:41:34.690, Speaker A: I would not have been born if I knew the state killed us while we were alive. Digital art and collage from Sumi. This is an edition of 25 for five tezos. So a bit of a dark theme here. And you have a crab attacking the cheesecake here with probably AI in the background here in the image. Kind of a trademark move by Sumi Ryusi, a couple from Danielle King, long distance love. And this is collaborated with Fort Gallery NFt.
00:41:34.690 - 00:42:03.410, Speaker A: An imagined collaboration between Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso for Valentine's Day, made with mid journey. So interesting work here. I love the outlines and everything. And here's another one. This is Matisse and Wes Anderson made using mid journey, also with Fort gallery NFT for Valentine's Day. That almost looks like that should be Matisse as the person. Maybe Wes Anderson doing a movie of Matisse.
00:42:03.410 - 00:42:38.940, Speaker A: Not sure. Anyways, continuing on, just found this on Twitter. Chikai san maze mid journey AI art. And I thought it was just a nice render here. This looks like raw AI and just kind of a nice, interesting interior courtesy of AI from Chikai san. I don't think Chikai san is on NFT, not available now, but will open soon. So again, there are many artists who are just on Twitter who don't mint at all, which is interesting in and of itself, isn't it? Here is an artist that mints, although I'm not sure this one is minted.
00:42:38.940 - 00:43:09.374, Speaker A: This is John O'k AI art and other surreal stories. I thought this was an interesting AI piece here, quite painterly. And I'm pretty sure this is AI. I brought up some of John OK's other work, the sun foundation. Looks like Pablo Puncaso and Clownvamp have an unknown collector have collected. So yeah, so as you can see here, they are collecting. So John OK is popular, interesting AI, isn't it? So just coming across that for the first time.
00:43:09.374 - 00:43:52.474, Speaker A: And what else do we have here? Well, one of our favorite people in the space, true face. So true face, as far as I understand, and actually we'll see it here in the bio is a AI kind of programmer person who became artist. Seeing the possibilities of AI. Let's just let them explain for themselves. University professor and latin american digital artist, pioneer in artificial intelligence techniques since 2017, experimenting with his own AI models. So cool, right? Remember the last judgment that we saw like six weeks ago? Well, this is the same artist. Everything is everywhere and anything is everything.
00:43:52.474 - 00:44:18.938, Speaker A: Method AI personal data set and training model digital post production poem made by AI text generator the only mystery of the universe is that there is a mystery of the universe. Whatever that mystery is, who can say? I can't. You can't. And we aren't supposed to know. I think I almost like AI poetry better than human poetry to be controversial. True face 2023. So very cool.
00:44:18.938 - 00:44:56.578, Speaker A: Very, very cool from true face. And I'm trying to think if there's a reference here. But anyways, you can see, I mean, just finally here, like, these shapes don't look like other AI generators, right? So when you're making your own AI generators, that's what happens. So anyways, always interesting to keep tabs on true face. And here's Ilay, the wonderful eyelay with a piece called grace. A beautiful work of a, you know, a beam of rainbow coming from the sky. Looks like a raw AI work here with a nice little fleck of paint here.
00:44:56.578 - 00:45:28.212, Speaker A: And just a beautiful work from Ilay. This is an addition of 20 for two tazos. And let's see, there are eight left, so get it while you can. It reminds me of Crete, and I was staying right about here, if you've ever been to the north side of Crete. And a beautiful work here from poly jojo that Atlas Pop is highlighting here, considered to be one of the most accurate and versatile controllers of the 19th century. And so a 19th century version of. I guess that's an Xbox controller, I'm guessing.
00:45:28.212 - 00:45:48.884, Speaker A: And another beautiful still life by Pauly Jojo here. So again, big shout out. Thanks for the bid earlier. And the work is looking beautiful. Remember cannabinocay, a beautiful still life. So here's another one I want to highlight here. And strange thing, this is on Instagram where strange thing is killing it.
00:45:48.884 - 00:46:23.376, Speaker A: And here you can see very quickly so many works that strange thing has been working on, again, doing the AI inspired renaissance fashion. So check him out on Instagram. And here's another work by this artist I can't get enough of who's painting on the rugs. I'm pretty sure that's what's going on here. Acrylic tints on sobra Tapesaria. So I think that's a carpet. So anyways, a physical work here as we wrap up.
00:46:23.376 - 00:46:41.812, Speaker A: And another work by Mark Belden. Again, I love the colors and everything this artist is doing right here, the beautiful paper. Everything is just so beautiful about what this artist is doing. So I'm just thrilled to show a new work. Peale 2022 gouache on St. Armand. Paper.
00:46:41.812 - 00:47:13.322, Speaker A: Worth looking up. If you're into paper, as a lot of us, as all artists should be, you should be looking at paper. And another work by walking, you know, again, just showing his skill, pure skill in spray painting here. I mean, that is really impressive on colored paper, which is another fun thing. We're talking about popple's work. And popple, if you ever made those prints of the bio, I can't remember the name of the series, but those by that bio Sci-Fi series. Yeah.
00:47:13.322 - 00:47:23.954, Speaker A: Show us the prints. If you've ever even the tests, I'd love to see that. And that is your show, everyone, as rare says, I like to wrap this up quickly. Thank you for watching. Until next time, take care.
