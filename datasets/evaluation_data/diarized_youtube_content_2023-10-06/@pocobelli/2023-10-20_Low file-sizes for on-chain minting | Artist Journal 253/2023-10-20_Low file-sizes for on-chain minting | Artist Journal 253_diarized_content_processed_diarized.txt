00:00:02.240 - 00:00:27.340, Speaker A: It continues. My friends, thank you, thank you. And thank you again for all the huge support there, especially on Twitter yesterday. I am in the countryside a little bit in the north of Rome here, and we're doing it again under huge time constraints. I have just been informed I have to be on my way to a beautiful lunch here in 30 minutes. So that is exciting. Artist journal, October 20, 2023.
00:00:27.340 - 00:00:41.388, Speaker A: In a beautiful 28 degrees celsius. Weather here on its way. Maybe it's 24 right now. The morning is here. It's a beautiful summer day here in Rome. The weather is just awesome. So welcome back, everyone.
00:00:41.388 - 00:01:12.832, Speaker A: My name is Adrian Pokebelli, and again, thank you for all the support. And let's see if we can run through this. It should be a shorter show next week. I go to Sicily, and it should be easier in the sense that I won't be visiting relatives, and it'll just be a simpler setup where the focus will be more on. It'll just be easier. So kind of back to kind of regular programming, so to speak. Monday's a big bit of a question, though, because I fly, so we'll see if we can do something on Monday.
00:01:12.832 - 00:01:34.902, Speaker A: But anyways, again, huge thank you to everybody here. And as you can see, just a beautiful backdrop here. So big shout out to the fam out here in Rome. So let us go. And here it is, Stalamere. This kind of had the wow factor just on a. Just on an immediate kind of, as I like to say, the reptilian side of things.
00:01:34.902 - 00:01:54.436, Speaker A: Just the color kind of sparkled and just kind of jumped out at me. And then you see this beautiful, very original work here by, again, Stalamere. Great pixel artist. Great pixel artist and interesting use. I mean, just kind of quick observations here. Very like. I mean, you see how original it is kind of.
00:01:54.436 - 00:02:31.584, Speaker A: You know what I remember of Stalamere? It's kind of like Sci-Fi pixel art. And, of course, this is on foundation, hence the white background here. Let me see if I can minimize it here. And it is on foundation. And, of course, we remember a lot of the pixel art that is on object from Stalomere. So this is part of this triptych here where we saw paleolithic, mesolithic, and now neolithic has finally come out. And so humans are getting more civilized, so to speak, here in this kind of speculative pixel artwork.
00:02:31.584 - 00:03:00.410, Speaker A: Again, it does have that kind of Sci-Fi feel, even though it is kind of going back in time here. And you see the beautiful water and the rainbow and the wheat. As you know, that's the work when we have more time, when we see another stalamere work, I'll go back into some of the earlier works and some of them I remember finding a Haiti rocket collection actually this great wheat work. I wonder what that's going for. We'll have to see. And something I forgot yesterday. Big shout out and thank you.
00:03:00.410 - 00:03:32.496, Speaker A: Still kind of catching up in these shows. Big shout and thank you to ahack for picking this up for 150 tezos. So again, part of the promoted story series. I'm kind of going multi chain with that and I may do some kind of simple remixes for bitcoin ordinals. Even might try to pull a spuegel's maskinen and try and do just like, you know, one bit works, or I guess you'd call them one bit works on maybe even ETH on chain. I think that's fascinating. Again, trying to get these works as low as do remixes as low as possible.
00:03:32.496 - 00:03:50.834, Speaker A: We're going to see Mandal and big shout out to Haiti Rockette for picking this up. Intermittent fasting. Another promoted story. A theme I keep coming back to. This is part of the pixel art sketchbook. So thanks for that for 20 tazos. Thank you comments here and let me just make this larger.
00:03:50.834 - 00:04:17.302, Speaker A: So on yesterday's show, awesome as always. And I think this is. Let me just quickly look. Yes, this is yesterday's show, the Doodle style. Thank you rada for the comment and skomra, great show. I loved seeing the in depth discussion on the sometimes elusive waffle tokens. I missed out on sim exit hacks and seen it here.
00:04:17.302 - 00:04:38.074, Speaker A: Again, I really missed out. Yeah, it was definitely a low key. It's hard to track, I think purposefully. Hasdrubal is always kind of hard to find the works. I thought Sim Hacks was a reference to simswap attacks, and that sounds totally right to me. So which are becoming more common in crypto? Definitely. That makes total sense.
00:04:38.074 - 00:05:00.830, Speaker A: But I like the idea of the sims, but I have a feeling you're onto something there. Skomra, many thanks for showing my what's now known as Yellow Castle. So it has a title and I believe Skomra is saying he's going to put that out on ETH. Chimasuku Jackson thanks for the support here. We should all be giving more likes per views. Let's improve the algorithm. You know, I've looked at other shows that are kind of in the NFT crypto space.
00:05:00.830 - 00:05:28.472, Speaker A: This one does fabulously for likes per kind of view, so thank you for that. And it's all because of people like Chimascu here putting that like in. So appreciate that. So yeri, great to hear from you. Katy dirt, you said kids programs for creating referring to hasdrubal waffle using kids software. There's an awesome Twitter space. Proudly did about six months ago, probably now five six months ago with hasdrubal waffle.
00:05:28.472 - 00:06:01.416, Speaker A: And we go in depth and I'm not sure I think even he might even mention some some of the softwares that has dribble uses. Usually they're these kind of JavaScript programs and tabs in chrome or whatever the browser that hizdribble's using. So I would recommend going back to that. There should be a link in the show notes here to the Spotify to the podcast. Look for the Hasdrubal waffle one and you'll get more info on the kids programs. We've been following it for a while. There are a few.
00:06:01.416 - 00:06:22.372, Speaker A: I can't remember them off the top of my head. And big shout out again to Rada. So great to hear from RADA. And just quickly on previous I missed actually the comments from the previous show. Mech's work is amazing. I'm a huge fan. This is glyph art, a huge fan of the old Ultima and still play old DOS games.
00:06:22.372 - 00:06:56.160, Speaker A: It was great seeing the comparison. Vintage computing and retro consoles are my frame of reference for my work as well. Great show. I have to say on just a almost I'm kind of back to that reptilian level. Mech's work is probably I haven't started with it yet, but it's probably what I personally am most excited about right now. When I see a new thing by mech, I'm just excited like more than any tabloid, this tabloid of the imagination, so to speak here. It's just waiting for its headline from Mech TXT.
00:06:56.160 - 00:07:10.808, Speaker A: They're just bubbling up here. Anyways, I feel the same way. And thank you once again to rad. I can put some offers out there. Congrats for and mortis spiral. Congrats for the minting fam. I appreciate all these comments, the repeated comments.
00:07:10.808 - 00:07:22.216, Speaker A: I totally, totally appreciate it. It does help. Amazing show. Score. One more thing. Congratulations for object one curation. So yeah, let's I think.
00:07:22.216 - 00:07:35.432, Speaker A: I don't think we've looked at yes, thank you. Score. Celery AI complicated week. Thanks for this, indeed. There's gonna be a great dinner. I have to run through this amazing episode. Thank you cider and Hugo, thanks for highlighting my work.
00:07:35.432 - 00:07:53.214, Speaker A: Oh, that's Hugo. Okay, awesome. So Hugo is Hugo here? Awesome. Smoke work to cigarette work from yesterday. Marcel a new digital chaos works. Another genre definition add to my dictionary. Anyways, thanks everybody, and thanks for all the comments here as well.
00:07:53.214 - 00:08:39.860, Speaker A: Actually, I did want to thank you to everybody who commented I can't go through everything just because of time constraints today. But little cakes Heejo Kaiden is a reference to the japanese noise band, I believe, referring to hasdrubal or authentic waffles because I was wondering where that title came from. That makes a ton of sense, doesn't it? Struble is definitely on the counterculture. Kind of knows what he's doing in the counterculture front, so for that to be a japanese noise artist or reference would not shock me at all. And I'm not shocked that cakes is the person who figured that out. And also googleitis here and thank you everybody and toques and everything. Gogolite is just talking about tagging and I'm kind of trying to work on that.
00:08:39.860 - 00:08:57.772, Speaker A: It may be a premium sort of thing, I'm thinking, because it does take a little bit of extra time. Maybe someone gets paid for that. Maybe I do it if I figure out a good solution. It was. It's a great thing. Ilay dedicated a huge amount of time. Give ilay a follow and doing that before and yeah.
00:08:57.772 - 00:09:21.474, Speaker A: So anyways, big shout out and thank you to everybody for the comments. Paul who is a ghost. Here's my secret. I buy what I love when I find an artist I love. I buy multiple pieces, sometimes multiple edition over time. That adds up. Two years after coming to tezos, being consistent and witnessing artists journeys, I'm left with two and a half thousand nfts more than nationale galerie at 1800, by the way, and I'm top holder on a lot of artists collections.
00:09:21.474 - 00:10:04.342, Speaker A: So this was just a really nice comment or post here and just pointing out, and I'll let you guys read that here. I can't read everything. I probably shouldn't have brought this up from time constraints. Anyways, just, you know, a shout out to the collectors out there like Paul, who is a ghost. Give them a follow. And here, Pamela Cerrone, who probably wins the most prolific artist of the month here, coming off of a exhibition, now doing works on shirts, putting out what seems like multiple editions per day. You just gotta love it and that's how you do it.
00:10:04.342 - 00:10:31.494, Speaker A: And I follow Pamelo, that is a Twitter bug. Rosatio from 2017. It's about 17 meters wide or 56ft. Biggest work to date. There's something to be said for working big. It's like in egyptian art, you call it significance, perspective, where the pharaoh is often huge and the regular people are smaller. There's something we read meaning into scale.
00:10:31.494 - 00:10:51.894, Speaker A: Size does matter in the arts, in your physical art world, for physical art. So it's cool. Figure out how to make something huge. If you're an artist, there's something to be said for that. Again, I think of Warhol's Mao. That was just like. It's probably the biggest artwork I've ever seen into the art.
00:10:51.894 - 00:11:18.730, Speaker A: We go here in the remaining 1520 minutes here. NUV 1914. Equi. So just a more interesting, edgy experiment, what I'd call experimental work here from NUV 1914. Working with the gradients, looks like a couple of figures dancing here in these kind of beautiful, simple gradients here. Maybe not so simple. And then maybe a tree juxtaposed eight tazos edition of four.
00:11:18.730 - 00:11:38.084, Speaker A: Nice low edition there. And I picked this up. Torta de Fertuas y Flores. I think Nuve 1914 has about four or, sorry, three of these cake works that I remember. I'm trying to collect them. So I picked this up, and I also picked up another one that was older that I quite loved. Peepee universal had this.
00:11:38.084 - 00:11:53.004, Speaker A: I picked this up also. I just think it's beautiful. And I'm kind of a. Food is a fun topic. There's an artist whose name escapes me right now. She did a ton of cakes, and she still does them once in a while on tezos. We'll bring up her work again at some point.
00:11:53.004 - 00:12:08.784, Speaker A: She is a great artist. And I just see these guys hanging in the same room. So that's why I picked this up. De fertilis. This is an older one from August edition of two. And a new pepe pastiche from RJ. This is another one of one.
00:12:08.784 - 00:12:34.650, Speaker A: And again, we recognize this from the Whistler arrangement in green and black. Very famous painting. You know what my favorite part of this painting is? I thought this was actually quite brilliant, actually. The grey Pepe here. Interesting move to probably compliment, but my favorite part here reminds me of kind of. This is the fun of tracing to a certain degree here. It's this.
00:12:34.650 - 00:13:01.538, Speaker A: This drapery here. There's something to be said for just doing kind of. I consider this, like, raw tracing, and I'm. It reminds me of sometimes when I'm working and tracing and not worrying about how it turns out, you often end up with kind of what I'd consider really beautiful results like this in the drapes. And just tracing and not really worrying what happens. And then you remove the underlying layer and you get something gorgeous like this. So really nice piece here.
00:13:01.538 - 00:13:31.114, Speaker A: One of 1420 tezos from RJ, who continues to dazzle here. And we'll see if Santiago loads up here another massive 15,000 pixel works. So if you're wondering why this is slow, this may not load up again, unfortunately, but we have a couple of more from Santiago here. This is gorgeous. Kind of nice. This would work really well as some kind of print. I'm not sure if screen print is the best way or another way.
00:13:31.114 - 00:13:59.774, Speaker A: Look how gorgeous this is. You could screen print it. Probably other interesting, like almost, I want to say lithography, maybe this kind of mon. That's the cool thing I would say about working with very limited palette is they become easier to render physically. And beautiful color here too. Kind of understated work here. Edition of 521 tezos on secondary.
00:13:59.774 - 00:14:14.548, Speaker A: This is how I feel. Another awesome title, Santiago. Always with the awesome titles. And a minimal work here before and after time. The heartwarming story of socks dried in an oven. So it seems like AI title here. Using inkscape, which I've never tried at auction.
00:14:14.548 - 00:14:30.342, Speaker A: A one of one at 60 tezos. Again, a bold, edgy kind of minimal work here. Nice cream background. Keeping the experimentation going. Let's see if we can open this previous work here. See if it opens. Here it is.
00:14:30.342 - 00:14:48.182, Speaker A: Okay, awesome. So this is the 15,000 pixel work and a large title here. And here it is. Edition of 15. So continuing to experiment here from Santiago. Very, very cool series places and sites. Very cool.
00:14:48.182 - 00:15:15.844, Speaker A: Let me actually shut that down. Mech txt so it continues here. The excitement continues with Mech TXT's work. And it almost looks like a fire or something. At first I thought these were almost like a lighthouse, and I'm not sure what the reference is here. But again, for those ultima four followers, as we were seeing in that YouTube comment, you can see kind of similar tiling here. Again, it's kind of the most exciting thing.
00:15:15.844 - 00:15:36.534, Speaker A: It's what I'm most excited about right now. I haven't even seen any minted yet. Mech TxT also, just checking the time here. Time management, 15 minutes to go here. Some small progress. And the Mac battery is going down. So check this out before my battery dies here.
00:15:36.534 - 00:15:53.414, Speaker A: The battery may die before. Actually. Look at this. So, lunch break well spent. So look at. I may have to run through this for five minutes here or for just five minutes to go here. I'm using a simper.
00:15:53.414 - 00:16:13.950, Speaker A: So using a script here. So how interesting is that? So check out mech TXT's file page for more on that. DB Cooper eight tazos new artist just tagged me and it nihon nostalgia. So edition of ten. Eight tazos. Kind of cool pixel art here. Muji with a new one, electric purple.
00:16:13.950 - 00:16:43.694, Speaker A: Doesn't this look like almost reminds me of the green version. Shall we very quickly look, probably don't even have the power for okay, so slightly different. Okay, but similar. So going in the same series, already sold out there. I think at 29 tezos, you might recognize this artist element Li with some beautiful experimental pixel art done on a phone, I think. Wow, that would be amazing if this one was done on a phone too. Very nice work from element Ly.
00:16:43.694 - 00:17:24.860, Speaker A: Just an awesome pixel artist. Sergeant Slaughtermellon, if you can hear that. So again, playing with Windows kind of XP Windows 95 vibe and just everything, and then turning it into art. Do you want to feel something? Often replacing see feelings in here, replacing the words in the windows there. I thought this was pretty interesting soccer game. Who is the artist? Unfortunately, I just have an anonymous wallet. I saw it on, on Twitter and I thought, just kind of fun doing these sports in kind of a pixel art video game fashion.
00:17:24.860 - 00:17:43.352, Speaker A: Just really interesting. Look at Mandal here putting works on Zora. I feel like we recognize. I recognize some of these works doing the one pixel version for Zora and they're selling really nicely. 361 for some of these free mints here. And I brought some of them up here. I love this idea.
00:17:43.352 - 00:18:07.244, Speaker A: And I'm also thinking ordnance. Mandal, I'm thinking ordinals because they kind of need art on ordinals, on bitcoin, and that could be an untapped opportunity. Turkarak gloomy. Kind of looks like a woodcut, doesn't it? And you gotta love these domestic scenes. Black and white, basically, or cream looks like a woodcut. It's beautiful. Continuing Daniel W.
00:18:07.244 - 00:18:30.884, Speaker A: Corporate dungeon Zero three salaryman coming out of the elevator here. Just really cool work. I'm going to have to run through this before the battery dies, guys. Jake Studios. So another surreal illustration from Jake Studios. Very cool, cool work from Kurt Hussle collective, 1993 to 2004. Kobayashi Yamato.
00:18:30.884 - 00:19:04.954, Speaker A: So not sure what the reference is here, but you can check it out here on KHC's page. And there's also another work here. Cheeks. This is a five minute video, so unfortunately we can't go through all this, but check it out on Kurt Hussle's page. Mika Alidaf with a beautiful glitch still, you know, glitch stills don't always work, in a sense, but this one really, really strikes. And here's another one. Trilobite, a generative artwork.
00:19:04.954 - 00:19:18.398, Speaker A: So interesting piece there. An acid boy, acid flame. So interesting work here. I'm almost ready. I'm almost ready. Look at Francesca. She looks beautiful.
00:19:18.398 - 00:19:36.458, Speaker A: Do you want to be on tv? Do you want to be on YouTube tv? Why not? Okay. Before the battery dies here. Hurry. There's Francesca, my cousin. Hello. We're going for lunch shortly, and it's gonna be wonderful in Rome. So do you know how to turn on the power? It doesn't work.
00:19:36.458 - 00:19:55.186, Speaker A: Okay, I'm gonna have to run through the rest of this episode here. Thank you for making the cameo here. Acid boy, here is acid boy. Okay. It is much later in the day. Lunch was great, and the battery was starting to die. Everything started getting very choppy there.
00:19:55.186 - 00:20:14.340, Speaker A: So I'm re recording the final bit here. And so acid boy with another one. And echoes on. It's great to see acid boy mint some stuff again, I think. I'm not. I don't know if he took a break, but great to just see work by acid boy again. Again.
00:20:14.340 - 00:20:39.070, Speaker A: Kind of has an Awp feel to it, doesn't it? Kind of. I don't know if it's Bridget Riley or some of these AwP artists from the sixties. You definitely see, I would say, a direct kind of lineage, accidental or not. So, yeah. So cool work from acid boy is we go through this again in a much easier way. Look at LB. Let's see if we can make.
00:20:39.070 - 00:21:03.330, Speaker A: I thought this was a pretty. You know, it's interesting, like a lot of these glitch artists, it is interesting how they keep. Keep it interesting, you know, putting it through the glitch video analog processing. This is pretty cool. Structurally, I have to say. The color, I'm always a big fan, as I like to say, magic of painting is in the color, and I use painting in the general sense here. Look at how great this looks.
00:21:03.330 - 00:21:24.754, Speaker A: So just kind of a cool. The body, of course, is a universal subject. So, you know, the face, you know, something we can all relate to. So pretty cool work here from Elbie edition of 15 for five tazos. Let's just see. Twelve left. And somfeh, another, you know, again, could hang in the same room here.
00:21:24.754 - 00:21:38.646, Speaker A: Looks like an eye opening and just a completely different take on it. Right. This was posted on Twitter. And so very cool work here from Somfeh, as per usual. And great color. As well. Again, those could hang in the same room.
00:21:38.646 - 00:21:52.474, Speaker A: Look at this. Awesome work. Let's see if we can get it moving. I may have to reload this. Last sold, 0.25 ETH for cotanakazono. Nice sale, kodakazono.
00:21:52.474 - 00:22:22.306, Speaker A: Quarter of an ETH. Well done. And I also, there's a lot of things I love about this work. The color. The color, first of all. Second of all, the great contrast of the shiny, metallic, biomorphic, you know, structure with kind of a soft, hazy, you know, pastel background, the blues and the pinks. And then you get these wonderful kind of large pixels here, chunky pixels just for good measure.
00:22:22.306 - 00:23:00.444, Speaker A: Nice color again. And finally, and maybe primarily, actually, the composition, I don't remember, like the canvas ratio. I don't remember a horizontal canvas. I think most Dakota's works have been vertical. So kind of a nice, you know, as I like to say, people bringing different to new chains, bringing kind of different ideas visually. And this one's really beautiful. I mean, and I also love how coda is just going what I'd almost attempted to call unapologetically multi chain by just continuing the continuum series, but this time on ETH.
00:23:00.444 - 00:23:13.464, Speaker A: So here we. So here we are at 153. And again, a fantastic sale there for Koda Nakazono. Well done. And Skomra. Skomra's work. Here's Skomra.
00:23:13.464 - 00:24:07.478, Speaker A: This is a series that I've actually, I haven't shown yet that Skomra was doing, but I've been totally enjoying the whole way through. I could have shown it two weeks ago, and I just think it's a really, again, a nice variation, a nice series here with these broken keyboards, classic kind of AI keyboards. If you've ever put retro computer into mid journey or something, you start getting these crazy keyboards. What I like about what Skomra is doing is it's getting taken a level further by turning into a line drawing. And you even see what looks like AI distortions here and AI distortions here, but again, not just the photographic kind, but turned into a line drawing. So putting that extra step into the work. And sometimes that really, sometimes that's all you need to actually just take idea that a lot of people have seen and then just taking it one step further.
00:24:07.478 - 00:24:43.044, Speaker A: So really nicely done there. Even kind of AI eyes, nice lips. Again, just even that little color difference there. Again, the originality that comes with AI, and you see it most obviously in the keyboards and say the extra hand there, what seems to be an extra hand venta, also with some interesting experimentation, kind of darker. Me, myself, and I, and again, has a bit of a. Kind of a Francis bacon kind of feel to it in the colors we've seen. We've seen venta do, I think a homage to bacon.
00:24:43.044 - 00:25:06.274, Speaker A: So that's not crazy to think that. That maybe there's a bit of a bacon influence here. I also like there's kind of an interesting psychological aspect to this whole title here. So kind of, you know, somewhat of a psychological work here. AI and editing. I think that's what we can determine from venta. Time's AI edition of ten for five tezos a piece.
00:25:06.274 - 00:25:26.562, Speaker A: Let's see how it's doing. Nine available. It's a little slow to leave the market. Back to Santiago. You know, we looked at this series earlier, and so it's always good to check in as things are minting out. And this is another improp series, I thought, you know, pretty interesting. Pretty interesting piece through improps.
00:25:26.562 - 00:25:46.792, Speaker A: So, you know, improp's creating different kinds of results here. And just an interesting result here. A face for the end of time, and another incredibly poetic title here. SDXl, so stable. Diffusion portrait series, p five js. Yeah, and using improps. So interesting combo here.
00:25:46.792 - 00:25:54.460, Speaker A: And paper doll, proudly collected. What a gem. Congrats, paper doll. So classy. Tears dropping. Pokebelly. Love this piece.
00:25:54.460 - 00:26:16.684, Speaker A: I was tagged, and I have to agree, Sonic. Yeah, another stunner here. Another beautiful painting from paper doll. Another beautiful AI painting here. The color. I'm kind of back to the color, that green background with this white dress and sheets and white dogs. Very nice.
00:26:16.684 - 00:26:42.404, Speaker A: And even down here in the corners, just a nice piece. Look at gloomtube. And I'm pretty sure this is a physical. I saw it posted on Instagram. And there's a good title on this punisher sticker on a truck. Just another kind of beautiful capturing of the. Kind of the reality, I guess you could say, of contemporary America.
00:26:42.404 - 00:27:34.688, Speaker A: There's something kind of distinctly american about it. Again, Punisher, of course, a Marvel comics character, but. And it's funny. It's like. It's almost like a stylized Punisher logo, the kind you'd almost find just like an unofficial logo of the punisher that is made for trucks like this. So, you know, gloom tube with the eye, the eye of recognition, of being, you know, as Ballard's, as Burroughs said about Ballard in the preface to the atrocity exhibition, you know, with surgical precision, you know, uh, identifying, you know, the kind of the underlying myths of the culture. And I kind of see that here with this, frankly, beautifully painted, what looks like a physical work here from Gloom tube.
00:27:34.688 - 00:28:21.864, Speaker A: I think the physical works are, again, going somewhere here. This is quite beautifully painted, isn't it? So nice work from Gloomtube, I assume a what I call a physical NfT Punisher sticker on a truck. Gloom tube. Is this sold out? Yeah. One for sale from Roerich at 69 tezos, selling out at 20 tezos and sent to a few lucky winners there. And continuing on, Kristen Hjillergerdi, the norwegian gallerist, really up and comer, probably, I'd say the biggest name, like up and coming name in the contemporary art scene have been showing the works forever, at least in my world, but I suspect actually in the larger world. Opening several galleries in London, one in Palm Beach, Florida.
00:28:21.864 - 00:28:46.056, Speaker A: You know, a lot of rich people there. So here, this artist is Amy Beger. Cat is parading in paradise, opening tonight at our Berlin gallery. So if I was in Berlin, I'd probably go check that out. It looks like a pretty, or again, another original painter. Not easy, frankly, to find original contemporary art painting. Art, art painters, I would argue, despite probably more art painters than ever.
00:28:46.056 - 00:29:15.738, Speaker A: Painters than ever today. But as my dad used to say, it's almost like it's all been done to a certain degree. So really, when you see originality with physical painting, you got to be impressed. In my world, like, I'm impressed because it's really like there are things that can be done. But for me, it's the obvious route, is to actually use digital as your kind of starting block. And then, so you're kind of bringing in a fresh medium. So then all of a sudden you have a whole bunch of ideas.
00:29:15.738 - 00:29:59.372, Speaker A: And then as we were discussing with Mac TXT, maybe screen print, some those things, and you start introducing, you know, new, like, digital into painting. So when you just see, like, without kind of an obvious digital reference here and it, and it working, here's another piece, a little slideshow here. You gotta be impressed, you know? So Amy beger some cats. I mean, the subject matter is classic kind of Warhol like, but really very nice painting and fun and good eye from this gallerist here. Again, one to watch and follow. Here's another artist countdown to West Palm beach opening. So these guys are firing on all cylinders.
00:29:59.372 - 00:30:28.056, Speaker A: Sarabur man artist. Saraberman, artist. If I'm pronouncing that right, Sarah Berman is probably what it is. Sarah Berman, artist kind of has a bit of a klimp feel to it, doesn't it? Kind of a klimt influence. One could argue. What is the mediums here? No medium here, but kind of looks like there's some sort of, almost like a wax in here of some kind. I think sometimes you have oil painting with wax.
00:30:28.056 - 00:30:46.984, Speaker A: So anyways, pretty interesting. Kind of a modern contemporary t shirt and even clothing here at the bottom, the shoe. Nice piece. And are we through? Yeah. So there we go. And I thought we had music here, but I have been running. I am just trying to get this done.
00:30:46.984 - 00:30:55.504, Speaker A: Sometimes it's just about showing up. So thanks, everybody, for being here. And next week should be a little smoother ride. Until next time. Take care.
