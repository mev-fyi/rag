00:00:07.720 - 00:00:31.042, Speaker A: An artist like no other. You can tell by his name. Today we're very pleased to welcome the inimitable hasdrubal waffle to the show. The excitement is real. Artist journal, April 12, 2023. Broadcasting live from Berlin and New York City on Rugradio via Twitter space. My name is Adrian Pokebelli and we welcome back.
00:00:31.042 - 00:00:41.026, Speaker A: Co host Runetune is trying to get hooked up here. Has druble. We're going to go to you. You sound ready to go. How is your week going?
00:00:41.210 - 00:00:42.282, Speaker B: Am I on?
00:00:42.458 - 00:00:46.214, Speaker A: You are on. We hear the voice at last.
00:00:47.914 - 00:00:50.654, Speaker B: Can I screw up the voice print real quick?
00:00:51.474 - 00:00:59.752, Speaker A: Absolutely. I'm inviting rune tune to speak and. Yeah, what do you mean the voice print? Are you trying to distort it?
00:00:59.888 - 00:01:02.524, Speaker B: Hello, my name is has Strubler.
00:01:03.704 - 00:01:07.088, Speaker A: Well, now I'm going to have no idea who we're talking to here.
00:01:07.176 - 00:01:13.000, Speaker B: I'll just do that once so that, you know, when the Skynet goes live, they're confused.
00:01:13.192 - 00:01:30.280, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. You know, it's funny, you were just learning Twitter spaces here, and I don't even know how to use the voice transformer, so you might be a step ahead of me. Already you have leapfrogged my Twitter spaces ability. And I see runetune has arrived here as well. Rune, how are you doing?
00:01:30.472 - 00:01:31.336, Speaker B: Doing great.
00:01:31.440 - 00:01:50.230, Speaker A: Wow. It's already a room over here. I'm really talk to is drubble. Well, I think all of us are. I think has struble waffle has captured our imaginations in the last few months with his just very. I almost want to call it innocent, but they're not so innocent. I mean, they're actually pretty provocative work, actually.
00:01:50.230 - 00:01:52.030, Speaker A: How's druble? How are things going?
00:01:52.182 - 00:02:07.754, Speaker B: Things are going well. Yeah. Really excited to be on the show. Really excited to be talking to you. And Roentoon pretty hyped right now. Hopefully I don't disappoint or bum out or, you know, hurt anyone's feelings or anything.
00:02:08.934 - 00:02:24.650, Speaker A: I was going to say it might be impossible, but maybe the last part is possible. And so people who. Who may, you know, you might offend. So we'll see where it goes. We're open for all places. Where are you calling from, by the way? And you don't need to say the city if you don't want to, but just give us a vague idea.
00:02:24.802 - 00:02:26.346, Speaker B: Oh, Pacific Northwest.
00:02:26.490 - 00:02:30.018, Speaker A: Pacific Northwest. Okay. That's pretty. That's pretty vague.
00:02:30.106 - 00:02:33.374, Speaker B: Good. Can I ask a real quick question?
00:02:33.674 - 00:02:34.370, Speaker A: Please do.
00:02:34.442 - 00:02:48.726, Speaker B: With the ground rules. I've heard you say before that you run a you run a tight ship, like a family operation. Family show. So are we talking pg 13 here? I don't want to. I don't want to, you know, curse like a sailor.
00:02:48.870 - 00:03:12.092, Speaker A: But you know what? You do whatever makes you happy in a sense. Like, I keep the YouTube show a family operation for the most part. Ideally, I mean, I have to say. I mean, that's something I picked up from art Bell, which I always loved. And to me, it just kind of created a classy show, coast to coast. Amazing. You know, he's like, we don't do the curse words, but, you know, you do whatever feels comfortable.
00:03:12.092 - 00:03:31.332, Speaker A: We want the real histruble here as well. The recordings are edited after all, right, poco belly? They absolutely are. So I can make them PG 13. I can get the bleep out there. Could you really? In theory, why not? I mean, I might have to get find an audio sample on live, you know, the swear remover.
00:03:31.428 - 00:03:44.890, Speaker B: You know, I'll try to keep it as classy as I can. I'm wearing a tie. Uh, I did. I did put on a tie, and I'm wearing my corpse paint. And, uh, you know, I think that's a good combo. I'll. I'll try to keep it.
00:03:44.890 - 00:03:47.242, Speaker B: Keep it above, uh, above board.
00:03:47.378 - 00:04:28.434, Speaker A: Awesome. And, uh, yeah, and maybe we'll get some video later here in the show so we can see the corpse paint, but give us a little bit of background on you, you know, how long have you been doing art? And did you start with digital? Like, I get the sense just from all our, you know, smattering of communications, I get the sense that you're kind of like, maybe like me in the sense that you're almost Gen X. Like I'm right on the board of Gen X. Maybe you're a few years younger, I'm not sure, but just the references and everything. It seems to me like you're almost a bit of a child of the counterculture to a certain degree and have a hint of Gen X in you, if not physically in spirit. Do you have anything to say about that?
00:04:29.444 - 00:04:46.284, Speaker B: Well, I'm not a boomer, and I'm not a zoomer. I'm definitely in between there somewhere. X is definitely a smart play. I would say that you picked up on a few gestures, and you're probably very accurate.
00:04:46.404 - 00:05:08.828, Speaker A: Well, very good. And, yeah, maybe I see it also in the references in the work, and I just see almost a similar sort of, again, kind of like countercultural reference background. So, anyway, so tell us how you got started in arts did you go to art school and all that sort of thing? Is it something you've just been sort of tooling around with recently and you just kind of stumbled on a great thing? What's your story?
00:05:08.956 - 00:05:58.234, Speaker B: Wow. Well, I've been drawing since I was probably five, and I, you know, when I was a kid, I kind of profited off of being able to draw in school. Like, I would get a lot of Otis spunkmeyer cookies for illustrating people's yearbooks and stuff. So that was kind of a good gig, and that was kind of the first paying gig I had doing visual arts. And then I went to a school that didn't have art courses in high school. And then I got kicked out of that school and ended up junior year in a different school with a really, really wonderful art teacher. And she kind of pushed me towards not only art, but also art, art therapy as, like, a potential career move.
00:05:58.234 - 00:07:01.270, Speaker B: And so I kind of thought about art therapy for a while. I went to community college and kind of worked a bunch of jobs at the same time, and I lucked out and got a gig at an art house that played a lot of foreign films. And so I got exposed to quite a few really interesting directors and movies that way. And then I got a gig at an art gallery, not as like a curator or anything, but mainly as, like, the grunt worker that hangs things on the wall and kind of moves big giant sculptural installation objects in. And then I moved out to the west coast and lived in Olympia, Washington, for a while during the apogee of riot Girl and Queercore and zine making and different festivals that they were throwing every year, which was really rad. I volunteered at Yo Yo Gogo, which was a big music fest here where they had bands coming from all over the world, bands from Japan and New York and wherever. It just kind of had this really nice.
00:07:01.270 - 00:07:10.022, Speaker B: I wouldn't say subcultural. It's kind of like micro cultural, which I'm finding a lot of echoes in that, in the NFT scene, which is really rad.
00:07:10.158 - 00:07:34.872, Speaker A: That's very cool. And may I ask, and don't feel like you need to answer this, but why'd you get kicked out of school? Were you sort of like, you know, ironically, like, I was a c student. Like, I got into university by 1%, actually. And then they always say your marks are going to go down 10% when you go to university. Mine actually went up, so maybe it had more to do with the high school than anything. But anyway, what happened to you if you don't mind talking about it.
00:07:34.888 - 00:08:22.096, Speaker B: Yeah, I think I did better in college than high school, too. I went to a school that was really rigorous, and I hung out with, I guess, the wrong crowd, and we hid the lectern in the restroom and got busted. And the math teacher, Mister Markey, was not very thrilled about that, so he failed pretty much all of us. And I got sent to summer school, and I was like, oh, here's my chance out. And so I just kind of didn't, didn't really put the effort in, in summer school, and I got kicked out because you need to maintain a 3.0 gpa. And then I got put in public school, which was super rad, and that was kind of, kind of what ended up happening.
00:08:22.096 - 00:08:23.136, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:08:23.320 - 00:08:32.640, Speaker A: It's pretty hilarious. Hiding the lectern in the restroom there. That is classic. So you're going to private school then? Yeah, it was that correct?
00:08:32.672 - 00:08:36.430, Speaker B: Yeah, it was a catholic school. I grew up in a. In a predominant.
00:08:36.502 - 00:08:38.474, Speaker A: That explains the corpse pain, I guess.
00:08:40.054 - 00:09:27.044, Speaker B: I grew up in a predominantly jewish city in upstate New York, about an hour outside of Toronto. It was Rochester. New York is where I'm from, and the public school was actually one of the top schools in the country from what I'm told by, you know, us news, whatever, the way they rate schools. But for some reason, my mom really wanted me to go to the school, and she was worried that I was going to get into, you know, all sorts of trouble, I guess, or she was, like, concerned about. I was. I was skateboarding a lot, hanging out with a lot of older kids, and kind of coming home late. And so she took my college fund and applied it to tuition at this private school.
00:09:27.044 - 00:09:28.208, Speaker B: So I didn't.
00:09:28.256 - 00:09:28.704, Speaker A: Oh, man.
00:09:28.744 - 00:09:42.226, Speaker B: I didn't actually end up having any, anything left over and had to work, work throughout college, which was interesting, though, that opened up a lot of new opportunities, too. So kind of a good thing all around.
00:09:42.370 - 00:09:46.346, Speaker A: Great. So that's super interesting. And in college, what did you end up studying?
00:09:46.530 - 00:10:34.880, Speaker B: Primarily, primarily education. And then I was really kind of convinced I wanted to do special education for a really long time. And so I studied juvenile justice systems and special education and just general education, but also history. And then I took a ton of computer classes, like right at the moment when you didn't really need to learn HTML and CSS anymore, because everything was turning into what you see, what you get. And I took Flash. Flash was actually kind of maybe first software program that I really, like, gravitated towards, because I liked the way that it looked just for even drawing with it when it was macromedia before Adobe absorbed it, didn't get to know any of this because you know, Google blogs or blogger had come out and you know, it was kind of, it was kind of funny in a way. It was interesting.
00:10:34.880 - 00:10:50.964, Speaker B: I learned a lot and you know, I kind of hit the wall at JavaScript. I'm pretty amazed when I see some of the JavaScript artists doing their thing because I like, that was, that was definitely a wall for me. I couldn't, I couldn't code at all.
00:10:51.424 - 00:11:05.486, Speaker A: So prior to getting involved with like digital art and the stuff that you share on tezos, what were the things that inspired you when you were younger and like what was kind of like your art life like before nfts?
00:11:05.590 - 00:11:46.216, Speaker B: It was way different. It was all physical and I was working really large on very large scale pieces. I did a couple of independent study contracts where you could kind of choose, you kind of choose your medium, choose your aesthetic, choose your, you know, choose your subject matter and then just go for it. And the professors would just let you kind of do your thing, they wouldn't bug you for like three months, which was rad. And I was working really large. I got really into sewing into canvases. So cutting up canvas and sewing back onto the canvas either older canvases and newer canvases and really working with texture a lot.
00:11:46.216 - 00:12:06.450, Speaker B: And I think that one of the things that kind of kept me away from digital art for a really long time was I just didn't know how to, how to do texture and texture was something that was such a draw to me and eventually I kind of figured some workarounds and I mean people, people say that, you know, I've got a lot of texture in my work now, which is great because that's kind of what I'm going for. Right.
00:12:06.482 - 00:12:10.818, Speaker A: I think I compared one of your works once to like frosting on a cake.
00:12:10.866 - 00:12:49.200, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And that's like exactly what I was going for with that. And it's like a lot of happy accidents. There's a lot of, you know, trial and error, a lot of experimentation. I probably only mint about maybe 15% of what I do. I do still work physically a lot in terms of drawing and painting, you know, working with acrylics and I love, there's the really wonderful marker out of Japan called copic and I love working with copic markers, those are great. I was doing like installation work for a little while and exhibiting at like bars and coffee shops and things like that.
00:12:49.200 - 00:13:25.932, Speaker B: And you know, I didn't really ever sell anything. I would exhibit with friends and, like, they would sell, like, everything they put up, and I would sell nothing. And I would just be like, well, you know, maybe this stuff is too dark, or maybe I'm not. Maybe I'm not really hitting it, but, you know, it's all fine. It was. It was cool. I ended up meeting a lot of physical artists back then and kind of got ideas from them and kind of created a little community for a minute there, and then came out west, and it was, like, pretty much just music, music stuff the whole time I was out here until.
00:13:25.932 - 00:13:59.310, Speaker B: Until recently, when I got back into visual arts, I took an art therapy program up in Seattle for a couple years, and then I ran out of financial aid. And so right before my internship, I got placed in. I got placed in a location I wasn't really thrilled about. I wanted to work with people with TBI and people that were on the autism spectrum, and they put me with, like, senior citizens. And it just seems so. I mean, nothing against senior citizens. They're great, but it just seems so, like, I don't know.
00:13:59.310 - 00:14:20.942, Speaker B: It didn't really work for me. And then I ran right up against the allocated amount for your financial aid. And in the US, if you run out of the federal subsidy financial aid, then you have to take out private loans, and private loans are at, like, these massive interest rates. And it's just kind of not a good. Not a good pay, not a good trade off, in my opinion. Right.
00:14:20.998 - 00:14:25.114, Speaker A: Especially for what you're trying to do. It's not like you're trying to, like, be a surgeon.
00:14:25.774 - 00:14:37.716, Speaker B: Yeah. And then I was, you know, I was a couple years into this, and I was like, wow, I still have at least three or four years left. Like, that's pretty wild, just to be.
00:14:37.860 - 00:14:40.948, Speaker A: Nothing else, just to help people through art, you know?
00:14:40.996 - 00:15:07.402, Speaker B: Yeah. Which seems really. And I don't know if you necessarily need schooling for that, because I think that that's something that we innately want to do. You know, we want to kind of resolve any of the internal stuff happening by creating or by making. It doesn't matter what medium, it's always something available. And it just seemed kind of redundant after a while, like. And I was not really into some of the directives that we were learning.
00:15:07.402 - 00:15:23.414, Speaker B: Seemed really kind of corny. And I don't know. It's cool, though. It's a good field. I love, like, all the pioneers of that field, like Edith Kramer and Judy Rubin. I think that they had a lot of interesting insights. And I wouldn't tell anyone not to go to art therapy.
00:15:23.414 - 00:15:29.410, Speaker B: It just wasn't something I could continue doing, mainly because of financial reasons.
00:15:29.522 - 00:16:01.774, Speaker A: Gotcha. So just backing up a little bit, and if anybody wants to join the conversation, just put a request up and we will add you to the stage here. So just a question on your physical work then. Was it a similar subject matter to what you're doing now, or did you have a break in your content? And you said, okay, now that I. That, you know, this kind of content seems to work with what seems to be, as you mentioned in a comment previously, you know, using kids tools, painting programs. Did your content change when you went digital?
00:16:02.314 - 00:16:24.690, Speaker B: Well, yeah, I think so. I think it did. I mean, I was. I did kind of jumped around to a lot of different things. I had a silkscreening independent study, and then I was helping out in the silk screening silkscreening space at the. At the college here. And then I did color photography for a while and was learning darkroom process.
00:16:24.690 - 00:16:34.322, Speaker B: And. And that was super interesting. And then with the painting, it was always oils. I don't know why I thought, like, oh, acrylic is cheating or something like a really.
00:16:34.378 - 00:16:37.530, Speaker A: I thought the same thing. I had to learn the hard way. Yeah.
00:16:37.562 - 00:17:23.484, Speaker B: Like a really, like, silly, like, view of it. And I only paint acrylics now because oils are just a pain to deal with. But at the time, I love, you know, just the way the oils kind of mixed. And. And I liked working really big, and I liked adhering all sorts of objects to the canvas. Anything from, like, mufflers that I found on the road to, you know, arrays of lights that could be plugged in to statues and, you know, obviously, like, different textures and grip tape from skateboards and whatever I could throw onto a canvas to give it, like, more of, like, a disorienting kind of amount of depth I would go for. And that was something I really went into.
00:17:23.484 - 00:17:58.188, Speaker B: And the subject matter was maybe more abstract. I did a ton of figure drawing classes, and, you know, I feel like I can render pretty well. But at the time, I was doing a lot of abstract stuff and painting with both hands. And I kind of still do this occasionally. I won't say which pieces, but I've done a few pieces on the tezos NFT space that are. They're done with my non dominant hand or using both hands just because I like the way that it challenges me. I like trying different things and trying to set up different things to, uh, to give me a little bit of a little bit of a challenge.
00:17:58.316 - 00:18:10.798, Speaker A: It gives you a little bit of an edge, too, I'd say. Just in terms of if you're trying to make, you know, different kind of work, it kind of reminds me of what you're saying earlier about, you know, using flash and actually liking the way that the drawing.
00:18:10.886 - 00:18:11.430, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah.
00:18:11.502 - 00:18:36.150, Speaker A: Because to me, that was just like, it sounds like exactly like your painting programs and maybe, you know, that you use now and, you know, just taking untypical tools, shall we say, and kind of running with them a little bit. So it seems like you have a fairly open mind when it comes to these kind of aesthetic ideas and just technical ideas and running away with them. Would you agree with that statement?
00:18:36.262 - 00:19:05.574, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't want to ever close myself off to any. Any option. I really love experimenting with things, and not just. Not just visual arts, but also, you know, sound and writing. And, I don't know, I feel like it kind of. Like it kind of lights a. Lights a fire under you and get you thinking differently or thinking about the way that most of the things that we take granted can be, like, repurposed or reutilized or reassembled to make new.
00:19:05.574 - 00:19:34.724, Speaker B: New forms or new images. And so that was something I was always kind of, I guess that would be like, the continuum that's been something that's kind of continued since physical work onto digital. Oh, and music, too. I did, you know, I did a lot of stuff based on music. I had a installation in community college that was, you know, four massive paintings. And below the paintings were these. They had these, like, these cassette recorders that you would use in the library when you were little.
00:19:34.724 - 00:19:59.530, Speaker B: And they were like. They were like, to help you, help you learn reading. And so I adhered those to the walls under the paintings and then just had a bunch of stuff going on. Like, there was, like, visual projectors projecting over the paintings, and the paintings, and the projector kind of created a new image in itself. And then there was, like, all this, like, chaotic kind of sound happening. I don't know. I'm probably not doing a great job explaining it, but.
00:19:59.642 - 00:20:27.646, Speaker A: No, you're doing a fabulous job. So a quick follow up just on what you're talking about then, is, do you now make paintings that are kind of loosely in the spirit of your digital now? Because I'd be very tempted, but all of a sudden, it's like, because you kind of seem to have hit on something with these kind of kids tools, and now, like, are you tempted to be like, oh, I need to kind of emulate this sort of spirit, so to speak, on canvas, it actually feels.
00:20:27.830 - 00:21:20.634, Speaker B: It feels different doing physical work than doing digital work because I feel like it's way easier to sublimate into analog work or physical work where you just kind of get going and then you're just lost and everything around you just kind of disappears and, and, you know, time dilates and you're, you're just kind of in the moment, like, getting consumed by it. And digital is a little bit more like, well, did this work? Now this didn't work, you know? Okay, so undo. And, and you're kind of, you're kind of also reacting to, like, the stuff that's happening around you in your environment. So in this case, like, things that are happening either in conversations I'm having with people and messages or stuff that I'm seeing other artists do. There's so, like, there's so, so many incredible much artists on just tazos that, like, it's kind of ridiculous in a way. There's just an immense amount of talent.
00:21:20.674 - 00:21:21.146, Speaker A: It is.
00:21:21.250 - 00:22:29.012, Speaker B: Totally agree. And, you know, I think that we're all kind of reacting to that in a sense, and it's taking those things and then being on Twitter, you're seeing, like, you're just seeing images, like, all day long, you know? And of course those are going to affect the way that you, you synthesize those images into your own images or your own image making. So the digital stuff is a little bit more maybe contrived in that sense where I'm thinking about it a little bit more. I'm trying to, like, I have noticed that, like, the more time you spend on a digital image, the less, like, people like it and, like, the stuff that you just kind of do really fast or, like, or try to get out there and, you know, that's maybe more gestural. That stuff seems to, that stuff seems to speak to people more. So I try not to really, like, spend too long on certain things. Lately, I've been doing these collages with, like, you know, stuff that's just sitting around and trying to create new images to go with things that, you know, maybe a year or two old and putting them all together, and that's, that's been really fun, but they take a long time.
00:22:29.068 - 00:22:35.336, Speaker A: And it's like, when, when you make these things, do you use a variety of tools or is it all just in one, one place?
00:22:35.400 - 00:22:57.064, Speaker B: Lately, I've been switching up a lot. I just started to use Craig Hickman's new version. I guess it's new to me. Craig Hickman created Kidpix, and it's this wonderful, wonderful program. Everyone should try it. It's so fun to use, and I find it really inspiring. And you get one layer, that's it.
00:22:57.064 - 00:23:05.318, Speaker B: You get a layer. I don't even think there's more than one undo. So you're kind of, I love that.
00:23:05.406 - 00:23:14.674, Speaker A: You'Re kind of, I mean, it forces you, it forces you to work quickly. It really does. Like, you can't overwork it because it does get ruined in digital all the time.
00:23:15.134 - 00:24:02.424, Speaker B: Well, and then the version that I've been using up to this point until like maybe two or three weeks ago, it crashes all the time. So not only do you have like one undo and one layer, but you're like, you're kind of racing against the clock because it can crash at any moment and then you're kind of screwed. And so I'm like screenshotting stuff, and as I make new marks or whatever, I'm screenshotting, and I hope this doesn't crash. Now. I've almost got it done. And then sometimes it does crash or it does glitch out, and that creates maybe an interesting image on its own, which is kind of cool I've used, where it's actually glitched out and you can see it in the image.
00:24:02.544 - 00:24:18.164, Speaker A: I love the deadline that can come out of nowhere, the imaginary deadline, because, again, with art, you can spend forever on something. I just think that's great. So when you're using Kidpix, then is this something you use on an emulator or is this just a web program?
00:24:18.664 - 00:25:14.470, Speaker B: No, both versions are JavaScript based. The black and white one is, is a little bit buggier, and that's the one that I was kind of, you know, always in a race against time to get, to get it to look right. But I've just started recently using the newer version, but I still think it's, it's fairly old, but, and it was new to me to find, but it's in color, which is super rad because the other one was just monochromatic. And I think Notan Mariana has used it a few times in some of her work. You know, I like what she does, and it just never clicked to me. I kept seeing that strawberry, and I'd use the strawberry and the black and white one, but I never realized, like, oh, wow, there's like a color version of this program that I could be using, totally stable, and it has like, way more features. And so the schizo analysis and the schizopolis and then the one that I minted this morning, the bootleg one, we're all done with that newer version of Kidpix.
00:25:14.470 - 00:25:40.964, Speaker B: And then maybe, you know, there were elements of tux paint in there and elements. What else did I use in those? I guess just Microsoft painting. I use a lot of online JavaScript based stuff, and it really kind of blows my mind that it's gotten to the point where you can have a full program functioning in a web browser that makes interesting and beautiful images, and it's like probably less than a few hundred lines of code or whatever.
00:25:41.124 - 00:25:49.234, Speaker A: That is amazing. So you're exporting or you're taking one image and then you'll put it into, say, Microsoft paint, for example.
00:25:49.534 - 00:26:34.046, Speaker B: No, I just use, I use paint. I have tabs open on, I mean, right now I've got like eight or nine tabs open, and each one is a different free online software. And I just kind of jump back and forth during the week, you know, doodling. And that's why I don't really call myself an artist. I like, I kind of consider myself more of a doodler, you know, and I'm just kind of like, when I was younger, it was always post it notes, you know? And so, like, now, like a tab on a web browser is like a post it note. I'm just like doodling throughout the day writing, you know, just writing whatever comes to mind, you know, and drawing whatever comes to mind and just kind of going for it and then eventually assembling all of that together into something that maybe has a little more coherency and.
00:26:34.070 - 00:26:42.580, Speaker A: Will you ever use like Photoshop or anything to assemble everything, or do you, what's the post production here? Do you do a kind of post production or not?
00:26:42.612 - 00:27:18.468, Speaker B: Yeah, lately I've been using. What is it called? I don't even know what it's called. It's a, well, I was using Gimp for a while, and Gimp was really cool. But I'm not as fluent in gimp as I am in, what's this pixelmator. And pixelmator is like, I don't know, it's like a cheap, very like, lightweight version of Photoshop, I guess you would say. I used Flash a little bit after Adobe got it, and I was really into after effects for a couple years. I really had fun with that one, but at the time, computers couldn't really keep up with it.
00:27:18.468 - 00:27:26.104, Speaker B: There's a lot going on with after effects. And then they moved to that whole subscription model, and I wasn't into that, like free.
00:27:28.004 - 00:27:36.928, Speaker A: Absolutely. I actually have used Pixelmator. They actually have one on for the phone. I assume it's still there. I mean, I was using it I think like four or five years ago.
00:27:36.976 - 00:27:37.400, Speaker B: Oh really?
00:27:37.472 - 00:27:53.392, Speaker A: And it's funny, I actually made certain works that I never would have made otherwise because they just had a really big kind of pixel brush, actually a square brush. And it was fabulous, actually. And I never would have made works without that. And as you say, it's kind of like a cheap photoshop.
00:27:53.528 - 00:28:09.436, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I love it. I mean, and it doesn't have all of the like bloat that you don't really need. It's very like, it's very efficient, it's stable. It never really crashes. I've thrown, you know, a lot at it and it doesn't, it doesn't seem to have many hiccups.
00:28:09.540 - 00:28:34.644, Speaker A: Excellent. So if anybody wants to join the stage, feel free to put a request. I see tons of wonderful people from the community here. Sabato, Mikey Delacrem TXT, Joe Rogan's dad, isolationist Martin Jojo, edge queue I mean, and we're just getting started here. There's popple. So put in a request and we'll happily join you up. I may prank people with invite to speak here.
00:28:34.644 - 00:29:04.898, Speaker A: So Rune too. And do you have any questions for our friend Mister Waffle? I love hearing that you use all these like free and kind of like retro tools to make all these images. One thing I like the most about a lot of your work is just the use of color. I feel like with so much of what you do, it's like these colors are, they're like the kind of thing that like, you have your own like, sensibility when it comes to color. And like, I can close my eyes and be away from the computer and like feel the colors that you use.
00:29:05.026 - 00:29:26.928, Speaker B: Oh, thank you. Yeah, I mean, and I'm. That's like a weird thing too, because. Right. Like, if we're, if we're like, to believe all of the findings of like, neuroscience, like, we're all seeing a different color, red. Right. And I like my color palette to me looks normal, but to someone else it may look really hideous or really beautiful.
00:29:26.928 - 00:29:30.632, Speaker B: I don't really know. So it's good to hear that. It's good to get feedback on that.
00:29:30.728 - 00:29:41.424, Speaker A: Before, when you start, do you have an idea before you start to do all these doodles? Or you just kind of like, you just get going and then something occurs or how does that work for you?
00:29:41.544 - 00:30:07.494, Speaker B: Sometimes it's conceptual or I have like an idea. I just kind of have a running text file ideas, and I've got. I've gotten through quite a bit of them, but there's probably, like, 500 different, like, conceptual type of ideas. Like, Vodrum's, like, probably one of the. One of the movies I've watched more times than I'd like to admit. But. But just coming up with the idea of him losing a bag of cheese puffs in his abdomen instead of losing the gun in his abdomen.
00:30:07.494 - 00:30:12.194, Speaker B: And so I wrote that down, just thinking, like, well, I don't even know if I could draw, like, a cheese puff.
00:30:13.634 - 00:30:15.674, Speaker A: That'd be a hard thing to pull off.
00:30:15.754 - 00:30:44.470, Speaker B: But, like, stuff like that, like, you know, that's more of, like, a conceptual thing. But then there's other stuff that I just kind of, like, go for, and I just start. And actually in, like, deluxe paint and stuff, I'm just kind of. I'm just kind of going for. I'm treating it more like a canvas to paint into. And that's like a program that just is always really mystifying to me. I'm amazed by what, like, sabato accomplishes in, in deluxe paint because it's an extremely tricky program to wrap your head around.
00:30:44.470 - 00:30:50.830, Speaker B: There's all these different key functions and there's hidden menus and hidden screens, and you can get lost in it pretty quick.
00:30:50.942 - 00:31:10.514, Speaker A: I did bring up an emulator of deluxe paint inspired by Sabato's beautiful works. And, yeah, at least the online versions. And Sabato, I've given you an invite. Come up on stage if you like, and then we'll get to Chimasuku Jackson right away. But I echo your sentiment. At least some of those web version. Web version emulators of deluxe paint, like you say.
00:31:10.514 - 00:31:21.138, Speaker A: I mean, it's like, get out the manual. And, yeah, I felt like I had no control. But you know what? I kind of love that, too, because then I start doing things that I never would do otherwise.
00:31:21.186 - 00:31:21.714, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:31:21.754 - 00:31:21.954, Speaker A: Right.
00:31:21.994 - 00:31:23.570, Speaker B: Yeah, you kind of stumble across new.
00:31:23.602 - 00:31:34.132, Speaker A: Things, like the happy accidents, as you call them. And so. Yeah. So anyways, Chimasuku Jackson, welcome to the stage. And how are things going? You're in Seattle.
00:31:34.258 - 00:31:46.208, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm in Seattle. I just had a quick one for struble. The comment I was going to say is I really enjoyed that program that you created, that waffle draw. If that was you, I'm not sure if you made that.
00:31:46.296 - 00:31:48.208, Speaker B: That was actually Santiago made that.
00:31:48.336 - 00:31:49.024, Speaker A: Oh, okay.
00:31:49.064 - 00:32:21.564, Speaker C: Because I was like, that thing was excellent, and I just. I like your work too. But I was just, I didn't know if you had made that or whoever made that, but it's kind of ambiguous, a web3, but it's very, very cool. And the way that you're going through the different programs is also very cool. And also the fact that you're doing, though you said that you had been putting like car mufflers on canvas and doing like, kind of like an assemblage kind of thing is also pretty rad. So I just wanted to ask that question and throw my hat in on that.
00:32:21.604 - 00:32:40.550, Speaker B: Thank you, chief. Yeah, Santiago is, you know, he's the renaissance man of the Tezos NFt blockchain. And I believe that he wrote both waffle draw and this human kernel does not exist draw and the new one, which was the dragon draw, I think he wrote them all with chat.
00:32:40.582 - 00:32:46.710, Speaker A: GPT I have actually sent Santiago an invite to the stage here, but sorry, chimascu, go ahead.
00:32:46.782 - 00:32:57.468, Speaker C: Honestly, that was it. I was just enjoying the conversation and thought I'd jump in there and say hi from the PNW myself. And if you ever come down to Seattle, come pull up on me.
00:32:57.476 - 00:33:04.024, Speaker B: Matt. Yeah, I'm up in Seattle a lot of the week, actually. Part of my job is going up to Seattle.
00:33:05.404 - 00:33:26.954, Speaker A: That's awesome. So then when Rune tune visits his sister in Seattle and I visit my sister in Seattle, we can all hang out and it'll be a wonderful time. Little cakes, welcome to the stage. I can't wait to hear from you. You seem to be a, you know, in my mind I thought maybe you guys were the same, same person, but now I seem to have confirmation that little cakes and has drubble waffle are different.
00:33:27.494 - 00:33:30.714, Speaker D: Yeah, when you hear my voice, you'll know that we're totally different.
00:33:32.294 - 00:33:40.886, Speaker A: I guess so we have a solution here. We have figured out one more thing here today. So tell us about where are you calling from and how are things going?
00:33:40.910 - 00:33:42.302, Speaker D: I'm calling from the east coast.
00:33:42.398 - 00:33:46.856, Speaker A: Oh, very cool. So North America, east coast. Yep, very cool.
00:33:46.950 - 00:33:56.676, Speaker D: So I just wanted to ask if waffles could just talk about the pieces that have sound in them, because those are always my favorite.
00:33:56.780 - 00:34:00.664, Speaker B: Oh, thank you. Hi, little cakes. Hi. What do you want to know?
00:34:02.084 - 00:34:33.116, Speaker D: I don't know. I mean, like you guys were talking so much about like, the visuals and you don't have as many pieces that you minted with sound. But I guess anything that you want to share about, like, I guess when you decide to put sound to pieces or whatever, I guess, like, I know that you have lots of special equipment that you could also talk about in terms of, like, making sound and music.
00:34:33.180 - 00:34:37.356, Speaker B: So, like, music year? Music year, yeah, I mean, it could.
00:34:37.380 - 00:34:44.308, Speaker D: Be that or anything, I guess. I don't know if any. We've talked about it a little bit, but I don't know if everybody else knows.
00:34:44.476 - 00:35:29.230, Speaker B: Sure. I play with a lot of circuit bank gear. I play with a lot of kind of off the beaten path type of gear. Like, there's a wonderful kind of mad genius named Peter Blasser, who has a company called Siat Lombard. And I beta tested a few things that he made, and I've kind of made one of his instruments, the shabuva shantho, kind of a mainstay in my musical arsenal. And there's another gentleman in the UK named Martin House who made these really, really wild samplers that are kind of like. They're not like samplers in the traditional Roland boss sense or whatever, where you're getting, like, high fidelity.
00:35:29.230 - 00:36:02.834, Speaker B: They're like really, really truncated sound manglers. And they're called the dark interpreters. And you actually play them with touch capacitance, little pads that are on the PCB board. And so I use those two instruments a lot and got a lot of broken synths and things that are kind of like they're on their last leg, but they're fun to play with. And I try to record them while they're still working. And just in terms of, like, when to decide if it should be something that belongs, you know, on the blockchain, I don't. You know, if it just makes sense, I'll try to throw an mp3 in there.
00:36:02.834 - 00:36:36.308, Speaker B: But it. It's not something I, like, consciously decide, like, oh, I'm gonna make a noise jam to throw next to this image. With the first Hasdrubal one, the hasdrubal was like, kind of like this secondary account to the authentic waffles one, which didn't have much sound on it at all. And, you know, the first one, the sup one was just kind of like, you know, here's like, hi, this is Hasdrubal. Hasdrubal is generated by AI, by the way. I don't know if we've ever discussed that, but. But Santiago and I were goofing around using this person does not exist.
00:36:36.308 - 00:37:10.972, Speaker B: And kind of having, like, AI exchange on Twitter one day. And he came up with. He came up with Hasdrubal, which I believe was. Was AI generated as well. We just kind of ran with it. And the running joke is that, you know, eventually, when we're Tezos millionaires, we're going to buy jet skis and mini submarines instead of yachts, because yachts are real bougie. So we're gonna, we're gonna get our faces transplanted from these images that were made by this person does not exist so that we can survive the singularity.
00:37:10.972 - 00:37:29.050, Speaker B: And when, you know, skyknight goes live, we'll fit right in. So Hasdrubal. Hasdrubal's face will be my face. I don't know if Santiago actually committed to putting Arlin on his face. He's real handsome, so I don't know if he'd want to, but I love it.
00:37:29.122 - 00:37:50.990, Speaker A: And I almost want to ask you about the Neets really quickly. San Diego has joined us on stage as well as babylonian real estate, who I'm also curious to hear from here, babylonian real estate. You were first, actually, Hasdrubal. Before we go to babylonian real estate, could you just speak to the Neatz project there? Is there anything special going on or are you just kind of mucking around with some portraits?
00:37:51.102 - 00:38:18.204, Speaker B: It was just like a, you know, just a fun thing to try out. Doing a PFP project that was, it's actually really inspired by human kernel. Human kernel. And then I guess dark farms did the, did the FCKrs. And I really liked that too. I liked how they were like PFP projects that weren't all generated, you know, at one specific point in time. Something that could just be kind of loose and relax and.
00:38:18.204 - 00:38:27.164, Speaker B: And I also want to congratulate every neat holder for being put on a FBI extremism list as that word was just added to.
00:38:28.864 - 00:38:30.184, Speaker A: Wonderful, wonderful.
00:38:30.224 - 00:38:34.484, Speaker B: The watch list by the fs. Congrats. We'll all be in the same gulag together.
00:38:34.824 - 00:38:46.218, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll be in the same jail in Seattle. So babylonian real estate, thank you for your patience here. Where are you calling from? And do you have a question from Mister Waffles?
00:38:46.346 - 00:38:52.122, Speaker E: Hey, really glad to be here. And first time caller listener, whatever. Hello, Hindrance.
00:38:52.138 - 00:38:52.962, Speaker B: Hello Pokeball.
00:38:53.058 - 00:39:15.694, Speaker E: Hello Rune tune. You mentioned using flash early in your work and your career. Did you happen to put anything up? Do you know of any websites like newgrounds or such old time platforms for flash types of things? Did you ever put anything up there? This is a two part question, actually, and totally, but I also have a three minute timer going, so I'm expecting everybody's time.
00:39:15.794 - 00:39:41.078, Speaker B: No, it was mainly. It was mainly just stuff for school. I'm trying to think if there is. There may actually be. There may be a couple floating around. I'm not, I'm not sure how, you know, how things like that are indexed, but there were a couple forums that I was posting stuff on at one point, but primarily it was just forums, trial and error stuff, and just kind of, you know, goofing around. But I was using a lot for illustration, really.
00:39:41.078 - 00:39:47.320, Speaker B: And then, you know, action script was kind of convoluted, and I didn't ever really gel with that.
00:39:47.432 - 00:39:50.604, Speaker E: Action script. Isn't that what you program printers with?
00:39:51.584 - 00:40:03.200, Speaker B: No, you, it's kind of like JavaScript, but for Flash. It's like specific to flash, and you basically say, like, you know, make this circle go right, or make this.
00:40:03.392 - 00:40:20.112, Speaker E: So you got deep into it. Because I remember doing Flash and I don't remember any of the programming, so maybe I was just having the consumer, not the developer experience there. I do have one more question, if you'll humor me. Or I can also step down and.
00:40:20.128 - 00:40:21.912, Speaker B: Let the next person go for that.
00:40:21.928 - 00:40:22.496, Speaker A: Okay.
00:40:22.640 - 00:40:44.430, Speaker E: Now, I think one thing we haven't touched on is the drupal's esoteric knowledge of, I think, many subjects, from the occult to maybe we've mentioned some CIA activities. I don't know if you've been in the CIA or have been thinking about the CIA for a long time, but there's an old catalog out of literature called loom panics. I'm not sure if you're familiar with it.
00:40:44.582 - 00:40:52.514, Speaker B: Is it, uh, Perry, was that bloom panic? Was it by, was it by parry? P a r r y. I can't remember.
00:40:53.374 - 00:41:10.778, Speaker E: Am I thinking that maybe sounds. It was a catalog with just, uh, you know, how to build a model airplane that maybe would be an incendiary device. It was one of these kinds of things. I'm sure they went out of business. The question was just, have you ever purchased any literature from that, from that catalog?
00:41:10.866 - 00:41:13.534, Speaker B: I have a lot of palladium press stuff.
00:41:13.954 - 00:41:15.306, Speaker E: All right, I'm going to have to look that up.
00:41:15.330 - 00:41:36.446, Speaker B: Palladium press has a lot of, for a while, I was really into drawing people, like fighting and brawling and stuff. And so they have like all these books about like, self defense, and then they have, you know, these like, you know, how to create small arms, and in a jiffy, they're like these like MacGyver guides or whatever, like creating like. Right, right. A zip gum out of.
00:41:36.470 - 00:41:37.918, Speaker E: You've got a pack of gum.
00:41:38.086 - 00:41:38.854, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:41:38.974 - 00:41:41.294, Speaker E: That's exactly what I'm talking about. So you're familiar?
00:41:41.334 - 00:41:51.590, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I'm not actively building those things. I find them just kind of. All right. Notice all that stuff is kind of interesting to me. Yeah. I don't know. I.
00:41:51.590 - 00:41:54.394, Speaker B: I feel like maybe I shouldn't say too much.
00:41:55.134 - 00:41:55.886, Speaker E: No, don't worry.
00:41:55.910 - 00:41:56.190, Speaker B: I got.
00:41:56.222 - 00:42:12.366, Speaker E: I got the notes and, and certainly this is being recorded, and I've got my guys looking into it already, so this was amazing. Thank you. I'd love to join these more in the future. Thank you, pokeball, for giving me some time here to be kind of a jackass. And I'll take the rest of the conversation off there.
00:42:12.510 - 00:42:39.752, Speaker A: Well, it was a brilliant question. Babylonian. And we're here every week, 930 eastern standard time. Thank you. It was an excellent question because we haven't discussed that, which is there's all sorts of pop culture references, counterculture references all over. And it seems to me, I mean, it's kind of like. I mean, very loosely and indirectly, I mean, it's kind of like a basque kind of thing in the sense that you're just kind of doodling, has dribble, and it's like.
00:42:39.752 - 00:42:49.656, Speaker A: And it just seems. And I just assume, correct me if I'm wrong, so just a lot of the things that are in your head say Ramones or whatever, it just comes out. Like, is it that simple?
00:42:49.760 - 00:42:59.428, Speaker B: Yeah, whatever. I'm. Yeah. If I'm listening to something, I have a job where I drive around. I drive around a lot. And so songs will pop on and I'll just. They'll give me an idea and I'll write it down.
00:42:59.428 - 00:43:16.384, Speaker B: And other times I'm just doodling and something's playing and a lyric will catch my attention or, you know, or I want to throw, like, you know, I try to hide little Easter eggs and a lot of the pieces, and I don't know how many people find them or if I should just even bother doing that anymore.
00:43:17.764 - 00:43:21.984, Speaker A: I think you should give the scholars something to, you know, write about.
00:43:23.704 - 00:43:24.524, Speaker B: Maybe.
00:43:25.664 - 00:43:26.424, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:43:26.584 - 00:43:31.284, Speaker B: Yeah. I don't know. Oh, you know what I did want to say? Well, no, maybe I shouldn't say that.
00:43:31.704 - 00:43:32.800, Speaker A: Say it. Say it.
00:43:32.832 - 00:43:33.624, Speaker B: Well, I was going to say.
00:43:33.664 - 00:43:34.256, Speaker A: Go on.
00:43:34.360 - 00:44:09.220, Speaker B: To go back to Fanger's question about, like, esoteric knowledge and CIA and some of that. I did have a job at one point where I did have security clearance with the FBI. I was doing autocad on a contractual basis for a military contract, and I had to get a top secret sci clearance because I was around a lot of sensitive information. I probably should not have just said that, because now I'm definitely going to be put on some kind of a watch list.
00:44:09.412 - 00:44:12.944, Speaker A: We'll put the excerpt on TikTok there, but maybe that'll.
00:44:13.404 - 00:44:21.702, Speaker B: Maybe I'll go with a maximalist more information, throw people off my path a little bit or obfuscate it a little bit.
00:44:21.798 - 00:44:32.234, Speaker A: Absolutely. San Diego, you've been waiting here patiently. We're excited to hear from you since you've basically seems like you guys have collaborated on a certain level, but you speak to that. San Diego, how's it going?
00:44:33.134 - 00:44:36.834, Speaker F: How are you guys? I'm so glad to be here.
00:44:37.454 - 00:44:39.134, Speaker A: Yeah. Great to have you.
00:44:39.294 - 00:44:40.118, Speaker B: Hi, Santiago.
00:44:40.166 - 00:44:46.846, Speaker F: So happy to be. Yeah. I hear your voice for the first time. It's very exciting, man.
00:44:46.910 - 00:44:47.760, Speaker B: How's it going?
00:44:47.902 - 00:45:17.366, Speaker F: Good. I love your story. I was making breakfast. I woke up without a lot of the easy things around me, so it took some work. So it was a fun part, listening and making breakfast. And then I sat down and opened the d paint, which I didn't know it was called relax Paint. You had showed me that before, and I love it.
00:45:17.390 - 00:45:18.654, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. It's super fun.
00:45:18.814 - 00:45:28.606, Speaker F: Yeah. So I have a question about this. You said that videotron was a movie you watch a lot, right?
00:45:28.710 - 00:45:34.234, Speaker B: I love it. There was so much foreshadowing as to what the world would turn into.
00:45:34.574 - 00:45:55.668, Speaker F: That's great. So my question is, because there's the narrative of the movie, and there's David Harry there. Right, too. And my question is, you relate somehow to the art direction. Right. And the precarious way to show things that is in that movie. Right.
00:45:55.668 - 00:46:11.002, Speaker F: For example, the balloons in your early work have, like, something to do with this distorted or moved from representation that the artifacts have in vidro. Drone.
00:46:11.148 - 00:46:17.630, Speaker B: Yeah, I think I understand. So looking at that movie for some of the. I don't know. Could you rephrase it maybe?
00:46:17.742 - 00:46:34.150, Speaker F: Yeah, I think that maybe it's a movie of which you can say it's great how the story is told, and it's great the visual and sculptural artifacts that are presented to us.
00:46:34.222 - 00:46:34.838, Speaker B: Oh, gotcha.
00:46:34.886 - 00:46:47.908, Speaker F: But they are not. Not exactly sharp effects from this era or even from that era, because I think that in the eighties, it was, like, a little bit more advanced than that.
00:46:48.036 - 00:47:18.776, Speaker B: Yeah, just. You get me just the video of, like, the chamber with the. And they're, like, discussing at one point, like, is that clay on the wall? Is that, like, electric, electrified clay on the wall? Like, that image in itself of just, you know, the. The person bound up and the two people in the hoods come in. It's so creepy and so interesting, and it's grainy. And, like, kind of noisy and, like, that alone. It's just, like, amazing to me.
00:47:18.776 - 00:48:05.680, Speaker B: But then just throughout, like, the whole film, there's, like, all these, you know, you're kind of wondering, you know, is he imagining sitting next to Debbie Harry? It's James woods. That's who I was trying to think of before. But he's Max Ren, and he's, like, the person that's putting on all these weird, you know, television programming on this channel. And you're kind of wondering, like, is he even on this show right now, talking to. Talking to the host? And is she really sitting there and is like, how long has he been hallucinating all of this stuff? So just the whole movie is such a trip. I love pretty much everything Cronenberg does is amazing. But that one in particular just really, it really, like, rocked my world the first time I saw it, and I've just kind of re watched it over and over and over again as the years have gone on.
00:48:05.680 - 00:48:19.520, Speaker B: There's so much being said in it about, like, where the world would go in terms of social media and representation and identity and, you know, misunderstandings, and there's a lot to chew on, I think.
00:48:19.712 - 00:48:37.930, Speaker A: I mean, it kind of brings up a question that's been lined at the back of my head for the last hour here, which is like, what are you trying to do as an artist? I mean, do you have a sense of what it is, or are you kind of just, you know, playing with aesthetics, pushing things, or. I don't know. Is that even a fair question from your perspective?
00:48:38.042 - 00:48:54.814, Speaker B: Just trying to have fun, mainly trying to have fun. And I, you know, I think eventually down the road, maybe there will be a thread that runs through all of it that kind of connects it all. I'm still trying to get there. I feel like I'm always trying to.
00:48:54.894 - 00:48:56.998, Speaker A: I would say that thread's already kind of there.
00:48:57.086 - 00:49:26.388, Speaker B: Oh, thank you. I mean, yeah, it's so weird to, like, trying to evaluate your own. I would rather come on here and just talk for an hour about the artists that, like, inspire me rather than talk about my own stuff because I, you know, I'm looking at it with my own eyes and, you know, I don't really know. The way that it's received is really cool. It's like, it's, like, really, like, flattering and humbling that so many people have been such great supports and that people are into, you know, kind of these things that I'm making.
00:49:26.476 - 00:49:42.596, Speaker A: So you've definitely stumbled on something and actually, very quickly before we go to our next question here, not sack three, as we start to wrap up. But there's no rush, unless Hasdrubal needs to go here. But who are your biggest influences, Hasdrubal.
00:49:42.700 - 00:49:46.662, Speaker B: In terms of the blockchain or just visual arts?
00:49:46.718 - 00:49:49.886, Speaker A: But you can, you know, feel free to run away with that question in.
00:49:49.910 - 00:50:33.610, Speaker B: Whatever direction you want in the traditional arts, I would say, you know, I went and saw the Egon Schiele Leopold collection at MOMA and that, like, totally changed my life. It was just amazing to see his work in person. He was definitely an early inspiration, especially at the time, because I was doing a lot of figure drawing and a lot of figure painting and then lots of, lots of cinema directors. And, you know, I love, I love Kirstami. Kirstami's films are just like, they're like poetry to me. Just like such a beautiful vision, you know, Jordarowski, Cronenberg, you know, I kind of like everything. I don't really care for minimalism too much, but, you know, it's all right.
00:50:33.610 - 00:51:01.308, Speaker B: I don't mind it. There's tons of people and like, you know, a lot of outsider artists, too. I just love outsider art. It just, it's just something that really, like, inspires me and blows my mind. There's a woman named Susan. Hopefully I don't ruin, ruin the pronunciation, but it's Susan tucketturing king. And I believe she's in New Zealand, or was in New Zealand.
00:51:01.308 - 00:51:44.016, Speaker B: She was a phonic and just stopped talking for like years and only communicated through art. And her work is just like, incredible. It's like Disney characters and stuff, but like, she draws it through her lens and she's on the spectrum for sure. And just the way she interprets these kind of traditional images or images that have been in the cultural ether for a while, it's just like incredible. Her color, the way that she composes them, they're just off, but they're like beautiful to me. I love her work a lot. And then in terms of nfts, there's so many amazing artists and antezos.
00:51:44.016 - 00:52:21.572, Speaker B: I mean, I know there's a lot of amazing people on ETH, too. I'm not really in the ETH kind of chain as much as I am antezos, but it's just endless. I mean, I could probably give you 100 artists from tezos that are blowing my mind all the time, but off the top of my head, you know, haydiye rocket, make it galena, obviously. Santiago and human kernel. I love the animations that little cakes does. Sabato's deluxe paint stuff is amazing. Round Shades was one of the first artists that I really gravitated towards.
00:52:21.572 - 00:52:48.234, Speaker B: Ratcloak. Ugore. Ugore stuff is like so rad. And uh, you know, I have a heavy heart. I have a heavy heart for those dudes because, you know, they're not around as much anymore. But when I first started, you know, the waffles stuff, I was, you know, chatting with them a lot and they were like super supportive and I just, I love those guys. Sbato.
00:52:48.234 - 00:53:22.376, Speaker B: There's, it's like I could really go on J and K. Kurt Hussle. Yeah, there's this so, and then, and then from all, like, just all these different styles, like, and all these different, all these different mediums like you do every day. It's like a new adventure. You just see something every single day on tezos and you're like, wow, like, I can't even believe, I can't even believe I'm like this, like lucky to be alive at this point in time where I'm seeing all of this stuff happen, like in real time. It's just, it's mind blowing. I love it.
00:53:22.440 - 00:53:45.456, Speaker A: It's a special time, for sure. Yeah, it makes me think of like, it's like chancing upon an art scene, like a real legitimate art scene. And this time it's based on the Internet, so it's its own thing. Yeah, I mean, I share that excitement with you. And we have another speaker here, notsack three. Welcome to the show where you call it from. And do you have a question for Hez drubal? Yeah, thanks for the space, man.
00:53:45.480 - 00:53:47.352, Speaker B: I appreciate it. Mister Walfield.
00:53:47.448 - 00:53:52.472, Speaker A: Yeah, I have a question. You kind of touched on it pokebelly about the direction as an artist, I.
00:53:52.488 - 00:53:59.280, Speaker B: Guess, what do you see as the future or how this space evolves with digital art?
00:53:59.392 - 00:54:12.362, Speaker A: And I guess with you too as an artist. But as we go further and as we keep innovating with the digital arts and maybe present it better than just I'm thinking like online galleries versus in real.
00:54:12.418 - 00:54:13.650, Speaker B: And yeah, what do you think the.
00:54:13.682 - 00:54:17.874, Speaker A: Future of digital art or this space is, or what do you envision?
00:54:17.994 - 00:55:05.416, Speaker B: You know, I think at some point someone's going to come up with the idea to do a gallery space where they reach out to collectors and say, you know, I want to use this piece that you collected and you know, we're going to have, maybe it'd be like a, like a dow or a staking claim. I'm not really sure how what it would really look like. But I think at some point, like, there's going to be, like, a real reward for collectors in the way that gallery spaces are set up online. And obviously, it'll kind of. Maybe. It'll maybe follow the same model of traditional gallery spaces. But I, you know, I'm kind of shocked that that hasn't really come about yet, or at least I'm not aware of it, but I would see that happening sometime in the future.
00:55:05.416 - 00:55:26.272, Speaker B: I don't know. I am a pretty avid collector. I've got about nine wallets that I collect on. Some of them are, you know, anonymous, and then some of them are on my different accounts. But I love collecting. I mean, that was what got me into nfts. Well, actually, I caught my finger really bad while doing woodworking, and that's actually what got me into nfts.
00:55:26.272 - 00:56:01.556, Speaker B: I sliced a tendon on my. My left hand and couldn't. I was, like, super into doing spoon carving and bowl carving for a while, and I couldn't do that anymore. And I just started, you know, hearing about nfts and, you know, I was doing a little bit of degen, you know, coin stuff that never really paid well, actually, it kind of paid off. Here's a funny story. I made a pretty good return on Shib. I was smoking hash with a friend, and I saw a thread on, on four chan biz about Sheba being the next doge, and I thought that that was too funny to pass up.
00:56:01.556 - 00:56:25.768, Speaker B: And I bought, like, I don't know, 70 million shib for, like, a dollar just because I thought it would be funny. And then it ended up being, like. It ended up actually, like, mooning. And I used almost all of that to start collecting on tezos. That was how I got started. Probably too much information, but I love that story.
00:56:25.856 - 00:56:32.904, Speaker A: I was a shib owner, too, but I was much later than you, so I only did. What did that turn into? Like a. Like a thousand x or.
00:56:33.024 - 00:56:35.504, Speaker B: Oh, geez, it was like.
00:56:35.584 - 00:56:38.120, Speaker A: Was that $10,000 you were left with at the end of it?
00:56:38.152 - 00:57:01.988, Speaker B: No, no, it wasn't. It wasn't that much, but it was a really good return, considering I put, like, I literally spent, like, a dollar 26 on it. I think the gas. The gas was $19, and I spent $1.26 or something like that, and I got just a ton of it. And, you know, I've been thinking about that, too, a lot in terms of value and distribution. That's.
00:57:01.988 - 00:57:59.298, Speaker B: And Twitter. Like, I feel like there's other ways of all of this stuff feels very performative in a way. And I know that it drives some people crazy that, like, I'll like, list stuff for like 0.23 tezos or whatever, like randomly, or I'll throw free pieces at people and then just auction off one copy. But I want to play around with those things because I kind of see them all as being connected and just kind of like messing with the dynamics of value or messing with the dynamics of distribution. And how does that kind of play into the way that this technology is developing as well? I don't think it's just like making images and having it. Having it mirror what's been going on in the traditional art world because that's, you know, established, but maybe having fun with, like some of those other ways of looking at it, be it gallery space or distribution or value or airdrops or whatever.
00:57:59.298 - 00:58:01.442, Speaker B: I think there's a lot to think about.
00:58:01.578 - 00:58:25.582, Speaker A: Absolutely. I mean, it brings exactly like, I love how you do that and you play with it more than most, but I think you bring up a really interesting point, which is, in a sense, the conceptual opportunity with this kind of newer, different kind of market, digital market, NFT market, crypto. Any plans to mint on ETH, or are you sort of happy to stay on tezos? Any thoughts on that?
00:58:25.718 - 00:59:06.026, Speaker B: Yeah, well, actually. So the ultra sadism piece was actually supposed to be my ETH. Genesis. La Jogio invited me to be part of the artists of today, and I, you know, the compression on it, it's funny, it had the background of the man batter piece with the foreground of the ultra sadism piece with the person brushing their teeth. And just the compression on it when I made it into a gif was so bad that I, like, didn't want to submit it because, I don't know, I guess there's a lot. There's of kind of a lot riding on, you know, doing a genesis on ETH. Maybe I'm making it too, too complicated.
00:59:06.090 - 00:59:28.544, Speaker A: I think a lot of people feel that way. I was surprised to learn that, actually, when I first came across that idea. When I started, basically, I actually thought it was almost kind of. Almost kind of lame, but I've kind of embraced it now, and I kind of think it's cool now. But when I started, I was like, what's with this genesis thing? Like, what difference does that make, you know? But it's actually pretty cool. It's like, issue number one of amazing spider man.
00:59:29.604 - 01:00:01.338, Speaker B: Well, and then, like, I've seen, like, comments from some of, like, the bigger ETH collectors with their blue check marks and stuff, and they'll be like, is this 4k resolution? Or whatever? And I'm like, oh, these people will not dig my stuff at all. Like, no fidelity resolution. But, yeah, eventually. I mean, it would be cool. I don't really have any plans at the moment. I guess if there's another artist today, one, I'll probably submit one because I felt bad. I felt kind of bad about that with Giorgio because he's such a nice dude.
01:00:01.466 - 01:00:07.546, Speaker A: He is. We had him on spaces, and he loves your work. He was the guy who I got in that auction battle with.
01:00:07.610 - 01:00:26.768, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, that was great, guy. Yeah. I actually got, like, really teared up when that was going down. It was wild. Little cakes was, was, you know, messaging me as it was happening. And she was like, following wallets, and she's like, oh, they're moving. They're canceling offers.
01:00:26.768 - 01:00:32.992, Speaker B: And I was like, there's no way this is going to go above 200. And then it just kept going. Going. Yeah.
01:00:33.168 - 01:00:59.984, Speaker A: That was probably the most I've spent, like, I think I spent on a die with the most likes. I mean, that went for, like, 700 tazos, I think, or 750 tazos. Yeah. And it kind of becomes like, I've never been in an auction battle like that before. And it becomes this weird ego thing. It's almost kind of a dark experience somewhat, because you're like, I have to win. And you're not sure at what point it starts being about the work or about you winning.
01:00:59.984 - 01:01:15.164, Speaker A: So, yeah, so I was like, nah, after that, I was like, I don't need to do too many more auctions. I was thrilled to have that piece, though. Like, it is like Lego Joe says, it's one of your best works. And I kind of agree. Like, it's kind of like a little masterpiece there and maybe.
01:01:15.584 - 01:01:35.408, Speaker B: Yeah, it's fantastic. That one. Yeah, that, and that one went through a lot of revisions. I almost didn't minute. You know, just having a lot of second, a lot of, a lot of doubts about it, a lot of second guesses. And then I just, I don't know, I can't. I got the title from a fall song, and I was listening to that song and I was just like, I'm just gonna minute, whatever.
01:01:35.408 - 01:02:00.122, Speaker B: We'll just see what happens. And that was cool. But I hear you on the auctions, too. I just got in a mini, won a mini auction battle over a Kazuhiro piece the other day with illusional, and that was fun. But, you know, I definitely he spared me. I had a little bit more money in my wallet, but they backed out of it. So I ended up with this really, really rad Kazuhiro piece.
01:02:00.298 - 01:02:38.266, Speaker A: Very cool. Well, as we wrap up here, does anybody have any questions for Hasdrubal? Now is your chance to ask them. Rune tune, do you have any final thoughts here as we're wrapping up? Yeah, it's a thought that kind of came to me, is looking at your work. I was talking about the colors earlier, and it reminds me of playing Super Nintendo games in, like, the nineties and how part of me was literally just addicted to, like, having those colors flash in front of my eyes for several hours over, you know, more so than just playing a game. And it reminds me of that.
01:02:38.410 - 01:02:48.770, Speaker B: I like it. That's. That's a rad way to put it. I played a lot of Nintendo when I was, you know, younger, and I actually saw the Mario movie the other day. It was good. Oh, the Mario. Yeah, the new Mario movie.
01:02:48.770 - 01:02:56.074, Speaker B: It was pretty good. There was a really sick, like, Mario Kart scene in it, and I really dug that part. There was a rainbow road and everything. It was great.
01:02:56.234 - 01:02:57.754, Speaker A: Oh, don't spoil it for me.
01:02:57.834 - 01:03:15.724, Speaker B: Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. I'm joking. I'm joking. I should say that since this is streaming on Tinder, there's some red flags that people should look out for when they're. When they're dating. Like, a big red flag for me is if that person owns a Gilla monster.
01:03:15.884 - 01:03:18.940, Speaker A: And how can you tell, you know, from their profile?
01:03:19.092 - 01:03:32.834, Speaker B: Okay, very good. That didn't. That didn't land the way I imagined it would land. Yeah, it was worth it. It was worth a shot. I feel like I have to kind of try to be funny. You know, you got to take sometimes, but, you know, it's all about risk.
01:03:32.834 - 01:03:34.286, Speaker B: Maybe that one didn't work.
01:03:34.430 - 01:03:39.286, Speaker A: Santiago, save us here. You on stage. We're just wrapping up here.
01:03:39.350 - 01:03:41.110, Speaker B: Yeah, he's much fun than I am.
01:03:41.182 - 01:03:45.594, Speaker F: I have a question, and it is, when are the needs back?
01:03:46.614 - 01:04:09.226, Speaker B: All right. Yeah. So that actually took kind of an interesting development. Save. My emulator stopped working, and I purchased an actual physical copy of Mario paint. And now I'm waiting for the little mouse pad and the mouse to arrive. And I think I'm going to do the last six.
01:04:09.226 - 01:04:19.210, Speaker B: I think. I think I had six left that were Mario paint. I'm going to try and do it with the actual Mario paint with a mouse. So they might turn out better than my turn at worse. I'm not totally sure.
01:04:19.282 - 01:04:33.830, Speaker A: I was wondering that if you're using an emulator or not. I just assumed you were. Can you export to, you know, I guess you don't even know because you don't have it yet, but can you export a JPEG, do you know, from Mario paint? Like the actual Mario paint with exporting?
01:04:33.862 - 01:04:48.534, Speaker B: I'm not totally sure. I haven't played Mario paint in probably, I don't know, 15 years. So I don't know. I'll find it really soon. And I'm actually trying to get ahold of another one. I can't remember. It's called Vtech Painter or something like that.
01:04:48.534 - 01:04:51.982, Speaker B: And it looks really crappy, but look really awesome.
01:04:52.118 - 01:04:53.566, Speaker A: Yeah. I have a feeling you might do.
01:04:53.590 - 01:05:01.710, Speaker B: Some neats with that as well. You know, I'm just kind of. The neats are so kind of casual in terms of how they roll.
