00:00:03.040 - 00:00:32.354, Speaker A: The hour is getting late, ladies and gentlemen, and everybody, as the storm clouds continue to come towards us. So brace yourselves. We're gonna run through this episode as usual. It's gallery weekend here, too. So maybe I'll try and get some pictures, maybe post them on the stories on Instagram. So that is where you can get the inside track if I go out, and I'm sure I will. Artist Journal, April 27, 2023, broadcasting from Innerspace in Berlin, Germany.
00:00:32.354 - 00:01:10.468, Speaker A: My name is Adrian Pokebelli, and welcome back. So here is Tornado Rodriguez, also known as Tornado Rodriguez, who I had the pleasure of meeting yesterday on yesterday's spaces with Flora Marquez. And I was so delighted with how that show went. So anyways, it is edited and it is on the YouTube, so you can listen to the very polished version, as polished as it gets, anyway, with Twitter spaces. That is on YouTube. Maybe some of you saw that. So anyways, so for those that listened and that attended, first of all, thank you.
00:01:10.468 - 00:01:48.204, Speaker A: And so you might have heard tornado or tornado on the program. And so this is, so I looked it up and I was like, wow, this is great. And it just goes to show, you know, to me, it's sort of like, just because I don't show the work doesn't mean I know about it, you know? And so just so people know that because I saw this and I was like, this is great. I'd love to have this, you know, just this is a kind of artist I'd love to show in the, you know, illustration section, so to speak. You know, the hard edged lines here. And it also fits in. So, yeah, all to say that, and it also fits into something.
00:01:48.204 - 00:03:01.666, Speaker A: As I was drinking my coffee and looking at this, it reminds me of this almost genre that's in my mind that I have called contemporary illustration. And there are a few illustrators out there that seem to be presenting the life of modern life or contemporary life, our lives, you know, and here is just, you know, are the lives of the world, you know, and this, to me, this is not some illustration. This isn't a portrayal of something from, you know, the 1950s, right? This is like a, this could be today in some apartment somewhere, you know, someone, you know, playing video games there. And there you have the little nugget, the plants here and everything. I think this came out on April 20. So a 420 homage here with some awesome dithering here by Tornado Rodriguez, who's a good friend of Flora Marquez. And one of the great things about that episode yesterday is they've talked, I think they've shared WhatsApp audio, they were saying, but they've never actually met each other in person.
00:03:01.666 - 00:03:45.384, Speaker A: But Tornado, also known as Tornado, is who got Flora onto object and saying, you got to do this NfT thing or onto tezos, actually, I should say not an object on tezos on hand, I believe. So. Anyways, I thought it was a really beautiful work that came out just a few days ago, so why not start with this? And I really like this, the start game, one player, two player, and the dithering and everything. So there are other artists that do this, like contemporary illustration. Let's just actually like Astra and maybe that's with a four. I don't know if I'm going to be able to think of this on the spot. There it is.
00:03:45.384 - 00:04:09.264, Speaker A: This is what I'm talking about. And you could even say Adelia to a certain degree. But let me just show you exactly what I'm talking about here. These are some wonderful works. You see the Diet Coke here. And what's funny is actually astrakarma actually will do retro, you know, retro phone here. This is a beautiful work.
00:04:09.264 - 00:04:36.218, Speaker A: Tough love. And the tezos, for tezos. Like that is really brilliant playing off of that Nakia. And then we'll go back to Tornado in a second here. Kind of like tornado better as a pronunciation. But just, you know, these here, I mean, again, like, to me, this is like what I would be tempted to call contemporary illustration. You see the supreme sticker, the sega Genesis sticker.
00:04:36.218 - 00:05:00.738, Speaker A: Like, even with the retro Rubik's cube and the guitar, this could just be like. I mean, couldn't these just hang together? You know that work we're looking at by tornado, which isometric night of video games. Let me just load it back up here. And do we have any. So this is on Solana. The work is a remake of my Solana genesis. An evening of video games.
00:05:00.738 - 00:05:24.864, Speaker A: Happy 420 to all have a very chillaxing and fun filled the year. So that is super fun. So always a new discovery around every corner here, you can buy this for a mere $9. It is an addition of 18. So that is cool on Solana. And yeah, so couldn't you just see these hanging in the same room? I mean, it's almost the same content here. So anyways, just contemporary illustration.
00:05:24.864 - 00:06:10.124, Speaker A: I kind of see it over and over where it's actually bizarrely surprisingly, it's the illustrators that seem to be doing this kinda, that really seem to be zeroing in on this, just kind of portraits of our everyday lives. And so that is where that kinda genre, at least in my head, came from. And here's some other work by tornado. So you can see it's got a real kind of, it reminds me of zap comics a little bit. Kind of that counterculture, you know, illustration, comic art almost from the 1960s, a la crumb and all that whole crew out of zap comics. Big shout out to Rada on that one. And even in the theme, in the content as well, right? It doesn't just scream comics.
00:06:10.124 - 00:06:34.224, Speaker A: C O M I X. Illustrator from Argentina with an eye for detail. Beautifully put. Thank you, everybody who collected intermittent fasting. It was very fun to put out a new work and just, it was waking up at 05:00 a.m., actually yesterday that I finished three works, and they were all just kind of sitting there. So we discussed that a lot yesterday, too.
00:06:34.224 - 00:07:06.772, Speaker A: There's a lot of talk about just self discipline and everything, which was very interesting and helpful as an artist. And I happened to wake up at five yesterday, and I just got so much done because, you know, at five, you don't really feel like doing anything else other you feel like doing art because you actually have time. So anyways, thank you for everybody picking it up. It was at five tezos and sold out in a couple of hours here, maybe three or 4 hours. And thank you to everybody for picking one up. A real nice crowd here. So that warms my heart here.
00:07:06.772 - 00:08:03.114, Speaker A: And this is from a promoted stories series that really, that was my first show in Berlin, actually called promoted stories, and that was at Fada Morgana, which actually just shut down. And anyway, so this theme, these kind of, you know, what I love about them, very quickly, why I portray these things and why I find them fascinating, because, of course, these are the ads that you find kind of the crass in bad taste ads that you often find at the bottom of news articles. And what I love about them is they're kind of, they're, they, they work because a lot of people click on them like they're designed for mass clicking on, right. Like they're, they kind of hit human. They kind of, they're almost, like, predatory on the dark side of human nature to a certain degree. And so, and that's why they work, one could argue. So I always see these as kind of back to this qualitative science idea.
00:08:03.114 - 00:08:47.974, Speaker A: I see these as clues of human nature. When you see, oh, okay, there's this ad, so it must be working because it's part of this, you know, Taboola ad spend that they're putting out this stuff is designed, you know, in bad taste oftentimes to sell and to just get people's interest. So you see kind of a portrait of human nature to a certain degree. You can piece together from these promoted stories that you find at the bottom of news articles. And they're still here. I mean, I started this in 2016, and it's 2023. So again, just the fact that they're still here, I was expecting them to disappear, but they don't.
00:08:47.974 - 00:09:32.594, Speaker A: So I also find that interesting. So that is kind of part of the conceptual background. So again, of that series, thank you again, everybody who showed up, and Flora Marquez and Runetune, especially as usual. Again, the edited version is on Spotify and YouTube, and I also have the Spotify links at the bottom of the description now. And also there's been a lot of kind of, I guess, just interviews and public speaking, I guess this week, Michella Colonna, I was on his podcast and he interviewed me, and so I think that's going to be out right away. Had a great conversation with artist journal host and digital artist Pokebelly this morning on Scrapbook podcast. So that is what it's called.
00:09:32.594 - 00:10:13.230, Speaker A: And so a lot of you will know, Michella, and he's a collector and just overall, just kind, kind of, of, you know, fan of a lot of the art that's coming out on the scene and commenting. I think he might have interviewed Lily Illo, so it's a cool podcast to check out. So anyways, looking forward to that coming out. That was a lot of fun. We went for 90 minutes, a little more, actually. This was a super interesting comment from RADA, and this was another retro Manny was celebrating his one year anniversary and managed to get a lot of pixel artists because retro Manny loves pixel art. So we had this space here, and we had so many great pixel artists come in.
00:10:13.230 - 00:10:38.474, Speaker A: I was almost wanting to call it like, it's like a historic union of pixel artists. And Rata was in on there, too. And go, go. Litis was in the crowd and ratto was in the crowd. I love many things about pixel art. This is a very interesting comment, and he's made it before, but I think he made it extra interesting this time. One of those is that you can scale it up with no limits, making it very relevant for digital art that may require much more resolution in the future.
00:10:38.474 - 00:11:22.270, Speaker A: And I think this is, I never thought of it that way. And it kind of put a new spin on that, you know, pixel art, sketchbook or whatever, like, and just working with kind of these square brushes because working with a square brush or whatever you're doing, that can all be scaled up infinitely. That was a really interesting point that as the resolutions increase, you'll be able to make these as large as you need. So a really interesting comment from RADA. More about pixel art in this awesome space by pokebelly colleagues and friends. So yeah, anyways, that was a lot of fun. It's been a busy week and it was just a ton of fun.
00:11:22.270 - 00:12:07.094, Speaker A: And here is the cyberpixel anniversary collection so you can check it out on object here and you can see you have a lot of familiar faces, pixel Quest Retro Manny brave 196 pixels light mech TXT Pixel Dreams Stalamere Notorious man, XTz, Retro Mani and it was great. I mean it was people from all over the world, from Poland to Nigeria to Indonesia, you know, it was really cool. So anyways, that was a lot of fun and thank you again for the invite. Retro Manny, thank you for the comments. Nothing too, just a lot of just good vibes. Glad subscribing to this from Stalka. Great to hear from you.
00:12:07.094 - 00:12:32.750, Speaker A: Amazing discoveries every time and it's my lunchtime everyday video go. So anyways, thanks for the good vibes everyone all round. No big debates in that comment section there. This was cool. Just a cool tribute here, or a cool kind of, whatever you want to call it, homage. This was my first thoughts when I was spotlighted on pokebelly show. WTF for the first time.
00:12:32.750 - 00:13:12.594, Speaker A: Yesterday was the second time and I'm grateful. So anyways, I just wanted to show the work by Zed N e or n a, if I'm pronouncing that right. And anyway, I thought it was just a fun work play on the show there. Thank you for that. Wasteman Gold Minevich so we were talking about the work that waste man Gold Minevitch did that was kind of reminded me a little bit of has dribble waffle. It looked like kind of older, you know, Mario paint and all this like kids video games sort of thing, which was totally fine from my perspective. Thanks for showing the piece, Adrian.
00:13:12.594 - 00:13:38.246, Speaker A: Yeah, it did turn out quite wafflesy, the piece. And I think of waffles as like auto dicks of digital art. Interesting way of perspective of the digital art scene. And of course as an inspiration, I crib everything, by the way, and it's a central tenet of my manifesto. So I think crib is like borrow here it is to steal or appropriate. Yeah, so anyways, and it wasn't meant as a criticism. I actually thought it was just really cool.
00:13:38.246 - 00:14:01.814, Speaker A: And as I wrote in a comment, nothing wrong with being influenced. So. Yeah, but I thought that was a really. Yeah, I think, like hasdrubal waffles, good work is really wearing well with time, isn't it? So some agreement there, little cakes. Also, thanks for the shout out. I do make stuff, but not as much as I would like to. So often it's random births here, here and there.
00:14:01.814 - 00:14:24.746, Speaker A: This is the last series I worked on on Twitter. Like you say, we get inspired and feed off of each other. That is the energy to keep going, so. Exactly. And I kind of want to put this in relation to Wasteman's comment there, too. And here's little cakes with custom wearables and portraits of Tazo's friends. So just a very cool kind of fun collection, I think.
00:14:24.746 - 00:14:54.658, Speaker A: I remember seeing this one and combining, you know, just. I mean, it's pretty fun just putting some painted on or collaged on or photoshopped on clothing onto friends. So all having fun over here. And also, finally, Mikey Delacrem, who talked about his process a little bit, which was quite interesting. And he's also using blend. So let me show you what Mikey was doing here. I'll briefly explain the process for this one.
00:14:54.658 - 00:15:23.766, Speaker A: For most of my recent pieces, I've solely used the blend function in mid journey. And I keep coming back to that blend function, which is amazing, which is like a hip hop sampler. I agree. And it's almost more. It's almost like processing, because it's like taking two samples and then you can start to make a new sound. There's almost like synthesis there. Took a painting by Horace Pippen and made a minor edit for aesthetics.
00:15:23.766 - 00:15:52.810, Speaker A: Removed the fox. So I think. So this is what Mikey did, I believe, and I'm not sure if he did that in mid journey or if he did it manually. Then I blended it. So first he did it manually, I believe removing the fox, which is another fun way to work. I mean, I've done this with, like, let's say you getting Rauschenberg or Basquit. They have these beautiful brush strokes, right? But sometimes you don't want other stuff.
00:15:52.810 - 00:16:39.638, Speaker A: So you literally get your, you know, your digital brush out and you start ironing it out and just keep the stuff you want back to this visual hip hop idea, which is actually a very, you know, you know, important concept, which I haven't seen too much about, I have to admit. Then I blended it with a previous piece I made, which itself is a blend from several ingredients. So here's the previous piece, and I remember this piece. I usually have to go through many upscales and variations until I get the output I am looking for. I wanted this one to have a lone figure. Luckily, the AI gods remove them for me. So then, and then finally so and so here.
00:16:39.638 - 00:17:02.870, Speaker A: So I think this is what he's talking about, where there's only one person in the. In the image that was blended in. So it kind of worked out. So with the AI and just doing a lot of variations, I started all off by focusing on a feeling or vibe. Last week, there was an overall down vibe, and it almost felt like I. I was the last collector still collecting. I often get old songs stuck in my head.
00:17:02.870 - 00:17:26.900, Speaker A: This was last week's song, Allman Brothers band. No one to run with. So anyways, yeah, Mikey's out there still collecting, and it was great selling some work. I was able to pick up some works I was looking at. So anyways, shout out to Mikey and wasteman and little cakes and everybody. Thank you for the comments. So we're back to the pen plotters.
00:17:26.900 - 00:17:48.444, Speaker A: Check this out. Art matter. And we're back to art matter. Imagine you could curate an entire group exhibition. Mattered by us. Which artists would you choose? So just some more images, because I think I continue to be totally fascinated by this because it's such a great solution for digital artists. Right.
00:17:48.444 - 00:18:25.474, Speaker A: Whether you're doing pixel art or whether you're doing, you know, imagine that illustration by Tornado Rodriguez at the start of this show, and then you put it in here, right? Or you. And you put some nice colored paper like this, like Zancane did. So, I mean, and you gotta love probably the speed that it works with here. And so anyways, I mean, it's just incredibly exciting. So I'm gonna have to find where I can actually do this. I'm sure there must be somewhere in Berlin I can do this. Maybe you can buy some of these things, but, I mean, they must be expensive.
00:18:25.474 - 00:18:40.266, Speaker A: I don't know. Yeah. So don't know if anybody has any information on that, but this is just. It's just too tantalizing. And this was a very interesting comment, too, on the plotters. Working physically changes your creative approach. So true.
00:18:40.266 - 00:19:13.760, Speaker A: Even we're discussing yesterday with Flora. You know, how does having an iPad change your approach? And she even mentioned the portability, which is a theme that we've discussed here. So the tools that you work with, the mediums that you work with, change your work, because all of a sudden, you have to come up with different solutions and you have different problems. And so let's just look at this. So much more thought and weight behind every action. This may be the start of something new. So this is interesting too.
00:19:13.760 - 00:20:11.764, Speaker A: And you know, Flora, just to bring it back, she was lamenting almost the undo and saying how, you know how she doesn't like undo, right? Because, and I think Stewart is kind of pointing out a similar aspect or, you know, a similar idea here, analogous, that when you're working physically, you can't just press undo. So you have to have way more thought and weight behind every action. This may be the start of something new. And here it is. Maybe you can hear that almost sounds like a video game. And you know what else I love about this, and let me actually mute this. What else I love about this is speaking of weight, I mean, the marks that this machine is making is so different from the marks that you or I might make because we might have different pressure.
00:20:11.764 - 00:20:40.018, Speaker A: And it seems here like the pressure is pretty uniform. So it's going to create its own vibe. And you see like the randomness in here, there's no fixing. We might go, oh, I don't want that ink to collect over here. But with the machine, you just have to let it go. So you actually get a nice kind of random thing going. So anyways, I'm just kind of all over these plotters and here's a different kind of variation on the plotters.
00:20:40.018 - 00:21:01.986, Speaker A: Laser cutting. Now you can do that here in Berlin. I've never tried it. I thought it was more for making stencils, like with paper or whatnot. But look at this laser cutting, the first of 31 aluminum panels. So I didn't realize that laser cutting was that strong. I guess it makes sense for an upcoming outdoor wall sculpture.
00:21:01.986 - 00:21:41.384, Speaker A: Until now, it was just a vector drawing. It's so satisfying to see it materialize. So I think, you know, the takeaway here as we look at this, you know, plotter business is we in, you know, to voice an opinion and feel free to disagree. I think we're totally crazy to not take advantage of this kind of, this kind of technology because it looks great, at least what we're seeing with the pen plotters there. And this, I mean, it's in progress. So we haven't really seen how this is going to turn out. But all to say, I think this is something that we really have to consider.
00:21:41.384 - 00:22:10.860, Speaker A: Here's just another physical manifestation of what's a totally digital work. I mean, you might recognize this artist, right? This is psycho, also known as score. And we've looked at several of score's works and so you would think that's an impossible work to make physical. But look at this solution. GMGN Kirakira card again. I will bring it to BrT moments exhibition. The QR code is the webpage about bright girls.
00:22:10.860 - 00:22:46.014, Speaker A: Hope this is nice souvenir for you. So check this out. So what an interesting solution. It is almost GIF like in the way that it has this, you know, this reflective layer and it does create movement. Like another really interesting solution here. So just very interesting solution which kind of creates an analogous effect, we could argue, continuing on. And finally, Runtun mentioned these in a space a few weeks ago.
00:22:46.014 - 00:23:10.238, Speaker A: Here is these infinite object frames. And you see they have these kind of huge, like thick. I most imagine it's glass or probably Mylar, actually terraniums one to 30 by Rodel Warner gathered into a 30 minutes loop on a large infinite object screen. So excited to show them these ways. So here it is. I wonder how much these costs. And it's not so thick.
00:23:10.238 - 00:23:54.094, Speaker A: And it looks actually pretty practical in the way that you can screw it all together and then probably unscrew it and then just change the work or whatever the case is. I guess you can probably plug it in in the back. Maybe there's a wire there, right? So just kind of an interesting, you know, maybe a window of some kind into the future, into how works could be displayed. And it looks great, you know. So anyways, 30 minutes loop on this bitcoin ordinals front. I thought this was worth something else we should be considering, or I. It am considering Leonidas, a popular crypto look, NFT historian ordinals collector.
00:23:54.094 - 00:24:48.334, Speaker A: It's looking like BRC 20, which is the bitcoin coin or what would you call that? The bitcoin version of the ERC 20 token. The BRC 20 meme coins will onboard the next wave of people to ordinals. So there are meme coins on Brazil on bitcoin, if you can believe that, and as well as these ordinals, which are kind of like the equivalent of NFTs and once onboarded to an ordinal compatible wallet, people are going to want to explore more than just BRC 20. In other words, more than just the meme coins. They will want to have an ordinal PFP. So in other words, like NFT PFP on bitcoin and to collect art on bitcoin as well. So maybe this last part is the most important to collect art on bitcoin as well.
00:24:48.334 - 00:25:29.454, Speaker A: So again, you know what this reminds me of? This reminds me when nfTs, like the bored apes and all that first came out and a lot of us, including myself, were sort of like, meh, I'm not sure what to think of this. And then took four months, five months to kind of figure it out. Well, this is what this ordinal stuff reminds me of, which is, in crypto, it really pays to be fast. And if you're, you know, so there's a real big payoff sometimes if you kind of figure things out quickly. And so. And what's really interesting about crypto is there always seems to be another opportunity, which is also kind of awesome. The ones you miss.
00:25:29.454 - 00:25:57.386, Speaker A: So anyways, this just interesting and important thought and just a couple of more kind of on the news side of things. Dina Changing, who helped curate the Sotheby's glitch beyond binary, has done a Tes vending machine takeover and it sounds like it's gone very well. I think it's sabato was. Yeah, here it is. My Tes vending machine takeover sold out in 2 hours. And there's a sabato piece on the front. We'll look at it in a second.
00:25:57.386 - 00:26:31.004, Speaker A: But I'm back on Thursday for round two. Get ready for more gems. So the TeS vending machine has persisted here and it really is kind of becoming this tempting to call it an institution of sorts within this ecosystem. So that is totally impressive. It was really, I think this was a lesson in persistence. Flexosaurus Rex just kept at it. And so because I remember him being a little discouraged early on when the momentum seemed to taper a little bit after the initial launch.
00:26:31.004 - 00:27:10.712, Speaker A: Thanks for the massive show of support to everyone vendingnfts XYZ and here it is. So clearly a Sabato work here. And so that's also really cool what they're doing because remember, there's the oxine takeover. I guess this is the Dina Chang takeover, and she probably invited Sabato to make the machine. So anyways, perfect, perfect collaboration there. So very cool. And just on the market, remember, like, so there are like, there are success stories in a tough market and I want to show two or three here, look at this.
00:27:10.712 - 00:27:27.084, Speaker A: Ed Marolla. All the ETH pieces are sold and he's got a lot. This one too. Minting more soon. Tazos always on my mind. Lots available for cheap at object. And we're going to see here, he just minted another one on foundation at, again, 0.15
00:27:27.084 - 00:27:42.064, Speaker A: ETH. And it's already being bid on. So Ed is doing excellent on his foundation here. Like he's killing it. Okay. So he's making a lot of money. So this is cool and totally deservedly these beautiful works here.
00:27:42.064 - 00:28:07.202, Speaker A: So this is awesome. Rare, interesting comment here. And it kind of speaks to our whole theme of people showing older work and having quite a history sometimes as an artist before they came to NFTs. Good night. After hitting a few all time highs back to back, a few people thought I was an overnight success, especially if. Especially after I had to remake my Twitter. Right.
00:28:07.202 - 00:28:34.706, Speaker A: I mean, don't forget his Twitter got taken from him mysteriously. They missed the last two years grinding on here and the 14 before oil painting. Right. And so here are some examples of his oil painting in the 14 years before. Right. So cool concept here using the corner and here, a lot of figurative, kind of, you know, I guess figurative painting. Oil painting, too.
00:28:34.706 - 00:29:09.182, Speaker A: So to his point, a lot of people come here with a lot of experience and didn't just sort of make a few drawings and get procreate and, you know, get some nice brushes and run away with the show. So anyways, congrats to rare. And again, I love this kind of people showing old work to me. Again, it just kind of. It's this ongoing adding of credibility to this scene in a lot of ways, at least from my perspective. Rosatio with a cool work and again, doing well here. 0.042
00:29:09.182 - 00:29:29.040, Speaker A: ETH, seven minted so far. So, I mean, that's 0.28 ETH, a quarter of an ETH so far. There's five days to go. This will probably mint out. A reflection on the ephemeral nature of our digital existence by rosatio. So again, not bad for a, you know, pretty tough market.
00:29:29.040 - 00:29:52.784, Speaker A: Not bad at all. This was a beautiful work. And look, it's already being bid on. So it's kind of back to this whole, what, bear market, you know, like, it's very interesting. And I think this price point here of 0.150.14, I think that just on a. It's kind of like Walmart's $0.97
00:29:52.784 - 00:30:03.948, Speaker A: on a certain level. This just looks cheap enough when you're looking at that. So gray. How do you. Greco. Thank you. Greco.
00:30:03.948 - 00:30:26.696, Speaker A: Rando, a beautiful new painting here and bid on right away. Okay. And if he sells it for 0.14, I mean, that's still like $300, you know, like, that's pretty good. And it's a beautiful painting, too. The beautiful carpet here, you know, the detailed carpet contrasting with this really flat kind of floor. It's beautifully painted.
00:30:26.696 - 00:30:44.110, Speaker A: And I actually quite like. And the chair is beautiful. And I quite like the subject matter. Like the treatment. There's something kind of like precious about this older man, you know, hugging his dog. Seemingly a dog. Maybe something else.
00:30:44.110 - 00:31:11.008, Speaker A: Maybe it's a young. Maybe it's a calf, actually because we see a cow here and maybe a bull here. Maybe this is a calf because that doesn't look like a dog. But so kind of surreal here too. But there's something quite I find moving about this. And even, you know, Republic of Argentina and this guy's degree. Maybe it's his grandfather, you know, like, let's take a quick look from the land that I eat, from the land that I exploit.
00:31:11.008 - 00:31:22.616, Speaker A: Only I matter and my ambition. I mean, this is poetic work. And it's a massive file. So that is super cool. So congrats to Greco here. Very nice work. Auction ends in 11 hours.
00:31:22.616 - 00:31:47.012, Speaker A: Already has a bid. I mean, how long did it take? It took one day, not even 12 hours before a bid was placed. So big congrats. It's beautiful work board me social club. I think we missed this one a couple of weeks ago. I saw Tornado had retweeted it and I thought, you know what? This is a great work that I need to show that I haven't showed. This is by board me social club.
00:31:47.012 - 00:32:14.032, Speaker A: And just kind of a mysterious work. Cream chowder. Creamy chowder. And with the Campbell soup kind of a Warhol reference, we have to assume. And this, you know, tube that is almost like a snake or a demon of some kind with fire. So another surrealist work by board me social club. And then this kind of hulk like figure here with crazy eyes and interesting colors here.
00:32:14.032 - 00:32:35.636, Speaker A: And again, the surreal floor and the eyes dripping on it. This surreal scene, this surreal space. Eat more soup. Digital drawing by for five tezos. There's still four left. And a Teznown by Bizaya. Also like, you know, turkey and Argentina seem to have quite a few artists, don't they? Like, it's.
00:32:35.636 - 00:32:50.748, Speaker A: It's really. They definitely out. How would you put it? They. They punch above their weight is what you would say. They punch above their weight. So anyways, here's Bzaya with a tez noun. A nice variation on it.
00:32:50.748 - 00:33:16.530, Speaker A: And so anyways, with a Louis Vuitton hat, a bow and everything. And this is at auction for 50 tazos. And that is cool. These were shared by rinny Fish. And I highly recommend her instagram. And just look at these great works and I hadn't seen or heard of these artists. Anyways, I thought this was a really cool work that she shared.
00:33:16.530 - 00:33:38.054, Speaker A: Dana Kearley, cozy caterpillar. And I guess this is some other Dana work, other of Dana's work. So anyways, cool work here. And there's another one by Zoe Kim. Newt. Newt and some penguins, I thought just an interesting composition and just everything just kind of original. Something different here.
00:33:38.054 - 00:34:02.916, Speaker A: Looks like this person might have made even the COVID of a magazine. The soul leader. So anyways, just interesting. You know, there's so much talent out there, isn't there? You know, and like, let's look at the followers. I mean, so here's the super talented artist, you know, 1200 followers. Like, there's so much talent out here that's still being unrecognized. You know, I'm just discovering it myself.
00:34:02.916 - 00:34:19.816, Speaker A: And everything here is Ezra Eslin, instantly recognizable. Another bid, 0.77 ETH. So the art continues to move over here. And I mean, the bid started within 6 hours. 77 ETH. Not bad at all.
00:34:19.816 - 00:34:42.023, Speaker A: Let's look at the work. And so the classic fire the demon. So it's a hotel here above. So it's basically a street scene kind of at a 45 degree angle. I love the top here. And it's basically more mayhem. Kind of a bit of a, I almost want to say Halloween kind of feel with the witch and the ghost and everything and these demons.
00:34:42.023 - 00:35:02.283, Speaker A: New Babe store demons hotel. I guess that's probably the name of this. Is that the name hotel? So very cool. From Ezra Eslin, as always. And check this out. Debbie T is working on something. Purring intensifies new drop coming soon on Bueno NfT.
00:35:02.283 - 00:35:25.240, Speaker A: And I brought up their website. But here's the work first, and it's looking really nice. And again, this stuff just prints out so beautifully. So anyway, just kind of a heads up that, that Debbie t is working on something here. And it's just, again, instantly recognizable and very beautiful. Those little gradients, right? See the gradient in here? And I think it prints out beautifully. And it looks almost like this is printed.
00:35:25.240 - 00:35:53.044, Speaker A: It's hard to tell. So anyways, just really, really nice work. So many artists are graphic designers in this scene. And I think that's great because I worked in graphic design and the reason I wanted to get good at graphic design and I'm all right, you know, I'm not, I'm not the. It's a tough job. As we've mentioned in previous spaces, it's a thankless job because when it's perfect. People just go, yeah, of course this is how it should be.
00:35:53.044 - 00:36:24.430, Speaker A: And when it's 90%, all of a sudden all the criticisms come. So it's a tough job, but what's good about it is it forces you to learn things, to learn how to make things beautiful, which I would argue is not as easy as it sounds. Some people say that's easy. I actually disagree. As someone who has been in graphic design, it's actually quite difficult. And, you know, so anyways, I think wt may have a graphic design background, so here's the Bueno art. So I don't know too much about this.
00:36:24.430 - 00:36:52.862, Speaker A: I kind of looked it over and I still didn't know what this was. No code tools for digital collectible creators. A seamless creation experience for digital collectibles from generation to mint. So it looks here like this is, say, like the layer, almost like these PFP projects. And here you can say how often you want the sunglasses to show up. And here is the contract. Looks like it's on ethereum.
00:36:52.862 - 00:37:26.194, Speaker A: There are forms. So anyways, just kind of interesting. So let's see if Debbie T is going to put out another. A PFP project of sorts. PFP, or generative art project, I'm tempted to call it. So anyways, Flora Marquez with another beautiful work here, the daily drawing series. And apparently this is from Apuleius, is what we were learning from her uncle, who is a philosopher, was told her to try and do something every day quoting Apuleius.
00:37:26.194 - 00:37:44.322, Speaker A: And so I guess that's what that means. So anyways, a beautiful work here as usual. And I forgot to ask her if the background's on a different layer, but I'm pretty sure it is. Hi hand. We need to keep doing. Okay. So anyways, pretty cool as usual.
00:37:44.322 - 00:38:06.344, Speaker A: Interesting. And again, she doesn't like to do undo too much, so you get the smudges. We discussed the smudges too on the program yesterday on the Twitter spaces. RJ with an interesting work here. Terminal and print. Hello world. So a classic, your classic JavaScript here on a typewriter.
00:38:06.344 - 00:38:30.986, Speaker A: So again, playing with RJ's interest in old technology. I love how there's, I really like this piece and I love the manualness. It looks like he may have drawn this out with a mouse or something. Right? And even the letters. Right. So there's something quite interesting about how this was done. It's quite unusual, I would argue.
00:38:30.986 - 00:38:52.648, Speaker A: So anyways, the typewriter is really nice too. If alive, equal, true create. So a little bit more JavaScript. How many are left? There's still six left from RJ. An interesting piece from oxyn here. Awake, but at what cost? And then it seems to have this. What is it? Descartes.
00:38:52.648 - 00:39:17.028, Speaker A: Brain in a vat. Philosophical idea here. And this looks like a chat. GPT output. The brain in a vat is a thought experiment and philosophical concept that raises questions about the nature of reality, knowledge and perception. It is commonly associated with skepticism and the simulation hypothesis. And the long story short, I believe the idea is if you're.
00:39:17.028 - 00:39:42.308, Speaker A: What if everything that you're experiencing is actually just a mad scientist that has a brain in a bathtub of chemicals and is simulating and you think you're doing this, but really you're just a brain in a bathtub. It's kind of like the matrix. So you can read the details on Oxine's feed. But anyway, cool work here. Brain in a vat. Not sure where he's going with this. It almost looks like a card series, which is pretty cool.
00:39:42.308 - 00:39:55.774, Speaker A: And there's kind of a guy with almost like the matrix here and rune tune with a beautiful work here. Ron Tonkas. Are you freaking out? Portrait of Ron Tonkas. Bonkers. Tonkers. Manson. Pud.
00:39:55.774 - 00:40:16.802, Speaker A: Pud Manson. Anyways, really nice piece here. You gotta love this border here, I think. Very nice piece here. And even the tattoo that moves and beautiful texture. And even the. The drink here with maybe the mineral water or the beer and cigarettes and everything.
00:40:16.802 - 00:40:40.374, Speaker A: Just a really cool portrait. And the colors are very interesting, too. Very nicely put together by runetune. So that is a GIF 576 by 1024 photoshop and procreate. So that is still. There are two left, I believe, and reception by Ed Morolla. So Ed's on fire, as you can see here.
00:40:40.374 - 00:40:56.050, Speaker A: Listed something at 08:20 a.m. By the afternoon. He has a bid at 0.15 ETH. Everything is selling out. So the ETH collectors, I think, are warming up to Ed's work, which is quite interesting. They're starting to kind of battle for Ed's work here.
00:40:56.050 - 00:41:54.204, Speaker A: And understandably, I mean, Ed is so unique. And the massive output, again, being prolific builds credibility, because the more you put out, the more it's like, okay, this person knows what they're doing on a certain level, and then the more experimental you can be, because then you know, and the more familiar you get with people's experimentation. I mean, if Ed was doing, you know, fuzzy pixels, let's say, and just did it once, and then you never really saw it again, you might not be as persuaded as when we see Ed working with these kind of blurred out pixels, kind of noisy, jpegged out pixels, JPEG artifact like pixels over and over and over again. Then you go, okay, this is on purpose. And you know what? And it kind of educates your viewer of what you're doing. So again, it's just kind of all about building credibility. And so now that is starting to pay off with all these different techniques that Ed has done with all his experimentation.
00:41:54.204 - 00:42:21.324, Speaker A: It just looks great, and it's so interesting. So another skeleton. We're seeing tons of skulls and skeletons here, which is another interesting aspect. And almost, maybe a devil figure with flowers and a portal here. What is this called? Reception? Seems to be almost like the hell theme. And look at this kind of like texture. And you can't tell if it's like fire or if it's just the inside of a cave.
00:42:21.324 - 00:42:41.104, Speaker A: Maybe it's fire, though. This looks like. Like fire. I mean, so it's really beautifully done. And it's almost like how you actually see fire, where the heat waves come at a distance when you look on a landscape on a really hot day. So super interesting. Some nice work by Hasdrubal waffle.
00:42:41.104 - 00:42:58.460, Speaker A: You know, I put less tabs here, and the show keeps going on. It keeps being like 50 minutes here. Desperately trying to make it shorter. Eschaton. Which just makes me think of Terrence McKenna immediately. Live feed, already in progress. Apocalypse s'mores.
00:42:58.460 - 00:43:18.856, Speaker A: So here we have. Who is this? The marshmallow man or the. Not the Michelin tire guy? This almost. Is this from Ghostbusters? I'm trying to remember where this reference is from. Anyways, Slayer. And another beautiful, highly textured work by azdrubal waffle. Great contrast down here in the left hand corner.
00:43:18.856 - 00:43:40.192, Speaker A: It's looking great. Nice composition. Nice kind of reference to our operating system with the closed windows and everything. And again, this nice contrast with these pixelated works on the bottom. Pixelated figures here. And again, just this kind of rough pixelation here. Right? So again, this kind of blurred out pixelation.
00:43:40.192 - 00:44:02.504, Speaker A: Anyways, interesting. Kind of reminds me of Ghostbusters. This was great. Where do you hear the music here? This is also a strubble waffle. Sounds super cool. I mean, it's really cool. I assume he made it.
00:44:02.504 - 00:44:27.484, Speaker A: So corns, maybe? Is the name a tribute to object? I wish I brought this up. Maybe we can find it. Here we go. You know what we'll do? I mean, it's really good music. Like, what a cool work of art. I'd love to own this. I think I.
00:44:27.484 - 00:44:38.244, Speaker A: I think I put an offer in. I think I started the auction. Auction bid. Yeah. But obviously that didn't. I had to go and that. Yeah, Radda got it.
00:44:38.244 - 00:44:47.924, Speaker A: That's the same song. I know what piece this is going to be. This is Rada's piece. I love this piece. Gmon. This is where it's doom, I bet. Or.
00:44:47.924 - 00:45:02.864, Speaker A: Sorry, let me just go back. I'll put it in here. Sometimes it's tricky. This is going to be rada, I think, or no, this is a different piece. I'll show you a work very quickly. Okay. So I don't know if this.
00:45:02.864 - 00:45:27.036, Speaker A: I'm not sure if this is. Two corns is. So that is the right. I'll show you why I think Ratta bought it. Interesting tribute. Now if we go back as the detective work. Okay, so we go to Rada's page.
00:45:27.036 - 00:45:55.374, Speaker A: So remember that track? It's a cool track, right? I was like, I wonder if hasdrubal waffle made it. Well, I think I know why Rata wanted to buy it. Because there is what I consider in my mind a famous rata Nft on this one. One of my favorites, actually. So remember the music kind of like fast tempo, kind of punky. New wave punky. Let's see if this loads up.
00:45:55.374 - 00:46:22.574, Speaker A: Here we go. It's like a similar track. I think it's the same track. This is a really cool. So I don't know if there's copyright with that. I assume it's fine. But anyways, I'm gonna keep going.
00:46:22.574 - 00:46:43.084, Speaker A: But that is probably the very cool piece by Ratta. I picked this up a while long time ago. One of the early pieces I picked up. More music, this time by junk a delic and Haiti Rockette. They have a couple of works here. More really cool music. Nice collab here.
00:46:43.084 - 00:47:05.534, Speaker A: This really reminds me of the nineties in a good way. 1997. Really. So very cool. So check that out. And there's another one here. These shows just keep going.
00:47:05.534 - 00:47:38.028, Speaker A: Almost another nineties. Sort of feel so very cool and classic sort of pet scene. Haiti Rockette work. So very cool. Anya Asano, terrestrial locomotion. I'm not sure who tweeted this out, but I saw this on Twitter, I believe. And anyway, it's just kind of a cool work by an artist that I already followed, but I missed the notification.
00:47:38.028 - 00:48:00.748, Speaker A: So anyways, a lot of experimentation with their work, as you can see here. So interesting artist. Okay, this was quite interesting over here very quickly. Yeah, you see this, like so pretty interesting. Continuing on nodal neurosis. And this was changing the fidelity of cattails. This is j, also known as eyes eight.
00:48:00.748 - 00:48:19.384, Speaker A: Eyes eight atelier. So anyways, some cattails and just some processing. And I thought that was pretty interesting. I mean, look at the views on these things. 65,000. So nice piece there. Renki, who Lorna Mills is a big fan of.
00:48:19.384 - 00:48:37.644, Speaker A: We learned in the comments last time. This is Asa. So anyways, another cool work by Renki. Quite like this one. They're releasing quite a bit of just cool animated abstract work. Kind of reminds me of kappan a little bit, how this is static, and then these dots move. I don't think we've looked at this, but it's possible we've looked at this already.
00:48:37.644 - 00:48:54.132, Speaker A: April 16 and pixel dealer. I don't think we looked at this either. This is from March 25. I don't know how I missed a pixel dealer work, but interesting. Again, animated abstract work. And beautiful how the color changes. And you gotta love these big, chunky pixels, too.
00:48:54.132 - 00:49:15.244, Speaker A: So big pixels, they work. So anyways, glitch. And let's just see. Pretty cheap for pixel dealer. And the listing was cancelled, interestingly. So they're just out there on pixel dealers wallet there. Capon cantar del medio, Sid.
00:49:15.244 - 00:49:38.314, Speaker A: So I think this is song of. Not sure, not exactly sure. Meteo, the middle something. So anyways, captain dropping the latin there with his pixel art. So another cool, just experimentation here by Kappan. And here is Kareem Safa with a cool work too. So these are being dropped on twitter.
00:49:38.314 - 00:49:56.170, Speaker A: No minting information. So these might just be experiments that they're sharing, which is always cool. And again, builds credibility over time. Side hustle is back with a couple experimental works. Untitled, a gif loop made with graphics. Two so retro tools. So interesting.
00:49:56.170 - 00:50:16.502, Speaker A: Just experimentation here from Pixel Nacho or the side hustle. And here's another one. So the other one was a one of one. And he just dropped these two, I think, yesterday. And then this is an edition of ten. So interesting experimentation. Untitled, so anti style.
00:50:16.502 - 00:50:42.744, Speaker A: So just playing around, it seems like so interesting experimentation. Code Necazono. How are we doing? 50 minutes in Codenacazono with a beautiful work here on his new series. And very nice kind of bitmap pixels in the background there on the yellow. Let's just see. Edition of eleven and filament number three. And selling at ten tezos each.
00:50:42.744 - 00:51:06.626, Speaker A: And basically, yeah, selling out within a couple of minutes, amazingly. That is impressive. That is very impressive. So coda necizono continues to do very well ex mortal with a beautiful flower here in bloom. Inhale. Exhale. So again, kind of a glitchy work here using probably some analog hardware.
00:51:06.626 - 00:51:17.854, Speaker A: One assumes edition of 15. And let's see if these have sold for fortezos. Sold out. Another one by xmortal. Edition of 15. Escape. So another skeleton.
00:51:17.854 - 00:51:31.924, Speaker A: So I don't know if there's some sort of meme that I'm not aware of. But there's a ton of skeletons. This is a beautiful one, though. The color. I love the kind of rainbow. Not rainbow, but just the very colorful skeleton here. Escape.
00:51:31.924 - 00:52:12.612, Speaker A: So that is cool. And it's on secondary for 57, so not cheap. Sold on primary for five. And here is Elie Lowe with a new trash artist, trash bag number 62. Always kind of mysterious with Eli Lo. Never quite know what the deal is, but they all fit really well together, don't they? So interesting. And also Osborne with Silk Road.
00:52:12.612 - 00:52:38.094, Speaker A: This came out a few, maybe this came out a month ago. I don't think we saw this. And it just sold a few days ago. How much did it sell for? Just transferred. So this was minted on March 23, but I don't think we saw it. And, you know, a reference to Silk road and bitcoin, so early days of bitcoin there. So another kind of nice piece and one by leprochant that kind of fit really well with it.
00:52:38.094 - 00:52:53.102, Speaker A: Breakout. And this is basically the profile of an investor that is aggressive. And these are available for 220. And there are three left. So interesting piece. I wonder if it's AI. Kind of looks like AI, but I'm not positive on that.
00:52:53.102 - 00:53:26.664, Speaker A: So interesting work by leprochant. And zooming right along here, Noah Cocker with road less traveled and an interesting fragment. It looks like an AI work, doesn't it? And interesting contrast with all these blues in a landscape that is kind of being stretched out and then a road right on top of it. You wonder if that was the raw output. So interesting. From Noah Cocker or kosher. And they're on foundation and super rare, so that is cool.
00:53:26.664 - 00:53:49.248, Speaker A: And these, I can't remember how I found these. Someone was sharing something on Instagram. And then I came across this account, Joss sobble. And this is 42 weeks ago using Dal E. But I thought, quite beautiful AI artwork here using Dal E. And they didn't make a ton of it. Like there wasn't a ton.
00:53:49.248 - 00:54:04.762, Speaker A: This is almost like a one off to a certain degree. But I thought that was this one in particular. I would have loved to see a whole lot more of these. So that is interesting. Anyway, nice piece. Disneyland characters, professional wrestling, exploring AI. So this person was just experimenting.
00:54:04.762 - 00:54:20.914, Speaker A: And here's another one. Conversations with machines about childhood, nostalgia and surrealism. Auschucks 34. So this is probably awshucks, who I think has bought some work from me. So shout out to aw shucks. Nice work. Very nice work.
00:54:20.914 - 00:54:56.248, Speaker A: And I love how this is like an animation cell that looks like it's been treated with AI. This is very interesting. I would say it's a great contrast this AI with this kind of, you know, Disney animation. So, anyways, very cool work from Josh Sobel, aka Oshucks. I think it's the same person. And strange thing is now playing with relief sculpture here and combining kind of soft and hard, especially there. I mean, a classic kind of surrealist move is to play with soft and hard.
00:54:56.248 - 00:55:20.198, Speaker A: And so here it looks. It's clothing that's soft and, you know, statuary or statues that are release sculpture that is hard. So, anyways, interesting experimentation from strange thing. You're not quite sure how to interpret it. It probably could be soft, but it looks hard. Anyway, interesting. And continuing through the boots and everything.
00:55:20.198 - 00:55:39.580, Speaker A: And also a car with this kind of relief sculpture on top. So very interesting from strange thing. Renaissance style car, anyone? And we've looked at this artist many times. I thought this was a nice one where it had. It looks like a St. George and the dragon type thing. Or maybe a medieval scene here by Bruno Miguel studio.
00:55:39.580 - 00:55:55.220, Speaker A: And this is, again, tinted acrylics on carpet. Very, very cool here. And I love the little fires and everything. It's a fun piece again. So, yeah, really nice piece. It doesn't look like St. George and the dragon.
00:55:55.220 - 00:56:12.668, Speaker A: It looks more like a medieval romance type work. And there is the artist, I believe, so very cool. I think he's out of Brazil, but I'm not positive. And that is your show, everyone. Thank you for joining me. I am trying to make these shorter. Clearly, I need to make them more short.
00:56:12.668 - 00:56:14.804, Speaker A: Anyways, thanks again, and take care.
