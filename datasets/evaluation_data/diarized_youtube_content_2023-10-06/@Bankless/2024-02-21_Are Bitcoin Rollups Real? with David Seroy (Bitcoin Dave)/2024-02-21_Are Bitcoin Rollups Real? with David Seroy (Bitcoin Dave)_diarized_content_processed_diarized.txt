00:00:00.170 - 00:00:18.560, Speaker A: That's kind of how I feel about this whole broader, like, l two renaissance and what's possible in the bitcoin world. Like, I don't care if it sinks or swims. I'm pretty sure it's going to be very successful. But even if it's not, like, this is ideas worth pursuing, you know, like, we are freaking missionaries, not mercenaries. And if people disagree with it, it's like, bring it on.
00:00:22.050 - 00:00:32.914, Speaker B: Welcome to Bankless, where we explore the frontier of Internet money and Internet finance. This is Ryan. Sean Adams. I'm here with David Hoffman, and we're here to help you become more bitcoiners. Oh, is that what we're doing, David?
00:00:32.962 - 00:00:34.498, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a bitcoin episode.
00:00:34.594 - 00:00:46.220, Speaker B: This is a really simple premise for today's episode. We brought on somebody who could answer the question for us. For me, I had more of the questions, actually, than you, David, coming into this episode. Are bitcoin layer twos real?
00:00:47.390 - 00:00:49.722, Speaker D: What do you mean by that question? What does that mean?
00:00:49.776 - 00:01:44.634, Speaker B: That's kind of what I was going to ask our guests, and did ask our guests, but what I sort of mean is I was under the impression that bitcoin did not have the expressivity, did not have the virtual machine, was more like a calculator and not a computer at its base layer, and therefore had a very difficult, if impossible, probably impossible time launching what Ethereum calls a roll up, which is some sort of chain that is secured by the base chain. And this next guest says, actually, layer twos are possible on bitcoin with an asterisk. With an asterisk. And he explains why. So I thought it was a brilliant episode and it doesn't answer all of my questions, but opens the door to possibility that I didn't know fully existed. And so I've still some research to do on this. This is probably the first episode of several in the future where we explore this topic in more depth.
00:01:44.634 - 00:01:58.450, Speaker B: But I don't know, this guest has some legitimacy on this topic. And actually, you know this person, right? And so he came in my Twitter dms or my tweets, and I was just like, david, who is this? This is a good answer. You had already met him in person. Yeah.
00:01:58.600 - 00:02:05.700, Speaker C: This is basically how your. My relationship is, are. Who is this person? I met this person that one time.
00:02:06.710 - 00:02:45.282, Speaker D: Yeah. We'll talk about a little bit of the intro, how we met David in the show. Shout out Steven from alfalfa. One thing I want to say before we go into this episode is that when we talk about the differences between layer ones. Usually there are things that get lost in translation, especially when I do some of these Solana episodes, I have to stop and just translate for the listeners who I know are thinking in Ethereum terms, but across smart contract platforms, that's actually pretty easy to do and not all that complicated. It's just like, usually swap out one word, replace it. Replace it with a different word, right? And then there's the conversation of learning.
00:02:45.336 - 00:02:47.070, Speaker C: About bitcoin versus ethereum.
00:02:47.230 - 00:03:11.702, Speaker D: And if learning about Solana to Ethereum is like English to Spanish or something, learning about Ethereum to bitcoin is like English to Chinese. You can translate. It does work, but it's entirely different. And so when we talk about layer twos on bitcoin and we talk about fraud proofs and we talk about different things, yes, we are close, but we need to actually, some things don't always carry over.
00:03:11.836 - 00:03:13.318, Speaker C: So I think that's important context for.
00:03:13.324 - 00:03:27.454, Speaker D: Listeners to go in. It's like you don't just swap one thing out with a one word and place it with a bitcoin word. That's not how it works. And so layer twos and fraud proofs and ZK rollups and expressivity on bitcoin will look different. It's like same, same, but different. And so you can't perfectly translate these.
00:03:27.492 - 00:03:29.598, Speaker C: Things and you'll listen to me and.
00:03:29.604 - 00:03:34.618, Speaker D: Ryan stumble our way into that realization once again as we have this conversation with bitcoin Dave.
00:03:34.714 - 00:03:57.880, Speaker B: Yeah, there were some stumblings in this episode, but we didn't have an agenda going in. We just wanted to pick David Seroy, who's our guest. We call him bitcoin David because we have two davids in this episode. Pick his brain. I think hopefully the result is something that can further your knowledge on what bitcoin is building because there's kind of a renaissance going on. A little bit like some glimmers of it.
00:03:58.250 - 00:04:00.966, Speaker C: Bitcoin Dave to bitcoin David presents a.
00:04:00.988 - 00:04:05.290, Speaker D: Zero to one moment in bitcoin building that is potentially ahead to us.

00:06:03.230 - 00:06:32.134, Speaker C: Cello is the mobile first EVM compatible carbon negative blockchain built for the real world, driving real world use cases like mobile payments and mobile DFI. And with Opera Minipay as one of the fastest growing web3 wallets, Cello is seeing a meteoric rise with over 300 million transactions and 1.5 million monthly active addresses. And now Celo is looking to come home to Ethereum as a layer two optimism. Polygon, Matterlabs, and Arbitrum have all thrown their hats in the ring for the cello layer two to build upon their stacks.
00:06:32.182 - 00:06:33.030, Speaker D: Why the competition?
00:06:33.110 - 00:07:02.430, Speaker C: The cello layer two will bring huge advantages, like a decentralized sequencer offchain, data availability secured by Ethereum validators and one block finality. What does that all mean for you with cello layer two, gas fees will stay low, and you can even pay for gas natively using ERC 20 tokens, sending crypto to phone numbers across wallets using social connect. But Cello is a community governed protocol. This means that Cello needs you to weigh in and make your voice heard.

00:07:02.510 - 00:07:09.522, Speaker B: Bankless nation, we are super excited to introduce you to David Sea Roy. Yes, we have a second David on the podcast today. This is the bitcoin David.
00:07:09.586 - 00:07:10.226, Speaker D: Bitcoin Dave.
00:07:10.258 - 00:07:43.546, Speaker B: I guess my co host maybe David Hoffman, I should refer to you as Ethereum David. So we've got bitcoin David here, and he is a bitcoin wizard, I would say. What does that mean? He is definitely an armchair researcher in the bitcoin roll up ecosystem. He loves bitcoin and loves projects that are building on bitcoin. He actually had probably the best answer I received to a question about the bitcoin roll up community, an l two community I put out and is part of the reason for this podcast. Bitcoin David, welcome to Bankless.
00:07:43.658 - 00:07:47.042, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks for having me. I'm excited. I can't believe you guys let a bitcoiner on here.
00:07:47.096 - 00:07:48.290, Speaker B: Oh, we do that.
00:07:48.440 - 00:07:52.740, Speaker D: Yeah, we bring bitcoiners on. Nick Carter is our number one most.
00:07:54.630 - 00:07:56.654, Speaker B: Who else who is after Vitalik?
00:07:56.702 - 00:07:58.414, Speaker C: After Vitalik Buterin, then Nick Carter.
00:07:58.462 - 00:08:00.422, Speaker B: David, who am I forgetting being of this month?
00:08:00.556 - 00:08:10.554, Speaker D: We've got Eric Wall. Eric Wall, like, on four or five times. We had Lyn Alden on, like, five times. We just had Robert Breedlove on.
00:08:10.752 - 00:08:12.540, Speaker B: Robert Breedlove, of course.
00:08:12.910 - 00:08:13.514, Speaker A: Okay, fair.
00:08:13.552 - 00:08:18.410, Speaker D: Bitcoin represents at least two to 3% of all bankless podcasts.
00:08:19.310 - 00:08:23.290, Speaker A: When you put it like that. That's very small. We got to pump those numbers up.
00:08:23.360 - 00:08:32.506, Speaker B: Yeah, it's undersized as far as mark. Yeah, well, that's what we're doing today. So bitcoin David, I understand. Actually, you guys have met in person, so this isn't your first meeting.
00:08:32.698 - 00:08:51.880, Speaker D: We were introduced by Steven Cesaro of the Alfalfa podcast fame, and David was introduced to me as bitcoin Dave, and that's how his name is stuck in my brain. And once again, entering this recording room, I was like, wait, David, are you called bitcoin Dave? Or is that just how Steven introduced you? And apparently that's just what.
00:08:53.930 - 00:08:55.990, Speaker A: Actually, we actually played pickleball the next day, and.
00:08:56.060 - 00:08:57.234, Speaker D: Then we played pickleball.
00:08:57.362 - 00:09:07.126, Speaker A: David told me about a really cool idea. He said he wants to put pickleballs on the blockchain. It needs ethereum.
00:09:07.238 - 00:09:10.634, Speaker D: Yeah, we're track points, so no one can cheat with points.
00:09:10.752 - 00:09:33.298, Speaker B: But isn't that the broader question, like which blockchain? Because now bitcoin can support some tokens. I'm hopeful. Bitcoin. Dave, you'll tell us a little bit about this, because maybe I'll start the conversation. We're going to talk about the broader bitcoin ecosystem. But my base question in that tweet that you helped answer for me was this, okay, a question for the unbiased big brains. That's how I couch this.
00:09:33.298 - 00:10:06.506, Speaker B: Can bitcoin have an l two roll up that satisfies the five slices of the decentralization pie? I was referring to the l two beat pie, where there's like kind of five slices that demarcate decentralization. I mean, is there an exit window? Do you have some sort of decentralized sequencer, a few other things? Or does it lack expressivity? And so, David, I want to throw that question to you, basically. So can bitcoin now support l two roll ups? And what does that even mean in the context of bitcoin?
00:10:06.618 - 00:10:57.610, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I'm going to give a really clear answer here and say yes, but it depends. And really, it kind of depends on, I'd say, three general things. First is like, what flavor of roll up are we talking about? Are we talking about like a fully validating ZK roll up, a sovereign roll up that has no proving system, or an optimistic roll up? The second question is, are we saying with a soft fork or without a soft fork? And then the third question is, what level of trust is acceptable? And if we jump all the way to the answer that people probably care about is like, no, we want no soft forks. We want fully trustless, and it needs to be a fully validating zk or validity roll up. If that's the exact criteria we need, then technically no, bitcoin cannot do that. And that is because bitcoin does not have the ability to natively verify zero knowledge or validity proofs on the base layer. Where this gets a little bit interesting is bitvm.
00:10:57.610 - 00:12:01.410, Speaker A: And BitVM potentially allows us to hack in a Zkp verifier into the bitcoin l one without a soft fork. And so BitVM was this white paper that Robin Linus, a developer, an amazing researcher in the bitcoin community, wrote back in mid December, and that was about six weeks ago. And so the claim with BitVm is that we can now compute anything on bitcoin, and we can express touring complete smart contracts on bitcoin. And so if this is true, which it appears to be, then this is kind of the fundamental breakthrough that really changes the paradigm for what is possible on bitcoin. The caveat with BiTVM is that it's a little bit clunky, and it has a trust assumption of one of n, meaning that you can perform this computation where we could have a ZKP verifier on the bitcoin l one. But the people that are performing that computation could be a group of ten, 101,000 people. You only need one of them, to be honest, in order to kind of get the crypto economic security there.
00:12:01.410 - 00:12:53.406, Speaker A: And some people would say, well, that's not good enough, but if we can essentially optimistically create a validity prover, then maybe that's good enough to build the bridge. And I mean that technically building a bridge, but also metaphorically building a bridge to cross that chasm that bitcoin typically can't cross. And if you can cross that chasm, then you get into the whole world that ethereum is in. You get into this idea of shared sequences and cross composability and pre confirmations and tons of different execution environments. Some really truly amazing stuff. So BiTVM is the real innovation that this could possibly happen without a software in a little bit of a hacky way, and that may be good enough to kind of build out the rest of this. And maybe down the line we say, okay, we want the fully trustless version.
00:12:53.406 - 00:12:56.958, Speaker A: We're going to soft fork in a dedicated ZKP verifier.
00:12:57.054 - 00:13:32.942, Speaker B: Okay, so I want to get back to BitVM as kind of maybe part of the final destination here, but could we zoom out for just a minute before we get into some of these more technical details? So where's this innovation coming from in bitcoin? Why has bitcoin just discovered that, oh, wow, we can launch roll ups and layer twos on top of bitcoin? Is this some kind of a builder renaissance? Has this always been possible? There wasn't the funding or the projects? Or is this just kind of new novel experimentation? Are they seeing the success of Ethereum? They're just like, hey, we could just do that here. Where's this renaissance coming from?
00:13:33.076 - 00:14:20.538, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, there's a bunch of moving puzzle pieces. Like, to be clear, a lot of this stuff was kind of discussed early on in bitcoin talk forums, there is a post from Greg Maxwell, who's kind of this OG, just amazing bitcoin developer where he talks about bringing zkps to bitcoin. And he specifically references Ellie Ben san, who was the founder and is now the CEO of Starquare. So this has always kind of been on bitcoin's radar. And there's even quotes from Satoshi where he talks about if the technology has caught up, this would be the best way to improve and kind of scale bitcoin. All the evidence is there. Where this really kind of starts, in my opinion, is not starts, but back in 2014, where blockstream released their white paper for side chains.
00:14:20.538 - 00:14:53.222, Speaker A: And this was like the scaling vision for bitcoin, where it's like you're going to have the bitcoin based layer and then you're going to have all these side chains. Maybe you have a big block side chain, maybe you have a privacy side chain, maybe you have whatever other specialties. And everybody loved this vision, but the one problem is the blocks room white paper said, oh, by the way, we haven't solved this trustless two way peg. So for now, you're just going to have this federated model where you bridge your bitcoin into these other ecosystems. You'll trust us with a multi sig, we'll solve the trustless two way peg later. That never happened. And in the interim, bitcoin went down the path of like, lightning network.
00:14:53.222 - 00:15:29.970, Speaker A: They got Segwit in it, fixed the transaction malleability, which was an issue that prevented lightning from occurring. All that happened with the block size wars in 2017. And then we said we're going to go all in on essentially lightning. While that was happening, as you guys know, like the Ethereum community went down this other path where you said, we're going to pursue plasma and then state channels, and then you eventually settled on roll ups. What we're now seeing in the bitcoin community, in my opinion, is that lightning is massively hindered and I think people drastically overestimate essentially what it can do. And don't get me wrong, I love the lightning community. I support the builders.
00:15:29.970 - 00:16:09.634, Speaker A: But there are some systemic issues which in my opinion, are probably going to be insurmountable for it to truly scale bitcoin. And Ben Carmen, he goes by Ben the Carmen on Twitter really wrote this very nice post where he kind of said, he's like, I'm a lightning lover. He's like, I am one of the developers. He goes, but sometimes I look around and be like, what are we doing? Is this really the right path for bitcoin to scale? And he laid out all these reasons why lightning, it has some issues. I think a lot of those issues are going to be tough to get past. And even if we do get past.
00:16:09.672 - 00:16:13.186, Speaker E: Them, it's just like it doesn't have a global state.
00:16:13.288 - 00:16:33.958, Speaker A: You're going to have the inbound liquidity issues. It doesn't have very good privacy. It requires massive footprints on the l one is an issue. So if Ryan and I want to open up a channel that requires an on chain transaction, if you want to add more liquidity into this channel, that requires an on chain transaction.
00:16:34.054 - 00:17:12.966, Speaker B: So, David, just to kind of get up to this point, and it sounds like there's been some eras of bitcoin development, right? So bitcoin had kind of its side chain era, let's say. And that never manifested into kind of like a true trustless bridge and something that Ethereum would call more like a roll up. And that was one area. And then lightning was kind of the thing. I mean, Ethereum, you rightly pointed out, very much had its kind of state channel era where we thought that would be like the holy grail for Ethereum. And we tried a lot in that. Remember, Amin Soleimani built his entire company spank chain on top of that, and we had raiden, and that was sort of like this.
00:17:12.966 - 00:17:54.210, Speaker B: And it never achieved product market fit. It never got the traction, I think, for the same reasons that the bitcoin communities is seeing its endeavor inside of state channels through lightnings, like, some of the same things still applied. Right? And then we entered kind of this roll up era of Ethereum. And then so much so that Ethereum essentially pivoted its entire roadmap to be know, Vitalik called it the roll up centric roadmap. Right. So you're saying the similar trajectory, the similar path is happening just like slower and a little delayed, but it's happening in the same way in the bitcoin community? Or is there something I'm missing here?
00:17:54.360 - 00:17:56.900, Speaker A: No, I mean, that's exactly right.
00:17:57.510 - 00:17:58.894, Speaker E: I think one of the things that.
00:17:58.952 - 00:18:42.610, Speaker A: Was kind of the breaking point was a lot of the ordinals and encryption stuff, because encryptions, they post arbitrary data on chain, and some people will call that spam, and it's not monetary use cases and all of that. But bottom line, they are fee paying customers, and so they are kind of pushing up fees on the bitcoin l one chain. In the same way that Ethereum kind of had their fee crisis and fees were booming. Fees on bitcoin, they're not like absurd, but they're creeping up. And what people are finding is that the lightning network really suffers in a high fee environment. And people are sitting there and looking and saying, wait, this security budget that bitcoin has, we're relying on fees to be higher long term. But our long term scaling solution, lightning doesn't really work in a high fee environment.
00:18:42.610 - 00:19:04.474, Speaker A: And I think that was the catalyst that kind of is making people question, okay, is this a long term solution? And we have other things like arc, which is very cool. People are working on things kind of like RGB as well, and space chains and all this stuff. But at the end of the day, nothing has solved the trustless two way.
00:19:04.512 - 00:19:08.826, Speaker E: Peg, but roll ups potentially. Do I want to present actually a.
00:19:08.848 - 00:19:47.686, Speaker D: Slightly, a different characterization of the progress of ethereum scalability as it compares to the bitcoin story? Because we had the Ethereum layer one, but we knew it was always needing to scale beyond that. And so we started with state channels, which then grew into generalized state channels, which then grew into plasma for hyperscale. And we were doing these plasma thing for a really long time. We had these plasma implementers calls, and then there was like this aha. Eureka moment, which morphed into optimistic roll ups, and we had like the Unipig demo. And then that's how we got to optimistic rollups. And then also we knew that ZK rollups would ultimately manifest as a result of that.
00:19:47.686 - 00:19:56.522, Speaker D: And it was a very logical progression of thought, of research and development and direction and iteration, until it actually landed on where we are today.
00:19:56.656 - 00:20:02.474, Speaker B: Would you say David is kind of like an idea maze kind of quest? Like we hit some dead ends back.
00:20:02.512 - 00:20:35.110, Speaker D: Up, but smaller dead ends, right? And then we kept on progressing, each one built on the history of the other. And what I'm seeing in bitcoin is actually people going down the lightning idea maze, realizing that it's a pretty strong, pretty far log tons of investment into lightning network, and realizing it's a pretty strong dead end. And now we're actually going very far back and picking an entirely new strategy for bitcoin expressivity and bitcoin scalability. David, that's kind of how I would kind of change that characterization. Would you agree?
00:20:35.180 - 00:20:49.914, Speaker A: I do want to somewhat defend the lightning community. I don't think it's a dead end, but I think that it has significant limitations that can't be overcome by just like, just give it enough dev time. People are like oh, the builders are building. It's like, no. And Vitalik pointed this out.
00:20:49.952 - 00:20:52.102, Speaker E: It's like the layer two.
00:20:52.176 - 00:21:19.110, Speaker A: Like lightning is essentially bound by essentially what the l one is capable of. And so there's just systemic limitations that lightning is going to have. Could it be something that kind of connects all these different layers, like if you have a bunch of roll ups or something like fetty mints. And can it connect these? Yes. But is it going to be this grand vision that everybody hopes for? No, that doesn't mean we abandon it. It just means, let's let a thousand flowers bloom.
00:21:19.930 - 00:22:11.042, Speaker B: Bitcoin. David, I should, you know, I'm wondering if the bitcoin community has kind of felt this, because I'm not sure if you would represent yourself as sort of a minority of folks I know there's been kind of like the Nick Carter ootie sort of wizards sort of side of things, and there's almost been this forking in the social layer of bitcoin, of kind of builders and those who just want just the pure gold store of value use case. But it also seems to me like some of the people who were embracing of some sort of scaling of trustless transactions per second, and they were formerly bitcoiners. Like, I count myself among those already moved to the Ethereum community. I'm wondering if you think that effect is in play too. So I consider myself a bitcoiner. I love bitcoin.
00:22:11.042 - 00:22:47.282, Speaker B: I still own bitcoin. I don't know if some bitcoiners in kind of like the bitcoin tribe would acknowledge me as a bitcoiner, but I consider myself a bitcoiner. That said, I moved over to Ethereum because they had a roadmap that was actually trying to scale this whole trustless, compute piece of it. And yes, in the early days, the monetary properties weren't quite as pristine. It doesn't have kind of the anonymous, faceless founder, but I saw this potential to build kind of a bankless money system. And that's why I moved over into the Ethereum community, because they were pursuing that most aggressively. But you're saying.
00:22:47.282 - 00:23:10.070, Speaker B: I think what you're saying is there are still some bitcoiners out there who are trying to build this vision on top of bitcoin. And one of my basic questions is like, but why just why not do it on Ethereum? Or why have you stayed? You seem like you're very much the builder mindset. Why have you stayed inside of the bitcoin community? And why do you still have hopes and aspirations there.
00:23:10.220 - 00:23:53.782, Speaker A: When I talk to a lot of bitcoiners and it kind of gets into this implicit discussion of bitcoin versus ethereum, they're like, well, this is a monetary revolution, not a technology revolution. And that used to bother me so much because I'm like, yes, it's a monetary revolution, but damn it, the tech matters. And there were many times where I would listen to bankless episodes and I'm like, man, this stuff is freaking exciting and it's cool. But I always had this spot in my heart for bitcoin because that is the use case. It is all about the money. And if we can kind of merge these two worlds, that is the best case scenario. And now that we see some of this technical stuff that Ethereum has pioneered, and we could potentially bring it to bitcoin, that is the vision that I want.
00:23:53.782 - 00:24:18.586, Speaker A: I do not think that Ethereum is as good of money as bitcoin. I could sit here and kind of stay silent and be like, but damn, Ethereum has legit scaling solutions. I can honestly say that I do not think it is as good of money. And I think what you guys are starting to realize right now is that scaling, block space, composability, all that stuff is going to be call. But where are the apps? Where are the freaking apps? Like, what is going to be the use? It's been the same since day one. It's money. It's payments.
00:24:18.586 - 00:24:35.300, Speaker A: It's payments to each other. It's payments in private. It's payments to a loan contract. It's payments against collateral. It's payments if you want to send it using face id on Apple Pay. It's always been payments. And it's always been money.
00:24:35.300 - 00:24:54.394, Speaker A: Bitcoin maximalists, for all of their flaws and for all the frankly dumb things they say, what they got right is the monetary revolution. And even after this episode, I think so many of them, I hope, will listen to this, and they'll probably still be blind to roll ups and the power of them. But them holding their ground and having.
00:24:54.432 - 00:24:58.090, Speaker E: That anchor and understanding that the tech.
00:24:58.160 - 00:25:22.450, Speaker A: In my opinion, is kind of irrelevant unless you have the money. That part they got right. And that's why I'm sympathetic to the bitcoin camp. That, in my opinion, is the true revolution. But ultimately, if you want that revolution, you need to have the technical side. Bitcoin, in its current condition, you really can only scale to less than 1% of the world in self custody. That is not viable.
00:25:22.450 - 00:25:33.666, Speaker A: We need to increase the scaling of self custody. We need to bring some form of expressivity so people can borrow against their bitcoin. They don't have to sell it so that people can have private transactions.
00:25:33.858 - 00:25:34.854, Speaker E: We need it.
00:25:34.972 - 00:25:56.026, Speaker B: So, David, I'm going to ask, you know, we certainly made the case for bankless money systems built on top of bitcoin, and it seemed to be a roadblock in the past. I'm wondering if you could kind of like, what would you say to the bitcoin community? I mean, sell them, pitch them on roll ups? Why should the bitcoin community get excited about roll ups?
00:25:56.218 - 00:26:25.734, Speaker A: This whole vision that we have about like 21 million, 21 million is thrown out the window. If anybody can't have the optionality to self custody right now, there is only a certain allotment of block space every single 10 minutes. If bitcoin gets any modicum of scale, those blocks are essentially going to be full and it's going to price out every single other person from having self custody. If everyone is using these custodial solutions, they don't even have the option to go into layer one.
00:26:25.852 - 00:26:28.486, Speaker E: Then that in and of itself leads.
00:26:28.518 - 00:26:35.146, Speaker A: To massive attack surface for fractional reserve lending, for rehypothecation to kind of like.
00:26:35.328 - 00:26:38.106, Speaker B: Basically the block Phi's and celsiuses of the world.
00:26:38.208 - 00:27:24.666, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, just anything, even putting your funds into a custodial lightning node, it gives this attack vector to implicitly break the 21 million. And that's what essentially people care about and seeing kind of like the decentralized finance movement, like the D five movement in ethereum, I think bitcoin is massively underestimate this. Even if you think finance is the scum of the earth and you're this kind of like rothbardian, austrian economist. Finance is the anchor that money must carry. If we want this perfect world, you need the ability to audit these kind of contracts. Like people are going to borrow, they're going to lend, there's going to be all this stuff. If you can audit all of that and you can cryptographically enforce this set of rules, all of that contributes to.
00:27:24.688 - 00:27:28.618, Speaker E: This trustless hard money world.
00:27:28.704 - 00:28:45.106, Speaker C: Mantle, formerly known as Bitdao, is the first dowled web3 ecosystem, all built on top of Mantle's first core product, the Mantle Network, a brand new high performance ethereum layer two, built using the op stack, but uses Eigen layer's data availability solution instead of the expensive Ethereum layer one. Not only does this reduce mantle network's gas fees by 80%, but it also reduces gas fee volatility, providing a more stable foundation for mantle's applications. The Mantle treasury is one of the biggest dow owned treasuries, which is seeding an ecosystem of projects from all around the web3 space for mantle Mantle already has subcommunities from around web3 onboarded like game seven for web3 gaming and buybit for TVL and liquidity and OnRAM. So if you want to build on the mantle network, Mantle is offering a grants program that provides milestone based funding to promising projects that help expand, secure, and decentralize Mantle.

00:30:12.820 - 00:31:02.410, Speaker B: Okay, so in the beginning of this episode, I started with kind of like a question that brought us into the weeds really quick. And you started talking about BiTVM, right, which is the question of, can bitcoin really launch roll ups? Completely decentralized, Ethereum style roll ups? And you throw out kind of a few categories and definitions there. But before the BitVM thing that you're talking about, which we can still get into a little bit more what has traditionally been possible on top of bitcoin. Because where I sort of last left things, it seemed to me that bitcoin did not have the expressivity to sort of do much more than some sort of a side chain, multi sig side chain. Right. And it was kind of like the early days where things maybe left off. But you mentioned sovereign roll ups.
00:31:02.410 - 00:31:19.026, Speaker B: To me, that's kind of like. I think that's sort of a side chain type of thing. So what sort of thing has been possible when bitcoin talks about layer twos or the community talks about roll ups, what are they describing? I guess, outside of bitvm, which is maybe a special case that we'll get into in a minute.
00:31:19.218 - 00:31:53.134, Speaker A: I mean, the main problem with bitcoin is that it has no concept of the outside world, right? Like, if you are on a side chain, the side chain can run a bitcoin node. It can interpret essentially what's happening on bitcoin, but bitcoin cannot interpret it, what's happening on these other side chains. So you can bridge bitcoin out of the ecosystem, because those other chains, those other ecosystems can read bitcoin. But if you're trying to bring bitcoin back into the ecosystem, bitcoin has no idea what happens in that outside world. And so that's the main problem. It's essentially just a trustless two way peg. Like, if you want to peg your.
00:31:53.172 - 00:31:57.666, Speaker E: Bitcoin outside into a side chain, you.
00:31:57.688 - 00:32:13.986, Speaker A: Can'T do it because of that. And zero knowledge proofs could potentially solve that. So what I could do is kind of give like an overview of how bitcoin roll ups would work from a bitcoiner perspective. But I can start using some ethereum vernacular and vocabulary, and I think that would be helpful.
00:32:14.018 - 00:32:30.010, Speaker B: That'd be very helpful, as far as I understand. So, like, an optimistic roll up would not be possible on bitcoin, right. Because we don't have a smart contract that can kind of enforce sort of the fraud proof type of game, but maybe there's hope for some sort of a ZK roll up, is that what you're saying?
00:32:30.160 - 00:32:34.302, Speaker E: Well, BitVM potentially could enable both of.
00:32:34.356 - 00:33:16.806, Speaker A: Those in a kind of quasi trust minimized way. And I'll get to that. But let me describe the roles first, that we're all on the same page. So, in the Ethereum world, you guys have talked a lot about this modular thesis, right? How you have the data, the computation, and the settlement, and bitcoin is really no different. When a user submits a bitcoin transaction like Alice sends one bitcoin to Bob, that is data that goes up into the mempool, which is like the waiting room, right? The miners mine the block, and then they go up into the waiting room, up into the mempool, they pull it down, they collect the transaction fee, and then they create the block. They package all of those transactions, that data, into the block. That block then gets propagated out to the rest of the network.
00:33:16.806 - 00:33:44.450, Speaker A: It gets sent to all the nodes. And if you're being a good little bitcoiner, you're running your node, you receive that block, and you're going through, and you're essentially performing the computation. You're validating all those transactions. You're saying, does Alice actually have one bitcoin? Is this a valid signature? Okay. Yes. And then they append that block to the rest of the prior blocks in the blockchain, and then now you've essentially audited everything up until that date, and then you settle the transaction. You say, all right, Alice no longer has one bitcoin.
00:33:45.350 - 00:33:47.894, Speaker E: Bob has it with a roll up.
00:33:47.932 - 00:34:01.078, Speaker A: In a bitcoin world similar to ethereum, you're abstracting that computation part. That kind of incrementing and decrementing of the balances is no longer being done by your nodes. It's being done in this off chain environment, right?
00:34:01.244 - 00:34:03.974, Speaker E: And, you know, I think an astute.
00:34:04.022 - 00:34:29.326, Speaker A: Bitcoiner at this point will say, well, hold on a second, actually, let me back up really quick, because you're not doing the computation on bitcoin anymore. You're doing, in this off chain environment, you can use any custom execution environment you want. You're no longer bound by what is called bitcoin script, which is kind of like the EVM equivalent in the bitcoin world. You can now use EVM in this off chain computation world. You could use chirode, you could use rust, you could use clarity.
00:34:29.358 - 00:34:31.186, Speaker E: You could use whatever language you want.
00:34:31.368 - 00:35:42.746, Speaker A: At this point a bitcoiner would say, well, hold on a second, if this computation, this kind of incrementing of decrementing of these balances is happening off chain and my node is not validating all of that, then doesn't that defeat the whole purpose of bitcoin? And this is where, as you guys know, like the zero knowledge proof comes in, where all of that computation, which it could have been smart contracts and DFI and nfts or fast transactions, small transactions, all of that is essentially compressed into a singular zero knowledge proof, which is like an unforgivable digital receipt. That unforgivable digital receipt is pushed back to bitcoin l one, along with the updated state saying, hey, Alice no longer has that one bitcoin. Now Bob has it. Here's the unforgivable digital proof that this actually occurred. And from bitcoin's perspective, it's essentially saying, well, I have no idea what happened off chain, but just prove to me, mathematically, prove to me that you followed the rules of my consensus that no more than 21 million coins were created, that Alice actually did have the funds, that all of the signatures were valid. And if you can mathematically prove that to me, then I will allow you to update the state on the l one. Meaning I will allow the kind of.
00:35:42.746 - 00:36:23.014, Speaker A: Now Bob has the one bitcoin analysis no longer does. Functionally, the way this kind of works on bitcoin is on the l one, you would have what's called like a shared Utxo. This is essentially like the roll up contract in Ethereum world, where users can pool their funds into the shared Utxo, and then those funds are represented in the l two, where all this computation and the zero knowledge proof and everything is essentially completed. It was typically assumed that in order to create some sort of shared Utxo structure, you would need a software called recursive covenants. However, there are proposals to potentially create something like this.
00:36:23.052 - 00:36:26.086, Speaker E: If you had a ZKP verifier with.
00:36:26.108 - 00:36:33.018, Speaker A: BitVm, we now potentially have the ZKP verifier. So hopefully that's making sense, where we could potentially create these shared utxos on.
00:36:33.024 - 00:36:34.986, Speaker E: The l one, we can perform all.
00:36:35.008 - 00:36:42.230, Speaker A: The computation in the ZK proof and submit it back to the l one, and then you can use Bitvm to verify that Zk proof.
00:36:42.390 - 00:36:45.326, Speaker E: If you have that, then you can build a roll up.
00:36:45.428 - 00:37:36.046, Speaker B: All right, so before we get to bitvm, could you just like. So, I am not as familiar with kind of the bitcoin. I'll call it generally layer two community, but I don't know if these are legit layer twos or not. Right. And what you would say, and I'll say first, we run across the same problem, of course, in all of crypto and in Ethereum, where everybody wants to be a layer two, but oftentimes they're just side chains with multi six. And so it's hard to get past the marketing speak and get to actually, the technical details of, is this really a layer two? And then that's even more obscured by the fact that some legitimate layer two projects are still not fully layer two, if that makes sense. Like, they still have some training wheels on, some guardrails on, and they're working to decentralize over time, but the technology is such that they can become kind of fully decentralized or much more decentralized layer twos in the future.
00:37:36.046 - 00:37:50.254, Speaker B: So I'm just trying to find out what's real in the bitcoin, kind of quote unquote layer two community. So something like stacks, is that a layer two? Something like rootstock, is that a layer two? Are these kind of more like side chain types of networks?
00:37:50.302 - 00:38:08.550, Speaker A: I mean, they're more like side chains. There's kind of multi sigs or. They don't necessarily anchor to bitcoin. Did quasi call them layer twos? And I guess they are, but for me personally, it's like, no, I want this path towards fully trustless, like ZK roll ups. And the closest thing we could possibly get there is some sort of integration with BitVM.
00:38:09.130 - 00:38:26.554, Speaker B: Okay, so aside from BiTVM, are there any sort of layer twos? And the ethereum definition of a layer two is basically it has to be kind of secured, settled by the base layer, or be on a trajectory towards being fully decentralized. Is there anything else besides BiTVM?
00:38:26.682 - 00:38:29.326, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, in terms of the level of trust that you guys would.
00:38:29.348 - 00:38:31.390, Speaker E: Want, the only thing is lightning network.
00:38:32.930 - 00:38:37.698, Speaker A: Lightning network, from security assumption standpoint, is very strong, but it just comes with.
00:38:37.784 - 00:38:39.410, Speaker E: So many other pitfalls.
00:38:39.990 - 00:39:01.818, Speaker B: Okay, so we've been talking so much like you've been alluding to this BitVM project. Like, what is it? Where did it come from? Why are you so excited about it? You don't work for the project. So I think you're looking at this from a bitcoiner that's very excited about this building renaissance, and you're just kind of evaluating this, and you're like, this is the future. But, yeah, give us some context for this.
00:39:01.904 - 00:39:02.666, Speaker E: What is it?
00:39:02.768 - 00:39:53.302, Speaker A: Yeah, so BitVM is a way to verify any arbitrarily complex, like Turing complete contract on bitcoin. And the keyword there is verify, not necessarily execute. And so if you read the VM white paper, there are two key references in there. The first is optimistic rollups, and the second is taproot, which was the last bitcoin software. So, as you guys know, an optimistic roll up performs this computation off chain, and then it submits the results of that computation back on chain along with the data. And you optimistically assume that it is valid. And if somebody says, hey, I do not believe this is valid, I believe that you lied, then they can use the data that was posted on l one to create a fraud proof and say, hey, this is incorrect, and then the transactions are essentially rewound.
00:39:53.302 - 00:40:21.954, Speaker A: So worst case, the transactions get rewound, the fraud gets discovered. But because of the game theory, you assume that it's going to work correctly. BiDVM is similar, except it's not actually posting transaction data on l one. Instead, what it's doing is it's committing on chain in a bitcoin transaction to perform a certain set of computations, and it will do this off chain, and it says, I will perform all of this computation, and then it will do.
00:40:21.992 - 00:40:24.258, Speaker E: It off chain in kind of a.
00:40:24.264 - 00:40:53.578, Speaker A: Prover verify setup where there is approver that's performing this off chain. And then if they do not perform that computation, then the verifier can take a piece of that and submit it to the bitcoin l one and say, hey, here is fraud. They didn't follow this computation, and the prover, just like an optimistic roll up, essentially gets slashed. The way that this works, because bitcoin doesn't have any sort of scripting language, and it can't verify these kind of complex programming languages, is interesting.
00:40:53.744 - 00:40:56.366, Speaker E: So most programming languages, I think pretty.
00:40:56.388 - 00:41:38.986, Speaker A: Much all of them, like, for example, like take Python is built in a hierarchical manner where Python was built on top of, like, c, which was an extension of C, which was built on assembly. And it goes all the way down to kind of the circuits or the binary bits, where literally, if you have two wires and they're going into what's called, like a gateway, if two of those wires have electricity pulsing through them, maybe the gateway lights up. Maybe for other types of gateways, if one wire is on, one wire is off, the gateway lights up. The point is that these small little electrical signals in these gateways create the basis for, like, zeros and ones in binary language. And then that binary language, it becomes the basis for letters and further numbers and then all these codes. So what bitvm is doing is it.
00:41:39.008 - 00:41:41.066, Speaker E: Could take some sort of code, say.
00:41:41.088 - 00:41:45.194, Speaker A: Like a ZKP verifier, and it will break it down to its fundamental components.
00:41:45.242 - 00:41:47.646, Speaker E: Down to those little binary gates, and.
00:41:47.668 - 00:42:41.006, Speaker A: Then it will commit all those binary gates into what's called like a taproot tree, which this is a Merkel tree. So if you imagine like an upside down or just kind of like a pyramid structure where you have the root, and then you have all the binary trees, you would have this massive tree that has all the different chunks of this essentially code, and you can embed that into a bitcoin transaction. And so in this situation, again, the prover is putting money at stake, and they're saying, I will compute all of this ZKP verifier off chain. And if you feel that I am lying, then you can submit a single small transaction as part of one of these taproot trees or part of this Merkel tree, and you can identify that as fraud. And if I'm found to be fraudulent, then you can slash and take my funds. So you could have a situation where you have one prover, you have a thousand different verifiers, and you yourself could.
00:42:41.028 - 00:42:42.598, Speaker E: Be one of the verifiers.
00:42:42.794 - 00:42:50.820, Speaker A: And what this essentially allows is you're optimistically creating a ZK verifier. If that makes.
00:42:52.870 - 00:43:06.726, Speaker B: Does. I think it does. I'm going to have to do some more research on this myself and ask some other folks. Let me ask you that. The BitVM project, how close is it to mainnet? This is beyond the white paper.
00:43:06.828 - 00:43:08.458, Speaker D: Is that even the right question to ask?
00:43:08.544 - 00:43:09.180, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:43:11.070 - 00:43:22.940, Speaker A: I follow a lot of the telegram chats pretty closely. It seems like they're making progress. I don't want to hold them to anything, but I think we could be looking at this stuff within a year or less.
00:43:23.630 - 00:43:29.600, Speaker D: Is main net like the right phrasing for this, or is there a more precise word?
00:43:30.690 - 00:43:32.430, Speaker A: I'm not sure what we would call it.
00:43:32.580 - 00:43:47.470, Speaker B: Well, there would have to be some chain that I can interact with that is some sort of virtual machine type chain, whether it's EVM or something else that ultimately settles to bitcoin or is that not what you're describing here, David?
00:43:47.550 - 00:44:34.542, Speaker A: So I mean, all of this computation for BITBM, it's happening off chain, it's happening, just know, on a server or a computer or anything, you don't need any sort of blockchain because again, you're kind of like optimistically assuming that this stuff is being done. So you're saying, look, how do I want to say this? Here's all this code that I'm essentially going to run. Like, before you run it, you say, here's all this code that I am promising you I'm going to run, and you're breaking that down all into the binary parts, and you're submitting that into the bitcoin blockchain. You're committing to it. You're basically saying, I am committing ten bitcoin that I'm going to run and operate this code off chain. And so what's happening off chain is the prover is running it and the verifier is simultaneously verifying. All this is outside of a blockchain, this little game that they're playing.
00:44:34.542 - 00:45:03.866, Speaker A: There's a lot of kind of interactivity that's happening between these parties. But if the verifier discovers and says, hey, you're being dishonest, they can go through and they can arbitrate that on the bitcoin chain and be like, hey, do you remember you committed ten bitcoin to execute this? You committed and you promised that you would execute it this way. And I'm now providing a fraud proof to the bitcoin chain, proving that you did not follow the code, and that's how they essentially punish or slash the off chain computation.
00:45:03.978 - 00:45:07.326, Speaker B: David, does this sound a little bit like Nibra to you?
00:45:07.428 - 00:45:07.886, Speaker A: I'm not sure.
00:45:07.908 - 00:45:10.240, Speaker B: What is the Nibra project that we've talked.
00:45:11.410 - 00:45:47.334, Speaker D: It's a proof aggregation layer. No, I don't think like, I think what I'm trying to get my head wrapped around is because with arbitram and optimism, you and I are very used to alternative blockchain networks that are blockchains that settle down to Ethereum, and it's another entire parallel system. And I don't think that's what's going on here. It's not a blockchain. Right. Exploring the world of expressive layers on top of bitcoin. You can't really take your Ethereum frame of mind and apply it to bitcoin.
00:45:47.334 - 00:46:25.320, Speaker D: You can start there, but the outcome is completely like, there's just some things that don't cross over the chasm in terms of what they look like on Ethereum when they're applied to bitcoin. It's just like a different construction. For example, David, the nature of the computation that would occur in a bit vm, like layer two, it's not going to be like NFT trading on a layer two. Or maybe it is, but even if it is, it's going to look different. Right. Maybe you can help continue this conversation. How is the different nature of layer two computation going to be like on.
00:46:26.970 - 00:46:54.114, Speaker A: To maybe help this? I think Ryan's having trouble thinking that this is like this off chain computation on blockchain. And I'm thinking in the context of roll ups, approver is not a blockchain. You have this blockchain, but then you're taking all that and you're putting in this hyper centralized just like prover. And that's kind of what's happening on the bitvm side. It's not a blockchain whatsoever. You're performing it all off chain, which just means on a separate computer.
00:46:54.312 - 00:47:02.542, Speaker B: Okay, so bitvm is more a prover, it's not an entire chain, but you could just use the prover to validate the entire chain.
00:47:02.606 - 00:47:03.220, Speaker E: Right.
00:47:03.990 - 00:47:06.898, Speaker D: Are layer twos on bitcoin's blockchains?
00:47:06.994 - 00:47:42.874, Speaker A: Yes. So what BitVM is really focuses on is the bridge to get you to this l two blockchain. So there'd really be two different ways that I think people envision using BitVM. One is like that traditional roll up setup that we talked about where you have the l one contract, you have the l two blockchain. It compresses the computation as ZK proof. And then there has to be something to receive and verify that ZK proof. So that little bridge component right there that exists or can be arbitrated by the l one to verify the ZK proof.
00:47:42.874 - 00:47:49.646, Speaker A: That is one use case of BitVM. And you could build a true or kind of like a more traditional ZK.
00:47:49.678 - 00:47:50.578, Speaker E: Roll up that way.
00:47:50.664 - 00:48:25.386, Speaker A: The other way that people could use BitVM is just to build a bitcoin bridge. Instead of using WBTC or federation, you could bridge bitcoin, say, into some sort of wrapped ethereum ecosystem, or you could bridge it into another side chain, and it has that same trust assumptions where you only need to trust one honest party out of, say, a thousand, as opposed to a federation. And you can bridge it into another chain and maybe that chain. You then build roll ups. On top of that, you have a settlement layer. You have 20 different roll ups. They're all using the same ZK circuit.
00:48:25.386 - 00:48:46.978, Speaker A: You're getting the cross composability, all the kind of advanced topics that you guys are talking about. That's the potential for it. So to recap that, you could create a ZKP verifier that's arbitrated by bitcoin and just have a roll up that settles directly onto the bitcoin l one. Or you can create a pegged version of bitcoin with the same trust assumptions, and then in that new ecosystem, you.
00:48:46.984 - 00:48:48.770, Speaker E: Could build roll ups on top of that.
00:48:48.920 - 00:49:19.262, Speaker D: Okay, so it sounds like the emphasis that you're trying to place on is that this is a bridge primitive. But what is on the other side of that bridge? Bitcoin is on one side of the bridge. What's on the other side of the bridge? What's on the other side of the bridge could be a whole open field of innovation where it could be a blockchain, it could be like a tokenized implementation of bitcoin elsewhere. It sounds like it's up to developers to imagine what could be once on the other side of that bridge, once we have that bridge standard developed by the BitVM team. Is that fair?
00:49:19.316 - 00:50:07.614, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. And that's why I think I started off this conversation describing that idea of the chasm, right? Like you're crossing the chasm and where I mentioned that bridge that we're building both like a technical bridge and a metaphorical bridge. And if you're willing to trust that bridge, this one of n trust assumption, this kind of like optimistic as opposed to validity proof type setup. And if you can cross that bridge and you can cross that chasm, then you are into the new frontier, right? And could you build a bridge to ethereum? And everybody's like, well, hey, we don't want any of this stuff on bitcoin. We just want a trust minimized way to use bitcoin on ethereum. Maybe that's the route some people go, and maybe some people say, no, I want true roll up where you're posting the data directly on bitcoin. Maybe other people say, we want this settlement layer where we have this world of different roll ups that are all cross composing with each other.
00:50:07.812 - 00:50:08.414, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:50:08.532 - 00:50:15.162, Speaker A: BiTVM enables this kind of design flexibility, again with that caveat of the one of n trust assumption.
00:50:15.306 - 00:50:33.026, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess more my question was, why don't they just attach a chain to it? Then they're doing the work of creating the bridge. This is essentially what arbitrum or optimism have done, is they've done the kind of the bridge piece, but then they've also just slapped a chain on it, too. Is that out of scope for Bitvm?
00:50:33.138 - 00:51:05.858, Speaker A: I think for the BitVM team it's probably out of scope, but there are a lot of people who are very excited about using BitVM for that exact use case where they want to use it as a bridge to their chain. And there are some people that are doing the traditional roller path, and there are other people that are using it for side chains. But, yeah, I don't think Robin and the BitVM team is building a chain themselves. They kind of want to let a thousand flowers bloom. Like, Robin is on record saying a world of an arbitrary amount of side chains, all with different experimentations, like a free market of side chains is kind.
00:51:05.864 - 00:51:07.218, Speaker E: Of his vision, right?
00:51:07.304 - 00:51:07.554, Speaker B: Yes.
00:51:07.592 - 00:51:57.490, Speaker D: Okay. The metaphorical bridge that you're talking about is landing way harder for me now. It's like, once you get over this, once you build the literal bridge, you get into the land of just like, hey, what's on the other side of that bridge? What's on that destination is a startup that can actually raise to build something that they see as cool and unique and something that they want to see for bitcoin, maybe that's not your vibe, but maybe market forces are asking for a different product or solution on the other side of that potential bridge implementation. Well, we can go build that, too, I think maybe on net. What's on the other side of this bridge that is being built by the BitVM primitive is expressivity. You can have expressivity on the other side, and it's up to the bitcoin builders to decide what they want to build, either by market forces or their own intrinsic curiosity or whatever.
00:51:57.560 - 00:52:26.326, Speaker A: Yeah, and to be clear, there are teams building all the stuff that you're talking about. There are built teams, like building these other environments and these different design trade offs. But once we get over that bridge, then we get into all the fun stuff that you guys are talking about. We talked about data availability layers. You talk about what different type of execution environments you want. Maybe somebody wants to build a proof of stake style bitcoin chain that specializes in NDA, all that stuff. You can have one thing that we didn't mention, just so the audience knows.
00:52:26.358 - 00:52:27.818, Speaker E: It's like a roll up in and.
00:52:27.824 - 00:52:34.734, Speaker A: Of itself is not like a magic bullet. Right. Because you still have to post that data, in theory, onto the bitcoin l one.
00:52:34.772 - 00:52:36.846, Speaker E: And because the blocks are, they're not.
00:52:36.868 - 00:53:01.606, Speaker A: 1 mb, they're technically four megabyte. A pure roll up could probably still only get, like, I'm going to guess anywhere from ten to maybe like 50 x. Improvement in scaling if you're posting all of the data on the l one. So that's still pretty good. It's not bad. It can expand self custody, it can make things a lot cheaper. But eventually bitcoin is going to have to go down the same path that Ethereum is going down, where it's like you're going to have these dedicated data availability layers and that gets a little.
00:53:01.628 - 00:53:03.350, Speaker E: More advanced, a little more nuanced.
00:53:04.170 - 00:53:28.750, Speaker D: Okay, so David, you presented this as if people are willing to accept the end of one trust assumption, then we can eventually get to this world of expressivity on bitcoin. Do you think the bitcoin set of people that's a pill to swallow? How big is that pill to swallow? Will people swallow that pill?
00:53:29.570 - 00:53:30.526, Speaker E: Yeah, I do.
00:53:30.548 - 00:53:32.270, Speaker A: I think it's going to be absolutely massive.
00:53:33.410 - 00:53:41.230, Speaker D: You think people are going to largely as a whole, like the laser eyed maxis aside, bitcoin is going to accept this end of one trust assumption?
00:53:41.310 - 00:53:57.506, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean I think it's good enough to get us there again to cross that chasm. And then you can get the fully ZK verified cross composable chains with the beautiful UX and the forked Ethereum smart contracts. I think that's going to be good enough. And I think that there are beginning.
00:53:57.538 - 00:54:01.018, Speaker E: To be use cases that even the.
00:54:01.024 - 00:54:39.670, Speaker A: Most ardent of bitcoiners are like, that's kind of dope. I think that's one of the criticisms of side chains is side chains were like a little bit ahead of their time. None of the good applications really came out until defi summer. And yeah, there was so much freaking grift and so much scam and so many shitty products. But the idea of being able to borrow against your bitcoin at 0% interest in a liquidy style with a very small origination fee provably over collateralized, that is badass account abstraction. Wallets is like another great one, obviously sending private payments, being able to earn yield.
00:54:41.770 - 00:54:42.998, Speaker E: There are teams like, I'll give a.
00:54:43.004 - 00:54:44.310, Speaker A: Shout out to botanics.
00:54:44.970 - 00:54:47.206, Speaker E: They're doing this thing where you could.
00:54:47.228 - 00:55:31.826, Speaker A: Stake bitcoin, you can earn yield on it and it would create like a two way peg to another chain. And so they were thinking about building like an EVM chain and I was like, guys, look at what eigenda is doing. You could stake your bitcoin, you could create this separate layer. You could have a dedicated data availability layer that all of the roll ups use and settle to. It's earning real fees because people are paying to use that blob space and all the roll ups can be built on it. You can have a decentralized Amm perpetuals platform that is going long the proof of stake bitcoin and short in the perpetuals, and you can create the inverse perpetual stablecoin. This whole world, it really gives new life to the bitcoin monetary maximalist.
00:55:31.938 - 00:55:34.566, Speaker E: Right now, all of these people are.
00:55:34.588 - 00:56:12.558, Speaker A: Complaining about ordinals and inscriptions, and it's like taking away from the spam is like increasing fees, and it's like pricing out monetary use cases. It's like, well, you need a scaling solution that aligns with a higher fee environment where we can create economic density, where you could have dedicated roll ups that do tons of transactions and tons of defi and tons of privacy, and you could batch all of that, and you're willing to bid way more than any of the inscription people in order to place your roll up transactions onto the l one. That's how you beat out all this kind of arbitrary data on the l one. And I think so many bitcoiners are just missing that. It's like, all right, guys, chill. We're going to build it, and you're.
00:56:12.574 - 00:56:13.460, Speaker E: Going to be happy.
00:56:15.030 - 00:56:53.918, Speaker D: Okay, so the world that you're describing, kind of. I've always thought that building on bitcoin is like building in a wasteland, just because the whole entire construction of bitcoin is just, like, optimizing for simplicity. It's a philosophy of subtraction rather than addition. Make bitcoin simpler, make it harder to build on bitcoin. Just have BTC the asset. That's always been my kind of philosophy of how bitcoin has grown. But what you're showing me is that, well, maybe that was true with the bitcoin base layer, but once you build this bitcoin vm thing, it goes from building in a wasteland to just like, fish in a barrel, whereas, like, well, there's all this other innovation that so many other ecosystems have already built.
00:56:53.918 - 00:57:24.234, Speaker D: So we already have a lot of the ideas and the research and development out of the way. Now we just have to build it. So it's just like, at some point, you just can't miss, like, da on bitcoin, somebody's got to go build that, right? I don't know, optimistic roll up or zk. Roll up on bitcoin, somebody just goes and builds that, right? So a bitcoin builders renaissance, we've already seen the culture start to shift this way. What are some of the ideas that are super hot right now? What are people building that's very hyped in bitcoin world? If Ryan and I were big bitcoiners. What would we be excited about?
00:57:24.352 - 00:57:26.810, Speaker B: Give us the next five episodes. Bitcoin.
00:57:28.110 - 00:57:31.946, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I'm a bit biased here. I wrote an article in Bitcoin magazine.
00:57:31.978 - 00:57:35.706, Speaker E: Where I kind of talked about bitcoin.
00:57:35.738 - 00:58:07.046, Speaker A: Back stablecoins, and I referenced liquidity even. I talked to my most hardcore bitcoin Maximus friends. I'm like, oh, you call yourself a bitcoiner, you're never going to sell your bitcoin until you have to. I'm like, you're selling your bitcoin? I'm borrowing against it, and I'm doing it without a custodian, and I'm doing a 0% interest. I'm more of a bitcoiner than you. I'm holding longer than you poke at them, of course. And then even if you get into this world, inevitably there are going to be people who.
00:58:07.046 - 00:58:26.394, Speaker A: They're just not ready for bitcoin. They're like, I'm living in freaking Argentina off of like $5. I can't sit here and be having like a crazy volatile asset. They're like, I need stablecoins. And if you can say, well, hey, look, here's this stablecoin. It's decentralized, it's provably backed by bitcoin. It can't be censored.
00:58:26.394 - 00:58:38.418, Speaker A: That is a nice little ramp for them to get into this world. And then as they get savings, they can invest it into bitcoin. It's like all this stuff that you guys have been talking about. I just think it's a better fit on bitcoin and we're going to bring it.
00:58:38.584 - 00:58:39.282, Speaker E: That's cool.
00:58:39.336 - 00:58:39.554, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:58:39.592 - 00:58:55.974, Speaker B: Is there anything else? Like, I've heard of restaking protocols on bitcoins. Like one's called Babylon that's across my desk before. Obviously, there's kind of like everything that's going on with ordinals and BRC Twenty s and that kind of thing. Anything else that we should keep our eyes open to?
00:58:56.172 - 00:59:32.686, Speaker A: Yeah, pretty much. Just take all of your guys'prior podcasts and things that you're excited about and say we can bring them on bitcoin. I think account abstraction wallets, I'm very excited about. I'm also really excited about the prospect. I mentioned this in the tweet. This is pretty far future facing, but if you could use something like storage proofs to kind of trustlessly give an attestation from a data availability layer, you could use something like Celestia or like a dedicated bitcoin da layer, and you could relay that information trustlessly to the bitcoin l one. And that just kind of eliminates the risk of some of these data availability layers.
00:59:32.878 - 01:00:15.170, Speaker B: David, this has been a fascinating conversation. This is exactly what I hoped for when I opened up that tweet, and I didn't expect you to reply. And I just want to thank you for replying. I mean, from my perspective, bitcoin is maybe starting to get interesting again. I sort of left it off as sort of a store of value, and it's an uncensorable store of value, and that's great. One part of the bankless journey, but it was missing Defi, it was missing expressivity, it was missing all of the potential that Ethereum has unleashed. And if you're telling me that it's starting to get that back again, and there are some ways where it can start to follow more closely something, its own version, but something closer to the Ethereum roadmap, that to me is very exciting and leads to a more bankless future.
01:00:15.170 - 01:01:00.878, Speaker B: I guess I got to ask though, David, are there more of you out there? Because I think the overwhelming message from what this social layer, at least that is loudest in bitcoin, does not talk in the way that you are talking, is not a listener to the bankless podcast necessarily, is not focused on building, is very focused on kind of like monetary properties and like Robert Breedlove style, which is fantastic, right? But just like is not talking about this sort of thing and is thinking, still thinking that lightning is going to solve everything, all of the bitcoin scalability problems and yeah, are there more people like you actually digging in and coming up with these new roll up style solutions on bitcoin? How many of you are there?
01:01:00.964 - 01:01:27.366, Speaker A: I mean, you could probably comment on one hand. No, in all seriousness, it's a small but growing movement. The problem is there are some projects out there that are trying to hijack this narrative that really are not the true builders. It's for sure grifting, it's for sure scams. And I think people need to really have their guard up not to go like full on bitcoin maximalist, but like.
01:01:27.468 - 01:01:29.318, Speaker E: This stuff is real, but a lot.
01:01:29.324 - 01:02:09.186, Speaker A: Of the stuff you will end up seeing on Twitter is definitely not. And Ryan, kind of what you were remember, I forget it was a podcast you guys had like many years ago, and somebody came on and just really applauded you guys and said when you guys were getting into like, nobody gave a shit about Ethereum. It wasn't even like, hey, that was a bad idea. It's like, dude, we don't even want to talk about Ethereum. Why are you guys doing this right now? And you stuck to your guns because you understood the potential and the revolution. And you said, I don't care, will die on this hill, because I essentially believe in it. And there is that small contingent of us that feel the same way about what is potentially happening in bitcoin.
01:02:09.186 - 01:02:45.198, Speaker A: And sometimes I look back and I'm like, oh, man, if I found bitcoin in 2011 or whatever, I have had the conviction to stay in it. And the answer is probably not. Who knows? But back then, you don't have the foresight of all of this development work that's already been done, of all of the podcasts, of all of the articles. But that's kind of how I feel about this whole broader l two renaissance and what's possible in the bitcoin world. I don't care if it sinks or swims. I'm pretty sure it's going to be very successful. But even if it's not, this is ideas worth pursuing.
01:02:45.374 - 01:02:49.806, Speaker E: We are freaking missionaries, not mercenaries.
01:02:49.918 - 01:02:53.460, Speaker A: And if people disagree with, it's like, bring it on. I'm on Twitter all day.
01:02:55.030 - 01:03:24.234, Speaker B: Well, I love that that level of conviction is going to get you and the small but growing tribe quite far and totally applaud it. I mean, this is very much bankless aligned, I would say. Very excited to have more bankless money systems built on top of bitcoin. So, David, I'm going to ask people, I'll include in the show notes, a link to your Twitter account, because I was not following you before this. My mistake. But I am now following you. And you, my friend, are going to be my bitcoin signal.
01:03:24.234 - 01:03:24.782, Speaker B: I hope.
01:03:24.836 - 01:03:25.006, Speaker A: So.
01:03:25.028 - 01:03:41.234, Speaker B: I can start to parse out what's. You're the go to now, bitcoin Dave. So, like, with that power comes great responsibility. Please do not lead us astray. Show us where the true decentralized roll ups are building on bitcoin. And thank you so much for your time today.
01:03:41.352 - 01:03:54.694, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks, guys. I do want to give a quick shout out to people like Robin, Linus, Alexey, Orkin. These are like the true builders. And people, if they follow me and see their names, those are real deal people.
01:03:54.812 - 01:03:55.414, Speaker E: There you go.
01:03:55.452 - 01:04:08.134, Speaker B: Of course. Satoshi, who started it? All right. Right. Bitcoin Dave or them. Yeah. The Twitter handle is David underscore Sea Roy. So D-A-V-I-D underscore C Roy.
01:04:08.134 - 01:04:16.220, Speaker B: Got to end with this. Of course, crypto is risky. You could lose what you put in, but we are headed west. Frontier is not for everyone. But we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
