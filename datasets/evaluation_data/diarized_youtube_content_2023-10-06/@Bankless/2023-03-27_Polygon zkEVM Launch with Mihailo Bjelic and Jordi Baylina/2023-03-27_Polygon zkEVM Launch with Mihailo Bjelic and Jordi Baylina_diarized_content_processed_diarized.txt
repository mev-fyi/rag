00:00:04.170 - 00:00:30.562, Speaker A: Hey, bankless nation. Welcome to another episode of State of the Nation. We're talking today about scaling ethereum with the Polygon ZKE EVM that was just announced today. David couldn't make it for this episode, so I am solo with Mahalo and Jordy from the Polygon ZKE EVM project. Really excited to dive into this conversation. A few things we're talking about of course, as we said before, this is ZKE EVM season. We had zksync on Friday.
00:00:30.562 - 00:00:49.078, Speaker A: Today. The polygon ZKE EVM is now out. So we talk about it as we get into this episode. We're about to discuss what just dropped today. So what you can use today. Then we discuss ZK rollups versus optimistic rollups, which ones are better and for what purposes. We also discuss what happens to the Polygon proof of stake chain.
00:00:49.078 - 00:01:14.450, Speaker A: We discuss the new frontiers and opportunities that this unlocks. And of course, we talk about the future of the Matic token. One disclosure before we get in. I am an advisor of the Polygon project, been supportive of this project for a long time and excited to see what they're doing here. Okay guys, we're going to get right to the episode with Polygon, but before we do, I want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible, including Kraken, Bankless's number one recommended crypto exchange for 2023.
00:01:14.520 - 00:02:03.826, Speaker B: Kraken has been a leader in the crypto industry for the last twelve years. Dedicated to accelerating the global adoption of crypto, kraken puts an emphasis on security, transparency and client support, which is why over 9 million clients have come to love Kraken's products. Whether you're a beginner or a pro, the Kraken UX is simple, intuitive and frictionless, making the Kraken App a great place for all to get involved and learn about crypto. For those with experience, the redesigned Kraken Pro app and web experience is completely customizable to your trading needs, integrating key trading features into one seamless interface. Kraken has a 24 7365 client support team that is globally recognized. Kraken support is available wherever, whenever you need them by phone, chat or email. And for all of you Nfters out there, the brand new Kraken NFT beta platform gives you the best NFT trading experience possible.
00:02:03.826 - 00:02:24.726, Speaker B: Rarity rankings, no gas fees, and the ability to buy an NFT straight with cash. Does your crypto exchange prioritize its customers the way that Kraken does? And if not, sign up with Kraken@kraken.com slash Bankless. How many total airdrops have you gotten? This last bull market had a ton of them. Did you get them all? Maybe you missed one. So here's what you should do. Go to Earnify and plug in your Ethereum wallet.
00:02:24.726 - 00:02:51.342, Speaker B: And Earnify will tell you if you have any unclaimed airdrops that you can get. And it also does poaps and mintable NFTs any kind of money that your wallet can claim. Earnify will tell you about it. And you should probably do it now because some airdrops expire. And if you sign up for Earnify. They'll email you anytime one of your wallets has a new AirDrop for it to make sure that you never lose an AirDrop ever again. You can also upgrade to Earnify premium to unlock access to Airdrops that are beyond the basics and are able to set reminders for more wallets.
00:02:51.342 - 00:03:20.406, Speaker B: And for just under $21 a month, it probably pays for itself with just one AirDrop. So plug in your wallets at Earnify and see what you get. That's ear NiFi, and make sure you never lose another AirDrop. The phantom wallet is coming to Ethereum. The number one wallet on Solana is bringing its millions of users and beloved UX to Ethereum and Polygon. If you haven't used Phantom before, you've been missing out. Phantom was one of the first wallets to pioneer Solana staking inside the wallet and will be offering similar staking features for ethereum and polygon.
00:03:20.406 - 00:03:54.274, Speaker B: But that's just staking. Phantom is also the best home for your NFTs. Phantom has a complete set of features to optimize your NFT experience, pin your favorites, hide your Uglies, burn the spam, and also manage your NFT sale listings from inside the wallet. Phantom is, of course, a multi chain wallet, but it makes chain management easy, displaying your transactions in a human readable format with automatic warnings for malicious transactions or phishing websites. Phantom has already saved over 20,000 users from getting scammed or hacked. So get on the Phantom Waitlist and be one of the first to access the MultiChain beta. There's a link in the show notes.
00:03:54.274 - 00:03:57.462, Speaker B: Or you can go to Phantom app Waitlist to get access.
00:03:57.516 - 00:04:13.660, Speaker A: In late February, Bankless Nation, I am super excited to introduce you yet again to Mahalo, who is the co founder of Polygon, and also Jordy, who is the technical lead for Polygon Hermes, otherwise known as the Polygon ZKE EVM. Jordy, Mahalo, how you guys doing today?
00:04:14.530 - 00:04:15.214, Speaker C: Very good, thanks.
00:04:15.252 - 00:04:16.080, Speaker D: Very good.
00:04:16.770 - 00:04:23.578, Speaker A: You guys just dropped something big. We got some news. Let's start there. What just happened? The polygon. ZKE EVM.
00:04:23.754 - 00:04:24.094, Speaker D: What?
00:04:24.132 - 00:04:25.140, Speaker A: Just hit us.
00:04:26.070 - 00:04:27.266, Speaker D: I'm going to hand it over to.
00:04:27.288 - 00:04:33.460, Speaker C: Jordy first because he's the one who created this amazing technology. So let him start and maybe I can add something.
00:04:34.970 - 00:05:11.898, Speaker E: Well, maybe it's a milestone. So this is a milestone for scaling ethereum. That's what's happening. So if we go two years ago, scaling ethereum was I mean, nobody knew how to do it. Actually, it was two years ago after a blog from Vitalik that people started realizing how to do that. And then we started with roll ups and start talking about optimistic rollups ZK rollups, especially in the ZK. Then we started to build only payments roll ups.
00:05:11.898 - 00:06:10.622, Speaker E: But the big challenge here was to do Zkvn so an ethereum compatible so something that works exactly the same, that ethereum, but scales, which is what needs scaling ethereum. And here is where the challenge started. And, well, we started that two years ago. Not even two years ago and has been a long trip. It's a short trip, maybe in time, but it's a long trip in engineering, in going deep in solving problems and in figuring out how to bring this technology practical. And today it's not the end of the road, it's a milestone. But just putting this technology, creating the system and making it available in the real system in mainnet, it's really an important achievement.
00:06:10.622 - 00:06:19.718, Speaker E: And this is what's happening today. And this is why we believe this is an important moment for the Ethereum community.
00:06:19.804 - 00:06:51.194, Speaker A: So this is an important moment for Ethereum because we've been on the quest in crypto to basically scale our trustless technology to scale Ethereum for the past, what, eight years. I mean, since the inception, since Ethereum's birthday, it's been a long time. And before that we were even trying to scale bitcoin. And now we've come this far. We've got this new technology called ZK technology. We've built an EVM around it so we can have ZK layer twos that are programmable. And what just launched, as I understand it, is the polygon ZK EVM.
00:06:51.194 - 00:07:00.420, Speaker A: And when you guys say launched, do you mean on main net? Is this available for users? Mahala. What just launched this morning? What can people go do right now?
00:07:00.790 - 00:07:34.170, Speaker C: Yes, it's a great question and it's important to state that this is an actual main net, right? So we have been running Zkvm on testnet for months already with very good results. We learned a lot. We have more than, I believe, 7000 applications and smart contracts deployed thousands of transactions and thousands of users have already tried testnet with test assets. Right. We are now hitting the main net. It's the actual Mainet and we are fulfilling, I would say, or ticking all the checkbox that you would normally expect from a full blown Mainet. So these are real actual assets.
00:07:34.170 - 00:08:02.102, Speaker C: Bridged from layer one, the Zkvm is full featured. We have multiple external and internal audits. Prover is running. All code is visible with the permissive open source license. So basically it's a full featured, complete, full blown Mainet. I would say it's important to state and Jordy can add to that, this is a Mainet beta and this is a very, very complex, bleeding edge technology for us. It's very important in this moment.
00:08:02.102 - 00:08:55.240, Speaker C: We are incredibly excited and incredibly proud that we have been able to ship this bleeding technology. And as you probably know, and many people familiar with the matter know that estimates were that it's going to take three to five years probably to ship this technology. And even then it was uncertain whether it's going to be practical, what will be the computational requirements, will we need data centers to run these provers, how everything will turn out? We're very excited and very happy that we have full featured Mainet with very practical prover. We have been running prover. The whole testnet basically is running. The prover is running on regular AWS instances that are costing us, I believe, around $2 per hour. So this is really practical technology, and we are very happy about all of this.
00:08:55.240 - 00:09:30.450, Speaker C: But all that being said, we really want to advise caution to users of the main net. This is bleeding edge technology. This has never been shipped. Polygon is the first one to put this into production. Now, we're excited about that, but users should be mindful when bridging especially larger amounts of assets to mainnet. So that's something that is very important for us to communicate. Every code, every complex code, needs some time to mature, and this technology will certainly need some months to become really battle tested and proven.
00:09:31.030 - 00:10:26.610, Speaker A: I want to definitely emphasize that, guys, and we'll have time to discuss sort of security, but when Mahalo says bleeding edge, bleeding means you can get and so, you know, be cautious. As we enter here, we'll talk about security, the status now, and where you want to evolve that to and how it becomes safer in that trajectory. But before we do, let's talk about a user and what they can experience on Polygon ZKE EVM right now. And just to refresh people, mahalo is absolutely right. We've been talking about the Holy Grail of the ZKE EVM for a while. So we have some ZK technology that allows us to do sort of simple, transaction based, kind of back and forth bitcoin type of things. But we haven't had the technology previously to create a general purpose EVM, which is the programmability that Ethereum brings to the market.
00:10:26.610 - 00:10:48.934, Speaker A: And now we have that, and that's ahead of schedule. I want to emphasize that, I mean, two years ago, the crypto world was saying, I don't know, this is five years away. Can it even be done? Is it ten years away? And now we're here. So that's why this is so monumental. But let's get back to kind of the users for a second. Our analogy at Bankless for a new layer two that opens is we got a theme park. Everyone's in line with the theme park.
00:10:48.934 - 00:11:07.426, Speaker A: The gates open. You can go start to use the rides now. Right now, they may be dangerous rides. You might have a roller coaster that kind of is tossing people off, people getting jostled around a little bit. All right, so there's some danger. But tell us about the rides. What can people do when they enter the gates of the theme park today? Do.
00:11:07.426 - 00:11:24.530, Speaker A: I just go and I set my MetaMask RPC to polygon ZKE EVM, and then I can start using apps. What are the apps like? What's the user experience like? Is this just like the Polygon proof of stake network? Can you tell us about that first, Mahalo?
00:11:24.690 - 00:11:58.020, Speaker C: Yeah, very happy to answer that. The great thing about Zkvm, and let's just take one step back and explain why Zkvm has been considered the Holy Grail of scaling, because it is a technology that simultaneously offers three very, very important features. One is scalability. The second one is security. So we get to increase throughput significantly without sacrificing security. We'll full blown leverage the security of Ethereum. And the third very important component or feature is EVM compatibility or equivalence, if you will.
00:11:58.020 - 00:12:39.178, Speaker C: The third component actually makes things incredibly easy for developers and users. Ethereum EVM is the standard for web free programming, right? And it's already a mature ecosystem. There are wallets like MetaMask, developer tools like Remix, Hardhat. Solidity is already a pretty mature language and all of that. So there's this whole ecosystem that has been built around EVM Zkvm. One fantastic thing about it is that it's completely leveraging all these tools and this whole experience. And both developers and users simply continue to use these networks in the same manner like they use Ethereum.
00:12:39.178 - 00:13:14.010, Speaker C: So developers just simply take their existing Solidity contracts. They can deploy them on Zkvm using the same tools like Remix, like Hardhat. There are basically no differences for developers and for end users. End users simply connect their MetaMask. They submit transactions in the same manner like they would do on Ethereum. It's absolutely the same developer and end user experience with a comparable level of security and with much lower fees and much higher scalability. So yeah, all in all, we're very, very excited and we believe this is a very important milestone.
00:13:14.830 - 00:13:16.358, Speaker A: What would you add to that, Jordy?
00:13:16.454 - 00:13:54.130, Speaker E: Yeah, to highlight to that because this is very important. We are using exactly the same tooling. That means that we are not maintaining a parallel version of Hardhat to work in our system or a parallel version of MetaMask or a Matte parallel version of Solidity compiler. So we are using the Solidity, the Ethereum Solidity compiler, we are using the Hard Hat. We are using whatever tooling that you have and we are using that tool. We are not maintaining any of those tools. Those tools are maintained by the third parties.
00:13:54.130 - 00:14:15.166, Speaker E: And this is what defines the EVM because we are executing the EVM is Ethereum virtual machine, okay? And this is Ethereum virtual machine. We are being fully compatible with this.
00:14:15.188 - 00:14:18.640, Speaker D: Bytecode and this is what allows to.
00:14:19.490 - 00:14:27.186, Speaker E: Use any of this tooling. So any of the systems of Ethereum smart contract you don't need to compile again the smart contract. You just take this smart contract and.
00:14:27.208 - 00:14:28.146, Speaker D: You deploy it there.
00:14:28.248 - 00:14:57.050, Speaker E: So it's like an extension of Ethereum. It's not a new thing. It's extension of ethereum. And this simplicity because I remember that the first time that I was doing a presentation about the Zkvm, I feel like but you just connect to Remix, you just deploy some smart contracts, everything. I mean, there was nothing new in there. People know how to deploy smart contracts when you see the difference. But this is the magic.
00:14:57.050 - 00:15:12.670, Speaker E: And this is the cool thing of this project is that the users don't notice the difference on deploying on Ethereum or in Sdkbn, except of course on the price and on the throughput.
00:15:13.970 - 00:15:38.090, Speaker A: Is it accurate to say guys, that everything that is available on the Polygon proof of stake network, like all of the smart contracts, all of the apps, all of the things that you can do there, you can fairly easily or maybe perfectly easily port those over to or duplicate those on the Polygon ZKE EVM. Is that what we're talking about here?
00:15:38.240 - 00:16:37.100, Speaker E: Yeah, most of them. Just to be very clear, mainly we have some precompiled smart contracts that are not implemented yet. We are working on that and we are going to implement in the next version we are talking about Paddings or we are talking about Shadow 56 or some extended. So if your smart contract is not using this you can just copy them, I mean just deploy here, deploy there. The same way that you can deploy something in Polygon POS or you can deploy that in Mainnet or you can deploy that in goldly or in any other Ethereum network, you can deploy it in Ckvm here there is these exceptions of these recompiled smart contracts they are not used very much, most of them. So I would say most applications should not have any problem. But we are working on that and we hope that in few months we can extend that so that every time we are going to be more compatible on that.
00:16:39.390 - 00:17:02.734, Speaker A: Can you guys underline this for me or for listeners rather? So why would someone want to deploy on Polygon ZKE EVM versus the Polygon proof of stake network? Why would an app want to be there? Why would a user want to be there? Is there a difference in terms of the underlying security guarantees? Can you highlight what that difference is and tell us about that? Mahalo?
00:17:02.862 - 00:18:01.206, Speaker C: Yes, of course. So we have made this commitment a while ago that in Polygon we will commit all our resources, all available resources to push the frontier of innovation and to ship more reliable, more performant and more secure technology. And we always have known that Polygon Pi chain is not the end game. Right? This is very dynamic industry, fast evolving industry and Zkavm is the next generation of scaling technology that is more advanced, more secure than Polygon POS chain itself. And that's the main motivation here. Why would someone want to migrate, for example, from Polygon POS chain to Zkvm when we speak about mainnet, people would want to migrate from mainnet to Zkvm because there's higher throughput and there are lower fees without sacrificing security. So yeah, all in all, this is the next generation tech and we are not stopping here.
00:18:01.206 - 00:18:15.430, Speaker C: As Jordy said, this is a very monumental, very important milestones. Milestone. But we have very exciting plans for the future as well. This is not still the end game but it's a very important, very big milestone.
00:18:15.510 - 00:19:06.650, Speaker A: So endgame technology but we're not at the end game. We're just at kind of chapter one of it. What happens to the Polygon proof of stake chain? So I think there's been some conversation on Twitter for instance that hey, when Polygon ZKE EVM comes out maybe the Polygon proof of stake chain kind of migrates to this technology. I don't know if that's how you see it. I know Polygon has always seen itself as a set of technologies to scale Ethereum whether it's using side chain type technology or whether it's using ZK type technology in layer. I mean obviously the Polygon proof of stake chain has reached tremendous success and is one of the most used chains in crypto. What happens to it? What's the roadmap for the proof of stake chain? Is it now legacy tech? Mahalo.
00:19:06.990 - 00:19:27.490, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a great very important question. I would say certainly and be completely honest I would say Polygon POS chain is a legacy tech. We always wanted it to be legacy tech and we knew when we started then I don't know three or five years down the line we have to be embarrassed by that technology. So to say if you're not embarrassed that means we haven't done our job well.
00:19:27.560 - 00:19:27.842, Speaker E: Right?
00:19:27.896 - 00:20:04.494, Speaker C: This is again very dynamic industry and we constantly want to push this frontier of innovation and ship better technology. That being said Polygon PHN is not going away. It's not becoming irrelevant. There is I believe strongly clear need for both networks in the market. So there are certain trade offs that I'm going to just explain very briefly. DeFi applications might want to definitely deploy to Zkvm because Zkvm offers ironclad security. It's fully secured by Ethereum submits since it's a roll up.
00:20:04.494 - 00:21:00.240, Speaker C: It also submits user transactions to Ethereum which gets stored there to ensure data availability of these transactions. However Zkvm the throughput is limited by submitting because we're submitting these transactions to Ethereum right? That's always going to be the bottleneck and always going to increase the costs of transactions because you have to pay Ethereum gas to store this transaction data. So ZK rollups will always have a little bit more limited throughput and a little bit higher transaction fees for DeFi applications. For example that doesn't really matter if you have a lending application for many of the applications for example lending market you take a loan and then you repay a loan six months down the line. Right? So for you security is the priority. There's a lot of economic value here in these applications so I will say Zkvm is the right choice for me. It's highest possible level of security.
00:21:00.240 - 00:21:48.686, Speaker C: And I don't mind that transactions are a little bit more expensive when you have something on the other side of the spectrum like polygon POS chain where you have for example web free games with in game assets which are on chain and they are not really highly valuable. But these games have a lot of users and frequent transactions. They might say POS chain is still a very good choice for us because it offers much higher throughput much lower fees and that's perfectly fine for some of these use cases. So I believe these two sets of trade offs or features for these two networks will remain relevant for different types of applications. That's how we see it. And just basically because we can maybe just throw a little bit of alpha there because you're always inviting us and.
00:21:48.708 - 00:21:52.400, Speaker A: You'Re always if you have alpha, please.
00:21:54.370 - 00:22:24.618, Speaker C: We are experimenting. We cannot confirm or commit to anything formally yet, but we are experimenting how we can leverage ZK technology. Given now that Jordy's team has shipped Zkvm, we're exploring how we can potentially leverage ZK technology on the POS chain itself, which will give it renewed even more obvious relevance moving forward. But we cannot share anything officially yet, but we are actively exploring that as well.
00:22:24.704 - 00:23:25.338, Speaker A: It's very cool. Okay, so just to go on what you said, maybe if you could give some order of magnitude estimates. These are just estimates, but let's say transferring ETH on main net cost a dollar and in kind of a layer two roll up, like an optimistic roll up, maybe it costs five cents or ten cents, five to ten, something like this. Okay? And then if we go to polygon proof of stake chain, that's going to cost far less than a fraction of a fraction of a penny. So very inexpensive. What are we looking at for polygon ZK EVM? Is that going to still be in kind of like the layer two optimistic roll up range as far as cost per transaction or is it going to even deliver an order of magnitude of lower cost versus that? I don't know if any of you guys have estimates on kind of the numbers here, but this is how users view it. They're like, okay, it's going to cost me a dollar on main net, $0.10
00:23:25.338 - 00:23:29.630, Speaker A: on a layer two. How much is it going to cost me on polygon ZKE EVM?
00:23:31.090 - 00:24:15.050, Speaker E: Currently we are about the same. That other roll ups, I mean, it's like one 10th of the cost of Ethereum, I mean, depending on the transactions because for example, that availability. We need to pay the full price and depend on the transaction. But it's going to be around one 10th, one fifth, something between that. So it's one order of magnitude. At the beginning we have plans to improve the technology and with the current technology, without doing anything, we can increase one order of magnitude just by compressing transactions. And when IP 4844 happens to Ethereum, this would be at least another order of magnitude.
00:24:15.050 - 00:24:33.838, Speaker E: So here is like we have like three levels and of course a sharding, like probably another the, but we see that at the level. So if you see how Ethereum it is, we can scale easily two, three orders of magnitude for sure. In the upcoming years jordy.
00:24:33.854 - 00:25:13.540, Speaker A: Another question I think are in people's minds is we have some experience with layer twos now. All right, for the last 18 months or so, I think Arbitrum was the first layer two that deployed. It's an optimistic roll up which is different than a ZK roll up. Optimistic roll up versus ZK roll up. What you guys are providing is a ZK roll up, a ZK EVM fully programmable. What are the benefits? Can you discuss kind of the trade offs or the benefits? Why is a ZK in what ways is a ZK EVM better than an optimistic roll up? If that's even the right question to ask.
00:25:14.390 - 00:25:34.966, Speaker E: The big difference here is the withdrawal time. The withdrawal time in an optimistic role you need to wait one week, two weeks or three weeks just for this challenging game to happen. And in the Z case, this can go maybe, I don't know, can go.
00:25:34.988 - 00:25:38.738, Speaker D: Maybe to five minutes or just even a few seconds.
00:25:38.834 - 00:26:24.790, Speaker E: So you can be very fast. You may think that this is okay if you are there. It's why you need to live there. But there is one thing that's interesting and it's the interconnection when you want to composability between these different networks. So what means when you composability between different networks is that you need to maybe just have different networks and transfer phones from here to there and from there to here and just work in different days. That means that you are leaving the layer two and going to another layer two. So in ZK roll up you can do that really fast and you can transfer and you can connect a lot of networks easily.
00:26:24.790 - 00:26:54.866, Speaker E: This is in an optimistic way, you cannot do that. I mean, you need to buy these challenging games and the things get much more complex when you want to play that. This is one of the advantages. The other is of course the cost of capital. I mean, there is this game and the security is based on the quantity of capital that the mystery routes have in there. This has its cost. Of course in the proverb we have the proving cost.
00:26:54.968 - 00:26:57.554, Speaker D: But this is getting really low right.
00:26:57.592 - 00:27:33.066, Speaker E: Now so it's becoming very insignificant. So for the rest they are very much equivalent at the end. They are roll ups and things there is a lot of things in the compression, in the compression with the zero knowledge we can compress much more than in optimistic roll up. So even the prices are going to go lower on the future. So the future of course, decay roll ups, they are coming later because developing this decay technology takes its time and needs to work. But at the moment that where we.
00:27:33.088 - 00:27:36.318, Speaker D: Are, that we somehow we solve this technology.
00:27:36.484 - 00:28:00.200, Speaker E: When I'm saying solve, I mean, there is a lot of challenges pending but it's like but we have to prove it now. I would say that optimistic roll ups for me makes not much sense because at the end it's the same. But you have this proof that you don't need to wait to that's the that's the thing that this allows you to do many more things.
00:28:01.770 - 00:28:44.270, Speaker A: This is why advocates of ZK EVM have kind of pointed to these two advantages. So I'll just kind of summarize and highlight, like, advantage. One of a ZK technology is you can dial it and optimize it far larger. So even though you're starting with this, like it's five times cheaper, ten times cheaper than Ethereum main net, you're saying you can push the technology and push the compression, push the cryptography to get transactions from five cents to fractions of a penny. And you have more leeway to do that, that compression than on an optimistic roll up. And the second piece, I think, is important because people could see this in at least the US. Banking system, which, as you know, sucks.
00:28:44.270 - 00:29:26.058, Speaker A: Hence the name bankless settlement times. If I want to wire money from one bank to another internationally, could take three to five days. Like there's a settlement time attached to that. A similar settlement time actually happens with an optimistic rollup because rather than having it settle in kind of like the Fed now or whatever, master central bank settlement engine underlies all of the banking systems, you kind of have to settle this on Ethereum Mainnet. Right. Optimistic rollups, that takes days right now, because there's the fraud proof, there's this crypto economic mechanism. With ZK technology, you're able to just take the shortcut and you can settle on mainnet in minutes.
00:29:26.058 - 00:30:17.886, Speaker A: And then that becomes very important when we talk about chain to chain, layer two to layer two types of interactions. And so that is kind of the network benefit that we're also excited about with ZKE EVMs. The other thing I'm kind of excited about is you guys are launching, of course, Polygon's not a new chain, so it's well known polygon is well known for its business development. And I'm just reading a list of things that you guys are launching with phantom Trustwallet, Dbank, Rainbow Wallet, Connect Xerion. These are some of the partners that you're launching with, which is also very exciting. Mahalo, maybe you could speak to kind of the ecosystem that Polygon has fostered in general and how much of that business development that Polygon is so credited for will kind of bleed over and get leveraged by this new Polygon ZKE EVM?
00:30:18.078 - 00:30:40.294, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a great question. Absolutely. What we see first, we're already seeing a huge level of organic interest for Zkvm. Zkvm is really the bleeding edge technology. I think in general, there is consensus about that in the industry. So first of all, we're really seeing high, high level of interest. People want to use this bleeding edge, the most advanced technology that we have in the industry.
00:30:40.294 - 00:31:48.826, Speaker C: Now that's number one. Number two, Polygon Labs, as you rightly said, is. Doing, I believe, great job in onboarding web two companies, big enterprises, traditional companies, from all industries to web free. And I believe Polygon Labs will continue to do that as well, especially now when we have even more advanced technology. The third thing that is important to mention here is that these two networks, especially because of these benefits that Jordy mentioned of how convenient is to interconnect these ZK secure chains we believe very soon you will be able to observe polygon POS chain community and zkvm community and ecosystem as one single, very interconnected ecosystem, practically like a single ecosystem. And that is very important. One specific to say specifically what I'm talking about is we have something that we call internal Lxly bridge, which is a bridge that enables seamless message exchange between two ZK Secure networks.
00:31:48.826 - 00:32:03.182, Speaker C: And assuming we're able to leverage ZK security for Polygon POS chain with Lxly Bridge, these two networks practically become one network when it comes to moving assets, information, any sort of arbitrary messages, tokens, et cetera.
00:32:03.326 - 00:32:09.480, Speaker A: Is that the idea, Mahalo, of a layer three that people have talked about, or is that sort of something different?
00:32:10.250 - 00:32:42.990, Speaker C: What is great about this Lxly Bridge implementation, and Jordy maybe can chime a little bit more because it transforms all these Ek Secure chains into a mesh. There is no anymore layer two, layer three, layer four, layer 16. This bridge enables seamless connectivity between any two networks that participate within this ecosystem. So you can transfer from layer two to layer 16 back to layer one on Ethereum, or it doesn't really matter anymore.
00:32:45.730 - 00:32:58.754, Speaker A: So Ethereum would be a layer one, and then rather than layer 2345 and six, layer two is just this mesh of all sorts of other layers and it's all kind of economically secured in the same way. So it's all a mesh of layer two, basically.
00:32:58.952 - 00:33:15.990, Speaker C: And that's what we need. Ideally, I think we cannot achieve mass adoption if these chains live in some sort of isolation. We need all this mesh of networks to become a single, homogeneous execution layer, right, that can support massive adoption.
00:33:16.070 - 00:33:23.102, Speaker A: Well, that is how the Internet works. So mesh networks are pretty important. Jordy, what would you add to mean?
00:33:23.156 - 00:34:07.562, Speaker E: For me, it's funny people talking about layer three when we don't even have a layer first, let's build first a layer two. I think that with ZK technology, with a good ZK technology, you don't need that much the layer three. And you can I mean, this is what we're talking about. We can build all this mesh of networks and all of that connecting one each other. Of course, you can always build layer three on top, but for me it's like, okay, and layer 15, it's like, let's build layer two. Layer two, let's put some of these networks, let's connect these networks together. Let's see how we transfer one each other and let's learn how all this thing will work.
00:34:07.562 - 00:34:35.074, Speaker E: And then we think about layer three. But for me, from the technical perspective, it's okay. It's like because layer twos are not good enough, because maybe the proof is too expensive, or maybe because you have these delay times that it makes. And let's build a layer three so that we can bypass these limitations of the layer two and so on. But we have a very good layer two, so we have an extremely good layer two.
00:34:35.112 - 00:34:37.134, Speaker D: So let's see what we can get.
00:34:37.192 - 00:34:45.666, Speaker E: I mean, I don't want to discard layer three because it's perfectly possible, but I think that the industry should focus in layer twos.
00:34:45.778 - 00:35:15.694, Speaker A: Well, whatever the marketing folks decide to end up calling these things from a buzword and narrative perspective. Right. The vision we're talking about is a layer two mesh network that is secured by Ethereum, which is super exciting. Guys, we have a few more things to cover, including how this ZKE EVM is different from some of the others that have come to market and are coming to market recently, and also the risks. We said we would get back to that. So if you bridge, what are the risks? We need to conclude by talking about the Matic token. Of course.
00:35:15.694 - 00:35:20.818, Speaker A: But before we have all of those conversations, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:35:20.984 - 00:36:02.094, Speaker B: Uniswap is the largest on chain marketplace for self custody digital assets. Uniswap is, of course, a decentralized exchange, but you know this because you've been listening to Bankless. But did you know that the Uniswap web app has a shiny new Fiat onramp? Now, you could go directly from Fiat in your bank to Tokens in DFI inside of Uniswap. Not only that, but polygon, Arbitrum and optimism. Layer twos are supported right out of the gate, but that's just DFI. Uniswap is also an NFT aggregator, letting you find more listings for the best prices across the NFT world. With Uniswap, you can sweep floors on multiple NFTs, and Uniswap's universal router will optimize your gas fees for you.
00:36:02.094 - 00:36:48.010, Speaker B: Uniswap is making it as easy as possible to go from bank account to bankless assets across Ethereum, and we couldn't be more thankful for having them as a sponsor. So go to app Uniswap.org today to buy, sell or swap Tokens and NFTs. Arbitrum One is pioneering the world of secure Ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the web3 landscape. Hundreds of projects have already deployed on Arbitrum One, producing flourishing DFI and NFT ecosystems. With a recent addition of Arbitrum, nova gaming and social DApps like Reddit are also now calling Arbitrum home. Both Arbitrum One and Nova leverage the security and decentralization of Ethereum and provide a builder experience that's intuitive, familiar and fully EVM compatible.
00:36:48.010 - 00:37:39.994, Speaker B: On Arbitrum, both builders and users will experience faster transaction speeds with significantly lower gas fees. With Arbitrum's recent migration to Arbitrum Nitro, it's also now ten times faster than before. Visit Arbitrum IO, where you can join the community, dive into the developer docs, bridge your assets, and start building your first DAP with Arbitrum experience web Three development the way it was meant to be secure, fast, cheap, and friction free. Learning about crypto is hard until now. Introducing MetaMask Learn, an open educational platform about crypto, web Three, self custody, wallet management, and all the other topics needed to onboard people into this crazy world of crypto. MetaMask Learn is an interactive platform with each lesson offering a simulation for the task at hand, giving you actual practical experience for navigating Web Three. The purpose of MetaMask Learn is to teach people the basics of self custody and wallet security in a safe environment.
00:37:39.994 - 00:38:06.790, Speaker B: And while MetaMask Learn always takes the time to define Web Three specific vocabulary, it is still a jargon free experience for the crypto. Curious, user friendly, not scary. MetaMask Learn is available in ten languages with more to be added soon, and it's meant to cater to a global Web Three audience. So are you tired of having to explain crypto concepts to your friends? Go to learn MetaMask IO and add MetaMask Learn to your guides to get onboarded into the world of Web Three.
00:38:06.940 - 00:38:25.630, Speaker A: All right, we're back. How is the Polygon ZK EVM different than some of the other ZKE EVMs that are coming to market recently? Mahalo. What's the competitive advantage here? What is the secret edge? Or how have you approached this problem in the way that other solutions haven't?
00:38:26.370 - 00:39:12.620, Speaker C: Yeah, first of all, I just want to say that we are very excited that we see multiple Zkvm projects in the ecosystem that's very useful for everyone, primarily for Ethereum. And again, we're very excited to see that. We're also very excited, and we strongly believe that Jordy's team has found a very good balance between this EVM equivalence and what do we mean by it? And practicalities of the network. So there are different approaches here that maybe even Jordy can cover or I can cover. But the point being is that we were able, I think, to strike the great balance where we're fully, really compatible with Ethereum. All the tools are working, both developer tools and end user tools. As we said, solidity works out of the box.
00:39:12.620 - 00:39:46.610, Speaker C: There's zero impact on developer and user experience, and at the same time, we delivered something. It's not like we're one year far. It's not like it's impractical. It's not like you need a data center. You're just creating proofs today on a commodity cloud instances. Right. So I think it's more about the balance that we were able to strike and then some great engineering and cryptography breakthroughs that our team has achieved on this path.
00:39:46.610 - 00:39:58.826, Speaker C: And it has been really incredibly exciting being part of the process and observing the great energy and all these breakthroughs and everything. And I think when you just look at the facts, polygon Zkvm is the.
00:39:58.848 - 00:40:00.826, Speaker D: Only one that is now on the.
00:40:00.848 - 00:40:45.082, Speaker C: Mainet with real world assets, full featured apart from pairings, as Jordy said, the code is fully open source, fully visible, prover is running. Every transaction is being proven and verified on ethereum layer one. So basically multiple audits, both internal and external of all the components of the Zkvm, including the prover, including circuits. So I would say all these important checkboxes that you would expect for a full blown Mainet polygon Zkvm is ticking them. So yeah, I think that's just the state of the matter at the moment. But I can leave to Jordy maybe if he wants to add some more.
00:40:45.136 - 00:41:03.120, Speaker A: Yeah, jordy, I'm curious, what do you make of this? Some people have called this the ZKE EVM wars that are going to come. Of course the benefit of these wars is decentralization and ethereum. Certainly we all kind of benefit from this. But what do you make of this? What is the polygon competitive advantage here?
00:41:03.570 - 00:41:32.700, Speaker E: Yeah, we are climbing a mountain. I mean when you are climbing a mountain and it's the community that's claiming a mountain, of course somebody there is people in the community that maybe are probably in the marketing side and want to fight. But at the end we are cleaning the mountain together. We all want this. Technology becomes available to the society. So it's talking about competition. There are different projects and when there is a challenge like that.
00:41:34.830 - 00:41:35.466, Speaker D: Even from.
00:41:35.488 - 00:42:11.478, Speaker E: The engineering perspective, there is different ways to approach the problem and they are not good or bad a priority. You start with something, you see the ideas, you imagine how the system is and then you just go one way and other engineer is going to do a different way and even the starting points are not the same. I mean sometimes when we started the project, for example, we had some technology, we had some technology available. Okay, other projects maybe started before they started later and maybe they started without.
00:42:11.564 - 00:42:14.454, Speaker D: A given technology or they are starting.
00:42:14.492 - 00:42:47.842, Speaker E: Later and they have a technology that was not available when we're starting. So even the starting points were not the same and we are better in the beginning. So all the projects are trying to do their best to try to solve this problem in different matters. So for me it's full respect to all the systems but said that there is a lot of difference. A lot. It's just different approach, different ways, different teams doing a different thing. What I would recommend and here is maybe for the technical people, if you don't care about the technical but what I would recommend to the technical people.
00:42:47.896 - 00:42:50.466, Speaker D: Is just for example, go to the.
00:42:50.488 - 00:43:29.520, Speaker E: Source code and try to deploy, just try to deploy your work. Just go to Gordly or polygon POS or that's cheap. Sometimes it's even cheaper than Wordly. I don't know that but it's like the thing but just go to a network, just try to get the prover, get the node get the synchronizer, get the database and just go to all the different pieces they are available. There you can compile there you can see there you can see how they work. And the good thing is that you can use that. And at least in our side, our spirit is.
00:43:31.650 - 00:43:32.926, Speaker D: To give as much as.
00:43:32.948 - 00:43:37.474, Speaker E: We can to the community. So to take as much as we can and to give as much as we can.
00:43:37.512 - 00:43:41.266, Speaker D: And this is the spirit that we have.
00:43:41.448 - 00:43:46.494, Speaker E: The cool thing is that doing that if we do that between different projects.
00:43:46.542 - 00:43:47.780, Speaker D: We can learn a lot.
00:43:48.650 - 00:43:53.334, Speaker E: I'm sure that there are things that other projects are doing better than us.
00:43:53.372 - 00:44:01.078, Speaker D: And we can learn. And I'm sure that we are doing things that are better than others and they can learn. And if we get in this spirit.
00:44:01.094 - 00:44:02.170, Speaker E: Of collaboration.
00:44:03.950 - 00:44:07.290, Speaker D: The full system will go much faster.
00:44:07.630 - 00:44:18.990, Speaker E: Here we have a good example, for example, internally polygon. In Polygon we have three teams working separately in three different projects.
00:44:19.410 - 00:44:26.180, Speaker D: But we have been collaborating a lot between these projects and this collaboration. I would say that.
00:44:29.350 - 00:44:30.146, Speaker C: The result of.
00:44:30.168 - 00:44:35.362, Speaker D: This collaboration is that we could go much faster the fact that for example.
00:44:35.416 - 00:44:38.374, Speaker E: We are using the proving system of.
00:44:38.492 - 00:44:40.758, Speaker D: Polygon Zero or we are using the.
00:44:40.764 - 00:44:44.214, Speaker E: Stars the same way that Polygonmiden is using.
00:44:44.412 - 00:44:46.886, Speaker D: We are sharing the technology, we are.
00:44:46.908 - 00:44:51.430, Speaker E: Sharing the things, we are sharing the technology without barriers, without any competition.
00:44:51.510 - 00:44:56.810, Speaker D: It's just okay, I explain you everything I know about this and you explain.
00:44:56.880 - 00:45:00.286, Speaker E: Everything about know about that. And this collaboration, I think is the.
00:45:00.308 - 00:45:29.830, Speaker D: Key of the succeed of the success of this project, of the Polygon. We should be able to export this model to the fuel community because I personally believe that if we work together and if we work together means just working together in sharing the knowledge one each other, not competing but sharing, that's the way that we can go faster.
00:45:31.210 - 00:46:10.482, Speaker A: I agree with that. Crypto likes to be so tribal at times, but ultimately guys, this for bankless listeners, it's us against the banks. It's decentralization versus centralization. And the benchmark on whether we're successful or not is how long we have protected decentralized assets and how much has entered the system. Right? It's kind of the lindy effect of time and also value that we have unlocked in the decentralized ecosystem. And kind of that brings me to the risks which we talked about earlier. Okay, so security is top of mind and this is the benchmark ultimately for success for all.
00:46:10.482 - 00:46:52.320, Speaker A: ZKE EVMs and I know Mahalo said this is bleeding edge. Like people haven't done this before. This is a first, all right? And there's some really moon math magic stuff that I'm not sure many people on the planet fully comprehend on how it all works underneath in the engine here. And so my question to you is what are the risks? Is there the risk, for instance, that there is a hack that all assets transferred kind of go to zero. Is that a real risk right now? And what is polygon ZKE EVM doing to mitigate those things?
00:46:56.060 - 00:46:56.810, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:46:59.740 - 00:47:15.096, Speaker E: Let'S see. First of all, re zero is not but this is not even about polygon. I mean, it's on any system in the world. Okay? So what you are trying to do and what we are trying to do, and I think what all the projects.
00:47:15.128 - 00:47:22.576, Speaker D: Are trying to do is at least a serious projects is spend, invest as.
00:47:22.598 - 00:47:41.284, Speaker E: Much as we can in security. That means just audits, internal audits, bug bounties, code reviews between peers, I mean, whatever formal testing. So whatever we can and whatever is in our hands, we put there.
00:47:41.482 - 00:47:50.792, Speaker D: But we need to understand also that the security so if you don't take a risk, certain risk at a given.
00:47:50.846 - 00:47:52.836, Speaker E: Point, the security is not going to evolve.
00:47:52.948 - 00:48:02.940, Speaker D: Security is also get evolved when you assume some risk. So here measuring how much risk you want to assume.
00:48:03.600 - 00:48:07.710, Speaker E: So what are these probabilities, these risk want to assume in order to grow.
00:48:09.620 - 00:48:21.490, Speaker D: This is probably one of the most difficult things in the space because it's measuring this low risk is difficult in our case.
00:48:21.860 - 00:48:43.284, Speaker E: I can explain you the risks. So how we think about risks. Okay, so here in the Ckbm, we distinguish between four kind of risks. What we call smart contracts risk, what we call correctness risk, what we call soundness risk and what we call stop prover. The proverb stops.
00:48:43.332 - 00:48:43.784, Speaker D: Okay?
00:48:43.902 - 00:49:15.044, Speaker E: Smart contracts is like any other smart contract. It's a smart contract and the smart contract can have bucks. And the cool thing here is that the community after the launch of Ethereum, well, still some bucks, but we have a lot of knowledge and there is a lot of auditing companies, there are a lot of procedures. It has been audited two times. Check it with the right code and the probability, I would say that it's relatively low. But again, if there is something wrong.
00:49:15.082 - 00:49:18.404, Speaker D: In the smart contract, things can go bad.
00:49:18.602 - 00:49:21.876, Speaker E: But like any other smart contract is.
00:49:21.978 - 00:49:25.160, Speaker D: No difference here than any other smart contracts.
00:49:25.980 - 00:49:32.324, Speaker E: The other thing is the completeness, this is probably the most critical part. The completeness means that you are proving.
00:49:32.372 - 00:49:35.450, Speaker D: Something that goes to a wrong state.
00:49:37.580 - 00:49:46.524, Speaker E: But this is a determination. This is in general is that measuring that you put a transaction and this transaction the result of this estate because.
00:49:46.562 - 00:49:54.210, Speaker D: How you program the state goes that you have more money that would be really bad for this.
00:49:56.020 - 00:50:08.676, Speaker E: Again, zero risk doesn't exist. But here I'm quite confident mainly and this is thank you very much to.
00:50:08.778 - 00:50:11.140, Speaker D: Ethereum and to the theorem test suite.
00:50:11.880 - 00:50:36.110, Speaker E: We not only did the full audit, the full audits, but we are also passing all the Ethereum tests of the theorem test suite. So if we are passing, I mean, we can guarantee that we are passing this Ethereum suite. So it could be something really weird for this to happen there.
00:50:37.280 - 00:50:40.544, Speaker D: Okay? So all the things together this give.
00:50:40.582 - 00:51:30.704, Speaker E: Us quite confidentiality here. For this risk we are also at least at the beginning, we want to disable that at some point. But in this beginning training width here we're going to run a kill switch multisig with many people kill switch, we should remove that at some point. But if we see some we are checking some balances and if we have some checks that if we see something that goes wrong we can switch the network on this side. But again, I see here a relatively low probability. Okay. The others are Somnes somness is probably the most tricky one because it's not that you are doing the things okay, it's that you are checking that all the things are okay.
00:51:30.704 - 00:51:45.844, Speaker E: And it's very difficult, it's very easy to forget some of the checks, okay? And a soundness mistake in the provers is relatively easy to do it. And here we don't have so the community has not much experience here to.
00:51:45.882 - 00:51:48.516, Speaker D: Auditing and to check here.
00:51:48.698 - 00:52:03.530, Speaker E: Here we did a huge effort again with audits and reviews and we correct a lot of these Solness errors, okay? But here the cool thing, is that in the system, the idea is that.
00:52:04.220 - 00:52:07.464, Speaker D: If a soulness error is detected by.
00:52:07.502 - 00:52:09.052, Speaker E: The smart contract and that means that.
00:52:09.106 - 00:52:13.676, Speaker D: If there are two proofs so if.
00:52:13.698 - 00:52:19.468, Speaker E: There are two proofs that coming from the same state and with the same transactions. They go to two different states and.
00:52:19.474 - 00:52:21.612, Speaker D: You are able to prove two things.
00:52:21.666 - 00:52:22.708, Speaker E: This is a solve the server.
00:52:22.744 - 00:52:25.984, Speaker D: And what we do is we just.
00:52:26.022 - 00:52:29.484, Speaker E: Call the network and we go centralized.
00:52:29.532 - 00:52:34.016, Speaker D: We shut down the network and then an update should be done. Okay?
00:52:34.198 - 00:52:36.068, Speaker E: And the other protection is that at.
00:52:36.074 - 00:52:38.484, Speaker D: The beginning we are going to be.
00:52:38.522 - 00:52:40.630, Speaker E: The only prover that's running the system.
00:52:41.000 - 00:52:42.896, Speaker D: Unless we stop doing the proof.
00:52:42.928 - 00:53:09.070, Speaker E: So there is a mechanism that if in five days we are not generating approves, anybody will be able to generate approved. But if we are running the proof and we are not going to prove something wrong. So this is the other mechanism. So that's why sonnet even being more probable to happen in some mistakes, which is not good because that would mean that the system is centralized but the risk is that the system is centralized, not that the user will lose money.
00:53:10.160 - 00:53:11.356, Speaker D: Centralized will fix.
00:53:11.458 - 00:53:51.404, Speaker A: I get it Jordy. And there are fallbacks for some of these cases, of course. And I think you've done a great job outlining kind of the risks of not just the polygon ZK EVM, but all EVM technology and to some extent all layer twos. One thing I'll say to you listeners is I remember there was a time when people said a programmable blockchain would never work, okay, because it would have bugs, smart contracts would never work. And then what happened? There was a Dow event, there was a reentrancy type bug, and everyone was saying, ha, we were right. Smart contract blockchains, programmable blockchains will never work. And now look at us.
00:53:51.404 - 00:54:11.260, Speaker A: Okay, they do work. We've got strong lindy effects. The issues have been dealt with and we get stronger and stronger over time. I expect a similar trajectory. Not that there won't be bumps in the road. There could be bumps in the road, but we're talking about the long game here. And look, cryptography programmable blockchains can scale.
00:54:11.260 - 00:54:29.480, Speaker A: We've already seen that proven. Guys, we got to be quick on the last question here, but I want to know about the Matic token. How is Matic involved in the polygon zkevm? What's its role? Do you pay gas fees in Matic? What's the relationship between Matic and Ethereum and something like Polygon ZKE EVM?
00:54:29.820 - 00:54:58.396, Speaker C: Yeah, so a great question and great to close the interview with that. So first of all, when it comes to gas fees, we're using Ether for gas fees. That's what community prefers. It makes user experience even better. And we're using Ether as the gas fee token in Zkavm itself. That being said, Polygon's native token Matic will have a critical role in the whole Polygon ecosystem that we are establishing right now. So currently we're starting with a centralized sequencer.
00:54:58.396 - 00:55:53.280, Speaker C: This delivering Zkvm itself was the grand goal. We just wanted to prove that it's possible and we're starting with a centralized sequencer improver. Like all other rollups in the Ethereum ecosystem, this network needs to be decentralized and Matic token will play a critical role in that decentralization of the network as well as in tying the whole Polygon ecosystem. We already touched in this interview on this multitude of chains, right? We even have this concept of dedicated chains which are supernets, Polygon POS chain, Zkvm. All these networks will coexist in a very interconnected way and Matic will play a critical role in facilitating and securing that whole ecosystem. We will be sharing, I believe, very exciting news in the next couple of months and our views and proposals, how everything will fit together, because that's what Community is now wondering. One question.
00:55:53.280 - 00:56:16.680, Speaker C: You already mentioned how Polygon POS chain is relevant. Now after Zkvm, what about supernets? How these all components that you're working on, how they all come together and the token itself will play a critical role in our mind in connecting all these things together. And we're very excited to share with you and with the Community in the following months everything that's been happening behind.
00:56:16.750 - 00:56:18.072, Speaker D: The scenes, kind of.
00:56:18.206 - 00:56:38.032, Speaker A: We will stay tuned for that. Guys, I just want to say congrats on the launch. This is a huge milestone, big accomplishment, cheering you on. I mean, as advocates for decentralization and bankless money systems, this technology is pivotal in our ability to scale it. So well done on the launch. Fantastic news, very exciting. Can we end with this.
00:56:38.032 - 00:56:51.940, Speaker A: Then, before I let you go, what can listeners do to get started on Polygon ZKE EVM? Is there a website they should go to? How do I bridge across from Ethereum to the ZKE EVM? If I feel so inclined?
00:56:52.520 - 00:56:54.790, Speaker D: Yeah, Jordy, I'll leave it to you.
00:56:55.820 - 00:57:03.640, Speaker E: I'm just looking for the link. But you just go to the bridge. If you go to just one moment.
00:57:03.790 - 00:57:12.456, Speaker A: How about this, Jordy? We will make sure to include it in the show notes for sure. I know you're busy building and doing other things, but we'll have it in the show notes for you, Bankless listeners.
00:57:12.488 - 00:57:35.430, Speaker E: Yeah, just go. So just go to the bridge zkbmrpc. Comlogin and there you can start the breach and just connect your MetaMask and you are there. Just go to remix deploy your smart contracts. Just do some mean, just work as a normal network and it's really easy.
00:57:37.800 - 00:57:46.564, Speaker A: New Bankless frontiers opening up for you as we speak. This is now available. Jordy, mahalo. Thank you so much for coming on Bankless and telling us more about it.
00:57:46.762 - 00:57:47.416, Speaker D: Thanks so much.
00:57:47.438 - 00:57:48.644, Speaker C: Ryan, always a pleasure.
00:57:48.772 - 00:57:59.980, Speaker A: Gotta end with this. Of course, none of this has been financial advice. ETH is risky, so is ZK technology. All of DeFi is really you could lose what you put in. But we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone.
00:57:59.980 - 00:58:02.650, Speaker A: But we're glad you're with us on the Bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
