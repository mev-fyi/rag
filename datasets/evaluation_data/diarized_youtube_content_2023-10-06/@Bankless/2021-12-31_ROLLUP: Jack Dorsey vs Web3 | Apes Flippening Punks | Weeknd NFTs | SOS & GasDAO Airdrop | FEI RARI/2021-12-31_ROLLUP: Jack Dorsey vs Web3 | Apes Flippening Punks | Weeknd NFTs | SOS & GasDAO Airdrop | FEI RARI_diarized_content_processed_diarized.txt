00:00:00.170 - 00:00:16.590, Speaker A: I'm just excited about next year. I'm excited about 2022, excited about crypto. Bullish crypto. David, you believe that I'm bullish crypto? Yeah. Hey, bankless nation, it's Friday morning. Happy new year to you. Well, it's almost new year, I guess it's New Year's Eve day.
00:00:16.590 - 00:00:23.642, Speaker A: David and I are recording this and it's roll up time, David. Well, actually, I stole your thunder. What time is it, David?
00:00:23.706 - 00:00:51.434, Speaker B: Oh, it's roll up time, Ryan, thanks for stop following that one to me. Yeah, no, it's time to roll up the whole entire year. Actually, we already did that, but this is going to be the last roll up of 2021. We are covering the last two weeks, so there's a lot to cram in. But also it's one of those times of the year where there's kind of quiet. So it might actually just be the same kind of length, same roll up covering two weeks, but about the same amount of stuff, hopefully, and hopefully we can get this done in a reasonable amount of time. We were really good at it last time.
00:00:51.434 - 00:00:52.938, Speaker B: We'll see if we can do it again.
00:00:53.104 - 00:01:13.330, Speaker A: So some of that stuff we're going to cover is Shopify. They just opened up their platform to nfts. That's really cool. It's also been like airdrop week for the past week and a half. Everyone's dropping coins, I guess, right before the new year. I don't know why, but we'll talk about some of those airdrops that are coming. Also, the biggest protocol merger ever was just approved this week.
00:01:13.330 - 00:01:30.134, Speaker A: Two big D five protocols teaming up. We've also got, like, old brands like Radio Shack. They are entering the D five space. Yeah, good question. We'll get into that. And also, Jack Dorsey versus web three, a tussle on Twitter. We're going to talk about that, too.
00:01:30.134 - 00:01:42.550, Speaker A: So a lot of things going on in the holidays as well. And once again, we will roll this up for you and talk about each of those with some additional things. Before we do, David, let's talk a little bit about hashflow. Hashflow.
00:01:42.630 - 00:01:43.274, Speaker B: All right.
00:01:43.392 - 00:01:49.870, Speaker A: Yeah. So hashflow is like this defi. OTC desk. What is an OTC desk, David? And what does this protocol do?
00:01:49.940 - 00:02:28.410, Speaker B: Yeah, an OTC desk is if you have a big trade, if you're a trading firm or just you want something, just to have your price be optimized. An OTC desk is where you go, you throw them a bunch of money and then they get you back your trade back to you at an optimized price. Hashflow is that, but as a Defi app, OTC Defi. So they work with you to automatically get you the best price on your trade, as well as things like mev resistance, front running resistance, and just a number of other things to make sure that you get the best price when you make your swap. So you can check them out at app hashflow.com.
00:02:28.560 - 00:02:49.202, Speaker A: That's pretty cool for whales, too. And rumor is they are issuing a token as well. We'll get to that a little bit further in the roll up. All right, David, well, let's talk about bitcoin as we get into the markets. The markets this week for bitcoin. And David, why don't you give us, like, the two weeks we usually do just one week. But what's the two weeks highs and lows look like?
00:02:49.256 - 00:03:04.582, Speaker B: Yeah, we started this two weeks ago at $48,000. We are currently at 47 300. So over two weeks, we're down $700 with bitcoin. Hit a low of 46,000. Hit a high of 52,000. Overall, down 3% over the two weeks.
00:03:04.716 - 00:03:12.470, Speaker A: Just down 3%. It felt like it was down more. Maybe that was because of ether. Price has been down and it feels like a lot more. What's the last two weeks been for ether?
00:03:12.550 - 00:03:36.050, Speaker B: Yeah, two weeks ago, ether started at $4,000, hit a low of $3,650. A little bit surprising how low that got. Its high during that time period was 4150. We are currently at 3750. So overall down 6% over the two week period. My take on this is, this is just low liquidity shenanigans. This is the end of the year.
00:03:36.050 - 00:04:04.842, Speaker B: All the traders and market makers and all institutions that place bids and asks on exchanges, they take a break, too. And so the markets are very low liquidity in a low liquid state towards the end of the year. And so this is a ripe opportunity for whales to play some whale games. I suspect that's kind of what's going on here. I don't really treat these numbers as real. I'm going to wait until the first week of January to actually reaffirm what the real prices are.
00:04:04.896 - 00:04:23.086, Speaker A: I feel like retail is taking some time off, too. Like, retail isn't really bidding these things up either. They're just kind of letting it happen. So maybe that's what's going on as well. But I'm kind of glad that we're not ending the year in euphoria territory, to be honest. I feel like this tees us up for next year. And I'm anticipating a big year next year.
00:04:23.086 - 00:04:25.790, Speaker A: Bullish, going into 2022. How about you?
00:04:25.860 - 00:04:32.382, Speaker B: Oh, absolutely. And you have the one month chart pulled up on ether right now, and it's a bad one month chart.
00:04:32.446 - 00:04:33.442, Speaker A: Yeah, that is bad, actually.
00:04:33.496 - 00:04:40.054, Speaker B: Starting the month at $4,000, ending the month at $3,700. So down $1,000 on the three month.
00:04:40.092 - 00:04:40.822, Speaker A: Looks okay, though.
00:04:40.876 - 00:04:41.782, Speaker B: Three month looks great.
00:04:41.836 - 00:04:42.006, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:04:42.028 - 00:05:02.646, Speaker B: So starting the three months at $3,200, hitting the high of $4,800 and ending at $3,700. Just crab two months slightly up three months. Bearish one month overall. Just like a quieter market than what we have been used to. So I think that's setting us up for a fantastic January.
00:05:02.758 - 00:05:24.210, Speaker A: Well, we're looking at it. Let's look at the year. $730 at the start of this year, and now we're 3700. So not a bad way to finish it. Not bad, but also not euphoric. Right. Things didn't get crazy last year, so maybe we'll save some of the craziness for next year.
00:05:24.210 - 00:05:25.890, Speaker A: How about the ratio? What's that doing?
00:05:25.960 - 00:05:38.790, Speaker B: Yeah, ratio also down with the market as well. It's down to zero. 80. So kind of broke through that eight number, but still overall in a satisfying place, if you believe in the flipping.
00:05:39.690 - 00:05:41.210, Speaker A: Do you believe in the flipping, sir?
00:05:41.280 - 00:05:41.978, Speaker B: Oh, yeah.
00:05:42.064 - 00:05:55.790, Speaker A: Definitely a core believer in the flipping. Founder of the flipping belief. How about the bed index? All right, this is a third, a third, a third. DFI, bitcoin and ether. We must be down on the two weeks.
00:05:55.940 - 00:06:05.534, Speaker B: We are down 18% on the one month. The last two weeks have been flat or ish. I think we're down at roughly $6 from 141 to 135 where we are now.
00:06:05.652 - 00:06:30.874, Speaker A: Okay, there we go. Let's talk about decentralized exchanges, though, while we're on markets, David, because if you aggregate this and look over the year, this has been an incredible year for decentralized exchanges. Over $1 trillion in trading volume activity in 2021. Absolutely phenomenal. You can see this chart. This is kind of the compilation. You see a lot of uniswap here from v two and v one.
00:06:30.874 - 00:06:48.954, Speaker A: Also sushi swap curve serum. There are about 14 others. Kind of a long tail of Dexes uniswap, by far the most dominant. But what an incredible year for decentralized exchanges. I remember not too long ago people said that decentralized exchanges would never take off. Right. Because you couldn't host an order book on Ethereum.
00:06:48.954 - 00:07:07.394, Speaker A: It was too slow. And that wasn't that long ago. That was like 2017. 20180 X is trying to make it in that world and really just couldn't. Now, decentralized exchanges, they're just taken for granted. But this is something that has totally burst onto the scene. And what an incredible year.
00:07:07.394 - 00:07:09.330, Speaker A: 1 trillion in trading volume.
00:07:09.930 - 00:07:27.494, Speaker B: Dexes breaking through Coinbase's volume numbers on a 24 hours or even a weekly basis is now kind of feels like normal. Dex volume numbers don't make big headlines anymore. People are just assuming that they are the things that just carry us into the future when it comes to markets.
00:07:27.622 - 00:07:47.326, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, the next milestones to breaker, it's like Nasdaq, right? Yeah. Wake me up when Dexes are bigger than the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange. I'm not going to call that. Okay, I got my predictions, but that's not one of them yet. Not for 2022. Let's talk about urine finance.
00:07:47.326 - 00:08:28.922, Speaker A: So this is the YFI token. The protocol behind the YFI token. It had a pretty good week despite DFI collectively being down, soared over 85% one week. And the reason is token economic changes. Governance put together a few ways to juice the YFI token, or to deliver more value to token holders. One of those ideas that went forward through governance is the ability to stake YFI tokens in exchange for X YFI tokens, and then holders would receive additional YFI, and urine would buy that Wi Fi in the open market. So it's almost like an open market operation.
00:08:28.922 - 00:09:21.738, Speaker A: In exchange for staking Wi Fi, they also are considering implementing a model that's based on curve finance, where the more Wi Fi you lock up, the greater rewards that you get in Wi Fi tokens as well. There are a number of other things, but I think the big takeaway here is like, this is sort of what we anticipated. Every token protocol is very much incented through its governance process to start capturing the value that's accrued by its protocol, by its token. And sometimes this happens during bear markets, this will also happen during bull markets. But every defi token is going to do this. This is why I'm not worried about token value capture long term, as long as it's governed by individuals with a profit incentive, and they all are. What are your thoughts on this, David?
00:09:21.834 - 00:10:35.442, Speaker B: Yeah, there's this inevitable friction behind the value that a protocol offers to the ecosystem, and then the actual valuation of the token on the secondary markets. Those things are separate things. And the field, the domain of knowledge that we are calling tokenomics, is about how do we get those things more aligned? How do we get those things to overlap rather than be separate. And urine has really struggled with this throughout 2021, where I think it's more or less been flat versus the dollar, and then absolutely got smashed versus ETH in 2021 just because the tokenomics were a point of contention, as people would consider urine a very valuable protocol, offering a very valuable service, and the value of the token could not capture that value. And so naturally, as ether has like five x and urine has stayed flat, Yfi has stayed flat, there's a growing incentive for everyone to figure out like, all right, how do we more closely align the value of the protocol with the value of the token? So this is an attempt at that. There's a little bit of like pumpamentals or Ponzi nomics in here, but kind of that's what tokenomics are. How do we align the value of the protocol with the value of the token on the secondary market? And these changes created an 85% wifi price increase.
00:10:35.442 - 00:10:39.080, Speaker B: And so the market so far seems to agree that these are good changes.
00:10:39.450 - 00:10:54.042, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. I do think other tokens are going to do this as well. So this is the final form, the final state of all DFI tokens. Guys, we will be back with the releases of the week, but before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:10:54.176 - 00:11:35.338, Speaker B: Arbitrum is an Ethereum scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use DFI and NFTs. And now it's live and has over 100 projects deployed. Gas fees on Ethereum l one suck too many people want to use Ethereum, and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us. And that's why teams like Arbitrum have been hard at work developing layer two solutions that makes transactions on Ethereum cheap and instant. Arbitrum increases Ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude, at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying. When interacting with Arbitrum, you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into Ethereum's level of security and decentralization. This is why people are calling this Ethereum's broadband moment, where we get to add performance onto decentralization and security.
00:11:35.338 - 00:12:16.390, Speaker B: If you're a developer and you want to save on gas costs and overall make a better user experience, go to developers offchainlabs.com to get started building on Arbitrum. And if you're a user, keep an eye out for your favorite DFI apps being built on Arbitrum. Many DFI applications on the Ethereum L one are migrating over to layer twos like Arbitrum, and some are even skipping over the layer ones entirely and deploying directly on layer two. There's so many apps coming online to Arbitram, so go to bridge Arbitrum IO now and start bridging over your ETH or any of the tokens listed and start having the DFI or NFT experience that you've always wanted. Alchemyx is one of the coolest new DFI apps on the scene. It introduces selfpaying loans, allowing you to spend and save at the same time.
00:12:16.390 - 00:12:57.446, Speaker B: Deposit the Dai stablecoin into the alchemy's vault in order to get an advance on the interest it generates. Borrow up to 50% of the total amount of your deposited die in the form of Al USD stablecoin. Here's the craziest part. The loan pays itself back and you cannot be liquidated. Unlock your assets potential in the ultimate DFI savings account and brand new to alkmix is the eth vault where you can deposit eth into the application. Borrow al eth against your deposits while having your advance gradually paid back over time. V two is rapidly approaching, which will allow for even more collateral types, plus a variety of yield strategies to choose from.
00:12:57.446 - 00:13:13.718, Speaker B: Harness the power of Alchemyx at Alchemyx Fi that's A-L-C-H-E-M-I-X-F-I. Follow alchemyx on Twitter at alchemyx fi and join the discord to keep up to date with Alchemy's v two and to get involved in governance.
00:13:13.894 - 00:13:32.954, Speaker A: All right guys, we are back with the releases of the week. Let's start with this one. Shopify plus nfts. Shopify massive ecommerce protocol platform. Plus nfts the ability to sell nfts. Just spin up a Shopify store and sell your own nfts that is coming, that is now here. What do you think about this, David?
00:13:33.002 - 00:14:08.106, Speaker B: Yeah, on their page they say mint and sell your own branded nfts with Shopify and Shopify payments right from your store. Join the NFT beta program today. So Shopify, already out of the box, has like half of an NFT platform ready to go. All that's missing are the actual nfts and seems like that's what's here today now. And so Shopify, already a digital e commerce store, like integrating digital products into your digital e commerce store, seems pretty trivial as far as things go. And so seems like they're diving headfirst into nfts. The URL for this is shopify.com
00:14:08.106 - 00:14:11.498, Speaker B: nft. So relatively easy if you want to go check that out.
00:14:11.584 - 00:14:32.354, Speaker A: Yeah, it's super cool. There's so many wins for existing web, two platforms in the NFT movement, and this is just another win. And this provides another fiat onramp directly to nfts, so it serves consumers as well. Bullish, that. Great to see Shopify diving in. I mean, they're absolutely massive and they've grown like crazy recently. David, let's talk about the browser game.
00:14:32.354 - 00:14:37.126, Speaker A: So opera is doing a big move here. What are they up to? Opera, the browser, of course.
00:14:37.228 - 00:14:58.774, Speaker B: Yeah, opera is integrating polygon. Polygon applications and the Matic token are integrated directly into the browser. Coming in Q one. So like in two days? Well, Q one starts in two days. I don't know if it's coming in two days. It's sometime in Q one. And they say get ready to benefit from the fast, scalable, low fee environment of polygon and access over 3000 apps on the Polygon network.
00:14:58.774 - 00:15:28.178, Speaker B: So Polygon integrated right into opera, which is a pretty interesting choice because Polygon isn't everything about crypto. There's stuff elsewhere. But opera has decided to not integrate ethereum, not integrate arbitram or optimism, just only select Polygon for now. Pretty interesting choice, but definitely makes sense because you got to have something scaled in there. But congrats to the Polygon team, and also really awesome to see opera moving forward into the web three world.
00:15:28.264 - 00:15:56.394, Speaker A: And I wonder what this integration will look like. I know it's particularly aimed at their mobile device, and I know Opera has a wallet as well. So I wonder if this is just like a seamless browser to dap to DFI app sort of experience inside of your mobile browser. And if so, that's awesome. That is super bullish. I've been looking for more seamless integration between crypto native applications and the browser. Right now we're doing it through extensions and third parties.
00:15:56.394 - 00:16:20.998, Speaker A: But what if it was completely integrated? There's no fundamental need for it to be like a whole separate application inside of a browser. It could be part of a browser. And I wonder if this is what opera is pushing towards. Love to see Chrome, Firefox. The other browsers follow suit, but they seem a little sleepy compared to opera. Opera is like hungry for market share, right?
00:16:21.164 - 00:16:21.880, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:16:22.650 - 00:16:56.434, Speaker A: Let's talk about this. David clarity, Dao. This is a new coordination and information management tool for daos. Lots of DAO infrastructure being built out these days. This is a way for DAO contributors to solve the access control problem. So it's the ability to, I think, segment access to certain things within a DAO to an Ethereum username. So if there's some piece of content on a web page or maybe there's a discord server and only certain whitelisted DaO participants should have access to it.
00:16:56.434 - 00:17:10.082, Speaker A: I think this provides a way to provide access control and segment that access to particular Ethereum usernames. So it's sort of a sign in with Ethereum type of application here, specifically targeted at daos.
00:17:10.226 - 00:17:22.842, Speaker B: Yeah, it sounds like it's a Google G suite, like some admin management tool with permissions and lets you access different parts of the drive, but instead of the drive, now it's the DaO. Makes sense.
00:17:22.976 - 00:17:33.374, Speaker A: Yeah, it makes sense. And good to see that stuff being built out. Parachains also officially launched on the Polkadot network. David, what is this about?
00:17:33.492 - 00:17:52.670, Speaker B: Yeah, parachains are. Polkadot's big. That's their big thing, that's their big innovation. Kind of some sort of hybrid between sharding and roll ups, but built inside of Polkadot. It's been the flagship feature of Polkadot since inception and now it's finally here. So congrats to Polkadot.
00:17:52.830 - 00:18:18.410, Speaker A: Five pair chains went live. I think of these sort of as roll ups. What's interesting about these is the pair chains actually have to bid for a slot. They're not just like you can't permissionlessly just start using polka dot. You actually have to bid in dot tokens for one of these slots. And so these first five parachains that successfully bid, they went live. All told, it cost about 99 million dots.
00:18:18.410 - 00:18:38.466, Speaker A: I believe that was garnered by these five projects during the auction period. That's $2.4 billion. Not sure all of the details, how that works, but it's definitely a different and interesting mechanism as compared to Ethereum roll ups. David, what's this? Bitmex is announcing a token. Okay, I thought Bitmex was anti token. What are they doing here?
00:18:38.568 - 00:19:02.010, Speaker B: Yeah, for those that came into crypto in 2021, you might not be familiar with Bitmex. It has a pretty long track record. Bitmex is a centralized exchange for margin and leverage trading. It's kind of been known to be like the casino, just like where people just go 100 x long on bitcoin and inevitably get wrecked or not. Or they get riches.
00:19:02.430 - 00:19:06.310, Speaker A: David. It was like the dgen playground before Defi became the playground.
00:19:06.390 - 00:19:45.906, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, that's exactly before. Before Defi and then also before binance. Smart chain kind of took over the casino thing, but yeah, bitcoin is famously bitcoin, only for the longest time, Arthur Hayes was on the run from, I think, the CFTC, or Arthur Hayes, the founder of Bitmex. There's a long backstory. Ever since Bitmex ended up getting, I'm not sure, like, charges from the CFTC or some three letter agency, they've kind of taken a new turn. New turn. And what was formerly a very bitcoin centered ecosystem is now issuing a token, which previously was blasphemous coming from the leaders behind Bitmex.
00:19:45.906 - 00:19:57.818, Speaker B: But now Bitmex has a token. It's basically a loyalty token, some sort of kind of like airline miles, but specifically for the Bitmax exchange. So the Bmax token is out and live.
00:19:57.984 - 00:20:25.874, Speaker A: The interesting thing is why. I mean, why not issue a token and see what happens? I guess that's their play on it. And I think they're trying to revive some retail interest. Right. So give some retail users a reason to continue using Bitmex and compete against the ftxs of the world and the binances of the world, who've really taken center stage over the last couple years and leapfrogged Bitmex. Let's talk about this. So hashflow is issuing a token as well.
00:20:25.874 - 00:20:33.474, Speaker A: We were talking about hashflow earlier in the introduction. That's that OTC defi protocol. What are they up to here, David?
00:20:33.522 - 00:20:58.046, Speaker B: Yeah, they're issuing a token. So if you have traded on hashflow or contributed to the community early on, do you own a hashbot NFT, for example, then you might have the HFT token. And so that's Hashlow's governance token, and we'll be able to free to claim towards the end of January. And so stay tuned. If you are a hashflow ecosystem participant, you might have a token coming your way at the end of the month.
00:20:58.228 - 00:21:13.362, Speaker A: There you go. More fiat on ramps to arbitram. This one from Huobi, who is a centralized exchange now. They are allowing deposits and withdraws for eth directly to and from arbitram. Is kind of cool. What are your thoughts here?
00:21:13.416 - 00:21:19.986, Speaker B: Yeah, knocking them down. We need more and more and more. This is good news. And I want 50 more news items like this over the next month.
00:21:20.088 - 00:21:24.470, Speaker A: It's coming, though, in 2022. Right? Like, including Coinbase. That's the big one I've been waiting for.
00:21:24.540 - 00:21:25.314, Speaker B: Yeah, Coinbase.
00:21:25.362 - 00:21:25.846, Speaker A: Got it.
00:21:25.948 - 00:21:28.134, Speaker B: I bet Coinbase Q one 2022.
00:21:28.252 - 00:21:31.094, Speaker A: Okay. Was that a prediction? Is that official David Hoffman prediction?
00:21:31.142 - 00:21:33.722, Speaker B: That's enough. God, the last time I did this, I did not end well.
00:21:33.776 - 00:21:34.886, Speaker A: Certified fresh.
00:21:34.998 - 00:21:44.526, Speaker B: David Hoff, David Hoffman prediction. Coinbase on and off ramps onto an ethereum. Layer two in Q one, 2022.
00:21:44.628 - 00:21:46.894, Speaker A: There you have it, folks. He took the bait. We got him now.
00:21:46.932 - 00:21:48.526, Speaker B: I'm texting Brian right now.
00:21:48.548 - 00:22:13.270, Speaker A: Like, Brian, something, please, Brian, tweet. Outstanding. Okay, raises. This week, Alexis Ohanian and Polygon, they're investing a cool $200 million in decentralized social media. Alexis Ohanian, the co founder of Reddit, of course, venture capitalist, he's coming on bankless a couple of weeks. We're going to ask him about this. But what's up with this news? What's going on?
00:22:13.340 - 00:22:40.094, Speaker B: Yeah, there's a lot of just excitement and energy around decentralized social media platforms. While the details on what that means and what that is is still fuzzy, regardless, people are still working on them. Aave is working on this. Polygon is working on this. I mean, it would be huge for any ecosystem to be like the thing that figured out decentralized social media. So there's obviously a lot of reward there for whoever can crack that nut. And it makes sense for Alexis Ohanian to be right there.
00:22:40.094 - 00:22:59.158, Speaker B: He's the guy that created Reddit, which is the most. Reddit itself isn't decentralized, but it kind of looks and feels like it, right, with all the subreddits and so really cool, $200 million in the war chest to build out some sort of decentralized social media in a time where we kind of really need it right now. Ryan, we're going to talk a little bit more about that later.
00:22:59.324 - 00:23:06.920, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. Have you seen any decentralized social media that you've liked so far? I've tried bitcloud a little bit, and it's just been kind.
00:23:08.250 - 00:23:16.202, Speaker B: I don't even know what decentralized social media. What does that mean, decentralization? How does that impact the social media aspect, nature of it?
00:23:16.256 - 00:23:21.850, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know. It's always been my gut that it's not going to look like the social media platforms of the past.
00:23:21.920 - 00:23:24.654, Speaker B: It's not going to be Instagram, but decentralized. That's not going to be.
00:23:24.772 - 00:23:39.602, Speaker A: Exactly. It's got to be something different. I do think that there's something here, but you can't just slap decentralization on the thing and call it decentralized social media. So we'll see what they have in mind, but it's good to see the innovation. Talk about this figment. They reached the unicorn status. Wow.
00:23:39.602 - 00:24:02.202, Speaker A: Everyone's a unicorn these days with $110,000,000 series C. Figment is a staking services provider. They've got some big investors in the round here, including finance. What I think is interesting here is, David, there are a number of probably a couple dozen or so staking service providers. Figment is one of the larger one. There's chorus one. There's a number of others.
00:24:02.202 - 00:24:16.234, Speaker A: One called staked was just acquired by Kraken. We'll talk a little bit about that. But interesting to see these just pure staking as a service companies accruing such massive valuations so quickly. What are your thoughts?
00:24:16.362 - 00:24:38.690, Speaker B: Yeah. Being a unicorn is just not the same this day and age. Not after we printed like a bajillion dollars in 2020. This is going to be a huge story. It already is a huge story. But even bigger going into 2022 is staking proof of stake staking. It felt like 2021 was the year of staking anticipation.
00:24:38.690 - 00:24:55.594, Speaker B: 2022 is the year of actual staking and staking services being coming into their full production ready environment because of all the chains that are also coming into production ready staking. And so just some of the valuations on figment staked and all these other protocols starting to make a lot of sense.
00:24:55.712 - 00:25:14.686, Speaker A: Well, this wouldn't have happened, in my opinion, without like, alt layer one season completely taking off. Right. Because many of these networks, they're semi active in ETH two staking but not really their bread and butter, is like the cosmos ecosystems, the Salana ecosystems of the world. All of those alternative layer ones, the.
00:25:14.708 - 00:25:19.746, Speaker B: Ecosystems that the individual has a hard time staking on. Yeah. Weird how companies start to feel that.
00:25:19.768 - 00:25:31.202, Speaker A: Niche kind of, right? And you got to take on that when it comes to news, when we talk about staked, but we'll save that for the news. Section B protocol, they just did a raise, $2.2 million. What's the B protocol, David?
00:25:31.266 - 00:25:34.834, Speaker B: Yeah, B protocol came out of the black Tuesday.
00:25:34.882 - 00:25:35.634, Speaker A: Was it Black Tuesday?
00:25:35.682 - 00:25:36.514, Speaker B: Black Thursday.
00:25:36.642 - 00:25:37.330, Speaker A: Black Thursday.
00:25:37.410 - 00:25:38.094, Speaker B: Black Thursday.
00:25:38.162 - 00:25:38.490, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:25:38.560 - 00:25:43.642, Speaker B: When the crypto markets cut in half by like 50, 55%.
00:25:43.776 - 00:25:45.290, Speaker A: Such a distant memory.
00:25:45.790 - 00:25:50.762, Speaker B: You remember that? Yeah, Ryan. We were recording bankless podcast number two that day.
00:25:50.896 - 00:25:56.714, Speaker A: Yeah, we stopped the podcast and we're like, oh, my God. Eth gas fees are like 1200 glare.
00:25:56.762 - 00:26:29.782, Speaker B: Or something, and everyone's getting what's happening. So what happened on that day was maker Dow had zero die liquidations, as in people would pay zero die to bid on the collateral because gas congestion was so high. No one else's bids on underwater maker vaults were going through because gas was so high. And also, by the way, that was novel for the time. Gas fees had started to creep up, but gas fees were still not a thing back in February of 2020. Gas on Ethereum was still relatively cheap at that point. So having gas congestion was very new to Ethereum.
00:26:29.782 - 00:27:06.450, Speaker B: And turns out that created an unprecedented scenario with regards to liquidations as what happened with Makerdao. So, like, Makerdao had $8 million of collateral that was purchased for zero die, which is a problem. And so b protocol is a solution for this. It is basically like a protector around your vault. So your compound position, your maker position. And when you deposit into maker or compound through b protocol, it gives you like a wrapper of protection. It gives b protocol the right to liquidate you before anyone else.
00:27:06.450 - 00:27:24.582, Speaker B: And so B protocol is a DAO that is going to liquidate you at the most favorable rates without gas fees, and you can take part in the liquidation or have your positions be protected by B protocol. Really just a great effort here as well. Disclaimer Ryan and I are in this angel investment round.
00:27:24.726 - 00:27:33.270, Speaker A: Very cool. All right, David, let's talk about jobs. Hey, it's a new year. Just about. Anyway, it's time to consider a job in crypto.
00:27:33.350 - 00:27:36.078, Speaker B: A new job, new job, new year.
00:27:36.164 - 00:28:03.446, Speaker A: New job, new outlook on life. You've been listening to bankless for a long time. How about getting a job in crypto? No regrets for me, man. I jumped ship full time in 2017, my corporate job, and it's been absolutely awesome. I had no idea what I was going to do next. And in crypto, you just kind of figure it out, right? Like you meet the community, you figure out your niche, and you go develop it. Growing industry, tons going on.
00:28:03.446 - 00:28:38.462, Speaker A: Here are some of the jobs this week. First, a senior software engineer from Gilded, a founding full stack engineer. A founding full stack engineer. That's awesome. Utopia Labs senior iOS engineer, senior back end engineer at smart, DFI, community ecosystem lead, Dy DX Bitwise still has some positions open NFT specialist, smart contract platforms and web three research analysts, crypto research analyst, governance specialists as well at Bitwise, ahead of growth at Dex Guru. Check that out for you. Marketing types, technical lead, draftly blockchain developer.
00:28:38.462 - 00:28:52.518, Speaker A: You got to be specialized in rust at Solidx as well. And we could go on a ton of different jobs for you. You can check those out. Bankless palett XYZ grab a job in crypto this year.
00:28:52.684 - 00:28:57.542, Speaker B: Grab a job in crypto. Ryan, shall we get to the airdrops? Because there was a lot of them.
00:28:57.676 - 00:29:12.150, Speaker A: News time. Airdrops time. Yeah, let's hit like there's like five or six or maybe seven, David. But we're going to hit like the three that are ones. Yeah, the three that are kind of worth claiming, maybe. Why don't you start with this one SOS token.
00:29:12.230 - 00:29:30.306, Speaker B: So here's the headline. Open Dow's SOS token hits a $250,000,000 market cap despite unclear goals and security risks. Unclear goals and security risks. Man, does that not just sound like the start of the very beginning of a token airdrop? That sounds about par for the course. Yeah.
00:29:30.328 - 00:29:33.810, Speaker A: What's your white paper? Unclear goals and security risks.
00:29:34.790 - 00:29:53.978, Speaker B: The SOS token is basically opensea but decentralized. But a Dow is what they are claiming to be. So if you ever bought sold nfts, bought nfts on OpenC, you might have an SOS token airdropped to you. I had my SOS token. I think I got like 0.6 ethers worth of SOS tokens. Haven't done anything with them.
00:29:54.064 - 00:29:54.554, Speaker A: There you go.
00:29:54.592 - 00:29:59.270, Speaker B: Who know you holding maybe selling for ether.
00:29:59.430 - 00:30:07.630, Speaker A: That just means David hasn't had time to sell yet. How about this next air job? Because that's one of three that we're going to highlight. What's this one?
00:30:07.700 - 00:30:35.938, Speaker B: Yeah, this is from Giveth. Giveth has been around Ethereum for a really long time. If anyone has listened to the layer zero with Griff Green, he talks about Giveth. If you have participated in the giveth economy, you might have an airdrop. You can check that out at GI. V-E-T-H IO. Giveth is something that's been trying to spread out money and wealth into the different corners of the world, both with giving grants and trying to spin up the giving economy.
00:30:35.938 - 00:30:45.558, Speaker B: And so, yeah, definitely check out that layer zero with Griffith Reed, especially if you want to get a front row seats for the DAO and what happened there. And then after that, we talked about gibboth.
00:30:45.654 - 00:31:04.282, Speaker A: This is a responsibility token, guys. A valueless responsibility token. So the power to vote, a cool claim process, too. I went through and I claimed, and you can claim on XDI. So cost no gas in order to do that. So you can plug in your ETH address and check, see if you are a potential recipient. Why don't you do this last one too, David?
00:31:04.346 - 00:31:28.994, Speaker B: Yeah, this one is gas dow. Have you spent more than $1,559 on gas? You might recognize that number. You can go claim your gas tokens if you have spent more than one, five five, $9 on gas. What it does and why it exists, absolutely no clue. But you can claim a proportional amount of gas tokens to how much you have spent on gas. Yeah, I'm selling that. 115.
00:31:29.132 - 00:31:34.230, Speaker A: Five nine, though. Those are rookie numbers, man. How much gas have you spent?
00:31:34.310 - 00:31:35.482, Speaker B: Oh my God, a lot.
00:31:35.536 - 00:31:48.414, Speaker A: It also depends, right? It's like on what value? What dollar value. Because if you spent some eth on gas a couple of years ago, it.
00:31:48.452 - 00:31:50.542, Speaker B: Was pennies at the time.
00:31:50.596 - 00:32:01.710, Speaker A: Yeah, spent pennies at the time. That could amount to like hundreds of dollars even today. Have you ever plugged one of your addresses into how much gas have I spent?
00:32:01.790 - 00:32:03.378, Speaker B: I don't like to do that too much.
00:32:03.464 - 00:32:11.954, Speaker A: Yeah, I never do that. I just don't want to know. I don't want to know. Let's talk about this. Ethereum news. Testnet is out. The testnet for the merge.
00:32:11.954 - 00:32:33.358, Speaker A: The long awaited merge fork Kinsugi is the testnet. And this is a post from the ethereum.org website from Tim Baco as well. This is just another step towards getting the merge into production on Mainet, hopefully coming in the first half of next year. We'll have to see, though, any thoughts on this?
00:32:33.444 - 00:32:46.366, Speaker B: Yeah, this is where we do mock merges. Mock merges. We also talked about this with Vitalik Buterin on the podcast that's coming out on Monday, all about the future of the Ethereum roadmap and more. So stay tuned for that.
00:32:46.468 - 00:33:05.458, Speaker A: Yeah, that was a good podcast, man. We just recorded that earlier today. Yeah, good stuff in that podcast. Make sure you check that out. David, this was huge too. This happened during the holidays. Well, it didn't happen during the holidays, but the news came out during the holidays of a critical polygon bug that put $24 billion in Maddox tokens at risk.
00:33:05.458 - 00:33:13.082, Speaker A: Basically all the Maddox tokens, not quite, but like 92% or something like this. What happened here?
00:33:13.216 - 00:33:48.066, Speaker B: Yeah, there was an exploit in the token contract. I think this is kind of hard for me to parse apart because I'm not a developer, but the token itself had an exploit which is now patched. There is nothing left at risk. All fallout has already happened. Black hat attackers did manage to get away with $800,000, I believe, worth of Maddox tokens. But in contrast to the 24 billion that was at stake, that's basically nothing. Two white hat hackers were paid out many millions of dollars, I think $3.3
00:33:48.066 - 00:34:01.706, Speaker B: million for the white hat hacker that discovered the bug and then helped patch it. And so this is now in the rear view mirror. It's unfortunate that happened in the first place. Also very nice that we are paying white hat hackers millions of dollars to discover these things. That's very. Yeah.
00:34:01.728 - 00:34:03.514, Speaker A: What was the reward here? This was huge. Right?
00:34:03.552 - 00:34:14.990, Speaker B: It's like in Maddox tokens. Yeah. And so, yeah. Real close call with the whole Maddox thing that happened in the last couple of weeks.
00:34:15.140 - 00:34:39.414, Speaker A: Yeah. And this all happened and was resolved on, I think, December 5 or something, but news just came out this week. They quietly patched that and then issued the news a few weeks later taking care of that. I mean, goes to show you there can be zero day bugs in some of this stuff. Even with thousands and hundreds of thousands of users and billions in value, even.
00:34:39.452 - 00:34:41.154, Speaker B: With billion dollar networks. Yep.
00:34:41.282 - 00:34:57.962, Speaker A: Let's talk about this. This is probably the biggest protocol merger being proposed in history, and it was just passed by governance Rari Capital and Faye protocol token holders approving a multi billion dollar defi merger. What's happening?
00:34:58.096 - 00:35:45.130, Speaker B: Yeah, on the surface, this kind of seems like what is a borrowing and lending protocol, which is Rari. Why are they being acquired by or merging with a stablecoin protocol, which is Faye, on the surface, doesn't make much sense from. I haven't unpacked this myself, but the people that I listen to in this ecosystem are very, very bullish on this partnership. There's a bunch of aligned incentives here. And this has also been adopted overwhelmingly by both sides. It was basically both Faye and Rari had like 90 to one or 90 to one approval with regards to the token votes for saying, yeah, everyone's a big fan of this. There was some criticism about how hasty this was from some community members.
00:35:45.130 - 00:35:51.366, Speaker B: That was definitely a critique. But overall, I think this is going to be a great alignment and incentives over the long term.
00:35:51.558 - 00:36:14.178, Speaker A: I actually want to hear the story here. I think we should get Faye and somebody from Faye and somebody from Rari on the podcast to just discuss why this is happening and what the benefits are for both parties, or at least somebody who can dissect this for me because I haven't quite followed it, but it seems like it could be a very big deal and maybe a harbinger of things to come. More of these protocol type mergers in the future.
00:36:14.264 - 00:36:19.174, Speaker B: That was a formal request, by the way. All the listeners out there, Jay from.
00:36:19.212 - 00:36:34.102, Speaker A: Rari and somebody from Faye. Come on, bankless, we'll host you guys and talk about this. Consensus is collaborating with Mastercard on a new ethereum scaling solution. They're built using consensus roll ups. What is this? David?
00:36:34.166 - 00:37:20.342, Speaker B: So this is the old consensus quorum, which used to be a sidechain. I believe they might now be folding it into a roll up. This quorum was previously sold to Morgan and then bought back by consensus. From now is, I think consensus is now positioning it as a CBDC stablecoin payments protocol. That's something a little bit closer to IBM's hyperledger than it is to an open public permissionless blockchain, which is, I think, probably the right foundation for something like a CBDC, where it's permissioned, gets controlled by private public partnership, and there's actually somebody to call if something goes wrong. But consensus moving forward with institutional stablecoin CBDC stuff.
00:37:20.476 - 00:37:47.166, Speaker A: Yeah, it's cool that Mastercard is involved here, too. Visa has a massive play in crypto, and Mastercard has some catching up to do. And I've started to see them trying to catch up in the back half of 2021, and I expect they'll continue to ramp it up. David, let's talk some meme stocks, man. I guess maybe not meme stocks, but, like, meme tokens or old brands becoming tokens. Radio Shack is pivoting to DFI, apparently so. Radio Shack.
00:37:47.166 - 00:38:18.826, Speaker A: Two guys bought it in 2020, and I assume they just purchased it for nostalgia reasons. For the name, obviously. There are no radio Shack stores that I am aware of anymore. At least all the malls I've seen no longer have radio shacks. But I feel like this pivot to Defi is sort of an asking to become a meme stock. Right. It's kind of like following GameStop, following AMC, some of these older brands that have some retail nostalgia, and pivoting into a new and interesting space.
00:38:18.826 - 00:38:36.546, Speaker A: Maybe that's just the skeptical take. Maybe there's something really here. I guess their plan is to provide a bridge between DFI and larger corporations, the world's corporations. But it also seems very vague to me. What's your take on this?
00:38:36.648 - 00:38:47.506, Speaker B: I think this is just a bunch of hot air. Do you remember in 2017 when the Arizona iced tea company added blockchain to their name formally, and then the stock price went up?
00:38:47.528 - 00:38:47.714, Speaker A: Right.
00:38:47.752 - 00:39:06.074, Speaker B: Stock price, like, doubled overnight in the middle of the ico mania. I think that's something closer to what's happening with Radio Shack. Some people just bought the defunct radio Shack brand, slapped Defi on it, and now they are just dancing it around. Radio Shack, Defi. Radio Shack, Defi. And now people like you and me are talking about it. I think that's what's going on.
00:39:06.192 - 00:39:25.278, Speaker A: Yeah, probably so. That worries me a little bit, because that was a top signal in 2017, but top signals are different every single time in the market. But here's another one. A Dow wants to buy blockbuster and turn it into a decentralized film streaming service. Is this more of the same?
00:39:25.444 - 00:39:43.350, Speaker B: Yeah, same kind of energy. I mean, they just want to buy the blockbuster brand and have it turn into some sort of dao related streaming service. Again, I think this is just a headline, and I will wait for this to turn into something real before I expend any more brain power on it.
00:39:43.420 - 00:39:45.218, Speaker A: But aren't memes real, David?
00:39:45.394 - 00:39:47.350, Speaker B: Not without fundamentals, Ryan.
00:39:47.930 - 00:39:55.190, Speaker A: Good answer, sir. Let's talk about this. Speaking of memes. So a meme made it onto jeopardy.
00:39:55.270 - 00:39:58.486, Speaker B: No, Constitution style is not a meme. That's not a meme.
00:39:58.678 - 00:40:13.262, Speaker A: I mean, you don't think it was a meme? There's tons of meme energy behind that. We're going to form a dow to buy the constitution. Nothing's more memey behind that. They were actually able to raise some money. So I guess maybe there were fundamentals. Maybe there's something there. There's maybe some fundamentals there.
00:40:13.262 - 00:40:29.970, Speaker A: Anyway, the jeopardy question from Alex Trubeck was billionaire hedge fund CEO Ken Griffin outbid a group of crypto enthusiasts and paid 43 million for a copy of this seminal american document. The answer, of course, is, what is constitution Dow?
00:40:30.050 - 00:40:33.670, Speaker B: Well, actually, no. The answer is, what is the constitution of the United States of America?
00:40:36.970 - 00:40:43.340, Speaker A: That's right. Bummer. Okay, I misread the answer, hoping it was Constitution Dao. Yeah, it was just.
00:40:45.310 - 00:40:45.818, Speaker B: Sorry.
00:40:45.904 - 00:40:53.870, Speaker A: Alex Trebek. I'm sorry. My apologies, sir. All right, moving on. Let's talk about Paris Hilton getting on the ETH leaderboard.
00:40:54.290 - 00:41:08.034, Speaker B: Yeah, so there's a website that tracks the most followed Twitter handles that have east following them. And Paris Hilton is now up there as well. A few other ones came in. Who was it? Oh, yeah.
00:41:08.072 - 00:41:08.862, Speaker A: Shaq. Shaq.
00:41:08.926 - 00:41:18.966, Speaker B: Shaq. And Paris Hilton. Paris Hilton is coming in at number one at 16.8 million followers. So Paris Hilton Eth on Twitter. Shaq EtH at 15.5 million.
00:41:18.966 - 00:41:30.150, Speaker B: We also have trace songs that's new to me. He's got a board ape at 13.8 million. And then coming in fifth is our friend Vitalik. Vitalik is number five.
00:41:30.220 - 00:41:30.882, Speaker A: Unseated.
00:41:30.946 - 00:41:34.966, Speaker B: Yeah, unseated big time. Coming in at a mere 3 million followers.
00:41:35.078 - 00:41:43.978, Speaker A: Look, I mean, he's going to be booted out of the top ten before long. It won't take much. Mainstream is coming to ETh domains. David, I'm sure you're somewhere on here, right?
00:41:44.064 - 00:41:46.026, Speaker B: Yeah, you're on here. You're on here.
00:41:46.128 - 00:41:46.886, Speaker A: We're all on here.
00:41:46.928 - 00:41:47.406, Speaker B: I think.
00:41:47.508 - 00:41:49.406, Speaker A: Not for long. We're not going to be on the front page for long.
00:41:49.428 - 00:41:51.594, Speaker B: We have 100,000 followers. Yeah, we're up there somewhere.
00:41:51.642 - 00:42:08.642, Speaker A: There you go. We're somewhere. But it's cool to see mainstream, I guess. Joining the ETH club mainstream is also joining board apes. So board apes just flipped crypto punks. I believe this was briefly or has it been persistent? I don't know. I haven't really paid attention.
00:42:08.642 - 00:42:18.854, Speaker A: But that was a flipping that some NFT holders were predicting for quite some time, and it actually happened. David, I know you're a crypto punk holder. What's your take on this?
00:42:18.972 - 00:42:38.206, Speaker B: Yeah, this is in regards to the floor price. So the floor price of board apes is at 59 e right now. And I'm pulling up the crypto punks. Oh, my gosh. Floor price, which is clocking in at 65.8 e. So crypto punks have reclaimed the higher floor price.
00:42:38.206 - 00:43:01.458, Speaker B: But I wrote this in the predictions article that we haven't released yet two weeks ago that I did say that board apes are probably going to flip punks just because I think they have so much more surface area. They're newer, they have the momentum. They're just kind of in pulp culture. So, I mean, board apes, one of the big stories of 2021 is definitely the board apes.
00:43:01.554 - 00:43:05.110, Speaker A: Are they doing different things versus crypto punks?
00:43:06.090 - 00:43:09.434, Speaker B: Cryptopunks are like the bitcoin of nfts. They don't do anything.
00:43:09.632 - 00:43:10.378, Speaker A: Okay.
00:43:10.544 - 00:43:18.230, Speaker B: There was a theory that bitcoin actually needs to pay for security and cryptopunks don't. And so cryptopunks can work where bitcoin.
00:43:18.390 - 00:43:21.014, Speaker A: That'S like the fat. The fat cryptopunk thesis.
00:43:21.062 - 00:43:21.466, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:43:21.568 - 00:43:22.170, Speaker A: Idea.
00:43:22.320 - 00:43:34.542, Speaker B: Yeah. We'll see how well that plays out into 2021. But crypto punks are definitely more of a crypto native. Ethereum native type of NFT. And the board apes have reached into new horizons and board apes are still building.
00:43:34.596 - 00:43:48.840, Speaker A: Right? Like, they're still doing things. They're adding utility to the board apes. And that never ending part of. Yeah, that's interesting. Snoop Dogg got in as well, David. So he just aped. And this is from his main account, not his Medici account.
00:43:48.840 - 00:43:50.918, Speaker A: Looks like he's got four.
00:43:51.084 - 00:43:56.198, Speaker B: Yeah. One actual board ape, two mutant board apes, and then a board ape kennel club as well.
00:43:56.284 - 00:44:03.706, Speaker A: Man, that's crazy. You know what I'm waiting for, though, is this graph right here. David, speaking of flipping, look at this.
00:44:03.808 - 00:44:04.474, Speaker B: Yeah, get out.
00:44:04.512 - 00:44:14.266, Speaker A: So first the apes pass the crypto punks. And then long term, real long term, this might be like years in the making. The turtles come and dominate.
00:44:14.458 - 00:44:18.634, Speaker B: I'm pretty sure that's like, at the end of this year, that green spike is like, for tomorrow, Ryan.
00:44:18.682 - 00:44:28.706, Speaker A: No, this is a dot, dot, dot. Who knows? That timeline just kind of like, this could take thousands of years, David. Turtles move at the speed of turtles. How it goes.
00:44:28.808 - 00:44:31.090, Speaker B: Turtles move at the speed of turtles.
00:44:32.150 - 00:44:38.950, Speaker A: Adidas, they just sold $22 million in nfts. That's crazy, man. So what are they doing here?
00:44:39.020 - 00:45:04.494, Speaker B: Yeah, they sold 30,000 nfts at 0.2 e each and they all sold out, which is nuts. They made $22 million. They also did this, right? They got into the NFT influencers. They bought a board, ape put on an adidas jacket on their board. Ape put it as their profile picture started doing and did nfts right. And so look what happens when you do nfts, right.
00:45:04.494 - 00:45:07.258, Speaker B: As a company, you get $22 million in revenue.
00:45:07.354 - 00:45:20.414, Speaker A: Crazy. They got to be so happy about that. And other brands have got to be following. I wonder who the buyers of these things are. Do you think this is more mainstream or do you think this is like, this can't be the traditional crypto.
00:45:20.462 - 00:45:29.490, Speaker B: Nft got to be mainstream even though, like $750 for an Adidas NFT, like, mainstream to ready to cough that up. That was kind of confusing.
00:45:29.570 - 00:45:31.622, Speaker A: That's sort of surprising. But, yeah, good for them.
00:45:31.676 - 00:45:33.222, Speaker B: Success either way.
00:45:33.356 - 00:45:54.570, Speaker A: The weeknd is releasing an NFT as well on Tom Brady's platform. His platform called autograph. This is a blinding lights single that is inspiring. Seven nfts that are going to be auctioned on OpenC. So now we have mainstream artists entering the fray as well. That's been a story that has been continuing to develop over the course of the year.
00:45:54.640 - 00:46:00.974, Speaker B: Nfts are for everyone, and we're just going to see celebrity, more and more celebrities all throughout 2022. So get used to it.
00:46:01.172 - 00:46:23.030, Speaker A: Get used to it. Should we get used to Facebook being called meta? I'm finding that hard to get used to. Okay, but let's call them meta. Here's the Facebook CTO promising deep compatibility between what meta is doing in the metaverse and blockchain. I guess they're bullish. Web three. At least that's what they're saying.
00:46:23.030 - 00:46:24.358, Speaker A: What do you think about this?
00:46:24.444 - 00:46:49.834, Speaker B: Yeah, deep compatibility is not what I want it to be. Which is built on top of compatibility implies two things coming together where the metaverse significantly needs to be built on top of a decentralized protocol. So nice try. Meta. Not a fan. But you know, they have to actually onboard crypto assets, crypto monies, NFts. Anyway, so I mean, this isn't anything a surprise.
00:46:49.834 - 00:46:51.818, Speaker B: This messaging is expected.
00:46:51.914 - 00:47:03.220, Speaker A: Do you think they still think that they can become like a blockchain killer? Do you think they think they are the metaverse or what do you think they're trying to do here?
00:47:04.790 - 00:47:20.546, Speaker B: They are probably at the very least, trying to become people's first metaverse. Like, hey, we want to get into the metaverse. Start with Facebook. I think they know they can't capture the whole entire thing because that's antithetical. But if they can, it's just a fight for mind share.
00:47:20.668 - 00:47:51.394, Speaker A: It's funny because it's something I'm still not worried about at all. I still think they don't have a shot at competing against the property rights and strong settlement guarantees of crypto networks. And they will have to provide deep compatibility with them in order to execute on their strategy. So, not worried about Facebook long term and its threat on web three. Let's talk about Jack. He's got a different perspective on web three. Jack Dorsey, the former CEO of Twitter, he of course, stepped down a few weeks ago.
00:47:51.394 - 00:47:58.094, Speaker A: That was a big story when we talked about it. But he's pretty anti web three, it seems like. What's this meme that we're looking at, David?
00:47:58.142 - 00:48:03.750, Speaker B: Jack Dorsey has been anti everything that's not bitcoin, basically, from as long as I can remember.
00:48:03.820 - 00:48:04.626, Speaker A: Everything in crypto.
00:48:04.658 - 00:48:59.720, Speaker B: Yeah, everything in crypto is not bitcoin. Jack's not a fan of it, and he's explained some of his reasoning why, but it boils down to the same old arguments that he thinks that nothing other than bitcoin is actually decentralized and everything else is just a cash grab. So he retweeted a comic that has a pipe just flowing water into the mouth of Silicon Valley vcs. Meanwhile, there's a very famished looking retail investor that is under a small, small hole in the pipe just getting some drops, just a few drops. And so all the value of web three, what Jack is claiming is he's retweeted this with the 100 emoji. He's claiming that web three is just putting all the value into Silicon Valley vcs and implying that web three is just this vc created way to make a bunch of money. Just overall, very cynical and skeptical on the fact of the idea of web three at all.
00:48:59.720 - 00:49:23.646, Speaker B: I have my opinions on this. Jack follows this up and says, you don't own, quote, web three. The vcs and their lps do. It will never escape their incentives. It's ultimately a centralized entity with a different label. Know what you're getting into. So, wow, some pretty harsh words coming out of Jack Dorsey, founder of Twitter, about the whole entire concept of web three.
00:49:23.646 - 00:49:25.554, Speaker B: I've got my thoughts. Ryan, what do you think?
00:49:25.672 - 00:50:05.900, Speaker A: Well, I think harsh and wrong, right? So the idea that vcs are the owners of web three s, I think this is particular to some protocols, right? Some D five protocols, maybe governance protocols. You could say vcs own some of those. But at its core, something like ethereum, which is actually depicted in this meme, is not VC owned. It's really interesting that there were no vcs as part of the original sale of ethereum. Like, for one, here's Bellagi saying Ethereum raised $0 from vcs as kind of a comment on this. And I mean, that's true. Also, vcs do not control.
00:50:05.900 - 00:50:44.458, Speaker A: Like, if you think vcs control ethereum, then you have to apply those same rules to bitcoin and say, like whales and vcs control bitcoin, but they don't, they don't control ethereum. They don't control bitcoin. So the entire assertion is false. Maybe he's like focusing on some sliver or some subset of web three that we have criticized, as well as being kind of overly whale or vc owned the finance chains of the world. You make the case for that. You make the case for some d five protocols. You could make the case maybe for some elements of alternative layer ones.
00:50:44.458 - 00:50:51.482, Speaker A: But I think it's unfair to categorize all of web three as being completely owned by vcs. What's your take?
00:50:51.616 - 00:51:41.690, Speaker B: Apparently, if you were following this story very in depth, that Jack was really going after a 16 Z and Adrisson Horowitz specifically apparently has a bone to pick with them. I think that's kind of what's going on under the hood, more sense. But overall, there's been a ton of investment, a ton of deal flow into a ton of web three platforms, web three protocols that are happening right now. So maybe this critique is more about 2021 web three and not like maybe the foundations of how Ethereum didn't raise any money from vcs. Maybe he's talking about more about the apps that have raised money recently. But there's still some big things that we need to parse apart here. First off, the comic of all this value flowing into vcs mouths and then the retail just only getting droplets we have to remember where we came from, because before web three, it was absolutely nothing into retail.
00:51:41.690 - 00:52:19.222, Speaker B: It would go straight into vcs and you would never even hear about it. So the fact that we are even complaining about this just tells you how much web three actually has moved the needle. Retail didn't even have an option or even knowledge about how to complain about not having deal flow from early stage startups. Now that we actually have a taste of it because of web three, now we actually put up a fight about like, hey, don't give all the money to vcs, you got to give some to the retail too. So first off, there's that. The Overton window has already shifted to the point where we are allowed to complain about this in the first place. Did you see, by the way, there's goddamn airdrops.
00:52:19.222 - 00:52:56.274, Speaker B: What are airdrops except for giving tokens and value towards users? The uniswap airdrop, the Ens airdrop, the Gitcoin airdrop, all the airdrops. Every single airdrop you've ever gotten. You didn't even have to invest, you just had to use it. The vcs had to invest money. The users just had to use it for free. And so there's a great meme of somebody crying with wiping their tears with $100 bills and the caption is me with my Ens airdrop after Jack said, web three only makes money for vcs. To me, this is one of those things that it's actually so incredibly the opposite of what Jack is saying.
00:52:56.274 - 00:53:09.526, Speaker B: That is kind of dumbfounding. Somehow Jack went full circle and said, web three is all about giving money to vcs. It's literally the opposite. It is literally about how can we make our users wealthy. That is what Web three is.
00:53:09.708 - 00:53:40.514, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree with that. There's also another comment from Belagi. He says, I respect everything you built talking to Jack, but I also disagree here. Twitter started as a protocol, the free speech wing of the free speech party. Then corporate and political incentives led to deplatforming and censorship. Web three offers the possibility, not a guarantee, of something better, turning Twitter into a protocol, something that unfortunately, Jack was not able to accomplish during his tenure at Twitter. He says he follows up.
00:53:40.514 - 00:54:37.938, Speaker A: Of course, I don't believe Twitter set out to bait and switch developers or promise free speech, get people to invest years in their profiles, then censor them. But that is where the incentives landed upon Web three's smart contracts may prove more durable than web two's social contracts. This is what I also fundamentally don't understand about Jack's take is Web three offers a solution to the things that Jack claims are his values, which is values of free speech and minimization of censorship resistance. So I don't know. It's ongoing back and forth between Jack Dorsey and the web three and crypto community. I guess my invitation would be this to Jack is like, I think the community wants a longer conversation about this with you, Jack. Are you rejecting the VC definition of web three, or are you rejecting the entire premise of web three? That's a question that I think we have.
00:54:37.938 - 00:55:12.206, Speaker A: Do you see bitcoin as web three? I mean, the way you and I define web three, David, it's kind of synonymous with crypto. And so if you say you hate web three, then do you also hate bitcoin? Also, Ethereum is like very close to bitcoin from a values perspective, right? It's like Vitalik has called it moderate bitcoin values. And I really feel like that's the case. So why the hate for ethereum all of the time? That's the discussion we want to have with Jack Dorsey on the Bankless podcast. Dms are open, man. So come on, let's talk about it. Let's hash it out.
00:55:12.206 - 00:55:38.354, Speaker A: Ray Dalio, someone else we want to get on the podcast. I've been listening to a lot of Ray Dalio podcasts actually, over the past week or so break. But apparently he says crypto should be part of a diversified portfolio. This is new in 2021. He wasn't saying this in previous years. This is new for Ray Dalio, of course. Billionaire hedge fund investor, fantastic insights on long term macro trends.
00:55:38.354 - 00:55:42.518, Speaker A: Have a lot of respect for him. Now. He's coming around to crypto, it seems. Any thoughts here?
00:55:42.604 - 00:56:13.138, Speaker B: Yeah, I think I would classify Ray Dalio in 2000 and 22,021 as cautiously optimistic. And now at the end of 2021, I would call Ray Dalio decently well convinced. Listening to him on the Alex Friedman podcast, and also in this article right here, he talks about how bitcoin has stood the test of time. And so this is one of our biggest advantages in the crypto industry. We have time on our side. If you don't invest in crypto in the first zero through five years, totally fine. Five to ten years, totally fine.
00:56:13.138 - 00:56:33.078, Speaker B: But ten to 20 years now, you're going to have to start to actually account for, like, hey, it's been here for a while. It's not going away. And Ray Dalio, I think he's calling it good. At twelve years of crypto, he's like, okay, twelve years of crypto, it's here to stay. And now it should be a part of your portfolio. And so I think that's a perfectly pragmatic and reasonable conclusion.
00:56:33.174 - 00:56:48.334, Speaker A: Do you know, David, on the podcast I was listening to, he's actually talked about nfts too, issuing his own nfts, purchasing nfts. It's really funny how all of this provides surface area to getting people on the crypto train, right, because it's one.
00:56:48.372 - 00:56:54.686, Speaker B: Thing to just stick around for twelve years, but it's also one thing to also, as an ecosystem, be exponentially growing for twelve years.
00:56:54.868 - 00:57:10.930, Speaker A: Exactly. And garnering more attention. I mean, it's always part of the conversation. Everyone wants to talk about it. So this is the story we're talking about in releases. A little bit alluded to this crypto exchange, Kraken, that is a crypto bank. Crypto exchange, they just acquired staking startup staked.
00:57:10.930 - 00:58:04.690, Speaker A: So staked like figment, which is $1 billion unicorn type valuation status, is a staking services provider, and they were just acquired by a crypto bank. What's interesting about this story, David, is I spent some time in the staking game, actually, I was with Figment and staked, one of the original validators on the Cosmos network back in the day. And one of the things I saw happening is because cosmos and many of these other protocols operate almost like a delegated proof of stake type of network. So individuals really don't run their own nodes, run their own staking nodes in these types of networks. They generally, they stake them with a third party, someone you trust. Right. And so one thing that I observed in my days kind of staking and part of these networks is like they were all becoming sort of like whale staking service providers.
00:58:04.690 - 00:59:01.754, Speaker A: They had to, in order to make their margins and do the best in the game. And so in that kind of game, the thing I saw was the bigger fish would just snap up the smaller fish, and then you'd get a smaller and smaller pool of staking service companies over time. And this is finally what's happening, right. I was pretty certain at that time that all the staking service companies would eventually you either go public or you're acquired by a crypto bank of some form or another. And to me, that is such a, it's a very big centralization vector for this entire space, because now essentially all you're doing is you are staking directly with Kraken and you're kind of back to square one. So like Coinbase of the world, they're smart, they're going to grow their business. They're going to acquire other staking service providers too.
00:59:01.754 - 00:59:26.626, Speaker A: And they have in the past, they've acquired buys and trails, for instance, and incorporated that into their staking service provider. So the protocol itself, I feel like, is incentive and basically pushes in the direction of more centralization with fewer and fewer staking parties. And we're seeing this with stake here. I don't fault staked for this. Right. And obviously this is a good play for Kraken. So I understand why everyone's doing it.
00:59:26.626 - 00:59:43.960, Speaker A: It's just back to the fundamental decentralization of so called layer one protocols. There has to be some resistance against this or you'll end up with just a very small set of staking service providers that everyone's using. And then what's the point?
00:59:45.050 - 01:00:08.320, Speaker B: There's a huge line between being able to stake on computers that you naturally find in people's homes and any other type of staking, because any other type of staking just more and more tilts towards centralization, especially delegated proof of stake. Delegated proof of stake and actual proof of stake are completely different beasts. And that's all I will say about that.
01:00:08.690 - 01:00:17.506, Speaker A: Yes. All right, let's keep moving. A 16 z. They just put out a poll. Voters prefer candidates that support web three.
01:00:17.608 - 01:00:17.922, Speaker B: Nice.
01:00:17.976 - 01:00:45.274, Speaker A: The title of this poll. Americans want policymakers to play an active role in supporting the next generation of the Internet. This is from a survey of individuals in the US. One in five people in the US own cryptocurrency. The survey finds 35% of those between 18 and 34, a key demographic. Kind of cool, I guess. More support for the idea that voters will vote in candidates who support web three.
01:00:45.472 - 01:00:59.102, Speaker B: Crypto. The word crypto has always had this negative connotation. It scares my Boomer parents. Like, oh, crypto. Like, oh, weird stuff's happening. Web three is the perfect rebrand for cryptocurrency. It just fits right in.
01:00:59.102 - 01:01:31.782, Speaker B: People understand it. They kind of understand that there's an evolution of all the negative stuff that's happening with Facebook causing civil wars and how we're moving into a digital future with NFTs and web three. It's just enough to get people's heads wrapped around it. And turns out it's a huge hit with people. It just pulls well. So shout out to a future podcast episode that's coming with Erica Rhodes running to unseat Brad Sherman, the guy that was making fun of about crypto and mongoose coins and Congress and all that stuff. We're having her on state of the nation sometime in January.
01:01:31.782 - 01:01:53.854, Speaker B: We're going to talk about her being a web three candidate, if she likes the web three branding and if she's trying to lean into that. So also if you are in the California 30th district, which is northwest of LA, Erica Rhodes might be your representative. And if that's true, we need you to vote for her. So we're going to talk about that on the state of the nation. So stay tuned for next couple of weeks when that comes out.
01:01:54.052 - 01:02:00.322, Speaker A: All right guys, we will be right back with the takes of the week, but before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
01:02:00.456 - 01:02:43.982, Speaker B: Matcha, everyone's favorite Dex aggregator, has just launched an open beta for gasless trading. So if you're trading more than $5,000 in common ETH and wrapped bitcoin pairs, then your gas fees on matcha are free. And that's why you should be using Matcha. Matcha routes your orders across all the various DFI exchanges on Ethereum Polygon finance smart chain and gives you the best possible price without any trading fees or unnecessary slippage. Matcha has smart order routing that splits your orders across multiple liquidity sources. If matcha sees that it gets you better pricing. Trading on Matcha is super easy because it pools the liquidity for me into a single and easy to use platform and has even saved me multiple times from accidentally picking the wrong decks to trade on and getting a bad price.
01:02:43.982 - 01:03:21.690, Speaker B: Matcha also allows you to make limit orders on chain so you can set and forget your defi trades and they will go through automatically while you're away. So when you're making a trade, head over to matcha XYZ slash bankless, connect your wallet and start getting some of the best prices and most liquidity. When you trade your crypto assets, living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys. Not your keys, not your crypto. That's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallet, which makes proper private key management a breeze. But the ledger ecosystem is much more than just a secure hardware wallet. Ledger is the combination of the ledger hardware wallet and the Ledger live app.
01:03:21.690 - 01:04:04.906, Speaker B: And if you're used to seeing all of your crypto services and favorite defi apps all in one spot, Ledger Live is where you want to be. Not only does ledger let you buy your crypto assets straight from the app, but it also hooks into all of the defi apps and services that you're used to using Ledger live you can stake your ethan Lido, swap on Dexs like Paraswap, or display your nfts with Rainbow. You can also use wallet Connect inside of Ledger Live to connect to all the other defi apps that keep coming online. Defi never stops growing and the Ledger live app grows alongside with it. So click the link in the show notes to see all of the defi apps that Ledger Live has. And stay tuned as more apps come online. And if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet, what are you even waiting for? Go to ledger.com,
01:04:04.906 - 01:04:09.818, Speaker B: grab a ledger, download Ledger live and get all of your defi apps all in one space.
01:04:09.904 - 01:04:28.002, Speaker A: Alright guys, we are back with the hot takes of the week. Let's start with this first one from Hugh Karp. He's the founder of Nexus Mutual Insurance protocol. So not surprised with this take. Not valuing decentralization is like being uninsured, he says most of the time it's fine and then it's not. What does he mean?
01:04:28.136 - 01:04:48.230, Speaker B: I think that's just a great way to illustrate the value of decentralization. Decentralization is this invisible shield of protection that you're not supposed to notice. You're not supposed to notice a decentralization and it's there for you regardless of whether you're thinking about it or not. Yeah, I think it's a great take.
01:04:48.380 - 01:04:55.706, Speaker A: Yeah, it's there for you and then most of the time it's fine and then it's not. In what cases does it become not fine?
01:04:55.888 - 01:05:31.814, Speaker B: Oh, so many different cases. Well, it also depends on the severity of the centralization. I mean, if you have all your money with a bank and then the bank goes under, boom, you're f'd. If you are on a centralized blockchain and the blockchain halts and you need to get your money out, ouch. Decentralization just protects you against not only just like accidental bugs in code, but also just from centralized control banks. You actually don't own your own money. When you put your money in a bank, they give you ious and so you have to trust that.
01:05:31.814 - 01:05:42.154, Speaker B: And so there are so many different attack vectors that are just completely mitigated with decentralization. And so without decentralization, you're kind of at risk to all of them.
01:05:42.352 - 01:06:41.194, Speaker A: I always worry about here. Maybe this is a point about insurance too, is humans are really notoriously bad at quantifying risk and assessing risk, particularly over longer term time horizons. And I think this is why we have such a hard time quantifying the value of decentralization is because if everything is going okay and the banks aren't stealing from you and binance isn't halting the chain, and the hedge fund isn't calling Robinhood to halt stock trades, reverse trades, then it all works very seamlessly and it all seems fine. But it's those edge cases when you really need decentralization, and that's the value. But human beings are really bad at quantifying this and taking that risk into account. So I don't know if we'll ever get out of that cycle. But it doesn't just provide a defense to the individual.
01:06:41.194 - 01:06:58.722, Speaker A: I guess I would say it's a defense to the entire system. Like it's a public good for the entire system. Kind of like similar to privacy. What's the value of privacy? It's like the value is aggregated. It's a public good for everyone in society. It's not just for one individual. Yeah.
01:06:58.722 - 01:07:10.582, Speaker A: So I don't know. Hopefully humans have the ability to quantify that a little bit better. This is Layton with the tweet. Quantifying some things, though. Quantifying hacks. Why don't you take this, David? Yeah.
01:07:10.636 - 01:07:41.438, Speaker B: Not only quantifying hacks, but also comparing the size of hacks to bank overdraft fees in 2020. So in 2021, crypto lost $7.7 billion in crypto hacks and scams. But in 2020, $12.4 billion was lost in bank overdraft fees. So all of these hacks that we're just like in an uproar about and all these exploits that people get money and they get frustrated. Bank overdraft fees were almost twice that amount in 2020.
01:07:41.438 - 01:07:49.838, Speaker B: And so Layton finishes off saying all the scammers and hackers in the world still can't rob people as well as banks can. Nice and spicy. Nice job, Layton.
01:07:49.934 - 01:07:55.154, Speaker A: I love that. By the way, bank overdraft fees is just one of the ways banks steal your money, right?
01:07:55.192 - 01:07:57.266, Speaker B: That's just one product from them.
01:07:57.368 - 01:08:04.806, Speaker A: Yeah, it's just one of many. Let's see this tweet. This is a quote from Vitalik from a recent interview. What's this quote? Yeah.
01:08:04.828 - 01:08:50.786, Speaker B: He says, I think the big difference between bitcoin and ethereum is that bitcoin is a platform where the value of the ecosystem comes from the value of the currency. And in Ethereum, the value of the currency comes from the value of the ecosystem. And this is something that I've said in a different capacity. I always like to say the bitcoin blockchain is meant to serve BTC, the asset. Whereas in Ethereum, the ether, the currency, is meant to serve Ethereum, the blockchain, or ethereum, the economy. Ether, the currency, is a means to an end, to provide the strongest security to Ethereum possible, so that Ethereum can host as many things as possible securely. Bitcoin, the blockchain, is a blockchain that the whole, entire point of it is to do one purpose, which is to allow for 21 million bitcoins to be sent from wallet to wallet.
01:08:50.786 - 01:09:10.970, Speaker B: And that's the whole thing. And so there's just different priorities in these things. And so you can go ahead and choose your ecosystem with whatever values that you resonate with. Do you resonate with the hard cap, or do you value a platform that has free and public security for all applications? Or you can do both. But that's kind of the main differences between these two ecosystems.
01:09:11.310 - 01:09:54.714, Speaker A: The interesting thing about that, too, is ether the asset scales as well. With Ethereum, the, you know, bitcoin, not so much. Bitcoin to me is a bit more like gold and ether, and ethereum to me is a bit more like, we use the analogy of a nation state, crypto nation state. It's a bit more like the United States, right? Not a fiat currency, because this currency is scarce and deflationary and cannot be changed and ultrasound cannot be changed by a central government. But it scales in the way the US's S and P 500 scales according to the value and the growth of GDP, the value and growth of the economy. So it's a different way to value these assets as well. Let's talk about this.
01:09:54.714 - 01:10:17.402, Speaker A: Take. This is our last one of the week from Daniel got hits. Yeah, Daniel got hits is the Twitter handle. People say crypto is too risky for me. Me being dependent on a single employer for all of my income and not being able to access my retirement funds until I'm 65 is too risky for me. Good point. I love what you're thinking.
01:10:17.476 - 01:10:42.054, Speaker B: I love this. And this reminds me of a quote from Naseem Taleb's book Antifragile, where he compares two people with different jobs. One of them is a barber, and the other one is like a white collar office worker. The barber has very unstable, volatile income. Sometimes five people come into his shop every single day. Sometimes zero people come into his shop. His income is volatile.
01:10:42.054 - 01:11:30.086, Speaker B: But over the long term, his job security is stable because hair grows, whereas the white collar worker, his income is very, very stable. It's a cool $60,000 a year promised by his salary that he's going to get it no matter what. But his job security is very unstable because he might just get axed at any moment. And so this is about leaning in towards volatility as a way to actually grow stronger and more robust as an individual. And so if you work in crypto, a highly volatile, highly rapid environment, you actually gain job security because you learn how to live in a volatile world. And the skills that you come out with and the connections that you've come out with, the opportunity costs of being in crypto is just immense. And so there's just different kinds of risk out there.
01:11:30.086 - 01:11:38.746, Speaker B: Like, what kind of risk do you want? Do you want the risk of crypto volatility in the assets, or do you want the risk of absolutely getting left behind in your corporate job?
01:11:38.928 - 01:11:48.074, Speaker A: This is why I have such a hard time answering the question of, like, is crypto a risky asset? Because I honestly, in my heart of hearts, I don't think it's a risky asset.
01:11:48.122 - 01:11:48.522, Speaker B: I don't.
01:11:48.586 - 01:11:50.698, Speaker A: Okay, it's a volatile asset.
01:11:50.874 - 01:11:53.614, Speaker B: But volatility, people conflate those things way too much.
01:11:53.732 - 01:12:38.174, Speaker A: And, in fact, finance textbooks conflate those things. This is what finance people are taught, that volatility equals risk, like the one and the same. But that's not actually true. Right. Crypto is far less risky than it first appears, even though price fluctuates and it's far more volatile. And I think the things in our everyday life that we don't quantify, right, like inflation, for instance, or collapse of the central bank, digital currency, or a job loss, or my job, just basically. And the skills that I have, like losing all value in the economy because the economy converts to some new form and becomes more digital and enters the metaverse, that sort of thing.
01:12:38.174 - 01:12:47.138, Speaker A: The risks of those things aren't quantified by the average individual when they're just following the path that everyone else takes. So, yeah, way less risky than people think.
01:12:47.224 - 01:12:54.386, Speaker B: Ryan, what do you think is going to be here in 100 years? What's more likely, ethereum or the US dollar? See, that's 100 years.
01:12:54.488 - 01:12:56.910, Speaker A: That's so easy to answer. For me. It's definitely ethereum.
01:12:56.990 - 01:13:02.706, Speaker B: Yeah. Even in its relatively nascent form. Yeah, totally. Answer is still ethereum.
01:13:02.818 - 01:13:13.660, Speaker A: 100%. Yeah, like, 100%. And I guess that's why I'm betting the way I'm betting and you're betting the way you're betting, but a lot of people don't realize that. David, what? Are you excited about this?
01:13:14.190 - 01:13:59.170, Speaker B: I'm actually. I got something else other than being excited not to say I'm not excited, but I'm reading this book called Humankind. It's the case that humans are inherently good, and it's just a very feel good book to read, by the way. So if anyone is feeling, like, down or they just need something to pick them up, read this book called Humankind. It's the case that humans are just inherently good. And, Ryan, while I was reading this book, they were talking about how humans succeeded where neanderthals didn't. And one of the reasons why they said that while our brain powers were about the same, the main difference between the neanderthal brain and the human brain is that our brains are all connected better, as in we're very, very social creatures.
01:13:59.170 - 01:14:12.080, Speaker B: So my question to you, Ryan, is this isn't true at all, but I'm just going to say that it is for hyperbole's sake. What do you think? The very first consensus mechanism that humanity ever had, what do you think that was?
01:14:13.090 - 01:14:23.166, Speaker A: I would probably say language would be my guess, but there's probably stuff before that. But the big one that comes to mind is definitely language.
01:14:23.278 - 01:14:52.922, Speaker B: So going even earlier than that, the main difference in the evolutionary paths of neanderthals versus humans is humans developed whites of eyes, and neanderthals had very, very big black eyes, and so they didn't really have whites of the eyes. And the whites of human eyes allows me to look at you and see what you're looking at. And so my node can check out your node and see what your node. That's wild. Yeah. And so, like, oh, Ryan's looking over there. Why is he looking over there? I'm going to go look over there.
01:14:52.922 - 01:15:12.202, Speaker B: And all of a sudden, a group of people can all come to consensus about where other people's attention is. So the humans have been social creatures from day one, and that's been our main competitive advantage because we've been able to sync up with each other. We've all been on the same protocols. And so whites of the eyes, the OG consensus mechanism, that's wild.
01:15:12.266 - 01:15:28.942, Speaker A: I guess this is why also humans developed a fantastic facial recognition software. Right. How much of communication is nonverbal? Like 90, 90%, 95%. It's like tone intonation, but also body language, facial expression, that's all nonverbal. I guess that's baked into our dna.
01:15:29.086 - 01:15:34.070, Speaker B: So learning that Ryan was what I have been excited about. Ryan, what are you excited about?
01:15:34.220 - 01:15:48.262, Speaker A: That's cool, man. Well, look, I'm just excited about next year. I'm excited about 2022. I'm excited about bankless. We've got a killer lineup of podcasts starting the first one of the year with Vitalik, a number of others in Q one. Super excited about that. Excited about crypto.
01:15:48.262 - 01:16:00.542, Speaker A: I'm bullish crypto. David, you believe that? I'm bullish crypto? Yeah. But a lot's going on. Okay. Like roll up. Still haven't had their moment, so that's all ahead of us. The Ethereum merge hasn't happened yet.
01:16:00.542 - 01:16:19.880, Speaker A: That's still ahead of us. Been waiting for that for years. Right? I know both of us have. NFTs are just starting. Well, maybe they'll have a bear market in between, but there'll be new use cases for nfts unlocked. We're just tapping into this thing called dows and figuring out how that works. So 2022, I'm going in there.
01:16:19.880 - 01:16:48.222, Speaker A: I'm bullish, both from a price perspective, but I'm also bullish. Chris Dixon style bullish in the podcast. He's like, hey, I look at the builder cycles. I don't care about the price cycles. I look at the builder cycles, and I'm seeing more builders, more talent entering this space than ever. So it's like being simultaneously bullish on price of these assets and mainstream attention and also bullish on the building that's getting done in this space. It's a really cool, unique time for crypto that I don't think we've ever seen before.
01:16:48.222 - 01:16:54.480, Speaker A: 2021 was a breakout year in a lot of ways, but I'm just as bullish, if not more so, going to 2022.
01:16:54.930 - 01:16:57.986, Speaker B: I'm just as bullish right there with you, my man.
01:16:58.168 - 01:17:05.918, Speaker A: All right, two bulls on the bankless podcast. Bullish from day one. Can't go wrong there. All right, here we go. Meme of the week time. David, what are we looking at?
01:17:06.024 - 01:17:27.420, Speaker B: We are looking at an actual, real, completely undoctored photograph of somebody at their wedding eating their weding dinner. They just got married, and the grooms got his phone out, watching the bankless weekly roll up while he eats dinner with his new wife. Totally real. It totally happened. Haters will say it's fake. And that is your meme of the week.
01:17:27.790 - 01:17:47.854, Speaker A: What a great meme to wrap up 2021, guys. We hope you have a happy new year, and we'll see you again in 2022. As always, none of this was financial advice. None of the things we talked about on bankless in 2021 were financial advice. ETH is and remains risky. So is DFI. You could definitely lose what you put in, but we are headed west.
01:17:47.854 - 01:17:53.154, Speaker A: This is the frontier. It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
