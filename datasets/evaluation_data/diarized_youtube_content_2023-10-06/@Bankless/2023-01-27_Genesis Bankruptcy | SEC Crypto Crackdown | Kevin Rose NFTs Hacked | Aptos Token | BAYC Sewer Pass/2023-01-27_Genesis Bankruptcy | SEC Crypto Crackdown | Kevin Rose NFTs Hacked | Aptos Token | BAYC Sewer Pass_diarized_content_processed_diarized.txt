00:00:00.170 - 00:00:16.960, Speaker A: Kevin Rose has gotten his multi million dollar NFT collection swiped, drained. So that's that's unfortunate. Pretty brutal. We'll talk about that. And we'll also talk about how you can protect your NFTs from getting fished. Because if Kevin Rose can get fished, you can, too.
00:00:19.330 - 00:00:23.966, Speaker B: Bankless Nation. It is the fourth Friday of January, david, what time is it?
00:00:24.068 - 00:00:37.240, Speaker A: It's the Friday Bankless weekly roll up, Ryan, where we cover the entire weekly news in crypto, which is always an ambitious endeavor, yet we persevere nonetheless into the frontier with coffee. I've already had two cups. How many are you at?
00:00:37.690 - 00:00:47.818, Speaker B: Four or five. You know the answer to this? It's always the same. I'm pretty regular, you know, like regular coffee drinking old chap is what I am.
00:00:47.984 - 00:00:49.158, Speaker A: How's your ember mug?
00:00:49.254 - 00:00:53.420, Speaker B: It's pretty good. It's retaining the heat. Use it all the time.
00:00:53.870 - 00:00:56.030, Speaker A: This is not an ad, actually.
00:00:56.100 - 00:01:07.438, Speaker B: It's not an ad? No, actually. So what happened is my office is, like, right down the hall from my kitchen, and I would go from my office to my kitchen, like, many times a day to heat up my coffee.
00:01:07.614 - 00:01:10.162, Speaker A: The most frequent time you would leave your office is to go do that.
00:01:10.216 - 00:01:29.910, Speaker B: Well, but think about it, right? So, like, three different coffee heatings per cup of coffee times five, that's 15 per day. Anyway, my microwave button broke off, like, completely disintegrated under the pressure of all of the clicks, so I had to order a 3D printer part.
00:01:29.980 - 00:01:38.662, Speaker A: I'm just getting printed. The microwave of this robot not knowing how to control its own strength and just, like, snapping off its microwave paddle as it tries to open the door.
00:01:38.726 - 00:01:48.202, Speaker B: No, I was going easy on it, but yeah, it just wasn't built for that kind of pressure. Anyway, we're not talking microwaves or coffee today. What are we talking about? Topics of the week. David, what are we covering?
00:01:48.266 - 00:02:06.034, Speaker A: Topics of the week. Genesis officially filing for Chapter Eleven. That saga is coming to a close, so we discuss the fallout, of course. Sadly, in other news, kevin Rose has gotten his multi million dollar NFT collection swiped. Ryan, what else are we going to talk about?
00:02:06.152 - 00:02:20.554, Speaker B: We're going to talk about the SEC. They came in with a big old banhammer this week. Caroline Ellison, gary Wang. Nexo. A whole bunch of action by the SEC. And we're also going to be talking about a fire speech from SEC Commissioner Hester purse. Stay tuned for that.
00:02:20.554 - 00:02:51.730, Speaker B: And doodles migrating to flow. Pudgy penguins migrating to Arbitrum, uniswap migrating to BSc. Is everybody moving from Ethereum? David, we got to talk about that, too. And of course, we got to remind you to like and subscribe if you enjoy this episode. If you're on YouTube, hit that like button, subscribe to the channel. If you're listening on the podcast player, then hit subscribe as well. David, before we get into this episode, got to talk for a minute about taxes and you know, I've always taken the time to talk about crypto tax calculator during the last few weeks.
00:02:51.730 - 00:02:57.454, Speaker B: This time it's your time. I'm going to hand this to you. What do you want to tell us about taxes and crypto tax calculator, David?
00:02:57.502 - 00:03:50.230, Speaker A: Okay, so if you're like me, you majored in a discipline that has nothing to do with money or finance and your parents are the same and never taught you about taxes. And so you had to figure it out for yourself because crypto was your first entrance into the world of business and finance and also taxes. And that probably means you need something like the crypto tax calculator that we are showing on the screen right now because you don't know how to do taxes. And so you use something like the crypto tax calculator, which there's a link in the show notes to go use to help you sort out your crypto tax nightmare, especially as crypto is getting more complex. First you have ether, then you got staked ether, wrapped staked ether on Arbitrum that is going to yield farm that is brand new. Well, crypto tax calculator can help you out with all of that. It's got all the layer ones, all the layer two s, many, many DFI apps, 300,000 currencies, which I didn't even know we had that many.
00:03:50.230 - 00:04:13.866, Speaker A: And it's as simple as just plugging in your ethereum wallet, putting in your transactions and they will do the rest. There's a link in the show notes for 30% off for bankless listeners, that link, that code is bank 30. But if you are a bankless premium subscriber, you get 40% off from a secret code that is in the bankless nation disc accord. So go there to get your tax off. How'd you like that pitch, Ryan?
00:04:13.898 - 00:04:18.654, Speaker B: That was pretty good, guys. Take it from the psych major, not from the business major. I think you pitched it better than me, my friend.
00:04:18.772 - 00:04:22.574, Speaker A: Of course, business majors don't need the tax calculator nearly as much as the psych major.
00:04:22.692 - 00:04:34.242, Speaker B: That's right. And I was too excited about it. That was actually practical advice. Good job, David. All right, let's get to markets then. Bitcoin as measured by dollars. We still measure bitcoin in dollars.
00:04:34.242 - 00:04:39.878, Speaker B: We don't measure it in bitcoin dollar. Let's see where we at on the week. Up or down.
00:04:39.964 - 00:04:41.110, Speaker A: Big up almost.
00:04:41.180 - 00:04:41.958, Speaker B: Big up again.
00:04:42.044 - 00:04:49.800, Speaker A: Big up again. Started the week at $22,200, up 9.2% to where we are now at $23,000.
00:04:50.410 - 00:04:51.820, Speaker B: How are we doing this?
00:04:53.310 - 00:04:55.226, Speaker A: Things keep going, going up, man.
00:04:55.408 - 00:04:59.740, Speaker B: I mean, I'm going to start having to say bear market with a question mark at the end of it. Bear market.
00:05:01.310 - 00:05:03.290, Speaker A: Let's not get ahead of ourselves. It's like four days.
00:05:03.360 - 00:05:09.998, Speaker B: We'll talk about that. Well, I mean, it's been three weeks in a row, almost double digit up. You're right. Let's talk ETH price too, is that.
00:05:10.164 - 00:05:23.778, Speaker A: 1530 was where we were last week. We are at one $600 a hair above oh, a hair below one $600. We were above one $600 a second ago, up 4.5% on the week. So only up half as much as bitcoin this week.
00:05:23.864 - 00:05:26.850, Speaker B: Does that mean bitcoin gained some ground on the old ratio?
00:05:26.930 - 00:05:31.206, Speaker A: That means we are down below zero. Seven on the ratio, 69.
00:05:31.308 - 00:05:32.710, Speaker B: You mad about that, David?
00:05:34.490 - 00:05:36.390, Speaker A: Just noise, brother, just noise.
00:05:37.210 - 00:05:40.110, Speaker B: Do you still have any bets outstanding on this ratio?
00:05:40.290 - 00:05:45.798, Speaker A: Yeah, my BTC ratio is like that is a multi year long position I'm holding.
00:05:45.894 - 00:05:48.662, Speaker B: How are you doing that? Trade compound?
00:05:48.806 - 00:05:50.570, Speaker A: No. Excuse me. Yeah.
00:05:50.720 - 00:05:56.926, Speaker B: Okay, cool. Yeah. So you're betting that ratio and holding for the long run, right. What's your time horizon on that?
00:05:56.948 - 00:06:00.080, Speaker A: Multi year, you say until the lappening? Yeah.
00:06:00.610 - 00:06:03.338, Speaker B: Not the flipping. Okay. The lappening.
00:06:03.434 - 00:06:06.014, Speaker A: Which is what, double two X bitcoin.
00:06:06.062 - 00:06:08.900, Speaker B: Yeah, two X bitcoin in market cap.
00:06:09.750 - 00:06:12.030, Speaker A: Maybe even the third lappening. Who knows?
00:06:12.110 - 00:06:17.050, Speaker B: Okay, so what does that mean? ETH would have to appreciate by what is that? Five x and bitcoin.
00:06:17.150 - 00:06:30.482, Speaker A: So if Ether doubles versus bitcoin, that's the flipping, and then it doubles again versus bitcoin, which is the lappening. So that is up four X from current bitcoin prices is when I will perhaps consider to unwind this trade.
00:06:30.546 - 00:06:34.154, Speaker B: Perhaps. But then you'll feel like it's only going to go up from there.
00:06:34.352 - 00:06:40.746, Speaker A: Like I said, ether doesn't stop at the flipping. It starts lapping bitcoin. That's how it goes.
00:06:40.848 - 00:06:45.578, Speaker B: Can you imagine this industry on the day that that happens, the flippining happens? Can you imagine?
00:06:45.674 - 00:06:49.566, Speaker A: It would be the most healthy and progressive thing to ever I don't think.
00:06:49.588 - 00:06:55.594, Speaker B: It'S going to sound very healthy on your Twitter feed or my Twitter feed when that day happens.
00:06:55.652 - 00:06:56.018, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:06:56.104 - 00:07:00.974, Speaker B: But I'll be feeling okay about it. All right. Global cryptocurrency market cap, we above a trillion.
00:07:01.022 - 00:07:05.378, Speaker A: Above a trillion. $1.8 trillion. Yes. That's right.
00:07:05.464 - 00:07:06.274, Speaker B: That's a lot.
00:07:06.392 - 00:07:07.326, Speaker A: That's a big number.
00:07:07.448 - 00:07:13.362, Speaker B: It's pretty big for are you hearing anybody saying crypto is dead this cycle?
00:07:13.426 - 00:07:15.526, Speaker A: Yeah, Jamie Diamond said it this last week. Yeah.
00:07:15.628 - 00:07:19.126, Speaker B: Okay, well, Jamie Dimon's been consistently wrong in crypto from the beginning of time.
00:07:19.148 - 00:07:19.686, Speaker A: That's right.
00:07:19.788 - 00:07:25.110, Speaker B: There's less of that than there was last time around, I think. I mean, there's fewer people saying crypto is dead.
00:07:25.190 - 00:07:44.430, Speaker A: Right. That was one of the best things that died in the 2020 bear market, was like, no one after crypto, ethereum bitcoin came back from that bear market. That was the last time I heard, like, it could all go to zero. Like, I'm sorry, bitcoin cannot go to zero. That won't happen. Same thing with ether. It's just not going to go to zero.
00:07:44.500 - 00:07:51.934, Speaker B: I mean, a trillion is definitely not dead. It's very much alive. And yet it somehow feels like what did we get to last cycle? 3 trillion.
00:07:52.062 - 00:07:52.846, Speaker A: Almost 4 trillion.
00:07:52.878 - 00:08:05.880, Speaker B: Yeah. No, just above just above three. Just a hair above three. It still feels to me like crypto hasn't had its big one yet. Like its big, big run up. Oh God. What do you think? I mean, if you think of the.com
00:08:05.880 - 00:08:16.666, Speaker B: bubble, for instance, and you kind of measure that in today's dollars that was something like seven to 9 billion excuse me, trillion in terms of the it.
00:08:16.688 - 00:08:22.218, Speaker A: Puts Crypto bubbles to shame. Yeah, it was real big, the stock market.
00:08:22.384 - 00:08:24.838, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't think we're there yet.
00:08:25.024 - 00:08:57.958, Speaker A: My mental model for this, and I'm not going to be able to tell if I'm right on this at all, but just like okay, so we had the 2013 bubble, we had the 2017 bubble, we had the 2021 bubble. To me this is like the Crypto engine, like tumbling over when you have an old car and it's like the cylinders tumble and it doesn't start and it tumbles and it doesn't start. Every single bubble is like a tumble, but these things are getting bigger and also kind of faster, a little bit TBD, but the idea is like we just start to tumble and tumble and then the engine starts to rev and then Crypto takes over the world.
00:08:58.044 - 00:09:06.090, Speaker B: Yeah, well that engine feels like it's revving anytime it's above a trillion, for sure. All right, let's talk about inflation. What is this chart showing us?
00:09:06.160 - 00:09:41.446, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a chart from Hal Press which is just inflation typically goes down as fast as it comes up. So the headline CPI inflation for 1980 peaked at 15% year over year and then it slowed at the same rate that it went up for the next three years back down to 0.2%. I asked Hal for a source on this one and he said it's just like national economic data. So it's like pretty damn verifiable. The take here is that inflation goes down as fast as it goes up, which is while we're still in the early days of data of declining, inflation does seem to track so far.
00:09:41.628 - 00:09:51.674, Speaker B: So basically we went up last summer all the way to 9%. And if we are kind of on the other side of the peak here, then we can expect over the next twelve months to fall back down to.
00:09:51.712 - 00:09:57.242, Speaker A: What is the question? 2%. That's what happened by the end of 2023.
00:09:57.376 - 00:10:01.706, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know. I mean are we ever going back to 2%? Sure question.
00:10:01.808 - 00:10:12.314, Speaker A: Well, it's all relative. So if inflation went down to 2%, it would not mean that prices went back to normal. Like eggs are still going to be high prices.
00:10:12.362 - 00:10:13.806, Speaker B: The rate of increase, the rate of.
00:10:13.828 - 00:10:35.270, Speaker A: Increase is now stable now, which is fine because that is what we need. What we are doing with inflation is resetting the denominator and resetting the debt. So like debt is too large and so we had to keep on inflating and interest rates makes the debt too hard to pay for. And so what did we do? We just cut the value of the dollar in like half and now debts are much more manageable.
00:10:35.690 - 00:10:43.014, Speaker B: I still somewhat wonder if the new normal is going to be above 2%, though. I mean, it's been 2% for the 90s, right?
00:10:43.052 - 00:10:43.254, Speaker A: Sure.
00:10:43.292 - 00:10:46.022, Speaker B: Kind of the existence of most people's adult life.
00:10:46.076 - 00:10:48.482, Speaker A: I think it has to be above 2% because we have too much debt.
00:10:48.546 - 00:10:57.082, Speaker B: I think the new normal will be like, let's talk about earnings in crypto. Crypto revenues.
00:10:57.146 - 00:10:57.486, Speaker A: I love that.
00:10:57.508 - 00:11:13.730, Speaker B: David, we haven't pulled up cryptofees info in a while. That's why I wanted to put it on our weekly agenda. I don't know when the last time you looked at this was, but tell us what we're looking at for somebody on the roll up who hasn't seen us pull up cryptofees info. What are we looking at and what does this tell us?
00:11:13.800 - 00:11:33.658, Speaker A: So there are two things that we're looking at here. There's pink and there's white lines on this list of things that generate fees. Pink are applications like uniswap Ave, GMX, liquidity white, non. Pink are ethereum. Finance March and bitcoin are actually like blockchains. So there's different ways to measure this. The uniswap fees, which are a seven day average of $1.4
00:11:33.658 - 00:11:46.458, Speaker A: million, generated over a seven day average. So that's per day, $1.4 million per day over a seven day average, is the fees charged by the uniswap protocol to traders to go to LPs.
00:11:46.554 - 00:11:47.514, Speaker B: Top line revenue.
00:11:47.562 - 00:11:48.046, Speaker A: Top line revenue.
00:11:48.068 - 00:11:48.922, Speaker B: Top line revenue.
00:11:48.986 - 00:12:08.326, Speaker A: Ethereum and also bitcoin and also Binance smart chain are like, basically gas fees, the fees it takes to transact on the network. Ethereum is making $4 million a day over the last seven days on average. Finance smart chain is the next closest profitable blockchain at half a million dollars a day, followed by bitcoin at $350,000 a day.
00:12:08.428 - 00:12:09.030, Speaker B: Wow.
00:12:09.180 - 00:12:13.350, Speaker A: Yeah, it's not zero.
00:12:13.420 - 00:12:20.498, Speaker B: Well, let's pause here. Okay, so when you say top line revenue for Ethereum, how is it generating this revenue?
00:12:20.594 - 00:12:21.038, Speaker A: Gas fees.
00:12:21.074 - 00:12:21.802, Speaker B: Refresh us on that.
00:12:21.856 - 00:12:23.674, Speaker A: Gas fees. Gas fees, yes.
00:12:23.712 - 00:12:25.014, Speaker B: Okay, so what's it selling?
00:12:25.142 - 00:12:31.658, Speaker A: Block space. Block space. It sells you the space for you to put the data into the block so you can do your thing.
00:12:31.744 - 00:12:41.326, Speaker B: Because, guys, blockchains sell blocks is what they do. That's the thing that they do. And somehow, every single cycle, we seem to forget this.
00:12:41.348 - 00:12:42.062, Speaker A: Forget this.
00:12:42.196 - 00:12:55.762, Speaker B: What is the difference between so, look, Ethereum is about 4 million in sales per day. That's how much block space it's selling per day. Bitcoin, $356,000 worth of block space per day.
00:12:55.816 - 00:12:57.458, Speaker A: It's actually way higher than I thought it'd be.
00:12:57.544 - 00:13:00.966, Speaker B: That's higher than you thought. But look at the delta here. I mean, Ethereum's got like a ten.
00:13:00.988 - 00:13:14.406, Speaker A: X. Yeah, it's over ten x. Yeah. Bitcoin looks that's the smart contract premium. Like, bitcoin is like, all right, I'll send you bitcoins. And then I'll also open up a lightning channel. Ethereum is like, what you want? You want to mint some NFTs, you want to mint some tokens.
00:13:14.406 - 00:13:16.922, Speaker A: You want to take some leverage. Like what you want to do.
00:13:17.056 - 00:13:36.814, Speaker B: Yeah, it's got more to offer. In other words, the utility or the value of its block space is worth more. It's very high. And are there any other layer ones on this? So we talked about B and B, which is that's always been a little bit weird because it's super centralized, but it is producing revenue. And then what do we have coming in at number four? We have an L? Two.
00:13:36.932 - 00:14:02.370, Speaker A: Yeah. Wow. That's the first time I've seen L two S on here. Optimism coming in at $40,000 a day, polygon, $39,000 a day, Arbitrum 128 thousand dollars a day. These numbers are super low, but we also have to remember they don't have to pay for security by in the nature of layer two design. So coming in after Arbitrum, actually, depending on how you measure it, solana made less money than Arbitrum yesterday, but it's made more money over the last seven days.
00:14:02.460 - 00:14:09.786, Speaker B: I've never thought about it this way, but in a like, if you look at a layer two, like optimism, it's kind of like a reseller of Ethereum blockspace, isn't it?
00:14:09.808 - 00:14:10.746, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, that's a yeah, that's a.
00:14:10.768 - 00:14:21.482, Speaker B: Good way to put it because basically it's kind of like it's taking the Ethereum product blockspace, it's making it more valuable, it's adding its value on top of it, and then it's reselling that to all of its consumers.
00:14:21.546 - 00:14:22.394, Speaker A: Arbitrage.
00:14:22.522 - 00:14:30.482, Speaker B: Yeah. That's interesting. Okay, but the next closest layer one, alternative layer one is Salana with 45 million per day.
00:14:30.536 - 00:14:51.722, Speaker A: Yeah. Making over the last no, 45,000 per day. Yeah. Making less money in the last 24 hours. Less than optimism, less than Arbitrum, less than polygon. Yet it also has to pay for security. So the other website that we also go to is Moneyprinters Info, I think, and you'll just see the absolute rate of inflation on a lot of these.
00:14:51.722 - 00:15:05.910, Speaker A: We could do monolithic layer ones. We will hammer this into your head. Blockchains sell blocks. They also collect revenue. If they issue more currency than they collect in revenue, they are inflating. And that's bad. And for sustainability.
00:15:06.070 - 00:15:26.270, Speaker B: Yeah. That's why it's like here's the thing. Someone in the I think it was YouTube chat the other day when we were doing a live stream, was like, why don't you guys talk about why are you guys talking about these other alternative layer ones acting as if they should be valued far less than Ethereum? I'm like, because of this, go to this site, discrepancy. Their revenue is down. They are not selling their blocks. Their product is less valuable than even layer twos.
00:15:26.350 - 00:15:34.790, Speaker A: By definition. Their product is to not charge fees, which makes them fundamentally unsustainable over the long term. Like the product, the structure is broken.
00:15:35.130 - 00:15:39.942, Speaker B: Anyone can sell a product where you're losing money. I don't understand why this isn't more widely.
00:15:40.006 - 00:15:41.894, Speaker A: I don't know. I don't know, dude.
00:15:41.942 - 00:15:42.506, Speaker B: Okay. All right.
00:15:42.528 - 00:15:50.022, Speaker A: Well, we're just dumb East Maxis who don't understand just economics. Just basic economics.
00:15:50.166 - 00:15:54.042, Speaker B: Just science. What's going on with the price of Aptos?
00:15:54.106 - 00:15:55.726, Speaker A: That's a really good question.
00:15:55.828 - 00:15:57.018, Speaker B: Well, do you have any answers?
00:15:57.034 - 00:16:03.310, Speaker A: Did you know the fully diluted valuation of Aptos right now is at $16 billion?
00:16:03.460 - 00:16:13.390, Speaker B: I did know that, David. Did you further know the fully diluted valuation of Coinbase? Remember that exchange? That little exchange is 12 billion Aptos.
00:16:13.470 - 00:16:19.590, Speaker A: Oh, my God. It was $16 billion when I looked at it yesterday at 18 and $.6 billion.
00:16:19.660 - 00:16:20.578, Speaker B: Look at this chart.
00:16:20.674 - 00:16:32.650, Speaker A: Coinbase. The exchange from 2011, or whenever it got started, is at $12 billion. Who the hell is buying this? I think the inflows are actually coming from Korea for this is a six.
00:16:32.720 - 00:16:36.234, Speaker B: X from January Eigth Real.
00:16:36.352 - 00:16:40.270, Speaker A: It is an empty blockchain. There's nothing going on there.
00:16:40.340 - 00:16:50.160, Speaker B: There's some stats here for you, David. The TVL total locked value vanity metric short for Aptos is $58 million.
00:16:50.770 - 00:16:52.650, Speaker A: $58 million.
00:16:52.740 - 00:17:25.894, Speaker B: That's with an M. That's less than most DFI apps. On Ethereum, the valuation is 18 billion. The total locked value on Ethereum is 32 billion. That's with a B. The valuation of Ethereum is 196. If you do that math of total locked value divided by fully diluted valuation, which you can do, that means Aptos is 53 x more in terms of its value in the market than Ethereum.
00:17:25.894 - 00:17:30.250, Speaker B: It seems like quite a hefty premium. I'm having trouble understanding why.
00:17:30.320 - 00:17:42.160, Speaker A: Yeah. I'm not one to be so foolish to short anything in crypto, because why would you ever short something where there are just apes involved? Man? Is that really an enticing short?
00:17:42.770 - 00:17:43.806, Speaker B: You're going to do it?
00:17:43.908 - 00:17:49.994, Speaker A: No, I don't even know how. Because if it was a token on Ethereum, it'd be easy. I don't know. I would have to go do it in some centralized exchange.
00:17:50.042 - 00:17:51.454, Speaker B: But would you do it if you could?
00:17:51.572 - 00:17:56.102, Speaker A: If it was trivial for me, yeah. I'd probably throw some pocket change at an APTO short just for fun.
00:17:56.156 - 00:18:01.766, Speaker B: Just to say just to say I did it. Yeah. I just never short things, because it.
00:18:01.788 - 00:18:06.902, Speaker A: Doesn'T matter if it's the most obvious short in crypto history, because apes will liquidate you.
00:18:06.956 - 00:18:16.810, Speaker B: Have you ever seen people do, like, these angry shorts? They're like the market's wrong. APTO shouldn't be this high, and they just angry short it and they're just money.
00:18:16.960 - 00:18:19.754, Speaker A: But it doesn't matter because the volatility still liquidates them.
00:18:19.792 - 00:18:30.990, Speaker B: They might be right, like, two or three years later. Anyway, dYdX is also rallying. The reason why is because they postponed an unlock of tokens. That's basically it.
00:18:31.140 - 00:18:33.082, Speaker A: That's the dumbest reason to rally.
00:18:33.146 - 00:18:35.760, Speaker B: Tokens is pretty dumb reason.
00:18:36.530 - 00:18:39.858, Speaker A: Do we know that this is true? Because sometimes people just like to ascribe things.
00:18:39.944 - 00:19:01.994, Speaker B: Sure, it does seem like it's true, because the news came out where they were like, don Lock will now begin December 1 rather than some other date. Anyway, when that happened, then the price rose. All right, what we're trading right now cool an unlock. We could just kick that can down the road. But optimism is up, too.
00:19:02.032 - 00:19:22.974, Speaker A: Do you want to optimism is at all time highs. Op token. I'm sure if Arbitrum had a token, it would probably also be I'm assuming these things will trade in parallel with each other. Optimism coming in at almost a $10 billion network, which is pretty damn crazy. It's hard to value these things because optimism is still so what am I looking at here?
00:19:23.012 - 00:19:26.198, Speaker B: This is coin gecko. This is not fully diluted valuation.
00:19:26.314 - 00:19:38.758, Speaker A: That's market cap valuation. Yeah. So market cap is the discrepancy between the supply of not much supply on the market, not much supply in the market. But that's just a function of how they're just slowly airdropping out their token, slowly releasing it.
00:19:38.764 - 00:19:38.886, Speaker B: Right.
00:19:38.908 - 00:19:59.258, Speaker A: So there's a lot of locked tokens. Market cap is something like half a billion, but fully diluted valuation is at 10 billion. So it's actually technically not unlike Aptos in that there's a very small float and a very high fully diluted valuation. But when you buy these things, you need to look at the fully diluted valuation, because that is the valuation that you are buying these things at.
00:19:59.344 - 00:20:01.578, Speaker B: If you're a long term holder, at.
00:20:01.584 - 00:20:31.750, Speaker A: Least you're a long term, but but at least there's real, actual innovation and activity. Like Velodrome on optimism is hitting volume all time highs. So there's actually, like, justifiable of it's, like, in a much more advanced bit. It's kind of a hybrid between Curve and Uniswap a little bit. But for any token, like, Curve specializes in, like to like assets. Webellidrome is a little bit like uniswap, where it's not like A to B. Assets assets aren't supposed to be priced on parity.
00:20:31.750 - 00:20:41.334, Speaker A: We did an episode with them a few months ago, and then after we did the episode, the price absolutely mooned. I'm like, why didn't I buy it? Yeah.
00:20:41.372 - 00:20:41.846, Speaker B: Why didn't you?
00:20:41.868 - 00:20:42.610, Speaker A: David?
00:20:42.770 - 00:20:44.346, Speaker B: Because it's tradition, that's why.
00:20:44.448 - 00:20:54.078, Speaker A: Yes, it's tradition. The number of times I've done a show on something, I was, hmm, that's kind of bullish. And then I don't buy it, and then the show goes out and then token prices goes up. That's happened a handful of times.
00:20:54.244 - 00:21:05.314, Speaker B: Definitely. It would be. By the way, guys, in case you're listening, if there was a purchase of anything that David made prior to doing a show, that would be listed in the disclosures on our website and also.
00:21:05.352 - 00:21:06.450, Speaker A: Mentioned in the show.
00:21:06.520 - 00:21:16.420, Speaker B: And also mentioned at the beginning of the show. So even if David tried to fake pump and dump us, he actually couldn't because we have that in place.
00:21:16.790 - 00:21:20.162, Speaker A: Also. That's not what I'm interested in doing. I don't need to do that.
00:21:20.216 - 00:21:24.514, Speaker B: You don't want to pump and dump. You just want to hold for the long term and be boring. How boring?
00:21:24.562 - 00:21:24.966, Speaker A: Exactly?
00:21:25.068 - 00:21:27.574, Speaker B: All right, what's coming up next? We got some non boring stuff.
00:21:27.692 - 00:21:42.986, Speaker A: Got some non boring stuff. Yeah. So Genesis filing for Chapter Eleven. So that is finally wrapping up. We'll talk about that SEC coming in a hot. Ali Iceberg, the Mango market manipulator got charged by the SEC. Gary Wang and Caroline Ellison.
00:21:42.986 - 00:21:54.526, Speaker A: Charged by the SEC. Nexo. Charged by the SEC. Lots of things to talk about. And then hester purse of the SEC comes and delivers a fantastic speech which Ryan and I just absolutely gushed over.
00:21:54.548 - 00:21:55.582, Speaker B: We'll talk about that.
00:21:55.716 - 00:22:18.838, Speaker A: And then also a bunch of NFTs migrating uniswap migrating to Binance. Everyone on the move, lots to talk about. Oh, and we'll also talk about how to make sure that you don't get your NFTs fished. All that and so much more. It's going to be a big roll up after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make this episode possible, especially Kraken, who is our strategic sponsor of 2023. Cheers.

How many total Airdrops have you gotten? This last bull market had a ton of them. Did you get them all? Maybe you missed one. So here's what you should do. Go to Earnify and plug in your Ethereum wallet. And Earnify will tell you if you have any unclaimed airdrops that you can get.
00:23:28.654 - 00:24:03.782, Speaker A: And it also does poaps and mintable NFTs any kind of money that your wallet can claim. Earnify will tell you about it. And you should probably do it now because some airdrops expire. And if you sign up for Earnify, they'll email you anytime one of your wallets has a new AirDrop for it to make sure that you never lose an AirDrop ever again. You can also upgrade to Earnify premium to unlock access to Airdrops that are beyond the basics and are able to set reminders for more wallets. And for just under $21 a month, it probably pays for itself with just one AirDrop. So plug in your wallets at Earnify and see what you get that's earnifi and make sure you never lose another AirDrop.
00:24:03.846 - 00:24:17.790, Speaker B: We said it would happen last week, and now it happened. Genesis filing for Chapter Eleven. Here's the story. Genesis owes more than 3.6 billion to top 50 creditors. The papers were released. We got some more data on this.
00:24:17.790 - 00:24:20.366, Speaker B: David, fill us in. What's happening with Genesis? Yeah.
00:24:20.388 - 00:24:40.802, Speaker A: Genesis Global files for bankruptcy protection and the US. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. In the filing, the company published a list of its top 50 unsecured claims. So if you are curious of that, it's a whopping $3.6 billion to just its top 50 creditors. $3.6 billion it's owed.
00:24:40.866 - 00:24:42.066, Speaker B: Are you on that list anywhere, David?
00:24:42.098 - 00:24:43.494, Speaker A: No, I am not. Okay.
00:24:43.612 - 00:24:45.634, Speaker B: I think I am by proxy.
00:24:45.682 - 00:25:08.906, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I think you are joined by many people who are owed that, because, again, it just turns out yield is just this gravitational black hole. And so all the yield that was created in the last two years ended up flowing back into Genesis. It was the keystone of contagion. So the list of creditors going to be large. $3.6 billion is owed does not say how much. They have assets under management.
00:25:08.906 - 00:25:21.746, Speaker A: That is not a $3.6 whole. That is a $3.6 amount owed. They have some amount of money, and they're on their balance sheet that they do have. So it's not the whole size.
00:25:21.928 - 00:25:25.650, Speaker B: Where's some of the big ones? Mirana Corp. 151,000,000.
00:25:25.720 - 00:25:26.882, Speaker A: Don't know what that is.
00:25:27.016 - 00:25:30.786, Speaker B: Babel Finance. I've heard of them. 150,000,000. Van Eck. You know Van Eck?
00:25:30.818 - 00:25:34.006, Speaker A: Yeah. I went to their big institutional players. I went to their Taco not too long ago.
00:25:34.108 - 00:25:51.034, Speaker B: Well, they're out of lock. $53 million. It's a whole big list here, and a lot of people affected by this. Genesis is literally at the the of end end of the row here. But okay, so Genesis goes bankrupt, but not DCG. Interestingly. Which is kind of the parent company of all of this.
00:25:51.072 - 00:26:09.246, Speaker A: Yes. So DCG is letting Genesis go into bankruptcy without coming to save it because the hole is probably too big for that to be saved for them to want to do that. That's also why they are selling CoinDesk. Did you hear? They're selling CoinDesk because they need to raise capital.
00:26:09.278 - 00:26:13.410, Speaker B: And, like, apparently, I heard, like, prices on Twitter of like, 25 to 30 million.
00:26:13.480 - 00:26:27.014, Speaker A: I would like to that be really corroborated. I think that's just a rumor. But the price, the speculation on Twitter was like, the prices that are being offered for CoinDesk is $25 to $50 million, which is extremely low.
00:26:27.212 - 00:26:30.518, Speaker B: I think that's low, but who knows how much it's hemorrhaging, right?
00:26:30.684 - 00:26:32.154, Speaker A: I know CoinDesk has a ton of.
00:26:32.192 - 00:26:34.246, Speaker B: Employees not be profitable.
00:26:34.278 - 00:26:35.866, Speaker A: Yeah, well, turns out we all thought.
00:26:35.888 - 00:26:38.566, Speaker B: The block I thought everyone was like, oh, the block.
00:26:38.598 - 00:26:41.978, Speaker A: Great company. Turns out they're not profitable. Yeah.
00:26:42.144 - 00:27:00.834, Speaker B: Anyway, imagine having a profitable media company. All right. Will earn get. Their money, their users money back? That's the big question. And I know Cameron Winklevoss and the Winklevoss twins have been all up in this. This is Cameron Winklevoss with an update on Earn. This is the big question.
00:27:00.834 - 00:27:11.814, Speaker B: Means like $900 million, almost a billion dollars of retail funds in Gemini Earn. Will investors, I guess investors, will people get their money back?
00:27:11.852 - 00:27:56.914, Speaker A: David so TBD, so quote from Cameron Winklevoss is that Genesis bankruptcy does not insulate Barry, DCG or any other wrongdoers from accountability, said Cameron Winklevoss. Gemini is preparing to take legal action against Barry, DCG and others for the fraud. So the idea here is that they are saying that fraudulent activity happened. It's outside of Genesis. It's Barry and all of DCG. And so even if Genesis can't make Gemini Earn customers whole, we are going to sue DCG and Barry Silbert for fraud to get the rest of the money back. So the Winklevoss twins continue to be coming in very hot with accusations of fraud and we will only be able to tell what the truth is after everyone has their day in court.
00:27:56.914 - 00:27:59.640, Speaker A: But Gemini twins coming in very hot.
00:28:00.250 - 00:28:35.438, Speaker B: This is interesting. I just ran the math here. So $900 million divided by 340,000 earned users, according to Cameron Winklevoss, is about an average of 2600 per user. These are smaller retail types of accounts and that could be somebody's savings, their crypto savings, hopefully not their life savings. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose and certainly don't lend it out to a crypto lender. Gemini laid off 10% of staff amid troubles, which, by the way, is not a lot.
00:28:35.524 - 00:28:48.958, Speaker A: It's not crazy compared to like, cracked. It's their third round of layoffs in the last eight months, but like 10% is relatively normal, especially when other web two companies are laying off similar yeah, totally.
00:28:49.054 - 00:28:59.146, Speaker B: Google just did a massive layout. Coinbase has done layouts. All right, well, we're going to continue to talk about this as it comes up, but we got more. The SEC banhammer. What are they doing?
00:28:59.248 - 00:30:02.214, Speaker A: SEC charges Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang with defrauding investors in FTX. Absolutely no surprise there. In the press release it's charged that Caroline Ellison manipulated the price of FTT by purchasing large quantities on the open market to prop up the price again, which was the collateral that much of Alameda and FTX used to borrow with overstated. The value of the collateral on the balance sheet led to all of this explosion at FTX and over a crazy amount of risk exposure. The complaint stated that Wang created the FTX's backing door, allowing Alameda to divert FTX customers'funds and Ellison used misappropriate FTX customer funds for Alameda's trading strategy. I think as these people go through the process of being in court, we're going to find out how much did SBF actually know? Because he claims that he had no idea that Gary Wang had the backdoor between Alameda and FTX. How could he have known that his exchange and his prop trading desk having a backdoor with each other, how could he have known?
00:30:02.342 - 00:30:09.950, Speaker B: Yeah, I just impossible to know, really. You got to feel for the guy. Caroline Ellison was the former CEO of Alameda, right?
00:30:10.020 - 00:30:10.254, Speaker A: Yes.
00:30:10.292 - 00:30:13.082, Speaker B: And then Gary Wang was the CTO of FTX.
00:30:13.146 - 00:30:13.470, Speaker A: Correct.
00:30:13.540 - 00:30:19.474, Speaker B: Basically operating as the same very incestuous. Yes. All right, so that's hit number one from the SEC. What about number two?
00:30:19.512 - 00:30:54.246, Speaker A: Ali Ellsberg, the guy that manipulated the Mango markets on Solana and then took that money over to Ave to try and do a short squeeze on Curve or something. But then he got liquidated, blah, blah, blah, blah. I think the Acftc is going after him, too. But the SEC charged Avi with market manipulation, which is what he definitely did. Ellsberg Eisenberg is in federal prison awaiting transport to New York City. And the SEC labeled Mango Token as a governance token offered sold as a security on the crypto platform Mango Markets. So this is perhaps setting a precedent.
00:30:54.278 - 00:30:59.786, Speaker B: What is the mango? You said Mango markets. What are we talking about? I think it's like an Avi salana DFI.
00:30:59.818 - 00:31:02.794, Speaker A: It's a salana DFI thing? Yes. I think it's like a borrowing lending protocol.
00:31:02.842 - 00:31:10.626, Speaker B: What's funny to me is the headline is this guy apparently stole 116,000,000 of crypto assets. I'm like, oh, that's not that much.
00:31:10.728 - 00:31:13.026, Speaker A: Holy crap, it's 116,000,000.
00:31:13.208 - 00:31:17.714, Speaker B: What has happened to me? Yeah, I'm like measuring things in the billions for the fraud.
00:31:17.762 - 00:31:26.662, Speaker A: Well, he was the guy that tweeted out. We just engaged in an extremely profitable trading strategy. And everyone was like, Bro, you stole that money.
00:31:26.716 - 00:31:31.926, Speaker B: It's called aesthetic. It's called market manipulation and theft. And he tweets about it.
00:31:31.948 - 00:31:32.418, Speaker A: Tweets it?
00:31:32.444 - 00:31:33.340, Speaker B: Well, he has.
00:31:33.870 - 00:31:38.214, Speaker A: He did it out in the open. It's like it was a very profitable trading strategy. Yeah, like market manipulation is profitable.
00:31:38.262 - 00:31:59.698, Speaker B: Do you know, like when YouTube influencers and stuff and TikTok influencers will literally film the crimes that they're doing and post it for clout? This is what this guy was doing, advertising his big wins, and it was in the form of market manipulation. So that's number two. Yeah, same thing. How about they hit someone else? Nexo. Nexo $45 million.
00:31:59.784 - 00:32:38.570, Speaker A: SEC charged Nexo for failing to register the offer and sale of its crypto asset lending product, its interest product. Nexo has agreed to pay the SEC $45 million and have ceased the sale of the earned product to US investors. This is why Nexo said that they were leaving the US market last December, citing a dead end in talks with US regulators, which is kind of on par with conversations we've already had. SEC charged Gemini Earn and Genesis last week for the same thing. Also told Coinbase it would sue them if they released Coinbase's Earn product as well. And so this is kind of far in line with all the other things that the SEC is doing to david.
00:32:38.730 - 00:33:38.398, Speaker B: I feel like lots of times Bankless has a lot of scolding for the SEC. We're like, what are you guys doing? Stop doing what are you doing? Can we be mad about some of these actions? I mean, the SEC taking on a market manipulator for the Mango token, the SEC taking on the FTX executives and doing that. I don't know about nexa, but even though she's those two isn't the thing we want the SEC to do is come after the clear scammers and grifters like the BitConnect guy from 2017. Isn't that where crypto is? Basically, hey, we could use some help in these areas. So I almost feel like I want to praise them for this or say, thank you, I can get on with these things. And yet, David, I'm like, I'm worried to say that because I don't know what the lines of Demarcation actually, and it's kind of like, oh, you give them an inch and they'll take a mile. Sort of just I don't know how to really address this or how to talk about it.
00:33:38.398 - 00:33:41.442, Speaker B: I don't know if you have any takes on that, but yeah. What do you think?
00:33:41.496 - 00:34:14.446, Speaker A: My take has been what it's always been, which is if it can be regulated, then it ought to be regulated. If there is a central loki of power that the SEC has the ability to apply pressure to, and that works. That means that that thing that they're applying pressure to is sufficiently centralized to the point where there is a discrepancy between public market information and private actors. That means there is a principal agent problem. And so it's a little bit kind of judging after the fact. Like if the SEC can apply pressure, then they ought to. But that's just what the nature of decentralization is.
00:34:14.468 - 00:34:22.814, Speaker B: If they I agree with that line. Right. I agree with that. Like so I think you almost have to get even more detailed there.
00:34:22.852 - 00:34:23.198, Speaker A: Sure.
00:34:23.284 - 00:34:43.426, Speaker B: Because that's a guiding principle. But how do we know? Yeah, ether scan can be regulated. It is a centralized company could be regulated as a broker dealer or like infura, for instance, are we going to make remember that was actual legislation material from SBF. We should regulate all of the DeFi front ends.
00:34:43.458 - 00:34:46.280, Speaker A: Do you remember this? I understand that, yeah. That's a good point.
00:34:46.650 - 00:35:18.238, Speaker B: So how do we do this? I guess one of my takeaways last week was like a breath of fresh air. Hester Purse, who is a Commissioner of the SEC, gave a speech at a digital assets conference at University of Duke. And this is just exactly like, I don't know how to articulate it the way hester does, but the way hester articulates the role of the SEC with respect to regulation. Crypto is exactly it's so good. What we want we should read quotes.
00:35:18.254 - 00:35:25.540, Speaker A: From this fresh reminder of how things ought to be done by the nature of why they were created. In the first place.
00:35:26.630 - 00:35:41.610, Speaker B: Here's a quote. Hester says crypto's value proposition depends primarily on the builders of this technology, not on the regulators like me who lack technical expertise and stand on the periphery looking in. What a great posture to the space.
00:35:41.680 - 00:35:43.434, Speaker A: Some of these lines are so great.
00:35:43.552 - 00:35:44.506, Speaker B: What else you got?
00:35:44.608 - 00:36:23.606, Speaker A: My favorite line here was privately designed and voluntarily implemented solutions can be both more effective and more tailored because the people driving them better understand the technology and what they are trying to achieve with it. Iterating and experimenting with private solutions is easier than it is with regulatory ones. Moreover, private solutions avoid the systemic risk that comes from an industry homogenizing because everyone has to fit into the same regulatory parameters. Like mic drop. Oh my God, it's such a powerful line. It's so good. It's just also the principles of just like frontier innovation always happens when you let the free market do its best.
00:36:23.606 - 00:36:39.850, Speaker A: And this is what I've seen, not necessarily the SEC at large, but Gary Gensler really getting in the way of is just like really pushing back the freedom of the frontier to explore and innovate like, yes, we find trouble on the frontier and then we route around it. And you're not going to do that, Gary.
00:36:40.590 - 00:37:01.794, Speaker B: She also says this regulatory solutions which tend to be inflexible should be a last resort, not a first resort. I also appreciated, David, how this speech was also directed to people in crypto. Said this to us, to the bankless audience. I think people who believe in crypto's future should not wait for regulators to fix the problems.
00:37:01.912 - 00:37:02.578, Speaker A: Right.
00:37:02.744 - 00:37:39.150, Speaker B: Regulatory solutions which tend to be inflexible should be a last resort, not a first resort. I said that already. Privately designed and voluntarily implemented solutions are much better at fixing things than regulators using their inherently coercive power to impose mandatory solutions. She says later, crypto is about solving a trust problem. How can you interact and transact safely with people you do not know? That is the core of it. Anyway, this whole speech is fantastic and I just like the posture of a regulator really taking the time to understand our industry. What's up? If you go to the footnotes david, look at these footnotes here.
00:37:39.220 - 00:37:42.842, Speaker A: Okay, bring out sorry, go ahead.
00:37:42.916 - 00:37:44.158, Speaker B: Multiple bankless podcasts.
00:37:44.174 - 00:37:49.182, Speaker A: Oh yeah, right. Yeah. Three bankless podcasts. What's up? Hester shout out, thanks for listening.
00:37:49.326 - 00:37:54.238, Speaker B: Taylor Monahan YouTube video on the Brink episode.
00:37:54.334 - 00:37:58.260, Speaker A: Yeah. She listens to John Green podcast. We do that's great.
00:37:58.810 - 00:38:23.242, Speaker B: This is what we've asked the SEC and our regulators to do is like we don't bite engage with the crypto community. We want the scammers out. Like, we want your help to do that. So can you take some time to understand to talk to us? Anyway, this speech made us once again so excited and so bullish. We reached out to Hester Purse's office and asked if she'd want to come to the show and I think that's in progress.
00:38:23.306 - 00:38:48.020, Speaker A: Right? She said, I'd absolutely love to. So Hesser purse round two people don't know that the crypto industry have warmly dubbed hester purse crypto mom way back when for offering the stances that she's been put forth in here. Also, you know, she's a regular listener because she cited our Is everything a Security episode with Brian Fry. So, you know she's paying.
00:38:48.390 - 00:38:52.886, Speaker B: Yeah. She actually mentioned the fifth prong of the Howie test in the speech. Did you read that?
00:38:52.908 - 00:38:53.974, Speaker A: Oh, no, I missed that part.
00:38:54.012 - 00:39:01.114, Speaker B: Yeah, she did. She said, yeah. Fifth prong of the Howie test, some people have observed is, does the SEC want to regulate this?
00:39:01.152 - 00:39:06.060, Speaker A: Right? Which is like, exactly from Brian, the only prong of the Howie test.
00:39:06.990 - 00:39:39.730, Speaker B: Anyway, I'm just begless listeners know, we give regulators a hard time sometimes, and I think a lot of that's justified, but we want to call out when they're right and when they're trying to do the right thing. And let's keep in mind, regulators are just people. They're citizens. This is a layer zero type of thing. And when they're fulfilling their mandate for the people, then I think that's a much healthier place to be. So just hats off to this particular regulator doing this work, and we hope more of them step up and do this. And SEC, CFTC, all the government agencies in every jurisdiction around the world.
00:39:39.880 - 00:40:01.820, Speaker A: And just to really drive this point home, the reason why we spent time to talk about this is like we talked about, okay. The SEC charged Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang with defrauding investors in FTX. Yeah, that's good. Charging Ellisberg with market manipulation, like yep, that's good. Nexo for failing to register, like, facts and circumstances. It's a black box. We don't really know.
00:40:01.820 - 00:40:19.378, Speaker A: But the point is, the SEC hester in this article said, hey, crypto is not a monolith. We need to judge crypto individually by facts and circumstances. And I think that's how we should approach the SEC facts and circumstances for every single decision they make. And that is what we are trying to do here.
00:40:19.464 - 00:40:40.790, Speaker B: That's right, David. Kevin Rose had a real bad day earlier this week. Here's the headline. Kevin Rose's NFT wallet with 40 high value collectibles was hacked. This was a Phishing Scam, David, that drained millions of dollars worth of rare tokens, a lot of very valuable NFTs on this list. What did Kevin lootes in this hack?
00:40:40.870 - 00:40:59.806, Speaker A: Yeah, so 40 NFTs, like you said, one autoglyph, which hurts my soul. Autoglyphs are such a treasure. There's not that many of them. 25 chromy squiggles, which is the first one. That's a chromy squiggle. Yeah, 25 of them, which is the first art block ever created. One QQL Mint pass, which I don't know what that is.
00:40:59.806 - 00:41:17.106, Speaker A: One admit. One pass from G Money. I've got one of those. A cool cat NFT the currency NFT by Damien Hearst Quantum key. Several on chain monkeys. But it was nice to see that he owned a zombie crypto punk. Extremely rare, extremely valuable, and that one was saved.
00:41:17.106 - 00:41:45.046, Speaker A: But all the other ones were sadly lost to a phishing scam. The way that this worked is fraudulent website. He proved a transaction. That transaction bundled up all the NFTs that it was preparing to bundle up and then sent them outbound from Kevin Rose's wallet all in one go. So quite unfortunate. Sorry, Kevin, that is terrible news. And this is just part of the early days of crypto where we still need to work out some of these kinks.
00:41:45.046 - 00:41:48.202, Speaker A: This is a problem that only we as an industry can solve.
00:41:48.266 - 00:42:15.430, Speaker B: Do you know that line we say at the end of every show, which is you could lose everything. Basically, this sort of thing can happen. This was a phishing attempt that got Kevin. This was my take on it, David. Shortly after it happened, I said, it looks like Kevin Rose just had millions of dollars in assets stolen because he clicked the wrong transaction. And how brutal is that? You just clicked the wrong transaction. Imagine if swiping your credit card at the coffee shop put you at risk for getting your entire bank account drained.
00:42:15.430 - 00:42:48.382, Speaker B: I think, David, this is really bad. UX, honestly, it's something that crypto has to fix before it goes mainstream. Some people say there's ways Kevin could have protected himself for this. 100% agree. Yet if he was a bit more careful, and yet he's a seasoned veteran, he's probably kicking himself now. But this could happen to anybody we know in crypto. Like a simple mistake of I am signing a transaction that I think is legit from a wallet where I have a lot of different tokens or assets.
00:42:48.382 - 00:42:56.530, Speaker B: This type of thing can happen. So how do we solve this? Do you agree with me that this is up to the crypto industry to solve it? Like, it's a big UX problem.
00:42:56.680 - 00:43:36.734, Speaker A: There are things that you can do today to make sure that you never fall victim to this. And it's just a matter of taking the extra time and energy to do the thing. DC put out this wallet best practice, which I thought was very valuable. And also it's really the first two points that I think everyone can do. If you are engaging with a wallet that has a ton of value in it, you should consider that when you do something, the rest of the things in your wallet might be at risk. And so what DC investor is advocating for, and which is a great system, is that people in the NFT world do this quite frequently. You can see people's vault address and their name on OpenSea have a vault address.
00:43:36.734 - 00:43:44.290, Speaker A: And what that means is you put all of your high value NFTs into that vault address, you send it from your hot wallet to your vault address.
00:43:44.440 - 00:43:45.390, Speaker B: Like cold storage.
00:43:45.470 - 00:44:23.294, Speaker A: Cold storage, yes. You never ever approve any NFT for sale from the vault address. If you would like to sell that NFT, you send that NFT away from the vault address to a wallet that doesn't have much money in it, and then you approve it for sale from that wallet. And what this does is that it only approves things to be sold from that hot wallet. So if you ever want to sell something on OpenSea or any other NFT marketplace, you have to give a smart contract approval to access that specific NFT set. This is how Kevin got fished. He said, I'll sell this NFT, I approve what he actually was doing.
00:44:23.332 - 00:44:24.426, Speaker B: Not on OpenSea right?
00:44:24.468 - 00:44:26.674, Speaker A: Not some other phishing website. Right.
00:44:26.712 - 00:44:31.618, Speaker B: It's probably somebody was like, hey Kevin, here's something for free. It could have been something like this.
00:44:31.704 - 00:45:05.454, Speaker A: And so he approved in bulk all NFT outbound transfers from that wallet. And then that smart contract did that. So what you do is that you only transfer one NFT into your wallet that you plan on selling, and then you just sell that one NFT. And then once you're done, you send the NFT back into the vault wallet. So the vault wallet never ever approves any smart contract, ever permissions to move your NFT. And so one is literally Fort Knox. And then this hot wallet is the one that you can collect all of your smart contract STDs is kind of what some people call them.
00:45:05.652 - 00:45:06.602, Speaker B: STDs?
00:45:06.666 - 00:45:30.022, Speaker A: Yeah. Have you ever gone to delegate cash? For example, this website, it'll show you sometimes you load up your wallet and like, I've allowed all of these smart contracts to access my money. Most of the time smart contracts are safe because they're not owned by anyone. But if you approve a smart contract to access your money, and that smart contract is controlled by someone, they can remove all your money.
00:45:30.076 - 00:45:34.726, Speaker B: All right, well, let's double click on this. What is delegate cache? Should people go do this right now?
00:45:34.828 - 00:45:52.362, Speaker A: Delegate cache is a way to delegate a specific authority to have some sort of access to a hot wallet. There's also revoke. Try revoke cache. I think that's the one I was talking about. Yeah. And that can show you all the permissions that you've enabled for a specific wallet. And then you can unrevoke those.
00:45:52.416 - 00:46:17.342, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely some things that you need to do. As an early crypto native, we're settlers on the frontier here, right? We're basically beta testing all of these things for the rest of the world. And so we get the upside from that. We also get the pain when this sort of thing happens. So you need to protect yourself. It really is the Wild West right now, and I think DC has some valuable ways to fix this. Also, though, David, back to kind of the point, it's still really bad UX.
00:46:17.406 - 00:46:22.450, Speaker A: It's bad UX, right? Contract wallets. You need smart contract wallets. Need smart contract wallets.
00:46:22.530 - 00:46:28.214, Speaker B: And I do think that this will be solved over time, but we're not ready yet. All right, David, what do we got coming up next?
00:46:28.332 - 00:46:56.190, Speaker A: Coming up next for the rest of the weekly roll up when withdrawals? When withdrawals? Ryan, I would like to withdraw my Ether Psych. No, I wouldn't. I'm staking forever. But other people might. Wormhole Hacker is now the fifth biggest owner of staked Ether, and Ethereum NFTs are going multi chain as well as Uniswap is going on to binance crazy. All of this and more as soon as we get to some of these fantastic sponsors that make this episode possible. Uniswap is the largest on chain marketplace for self custody digital assets.
00:46:56.190 - 00:47:43.614, Speaker A: Uniswap is, of course, a decentralized exchange, but you know this because you've been listening to Bankless. But did you know that the Uniswap web app has a shiny new Fiat onram? Now, you could go directly from Fiat in your bank to tokens in DFI inside of Uniswap. Not only that, but Polygon, Arbitrum and optimism layer two, S, are supported right out of the gate, but that's just DFI. Uniswap is also an NFT aggregator, letting you find more listings for the best prices across the NFT world. With Uniswap, you can sweep floors on multiple NFTs and Uniswap's universal router will optimize your gas fees for you. Uniswap is making it as easy as possible to go from bank account to bankless assets across Ethereum, and we couldn't be more thankful for having them as a sponsor. So go to app Uniswap.org
00:47:43.614 - 00:48:28.718, Speaker A: today to buy, sell or swap tokens and NFTs. Arbitrum One is pioneering the world of secure Ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the Web Three landscape. Hundreds of projects have already deployed on Arbitrum One, producing flourishing DFI and NFT ecosystems. With a recent addition of Arbitrum, nova gaming and social DApps like Reddit are also now calling Arbitrum home. Both Arbitrum One and Nova leverage the security and decentralization of Ethereum and provide a builder experience that's intuitive, familiar and fully EVM compatible. On Arbitrum, both builders and users will experience faster transaction speeds with significantly lower gas fees. With Arbitrum's recent migration to Arbitrum Nitro, it's also now ten times faster than before.
00:48:28.718 - 00:48:41.970, Speaker A: Visit Arbitrum IO, where you can join the community, dive into the developer docs, bridge your assets and start building your first DAP with Arbitrum experience web Three development the way it was meant to be secure, fast, cheap and friction free.
00:48:42.040 - 00:48:48.282, Speaker B: All right, david, when withdrawals? When are people going to be able to withdraw their ETH from the beacon chain?
00:48:48.446 - 00:49:20.142, Speaker A: Still don't know, but we are one step closer. A Maynet shadow fork are in full dress rehearsal for system upgrades, which has allowed developers to test for flaws of the withdrawal contract. And so we have done a successful shadow fork of the withdrawals contract for Shanghai. And so this is like one of the last big things that we needed to get done in order to actually do withdrawals on mainnet. So this means that we are still on track for a march, perhaps delivery of the Shanghai hard fork. That is not official. Do not quote me.
00:49:20.142 - 00:49:21.598, Speaker A: But we're looking good.
00:49:21.684 - 00:49:33.394, Speaker B: David said march. You can quote me quoting David. Quoting David. Uniswap poll just shows 80% support for going to Finance BNB chain. That is what is this?
00:49:33.512 - 00:49:55.318, Speaker A: I can't wait for the headline to come out. I was like, Uniswap. Abandons ethereum. We're getting a Unix swap on finance. So finance is not a layer two on Ethereum, but it is a EVM clone, an EVM fork, which means it's relatively trivial to deploy a uniswap V three there. Since Binance actually has real adoption. Uniswap is like, Yo, let's go to finance.
00:49:55.318 - 00:50:01.078, Speaker A: And so 20 million unitoken holders voted yes. 6500 unitoken.
00:50:01.254 - 00:50:02.218, Speaker B: So they're doing it.
00:50:02.304 - 00:50:04.346, Speaker A: Yeah. Voted no. And so they're doing it.
00:50:04.528 - 00:50:06.854, Speaker B: Do you care about this as well? Right.
00:50:06.912 - 00:50:12.638, Speaker A: It's not bearish for uni token. I think the only thing that's really relevant is for the uni token here.
00:50:12.724 - 00:50:19.666, Speaker B: It doesn't put Ethereum under any threat as well. They're not migrating and leaving, they're just adding it's, adding more.
00:50:19.688 - 00:50:25.070, Speaker A: It's like uniswap is on Arbitrum, it's on optimism, it's on polygon, and now it's also on finance.
00:50:25.150 - 00:50:30.840, Speaker B: A story on coinbase, of course, with a uniswap floaty here. I don't understand this image, David, but.
00:50:31.290 - 00:50:33.426, Speaker A: It'S hard to get images for crypto headlines.
00:50:33.458 - 00:50:58.270, Speaker B: Man true wormhole hacker moved $155,000,000 in the biggest shift of stolen funds in months. Moved it and then also staked a portion of this with Lido, started doing some things with it. So refresh us on the wormhole hacker made out with, like, hundreds of millions of dollars in hacking this bridge protocol. It's still live on chain and we could track it, of course, moving from place to place. And now they're active again.
00:50:58.340 - 00:51:25.442, Speaker A: Yeah. So, wormhole hack. Third largest crypto hack in 2022. Wormhole is the bridge between Ethereum and Salana, backed by Jump. And so Jump actually filled that hole in Wormhole, so they took the hit there to make people whole again. 120,000 Ether was stolen in February 2022 during the hack. So the hacker has now transferred $155,000,000 onto some exchange, then went on to swap that around in various DFI protocols.
00:51:25.442 - 00:51:55.620, Speaker A: The latest on chain activity has us at 995,000 Ether sent to OpenOcean I don't know that Dex. And then converted into ETH, pegged assets like staked Ether and wrapped staked Ether. And then what they did with all of their staked ETH is they used it as collateral to borrow 13 million die, which they then swapped it for more staked ETH, wrapped and then wrapped that staked ETH again and then borrowed more dai. So they are leveraging long on their staked ETH. They stole a bunch of ETH and now they're leveraging it up.
00:51:56.470 - 00:51:59.342, Speaker B: So they are now the fifth largest holder of staked ETH.
00:51:59.406 - 00:51:59.826, Speaker A: Yes.
00:51:59.928 - 00:52:26.826, Speaker B: According to this tweet right here, which is pretty crazy. Is this threatening at all to protocol like Lido? So let's say the authorities say, hey, you can no longer interact. Protocol can no longer interact with this specific ETH address. Why? Because it's a criminal. So we find out the hacker is like North Korea or something like this, and it makes its way in an Ofax sanction list this specific address. Is this threatening to make or is this threatening to Lido at all? Yeah.
00:52:26.848 - 00:52:36.794, Speaker A: So I put out a tweet. Can lido confiscate. This ETH. This staked ETH. Turns out the answer is no. And I'll go back to what I was saying earlier. If it can be regulated, then it ought to be regulated.
00:52:36.794 - 00:52:50.498, Speaker A: And if it cannot be regulated, then it's fine. And so hackers like Ethereum doesn't know the difference between a normal good person and a hacker. It's just everyone's treated equally. And if no protocol has the ability to do anything about that, that's just the way that it is.
00:52:50.584 - 00:53:21.846, Speaker B: And you can bet authorities are watching these funds move and waiting for this person to slip up so they can nail them in real life, which is fine with me. NFT stuff. Okay. Did doodles just move to the Flow blockchain? I think so. Here is a tweet from, I think, one of the founders of the Doodles NFT project. So why did we choose Flow for doodles too? And he goes on, he states why? What's the TLDR of why doodles is moving to Flow?
00:53:21.958 - 00:53:47.138, Speaker A: They think that they can get better customer user onboarding using the Flow blockchain. They think the UX is easier. And so newcomers can just get better access to Flow by all the various differences of the Flow blockchain. My critique of this is always that yeah, of course things like Flow are better, are more like web two and therefore easier for new users because they are web two because it's centralized. But that's just my last time I.
00:53:47.144 - 00:53:56.726, Speaker B: Heard about flow is in the context of Top shots. And even TOPSHOTS was kind of named in this tweet. In fact, the Flow founder says this is how TOPSHOTS got to 400,000 people.
00:53:56.828 - 00:54:06.138, Speaker A: Newcomers can create a wallet by signing into Gmail and then buy an NFT with a credit card. It's like, yeah, okay, all mean.
00:54:06.224 - 00:54:38.630, Speaker B: That is interesting, right? And you kind of wonder if other NFT projects are going to migrate. We've long known that they would migrate off of the Ethereum main chain, of course, but the big question is where do they go next? And it seems like the answer for Doodles was Flow. I also somewhat wonder, David, if this was subsidized. I know many blockchains, even layer twos, but certainly alternative layer ones essentially subsidize projects in order to kind of move to their chain. So I wonder if some of that was involved. Here's a full letter to the community. Is there any takeaways from this?
00:54:38.700 - 00:55:08.702, Speaker A: Yeah, it's just like the Doodles. Community knows that they're going to offend a certain set of their cohort of their community because flow is just not crypto aligned, it's not crypto native. Yet at the same time, as an ethereum person, we should take this as a signal that our layer twos are not ready to do the things that they will eventually be able to do. And so other systems, ones that are more centralized and have compromised, have been able to adopt protocols like this because they can just have better onboarding experience.
00:55:08.836 - 00:55:10.894, Speaker B: I think it's great. Bring on the competition, right?
00:55:10.932 - 00:55:11.614, Speaker A: Sure.
00:55:11.812 - 00:55:14.450, Speaker B: Pudgy Penguins is doing something too. What are they up to?
00:55:14.600 - 00:55:35.590, Speaker A: Migrating to other ecosystems such as Arbitrum, Polygon and BNB. So Pudgy Penguins, using layer zero, which is a cross protocol intercommunications protocol, has allowed for crosschain bridging for little Pudgies, one of the derivative projects so that you can find little Pudgies across more blockchains.
00:55:36.010 - 00:55:40.758, Speaker B: This is a take on all of these happenings from Cyrus Unesi. What's he say?
00:55:40.844 - 00:56:04.160, Speaker A: Yeah, he goes as an ETH. Maxi, I'm disappointed by this. I love the facetious self labeling of ETH Maxis, by the way. As an ETH maxi, I'm disappointed by this. But every Layer Two builder needs to read this thread and figure out what type of onboarding and user experience they need to provide if they want to scale to the masses. It's just a fair, reasonable take. It's like, hey, our layer twos are not as polished as compromised layer ones, but they need to be.
00:56:04.630 - 00:56:15.186, Speaker B: Absolutely. David, you told me this was big news, but I wasn't following it. Board Ape community launched a new collection, apparently an upcoming Sewer NFT Pass. What is that?
00:56:15.288 - 00:56:42.550, Speaker A: It's no longer upcoming. It is. Release sewer NFT pass. It's a game called Dookie Dash released by Yuga Labs. And in order to access this game, users had to hold a sewer pass NFT that was free for all board ape or mutant ape holders. So a new NFT that was created, that was claimable by board Ape and mutant ape holders that I can't remember what the price for one of these NFTs started trading on the secondary market and was definitely trivial and definitely non zero. It was definitely a good price.
00:56:42.550 - 00:57:24.470, Speaker A: And so the game instructs holders to reach a score above zero to validate the sewer pass and then transforms them into a mysterious power source. Blah, blah, blah. Okay. The wealth effect from Board Apes and Yuga Labs is absolutely insane because if you are a board Ape holder, you got to mint a mutant ape, you got to mint a board ape kennel club, you got access to the other side mint, you got the ape token drop. Now you got this NFT. So a lot of people who are outside like me, looking in at the Board Apes are like, why are those floor prices so high? How is the ape coin so high? Well, it's because the wealth effect Yuga Labs keeps on airdropping, so much value to the ape.
00:57:25.050 - 00:57:28.302, Speaker B: The community is really sticking around. It doesn't seem like some of these.
00:57:28.376 - 00:57:30.410, Speaker A: Yeah, because they're making them rich, dude.
00:57:30.490 - 00:57:40.526, Speaker B: But we're in the bear market, and if everybody was leaving, if everybody was pressing the sell button, they would no longer be rich. It seems like this community is here to stay.
00:57:40.628 - 00:57:46.398, Speaker A: Right. Because the dividends you get from holding an ape has been it's like paid for the ape like five times over. Yeah.
00:57:46.484 - 00:58:12.774, Speaker B: I'm saying I'm bullish on any community that is surviving and thriving in this bear market. And if that's what this community is doing, then it sort of makes me bullish. Not enough to buy an ape, but what else they doing. This is a tweet. The Board Ape Yacht Club organization sets a huge legal precedent yesterday for the whole NFT space. What is this huge legal precedent? This kind of went unnoticed, but you brought it to our attention.
00:58:12.902 - 00:58:53.890, Speaker A: Yeah. So in the terms for this sewer pass dookie dash game, there was in the fine print by minting this NFT, I believe they says, by accepting these terms, you are agreeing to resolve any dispute between you and Ugalabs through binding individual arbitration rather than in court. So if I'm reading this, I'm not a lawyer, but they're saying, hey, by participating this, you remove your ability to take Ugalabs to court for any dispute. And then they also finished saying you also waive any right to participate in a class action lawsuit or classwide arbitration against Yuga Labs. So that's new out of the NFT industry. What's your reaction to this? Ryan?
00:58:54.050 - 00:59:20.862, Speaker B: The reaction is obviously before Minting, you're going to get hit with one of these gigantic terms of service agreements. From here moving on, every project is going to have one of these to cover themselves. And that makes sense, but it's also just like, okay, well, that's back to the legal system. How many terms of services have you ever read before clicking your iPhone update or whatever it is? Yeah, I mean, cool.
00:59:20.916 - 00:59:38.514, Speaker A: I guess to me, this is the private market filling in the holes that things like the SEC and the CFTC has left. They haven't given us any clarity. So teams like UGA Labs are saying, like, hey, in order to participate, you can't sue us. Maybe, or maybe it's just fine. That's fine for me, but I'm okay.
00:59:38.552 - 00:59:51.862, Speaker B: With them covering their ass. And it's not like we created a new governance structure for board Ape holders to settle their disputes amongst one another. They're just saying if you mint this thing, then you can't sue Yuga, which covers them.
00:59:51.916 - 01:00:22.898, Speaker A: But I mean, it's like, it doesn't matter what asset, what NFT, if people buy it and then it goes down in price. If it goes down enough, people sue. It doesn't matter what the precedent is or what the grounds are. There's like, I'm going to sue. And so this is just yuga labs finding a mechanism to protect themselves from that. And this is the private market saying, like, figuring out when there's lack of clarity or lack of investor protections, the people issuing the tokens get to determine what the protections are.
01:00:22.984 - 01:00:38.294, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, my only take here is I don't know whether it's good or bad, but I know it's going to be omnipresent from here on out. In all NFTs, I'm sure the Porsche NFT collection failed to gain traction. Man what happened? People not into Porsche NFTs? David yeah.
01:00:38.332 - 01:00:56.114, Speaker A: So Porsche NFT Porsche. Or is it Porsche? Porsche released an NFT collection, I think, like 10,000 of them, for selling at a whopping 0.911 ether per mint. And what does the NFT look like? It is a JPEG of a Porsche. Porsche. It's a JPEG.
01:00:56.182 - 01:01:02.720, Speaker B: Porsche. I love that. David and I don't know for sure because, of course, I'm not a car guy. I don't know if you are. Are you a car?
01:01:03.570 - 01:01:06.750, Speaker A: Oh, I would love cars. I would love to tell you about my car.
01:01:06.820 - 01:01:13.280, Speaker B: I know. Because people, Bankless listeners know we're huge sports guys, but we've never had a car.
01:01:13.730 - 01:01:18.246, Speaker A: Oh, actually, I'm not a modern car guy. I am an old car guy.
01:01:18.348 - 01:01:21.894, Speaker B: Just like it's like your music, right? You listen to a lot of old rock and stuff.
01:01:21.932 - 01:01:25.990, Speaker A: Well, since we're talking about it, I'm going to go send you a photo and we're going to talk about my car real quick.
01:01:26.140 - 01:01:27.590, Speaker B: Do I have to do this right now?
01:01:27.660 - 01:01:29.382, Speaker A: Yes, you do, because you brought it up.
01:01:29.436 - 01:01:32.774, Speaker B: David, I drive a 2015 Honda Odyssey. Okay?
01:01:32.812 - 01:01:38.650, Speaker A: I'm not honda Odyssey was the car that I was riding in when I was being driven to soccer practice.
01:01:41.310 - 01:01:42.714, Speaker B: There's no shame in that. All right.
01:01:42.752 - 01:01:45.086, Speaker A: It's a good car. I'm sending this to you on take.
01:01:45.108 - 01:01:57.650, Speaker B: You from A to B. Guys, I am anxiously awaiting sorry for the interruption. This roll up, I'm anxiously awaiting David's car picture. Wow. This looks slick, man. This looks like something old James Bond would here.
01:01:57.720 - 01:01:57.906, Speaker A: Right?
01:01:57.928 - 01:01:59.010, Speaker B: Can I find this?
01:01:59.160 - 01:02:01.138, Speaker A: Yeah, right click it and let me.
01:02:01.144 - 01:02:01.934, Speaker B: Show the Bankless nation.
01:02:01.982 - 01:02:07.458, Speaker A: Look at that. What is this? That is a 1972 Volvo P 1800.
01:02:07.544 - 01:02:08.594, Speaker B: You still own this?
01:02:08.712 - 01:02:11.602, Speaker A: Yeah, it's sitting in the garage of my house back in Seattle.
01:02:11.666 - 01:02:14.342, Speaker B: In real life NFT, guys. David Owens. I didn't know that.
01:02:14.396 - 01:02:16.582, Speaker A: That car has been in my family longer than I have.
01:02:16.636 - 01:02:24.490, Speaker B: No way. Yeah, this is a family not a family car. I have a family car. It's called a Honda Odyssey. I don't know what this is.
01:02:24.560 - 01:02:25.834, Speaker A: This is not a family car.
01:02:25.952 - 01:02:41.182, Speaker B: An heirloom. That's awesome. All right, guys. Well, that was our car talk. So expect to hear more car talk from Bankless in the upcoming episodes. Actually, that will never happen. What do we got next? David back on track.
01:02:41.182 - 01:02:44.810, Speaker B: Porsche, the NFT didn't work out. Anything else to cover?
01:02:44.900 - 01:02:53.874, Speaker A: There was a supply of 7500 of them I think they sold 900 total. Yeah. So did not flop or did flop? Excuse me?
01:02:53.912 - 01:02:54.846, Speaker B: Did flop.
01:02:55.038 - 01:02:55.742, Speaker A: Big flop.
01:02:55.806 - 01:02:56.962, Speaker B: Well, moving on.
01:02:57.096 - 01:02:58.578, Speaker A: Still made about 1000 e's.
01:02:58.674 - 01:03:02.598, Speaker B: David, some interesting news here, too. I think you're going to have to tell us.
01:03:02.684 - 01:03:29.546, Speaker A: Brand new headline, trump NFT holders have been airdropped classified intel by Donald Trump himself. Actually, no, that's a rug. That headline brought to you by the Rug, which is a product out of the Dow. This is something I think we're going to try and experiment with. But the rug is a weekly issue of A. It's like the onion of crypto aliens invented bitcoin. Canadian government sends Ukraine $45 billion of shib chat.
01:03:29.546 - 01:03:52.726, Speaker A: BT can't write satire for shit. Some of the headlines are pretty damn funny. Gemini suspected of being run by one or more evil twins. If you are not paying attention to the rug, there's a link in the show notes. You can collect this post on Mirror, by the way. And so, moving forward, the idea is that we are going to slip in a rug every single weekly roll up, and we're going to read that headline at some point in the time.
01:03:52.828 - 01:03:53.974, Speaker B: This is the Rug this week.
01:03:54.012 - 01:03:55.986, Speaker A: This is the rug. Y'all just got rugged.
01:03:56.098 - 01:03:58.770, Speaker B: Trump NFT holders AirDrop classified intel.
01:03:58.850 - 01:03:59.862, Speaker A: I think that's pretty funny.
01:03:59.926 - 01:04:06.380, Speaker B: I think that's funny intel's in the news, man. Everyone's getting classified intel. All right, what do we got next?
01:04:07.230 - 01:04:26.542, Speaker A: Peter Thiel wound down his eight year long bitcoin bet in March of 2022. So he sold pretty damn close to the top. And a very early supporter of bitcoin cashed out in March of 2022. Not long after being crazy on the bitcoin 2022 stage. But that's a topic for a different day.
01:04:26.676 - 01:04:37.102, Speaker B: He held his bitcoin for eight years, though. Eight years. That's a long term holder. He made about 1.8 billion. He bought his bitcoin in 2014 and then just sold it in March. Good timing.
01:04:37.102 - 01:04:43.574, Speaker B: March 2022. And then went on a bitcoin stage and talked about how bullish he was on bitcoin later that year.
01:04:43.692 - 01:04:46.514, Speaker A: Was it later that year? Was it actually after he sold?
01:04:46.562 - 01:04:55.866, Speaker B: Might have been the same time. When was bitcoin? Miami is in March 2022. Maybe he went david you think he went to that conference and was like, these people are crazy, and oh, my.
01:04:55.888 - 01:04:58.550, Speaker A: God, it was in April. It was in April.
01:04:58.630 - 01:04:58.922, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:04:58.976 - 01:05:02.380, Speaker A: He sold in March and started shilling in April. What was he doing?
01:05:03.150 - 01:05:04.894, Speaker B: I'd be a little mad at that if I own more.
01:05:04.932 - 01:05:15.870, Speaker A: I mean, if he's going to buy back in at the bottom, that's fine. Guy held for eight years. He's held longer than most people sold in March and then went to the conference in April.
01:05:16.770 - 01:05:29.258, Speaker B: Oh, whales. What are you going to do? All right. On releases this week. So somebody built a really cool protocol, I would guess. A protocol kind of extension. It's called proof of innocence. It's built on tornado cache.
01:05:29.258 - 01:05:37.866, Speaker B: I think the best way to think about this is it basically enables a tornado cash user, which of course, David and I are not because we're a US.
01:05:37.888 - 01:05:38.278, Speaker A: Citizen.
01:05:38.374 - 01:06:05.700, Speaker B: And that would be illegal. David once was. And what it does is it essentially allows you to cryptographically prove that you or your ETH address is not on an OFAC sanction list, even though you've interacted with tornado cash. So the builders are calling this a Proof of Innocence protocol uses cryptography to do this. I think it's brilliant, David, because of course it is. Basically OFAC and treasury. Of course.
01:06:05.700 - 01:06:33.354, Speaker B: OFAC is an organization. Under treasury there's a sanctions list. And what they did was they blanket banned everyone from using tornado cash. That is, if you're a US. Citizen, you couldn't use it. And a whole bunch of people said, including us. What about the legitimate uses of tornado cash? Are you saying no one who is an American citizen can have access to on chain privacy? Are you saying all of us are criminals? And Ofax's response was like, yeah, basically that's what we're saying.
01:06:33.354 - 01:07:00.226, Speaker B: Not only that is that probably unconstitutional and possibly on its way to the Supreme Court. There are multiple lawsuits, one which includes my co host David, going on right now. Now we have a tool that we can use to cryptographically prove that we are not criminals using tornado cash. I think this is magic. You can view the details if you're interested in this. There's a medium post in the show notes. But my question that the treasury is basically this.
01:07:00.226 - 01:07:25.180, Speaker B: All right, can you unsanction the code now? Right. Because if we run this tool, we basically prove that we are not some of the addresses that you suspect are North Korea or other sanctioned type addresses. That we are just average Americans looking for crypto privacy. Or maybe or the question to treasury is, was this really not about protecting us from criminals and terrorists all along? Were you trying to do something else?
01:07:25.630 - 01:08:02.134, Speaker A: That's the beauty about this whole thing. This is a statement of speech. I don't think it's really about the actual implementation of this code. It's about making a point, which is that now users can access privacy tools while proving that they're not North Korea or any other illicit actor still have their privacy, which is their constitutional right, and then prove that they're not a criminal. And if OFAC doesn't remove this tornado cash now from Sanction code, it just proves that it wasn't about North Korea in the first place. It was about making sure that they can spy on us.
01:08:02.332 - 01:08:03.814, Speaker B: Thanks to the builders for building this.
01:08:03.852 - 01:08:04.230, Speaker A: Thank you.
01:08:04.300 - 01:08:05.858, Speaker B: Why we love cryptography.
01:08:05.954 - 01:08:10.698, Speaker A: See, cryptographic cryptography is both the solution the problem and the solution to all problems.
01:08:10.784 - 01:08:14.554, Speaker B: 100%. Yeah. We are cryptography maximalists around here.
01:08:14.592 - 01:08:15.242, Speaker A: Oh, God, yes.
01:08:15.296 - 01:08:39.250, Speaker B: Robinhood has just rolled out a new wallet. A new crypto wallet. This, they say, is going to be a competitor to MetaMask and they plan to onboard a million users this way. David, I think we've got a beta access to this. I haven't had a chance to test it out, but Robinhood is very much known for their design. And I know we talked to the Robinhood's founder back in the summer and told us this was coming. Well, now it's finally here.
01:08:39.250 - 01:08:49.106, Speaker B: I'm excited to have new wallet entrants on the scene because I think competition will drive better solutions to the market. So this is great to see.
01:08:49.208 - 01:08:57.960, Speaker A: And you know those Robinhood users are going to be super picky, so they're not going to accept gas fees or anything like that. So this wallet has to solve that.
01:08:59.130 - 01:09:15.246, Speaker B: This is built on polygon right now, so they're also going to add support for Ethereum and there's probably a way to get into some beta access and then I think that will release to everyone later in the year. David, this is a new product from Index Co op. What's this?
01:09:15.348 - 01:09:22.830, Speaker A: Diversified Staked ETH Index It's just basically all of the Staked ETH tokens inside of an index. That's that well done.
01:09:22.900 - 01:09:25.418, Speaker B: Some of them are risky, some of them are less risky.
01:09:25.594 - 01:09:27.438, Speaker A: And now they're all together now they're.
01:09:27.454 - 01:09:30.994, Speaker B: All together in one kind of packaged risk model for you.
01:09:31.032 - 01:09:34.242, Speaker A: Diversified portfolio that is DeFi for you.
01:09:34.376 - 01:09:36.498, Speaker B: Davidson raises this week. What's this first one?
01:09:36.584 - 01:10:07.360, Speaker A: Centrifuge raised $252,000,000 to add more power to the real world asset revolution, which is a revolution I'm a big fan of. Centrifuge is the system that helps put debt products on chain loans, et cetera. Been around for a while. Long term cooperation with both Maker and Ave to help take real world assets and put that value of real world assets into DeFi, allowing MakerDAO to not just be the central bank of Ethereum, but the central bank of the whole entire world. Which is why I'm bullish on it.
01:10:08.130 - 01:10:09.946, Speaker B: We got this as well from Quicknode.
01:10:09.978 - 01:10:29.714, Speaker A: Tell us about this quicknode. 800 million dollar valuation in their Series B. Series B raised $60 million. Basically crypto infrastructure firm providing blockchain development tools. Two record quarters in 2022. And revenue grew over 300% last year, which is wow, 300% in 2022. Jesus.
01:10:29.762 - 01:10:39.706, Speaker B: I know. Pretty amazing. Good to see more blockchain infrastructure funding for sure. Quicknon is a good company. Doing great work. Guys. We have some questions from Bankless citizens this week.
01:10:39.706 - 01:10:42.042, Speaker B: The first one, let's see who is this from?
01:10:42.096 - 01:10:43.690, Speaker A: This is from Danton.
01:10:44.590 - 01:11:08.910, Speaker B: Danton. Okay. Danton in discord. I think we're looking at the question a question on these Staking derivative tokens. David, I'm going to throw this one to you. Why is there a premium on Reith that is a Staking derivative for rocket pool and a discount on St ETH, which is a Staking derivative for Lido? That's the question. Is it purely that our ETH is currently the most decentralized option and less reliant on a single point of failure.
01:11:08.910 - 01:11:30.882, Speaker B: If all liquid staking derivatives LSDs are eventually one to one with ETH, then what is the benefit of buying or holding Re? Essentially, what's the benefit of one over the other? And is there a benefit to Reith when the gains and staking rewards are essentially canceled out by the premium you pay? Help us understand these staking derivatives and why they trade with different market prices.
01:11:30.946 - 01:12:01.534, Speaker A: Yeah, so Danson's intuition was correct. Reith has a premium because the costs of decentralization are always higher. Lido doesn't have a cap on the supply of staked ether because you just come in, there's no bond from the stakers. So the lido validators the 29 of them. You can come in and you give them your ether and they don't have to put up any sort of bond. That's what the role of the Lido dow is. With rocket pool, the far more decentralized option, rocket pool stakers do have to put up a 16 ETH bond.
01:12:01.534 - 01:12:24.854, Speaker A: So there is a constraint on the supply of rocket pool staking nodes, which limits how much external ETH can come into the system. And that is just the cost of decentralization. Decentralization tends to be costly. It tends to be slow. And that is why the constraint on our ETH supply shows up as a premium on the secondary market and the unconstrained supply of staked ether from lido shows up as a discount.
01:12:24.982 - 01:12:33.962, Speaker B: So it's a little bit like the difference between Dai, which is a little bit harder to scale, and USDC, which is coinbase, can mint that to infinity.
01:12:34.026 - 01:12:35.326, Speaker A: Right? That's exactly as needed.
01:12:35.428 - 01:12:47.842, Speaker B: But what about this kind of follow up question? So what if someone buys our ETH? Is that a good idea? Or how does our ETH equalize to the price of ETH? Is there some arbitrage opportunity here?
01:12:47.896 - 01:13:05.062, Speaker A: Right? So if one R ETH is like 1.1 ether, one ether will net you like zero point 99 R ether. So you kind of lose 1% ish at that rate. And so what the Denton is asking is like, okay, well, you lose 1% right off the bat, and at five.
01:13:05.116 - 01:13:06.054, Speaker B: Why would I do this?
01:13:06.172 - 01:13:21.142, Speaker A: Five, six, 7% returns a year. I'm backwards, like I'm back like six weeks or something. I have to pay six weeks of my time in order to make up for that. So why would I do that? Well, if you want to go and mint our ether by providing a node, you actually get that 1% premium.
01:13:21.206 - 01:13:23.114, Speaker B: So you can, rather than buy it, mint it.
01:13:23.152 - 01:13:49.426, Speaker A: Mint it. Yes. And so you mint our ETH by instead of buying our ETH on the secondary market, you go to rocket pool, deposit your ether, and then you get Re in return. And then you can sell that Re for a 1% arbitrage. Now, that 1% is not that much, so you kind of have to do this at scale, but that's how you can do that. And same thing with staked ETH if you want to wait until withdrawals, which are coming in March. In theory, say staked ETH is at zero point 98 Ether.
01:13:49.426 - 01:14:04.262, Speaker A: You buy one Ether worth of staked ETH, you get 1.202 ETH worth when you can later withdraw. But you are right that essentially the discrepancies between premiums and discounts and also APIs will eventually net out because of Arbitrage.
01:14:04.406 - 01:14:47.078, Speaker B: Here's our second question, david from Danube and of course this question is in the Bankless discord, which is where Bankless citizens hang out these days. A question about layer twos. Question starts this way. It seems that every layer two starts to create an ecosystem with a different value proposition. So you have DFI on Arbitrum and NFT community on Polygon is strong and optimism has its thing. Here's the question from Danubi do you think that L two S would differentiate themselves in the future based on the value of ecosystem rather than technology? So what is it? Is the differentiator between these L two S? Is it more on the technical side or is it more in kind of the community and the set of applications that are on top of them?
01:14:47.164 - 01:15:14.622, Speaker A: I absolutely love this question because this question is talking about Ryan, the relationship between culture and code. And that is the thing that I think is the coolest thing about this whole entire industry. So Danubi. He's onto something. They're onto something that Arbitrum is super DeFi focused. Polygon's got this NFT community optimism is really focused on this governance model. And each one of these things has downstream effects as to who chooses to do what on each layer two.
01:15:14.622 - 01:16:19.654, Speaker A: So the culture behind the teams and what the teams decide to build their layer two as actually shows up in the communities that come to be built on these things. So optimism is working on this optimism collective dual token model for governance, which I think is like the longest term, most bullish time horizon for what we can do in this space is like how can we rearchitect human governance? And so you'll get a lot of the regenerative finance, public goods focused communities on optimism. Like the DeFi ecosystem on Arbitrum is super hot. So you get a lot of the DeFi people and a lot of this ultimately comes back down to how these different layer twos are constructed. And so that's one of the bullish cases for layer twos is that we have the idea that every single chain is its own city, right? Some people like La, some people hate New York, some people want to live in Seattle. Layer twos all have their own culture to all facilitate any sort of demand for any sort of niche that needs to be expressed by the people that live on these things. And so that is how I see layer twos differentiating themselves based on values rather than technology.
01:16:19.654 - 01:16:21.506, Speaker A: Even though these things have a synergistic.
01:16:21.538 - 01:16:51.370, Speaker B: Relationship, it's a little bit of both right. But I do think you're right. Over time, the technology itself will become the commodity. Right. All layer twos, just in the way that all cities in the real world adopted similar kind of standards around roads and kind of their transportation system. And all of these things not really that much different from Chicago versus New York, but there are some subtle things that are different. I do think all of these layer twos will kind of collapse on the same best set of technologies.
01:16:51.370 - 01:17:16.006, Speaker B: You can even see some of that now with some of the optimistic roll ups being like that ZK stuff. Yeah, we'll implement that when the time is right. Not yet, but soon. And I do think it'll all just collapse and what you have left is kind of the culture. That's what makes Chicago different from San Diego, different from New York City, different from Austin, different from know that's the differentiator. So I do think that will become more true over.
01:17:16.188 - 01:17:18.582, Speaker A: And this is this is why sorry, finish your thought.
01:17:18.636 - 01:17:26.022, Speaker B: I was just going to say, I think in the short run, technology does matter a good bit and probably more than it will matter in the long, long term.
01:17:26.086 - 01:17:45.294, Speaker A: Yeah. I'll take this moment to chill the Op stack. This is something that optimism is building. The Op stack is this skeleton. It's like a build a layer two workshop. And so they have all these modules that you can come and combine into a layer two. And so it takes the best of any layer two, turns it into a module, and you can build a layer two on it.
01:17:45.294 - 01:18:16.358, Speaker A: And so the Op stack is allowing for the expression of any type of layer two. And if you build it on the Op stack, any sort of layer two that is built on the Op stack actually has synergies and composability benefits and just second order positive consequences that allow these Op stack chains to work together, which is what optimism is building for. Like this massive Cambrian explosion of interoperable layer twos, layer threes that are all built on the Op stack, that allow for different technology to come together to allow for some sort of expression on top. I'm so bullish. It's so awesome. It's so sci-fi.
01:18:16.534 - 01:18:41.022, Speaker B: It's pretty exciting. By the way, speaking of awesome things going on in the community, what you're seeing now on screen is the Bankless Nation Discord. This is where we hang out. We talk about heading west. This is where we head west with Bankless citizens, Bankless community members as a group. Questions like this get asked all of the time. David, you are doing something, I believe this Friday, a special event in the Bankless Nation Discord.
01:18:41.022 - 01:18:45.214, Speaker B: Tell them about that. And how can people who are not part of this community join?
01:18:45.342 - 01:19:13.834, Speaker A: So, at the time of me speaking, newsletters going out on the Bankless newsletter that I wrote is called Ethereum, the Economic Engine. The economic machine. I'm super excited about this article and tomorrow, which is actually today for the time of listening. Listening. If you are listening, on Friday at 03:00 P.m Eastern, we're doing a little Q and A session for so everyone that's watched the video or read the article that has questions about the article at 03:00 P.m Eastern, we're all going to be all the bank list premium subscribers, all the bankless nation are going to be in the stage in discord.
01:19:13.834 - 01:19:52.860, Speaker A: And I'll give a short little monologue about the article and unpack it a little bit. And then we're going to do a Q and A session. And so for anyone that's got extra questions about the article or anything else, I'm sure we'll start talking about whatever that is happening at 03:00 P.m. Eastern for every Bankless Citizen. The other cool thing, Ryan, that happened in the discord this week, we made this channel called RSA, David Tracking, if you want to want to click on that. How do we come up with all of the topics for the Bankless Weekly roll up? Well, we put them into this channel inside of the Bankless HQ, discord, the centralized media company Discord. And then we've created this relaying channel into the Bankless Nation so the Bankless Nation can keep tabs on what we're up to and making sure we're still working.
01:19:54.670 - 01:19:58.906, Speaker B: So somebody can get our information and fork our roll up and come up with a different one, a better.
01:19:58.928 - 01:20:23.362, Speaker A: One with better hosts. Right? And so everything that we talk about, we just take the link from Twitter, from CoinDesk, wherever it is, we put it into our discord, and then that bot relays it into the Bankless Nation Discord. And then you can comment on that and see what we're going to talk about. You can see what we're going to talk about seven days ahead of time, just because we have this carbon clone copy of these two different discord channels that goes it's like a window into HQ. It's what we're up to.
01:20:23.416 - 01:20:44.966, Speaker B: A lot of cool stuff going on here. And if you want to become a we're calling them Bankless Citizens upgrade to Bankless Premium, there's a link in the show notes. And what happens is when you join, you get a link to this discord, and you can catch David's talk tomorrow. That's happening in the bankless. Discord. All right, David, we got some takes of the week. Here's the first one from Amin Soleimani ETH only rye.
01:20:44.966 - 01:21:09.646, Speaker B: That's R-A-I rye was a mistake. The ETH staking yield means that borrowing rye against pure ETH will always have some percentage opportunity cost. The rye redemption rate should almost always be negative to reflect this opportunity cost. Decentralization is expensive. People don't want to pay. All right, there's some context I think people should understand before reading this tweet. The context from my perspective is rye was too much to call it a stablecoin.
01:21:09.646 - 01:21:46.046, Speaker B: It's not tracking the. Dollar, but we'll call it a stablecoin, kind of a crypto native stablecoin that doesn't have any off chain value. So it's completely collateralized and backed by ETH. It uses some control theory to do this. It's sort of the original single collateral Dai model, only fully realized. Amin is he's been in the theorem space for a long time. He's kind of a co father of this Rye protocol, right, which has been kind of exciting for crypto natives who want, like, we want our crypto only money, right? This is him kind of waving the white flag and saying, like, hey, this method didn't work out.
01:21:46.046 - 01:22:12.566, Speaker B: And I think that's a big deal because he's been very bullish on Rye prior to this. So that's the context. I guess my question here is twofold. Why do you think Amin is waving the white flag on this Rye project? And what does this mean for the future of crypto native stablecoins? Does this mean we'll never get here? Because Rye was one of the most promising projects there. And it's just like, look at the market cap, David. It's down to like 8 million or so.
01:22:12.668 - 01:22:20.522, Speaker A: So this is like the supply of dye going down from almost 100 million down to 8 million. And so down like, man, this isn't working.
01:22:20.576 - 01:22:21.610, Speaker B: People aren't using it.
01:22:21.680 - 01:22:47.266, Speaker A: Yeah. He actually follows up with a second Tweet that has some elaboration. He goes, I tried to do some casual interest rate manipulation to set the redemption rate for positive. Basically, he's saying that Rye doesn't work when there's only one collateral and no one wants to take the opportunity cost of using their ether collateral to mint Rye when ether is just going up and up and up and up and up. And so maybe wasn't he saying that.
01:22:47.288 - 01:22:54.434, Speaker B: Maybe it works if you have staked derivatives in there instead? Like if you have SC ETH in it or like our ETH, maybe it works better.
01:22:54.552 - 01:23:30.618, Speaker A: Yeah. So he said that the Rye team has always been doubling tripling quadrupling down on Ungovernance, as in no governance mechanisms, just pure raw cryptography that makes this system work, which is admirable and very something that we should always aspire to. But he's saying that they went so far down the Ungovernance route that they were never able to swap out ether for something like staked ether or anything else because they made their system so rigid. And so I think the lesson here is there is some benefit to having human governance, like going so far down the Ungovernance.
01:23:30.714 - 01:23:45.726, Speaker B: You can't ungovern too soon until you are ready for homeostasis or ossification. Yeah, and that's what happened here. And so basically, there's a massive opportunity cost for people depositing ETH to back Rye because it means they can't stake.
01:23:45.758 - 01:23:47.250, Speaker A: It or do anything else.
01:23:47.320 - 01:23:51.206, Speaker B: Or do anything else. So it's a much higher cost of capital and just the economics don't make sense.
01:23:51.308 - 01:24:01.158, Speaker A: Also, just like tip of the hat, it's hard to admit you're wrong. So props to Amin for waving the red flag and say, like, the project I'm working on, we made a mistake.
01:24:01.254 - 01:24:04.620, Speaker B: Do you ever admit you're wrong, David? When was the last time you admitted you're wrong?
01:24:05.150 - 01:24:20.190, Speaker A: Oh, no, it depends on the context. I've admitted that we were wrong about the alt layer one trade, but I only admitted it in the short term. I still right in the long term. I need to reflect on that one a little bit more.
01:24:20.260 - 01:24:25.360, Speaker B: I got one. We admitted recently that we shouldn't have had nexo as a Q Four spirit for six weeks.
01:24:26.630 - 01:24:34.834, Speaker A: Okay. But also I'll say we should be able to have centralized sponsors because centralized products yeah, okay, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I would always like to justify it.
01:24:34.872 - 01:24:50.166, Speaker B: In some particular way. Look, the big takeaway here is I'm kind of worried we will never get sort of a crypto native backed stablecoin. That's my worry. I guess fracs is some combo of maybe it's just our hybrid options are the only things remaining for us.
01:24:50.188 - 01:24:53.478, Speaker A: But I think the decentralized enough approach is underrated.
01:24:53.654 - 01:25:01.146, Speaker B: Here's my take, David. I'll read it out in Crypto. When our banks fail, we don't bail them out. It's more painful in the short run, yet more healthy in the long run.
01:25:01.248 - 01:25:01.994, Speaker A: Pre market.
01:25:02.112 - 01:25:33.842, Speaker B: This is kind of hard to just say coming out of 2022, right? Because a lot of people got hit by 2022, including us, including many bankless listeners. And yet there's an element of like that is short run pain. But what it did was it detoxified a bunch of the things that were destined to fail anyway, and it's strengthening our market rather than the other method that we use in traditional finance is bailout. Right? We didn't have to bail anybody out. The companies that were taking undue risk.
01:25:33.986 - 01:25:35.442, Speaker A: Died pay for that risk.
01:25:35.506 - 01:25:58.106, Speaker B: They paid for it. Isn't that the way it should be? I think that's good and I'm hopeful crypto can preserve this sort of thing in the future. We'll be much smarter next time around. The appropriate people largely got hit with a penalty for the risk that they took. It's not perfect. Let me just say it's not perfect, but I think bailouts would be far worse.
01:25:58.298 - 01:26:10.370, Speaker A: I totally agree. Yeah. The comfort that is a bailout is toxic towards maturation and growth. If you don't have to deal with your consequences, you don't ever mature.
01:26:11.350 - 01:26:29.906, Speaker B: Here's your take, David. The bullcase for E staking is no longer that ethereum will be the settlement layer for the Internet. That's now the base case. The new bullcase for ETH is that it's the security layer for the entire Internet. E staking goes from one dimensional to omnidimensional. I think you're talking about Eigen layer here. Am I guessing that correctly?
01:26:30.018 - 01:27:04.746, Speaker A: Well, not specifically Eigen layer, but Eigen layer is the one that's pioneering this field of restaking, or what I kind of have called omnidimental dimensional staking, where you can take your ether and stake it to ethereum to secure ethereum, but you can also take on additional slashing penalties to secure other things as well and also get a yield for that, too. And so what do you want to secure? An oracle? You can restake your ETH. What do you want to secure? A prediction market? You can restake your ETH. So ether people think like, oh yeah, ethereum is going to be the settlement layer for the Internet. The yield on ether is going to be great. I'm going to stake and retire for the rest of my life. That's now the bait.
01:27:04.746 - 01:27:27.094, Speaker A: I'm I'm claiming that ethereum is winning that and is going to win that. And so that's not the base case for ETH. The new bullcase for ETH is that you also get additional yields for other things that you want to use your ethereum staking for that gives you additional yields. And so rather than just being ether is only meant for ether staking, ether you can stake for anything. Omnidirectional staking.
01:27:27.222 - 01:27:59.446, Speaker B: I think new bulk could be, and this should be honestly, a bankless article at some point in time because I don't think people fully understand this. Probably it kind of transitions ETH into kind of the ultimate value in some ways because the asset yeah, you can use it to bond other entire networks as mean. That's what we're talking about. It's the unit of security for the entire Internet. And I haven't fully walked through what all that means, but I think it's pretty cool.
01:27:59.548 - 01:28:04.886, Speaker A: This is why this eigen layer thing has captured the imaginations of many, many people.
01:28:04.988 - 01:28:06.710, Speaker B: All right, David, what are you bullish on this week?
01:28:06.780 - 01:29:27.570, Speaker A: I'm bullish on this concept, which is the subject of my article, which is economic equilibrium. So Ryan, the history of steam engines was that we figured out that steam has a lot of power and so we tried to harness it for a while and then it would just blow up because we couldn't figure out how to harness it. And then we figured out this mechanism called a centrifugal governor, which allowed a too hot engine to cool down and a too cooled engine to heat up. And then that was this mechanism that allowed this steam power to go into actual productive output, created the industrial revolution that we know today. I am claiming that that same mechanism of control theory, the controlling of power, is what the combination of EIP 1559 and proof of stake is for ethereum, where when gas fees, remember when gas fees were like 600 GWe? All of that value went into proof of work and we actually just lost that value expended outwards out of ethereum with proof of stake in EIP 1559, the ethereum economic machine can recapture that value, put it back into the ethereum economy and actually move forward as an engine. And so this is the subject matter of my article it came out yesterday for you Friday listeners. And it's also why I'm just so bullish on what I'm calling ethereum triggering the industrial revolution of the Internet.
01:29:27.570 - 01:29:49.674, Speaker A: Because all of this energy recapture ethereum. Block space goes into the value of ether. Ether is the dominant collateral in DeFi. When the value of ether and DeFi goes up, the downstream wealth effect for all tokens and supply of coins also goes up. And it's just this recirculating loop of economic activity that makes the Internet industrial revolution on its way. That's what I'm bullish on.
01:29:49.872 - 01:29:52.662, Speaker B: That's cool. David? David bullish on steam engines.
01:29:52.726 - 01:29:59.114, Speaker A: Steam engines from Internet steam engines, cypherpunk to steampunk. Ryan, what are you bullish on?
01:29:59.232 - 01:30:27.578, Speaker B: I'm really bullish on this proof of innocence thing. Just code that we were talking about that earlier in the show, all right? And just to recap OFAC banned tornado cash. And they said anyone who uses tornado cash is obviously a criminal. We have to assume. And so what did builders do? They developed a way to cryptographically prove that people using tornado cash are not criminals. That's just badass. That is like jujitsu against authoritarians.
01:30:27.578 - 01:31:27.446, Speaker B: I think the authoritarian move is like you can't ban it because bad people will do bad things with privacy, right? And the crypto builders are out there saying like, well, no, we can use our math and our cryptography to prove without divulging our privacy that we are not the criminals you think we are. That's what I'm bullish on. I just think that cryptography and builders and a community with shared values is always going to be able to fight back using the Internet against authoritarians and against this further encroachment of our freedom. And the reason I'm bullish on that is both because I see it happening. That's what the crypto movement is all about. And also, David, because honestly, it's our only hope as we transition to this digital era, we have to stay one step ahead of the surveillance state, surveillance corporations and those that would seek to kind of encroach and control. So, yeah, it's so cool when we see that sort of thing.
01:31:27.446 - 01:31:38.970, Speaker B: And then you can kind of put the acid test, you can throw it back to them and say like, yeah, was this really about what you say it was about protecting us from criminals and terrorists? Or was it about actually you controlling things?
01:31:39.040 - 01:31:39.466, Speaker A: Right.
01:31:39.568 - 01:32:12.390, Speaker B: And then that's where the strong community and the social layer kicks in and is like, yeah, tell us, show us. That's why we've always thought of bankless and crypto as more of a social movement than anything else. Anyway, that kind of thing just makes me bullish because I had no idea this sort of thing was feasible. And then just somebody spins it out and is like, yep, we released this open source code. Go ahead and use it, extend it if you want. And then I could tweet like something to Janet Yellen, the treasury like, hey, can we use tornado again? Because we can prove that we're not criminals. Anyway, it's cool.
01:32:12.460 - 01:32:32.806, Speaker A: Builders always, like, four steps ahead of archaic institutions. And for all the people that are suing the Department of treasury, myself included, this is just a huge piece of evidence that we get to take to the court and be like, I think so. Look at this. Look what we can do. And so it's a huge boon to all the people that are suing the Department of treasury.
01:32:32.918 - 01:32:33.754, Speaker B: Yeah, very cool.
01:32:33.792 - 01:32:34.046, Speaker A: Thank you.
01:32:34.068 - 01:32:35.006, Speaker B: All right. David meme of the week.
01:32:35.028 - 01:32:36.638, Speaker A: What are the at meme of the Week?
01:32:36.724 - 01:32:39.450, Speaker B: Boom. Roulette table.
01:32:39.610 - 01:32:53.950, Speaker A: This is the scene out of The Hangover, except all the faces have been replaced. All the wolf pack faces have been replaced by Kyle Davies of Three Arrows. Capital. We've got Sam Trucoco in the bottom left. We got Sam bankman fried. Rolling the dice. We got Doe kwan.
01:32:53.950 - 01:33:01.442, Speaker A: Who is that in the back? Barry Silbert. Oh, of course, Suzu. And then in the top right corner, we got Arthur Hayes.
01:33:01.506 - 01:33:03.510, Speaker B: Wait, what happened to Arthur? He's doing okay.
01:33:03.660 - 01:33:16.506, Speaker A: Well, I mean, after after fighting the CFTC and paying a fine, I don't think the guy the guy's in Singapore guy's not coming back to America. Each one of these things each one of these people have an X over their face. They did not make it.
01:33:16.608 - 01:33:21.994, Speaker B: Yeah. Rip wolf pack 2022. That's it for you guys.
01:33:22.112 - 01:33:58.646, Speaker A: We got a moment of Zen. Okay, we have a moment of Zen. This is for YouTube only because it is only visual. And this is about the KZG ceremony that is currently going on. If you do not know what the KZG ceremony is, there is a YouTube video interview that I did with Trent Van Epps and Carl of the Ethereum Foundation. Basically, everyone needs to contribute entropy to this KZG Foundation. And then there's this period of time where really fun and cool mechanisms of creating entropy are kind of artful ways, tasteful ways of creating entropy are also being added into ethereum to unlock EIP four eight four.
01:33:58.646 - 01:34:09.546, Speaker A: Or if you didn't understand that, go watch the video. But here is a very fun and creative way of creating entropy to add to ethereum. And that will come after right after Ryan tells you all about how risky crypto is.
01:34:09.648 - 01:35:25.620, Speaker B: Yeah, guys, it's super risky, okay? You could lose what you put in, but we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot, Sam SA.
