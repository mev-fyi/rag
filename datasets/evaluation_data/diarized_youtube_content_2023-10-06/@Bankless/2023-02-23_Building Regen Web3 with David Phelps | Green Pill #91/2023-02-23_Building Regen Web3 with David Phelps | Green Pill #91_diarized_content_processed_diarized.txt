00:00:04.970 - 00:00:05.326, Speaker A: What's up?
00:00:05.348 - 00:00:40.962, Speaker B: Coordination on the pod. Today we have David Phelps, who is one of the founding members of Jokedao, Ecodao and Calfun. In this episode, we talk about building regen dows. We talk about the infinite garden of projects, the fauna and the organisms that are all building on top of each other, and how together they create an ecosystem that's just stalked is greater than the sum of its parts. So, quite a fun episode with David. I really like to hang out with the OG builders and hear what they're thinking, how they're thinking about things, and David is just one of those. So, a pretty fun episode.
00:00:40.962 - 00:00:43.686, Speaker B: Without further ado, I give you David Phelps.
00:00:43.798 - 00:01:16.334, Speaker C: Working in web3 is awesome. But working outside of the typical W Two employee structure is a deal breaker for so many. Opolis is helping the self sovereign worker focus on what they do best. Their work. Tax time is coming up. Opolis helps professionalize your business by helping you form an entity, generate proof of employment through Pay subs and receive a W Two at the end of the tax year. Are you self employed and forced to spend money on expensive healthcare insurance with limited coverage? Opolis leverages group buying power through a community employment coop, helping you save 20% to 50% on high quality, affordable healthcare options through Cigna.
00:01:16.334 - 00:01:53.230, Speaker C: And finally, Opel's member owners share in Opelis's success and profits based on their work token holdings. You must be authorized to work inside the United States in select Canadian provinces to receive Opelis's benefits. Book a 30 minutes free consultation with Opelis's experts and join Opelus by March 31, 2023 to get 1000 work and a thousand bank tokens. Go to Connect Opelis Co Bankless to get started. And if you're going to East Denver, make sure to stop by the Opelis booth or attend their Future of Work Summit hosted by Opolis. The Glow Dollar is a new stablecoin with a very special property. As the market cap of Glow goes up, extreme poverty goes down.
00:01:53.230 - 00:02:32.630, Speaker C: Glow is a dollar backed non profit stablecoin that creates basic income for people living in extreme poverty. Glow is basically the same business model as USDC, with yield generating treasuries on one side and a stablecoin on ethereum on the other. But instead of being a for profit company, glow is a nonprofit that donates 100% of all yields from the Glow Reserve to Give Directly's basic Income Program. Give Directly is a charity that gives people money, no strings attached, to people living in poverty, and is a charity that Vitalik has previously donated to and supported in the past. With Glow, you can reduce poverty just by holding a stablecoin. Glow is launching in early 2023 and you can join the waitlist@glowdollar.org. Greenpill.
00:02:32.630 - 00:02:36.362, Speaker C: That's GL odollar.org greenpill.
00:02:36.506 - 00:02:40.574, Speaker A: What's up, David? What's up? How's it going?
00:02:40.692 - 00:02:45.940, Speaker B: So glad to have you. I think that we've been planning this episode for a while, so let's get into it. What are you working on?
00:02:47.990 - 00:03:02.638, Speaker A: So I'm building this thing called Jokedow, which is on chain governance. So a way for any online community to be able to make execute and reward decisions. You keep me going, I'm just going to recite the entire spiel. So cut me off.
00:03:02.664 - 00:03:08.070, Speaker B: Yeah, well, no, I think that we want to get the spiel, but I was hoping that you would tell it to me as a joke since it's called Jokedow.
00:03:09.290 - 00:03:15.690, Speaker A: Absolutely not. No, you're going to have to stake tokens for that and pay me for that. This is crypto. I don't do things for free.
00:03:15.760 - 00:03:24.670, Speaker B: That's right. Yeah. I'll have to incentivize that behavior. Well, take us down the rabbit hole. So how do I use jokedow?
00:03:26.770 - 00:03:54.966, Speaker A: Yeah, so super simple. You set up what we call a contest. And a contest means that as a contest creator, you put a prompt to a community. That prompt could be like, hey, what should we focus on? Or like, hey, here's a proposal. Can you submit another version of it? Or hey, here's a project I want to build. Does anyone want to build this? Right? Or hey, I'm a writer, I'm writing on my newsletter. What topics do you want me to cover? It could be any sort of prompt you want, right? In the submissions period, community can submit options.
00:03:54.966 - 00:04:56.490, Speaker A: We call them proposals in response, and then in the voting period, they can vote on their favorites. And so what is special about this is, first of all, that communities now are actually having active say in being able to submit and say what they want, right? They're not just voting as their voice, they're actually having voice to say the kind of things that they want, right. Second, you design who gets to submit and who gets to vote. So if you want just your core team to submit options and your community to vote on them, which is how Dow governance has always been done to date, you can do that, but you can also do the reverse, right? You can have your community all submit options and then just a core team votes on them. You could have like a hackathon where everyone submits their project and then like a jury of top people, the space vote on their favorites. You can have a totally separate community to it, right? You could say, I could go governance vampire tech to the Gitcoin community by saying, hey, GTC holders, I'm airdropping you the submission token. I want your best ideas and I'm going to reward the best of you with my token and I'm going to steal you all from Gitcoin and bring you over into my nefarious project that I'm working on as well.
00:04:56.490 - 00:05:21.954, Speaker A: And then the final thing, right, is that in the voting period, because it's ranked choice, voting effectively means nobody is voting against something publicly. You're just voting for for the options that are most meaningful to you. And so you actually get a good measure of people's passion. So if you're doing a grants round, right, instead of having every single grant be individually approved, yes or no, you can actually see which of those grants the community cares most about and you can allocate your resources to those.
00:05:21.992 - 00:05:30.722, Speaker B: So it feels like it's kind of a collective intelligence tool, token gated, or maybe like a modular approach to building collective intelligence.
00:05:30.786 - 00:06:00.510, Speaker A: Yeah, I like that. Yeah. I was chatting this morning with a friend of mine about how you could use this for prediction markets and being like, could you use this as an educational tool where people would be like, here's what I think the economy is going to look like six months from now. And then we all predict what it's going to look like. And the point of that is not actually to get useful data on what the economy will look like, it's to have this kind of gamified structure for learning where whoever's right wins a reward. Everyone else has to explain why they're wrong. Right.
00:06:00.510 - 00:06:22.486, Speaker A: And so you can start using this in educational settings. Yeah. Collective intelligence. You could use it for maybe some more accurate prediction markets if you're really careful with who gets to vote and submit, but completely. Yeah. It's about unlocking the actual potential of creative contribution for people to be able to participate, which is, I hope, what the unlock of Dows is, but not something that we've seen a lot to date with joke Dow because you can.
00:06:22.508 - 00:06:27.320, Speaker B: Use it to select better jokes. Or is it because the logo is a joker up here on the top left?
00:06:29.130 - 00:06:54.500, Speaker A: Yeah, it's because we started with a logo and then we were like, Fuck, what are we going to call this? I don't know if I'm allowed to swear, but I'm going to I don't know what we call this thing. No. So there's a few reasons. One is that we started with a proof of concept called the joker. This, which still runs every week, where you voting your favorite joke, your goal is to get second place. If you put too many votes, you go to first, you lose. And so that was really the proof of concept to kind of test out my thesis with the easiest and most fun way to do it.
00:06:54.500 - 00:07:26.182, Speaker A: Would having a mechanism like this build relationships where people are incentivized to collaborate with each other socially and then do this every week? And it worked. And so that's part of it. I think the other pretentious answers that I really like to give for this one, one is that jokes are the original decentralized technology. Jokes are passed down p to P. We have no idea who the original teller was. We don't care who the original teller was. What we care about is how someone's inflection of that joke is unique.
00:07:26.182 - 00:08:11.314, Speaker A: Right. And so even if you've heard the joke a bunch of times, it's about the telling of it, right? More than it's about the content. I think that it's a really beautiful distributed system of this decentralized creation that has no single person who's created this. It's retold every time in the process. I think the other thing is to think kind of the ethos of joke is I think the words we use are like batshit anarchist and it's pretty important to us to think crypto is kind of a batshit anarchist thing. It's like the fact that you can take anybody else's work and fork it, build on top of it without asking their permission and just all kind of contribute to innovation on top of each other permissionlessly. That's something where it's like the fundamental ethos, I think, of crypto and why I get excited by it is it's not too serious.
00:08:11.314 - 00:08:23.438, Speaker A: You can't take anyone else's work too seriously. You always have to take it as a little bit of a joke and then think about how you can improve on it, take it, play with it, et cetera. Then so that's why I love the.
00:08:23.444 - 00:09:01.900, Speaker B: Sort of like website designer me likes this idea of starting with something that's as fun and easy and light hearted as telling a joke. And then if you get people using it going through the loop of actually using it for that, then you can actually okay, well, now you've got enough data points that you can start adding complexity or seriousness to it. To that same infrastructure, and they can actually use it for real things, because a lot of these governance problems governance feels like work. And if you can make it feel like fun to start and then get the data. Emissions that are actually useful for economic means out of that, then I think that it's just a better way to approach getting people to use the system.
00:09:03.550 - 00:09:31.038, Speaker A: Yeah, I think. What are the issues with governance? Well, one is it's not fun. So if you actually want decentralized communities to participate, it needs to be fun. And it's like, look, the move over the past ten years in culture has been completely towards interactive fan communities. Like, you look at TikTok, right? You look at successful YouTube creators, they create interactive fan communities where they're listening, responding to their fans in this way. Dows are just a version of that. Dows are just the outcome of this move over the past ten years for communities to have more say.
00:09:31.038 - 00:10:03.738, Speaker A: But the reason they do that is not the financial incentives. The reason they do that is the social incentives that this is a fun thing to do. And that's the thing that we've just been missing in Dows. Like if you have to vote and you're publicly saying no against a friend of yours, you are not going to want to do that. That's not a fun process to engage in, right? I think also governance is not paid, I would add, is a big issue, really difficult governance, like making big financial decisions. That is work and that is work that requires a lot of effort, a lot of time, a lot of thought and deserves to be compensated, I think, accordingly as well. And so that's why building on chain is really important for us.
00:10:03.738 - 00:10:23.598, Speaker A: It's also a way to be able to compensate people for doing governance. And then the question is who should be making these decisions? And that's a larger, longer tangent. But I think the way we built it was to be as modular as possible. So you have the design space to say who you want to submit, who you want to vote and you as a community can decide how you design that governance process in terms of who you want to have say and how much say they have.
00:10:23.604 - 00:10:44.106, Speaker B: Yeah, it's kind of like a return for me user centric design in crypto terms because I think in 2017 there was this feeling that if you take a human and you put a token in them you will get out in action. It's just like people aren't that rational nor do they give a shit about your token that you're doing. And I like starting from the other end, I think.
00:10:44.128 - 00:11:40.330, Speaker A: So I think about that a lot, right? That web ₩2 and became big purely through social incentives, right? There's no financial incentives in web two. And that's part of the argument that web3 has against web two is like the fact that you are being monetized, your data is being harvested, you're making money for corporations. But it's not like people don't know that they fundamentally are fine losing all of that financial upside because the social incentives are so great, right? And so 99% of people will happily give up financial upside in order to have a good time with friends. And why wouldn't they? That's the logical thing you should do. And so yeah, I think until web3 is first of all as easy to use as web Two but also has the same as social incentives, web3's opportunity is not replacing social incentives with financial incentives. That's what we've seen to date and it hasn't worked. Like web3's potential is adding financial incentives to social incentives for people to get fairly compensated for the value.
00:11:40.400 - 00:12:09.590, Speaker B: Kind of reminds me of this idea that if you take something, if you reward someone with extrinsic motivation for doing action X and then you withdraw the extrinsic motivation, they will stop doing that action. But if you start where someone is already intrinsically doing it, not only do you like you have the intrinsic plus the extrinsic motivation but it just feels like a more solid foundation for building these web3 tools.
00:12:11.210 - 00:12:38.122, Speaker A: And it's kind of like why bear markets are these self fulfilling prophecies, right? Because as soon as things start to go bad, then there's no opportunity to make money here, then everyone else withdraws. So it's not just like people are withdrawing because they're scared and because they're losing money. And it's also because they were only here because they could make money. And now that we're in an environment where we can't we lose all our users if fundamentally we can only have users when prices are going up. Yeah, that's definitely not a sustainable system.
00:12:38.256 - 00:12:52.146, Speaker B: And one of the things I like about the region web3 space is like people are kind of here a little bit intrinsically. You have to want to build it for that reason. And so the region web3 space, there's less capital, but there's not less action in the bear market this time around completely.
00:12:52.248 - 00:13:14.026, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's also what's great about the bear market is it does wipe out a lot of people, good and bad. But it also means that the people who stick around are the people who are the builders and the ones who are committed for ideological reasons rather than just pure financial speculation. Which is nice, but hopefully it means we can find a use case for others that isn't just pure financial speculation as well.
00:13:14.208 - 00:13:25.120, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I'm curious. Okay, so we covered jokedow, you're also associated with Calfund and Ecodow, so I'm wondering if we could cover those real quick.
00:13:26.530 - 00:14:38.166, Speaker A: Yeah, so Calfund is a Web three angels collective that I started where we're actually not a fund, we're not a Dow and we're not a cow, which are, I would say, the top three things that we tend to be mistaken for, especially the cow. Calf fund is a work in progress. I see it as kind of like a 20 year project in some ways. And it's really about being able to get a bunch of angels together who are all builders in the space and being able to collectively work together to source deals, share deals and invest. And what gets exciting about this, I think, is on the angel side where you have a bunch of angels who can benefit not only from sharing deals, but from each other's. Insight, right? Where now you have top devs as well as top UIUX people, top product people, top founders, top business minds, all very different backgrounds and very different parts of the space who can all share perspective and learn a lot from each other, which is good for investing, but it's also just fun as a social activity. And then for founders, they can just in one go meet a bunch of web3 builders who they can work with as well.
00:14:38.166 - 00:15:07.486, Speaker A: And part of my excitement about Dows is long term imagining a future where builders are the ones who are really owning a lot of the let's not call it equity, let's call it entities that they're associated with. I think this is in some rough way a very small first kind of step towards that is really thinking like, how can builders work together in order to really support each other and support each other's projects right, okay. Got it.
00:15:07.508 - 00:15:08.910, Speaker B: So that's Cal swap.
00:15:11.890 - 00:15:15.138, Speaker A: Alas calswap, I would be a good deal richer than I am.
00:15:15.224 - 00:15:16.100, Speaker B: Excuse me.
00:15:17.030 - 00:15:17.586, Speaker A: Got it.
00:15:17.608 - 00:15:19.570, Speaker B: And then so eco dow.
00:15:21.350 - 00:15:58.010, Speaker A: Yeah, so ECODA is the first I started. And so Ecodao is what I'm calling a pop up dao. I don't think I came up with this term. The idea of a pop up dow is like something that's really great with dows, which is that they can exist when they want to and they don't exist when they don't. If you are looking at building something that just needs sustainable revenue in order to keep itself afloat and it doesn't need to become a multibillion dollar business, it doesn't need to accrue massive revenue. It's just there for the sake of being able to sustain itself financially. I think that's actually a huge unlock for a lot of projects.
00:15:58.010 - 00:16:42.150, Speaker A: And so Eco is kind of like that. It's almost like a high school club in a way, where it's like a bunch of people who are passionate about a cause using crypto to make this thing financially sustainable without any sort of goal of this becoming a giant enterprise or anything like that. And so the way it works is we typically will sell NFTs from artists and then we split. So 50% goes to the artist, 25% goes to ecological causes, 25% goes to the dow, and the dow throws events. And the events can be like parties, listening experiences, et cetera, with that money. And what's really nice about this is the NFT becomes an access pass to go to these events. It becomes an access pass to join this community of other people who are ideologically aligned.
00:16:42.150 - 00:17:56.610, Speaker A: And if you want, it becomes a status symbol in a way of saying that you gave money to support these good causes. I was inspired by Moonshot Bots quite a bit for this, for what it's worth, was a huge inspiration in coming up with Ecodow. And I think part of my thought was, like, right now, donations, the way the donations are done is you give money to the rainforest and it's tax deductible, but fundamentally that's money that's coming out of your wallet that you're not going to get back. And NFTs for me, were really exciting by the idea of like, well, what if you bought an NFT because you could always resell it later? Maybe then if your money is going towards the rainforest, you're going to be willing to put in 1020 times as much money as you would have otherwise, because this is money you could actually get back, right? This is money that might, in your mind, constitute an investment of some kind, or at least just maybe it doesn't make any money, but it breaks even. Or even if it loses money, you lose 50%, but you don't lose 100%. And so all of that just makes NFTs as a fundraising model a lot more exciting than I think traditional donations and so that was really the impetus for it. We've done three events over the past year currently.
00:17:56.610 - 00:18:01.590, Speaker A: This is Alpha planning another one for East Denver as well that we're really excited by.
00:18:01.740 - 00:18:23.950, Speaker B: Yeah, well, thanks for your kind words about moonshot bots. That was, of course, an NFT that Austin and I launched that was designed to fund public goods. So basically you bought the NFT, you got public goods. And it's neat to see the sort of like genetic or I guess memetic cross pollination between the two projects. And David, I really appreciate that you still have your moonshot bot as your profile picture on Twitter.
00:18:24.370 - 00:18:42.142, Speaker A: I think I will always have my moonshot bot as my VFP. It's my favorite piece of crypto. Is that a term that I own? And so, yeah, I love that project so much and I love repping it and having this association with this terribly, really quite badly drawn robot.
00:18:42.206 - 00:18:46.050, Speaker B: It's an eight bit pixel robot. It's good for an eight bit pixel robot.
00:18:46.390 - 00:18:49.366, Speaker A: Yeah, there you go. For eight bots is pretty fun.
00:18:49.388 - 00:19:07.420, Speaker B: Little anecdote on tokenization is that the moonshot bots were live on the Gitcoin Avatar Builder for about a year and a half and people didn't care at all. And then you make them into an NFT and you put them on OpenSea and then you raise $3 million for public goods. So crypto is weird, man.
00:19:08.750 - 00:19:09.450, Speaker A: Well done.
00:19:09.520 - 00:19:32.210, Speaker B: Yeah, well, same to you. I mean, I think, David, you're such a prolific dow creator. I mean, calfone ecodao joke dow. It seems like you're really kind of breath. First launching things, taking them from zero to one, and then doubling down on them, building communities. That's the thread that I would draw through all three of the projects that you just told me about. But I'm curious how you would draw the thread between everything that you've been involved in.
00:19:32.210 - 00:19:34.580, Speaker B: Maybe those three projects are just a start.
00:19:36.150 - 00:20:02.522, Speaker A: Yeah, I do think that lowering the barriers to experimentation is one of the greatest things we can do in this space. If you can allow a bunch of people to each put in like 0.1 E and then decide what they want to put cause they put you know, what what cause they want to put that towards, and maybe that's a donation. Right. They're deciding we're all going to donate together and we're going to maximize our impact by pulling capital. But maybe it's like they want to start a company or they want to launch something. That's a fundamental use case for jokedow, obviously.
00:20:02.522 - 00:21:04.350, Speaker A: Right. But it's also just like, I think a fundamental thing that I'm excited by, which is like letting anybody participate in these systems very low friction and being able to pull capital in ways that can be really meaningful. And so I do think, yeah, experimentation is kind of the best thing that we can be doing right now. I do subscribe to that school of thought that dows operate almost as like almost as a system of biodiversity, right? That each one can be forked, can build a new species, many of those will be mutants and die, other ones will thrive. The idea that evolution is like a better version is absolutely not true. The way evolution works is by creating an ecosystem of different creatures that all support and sustain each other, right? And so real evolution is about creating, maximizing diversity and experimenting as much as possible to have different projects that can support each other, that might not even survive on their own. They might need each other to survive right, as well.
00:21:04.350 - 00:21:50.810, Speaker A: And I think that's where forkability but also composability gets really exciting with Das being able to work together. And so yeah, being able to experiment freely I think is important. I definitely see my calling at this point is very much the Joke first and very much focused on building out these contests as I think these primitives for communities to be formed and to build relationships with each other and to generate actual sustainable revenue in a way that hasn't been done before. But one thing I'll mention that I think is really exciting is within the Joke Universe there's this thing called the Joke Race Council where every week people play the Joke Race, they vote on their favorite jokes. The winner is number two. It's minted as an NFT. The NFT holders join this thing called the Joke Race Council.
00:21:50.810 - 00:22:29.946, Speaker A: And also this is another moonshot bots inspiration. It's really devoted to public goods funding. It's built up a treasury of about 15 ETH so far from sales. And Chihad and LDF are going to be taking this over now and are going to start deploying that capital towards just the craziest wildest experimentation possible. And that's really the point is to say can we build out this universe by having a micro incubator for experimental projects that actually can give some utility to tokens as well? And so my focus is not on that. My focus is on contests. I have this vision of what I want to build there and why I'm excited by it.
00:22:29.946 - 00:23:02.406, Speaker A: But within that broader mandate of the community, there is this wonderful community that's building income and is going to be able to deploy it to all sorts of experiments. And I think that it's a really exciting model to see because I do think experimentation is absolutely at the core of what is exciting about crypto. It's the fact that if you want to start a new company in web Two, you had to start it from the ground up, right? You want to start something in web3, you just fork somebody else's code and you build on top of it. Lowering the barriers of experimentation is like fundamentally the great use case of this.
00:23:02.508 - 00:23:59.002, Speaker B: It's really interesting. I think that there's a lot of directions that we could go, but maybe setting a frame and just running on your evolutionary narrative there. I've been really inspired by this concept and thought from Aya Mayaguchi, the EF executive Director, that ethereum is like an infinite garden, and that you have this ecosystem of fauna and organisms and plants that are all growing on top of each other and sort of developing in symbiosis with each other. Gitcoin to jokedao to Calfun to ETH Global to uniswap. And because they're all modular components, they all do one thing and do them well. They each occupy an ecosystem niche, and then they interoperate with each other to create an ecosystem that's super modular, that's greater than the sum of its parts would be individually if you just added them up. One plus one equals three.
00:23:59.002 - 00:24:32.446, Speaker B: And so setting the frame of this evolutionary narrative in this infinite garden is kind of how I see these things sort of codependent on each other, interrelating with each other. And the interdependence of them becomes really interesting as they evolve over time. Like Joe Lubin said, it doesn't take a killer app, it takes a killer. I think I think that it's with that frame that I would want to continue the episode and talk about how these things all relate to each other and how your projects are evolving.
00:24:32.558 - 00:25:12.880, Speaker A: Yeah, I love that. I make no secret of the ways that these projects have taken inspiration nowens has been an incredible inspiration for everything I think we're doing with Joke right now. And Gitcoin. It's like we used Gitcoin grant rounds to be able to raise our funds for Ecodao, right? Initially, we wouldn't exist without these projects in terms of the inspiration that they've been ideologically, but we also wouldn't exist without a lot of them, practically just like the tools there to have micro, incubators, et cetera, which is in some ways what I think Gitcoin is have just been immensely powerful for us. Yeah, well.
00:25:15.250 - 00:25:42.940, Speaker B: Likewise. Same to you. I don't know whether Gitcoin is planning on doing it or not, but I know that they were kicking around when I was there playing with Jokedao in order to do some collective intelligence things for grandscating and fraud defense and stuff like that. So it'd be neat to see the tools further interoperate. I like the idea that your protocol supports someone early, and then they come back and they support you as you're building out your ecosystem. That's what it means to be in the infinite garden together.
00:25:43.390 - 00:26:26.914, Speaker A: I think so. I think one thing I'd like to see more of with these kind of incubators is if you're a decentralized brand, I think this is a question that kind of plagues NFT projects. You're a decentralized brand. How are you giving, quote unquote, equity to the people who build you out? And this has been a massive problem for NFT projects, right? Because their holders are rich people who can afford a lot of money to buy a digital collectible and a JPEG. And then those. Are not the people who are incentivized to actually build. So then you need to go get people to actually build out the value of your brand, right? But who are those people? Nouns found a really good model for this, which is recurring contests with a collective financing, right? Like board apes.
00:26:26.914 - 00:27:30.294, Speaker A: It's like every individual owner just owns rights to their individual ape, but there's no collective financing from all the ape holders coming together and sharing financing towards the project as a whole. Now, I think was really kind of like a ten X for me. Ten X improvement on this by letting everybody collectively deploy capital. But I think the question still is there, which is like, okay, builders maybe now are getting paid, but are they getting, quote unquote, equity? Are they getting upside in the brand that they're creating? And it's like, if the NFTs are only held by the richest people, then how are the builders actually getting some sort of upside here as well? I think it's just a question that kind of still plagues the ecosystem and there hasn't been a really great answer for, but something I'm increasingly spending, I would say, a lot of time thinking about, which is like how are we really giving builders proper incentive to be part of these brands and to help build them out and to be part of those communities? And what does it mean to bring people in, give them tokens and give them upside in that way as well? Because I think that really feels like the next generation of what's going to be promising.
00:27:30.422 - 00:28:20.374, Speaker B: Well, two points I want to make there. One is that I envision in my mind's eye this sort of dow of dows in which there's a mesh network of governance, tokens and projects that all rise together. And as opposed to the old world where they compete with each other for market share by elbowing each other out, rising and falling together. It seems really exciting. Like if each of these projects did token swaps with each other, then they would rise and fall together. And then the second thing that I'll put out there before I volume it back to you is this idea of I learned this from Gregory Landua, who's a past guest of the podcast, but this idea of keystone species, which are basically species upon which entire ecosystems rely on. So on Earth then, humans are a keystone species because we have dogs and corn and apples and all these rodents in New York depend on humans.
00:28:20.422 - 00:28:20.586, Speaker A: Right.
00:28:20.608 - 00:29:04.140, Speaker B: So in crypto, in the infinite garden. What are the keystone species? And I want to say that Uniswap is likely a keystone species because it's where everyone goes to get liquidity to trade token X for token. Y, I do think that right now there's a battle to see who's going to be the keystone species of L two S. What's the DNA that's going to go in all these different L, two S and App chains that people are going to launch. But nouns, because you were excited about nouns, it just feels like one consistent through Fair is like nouns created this punctuated equilibrium and this ecosystem that really is healthy and regenerative around them. And so I just wanted to call out this idea of keystone species and also dow of DAOs before I volume it back to you.
00:29:05.630 - 00:29:33.038, Speaker A: Yeah, I love that idea. I would say every species a keystone species in some ways. You look at parasites, it's just incredible how they have to imitate three different species behaviors a lot of times or understand that at some level to evolve. But yeah, I don't know. A creature I think a lot about is the tepier. Tepir is one of my favorite animals, and they're gorgeous creatures. They marched through the jungles and the rainforest.
00:29:33.038 - 00:30:11.630, Speaker A: And fundamentally, their job in the ecosystem is to eat berries and shit out berries. And because tepiers eat berries and shit out berries, they are responsible for propagating all of the fruits, plant life of the jungle. And so if you ever got rid of the tapir, the rainforest would be in pretty deadly state, because the tapir is effectively distributing is a distributor right. Of plants all around because it shits out berries. And it's like, yeah. Who's shitting out berries in crypto, I think, is a great question to ask. I would say Gitcoin is a great berry shitter.
00:30:11.630 - 00:30:14.638, Speaker A: Right at the top of the marketing.
00:30:14.654 - 00:30:18.450, Speaker B: Team, we've got a new testimonial that no one will understand without the context.
00:30:21.830 - 00:30:49.690, Speaker A: Making this up as I go. Yeah. Who's redistributing everyone else's work in this meaningful way and to let it thrive, propagate regrow in new environments. That's so powerful. The point about composability, I think about that so much because it's like a lot of, I think the unlock for I don't think I'm giving away anything here. A lot of the unlock for what we're really building with joke is the idea that you make decisions and they can be executed on chain. Right.
00:30:49.690 - 00:31:18.466, Speaker A: And so, because it's on chain governance, effectively, if you say, hey, who should join our multi SIG, you can automatically then have that person added to your Gnosis safe. Right. Are you safe now? It's no longer gnosis. If you want to say, like, who should be secretary, you can automatically mint them like a badge. It could be like a PKP three lit where it's like that gives you access rights to dropbox, that gives you access rights to Google Drive to your email, et cetera, right through an NFT, and that's automatically given to them. And so it's like onboarding. Totally done.
00:31:18.466 - 00:32:08.770, Speaker A: If you want to say, what cause do we want to raise money? Know, pull capital, send it to a juice box, let everyone raise money for it. Right? What NFT collection we want to buy, let them go. You know, turns into a party, like our ability to succeed I think is ultimately as a protocol in which people will build on top of us and we can integrate those services internally so that any decision you make can automatically be executed across all these other services. And all that is what my co founder Sean would say is taking advantage of blockchains is open APIs. But it means that you build a company in a totally different way than you would build a company in Web Two. Because in web Two you would not want to prioritize integrations, right? That would not be the first thing you would want to do. You would want to probably compete or be able to build those in house and internally and anything that's sending people away from your site is considered deadly.
00:32:08.770 - 00:33:02.502, Speaker A: But in Web Three it's the opposite because if we can support all those other projects in the ecosystem through voting and we are now driving users to all those other services, they're also probably going to be incentivized to send to us. Maybe we can share revenue potentially and you can create this composable ecosystem where we are each other's moat. We are all supporting one another in this open ecosystem because we all are sharing users and providing integrated services and it's just a totally different way of building a company than you would ever want to build a company in web Two where everything is siloed completely. And so it's an interesting thing because I think even when you talk to people in the space, a lot of people who come from web two I mean, you and I both come from web two, but I think a lot of people who come from web two don't quite understand just how powerful integrations are as a business development tool. Because it's not true in web two. They're not great VD tools in Web Two, but in Web Three they're the most powerful mode that you can probably create.
00:33:02.636 - 00:33:25.520, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I do think that a lot of these things are really powerful and really compelling. The critique I get from the outsiders is okay, but you all are supporting each other. Crypto is just this insular thing that looks inwards and builds for crypto. Yeah, that's one way to put it. And I guess.
00:33:27.650 - 00:33:28.606, Speaker A: My reaction to that.
00:33:28.628 - 00:34:10.700, Speaker B: Is like okay, there needs to be things that actually produce value for everyday people and that create value out of this infrastructure and there's going to be sort of a network effect between building infrastructure for crypto and crypto being able to provide value for the world. So I don't know if you know what those fundamental value drivers will be, but for me it feels like reinventing financial infrastructure that people depend on loans, insurance, jobs, public goods, infrastructure funding. Art funding is one that I didn't expect in the last cycle. And those are all things that fundamentally help everyday humans, regardless of whether or not they're in crypto or not. I don't know if you have any reaction to that, right?
00:34:11.630 - 00:35:30.994, Speaker A: Yeah, I think there's two ways to look at it. One is what are people willing to pay for? People are willing to pay for financial opportunity, and that fundamentally is at the heart of crypto. Financial opportunity, call it speculation, call it whatever you want needs to be incorporated. But I think social incentives, right, like the ability to join meaningful communities and take part in meaningful action is something people pay for. And we see that this is why creators will pay to be able to submit their film stole film festival or submit their remix to be considered by the DJ that they remixed creator communities, things that people are willing to pay for are still a massive unlock for this space. But we just haven't created what I would call like two way revenue flows where people are paying in in order to get out something that isn't just money, but is also social and reputational as well. So I think that's one answer I do think at a deeper level, right? Like, what are we doing here if there isn't actual real world use cases? Something I've been thinking about a lot recently is like, if you think about 2017, the really big use cases that everyone was talking about in 2017 for crypto in my memory were it was prediction markets, right? This idea that auger you'd be able to predict who would be president, right? And then there was supply chains.
00:35:30.994 - 00:36:18.558, Speaker A: Like you'd be able to track exactly a piece of corn on the blockchain throughout this entire journey to know that it was organic, it was harvested by farmers, they were paid fairly, and then you could disintermediate all of these other tracking devices and tools just to be able to directly buy corn from farmers and be able to verify that this is organic sustainable. And it's good. And I remember these being really big use cases, right? Supply chains and prediction markets both totally flopped. It was way too early for either one of those. It didn't really work. And what's interesting is those didn't make a comeback, right? In 2020, 2021, the use cases for crypto that people are excited by were not those because prediction markets, supply chains are like real world use cases. It's about applying crypto to the actual real world we live in.
00:36:18.558 - 00:36:36.058, Speaker A: The use cases that became really exciting in 2021 were crypto applied to crypto. And even today, this is still true, right? It's like yield farming is a really big one. Or like mev. Mev is awesome. I'm pro mev. I love that there's like, you can build revenue from mev. I'm really bullish on that whole space.
00:36:36.058 - 00:37:19.038, Speaker A: But mev matters because you are some ways indexing on the transactions that are going through a blockchain. And why are people transacting in the first place? They're not transacting for mev. They're transacting because there has to be some fundamental use case for them to be there. Right. And so I think in retrospect, when you think about how the narrative switched from 2017 to 2021, we went from talking about all these real world use cases that were just way too early and way too quicksodic, to talking about all these much more kind of ancillary use cases for crypto being used for crypto. It probably should have been assigned to us in retrospect, that that really wasn't going to be sustainable, that that was probably doomed to crash, and it didn't feel like it at the time. It felt like we were getting all this adoption artists and NFTs, et cetera.
00:37:19.038 - 00:37:30.358, Speaker A: But in retrospect, yeah, crypto does need to solve for something besides crypto, for all those other things like mev to be really useful. I think similar to the criticism I've.
00:37:30.374 - 00:37:56.260, Speaker B: Heard of Silicon Valley, which is like, Silicon Valley is only solving for Silicon Valley problems. Like, what do you do when your rent is sky high and you want to order groceries and have them delivered with tax rabbits and stuff like that? It's just kind of like a bubble. And I think that for crypto to truly have a positive effect on the world, it's got to provide utility for the median citizen of humanity, not just the people who are privileged enough to live in Silicon Valley or to have huge bags and stuff like that.
00:37:57.670 - 00:38:28.990, Speaker A: Yeah, like a worst case scenario is like axie, but a game that people would play if there was no financial speculation. Right, and then you add on the financial speculation on top of that. But that's the worst case scenario is what is a game people actually want to play. And the fact that we haven't come up with a single game in crypto yet that anyone actually wants to play, never mind supply chains and transforming the environment, it just shows you how far we have to go. And we really don't deserve a bull market until I think we start answering those questions totally.
00:38:29.490 - 00:39:09.178, Speaker B: Well, we only have ten minutes left, and there's a conversation that you and I had on Twitter that I wanted to briefly cover in the podcast, just because it's better to have nuanced conversations like this than it is on Twitter. And that was around civil resistance, which I know that I meme a lot about, and I think that you disagreed with me about civil resistance. So just to set the stage a little bit, civil resistance is basically sock puppet resistance. How do we go from one token, one vote systems, which are inherently plutocratic, to one human, one vote systems, which are more democratic? And I don't remember exactly what the disagreement that we had was about civil resistance, but do you recall oh, did.
00:39:09.184 - 00:39:10.330, Speaker A: I lose you, Kevin?
00:39:12.850 - 00:39:24.382, Speaker B: Okay, let's start from the top about civil resistance. We had a little connection issue right there. So what was the disagreement that we had about civil resistance? And let's get into that.
00:39:24.516 - 00:40:04.062, Speaker A: Yeah. I think that the disagreement was like over full civil resistance and what that would require. And so I think to have full civil resistance, you'd need to catalog probably every human on the planet. And that already carries with it a kind of frightening historical weight. Like the history of colonialism is. Cataloging humans and being able to put them on a publicly verifiable ledger that is tied to their finances, I think is both impossible to try to get everyone to do it. I think it's impractical, but I think it's also terrifying in its implications when that's mapped to biometric data.
00:40:04.062 - 00:40:45.514, Speaker A: And of course the response to this will be no, you're using ZK proofs and this can be effectively hidden unless there's a quantum computer. At some level. You are cataloging all humans in ways that any government effectively can take advantage of this kind of technology to track everybody completely. It's the next iteration of surveillance culture in a way that you really have no privacy and you're being tracked at all times. Some people will like this because it means it's a deterrent against crime. I personally find it terrifying, and I think it actually changes the way we psychologically interact with each other when we know we're being watched all the time as well. And so I think that kind of shit scares me a lot, and I think it's also impractical as well.
00:40:45.514 - 00:41:42.970, Speaker A: And so what I'm more interested in is something like civil disincentivization, which is to say, incentivize everybody to build up a single record on chain right, where the more that you've contributed to that single record as an identity, the more power you're getting as well. And so people really want to have one identity, essentially that is giving them power within systems and an accruing value to that identity that they have online. And then those can all be tracked and those can all be verified. We can see the history of everyone's transactions but just don't have it tied to someone's biometric body. Well, that's a tautology. Don't have it tied to their body. Fundamentally, I do think that the possibility of having anons people being able to operate without state surveillance, being able to do transactions where they're not going to be tracked down within the real world, is important to have.
00:41:42.970 - 00:42:07.734, Speaker A: It's important to be able to create our own systems free from state control and surveillance as well. And that's part of the reason I'm excited by this space. And so I worry that just the cost of full civil resistance is so great when you have lots you could do with civil disincentivization that would still lead people to maintain clear single identities online, but not have those be tethered to the real world ones either.
00:42:07.932 - 00:42:52.500, Speaker B: Got it. Yeah, I think that that's a fair critique. When we were first getting into studying civil resistance on the Green Pill podcast, we had Professor Brian Ford, who is a professor of computer science that's been studying civil resistance for almost 20 years now. I think 18 is the exact number. And he told us that there's four different ways of creating civil resistance. Biometric was one of them, web of Trust was another of them, presence based, which is basically like, you're in front of me, David, so I know that you're a person. And then the last one was like, nation state.
00:42:52.500 - 00:43:14.380, Speaker B: Basically. When I hear your critique and all of the weight that it carries, I think that it applies especially to Biometric. But also the nation state ID thing could be used in a pretty nefarious way if there weren't properly privacy safeguards and stuff like that. So yeah, what's your reaction to that piece of information?
00:43:14.990 - 00:43:18.060, Speaker A: Can you run through the four again? So what were the four?
00:43:18.430 - 00:43:24.206, Speaker B: Government ID, biometric, Web of Trust, and presence based, or a combination of those things?
00:43:24.388 - 00:43:41.470, Speaker A: Yeah, so three out of the four depend on a centralized source that is cataloging everyone and maintaining that, but one of them biometric, government ID, and Nation State. Right. These are all are depending on big entities.
00:43:42.230 - 00:43:48.630, Speaker B: So Web of Trust can be totally peer to peer. Like, I vouch for David, who vouches for Alice, who vouches for Bob.
00:43:49.530 - 00:43:57.094, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, that's where my mind was going to wait. So which one is that? It was government ID. Sorry. Oh, government ID is the biometric one. Yeah.
00:43:57.132 - 00:44:16.462, Speaker B: Government ID. No government ID. Sorry. Government ID, driver's license, passport, and then Biometric. And then a separate category is Web of Trust, and then a fourth category is presence based. Presence is just like, hey, I'm in the presence of David right now, so I know that he's a real person.
00:44:16.596 - 00:45:06.720, Speaker A: I think Web of Trust and Presence, maybe we could I'm sure Professor Brian Ford has a reason not to do this, but just hearing this initially, those to me link together as P to P outestations, and I think P to P outestations are great. And again, for me, that qualifies as civil disincentivization rather than resistance because it's not foolproof. You could have a conspiracy of a bunch of people who all support each other and all collude to try to give someone value. We see this on Twitter all the time, right? Like bots who talk up other bots in order to make them look legitimate. But fundamentally, that seems like a really good way of doing things because being able to have reputation as this currency that circulates among different people, I think is important, for sure. Yeah.
00:45:11.730 - 00:45:43.974, Speaker B: And I think that reputation for me is like one of these great power, great responsibility things. Because with reputation, our financial transactions, we can now not treat everyone as totally fungible with each other. And so we can start to have repeat interactions with positive Sum games on top of them. But there's also a lot of negative Sum surveillance implications of having reputation. So it's like one of these great power, great responsibility moments for me to be building any sort of reputation system, much less something like civil resistance.
00:45:44.102 - 00:46:32.042, Speaker A: There's also the fact that people change, and this almost feels controversial to say, where it's like we live in a culture that is very concerned with finding out who people really are and judging them by their worst actions, which fair. There's a lot of good reason to do that. A lot of people should be judged by their worst actions. But people change over time. And the possibility to reinvent yourself and to maybe carve out a new life, it's both very dangerous because you can let criminals create multiple criminal identities, and that might be the more likely thing that happens. But I do think it's important for people also to have forgiveness atonement grow out of the traumas that they were raised in. And so, yeah, having a single immutable source of identity for one person, it can be a mark of cane on them as well.
00:46:32.042 - 00:46:49.840, Speaker A: I think it's a harder question to answer, but I do think the optionality of be able to create a new identity is part of what's really promising and dangerous about the Internet. And it's in some ways what makes it great, in some ways what makes it really fraught and horrible at the same time.
00:46:50.290 - 00:46:58.866, Speaker B: Yeah, totally. Well, I know that we only have a few minutes left. I'm wondering if there's anything that I didn't ask you, David, that you want to say.
00:46:59.048 - 00:47:16.022, Speaker A: No, I think you've exhausted my larynx. No, I'm excited to been your project's been an inspiration for me for a long time, so it's just exciting to get to talk. Thanks, man.
00:47:16.076 - 00:47:22.360, Speaker B: Yeah. And same to you. It's fun to be in the infinite garden together. Where can people find you online?
00:47:23.530 - 00:47:35.840, Speaker A: Twitter at divine underscore economy. Substack, which is actually the better writing, hopefully David Phelps substock.com. Those are good places to reach me.
00:47:36.210 - 00:47:39.722, Speaker B: Okay. Amazing. All right, well, thanks so much, David.
00:47:39.866 - 00:47:40.330, Speaker A: My pleasure.
