00:00:00.090 - 00:00:02.734, Speaker A: After all, of 2022, why is crypto still inevitable to you?
00:00:02.772 - 00:00:43.330, Speaker B: Generation change. We kind of evolve one year at a time to a more digitally native generation. The second is just the influx of talent that we've seen this cycle. And the level of talent is at a significantly higher mark than we've seen in any cycle previous in terms of business talent, legal, technical. And then there's just dry powder, right? Like real dollars that are on these balance sheets for different projects. And then more than anything, you've got upticks in innovation and like, zero to one progress in DFI, in NFTs, in Dows, L2, scaling the ethereum merge and then stablecoins, which continue to have record months month over month. Right? So both the derivatives that sit on top of crypto rails and then many of the crypto primitives themselves have just continued to see pretty tremendous growth cycle over cycle.
