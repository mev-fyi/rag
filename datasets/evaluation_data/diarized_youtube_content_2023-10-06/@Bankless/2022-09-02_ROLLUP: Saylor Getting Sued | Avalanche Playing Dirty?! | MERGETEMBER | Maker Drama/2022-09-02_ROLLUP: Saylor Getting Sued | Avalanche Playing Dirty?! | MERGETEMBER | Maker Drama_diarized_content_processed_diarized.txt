00:00:00.250 - 00:00:03.690, Speaker A: And, David, before we get in, because it is Mergetober.
00:00:03.770 - 00:00:06.218, Speaker B: Mergetober. No. Merch. Merch. Timber.
00:00:06.314 - 00:00:08.714, Speaker A: Excuse me. Merch. Timber. Oh, did I just curse?
00:00:08.842 - 00:00:09.520, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:00:12.050 - 00:00:19.182, Speaker A: Hey, bankless nation, it is the first Friday of September. Or, David, should I say merge timber? Because that's what month it is.
00:00:19.316 - 00:00:21.374, Speaker B: It is the merge month, and that.
00:00:21.412 - 00:00:26.534, Speaker A: Means that all of the bankless episodes in September are called merge cast, not podcast. How'd you like that?
00:00:26.572 - 00:00:29.490, Speaker B: I did not know this. I did not know this about our podcast.
00:00:29.570 - 00:00:39.282, Speaker A: Ready for that? Anyway, guys, this is the weekly roll up. I said at this time, not David. What should people do when listening to the weekly roll up, David, what beverage should they be drinking?
00:00:39.346 - 00:00:51.710, Speaker B: Oh, of course, I'm not saying that everyone has to be drinking coffee, but it's the coffee that I drink when I listen to the weekly roll up every Friday morning, because sometimes I do actually listen to it. Catch up in the week in crypto.
00:00:52.050 - 00:00:53.370, Speaker A: The coffee that you drink.
00:00:53.450 - 00:00:54.478, Speaker B: Yeah, I think you meant to say.
00:00:54.484 - 00:00:58.154, Speaker A: It'S the beverage that you drink is coffee, but you said it's the coffee that you drink is a beverage.
00:00:58.282 - 00:00:59.786, Speaker B: Yes, that's what I meant. That's what I meant.
00:00:59.818 - 00:01:00.750, Speaker A: Yeah, same thing.
00:01:00.820 - 00:01:05.520, Speaker B: Sometimes I mix up trillions and billions. Sometimes I mix up beverage and coffee. You know how it goes.
00:01:06.390 - 00:01:19.474, Speaker A: Well, of course, if you are a weekly roll up fan, you will know that if you add anything to your coffee, David considers that a beverage no longer a coffee. The only real coffee is black coffee. That's what I learned from David.
00:01:19.522 - 00:01:24.610, Speaker B: Black coffee, espresso, water, and coffee. That's how it works. I don't write the rules.
00:01:24.690 - 00:01:30.522, Speaker A: No milk. All right, guys, we got some interesting topics this week. David, do you want to tease some of them up?
00:01:30.576 - 00:02:01.646, Speaker B: Yeah, we got some shenanigans going on this week. First off, avalanche playing dirty question mark. Using nation state legal systems to sue other alt layer ones in order to get ahead. Kind of just like taking a hack at your opponent's legs as you try and run a foot. Know, not totally, completely proven. So we'll go back on the details on that. But also, Michael Saylor getting sued in the District of Columbia for not paying taxes, perhaps creating a forced bitcoin seller.
00:02:01.646 - 00:02:20.534, Speaker B: We're going to cover that drama. And then also, Makerdao wants to DPeg Dai. No longer. $1 equals one die. Perhaps. At least these are the conversations going on in the makerdao discourse. We're going to summarize all this and more, but also, rather than all the negative stuff, there's also some positive stuff, of course, also happened this week.
00:02:20.534 - 00:02:22.714, Speaker B: Ryan, what were some of the good things that happened?
00:02:22.832 - 00:02:54.334, Speaker A: All right, you got the bad things, a few of the good things. Some highlights are a new liquid staking token eth staking token just launched on the scene and it's from one of the largest exchanges. I don't know if you guys can guess which one, but we will tell you in the rollup as it progresses. Also, a roll up itself just upgraded and made ethereum seven times bigger. That was the news this week. Starts with an a, won't tell you which one until we get into the episode. And then Facebook and Instagram just expanded their NFT offering.
00:02:54.334 - 00:03:19.590, Speaker A: So there's definitely a lot to talk about on the good side. And of course, if you like these roll ups, you're listening on your podcast player. Make sure you like it. Make sure you write us a review. Give us five stars if you think we are worthy of five stars. And then also if you're listening to this on YouTube watching it, I should say make sure you hit that subscribe button. And David, before we get in, because it is mergetober Merchtober.
00:03:19.670 - 00:03:21.238, Speaker B: No. Merch timber.
00:03:21.334 - 00:03:23.754, Speaker A: Excuse me? Merch timber. Oh, did I just curse?
00:03:23.882 - 00:03:28.926, Speaker B: Yeah, well, day one of September and we're already off to a bad start.
00:03:29.028 - 00:03:42.702, Speaker A: This might redeem me with listeners is, did you know you can go get a commemorative merge NFT badge collectible, I suppose I should say consensus is putting this out. What is the program that they're running, David?
00:03:42.766 - 00:04:03.354, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, they're doing a free NFT mint. It's going to be the first. I think this is a plan, the first NfT mint post merge, therefore the first naturally green Ethereum Nft mint. And so this is just an NF free NFT. There's no whitelist, there's no nothing. Everyone's available to mint one, one per transaction. And this is going to happen.
00:04:03.354 - 00:04:18.382, Speaker B: So you can sign up in the link in the show notes to get notified, of course, of when the merge actually happens. And then also a 72 hours mint window to celebrate the achievement of all the Ethereum core devs, client teams and researchers. So free NFT mint. Marking the merch. So cool.
00:04:18.516 - 00:04:22.078, Speaker A: This is a way to prove to your grandkids you were there, right?
00:04:22.164 - 00:04:24.618, Speaker B: Yes, I was here. I was present and counting.
00:04:24.634 - 00:04:36.898, Speaker A: I got my NFT to show it. You can find out more about that and make sure you sign up at bankless Cc consensus for some more details. All right, David, let's get to the markets, man. What is bitcoin doing this week?
00:04:37.064 - 00:04:49.158, Speaker B: Going down. It's going down. Ryan. Bitcoin started the week at $21,700. It went down 9.5% to where it is now at $19,600. We are below $20,000.
00:04:49.158 - 00:04:49.874, Speaker B: Oof.
00:04:50.002 - 00:04:52.822, Speaker A: That's just about double digits, man. That's a pretty steep drop.
00:04:52.886 - 00:04:55.254, Speaker B: Yeah, we're below 2017 all time highs.
00:04:55.382 - 00:04:59.958, Speaker A: Okay. And eth, is that showing us anything better because the merge is coming, David?
00:05:00.054 - 00:05:12.126, Speaker B: Yeah. The ether also down 10%. Start of the week at $17,010. Currently at $15,030. Down a little bit more than bitcoin. Yeah.
00:05:12.228 - 00:05:26.402, Speaker A: We're going to talk about this in a minute, but this feels awfully correlated to the Nasdaq and the stock market coming on the back of some of Powell's recent comments in Jackson hole as he gave them. We'll get to that in a minute. But how about the ratio? Is that giving us any signal?
00:05:26.546 - 00:05:50.182, Speaker B: Yeah, it did the same thing it did last week where it plummeted down to like 73.72, but it then recovered back to zero 78. So it's overall down 1.3% on the week. It started the week at zero 79, currently down to zero 78, but it hit 73 intra week and bounced back up. So still life in the ratio.
00:05:50.326 - 00:05:56.366, Speaker A: Still life in the ratio. How about global cryptocurrency market cap? Are we above a trillion still?
00:05:56.468 - 00:06:08.354, Speaker B: Barely. We are barely above a trillion. We started the week at 1.85 trillion and we are at 1.2 trillion. So $20 billion away from $1 trillion. No, wait.
00:06:08.392 - 00:06:09.026, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:06:09.208 - 00:06:10.850, Speaker B: $2 billion. $2 billion.
00:06:10.920 - 00:06:27.718, Speaker A: All right, so what is eth right now? So it is 1530 something. Okay. So it's still floating above the 2017 all time high, I guess, or 2018 all time high. I don't even know if people care about that number anymore. Do you think that's, like old news?
00:06:27.804 - 00:06:29.046, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm not sure.
00:06:29.228 - 00:06:40.154, Speaker A: Yeah, it feels kind of old news. All right, this is a prediction for the merge date, which, of course, we've explained is somewhat changing, ever changing. What is this showing us?
00:06:40.192 - 00:07:03.906, Speaker B: Yeah, so this is Bordel. WTF? And there was another merge predictor website that we showed last week that predicted the merge had moved up to early morning September, and it even flashed into late Tuesday. But that was one calculation. And here's Bordel. WTF? Which is a more conservative calculation. So this one moves a little bit slower as hash rate comes and goes. The merge date changes.
00:07:03.906 - 00:07:27.402, Speaker B: And so people don't really know. And so the calculation that we showed last week was pretty aggressive in how much it updates based off of recent hash power. The Bordel WTF site changes a little bit slower, and this one is still showing that we are going to likely merge around Thursday, noon UTC time, which is about 08:00 a.m. Eastern time. We will see.
00:07:27.456 - 00:07:34.846, Speaker A: All right, so what happens with the hash rate? How is that related to the merge date? Whether it's like sooner or later? Yeah.
00:07:34.868 - 00:07:51.682, Speaker B: So total terminal difficulty. This is that TTD number. It's a replacement for block height. And this is why the date hops around every now and then. We didn't choose a block, we chose a TTD. A total terminal difficulty. What the hell is TDD? You don't really need to know this.
00:07:51.682 - 00:08:17.830, Speaker B: Don't carve out space in your brain. This is really like the one time thing that's going to be relevant, but it's basically the raw number of hashes. So total number of hashes that goes into proof of work. Once the total number of hashes hits that TTD number of 5875, and then what looks like 20 zeros after that, I don't even know what number that is. A significantly large number. Then we merge. And so the more hash power there is, the more that miners come online and do proof of work mining.
00:08:17.830 - 00:08:32.670, Speaker B: The faster we grow the hashes, the faster we approach that TTD number. If miners drop off the network, then we approach that number slower. And so it's a function of how many miners are mining on Ethereum. And as that goes up, merge comes sooner. As it goes down, merge goes further away.
00:08:32.740 - 00:09:02.970, Speaker A: I wonder if we'll see any drop, because if we see some drop like hash rate go down as the Thursday of September 15, excuse me, march temper 15th approaches, then that could extend it into Friday. Personally, I'm hopeful hash rate goes down a little bit so that we get like two, three p. M. Or so in the afternoon. It's just nice and casual, right? We could just kick back and relax and this doesn't go super early into the wee hours.
00:09:03.040 - 00:09:05.610, Speaker B: I would like to have a margarita while the merge happens.
00:09:05.680 - 00:09:20.010, Speaker A: Yes, same. Just like afternoon, early evening. That would be so relaxing. But, yeah, there's nothing we could do. I guess we don't really know what the hash rate is going to do. Is there any reason to believe that miners might drop off as the merge gets closer?
00:09:20.170 - 00:09:38.566, Speaker B: It makes sense for miners to not come online as we get closer to the merge. So that makes sense to me. No one's investing in Ethereum proof of work now. That's too late. And so it only makes sense for it to stay the same or drop off. It's one of those things that there's a little bit of game theory behind this.
00:09:38.588 - 00:09:38.726, Speaker A: Right.
00:09:38.748 - 00:09:48.566, Speaker B: So if like 50% of miners the day before the merge, just like. All right, let's pack up shop. Well, then you're actually making it twice as profitable for the 50% of miners that stick around for that last remaining day.
00:09:48.668 - 00:09:49.174, Speaker A: Right.
00:09:49.292 - 00:10:05.020, Speaker B: And so I don't know, I kind of think if you will have a minor, the only reason why you would want to shut down your mining rigs is to sell your gpus before the rest of miners sell their gpus. But I don't really know how liquid the GPU market is or how relevant that is. I don't know.
00:10:05.870 - 00:10:11.678, Speaker A: It's probably likely that they'll just stay and continue to squeeze the remaining proof of work juice out of this.
00:10:11.844 - 00:10:13.850, Speaker B: Still extremely profitable to be a minor.
00:10:14.010 - 00:10:33.282, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, David, let's get to our Fed watch. That was our merge watch coming soon, man. Just next couple of weeks, of course, the merge, but the Fed watch. So as I said earlier, Jerome Powell was out in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. He gave a policy speech, and this sent markets tubbling. Here is a CNBC article.
00:10:33.282 - 00:11:06.594, Speaker A: Powell warns of some pain in quotes ahead as the Fed fights to bring down inflation. The Fed chairman Jerome Powell on Friday pledged. That's last Friday, that the central bank will use our tools forcefully to attack inflation. It's still running, and it's running near its highest level in more than 40 years. So he gave a speech. He said it would take some time. I think the TLDR of this is Powell is saying the Federal Reserve has to continue raising rates and even hold them at the higher level.
00:11:06.594 - 00:11:54.930, Speaker A: That's coming soon until at least inflation is under control. And that's at the cost of jobs, possibly. So unemployment could continue to rise. And Powell is saying he'll continue to be hawkish. So even though he's saying that, though, David, what's interesting is the market is still predicting that rate cuts will start around summer of next year, June of 2023, if you kind of look at what the market is pricing in. So today the Fed rate, the target rate is between two and a quarter to 2.5%. And the market is pricing a 70% chance that we increase by another 75 basis points September 21.
00:11:54.930 - 00:12:13.720, Speaker A: Right. So that would be the next time the Fed might increase rates. So Powell continuing to be hawkish. Of course, this sent markets for a tumble. The Nasdaq, the S and P and people are blaming this on the crypto dive as well. This is why ETH is down 10% on the week.
00:12:14.170 - 00:12:29.130, Speaker B: I think the other take I heard was that we had one month of inflation that didn't get higher, and then everyone was like, it's reversing over. It's over. And then people are like, wait, no, that was just like one month worth of data.
00:12:29.200 - 00:12:31.210, Speaker A: Like, we're still in a few more months.
00:12:31.280 - 00:12:31.898, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:12:32.064 - 00:12:47.950, Speaker A: And this is Powell playing kind of the bad cop and saying, yeah, we need more time. Inflation is not dead yet, and I will continue to try to squeeze it out of existence. This reminds me, though, David, next week we have Arthur Hayes on the podcast.
00:12:48.030 - 00:12:48.578, Speaker B: Oh, yeah.
00:12:48.664 - 00:12:53.906, Speaker A: And you ask him a really interesting question that I think you've asked a number of our macro guests and our.
00:12:53.928 - 00:12:56.278, Speaker B: Merge guests, trying to get the answer I want.
00:12:56.444 - 00:13:05.394, Speaker A: And that question is, which is more powerful in the trading world, in the price world, the merge or macro?
00:13:05.522 - 00:13:16.790, Speaker B: I've been asking this question so many times to so many people, and I finally got someone to give me the answer that I wanted. That becomes the bona fide correct answer, in my opinion.
00:13:16.870 - 00:13:26.862, Speaker A: I think we all know what answer you wanted, so we won't even say it. But tune into that episode. It's a special episode coming out on the Bankless podcast on Wednesday, YouTube on Wednesday of next week.
00:13:26.916 - 00:13:28.570, Speaker B: Wednesday, Arthur Hayes on bankless.
00:13:28.650 - 00:13:30.250, Speaker A: What do we got coming up next, David?
00:13:30.330 - 00:13:45.870, Speaker B: Oh, God. Avalanche playing dirty. Suing other blockchains. Blockchains suing blockchains. Is that even allowed? Apparently it is. Michael Saylor gonna have to sell bitcoin, not because he wants to, of course, but because he got in trouble with the law. Naughty, naughty.
00:13:45.870 - 00:14:10.378, Speaker B: And of course, makerdao. Dai drama. Is dai gonna de peg from Makerdao on purpose? So all of these stories and so much more after that are coming right after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible. The layer two era is upon us. Ethereum's layer two ecosystem is growing every day, and we need layer two bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer two life. Across is the fastest, cheapest, and most secure crosschain bridge. With across.
00:14:10.378 - 00:14:44.082, Speaker B: You don't have to worry about high fees or long wait times. Assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously. Across's bridges are powered by UMA's optimistic oracle to securely transfer tokens between layer two s and Ethereum across its critical ecosystem infrastructure and across v two has just launched. Their new version focuses on higher capital efficiency layer two to layer two transfers and a brand new chain with Polygon. All while prioritizing high security and low fees. You can be a part of across its story by joining their discord and using across for all of your layer two transferring needs. So go to across to quickly and securely bridge your assets.
00:14:44.082 - 00:15:23.346, Speaker B: Between Ethereum, optimism, Polygon, Arbitrum, or Boba networks, there is a brand new staking feature in the Ledger live app. Today, we all like staking the assets that we're bullish on. And now you can stake seven different coins inside the Ledger live app. Cosmos, Polkadot, Tron, Algorand, Pezos, Solana, and of course, Ethereum. With Ledger Live, you can take money from your bank account, buy your most bullish crypto asset, and stake that asset to its network all inside the Ledger live app through a partnership with Figment, Ledger also lets you choose which validator you want to stake your assets with. And Ledger is running its own validating nodes, offering a convenient way to participate in network validation. And it even comes with slashing insurance.
00:15:23.346 - 00:15:33.266, Speaker B: Ledger Live is truly becoming the battle station for the bankless world. So go download Ledger live. If you have a ledger already, you probably already have it and get started securely staking your crypto assets.
00:15:33.378 - 00:15:55.214, Speaker A: All right, guys, we are back with the first news item of this segment. Is Avalanche playing dirty? There's some drama in the space, maybe some legal things flying around. I got to be honest, David, with some of these stories coming out, I haven't been following them in depth because I guess maybe I'm at that point with, like, I just don't care that much.
00:15:55.332 - 00:16:13.186, Speaker B: Well, that makes sense coming from you because this is something strictly outside of crypto economics. This is like meat space lawyer stuff. And that's why this story is what it is, is because the claim is that Avalanche is playing a game outside of the game, and that's probably why you don't care.
00:16:13.288 - 00:16:19.320, Speaker A: Yeah. So catch me up what actually happened, and then maybe at the end, I'll tell you whether I care or not.
00:16:20.090 - 00:17:26.278, Speaker B: So this website, Cryptoleaks info. This is actually the first time I've ever discovered this website Cryptolaks info published a very long and with lots of content whistleblower article that is basically claiming that Ava Labs and this one lawyer law firm Roche Friedman, is suing, systemically suing as many different blockchains l ones as they can in order just to play dirty. And so, player number one, we have Ava Labs, the for profit company behind Avalanche, led by CEO Eman Gunseer, employs about 150 people player number two, Roche. Roche Friedman, a law firm that widely sues people in crypto, currently running 25 class action lawsuits, including finance, Avalab's competitor Salana definity and a few others. And it's being led by Kyle Roche, who's another big player in the story and employs about 30 lawyers. The claim here is that some years ago, Ava Labs and Roche Friedman made a deal, a pact that was formed that involved Ava Labs granting Roche Friedman. Roche Friedman, how do you pronounce this guy's name? Roch.
00:17:26.278 - 00:17:55.006, Speaker B: R-O-C-H-E Friedman. A massive quantity of Ava Labs stock and avalanche cryptocurrency. Avax, now worth hundreds of millions of dollars in its game for Roche Friedman agreeing to pursue a hidden purpose. And this is what this whistleblower crypto leaks info is claiming. What that hidden purpose is. Purpose number one, surreptitiously causing harm to competitors. If there are two horses competing in a race, you can hack at the leg of the other and the other one will win their horses.
00:17:55.006 - 00:18:56.866, Speaker B: Avax and Ava Labs doc and initiating a class action lawsuit against competitors can harm them in multiple ways. So they have secretly weaponized the legal system to do this, even when they only make a weak case, such that even with a high probability that they lose their own litigation, this can still cause harm to their targets, greatly profiting them in the long run. Moving the price of Avax by only a small amount by harming competitors can produce big gains for them while they make sales from their huge hoard of Avax tokens and Avalab stock. Basically the idea is that you go and sue your competitors and then they have to take resources to fight this class action lawsuit, whatever this litigation, in order to defend themselves. And so you only spend five to $10 million on trying to sue them, and they spend tens plus millions of dollars trying to defend themselves. And then the second purpose, luring regulators, including the SEC and CFTC, away from Ava labs. They often litigate against competitors in ways that make them look guilty of regulatory transgressions.
00:18:56.866 - 00:19:28.366, Speaker B: Directing the attentions of regulators towards competitors can cause further harm to them and also serves to lure regulators away from Ava labs and their ravenously commercial behavior, which regulators would otherwise be very interested in. Kyle tells that he litigates to create other magnets for regulators to go after, and they do this to crypto actors who are not obvious competitors, basically throwing other teams, organization companies under the bus to make sure that Ava Labs doesn't become a target of the SEC or CFTC.
00:19:28.558 - 00:20:09.594, Speaker A: Can I pause here and make sure I'm following so far. All right, so there's this website called Crypto leaks, and they claim to be a website that supports, like, whistleblowers. So if you see something skeevy and scammy and sketchy, you email them, you give them the evidence of the data and they'll report it on your behalf. Right. So what we have is a whole blog post full of maybe some evidence, looks like some video evidence of this dubious law firm, Roche. And the charge that basically Ava Labs gave this lawyer tokens and equity, and equity in exchange for him going after their competitors in kind of like, sleep.
00:20:09.722 - 00:20:12.426, Speaker B: Their model legal type ways, which is.
00:20:12.468 - 00:20:30.806, Speaker A: Just like suing them for kind of dubious reasons and costing them money, but then also drawing attention from regulators away from your entity, your organization, and towards the other entity. So this is the charge so far, is this correct?
00:20:30.908 - 00:20:31.126, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:20:31.148 - 00:20:34.120, Speaker A: And there's like, videos to support this?
00:20:34.570 - 00:21:04.340, Speaker B: Yeah, I've watched some of these videos. And it's a combination of these videos and this fact that this law firm does indeed own. It used to own over 1% of all Avax tokens and now owns less. But then also, we would assume it also goes with Avalabs capital as well. And so there's just like a lot of dots that all seem to line up to support these claims. Now, there is some skepticism to the legitimacy of this website that we're looking at in the first place. We'll get to that at the end.
00:21:04.340 - 00:21:45.218, Speaker B: But let's continue into this story. Why this works is kind of like an exploit of the american legal system using class actions in which class actions can claim to be representing groups of people who they claim to be harmed. So, like Roche Friedman says, I represent the token holders of Solana. And Solana is actually a legal security. And Solana went down in price. And so because I'm going to represent Solana Holders, I'm going to sue the Solana foundation regardless of whether Roch Friedman actually is a Solana holder or cares about Solana holders or actually believes the thing that he's saying. So, for example, they actually did file a lawsuit against the definity foundation, essentially parroting the false claims of Arkham intelligent.
00:21:45.218 - 00:22:14.514, Speaker B: I don't know who that is. The purpose is to damage the reputation of their targets and surround their brands in FUD. And so also importantly, once Roche Friedman goes into litigation against a target, one of their enemies, the so called, they can harvest and collect confidential information which they are using them using in legal discovery. And then they can pass that discovery phase information over to Ava Labs. So Ava labs can see what definity is doing. It's like an espionage or like spy stuff. It's ridiculous.
00:22:14.562 - 00:22:20.698, Speaker A: This is like corporate legal sleaze type stuff really going on.
00:22:20.784 - 00:22:21.580, Speaker B: Really is.
00:22:22.030 - 00:22:23.900, Speaker A: That's allegedly going on.
00:22:25.470 - 00:23:29.742, Speaker B: So last little bit here, Roche Reeman can spend a few million dollars litigating against an avalaps competitor and lose the case and still come out on top if their actions harm or suppress a blockchain that competes with avalanche, since their actions may drive the price of Avax significantly higher such that the size of their solings, they can make a substantial profit. And so Kyle Roche issued a response in his medium article that basically says that this is all fake. He says a posting on recently launched anonymous crypto Leaks website about me, my firm and Ava Labs contained numerous unsourced false statements and illegally obtained highly edited video clips that are not presented with accurate context. These videos were recorded without my consent during private meetings with Kristen Ager Hansen, whom I now know works for Dominic Williams, the creator of ICP token. And the defendant is a high profile securities fraud litigation my firm brought against him. Mr. Agar Hansen requested a meeting with me under false pretenses of venture capital investment in a technology startup, but his real motives are now clear to deceive and entrap me.
00:23:29.742 - 00:23:57.814, Speaker B: When I agreed to the meeting, I was unaware that Mr. Agar Hansen specializes what he calls conflict management for eccentric billionaires like Mr. Williams, where he uses illegal and underhanded means, including covert recordings and social engineering, to solve their legal issues. Basically, Kyle's saying, yeah, this framed. I was framed. Yeah, but also if you do watch the videos, yeah, I also, if I was, Kyle would not want those videos to go public. So we're not going to play these videos.
00:23:57.814 - 00:24:58.362, Speaker B: You can go link them into the show notes. Also, a tweet from Emmen of avalanche who says, how could anyone believe something so ridiculous as the conspiracy theory nonsense on crypto leaks? We would never engage in the unlawful, unethical, just plain wrong behavior claimed in these self serving videos into inflammatory articles. Our team and tech speak for themselves. There's also some interesting tweets cited by some people in the community below this one where Emin is retweeting one of Kyle Roche's lawsuit against tether and the manipulation of cryptocurrency prices. And then another one back in 2020. The Avalanche Twitter account and the Avalanche blog makes a tweet citing introducing the initial litigation offering bringing the $10 billion asset class of litigation financing to avalanche and retail investors for the first time again, another Roche Kyle Roche law firm, partnership with Ava Labs. So this partnership and this weird litigation fascination with Avalanche has a history.
00:24:58.362 - 00:25:22.174, Speaker B: And so that's one of these dots that are being played out. Here's Ari Paul's Ari David Paul, who is the CIO of Blocktower Capital, unrelated to all parties. So like kind of a neutral onlooker. And he is reading this case and his take is that I assume it's correct and it's as bad as this looks, fits with everything I've seen previously from both Surreyr and Roach. From a lawyer from Don Roach a few weeks ago. Dumb version of mob lawyers. Bottom of the barrel.
00:25:22.174 - 00:25:45.866, Speaker B: Oof. But then he also continues further down and says, I will say some credible lawyers at Ava Labs I respect. Tell me Roche's claims are false. They can't, won't share any evidence of that due to attorney client privilege. I don't know what evidence they could have. Absence of a private conversation, but I respect them enough to, a, believe they're not lying and b, remain open minded to see what evidence becomes. So.
00:25:45.866 - 00:26:01.818, Speaker B: And also this crypto leaks website is generally assumed by also neutral third party onlookers to be like a front for what. Yeah, yeah. So apparently the crypto leaks website is like something that the ICP.
00:26:01.914 - 00:26:24.934, Speaker A: So this is not like an open source, like anonymous, someone trusted from the just this also could be a large corporation behind this crypto leaks website. And these could be just two crypto networks battling it back and forth covertly. Yeah, dumb. This is just.
00:26:25.052 - 00:26:26.306, Speaker B: It is quite ridiculous.
00:26:26.338 - 00:26:35.334, Speaker A: Does this have a resolution in any ways? It just seems like back and forth. It seems sketchy on all sides. Concerned, possibly.
00:26:35.462 - 00:27:13.954, Speaker B: It's just like this is some bear market stuff. Lawyer ones start slinging mud at each other during the bear market. My take on this is that I was going down this rabbit hole to understand how to report on it. On it for this particular story that we're talking about right now and click on that link that I'm, quote, retweeting. Ryan, there's this guy that tweets out a couple screenshots from Twitter supporters and then this one Twitter account says this is their intention to just make fud. I believe avalanche and Eminen, as the father of blockchain, would never do such a thing. Their only goal is to prevent emergence of Avax.
00:27:13.954 - 00:27:38.894, Speaker B: But they are not and will not succeed. Fast forward to the next screenshot. Copy and paste the same thing. Fast forward to the next crypto Twitter account. Who's, like, supporting avalanche copy and paste the same thing. This text is a little bit different, but it says basically the same thing. This reminds me of this article I wrote back in late 2020 about avalanche and how they, this is verified true.
00:27:38.894 - 00:27:47.534, Speaker B: This is not like conspiracy would pay. Frog accounts. Frog crypto Twitter accounts in avax tokens for engagement on crypto Twitter.
00:27:47.582 - 00:27:56.642, Speaker A: Frog Twitter accounts are just like pseudo anonymous crypto accounts that tend to represent themselves as, like, frogs. And they seem like they're kind of bot controlled or robot controlled, right?
00:27:56.696 - 00:28:09.154, Speaker B: Yes, very like puppet. Like sock puppet Twitter accounts that put on both a pepe frog image but also with like an avalanche hat. And they're like, oh, I'm an avalanche supporter. But there's just fake engagement.
00:28:09.202 - 00:28:10.914, Speaker A: And then for social engineering purposes.
00:28:10.962 - 00:28:30.394, Speaker B: Social engineering, yeah. And we know this is true. There were chat rooms. And I wrote this story called on frogs back in 2020 when I was going my first war with the frogs of like, there's been like three now. And there was actually just like concerted telegram rooms where you would post your engagement. It's like, oh, I made a tweet about avalanche. Here's my tweet.
00:28:30.394 - 00:28:44.962, Speaker B: And then you would be given a tip in, it's like, we know that this, like, this culturally, in my opinion, is very aligned. They're willing to play dirty and they always. So allegedly, David, we don't know for sure.
00:28:45.016 - 00:29:18.794, Speaker A: But you know what? I got to say that the spidey sense that we've had about this sort of thing, and I think you've had, when you see these sock puppet accounts and it feels organized and it feels concerted and they're all chanting the same chant, probably. There have been like four times I've seen it at a fever pitch. One is like chain link back in 2019, 2020, and then that kind of died down. The other is avalanche, as you said. The other is Danny Sesta.
00:29:18.842 - 00:29:20.878, Speaker B: Yeah, he controlled the frogs for a.
00:29:20.884 - 00:29:45.462, Speaker A: While, too, and he was a frog puppeteer. And we all know how that ended earlier this year. And the other was kind of like the terra community and do Kwan. And this felt like a lot of sock puppet accounts again. And I'm not sure that totally was. But all of those communities, when you kind of dipped a toe in the water and you put forward arguments, something felt off. Something felt like not quite right.
00:29:45.462 - 00:29:54.394, Speaker A: Something felt rotten in those cases. And it turned out to be like, at least in two out of the four so far, things were kind of bad.
00:29:54.512 - 00:30:14.434, Speaker B: Yeah, right. There's like a deal with a devil that you make when you try and promote your blockchain and your asset without doing the things that you should be doing, which is straight up innovative protocol engineering. And you start shooting people in the hamstrings in order to get ahead.
00:30:14.632 - 00:30:35.190, Speaker A: Well, here's a call for everyone to get back to building and to stop with kind of the. And stop with kind of the legal shenanigans because we are sick. I'm sick. I think you are sick of talking about it in the roll ups. But that was a big thing making waves this week. So we had to cover it. What else we got, David?
00:30:35.690 - 00:31:24.050, Speaker B: God. Michael Saylor is getting sued for tax fraud. So the District of Columbia is suing Michael Saylor for over a hundred million dollars of unreported income or untaxed income that should have been paid to the District of Columbia. But Michael Saylor claimed to be living in Florida when he was actually living in his very large apartment in the District of Columbia. Michael Saylor and his company. Facing legal accusations that led to systemic tax fraud and penalties that could amount to more than $100 million. Attorney general for Washington DC said in a statement that Sailor has lived in the District of Columbia for more than a decade and has never paid local income taxes, despite earning hundreds of million dollars in cash and microstrategy equity options over that period.
00:31:24.050 - 00:32:14.070, Speaker B: And so there is an actual tweet out from the District of Columbia attorney general. Yes, saying today we are suing Michael Saylor, a billionaire tech executive that has lived in DC for more than a decade, but has never paid any DC income income for tax fraud. Blah, blah, blah. Sailor personally avoided more than $25 million of DC taxes by pretending to be a resident of other jurisdictions with significantly lower personal income taxes. Michael Strategy is also named as a defendant in this ryan, alleging that the firm conspired to help him evade taxes. I mean, since Michael Saylor is the controlling owner of MicroStrategy, he can just tell microstrategy that's how it's going to be. And then so a quote says Michael or Saylor is going to have to probably peel off some bitcoin depending on where that bitcoin is in, the eventual judgment comes down.
00:32:14.070 - 00:32:45.498, Speaker B: Almost nobody beats tax fraud fraud allegations. But we'll see. There's a nearly 130,000 bitcoins that Michael Strategy held as of June 30 and was purchased for an average price of $30,600 apiece. Bitcoin is now trading at below 20,000 by the close of New York stock trading hours on Wednesday. And microstrategy also reported a net loss of 1.1 billion due to the drop in BTC price. And still, Saylor, during the recent earnings call, says that the company would seek to continue acquiring and holding bitcoin long term with no eventual plans of selling.
00:32:45.498 - 00:32:59.560, Speaker B: And another quote from the article says, everyone knows he's long bitcoin. If bitcoin continues to decline, microstrategy stock could go down by another 30% and get absolutely hammered. And at what point can you turn around to your shareholders with a straight face and say that you are not selling? And.
00:33:02.970 - 00:33:29.230, Speaker A: Yeah, so I guess the summary is there could be some sell pressure on bitcoin, but of course, Michael Saylor's got to pay taxes. Yeah. This has to get settled in court. This is a prosecutor going after a defendant. I'm sure Saylor will bring a case forward and the courts will decide whether this indeed was tax fraud or not. Hard for me to like. I mean, definitely could have happened.
00:33:29.230 - 00:33:39.780, Speaker A: I could definitely see it happening. But also, in our system, we have to obviously presume innocence, and the court systems are the things that decide the outcome here.
00:33:42.070 - 00:34:17.262, Speaker B: Definitely presume innocence, of course. However, Michael Sailor, there's a quote from tier ten k that says TldR sailor pretend to live in Florida for taxes, but actually lived in DC. Frequent flexing on facebook, private jet flight logs, and talking about tax evasion on podcasts got him nabbed by the feds. So, yeah, sailor was known to talk about all the tax evasion tax that'll get you as a very public person. So there's always that rule that I like to live by, Ryan, is don't do more than one illegal thing at once. Otherwise you'll get now for them all.
00:34:17.316 - 00:34:26.542, Speaker A: That is now recorded on a podcast. David, you're happy to know that. Here's somebody replying to this tweet. Noted, if committing a crime, don't talk about it on podcast.
00:34:26.606 - 00:34:28.514, Speaker B: Talk about crimes on a podcast. Yeah.
00:34:28.632 - 00:34:39.698, Speaker A: All right, we'll try and apply this to my own life, what the poster says. Good lesson for us all there. Okay, maker drama. What is happening with maker drama?
00:34:39.714 - 00:34:40.422, Speaker B: Just keeps on coming.
00:34:40.476 - 00:35:39.446, Speaker A: Okay, so maker is a stablecoin. It is one to one, pegged with the dollar. Always has been, always will be, question mark. And this is what so my following of this, I haven't read this summary from Greg here, which we're about to get into, is Rune Christensen, one of the founders of Maker and kind of representative of a core cohort of maker is really spooked and really freaked out by the recent tornado cash OFAC sanction action. And he's worried that the current plan, which is backing Dai up by RWA's real world assets, which has really been the strategy of multi collateral dai, might not be resilient enough for nation state level attack that he seems to think is like on its way or imminent. And so is his answer to this. Again, David, I haven't read all the posts, I haven't gone into all the detail, is his answer to this.
00:35:39.446 - 00:35:55.742, Speaker A: We de peg from the dollar and so we no longer use the dollar as our unit of account and we start to become a free floating currency in order to get around this, maybe use different collateral assets that aren't as real world dependent. Is that what's going on?
00:35:55.876 - 00:36:44.720, Speaker B: Yeah, so we could read this like 38 tweet thread, which I think really does a fantastic job summarizing the complete of Maker Dow. Yeah, but ultimately ruin. Christensen just put forth what Greg Depreciio in his tweet thread calls a decently radical plan, such as dpegging Dai. And so Greg says Rune's latest plans are nothing short of radical to D peg Dai from the dollar and to push all core units and non crypto vaults into the theoretical contract of metados, which has been part of Rune's endgame plan for a long time. He has the support of fellow futurists and the decentralists, which Greg has put Makerdao's political parties into three camps. You got the futurist, the decentralist, and then the centrists. Maker or Rune was definitely in the futurist camp.
00:36:44.720 - 00:37:11.782, Speaker B: And people like Amin Soleimani and Chris Bleck have found themselves in the decentralist camp of get rid of all real old assets and anything that's potentially censorable, like USDC. And so Roon used to be a leader of the futurist camp, still is, but now has taken a large leaf out of the decentralist camp to Makerdao, more censorship resistant. So that's a quick TLDR of the state of Maker right now.
00:37:11.836 - 00:37:32.350, Speaker A: It's very strange that they've gone from lending funds to a Tesla subsidiary or something like this and lending funds to banks in Pennsylvania to a reaction from the community to say, let's get rid of real world assets entirely. Let's not even peg to the dollar.
00:37:33.330 - 00:37:37.534, Speaker B: Real world assets has been in Makerdao's core ethos since day one.
00:37:37.732 - 00:38:22.458, Speaker A: Yeah, right. Like that has been the whole shift to multiclateral, to die. And that shift, what rune was a key part of that shift. So it's very interesting to see this emerging. And for my part, I don't know which party you would kind of represent, like the futurists or the centralists or the decentralists. I probably always viewed a bit more towards the decentralist side of things, but also I was very glad that the multilateral Dai experiment was playing out. So I also very much valued kind of the centralists and the futurist approach that was taking, because other projects have taken the decentralist type approach where all of their collateral is just backed by ETH and they've de pegged.
00:38:22.458 - 00:38:42.020, Speaker A: Like Rye is an example of this, and that is a free floating asset that you can purchase right now. It tries to dampen the volatility of ETH, but is incredibly decentralized relative to Dai and the real world asset type strategy. So what's your take on this?
00:38:46.310 - 00:39:31.326, Speaker B: The reason why there's three political parties is for good reason. They all have justifiable grounds to support the thing that they is. I'm just like shooting from the hip here, but why don't we fork Makerdao and have the futurist Makerdao and the centrist maker Dao and the decentralist Makerdao, and each one can produce their own stablecoin. We'll have to sacrifice that net liquidity that we get from having one central stablecoin. But then we have the super decentralized dollar pegged dai stablecoin. We have the futurist dollar pegged Dai stablecoin that's based off of real world assets, that plays nice with nation states and makes them happy. And we can make a version of Makerdao that corresponds to each one of these ethos.
00:39:31.326 - 00:39:50.054, Speaker B: And I think there's also a world where we do that. And actually the MKR token is like the thing that's shared between all three of these models. You have the MKR governance token, but then you have three makerdao commercial banks that are governed by the same MKR token. That's like my quick take. I don't know how feasible that is.
00:39:50.252 - 00:39:58.086, Speaker A: I think that is an interesting take, and that indeed might be what happens. But you said it yourself, the sacrifice there is, you lose the shared liquidity.
00:39:58.118 - 00:40:17.490, Speaker B: Of Dai, which is. But I was talking to Kirk from Volt, from Volt protocol, and he's a big fan of, just like, we don't really get super robust stability until we have many stable coins. And so having many options is good. And so there's also synergies that happens as a result of that, too.
00:40:17.560 - 00:40:34.342, Speaker A: So you create all of these options and then maybe you kind of like tokenize those options together into kind of one basket, which becomes the stablecoin. Yeah, it's interesting. I do think all of these factions will play out to some extent, as they have already. David, what do we got coming up next?
00:40:34.476 - 00:41:00.206, Speaker B: Oh my gosh. Coming up next, new Liquid staked EtH token on the scene got another competitor to Lido's staked ETH and rocket pools r eth coming out from a big exchange. Wonder what exchange that is. And how a roll up just made Ethereum seven times bigger. That's a big number, seven ethereums. We also got Facebook and Instagram expanding their NFT offerings, which usually is like a big headline. And so we'll get into that as well.
00:41:00.206 - 00:41:24.994, Speaker B: But also, I think a really funny story. It's not that big of a headline, but a funny story. Crypto.com accidentally sends $10 million instead of $100 to an australian woman. Woman and Ryan, guess who's got a new house? The australian woman's got a new house. So all these stories and more after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible. Arbitram is an ethereum layer two scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use DFI and NFTs.
00:41:24.994 - 00:42:00.286, Speaker B: Some of the coolest new NFT collections have chosen arbitrum as their home, while DFI protocols continue to see increased liquidity and usage. You can now bridge straight into arbitrum from more than ten different exchanges, including finance, FTX, Huobi, and crypto.com. Once on Arbitrum, you'll enjoy fast transactions with cheap fees, allowing you to explore new frontiers of the crypto universe. New to Arbitrum. For a limited time, you can get arbitram nfts designed by the famous artists Ratwell and Sugoy for joining the Arbitrum Odyssey. The Odyssey is an eight week long event where you can play on chain activities and receive a free NFT as a reward. Find out more by visiting the discord at Discord GG Arbitrum.
00:42:00.286 - 00:42:33.626, Speaker B: You can also bridge your assets to Arbitram at Bridge Arbitram IO and access all of Arbitrum's apps at Portal Arbitram one in order to experience DFI and nfts the way it was always meant to be. Fast, cheap, secure, and fiction free. The Brave browser is the user first browser for the web three Internet with over 60 million monthly active users. And inside the Brave browser, you'll find the Brave wallet, the secure multitrain crypto wallet built right into the browser. Web three is freedom from big Tech and Wall street, more control and better privacy. But there's a weak point in web three. Your crypto wallet and most crypto wallets are browser extensions which can easily be spoofed.
00:42:33.626 - 00:43:01.346, Speaker B: But the brave wallet is different. No extensions are required, which gives brave browser an extra level of security versus other wallets. Brave Wallet is your secure passport for the possibilities of web three and supports multiple chains, including Ethereum and Salana. You can even buy crypto directly inside the wallet with ramp. And of course, you can store, send and swap your crypto assets, manage your nfts, and connect to other wallets and DFI apps. So whether you're new to crypto or you're a seasoned pro, it's time to ditch those risky extensions. And it's time to switch to the brave wallet.
00:43:01.346 - 00:43:05.478, Speaker B: Download Brave@brave.com slash bankless and click the wallet icon to get started.
00:43:05.564 - 00:43:25.886, Speaker A: Alright guys, we are back. A new liquid staking token is on the scene. That is staked eth, but liquid. So you can do all the things that you do with the staked Eth token that you do with eth itself. Coinbase is the one doing this right now, David, what are the details mean?
00:43:25.908 - 00:43:56.498, Speaker B: It's pretty straightforward. CBE alongside re from Rocketpool and staked st eth from lido, we now got CBE. I think this is the first significant staked ETH derivative token from a centralized exchange. So that also enters the world of DFI. Staked Eth derivative tokens in DfI. Now, coming from Coinbase, it is important to note that Coinbase charges a whopping 25% of your staking fees if you stake with Coinbase. And so if you buy this CBE and DfI, you're implicitly paying that percentage.
00:43:56.498 - 00:44:08.940, Speaker B: And so the yields on these things, there's going to be a yield war ride on these staked eth derivative tokens. Like who's going to be able to inject the most yield into their staked eth token? 25% fee on this one.
00:44:09.310 - 00:44:53.862, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. And here's a dune analytics board about this. So there is 654,000 CBE so far right now. So that is about billion in market cap. That's a ton. And so are you worried, David, that the centralized exchanges will come? Look, they are the liquidity engines of the entire market, because they have the gateway to fiat, unlike many of the rocket pool, doesn't have that. For example, are you worried that something like CBE is going to take from just using raw kind of liquidity power of its stake derivative token take from all of the decentralized options and from solo stakers.
00:44:54.006 - 00:45:36.114, Speaker B: I don't know. I do always believe that the Ethereum ecosystem has the natural antibodies to resist centralization like this. Dan Elitor, when he wrote this piece, the death of Ethereum, the deth of Ethereum, the delegated ETH, was predicting stuff like this would emerge eventually, and he was totally right. So it's actually kind of cool to be able to fast forward, like two, three years after he wrote that article. Like, oh, here we are. I mean, the 25% fee versus Lido's 10% and rocket pool's 15%, that's got to mitigate that somehow. And also, if rocket pool had a bug and we lost all the eth, that's a protocol.
00:45:36.114 - 00:45:58.394, Speaker B: So no one's really coming to save you if that eth gets locked. If Coinbase has a bug and depositors lose their ETH, I bet you Coinbase is going to figure out how to pay back that lost funds. And so there's probably some implied insurance mechanisms based into some of these centralized ones that are pretty compelling. I don't really know, but I'm happy to see there's more competition on the market, per usual.
00:45:58.522 - 00:46:49.914, Speaker A: Yeah, so am. I'm happy to see the competition. Part of me wonders if we won't just have another lesson to learn in crypto. Like some of these centralized derivative staking tokens will become very big, and then at one point, something bad will happen. We talked about some of the bad scenarios in our episode with Justin Drake earlier this week, right? So maybe there's a social slashing type event, maybe one of these, the staking of this exchange goes down, maybe they start censoring transactions, maybe they straight up lose their keys. Right? Not your keys, not your crypto. Right? So any CBE that you're purchasing, essentially the backing of that eth, it's an iou for an ETH that is held by Coinbase.
00:46:49.914 - 00:47:26.970, Speaker A: So it's not at all the same risk profile of an ETH. I guess all this to say, I think investors know holders will probably make the classic mistake of they'll look at the rewards and they'll look at the UX and the ease of use, but they'll forget about the risk side of the equation, because risk is very hard to measure. And there are a lot of risks that go hand in hand with using a centralized staking provider to stake your ETH. And the only time we really recognize the risks is when something like Celsius happens, or 3 hours capital, or like the terra Luna fiasco. And then we're like, oh, okay, this is why we need decentralization.
00:47:28.750 - 00:47:29.114, Speaker B: Thing.
00:47:29.152 - 00:47:58.166, Speaker A: I forgot that is my worry. But I do think over, like over the long, long run, we'll have a good balance of centralized and decentralized staking providers. And I think that episode with Justin gave me more hope on that. Speaking of more hope, scalability on the way. We teased this a few times, but Ethereum just got a seven x upgrade. Okay, this is an episode we did earlier this week. Arbitram released Nitro, which their original arbitrum roll up.
00:47:58.166 - 00:48:12.074, Speaker A: Arbitrum one roll up was one eth worth of space capacity. You can think of it that way. And nitro, just seven x that. Now we get seven ethereums in nitro. David, how do they do that? And what's kind of the news they do that?
00:48:12.112 - 00:48:46.994, Speaker B: The way that we always make all transactions cheaper on blockchains is through compression, magic developer compression technology. That's like outside of my brain. But basically they went from one Ethereum worth of scale to seven ethereums. This is like a very rough way of explaining these things, but it's directionally correct. And basically that means that they figure out how to compress an arbitrum transaction, or a bundle of arbitrum transaction, seven times more previous versus previous. And so now there's just like a smaller per transaction footprint on the Ethereum layer one, which translates into cheaper gas costs on the arbitrum layer two.
00:48:47.032 - 00:49:09.706, Speaker A: Absolutely. And we did an episode, if you're looking for all the details behind that, we did an episode earlier this week that you can access on the bankless feed, of course. David, optimism, no slouch either. They are just hitting all time highs, I think, in their metric of gas used, that is block space used, compute, used on optimism as well. So it's not just arbitrum who's heating up optimism as well.
00:49:09.808 - 00:49:21.280, Speaker B: Yeah, all time high usage of optimism. I've said it a bajillion times before. You've said it too. All of the ingredients for a layer two summer. A layer two season is like here.
00:49:21.730 - 00:49:22.874, Speaker A: Can't say summer anymore.
00:49:22.922 - 00:49:23.546, Speaker B: Can't say summer.
00:49:23.578 - 00:49:24.642, Speaker A: Putting a timeline on it.
00:49:24.696 - 00:49:48.582, Speaker B: Yeah, well, no, summer is like growth period, it's like blossoming period. It's more of a, we're going into winter in the upper hemisphere, but we're going into summer in the bottom hemisphere. Crypto exists both in both hemispheres. Anyways. Optimism usage all time high arbitrum nitro on the scene. The arbitrum community is absolutely stoked about nitro. You can just feel it in the chat, in the YouTube chat.
00:49:48.582 - 00:49:54.140, Speaker B: And so the blossoming of layer twos continues to blossom once again.
00:49:55.150 - 00:50:01.862, Speaker A: There's a data giant. I don't know if you saw this, but a cloud data provider called Hertzner.
00:50:01.926 - 00:50:03.110, Speaker B: I believe, never heard of it before.
00:50:03.200 - 00:50:40.234, Speaker A: Yeah, I have not either, but apparently it's very large. They just banned all ethereum nodes, so you can no longer run an Ethereum node in the Herzner cloud. This is I guess like a mini Amazon web services or something like banning theorem nodes. And I guess they said not permitted using our products for any application related to mining, even remotely related is not permitted. Hertzner said in a message to its customers. Even if you just run one node, we consider it a violation of our terms of service. So they're taking a hard stance against anything crypto inside of their cloud.
00:50:40.234 - 00:50:55.982, Speaker A: I have no idea where that's coming from. Maybe they're worried about sanctions. David, I don't know the details, but I guess one take is good for decentralization. It'll get some of our nodes out of these cloud service providers. What's your take?
00:50:56.116 - 00:51:41.574, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't really think these stories mean much. I was doing a call with Coinbase, one of the education calls, and somebody asked this question about, is this bad? And this is also a conversation on Twitter. Is it bad that we have a ton of nodes in cloud infrastructure? And in my mind, if you host a node in a cloud infrastructure, it's the most meaningless kind of node possible. Why do we run nodes in the cloud? It's because the cloud gives you the easiest and cheapest computer. If you need to run a node, you can either go to the store, buy a computer, build a computer, host one yourself, and keep it up and running in your own apartment, or you can go to AWS and run a node there. It's always going to be easier to do it in the cloud, no matter what your cloud service provider is. But it's also therefore the most inconsequential.
00:51:41.574 - 00:52:22.534, Speaker B: So if it goes down, you either just go to another cloud server, or if all of cloud servers go down and they just outright ban all of Ethereum stuff, then you go and build your own node. And so it's the same concept of like water flows downhill and nodes will be spun up on the infrastructure that's easiest to spin them up on just to make development easier. But that doesn't actually mean, say, Ryan, there's about like 10,000 Ethereum nodes out there, maybe 20,000. Maybe we add on like 2000, 200,000 Ethereum nodes on AWS, that has no meaningful consequence on the direction of the Ethereum blockchain. That doesn't give Jeff Bezos any undue control. It just means we have a ton of nodes in AWS. Yeah.
00:52:22.572 - 00:52:24.746, Speaker A: And if he bans them all, we just route around him.
00:52:24.768 - 00:52:44.074, Speaker B: We just route around him. And if Jeff Bezos is like, oh, all of these nodes that are in AWS, I want them to listen to the OFAC chain of Ethereum. Well, those are meaningless nodes, because the more meaningful nodes are the ones that are run by individual community members that are just like inside of your own homes. Those are the more valuable versions of nodes.
00:52:44.122 - 00:53:12.730, Speaker A: And even if you went to the worst case scenario, where all the cloud providers together colluded, which is very improbable, they all colluded and they said, no ethereum inside of our cloud infrastructure, it would be a pain in the ass. It would be like a UX. It would slow down temporarily, it would slow us down. But then we'd route around, we'd use decentralized networks, we'd use ipfs, we'd use like, Bittorrent type p to p type technology, and the network would still continue until they relaxed their policies.
00:53:13.390 - 00:53:21.994, Speaker B: You can, of course, always go to ethereumnodes.com and see just a list of publicly available Ethereum nodes that you can hook into at any time that you.
00:53:22.112 - 00:53:50.530, Speaker A: Basically, I think, David, they'll be forced to reverse this kind of thing because the greatest defense that crypto has and will always have is the value it brings to the world, the utility. And so once that utility starts to kick in, then Hertzner is going to reverse their decision and be like, oh, we like nfTs. Oh, we have to run Ethereum nodes in order to have all of our customers who want NFT infrastructure. Okay, we've reversed that decision. I mean, that's how it happens.
00:53:50.600 - 00:54:00.710, Speaker B: That's my take on this is like somebody just saw, like, ofac Ethereum, and then they're like, are we exposed to this? And then they say, oh, we are exposed to this. You know what we should do? Ban Ethereum. And they put that much thought into it.
00:54:00.780 - 00:54:10.746, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Vitalik maybe put a lot of thought into the book that he is releasing. By the way, this book is on its way to my house. David, if you've got your copy, I.
00:54:10.768 - 00:54:11.626, Speaker B: Haven'T gotten my copy yet.
00:54:11.648 - 00:54:37.974, Speaker A: Now it's called proof of stake. This is Vitalik's. First book. I think this is like a rehash of many things that he's written. It's kind of co written with him and another writer who's taken some of his work. But I think Vitalik's goal here is to actually talk to kind of the philosophy of crypto and the blockchain, as he does so often on his blog, and not talk so much about kind of the price and other things. So I'm looking forward to getting this.
00:54:37.974 - 00:54:51.554, Speaker A: But he just released a digital copy, NfT copy, with all of the proceeds going to Gitcoin. I think there's been like 100 eth or something raised so far. Not sure what the latest is. It's great, but pretty impressive.
00:54:51.682 - 00:55:15.300, Speaker B: Yeah, we were making that joke the first time this was announced that all this ethereum merge thing is for Vitalik to be able to sell his book. It's a terrible, terrible joke. I did ask Vitalik, hey, Vitalik, you want to come on bankless? We can talk about your book. And he's like, well, the book is just like an aggregation of everything I've talked on bankless over the last like 15 episodes I've been on. But of course I'm still going to buy it. I'm not going to not buy Vitalik's book, obviously.
00:55:15.750 - 00:55:29.814, Speaker A: Instagram, David, Facebook and Instagram are allowing the posting of nfts. I think this is in some specific areas, but this is meta. Continuing progress on adoption of nfts. Any thoughts on this?
00:55:29.932 - 00:55:34.514, Speaker B: I still haven't seen usage of it inside my corner of Instagram.
00:55:34.642 - 00:55:37.960, Speaker A: They're just testing it with some select us creators. Right?
00:55:40.090 - 00:55:41.926, Speaker B: Wait until. Wait until the usage.
00:55:42.038 - 00:55:43.110, Speaker A: You're waiting for the usage?
00:55:43.190 - 00:55:44.486, Speaker B: Waiting for the usage.
00:55:44.678 - 00:55:50.742, Speaker A: This is what it looks like. I'm showing a screenshot here. Just sold an NFT. So this is an NFT. I guess, on Instagram.
00:55:50.806 - 00:55:55.306, Speaker B: All I really see is just like a bunch of surface area for NFT haters to hate more on nfts.
00:55:55.418 - 00:56:05.662, Speaker A: Wow, that's another subject. And it reminds me of our next link here, which is Reddit just launched their nfts, but notably the term NFT is not mentioned.
00:56:05.796 - 00:56:13.650, Speaker B: Yeah, smart. Well, so all of a sudden everyone loves nfts if we just stop calling them nfts.
00:56:14.150 - 00:56:35.180, Speaker A: Nfts have a very bad name at this point. They're almost like. I feel like they're like icos, where in 2017, except in a broader audience, because icos didn't get very broad. Right. But nfts went on, Jimmy Fallon went completely mainstream and now suddenly everyone hates them. Why do you think that is? Price?
00:56:36.110 - 00:57:08.726, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like that in group out group thing. Like, why are people spending $10,000 on a monkey instead of normal stuff? And also, just like, I will always say that when there is NFT hate, it's because we as an industry haven't created NFT. Either the NFT that that person wants specifically for them or the form factor isn't right. Like all of these free nfts or nfts that you naturally accrue in your gaming app that aren't labeled as nfts are going to win hearts and minds as soon as we figure out how to make those damn things because the.
00:57:08.748 - 00:57:32.800, Speaker A: Brand of NFT is down. Saw, speaking of Reddit, I saw a Reddit post and I just clicked in it because it was interesting. Title to me is what's the most annoying way to start a sentence? Was the prompt, right? And so all of the redditors replied with their response. And one of the most upvoted one was this. You start a sentence with this. As an NFT owner, I think that.
00:57:34.850 - 00:57:40.830, Speaker B: In the future the statement as an NFT owner is going to make very little sense because NFT is just a form factor.
00:57:42.050 - 00:57:46.782, Speaker A: Oh, my God. If you replied that in that thread, you would have been downvoted so hard.
00:57:46.836 - 00:57:53.470, Speaker B: David, there's a reason why I don't engage in, like, I don't try and defend nfts on Reddit, Ryan. I have better things to do with my, it's.
00:57:53.550 - 00:58:12.406, Speaker A: But I also think that some people are kind of rebelling or reacting to the way they've experienced nfts from NFT bros or influencers who've tried to show them things. And so this is all part of the visceral reaction. Let's do a show pass. Let's go to Ticketmaster.
00:58:12.438 - 00:58:45.214, Speaker B: What are they also using nfts in the flow blockchain to let event organizers issue nfts tied to tickets. Now, I do think this means that the nfts themselves are tickets, but they can also be other things as well, simply like just memorabilia or like a ticket stub or something just to commemorate the event. I was thinking about this, Ryan. Me definitely have been highly critical of flow as a blockchain because it's just like the ripple of nfts, highly centralized. But I actually don't hate this use case for the flow blockchain.
00:58:45.262 - 00:58:46.178, Speaker A: Neither do I, man.
00:58:46.264 - 00:58:47.710, Speaker B: I think this one is like, I.
00:58:47.720 - 00:58:51.320, Speaker A: Don'T even hate NBA top shots on flow. I don't hate any of it.
00:58:51.930 - 00:59:08.266, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's. Yeah, like assets like a cryptopunk or like a board ape need to be on Ethereum because those are very close to financial assets with a lot of capital. But blockchains host data now and foreign forever, and I'm not sure that I.
00:59:08.288 - 00:59:11.142, Speaker A: Don'T want information main net, Ethereum.
00:59:11.286 - 00:59:15.742, Speaker B: I don't think that makes a ton of sense. So this use case of flow does make sense to me.
00:59:15.876 - 00:59:58.486, Speaker A: I think these are great use cases for side chains and even chains like we're talking about arbitrum Nova, which don't use ethereum as a data availability layer and are far cheaper or even, I guess, like centralized databases. Right. I mean, that's kind of what this is. But at some level, though, at some point, you start to get where the chain itself is so centralized and so closed that it's just kind of like, why do it anyway? Why is the blockchain anyway? Why not just have a database? So I'm not sure where that line is, but it's a good point. Yeah, there's something there. All right. Do you remember the goose NFT? Yeah, the art blocks nft.
00:59:58.598 - 01:00:03.450, Speaker B: Yeah. That was sold for like $5.3 million, I think, to 3 hours capital.
01:00:03.610 - 01:00:10.426, Speaker A: Yes. And I think Suzu had the famous tweet. Our thesis is it looks like a goose.
01:00:10.538 - 01:00:12.762, Speaker B: No thesis is we like the goose.
01:00:12.826 - 01:00:13.562, Speaker A: We like the goose.
01:00:13.626 - 01:00:14.474, Speaker B: Yes, like the goose.
01:00:14.522 - 01:00:20.994, Speaker A: That's the exact quote. And it does look like a goose. Definitely looks like a goose. Everyone thought, genius. This is amazing. This is the future.
01:00:21.112 - 01:00:24.718, Speaker B: You know what that's worth? $5.5 million, because it looks like a goose.
01:00:24.814 - 01:00:31.362, Speaker A: Wow. I wonder what it's worth now. I guess the goose was just sold a year ago on the 27th.
01:00:31.426 - 01:00:32.450, Speaker B: Two, 3 hours capital.
01:00:32.530 - 01:00:37.750, Speaker A: Two, 3 hours capital. And now it's part of a bankruptcy liquidation process.
01:00:37.820 - 01:00:41.626, Speaker B: Some people are speculating that's actually going to go for more than $5.2 million.
01:00:41.648 - 01:00:42.442, Speaker A: Are you kidding me?
01:00:42.496 - 01:00:46.566, Speaker B: Yeah, just because of the story. I can't even. It's just like, instinctive.
01:00:46.598 - 01:00:47.606, Speaker A: Goose is legendary.
01:00:47.718 - 01:00:48.790, Speaker B: It's very legendary.
01:00:48.870 - 01:00:55.120, Speaker A: This is what the goose took. The trillion dollar hedge or the $20 billion hedge fund, down. The story.
01:00:56.850 - 01:01:01.726, Speaker B: The straw that broke three arrow. Capital's back. The goose that broke three errors. Capital's back.
01:01:01.828 - 01:01:05.782, Speaker A: Beautiful. See, now you're getting into it. You just made it more valuable. Good job, dude.
01:01:05.866 - 01:01:06.526, Speaker B: Totally.
01:01:06.638 - 01:01:46.682, Speaker A: In interesting news on the regulatory side, the FBI just issued a warning over vulnerable DFI platforms, and they outlined three specific attack vectors, and they cited the $1.3 billion in crypto that was stolen just the first quarter of this year. So this is the FBI, david, saying, guys, get your stuff together. You're making our jobs hard. And also, basically, America's enemies are taking this money. What percentage of GDP do you think North Korea made on crypto hacks last year? What percent of their GDP?
01:01:46.826 - 01:01:48.234, Speaker B: Minimum double digits.
01:01:48.362 - 01:01:54.820, Speaker A: Right. That's incredible. So you can understand, how does North Korea make money?
01:01:55.510 - 01:01:57.138, Speaker B: What's the north korean business model?
01:01:57.224 - 01:02:44.980, Speaker A: There is not much coming in. I mean, it's all kind of like materials, like physical materials and this sort of thing, right? Sadly, it's definitely not coming in from other sources. And so the FBI said, here are some attack vectors. DFI, you should watch out for flash loans. Watch out for those. And they name a project, project BZX, where thieves got $55 million, exploiting a vulnerability in DFI's and token bridges, such as the Nomad token bridge, or manipulating cryptocurrency prices by exploding oracles like this. Is the FBI getting to the details? They just described a flash loan attack, a bridge attack, and an oracle attack.
01:02:44.980 - 01:03:17.626, Speaker A: So I guess what I would say is I very much understand where the executive branch is coming from in these types of things because they're having to clean up, they're having to be the enforcement when things get stolen in the real world and go like, this is who the DeFi companies, the bridges got attacked. They're calling the FBI and saying, hey, can you help us? Guys? Like, criminals made off with our money. And FBI is like, what are you doing? You left the doors open. Yeah, get your stuff together.
01:03:17.728 - 01:03:39.554, Speaker B: This kind of goes back to our conversation of like, we need new Internet police, we need the white hat. It does sound scary. We need like, the white hat version of the Lazarus group. Like, oh, the Lazarus group just hacked that bridge. Well, we need the Lazarus undoers to go hack the Lazarus group to get our funds back. We need something like that.
01:03:39.672 - 01:03:45.086, Speaker A: Yeah. And we need Internet Avengers, more robust code as well. Internet Avengers.
01:03:45.118 - 01:03:47.958, Speaker B: Yeah, that sounds way sun would be on there. Yeah.
01:03:48.044 - 01:03:49.366, Speaker A: David, give us this story.
01:03:49.468 - 01:04:00.022, Speaker B: Oh, God, this is hilarious. Okay. The crypto.com $10.5 million accident. So crypto.com accidentally transferred $10.5
01:04:00.022 - 01:04:25.620, Speaker B: million to a woman instead of $100. The women user, customerofcrypto.com, asked for $100 refund, which they just happily refunded her, but they instead refunded her $10.5 million instead of $100. What happened was that they accidentally entered her account number into the payment field rather than the refund amount and then hit send. And, of course, irreversible blockchain transactions. This is how this happens.
01:04:25.620 - 01:04:40.290, Speaker B: And that was seven months ago. That happened seven months ago, and they didn't realize it. So for seven months, this lady received $10.5 million. And you know what she did with that money, Ryan?
01:04:40.370 - 01:04:43.526, Speaker A: I'm sure she gave it all back to crypto.com the moment she received it.
01:04:43.628 - 01:05:19.890, Speaker B: I'm sure she did not do that. So what she actually did was bought a 1.35,000,004 bedroom property in Melbourne and then smartly immediately transferred the ownership of that property to her own sister, who lives in Malaysia, which has made it extremely difficult for crypto.com to get their money back because she quickly bought a house and then transferred ownership of that house to somebody who's irrelevant. And so I'm sure this lady is going to get in trouble. I'm sorry. No, that's money.
01:05:19.890 - 01:05:29.922, Speaker B: It's not yours. Yeah, but she bought a house and gave it to someone, and so now they have to go undo that, which. That has to go to courts, and I don't really know how that's going to unfold.
01:05:29.986 - 01:05:38.860, Speaker A: A bank has made an error in your favor, collect $10.5 million and then go buy a mansion with it and give it to your sister. Wow.
01:05:41.630 - 01:06:14.850, Speaker B: That'S so funny. All right, quick rebrand in the orca protocol world. Orca protocol is now Metropolis, and they are opening up their pods for beta access. I did a layer zero with Julia Rosenberg about Orca now Metropolis, and about how Orca now Metropolis allows daos to become modular. So Ryan and I believe that the future of blockchains are modular blockchains. And I also believe that the future of daos are modular daos rather than monolithic Daos. And Metropolis Metropolis protocol is pioneering the future.
01:06:14.850 - 01:06:17.730, Speaker B: So they are now having a rebrand and they are open for beta.
01:06:17.810 - 01:06:32.794, Speaker A: Very cool. Metropolis. Like the city, I guess, cities, yeah. Moving on to raises, you know, proof. So this is Kevin Rose's initiative around the proof collective and the moonbirds community.
01:06:32.912 - 01:06:34.906, Speaker B: Yeah. The one that's behind your head right now?
01:06:34.928 - 01:07:00.500, Speaker A: Yes, the one that's behind my head right now. They just raised $50 million from a 16 z and many more. I feel like at some point in time, we're going to have to get caught up with Kevin Rose to see what they are doing with all of this funding. But I think they're going big on this stuff, creating an entire ecosystem, creating entirely new worlds around proof. And I'm pretty excited to see what they deliver, what they build.
01:07:01.510 - 01:07:27.018, Speaker B: Thank God we have Kevin Rose building out this frontier of what you can do in this corner of the web three universe. Like a real use case for NFC, knows what he real value because he knows what he's doing and he's putting all of his energy behind it. This isn't just like a side project he is intentfully building out. He's pioneering this frontier single handedly and I thank him for that service.
01:07:27.184 - 01:07:54.030, Speaker A: Totally good. All right, Reddit, do you know Alexis Ohanian? I guess now we just talked about dig, now we have to talk about Reddit. Alexis Ohanian, he just raised $177,000,000 crypto fund. So this is all going to crypto. The quote says now is potentially a unique opportunity to invest in strong founders at a discount. This is from Alexis Ohanian and their marketing material.
01:07:54.110 - 01:08:30.266, Speaker B: I love that he says, a unique opportunity to invest in strong founders at a discount. Because back at the top of the market in 2021, the favor was definitely in the hands of founders. And like which give me all of your money, vcs, because you're totally going to give it all to me. And now the tables have turned very much in favor of vcs with capital. And so that leads us into the next raise with Genesis raising $500 million. Galaxy and Genesis execs raise $500 million because power is in the hands of the vcs. And so there's still plenty of private money out there going into crypto startups.
01:08:30.298 - 01:09:10.406, Speaker A: Well, very good strategy, obviously, for vcs to raise during the bull market and then deploy during the bear market. And of course, that's a good strategy for you too, retail investor. Like if you're thinking about these markets, right, better to buy during the Dip or when things are quiet than buy the top. David, got to talk about jobs. This is our opportunity, your opportunity, I should say, if you're a listener to bankless to go get a job in crypto, we've got the jobs board here from bankless. I'm going to read out a few jobs. Number one from superform, a senior backend engineer, bit green, a full stack developer.
01:09:10.406 - 01:09:21.914, Speaker A: Oh, my God. David has life this time. A software engineer. Market data at Masari, another software engineer over media. Dydx, needs a backend. Software engineer, steakfish, an HR business partner.
01:09:21.962 - 01:09:22.910, Speaker B: What's that, David?
01:09:23.250 - 01:09:48.790, Speaker A: Backend engineer, full stack software engineer at Steakfish, a front end and a DevOps engineer at Steakfish too. Bankless needs somebody over media operations, doing podcasts and such. Boardroom Labs needs a software engineer over Dao governance. Go get a job in crypto. Now's your opportunity. We will include a link to the bankless job boards. You can subscribe to the job boards and get these delivered to you on a daily, weekly basis.
01:09:48.790 - 01:09:57.034, Speaker A: We will remind you every week as well, in the meanwhile, until you get a job in crypto. And then we'll continue to say it, won't we?
01:09:57.232 - 01:10:01.526, Speaker B: Yeah, we will get two jobs in crypto, start another podcast in crypto.
01:10:01.638 - 01:10:03.158, Speaker A: What do we got next, David?
01:10:03.334 - 01:10:14.670, Speaker B: Coming up next, questions from the nation. Lots of ETH staking questions. So if you have questions about e staking, maybe this is one of yours. And also an interesting question. What about bitcoin maxis? Do we agree?
01:10:14.820 - 01:10:15.418, Speaker A: Huh?
01:10:15.514 - 01:10:24.578, Speaker B: Yeah. And then, of course, following that, some hot takes from crypto Twitter. So stay tuned for all of that and more. But first, we're going to talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible.
01:10:24.664 - 01:10:40.042, Speaker A: All right, guys, we are back. As a reminder, if you have a question for Dave and myself, you can ask that question. Follow Bankless HQ. We tweet out a question every Wednesday. Reply to that tweet, get your question answered. This is the first one from Avigupta ETH. It's a staking question.
01:10:40.042 - 01:10:53.926, Speaker A: David, when I stake via all these providers like Lido finance and stakewise, who am I trusting my eth with? And can my ETH get slashed? David, who is Avi trusting when he is staking his ETH with Lido?
01:10:53.958 - 01:11:37.450, Speaker B: And so, you know, not your keys, not your crypto, and not your keys, not your validator. And so when you stake with Lido, you're staking the lido system, the Lido dow. And so your Eth in lido specifically goes into one of 24 validators, and also, I guess, gets commingled with all the other depositors. But say, for example, one of the lido validators, one of the 24 of them gets slashed holistically, like, they lose all of that ether. Then I guess lido becomes under collateralized by 120 4th stakewise. I'm sure they have a network of validators, too. But basically, you're giving up your rights as a validator, your ability to sign messages to whoever you trust.
01:11:37.450 - 01:12:04.814, Speaker B: So if you stake your ether with Coinbase, you're trusting Coinbase. If you're staking with ether with stakewise, you're trusting stakewise. If you stake your ether with rocket pool, you're trusting the rocket pool protocol. And so can your eth get slashed? It's like, well, that's up to the facts and circumstances of every single provider. Anyone can get slashed for all of the reasons that one would get slashed. It's definitely not something that is like accidental. Like you are either trying to attack Ethereum and you're double signing blocks and that'll get you slashed.
01:12:04.862 - 01:12:05.742, Speaker A: That's a big slash.
01:12:05.806 - 01:12:10.066, Speaker B: That's a big slash. You don't just accidentally do that. I think I'm going to accidentally.
01:12:10.258 - 01:12:15.638, Speaker A: If people misconfigure their networks badly enough, that's when it can happen. I've seen that happen.
01:12:15.724 - 01:12:17.602, Speaker B: But that's also extremely avoidable.
01:12:17.666 - 01:12:17.894, Speaker A: Right?
01:12:17.932 - 01:12:28.806, Speaker B: That's the idea of like you have a redundant computer to start signing messages if your first computer goes down. But the risk of that, the reward of that is not that much. It's just like minimizing none of these stackers.
01:12:28.998 - 01:12:33.230, Speaker A: Stakers would do that and they're all professionals. But it could happen. That's one risk.
01:12:34.050 - 01:12:49.582, Speaker B: And so yes, technically it can get slashed. It would probably be just negligence or just some crazy black swan accident by one of these stake providers, but technically you're out of control for that. I wouldn't be too worried about that risk.
01:12:49.646 - 01:13:15.206, Speaker A: One interesting slash condition, though, that Justin Drake mentioned on the call is kind of on our episode earlier this week, is kind of that idea of social slashing. So let's say a whole bunch of stakers that you were staking with decided to censor transactions, right? Well, then if the ethereum community kind of forked onto an uncensored version of Ethereum, you might want to withdraw your deposits from that staking pool.
01:13:15.398 - 01:13:17.050, Speaker B: But I think you would see that coming.
01:13:17.120 - 01:13:18.954, Speaker A: Yeah, you would see that so far away.
01:13:19.072 - 01:13:21.478, Speaker B: Yeah, you would hear of me in Russia.
01:13:21.494 - 01:13:28.800, Speaker A: Unless you were in a cave like you just left it there for a couple of years, that sort of thing. David, this next question is from eight.
01:13:30.370 - 01:13:32.080, Speaker B: You're going to pronounce that?
01:13:33.810 - 01:13:48.980, Speaker A: I tried eight. What would a home staker have to do, on a practical level to be slashed? I thought the recommended client software didn't censor by default and thus not be something to worry about. And are you solar stakers or plan to become question mark?
01:13:49.510 - 01:14:36.002, Speaker B: Yeah. So as a home staker, what do you have to do to get slashed? The most likely event is the one I talked about where you have your computer, you have your validator, and it's staking as it should, and then you want to get fancy with it and you want to have a redundant computer with the same signing keys as the active computer and you have it configured so that the active computer if the Internet cuts out or loses power or whatever, then the standby computer notices that the active computer is offline. And so then the standby computer goes online and starts signing messages to maintain zero downtime. The risk here is that the standby computer comes online and the active computer is actually still online for whatever reason. And then you have two computers signing with the same messages, and that will get you slashed. We've seen that happen before. There's definitely ways around this.
01:14:36.002 - 01:14:42.802, Speaker B: Look at DVT technology from oval and also just don't do it. Just take the penalty. Just take the leakage penalty.
01:14:42.866 - 01:14:45.206, Speaker A: The leakage penalty is so low, it.
01:14:45.228 - 01:15:11.914, Speaker B: Is equivalent to how much ether rewards you are making, but in the opposite direction, as opposed to getting slashed and getting penalized. Instead, you just make a negative amount of yield. And so just like, just take it. You're just like you set yourself back a day, two days. How long are you away from home? And it's not worth the extra risk. That's the most likely reason why you would get slashed. This asker says, I thought the recommended client software didn't censor by default.
01:15:11.914 - 01:15:32.850, Speaker B: Yes, all client software does not censor by default. You have to do something. You have to tinker with that client if you want to start censoring things, and that's going to be at an ad hoc basis. So yes, it's not something to worry about. Are we a solo staker or do we plan to become one? Bankless does stake. We stake with a friend of ours who is not located near us. They're in a different physical location.
01:15:32.850 - 01:15:41.080, Speaker B: So I guess we're not solo stakers because me and Ryan stake together with the help of a friend. I travel a lot and Ryan has kids that might kick over his computer.
01:15:42.730 - 01:16:05.258, Speaker A: I do actually plan to become a solar staker. David, though, on the other side of the merge, just like running a little bit from the house. I think that's important. I want to test it myself. Another question on staking from happy Joe at happy Joe asks, if I have 64 ETH, do I get more yield by staking two times 32 Eth or one times 64 ETH? What's at the root of this question? David?
01:16:05.354 - 01:16:25.270, Speaker B: Yeah, so actually there is no such thing as one times 64 ETH. There is only units, discrete units of 32 ether. So if you have 64 ETH, or validator. If you have 96 ether, you have three validators. You don't make one validator with multiples of 32. You just spin up two validators.
01:16:27.450 - 01:16:34.074, Speaker A: When David says two validators by the way, you can spin up many validators on the same machine. So he's not talking about like, oh.
01:16:34.112 - 01:16:36.822, Speaker B: You have one computer per validator. Could you imagine?
01:16:36.886 - 01:16:44.586, Speaker A: No. So you could have one computer, like my MacBook. My laptop could probably run, I don't know, hundreds of validators.
01:16:44.698 - 01:16:58.034, Speaker B: I think a raspberry PI is considered pretty damn safe to ten validators. So one raspberry PI can manage 320 e. Right. I think if you're on a MacBook Pro, like, yo, you can really juice that thing up.
01:16:58.072 - 01:17:08.454, Speaker A: I think people get confused about the 64 e because when you deposit, like a staking provider like Coinbase, it feels like, oh, I'm giving 64 eth into.
01:17:08.492 - 01:17:11.958, Speaker B: This thing, or twelve or arbitrary number.
01:17:12.044 - 01:17:24.042, Speaker A: Right. But behind the scenes, of course, Coinbase has to spin up as many validators as kind of divisible by 32. And their total amount of ETH divided by 32 is the number of validators they are running in the background. Correct.
01:17:24.096 - 01:17:36.862, Speaker B: Right. And when you deposit 16 Eth into rocket pool as a validator, 16 more ETH comes from other people to fill, to backfill that. And then you get to 32, for example. So it's all 32 all the way down.
01:17:36.916 - 01:17:49.460, Speaker A: 32 all the way down. It's like bits. All right, what are the things you agree with bitcoin maxis on this? Is Timu lens asking that question? David, do you agree with bitcoin maxis on anything?
01:17:49.910 - 01:18:23.446, Speaker B: Yeah, quite a lot. Right. It's like, I agree with bitcoiners have everything right on I. Our principles with what bitcoin is, I think is really, really aligned. That venn diagram overlap is significant. It's the execution that we disagree on. So things like a self sovereign monetary policy that humans don'tinker with, I want that a calcified blockchain that doesn't change in the long term, I want that censorship resistance, I want that all the same principles we fundamentally agree with bitcoiners.
01:18:23.446 - 01:18:48.470, Speaker B: It's just like we disagree on how to actually apply that when it comes to a blockchain. So I think if you have a bitcoin blockchain, you actually don't get censorship resistance because you have to do financial activity at the centralized layer, like there's no defi and bitcoin. And so I disagree with how you actually achieve censorship resistance versus what bitcoiners see. But the base principles are very, very aligned. I very much agree with them on most things in that camp.
01:18:48.620 - 01:19:18.394, Speaker A: Well said. I have nothing to add. I pretty much agree with all of that. And one thing I will say, though, is Vitalik has said before that Ethereum values are bitcoin moderate values. Right. And I think that's an interesting take too. One maybe area of disagreement with bitcoin maximalists is because the question is specifically with bitcoin maximalists, they agree or they think that the only manifestation of this thing is bitcoin.
01:19:18.394 - 01:19:47.374, Speaker A: Right. And that is the departure, I would say, from what you and I believe and what they believe. And there's not the pragmatism, I would say that there is in kind of the Ethereum community of like, hey, there are different routes to get there. And some are more pragmatic and not as cut and dry as bitcoin was created by Satoshi. It's never changed. Fully immutable. 21 million forever.
01:19:47.374 - 01:20:00.458, Speaker A: Right. That's kind of like written in bitcoin maximalist law. So the ideas are similar, but I guess the manifestation of those ideas, the implementation of them, are different.
01:20:00.624 - 01:20:11.166, Speaker B: Right. I'm reminded of that meme where it's a Star Trek meme where the lady is asking two dudes, like, are you two friends? And the bitcoiner is like, no. And the ethereum is like, yes, I.
01:20:11.188 - 01:20:16.190, Speaker A: Totally agree with that. All right, David, some takes of the week. Why don't you read this first one from gas?
01:20:16.270 - 01:20:31.142, Speaker B: Yeah. Good times create centralized projects. Centralized projects create bad times. Bad times creates decentralized projects. Decentralized projects create good times. I love this take. I thought this was so good.
01:20:31.142 - 01:20:46.266, Speaker B: I feel like this is just really emblematic of the tail end of 2021 where a bunch of centralized products, projects which touted decentralization turned out to be centralized and created a bunch of bad times. Ryan, I think you name the blockchain, what comes to mind.
01:20:46.448 - 01:20:48.246, Speaker A: Terra sir luna.
01:20:48.358 - 01:20:50.970, Speaker B: Yeah, that whole fiasco created some bad times.
01:20:51.040 - 01:20:56.190, Speaker A: Well, not only that, three earth capitals, big centralized kind of fund, black box.
01:20:56.260 - 01:21:02.842, Speaker B: Celsius, centralized lending, also touting decentralization, but was super duper centralized.
01:21:02.906 - 01:21:11.186, Speaker A: Yep, some bad times. But on the back of this it says bad times create decentralized projects. Does that mean during the build market that's where we are going to get.
01:21:11.208 - 01:21:11.794, Speaker B: We are here.
01:21:11.832 - 01:21:12.978, Speaker A: We're here. Okay.
01:21:13.144 - 01:21:15.662, Speaker B: Bad times creating decentralized projects.
01:21:15.726 - 01:21:21.550, Speaker A: I'm okay with being here for like a while. I could spend a good year here before we get to the good times.
01:21:21.640 - 01:21:27.350, Speaker B: How long are we into this thing? Is that 2022? Six months or a second half of 2022?
01:21:27.500 - 01:21:31.398, Speaker A: I think stuff really started to go bad. May, June this year.
01:21:31.484 - 01:21:35.946, Speaker B: May and June. Yeah, we're a little bit more than one quarter into it.
01:21:35.968 - 01:21:45.600, Speaker A: Yeah, just a quarter. Okay. I could spend, like, five or six quarters here before. I'm feeling a little restless. Yeah, or longer. I don't care.
01:21:46.130 - 01:21:48.094, Speaker B: I'm down to have a wintery winter for sure.
01:21:48.132 - 01:21:50.702, Speaker A: That's cool. Here's the take.
01:21:50.836 - 01:22:02.846, Speaker B: Maybe because it's of this take. Brian, shout out and says, 99% of the crypto industry is a joke, but the remaining 1% will change the world. First off, any thoughts on that take, since it's yours?
01:22:02.878 - 01:22:46.378, Speaker A: But also why I just wanted to say this. It's a bit. Of course, the market cap of legitimate projects like bitcoin, Ethereum, many other projects that we think are fully legitimate is greater than 1%. Right, sure. So there's a little bit of hyperbole here, but the reason I wanted to say this, 99% of the crypto industry is a joke, is I think that we should say that explicitly to lower the defenses of people who aren't on the inside of our industry, but are on the outside looking in. The very first thing we should say is, guys, we acknowledge all of the scams, all of the shenanigans, all of the stupidity.
01:22:46.474 - 01:22:47.182, Speaker B: Yes, you are.
01:22:47.236 - 01:23:13.290, Speaker A: That you see it, that you see in here, you are correct. You are 100% right. We acknowledge that. I'm not trying to defend any of it. It's stupid. And then after that, you kind of say, but there's something here. There's a sliver of incredible technology and political, social movement, and social layer that is absolutely going to change everything.
01:23:13.290 - 01:23:29.054, Speaker A: And if you stop at the 99% of the joke part, you don't get to that 1% will change the world, then you'll miss out on this thing. But first step is acknowledging it specifically when you're talking to someone outside of the crypto industry. Good take.
01:23:29.172 - 01:23:29.742, Speaker B: Love it.
01:23:29.796 - 01:23:45.860, Speaker A: All right, David, now we'll get to your take. This is you. The merge reduces eth's gravity by 90%. David Hoffman take. Okay, I know it reduces ETH's issuance by 90%. Of course, we've talked about that. The triple habiting post merge, that's what's going to happen.
01:23:45.860 - 01:23:49.958, Speaker A: Why are you saying the word gravity rather than issuance here?
01:23:50.124 - 01:24:20.958, Speaker B: Right. Because proof of work miners, the theory behind proof of work miners is that proof of work as a mechanism fundamentally approaches 100% of sell pressure. Therefore, issuance plus proof of work. The combination of those two things is always like a downwards pull on price. And so proof of stake is the fundamental opposite. It's the complete inversion of that. So proof of stakers are competing with each other on who's more bullish, because as more people stake more eth, the yields go down.
01:24:20.958 - 01:25:12.926, Speaker B: And so the way that this works is that the people that accept the lowest yields are always the last one staking. And so the most bullish people are always accepting the lower and lower yields as staking becomes more and more saturated. And so where proof of work miners are on a race to sell their asset, stakers are in a race to be more bullish than the asset. So with proof of work, it approaches 100% of sell pressure, and with proof of stake, it approaches 0% sell pressure, it goes in the opposite direction. And so when we reduce our issuance by 90%, it's another metaphor. Like last week, I was talking about the swimmer that has a swim upstream and it grows really strong muscles, and then the current goes away, and all of a sudden, those strong muscles can move ether forward. The same thing with ether issuance is that when we reduce issuance by 90% and go to proof of stake, it's like we're turning gravity off on the ETH price.
01:25:12.926 - 01:25:18.254, Speaker B: Like when it jumps, it's going to jump ten times higher because the gravity is turned off on ether.
01:25:18.302 - 01:25:22.370, Speaker A: We have moon gravity rather than ether's got moon boots.
01:25:24.230 - 01:25:27.390, Speaker B: It's ten times easier to get to the moon. How do you like that metaphor?
01:25:27.470 - 01:25:32.306, Speaker A: I like it a lot since it's merged. Timber. I'm feeling in the mood for these kind of bullish tweets.
01:25:32.498 - 01:25:35.346, Speaker B: I think you're always in the mood, David.
01:25:35.458 - 01:25:52.634, Speaker A: Last thing, I'll read it from Eric Wall. Last take of the week. Andreas Antonopoulos was and still is a great man and probably the best bitcoiner who ever existed. And this is Kobe under it saying, he's such a legend. And then picture. What are we looking at here?
01:25:52.752 - 01:26:14.690, Speaker B: Yeah, we're picture of just a Kobe and Andreas Antonopoulos posing for a photo with just a nice high five, which definitely looks like a London bar, I'm guessing, because that's where Kobe is. And Kobe says the world's greatest bitcoiner. Of course, Andreas next to the world's worst bitcoiner, which is, of course, Kobe. I just thought it was a good photo. It's a nice black and white photo. Kind of looks like an oldie photo. I thought it was a good photo.
01:26:16.870 - 01:26:29.862, Speaker A: Andreas is one of the people who got me into crypto, I will say back in 2014, and he is. I know sometimes David and I give bitcoin maximalists a hard time. We're not giving bitcoiners a hard time.
01:26:29.916 - 01:26:30.520, Speaker B: No.
01:26:31.150 - 01:27:10.114, Speaker A: Andreas, to me, is like the greatest bitcoiner who ever existed. I think he exemplifies all of the good parts of bitcoin. And I wish more Andreas's were still counting themselves as bitcoiners, because that is a person that does not embarrass me when I call myself a bitcoiner. I'd be proud to be associated with someone like Andreas. Andreas, he's here for the right reasons. He cares very deeply about the fundamental values of censorship, resistance, and immutability, like what we're building in crypto. And he stayed true from the very beginning.
01:27:10.114 - 01:27:37.774, Speaker A: He's also incredibly articulate and very persuasive thinker and a genuinely good person who's upheld his reputation over the decades. How many other people in crypto can you say that about? So if you ever want an example of somebody, a bitcoiner that David and I think very highly of and would want to emulate and would want to be bankless, to be associated with, it's Andreas Antonopoulos. He should come on bankless podcast. We still haven't made that happen yet.
01:27:37.812 - 01:28:13.160, Speaker B: We've tried to. We've tried to get him on. He'll come on eventually, hopefully. His Internet of money books, Ryan, were. They were the first piece of non technical bitcoin literature that really opened up my brain to what this thing is. And when I would listen to his talks on YouTube, and they're all just chock full of metaphors, and people talk about, like, bankless, they're really good at their. Like, I'm so honored that people say that about us because I look to Andreas Antonopoulos as, like, a personal hero in this space, as somebody who really commands the literary power of metaphor to help democratize access to the information behind.
01:28:13.160 - 01:28:29.434, Speaker B: So, like, not only am I totally in agreement that he's the world's greatest bitcoiner, just straight up personal hero. And if you haven't read Andreas's Antonopoulos'Internet of money, volumes one and two, add that to your required reading material because it will grow your understanding of crypto.
01:28:29.562 - 01:28:34.234, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. There we go. All right, what are you bullish on this week, David?
01:28:34.362 - 01:28:55.654, Speaker B: I'm bullish on Bankless's brand new live streaming infrastructure, which I think the viewers on the YouTube definitely got a taste of that because the formatting is a little bit different. Still got some work to do. Still need to get some templates from our designer to make that black background more interesting. But the Obs, the broadcasting suite service that I use. And also this physical studio has now finally been done. We're done here.
01:28:55.692 - 01:28:57.800, Speaker A: It's good to turn the lights on again. Yeah.
01:28:58.250 - 01:29:25.606, Speaker B: Okay. Oh, shit. I should have let into the wes, the guy that was helping me set this stuff up, he sets up the normal lights, right? So, like, YouTube lights got some blue in the background, and then once he's done with that, he's like, okay, I'm done setting up all the lights for the studio, but would you like party mode lights? And I go for a half second? Yes, I would like party mode lights. And so now I have party mode lights in my apartment.
01:29:25.738 - 01:29:30.740, Speaker A: Wow, that's awesome, man. Are you going to use that outside of the podcast? I have people over.
01:29:31.430 - 01:29:36.360, Speaker B: This is like, when I'm just working, like, writing and doing some work. We got party mode lights on.
01:29:38.410 - 01:29:59.834, Speaker A: David's in the club. It's good roll ups, I think arbitram nitro earlier this week. Right? So it's only been a year since roll ups kind of came out, like, EVM compatible roll ups. And we just got seven x more ethereums out of it in just a year's time. All right.
01:29:59.872 - 01:30:00.950, Speaker B: Seven more ethereums.
01:30:01.030 - 01:30:34.534, Speaker A: Yeah. You don't have to do the math, but if you do seven x every year, that's a lot of transactions per second. That's a lot of scalability. And not only did they do that, you also have technologies like Nova, for example, which is, like, relaxing the requirement to put data on chain and store it elsewhere. What I learned in that episode we did earlier this week is if the data availability piece, if that part goes bad, that it just folds back gracefully into a roll up. I didn't know roll ups could do that, David. So it's not like that bad of a trade off at all.
01:30:34.534 - 01:30:55.966, Speaker A: And I guess all of this makes me kind of wonder about sort of the thesis for, like, if you're a monolithic layer one, how are you competing here? Right, because you can't compete from a security perspective, right? That's out of the question. And now roll ups are getting, like, just as fast as you and just as cheap as you.
01:30:56.068 - 01:31:01.182, Speaker B: So how do you, how do you, Ryan, you. You go sue other layer ones. That's what you do.
01:31:01.236 - 01:31:10.740, Speaker A: Well, if you're shady. But if you're not shady, and I think there are many layer ones out there that aren't devolving into shady practices. Maybe a Solana, for example. Right.
01:31:12.070 - 01:31:14.450, Speaker B: I have more respect for Solana now than I used to.
01:31:14.520 - 01:31:38.934, Speaker A: Well, trying to do things well. Right. And so how do they compete? They have to compete on business development. This is why we see things like a Solana store. I genuinely believe they're trying to compete on business development, but I think the long term on this is that it's going to be difficult because I'm seeing some of these rollups and their biz dev is firing up. Right. So, like, Polygon is already crushing it like optimism.
01:31:38.934 - 01:31:41.226, Speaker A: We got ZK sync, we've got arbitram.
01:31:41.338 - 01:31:47.760, Speaker B: Arbitram hired that former face somebody, big ass, big company marketing development team.
01:31:48.210 - 01:32:20.434, Speaker A: They are learning the business development skills and they started technical, now they're learning the business development. So it's going to be hard for the middle to hold. And so what I think we'll be left with, honestly, is on one side you'll have ethereum, which is kind of the modular settlement layer strategy, and on the other side you'll actually have cosmos. Right. I mean, the cosmos ethos, not necessarily cosmos, but this messy array of self sovereign chains. And I think there'll be not much in the middle. I don't think the middle will actually hold.
01:32:20.434 - 01:32:41.674, Speaker A: So it is back to kind of like you got Ethereum and then you got the cosmos ecosystem and not much in the middle. And maybe this has always been the way this industry has kind of evolved, because these have been the two dueling visions. Anyway, that was kind of a realization for me this week, and I'm excited about the scale we've just brought to Ethereum.
01:32:41.722 - 01:32:50.306, Speaker B: Once again, 100%. Yeah, I do think the era of monolithic blockchains is over. You're going to get outcompeted just by raw tech.
01:32:50.408 - 01:32:53.490, Speaker A: By the way, we're doing a lot with Cosmos. In October.
01:32:54.390 - 01:33:10.360, Speaker B: After merge timber comes cosmos. Tober, Zackie and Sonny from Cosmos to come give us the cosmos vision. But, I mean, we wanted to do it now, but can't do it now. It's merged timber. So we're going to do cos Tober with them.
01:33:11.290 - 01:33:15.114, Speaker A: There we go. All right, David meme of the week time, what are we looking at?
01:33:15.312 - 01:33:34.670, Speaker B: We're looking at the Drake drop. So Drake, the know the one, he's like shunning the first one, then pointing to the second one is Drake is shunning his own Drake album drop. And then he's pointing towards the actual, real Drake. Justin Drake, the dropping on the bankless podcast Ethereum uncensored. If you didn't listen to that episode, what the hell are you doing? Go listen to it.
01:33:34.740 - 01:33:36.882, Speaker A: It was real good. Did you listen to it the second time? Yet.
01:33:36.936 - 01:33:37.650, Speaker B: Yes, I did.
01:33:37.720 - 01:33:47.300, Speaker A: So did. It's because actually, I felt like the first time we didn't listen to the entire thing because connectivity was so bad between Justin and.
01:33:49.050 - 01:34:08.010, Speaker B: There'S a fun little piece of trivia on that episode is that the Internet was so bad that we were using Skype, which I hate. We were all recording both video and audio locally, talking to each other on Skype. And then our magical editors, Luke and Dave just saved this episode.
01:34:08.670 - 01:34:26.562, Speaker A: You know, it sounds flawless. Yeah, it sounds like even, maybe better than normal. I didn't even know how they did that. But thank you guys.
