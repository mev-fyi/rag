00:00:14.330 - 00:00:41.846, Speaker A: Welcome to Bankless, where we explore the frontier of Internet money and Internet finance. This is how to get started, how to get better, and how to front run the opportunity. This is Ryan Sean Adams. I'm here once again with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless. David, we have a fantastic episode. This is our second in a series where we're tackling the top three DeFi protocols. This is how to go bankless with Uniswap.
00:00:41.846 - 00:00:44.620, Speaker A: What are we going to cover, David, and why is it important?
00:00:44.990 - 00:01:07.502, Speaker B: We are going to cover the complete scope of the Uniswap protocol, which is not a small feat. While Uniswap is very simple, the Uniswap rabbit hole goes very, very deep. There's a lot of layers to Uniswap that goes beneath the surface. And we're going to peel back all of those layers and explore all of them in this episode.
00:01:07.566 - 00:01:28.694, Speaker A: Yeah, this is going to be fantastic. Uniswap is cool because it is one of the most decentralized DeFi applications on that Defi trust spectrum that we've talked about in previous episodes. Uniswap is not a bank. It is not a company. It's not a user interface. This is a protocol. It lives completely on Ethereum, completely on chain.
00:01:28.694 - 00:02:01.922, Speaker A: And the possibilities that it brings into the open finance Ethereum economy are incredible. And we're going to dive into all of them. But before we do, want to take a minute to talk about our fantastic sponsors. The first one is for our us listeners primarily. So if you have an IRA or a 401, a retirement account, chances are it's jailed inside of your brokerage. That means you don't have good access to crypto. If you try to buy crypto inside of your brokerage, it costs you five x the price.
00:02:01.922 - 00:02:28.810, Speaker A: Don't do that. Don't get ripped off. What you want to do is break your retirement account out of brokerage jail. Rocket dollar can help you do that. They'll set up what's called a self directed IRA or a self directed 401K. They'll help you with the paperwork, they'll help you with the transfers. They will help you get to a place where you can buy crypto on the spot market on coinbase or on Gemini in a tax sheltered retirement account.
00:02:28.810 - 00:02:42.910, Speaker A: This is a fantastic financial hack for you guys. And if you go to rocketdollar.com, you can get set up today. Just use the code bankless and you'll get $50 off. That's rocketdollar.com. Use the code bankless.
00:02:43.270 - 00:03:36.914, Speaker B: We have a new sponsor on the scene, one of my favorite Ethereum applications. DyDX is the leading and most performant decentralized exchange in crypto. And the really amazing thing about DyDx is like uniswap, it is entirely on chain, and so it is a non custodial exchange where you are not trusting people with your money, but you still get to access all of the cool features and services that you would expect from a centralized exchange. Things you can do on DYDX are spot trading, margin trading. You can borrow ETh, you can borrow Dai, you can lend ETh, you can lend Dai. DyDX has originated over a billion dollars in loans over the last year and a half a billion dollars in trading volume. Something pretty new and innovative that DyDx is doing is they're bringing bitcoin into Defi through perpetual contract markets, which it's not live yet.
00:03:36.914 - 00:04:13.902, Speaker B: It's starting, it's launching in May, so you can sign up for that alpha today. You'll be able to use bitcoin inside of DyDX, inside of the application, which is pretty exciting. I like it whenever I see some sort of defi application starting to integrate bitcoin and the bitcoin price into their product and services. So we have a special offer for bankless listeners. If you sign up with the bankless link, you will get 10% off of trading fees using our referral link. And that referral link is trade DyDX exchangerbankless. It's a bit of a mouthful, so it's in the show notes, if you want to go get it there.
00:04:13.902 - 00:04:24.160, Speaker B: DyDX is one of my favorite protocols. They really do it all. Basically anything you can do on Ethereum, you can also do inside of DyDX. So check them out.
00:04:24.610 - 00:04:54.234, Speaker A: Okay, before we dig into the episode, let's talk some big picture stuff, David. So a couple things that are going on in the crypto in the bankless sphere. So the first is this, Coinbase is adding a defi oracle. So David, I got a question about this because I tweeted this out and somebody, Ryan, I mean, doesn't this make oracles on Defi in Ethereum more centralized? If a crypto bank like Coinbase is providing an oracle, what are your thoughts on that?
00:04:54.352 - 00:05:40.170, Speaker B: Yeah, it's an easy thing to slip into, because anyone who's in Defi is always harping on centralized exchanges, and that habit is easy to slip into. But I would contend that any further addition of more oracles always makes oracles more decentralized. So it doesn't even matter if the White House or the Federal Reserve provided an oracle for DeFi. It's just one more oracle to add to the list. And so this is really good news. Coinbase of all companies, of all institutions, is definitely aligned with the crypto vision, and so their incentives are where we want them to be. I was once having a conversation with a friend of mine talking about how the only way you can get bitcoin is on a centralized exchange.
00:05:40.170 - 00:06:09.934, Speaker B: And he countered with, well, if there are 30 different centralized exchanges all over the world that are very easy to get onto, well, then bitcoin is actually decentralized. And so if Coinbase copies this model and then finance is also an oracle and Gemini is also an oracle, and Huobi is also an know, we start to have more and more options with where we can get our oracles from. And so we're not beholden to just using one oracle.
00:06:09.982 - 00:06:10.194, Speaker A: Right.
00:06:10.232 - 00:06:44.858, Speaker B: The more oracles, the better. The really cool thing about this story was that compound, the compound finance team was really pushing for this forever ago. And I believe Robert Lesher had this tweet where he was talking about how centralized exchanges need to be oracles for the defi ecosystem and the oracle standard. The code or the model of the oracle that Coinbase used came from what compound published. So tip of the hat to compound and Robert Lesher for spearheading this really long time ago, and I'm glad it's now coming to fruition.
00:06:44.954 - 00:07:15.730, Speaker A: Robert's going to be our next show. So episode eleven, folks. So tune into that. We'll ask him about this too. But yeah, I tend to agree with you on this, David. So I think if you look at the way the maker oracle works and that of course, maintains the peg for die and ETH and is a key component of the entire maker system, but it has a dozen or so different oracles. Some of these are operated by known entities, some of these are operated by anonymous entities.
00:07:15.730 - 00:08:07.826, Speaker A: So say it's twelve or 15 oracles, adding another one from Coinbase and then taking the average price of all of those oracles, that's net additive to the system. It increases the decentralized nature of the system, as you're saying, because you are gaining an additional node, an additional price source, and you can still take the median across all of those price sources in order to get your ultimate maker oracle price. So I tend to agree with you. And we're actually going to be talking about another oracle design inside of this episode that is even more decentralized. Still, Uniswap actually can be used. A byproduct of its exchange and trading capability is an actual price oracle. And that can be used inside of these defi systems too, and further decentralizes the oracle.
00:08:07.826 - 00:08:21.946, Speaker A: So Coinbase adding an oracle. Good news for DeFi, actually good news for decentralization and exactly as you say, I think it will lead to all of the other exchanges incorporating and creating a defi oracle in order to keep pace with Coinbase.
00:08:22.138 - 00:08:59.114, Speaker B: Coinbase has really shown their colors, I think with the commitment to large amounts of USDC and USDC liquidity into DeFi applications. And now with this defi Oracle, I'm pretty happy with how they're positioning themselves. They're definitely defi friendly. And having somebody like Coinbase, which is the leading exchange in the United States, I would say making pretty bold statements about how they are defi friendly. A Defi friendly company is pretty cool. I mean, they offer interest rates on your USDC, in your Coinbase account. Now, those interest rates are extremely low.
00:08:59.114 - 00:09:17.774, Speaker B: It's like 1.5%. But I think your protocol sync thesis, Ryan, where companies like Gemini and Coinbase integrate DFI applications like the DSR, I'm bullish on that, and I think the friendliness that Coinbase is offering DFI is a good sign for that.
00:09:17.892 - 00:09:20.560, Speaker A: Dude, are we going to do an episode on the protocol sync, man?
00:09:21.010 - 00:09:49.730, Speaker B: Absolutely, 100%. So I'm giving a talk at the ethereal conference next week, which actually. So this is coming out on Monday in May, and so my talk will be on Thursday, all about the protocol sync thesis and settlement assurances. And so come to the ethereal conference and listen to that. And then me and Ryan are 100% going to do an epic episode specifically about the protocol sync thesis. So it's going to be a good one.
00:09:49.820 - 00:10:09.706, Speaker A: Yeah. So I'm super excited about that conference, David, because not only do you have a talk on the protocol sync, we have a panel called ETH is money. It's got you. Myself, Eric Connor, Anthony Sassiano. Cammy is hosting it as well. She's moderating. It's going to be super exciting.
00:10:09.706 - 00:11:00.506, Speaker A: We're going to talk about a lot of the topics we talk about in bankless and apply those. Maybe there'll even be some debate about how ETH is emerging as a money system, but it's going to be a fun. Know another thing that we should probably talk about? We recorded our episode with Caleb on Wednesday. On that Wednesday, Uniswap had what I might call its first initial Uniswap listing like an IUL, almost like it almost felt reminiscent of an ICO. So some of the very concepts that we talked about in our conversation with Caleb, we saw them play out in real time. What was your take on what happened? Maybe you could just describe the listing itself and the token, and then sort of what happened. And then I'd be curious to hear your take, David.
00:11:00.618 - 00:12:03.294, Speaker B: So I'm all for experimentation, and this was definitely a very interesting experiment to run. I think the outcome of this experiment is, don't do this again. I think it was not the right way to issue a token for a number of reasons. Uniswap is not a way to distribute a token, and that's simply because, and we saw this in the ICO mania way back when the bat token sale was famous for selling out of the entire supply of the basic attention token in the first, like three blocks. And so that really rewarded technically adept people who were able to make a bot to make sure that their transaction got in on the first block. And we saw that with the Uma token listing on Uniswap as well, where people bought up a bunch of supply on the first block and then sold it on the third or fourth block after the listing. And so this isn't how you generate an aligned community, an aligned set of people that are your stakeholders.
00:12:03.294 - 00:12:33.946, Speaker B: This is how you attract arbitragers and traders and people trying to make a quick buck. And so that didn't look too good for me. I think there were much better ways to issue a token in ways that are more long term, aligned with your company, with your project and the community holding your token. If you wanted to get your token into the hands of people, Uniswap is people that are stakeholders and want to see the best for your company. I would not issue it through Uniswap.
00:12:34.058 - 00:13:33.874, Speaker A: Yeah, and there might be a better way that somebody can design a way to issue it in a more fair way in uniswap. But to me, this was not that. So I know the Uma token, they started listing at basically the price of their last raise. So a market cap of UMa tokens of 27 million, which is high in and of itself when you consider there are currently no cash flows that I'm aware of accruing to the token, nor is there a product that we can get our hands on and use. But that aside, that was raised with accredited investors and vcs and that sort of thing. But the net outcome after this uniswap listing with a very small amount of supply so only about 3% of the total Uma tokens were provided as liquidity. The net outcome is that Uma as a token is the number five DFI money protocol token on the market at 121,000,000 right now.
00:13:33.874 - 00:14:38.590, Speaker A: So I don't know. That's a five x or so of their last raise with vcs. So it did. Whether intentional or not, this was definitely an experiment and give the team the benefit of doubt. It's hard to know necessarily if this was intentional, but it had the effect of pumping the price to a degree that is probably not sustainable long term and is probably not conducive to growing a community. So we'll see how this plays out, but there's a possibility here. David, I don't know if you agree or not, but I was starting to get feelings of oh my God, this is the very beginnings of ICO mania again, only it'll be conducted on Uniswap, and we just need to make sure that the community is informed and buys into assets, if they're doing this, that have long term value accrual mechanisms and that are fairly valued.
00:14:38.670 - 00:15:30.120, Speaker B: Uniswap, I guess, is an easy place to issue a token because everyone knows what Uniswap is and it's really easy to go and buy a token. So I guess in that sense it's making it more accessible because everyone knows how to buy and sell on Uniswap. So that maybe an accessibility argument is to be made there, but the 2% of the total supply of the token made available on day one. It's hard to excuse that, in my opinion. You said that we don't really know if they were doing that intentionally or not. I'm going to go ahead and be a little bit more critical than that. I think that if they just decided that 2% was the right number and didn't think about the illiquidity, that would result in just only 2%, and then the price pumping effect that comes from illiquidity would follow.
00:15:30.120 - 00:15:51.130, Speaker B: I think we should assume that they definitely knew what they were doing. And again, it goes back to the issue of this is not how you generate an aligned community, an aligned network of stakeholders, but it is how you pump a token really fast in the first few blocks. And that's definitely what happened. So this doesn't sit really too well with me over the long term.
00:15:51.630 - 00:16:36.602, Speaker A: I think our best defense as a community against this sort of thing is to make sure we understand very clearly the value accrual mechanisms of all of these assets. Things went absolutely bonkers in 2017 because people put fundamentals aside and value accrual mechanisms aside, and they just chase the pump on the bankless journey. We're not about that. This is about long term fundamentals, the long term growth of an industry. And so pumpamentals aren't something that we get really excited about. So I definitely agree with you there. So while we're talking about money verbs and defi protocols, here's one you absolutely have to check out.
00:16:36.602 - 00:17:15.522, Speaker A: This is a lending and borrowing protocol called Ave. What does it do? You can put dai into it, you can put ETH into it. It will take your dai, it will take your ETH, and it will transform that into an interest bearing asset. This is a great way to level up in the bankless money system. You can also borrow from it. We were talking about borrowing from various protocols at a variable rate, but this allows you to Ave allows you to borrow from it at a fixed rate so you know exactly what you're going to pay from one day to the next and one month to the next. Developers, you've got to check out their flash loan protocols.
00:17:15.522 - 00:17:34.442, Speaker A: Groups like DeFi Saver have integrated these into their protocols, into their applications, and created a lot of value. Go to ave.com and deposit crypto to start earning or borrowing. That's aave.com. Try it out on your bankless journey.
00:17:34.506 - 00:18:14.970, Speaker B: You might find that your bankless account is storing more value than your bank account, but you still need to buy things at the grocery store. You still need to go out on Friday nights. And if all your money is in the crypto world, well, you're ahead of the times. But you still need to live your life, and that's where monolith can help you out. The Monolith DeFi card is a way to keep your funds in the bankless universe while still being able to buy things in the real world. The monolith Visa card is accepted wherever Visa is, which is like the whole world. And it lets you use your dai, as it's supposed to be, as money, as a way to pay for things.
00:18:14.970 - 00:18:37.298, Speaker B: So go to monolith XYZ and check out their DeFi card. Check out their rates. The DeFi card is a smart contract wallet, which is something that we definitely have to get into as to what that is on bankless, but it's a really cool way to protect your funds and still be able to use them. So go to monolith XYZ and get your defi card today.
00:18:37.464 - 00:19:13.680, Speaker A: Well, without further ado, David, we should get to our episode with Caleb on the Uniswap protocol. This is how to go bankless with Uniswap. Welcome to our episode on Uniswap. This is going to be fantastic. David and I are here with Caleb Sheridan. He works at Blocklytics, which is a data analysis and services company that focuses on protocols like Uniswap. He knows a lot about it.
00:19:13.680 - 00:19:23.918, Speaker A: Caleb, could you just begin by telling us a bit about your journey in Ethereum in sort of the bankless space and how you stumbled across Uniswap?
00:19:24.094 - 00:19:56.906, Speaker C: Sure. Just as Uniswap is launching. I heard Vitalik speaking at ETH London, and he mentioned Uniswap as one of these common goods projects that was released that did not use a token model. And it was right as I was founding my company, Blocklytics. And so it seemed kind of obvious to go and explore this project that italic mentioned. As soon as I saw it and I saw the simplicity of it, I just got sucked in and went and did as much research as possible on the protocol and have been following along ever since.
00:19:57.008 - 00:20:04.560, Speaker B: So the uniswap without a token is something that caught your eye. What else about Uniswap caught your eye? And maybe also about Ethereum at large?
00:20:05.090 - 00:20:59.566, Speaker C: Ethereum is fundamentally useful. I mean, at this point, there are things that you can do on Ethereum with cryptocurrency that we've kind of been dreaming about for years. And one of those was swapping tokens really easily. And so getting into Uniswap and seeing this public good that was available, that made token swaps easily accessible for individuals was kind of eye opening. I think before that, before Uniswap, even the user interfaces and the user experience of doing token swaps was really difficult. It would involve like, going on centralized exchanges, giving them personal information, personal details, waiting for 30, 40, 50 confirmations to make a deposit, and only then kind of dealing with order book layouts and order books. And then at the end of all of that, the money that was on these centralized exchanges was a lot of the times out of.
00:20:59.566 - 00:21:30.090, Speaker C: And so if you look at kind of when Uniswap came out, how the market was for trading tokens, and then this clean product with, you have ether and you want this other token, just pick the amounts and hit swap. It was really eye opening and refreshing. And that kind of got me into the rabbit hole of uniswap. It was just the simplicity behind it and the fact that it was this public good, really helping users out accomplish this simple thing of swapping tokens.
00:21:30.830 - 00:22:28.982, Speaker A: This is cool. So, Caleb, let's dive into those first two. So the first one you mentioned is exchanging and trading, right? So this is basically a function that in the more centralized exchange, the crypto bank world, a coinbase or a binance might do for you with some sort of an order book, right? And the second is actually providing liquidity. Let's dive into the first so folks kind of understand how this works. So if, let's say I have a position in Dai, so that's a stablecoin we talked about in episode nine with Mariano Conte. So let's say I have Dai and I want to exchange that for ether. How does it work? What are the fees for that process? Am I interacting with an order book of any kind? Is there like a peer to peer transfer going on, or how do I tap into that liquidity?
00:22:29.126 - 00:23:09.506, Speaker C: Sure. So Uniswap is a decentralized exchange where users can swap ether and ERC 20 tokens. The exchange itself is funded by its users. In many cases, it's funded by the same people who are swapping tokens. They become liquidity providers who make the whole thing run and provide liquidity for traders. So, long story short, Uniswap is this decentralized exchange ecosystem where traders and liquidity providers kind of all work together to build financial markets between different cryptocurrencies and different tokens.
00:23:09.538 - 00:23:41.122, Speaker B: On Ethereum, I definitely remember the days of 2018 when Uniswap came out, where I had my finance account, and I'm pretty sure the last time I've logged into finance was the day that Uniswap came out, and I became immediately a little bit more bankless as a result. So I definitely resonate with that. So let's start with some definitions, and I think we have kind of a fun game ahead of us. Can you explain Uniswap in ten sentences? And then I'm going to ask you to explain it in one sentence. But let's start with ten sentences or a paragraph, if you can.
00:23:41.176 - 00:24:21.310, Speaker C: So the first option with Uniswap, and the first thing that many people see on the page is that you can swap ether for tokens. And there's an extensive list of tokens which we'll get into in a few minutes. This is kind of the most at its core. This is the service that Uniswap is providing end users. You can swap any given token for ether, and you can even swap any given token for any other given token. The second thing you can do with Uniswap is you can provide liquidity. And when you provide liquidity, you take ownership of a given exchange pair, and you share a portion of the fees that that exchange pair generates with all of the other owners.
00:24:21.310 - 00:24:33.646, Speaker C: So in this case, liquidity providers are providing liquidity to facilitate trades and collecting fees as part of the protocol.
00:24:33.838 - 00:24:45.414, Speaker B: Uniswap isn't just one thing. There's a bunch of different ways that you can use Uniswap. So can you go through kind of the various options that Uniswap provides people? What can you actually do with the.
00:24:45.452 - 00:25:55.210, Speaker C: Application when you make a trade or when liquidity providers provide liquidity to Uniswap? In this case, the EtH dai pair. Liquidity providers provide ether and Dai into a smart contract. And the smart contract holds those two assets in balance whenever a trader comes through and wants one of the assets from the pair. So in this case, Dai for ether, they provide the smart contract with Dai, and then they take back an amount of ether that the smart contract kind of just calculates on their behalf. So this is called like a price curve or something like that. You might have heard it called a bonding curve, which is like, maybe a questionable terminology for it, but the point is that the price is determined by the smart contract, and the price is determined by the ratio of assets that are inside of that smart contract. Whenever a trader does, whenever a trader makes a trade with a smart contract, they essentially give it a surplus of one of the assets, like DAi, and they take out some of the ETH from the smart contract.
00:25:55.210 - 00:26:33.670, Speaker C: And here, two things happen. One is that the user pays a small fee, which goes back into the smart contract. So the user pays, at the moment, 0.3% of a fee in ETH in this case. And then that ETH sits in the smart contract and is essentially distributed as a fee to all the liquidity providers of that smart contract balance. The second thing that happens is that the price changes for future trades. So because you've, in this case, traded DAi for ETH, you've changed the ratio of assets within the smart contract.
00:26:33.670 - 00:26:43.580, Speaker C: And so the new price for whoever comes after you to trade is going to be based on that new ratio of, depending on your trade size.
00:26:44.290 - 00:26:55.810, Speaker A: I think you were just about to tell us. So you're not really trading Caleb with an order book, right? You're almost trading with a smart contract. Some kind of. You called it a bonding curve.
00:26:56.390 - 00:27:33.214, Speaker C: Yeah, that's exactly right. You're trading with a smart contract. And the idea is that this ratio of assets always needs to be held to a constant product in this case. So this pricing curve, it has a unique property in that as an asset is removed or added, the second asset or the asset pair increases. And the really unique property about kind of the model that uniswap came out with is that this curve, if you plot it on X and Y, you would see that it looks kind of.
00:27:33.252 - 00:27:33.840, Speaker A: Like.
00:27:35.810 - 00:28:27.840, Speaker C: A square root. But essentially this curve goes to infinity on the y and goes to infinity without touching zero on the x. And the idea is that if you deposit one ETH and 200 die today in the smart contract, that contract, no matter how many trades are made or what size trades are made, the smart contract will never run out of those assets. It's just that what will happen over a bunch of trades in one direction is that the more popular asset will get more and more expensive. And so the idea is that this kind of promotes trades up to a certain point, and then the price shifts, and then it supports trades back down to that asset's kind of market value or real value external to the system.
00:28:29.170 - 00:29:01.930, Speaker A: So to make this really tangible. Caleb. Right. So if I am on the dai eth pair and I'm doing a small amount of die, say, $100 worth of dai, that kind of curve that you described is not going to be impacted so much. So I'll probably get a pretty good price for that die or for that eth. So the price might be comparable to something I could get on an exchange. Slippage is a word we might use for that.
00:29:01.930 - 00:29:31.330, Speaker A: That would be pretty low. It would cost me maybe 0.3%, 30 basis points in uniswap fees. But my slippage would probably be comparable to that of an order book exchange, like a coinbase. But if I really ramp up that volume and say I'm making a major purchase, I'm a large market maker, and I'm purchasing a million dollars worth of ETH with my dai. What happens in that case? What's my slippage like?
00:29:31.480 - 00:30:08.590, Speaker C: Yeah, in this pool right now, the ETH dai pool has about a little bit over $6 million of liquidity in it. And so the slippage on a $100 trade would be very negligible. And as you said, you would essentially just pay the exchange fee. The slippage on a much larger trade would increase and it increases at an increasing rate. So the bigger your trade is, the more slippage you would have. And in this case, you might have like 50% slippage or something like that. And so for these pools, but that's not to say that this is not for big traders, or it's only for tiny traders who want to trade ten or $20 at a time.
00:30:08.590 - 00:30:59.310, Speaker C: These pools are actually supporting trades of up to 100 grand with very, very low slippage. And the beauty of these pools is that those trades happen instantly. They happen in one transaction. There's no making a deposit to an exchange and eating up the order book or any of that. So if you really look at the slippage on even big trades, Uniswap in these deep markets is really competitive, even with popular order based markets. I'm just in awe that the system has gotten to that point where liquidity has grown to a point that Uniswap can be your only exchange. And that's one of the amazing things about watching this protocol grow in particular, and get to this stage of being suitable for all kinds of traders.
00:30:59.310 - 00:31:33.062, Speaker C: I would say that if you're really sensitive to slippage and you want to avoid it at all costs, the way to do that is just spread your trades out over time, right? So take your $1 million trade and spread it out over a few days or a few weeks, doing a small fraction of it at once, and really watching the amount of slippage that is affecting you. But I think that you would be surprised at how much volume uniswap can handle in terms of these deep pools.
00:31:33.206 - 00:31:39.930, Speaker B: How has the liquidity in Uniswap changed over time? Can you kind of illustrate that graph for our listeners?
00:31:40.850 - 00:32:51.250, Speaker C: Sure. Uniswap, being a Uniswap liquidity provider, it's not easy to understand what your returns will be. So it's based off of demand for a token that is hard to anticipate, and it's also based off the relative price of two assets. So if you're just looking at the Uniswap eth die pool, the price of eth external to Uniswap really matters and really affects you. Essentially what liquidity providers are doing in order to collect this trading fee is they're depositing their liquidity in such a way and promising to make trades and fulfill trades in such a way that it can actually kind of cost them money in the long term. So in other words, a Uniswap liquidity provider does not get the option to not take a trade that looks bad compared to the current market rate. And so what may happen is that Uniswap liquidity providers take a bunch of bad trades in a row, and the price ratio causes this phenomenon called impermanent loss.
00:32:51.250 - 00:33:56.150, Speaker C: But it is called impermanent loss because the price ratio can always return, and then the liquidity provider is not actually realizing that loss. It's just that on paper, the liquidity provider may take a few bad trades in a row and take some loss. So this is to say that anticipating returns as a liquidity provider is quite difficult. But what we've done at blocklytics is kind of tried to say, okay, well, what have the historical returns been and what does demand look like? So we do provide those historical returns on our website pools, FYI. But in general, this is kind of one of the difficulties of being a liquidity provider and having people kind of choose whether or not to be a liquidity provider. It's a very hard question to answer. Despite that, over time, as people have watched liquidity grow in Uniswap, and as people have watched the returns on these uniswap pools, we have seen liquidity growing over time.
00:33:56.150 - 00:34:35.860, Speaker C: And so there was a slight in ETH terms, especially because each uniswap liquidity pool is denominated in ETH. In ETH terms, we've just seen more and more highs. And at one point, I was looking at it on a weekly basis. It just never dropped. Every single week was a new high for the amount of liquidity in uniswap. Now that there's a long history of looking at previous returns and what happens in different types of markets, I think that people are more comfortable with getting involved and accepting that there may be a little bit of impermanent loss. But in many, many markets, the trading fees have historically made up for that.
00:34:35.860 - 00:34:52.620, Speaker C: Right now, we're kind of very close to an all time high in terms of liquidity, even after a lot of liquidity was removed following Black Thursday. And then obviously in dollar terms, we'd be very close to an all time high at this point as well.
00:34:54.110 - 00:35:11.150, Speaker B: Let's touch on impermanent loss a little bit more. And then also, every single uniswap pool has two assets in it, right? And so each uniswap pool is its own characteristic. What types of uniswap pools would see impermanent loss more than others?
00:35:11.300 - 00:36:22.946, Speaker C: Yeah, great question. I'll break this down into maybe three types of pools, and broadly speaking, everything more or less falls into one of these three types. So the first type is two assets like ETH and dai, which are not necessarily inherently linked or inherently related. You may have a personal opinion on where the price of ETH in terms of dai is going in the future, but there's no kind of reason why it can't go up and then come back to this price, or whatever the case is. So in this type of pool, where the two assets are kind of separate or non correlated, the impermanent loss is kind of just that. You may check your account balance one day and see that you've suffered a lot of impermanent loss, and come back the next day and see that you have no impermanent loss anymore. And so the idea is that this loss, which is what you risk as a liquidity provider, it comes in and kind of goes away in pools like Uniswap etH.
00:36:22.946 - 00:37:33.470, Speaker C: Dai there's another type of pool, which is what I would refer to as kind of a stable pool, where it's an example of this is the uniswap eth and synthetics eth pool. And the idea behind this is that you take two assets that should have the same value, and because they should have the same value or very close to the same value, by definition, there can really be no impermanent loss unless there's some catastrophic breaking of the peg. So in this case, Seth is loosely tied to ETH, but broadly speaking, trades within a range, within a range that's very close to one, one to one ratio. So in this case, traders just collect trading fees, and they don't really have too much risk of impermanent loss. And in these cases, we see that the growth of this pool has kind of spoken for itself. So, historically, this has been one of the biggest pools ever. One of the other biggest pools ever is the Uniswap etH to wrapped ETH pool, which also is a pegged asset.
00:37:33.470 - 00:38:45.346, Speaker C: And what we see is that traders are collecting reasonable returns in those pools, and so far, not really feeling much impermanent loss at all, because the exchange rate has remained very steady and very close to one. The third type of pool that I'll just mention quickly is a pool where the token is designed to be inflationary or designed to be deflationary. In this case, there is a huge risk of impermanent loss. And so this would be things like interest bearing tokens, or certain deflationary tokens that have kind of shown up over the past year or so. And these tokens essentially are designed in their mechanics to gain value against ETH. And so what that causes is these are much more at risk of, or the liquidity providers are much more at risk of impermanent loss if the token is designed to change in ratio, grow, or decrease in ratio against ETH. So, for example, in compound tokens, these make very poor pairs against ETH.
00:38:45.346 - 00:39:00.780, Speaker C: Because ultimately, the exchange rate of a compound token only increases, and therefore, it doesn't hold that same property of mitigating impermanent loss the way that wrapped ether or synthetics eth does.
00:39:01.470 - 00:39:34.878, Speaker A: So super cool. I mean, I think we'll talk about this a lot. The idea of permissionlessness. So anyone can go in and make a trade, and just as everything you were talking about, about becoming a liquidity pool provider, anyone can do that. It's permissionless, there's no identity required. You just have to have the assets, 50% of each in a pool, and deposit those assets, and then you are effectively a liquidity provider. And different pools give you various rates of return.
00:39:34.878 - 00:40:06.510, Speaker A: So if someone wants to increase their ETH denominated returns, for example, maybe an ETH type pool might be for them, maybe an eth dai pool. But you're in the data every day. Caleb, can you tell us where the big opportunities are for being a uniswap liquidity provider? So if I want to take my ETH and I want to make more, know which pool should I deposit into? If I want to take my dai and make more dai out of it, where should I go?
00:40:06.660 - 00:40:18.770, Speaker C: For people who, let's say, want to stay, I guess the best pools for brand new users to kind of try out and dip their toes in are definitely the ones without impermanent loss.
00:40:20.550 - 00:40:20.914, Speaker A: Or.
00:40:20.952 - 00:41:32.300, Speaker C: With limited impermanent loss or mitigated impermanent loss. So the popular pools like ETH, Seth and EtH wrapped ETH are great examples of this. Where it kind of starts to get tricky is, let's say that if you care about your returns in terms of ETH, and you want to stay exposed to ETH, to join, to be a liquidity provider in the ETH dai pool would require that you trade in half of your ETH for DAi. And so you lose out on any upside on half of your liquidity pool deposit. I think that for a lot of people, that has been sort of a deal breaker. Now, that said, there are ways of using maker, using some of these other systems to deposit ETh in order to generate the DAI that you need, and then deposit eth and the generated dye against a different eTh deposit into these pools, and then stay completely exposed to ETH. And one of the teams that's doing great work on making that process really straightforward and simple is Defi's app that kind of takes all of these different money legos and combines them in such a way to give users that end exposure that they want.
00:41:32.300 - 00:42:06.900, Speaker C: But I'll just say the important thing to kind of figure out as a liquidity provider is what do you want to earn money in? Or what is your underlying kind of, how are you going to count your victory? And so if you're really concerned about just stacking ETH, that's one strategy. If you're really concerned about tracking wins in terms of DAi, that might be a different strategy. And so I think kind of internalizing that and figuring that out as a liquidity provider is almost as important as even more important than picking out which pool to join or whatever the case is.
00:42:07.350 - 00:42:44.302, Speaker A: Yeah, we're definitely all about stacking of ETH in the bankless program. It is the reserve currency of upside for this entire space, for sure. But increasing dinominated returns is also interesting. And I want to jump on that point that you mentioned with Defi Zapp. So that gives you the ability to essentially supply liquidity to these pools in one click, in one transaction. We'll include a tactic about Defi's app and how that works in the show notes. But if you're just getting started, that's a really cool way to do it.
00:42:44.302 - 00:43:03.714, Speaker A: It makes it incredibly easy. But what are you seeing lately? So what kind of returns are we talking about on ETH or with Dai? Caleb? So are we talking like 1% to 2% returns on ETH over, say, a 90 day period? How about Dai? And how does that compare out there to other d five protocol opportunities?
00:43:03.842 - 00:43:34.334, Speaker C: Yeah. In terms of high volatility, the ETH die pool just outperforms everything. And it's not even close. It just outperforms kind of holding ETh in many, many cases. And you can look at the historical returns to see where this kind of breaks down. But ultimately, in some cases, it is possible that if you had held your deposit separately, or if you had held your ETH separately, you would have done better than the pool. And like today, that's the case.
00:43:34.334 - 00:44:04.266, Speaker C: So over the past 30 days, you actually would have done better to just hold ETH than be an ETH die liquidity provider. But if you look back kind of historically and over long periods of time, there's no question that Uniswap EtH die is a much better option for certain users. So the returns that we're talking about kind of vary, and over long periods of time, we're talking better returns than what's possible in lending protocols, for example.
00:44:04.368 - 00:44:29.780, Speaker A: So over a long period of time, what you're essentially doing is you're taking a bet on the transaction volume of Uniswap because every time there's a Uniswap trade, you earn a portion of the fees you earn like 0.3%, right. So you're betting at some level on Uniswap over the long run, but over the short run, it's sort of a gamble based on the volatility of ETH, right?
00:44:30.710 - 00:45:43.846, Speaker C: That's right. And if you look at, we spoke about impermanent loss, and if you kind of look over the race that liquidity providers are looking at is, am I going to earn enough in fees to cover whatever impermanent loss happens to me over a certain period? And if you look over a long enough period, in theory, you'll have infinite trading fees that you collect, and your impermanent loss will be reasonable. And so over an infinite period, you could say that, okay, well, this is definitely going to outperform, but obviously infinite is a really long time. But even if you look at over the last 90 days compared to ETH, so if you provided liquidity 90 days ago and you cashed it out today, you would have earned an equivalent APR of 60% on top of or above holding ETH. So in ETH terms, these are very good returns. And I think that's the underlying theme that's common in all of these pools, is that the longer you hold and the longer that you're a liquidity provider, the more fees you can collect and kind of even out the short term variance of the price ratio of the assets.
00:45:44.038 - 00:46:30.122, Speaker B: So we've been talking about impermanent loss and using Uniswap as an investment tool, providing liquidity to various token pairs in order to collect that fee and get a passive return on your income. But there are other ways and other reasons to provide liquidity. And at realty, for example, every time we release a property, we put it on Uniswap, but then we also seed it with our own liquidity. And we don't do that looking because we're looking for a return. We're looking to do that simply to provide liquidity. And one of the really powerful things about Uniswap is its permissionless ability to list an asset, and then also its permissionless ability to provide liquidity. Can you just comment on that?
00:46:30.256 - 00:47:05.906, Speaker C: Oh, absolutely. Uniswap has over 2000 liquidity pools, and that number on a daily basis is just growing. And the idea is that anybody can come through and list an asset. And what you guys have done with realty is really amazing. Even in your case, that's an asset that has a whitelist and has kind of a permission set up, and it just kind of works with Uniswap. And so you don't have to give up your permission logic in your token to make it work with Uniswap. And that's a really amazing thing.
00:47:05.906 - 00:47:59.750, Speaker C: And so there are a number of tokens like that that just kind of work with Uniswap really well. And what we kind of see is that users have started to sell goods and services on the network. And one of the early examples of this was from the Uniswap team itself, who sold socks in a token called Sox in order to kind of raise a little bit of money for their company. So what they did is they minted 500 socks tokens, added a little bit of eth, and then let this limited edition good go off and start trading. Of course, the token could always be redeemed for physical socks, but what's happened is maybe more amazing than that. The price here just kind of went up, and at the moment, socks cost quite a bit. And so what started at $12 is now in the hundreds of dollars for a pair of socks.
00:47:59.750 - 00:49:07.766, Speaker C: As initial liquidity providers, the team is just earning fees on each of these trades. But what's amazing is more that they produced this limited edition good and then immediately went and found the market for it. And naturally, the price of a limited edition good just kind of went up and up and up with demand until some of the first buyers, who maybe bought it at $12, decided to sell it at like 40, $8120 to other people who wanted to hold these limited edition goods. So if you're talking about something like price Discovery on limited edition goods, this is an amazing tool to do it, because as there's more demand and as there's more purchases, the price goes up. And so you kind of find out what the real price of this limited edition good should be or can be. Many teams have kind of followed in suit, and in fact, we've seen people selling their time, or even things like retweets or legal advice or whatever the case is. And so there are many of these kind of goods and services now available on Uniswap.
00:49:07.766 - 00:50:24.030, Speaker C: And I think that that's why we're seeing a lot of new markets created and quite a lot of innovation in the space. One of my favorites is the cafe token, which is a limited edition batch of coffee that was pre sold on Uniswap. And then the tokens themselves could be redeemed for bags of coffee beans and that type of coming up with a product making a token for it, adding it on Uniswap and instantly getting a market for your goods is really incredible and really amazing, and one of a key feature that makes this protocol work really well for maybe the long tail of assets who otherwise, maybe this could have been too much work to set up an online store, or they didn't want to quite go through the process of signing up for credit card payments or whatever the case is. Instead, they create tokenized assets, add them on Uniswap, and then collect their sales in ETH. And then over the long term, if that asset is really popular and trades a lot, they also just keep on collecting trading fees, which is incredible.
00:50:24.190 - 00:50:43.210, Speaker B: So how does this compare to bootstrapping liquidity on something like binance or a centralized exchange, an order book based exchange? If the Unisox team, Uniswap with their unisox, wanted to get liquidity for their sox token, how would they even do that? Was that even possible before Uniswap?
00:50:43.710 - 00:51:34.620, Speaker C: Very difficult. And I think at the time with that Uniswap is coming out, we were hearing stories of token listings costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. And compare that to maybe $2 worth of gas that you pay to create one of these markets, maybe a handful of ETH and tokens that you minted to get the market started. I mean, from that aspect, it's really amazing what's possible here. I think that when it does come to kind of bootstrapping networks, there have been a few teams that have done it really well. And to be honest, maker and the maker, token and the dai token used Uniswap as one of the primary kind of liquidity vehicles. So in a time before these tokens were listed everywhere, Uniswap had some of the deepest liquidity and still has some of the deepest liquidity for.
00:51:36.590 - 00:52:53.362, Speaker A: I want to sort of test this thesis with you, Caleb, and you too, David. So I was trying to think, Uniswap has really taken off like a rocket as a DFI protocol, like just growing massively. Its volume in March was incredible, I think, beyond what a lot of people expected. So the question is, why was it so successful? Why is it kind of this ten x improvement from alternatives? And one reason I came up with, so at first I thought, well, maybe it's because it's more decentralized, more censorship resistant, and those things are true. But the one thing that sticks out to me and everything that you were just talking about is its permissionlessness. So the fact that anybody can list a token on the exchange, it's almost reminiscent of the early Internet where you had closed platforms like AOL, where you have to ask their permission to sort of list websites. Or in the Yahoo directory, someone kind of lists a website versus the open Internet, which lets anyone publish a website anywhere at any time.
00:52:53.362 - 00:53:15.766, Speaker A: And then the best websites essentially rise to the top. It creates this long tail of really interesting niche websites, but also this constant churn of the most successful websites rising this top. Uniswap almost does that with assets. And I think the key part about it is permissionlessness. What do you think about that, Caleb?
00:53:15.958 - 00:54:00.694, Speaker C: Yeah, I do agree. And I think what Uniswap has done quite well is made it really simple to go through these steps of creating a permissionless market. And permissionless doesn't just mean mean. It does in a sense. But the other aspect of having a permissionless market is that it's extremely easy to integrate uniswap into other products. And so what we've seen is one of the driving factors in Uniswap's growth in terms of volume is definitely its ability for other projects to integrate it and facilitate and send trades to Uniswap in order to make their own platforms better and improve their own user experiences.
00:54:00.822 - 00:55:13.522, Speaker A: I think what you're saying, Caleb, is that Uniswap almost exists as this infrastructure for other money protocols. It's almost like we've talked in a couple of episodes about some of these money protocols, DeFi protocols being almost like emergent organisms. And UniswAp is almost an emergent organism that eats assets like ETH and DAi, for example, and spits out liquidity. And then it provides that liquidity as a pool for all of the other DeFi protocols. So what you're saying is all the other DeFi protocols can tap into them and then bootstrap their own liquidity, have a censorship resistant, unstoppable way, essentially to trade assets. And that's all been added into the Ethereum superstructure, as David would call it, like this kind of super organism. Now, not only do we have a store of value reserve asset like ether, we also have a liquidity machine, a liquidity robot on top of that that is also unstoppable in the same way that Ethereum is.
00:55:13.522 - 00:56:07.278, Speaker A: Now. I want to dig into that, though, like censorship resistant and unstoppable, because we talked in an episode about the DeFi trust spectrum, and we talked about Uniswap being on sort of the far end of the most decentralized and the most autonomous side of the defi trust system spectrum, because it really is kind of just code, and it doesn't require human intervention or human governance to run. But I want to ask you, Caleb, is Uniswap really autonomous and really unstoppable? And things like the user interface or the team, or even the Uniswap IO or exchange, excuse me, domain name, are those vectors of centralization, and could those be stopped?
00:56:07.454 - 00:56:52.350, Speaker C: The Uniswap smart contracts and the Uniswap factory cannot be stopped. There's nothing in it that there's no button that somebody can press to turn off those smart contracts. We did see that the Uniswap team restricted access to their website and their exchange system to a certain list of countries. But what happened in the days following was really amazing to see. So different community members around published their own versions of Uniswap on ipfs and made those available on ipfs. So the underlying smart contracts, there's no off button, there's no off switch or anything like that. It's just that the website, in this case Uniswap exchange, was restricting access to some countries.
00:56:52.350 - 00:57:53.390, Speaker C: But then, of course, what happens is that the website was then made available on ipfs, and where it's extremely redundant and essentially available for everybody. I think that's an amazing property. I probably disagree that there is some choice that users are making. And so I would have to say that Uniswap only runs forever if liquidity providers are there, kind of accepting the deal of providing liquidity in exchange for trading fees. And so in some cases, there is this human element of deciding, should I put my liquidity in this pool? In that pool? Should I support this project by adding liquidity or whatever the case is. So I wouldn't say that it's devoid of human decisions or something like that. I think that we see a lot of human decisions based on what pools are the deepest and winning kind of the liquidity race.
00:57:53.390 - 00:58:49.458, Speaker C: Because at the end of the day, if every liquidity provider withdrew their liquidity, then that would essentially stop a Uniswap pool. But that is a decision that would be a collective one that everyone makes and not a forced decision, like an administrator withdrawing everybody's tokens or something like that. And it makes an extremely interesting thing to watch as Uniswap version two comes out, which is that the team themselves cannot force people to upgrade. If they want people to move to a version two, they have to make a more compelling product that people actually want to move away from version one to version two. And so they've actually kind of said themselves, version one is going to live forever. It's always going to be there. And at the end of the day, it's up to users to decide, will this thing live on as a public good, or will they move their liquidity attention and trading elsewhere?
00:58:49.554 - 00:59:37.830, Speaker B: So you said that there is some human component to it, because ultimately it's humans that are choosing to provide liquidity. But I'm actually going to push back on that and say that the rewards or the returns offered by uniswap turn people. It forces people's hand. And so while there is a human ultimately hitting the deposit button, Uniswap actually creates incentives to force the hand of people. So at the end of the day, all blockchain systems are human systems. Right? Like, even with bitcoin, you have to choose to run your own node. But with Uniswap, I want to get into both the topic of uniswap as a dao and also uniswap as this perpetually growing feedback loop.
00:59:37.830 - 01:00:17.534, Speaker B: The original definition of a Dow is something with humans at the periphery and code at the center. And the code at the center has this inherent feedback loop where some people decide to just come and deposit some liquidity. And that makes some people come and decide to trade, which gives those liquidity providers returns, which those returns incentivize further liquidity, further liquidity deposits, which then allows for a wider participant pool of people to come and trade on Uniswap without severe slippage.
01:00:17.582 - 01:00:17.938, Speaker C: Right.
01:00:18.024 - 01:00:55.918, Speaker B: The more liquidity inside of Uniswap, the more viable it is for larger and larger people. And then when larger and larger people come to Uniswap, there's more trading fees going to Uniswap, which incentivizes further liquidity deposits. And then that in turn, feeds back into itself and allows for further people to make more trades on Uniswap. And so while I think that, of course, everything has this human element, this internal mechanism, I think, forces people's hands and almost promises the growth of uniswap as an application. Do you agree with that?
01:00:56.084 - 01:01:47.440, Speaker C: Yeah, I do. So I really buy into Uniswap being some kind of a dao like structure. But ultimately, what you're describing is a virtuous circle where as long as traders show up, liquidity providers will be there to accept their trading fees. And in this case, the parameters that Uniswap kind of guessed for trading fees and everything else were suitable enough to actually grow these markets into really substantial infrastructure and really substantial liquidity pools, and as a public good. So I think it's just been incredible to watch the growth of Uniswap and watch these virtuous circles work themselves out and work themselves up for the most popular Uniswap markets. It's really stunning to watch happen in kind of almost real time here.
01:01:47.810 - 01:02:17.298, Speaker A: One thing we haven't talked about is how other experiments like this have been tried in the past. So maybe a couple to reflect on. Caleb. So the first was Bancor, which actually had a similar concept as Uniswap. Why was Uniswap more successful, and why did its growth accelerate? Well, bancors sort of stayed stagnant. Do you think?
01:02:17.484 - 01:03:01.778, Speaker C: Yeah. At some point very soon after launch, this little project with a unicorn emoji logo started getting daily trading volumes, like above this massive ICO project. Bancor. Ultimately, the two technologies are quite similar, and the two product offerings are quite similar. But for me, I think that the difference lies in how easy it was to start pools on Uniswap, how easy it was to start providing liquidity and getting to the point of the virtuous circle. Whereas on Bancor, everything was a little bit more difficult, a little bit more restrictive. The code is more difficult to read and parse and integrate into smart contracts.
01:03:01.778 - 01:03:42.370, Speaker C: And I think at the end of the day, if you're looking at the developer community who wants to integrate something, infrastructure should be simple so that it's secure. And I think that is one of the key points of looking at Uniswap. You can see it. You can read the contract in a few hours and figure out, like, yeah, this thing is going to run for a while. I think that's kind of ultimately what made Uniswap really popular initially and got its volumes and kickstarted its volumes. That has now allowed for this long tail of assets to live on its platform and be traded every day.
01:03:42.520 - 01:04:13.306, Speaker A: I definitely like the Uniswap approach, too. I think you said when we were getting started with this that you were attracted to Uniswap because it was a public good. We had just come out of the ICO craze, and bank know, I don't know what they raised. 150,000,000. And here's little Uniswap with a $100,000 grant from the Ethereum foundation creating something that's better. Was it 10,000? It's just some tiny amount. One developer, it's actually Hayden Adams.
01:04:13.306 - 01:04:56.282, Speaker A: I believe it was his first actual software program that he ever built, and he did this and outcompeted $150,000,000 ICO. I think that just shows you that what you need is a good mechanism and simple is better. There are some other decentralized exchange approaches that have been tried on Ethereum that are still in progress and getting some uptake too. But how would you contrast Uniswap and its success to something like the Zero X protocol, which is more of a peer to peer type order book protocol? What's the difference in your mind?
01:04:56.336 - 01:05:52.860, Speaker C: I think order books have places. I'll just say when it comes to a product like Uniswap, where you do trade against a smart contract, it's frictionless. I mean, it really feels like magic the first time that you swap tokens on it. And when it comes to integrating token swaps into smart contracts and into applications, that same frictionless experience exists for developers. So if you're saying like, well, why can't we make an order book exchange that makes everything completely smooth for users? I just think that it's very difficult to compete with a protocol that's built to do one thing in one transaction. And so at the end of the day, the scope of Uniswap is not huge, at least Uniswap version one, the scope is just token swaps and liquidity provision. And it's very good at what it does.
01:05:52.860 - 01:06:09.410, Speaker C: It doesn't overreach or extend, it makes it really quick, simple for users. And I think that is very difficult to compete with and makes an extremely compelling infrastructure layer, whereas with order books, they are just more difficult to use generally.
01:06:10.150 - 01:07:03.870, Speaker A: Yeah, there's this concept, I think, that we've seen repeated in the most successful money protocols, Defi protocols so far. And that is their tendency to pool state together. And when I say state, I mean basically capital pools asset pools together so that you're actually as a user interacting with the contract itself, the capital pool itself, and drawing on that liquidity. Synthetix has done this fairly effectively, Maker has also done this effectively. And it's kind of a contrast to the peer to peer approach that zero X has taken, where for every sell you have to find another peer who's going to buy. With this, the liquidity is always there. So you're just trading with the money robot, you're just trading with the pooled capital.
01:07:03.870 - 01:07:37.962, Speaker A: And it seems like that is a much more scalable way to create these money protocols and maybe why we've seen them be so successful. But is there an upper limit to that? So I think maybe some of our bitcoiner friends might say something like, but yeah, Uniswap is great. It's a nice toy, but the volume is happening on Bitmax, the volume is happening on finance and Coinbase, and it'll never be able to compete against these centralized exchanges. What do you say to that, Caleb?
01:07:38.106 - 01:08:23.354, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, we're kind of celebrating that Uniswap hits 10 million average daily liquidity over March. But I think it's just a different system. It's just not comparing the same thing across both products. And so there is a lot more volume on other products. But for me personally, I don't feel as invested in whatever happens to bitmex and their liquidity or whatever the case is. I don't feel like Bitmex is doing something good for the Ethereum ecosystem the same way that I definitely feel that way about the Uniswap liquidity pools.
01:08:23.482 - 01:09:01.362, Speaker B: So, Caleb, an article came out not too long ago talking about the core mechanism underlying Uniswap. But not just Uniswap, some other very integral defi protocols like balancer and curve finance. And this mechanism has been called a constant function market maker. Now, this isn't exactly a simple algorithm, at least to explain, maybe through a podcast. But I hope you can do your best in explaining the role of a constant function market maker at large, not just through Uniswap, and then kind of maybe explaining the pros and cons of that in comparison to the legacy alternatives.
01:09:01.426 - 01:09:58.620, Speaker C: The constant product market makers are the fancy math behind the curves, the pricing curves that we were talking about earlier. And they are what set the rules that liquidity providers have to trade for. So if you wanted to think about this as the house in a casino game or something like that, imagine that liquidity providers are that house where in a game of blackjack, they abide by certain rules, hit on certain numbers and so on and so forth. In these cases, the constant product market makers are the set of rules that liquidity providers play by in order to facilitate trades for the traders. And in exchange, of course, they get the trading fee, which is like the house edge for providing that liquidity. So in the case of Uniswap, the math behind the constant product market maker is quite simple. So it's x times y equals k.
01:09:58.620 - 01:10:44.490, Speaker C: And the idea is that this constant product of x times y, which is asset a times the balance of asset B in the smart contract, always equals some constant. And so whenever there's a trade, that constant needs to remain the same. And whenever liquidity is added or removed, that constant also needs to be the same. And so the idea is that these are the rules that everyone in the system plays by. In the case of Uniswap, it's a very, very simple calculation. It's designed for two assets, and it's not really designed for more assets. And so now what we're seeing is a very high degree of innovation in terms of the types of pricing curves that are being provided.
01:10:44.490 - 01:12:15.350, Speaker C: We're seeing things like multiple assets being batched together into liquidity pools, and the price being some function of all of those assets, different price ratios. We're seeing things like the pricing curve being amplified at a specific price. So in the case of kind of stable pools, where the two assets are pegged very closely together at a specific price ratio, the curve itself is designed to make better use of the underlying liquidity by kind of flattening itself out around that price target. And so the idea is that who knows if Uniswap got the fee correctly? Who knows if they got the exact math right for this pricing curve? All that we know right now is that it was very simple. And what we're seeing now are alternatives coming along that are more complex and trying to tweak and tune the pricing curve a little bit to meet certain goals. So I think we're just getting started in what I would probably consider, Bancor and Uniswap have been kind of phase one, or year one, even, of liquidity pools. And I think we're just on the cusp of phase two, which are these more complex pricing curves and more bespoke pricing curves to specific sets of assets.
01:12:15.690 - 01:13:03.666, Speaker A: As a kid, Caleb, I used to watch the show called battlebots, right? And it's basically the idea of people design two robots, and one will have a hammer on top that swings, and the other will have a saw of some sort. You put them in a ring like the octagon, and they fight, and you see which one wins. Right? This is kind of what this reminds me of, because essentially, you're taking these math formulas, these constant functions, or constant products, as you call them, and you're putting them in the ring. That ring is the ethereum economy, essentially. And they're fighting. They're all fighting for liquidity, right? They're also helping each other. But ultimately, it's kind of a battle between these bots, between these math functions for liquidity.
01:13:03.666 - 01:13:24.880, Speaker A: And some might do better in some circumstances, say, stablecoins, and others might do better in more general purpose circumstances, say, like Uniswap's very simple function for all assets. It kind of reminds me of that. Am I way off base here? Is that what's going on.
01:13:25.330 - 01:14:30.580, Speaker C: I love that metaphor, and I think that's a perfect way of looking at it. In some cases you want the robot with the hammer, and in other cases you want the robot with the wedge. I think that what we'll see is depending on the asset and the types of assets that are being pulled together, certain protocols will win and certain robots will play well against another type of robot. And then in other cases, we may see that a different protocol wins for a different class of assets. This is one of the more exciting things going on in Ethereum from my point of view. These money robots, I really believe, have a chance of changing how we create markets everywhere, for limited edition goods, for bootstrapping, token network, liquidity, even for initial token sales. And so we're even seeing teams offering their tokens for the first time in almost like a uniswap, initial coin offering type of situation.
01:14:30.580 - 01:15:16.898, Speaker C: For me, I see that there will be a very bright future for these liquidity pools. And at the end of the day, it benefits traders to have a little bit of competition. It benefits the people that are building on top of this infrastructure to have some of this competition. And ultimately the traders will go where they're getting the best prices at the cheapest gas, and the liquidity providers will follow. And then ultimately the developers may follow them, or they might just integrate whatever's easiest. So I think that it's going to be a really interesting next like six months watching these math functions battle it out in the money robot wars. But that's kind of where we are right now.
01:15:16.898 - 01:15:36.626, Speaker C: This is like a particularly exciting point in the journey, and many, many protocols are kind of announcing their version two, including Uniswap. And we're getting to see that next iteration of this financial product that I really believe can be mainstream, which is just incredible, incredibly exciting.
01:15:36.818 - 01:16:37.180, Speaker A: It is super exciting. And I think I just want to emphasize, because we should zoom out for a minute. So what all of this is doing, essentially, is it is adding a permissionless liquidity source as a public good to the Ethereum network and the Ethereum economy. That's the net benefit to the system of Uniswap existing and Uniswap playing its scarcity game, as we've called it in the past, because everyone has an opportunity to trade as a protocol, so no bank required, essentially, anyone has an opportunity to list their asset, again, no exchange, no bank required. Anyone has an opportunity to bootstrap their asset. And this is additive to the Ethereum economy in general. It creates a bankless way to complete all of those money verbs, and it does so as a public good.
01:16:37.180 - 01:17:23.420, Speaker A: And I think we're just beginning to see the secondary effects of what a public good as a liquidity source can do to the Ethereum economy and for these other money protocols, too. So we're just at the cusp. But there's one last thing I think we should talk about here on the subject of public goods. So we've talked about Uniswap so far as being a public good for liquidity, but in uniswap v two, it's doing something else. It can actually be used as a price oracle. And I want to discuss that with you, Caleb. So first, can you talk about what a price oracle is and maybe why it's important?
01:17:24.510 - 01:18:12.042, Speaker C: Sure. So a price oracle is defining a price of the assets using some underlying data. And typically Ethereum knows about Ethereum. It doesn't really know anything else about Ethereum. And so typically these price circles may come from markets external to Ethereum with data that's brought on chain by oracle services. But what Uniswap is proposing is they're saying, look, we know every trade that goes on on Uniswap, they're all on chain, so why don't we just look at the price, and then we'll have this on chain price source where we don't have to worry about if an exchange misrepresents price of an asset or if we miss a transaction bringing that API data on chain or something like that. We don't have to worry about any of that.
01:18:12.042 - 01:19:16.542, Speaker C: It's all sitting right here. Now, teams have previously tried to use Uniswap as a price oracle, and there's been some downsides to doing that or some potential attack vectors to doing that. So one of these attack vectors is essentially if you make a really big trade on Uniswap, you can crash the price of an asset and then use the crash price of an asset to carry out some other transactions elsewhere on the network. And so what Uniswap is proposing in its next version is actually to add some time waiting to its price oracle. So in other words, it wouldn't just be a matter of making one trade, maybe using a flash loan or something like that, but it would actually require a sustained downward pressure on the price to manipulate its on chain price oracle, which is time weighted. So that's kind of the idea that they're proposing. I think it's great that they're branching out into using their trading data for another public good here.
01:19:16.542 - 01:19:35.010, Speaker C: And I'm very, very eager to kind of see what happens with this. I almost see this as they created, obviously, this amazing public good that we're spending so much time on. But I think that this is another one that could ultimately be quite powerful for the network.
01:19:35.430 - 01:20:47.130, Speaker B: So recently we discussed the mechanism of constant function market makers, and one of the many reasons why those things are cool is because every single constant function market maker produces an oracle. And so not only uniswap is an oracle, but also curve is also now an oracle, and balancer is also now an oracle. And then we also discuss the perpetual feedback loop of uniswap growth, where liquidity begets liquidity, you put in liquidity, you incentivize trading to incentivize more liquidity, and all of a sudden uniswap can grow into this very large high liquidity structure. And for things like a constant function market maker that has a large amount of liquidity that produces censorship resistance in the oracle, that same liquidity bootstrapping strapping mechanism also applies to things like balancer. Right. And so maybe if both of these applications grow and grow and grow in liquidity, they're also growing and growing and growing in censorship resistance of that oracle. Do you think that that is the long term solution for the oracle problem inside of the ethereum ecosystem, or is there still a chink in the armor somewhere?
01:20:48.110 - 01:22:18.440, Speaker C: That's kind of the question, and I'm not sure, to be honest. I think that time waiting adds some guarantees in theory, but we've seen some very clever attack vectors. And so if we're talking about kind of building, using this as a core piece of infrastructure or something like that, I think that we're going to see over the next year, two years, three years, if this is a suitable price feed mechanism. In terms of kind of the types of projects that might end up building on this, I think that what we could see are things like prediction markets and decentralized options protocols and things like that, where you really need a strong guarantee on the price of an asset over time, and this may provide it. However, I will say that the security guarantees are just not quite clear to me. And I know that using Uniswap as an oracle has kind of backfired in the past, whether or not that's not really Uniswap's fault, but there have been issues with relying on kind of decentralized pricing from Uniswap that kind of make me nervous for the first few applications. But I do think that as these initial applications roll out, we're going to see some new and cool uses from it.
01:22:18.440 - 01:22:37.434, Speaker C: Ultimately, the main advantage of having it on chain and having it through Uniswap is that it is unstoppable. Sure, but it's also very cheap. And I think that between being unstoppable and being very easy to query, that's where the advantage will be for up and coming infrastructure projects.
01:22:37.562 - 01:23:13.706, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. And the nice thing about oracles is, of course, they can be additive. So if you have a set of oracles and you add an additional oracle, then you can use that and take the average, you can medianize across all of those. So it can kind of add to the decentralization even if it's not used exclusively. So let's finish with this, Caleb. So what's really the end game for Uniswap? How big could this thing really get? And what would the world look like if know won just in terms of.
01:23:13.728 - 01:24:39.990, Speaker C: Asset trading on Ethereum? I think that's a huge goal, to ultimately bring in more volume than, say, centralized exchanges, I think are an easy target. In order to do that, there are definitely some challenges that need to be overcome. But I do think just based on the user experience of Uniswap and the permissionless nature and really the trustworthiness of integrating it into projects because of its permissionless nature, it stands a very good chance at growing quite large. As far as I understand, the end game is that there's obviously a team building this, and I think that they will probably need to be raising money out of Uniswap. So far, there has been no money raised by the team off of the protocol itself, with the exception of selling limited edition goods. And so I think at some point there needs to be some kind of share of these trading fees that go just a little bit beyond the liquidity providers to ensure that Uniswap developers and community developers are motivated to continue growing the ecosystem and innovating in the constant function market maker space. So I believe that that's built in as like an option in unison version two, but set kind of off by default.
01:24:39.990 - 01:25:13.150, Speaker C: But imagine that a lot of the concerns around, I guess, being able to make more transactions through these Uniswap markets, or being able to utilize liquidity better, or being able to support new asset types for liquidity providers in more profitable ways. These are all kind of easy targets for a well funded team to kind of take on. And I think that's kind of the intermediate steps towards taking over the world with liquidity pools.
01:25:13.590 - 01:25:42.282, Speaker A: So maybe a token in the future to fund the public good itself could happen at some point. Caleb, this has been fantastic. Thank you for telling us all about Uniswap. Uniswap is one of the three Defi king protocols that we are talking about in this series. Very exciting stuff. It could definitely grow quite large into the billions, maybe trillions. Know, it's not another question.
01:25:42.282 - 01:25:52.714, Speaker A: It's not crazy. Caleb, can you tell the listeners where to find you on socials? Where to learn more about the analytics projects that you're working on?
01:25:52.832 - 01:26:20.258, Speaker C: Yeah, you can find me at Calebserdon on Twitter and you can visit the website pools, FYI for more information and statistics about liquidity pools, including Uniswap. Those are definitely the two best places to find me online. Thank you very much for having me on. It's really been a pleasure. I really enjoy being able to have the opportunity to speak about Uniswap with you. It's really an honor.
01:26:20.434 - 01:26:49.994, Speaker A: Fantastic. Caleb, thank you for joining us. So actions for our listeners today, we've got some fantastic articles for you to read, one of which Caleb actually wrote that was published on bankless. How to make money on Uniswap. David takes us through Uniswap as an emergent organism, the underlying infrastructure of it. In another article, we also have some material about the rise of liquidity robots, so catch those articles. If you're interested in learning more about Uniswap.
01:26:49.994 - 01:27:22.950, Speaker A: Also, we encourage you to try it out. Go to the Uniswap website. Actually exchange some eth for Dai. Swap some tokens if you're feeling particularly brave. Research the liquidity returns on pools, FYI, that is the site that Caleb and his team put together. It's fantastic for kind of seeing the range of returns that you might expect in each pool. Guys, risks and disclaimers.
01:27:22.950 - 01:27:37.806, Speaker A: Ethereum is risky. Crypto is risky. Uniswap is a risky protocol as well. This is not for everybody. We've told you before, of course, we are headed on the west. This is the frontier. You could lose what you put in.
01:27:37.806 - 01:27:45.770, Speaker A: So be careful out there. But we're thankful you're with us on the journey. Thank you for joining us on bankless, episode ten. Bye.
