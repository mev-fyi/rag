00:00:00.250 - 00:00:00.800, Speaker A: You.
00:00:02.930 - 00:00:03.680, Speaker B: Okay?
00:00:08.190 - 00:00:40.702, Speaker A: Hey, everyone, it's alpha leak time. So this is a special series that David and I do whenever some alpha leakable crypto news dropped. And boy, do we have a big piece of news today. We want to talk about the implications of Uniswap v three. It has finally revealed its details and announced what it intends to package up in v three, including a launch date. So we're going to talk about that and the implications. David, how big of news is this for DFI and for crypto?
00:00:40.846 - 00:01:13.040, Speaker B: I mean, everyone has been anticipating this, right? This has been something that we've all wanted, we have all known has been coming. And also, fun fact about bankless history. The Alpha leak series started with the Uniswap airdrop in the first place. That's right, coming full circle. So that's pretty cool. And so we're going to go ahead and dive into what is uniswap v three and what are the big surprising things about it that we didn't perhaps see coming. And there are definitely some very interesting features about Uniswap v three that I did not expect.
00:01:13.040 - 00:01:18.286, Speaker B: ERc 721 nfts are involved, which is pretty cool.
00:01:18.468 - 00:01:24.450, Speaker A: Well, look, it fits. Everyone's getting in on the NFT. So I guess Uniswap is getting in on the NFTS too, right?
00:01:24.520 - 00:01:45.814, Speaker B: That's exactly right. Yeah. And then there's some other things as well, such as variable liquidity across the amm curve, which really starts to eat into the moats of other amms on ethereum, specifically curve. I'm going to call curve out here. It's like, does curve have the moat anymore after uniswap v three, question mark.
00:01:46.012 - 00:01:53.766, Speaker A: This is the return of the unicorn, David. I thought this was going to be ultrasound money week, but now suddenly, here we are talking about Uniswap.
00:01:53.798 - 00:01:54.406, Speaker B: Well played.
00:01:54.438 - 00:01:55.174, Speaker A: Hayden Adams.
00:01:55.222 - 00:01:55.846, Speaker B: Hard rug pull.
00:01:55.888 - 00:02:18.674, Speaker A: Yeah, rug pull. Okay, so the other thing is, Hayden is coming on the bankless podcast. We are pretty much confirmed in dms. He asked us to dump Mark Cuban for an interview with him. It was a joke. Of course we weren't going to dump Mark Cuban, but now Hayden Adams is coming on the bankless podcast. Hopefully sometime we will be recording that this week.
00:02:18.674 - 00:02:40.234, Speaker A: So stay tuned for that, guys. That will be the exhaustive debrief. What you're getting now in this alpha leak is our unfiltered thoughts on this. We haven't had much time for this to marinate, much time for a conversation around this. You're just getting our unvarnished thoughts. So take that for what it is. We're just reading the announcements and the details here, the same as you.
00:02:40.234 - 00:03:16.034, Speaker A: We will also provide a version of this to bankless premium members in a newsletter segment that we call the Alpha leak. So premium members get that alpha leak. There's a link to become a premium member in the show notes, but you're getting it here live streamed on YouTube. And maybe we'll release this as a podcast episode, too. David, we got to start with the tease because Uniswap and Hayden specifically have been teasing v three for what feels like years. I know that Uniswap hasn't been even around for years, but it feels like that. Here's a tweet from Hayden just earlier.
00:03:16.034 - 00:03:17.158, Speaker A: Was it late last week?
00:03:17.164 - 00:03:51.618, Speaker B: It was last week, Thursday or Friday of last week. And Hayden just goes, if I have to go another week without publicly announcing details of Uniswap v three, I might go insane. Which reading through the lines means it's not going to be another week. It was going to be literally three to four days. And actually, I quote, retweeted this one and said, wow, this really reminds me of that tweet where Hayden tweeted out a picture of the v two uniswap logo and saying, ooh, pretty colors. And then two days later, uniswap v two drops. And so, like, reading between the lines, this was definitely clear that this was coming.
00:03:51.618 - 00:04:13.762, Speaker B: But then we got another tease just yesterday, actually, which is this very dope graphic animation, I guess. And it's a really cool piece of art and it's all uniswap themed. And so this was their reading between the lines. This is how they were wanting to announce the announcement. So here you audio.
00:04:13.826 - 00:04:32.670, Speaker A: I'm sharing it with sound this time. Can you hear that? This is the Uniswap announcement, the team's announcement here. I love whoever put together this video, man. I love the aesthetic. Like, Uniswap's done a really good job from a branding perspective in capturing, like, ethereum's weirdness.
00:04:33.490 - 00:04:36.320, Speaker B: We're in her dms trying to get her to do some stuff.
00:04:36.770 - 00:04:43.060, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. All right, I'm going to stop playing that sound here.
00:04:45.110 - 00:05:24.042, Speaker B: So I thought that was pretty cool. All right. And then hold on, I got to reformat things. And so that was yesterday and then today, which again, like we were saying this week was supposed to be ultrasound money week, but turns out it's Uniswap V three week. So now everyone's talking about Uniswap V three. So let's get into it. What is Uniswap V three? And there's definitely one core standout feature that is standing out from the rest, and that is their concentrated liquidity feature, which is what I was alluding to when I said, does curve have any moat anymore? Maybe that's good background, good context.
00:05:24.042 - 00:06:06.794, Speaker B: Curve is a amm, much like uniswap, but it's a modified amm, whereas the curve of the amm, and of course, amms, automated market makers, the way that amms price things is on a curve, and it's very simple curve. The Uniswap model is this. What are the letters? Like k times x equals y or something? Three variables. It's an exponential curve. We all learned it in middle school math. And what curve did the stablecoin amm curve? It changed that algorithm so that there was a flat part, which allowed for much more capital efficiency. And it could do this because it made this assumption that it was trading, like for like, assets.
00:06:06.794 - 00:06:55.370, Speaker B: So curve really specialized in high liquidity, like for like assets. So USDC to die, WBTC to ren BTC. And that was really its big competitive advantage to Uniswap, because it allowed for that extra capital efficiency. Yet Uniswap V three has boasts this new feature called concentrated liquidity, which does the same. At the end of the day, it's not the same design, but it achieves the same result, which is extremely high liquidity in very tight bands along a trading range. And so in theory, Uniswap V three can provide comparable or even more levels of liquidity for very specific assets, like stablecoins, specifically that curve can match. But therefore, what is curve's moat anymore?
00:06:56.290 - 00:08:03.054, Speaker A: Yeah, the question, I think, or the implication possibly, is that this new Uniswap V three design, rather, is kind of an automated market maker eater, right? Like it's kind of the automated market maker to end all automated market makers. I'm not necessarily saying that's true, but I think part of the design is that you can provide liquidity essentially anywhere along this curve, surgically and surgically. The implication there is maybe you don't need this diversity of other automated market makers as much, or at least they play less of a role. This kind of generalized case can take it all. I actually didn't really understand this concept, I think, until I looked at this video from one of the Uniswap tweets. And here it is. This is the idea of concentrated liquidity, right? So as a liquidity provider, basically you could provide liquidity around a range like a price range.
00:08:03.054 - 00:08:10.830, Speaker A: Right. So what that allows you to do, I think of it almost, David, as like a stop loss. Like I can provide liquidity.
00:08:10.910 - 00:08:12.918, Speaker B: Stop loss, liquidity. Crazy.
00:08:13.004 - 00:08:56.414, Speaker A: Yeah, crazy, right. So I can provide liquidity not for the entire curve, but only around a specific range. I think they have an example here of, let's say I wanted to provide, I've got 5 million, I want to provide 5 million easy 5 million liquidity for the die USDC pair, but only inside of this very narrow band. This very narrow range where Dai trades at the die USDC pair is zero point 95 to 1.5. So a very narrow band I'm providing liquidity for. And I sort of set the parameters for that liquidity. And I put in all of this liquidity.
00:08:56.414 - 00:09:12.742, Speaker A: And the net output, it looks like is there's massive depth in the pool for this narrow band. That's what you're kind of seeing in this graphic. Right? Like look at it go up, you get all of that, right.
00:09:12.796 - 00:10:06.022, Speaker B: And this is really good for specifically people that want to provide liquidity for that one specific band. And for stablecoins, which are. Stablecoins are never ever. Well, they're not supposed to trade at like ten cents or twenty cents or really all the way up to like, if a stablecoin is doing a good job, like $0.95. Stablecoins are supposed to stay in between like ninety five cents and a dollar and five cents and ideally as tight as possible, which means that when you supply eTH, dai or dai USDC, you're supplying liquidity across the full spectrum range when you really shouldn't be. You should only be supplying liquidity within a very tight band and ideally as tight as possible. And this is where I think Uniswap boasted that 4000 x improved capital efficiency.
00:10:06.022 - 00:10:22.174, Speaker B: I think that's what they were talking about. That's what they were referring to. People won't be providing USDC die liquidity below ninety five cents per unit. And they can just concentrate all of that liquidity in such a tiny band. That's really cool. That's really cool.
00:10:22.212 - 00:10:35.346, Speaker A: Yeah. And if you're trading in uniswap, it means you get a massive amount of liquidity depth for that narrow band. And that narrow band is where the majority of the trading is going to consist of too, which is fascinating. Right.
00:10:35.368 - 00:10:58.086, Speaker B: And what I expect this to do is I expect this to basically have no slippage across stablecoins. And I think the fees that people are going to be paying are only going to be gas fees and LP and uniswap exchange fees. I don't for like to like assets. I don't think there will be any slippage on Uniswap.
00:10:58.278 - 00:11:32.402, Speaker A: Yeah, that's the interesting thing. As a liquidity provider, if you're providing liquidity for that narrow band, you're still making the same in terms of liquidity provider fees. Right? Because you make fees based on every single trade. So that's where that comes in, too. But what you were just saying, david, comes across in this line. In version three lps, liquidity providers can approximate any conceivable order book or automated market maker curve by composing multiple positions per what. That's what they're doing here.
00:11:32.402 - 00:11:38.966, Speaker A: Infinite strategies can be efficiently aggregated together into a single pool to form a combined curve that users can trade against.
00:11:39.068 - 00:12:24.774, Speaker B: You know what this tells me, Ryan, is like when the concept of an Amm came out and uniswap really pioneered it, technically, it came before it, but Uniswap really made amms come into the forefront of the conversation. And people like newbies like me, who never really cared for order books, were overjoyed because this is so simple. I just input what I don't want, and I output what I do want. And then boom, boom, we're done. And then my knowledge grew, and I realized, well, order book exchanges are really useful. Amms aren't killing order book exchanges, they're just supplementing them with something else. I think this kills order book exchanges, and not completely, but it does all the same things.
00:12:24.774 - 00:12:41.660, Speaker B: Stop lost liquidity. Providing. That's what an order book is. That is what an order book is. And so, to me, as the infrastructure around concentrated liquidity grows and grows and grows, that is going to take away from order book based exchanges, because it's doing the same thing.
00:12:42.270 - 00:13:23.986, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess the only downside of automated market makers historically have been that they don't have the liquidity depth of centralized exchanges. And that was particularly true when Uniswap came out in 2018. Right. There would be some pretty hefty slippage fees before they built up the liquidity. What this is creating is this ultimate incentive for liquidity providers to provide this massive depth of liquidity on these narrow bands of the curve. This is another way they kind of illustrate it as a liquidity provider. It used to be in the previous Uniswap version, you could only enter this entire curve.
00:13:23.986 - 00:14:04.930, Speaker A: Right. You have to provide liquidity for the full curve, but with v three, you can enter in any sort of portion, and you really get to decide whether what band, what area on the curve you want to enter into, which is going to essentially juice the returns and decrease the risk for liquidity providers. At the end of the day, that's what uniswap is. It's like a liquidity monster. It's like eating up as much liquidity as it can. And as it gets this liquidity, like liquidity is very much a power law game, and liquidity begets liquidity. It just gets stronger and stronger and stronger.
00:14:04.930 - 00:14:12.390, Speaker A: So I see this as a massive upgrade for anyone who wants to provide liquidity to uniswap.
00:14:12.970 - 00:14:56.470, Speaker B: There's a comment in the bankless YouTube that says that. Wouldn't this mean that there's a lot less liquidity at the extremes of the curve, forcing the prices to become more volatile? So that's definitely something to take into account. Prices inside of a band will be very stable, but if they get outside of the band, they could do something crazy. And I'm kind of reminded of Wall street bets type behavior where people will focus in and say, like, well, if we can get the price to move out of the band, all of a sudden it'll jump to something like crazy just because the liquidity just stops. And all of a sudden, like an extra $100 of buying pressure moves the price by some x number of percentages. I think there's going to be a lot of gains that are played with this mechanism.
00:14:56.970 - 00:15:43.314, Speaker A: Yeah, it's fascinating just to try to walk through how this might operate in the real world, and if people will kind of see that liquidity on chain and try to break it in various cases. But it definitely means that at the edges of the curve, the less frequently traded parts of the curve, you're going to get a lot less liquidity. Right. It's going to be kind of staggered. Prado principle 80 20 rule inside of these more narrow bands. But of course, if people are trading out on the left and way out on the right side of the curve, they're paying a lot more, a lot higher slippage fees as well. So I feel like that's the big surprise.
00:15:43.314 - 00:16:43.246, Speaker A: This is kind of a redesign of the entire concept of uniswap and the entire concept of automated market makers. It's really kind of a revolutionary idea here. But the big pieces are this idea of concentrated liquidity where you can kind of make bets as a liquidity provider at any point along this band. That's big idea one and then big idea two sort of falls out of that, which is as a result, you get massive amounts of liquidity. For these bands, and you get massive capital efficiency gains here. So this talks about the capital efficiency gains max out at 4000 x for lps, adding liquidity in a really tight band like zero point 10%. And that's why I think it makes sense for you to talk about curve, because that is an entire, I guess, protocol, defi protocol that maximizes curve that's most appropriate for stablecoins.
00:16:43.246 - 00:16:47.820, Speaker A: Right? And now Uniswap can essentially replicate that, or it seems like it.
00:16:49.150 - 00:17:33.222, Speaker B: This is, that's exactly right. And like, I don't, I don't understand this does that same thing of having a curve that's not just an exponential curve, but is shaped as exactly what the market needs it to be shaped as, just to provide. Like maybe they will make. Maybe for whatever reason, you have an asset, and that asset is typically either $100 or $200, but for some weird reason, it's never $150. And I don't know why an asset would do this, but people can get creative in DFI. And so liquidity providers can just stay providing liquidity around $200 or around $100, and nothing in between. And a lot of games can be played like that.
00:17:33.222 - 00:18:06.100, Speaker B: A lot of interesting assets can be expressed like that. And so what that is, that's like curve, if it had two flat spots on the curve, or n number of liquidity points along the curve. And so it's really changing that. X times k equals y, I think, is the right equation. Really what that's doing is that's manipulating that curve of liquidity to exactly what the market needs. And the liquidity providers will figure out what that optimum shape is because they are profit maximized. And that's what their incentive is.
00:18:06.470 - 00:18:34.662, Speaker A: Yeah. The market gets to decide now the right spot on the curve, which is super cool, because Uniswap V one with automated market makers, it really brought the market's ability to decide the liquidity depth of any particular asset. Right. So completely permissionless. Any asset can be listed. Anybody can publish their asset on Uniswap. And the market decides what the liquidity profile of these assets are, essentially.
00:18:34.662 - 00:18:58.206, Speaker A: Right. And so the best assets kind of rise to the top. They get the most liquidity, the best monies get the most liquidity. This does that same thing, except for the best curves win, essentially, or the best curves that fit a particular pair of assets. Super cool. But you know what? At the same time, this is probably the meat of the story. Right? And the meat of the innovation.
00:18:58.206 - 00:19:12.754, Speaker A: But there's also more here, by the way. There's an entire white paper that David and I have not gone through with all of the details behind this, including kind of all of the math. We'll include a link in the show notes to that too, if you dare.
00:19:12.802 - 00:19:14.280, Speaker B: Enter a white paper.
00:19:14.650 - 00:19:51.042, Speaker A: We're just trying to summarize this for you at the high level, but let's go through a few other things. This is actually from our alpha alert that we're going to issue to bankless premium subscribers, but we'll go over a few of the tldrs. The first two we sort of talked about, David. So what is included in this uniswap thing? Concentrated liquidity and capital efficiency. Those are the major innovation points. But the third, I think is almost as exciting for all of Defi, which is Uniswap is going to be deploying this on optimism. Optimism, of course, is a layer two.
00:19:51.042 - 00:20:10.890, Speaker A: That means it's ethereum secured roll up. Right. So they're not just going to put this on main net. The date, by the way, Uniswap is targeting a v three launch on May 5 with an optimism deployment. They say shortly thereafter, which to me they don't have a date, but shortly thereafter. Is that weeks?
00:20:11.040 - 00:20:14.714, Speaker B: Well, they can't announce for optimism, so they have to wait for.
00:20:14.752 - 00:20:26.974, Speaker A: Right. There's some dependencies there. But how big of a deal is this? And what are the implications of Uniswap deploying to a roll up like optimism? Right.
00:20:27.012 - 00:21:03.994, Speaker B: So there's a lot of content producers like bankless or Anthony Cesano's daily Quay or into the ether or anyone talking about optimism. And l two s are coming and they're going to blow everyone's minds. And people are like, oh, okay, cool. I wonder what that means. What that means is that Uniswap feels like Coinbase or Robinhood, or it's centralized exchange level of performance and user experience with a decentralized level of security. And so we retain the values of decentralization, which there's infinitely long hours of conversations as to why the values of decentralization are important.
00:21:04.192 - 00:21:08.362, Speaker A: And by the way, practically that means you can exit without anyone's permission, right?
00:21:08.416 - 00:21:32.770, Speaker B: Yes. You always have custody of your funds. You can always leave and do whatever you want with your funds. No one can ever do anything with your funds that you don't want them to. Self sovereignty, permissionlessness, going bankless, blah, blah, blah, blah. What optimism is doing and what Uniswap is doing is like, well, all of those fees that people are bummed about paying because it costs like $30 to make a trade on Uniswap, it goes from $30 to maybe three cents or pennies. It goes to pennies.
00:21:32.770 - 00:22:10.690, Speaker B: And also the order goes through instantly, as it does when you trade on Coinbase or through finance. Getting your money into the optimistic l two will take one transaction, and that will cost your typical ethereum transaction, maybe 30, depending on how fast you want it to be. Maybe twenty dollars to forty dollars. And then once you're on optimism, it's just like you sent your money to coinbase or you sent your money to finance, and then you can trade infinitely 1000 times a second, do whatever you want, because that's what the power of optimism is. And so all of these cool features that we're talking about on the Uniswap main chain is just going to be replicated on uniswap. On optimism.
00:22:11.590 - 00:22:44.582, Speaker A: Yeah, so, exactly. Right. A couple of thoughts there. So the one is, it's awesome that roll ups are here, right? They're here enough for Uniswap to be able to deploy on them. It's interesting, the strategy that Uniswap is taking, because it's kind of like 1ft on the shore and then another in the sea, right? So it's like they're deploying on Mainnet, they're going to live on Mainnet, but they're also going to live on this optimism roll up. So it's not one or the other, it's like both. But this is a contrast from the way some other DeFi protocols have chosen to deploy.
00:22:44.582 - 00:23:20.834, Speaker A: So we talked in one of our weekly rollups, David, about sushi Swap's deployment strategy. And it was like shotgun approach. Where are you going to deploy? We're going to deploy everywhere. We're going to deploy to matic or we're going to deploy to polygon, Xdai, Binance, smart chain, like Polkadot, anywhere that we will be. Yeah, no, we're not making any concentrated bets here. We're just going to go where everywhere, and we'll see what the market decides. Uniswap is taking a very, I would say, eth first, maybe even, you might argue, decentralization first strategy.
00:23:20.834 - 00:24:02.082, Speaker A: And they are leading the way. And they're saying, like, we're picking optimistic rollups secured by Ethereum, and that's their strategy. This is not a shotgun at all. It's also interesting that they've picked optimism and roll up specifically because we talked about this in the past, David. But, like, layer two is very much a coordination game for D five protocols, right? So Uniswap in an optimistic roll up isn't going to be very interesting unless there's a lot of ERC 20 tokens inside of that roll up and a lot of liquidity inside of that roll up. And honestly, a lot of other D five protocols joining the party. Right.
00:24:02.082 - 00:24:48.738, Speaker A: So Uniswap is saying, hey, Manhattan is busy, so we're going to build out in the suburbs. We're going to build out in Brooklyn a little bit, but this is a signal to say, join the party. Unless other DeFi protocols join them on the optimistic roll up, then it's going to be a lonely place. I feel like the market was almost waiting for Uniswap to make the move. And why Uniswap? Well, 53% of all DFI trading volume, right? One of the highest market cap DFI token. Kind of a leader in many respects, a flag bearer in many respects. And I feel like the market's waiting for Uniswap to make its move before it decides which roll up to support.
00:24:48.738 - 00:24:55.730, Speaker A: And maybe this is the push that everyone else needs to get to an optimistic roll up and join the party.
00:24:55.810 - 00:25:28.794, Speaker B: Well, we also need optimism to actually launch so that the party can actually start. That is an important variable as well. Optimism has just increasingly become the shelling point. So I do think, and it hasn't even launched, and maybe it's too early to say, but I kind of think the cats, it's already determined it's going to be basically optimism and maybe the starkware ZK roll ups. And so I don't really have any concerns that these defi protocols won't be able to coordinate just over time. I think it's all just going to. The party's going to start on optimism.
00:25:28.794 - 00:25:40.094, Speaker B: Also, people that we are in the dms of trying to get on the bankless podcast. And so hopefully that follows right after the Uniswap podcast with Hayden. Where do you want to go to next, Ryan?
00:25:40.222 - 00:26:08.606, Speaker A: Let's keep going. So those are, I think, the three big pieces, right? Concentrated liquidity, capital efficiency that that brings, and then they're deploying on layer two on optimism. Let's talk about this. Flexible fees. So Uniswap V three has different fee tiers per pool, and it really depends on the volatility per pool. So that spans from 0.5% to 0.3%
00:26:08.606 - 00:26:32.334, Speaker A: and 1%, depending on the volatility. In version one, you didn't have that option. Essentially, you have a standard, less flexible fee. So that is a difference, again, providing some more customizability and some more I guess optionality and determining the market preference from liquidity providers. So, flexible fees is another feature here.
00:26:32.392 - 00:26:59.134, Speaker B: Interesting that they already picked out three and then locked you into only three rather than. Why is this not a number that you can input? That's what balancer lets you do. Specifically curve the highly liquid AmM for stablecoins and other like assets. They have that 0.5% swap fee. So it makes sense that we can now choose more optimum fees for our trading pairs. But why not just make this a parameter? I don't know.
00:26:59.134 - 00:27:00.618, Speaker B: Something we'll have to ask Hayden.
00:27:00.794 - 00:27:07.194, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's a great question. And let's continue moving on. I think this is important. Uniswap protocol fee.
00:27:07.242 - 00:27:10.818, Speaker B: So, in v one for uni token holders, money.
00:27:10.904 - 00:27:11.250, Speaker A: Okay.
00:27:11.320 - 00:27:12.050, Speaker B: Revenue.
00:27:12.550 - 00:27:41.894, Speaker A: Uniswap introduced a 0.5% governance cut in v two, like the parameter, but it was never turned on. V three introduces governance fees on a per pool basis. So that's one distinction, not just doing it for the entire Uniswap platform. Every pool will have a different protocol fee. That could be between 10% and 25% of LP fees. So all fees will be turned off by default.
00:27:41.894 - 00:28:13.778, Speaker A: They're not turning them on, but governance, uni governance will be able to vote on these fees to turn them on or not. So, this is something we've talked about since May, since before defi summer of last year. The idea that governance tokens will vote to bring cash flows into their token economics. This is another step down that path. Everyone's asking, like, Uniswap's, Uni's valuation, what's that based on? If it's just a governance. Not just a. It's a governance protocol that's going to.
00:28:13.784 - 00:28:16.040, Speaker B: Add cash flows, pay you money.
00:28:16.490 - 00:28:34.506, Speaker A: That's why it's valuable. That's what's happening. It's turning into a capital asset. And anyone who holds Uni tokens is incented to vote on these capital assets. I'm wondering if we did some basic. Look, our analyst, Lucas Campbell. Shout out, man.
00:28:34.506 - 00:28:37.902, Speaker A: He did some basic napkin math on.
00:28:38.036 - 00:28:41.054, Speaker B: Never before seen napkin math, specifically to.
00:28:41.092 - 00:29:05.494, Speaker A: Bankless viewers, here's the basic napkin math. So he's doing Uniswap protocol earnings. And I suppose this is based on a 10% rate, and then red is a 16, so halfway between 10% and 25%. And you could see sort of the protocol earnings. I guess this is probably yearly time here. 400 annualized? Yeah. Okay.
00:29:05.532 - 00:29:11.126, Speaker B: So between 200 and $400 million on a yearly basis into the protocol. Not bad.
00:29:11.308 - 00:29:13.602, Speaker A: Into the protocol into the capital asset.
00:29:13.666 - 00:29:16.550, Speaker B: Into your pockets if you are a uni token holder.
00:29:16.630 - 00:29:27.742, Speaker A: Well, the crazy thing about this, and people still haven't wrapped their heads around the difference between Coinbase and Uni. But Coinbase has a lot of overhead. That uni just doesn't have no uni.
00:29:27.796 - 00:29:29.790, Speaker B: Export overhead to Ethereum.
00:29:30.290 - 00:29:48.114, Speaker A: 15 employees in code, right? It gets everything out of the box with Ethereum, whereas Coinbase has even. It's more like a bank has thousands of employees, lots of overhead. So anyway, very cool here. Should we talk about the next one?
00:29:48.232 - 00:30:38.290, Speaker B: Yeah, this is the very interesting one. This is going to throw the world of composability in for a tizzy. And so what Uniswap has done, when you typically provide liquidity to uniswap for the eth die pair, for example, you put in equal parts eth and dai, and then you get this LP token, which is another ERC 20 token. And that paradigm that you put in your deposits and you get a receipt, that's also an ERC 20 token. That alone triggered a massive conversation about the power of composability. Dan Elitzer wrote his famous piece superfluid collateral in DFI, because you can take that LP token and lock that up as collateral in things like maker Dow and Maker Dow has recently done this. There are ERC 20 lp tokens as collateral in Makerdao, which allows you to draw debt against it.
00:30:38.290 - 00:31:30.194, Speaker B: What uniswap V three has done is because of that more surgical inserting of liquidity across a specific band. In order to enable that feature, they needed to turn their LP tokens into nfts. Because if you are providing liquidity for ETH die, between $1,800 and $2,200 ether, that is not the same parameters as somebody else who is providing liquidity between 1000 and $10,000 ether. Those are different parameters. And so those parameters, I'm pretty sure this is the way this works, those parameters gets baked into the NFT, and those unique constructs are part of that NFT. And so what that means is that not all eth die liquidity positions are the same. And all of these LP tokens, which are now nfts, are not one to one, tradable in the same way that they previously were.
00:31:30.194 - 00:31:44.838, Speaker B: Which means accepting these things as collateral into other DeFi protocols will take more overhead and take more custom engineering to really get that done. And so it's really going to be interesting to see all these defi protocols have to wrestle with this for sure.
00:31:44.924 - 00:33:02.862, Speaker A: What you just said is that customization, there's actually a trade off here, right? Because with that customization that the LP gets to enter at any point on the curve, what we lose is fungibility, the ability to exchange all of these liquidity pair positions one for another. Now, my question is, what are the downstream implications of this? Right. The first is nfts are there's going to be a whole lot more nfts on Ethereum, that's for sure. Imagine every single liquidity provider that deposits anything into Uniswap getting an NFT, right? And so what's going to happen to all these nfts? Are there going to be ways to trade them individually? Where does something like immutable x, which is creating kind of a layer two for nfts, where does that come in? Will there be ways to tranche these nfts together and convert them back into more fungible ERC 20s? I'm betting the answer to all of these things is yes. And that's probably maybe the gamble with work, but maybe that's the gamble or the trade off that uniswap is making for this, because this is the aspect I don't love about the new design. I'm just wondering what the implications will be for it.
00:33:02.916 - 00:33:24.874, Speaker B: Right, yeah. And to be honest, we never really saw the composability of LP tokens really take off. We only really got a hint of it with uniswap V two. And by the way, uniswap V two will still be a thing. And so if the market really wants those LP tokens to be ERC 20 tokens, they can still have that, because uniswap V two will never go away. Uniswap V one is still here. People still trade on uniswap V one.
00:33:24.874 - 00:34:08.994, Speaker B: For whatever reason, NFTX has done a fantastic job of producing liquidity across nfts. So, like, crypto punks have liquidity. So you could simply just put in one ether and then you can get this token that represents cryptopunk liquidity at aggregate. And cryptopunks are unique. There are like, I don't know how many, 40,000 unique cryptopunks. And so perhaps there's a roundabout way to solve this in the back end, where we go with ERC 20 tokens into Uniswap, mince an NFT version of an LP, and then all of these different NFT LP tokens are then recoalesced back into a platform like NFTX to produce out another ERC 20 token. It sounds complicated.
00:34:08.994 - 00:34:18.118, Speaker B: It sounds like a lot of work, but people in DFI do stuff like that. People tinker. And so maybe this solution is solvable.
00:34:18.294 - 00:34:54.338, Speaker A: And I have a sense that some of that experimentation might happen on the optimistic roll up where gas prices are really low. Right. Some of that innovation can live there. Let's keep going. So there are a lot of advantages to Uniswap, the money, Lego or the system, but there's also like system wide Ethereum and system wide defi advantages that we're getting out of this. And one is more advanced oracles. Right? So Uniswap has famously been kind of like providing an oracle service to the rest of defi.
00:34:54.338 - 00:35:54.138, Speaker A: And it's a very censorship resistant oracle service because it's based on some code, Uniswap code, that cannot be stopped itself. So it has some advantages that chainlink and off chain sort of oracle services that are feeding data in internally do not have. So what we want out of this whole defi system is the most censorship resistant, unstoppable set of oracles possible. Right, because Oracle's price feeds provide everything we need. They provide data for synthetics, they provide an underlying primitive that the rest of DFI can use. And it looks like I haven't gone into all of the details here, but the Uniswap V three upgrade is going to provide a big boost to its Oracle service, making it possible to calculate any recent time weighted value within the past nine days. I'm actually previously, it sounds like it's been like less than nine days.
00:35:54.138 - 00:36:00.314, Speaker A: So this gives a longer history to provide a price feed oracle based on.
00:36:00.432 - 00:36:28.306, Speaker B: Yeah, and I think there's just overall just more robustness about the infrastructure of the Uniswap. Oracle just making it more consumable by other defi apps. And I think that's really the key innovation. It's a developer usability feature, and we need internal oracles to come out of Ethereum. And Oracle is really, really important if we want to maintain our self sovereignty. Right, because so many of these defi applications need price feeds to operate. Makerdao needs it.
00:36:28.306 - 00:37:23.298, Speaker B: Aave compound anything with collateral needs a price. So it's really defi or Ethereum is trying to ask the question, what are these assets worth? And they don't really know the answer to that question without an oracle. And historically, ethereum or defi at large has had to ask that question externally, as in like, hey, Coinbase or hey, finance or hey, chain link, what is this worth? And now instead things can ask uniswap, what is this worth? And like you said, that was a feature of uniswap v two. This is not brand new in uniswap v three, but it seems to be that the infrastructure around this oracle is just better. And so what that tells me is that this is making DFI more buildable because we have censorship resistant oracles out of uniswap. And especially as Uniswap is growing to the amounts of volumes that it is competing with Coinbase, that makes actually the oracle more resistant to attack.
00:37:23.384 - 00:37:23.634, Speaker A: Right.
00:37:23.672 - 00:37:41.260, Speaker B: Because somebody might be able to just drain the order book on Coinbase and then all of a sudden the Coinbase oracle reports a very weird number and that triggers a bunch of events in defi black swan risk. The more volume we can put through Uniswap, the more censorship resistant these oracles can become.
00:37:41.790 - 00:38:04.686, Speaker A: Makes the oracle stronger. Liquidity is key here. So it's all this great feedback loop. Let's talk about this, too. So gas efficiency, so everything with the above upgrades we talked about, v three swaps are actually cheaper than v two. Now, I don't think this means significantly cheaper, but the fact that they are cheaper at all is pretty cool. Seems to me to be an amazing accomplishment.
00:38:04.686 - 00:38:41.438, Speaker A: A pretty cool accomplishment. It also tells me that it's a competitive advantage to be on main net and to offer trading at the lowest possible gas fee. That just in itself, if you're going to operate in Manhattan, that in itself is a competitive advantage. And I think that something that other automated market makers are going to have to compete with Uniswap on if they want to garner liquidity. So that's pretty cool. Like, Uniswap already did a pretty good job of this. It's always been one of the cheapest places to trade from a gas perspective, and it seems like they're just continuing that.
00:38:41.524 - 00:39:08.674, Speaker B: Yeah, this is definitely a point of diminishing returns, I would say. I'm not an expert on gas, but I'm going to go ahead and guess that this increase efficiency by somewhere between five to 15%, somewhere in that range. It's not cutting it down by 90%. It's not an l two, it's just optimizations. And a Uniswap V two was already pretty well optimized. So the fact that they are even able to boast even further optimizations is pretty cool. But this is not a new paradigm in gas.
00:39:08.674 - 00:39:21.610, Speaker B: It's still going to be as roughly as expensive as what people have been used to. But just like Ryan said, being able to be competitive with making the same trades, but with less gas versus competitors is important as infrastructure.
00:39:22.270 - 00:39:29.194, Speaker A: Now here's one. So this is part of the TLDR, is the license. Interesting? This is meat based stuff.
00:39:29.232 - 00:39:31.118, Speaker B: This is not defi protocol stuff.
00:39:31.284 - 00:40:25.066, Speaker A: Yeah. So there's a piece hidden in the original post that talked about the licensing. And here's kind of how I understand this. As we write this, there's some kind of debate on Twitter going back and forth as to what this means, but it looks like V three will be released under a different license, meat space license versus V two business source license, which limits the use of V three source code in a commercial or production setting for two years. After two years time, it returns to a similar open source license that V two was under. But it's kind of like this time delayed GPL license. So to me, when I ask the why did they do this? It seems like very obviously a response, some meat space anti forking provision.
00:40:25.066 - 00:40:50.002, Speaker A: Right. So what they're saying to anybody who would try to fork it is, hey, if you do this, this is actually against the license, right? So you could see all of the code, but you're breaking a license of sushi swap, say, tries to clone this or fork this. I have kind of mixed feelings about this, David, to be honest. So I want to get your take on it first. Why do you think they're doing this and what are the implications?
00:40:50.146 - 00:41:59.006, Speaker B: Yeah, this is probably a direct response to the whole sushi swap vampire attack thing, where sushiswap literally just forked Uniswap code and then did the LP rewards. And so they say, hey, we're going to clone Uniswap and then we're going to distribute this new token to people that use our version of Uniswap. And if this license was up, that would make this a little bit more restrictive, right? The take here is that Ethereum is inherently open source, and the only way that you can stop someone from copying your code is through meat space regulations like the courts, laws, nation state laws. And so it's a little bit antithetical when we're talking about this grand arena of open source development to say like, no, if you copy our code, which is public, when you publish it to Ethereum, it becomes public knowledge. It's in the public domain now you can file a license, which is what Uniswap has done, saying like, well, if anyone does this, we can legally go after them according to the rules of the nation state. I'm pretty sure licenses are maybe USA only or maybe there's an agreement between the USA and European Union. But it's a little bit antithetical to the space.
00:41:59.006 - 00:42:36.410, Speaker B: However, it ends in two years, which is not that long of a. Also, you know, it's a compromise. Like, we can't be completely cyberpunk crypto maximalists. We do live in physical reality. There are trade offs that we have to make. Uniswap does deserve innovators rewards, and so do all the investors. And maybe I'd be interested to see how much influence paradigm had with this influence, if that was really what they pushed for, or if this is something that Hayden really wanted, something we'll perhaps ask him on the podcast.
00:42:36.830 - 00:42:41.462, Speaker A: Yeah, so it's something that for sure could be forked to anonymously.
00:42:41.526 - 00:42:43.718, Speaker B: Right, but doesn't stop anonymous forking.
00:42:43.894 - 00:43:20.274, Speaker A: It doesn't stop anonymous forking, but it probably does stop things like there wouldn't be a high reputation, say, Silicon Valley style defi protocol with major investors who would just take Uniswap and fork it would. It do know. I guess the lens through which I see this too, is this is a response to what Uniswap has clearly perceived as a competitive threat. So this is a protocol using meat space now to defend against and to build a moat against competitors.
00:43:20.402 - 00:43:21.880, Speaker B: Not the first time either.
00:43:22.570 - 00:43:38.880, Speaker A: Yeah, not the first time. I'm also not surprised. I guess we'll see how this plays out. I do agree it's not in the spirit of fork it and see. Right. Everything is open source, so this is a little departure from that. We'll see how this plays out here.
00:43:38.880 - 00:43:43.530, Speaker A: Well, I think we've gotten through all the TLDR stuff, David.
00:43:43.610 - 00:44:27.366, Speaker B: I think there's one feature that we haven't covered yet, or maybe I misinterpreted something. I think it'll be in the blog post. But it's about like if you want to provide liquidity to the EtH Dai pair or any pair, but you only have one of the assets. I think Uniswap will take care of that for you. And so you can deposit just ether and then in the background it'll give you a liquidity position into the ETH die pair or the ETH USDC pair. And so you only need to come to uniswap with one asset to provide liquidity, and you will be buying it in the back end. But instead of having to come to uniswap with both equal amounts of both amounts of tokens in US dollar value terms, you can just come to one and then Uniswap will take care of it in the background.
00:44:27.366 - 00:44:30.974, Speaker B: Just a UX upgrade as well, which is kind of nice.
00:44:31.172 - 00:45:11.430, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. So again, this is not live yet, but we're dropping it as an alpha leak because it is such a monumental, I think, achievement for Defi and for Ethereum. So it's important that you know about it, I guess. What are the action items here, David? We haven't even talked about uni token price here, but I imagine it's doing something in the background even as we speak. I think the action items are, or some things to consider are this liquidity won't move over right away. Again, V two stays open and active and then V three is launched in parallel. And so it's not an automatic migration.
00:45:11.430 - 00:45:56.790, Speaker A: Lps are going to have to have a market reason to migrate and they'll migrate slowly. It feels like optimism is maybe going to happen sometime late spring, early summer on the heels of this. So that will be a big upgrade for the community. And the good news is layer two is here. I think the other last takeaway is this seems to add some tangible, concrete token economics, cash flow value streams to uni the token. And what are the implications? What are the implications when Coinbase does its ipo and has a publicly traded stock price? What are the implications for unity token there? So a lot to think through. We hope you've enjoyed this alpha leak video edition.

00:46:06.710 - 00:46:50.054, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe just one more comment on the uni price, just to add some market perspective. It's been trading pretty strongly, I would say, in the last week. And then this announcement dropped and uni price went from thirty four dollars to thirty seven dollars, and then it's fallen from $37 down to $31. And so there was definitely people who were looking to trade on this news, and so far it's turning out to be kind of a sell the news event, but I don't give a fuck because this is so, excuse my language, but I think this is really cool. And again, like that Coinbase trade, that's where my head is at. Coinbase is going to drop a bomb on the public stock market and then people are going to figure out what DeFi is. And Uniswap is just the easiest thing to understand after Coinbase.
00:46:50.054 - 00:46:51.850, Speaker B: So that's my market commentary.
00:46:52.510 - 00:46:57.786, Speaker A: There you go, guys. David's market commentary. I hope you've enjoyed this Alpha alert. Thanks a lot.
