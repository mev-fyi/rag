00:00:00.250 - 00:00:09.306, Speaker A: What makes me angry is for people to say things like, oh, there are hundreds of banks insolvent and it's hyperinflation time and the system is coming crashing.
00:00:09.338 - 00:00:12.830, Speaker B: Down and there's no hope and buy Bitcoin.
00:00:13.730 - 00:00:26.280, Speaker A: That's what makes me angry. There are real problems here and this is not helpful, right? In fact, it's actively harmful. And that's what I'm speaking out about.
00:00:27.690 - 00:00:49.146, Speaker C: Bankless Nation. We're going to get straight into the episode today. There's bank runs and there's rumors of bank runs going on. One side says the banks are installant get to the lifeboats. Another side says the banks are going to be fine and they're sick and tired of the doomers pulling the fire alarm. So who's right? This is the third episode in a series of conversations we've been having on Bankless. And to get the full debate, you'll need to listen to the last two.
00:00:49.146 - 00:01:11.934, Speaker C: On the get the lifeboat side, we had Balaji Srinivasan. He said that bitcoin is going to $1 million, that the dollar is hyperinflating. It's probably going to happen fast, like in 90 days fast. Then we had Arthur Hayes. He gave us the trader's perspective. He doesn't think it'll happen as quickly as biology, but he has the same message get out before it's too late. So this is our first episode on the counterpoint.
00:01:11.934 - 00:01:27.318, Speaker C: On the gonna be fine side, the banks are okay. Ben Hunt is giving the counterpoints today. There are a few benefits, a few takeaways. We want you to get out of this episode. Number one, why are the lifeboat people wrong? Number two, why the banks are actually solvent. This is what Ben thinks. It's his take.
00:01:27.318 - 00:01:58.342, Speaker C: Number three, why treasuries are still the safest asset in the world. Number four, why Ben thinks hyperbitcoin and hyperbitcoinization for the world is actually a really bad thing. And number five, how Ben thinks we can reform rather than replace the Fed. That seems to be a theme for this episode. There will be links in the show notes to the two previous episodes if you want to get caught up on the debate as it stands. There are two other things I want to say before we get into this episode. Number one, tensions are high on this debate.
00:01:58.342 - 00:02:21.682, Speaker C: There's going to be an inclination to go on personal attacks and to question motives. I'll remind all of us before we get in that none of us can assess motives. We should focus on attacking the argument rather than the person. And so I encourage everyone listening to this to approach the arguments on both sides with an open mind and really focus on the arguments rather than descending into personal attacks. We see. Our role at Bankless is to present the arguments in the best light. Our listeners are smart.
00:02:21.682 - 00:02:39.630, Speaker C: They can make decisions on their own. Number two, David planned to be here, but unfortunately he had an emergency. He had to attend. So it's just Ben and myself today, guys. We're going to get right to the episode Ben Hunt, but before we do, we want to tell you about the sponsors that made it possible, including Kraken, which is our number one recommended crypto platform for 2023. Go set up an account.
00:02:39.700 - 00:03:33.518, Speaker D: Kraken has been a leader in the crypto industry for the last twelve years. Dedicated to accelerating the global adoption of crypto, kraken puts an emphasis on security, transparency and client support, which is why over 9 million clients have come to love Kraken's products. Whether you're a beginner or a pro, the Kraken UX is simple, intuitive and frictionless, making the Kraken app a great place for all to get involved and learn about crypto. For those with experience, the redesigned Kraken Pro app and Web experience is completely customizable to your trading needs, integrating key trading features into one seamless interface. Kraken has a 24 7365 client support team that is globally recognized. Kraken support is available wherever, whenever you need them by phone, chat or email. And for all of you Nfters out there, the brand new Kraken NFT beta platform gives you the best NFT trading experience possible rarity rankings, no gas fees, and the ability to buy an NFT straight with cash.
00:03:33.518 - 00:03:59.942, Speaker D: Does your crypto exchange prioritize its customers the way that Kraken does? And if not, sign up with Kraken@kraken.com slash bankless. How many total airdrops have you gotten? This last bull market had a ton of them. Did you get them all? Maybe you missed one. So here's what you should do go to Earnify and plug in your Ethereum wallet. And Earnify will tell you if you have any unclaimed airdrops that you can get. And it also does poaps and mintable NFTs any kind of money that your wallet can claim, earnify will tell you about it.
00:03:59.942 - 00:04:28.382, Speaker D: And you should probably do it now because some airdrops expire. And if you sign up for Earnify, they'll email you anytime one of your wallets has a new AirDrop for it to make sure that you never lose an AirDrop ever again. You can also upgrade to Earnify premium to unlock access to airdrops that are beyond the basics and are able to set reminders for more wallets. And for just under $21 a month, it probably pays for itself with just one AirDrop. So plug in your wallets at Earnify and see what you get. That's ear ni fi. And make sure you never lose another AirDrop.
00:04:28.382 - 00:04:53.146, Speaker D: The phantom wallet is coming to Ethereum. The number one wallet on Solana is bringing its millions of users and beloved UX to Ethereum and polygon. If you haven't used Phantom before, you've been missing out. Phantom was one of the first wallets to pioneer Solana staking inside the wallet and will be offering similar staking features for ethereum and polygon. But that's just staking. Phantom is also the best home for your NFTs. Phantom has a complete set of features to optimize your NFT experience.
00:04:53.146 - 00:05:23.806, Speaker D: Pin your favorites. Hide your Uglies burn the spam and also manage your NFT sale listings from inside the wallet. Phantom is of course a MultiChain wallet, but it makes chain management easy, displaying your transactions in a human readable format with automatic warnings for malicious transactions or phishing websites. Phantom has already saved over 20,000 users from getting scammed or hacked. So get on the Phantom Waitlist and be one of the first to access the MultiChain beta. There's a link in the show notes or you can go to Phantom app slash waitlist to get access in late February.
00:05:23.918 - 00:06:06.954, Speaker C: Bankless Nation I am super excited to introduce you to our guest today once again, Ben Hunt. He is an investor and the creator of an incredible investor community called Epsilon Theory. He's a several time Bankless guest, perfect person to have this conversation, I think because he's been one of the more outspoken critics against Balaji Srinivasan's $1,000,000.90 day Bitcoin hyperinflation thesis. He think Balaji, of course, in our episode earlier this week said that the dollar was going to drop to near zero, or at least Bitcoin would be going to a million dollars in short order. And I think Ben Hunt is the internet's leading candidate to push back against that theory and that thesis. So we are happy to have him today.
00:06:06.954 - 00:06:08.706, Speaker C: Ben. Welcome to Bankless. How are you doing?
00:06:08.808 - 00:06:15.026, Speaker A: I'm doing great and it's super to be back here with you guys. Always enjoy it. So thanks for having me on.
00:06:15.128 - 00:06:29.938, Speaker C: Yeah, I think we asked for counterpoints to Balogy's thesis because at Bankless we want to hear both sides of any argument so that we can sort of make up our minds about this. And of course, Bankless is a crypto friendly community. But I also know you, Ben, to be a crypto friendly.
00:06:30.034 - 00:06:31.640, Speaker A: I'm a crypto friendly person.
00:06:32.110 - 00:07:09.526, Speaker C: I am, yeah. And I know that because we've spent hours literally on previous episodes talking about, you know, that's why this is interesting. This is not a crypto villain like Paul Krugman giving this critique of Bology's thesis. This is somebody who has, you know, there are some use cases for crypto and I think you've been excited about the things that Bitcoin other cryptocurrencies can do in the past. So I'm wondering if you could just before we get into the discussion and the counterpoint to Balaji, give us your crypto credentials a little bit, like, what are your thoughts on crypto as a technology?
00:07:09.708 - 00:07:13.906, Speaker B: Look, to say that I'm a fan.
00:07:13.938 - 00:07:27.446, Speaker A: Of I think crypto use cases might be going a little too far. Right. I think that there's a clear use case, a wonderful use case. Alex Glidestein has been very prominent on.
00:07:27.468 - 00:07:32.842, Speaker B: This about in repressive communities.
00:07:32.986 - 00:07:45.890, Speaker A: Right? I mean that it's a wonderful way to or a wonderful way, really one of the only feasible ways to exit those kind of repressive systems.
00:07:47.750 - 00:07:58.454, Speaker B: I think though, that my main praise for Bitcoin, specifically crypto more generally, is.
00:07:58.492 - 00:08:12.220, Speaker A: That I think that it is elegant and wonderful art. And people think that's a big put down when I say that, and it's actually my highest praise. Art is what inspires us, right?
00:08:14.830 - 00:08:26.974, Speaker B: I'm very allied and enthusiastic about and supportive of the ethos, as I would.
00:08:27.012 - 00:08:39.570, Speaker A: Describe it, of the Bitcoin and larger crypto community, one of self reliance, long time horizons, a mindset of autonomy.
00:08:40.630 - 00:08:44.626, Speaker B: I think that those are what makes.
00:08:44.728 - 00:09:00.234, Speaker A: A society worthwhile and vibrant and successful. I think that what makes an individual life vibrant and meaningful and successful. I'm not going to call that my.
00:09:00.272 - 00:09:22.590, Speaker B: Credentials, because I also think that Bitcoin, specifically crypto more broadly, like any application in finance, attracts fraudsters, hucksters, worse.
00:09:24.390 - 00:09:37.142, Speaker A: People I call Raccoons. And that's what makes me angry. That has made me angry about Balaji, right?
00:09:37.276 - 00:09:40.470, Speaker B: It's that raccoonishness.
00:09:42.250 - 00:09:51.002, Speaker A: As Big Daddy would say in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, the mendacity, just the mendacity of.
00:09:51.136 - 00:09:55.606, Speaker B: The lies, the self interested lies, that's.
00:09:55.638 - 00:10:05.040, Speaker A: Not the only thing that makes me angry. I have plenty of anger at the system and the perversions of the system.
00:10:06.850 - 00:10:09.214, Speaker B: But fortunately I think it's possible to.
00:10:09.252 - 00:10:22.340, Speaker A: Walk and chew gum at the same time. That we can call out both social and societal inequities and change them, or when it's necessary, burn it the fuck down.
00:10:23.830 - 00:10:28.886, Speaker B: I also think we can call out the lying liars and the lies that.
00:10:28.908 - 00:10:37.334, Speaker A: They tell for their own interest. And so I really think we can accomplish both things. And that's why I'm happy to be on Bankless again.
00:10:37.452 - 00:11:35.340, Speaker C: So we'll get to Balaji's argument in a minute and certainly I think a lot of Bankless listeners will agree that crypto has seen its fair share of raccoons. I mean, specifically, 2022 was probably the year of the Raccoon, the year of the Raccoon, wasn't it? That's definitely what we had. I want to set some context some more to you, Ben, because can you tell us? You said there are times to burn the system down. You said that you are angry at the existing system and I think what you mean is kind of the Fed. I remember our last conversation, you talked about this idea of hollow men, hollow markets, hollow world. I think you are in common alignment, that something has gone off course in the United States and maybe other fiat regimes. What are your critiques of the Fed? Where do you think that US monetary policy has gone off course? Before we get to Bology's argument, I'd like to hear you on this.
00:11:36.430 - 00:11:47.440, Speaker A: Sure, I'll start with this. I think the Federal Reserve saved the world in March of 2009.
00:11:48.530 - 00:11:51.806, Speaker B: I think they saved the world, I.
00:11:51.828 - 00:12:07.190, Speaker A: Think they did in March of 2009. What? It's the one job of a central bank. The one job of a central bank. This is why central banks exist. It's not for price stability, it's not for full employment.
00:12:08.010 - 00:12:11.720, Speaker B: Their one job is to be that.
00:12:13.370 - 00:12:24.570, Speaker A: I'll use this word, liquidity provider. The lender of last resort. That when the global financial system, when the heart stops beating.
00:12:25.070 - 00:12:26.934, Speaker B: I like the Pulp Fiction analogy.
00:12:26.982 - 00:12:32.974, Speaker A: Their job is to come in and get that syringe of adrenaline and put it right into Uma Thurman's heart.
00:12:33.172 - 00:12:34.400, Speaker B: That's their job.
00:12:35.810 - 00:12:40.560, Speaker A: And that's what they did in March of 2009. I think that saved the world.
00:12:42.630 - 00:12:47.090, Speaker B: The problem was not that shot of adrenaline.
00:12:48.070 - 00:12:54.654, Speaker A: The problem, and this is what always happens with emergency government action, it becomes.
00:12:54.702 - 00:12:57.678, Speaker B: Permanent government policy, right?
00:12:57.704 - 00:13:01.814, Speaker A: We move from that shot of adrenaline to get the heart beating again, save.
00:13:01.852 - 00:13:10.778, Speaker B: The world, to having a constant IV drip in our arm of 14 years.
00:13:10.864 - 00:13:12.780, Speaker A: Of zero interest rate policy.
00:13:14.990 - 00:13:26.654, Speaker B: That's a horrible mistake, and it perverts. What good can come out of a.
00:13:26.692 - 00:13:47.174, Speaker A: Fiat system, fractional reserve banking and all of that. So I have enormous disagreements with the Fed and this transition from emergency government action into permanent government policy. More broadly speaking, and this was the topic we spoke on last time, this.
00:13:47.212 - 00:13:52.994, Speaker B: Notion of using of transforming emergency action.
00:13:53.122 - 00:14:01.002, Speaker A: Into permanent policy, sometimes it happens without even the emergency action. So what we were talking about last.
00:14:01.056 - 00:14:06.970, Speaker B: Time was how Alan Greenspan, very intentionally.
00:14:07.470 - 00:14:09.878, Speaker A: Not with malice or forethought, but certainly.
00:14:09.984 - 00:14:13.982, Speaker B: Intentionally, what he decided to do was.
00:14:14.036 - 00:14:35.574, Speaker A: To use monetary policy to keep interest rates artificially low in order to grow our wealth. And I understand why that's politically popular, and I understand why he would go down that path, because for a while, you can accomplish that.
00:14:35.612 - 00:14:39.174, Speaker B: You can sin a little bit and.
00:14:39.212 - 00:14:40.680, Speaker A: Not pay a big price.
00:14:41.690 - 00:14:52.606, Speaker B: But since Greenspan, we're going back to the mid 80s now, we've been sinning.
00:14:52.658 - 00:15:15.490, Speaker A: A little bit more and more and more. And then with the Great Recession and putting zero interest rate policy as policy, as permanent policy, we send a lot. And so there is absolutely a horrendous imbalance in our system around debt. I think that there is a path.
00:15:15.830 - 00:15:19.506, Speaker B: To, believe it or not, grow our.
00:15:19.528 - 00:15:28.840, Speaker A: Way out of it. I still think that's possible. I think the window for that is shrinking. And shrinking I can understand people say, no, I don't think that window is there.
00:15:30.170 - 00:15:32.966, Speaker B: But what I don't it's not just.
00:15:32.988 - 00:15:34.454, Speaker A: That I don't agree with what makes.
00:15:34.492 - 00:15:37.862, Speaker B: Me angry is for people to say.
00:15:37.916 - 00:15:45.066, Speaker A: Things like, oh, there are hundreds of banks insolvent and it's hyperinflation time, and the system is coming crashing down and.
00:15:45.088 - 00:15:47.770, Speaker B: There'S no hope, and buy bitcoin.
00:15:48.670 - 00:16:03.230, Speaker A: That's what makes me angry. There are real problems here, and this is not helpful, right? In fact, it's actively harmful. And that's what I'm speaking out about.
00:16:03.380 - 00:16:26.614, Speaker C: So, Ben, let's get into the argument. So I think that you called the Fed. There's this in the United States, there's this horrendous imbalance around debt. And I think a lot of people in crypto see that and would agree with you. And I think what years here saying is, just because the Fed is wrong doesn't mean bitcoin maximalists. Are right. But I want to get into the argument that's part of what I'm saying.
00:16:26.652 - 00:16:30.060, Speaker A: If I could just that's absolutely part of what I'm saying.
00:16:30.670 - 00:16:33.258, Speaker B: And I'm saying, and I'd love to.
00:16:33.264 - 00:16:36.554, Speaker A: Kind of get a chance to talk about this here, I think there is.
00:16:36.592 - 00:16:41.742, Speaker B: A path forward from here that over.
00:16:41.796 - 00:16:49.882, Speaker A: A very long period of time, with enough political will and resolve, we can get back on a much sounder footing.
00:16:50.026 - 00:17:12.006, Speaker C: I hear you. We will talk about that. About the way to kind of reform the Fed and get on that sounder footing. There may be some folks coming to this episode that aren't familiar with Bology's argument. Now, I mentioned the outset that we did release another episode, bology, earlier this week. It's an hour and a half long episode or so. You guys can go listen to that if you want.
00:17:12.006 - 00:17:17.942, Speaker C: All of the details, ben, I just want to make sure we're starting on the same starting point here.
00:17:17.996 - 00:17:18.502, Speaker A: Sure.
00:17:18.636 - 00:17:28.758, Speaker C: Can you articulate what Balogy is actually saying? What's your understanding of the point that he is making and his overarching thesis?
00:17:28.934 - 00:17:35.022, Speaker A: Right. So when I first started writing Epsilon Theory, and this is now ten years.
00:17:35.076 - 00:17:35.680, Speaker B: Ago.
00:17:38.610 - 00:17:57.030, Speaker A: I wrote about this, and it's all very grandiosely titled I Wrote a Manifesto. I mean, how egocentric is that, right? But anyway, I did. And one of the lines in the manifesto is about how important it is to call things by their proper names.
00:17:57.850 - 00:18:00.358, Speaker B: I really believe that it's important in.
00:18:00.364 - 00:18:05.074, Speaker A: Our individual lives, it's important in our social lives, it's important in our political.
00:18:05.122 - 00:18:07.462, Speaker B: Lives to do just that, to call.
00:18:07.516 - 00:18:49.990, Speaker A: Things by their proper names. And that has one aspect of it which is, I guess let's call it an anti political correctness, that you don't have to walk on eggshells, that you can use call things what for what they are. But inherent in that approach is that words themselves have meaning, that words mean something. And words like insolvency, words like impairment that Mology throws around like this, these words have an actual meaning.
00:18:52.490 - 00:18:53.074, Speaker B: Frankly.
00:18:53.122 - 00:19:03.786, Speaker A: That's why I think when we were first talking about doing a podcast, there's a notion of a debate. There's no debate here because we'd spend.
00:19:03.808 - 00:19:08.362, Speaker B: The whole time talking about words and.
00:19:08.416 - 00:19:10.140, Speaker A: Do they have meaning or not.
00:19:11.170 - 00:19:18.414, Speaker B: But a word like insolvency, word like impairment, these are not words that just.
00:19:18.452 - 00:19:35.450, Speaker A: Reflect your vibes, right? They're not your feels about a bank's assets or liabilities. They have real meaning. And so what makes me so angry is for Balaji to just kind of throw know, hundreds of banks are insolvent.
00:19:35.550 - 00:19:44.970, Speaker B: All caps, your money is not safe by bitcoin.
00:19:47.070 - 00:19:50.858, Speaker A: And what makes me, again, so angry.
00:19:50.954 - 00:19:55.054, Speaker B: Is that it's these big accounts like.
00:19:55.092 - 00:19:57.886, Speaker A: Abalogy, like a warhese, we know the.
00:19:57.908 - 00:20:02.526, Speaker B: Big accounts who are typing out in.
00:20:02.548 - 00:20:06.130, Speaker A: All caps, your money is not safe, take your money out of the banks.
00:20:10.950 - 00:20:12.850, Speaker B: And that does make me angry.
00:20:13.350 - 00:20:17.050, Speaker A: I've had a dozen is it a dozen? No, it's not a dozen.
00:20:17.150 - 00:20:19.958, Speaker B: I've had eight to ten readers of.
00:20:19.964 - 00:20:47.418, Speaker A: Epsilon Theory email me and say, hey, I'm nervous. I'm worried. Or asking for a friend, right? My parents are nervous or worried. What do you think? They'll couch it in some ways like that. I've been thinking about taking my money out of Wells Fargo, for fuck's sake, and I say, for fuck's sake, and I don't know. Sorry, I should have asked what our policy is here on bankless.
00:20:47.514 - 00:20:48.862, Speaker C: So pretty little.
00:20:48.916 - 00:20:49.662, Speaker A: It's all good, right?
00:20:49.716 - 00:20:51.150, Speaker C: Arthur Hayes episode?
00:20:51.970 - 00:21:10.920, Speaker A: I can only imagine. No, I can only imagine. Wells Fargo is one of the too big to fail outfits, and you're talking about taking a sub $250,000 clearly. Right. And keeping it in the cash money in your home.
00:21:11.770 - 00:21:15.302, Speaker B: What is this? What is this?
00:21:15.356 - 00:21:22.906, Speaker A: And I'll tell you what it is. It's lying liars saying this stuff for.
00:21:22.928 - 00:21:28.650, Speaker B: Their own benefit and wittingly or unwittingly.
00:21:29.150 - 00:21:40.830, Speaker A: For some really rich guys who I really believe intentionally want to destabilize our country and our society.
00:21:43.170 - 00:21:43.582, Speaker B: Again.
00:21:43.636 - 00:21:44.634, Speaker A: That's what makes me angry.
00:21:44.682 - 00:21:48.654, Speaker B: So words like insolvency and impairment and.
00:21:48.692 - 00:22:20.410, Speaker A: If the bank, hundreds of banks, are insolvent, that's just not true. It's not right. Now, does that mean that banks can't be insolvent? Absolutely they can. The last time we had a lot of banks that were insolvent was in 2008 and 2009. And I wrote a lot about that, ran a hedge fund. We were on this from the very start. So it's not that I'm some freaking apologist for the banks or the bankers.
00:22:20.410 - 00:22:26.462, Speaker A: But what insolvency is is when your.
00:22:26.516 - 00:22:30.078, Speaker B: Assets are permanently impaired, like when you.
00:22:30.084 - 00:22:32.190, Speaker A: Buy lots of mortgage backed securities.
00:22:34.050 - 00:22:34.800, Speaker B: And.
00:22:35.110 - 00:22:47.794, Speaker A: The ability of people to pay those loans back. Ain't there. That is not the problem we have today. That is not the problem with buying.
00:22:47.922 - 00:22:53.622, Speaker B: U s treasuries and Fannie Mae I e us.
00:22:53.676 - 00:23:02.890, Speaker A: Government supported Mortgage backed securities. Or Munis. The problem is not one of impairment.
00:23:06.530 - 00:23:12.494, Speaker B: The problem is one of liquidity. And that gets back to what was.
00:23:12.532 - 00:23:20.786, Speaker A: Talking about before about the Federal Reserves. Any central bank's, one job, their one job is when the shit hits the.
00:23:20.808 - 00:23:26.746, Speaker B: Fan I. E. The banking system halts.
00:23:26.798 - 00:23:29.880, Speaker A: Because there's no liquidity, there's not cash.
00:23:30.330 - 00:23:33.986, Speaker B: Their job is to put the liquidity.
00:23:34.098 - 00:23:35.558, Speaker A: Into the banking system.
00:23:35.724 - 00:23:36.294, Speaker B: That's it.
00:23:36.332 - 00:23:37.462, Speaker A: That's their one job.
00:23:37.596 - 00:23:42.410, Speaker B: And that's what they did with their term loan facility.
00:23:43.470 - 00:23:46.426, Speaker A: It's not QE right.
00:23:46.528 - 00:23:51.210, Speaker B: It's not again, these words have actual meaning.
00:23:51.890 - 00:24:01.390, Speaker A: So QE is the Federal Reserve buying stuff and keeping it on their balance sheet. I'm buying this seven year bond.
00:24:02.850 - 00:24:06.778, Speaker B: It's not here's cash for a one.
00:24:06.804 - 00:24:23.478, Speaker A: Year facility as emergency liquidity. Actually most of the expansion of the balance sheet. This return to QE or reversal of QT reversal of quantitative tightening most of its 90 day financing. It's that shot of adrenaline to keep.
00:24:23.564 - 00:24:27.494, Speaker B: Liquidity cash money in the banks for.
00:24:27.532 - 00:24:31.058, Speaker A: The people who want to take it out for whatever cockamamy reason they want.
00:24:31.084 - 00:24:32.220, Speaker B: To take it out for.
00:24:34.350 - 00:25:05.026, Speaker C: So, Ben, if I'm understanding you correctly, there are two parts to this pushback, and you've even called it anger. So you've got kind of a, yeah, you're pissed off about this. And the two parts, it sounds like, is part one, which is you feel like there is some untruth around the actual definition of these words. I want to talk about that in a second. And the second part is motive. You're actually questioning the motive of those who are propagating it. Motive is always a hard thing to actually ascertain, but maybe we could talk about that.
00:25:05.048 - 00:25:06.420, Speaker A: Absolutely. 100%.
00:25:07.290 - 00:26:03.026, Speaker C: Let's focus on the untruth side of things. So insolvency, impairment. What about the idea that I don't think know to play devil's advocate to what you're saying. I don't think bology or Eric Voorhees are saying that individual banks won't be able to meet their obligation they're saying that individual banks aren't able to meet their obligation without Fed intervention. And the thing that is actually insolvent is more on the side of the Fed itself. And maybe one representative, whether we call it QE or whether we call it the Bank Term Financing Program, one representative of that is how large is the balance sheet of the Fed actually growing? And we have seen it growing through this intervention over the past couple of weeks. You're saying that this is short term growth, but I think the proponents of this argument are saying it's never short term growth.
00:26:03.026 - 00:26:27.118, Speaker C: Ben, you know this you just made the case back in 2008 that once you put the morphine drip in, it never comes out. And so we had Arthur Hayes on the episode earlier this week, and he said, yeah, it's small now, but this Btfp alone could grow to like $4 trillion and be a COVID level increase in terms of base money, dollar supply. What's your take on this?
00:26:27.284 - 00:26:35.810, Speaker A: That it's not true, right? In any event, it's not for maximum.
00:26:37.590 - 00:26:44.382, Speaker B: There's $2 trillion in non GSIB.
00:26:44.446 - 00:26:49.620, Speaker A: Okay. What's a GSIB? So a government systemically important banker. So.
00:26:53.290 - 00:27:03.978, Speaker B: The big four us. Banks, big retail, commercial banks are too big to fail. Right.
00:27:04.064 - 00:27:36.334, Speaker A: They cannot go into a resolution process. And this is what we're going to get to. There are real problems in our banking system, real serious problems about how these big four banks are. Your deposits are guaranteed, and outside of them, your deposits aren't guaranteed. There's a real problem of $250,000. They're not guaranteed. There's a real problem in the lack of regulatory oversight of what I'll call.
00:27:36.392 - 00:27:40.230, Speaker B: Kind of the big regional banks.
00:27:41.050 - 00:27:56.250, Speaker A: It's, again, bullshit that they don't have the same level of regulatory oversight that the big banks have. It's bullshit that there are government protections on deposits for these big four banks and not for any of the other banks.
00:27:58.350 - 00:28:02.782, Speaker B: These are all real problems that really.
00:28:02.836 - 00:28:04.960, Speaker A: Need to be addressed by policy.
00:28:07.810 - 00:28:09.822, Speaker B: But one of those problems is not.
00:28:09.956 - 00:28:26.580, Speaker A: I got 99 problems. One of them ain't that we're going to have $4 trillion of new money printed and going into the banks, right? That's not it. That's the equivalent of saying, you know what, the S and P 500, it could go to zero. That is actually true.
00:28:30.630 - 00:28:33.366, Speaker B: If the Western world actually, if the.
00:28:33.388 - 00:28:41.980, Speaker A: Entire world collapses and we return to a Bronze Age barter system, the S and P 500 goes to zero.
00:28:44.590 - 00:28:47.226, Speaker B: Those are equivalent statements that we could.
00:28:47.248 - 00:28:49.990, Speaker A: Have $4 trillion in new money printing.
00:28:50.150 - 00:28:51.450, Speaker B: Money printing.
00:28:51.890 - 00:29:00.014, Speaker A: And the S and P 500 could go to zero. So, yeah, I get worked up about this stuff. It's not right. It's not correct.
00:29:00.132 - 00:29:05.554, Speaker B: Because the key difference and again, these.
00:29:05.592 - 00:29:12.018, Speaker A: Words have meanings, right? It makes a difference whether you are.
00:29:12.184 - 00:29:17.138, Speaker B: Buying a mortgage backed secure, you're the.
00:29:17.144 - 00:29:27.910, Speaker A: Fed, you're buying a mortgage backed security, and it has an anticipated lifespan of whatever, seven and a half years, let's say, for something that they buy from Fannie or Freddie.
00:29:28.490 - 00:29:29.746, Speaker B: That has a meaning.
00:29:29.778 - 00:29:58.066, Speaker A: It has a term, it's written right there on the paper. We can say, no, we can measure what the duration of the assets are on the Fed's balance sheet. We can measure that. And it's not the same thing as saying, oh, well, this bank facility, well, this could be billions and billions or trillions and trillions of dollars. It has a term limit. Here's why it's not also going to.
00:29:58.088 - 00:30:03.682, Speaker B: Expand the interest that the Fed is.
00:30:03.736 - 00:30:06.314, Speaker A: Charging the banks to take this facility.
00:30:06.462 - 00:30:14.774, Speaker B: This is expensive money. The banks are losing money when they.
00:30:14.812 - 00:30:17.122, Speaker A: Post a security to this Fed facility.
00:30:17.266 - 00:30:27.126, Speaker B: This is the old and I think entirely correct saying about how the central.
00:30:27.158 - 00:30:43.950, Speaker A: Banks should provide the emergency support, the emergency liquidity, you should apply it to solvent banks on good collateral at penalty rates.
00:30:44.870 - 00:30:48.242, Speaker B: And that's exactly what they've done, right?
00:30:48.296 - 00:30:53.730, Speaker A: That's exactly what they've done. The collateral here is the safest stuff in the world. It's US.
00:30:53.800 - 00:31:02.934, Speaker B: Treasuries, it's government supported mortgage backed securities. These are not banks that reached for.
00:31:02.972 - 00:31:13.820, Speaker A: Yield by giving out liar loans and alt a mortgage back, whatevers. That is not what's happening here.
00:31:14.990 - 00:31:17.562, Speaker B: Now, before someone asks, could there be.
00:31:17.616 - 00:31:21.818, Speaker A: Problems on these banks balance sheets on the asset side?
00:31:21.984 - 00:31:22.700, Speaker C: Absolutely.
00:31:25.330 - 00:31:29.230, Speaker A: People me you talk about commercial real estate loans.
00:31:29.810 - 00:31:32.190, Speaker B: Could those loans, some of them be impaired?
00:31:33.170 - 00:31:53.586, Speaker A: Yeah, they sure could. Because I think what's happened and this is also the Bologies and the others screaming about bank insolvency and take your money out, it's not safe. What they've contributed to is a credit freeze here in the United States. We are at the leading edge. It's going to be an awful recession.
00:31:53.778 - 00:31:54.534, Speaker B: It is.
00:31:54.652 - 00:32:05.020, Speaker A: It's going to be an awful recession. And this is part of the contributing factor to it. So you want to look at some of the bank loans and say, okay, I'm kind of worried about them. I agree.
00:32:05.790 - 00:32:06.826, Speaker B: I agree.
00:32:07.008 - 00:32:10.122, Speaker A: But that's not at the foundation of.
00:32:10.176 - 00:32:12.702, Speaker B: What the biologies of the world are.
00:32:12.756 - 00:32:28.386, Speaker A: Saying is driving the duration, the insolvency, their vibe, word of the banks, what they're saying is, oh, the interest rates have gone up. And so the duration risk, that's what.
00:32:28.408 - 00:32:31.202, Speaker B: A bank does, right?
00:32:31.256 - 00:32:47.670, Speaker A: This isn't credit risk. This isn't some sort of permanent impairment. This is what a bank does. And when people get freaked out, the central bank, the Fed has done what it does. It provides that emergency liquidity so that the banks don't fail.
00:32:49.770 - 00:32:50.582, Speaker B: And they provide.
00:32:50.636 - 00:33:01.500, Speaker A: It at a penalty interest rate so that all the banks don't just say, oh yeah, let me have some of that. Nobody wants any of this unless they need it.
00:33:03.250 - 00:33:10.382, Speaker B: To tide over this liquidity driven desire to pull the deposits out.
00:33:10.436 - 00:33:13.806, Speaker A: And I think that is over. Frankly, I think the Fed has done.
00:33:13.828 - 00:33:19.186, Speaker B: Its job right and that all this.
00:33:19.288 - 00:33:42.140, Speaker A: Business about, oh, your money's not saved and there's runs on the banks. I think what the Fed did is they bought time for now us to solve and let's solve them the very real problems of a two tiered banking system that we have in the United States. And let's try to work on this massive recession that's coming down the pike because we now do have a credit freeze here in the United States.
00:33:42.670 - 00:34:42.806, Speaker C: So your high level take, Ben, is that they have solved the problem of the bank run, that it was temporary, they have some liquidity in, and the next thing that central bankers need to worry about, and all of the entire United States needs to worry about, is a recession. I have a question for you because this is probably a point of debate. You said this Treasuries are the safest assets in the world. I think that is a key point where people who are making Bellagy's argument would disagree. They would say, no, Ben, they're not the safest assets in the world. Fiat is not a safe instrument. We had Arthur Hayes on the podcast earlier this week too and he said that all of these fiat regimes are kind of inside money and all of the debt that nation states are accruing of years of the Morphine drip of health care costs, skyrocketing of irresponsible fiscal policy decisions.
00:34:42.806 - 00:34:58.020, Speaker C: They are going to be laden at the feet of those who are inside the system, the inside money. The best thing you could do is go outside the system. I can't think of anything more inside money than Treasuries. So why do you think that Treasuries are the safest asset in the world?
00:35:00.550 - 00:35:32.560, Speaker A: Because when I try to imagine a world where a US Treasury has credit risk and again, that's what we're talking about here. By credit risk, I mean you're not going to get paid back at the end of the term. That's why we call it a risk free rate. It's typically what's called a treasury bill. Which officially is any duration less than a year or a year or less. But typically people mean the 90 day obligation of the United States government. That's called the risk free rate.
00:35:32.560 - 00:35:42.240, Speaker A: And for most of the past century, that risk free rate has been above inflation. So there is a positive real return.
00:35:42.850 - 00:35:48.420, Speaker B: On holding on carrying dollars.
00:35:49.110 - 00:35:50.558, Speaker A: It's called carry.
00:35:50.734 - 00:35:51.460, Speaker B: Right.
00:35:53.910 - 00:36:09.566, Speaker A: In finance. It's why my view of these kind of dollar debasement charts that go around, oh my God, the dollar has lost 98% of its purchasing power. It's again, mendacity.
00:36:09.698 - 00:36:16.330, Speaker B: It's bullshit because the dollar has carry.
00:36:19.390 - 00:36:49.014, Speaker A: There's an interest rate associated with dollars. Now, again, I said this before, the last 14 years have not been a positive real rate of return. The carry on the US dollar has been below inflation and then when inflation spiked up, is way below inflation. And that's why job one of the Fed is to get us back to a positive real rate of return on.
00:36:49.052 - 00:36:53.346, Speaker B: The US dollar, the normalizing of interest rates.
00:36:53.378 - 00:36:57.862, Speaker A: That's what that means. An abandonment of this zero interest rate.
00:36:57.916 - 00:37:02.122, Speaker B: Policy which does debase the currency, right?
00:37:02.176 - 00:37:06.330, Speaker A: And it does penalize savers and it does do all of these very true.
00:37:06.400 - 00:37:09.946, Speaker B: Things that I think the Bitcoin and.
00:37:09.968 - 00:37:14.320, Speaker A: More broadly crypto community quite appropriately call out.
00:37:16.130 - 00:37:22.960, Speaker B: But what that does not mean, what it absolutely does not mean is that.
00:37:24.230 - 00:37:30.002, Speaker A: The US dollar system can or should.
00:37:30.056 - 00:37:35.202, Speaker B: Be burned down, right?
00:37:35.256 - 00:37:46.342, Speaker A: Or that there is actually credit risk with the United States government. Because in that scenario, if I'm not oh, I'm not sure if I want to get paid back the next 90.
00:37:46.396 - 00:37:50.326, Speaker B: Days or the next two years on.
00:37:50.348 - 00:38:07.680, Speaker A: The treasure, the two year treasury I bought. I'm kind of worried about getting my money back on that. There's credit risk there. Well, let's try to imagine what that world looks like and I'll tell you what that world looks like. And people I get it this all the time in my tournament. Oh, well, people would actually be able to buy a house because they'd be so much cheaper then.
00:38:09.410 - 00:38:13.866, Speaker B: It's like our entire GDP would be.
00:38:13.908 - 00:38:21.410, Speaker A: Cut in half, unemployment rate would be 40%, mortgages would not exist.
00:38:23.190 - 00:38:23.966, Speaker B: Student loans.
00:38:23.998 - 00:38:46.698, Speaker A: Wouldn'T exist, auto loans would exist, no lending would exist. I mean, it really is returning to that. Oh, yes. Man, I have such fond memories of a Bronze Age barter system. It's the epitome of fuck around and find out.

00:41:33.170 - 00:41:49.650, Speaker C: I'm starting to understand kind of the picture here. You're thinking that people seem to be celebrating the idea or the fact that banks would go insolvent or that the Fed, the US would be unable to meet its obligations. I want to make sure the system is broken.
00:41:49.730 - 00:41:54.866, Speaker A: We might as well burn it down now. This is just like LARP. It's LARPing.
00:41:55.058 - 00:42:02.518, Speaker C: Absolutely LARPing. I agree with you on this. I want to make sure that, though, that we are not beating up a straw man here.
00:42:02.684 - 00:42:03.026, Speaker A: Okay.
00:42:03.068 - 00:42:34.260, Speaker C: I think that one of the things that you said around Treasuries, I don't think that those who believe at least some portion of Balogy's argument would say that the US. Is going to default on its obligations. Rather, that the thing that you said, that over the last 100 years, real returns on Treasuries have been net positive. I don't know, one, 2%, something like that. Rather that that won't be the case for the decades to come. And that doesn't usually happen. Granted, it does happen.
00:42:37.110 - 00:42:38.162, Speaker A: I'm agreeing with you.
00:42:38.216 - 00:42:38.530, Speaker B: Right.
00:42:38.600 - 00:43:07.838, Speaker A: So, again, I think it was Alex Glanstein or somebody. Well, one of the reasons I like Bitcoin is like an insurance policy against us not returning to a positive risk free rate, a real rate of return, to which my response was fair. So I surrender on that. That is a reason, right.
00:43:08.004 - 00:43:10.462, Speaker B: And I get it.
00:43:10.516 - 00:43:23.694, Speaker A: It's the same rationale you would have for, like, 30 years. You know, why you would own gold, for example. It's exactly the same argument. It's an insurance policy against central bank.
00:43:23.742 - 00:43:33.910, Speaker B: Error and, as the lawyers would say, stipulated.
00:43:34.970 - 00:44:14.114, Speaker C: Okay, so you do agree on that. So I think what you're saying though, is that the bitcoin maximalist position or this position that Balogy is presenting is far more extreme than just the case of, hey, Ben, you know, we're buying all of these outside money. Assets because we think the real returns on Treasuries are going to be negative for the next three decades because of central bank policy and fiscal policy and the US. Losing its power status in the world and the US. Dollar diminishing as a reserve currency. So that's why we're going outside the money. You would probably say that's fair.
00:44:14.114 - 00:44:29.126, Speaker C: That's a fair argument. That's also a reason to buy gold and other assets. But I think what you're more objecting to is the more extreme nature that this narrative is being portrayed. They're not saying what I just said. They are saying, get all of your money out now before it's too late.
00:44:29.158 - 00:44:33.114, Speaker A: And that's my argument, is with both.
00:44:33.152 - 00:44:37.530, Speaker B: The portrayal, right, the hyperbole.
00:44:38.750 - 00:44:43.600, Speaker A: But more fundamentally, my objection is to the vision. Here's what I mean.
00:44:44.850 - 00:44:48.078, Speaker B: And you see this in the past.
00:44:48.164 - 00:44:49.678, Speaker A: With gold bugs, too.
00:44:49.844 - 00:44:52.974, Speaker B: The idea is that it's not just.
00:44:53.012 - 00:45:22.310, Speaker A: I've got this insurance policy. If we have stresses and issues in the existing dollar system. No, we need to replace the existing fiat system with a gold standard. We need to replace it with a Bitcoin standard. We need to end fractional reserve banking. We need to move to fixed reserve banking. So my larger objection, my objection is not just to the hyperbole.
00:45:22.310 - 00:45:30.394, Speaker A: My objection is very much, very much to the notion that there is an.
00:45:30.432 - 00:45:37.146, Speaker B: Alternative financial system based on a fixed.
00:45:37.178 - 00:45:44.702, Speaker A: Supply thing like gold or like Bitcoin. So I'm very opposed to the underlying.
00:45:44.766 - 00:45:50.274, Speaker B: Vision, in addition to the mendacity of.
00:45:50.312 - 00:45:55.170, Speaker A: Using words like, oh, my God, hundreds of banks are involvement, and your money is not safe.
00:45:55.750 - 00:46:18.970, Speaker C: I got it. Okay? So I want to dig into that because that is deeper in the layer of your objections. And I think one of the most crucial pieces. So basically what's going on is there is a ship, it's hidden iceberg. People are debating on the size of that iceberg, how catastrophic it is. Maybe you disagree with the whole metaphor and scenario, but absolutely. Allow me to put some pieces together.
00:46:18.970 - 00:46:27.582, Speaker C: So something happened. Maybe people how about this, Ben? People are saying that the ship hit an iceberg and there's some debate as to whether it did or not. Some people this is my point.
00:46:27.636 - 00:46:42.018, Speaker A: There's no debate, right? This is like saying when you say it's hit an iceberg. Yes, that is a metaphor. The banks are insolvent. Oh, my God, your money's not safe. And what I am telling you is that that ain't true.
00:46:42.184 - 00:46:55.814, Speaker C: Okay, so Ben here is saying I'm trying to make sense of this for Bankless Sisters because Balaji just came on the podcast and said we hit an iceberg. Ben is coming on the podcast and saying we didn't hit an iceberg at all. That's a lie. People are making this up now.
00:46:55.852 - 00:46:58.994, Speaker A: Sorry, I got to interject. And I'm not saying you can't hit an iceberg.
00:46:59.042 - 00:46:59.206, Speaker C: Sure.
00:46:59.228 - 00:46:59.526, Speaker A: You know what?
00:46:59.548 - 00:47:01.686, Speaker C: We hit an icebergs are real is what Ben is.
00:47:01.708 - 00:47:27.010, Speaker A: Icebergs are real. Icebergs are real. We hit an iceberg in 2008, okay? And everything that's happened since then was our government's both initial response to hitting the iceberg, which I think actually saved us from sinking. Yes, but then disaster disastrous. That's going to be too strong. Pathetically, right? The actions they took to keep us from sinking, they said, let's just do that permanently.
00:47:27.590 - 00:47:28.366, Speaker C: Understood.
00:47:28.478 - 00:47:34.462, Speaker A: So icebergs are real. We hit an iceberg in eight. This wasn't an iceberg.
00:47:34.526 - 00:47:34.802, Speaker C: Okay?
00:47:34.856 - 00:47:35.554, Speaker A: That's what I'm saying.
00:47:35.592 - 00:47:50.290, Speaker C: So let's continue that metaphor for a second because I enjoy it anyways. I don't know if any listeners okay, so we hit an iceberg. We didn't hit an iceberg is what Ben says. Some people are saying we have hit an iceberg. But Ben believes in icebergs. They are a real thing. You can hit them in ships.
00:47:50.290 - 00:48:08.570, Speaker C: Some people aboard the ship are saying, come on to the lifeboat. Everybody aboard the lifeboat, right? And you're saying, hold on, don't board the lifeboat. Look at that. There's only a small number of lifeboats. We're not all going to get off. And by the way, the lifeboats are leaky. This is kind of the objection to the vision.
00:48:08.570 - 00:48:29.922, Speaker C: So I want to dig into that piece of it, because we've already talked about whether we hit an iceberg or not, and you've articulated why you don't think we have. But what about the lifeboat is leaky to you? So let's say that everyone followed kind of the strong bitcoiner case for getting aboard this alternative to fiat monetary system.
00:48:30.056 - 00:48:30.354, Speaker A: Sure.
00:48:30.392 - 00:48:35.542, Speaker C: What do you object to that? What's so wrong with the vision? Why do you think the lifeboats are leaky? Or there's not enough to go around.
00:48:35.596 - 00:48:49.740, Speaker A: Or whatever metaphor you so I'll continue with this, my view cockamamie analogy, and I'll say this. You can't cross the Atlantic Ocean on a lot of lifeboats. That's the problem.
00:48:50.350 - 00:48:51.340, Speaker C: Why, though?
00:48:52.930 - 00:48:57.486, Speaker A: Our economy is a big ass ocean liner. That's what it is, right?
00:48:57.588 - 00:49:00.526, Speaker B: And icebergs are real.
00:49:00.708 - 00:49:01.950, Speaker A: It can sink.
00:49:03.090 - 00:49:05.970, Speaker B: I get it. We're not sinking.
00:49:06.470 - 00:50:00.370, Speaker A: And yet the claim is, oh, my God, this ship is sinking. Right. We have to move to a system that's not a big ocean liner. No, we need to get on our own, all our little lifeboats. What's this idea about having a captain of the ship? No, we need to all make our individual decisions about where our lifeboat is going. Well, you're not going to cross the ocean that way. And what I mean by crossing the ocean is you can't maintain people don't like to hear it, but my God, the standard of living in the United States in the year of our Lord 2023 is phenomenal.
00:50:00.370 - 00:50:20.330, Speaker A: And for people to say, oh, I kind of wish we'd just go back to the late 19th century when men were men and sheep were scared and we had some rugged individualism and this is what I mean by LARPing.
00:50:20.750 - 00:50:22.390, Speaker B: This is what I mean by LARPing.
00:50:22.470 - 00:50:32.400, Speaker A: It's just like, God, 8 billion people, or whatever the number is in the world. And you're just saying.
00:50:35.570 - 00:50:37.120, Speaker B: If they live, they live.
00:50:41.410 - 00:50:53.794, Speaker A: To continue the cockamamie analogy, replacing the ocean liner with a system of lifeboats, I think that's a really poor idea.
00:50:53.992 - 00:51:44.500, Speaker C: This is the crux of it, and I'm glad we got this deep in this conversation, Ben. So make that case some more, though, okay? So you're saying that a fleet of lifeboats can't cross the Atlantic. What is so great about the Fiat system? What is so great about fractional reserve banking? What is so great about having a captain who can kind of inflate money supply to whatever kind of the ocean liner needs? Why can't a bitcoin based or a crypto based algorithmic monetary system of some kind do all of these things? I mean, nation states did exist prior to Fiat regimes that were based on things like the gold standard. Why can't we return to something like this? And why do you have such objections to the lifeboat idea?
00:51:44.870 - 00:51:46.094, Speaker B: Well, for two reasons.
00:51:46.142 - 00:52:05.226, Speaker A: One is that the reason that governments left the gold standard was that it constrained them so much, both for doing things like fighting a war, but also constrained them so much in things like.
00:52:05.328 - 00:52:10.890, Speaker B: Just extending credit to an economy and growing an economy.
00:52:12.110 - 00:52:43.190, Speaker A: So it's the latter of those I'm kind of even most interested in doing, because what would actually happen in wars is that you would debase a currency. I mean, this is like Henry VI would do this, right? You'd change the mix of silver in your coins, right? Or you'd say, oh, well, we're going to borrow. I'm good for it. Or you'd issue deposit notes that were actually kind of fractional reserve banking of the time. You'd do war bonds, you do all find all these ways to borrow money.
00:52:43.260 - 00:52:46.086, Speaker B: Anyway, to fight a war.
00:52:46.188 - 00:52:48.070, Speaker A: So I'm going to leave that aside.
00:52:49.290 - 00:52:51.560, Speaker B: Because you can do that on a gold standard, too.
00:52:52.250 - 00:53:02.510, Speaker A: What is very difficult to do on a gold standard or a bitcoin standard is to create a system in your society where you extend credit to anyone except the rich.
00:53:04.050 - 00:53:10.490, Speaker B: So my objection to moving to instituting.
00:53:10.650 - 00:53:14.160, Speaker A: A gold standard or a bitcoin standard is that.
00:53:16.390 - 00:53:31.766, Speaker B: Access to credit for anyone who's not very rich does one of two things. Either it vanishes because banks will no longer be able to lend to have.
00:53:31.788 - 00:53:48.140, Speaker A: A velocity of money. And my God, this is on my Twitter feed. People think the velocity of money is the speed of a transaction. It's not. This is at the heart of a fractional lending system, which is that.
00:53:50.510 - 00:53:50.874, Speaker B: You.
00:53:50.912 - 00:53:58.160, Speaker A: Lend the money to a business, they want to expand, they want to buy something, they want to hire people, you lend them money.
00:53:58.690 - 00:54:01.390, Speaker B: That money is now deposited at your bank.
00:54:02.850 - 00:54:08.114, Speaker A: It's their account, so they're spending it. Those deposits, then you then take those.
00:54:08.152 - 00:54:11.026, Speaker B: Deposits, you can lend that out, or.
00:54:11.048 - 00:54:23.826, Speaker A: A fraction, like 90% of it, let's say. So this is the velocity of money. The same dollar is accomplishing more economic activity.
00:54:24.018 - 00:54:29.030, Speaker B: That's the velocity of money. And that is not just possible.
00:54:29.100 - 00:55:15.494, Speaker A: It's at the heart of a fractional reserve system, a fractional banking system, and it's exceedingly difficult to do in a fixed banking system. Now, the counter to that, as people say, is, oh no, it's okay, right? The banks will just originate the loans and then they'll securitize them, and that will fund the lending that takes place. What that means is then you have to think, well, who is buying the asset backed securities? Who is buying the mortgage backed securities? And in our country, because those would be the two things that would be securitized. And you can do this. All right? European banks, for example, this is called.
00:55:15.532 - 00:55:19.234, Speaker B: A wholesale funding system, that the banks.
00:55:19.282 - 00:55:37.866, Speaker A: Fund their loans basically by packaging the loans and then selling those as securities to generate the funding for the next set of loans, as opposed to relying on deposits. And the fractional reserve banking system, that's much more prevalent in Europe than it is in the US. Where our banks are much more supported.
00:55:37.898 - 00:55:41.150, Speaker B: By deposits, retail deposits.
00:55:41.570 - 00:55:42.880, Speaker A: You can do it.
00:55:43.830 - 00:55:51.170, Speaker B: What that leads to, though, is the buyers of these securities are the banks.
00:55:51.990 - 00:56:14.380, Speaker A: The buyers of these securities are the government. So when bitcoin standard or gold standard people are talking about, no, we need narrow banks, we need a fixed supply and the like. And yes, there would be these other ways to accomplish lending because the banks would just be a wholesaler. They just originate the loans and we package them up and we'd sell them.
00:56:14.910 - 00:56:16.618, Speaker B: Guess who the buyers are?
00:56:16.784 - 00:57:11.066, Speaker A: It's the banks and the government. You're basically calling for a far more centralized world than a world of fractional banking where banks make loans and hold their loans on their own balance sheets. Sorry, I'm a capitalist and the root word of capitalist is capital. And to make a capitalist economy grow, you need that supply of capital and credit, particularly to the non very rich. So that's my five minute defense of fractional reserve banking system, as they would say. Happy to take comments. And you know you're going to get tons of comments on this podcast, right? The comments are going to be, oh, you let them off the hook on Know that.
00:57:11.088 - 00:57:20.890, Speaker C: Look, I know that and this is why we want to hear both sides of the argument. Twitter is a nasty place, isn't it, Ben? Sometimes people get personal, I think conversations.
00:57:20.970 - 00:57:23.114, Speaker A: Oh my God, you should see my feet.
00:57:23.162 - 00:57:44.946, Speaker C: I know it, I've been there too. Not for this particular issue, but others. And there are tribes anger and it's just a nasty place. Anything that the bankless platform supports is going to be constructive debate. And so I would encourage all of the people wanting to comment on this be constructive. Let's have the conversation, let's have the debate. No personal attacks.
00:57:44.946 - 00:58:11.280, Speaker C: Okay? So could you also contrast the world, let's say that we did move to some sort of algorithmic coin standard where it couldn't be debased, something like Bitcoin. So why is that a worse world? I mean, you've just painted the picture of why fractional reserve is necessary is kind of a cornerstone for civilization and I think it's really for people.
00:58:11.810 - 00:58:13.942, Speaker A: It's a cornerstone of modern society.
00:58:14.026 - 00:58:16.980, Speaker C: A cornerstone of modern society, that's all.
00:58:17.670 - 00:58:29.190, Speaker A: And now that we're here to eliminate or not eliminating right, you're limiting it to the very rich.
00:58:29.690 - 00:58:40.154, Speaker B: Mortgages, credit in general, credit cards go away, auto loans go away. Mortgages go away.
00:58:40.352 - 00:59:07.902, Speaker A: Student loans go away, except to the degree that they are absorbed by the big banks and government. That's what's happened with student loans. For example, every student loan now is backed up. The government owns those loans. Yeah, you could still have student lending with a Bitcoin standard, but it means that we're creating a more government reliant centralized society for doing it.
00:59:07.956 - 01:00:05.314, Speaker C: So that's what you see, even if we just swap out the denominator, if we swap out the dollar for some other standard as a store of value medium exchange unit of account, you think that that leads to a more centralized, more unequal world that is less free. So you're saying that the product that maybe maximalists advertise is really not as advertised because the picture of their painting, at least part of it is the ship is sinking, we have to flee to this other ship, that's kind of narrative, number one. But also this other ship is a more self sovereign freer world with more liberties and is going to lead to greater, I hope this is the argument, greater economic prosperity. There are some that might even disagree with that statement and be like, no, it's all about bunkers and citadels. That's a very dystopian view of things. And I think there's an element to that.
01:00:05.352 - 01:00:06.638, Speaker A: It's self reliant.
01:00:06.814 - 01:00:13.926, Speaker C: Some are painting a picture of this being a good thing for society. And you're saying this is not, this is a huge step back.
01:00:14.108 - 01:00:18.022, Speaker A: Yes, that is exactly what I'm saying. And the crux of that argument is.
01:00:18.076 - 01:00:34.650, Speaker B: That I do not know how it is possible to extend credit with a fixed supply system except at extremely high interest rates.
01:00:36.910 - 01:00:59.000, Speaker A: Because let's say you're the bank of Bitcoin and somebody comes to you, hey, I've got this great idea for this project and I just need you to lend me this money from your deposits. You're a bank, you make loans, you say, okay, right, I'll do it and you make the loan and then something happens and they can't pay the loan back.
01:01:02.090 - 01:01:03.400, Speaker B: What do you do?
01:01:04.090 - 01:01:35.986, Speaker A: Right? There's no loan loss reserve, right? There's no separate equity here. You've lost money for the depositors. And if the depositors are part of that decision to go and invest the money and they're making that decision a, they're going to want a much larger the risk is larger, so they want more of a return. What banks do is that they allow us to pool social risk taking or fractional reserve banking does.
01:01:36.088 - 01:01:36.642, Speaker B: Right?
01:01:36.776 - 01:02:01.862, Speaker A: And that's a really good thing because the alternative is that credit dries up except for people who already have a lot of money. So that's the crux of my argument, that you can't have this fixed reserve system based on gold or Bitcoin or whatever it is and maintain societal wide.
01:02:02.006 - 01:02:12.940, Speaker B: Access to credit, which are there excesses in credit? Of course there are. Of course there are.
01:02:14.110 - 01:02:25.970, Speaker A: And there is. A necessary credit is the oxygen for our modern economy and society. And if you take away that oxygen, it dies.
01:02:27.430 - 01:02:58.234, Speaker C: I want to ask you about this. So another word for credit, Ben, is trust. And I think very much the whole story of humanity up to this point is a story of scalability. Our species is able to coordinate better than any other species. That's why we develop roads and hospitals and cities and nations and technology. So scaling trust is kind of the name of the game if we're going to survive and thrive into this 21st century. So another word for credit is trust.
01:02:58.234 - 01:03:44.954, Speaker C: But I want to ask you about this. It feels like to many people, and I think you would agree to this, the central bank has kind of betrayed our trust. It's like we don't necessarily get a vote on the money supply. And I'm wondering, I want to pitch to you this idea, Ben, is, is there some sort of a sweet spot here okay, we have the ship, the big ocean liner. There is a captain. Okay, but what's to prevent the captain from sailing? Like going to some destination we don't want to go or making bad decisions or treating everyone in the ship in kind of a subpar way, making decisions that aren't democratic, that aren't liberal? Well, one prevention mechanism is leaving the system. We can basically threaten the captain and say, look, hey, we should have the right to fork off.
01:03:44.954 - 01:04:34.886, Speaker C: We should have the right to go onto these lifeboats. And if you don't steer the ship in the right direction, this is our vote. We'll leave, we'll go on the lifeboat, we'll go find some other ship. Is there some sort of sweet spot where we have a check on power through these non inside money systems, outside money systems like Bitcoin or ethereum or gold or some other monetary standard? And we can use this because it feels very much ben and I think you'd probably agree with this, that central banks have too much power, too much unchecked power. I'm like, what can I do about this? I mean, how much money did we print during COVID If I disagree with that, I can vote. But we're just on this kind of machine and I don't know what else to do other than to vote with capital. And that is an Adam Smith.
01:04:34.886 - 01:04:44.240, Speaker C: That is a capitalist idea of being able to exit the system, vote with your capital and get outside of a system that's no longer working for you. Is there a sweet spot we can find?
01:04:44.770 - 01:04:48.830, Speaker A: So a couple of strands I want to untangle here.
01:04:48.980 - 01:04:51.982, Speaker B: The first is that I would very.
01:04:52.036 - 01:04:59.700, Speaker A: Much be in favor of a more I'll call it rules based monetary policy.
01:05:00.710 - 01:05:11.766, Speaker B: Right? That's absolutely a course correction that I think makes a ton of sense, a.
01:05:11.788 - 01:05:14.120, Speaker A: More rules based monetary policy.
01:05:15.930 - 01:05:20.294, Speaker B: And the main kind of big rule.
01:05:20.422 - 01:05:23.322, Speaker A: That I'd be very much down for.
01:05:23.376 - 01:05:30.810, Speaker B: Right, is an explicit recognition of the Fed's one job that lender of last.
01:05:30.880 - 01:06:30.078, Speaker A: Resort facility and a moving away from the effort, an intentional effort to guide or mold behaviors through words. And God knows I've written thousands of words about this and it's a real problem I have with the Federal Reserve. That because they are of this church who believe that they have this the French would call it dirajisma, this ability to direct economic activity. And they know best for us they are going to use their words not as an accurate representation of what they believe or think, but to use their words intentionally to alter our behavior, what we might call lying under other circumstances. Again, that's the mendacity on the institutional side.
01:06:30.244 - 01:06:34.578, Speaker B: So if you're asking me should we.
01:06:34.664 - 01:06:55.926, Speaker A: Reform, change sear, shrink the influence and the actions of central banks and federal resists absolutely. Should we eliminate central banks in our modern system, much less a fractional reserve system, banking system?
01:06:56.108 - 01:07:01.034, Speaker B: Hell no. So that's strand number one.
01:07:01.072 - 01:07:03.370, Speaker A: Now strand number two, the exit.
01:07:04.190 - 01:07:05.562, Speaker B: Why can't we just take our money.
01:07:05.616 - 01:07:25.650, Speaker A: And go somewhere else? Amen, brother. Take your money, go somewhere else, right? That's separate from big name accounts getting up there and on Twitter and here and every other place, shouting in all caps, the banks are insolvent, your money's not safe.
01:07:26.710 - 01:07:29.618, Speaker B: Buy bitcoin again.
01:07:29.704 - 01:07:38.470, Speaker A: That's what pisses me off, right. Both of those things piss me off. The one that's more kind of urgent and in my face right now is the latter.
01:07:39.850 - 01:08:20.670, Speaker C: I see. I want to ask a question about this rules based monetary policy really quick, because I can hear probably the bankless listener saying, but Ben, that's what crypto is. So the idea behind crypto is that any rules based monetary policy, as long as it's tied to a human making decisions and some sort of political apparatus, those rules will be bent and broken. And they would say, that's what we actually have with crypto, whether you believe the Bitcoin algorithm is correct or the ethereum algorithm is correct, it's something that is immutable, very difficult to change, that is kind of written in the software that is rules based. Now, maybe it doesn't have the right rule, but they would say, Ben, you never get humans.
01:08:20.830 - 01:08:38.358, Speaker A: I get the point. Let me answer the question. Right? So I'll answer Drake. The core problem for a government and a Bitcoin standard or a gold standard, is that the rules that are there.
01:08:38.524 - 01:08:42.282, Speaker B: Are out of their control, right?
01:08:42.416 - 01:08:46.058, Speaker A: And this is true for the gold standard, too. One of the huge problems of the.
01:08:46.064 - 01:08:48.138, Speaker B: Gold standard was, do you have a.
01:08:48.144 - 01:08:59.582, Speaker A: Gold mine or not? That was a big problem. That was a big problem. If you're a country and you're on the gold standard and we don't have a gold mine, that's a real problem.
01:08:59.636 - 01:09:00.240, Speaker B: Here.
01:09:02.050 - 01:09:05.726, Speaker A: Because we can't legislate it's.
01:09:05.758 - 01:09:09.874, Speaker B: The exceptions, it's those emergencies that come.
01:09:09.912 - 01:09:18.486, Speaker A: Up and when the rule is not in your when there's nothing where you can break the glass in case of.
01:09:18.508 - 01:09:21.106, Speaker B: Emergency, like the Fed did in March.
01:09:21.138 - 01:09:31.306, Speaker A: Of Nine, like the Fed did with this bank term loan facility. It's the separateness and the inability of.
01:09:31.328 - 01:09:33.500, Speaker B: Government to.
01:09:35.470 - 01:09:36.940, Speaker A: Ultimately control.
01:09:39.390 - 01:09:40.394, Speaker B: The reason for.
01:09:40.432 - 01:09:45.040, Speaker A: Being the raison detra of any government, which is to tax.
01:09:49.330 - 01:09:50.970, Speaker B: That's why governments exist.
01:09:51.050 - 01:10:12.966, Speaker A: And you call it senior ridge, you can call it all these different words, but they're basically about, this is why governments exist. And you say, well, screw that. I'm going to be my own sovereign individual. I'm going to go live out on the Isle of White or whatever. Screw you, right? And knock yourself out, man. Knock yourself out. This has been kind of at the.
01:10:12.988 - 01:10:22.922, Speaker B: Core of that philosophical difference I have with Bitcoin maxis and as it's applied for policy, right.
01:10:22.976 - 01:10:30.060, Speaker A: I don't think this is a battle that is winnable, and I don't think it's a battle that, even if you won.
01:10:30.430 - 01:10:34.478, Speaker B: Is a good thing for the world.
01:10:34.644 - 01:10:56.580, Speaker A: Which is to move to a fixed supply monetary system that is inviolable and cannot be changed by the citizens, however they are represented and however their will is represented in the perversions of that in government. But how it is separate from what citizens can do anything about.
01:10:57.670 - 01:11:28.922, Speaker C: Ben, this has been great. I want to get to one more thing before we close, but I'm kind of summarizing this going back to my ham fisted analogy, but maybe it's helpful for some listener out there. We're all in this ship together. Ben believes in icebergs. He doesn't think we hit one in this particular case, and he believes in your right to go board the lifeboat. But he takes issues with those who are screaming and shouting, run to the lifeboats. Run to the lifeboats.
01:11:28.922 - 01:11:34.266, Speaker C: And that is the crux of his issue. What do you think about that summary?
01:11:34.458 - 01:11:35.374, Speaker B: I think that's pretty good.
01:11:35.412 - 01:11:46.066, Speaker A: The only thing I'd add to that is I think it's a pretty crappy world if we live in a world of lifeboats, right? I think the ocean liner is an.
01:11:46.088 - 01:11:53.400, Speaker B: Important thing to maintain. It has definitely gotten off course over.
01:11:54.170 - 01:11:56.520, Speaker A: The last 1315 years.
01:11:57.130 - 01:11:58.598, Speaker B: I want to change the course of.
01:11:58.604 - 01:12:16.350, Speaker A: The lifeboat, of the ocean liner, and if not, replace the captain, put more controls on the captain, and let's get better crew. But I don't want to live in a world where we're all floating off in our own little lifeboats. Well, that's the only thing I'd add.
01:12:16.420 - 01:12:40.630, Speaker C: Let's complete this counterpoint with this, then. So I'm understanding. This is Ben Hunt, the reformist. Right? Not the radical who's telling you you board the lifeboats, but, hey, we can reform the ship that we're on. And I promised you to give you opportunity to make the case earlier in the episode on how we could actually reform the existing system. Ben, what do you think that looks like? How do we fix the fed?
01:12:42.250 - 01:12:48.710, Speaker A: More rules based, less reliant on they'll call it communication policy or forward guidance.
01:12:50.670 - 01:12:54.860, Speaker B: A real rate of return. A real rate of return.
01:12:55.790 - 01:13:16.722, Speaker A: Greater regulatory scrutiny of the banks. An increase in the uninsured amount of deposits or the insurance on deposits. An increase not unlimited, but an increase, because I want to make it possible to still have a regional bank system.
01:13:16.856 - 01:13:20.014, Speaker B: That is deposit driven, that still allows.
01:13:20.062 - 01:13:21.874, Speaker A: For banks to make loans and keep.
01:13:21.912 - 01:13:24.930, Speaker B: It on their books, because that is.
01:13:25.000 - 01:13:50.614, Speaker A: Such an engine for entrepreneurialism, for risk taking, for economic growth in our society. That's what funds small little businesses all around this country. That's what funds farmer loans, AG loans, right? Car loans, all that stuff. That's the economic activity. The banking activity.
01:13:50.662 - 01:13:56.478, Speaker B: I want to strengthen while at the top, we need to return to a.
01:13:56.484 - 01:14:00.880, Speaker A: Monetary policy that has a positive real rate of return.
01:14:01.570 - 01:14:03.498, Speaker B: And you do these things, and it'll.
01:14:03.514 - 01:14:05.342, Speaker A: Take a while, but fortunately, we have.
01:14:05.396 - 01:14:12.398, Speaker B: Time we grow our way out of the debt. We grow our way out of the debt.
01:14:12.494 - 01:14:16.838, Speaker A: And that's going to require some real fiscal reform, too. There's a whole set of things that.
01:14:16.844 - 01:14:19.174, Speaker B: I'd want to do there, and then.
01:14:19.212 - 01:14:28.918, Speaker A: The final thing I do is I would have a million dollar lifetime tax.
01:14:29.004 - 01:14:32.986, Speaker B: Free capital gains exemption, and then I.
01:14:33.008 - 01:14:40.730, Speaker A: Would tax capital gains progressively over that $1 million. But I want us to return to being a society of risk takers.
01:14:42.450 - 01:14:51.920, Speaker B: Entrepreneurs and investors, and I think our fiscal and monetary policy should support that.
01:14:52.610 - 01:14:54.286, Speaker C: Ben, you think we window shrinking, but.
01:14:54.308 - 01:14:55.554, Speaker A: That'S what I think we should do.
01:14:55.672 - 01:15:00.420, Speaker C: You think we can get there? You think we can use politics as our engine to get there?
01:15:01.350 - 01:15:03.060, Speaker B: I absolutely do.
01:15:04.470 - 01:15:10.520, Speaker A: It's getting harder and harder, and it's made harder and harder by the biologies of the world.
01:15:11.290 - 01:15:11.750, Speaker B: Right?
01:15:11.820 - 01:15:23.580, Speaker A: It's made harder and harder by this because it breeds more and more distrust and there's plenty to be distrustful of and lots of things to change, including some things to burn the fuck down.
01:15:25.630 - 01:15:35.120, Speaker B: But the fractional banking system and having a lender of last resort ain't two of them.
01:15:36.370 - 01:15:38.910, Speaker C: Ben, this has been a really productive conversation.
01:15:39.250 - 01:15:41.406, Speaker A: I hope so. Thank you. I've really enjoyed it.
01:15:41.428 - 01:16:09.926, Speaker C: Yeah, I appreciate you coming on and making this counterargument. I'm hopeful we can continue to have these kind of civil conversations and debates. And I would encourage anyone listening to this is if you have commentary or follow up. Let's keep it on the high rung arguments, not the low rung attacks, so that we can have some more productivity and hear all sides of the arguments and figure out what's going to happen next. That's what we're all trying to do here.
01:16:10.028 - 01:16:14.262, Speaker A: Well, thanks again. I really appreciate the opportunity to come on, guys.
01:16:14.316 - 01:16:23.930, Speaker C: Got to end with this risk and disclaimers. Of course, none of this was financial advice. Crypto is risky, so is DeFi. You could definitely lose. You put in. But we are headed west. This is the frontier.
01:16:23.930 - 01:16:27.580, Speaker C: It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
