00:00:00.330 - 00:00:10.830, Speaker A: Ethereum in, you know, five to ten years will be close to perfection. You know, it will be futile to try and censor transactions because you just won't be successful.
00:00:13.650 - 00:00:29.830, Speaker B: Welcome to Bankless, where we explore the frontier of Internet money and Internet finance. This is how to get started, how to get better, how to front run the opportunity. This is Ryan. Sean Adams. I'm here with David Hoffman. And we're here, here to help you become more bankless. Guys, fantastic episode today.
00:00:29.830 - 00:01:05.394, Speaker B: Timely episode. Uncensored ethereum. The topic is censorship on ethereum. Is it possible? We brought on Justin Drake, who is one of Ethereum's top researchers, to answer this question in detail? The question of how hard is it to actually censor Ethereum? A few benefits and takeaways for you today. Number one, is Ethereum really censorship resistant? We asked Justin this question. We find out where the weak points actually are. Number two, how do we preserve censorship resistance in Ethereum in the future? Justin talks about the roadmap towards doing this.
00:01:05.394 - 00:01:34.662, Speaker B: He's bullish. Number three, weak censorship versus strong censorship. This is an essential mental model that Justin gives us for trying to understand censorship on Ethereum and how it can occur. And number four, how the community can censor the censors. This is the nuclear option. We talk about a social fork near the end and what this would mean and how it would play out and the dynamics behind it. David, this was a fantastic episode.
00:01:34.662 - 00:02:04.830, Speaker B: Not the first time we've had Justin Drake on, of course. He was on for ultrasound money episodes, moon, math, cryptography. There's a lot of other episodes we'll include in the show, note details, but I don't know. This is one of my favorites, I guess, because we get into a topic that we haven't really explored, and it is actually linked to the sound money topic, ultrasound money topic, because ultrasound money does rest on Ethereum being censorship resistant. We talk about that too. What were your thoughts?
00:02:04.910 - 00:02:29.382, Speaker C: Yeah, of course. Good money requires censorship resistance. You can't have money being a system that only works for some people. You have to have money that works for all people. And that also goes with a very good financial system. So there are these core properties of what makes good money and good finance. And at the start of a long list of properties that makes up these things comes censorship resistance.
00:02:29.382 - 00:03:02.006, Speaker C: So in order to have ultrasound money, you must have ultra censorship resistant Ethereum. And so that's really the topic of today's show with Justin. And every time we have Justin on, we get down to what really feels like the basement of crypto economics or crypto primitives. And so it's why everyone feels so educated when they come out of a Justin Drake podcast. Is Professor Drake. Professor Drake? Yeah, we really get down to the bottom of things, and we do it in a very thorough way. These are long episodes because we cover absolutely everything.
00:03:02.006 - 00:03:33.306, Speaker C: And so I feel very educated coming out of this. I'm reading this book, Ryan, called the Code Book, and this is a history of ciphers and cryptography. Before, cryptography was really about just like, codes. And it talks about this armor's race between code breakers and code writers. And inevitably, the pendulum generally shifts towards the defenders, as in the code writers. And this is what cryptography has really instantiated ever since we invented it. In, the power always shifts to the defenders.
00:03:33.306 - 00:04:11.222, Speaker C: It's just a matter of, can the defenders come up with the mechanisms to keep themselves in power? And with blockchains and public key cryptography, we have these tools to put so much power in the hand of the defenders. And what that means is the individual, the people, who are trying to remain censorship resistant and free from oppression. And so this is a line that Justin uses in the podcast, is that we have the core primitives to always put power in the hand of the defenders, and it's just about getting that power to everyone. And so this is a podcast that explores how we enable everyone in the world to become censorship resistant in money and finance.
00:04:11.366 - 00:04:38.526, Speaker B: So listen to this episode with Professor Drake, and you tell us, do you think Ethereum can maintain its censorship resistance over the decades to come? Of course. Premium subscribers. If you are a bankless premium subscriber, make sure you stick around after the show for the debrief. That's David and I's opportunity to talk about the show that was. It's our raw, unfiltered thoughts to the bankless nation. We've got some thoughts on this episode. It was technically a very difficult episode to do.
00:04:38.526 - 00:04:52.090, Speaker B: If you were not a bankless premium member, go click that link and upgrade, and you can get access to that podcast as well. Well, let's get right into it with Justin. But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:04:52.240 - 00:05:16.682, Speaker C: Lens Protocol is an open source tech stack for building decentralized social media applications. It is the new era for social media. We all have toxic relationships with our web, two apps. We want to break up with them, but we can't. These applications own our digital lives and all the relationships that we've made. We need to break through to a new paradigm of social networking applications that we control rather than them controlling us. Lens isn't a social media app, it's a protocol to let a thousand web3 social apps bloom.
00:05:16.682 - 00:05:50.694, Speaker C: Lens is a permissionless and transparent social graph that is owned by the user. In crypto we say, not your keys, not your crypto, and on lens we say, not your keys, not your profile. With lens, your followers go with you to whatever social media application you want to use. And instead of being trapped by an algorithm chosen by that app, lens lets you choose the way you want to experience your social media. Rocket pool is your friendly, decentralized ethereum staking protocol. You can stake your ETH with Rocket pool and get our EtH in return, allowing you to stake your ETH and use it in DFI at the same time. You can get 4% on your ETh by staking it with rocket pool, but you can get even more by running a node.
00:05:50.694 - 00:06:23.622, Speaker C: Rocket pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating nodes. Running a rocket pool node is easier to set up than running a solo node, and you only need 16 eth to get started. Why would you do this? You get an extra 15% staking commission on the pooled e, so your API is boosted. So if you're bullish east staking, you can increase your APY and get some extra tokens by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pool network, which currently has over 1000 independent validators. It's yield farming, but with Ethereum nodes you can get started@rocketpool.net and also join the rocket pool community in their discord. You can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat, so I'll see you there.
00:06:23.622 - 00:07:15.654, Speaker C: Arbitrum is an Ethereum L2 scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use DFI and NFts. Some of the coolest new NFT collections have chosen arbitrum as their home, while DFI protocols continue to see increased liquidity and usage, you can now bridge straight into arbitram from more than ten different exchanges, including finance, FTX, Huobi and crypto.com. Once on Arbitrum, you'll enjoy fast transactions with cheap fees, allowing you to explore new frontiers of the crypto universe. New to Arbitrum for a limited time, you can get Arbitrum nfts, designed by the famous artists Ratwell and Sugoy for joining the Arbitrum Odyssey. The Odyssey is an eight week long event where you complete on chain activities and receive a free NFT as a reward. Find out more by visiting the discord at Discord GG Arbitrum. You can also bridge your assets to arbitrum at Bridge Arbitrum IO and access all of Arbitrum's apps at Portal Arbitrum one in order to experience defi and nfts the way it was always meant to be.
00:07:15.654 - 00:07:18.518, Speaker C: Fast, cheap, secure, and fiction free.
00:07:18.684 - 00:07:41.662, Speaker B: Bankless nation we are super excited to be joined once again by Justin Drake. He is a researcher at the Ethereum foundation. You might know him as the guy who originally explained ultrasound money to all of us. Legendary episode that on the bankless feed. But of course, you can't have ultrasound money without censorship resistance. That's got to be a core property of any sound money. That's what we're going to talk about today.
00:07:41.662 - 00:08:15.018, Speaker B: Gold, of course, can't be censored. That's why it's been held up as sound money throughout the ages. And our sound money currencies have to be cryptocurrencies have to be censorship resistant, too. And now, as we introduced Justin, of course there's recent talk that Ethereum can be censored. It's been in the headlines lately. There's talk that proof of stake is a vector for increased Ethereum censorship, that all it takes is a government agency to sanction a few addresses, and Ethereum censorship resistance will be brought to its knees. That is the topic we're going to discuss with Justin today.
00:08:15.018 - 00:08:17.290, Speaker B: Justin, welcome back to bankless.
00:08:17.630 - 00:08:19.066, Speaker A: Thanks for having me.
00:08:19.248 - 00:08:50.662, Speaker B: So here's what I think people want to know. I know we're going to come about these questions from a very bottom up approach and base principles approach, but I'm going to just set this out for the listener. I think what people want to know is how hard is it to censor Ethereum today? How can we design Ethereum to make that harder, more censorship resistant? And how does all this compare to other cryptocurrencies? So we're going to get into all of those questions not sequentially, but that is the thrust and the theme of this episode. Justin, you ready to dig in?
00:08:50.796 - 00:08:51.960, Speaker A: Let's do it.
00:08:52.410 - 00:09:04.940, Speaker B: Okay, why don't we start with some foundations, the basics here. Why is censorship resistance an important topic in crypto? And what is it?
00:09:06.270 - 00:10:16.478, Speaker A: Right, so censorship resistance is this idea that transactions that are valid and paying transaction fees should get included on chain. And one of the reasons why it's important is because of this kind of mimetic chain. Basically, censorship resistance is required for credible neutrality. Credible neutrality is required for legitimacy, and legitimacy is required for monetary premium and monetary premium is required. It has actual utility because it leads to economic security with staking, and it also leads to economic bandwidth when you start using ETH as collateral money in the context of DeFi. And so if you start attacking or weakening your sensory resistance, then everything starts to crumble apart and Ethereum no longer can fulfill its mission of being the settlement layer for the insets of value, because you need trillions of dollars of economic security and you need trillions of dollars of economic bandwidth, and you can only get that with censorship resistance.
00:10:16.654 - 00:10:32.982, Speaker B: So how core is it to Ethereum values then? And the promise of Ethereum? Right? Is censorship resistance one of the central principles, the pillars of Ethereum, or is it sort of a secondary feature, a benefit? We can kind of take it or leave it, right?
00:10:33.036 - 00:11:43.630, Speaker A: So the way that I think of it is as a pillar to credible neutrality. And there's kind of three pillars to credible neutrality. One is censorship resistance, the other one is actually scalability. And the reason is if you want a platform which is going to be the sentiment layer for the internal value, it can't just cater for the 1%, the rich, it needs to be credibly neutral to the whole world, and that's something we're working on. And then the third pillar to credible neutrality is full programmability, basically Turing completeness, because once you've reached that escape velocity with programmability, you can cater for any application without any bias within the context of the Internet of value, you're not programming in a very specific application with all sorts of unintended consequences down the line. And obviously Ethereum has the third pillar of credible neutrality. We're working on the second one, which is scalability, and I think it has a huge head start on the first one, which is censorship resistance.
00:11:44.370 - 00:12:53.310, Speaker C: And I think that really illustrates why this concept of censorship or censorship resistance in the crypto space is core to the ethos of this whole entire experiment. The through line I hear between all of those three pillars is something like inclusion or accessibility, where if we generate a crypto system, a blockchain that only includes the people that can pay for the most expensive transactions, then we are discluding the rest of the world, and then the rest of the world will reject that system because they're forced to, they can't participate in that. So that system is not inclusive of them. And when we talk about censorship resistance, we're really talking about is everyone included? And if we have two competing systems, like two versions of Ethereum, and one is including more people than the other, the version of Ethereum, that includes more people, is going to be adopted and considered legitimate by the world. And so I really think this inclusion idea is really important to run through as we talk about censorship resistance. Is that a fair shelling point to focus on, Justin?
00:12:53.470 - 00:12:58.178, Speaker A: Exactly. And it can be summarized in two words, equal access, certainly.
00:12:58.264 - 00:13:06.790, Speaker C: And can we talk about, just let's define censorship. What does to censor mean inside of the context of crypto?
00:13:07.850 - 00:14:03.850, Speaker A: Right. So censorship can be hard to define because you might want to take the perspective of the censorer, but it turns out that in Ethereum specifically, we have an extremely clean definition, which I call economic censorship. And one of the nice things about this definition is that it doesn't involve any humans. It just looks at open and free and efficient markets. And basically it states that if you have a transaction which is valid and which is paying the base fee, and it can be included in the next block, meaning that the next block is going to have some unused gas, then if it's not included in that next block, it's being economically censored. So there's no kind of economic reason for someone to be censoring. A transactional, a purely rational actor who wants to maximize fees will include that transaction, because it's a valid fee paying transaction, and there is block space available.
00:14:03.850 - 00:14:49.590, Speaker A: And the reason why I'd say it's unique to Ethereum is because we have EIP 1559. And one of the things that EIP 1559 gives us is this idea of a dynamic block size. So we have a gas limit which is two times the gas target. So the gas target is 15 million gas, the gas limit is 30 million gas. And what that means in practice is that the vast majority of blocks have unused gas. And so if you're seeing simultaneously two things, one, unused gas, and two, a transaction which is pending in the mempool and could have been consuming this unused gas, then you have kind of a mechanism to detect the censorship.
00:14:49.930 - 00:15:06.750, Speaker C: And so what you're saying is that there is an objective way to see if there is censorship or not. This is not like, oh, I feel like I'm being censored. No, there is a binary outcome of like, yes, this is censorship versus, no, this is not censorship.
00:15:07.330 - 00:15:24.302, Speaker A: Exactly. And it's something that machines can detect. Is there censorship? Yes or no? And it's something that we can set up alerts for. So if there is censorship, then everyone within the community can get alerted very quickly through automatic notifications.
00:15:24.446 - 00:16:11.860, Speaker B: How does it feel for a user to be economically censored? Like, what is the user experience of that? And I'm imagining a few things. So if you're censored, let's say I want to send some eth or a token to a censored address, I can never complete that transaction. Validators, miners, never pick it up because my transaction is being censored. Is that one way a user might experience it? Maybe another way is I can't complete a transaction on this censored DAP or this set of smart contracts because the miners or the validators never actually process it. Is that how a user would experience it? Or put us in the shoes of a user and tell us what censorship looks like at that level?
00:16:12.870 - 00:16:45.898, Speaker A: Right. So it turns out that there's two very different types of censorship. Type one is what I call weak censorship, is this idea that transactions do get included on chain, but they get included with a delay. And the reason is because some of the blocks, a fraction of the blocks, are not including that transaction. And so let's just take a few examples. Let's imagine, for example, that 90% of the blocks are censoring. That means that your average block time is going to grow from one slot to ten slots.
00:16:46.074 - 00:16:48.400, Speaker C: Your perceived average block time, right?
00:16:49.570 - 00:17:31.274, Speaker A: Well, no, the actual average block time, the time it takes for your transaction to get included on chain. I guess I should call it inclusion time, not actual block time. So the inclusion time will be ten slots, which is 120 seconds, which is two minutes. And so it's a Ux degradation. It's not too bad in the sense that it's still five times faster than bitcoin, which has ten minutes average block times, but it's still not ideal. And then there's this other form of censorship, which is strong censorship. And this is the really, really bad stuff, is when your transaction just never gets included on chain.
00:17:31.274 - 00:18:21.654, Speaker A: And this, instead of being rooted in block proposals, which are censoring, it's actually rooted in attestations. And it's a form of 51% attack, where the economic majority is, through attestations, effectively completely censoring certain types of transactions from going on chain. And here, it's much worse than a ux degradation. It could be just the total inability to use a specific type of contract, for example. So let's say you have deposited some ETh or some other asset in a smart contract, and you're censored from being able to withdraw, you've effectively lost your money. That could be one of the worst cases.
00:18:21.702 - 00:18:24.750, Speaker B: From the point, I didn't even think about that possibility.
00:18:25.810 - 00:18:37.860, Speaker C: Justin, can you define attestations. I think that might be a new word for listeners. How do we fit this idea of attestations into previously existing models that listeners might have?
00:18:38.470 - 00:18:59.618, Speaker A: Right. So Ethereum today, the proof of work. Ethereum and bitcoin bundle two separate roles. They bundle proposing and attesting. Now, on the beacon chain, we've separated this role. So we have two roles, the proposers and the attestors. What the proposers do is that they include blocks on chain.
00:18:59.618 - 00:19:35.730, Speaker A: Okay, fairly simple. What the attesters do is that they will basically vote for what they think is the tip of the chain, and so they participate in the fork choice rule. And so if you have a majority of attestors that are voting for a specific chain, then that will be the dominant one. It will win the fork choice rule. And so what the attestors can do is basically only vote on blocks that don't contain a certain type of transaction, thereby completely and utterly filtering out this type of transaction from Ethereum itself.
00:19:35.880 - 00:20:04.094, Speaker C: So if we are living in a paradigm where Ethereum has fallen victim to censorship, we are perhaps like a proposer proposes a transaction that has a bunch of tornado cash transactions in it. The attesters won't attest to that block. And they say that is not the chain tip. That's not the longest version of the blockchain. It's actually something else. And that something else is a version of Ethereum that doesn't have any tornado cash transactions in it. Is that how we should think about this?
00:20:04.292 - 00:20:13.630, Speaker A: Exactly. The attesters could basically ignore blocks and orphan blocks that contain certain type of transactions.
00:20:14.370 - 00:20:53.642, Speaker B: And back to your link. Right. So if we lose that property of Ethereum, which is censorship resistance, we collapse one of the core pillars of credible neutrality. Credible neutrality, of course, is the thing that is backing the ultrasound eTH, which backs all of the security of Ethereum. So you can see very quickly why censorship resistance is so important. And I wanted to get this into listeners brain because we're going to spend a lot of the episode talking about these two forms of censorship that Justin laid out for us, and it probably bears repeating. So we've got weak censorship, and that's kind of like a delayed inclusion of censored transactions.
00:20:53.642 - 00:21:42.240, Speaker B: The weak form of censorship is you just get a delay, and maybe instead of it taking minutes, it could take hours, something to that effect. Call it partial, call it temporary, or like block based censorship. And then the other part, we have the stronger form of censorship, Justin aptly named strong censorship. So this is censored transactions that never, ever get included on chain. And I think we're going to talk a lot about these two forms of censorship in the rest of this episode. But before we do there, we've got a few other high level things to cover. One question I have in the back of my mind, Justin, is I think what we're talking about here is the censorship resistance of Ethereum, the protocol itself.
00:21:42.240 - 00:22:30.640, Speaker B: We don't care so much about the app layer on top of Ethereum or even like the exchanges themselves. That is beyond the scope of the censorship resistance of Ethereum sort of conversation. So, for instance, a centralized exchange like coinbase or Kraken or binance, it's kind of out of scope of Ethereum. We sort of expect them to censor and abide by nation state jurisdictions. We also expect some of our apps on the app layer of Ethereum to be censored in one degree or another, AML, KYC, all sorts of various ways. Is that true? Are we mainly talking about the scope of this is the protocol level and Ethereum itself and block production, everything that happens at that level?
00:22:31.490 - 00:23:15.370, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. We're thinking about the censorship resistance of the layer one. And it is true that things that fall outside of the Ethereum jurisdiction, outside of the Ethereum network state, well, they don't have to follow our rules, and that's fine. But I think the trajectory that we're moving towards is basically the scope of the Ethereum nation state just keeps on growing week after week after week. And things like centralized exchanges become decentralized exchanges, things like centralized domain names like become decentralized domain names like def. And one by one, the Ethereum nation state, with its own self sovereignty and its own jurisdiction, is growing its territory.
00:23:15.870 - 00:23:51.350, Speaker B: It also does appear like censorship resistance, somewhat like decentralization is a spectrum, and you can have more or less censorship resistance. Would you agree with that characteristic? And how censorship resistant would you say Ethereum is today? So a score out of ten, are we hitting like a six, a seven, an eight? I assume we're not ten, because nothing is ten. Like ten is perfection. But give us a sense for how well ethereum ranks on that score and whether it is indeed a spectrum.
00:23:52.250 - 00:24:36.366, Speaker A: Right. So I guess for weak censorship, it can be a spectrum because it basically depends on the fraction of blocks that are basically censoring. I don't know what the number is because we haven't really seen much censorship. Actually. We have seen ethermine censor sandwiches, for example. And actually it's possible that we have seen ethermine also censor some tornado cash transactions I don't know what the share of efer mine is, but I guess it's irrelevant, right? Because they will be moving to proof of stake, and it's kind of unclear what it will be. But if I were to put forward a guess, I'd say less than 50% of blocks would be censoring.
00:24:36.366 - 00:25:16.382, Speaker A: And so your average block time is only in the worst case, going to double. So it's going to go from 12 seconds to 24 seconds. So it's a fairly minor degradation. In ux, on the other hand, the strong censorship is very much black and white. And the good news is that as far as I can tell, there's no entity out there that is credibly threatening to somehow attack Ethereum with strong censorship. And so that hasn't been a concern in the short term. I don't think it will be a concern in the medium term, but we still need to be prepared for the worst case scenario.
00:25:16.382 - 00:26:05.358, Speaker A: And I guess this is what this discussion is about, just making sure that even in the worst case, we are prepared for strong censorship. And there's two pieces of good news here, both on the weak and the strong censorship. On the weak censorship, we have technology, at least at the research stage, which can essentially fully eliminate weak censorship. So what that means is that not only will transactions get included, but all of them will get included in a timely manner without delay. And in terms of the strong censorship, we're also in the position of power. And this is a heuristic that we have in cryptography. In cryptography, the defenders are in a position of power, and this is a heuristic that extends to crypto economics.
00:26:05.358 - 00:26:39.050, Speaker A: Even for strong censorship, we are in a position to build crypto economic systems, both in code that automate actions, but both also at the social layer. And one of the interesting things about the strong censorship is that it does require some level of involvement from the social layer. And so the exercise becomes, how can we minimize that involvement, and to the maximum extent possible, try and automate the process of recovering from these 51% attacks.
00:26:39.390 - 00:27:37.920, Speaker C: Justin, I really liked what you said about Ethereum as a nation and having censorship resistance as, like, one of our laws, the Ethereum protocol is extra jurisdictional from other nation states. And what we're really concerned about here, and why this has been such a big conversation, is that with this OFAC ruling of tornado cash, we're seeing the laws of a nation state imparts its values upon Ethereum. And that is really chipping away at the self sovereignty of the Ethereum protocol. But what we're saying here, what you're saying here is that no, Ethereum, as a nation, has its own values, its own laws that are independent and sovereign from other nation states. And we actually have the tools and mechanisms ready to go, maybe not today, but soon. TM to enshrine Ethereum's values of censorship resistance at the protocol level. Is that a fair way of describing this?
00:27:38.450 - 00:28:06.802, Speaker A: Exactly. And as I was saying, we had some Internet issues. Weak censorship we can fully solve with just technology. And so that can be something of the past where every transaction can be included in a timely manner. And similar thing with strong censorship, we can be in a position where technology brings us to a point where the involvement of the social layer to recover from 51% attacks is actually fairly minimal.
00:28:06.946 - 00:28:53.574, Speaker C: Yeah, so this is all about enshrining these values of censorship resistance into the protocol as deeply as possible. And Justin, I just want to do this one more time, defining strong and weak censorship. Just one last model to really get this into listeners heads. And also, I want to check my own reasoning on this. Weak censorship happens above the protocol layer, right? We have these defi front ends that can prevent somebody from accessing them selectively. We have things like infura or alchemy that can restrict certain transactions that go through their nodes. There are other ways that different parts of this technological stack above Ethereum can pick and choose to not include transactions or to include them.
00:28:53.574 - 00:29:08.940, Speaker C: And so all of that censorship happens above the Ethereum protocol. And that's what we're calling weak censorship. And then there's actual censorship at the protocol level, at the Ethereum protocol. And that's what we're calling strong censorship. Is this a good way to define these things?
00:29:10.030 - 00:29:44.518, Speaker A: Yeah. So I guess one thing worth mentioning for weak censorship is that there's actually several types of participants. There's the interfaces, which are far from the layer one. And then there's kind of the builders, which are maybe slightly closer to the layer one. And then you have the actual proposers, which are basically validators, layer one, participants. So for weak censorship, you do have a spectrum. And part of the strategy that we're taking is to try and enshrine more and more of the block building process into layer one.
00:29:44.518 - 00:31:04.154, Speaker A: And so, for example, with enshrined, PBS builders have more of a native role. But philosophically, I do agree with you that with weak censorship, you know, you could argue that it's not Ethereum itself that is censoring. Instead, it's individual participants in their own nation state jurisdictions that are doing the censorship, on the other hand, for strong censorship, when you do get to this critical threshold of 50% of the attestations, then, yes, you can argue that Ethereum itself is censoring. And the reason is that the, among these individual participants, which might be subject to the constraints of their own jurisdictions as an aggregate, they now have control over the machine consensus, and they can control ethereum at this machine consensus level. And the reason why I specify machine is because there's actually two layers to consensus. One is the machine layer consensus, and the other one is the social consensus. And even though the machine layer consensus could be compromised, that doesn't mean that the social layer has to be compromised.
00:31:04.154 - 00:31:12.286, Speaker A: And this is where the social layer can come in and basically do a reboot, a recovery of the machine consensus.
00:31:12.398 - 00:32:57.198, Speaker B: All right, so I think one last thing before we get into the details of how to fix both strong and weak censorship, we want to address some of the crypto critics who are listening to this. Maybe it's their first time, and they're asking themselves, okay, so why are the crypto people so obsessed with censorship? Resistance in the first aren't in the majority of cases, aren't we censoring North Korea? Aren't we censoring the bad guys? Aren't we censoring the russian oligarchs? My take on this and the case for credibility neutrality, is we want to partake in a system where if we were not the rule setter, we would still be fine partaking in that system. So it's one thing if America is censoring North Korea or other bad actors, terrorists, russian oligarchs. But what if China was in control of the ethereum network and they started censoring NBA players who were speaking out against Hong Kong, for instance? What if Russia was in charge and just started censoring us politicians who are not supportive of their geopolitical actions? You could see why credible neutrality is a desirable property even at the nation state level, because they want to all collectively participate in a system where no one geopolitically can bend the rules. That's what we have with protocols like TCPIP and the Internet right now, pre kind of balkanization of the Internet. That's why censorship resistance is a desirable property, because it has no geopolitical bias. It doesn't make a decision as to whether this group of actors should be censored or that group of actors should be censors.
00:32:57.198 - 00:33:26.720, Speaker B: It just says, if you have an ETH address and you can pay the gas fee, then you get your transaction through and what we are saying is the crypto people believe this is actually a good property to have and will lead to beneficial things for humanity, more coordination, fewer wars, like kind of a crypto utopia, or at least like vestiges of that and hopes for that. What would you guys say about that defense of censorship, resistance and credible neutrality? Is that why we support it?
00:33:27.970 - 00:33:58.422, Speaker A: Yeah, I would agree with this. One of the things that I'd say is that if bitcoin is swiss banking, then Ethereum is all of Switzerland. Right. The product that we're giving here is secure block space. And one of the properties of being secure is being censorship resistant. And we don't want to lose this self sovereignty. We don't want to become a US chain or an EU chain or a China chain.
00:33:58.422 - 00:34:56.374, Speaker A: And one of the reasons is that we want credible World War II resistance. We want Ethereum to survive even the most extreme of human situations. And in order to get there, we need to have immunity from nation states. We want Ethereum to be a public good, not a private good, which is owned by some external jurisdiction. I guess another thing worth mentioning is around permissionlessness, right? If you have censorship, then now you basically, as an innovator, you need to ask for permission from the censor. And I think one of the big selling points of Ethereum is that it's a magnet for talent. And why is it a magnet for talent? Is because people feel like they can go build infrastructure on Ethereum, and it's going to last for decades and centuries.
00:34:56.374 - 00:35:23.714, Speaker A: And this is in stark contrast to APIs like Facebook's API or Twitter's API, which is known to have this inherent platform risk one day from another. You've built this multi billion dollar business on top of Facebook, and they just rug you by censoring their APIs. And so if we want to attract to the best and brightest, we need to have this strong, credible permissionlessness to it as well.
00:35:23.912 - 00:36:04.046, Speaker C: So, Justin, let's go ahead and start to get into some of the solutions that we have in the ethereum ecosystem for some of these various flavors of censorship. And we'll start with weak censorship first and talk about all the mechanisms that we have to prevent and eliminate weak censorship. And then we'll go to strong censorship later. But just to recap weak censorship, there's many different vectors of censorship here because of this tech stack. There's website front ends, there's RPC endpoint providers like infura or alchemy. We have individual block proposers or block builders. And this weak censorship would look like you make a transaction to tornado cash and you have to wait a few extra blocks to get your transaction in.
00:36:04.046 - 00:36:25.110, Speaker C: Maybe you have to pay a little bit of a higher gas, maybe it's just a little bit more difficult to use Ethereum. And then there are some other second order consequences for weak censorship as well, and maybe we can go into those. But overall, how would you say, what are the mechanisms that ethereum has at its disposal to prevent weak censorship?
00:36:25.450 - 00:37:02.686, Speaker A: Right. So because this block production pipeline is quite complicated, I guess it's maybe worth going through the participants one by one. And I'd say it's kind of easy to deal with the so called secondary participants that play a fairly minor role. So let's start with the searchers. Searchers are participants who will basically create these so called bundles of transactions. And basically their job involves inserting and reordering transactions into small bundles. They do things like arbitrage and sandwiches, but their job is not about filtering or censoring.
00:37:02.686 - 00:37:45.106, Speaker A: So searchers are not to worry. We can't move on. I guess the next type of participant would be the relays. And here the good news is that relays are a temporary thing with Mevboost. Once we have so called enshrined proposal builder separation enshrined PBS, we no longer have the relays. And so what might be a short term censorship vector won't be in the long term. And realistically we'd be looking at, let's say, 18 months after the merge, at least for enshrined PBS to come in.
00:37:45.106 - 00:37:48.350, Speaker A: But it can be prioritized if necessary.
00:37:48.510 - 00:38:30.720, Speaker B: What you're saying is, from a relays perspective, once we have protocol builder separation enshrined in the protocol, then relays are no longer a vector for censorship. But that change is coming, maybe not next hard fork, but the hard fork after, let's call it, which could be like 18 months plus away. And so in that window of time, we do have a censorship vector for relays. But longer term, you're not concerned about it because of protocol builder separation that's already on the roadmap. We have a defined solution to that. We just need to implement it. Am I getting that correct?
00:38:31.330 - 00:39:10.370, Speaker A: That's correct. And there's another piece of good news, is that for the relays, we benefit from what's called an honest or non censoring minority. We just need one or few relays to be non censoring, and that's enough. And the reason is that it gives the option to proposers who don't want to censor, to be using these non censoring relays. And one of the events that happened recently with flashbots is that they open sourced their relays. And so that gives anyone in the world the ability to just spin up a server and not have the censorship as part of the relay node, we'll.
00:39:10.390 - 00:39:11.834, Speaker C: Go on to the next part of the stack.
00:39:11.962 - 00:39:59.654, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. So that would be interfaces. And I'm thinking here, things like metamask and Aave. So the reality is that today the interfaces are largely centralized. But the good news is that there is a very clear roadmap towards decentralizing these front ends. So if you take metamask, for example, really what we want to be having is an in browser like client. So instead of having to go through RPC endpoints, which is operated by inferior, we have our own like client running within our browser or on our computer, and then we're not subject to the censorship.
00:39:59.654 - 00:40:21.250, Speaker A: And the good news here is that proof of stake like clients are significantly simpler to build than proof of work like clients. So assuming that this was kind of a friction point for metamask in the past post merge, I guess there should be a reasonable expectation that metamask.
00:40:23.190 - 00:40:23.506, Speaker B: Will.
00:40:23.528 - 00:41:31.450, Speaker A: Move towards light clients. Another thing with front ends is around the domains and the hosting. So we have Ens domains, they don't have perfect integration, but we have more and more integrations, sometimes native to browsers. And over time, I expect that more and more browsers will have native integrations with ens, and that there won't be censorship there. You can also use ipfs for the static content, and you can also combine that with filecoin, whereby you're in a position to pay to make sure that the data which is on ipfs is served reliably. And in terms of the dynamic content, this is more ambitious than static content. But there are projects like the graph, for example, that have this ambition to process and index web3, and do so in a decentralized fashion, so that you don't have censorship.
00:41:31.450 - 00:41:39.260, Speaker A: And I think what will happen is that basically there will be incremental improvements to decentralization for these front ends over time.
00:41:39.630 - 00:42:40.160, Speaker B: Okay, so from the front end perspective, the interfaces perspective, the Ethereum solution would be we've got light clients for something like metamask, and then we have also something like Ens for domain names, and then we have decentralized storage providers like IPFs and Filecoin. And so all of these are being worked on. And also from a data indexing perspective, we have solutions like the graph. And you think through this kind of cocktail of solutions, we can be in a much better place from an interface perspective to not be decentralized. I've also seen some teams, like uniswap, for example, basically open source their entire front end so someone else could run it. So you could run this in maybe a different jurisdiction without the same censorship issues. Does that help solve it as well?
00:42:41.250 - 00:42:58.310, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. And I think there's actually maybe an opportunity for a dow to come forward and curate and maintain this decentralized set of front ends, most of which are open source. And so, as you said, it's very easy to copy and just remove the censorship.
00:42:58.650 - 00:43:38.786, Speaker C: Justin, for the listeners, can we just quickly clarify what a light client is? My mental model for light clients is that you are able to create a version of Ethereum that's native to your computer, kind of like running your own node, but it's a lot faster, a lot lighter, hence the name lite clients. And instead of having to call infira or alchemy to ask, what is the state of Ethereum? And also, can you broadcast my transaction? You can get a light client spun up in your browser pretty damn quickly. That allows for you to have your own sovereign vision of the Ethereum chain and being able to broadcast your own transactions. Is that a fair definition for light clients, or what would you add to that?
00:43:38.968 - 00:44:10.634, Speaker A: Exactly. So there's kind of two components to a light client. The first one is figuring out what the tip of the chain is. And here for proof of stake, we have what are called sync committees. And the reason they're called sync committees is that they help you sync up to the chain as a light client. And this is ultra lightweight in the sense that you have to download a few aggregated BLS signatures, verify them, and then, tada. You're kind of synced up to the head of the chain.
00:44:10.634 - 00:44:54.838, Speaker A: The other aspect of like clients, once you are aware of the head, is to basically make queries. So like clients have the ability to read the full state of Ethereum and make arbitrary queries, at least fairly simple queries. And the way that you do that is by asking other full nodes that are willing to serve these, like, client queries. So instead of making requests to inferior, you could make a request to any full node that is accepting of like quant queries. And so long as you have a few non censoring full nodes that are answering these queries, then you have censorship resistance.
00:44:55.014 - 00:45:41.962, Speaker C: So this concept of routing around is now coming to mind. And just to recap where we are thus far, if we have a centralized front end that is censoring our transactions, we can route around that censoring front end with alternative front ends using something like ipfs or ENS names, or a front end that is in a different jurisdiction, another centralized front end, but it's outside of the United States, for example. And famously, of course, there's seemingly hundreds of different ways of accessing Uniswap that are through other centralized front ends. Call it zapper Xerion. Pick your interface. Or you could actually go to the IPFS version of the Uniswap front end. And so if the uniswap front end is banning you, there are many, many different ways to route around that front end.
00:45:41.962 - 00:46:39.910, Speaker C: And so that's one way to get around censorship. And now with what we're talking about with RPC endpoints, things like the centralization and possible censorship vectors of infira or alchemy or metamask, we can route around having to be dependent on those centralized node providers if they are censoring, because we have this technology called light clients that makes it trivially easy to access the parts of Ethereum that you need to access in order to do your defi, things like Uniswap or tornado cash or whatever. And so we have these different mechanisms for routing around both the centralized front end, but then also the stack behind that, which is infuria or alchemy, or these RPC providers with things like light clients. Justin, let's keep on going down the stack a little bit deeper to proposers and builders, seeing people that actually put our transactions into blocks, how do we get around censorship, potential censorship, from these parties.
00:46:40.070 - 00:47:54.206, Speaker A: Right? So the builders are the brains in the sense that they order transactions optimally, so that they maximize the value of the block, they maximize the transaction fees and the MeV. And so if the builders are censoring, there is something which I call altruistic self building. It's this idea that proposers can build their own blocks, for example, using the tried and tested naive block building strategy, which just orders transactions in the mempool, decreasing by tip. And so if you're building your own blocks, then you can make sure that yourself are not censoring. One downside here is that you have reduced income for the self building proposals. It's a little hard to quantify right now, but it could be like 1% APR or something like that. There is also this kind of interesting hybrid solution where you self build by default, but you fall back to this proposal builder separation.
00:47:54.206 - 00:48:50.994, Speaker A: If there is enough of a revenue delta. So if it so happens that builders are able to create a block which is significantly better than what you're able to build, then you don't want to miss out on this revenue. Then you can opt in to using blocks built by builders. And one of the interesting things about altruistic self building is that we only need a small minority of people to be doing that. And there's been some vocal people in the community, for example, superfiz, that have been advocating for self building. And even if we have, let's say, just 10% of proposers that are self building, that's enough to maintain a pretty decent user experience in the short term. And Ethereum is known to have altruistic actors.
00:48:50.994 - 00:49:14.378, Speaker A: We have thousands of people running Ethereum nodes around the world without any incentivization. They basically doing so at a financial loss. And yet these people deeply care about Ethereum. And so I think there will be a non negligible portion of people self building in the short term.
00:49:14.554 - 00:49:37.510, Speaker B: And of course, the builders are those that are actually ordering the transactions. They're not the ones that are proposing them for inclusion. Those that are proposing them for inclusion, those are more of the validators. Can we talk about that group? How do we protect against proposer centralization or validator centralization?
00:49:38.170 - 00:50:26.470, Speaker A: Right, so this is where MeV smoothing comes in. So the idea of MeV smoothing, by the way, it comes from MeV research, and there's a lot of intersections between weak censorship, resistance and MeV. And all the tools that we've built for MeV apply here. So the idea of MeV smoothing is that as a proposer, you have very little choice. You either accept the top paying bid from the builders, or you don't get to include a block at all. So it's a very binary thing where you don't get any discretion. You're basically reducing the role of proposing in a single slot to one bit.
00:50:26.470 - 00:51:52.926, Speaker A: Either you pick the top paying block or you don't, in which case you lose all the MEV and all the tips and all the reward associated with that block. And the way that it works is basically the attesters are only going to attest to the block that you're proposing if they observe it to be the most economically paying block. And so that's basically one way to remove the power that the proposers have. And then there's another piece of technology which is known as censorship resistance lists, or CR lists. Maybe there's some better names, for example, transaction inclusion lists, or padding transactions. And the idea here is that it's a mechanism to fight against the builders without having to incur a financial loss. And the way that it works is that as a proposer, I am going to put forward some transactions that I think are being censored, and these transactions must be included in blocks that are not full.
00:51:52.926 - 00:52:49.806, Speaker A: So basically, you're constraining the builder to build blocks that must include these transactions if indeed these blocks are not full. And as we know, most of the blocks with EIP 1559 are not full. Roughly 80% of the blocks have at least 1 million gas, which is unused. And if you want to have all the blocks being completely full, then the base fee will kind of rise exponentially, and then eventually there will be blocks that are not full. So this is a way, basically, for proposers to simultaneously have the benefits of proposal builder separation. Basically have the maximum income that you can get, while at the same time being able to force through some transactions that you believe are being censored.
00:52:49.998 - 00:53:34.420, Speaker C: And so at this point in the stack, we're pretty deep in the weak censorship part of Ethereum. So we're much deeper than front ends, we're well deeper than infira. And so now we're at the point of the mem pool, and we're starting to talk about mechanisms that force block proposers and block producers to include transactions that are in a list into the actual blockchain. How can we go through, how do they actually become forced? How does that enforcement happen of block proposers must include these transactions in this CR list, this censorship resistant list. How does that happen?
00:53:35.190 - 00:54:36.546, Speaker A: Right. So the way that it works is that before the slot of the proposer, the proposer has the opportunity to advertise transactions that they think are being censored. And basically, it's a constraint to the builders. And the proposers are basically saying, please build blocks with this constraint that you must include these transactions. If you don't include these transactions, then your block is not even valid and won't make it on chain. So basically, it's a way for proposers to impose some sort of preference over the builders, as opposed to the builders, just nilly willy being able to impose whatever policy that they want on the chain. So the reason why we came up with these transaction inclusion lists is because we were worried about a scenario where the building market becomes extremely centralized.
00:54:36.546 - 00:55:12.606, Speaker A: That might be like a handful of block builders. And the reason that the blockbuilding market could become centralized is because it's very sophisticated. You might need an army of phds and a lot of fancy algorithms and lots of computational resources to build these optimal blocks. And so basically we wanted to design a release valve for the proposers, which we assume some fraction are going to be wanting to not censor, to force through these transactions by constraining what these builders can do.
00:55:12.788 - 00:55:51.910, Speaker C: And so listeners who read my article not too long ago titled like the Ethereum watershed, will be familiar with this flow, but there's a very specific flow of transaction inclusion in the future. Ethereum and Justin's already talked about the idea of searchers, and that's where this flow starts. You have MeV searchers that bundle up a bunch of transactions into a bundle. Then you have block builders who add all these bundles together to build a block. And that makes it really easy for block proposers, who are also called Ethereum stakers. These are the same people. Block proposers and ethereum stakers, or ETH validators, are the same people, same name.
00:55:51.910 - 00:57:01.038, Speaker C: And so the idea here is that we are worried that block builders, the people that construct a block, that make block construction very easy for proposers, because they're doing all of this work of ordering transactions on behalf of the ETH stakers. What we're worried about is that activity becomes very professionalized and not really accessible. And again, accessibility is another core primitive that we want to have instantiated into the values of Ethereum. And so what we're saying here with this CR list is that the proposers actually go back to the block builders and say, hey, when you are building me a block, you got to include all of these transactions, or else I'm not going to propose it. And so it puts the power into the hands of the ETH stakers, who are designed as an entity, as a cohort of people, to be much more decentralized than block builders. And so we have the possibility of solo stakers. Just run your own node, stake your own 32 ETH, and these people have the power over, perhaps centralized block builders and say, hey, it's great that you can build me blocks, but you got to build me blocks with these transactions in it, or else I'm not going to accept that block.
00:57:01.038 - 00:57:23.260, Speaker C: And that's how we have this forcing mechanism to ensure that all transactions ultimately get included into the blockchain, because we're putting power into the hands of a more decentralized set of the Ethereum blockchain supply chain. Now, I'm still a little bit confused on mev smoothing. How does mev smoothing kind of fit into this flow? And what's the mechanism behind that. And what does that do?
00:57:23.710 - 00:58:42.478, Speaker A: Right. So the idea of mev smoothing is to try and have some sort of perfectly efficient market and remove the discretion that proposers might have, because proposers always have, at least today, they have the option to have their blocks be built by censoring builders. So in almost the same way that censorship resistance lists work, where they say, builder, please include these transactions, the proposers can say, hey, builder, please don't include these transactions. So basically, this technology of constraining the builder is a neutral technology that can be used in either way. And so what we want to do, instead of having proposers have this discretionary power, we want to remove this discretionary power. And the way we do that is that we ask the attesters to observe the block building market. So what is the block building market? Basically, you have a bunch of builders who at every slot produce a block header, and that header contains a bid.
00:58:42.478 - 00:59:24.574, Speaker A: So this bid is how much the proposer will get if the block header gets included on chain. And so basically what we're asking our testers to do is to find the top paying bid and only attest if the proposer has included that top paying bid. And so in a way, what we're doing here is that we're forcing the auction to be fair in the sense that whoever's paying the most for their block has a guarantee that their block will be chosen or that no other block will be chosen. So we're reducing the discretionary power of proposers to just a single bit.
00:59:24.772 - 00:59:48.680, Speaker C: And now, Justin, we're pretty damn deep in this stack that I keep on referencing, but there's one last layer deeper, which is the mempool in its entirety. And we have this idea of an encrypted mempool, which I think is really just like this very strong final line of defense of preventing censorship of transactions. Can you go into this encrypted mempool mechanism and talk about what it does?
00:59:49.290 - 01:00:30.370, Speaker A: Right. So if we zoom out, we have two different types of auctions within the block building process, at least two. One is the block auction process, and the other one is the transaction one. So censorship, resistance and mev smoothing is all about improving the block auction. Can we also improve the naive transaction auction? And the answer is yes. And the idea of encrypted mempools is that as a user, you are going to encrypt your transaction before broadcasting it. And only once the transaction is included on chain does it get decrypted.
01:00:30.370 - 01:01:48.714, Speaker A: So what you get, basically, is this in flight encryption, which basically prevents the sensors from knowing the contents of the transactions during this block building process, which makes it essentially very hard for them to apply the censorship. So, for example, if a certain jurisdiction says you can't send transactions, you can't include transactions that have this type of sender address or this type of destination address. Well, now, these sender and destination addresses are encrypted, at least in flight, before these transactions get included on chain. And so it becomes much, much harder to censor. And this technology was actually initially thought of in the context of MEV, right? Because if, as a user, you don't leak the contents of your transactions while it's in flight, it can't get front run. And so encrypted mempools kind of kills two birds with 1 st. On the one hand, it removes toxic MeV and front running, and it also improves the transaction auction against the censorship.
01:01:48.714 - 01:02:01.826, Speaker A: And so it's this defense in depth idea where, in theory, MEV smoothing and censorship resistance lists could be sufficient. But we have this extra layer of.
01:02:01.848 - 01:02:16.360, Speaker C: Defense with encrypted mempools and this encrypted mempool thing. It sounds really strong. It's like putting a cloak of invisibility around the entire mempool and really just reducing the options.
01:02:18.330 - 01:02:19.366, Speaker A: That people have, that.
01:02:19.388 - 01:02:37.818, Speaker C: Block proposers have or block builders have, just like, well, I don't know what that transaction does, so I'm just going to include the one with the highest fee. And there is no really way to understand what that transaction does, whether it's like a tornado cash transaction or just a uniswap trade until after it gets included into the blockchain. Is that the gist?
01:02:37.994 - 01:03:48.158, Speaker A: Yeah, that's correct. I mean, in theory, there is a way to break it, which is that as a block builder, you can require your users to have some sort of short cryptographic proof. For example, proving that your transaction, which is encrypted, is compliant. And so it's not a perfect strategy. But then it goes back to, what level of paranoia are you assuming? Like, how dystopic is your nation state? What kind of personal freedoms do you enjoy? Like, in many countries, at the very least, you have the ability to own private keys. That's like a fundamental pillar of personal freedoms. If we fight for this idea of in flight encryption, which will last only a few seconds, you only have privacy for a few seconds, then maybe in many countries, it would be reasonable to not mandate this additional cryptographic proof.
01:03:48.334 - 01:04:15.834, Speaker B: So, Justin, we haven't gotten to strong censorship yet, which we're going to in just a minute. And I want to kind of conclude this section. But just one thought that comes to mind is some people are listening to you describe the solution to weak censorship. And they're hearing many different solutions here. And it sounds relatively complex. And we haven't talked about dates for this. It sounds almost like a patchwork of different defenses.
01:04:15.834 - 01:04:59.290, Speaker B: And know, and maybe this is because I just recently went to London and visited some castles over there. But this is kind of the way defense works, right? Say the analogy of a castle, right? You fortify a wall over here, you build another tower there, you increase your fortifications, and you dig a moat, you install an entirely new perimeter wall. This is sort of how you fortify a network. And so all of these are not just, like, single shot approaches, but we are going through a fortification process to try to solve weak censorship. Is that how we should be thinking about it? And what's the overall timeline on these solutions?
01:04:59.630 - 01:05:50.550, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's a good way to think about it. Another way to think about it is this divide and conquer strategy. So we have multiple actors in the pipeline, and how can we remove some of them from being able to censor? And so we talked about Mev smoothing as basically removing the relevance of proposers like proposals just become dumb pipes that do one thing, which is just select the highest buying block. And so they are no longer a concern in the big picture. And one of the things, interesting things about encrypted mempools is that they might actually be able to remove builders, or at least to a very large extent, from the picture. And the reason is that the vast majority of transactions can be encrypted. And so it just looks like white noise.
01:05:50.550 - 01:06:40.918, Speaker A: And so the naive way to build a block, which is just to look at the pool of encrypted transactions and order them by tip, could just work just fine from a validator on a raspberry PI. That's self building. There's no need for sophistication there. And so my guess is that for the vast majority of transactions, let's say 95% of the transactions, we won't need a builder, and they will be self built. And the remaining 5% is where all the really fancy stuff will happen, like arbitrage and liquidations and whatnot. And so the block building process will be narrowed down to just this top 5% of the transactions, thereby reducing the power that the builders have.
01:06:41.104 - 01:07:15.270, Speaker B: Okay, so let's conclude this before we move on. Conclude the section on weak censorship here. So, of course, weak censorship just sort of delays a transaction. But you've described a whole bunch of different technologies and solutions at various points in the blockchain supply chain of how we address the censorship vectors through technology. So, overall, does Ethereum have a solution to this? What's kind of the end game for weak censorship with Ethereum? Is this thing solvable?
01:07:16.250 - 01:08:37.570, Speaker A: So, yes, it might sound like a strong claim, but I believe that we have the technology, at least at the research level, to effectively completely remove weak censorship. We'll be in a position where if you make a transaction and this transaction can be included in a block, then it will be included in a block, either because your transaction is encrypted and or because the proposers have no discretionary power and they have to include it because it's part of the highest building block and or because even in the case where all the builders are censoring, which is a very extreme position to take, there will still be a release valve where the proposers can themselves force through the inclusion of these transactions. And one of the, I guess, interesting things here is the concept of antifragility. So we have this endgame, and the more we're being attacked, the sooner we're going to see this endgame, because every attack is an opportunity to accelerate the inevitable, like total hardening of Ethereum from the perspective of weak censorship.
01:08:37.990 - 01:08:48.706, Speaker B: So what you're saying, effectively is every time Ethereum gets attacked in one of these weak censorship type of ways, it's an opportunity to kind of get stronger. It's almost like a hydra in that way.
01:08:48.808 - 01:08:49.758, Speaker A: Exactly. Yep.
01:08:49.854 - 01:09:35.310, Speaker C: Juno is bringing crypto friendly banking straight into your checking account. With Juno, you can send money from your Juno checking account straight onto a L2 like polygon, optimism, arbitrum, and they have Zksync and Starknet support on their way. You can skip the Ach wait times, you can skip all the gas fees and go straight from your checking account to an Ethereum L2 in seconds. Inside Juno, you can buy and sell crypto with zero dollar fees, and your Juno checking account comes with a metal mastercard that gives you up to 5% cash back on your spending. Juno is also giving you $10 cash back on your first crypto deposit, and $100 when you set up a direct deposit. This ad just writes itself, so go sign up at Juno Finance. Bankless Zksync is an Ethereum L2 network that is pushing the frontier of high performance blockchains that don't compromise on security or decentralization.
01:09:35.310 - 01:10:19.358, Speaker C: Zksync has combined the power of zero knowledge rollups in the Ethereum virtual machine, enabling developers to build the greatest web3 projects possible, ones we haven't even seen yet. Crypto needs its killer applications to onboard the world, but crypto killer apps need Zksync as a platform to build on first. It's generally accepted that zero knowledge roll ups are the conclusion of crypto blockchain scaling technology. And Zksync is leading the charge into the final frontier of crypto economics. So if you're a developer who wants to build your app on a future proof foundation which gives your users the best ux possible, check out Zksync's website at zksync IO. And yes, there's also going to be a token, so give them a follow on Twitter too. At zksync, the Brave browser is the user first browser for the web3 Internet with over 60 million monthly active users.
01:10:19.358 - 01:10:46.566, Speaker C: And inside the brave browser you'll find the Brave wallet, the secure, multitrain crypto wallet built right into the browser. Web three is freedom from big tech and Wall street, more control and better privacy. But there's a weak point in web3. Your crypto wallet and most crypto wallets are browser extensions which can easily be spoofed. But the brave wallet is different. No extensions are required, which gives brave browser an extra level of security versus other wallets. Brave wallet is your secure passport for the possibilities of web3 and supports multiple chains including Ethereum and Salana.
01:10:46.566 - 01:11:05.678, Speaker C: You can even buy crypto directly inside the wallet with ramp. And of course you can store, send and swap your crypto assets, manage your nfts, and connect to other wallets and DFI apps. So whether you're new to crypto or you're a seasoned pro, it's time to ditch those risky extensions. And it's time to switch to the brave wallet.

01:11:05.764 - 01:11:41.066, Speaker B: Okay, well, let's turn to strong censorship because I have a feeling the solutions around this are not completely solved or the attack is a little bit different. This is, I don't know if it's a bit less like enemies at the gate and a bit more like the enemies inside of the castle. It's a more pernicious attack. It's harder to defend against. And of course, as we described earlier in the episode, this means that the censored transaction never actually gets included on chain. It means the transaction gets censored completely orphaned. It's like full censorship is another name for this, or permanent censorship.
01:11:41.066 - 01:12:01.060, Speaker B: So I think we've described it fairly well, and what the consequences of a network like Ethereum, a protocol like Ethereum losing its strong censorship characteristics. But can we talk a little bit about the solution here? So, Justin, how do we solve the strong censorship problem?
01:12:01.750 - 01:12:45.700, Speaker A: Right. So I think there's two things that we can do. One is that we can have preventative measures, basically make it extremely hard to even get in such a position. And then the other aspect is basically recovery. If we are being attacked, how do we recover? Now, at a high level, the recovery is the recovery of a 51% attack. And it involves forking away, it involves, ironically, censoring the censorer. And one of the things that we want to try and do here is automate the process as much as possible.
01:12:45.700 - 01:13:16.970, Speaker A: And this is something we can discuss. But, like, roughly speaking, 80% of the process can be automated. And then we kind of need the social layer to kick in, to enshrine or confirm the fork, the recovery. But I guess before talking about the recovery, it might be worth talking about the preventative measures. What can we do to make it really hard to get into this bad situation in the first place? One thing we can.
01:13:17.120 - 01:13:38.500, Speaker C: Before we do that, Justin, can we actually just talk about how this concept of strong censorship and a 51% attack is actually the same thing? Because I think that might actually help listeners kind of wrap their heads around what we're actually talking about. If we're talking about strong censorship, how is it basically the same thing as, like, a 51% attack on a blockchain? How are those similar?
01:13:38.870 - 01:14:18.058, Speaker A: Right. So strong censorship is a special type of 51% attack. It's when the economic majority has taken over the chain and is compromising the liveness of the chain. So there's two aspects to security. There's safety and there's liveness. The good news with safety is that we have the so called finality gadget, which means that if there's a 51% attack and the history is rewritten, then there's automatic slashing. So that's something that we can deal with completely automatically, without any involvement from the social layer.
01:14:18.058 - 01:15:02.430, Speaker A: But there's another type of 51% attack, which is a liveness 51% attack. And censorship is a special type of liveness 51% attack. And here it's a little bit more subtle, it's a little bit more subjective, and we can't fully deal with it automatically. Instead, kind of the best thing that we can hope for is trying to maximize the amount of things that we do automatically and minimize the involvement of the social layer. And the reason we want to try and do that is around credible neutrality. We want to have recovery mechanisms which are credibly neutral and minimize the involvement of humans.
01:15:03.490 - 01:15:30.070, Speaker B: All right, so we got these two pieces here. We've got, number one, the preventative measures we can take, just making this a very high bar to attack Ethereum. And then secondly, we have kind of the recovery piece of it. How can the community, from a social layer perspective, censor the censor? But let's start with the preventative measures. Then how do we make this a very high bar to do a strong censorship attack on Ethereum?
01:15:30.410 - 01:16:39.366, Speaker A: So one of the things we can focus on is diversity, and specifically jurisdictional diversity, because realistically, the only type of actor nowadays that can go perform these 51% attacks are nation states. And so just like we've had this kind of battle at the social layer in terms of client diversity, with prism originally having 70% of all the validators and now only having 35% of the validators, we can go through a similar process to try and improve jurisdictional diversity. And what that means is that we want validators to be operated from all sorts of jurisdictions. And just like we have clientiversity.org, which has been tracking the diversity of the clients, we kind of need a similar website for jurisdictional diversity. We can also focus on operator diversity. So this is something quite related.
01:16:39.366 - 01:17:12.070, Speaker A: And we have already a website for this called rated network, which kind of gives you a breakdown of where the stake is from an operator standpoint. And we can also focus on similar things like geographical diversity. So we might want to spread the validators across five different continents, just in the same way that we have five different consensus clients. And we kind of spread out the stake.
01:17:12.730 - 01:17:18.130, Speaker B: And Justin, you have to do all of that at the social. Right. Like, we can't design that in the protocol in any way.
01:17:18.220 - 01:17:31.130, Speaker A: Exactly. So this is a social battle, and you can think of it as being a social shield, which is kind of invisible, but there and playing a really crucial role.
01:17:32.130 - 01:18:54.194, Speaker C: And this should make intuitive sense when we say that we want a bunch of ETH validators, eth stakers to be geographically distributed, when we also say that we believe Ethereum to be this extra national entity, it's this thing that is not owned or operated by any one specific nation state. So you could imagine if every single Ethereum validator happened to exist inside the United States. Well, at that point, then every single validator is beholden to the laws of the United States. And so we need all these validators to be across every single continent in order to claim that we are creating the system that exists beyond the nation state. And this is why it's so important that we have focused in the ethereum ecosystem on reducing the barriers to becoming an estaker down to the absolute minimum, where all you need is a consumer grade like laptop and access to the Internet, and you can take part in consensus, and you can do that with 32 ETH, or even lower than that with other innovations like rocket pool or Opal's distributed validator technology. So the idea here is that not only are we geographically distributed, we're also culturally distributed, too. It doesn't matter what culture you're from or what part of the continent or what part of the world you're from, is that you can actually represent Ethereum and its values, and there is no centralization into a certain set of laws.
01:18:54.194 - 01:19:08.490, Speaker C: And that's what creates Ethereum, to have this globally relevant and also censorship resistant nature in the fact that no country actually has a claim on Ethereum. Because we're all so well distributed.
01:19:09.070 - 01:19:56.886, Speaker A: Exactly. And if you were to kind of zoom out and ask yourself, how can an attacker acquire 51% of the stake? There's kind of two ways that they can do so. One is through coercion, and the other one is just through buying stake. And here, this idea of focusing on diversity is to minimize the impact of coercion. It's trying to remove these central choke points. So it could be, for example, like one staking pool, which is especially large and is in one specific jurisdiction, that becomes a choke point for coercion. And so if they have, let's say, 20% of the stake, then in one fell swoop, this 20% could go from non censoring to censoring.
01:19:56.998 - 01:20:18.130, Speaker C: So what about things like staking pools, Justin, where we have Lido, which has a very large amount of eth stake, but we also have things like rocket pool. Is it okay to have staking pools grow large? Is there a way to both have staking pools, which gives further access to being a part of network consensus while also maintaining censorship resistance?
01:20:19.270 - 01:21:22.630, Speaker A: Right. So one of the things that you want to try and do is, first of all, have a plurality and a diversity of staking pools, but also make sure that these staking pools are themselves very difficult to coerce. And this is where the decentralization comes in. So, for example, Lido is a Dao, and Rocketpool is also a Dao. And Daos are, in a way, their own jurisdictions just like Ethereum is, they're their own network states. And so we want to be trying to incorporate these staking pools within these micro jurisdictions that are created for the purpose of securing Ethereum. So if we are going to be forced to a future of staking pools, which is debatable, but let's assume it is, then we want to be participating in staking pools which are incorporated in non sovereign jurisdictions.
01:21:22.630 - 01:21:27.560, Speaker A: Basically, we want to be incorporating in network states, not nation states.
01:21:29.130 - 01:22:10.598, Speaker B: It's kind of cool because a lot of the defenses or the preventative measures against these strong forms of censorship are actually at what David and I would call the layer zero. There's actually know you called it the social shield, and that's incredibly important. Right. So we're talking about diversity that happens at the social layer across jurisdictions. Also talking about an emphasis on solo versus pool staking wherever possible, making that easier. Getting into the mindset, not your keys, not your attestations, just in the way we've gotten in the mindset of not your keys, not your coins. And so I think deterrence, social education is a huge part of this.
01:22:10.598 - 01:22:52.180, Speaker B: We also have some legal groundwork that we can start to do. So we have lobbyists in Washington, there are other crypto lobby groups all around the world, the coin centers and such, and creating a culture around activist type of staking. Right. So it is your patriotic duty to the Ethereum nation state to stake. I think bitcoiners in particular have done this very well with running bitcoin nodes, and I think we need to foster that sort of culture in Ethereum. But these are all of our defenses and preventative measures against strong forms of censorship attack here. It's all at the social layer, isn't it?
01:22:52.710 - 01:23:29.678, Speaker A: Yes, exactly. And activist staking is interesting. Basically, it's this idea that we can try and rebalance stake in order to make sure that we don't get in a bad position in the first place. So you can try and restake. For example, once withdrawals are enabled, you can take your stake from one place and point it to another place. This would be like redirecting hash rate from one pool or another. Or you can just bring in fresh stake, just like you could deploy fresh hash rate to try and balance things out.
01:23:29.678 - 01:24:35.574, Speaker A: Or there's also the option of just unstaking. Let's say that there is a jurisdiction which is particularly dystopian, whereby not only are they forcing the pools and the exchanges to be acting a certain way, but they're also forcing the individuals to be censoring even if you're solo staking on your raspberry PI, then here one of the best options that you have is simply on staking. And so there's this idea of activist on staking. And one of the good news here is that you can still earn yield even if you on stake. And the reason is that we should expect the Eth yields on Defi, and the ETh yields on staking to more or less arbitrage and track each other. And one of the reasons is that if you can go borrow eth in defi for, let's say, 3%, and you can make 4% staking, then people will go borrow in DFI and just go stake. And so they'll arbitrage away this 1% difference.
01:24:35.574 - 01:25:21.682, Speaker A: So you can still be earning yield even if you're not staking, because you're part of a particularly dystopian network state. Now, one of the things worth highlighting is that activist staking in the context of proof of stake does not help with recovery. And this is one of the downsides of proof of stake versus proof of work. Generally speaking, proof of stake has, like, strictly better censorship resistance. But this is the one place where proof of work is better. Because in the context of proof of work, if an attacker has made a 51% attack, it is possible to redirect your hash rate. It is possible to bring in new hash rate to try and heal the system.
01:25:21.682 - 01:25:35.990, Speaker A: But with proof of stake, once an attacker has 51% of the stake, they can censor the deposits and the exits themselves, so that it becomes impossible to come in or impossible to restake.
01:25:38.970 - 01:26:35.878, Speaker C: We'll definitely touch on this in the recovery section, but I just want to highlight, as we close on this preventative section, all these various mechanisms, right? So we would love people to solo stake their ether across all continents, all over the world. We would love for people to do this activist staking that allows for censorship to not be fully expressed in the protocol. And then there's also just what we're focusing on in the layer zero, where we can also fight this in the nation state territory themselves, where we have people like coin center and other legal entities going after nation states to make sure that they don't even bother and accept ethereum as it is. And this is all preventative. This is all getting before there's an issue. But Justin, I'd like to turn this conversation to the recovery side. So we can imagine that there is an entity, an entity with perhaps a significant amount of stake.
01:26:35.878 - 01:27:05.140, Speaker C: Say, for example, the nation state has talked to Coinbase and to Lido. And these two entities have agreed that they are going to censor transactions under threat of going to jail. And so both Coinbase, Brian Armstrong and Lido are censoring transactions. And let's just again define what would that look like if Coinbase and Lido are censoring transactions? And how do we as a community go from there? How do we move forward from that point?
01:27:06.330 - 01:27:51.074, Speaker A: Right. So let's assume that an attacker has more than 50% of the attestations and they want to censor. I mean, I questioned the premise that Lido could be censored, partly because it's a dow and also partly because they have many different operators. But let's just assume that an attacker has more than 50% of the attestations. Then what they can do is basically only attest to blocks that don't include a certain type of transactions. And so you're in a position where you have strong censorship, some type of transactions don't go in. And here what you need to do is basically fork off.
01:27:51.074 - 01:29:18.990, Speaker A: You need to reboot the system, or at least exit the system so that the minority can coordinate on a fresh version of Ethereum. So basically you have a fork with two versions of Ethereum. You have the censored version and the non censored version. And here there's a whole design space, right? Are we going to hard fork? Are we going to soft fork? Are we going to try and do this manually? Are we going to try and do this automatically? But they all boil down to the same thing, which is this idea of the minority opting out from the tyranny of the majority and in the process kind of redeclaring sovereignty over the chain and the ability to, to maintain and uphold credible neutrality. Now, one of the things that is expensive about forking is that it involves a social layer. And this is something that can be messy, it can be slow, it can be very human intensive, it can be contentious. And so we want to try and come up with protocols, both in code and in the social layer that will just streamline everything to the maximum extent.
01:29:18.990 - 01:30:35.506, Speaker A: And so one of the high level ideas here is that we can have code that automatically creates a fork. You can think of it as like a template or a seedling. It's like a fork which has detected censorship and which has started the process of secession, basically, and independence. But there are technical limitations as to what you can do with full automations. So the first caveat is that in order to even be able to detect censorship, you need to be online. And so if you go offline and then censorship happens, and this forking process happens and you come back online after the fact, then you won't know which chain is legitimate and which chain has been censoring, because the process of detecting censorship requires you to be online. Another big caveat is related to like clients.
01:30:35.506 - 01:31:14.318, Speaker A: So the like clients often won't be online. They will be wallets that will only come online when they're being used. And so they can't even observe the mempool, right, because the detection of censorship happens by observing the mempool. You have a transaction which is pending in the mempool. It's not being included, therefore it's being censored. But you need to be observing the mempool to make this observation. And it's even worse for smart contract like clients.
01:31:14.318 - 01:32:25.210, Speaker A: So these are like clients that are embedded within a blockchain in order to build bridges between chains. And these likelions fundamentally cannot observe the mempools, the mempool. And so this is where the social layer needs to come in and patch up or strengthen this fork template into the real enshrined version of reality. There's a couple other caveats to this automatic forking. One is this idea that in order to come to consensus on censorship, there shouldn't be abnormally high peer to peer networking latency. If the Internet is a massive mess and people are not receiving packets properly, or things are being delayed or controlled by an attacker, then there could be some noise there at the networking level, which needs to be smoothened out and patched up at the social layer. And then another kind of caveat is that around this idea of automatic forking is that sometimes censorship could be accidental.
01:32:25.210 - 01:33:32.590, Speaker A: It could be a client bug which is fixed a few hours or a few days later. And this idea of automatic forking can't really discern intent. Is this real malicious intent, or is this like an innocuous client bug, which is being fixed? And so, just to recap, the strategy that is available to us is for full nodes that are online and observing the mempool to do several things. One, detect censorship, and then two, identify some sort of non censoring minority chain. And then three, kind of automatically fork off and punish the census. And all of these things can be done fully, in a fully automated way, except that the full nodes are not sufficient. We also want all the like clients and all the social layer to be following through this automatic fork.
01:33:33.490 - 01:34:13.466, Speaker B: So, Justin, I think it's probably news. It's actually, news to me. I never thought about the possibility of an automatic fork actually being triggered. But I want to even go back to automated or manual aside, what a recovery like this would look like, what a social fork would look like. So essentially we would have, in that world where we have some nasty censorship going on, there would be a new Ethereum that would fork from that. And that would be maybe the community would brand that as Ethereum, like the original Ethereum. This is what Ethereum is, censorship, resistance and the social contract.
01:34:13.466 - 01:35:19.570, Speaker B: And then there would be another branch, another fork that would continue on as the censored version of Ethereum. And essentially all of the actors in the Ethereum ecosystem, whether you're an ETh holder, whether you're just a user of the network, whether you have an asset like USDC that you're issuing, whether you are a smart contract developer, an app ecosystem provider, metamask, everyone would have to make a decision in terms of which of those two forks to support, or both. And ultimately what would happen is kind of the market would decide and the community would decide, as we have in past forks with Ethereum and with bitcoin. So bitcoin of course, went through a big fork of big block size debate, and what was left from that was bitcoin, and then bitcoin cash and a whole bunch of the twelve dwarves there of other bitcoins. And of course we know that bitcoin won because we can see it in terms of market cap. Then we had Ethereum and Ethereum classic. And we could sort of see which fork sort of won at least the mind share and the market.
01:35:19.570 - 01:36:12.180, Speaker B: And so we would go through another episode of this and everyone would have to choose the censored version of Ethereum or the original version of Ethereum. That was uncensorable. Let me ask you, what makes you confident or hopeful that people will actually choose the uncensorable version of Ethereum? I've had people say to you, Ethereum is described like this is pretty naive because providers like USDC, they will obviously choose the censored version of, you know, ultimately a lot of state will collect there, and they are the true dictators over which Ethereum fork gets adopted and which doesn't. Can you talk a bit about some of this?
01:36:12.870 - 01:37:24.380, Speaker A: Right, so I really like the way that you describe this process where we start with an automatic fork and that trickles into the social layer where it's being fought out. And one of the things that you can envision is the fork is automatic. This automatically spins up a futures market where you have these two tokens competing out, and then even before the fork happens, you have kind of a declared winner. Now to your question around could there be some impediments to forking at the social layer infrastructure like USDC might be compelled to go through and choose the censoring fork. And I guess there's two answers here. One is that it's important to pace ourselves, right? It's important to do these forks slowly, if not very slowly. So we have two types of consensus, right? We have the machine consensus, which operates on the timescale of seconds, and then we have the human consensus, which operates on the timescale of weeks.
01:37:24.380 - 01:38:26.160, Speaker A: And so one of the things that's important to do is for the automatic forking to happen with a lot of time in advance. And my specific suggestion here is that an automatic fork should only happen at most, let's say, with at least 30 days of lead time. And it must happen on the first Wednesday of the month at 12:00 p.m.. UTC. I kind of just created the selling points out of nowhere. I guess you could call that shelling point design, but trying to find something credibly neutral where we agree ahead of time, that this is when we fork. So that at the very least, the schedule has been set ahead of time, and it allows for the social layer to do its work of debating and lobbying and all of these things.
01:38:26.160 - 01:40:08.494, Speaker A: The second aspect is around the ability of gracefully winding down, right? So if you look at a project like USDC, they may well choose the censored fork. But what will happen is that if we allow the social layer to gracefully unwind, then they'll just lose most of their business. People will withdraw the USDC for real us dollars and exit USDC. Or what they might do is they might dump USDC for another stable coin like USDT, and then arbitrators can go buy this USDC at a small discount and then do the withdrawal there. And so we might see over a process of a few weeks, USDC go from a mammoth, let's say 100 billion dollar stablecoin project to a much smaller, let's say $10 billion stablecoin project. And so when you're designing these applications, whether or not they're fully trustless and truly decentralized finance, or whether they have the centralized component, what I think we're going to see is a desire from the social layer to have this graceful wind down process that takes, let's say, on the order of weeks. If there isn't such a graceful wind down, then the alternative would be like an instant collapse, which is something that we don't want.
01:40:08.494 - 01:40:38.710, Speaker A: And I think the market will be prioritizing products that provide this graceful wind down in the case where they themselves kind of become compromised. And this is a similar philosophy to what the core developers and the researchers are trying to do. We're trying to design systems where there is always an exit hatch, even if the creators of the projects go malicious.
01:40:39.210 - 01:41:40.522, Speaker B: Yeah, and I feel like this is the ultimate exit hatch and kind of the last exit hash and hatch. And maybe the most powerful is this kind of ability to fork and create an original ethereum that is completely uncensored. And of course we haven't gone into the details there, but my impression is there can be some forks that slash parts of the stake that are originally censoring, and we can get into that, but I want to get into the principle. I know we're talking about recovery here, but the threat of a fork is also preventative in and of itself, is it not? Because we are effectively saying that the social community, the layer zero of ethereum, is saying, hey, powers that be, if you decide to censor, we plan to fork. And by the way, if we have automated forking, we'll detect that automatically and it'll happen the second Wednesday of the month at 12:00 p.m. UTC time. Right.
01:41:40.522 - 01:42:06.374, Speaker B: They can see it on chain, and that in itself acts as a preventative mechanism for wouldbe censors to say no. Instead of censoring, if it's illegal in my jurisdiction to provide validation services and staking services, I'll just discontinue those services because I don't want to actually get into a place where I'm on the bad end of a fork and I'm losing depositors money. Can you talk about that dimension a little bit?
01:42:06.572 - 01:42:51.454, Speaker A: Yeah, you said it very well. Where basically education and infrastructure that we can put forward out there acts as a deterrent. Because now participants in this crypto economic game can be more rational. And it turns out that the equilibrium is for the chain to not be censored. Anytime you have a chain which is censored that puts the attacker in a precarious position because they can be forked off and they can be penalized. One of the things we haven't talked about is the penalization. But basically what we have at our disposal is the ability to completely wipe off the stake of the attacker.
01:42:51.454 - 01:43:59.898, Speaker A: And so the mere fact that this infrastructure exists, kind of from a rational standpoint, should prevent the attack from ever happening. This is very similar, by the way, to optimistic rollups. Right. With optimistic rollups, engineers have spent countless hours to design this fraud proof game, where if there ever is fraud, then someone can provably show to the optimistic roll up that there has been fraud and then revert and correct the state. But if you do commit fraud on an optimistic roll up, you get financially penalized. And so the equilibrium from a crypto economic game perspective is that the fraud never happens. Now, one thing could be said whereby it's all good to be resistant in theory and from a rational standpoint, but an attacker might be kind of stupid and kind of very determined to make an attack, and they'll go do it anyway.
01:43:59.898 - 01:44:37.270, Speaker A: And I think the best that we can hope for here is actually go through the process of forking off and prove to the world that it is not just theory, but it's actual practice. And ironically, this would put Ethereum in a stronger position from a censorship resistance standpoint, because it will already have gone through the legwork of recovering from a 51% attack. And so it would be really stupid for an attacker to try that a second time, because the first time round, they failed and they got penalized.
01:44:38.250 - 01:44:40.422, Speaker B: Is this us saying, like, we dare you?
01:44:40.556 - 01:44:44.360, Speaker A: Yeah, we dare you. I dare you, nation states to censor us.
01:44:45.770 - 01:45:53.210, Speaker C: It's one thing if, for example, perhaps it was like the CIA that was censoring Ethereum and the CIA had 51% of staked eth, I don't think there would be too much controversy, or much less controversy at the very least, if the Ethereum community was like, you know what? Let's just slash the entirety of the CIA, we'll just delete all of their ether. That would be one scenario. I think a far more reasonable and expected scenario is something a little bit along the lines of staking as a service protocols where they actually didn't have to buy the ether themselves. It was actually retail investors that bought the ether, and then they just staked with Coinbase and slashing Coinbase. If Coinbase is the one doing the censoring, but they're doing the censoring with their customers deposits, all of a sudden that becomes a lot less like. I don't really think the crypto community would shed a tear if we slashed the CIA, but if we know millions of retail investors savings of ether because they were staking with Coinbase, that would become a lot more politically hairy. Justin, what would you say is a solution to this scenario where it's actually retail deposits into a centralized staking provider that's actually doing the censoring.
01:45:53.370 - 01:46:30.246, Speaker A: Right. So there's several answers here. The first one is education and lead time. If there is censorship that's discovered, we want to give people the time to unstake from Coinbase. The other thing is that we want people to understand, even before they stake on Coinbase, that there is a risk associated with staking. Like there are real costs to delegation. And this is one of the reasons why in the long term, I think solo staking has a real shot at becoming dominant versus delegated staking through pools.
01:46:30.246 - 01:47:31.210, Speaker A: And one cost, which is obvious in Coinbase, is that you have to pay a 25% fee on the rewards. So you've been diligently staking on Coinbase for two years. Let's say you've made four EtH in profits. And one of that eth just goes away and is absorbed by Coinbase through fees. But there's other costs to delegation. One is this idea of insider risk, where not your keys, not your attestations, which means that an insider within Coinbase, who has access to the staking keys, which, by the way, are hot keys, they're not in cold storage, they can basically perform a ransom attack where they can say, hey, Coinbase customers, we are going to slash you unless you pay up a ransom. And the game theory is basically for the victim of the ransom to pay up the ransom.
01:47:31.210 - 01:48:53.926, Speaker A: And that's kind of a cost which is not visible, but it is there. And then another cost to delegation, which is not visible is this outsider risk, where basically the community, the social layer outside of consensus, might declare consensus to be a bad actor and then penalize. So when we penalize, we actually have a certain amount of power at our disposal. So one thing that we can do is, and is like, the most straightforward is to do a soft fork. And the idea of a soft fork is whereby the minority chain ignores the attestations of the attacker and leads to the attacker leaking out, basically accumulating so called inactivity penalties. And the best move for the attacker is to basically exit from the staking duties, go through the exit queue, and then recover and withdraw their ETH. But if we're going to force through 51% of the stake to go through the execute, the executue is going to last quite a long time, like several months.
01:48:53.926 - 01:50:18.740, Speaker A: And during these several months, there's going to be some inactivity penalties that accumulated and that might make up, let's say, a fairly small penalty on the order of one or 2%. So that I think is something which is acceptable from the social layer for Coinbase customers to be suffering one or 2% for putting their stake in the custodian, which ended up censoring. Now there are stronger options at our disposal, namely the option to do either a hard fork or a soft fork, which completely wipes out the stake of the attacker. And I think going back to this idea of being maximally, credibly neutral in our forking strategies, I think there's two forking strategies which stand out as being credibly neutral. The first one is you push attacking validators to the exit queue. Their ETH is kind of frozen effectively in the execute for a small amount of time, a few months, and they also incur this small penalty. And then if the attack happens a second time by the same attacker, then in that case, the next reasonable thing to do, which is credibly neutral, is to slash 100%.
01:50:18.740 - 01:50:46.380, Speaker A: And then there you basically remove the ability to do an attack a third time. But in the process of doing this forced exit, the customers of Coinbase are going to realize that something went really wrong, and it would be foolish of them to go ahead and restake with Coinbase knowing that the second most natural thing to do is to slash everything.
01:50:47.630 - 01:51:53.278, Speaker B: I want to make two points here. I mean, the first point is that this is only possible, this kind of like, inactivity leak and complete slashing of the stake is only possible in proof of stake was not an avenue Ethereum had available to it in proof of work. It's not an avenue that bitcoin has available to it, unless it, I guess, changes its core hashing algorithm and resets everyone from scratch, which is a lot different than this. And what we're seeing here is kind of a defined escalation path that the Ethereum community can start to distribute and educate people on, so that hopefully these risks start to get priced into the yield of a more centralized staking provider. Like, yes, it's good yield, but you have to take into account these centralization risks. The second point I want to make is we keep using Coinbase as an example, and I think that's maybe service to Coinbase, that they've done a good job. They're the kind of the largest staking provider in the US, and one that's most, at least in the US, most connected to kind of retail.
01:51:53.278 - 01:53:08.866, Speaker B: But there's also evidence that sort of the equilibrium that we talked about, the game, theoretic equilibrium, is playing out because Coinbase is nowhere close to creating a censorship only validation pool and staking pool, indeed. I think Brian Armstrong publicly, as in the last week or two, came out and said if they were ever asked by authorities to not process, to censor some transactions at the block production validator level, they would rather discontinue their entire business than proceed in that censorship. So this is like the charitable explanation of that is, Brian Armstrong's been in crypto. He has strong crypto values, and that's the reason why he's doing it, because he believes in the principles of decentralization. You want to take the cynical explanation. It's also that he realizes that censorship puts Coinbase down a path closer to mutually assured destruction, and he's trying to avoid that at all costs. So I just think all of these dynamics are very interesting, and this social slashing capability is incredibly powerful as a deterrence as well as kind of a recovery method.
01:53:08.866 - 01:53:12.540, Speaker B: Maybe you two have comments on that. And then, David, I think you had a question.
01:53:13.550 - 01:53:31.630, Speaker A: No, I think you summarized it very well. There's some very interesting dynamics at play, but ultimately, the heuristic is that the defender is in a position of power, and anytime the attacker comes in and censored, that's an unstable equilibrium, and they stand to be penalized.
01:53:31.970 - 01:54:05.046, Speaker C: Just to really drive this point home, there's just conversations around the illegitimacy of penalizing any retail depositor in a centralized staking service. We take our property rights very seriously in this crypto world. It's one of these core pillars that I would say crypto stands on, is that property rights are the thing that you do not violate the most. Like don't break property rights. That's what crypto stands on. Cryptography is meant to instantiate property rights. But I will make, and we've alluded to this, and I just want to make this super explicit.
01:54:05.046 - 01:54:53.462, Speaker C: When you decide to stake your ether on Ethereum, you are giving up some certain element of property rights and giving the Ethereum protocol control over your ether. That is what it means to stake your ether. You are staking your ether that you will behave a certain way. If you want to behave in any particular way that you want to, and have the strongest property rights possible, don't stake your ether. Because then that means that if you're staking your ether, you are committing to accepting slashing penalties or any sort of other penalties. And so if you are a retail depositor who's choosing to stake, you are taking on some sort of responsibility or some sort of risk that is super more powerful than your property rights. You are saying, like, I agree to the rules and laws of the Ethereum protocol beyond my rights to my own ether.
01:54:53.462 - 01:55:35.602, Speaker C: And whatever outcome happens as a result of me staking is what I agree to. And that's why we stake. And so this conflation of, oh, you can't slash coinbase because those are retail depositors. Well, actually the responsibility was on retail to choose their staking service provider correctly. And if their staking service provider is malicious, that is a responsibility that they are behoven to and that was their choice. And so I'd like to just really drive that point home is that when you choose to stake, you are actually giving up your property rights to the Ethereum protocol. And if you choose to stake with a centralized service provider, you are trusting that they are aligned with the Ethereum protocol or else they will also be slashed.
01:55:35.602 - 01:55:36.950, Speaker C: Justin, how do you feel about this?
01:55:37.020 - 01:56:31.446, Speaker A: Yeah, no, that's exactly right. And there is this meme circulating, which I think is a valid one, that when you're staking, it's basically like the risk minimized interest rate. But there's a huge caveat here, which is it's only if you're solo staking with your own keys, as soon as you're delegating, you're forfeiting this risk minimization aspect. And so I think we really need to do a bigger focus on solo staking. And one of the good news here is that there's many improvements that are coming to solo staking, and there's about ten of them. I'll just list a few things to be excited about. One is proposer builder separation.
01:56:31.446 - 01:57:04.430, Speaker A: This basically removes the requirement for validators to be block building. It's just one less task that they have to do. Mev smoothing. How does that improve solo staking? It improves it because it removes the variance in mev. What will happen with block building is that every once in a while you get really lucky and you get to build a block, and then you get an outside reward for this one single slot. And so that leads to very spiky returns and you want to smooth that out. Mev smoothing.
01:57:04.430 - 01:58:01.750, Speaker A: Smooth is the mev, as the name suggests, anti slashing hardware. No more slashing, accidental or not. So right now, as a solo staker, the best infrastructure that we have is for you to have your staking key be a hotkey on your computer. But really what we want to be in a position of having the staking key be in a piece of hardware that does slashing protection on your behalf. Basically, this piece of hardware will track what messages have been signed in the past, and make sure that you don't sign a message which accidentally slashes you. And maybe someone can write some code that will turn, for example, a ledger hardware wallet into antislashing hardware for validators. Another thing is single slot finality.
01:58:01.750 - 01:59:01.142, Speaker A: We're going to be in a position where making deposits and making withdrawals will be much, much faster, thanks to single slot finality. And that will yet again improve the experience of being a solo validator. There's also going to be statelessness and data availability sampling and zkvms, where basically the hardware cost of being a validator are going to go down to almost zero, like even less than a raspberry PI. The only thing in the end game that you're going to have to be verifying is this zero knowledge proof and just making a few queries to the network and not even have to download the data. You just do data availability sampling. These are like very powerful technological things that bring us to a position where being a solar validator is almost no effort. We're also going to have technology that is going to dramatically reduce the size that you need to become a validator.
01:59:01.142 - 02:00:02.810, Speaker A: Like, one of the reasons that people are sticking on Coinbase is because they don't have 32 e. Well, with technology like DVT and secret shed validators, and also improvements to the protocol where we have these potentially dynamic deposit sizes and variable deposit sizes, that's going to improve the user experience for stakers. And we might also envision things like private deposits and private staking, whereby in the process of participating in staking, you have your privacy preserved. And all of these things, when you compare them to the costs of delegation, which we've gone through, like operator fees, insider risk with ransom attacks, and outsider risk with social polarization, in my opinion, things tilt towards solo staking, but it's going to be a fairly long journey of incrementally improving solo staking.
02:00:03.310 - 02:00:51.894, Speaker B: Yeah, I think you're right about the long journey of that. And I guess one thing I do think you're right that one of the biggest impediments to solo staking is having 32 eth, right? And if we're right, and this is ultrasound money, and we get to ten k and beyond, that's 320k. So getting this down to like 16 e or even four etH, I would think that would be a necessary precondition. I guess the other comment I would make is sometimes, to your point about this being a slow process, sometimes crypto doesn't realize the benefits of decentralization until that quote, unquote tail risk event happens. Right. And I don't think these are actual tail risk events because they happen pretty commonly. But everyone is talking about the virtues of centralized lending platforms versus defi user experience is so much easier.
02:00:51.894 - 02:01:30.010, Speaker B: It just connects directly to my bank account, all of these things. And then we had Celsius, right? And like blockfi almost go insolvent as well. Now we appreciate the benefits of being able to audit and see what's actually backing the assets when we get a collateral loan or when we generate some interest on top of it. But all of these things, Justin, so where does that leave us? Strategically positioned for a strong censorship attack? How is Ethereum positioned for that? We talked about, you summarized the weak censorship attack, and you're like, we have the tech we can actually defend against this. Do you feel the same about strong censorship?
02:01:31.310 - 02:02:08.706, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think the strategy is kind of different if you're thinking in the short term, the medium term, or the long term. In the short term, I think one of the best things we can do is just education. Right. Education is something that we're doing right now. Right. There's very little latency to reacting, and that's kind of addressing some of the fud that's been circulating and kind of giving people the knowledge that they need to believe in the long term legitimacy of the roadmap.
02:02:08.706 - 02:03:44.334, Speaker A: I think what we want to be doing in the medium term is showing some strength in terms of actually implementing in code some of these defenses and kind of putting forward some of the, the most low hanging defenses in place. And this is something where we can take a strategic approach in the sense that we can keep defenses in the back pocket and then bring them forward and prioritize them when the need comes in. One of the dilemmas that we have within the research team is do we prioritize features, things like sharding, that kind of gives us all the scalability, or do we prioritize security? And I think where I've landed on personally is we want to prioritize features, right. Because we want to remain competitive compared to other blockchains, but we want to front load as much as possible the security research. Right. So we want to be in a position where we really understand deeply these crypto economic defenses. And whenever we need to defend ourselves, we have something ready in the back pocket, we prioritize it, and a few months later it's implemented on chain.
02:03:44.462 - 02:04:17.614, Speaker B: Yeah, I definitely agree with that. And it strikes me that we have definitely a lot of work to do on the social layer of how the community would react if censorship started being implemented across the chain. This is what I didn't understand the early days of my journey into crypto in bitcoin was people would say to me, it's like, well, what happens if there's some protocol kind of hack in bitcoin? And suddenly there's like a billion bitcoin rather than 21 million? In the early stages of my journey into crypto, I was legitimately worried about that. Well, code has errors, and what happens.
02:04:17.652 - 02:04:18.314, Speaker A: If there's a hack?
02:04:18.362 - 02:05:07.594, Speaker B: That sort of thing. Now I know the mechanisms and how this works. And of course, what the bitcoin community would just do is create a fork that maintains the social contract of 21 million. It would not be an existential threat or risk to bitcoin. There would be a blip, there would be a mud on the face. There would be definitely problems in the short run if suddenly bitcoin was inflating at a billion a day, a billion bitcoin a day, but the community would just fork that out and adhere to the social contract of 21 million, because that is written into the layer zero of what bitcoin is. I think Ethereum needs to also continue to write censorship resistance into its social contract and develop some of the plans that you were talking about as well, I guess, as we kind of draw to a close with this episode.
02:05:07.594 - 02:05:57.120, Speaker B: Justin, thank you so much for your time. This has been a great positioning, great getting us up to speed on the censorship resistance of Ethereum now and in the future. How do you think this compares to other cryptocurrencies? Right. So in our ultrasound money episode, we talked about bitcoin probably has more soundness than ethereum, than ether, the asset like pre merge, you could still say bitcoin is the reigning champion, has the greatest monetary premium above and beyond ether right now. Now, probably many of us don't think that will remain the case in the future. But what do you think about censorship resistance? How is ethereum positioned relative to other chains, say, bitcoin or other alternative layer ones, right now?
02:05:57.650 - 02:06:36.662, Speaker A: Right. So I guess there's two things to consider here. One is the weak censorship and the other one is the strong censorship. So in terms of the weak censorship, bitcoin has an advantage over ethereum. And the reason is that they have these very simple Utxo transactions where there's no real mev to be extracted. And so the whole pipeline of mev just collapses down to self building. So all the concerns that we may have around builders and relays and searchers and whatever, that mostly collapses down.
02:06:36.662 - 02:07:49.970, Speaker A: On the other hand, when we talk about strong sense, the ship bitcoin is in the same position, if not a worse position, than ethereum. And the reason is that more than 51% of the economic majority, basically the holders of the scarce resource, which is hash rate, could be compelled to censor. And there's kind of several reasons here. Like, one is, again, around the lack of diversity. So we've had miners, for example, leave China and go to Texas, for example. Well, if we have just too much hash rate in the US, then maybe miners in the US could be compelled to censor. Another thing that I haven't mentioned, but is very important as well, is also the concept of economic security, which is, how many dollars do you need to go just do a naive, brute force 51% attack, where you just buy the resource as opposed to coercing it.
02:07:49.970 - 02:08:29.018, Speaker A: And it turns out that in the case of bitcoin, it's dropping, and I expect it to keep on dropping. So right now, there's around 200 million terrahashes per second of hash rate. And you can go on bitmain.com and you can buy miners for $15 per terrahash per second. And so you do the math, and buying the hardware will cost you roughly $3 billion to go, 51% attack bitcoin. Of course, you need to buy transformers. You need to buy racks.
02:08:29.018 - 02:09:29.342, Speaker A: You need to connect it to the grid. Let's say, very conservatively, that you're doubling your costs. That brings you to $6 billion of economic security. It's still peanuts in the grand scheme of things for a nation state. And so what I think we need to be doing is for Ethereum not only focusing on jurisdictional diversity to reduce coercion, but we also want to have trillions of dollars of economic security so that it's infeasible to buy your way in to a 51% attack. And then the other kind of final point, which you mentioned, which is that from a recovery standpoint, bitcoin and Ethereum have very different solutions. Like, one is endogenous and the other one is exogenous.
02:09:29.342 - 02:10:50.250, Speaker A: So for bitcoin, the only way that you can recover from a 51% attack is to basically repoint hash rate or add in new hash rate. And basically, you're in a position where if your context, if the real world is just too powerful, then there's no way in which you can escape the censorship. So if, for example, you believe that the US can go spend, like, a few billion dollars to go buy asics to do censorship, then they can go do that and permanently 51% attack bitcoin because there isn't this ability to do this intrinsic recovery mechanism where a minority of the chain basically penalizes and slashes the majority. And so even if you have a bully which is extremely strong, we can still survive that and basically create our own minority bubble and preserve the sovereignty of this independent network state, which is Ethereum.
02:10:51.150 - 02:11:04.340, Speaker B: Dustin, thank you so much. Final question for you. As we draw this to a close, what's your confidence that Ethereum will be censorship resistant then in five years to an acceptable degree, and then how about in ten?
02:11:06.710 - 02:12:25.500, Speaker A: So if we're talking about weak censorship, then I think Ethereum in five to ten years will be close to perfection. It will be futile to try and censor transactions because you just won't be successful in terms of the strong censorship. I actually believe that today Ethereum is already extremely resistant to this strong censorship. I think we have inside us almost implicitly and culturally, we kind of feel this, we're on the same wavelength that we do want to preserve censorship resistance. I think the next step is just making this more explicit and kind of articulating this intuition that we all have and going beyond that, not just articulating that in words, but also articulating that in code, which is something we could do. But I think if Ethereum were to be attacked before we have all these code defenses, we would be more than happy as a community to perform a manual recovery of a 51% attack.
02:12:26.190 - 02:12:39.118, Speaker B: There you go, bankless nation. That's where we're going to end it today. Justin Drake, thank you so much for joining us and walking through the steps on what it's going to require to make an uncensorable ethereum. Appreciate you.
02:12:39.284 - 02:12:40.414, Speaker A: Thanks for having me.
02:12:40.532 - 02:13:33.294, Speaker B: Action items for you, bankless nation. You know, we're going to include a few, we're going to think hard about this and include a few links to you to get involved in the solo staking community. That's pretty important if we want to preserve censorship resistance at the base level, and also some opportunities to donate to crypto lobby groups who are fighting for our rights in various jurisdictions around the world, rights to private keys, rights to privacy, some of these basic rights that we were talking about in the episode. We'll also include a link to some other episodes we've done with Justin Drake, including ultrasound money episode. And there's one in particular, if you haven't listened to it around cryptography and the moon math, that is coming at us and the bullishness that we see from cryptography. Justin, I'm about to close, and I usually give the risks and disclaimers at this section, but would you like to take them from me this time?
02:13:33.492 - 02:13:53.030, Speaker A: For sure? Yes, it would be an honor. Crypto is risky. You could lose what you put in, including your stake if you put it with a centralized custodian. But we're headed west. This is the frontier. It isn't for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thank you.
