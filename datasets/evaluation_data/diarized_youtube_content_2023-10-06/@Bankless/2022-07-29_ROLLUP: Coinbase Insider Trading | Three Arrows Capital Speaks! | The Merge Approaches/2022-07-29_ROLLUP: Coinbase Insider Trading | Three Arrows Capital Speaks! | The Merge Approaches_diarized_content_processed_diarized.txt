00:00:00.170 - 00:00:01.854, Speaker A: Just remember, I'm the better looking one. Of course.
00:00:01.892 - 00:00:04.880, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I'm the one that actually exists in real life.
00:00:05.410 - 00:00:24.526, Speaker A: Yeah, David's the one that you're actually going to see at a conference. Hey, bankless nation. Happy last week of July. Summer is almost over, but happy Friday morning to you. We're going to be drinking a cup of coffee as we enjoy the weekly roll up. We hope you are as well. David, how you doing today?
00:00:24.628 - 00:00:36.454, Speaker B: Oh, absolutely fantastic, Ryan, some more. Three arrows capital fallout. We said last week that it was probably coming, but as far as it goes, that's like the only contagion stuff we have to talk about.
00:00:36.572 - 00:00:38.850, Speaker A: This is the last time we talk about 3 hours capital.
00:00:38.930 - 00:00:45.866, Speaker B: Well, I don't know about that, but the topics like Celsius seems to be over. Voyager's over is only 3 hours capital. That's left.
00:00:45.968 - 00:00:59.514, Speaker A: All right. We're getting some closure this week. Hopefully. We're also going to be talking about Coinbase. An employee got arrested for insider trading. You could be an insider trader at Coinbase. And there's some fallout with the SEC and Coinbase.
00:00:59.514 - 00:01:04.154, Speaker A: They got into another tussle and even the CFTC is weighing in on this. We're going to cover that as well.
00:01:04.212 - 00:01:17.954, Speaker B: Big drama. Big drama in the regulatory space. And the last testnet. The last testnet ever. This is the last step before the actual merge is scheduled. It's here. The Gorley testnet is coming in the 6th to twelveth of August.
00:01:17.954 - 00:01:23.480, Speaker B: We don't know when because it's set by a TTD number. We'll talk about that later. But Ryan, it's happening.
00:01:26.330 - 00:01:37.226, Speaker A: Lights in the background. That's great. As always, guys, this comes at you every Friday morning. This is the best way to recap your week in crypto. Hope you're joining us. And make sure you like. And subscribe if you are.
00:01:37.226 - 00:01:58.846, Speaker A: So if you're on YouTube, make sure you like this video and subscribe to the channel. And if you are listening to this on podcast, form, rate and review wherever you listen your podcast on Spotify. By the way, this is now in video version. We partnered with Spotify. They partnered with us. I don't know what are the other. We now have bankless video capability on Spotify, which gives us another platform beyond YouTube.
00:01:58.846 - 00:02:00.546, Speaker A: It's pretty cool. I enjoy it. Yeah.
00:02:00.568 - 00:02:11.510, Speaker B: If you're a Spotify listener, you can become a Spotify viewer. And then at the crypto conferences, people can stop mixing me and you up. That's great.
00:02:11.580 - 00:02:13.526, Speaker A: Just remember, I'm the better looking one of course. Yeah.
00:02:13.548 - 00:02:16.360, Speaker B: Well, I'm the one that actually exists in real life.
00:02:16.890 - 00:02:33.770, Speaker A: Yeah. David's the one that you're actually going to see at a conference. So it's definitely going to be David. All right. All right. We should also talk about our friends at Rhinofi. I know they wanted us to get the message out that formerly they were called diversify, and now they are rhinofi.
00:02:33.770 - 00:02:45.018, Speaker A: Formerly they were also a decentralized exchange, and now they are more than that. You can swap. You can also trade, of course, you can deposit into liquidity pools. What else can you do with rhinofi?
00:02:45.114 - 00:03:26.334, Speaker B: So rhinofi just abstracts all of the many, many chains that are existing and coming online in this multi chain future. So all the basic stuff, like Ryan said, like trading and swapping, but you can also put your assets into liquidity pools. You can also invest them in various parts inside of the multi chain future. And as we just go and grow and grow in complexity, stuff like this is going to be more and more needed in order to just manage all of your defi stuff across all of the chains. The reason why it looks like this on Ryan's windows, because every time we start recording, I have him squeeze his window. Yeah, real tight. But it would look a little bit more expanded on your desktop when you go to the link in the show notes to go check it out.
00:03:26.372 - 00:03:53.666, Speaker A: Yeah, go check it out. I think part of the reason that we got so burned last cycle, not we, I mean, crypto collectively using CFI platforms is because defi user interfaces weren't there yet. It was just easier to deposit in Celsius and blockfi. But now with Rhinofi's of the world, we are upgrading our DFI experience. And just a reminder, CFI failed this cycle, but DFI didn't. This is a way to double down on it, start leveling up using tools like rhinofi. It's 100% bankless.
00:03:53.666 - 00:04:04.870, Speaker A: So this is all on a layer, 200% organic, bankless organic experience for you here. All right, David, let's get to the markets. Bitcoin, what's it doing?
00:04:04.940 - 00:04:13.886, Speaker B: Some good things. Bitcoin started the week at $23,200, ending the week at $23,700. Up two and a half percent. Up two and a half percent. Nice.
00:04:13.908 - 00:04:14.720, Speaker A: Green week.
00:04:15.170 - 00:04:20.670, Speaker B: Green weeks. Stacking on green weeks. We got, I think, three green weeks in a row. Ryan, knock on wood. Knock on wood happen.
00:04:20.740 - 00:04:36.230, Speaker A: Yeah, that can happen during the bear. It's allowed. But the bigger story was this one. What's this chart telling us? This is a bitcoin chart again, but let me actually pull up the ethereum chart. The lines are a bit steeper upward. What are we looking at?
00:04:36.300 - 00:04:43.286, Speaker B: Started the week at 1570. We are currently clocking in at 1726.
00:04:43.388 - 00:04:43.702, Speaker A: Wow.
00:04:43.756 - 00:04:51.682, Speaker B: Up 8.7%. Was it last week that east was up 30%? I think it was again. Just stack.
00:04:51.746 - 00:04:52.822, Speaker A: Do that math in your head.
00:04:52.956 - 00:04:54.058, Speaker B: Oh, don't ask me to do that.
00:04:54.064 - 00:04:56.730, Speaker A: 8% plus the 30%. We're 38% on two weeks.
00:04:56.800 - 00:04:59.542, Speaker B: No, that's not how it works. You can't add percentages.
00:04:59.606 - 00:05:00.010, Speaker A: I know.
00:05:00.080 - 00:05:00.700, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:05:03.230 - 00:05:05.086, Speaker A: I'd have to go back to the 14 day.
00:05:05.188 - 00:05:05.838, Speaker B: Right.
00:05:06.004 - 00:05:28.966, Speaker A: The good news is we're green, we're up and we're heading in a good direction. I think there's a story here. Did you see it just, like, suddenly leap up? Yeah, I guess that was Wednesday on the day of recording. And that's something to do with the Fed, actually. Jerome Powell spoke that line, that nice green candle into existence, I think. And we're going to get to why that is in that story. But before we do, I'd love to.
00:05:28.988 - 00:05:32.450, Speaker B: Be able to speak green candles into existence. Yeah. Only Powell.
00:05:32.530 - 00:05:37.110, Speaker A: Sorry, you have to apply for the position of central banker. David, you want that job?
00:05:37.180 - 00:05:38.962, Speaker B: I'm out. No, I don't.
00:05:39.026 - 00:05:46.346, Speaker A: Sounds like a terrible job. Honestly, everyone hates you all of the time. Sorry, Powell. ETh bitcoin ratio. What's the ratio telling us?
00:05:46.448 - 00:05:54.918, Speaker B: Up 6.2% is up to zero. Two. My ETH BTC trade finally coming back to parity.
00:05:55.014 - 00:05:57.950, Speaker A: Is that a real trade you made or is that trade in your head?
00:05:58.100 - 00:05:59.982, Speaker B: No. A long time ago. I've been holding it.
00:06:00.036 - 00:06:00.590, Speaker A: Oh, really?
00:06:00.660 - 00:06:02.510, Speaker B: Yeah, I've been knuckling it. Yeah.
00:06:02.580 - 00:06:05.950, Speaker A: No, sir, I've never had the guts to make that trade. People trade in the ratio.
00:06:06.110 - 00:06:08.226, Speaker B: Short bitcoin, long ether. Yeah.
00:06:08.328 - 00:06:20.210, Speaker A: I mean, I would do that by just holding ETh over bitcoin over the long time horizon. But, like, actually trading this ratio is, like, scary to me. Spooky territory. I admire you, David.
00:06:20.290 - 00:06:25.666, Speaker B: Have I told you that? Well, thank you. You should admire me for other reasons.
00:06:25.698 - 00:06:37.242, Speaker A: Other than my trading, not your trading game. We could always look at the DPI ratio, if you're curious about ratios. But how about the crypto market cap? Are we above a trillion this week?
00:06:37.296 - 00:06:46.334, Speaker B: Yeah, we're above a trillion. We were at 1 trillion last week. We are up to 1.138 trillion. The math is easy. This week we are up 13.8%.
00:06:46.532 - 00:06:49.070, Speaker A: Nice. Gas prices still down?
00:06:49.140 - 00:07:01.886, Speaker B: Honestly, gas prices like crazy. Low ten gwe average gwe fee. You know what would be like super ironic. Ryan, what is if we merge and there's no burn, ether is not deflationary.
00:07:01.998 - 00:07:04.530, Speaker A: No ultrasound money. After all of this.
00:07:04.680 - 00:07:11.400, Speaker B: After all that. So the deflationary threshold is seven and we are at ten.
00:07:11.770 - 00:07:13.062, Speaker A: We're just hanging on.
00:07:13.116 - 00:07:14.280, Speaker B: We're hanging on.
00:07:15.450 - 00:07:31.206, Speaker A: I don't know. What's so funny is when transaction fees are high, people get bearish because they're like, ethereum is not scaling. What's the matter? Transaction fees are so high. Now, on the flip side, when transaction fees are low, they're like bearish again. No one's using Ethereum, David.
00:07:31.318 - 00:07:38.430, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like a loose, loose scenario. Yeah, bearish when fees are high. Bearish when fees are low. I mean, okay, then that just means you're just a bearish person.
00:07:38.500 - 00:07:50.526, Speaker A: Yeah, probably. I'm optimistic in both of these cases. So it's a good time to get your transaction fees through. But I do hope, I mean, just for the posterity of it, like post merge, we got to be ultrasound, right? We got to be burning more eth.
00:07:50.558 - 00:07:56.722, Speaker B: We got to be. I will just personally spam the network with. Please do.
00:07:56.776 - 00:08:00.920, Speaker A: Just for like five minutes, just for the meme. Yeah. Okay.
00:08:02.010 - 00:08:10.220, Speaker B: By the way, five minutes of spanning ethereum. I'm pretty sure that is at least like half a million dollars. So I will not actually be doing that.
00:08:10.750 - 00:08:19.126, Speaker A: Create a dow for it. Ultrasound, dow. I don't know. Get Lubin to help. Okay. Markets. The Fed press release.
00:08:19.126 - 00:09:06.330, Speaker A: So the big Powell raise came out, I guess. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve issued a statement that said they were going to increase the federal funds rate. That's the interest rate, of course, to two and a quarter, to two and a half percent. That is a zero point 75 increase, bringing the target rate number to 2.5%. So they call that zero point 75 is 75 bips. This is, of course, the biggest rate hike, I believe, let me see, since Volcker. The fastest tightening of monetary policy since Fed chair Paul Volcker battled double digit inflation in the 1990s is the headline here.
00:09:06.330 - 00:09:40.950, Speaker A: Weak economic data was the reason, although Powell did say here. Here's a quote from him. I do not think the US is currently in recession. He told reporters that after the end of the latest policy meeting, and he cited unemployment rate that is still near a half century low and solid wage growth and job gains. It doesn't make sense that the US would be in a recession. What's interesting about that statement, though is I remember last summer he was telling us about transitory inflation. And this summer, I don't think the US is not in a recession, and that wouldn't make sense at all.
00:09:40.950 - 00:09:45.800, Speaker A: So I'm not actually sure whether he believes that or not or is kind of playing the act.
00:09:46.730 - 00:10:14.382, Speaker B: Yeah, I've been thinking about this this last week, actually, after listening to Lynn Alden and Luke Grominar podcast, but also content that Kyla Scanlon has been putting out. I actually think that every single word that comes out of the Fed Reserve is an act. There is nothing that is actually him. There's nothing that is not specified. Everything is done as like a theater.
00:10:14.446 - 00:10:16.980, Speaker A: There is another lever to tinker with.
00:10:18.390 - 00:10:47.420, Speaker B: We talk about what are the levers of the Fed? They have interest rates and they have quantitative easing and tightening. They also have how they appear as a big tool, a narrative. And so that is actually probably the biggest tool. And so I think when you read these statements by the Fed and you see the words that the Fed chair does not think that the US is currently in a recession, that is not what the Fed chair actually thinks. That is what he wants you to think that he thinks that.
00:10:48.350 - 00:10:49.994, Speaker A: That doesn't work forever. Right?
00:10:50.112 - 00:10:56.958, Speaker B: Because if markets are just a hall of mirrors, sure. It's like, well, they think this, so I think this, so they think that, so I think this.
00:10:57.044 - 00:11:09.534, Speaker A: Right? But it's kind of the keynesian beauty. Once we start to know that the Fed chair is actually not telling us the truth, but is telling us what he wants us to believe, then it's like conception.
00:11:09.662 - 00:11:15.022, Speaker B: You have to go one layer deeper at that point, and then so does the Fed. And then we go one layer.
00:11:15.086 - 00:11:21.426, Speaker A: Oh my God. Wow. If we could just outsource this to robots and code, that would be so much simpler.
00:11:21.538 - 00:11:23.462, Speaker B: Zero layers deep. Wow. Wouldn't that be nice?
00:11:23.516 - 00:11:47.422, Speaker A: The question is, though, is this a peak in the inflation rate? I think that's a question. We had 9.1%, remember, last time? But what was interesting about this, I think, David, is what we'll get to next. The market actually liked this. So think about this. We go zero point 75, 75 bips up, pretty big raise, pretty big move to tightening. But the market had kind of expected this to happen.
00:11:47.422 - 00:12:01.780, Speaker A: And then what do you think the market does? Does it go down or does it go up? Well, up is the answer to that. Nasdaq shot up, crypto shot up. And we're going to get into a thread as to the reason for that. But let me ask you, David, were you surprised at that?
00:12:03.510 - 00:12:13.238, Speaker B: Nothing surprises me anymore. So tightening and we go, but don't have an opinion as to the direction of the market. I've been in buy only mode for the past like three months.
00:12:13.324 - 00:12:28.358, Speaker A: Do you know, it seems counterintuitive, though, right? You actually raised rates and then Nasdaq and crypto would pop up. And that's why we're seeing the EtH pop of 9% this week. And also bitcoin up this week. It was actually after the Fed meeting.
00:12:28.454 - 00:12:29.050, Speaker B: Right.
00:12:29.200 - 00:12:38.590, Speaker A: Why don't we get into this thread? What is macro elf saying? This is a voice I've increasingly enjoyed on macro topics. But why don't you read this out? It's a whole thread about this.
00:12:38.660 - 00:13:12.134, Speaker B: Yeah. So macro elf, Alf says Powell hikes 75 basis points, and yet Nasdaq and bitcoin are going to the moon. What the heck? While I disagree with the unfolding market narrative here, let me try to explain why we are witnessing such a rally. Despite openly recognizing economic growth is softening, the Fed, unanimously, exclamation point, decided to hike Bips by 75%. It's all about inflation, inflation, inflation. But markets convincingly started to rally only when Powell went ahead and said the following quote. We are now at levels broadly in line with our estimates of neutral interest rates.
00:13:12.134 - 00:13:43.262, Speaker B: And after front loading our hiking cycle until now, we will be much more data dependent going forward. Let's find out why this is so relevant. So Macroalf continues and says the neutral rate is the prevailing rate at which the economy runs at its potential without overheating or excessively cooling down. I think that is called threading the needle. I think that's called a soft landing. With this 75 bips hike, the Fed just reached its estimate of a neutral rate. From here, they aren't contributing to economic heating anymore.
00:13:43.262 - 00:14:13.600, Speaker B: And then here we see a graph. And then he continues, but that also means any hikes from here are going to put the Fed in an actively restrictive territory. So I think he's saying that we have established an equilibrium with the economy. The economy is not going to go up, it's not going to go down, it's going to be flat. And so he continues and says, but that means that any hikes from here are going to put the Fed in an actively restrictive territory. The bond market knows that every time the Fed becomes restrictive, they break something. So Powell was asked a couple of very important questions.
00:14:13.600 - 00:14:35.406, Speaker B: I'm guessing in after the statement, they had like a press seminar thing where the reporters could talk to them. What about bond market pricing? 70 bips cuts in 2023? What about financial conditions? So what about forward guidance? And so this is when they quote, from here on out, we are fully data dependent.
00:14:35.438 - 00:14:49.718, Speaker A: From. That's the quote at which the rally started happening in the markets. Before that it was kind of nothing. The zero point 75 did nothing to the markets. But this statement, from here onwards we are fully data dependent. That was the differentiator.
00:14:49.814 - 00:15:25.394, Speaker B: Right. And so the question of what about forward guidance is answered by from here on, for here onwards we are fully data dependent, meaning forward guidance is gone. And so again, the thread continues. Why is this relevant? It all starts from a very strong opinion that the bond market has developed. The strong opinion that the bond market has developed about inflation over the last few months, it's going to move down and very fast inflation. The bond market thinks the inflation is going to go down fast, bigly. Between July 23 and 24, the CPI is priced to print at about 2.9%.
00:15:25.394 - 00:15:56.714, Speaker B: So we're at. Where were we at 9.1% last month, allegedly the bond market. And between July 23 and July 24, the CPI is priced in from the bond market to be at 2.9%, basically at target. So the bond market is pricing in that the Federal Reserve is going to get inflation under control in about one year's time. So if Powell is not nearly on autopilot anymore and the markets have a strong opinion on inflation and growth collapsing, they can also price all other assets based on this scenario.
00:15:56.714 - 00:16:30.390, Speaker B: So basically saying, if the bond market is pricing this in, so is everything else. If you look under the hood, market action also validates this narrative. Hence why QQQ, the Nasdaq is going up, bitcoin is going up, crypto is going up. And so what's outperforming here? Nasdaq and crypto, of course, as I just said, if the Fed isn't going to tighten financial conditions on autopilot anymore, real yields will actually start declining again. And here we actually do see yields start to decline and they continue again. We're almost done. When real yields decline, value intensive and risk sentiment driven assets classes outperform.
00:16:30.390 - 00:17:12.134, Speaker B: That's because the marginal return for owning cash USD becomes less attractive and the incentive to chase risk assets is larger, such as QQQ, the Nasdaq and bitcoin. Do I think this rally has legs? Question mark? I can rationalize the narrative being built post FOMC, but no forward guidance equals a very, very volatile Fed ahead of us. One small hawkish turn and it's all gone. You must price in some additional risk premium here, not less. Basically, what he is saying is that the bond market has priced in. We're solving inflation in one year's time. And because the Federal Reserve is not operating under a forward guidance scenario anymore, they are saying we are completely data driven at this point.
00:17:12.134 - 00:17:28.214, Speaker B: If the data comes out and shows that we are not solving inflation within one year time, the market is not positioned for that and will likely react to that in a volatile manner, like hinting to the downside. And so that's like the main conclusion to this thread.
00:17:28.262 - 00:17:58.274, Speaker A: Yeah. So the TLDR is that data driven statement has the market thinking that the Fed is done increasing for now, like nothing more than sort of expected. It won't get super ultra aggressive. Right? That's what the market thinks. But the reason this rally might be tenuous is because if the market is wrong about that and inflation is much more persistent, it may drive the Fed's hand to change. Because now the Fed is data driven. Apparently.
00:17:58.274 - 00:18:21.806, Speaker A: So can you trust this rally is a question of, I don't know, what is inflation going to be in the future? That's sort of how tenuous this is right now. I don't know. I mean, it's cool to see a rally like this, I suppose, but we're probably not out of the woods yet, and I guess we're all pretty data dependent from here on out.
00:18:21.988 - 00:18:30.318, Speaker B: Absolutely. Yeah. The data is going to be the thing. Leading the market is an interesting place to be.
00:18:30.484 - 00:18:39.566, Speaker A: NfTs, you know, last week, we're just a nice soft transition to something that matters a lot less than the global.
00:18:39.598 - 00:18:43.358, Speaker B: Soft landing policy, I guess the NFT price floor.
00:18:43.454 - 00:19:04.170, Speaker A: Actually, I was looking for a dashboard of kind of the biggest by market cap NFT projects, and I found this, nftpricefloor.com. Someone sent it to us. We can include this from time to time. But quick recap, David, what are we looking at? Just like maybe the top five. How big are the top five NFT projects by floor cap?
00:19:04.320 - 00:19:41.654, Speaker B: Yeah, so I really like this measurement floor cap, which is the price floor multiplied by the number of assets, which is basically what a market cap is judged by the floor. So coming in at number one, of course, board ape yacht club floor cap of 857,000 ether, followed by crypto punks at 714,000 ether. That gap is way closer than I thought it was. Once upon a time, like board apes were like almost three times. Cryptopunks. Now they're almost at parity, followed by mutant apes. Other deed for other sides, moonbirds, clone x, I don't know what that is.
00:19:41.772 - 00:19:48.114, Speaker A: And then autoglyphs, do you know, 857. So board apes equates to about 1.5 billion.
00:19:48.162 - 00:19:49.094, Speaker B: I don't want to know.
00:19:49.212 - 00:19:53.466, Speaker A: 1.5 billion. That's the value of 10,000 board ape NFts right now.
00:19:53.488 - 00:20:01.562, Speaker B: But there's not that much liquidity there. There's 477 ether that was traded in the last 24 hours. Decent volume, I guess.
00:20:01.616 - 00:20:19.554, Speaker A: I wonder if nfts continue to become more financialized if we'll see this kind of free up a little bit. Do you know what I mean? To your point, they're super illiquid right now. But what happens if you can kind of lend against them, borrow against them? I don't know. Does that change the liquidity of them?
00:20:19.672 - 00:20:20.978, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it should.
00:20:21.144 - 00:20:26.786, Speaker A: That's interesting. Anyway, we'll look at this from time to time to see the health of the NFT market. Let's move to.
00:20:26.888 - 00:20:50.890, Speaker B: I expect there to be different things there in the future. I would not expect like this. Do you ever remember what was it? Coin market cap before there was coin gecko. And looking at the total market cap in 2017, it's completely foreign to what it is now because things rotate out of the top ten. I expect there to be big rotation out of the top ten.
00:20:50.960 - 00:20:56.000, Speaker A: That's a good take. So you don't think crypto punks stays in the top five?
00:20:57.010 - 00:20:58.590, Speaker B: Crypto punks in the top five.
00:20:58.660 - 00:21:00.510, Speaker A: David's a crypto maximalist.
00:21:01.010 - 00:21:03.082, Speaker B: Anyways, I got this NFT project to shell.
00:21:03.146 - 00:21:08.686, Speaker A: Yeah, crypto punk maximalist. Okay, merge, David, you want to talk about the merge?
00:21:08.798 - 00:21:12.622, Speaker B: I do want to talk about the merge, Ryan. How did you know I wanted to talk about the merge?
00:21:12.686 - 00:21:45.230, Speaker A: So exciting. Okay, it's happening and I guess quick tease in the market section today. This is from DFI surfer. More than 7 billion of annual sell pressure, $20 million of daily sell pressure will be eliminated the day the merge is complete. Hal press reminds us of that. This is not how press, but something that he would say going to be fireworks for the month following the merge if you saw this chart, David. But again, once again we're talking about post merge ETH issuance is going to be reduced like 4.1%
00:21:45.230 - 00:22:04.466, Speaker A: to 0%, hopefully negative in the negative territory, right? Knock on the line. I hope so. And that's an 87% reduction. Incredible issuance reduction of 87%. The triple havening. It's like three havenings in a row if you're used to kind of bitcoiner terminology. And that is happening.
00:22:04.466 - 00:22:22.460, Speaker A: So if the testnet is happening in early August, we'll get to what that means. For potential main net deployment. But we know what this means for issuance is a massive amount of sell pressure will be removed from the market at day one.
00:22:22.830 - 00:22:40.510, Speaker B: So, Ryan, I just want to help put into context how big $7 billion is off the top of your head. Do you know how much capital, how much dollars microstrategy has purchased of bitcoin? Not how much bitcoin that they have in dollar terms? How many dollars they've used to purchase bitcoin?
00:22:41.090 - 00:22:43.738, Speaker A: I'm going to throw a number at you. Okay, you ready to catch?
00:22:43.834 - 00:22:45.006, Speaker B: Okay, hit me.
00:22:45.188 - 00:22:46.190, Speaker A: 2 billion.
00:22:47.250 - 00:22:48.042, Speaker B: 4 billion.
00:22:48.106 - 00:22:48.730, Speaker A: Okay.
00:22:48.900 - 00:23:11.486, Speaker B: They have spent $4 billion on bitcoin. And with this, with the post merge, ethereum basically gets, we have this current equilibrium of where we are now. And post merge, we have a new equilibrium which is equivalent to a $7 billion buyer coming in yearly every single year dollar cost until history ends.
00:23:11.538 - 00:23:13.322, Speaker A: More reliable Michael Saylor even.
00:23:13.376 - 00:23:29.402, Speaker B: Yes, much more reliable Michael Saylor is out of cash. I don't know if you've noticed, but his cash, the amount of that he's bought is like now, whenever he like, oh, Michael Sailor bought bitcoin. It's like he's adding 0.1% to his stack. $7 billion yearly. Yearly.
00:23:29.466 - 00:23:44.878, Speaker A: Yeah. What's cool about this, too, is like, if you're an ETH holder, every time the Ethereum block space sells some blocks to somebody, which is what this is. It's ethereum selling blocks, you get money. How great is that?
00:23:44.984 - 00:23:45.960, Speaker B: It's so awesome.
00:23:47.530 - 00:24:09.958, Speaker A: Anyway, we're excited about the merge. Let's talk about this going into the merge. All right, this is from Felix Hartman. And this is total market capitalizations, the good old bitcoin dominance chart. This is what Felix says. We're well into the bear market, yet unlike the previous one, bitcoin dominance is still bleeding lower. While ETH dominance is on a steady rise.
00:24:09.958 - 00:24:26.702, Speaker A: ETH is now a mere 120% outperformance away from flipping bitcoin. ETH did around 120 performance outperformance from January 2020 to September 2020. So nothing crazy. David, before is the flipping back on the menu, sir?
00:24:26.836 - 00:24:48.962, Speaker B: Okay, so flipping has always been on the menu, but also people are like, oh, one day ether might flip bitcoin. All the ETH people say that, me including. But, like, people forget that the flipping is just the first flipping. Then there's the second flipping, and then there's the third flipping. You just start lapping bitcoin over and over and over again. You're allowed.
00:24:49.026 - 00:24:50.230, Speaker A: You mean like doubling?
00:24:50.390 - 00:24:54.410, Speaker B: Yeah, you double bitcoin then you triple bitcoin, and then you quadruple bitcoin. Yeah.
00:24:54.480 - 00:24:58.380, Speaker A: Come on, man. Don't grave dance on bitcoin, okay?
00:24:58.750 - 00:25:04.030, Speaker B: It can be number two and be fine, but fundamentals are fundamentals.
00:25:04.450 - 00:25:22.354, Speaker A: What do you think about this take? Because I've seen this increasingly, and it happens whenever ETH is coming closer to flipping bitcoin, especially in the bitcoin maximalist community. It's like if you flip in bitcoin, you destroy the entire non sovereign store of value meme. Like, you kill it all.
00:25:22.472 - 00:26:01.854, Speaker B: It's one of the many, many ass backwards takes out of the bitcoin maxicamp. What they mean to say is, if you flip bitcoin, well, then you remove the king, and then you just make it so somebody can flip you. No, the correct take is if bitcoin gets flipped by the second chain, then it'll probably get flipped by the third chain, and it'll probably get flipped by the fourth chain too. It's a problem for bitcoin. If something flips bitcoin, it's because they effing deserved it because their fundamentals are strong, not because some magical, ooh, we popped the immaculate nature of bitcoin. And it's like manifest destiny to be the biggest crypto ever. It's that fundamentals matter and bitcoin hasn't been paying attention to.
00:26:01.892 - 00:26:16.654, Speaker A: Would you say the same thing, David, if ether got flipping? And I will remind you, XRP. Yes, flipped it at one point in time, something else did too. I missed recalling this XRP at least, maybe XRP twice.
00:26:16.782 - 00:26:17.730, Speaker B: It was bitcoin cash.
00:26:17.800 - 00:26:18.834, Speaker A: Bitcoin cash as well.
00:26:18.872 - 00:26:19.182, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:26:19.256 - 00:26:25.622, Speaker A: So did XRP and bitcoin cash deserve it? Or are you talking about a flipping that is more sustained in terms of.
00:26:25.756 - 00:26:45.200, Speaker B: Yeah, more sustained and not when markets are just super illiquid and young. And also that happened during the irrationality of the bear market simultaneously. When XRP flipped ether, ether was also $80, which I would also say was extremely irrational. That was just an irrational time in the market.
00:26:45.890 - 00:27:03.342, Speaker A: I also find it ironic that kind of, if you're a bitcoin maximalist, your whole purpose in life is to actually flip in gold. Isn't that the whole thing? And, well, if gold can be flippant, I don't know. That is the king by bitcoin. I don't know. It's just like, of course, better source.
00:27:03.486 - 00:27:06.654, Speaker B: If bitcoin flips gold, the world just destroys Ryan.
00:27:06.702 - 00:27:08.566, Speaker A: That's what a gold maximalist might say.
00:27:08.668 - 00:27:13.000, Speaker B: Peter Schiff, get you on the no no.
00:27:13.370 - 00:27:14.870, Speaker A: Have you ever heard him speak?
00:27:15.020 - 00:27:16.258, Speaker B: Oh, God, yeah, it's awful.
00:27:16.354 - 00:27:18.294, Speaker A: I haven't in a long time. It's been a while, actually.
00:27:18.332 - 00:27:23.050, Speaker B: He's one of those people where, like, his macro takes are super awesome, his asset takes are terrible.
00:27:23.390 - 00:27:31.020, Speaker A: Yeah, I know those people. I know those people. All the bitcoiners, those people don't have enough eth. Let's talk about this for a second.
00:27:31.390 - 00:27:33.280, Speaker B: The maxi hats are on today.
00:27:33.730 - 00:27:45.166, Speaker A: Sorry, toning down. I'm just excited about the merge. David. He who controls the infrastructure, controls the universe. This is Greg tweeting this out. And this is kind of an.org chart of SBF.
00:27:45.166 - 00:28:10.602, Speaker A: Sam bank bedfried, beloved crypto banker. And he has been on a buying spree this cycle. Right. Assets that have depreciated massively. Other crypto banks helped bail out blockfi. And I think the take here is, that's great. Sam managed his money very well and is very well positioned for this.
00:28:10.602 - 00:28:55.250, Speaker A: It's also a little bit alarming to me to see even more consolidation in the CFI space. Like, all of the companies that managed to stay healthy and retain a balance sheet are now buying all of the companies that didn't. And so what we get, the result of all of these kind of acquisitions, is further and further consolidation and centralization. CZ is also doing the same thing. And I'm just like, okay, these are smart business people. I get it. But it's another reason why DeFi looks very hopeful and very bright is because we've always been concerned at bankless that if we just replace one set of bankers with another set of central bankers, we haven't really achieved anything in this whole crypto.
00:28:55.250 - 00:29:11.190, Speaker A: And, like, I'm not faulting SBF or CZ for being responsible and good business people in doing this, but I'm just saying the system is kind of broken if it's all consolidated with a new set of bankers. We got a new JP Morgan on the scene, and he's SBF.
00:29:11.270 - 00:29:24.318, Speaker B: All right, coming up next. Like I said, three eras. Capital is on the table. They speak Suzu and Kyle Davies. They did an interview with Bloomberg. They actually said words. So we're going to read out some of their quotes to hear what they have to say.
00:29:24.318 - 00:30:03.498, Speaker B: I'm going to go ahead and put on my fed cap for that one, saying, like, all the words that coming out of Kyle Davies and Su are not their true selves, but instead an act. Because that's probably what they have to do in the moment anyways. After that Coinbase Insider trading opens the window for the SEC to target the entire industry. So there's two parts of the story, insider trading at Coinbase. That's bad, but just like kind of an open shut case, what the SEC is doing as a result of that is terrible and needs to stop. And now it's triggered the attention of the CFTC. So we're going to get into all those details and more and the rest of the show right after we get through some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible.
00:30:03.498 - 00:30:44.254, Speaker B: Arbitrum is an ethereum layer two scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use DFI and nfTs.

00:31:49.476 - 00:32:13.542, Speaker A: Hey, guys, we are back talking first about three arrows capital. I wouldn't mind, David, if this is the last time for a while we talk about three arrows capital. I feel like this kind of gives us maybe a little bit of closure on this story. But the story is Kyle Davies and Suzu are the founders of three rows capital and definitely in the spotlight. They spoke this week. It's their first interview wasn't on bankless. It was on Bloomberg in written form.
00:32:13.542 - 00:32:25.162, Speaker A: And we have some of their quotes here. David, what are some of the choice quotes from this article in Bloomberg three years capital founders break their silence over the collapse of the crypto hedge fund. What did they say?
00:32:25.296 - 00:32:33.660, Speaker B: Yeah, first one comes in from Suzu, and he says, people may call us stupid, they may call us stupid or delusional, and I'll accept that. Maybe.
00:32:34.190 - 00:32:35.242, Speaker A: He said maybe.
00:32:35.376 - 00:32:59.198, Speaker B: But they're going know say that I absconded funds during the last period where I actually put more of my personal money back in. So that's not true. Like, the absconding is not true. Again, my take. I was going to say this to the end, but I'll say it here. This kind of feels like a whole PR stunt. Like, why would 3 hours capital take an interview with Bloomberg? It's because they need to fight their image right now because it's probably relevant in court.
00:32:59.198 - 00:33:27.646, Speaker B: That's my take. I'm going to go ahead and poison the well here with that. Quote number two, from the article. Advisors in charge of liquidating the fund said in the July eigth filings that sue and Davies hadn't cooperated with them and that the founder's whereabouts were unknown. Sue said death threats had forced them into hiding. Quote, this does not mean that we haven't been communicating with all relevant authorities, said sue in a telephone interview with Davies and two lawyers from Saltera LLP. We have been communicating with them from day one.
00:33:27.646 - 00:33:42.658, Speaker B: Again, PR management. Again, is my take. Is my take. Quote number three, this whole situation is very regrettable. Kyle Sabie says many people lost a lot of money. Yeah, it is very regrettable. That's certainly true.
00:33:42.658 - 00:34:15.658, Speaker B: Quote number four, efforts by sue and Davies to deflect blame are a sharp contrast to the pair's previously relentless campaign of cheerleading crypto assets and belittling critics. Nerves were raked and new this week by creditor claims that the founders put a down payment on a $50 million yacht before the fund went untter, a claim Sue Zoo said was a part of a smear campaign. The boat was, quote, bought over a year ago and commissioned to be built and used in Europe. Sue said he rejected the perception that he enjoyed an extravagant lifestyle, noting that he biked to work and back every day and that his family only had two homes in Singapore.
00:34:15.754 - 00:34:20.430, Speaker A: That's it. Living on the pottery line here had two homes.
00:34:21.170 - 00:34:55.514, Speaker B: Quote, we have never been seen in any club spending lots of money. We have never been know kind of driving ferraris and lamborghinis around, sue said. This is kind of smearing us. I feel it's just a classic playbook. Know when this stuff happens, when fun blows up, then, you know, these are kind of the headlines that people like to play. Quote number five, what we failed to realize was that Luna was capable of falling to effectively zero in a matter of days, and that this would catalyze a credit squeeze across the industry that would put significant pressure on all of our illiquid positions. Sue said.
00:34:55.514 - 00:35:30.070, Speaker B: Jeez, after that day when bitcoin went from 30,000 to 20,000, that was extremely painful for us, says Kyle. And in that, that ended up being the kind of the nail in the coffin. Last quote for Kyle and I, there's so many crazy people in crypto that kind of made death threats or all of this kind of noise, said sue. We feel that it's just in the interest for everyone. If we can be physically secured and keep a low profile, I think that is, maybe it is in the interest of everyone, maybe not. It's definitely in the interest of Kyle, Davies and Suzu to be physically secured and keep a low profile, that's for sure.
00:35:30.220 - 00:35:33.560, Speaker A: Yeah. And of course, death threats are not cool.
00:35:34.010 - 00:35:37.074, Speaker B: That's probably true. They are probably actually getting death threats.
00:35:37.122 - 00:35:41.814, Speaker A: Yeah, I believe. I mean, that is a legitimate reason for hiding.
00:35:41.862 - 00:35:46.054, Speaker B: But death threats and not cooperating with the council.
00:35:46.102 - 00:35:47.370, Speaker A: Did you hear an apology?
00:35:48.190 - 00:35:51.950, Speaker B: No, I heard that it was very regrettable.
00:35:53.890 - 00:36:13.874, Speaker A: Maybe we made some mistakes along the way. I read this article because it was fascinating because as I said before, I feel like I wanted some closure from this. Sure. Because hearing this now, if you're just new to crypto, I can't describe to you how revered these guys were. 3 hours capital were during the bit.
00:36:13.912 - 00:36:16.894, Speaker B: They were like the bull trader gods trader gods.
00:36:16.942 - 00:36:47.514, Speaker A: Greatest traders to ever live. This is just what it felt like crypto, Twitter, and the broader community kind of bought up like you want to see the best traders in the world. It's Suzu Kyle Davis, three years capital. And so I wanted to understand how mechanically they went bust right from their perspective. And this is what I gleaned from the story between the quotes about yachts and such. So how did three years capital go bust? Number one, they failed to manage risk.
00:36:47.642 - 00:36:48.954, Speaker B: Kind of a requirement to go bust.
00:36:49.002 - 00:37:05.534, Speaker A: Quote, quote from the article. We believed in everything to the fullest. Not the kind of thing you want to say if you're managing risk. And by the way, these are not just lessons for three years capital. These are lessons that are applicable to us. How do we not fall in the 3 hours capital track? So they went all in on these speculative projects. They used margin.
00:37:05.534 - 00:37:27.606, Speaker A: They didn't hedge. It's kind of like gambling if you're approaching crypto like that. It's not the way to do it. Number two, they got wrecked by Luna. We failed to realize that Luna was capable of falling to effectively zero in a matter of days. What happened, I think, David, is something that can happen to you everyday investors, people on the bankless journey, is you get fomo. You get, in this case, alt one fomo.
00:37:27.606 - 00:37:54.082, Speaker A: And what happened was through as capital missed a number of big alt one run ups. Right? They missed that whole Solana thing that multicoin and friends got in on. And so they started to believe their own narratives. They wanted to play catch up, and they added risk in an effort to catch up. They didn't have to do this, but they wanted to get more out of the alt one narrative. And so they went in on Luna, and they went in big, also. Big avalanche, I think.
00:37:54.082 - 00:38:17.242, Speaker A: Yeah. Number three, they got wrecked by staked ETh. De pegging from ETH. The quote from the article is there are people who also leverage long staked ETH versus ether who will get liquidated as the market goes down. The answer to that question is yes. So they didn't appropriately manage the risks when they were entering into kind of these markets that were somewhat obvious. Right.
00:38:17.242 - 00:39:01.462, Speaker A: Of course, you can't make the assumption that Dai is always going to stay pegged to a dollar. You can't always make the assumption that staked ETH is always going to maintain its peg with ETH. And if you are margining and risking some of your assets based on that assumption, that is a bad move. Number four, they got wrecked by GBDC, as many people did, because everyone did it. Then the trust went to the discount, and then went to a far bigger discount than anyone thought possible. So during these kind of market events, things can happen that you don't expect, like GBTC de pegging in such a big way, and they didn't consider that. And then, of course, they didn't do the classic thing of they weren't ready for bitcoin to go to 20k.
00:39:01.462 - 00:39:23.582, Speaker A: This is Suzu again. Bitcoin went from thirty k to twenty k. That was extremely painful for us. That ended up being the nail in the coffin crypto investor, are you ready for a 90% drop in your assets? Okay. In the last bear cycle, Eth went down by 95%. I knew many a good crypto investor who got their positions liquidated. Hello.
00:39:23.582 - 00:39:32.706, Speaker A: In something like makerdao. All right. These people are great investors. Full confession. I was one of them, too.
00:39:32.888 - 00:39:35.838, Speaker B: There we go. Where's that poap? I think we both would have that poap.
00:39:35.934 - 00:40:03.014, Speaker A: Well, so I didn't get liquidated, but it came closer than I ever want to feel again. All right, so you got to be ready for these drops. Summary of the lessons for us from the 3 hours capital bust. Number one, how do you avoid this in the future? They went bust because they took too much leverage. They believed their own hype. They bought the top on speculative assets. They weren't ready for a 90% drawdown, and they invested more than they could afford to lose.
00:40:03.014 - 00:40:23.938, Speaker A: At the end of the day, this is basic stuff. It's almost noob level stuff, right? It's the stuff that we all need to embed deep in our psyche if we want to survive on this journey. And I think the final lesson from all of this is the pros aren't always what they seem. Okay. The traitor gods didn't end up being gods after all. You got to do your own research. Don't listen to what David and I say.
00:40:23.938 - 00:40:28.420, Speaker A: Don't listen to what Suzu says. Do your own research on this stuff.
00:40:29.850 - 00:40:38.746, Speaker B: There's that quote that everyone's an expert in the bull market. It's more about being an expert in the bear market. That's where true colors show up.
00:40:38.928 - 00:40:44.166, Speaker A: What is the fallout reaction from this interview? It wasn't very favorable.
00:40:44.278 - 00:41:19.666, Speaker B: No. There's a number of the block put out an article that had some reaction takes to the Bloomberg article. And so a quote from the bloc article says one disgruntled party told the block that they were absolutely disgusted after reading the interview and said, stop hiding and deflecting blame and own up to your own mistakes. Cooperate fully with the relevant parties, and do not ghost those involved with this. And a second quote from Arthur Hayes. And this one's awesome. Arthur Hayes, no stranger to controversy, he's the guy that got charged by the CFTC for operating Bitmex, was scornful in a thread on Twitter, taking issues with Sue's claim that he wasn't flashy.
00:41:19.666 - 00:41:32.378, Speaker B: Come on, y'all. Sue ain't flashy. He rides a bike to work and then to the marina where his super yacht is moored. Only two homes, bruh. You straight? Summoning it in the kampong, aka Tanglin. I don't know what these references are.
00:41:32.544 - 00:41:33.770, Speaker A: Rich people references.
00:41:34.910 - 00:41:40.730, Speaker B: Rich neighborhoods in Singapore, maybe he wrote referring to different Singapore neighborhoods. Yeah, there it is.
00:41:40.800 - 00:41:54.366, Speaker A: That's the story. Case closed. That's what we can learn. I hope we can move on from this. And I know we will. David, let's talk about this next item, which is big Coinbase insider trading. And I think there's two pieces to this story.
00:41:54.366 - 00:41:56.110, Speaker A: Why don't you tee us up with both those?
00:41:56.260 - 00:41:56.622, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:41:56.676 - 00:41:56.858, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:56.884 - 00:42:21.458, Speaker B: So the first one is just the headline, right? Coinbase product manager arrested on insider trading charges. Kind of more or less the full story. You kind of get it. There's not really too much crazy there. Two individual brothers profited by $1.5 million in illegal trades on 25 different crypto assets and at least 14 different separate Coinbase public listings. And so the idea here is that Coinbase lists these tokens.
00:42:21.458 - 00:42:33.514, Speaker B: These people that know about it ahead of time buy the tokens and then they sell the tokens after the listing. After the token pump. Coinbase has been listing a lot of just ridiculous tokens lately, ones that I don't even think are on uniswap, of all places.
00:42:33.562 - 00:42:34.110, Speaker A: Wait, really?
00:42:34.180 - 00:42:49.646, Speaker B: Yeah. I don't know if that's true, but it's like the names of the tokens are like, what was that? Right. Let's go, Brandon. Coin. Yeah, stuff like this. It's some bad tokens. It's already questionable, so they're kind of digging themselves a hole.
00:42:49.646 - 00:43:08.858, Speaker B: But anyways, these two brothers charged with doing illegal trading. But that's like the much smaller side of this story. The much bigger side of the story is that the SEC is charging these two brothers for trading illegal securities. And that's where so much collateral damage comes into this whole entire.
00:43:08.944 - 00:43:17.926, Speaker A: Wait, there's two charges here. One is like wire fraud, which is the base charge, but they're also charging them for legal securities.
00:43:18.038 - 00:43:54.440, Speaker B: Yes. So the SEC is claiming that the assets being traded are securities, and so they're taking these two brothers, I think, and there's also a third person, a friend. And they're taking these people to court for wire fraud and for trading illegal securities. So what this does, Ryan, is it implicates Coinbase as an illegal securities exchange. It implicates every other exchange that also trades these assets as an illegal securities exchange. It implicates the issuers of these tokens as issuers of unregistered illegal securities. And the worst part about this, Ryan, is you know who the defendants in this case are.
00:43:54.440 - 00:43:57.206, Speaker B: These two brothers and this other guy.
00:43:57.308 - 00:44:04.874, Speaker A: Oh, so they're picking on them. I understand. They were at fault. There's a real wire fraud charge here.
00:44:04.912 - 00:44:06.106, Speaker B: No one is contesting that.
00:44:06.208 - 00:44:10.730, Speaker A: But the SEC is trying to make a broader point, I suppose, in court, right?
00:44:10.800 - 00:44:27.634, Speaker B: Yes. And so say these people plead guilty. I think this is the way this works. These brothers plead guilty because they don't have the resources to fight the SEC. And whether or not they trade securities is not their fight. They're fighting whether they should go to jail or not over wire fraud. They don't care if they were securities or not.
00:44:27.634 - 00:44:43.942, Speaker B: Who does care is Coinbase and the token issuers who aren't defendants. And so since they're not defendants, they can't stick up from themselves because they're not involved in the case. It's ridiculous. It's actually the most spineless move I can think like.
00:44:43.996 - 00:45:05.166, Speaker A: Okay, so, yes, wire fraud, front running bad. The thing they did charge, inexcusable. Charge them. We have a legal system for a reason. Let's use it to its full extent. It's the securities thing that the SEC is sneaking in that implies a much more insidious agenda. Okay, let's see what Jake Trevinsky says.
00:45:05.188 - 00:45:07.326, Speaker B: I'll read more.
00:45:07.508 - 00:45:49.334, Speaker A: The SEC alleges in today's complaint that nine digital assets are securities, but don't explain their analysis for even one. They also didn't sue the issuers or exchange where the tokens traded the people with resource to fight back. They just went after one man and his family. Hard to overstate what a mess this will be. The SEC's jurisdiction turns on whether these assets are, in fact, securities. This means the case may require nine mini trials, one for each asset to resolve their security status without the issuers or exchange to defend any. Wow, this is like a winning on a technicality.
00:45:49.334 - 00:45:57.418, Speaker A: Is this what the SEC is trying to do here in order to push its, I guess, regulatory apparatus into controlling more of crypto?
00:45:57.514 - 00:46:17.298, Speaker B: Yeah, it's super nefarious. Jake had another great thread which we'll read here. The SEC filed a complaint yesterday accusing ten companies of violating the securities laws. Nine digital asset issuers in one exchange. None of them are the defendants in the case. None of them will get their day in court. And if this isn't regulation by enforcement, then nothing is.
00:46:17.298 - 00:46:35.306, Speaker B: Here's a threat. Defendants are three individuals, Coinbase, employee, brother, friend, et cetera. We've already talked about this. In addition to the SEC suit, the DOJ indicted them for criminal wire fraud, blah, blah, blah. To be clear, I'm not trying to excuse insider trading. Of course, neither are we. That's what we're saying.
00:46:35.306 - 00:47:15.078, Speaker B: The SEC alleges that the defendants committed securities fraud by using material, non public information to trade ahead of Coinbase, listing announcements to establish jurisdiction. The SEC claims that the assets in question, the nine digital assets, are unregistered securities. As far as I know, the SEC has never addressed these assets before. We've learned the SEC's views on the facts patterns that it believes qualify them as securities for the first time in a federal complaint, rather than in guidance or rulemaking. This is regulation by enforcement. It's not uncommon to learn for the first time when an enforcement agency has identified a violation when a complaint is filed. But typically that happens when the agency files an action against the person who they think broke the law.
00:47:15.078 - 00:47:17.000, Speaker B: This is different. Very different.
00:47:17.450 - 00:47:17.814, Speaker A: Here.
00:47:17.852 - 00:47:47.742, Speaker B: The SEC isn't just accusing the defendants of breaking the law. The SEC is also accusing ten unrelated, uncharged companies of breaking the law. Nine for failure to register digital asset securities, and one for operating under an unregistered national securities exchange. Despite leveling accusations against uncharged companies in public, the complaint is devoid of legal analysis. They didn't even give any analysis as to why the tokens are securities. The SEC just makes a few allegations of facts and then similarly concludes that they satisfy. Howey.
00:47:47.742 - 00:47:49.602, Speaker B: But surely these are the Howie test.
00:47:49.656 - 00:47:54.786, Speaker A: Which is kind of the legal court justification for why things are securities in the US.
00:47:54.888 - 00:48:14.890, Speaker B: Yeah. To win, the SEC must prove that one or more of these assets is a security in a real sense. These companies are on trial too, but the SEC didn't name them as defendants. They are only allowed to defend themselves in court. They are not allowed to defend themselves in court on principle. This is deeply unfair and unjust. Yes, that's probably a good place to wrap it up.
00:48:14.960 - 00:48:40.210, Speaker A: It goes on. Yeah, there's a lot more to this, but I think we kind of get the gist. Okay, so that's what's going on. Besides the defendants who are in this regrettable position of also trying to defend against the SEC here. Coinbase wrote a post fighting back here. The title of this blog post is Coinbase does not list securities. End of story.
00:48:40.210 - 00:48:51.526, Speaker A: This is by the chief legal officer of Coinbase. The TLDR is Coinbase does not list securities on its platform, period. I think the title we need to read here.
00:48:51.548 - 00:48:58.040, Speaker B: Just read the title. Yeah, the tone of this is like, hey, SEC, f off.
00:48:59.930 - 00:49:40.114, Speaker A: Why are you saying these are securities? You're providing no justification for why you've given no clarity, despite the crypto industry having asked for this for the last seven, eight years. And now you're just blanketly saying through this enforcement action that certain things are securities or not. My question, though, is, David, is this actually, in one way is sort of a good thing, in that the SEC will also have to prove in court that these nine assets are securities. I don't know, maybe some of them genuinely actually are securities. I can't attest to each of them. It's just the principle of, like, we have no idea what's a security and not. There's no clarity.
00:49:40.114 - 00:50:15.870, Speaker A: We have absolutely no clarity from the SEC. And they keep pointing to the Howie test, which is like, was it 1930s, 1940s legislation about an orange grove has not been adopted for the modern world and certainly not adopted for the world of cryptocurrencies. And they can barely say bitcoin is not a security. They barely say that. And sometimes they say ETh is not a security. And other times it feels like some of them try to wheel that back a little bit, too. And so we have absolutely no clarity, even though some of these assets are clearly commodities.
00:50:15.870 - 00:50:21.054, Speaker A: And this is what the SEC is doing, and I don't know what the end game is or why they're doing. David?
00:50:21.182 - 00:51:00.030, Speaker B: Yeah, I think this is just an illustration of what happens when one agency just gets off the rails and tries to do a power grab. And so the CFTC is playing in this game as well. So they release a statement. And they release a statement that starts with a quote, which I really love. And the quote is, in the words of federalist papers number 49, the people are the only legitimate fountain of power. And it is from them that the constitutional charter is derived. Government is and should be the servant of the people, and it should be fully accountable to them for the actions which it supposedly takes on their behalf.
00:51:00.610 - 00:51:02.346, Speaker A: First principles, baby.
00:51:02.538 - 00:51:29.814, Speaker B: Yes, we love the first principles thinking. And then they continue the case. SEC versus Wahi, one of the brothers, is a striking example of regulation by enforcement the SEC complaint alleges of dozens of digital assets, including those that could be described as utility tokens and or certain tokens relating to decentralized autonomous networks are securities. The fact that the CFTC is making a public statement about the errant nature of the SEC, that's a big deal.
00:51:30.012 - 00:51:33.158, Speaker A: It's a commissioner saying basically to the SEC, guys, chill.
00:51:33.254 - 00:51:33.574, Speaker B: Chill.
00:51:33.622 - 00:51:35.110, Speaker A: Like, just chill, Gary.
00:51:35.190 - 00:51:35.834, Speaker B: Right, okay.
00:51:35.872 - 00:51:59.678, Speaker A: You've gone too far. You're crossing some lines here. And it's not even clear that this is SEC's jurisdiction. Right? I mean, there's some turf war between the CFTC and the SEC. And the CFTC so far has been much more pro market innovation and not through enforcement regulation, through enforcement.
00:51:59.774 - 00:52:12.162, Speaker B: The problem with that, Ryan, is that the CFTC is okay. Like, you guys industry. There's some rough edges, but good job. Keep going. Let's see where this goes. We'll be relatively hands off. Bitmex.
00:52:12.162 - 00:52:24.506, Speaker B: No, no bad. We're going after you. But for the rest of you guys, keep going cautiously and then the SEC is like, oh, CFTC, you're just like leaving this open for us. We can have all of this. We'll take it. We'll take all of this.
00:52:24.528 - 00:52:53.022, Speaker A: It's the same reason libertarians never win elections, right? Just because it's just like, the tactics they use aren't working. So the bigger government policy ends up winning. But this is really hurting coin stock. I don't know if you've seen this, David, but Coinbase shares tumbled 21% and this was right after the report that it's facing an SEC probe. That's what you call it, being probed by the SEC. Sounds lovely. Coinbase valuation.
00:52:53.022 - 00:52:58.370, Speaker A: Look at this. Since IPo data. That's brutal. We got a bear market here, of course.
00:52:58.520 - 00:53:06.966, Speaker B: Sure. But ironically, I think when Coinbase ipoed, yeah, that was the top of the May market. Felt like the top of the market, man.
00:53:07.148 - 00:53:11.574, Speaker A: It's kind of funny because I'm like kind of bullish coinbase coin at these prices.
00:53:11.702 - 00:53:19.322, Speaker B: Ironically, you know what it takes for it to be especially bullish Coinbase for the SEC to get just like a leash on it.
00:53:19.456 - 00:53:34.798, Speaker A: Yeah, through the court system. I mean, where else is the leash going to come? It's got to be executive order, which doesn't seem to want to rein that in. Or the court system. This is interesting as well. Related, unrelated, who knows Kathy Wood of Arc. She is bitcoin bull. Of course.
00:53:34.798 - 00:53:48.798, Speaker A: Arc invest, they just sold nearly 1.15 million shares of coin at all time. Lows of $53 and their average purchase price was $254. So down bad on that trade.
00:53:48.894 - 00:53:49.986, Speaker B: It's called down bad.
00:53:50.088 - 00:54:30.658, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess like a take, as a reminder take here is I feel like a lot of people are trying to solve problems through regulation right now in the Coinbase. So even if you think about the Coinbase insider trading problem, David, what if we just allowed everyone to list assets and there was no such thing as front running? Imagine that. We don't have to imagine that. That's called uniswap. The take here is stop trying to solve everything with regulated crypto banks. That's what the genslers want. The answer to listing front running is uniswap, where anyone can list.
00:54:30.658 - 00:55:03.638, Speaker A: The way to prevent another Celsius is by using Aave, where loans are on chain, we have the solution. It's called defi. I do think that Defi doesn't solve everything, but it does solve some of these problems here, including lack of transparency in a black box. We had the Celsius and the blockfis of the world, and also including Coinbase front running. If you're listing an asset on Uniswap, anyone can list anytime. There's no insider information whatsoever for an asset listing, and it eliminates the problem completely. You eliminate the need for regulation.
00:55:03.638 - 00:55:15.700, Speaker A: That is the model for DeFi. Or the regulation happens on chain, and everyone can be a regulator. Anyone can audit this thing at any time. That is the better solution than clamping down in a big way.
00:55:16.070 - 00:55:55.918, Speaker B: The whole point of labeling something as security is because of information asymmetry. Like, if you are the issuer or the manager, then you know things than the buyer does, and that gives you a bunch of lot. Not everything. You just said that DFI doesn't fix everything, so we're alluding to the same thing. But DFI fixes a lot of the information asymmetry, like the majority of it, and it really reduces information asymmetry. So, sure, ten people could get together, make a Dow issue, a token, and that might be considered a security because you have these issuers. But maybe, I don't know, join the discord, see what they're up to.
00:55:55.918 - 00:55:58.554, Speaker B: If they allow that, you can see their behavior on chain.
00:55:58.602 - 00:56:05.286, Speaker A: You can on chain. Basically, they're like quarterly statements in real time. You get to see revenues.
00:56:05.338 - 00:56:18.178, Speaker B: So a lot of transparency happens. So even if it's a security, if it's a token on chain, automatically, there's so much reduced information asymmetry. So, yeah, I don't know. Gensler, take it into account. Bro.
00:56:18.264 - 00:56:34.250, Speaker A: Yeah. What we're saying is there's wins for you, Gary. If you come to DeFi, look at DeFi, if you get back to base principles of what are we trying to do? More transparent, fair, orderly, efficient markets. There's some wins on the DeFi front, and we wish you would see that, Gary, in the SEC. It makes us one day.
00:56:34.320 - 00:56:35.066, Speaker B: It makes us.
00:56:35.168 - 00:56:43.078, Speaker A: David. This is not sad, though. Breaking some good news, some breaking news. What is happening now with the verge of the merge?
00:56:43.174 - 00:57:16.082, Speaker B: Yeah, the Ethereum developers have announced the merge date for the Gorely testnet. Kind of weird. It's weird to say they announced a merge date and then the date is a range between August 6 and twelveth because of the way that this works. They have announced the TTD, which is total terminal difficulty, which is basically a metric that is like related to the hash power of the Goreley network. As we get closer, we'll kind of know this date between 6th and the twelveth. It'll happen. The Gorli test net is going of August, which is the last test net before the merge.
00:57:16.082 - 00:57:35.454, Speaker B: Bankless will be live streaming this and the host from the estakers, probably Anthony Suzano, if he wants to come, whoever's big in the staking community that wants to come will host them. We're going to live stream this merge. If it all goes well. If it all goes well, Brian, I give it four weeks till merge. Maybe five, maybe six, maybe 6.
00:57:35.492 - 00:57:36.122, Speaker A: September.
00:57:36.266 - 00:57:38.058, Speaker B: September. September.
00:57:38.234 - 00:57:38.622, Speaker A: Wow.
00:57:38.676 - 00:57:41.454, Speaker B: If it goes well. If it goes well, September merge and.
00:57:41.492 - 00:57:43.006, Speaker A: The others have gone well.
00:57:43.108 - 00:57:44.494, Speaker B: I will say the others have gone well.
00:57:44.532 - 00:57:51.362, Speaker A: They will have gone well. They have gone well enough to pass that test of going yes, correct. This is big, man.
00:57:51.416 - 00:57:52.066, Speaker B: This is big.
00:57:52.168 - 00:58:09.986, Speaker A: This might be happening, guys. We're going to stream it here. Of course we're going to have lots of merch coverage for you, so much that you'd be sick of talking about it. We've got some other things to cover when we come back. First, Poap and the WNBA. This is a non speculative crypto use case. Love what Poap is doing here.
00:58:09.986 - 00:58:24.094, Speaker A: Secondly, the uniswap token. There's some fee switch rumblings they may be turning on the revenue stream. We'll talk about that, too, and its effect on the larger dFI token market. But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.

Bankless lens Protocol is an open source tech stack for building decentralized social media applications. It is the new era. Through social media, we all have toxic relationships with our web. Two apps. We want to break up with them, but we can't. These applications own our digital lives and all the relationships that we've made.
00:59:16.334 - 00:59:39.074, Speaker B: We need to break through to a new paradigm of social networking applications that we control rather than them controlling us. Lens isn't a social media app. It's a protocol to let a thousand web three social apps bloom. Lens is a permissionless and transparent social graph that is owned by the user. In crypto, we say, not your keys, not your crypto. And on lens, we say, not your keys, not your profile. With lens, your followers go with you to whatever social media application you want to use.
00:59:39.074 - 01:00:09.754, Speaker B: And instead of being trapped by an algorithm chosen by that app, lens lets you choose the way you want to experience your social media. Lens is the last social media handle that you'll ever need to create. So in order to get started, there is a secret code word in the show notes. Enter that code word in the Google form link and you'll be well on your way to entering the world of web three social. And we're back with a battle of the ZKE evms. This was a huge theme during ECC week. Three different teams independently launched their ZKE EVM roadmap, Scroll, Polygon, and ZK sync.
01:00:09.754 - 01:00:42.246, Speaker B: Happened to just be ZKE EVM week, probably, depending on when you're listening to this, I am hosting a live stream with Scroll, Polygon, and ZK sync today Friday. If you're listening to this today, 08:00 a.m. Eastern time. And so it might already have been happening. Maybe if you're listening to this very early morning, it's about to happen. We are hosting all these teams to talk about their ZKE EVM, but we have three different teams going after the ZKeVM. Ryan, can you explain why we are so bullish on ZKE evms, and what the difference is between all of these various ZKE EVM flavors.
01:00:42.278 - 01:01:27.750, Speaker A: So we talked about it last week, why ZK evms are important. And it's basically because you can get all of the goodness and expressivity of the Ethereum main chain only in a layer two. That is ZK roll up secured. And there's this term that was bandied about that people still have questions about of EVM equivalents. What does it mean? How do you stack these platforms side by side? And I thought this was a great illustration of equivalence. So what you're trying to do is everything that you can build and deploy on the Ethereum mainnet, you want to be able to do the exact same thing, have it be mirrored as close as possible to the theorem mainnet in a ZKE EVM world. And the different Zk EVM solutions take different approaches to that.
01:01:27.750 - 01:02:13.218, Speaker A: If you're to kind of like boil the technical stack into three layers, you have kind of like the very low level runtime layer. It's where everything is kind of eventually compiled down. All the code that somebody writes in solidity is compiled down to runtime. Above that you have another layer, the bytecode layer, and then above that you have the actual language. So in the case of Ethereum on the main net, you're programming the language of solidity in almost all cases. And so EVM equivalence and EVM compatibility means some level of the runtime bytecode and language layer mirroring what's happening on the Ethereum side. So Starknet basically allows you to do solidity, but then it transforms that into another kind of language that is called Cairo.
01:02:13.218 - 01:03:03.538, Speaker A: And then it has its own bytecode layer, it has its own runtime, does not mirror Ethereum closely. Zk sync is kind of next it allows you to write in solidity, and then it compiles that down. But the bytecode and runtime are still different than the Ethereum mainnet. Hermes goes a step farther, and some of the bytecode at kind of the opcode layer is basically the same as Ethereum mainnet. And then scroll goes the farthest where it is the most equivalent to Ethereum of all four of the solutions, where it gets down to kind of the bytecode layer. And the runtime, of course, is the ZKE EVM. That's kind of the difference between all of these solutions is you can sort of transport your solidity code on Starknet.
01:03:03.538 - 01:03:19.260, Speaker A: You kind of have to learn some Cairo on zksync. You can sort of port your solidity code same with Hermes and Scroll, but with scroll, it has more equivalence to Ethereum at the bytecode layer. And these other solutions don't have as much, though they have some.
01:03:19.870 - 01:03:21.770, Speaker B: Well done. I'm impressed.
01:03:23.150 - 01:03:27.162, Speaker A: Someone more technical is just going to be like, all of that was trash. Bad explanation.
01:03:27.306 - 01:03:29.866, Speaker B: But everyone less technical is be like, oh, wow. Thanks, Ryan.
01:03:29.898 - 01:03:30.730, Speaker A: He's really smart.
01:03:30.810 - 01:03:32.170, Speaker B: He's really smart.
01:03:32.330 - 01:03:39.666, Speaker A: Let's talk about this. Hayden. Tweet David. So this is the uniswap token. It is printing money. Not the token, but the protocol. What are we looking at?
01:03:39.688 - 01:04:20.442, Speaker B: Protocol? Yeah, we're looking at. We've seen this so many times before, but this one is even the biggest, the biggest discrepancy between the Uniswap fees earned through the Uniswap trading fee protocol, $7.5 million in one day, versus Ethereum's $2 million. So, like, Uniswap fees up, Ethereum gas fees down $9 million a day, average in daily earned fees for Uniswap liquidity providers, which is just crazy. I mean, we usually would talk about this in markets, but there's more to the story this time. So there's a governance proposal about the Uniswap fee switch. Not necessarily to turn it on, but perhaps about a redesign.
01:04:20.442 - 01:04:50.650, Speaker B: So this thing coming out of a latent Cusack fee switch design space and next steps. And he begins saying, there has been a lot of discussion around whether the fee switch should be turned on. In most of this discussion, I see an assumption that using the fee switch equals money going to uni token holders. I think this is limiting. I'm not going to read out this whole entire proposal, but there's conversations in the Uniswap governance about the fee switch. So anything at this point would be great. And anything is happening.
01:04:50.650 - 01:05:10.942, Speaker B: Something is happening. There is a podcast coming out on Monday about Dow governance and how Dao governance needs to get fixed in order to fix protocol fees. So that's highly relevant. That is with Hazu. It's one of the best podcasts we've ever recorded. But the fact that Uniswap's printing money. There is a proposal being actively discussed called fee switch design space.
01:05:10.942 - 01:05:11.760, Speaker B: And next.
01:05:13.570 - 01:05:17.280, Speaker A: Is the switch is coming? Is that what you're saying? You think it might.
01:05:17.970 - 01:05:25.454, Speaker B: It's not coming, at the very least. I don't know if we're making steps in the right direction, but we are not making steps in the wrong direction.
01:05:25.502 - 01:05:47.414, Speaker A: At the very least. Look, I think that Hasio episode is perfect because there is this perception of our DeFi protocols. Our blue chips are not broken. They just handled the recent crash phenomenally well. They're still printing money from a revenue perspective, but there's a perception that the tokens themselves are broken. From a value accrual perspective, valueless governance.
01:05:47.462 - 01:05:50.502, Speaker B: Tokens has turned into an actual, not a meme, but actuality.
01:05:50.566 - 01:06:32.458, Speaker A: Exactly. And so that's the discussion we have with Hasu is how do we fix that? I'm pretty optimistic that we will fix it and fix it this cycle, and we're starting to see that in governance play out anyway. Definitely tune into that episode, David. I've had this question of whether not many people are talking about it, which maybe means people aren't going to do. But I could imagine that the chain that gets forked merge and becomes kind of the canonical Ethereum chain with proof of stake. Right? That will obviously happen, but someone will probably continue to operate the Ethereum chain in a proof of work environment, like an Ethereum classic, classic type of move.
01:06:32.544 - 01:06:33.802, Speaker B: No, classic cash.
01:06:33.936 - 01:06:37.082, Speaker A: Classic cash. Ethereum. Is this a thing that's happening?
01:06:37.136 - 01:06:40.442, Speaker B: Oh, I don't know, but I would imagine. What else are we going to call it?
01:06:40.576 - 01:06:51.886, Speaker A: Well, it just seems like opportunity. Do you remember that time when there was like, I don't know, 50 different flavors of bitcoin? Like bitcoin diamond bitcoin, bitcoin private bitcoin gold bitcoin. Exactly.
01:06:51.988 - 01:06:54.574, Speaker B: Cash, bitcoin, Satoshi's vision around the time.
01:06:54.612 - 01:06:57.458, Speaker A: That bitcoin cash forked, Satoshi's vision, all.
01:06:57.464 - 01:07:09.906, Speaker B: Of these things, you could probably append an adjective to bitcoin, and there was probably a fork of that. It was called the fork and fair launch era, and it was equivalent to our DFI yield farm era.
01:07:09.938 - 01:07:12.914, Speaker A: But for bitcoin and proof of work, like 2017 era.
01:07:13.042 - 01:07:14.066, Speaker B: 2016 to 17.
01:07:14.098 - 01:07:19.490, Speaker A: Yeah, 2016. So do you think anyone's going to do this? Yeah, probably like the miners.
01:07:19.570 - 01:07:40.270, Speaker B: I mean, it just takes a very minimum amount of coordination to coordinate on the new shelling point, which is the proof of work chain that forks off of Ethereum before it goes to proof of stake. Why not? Well, and the thing is, if some people do it, then traders do it, and if traders do it, then other traders do it, and all of a sudden it becomes a shelling point.
01:07:40.420 - 01:07:52.030, Speaker A: I feel like all the people that would have done this are busy with their own chains, though. They've already made a right. It's like, you know, he's got Tron. You can't fork another ethereum.
01:07:52.110 - 01:07:59.062, Speaker B: Oh, sir, you underestimate Justin sun, sir, Justin sun will do whatever he wants if it makes him money.
01:07:59.116 - 01:08:09.718, Speaker A: Look, the great news if you are an ETH holder is of course you just get this coin too, whether it's valuable or valueless. Get it, sell it. Free airdrop, free fork.
01:08:09.894 - 01:08:13.260, Speaker B: I will say that you should sell it.
01:08:14.270 - 01:08:15.254, Speaker A: You never know, David.
01:08:15.302 - 01:08:19.770, Speaker B: I don't know how fast or slow, but eventually you should get rid of it.
01:08:19.840 - 01:08:29.440, Speaker A: Okay. Not financial advice, but you should definitely sell nft stuff. David. This is pretty cool by the way.
01:08:30.050 - 01:08:32.000, Speaker B: We didn't even start that story.
01:08:32.530 - 01:08:34.574, Speaker A: This story was a different story.
01:08:34.692 - 01:09:07.254, Speaker B: Ant pool, which is a proof of work mining farm for Ethereum, supports Ethereum classic ecosystem with $10 million investment. Ethereum classic is the proof of work. Ethereum chain that forked off of Ethereum with a Dow hack. It's the one that has embraced proof of work. Ant pool, a proof of work miner, has invested $10 million to support the Ethereum classic ecosystem. Makes sense because these people have hefty, hefty financial investment into proof of work. And so they would love it if Ethereum classic had a vibrant ecosystem so they could just mine that chain and sell those tokens.
01:09:07.254 - 01:09:11.694, Speaker B: Because what is the Ethereum classic market cap, Ryan, it's got to be under a billion, right?
01:09:11.732 - 01:09:14.158, Speaker A: Looking at this, what are we?
01:09:14.324 - 01:09:15.166, Speaker B: Market cap.
01:09:15.268 - 01:09:19.710, Speaker A: Wow, this is 8.5 billion, my friend.
01:09:19.780 - 01:09:22.190, Speaker B: Well, yeah, but it's also up 40% on the day.
01:09:22.260 - 01:09:26.302, Speaker A: Oh, it's been appreciating relative to ETH recently. Yeah, well, big are doing this, right?
01:09:26.356 - 01:09:51.574, Speaker B: Yeah, but also this quarter trillion dollar network, Ethereum is going to turn all of the revenue towards proof of work miners off. And then these miners that are mining this quarter or 200 billion dollar network are all going to go and start mining this $8 billion network. And so margins are going to get real thin. And so these miners are investing in Ethereum classic because they need to pump up the chain because that's their revenue source.
01:09:51.622 - 01:10:02.986, Speaker A: Maybe that's, David, maybe that's why there won't be many forks or any forks of a pre merged Ethereum is because there'll be one. Ethereum classic kind of has that niche already.
01:10:03.168 - 01:10:26.954, Speaker B: Yeah, but if you fork off of the most recent chain, you get a lot of like Makerdao and all compound. All these things are still like the contracts are on Ethereum, things like Dai will break because the ether price on the new ether price will go to zero or very low. Like USDC is not going to be honored. A lot of things that are going to be extremely chaotic on that chain. But I don't know. You can pick something up from the ashes.
01:10:27.022 - 01:10:29.750, Speaker A: There you go. For the enterprising young scammer.
01:10:31.290 - 01:10:35.382, Speaker B: Just long enough for me to sell. Just let me sell. There you go.
01:10:35.436 - 01:10:39.546, Speaker A: Hey, maybe something could come of it. We shouldn't be so sure here.
01:10:39.648 - 01:10:42.860, Speaker B: Yeah, something as in more ether for me.
01:10:43.550 - 01:10:54.490, Speaker A: Let's talk about poap. NFT stuff. This is Roz saying, I'm a giga fan of poap because they found product market fit outside speculation. And this is a tweet.
01:10:54.650 - 01:10:57.006, Speaker B: A few have done that in a.
01:10:57.028 - 01:11:08.610, Speaker A: Stadium on the Megatron scan to collect your WNBA NFT. It's a Po app. And this is a partnership with the WNBA.
01:11:09.270 - 01:11:32.822, Speaker B: The WNBA releases this to do, like, what is this? And they say, we're excited to announce that everyone attending the 2022 WNBA Commissioners cup championship, presented by Coinbase on July 26, will have the opportunity to mint a free collectible NFT called a Po app. This is the first ever WNBA issued NFT, and it serves as a digital proof that you attended the game. Kind of like a ticket stub or souvenir.
01:11:32.966 - 01:11:39.162, Speaker A: Cool. That's very good explanation of what a PO app is, actually. Right?
01:11:39.216 - 01:11:39.626, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:11:39.728 - 01:11:44.942, Speaker A: Good job, guys. And that's exactly what a Po app is. This is the Po app itself on Po.
01:11:44.996 - 01:11:45.166, Speaker B: Wow.
01:11:45.188 - 01:12:13.734, Speaker A: It's pretty gallery. Yeah, it looks great. And I think about 84, 8700 people or so inputted their emails. We'll start working at something like this. But these are new people entering the crypto world that previously wouldn't have. And these are definitely more the normie side, right? This is not a speculative asset use case. It's nothing.
01:12:13.734 - 01:12:19.926, Speaker A: DFI, I guess it's nfts. But all you had to do was show up to a game, to an event. That's cool. I love that. Yeah.
01:12:19.948 - 01:12:31.286, Speaker B: So, like, 84 people got them. So 84 people pulled out their phone, scan their QR code, and had a mobile wallet to collect that PO app. 84 people at a Wa NBA game had a mobile wallet.
01:12:31.318 - 01:12:41.950, Speaker A: That's kind of. Let's talk about this, David. There is a bill before Congress, bipartisan bill, seeks to eliminate taxes on crypto transactions under $50.
01:12:42.100 - 01:12:44.400, Speaker B: If I had one of those kazoo things, I like.
01:12:46.290 - 01:12:50.562, Speaker A: I mean, cool, but just under $50, that's all. $500?
01:12:50.616 - 01:12:52.340, Speaker B: Yeah. Come on. 500, please.
01:12:53.110 - 01:12:56.290, Speaker A: Yeah, but these are some of the.
01:12:56.360 - 01:13:01.718, Speaker B: That's not even dinner. Like, if I have to pay somebody back for dinner, it's like, over $50, right?
01:13:01.804 - 01:13:06.578, Speaker A: I mean, I guess this is gas fees maybe sometimes. Most of the time on Ethereum.
01:13:06.754 - 01:13:09.126, Speaker B: I guess so yeah, that'd be nice. That'd be nice.
01:13:09.228 - 01:13:10.710, Speaker A: Some progress. I don't know.
01:13:10.780 - 01:13:11.290, Speaker B: It's something.
01:13:11.360 - 01:13:12.614, Speaker A: We have to see if that goes anywhere.
01:13:12.662 - 01:13:15.180, Speaker B: You know that it's something meme. It's something.
01:13:16.350 - 01:13:32.618, Speaker A: I haven't seen that meme, but yeah, I see it now. Other news, Solana has physical stores now. It's like the Apple store. There is a Salana store. Looks like in the background there's some t shirts. Looks like there's a shoe over there.
01:13:32.724 - 01:13:33.970, Speaker B: Yeah. What is that?
01:13:34.120 - 01:13:40.980, Speaker A: There's some NFT frames as well. I can say anything more about this.
01:13:41.350 - 01:13:41.714, Speaker B: Okay.
01:13:41.752 - 01:13:42.786, Speaker A: Salana's got a store.
01:13:42.888 - 01:13:45.874, Speaker B: Salana has got a store. Is it open twenty four seven or does it close?
01:13:45.912 - 01:13:48.662, Speaker A: Where is this store? I would kind of like to visit actually.
01:13:48.716 - 01:13:50.066, Speaker B: Come on. That was a funny joke.
01:13:50.178 - 01:13:51.014, Speaker A: What did you say?
01:13:51.132 - 01:13:53.142, Speaker B: Is it open twenty four seven or does it close?
01:13:53.196 - 01:13:59.414, Speaker A: Oh, dude, great. Edit that. Delete that. We're going to do that.
01:13:59.452 - 01:14:01.462, Speaker B: Don't do that. That was a good joke.
01:14:01.526 - 01:14:14.406, Speaker A: Let's move on. Chipotle buy the dip promo includes $200,000 in crypto for customers Coinbase accounts. The restaurant chain is also giving away $2 million in Guacamole and queso to celebrate national avocado.
01:14:14.438 - 01:14:16.926, Speaker B: Oh God, it's a bear market. God. Next.
01:14:17.108 - 01:14:23.134, Speaker A: You wanted to include this, David, so you have to live with it. Now tell us why this is significant for a roll up, sir.
01:14:23.332 - 01:14:24.518, Speaker B: Oh. Coinbase.
01:14:24.554 - 01:14:29.150, Speaker A: Chipotle has adopted crypto bullet, guacamole.
01:14:29.230 - 01:14:58.746, Speaker B: Next, please. Introducing web three subscriptions coming out of mirror. This is a real announcement. We're back to being totally serious. Mirror says that they are excited to announce the launch of web three subscriptions. This new feature allows readers to subscribe to any mirror publication with their wallets and receive email notifications when content is posted. For creators web three subscriptions open the door to building a wallet based community as opposed to an email based community that can be used across web three.
01:14:58.746 - 01:15:10.174, Speaker B: So basically, rather than using your email and password, you use your Ethereum wallet. And a big headline, big line that they title a paragraph says the future of community is wallet native. Big fans of that.
01:15:10.212 - 01:15:20.718, Speaker A: Big fan, big fan. I really like what mirror is doing. Like Mirror the substac killer. I don't know. They're making some progress. This is all about winning the hearts and minds of the creator community. And I think that's better done with nfts.
01:15:20.718 - 01:15:21.714, Speaker A: David, what's this?
01:15:21.752 - 01:15:28.354, Speaker B: As previous Substac customers, we would know. Wallet Connect. Oh, yes. Oh, yeah. Oopsies.
01:15:28.402 - 01:15:29.510, Speaker A: Don't jump the gun.
01:15:29.930 - 01:15:41.738, Speaker B: Wallet connect. Say hello to the future of chat. With wallet Connect chat, you can dm any user using any wallet on any chain. So wallet connect, releasing a chat. Cool. Nice, nice. Next.
01:15:41.824 - 01:15:45.130, Speaker A: I like this. I want to do it. I just don't know who to do it with. David?
01:15:45.470 - 01:15:46.220, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:15:46.830 - 01:15:50.540, Speaker A: We chat on discord. Right? Chat you up.
01:15:52.110 - 01:15:54.254, Speaker B: Okay, Ryan, you want to take this one? You should take this one.
01:15:54.292 - 01:16:20.674, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. This is raises. So we're talking about raises. So Aptos is a layer one chain that just raised $150,000,000 from FTX, jump, crypto and more and friends. I think Aptos was the former people involved with the DM project, the Novi project at Facebook. So Aptos consists of the leaders, engineers and strategic talent behind years of development at DM and Novi.
01:16:20.674 - 01:16:49.310, Speaker A: You remember when DM was like a big thing, 2018, it was the blockchain that was going to come eat Ethereum and all of the other smart contract chains. It's called DM. It's best engineers in the game. They were at Facebook and they developed this not solidity, this programming language called Move. Well, it's back now. It's called Aptos. And I've actually heard in the developer community some rumblings that move is kind of cool, kind of works better in some ways maybe, than solidity.
01:16:49.310 - 01:17:11.542, Speaker A: That does not say much for the Aptos chain. I'm not sure about that. But the same tech, and it kind of begs the question. It's like you look at some of the investors here, FTX and jump crypto. Besides Aptos, there's another chain that's similar to this that also uses move rather than solidity. It's called sue. And so is this the rise David of the ETH killer killers, question mark.
01:17:11.542 - 01:17:13.522, Speaker A: Is this a Solana killer?
01:17:13.666 - 01:17:15.686, Speaker B: Around the roller coaster we go.
01:17:15.788 - 01:17:46.658, Speaker A: Yeah, it's interesting. The set of investors, of course, are typical investors who've funded other layer ones in the past. The skeptic take here is rotator is going to rotate and we get a new crop of alt layer ones every single cycle. And here's another one. I guess the more optimistic take is awesome. More funding move is potentially a really cool technology. Who knows what these blockchains can bring to the table? Doing more experiments, getting more funding for these experiments as well.
01:17:46.658 - 01:17:48.580, Speaker A: What's your personal take, my friend?
01:17:51.350 - 01:17:57.826, Speaker B: I don't know how to differentiate it other than the backstory of Facebook. I'll wait until I see a community.
01:17:57.928 - 01:18:02.406, Speaker A: There you go. What a reasoned, rational take from my co host here.
01:18:02.508 - 01:18:06.102, Speaker B: Also, I'm just exhausted. Ryan, are you hot in there?
01:18:06.156 - 01:18:07.094, Speaker A: Do you have the ac off?
01:18:07.132 - 01:18:09.260, Speaker B: No, I'm exhausted of all the.
01:18:10.830 - 01:18:26.480, Speaker A: I thought you're exhausted because we just did like a three hour podcast with Bellagi. We do a lot of podcasts, guys. Unstoppable domains. They just reached unicorn status after their latest raise. So over a billion dollars. That's what unicorn means. A $65 million series a.
01:18:27.170 - 01:18:33.450, Speaker B: How does unstoppable domains make money? I feel like they've gotten drowned out by ens.
01:18:33.610 - 01:18:41.826, Speaker A: They sell domains. It's a good business model. Dot crypto. I have a dot crypto. I did not purchase it, but I have one. Let's talk about.
01:18:41.848 - 01:18:43.090, Speaker B: You didn't give them money.
01:18:43.240 - 01:18:50.254, Speaker A: Bankless jobs. A few cool jobs, of course, as always. This is your reminder to what, David? What do they need to do?
01:18:50.392 - 01:18:57.766, Speaker B: Get a job in crypto. Do you listen to how much fun me and Ryan have? I mean, bankless probably has the most amount of fun out of any company.
01:18:57.948 - 01:19:01.238, Speaker A: Everything's like, just.
01:19:01.404 - 01:19:02.374, Speaker B: We have a lot of fun.
01:19:02.412 - 01:19:03.240, Speaker A: We want you.
01:19:04.670 - 01:19:06.522, Speaker B: Other companies also have fun.
01:19:06.576 - 01:19:07.034, Speaker A: Yes.
01:19:07.152 - 01:19:12.202, Speaker B: And so you should get a job in crypto because they are probably more fun than your boomer web two tradfi job.
01:19:12.256 - 01:19:14.574, Speaker A: Oh, there's also some bankless jobs alpha. Oh, wow.
01:19:14.612 - 01:19:17.322, Speaker B: I wonder why. I was talking about how fun it is to work at bankless.
01:19:17.386 - 01:19:20.522, Speaker A: But first, vertex protocol. A marketing coordinator.
01:19:20.586 - 01:19:21.802, Speaker B: That's nontechnical.

01:19:38.238 - 01:19:38.814, Speaker B: That's non technical.
01:19:38.862 - 01:19:46.130, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. Okay, cool. Steakfish, smart contract software engineer. Steakfish. Backend engineer, steakfish. Blockchain marketer.
01:19:46.210 - 01:19:47.090, Speaker B: That's non technical.

01:19:53.074 - 01:19:55.078, Speaker B: Don't know what that is, but it's definitely non technical.
01:19:55.174 - 01:19:57.162, Speaker A: Bankless academy. I know what that is up and coming.
01:19:57.216 - 01:19:59.098, Speaker B: I do know what that is, but I don't know what they're up to.
01:19:59.184 - 01:20:14.314, Speaker A: Guys, there's so much for you there. Go follow the bankless jobs board at bankless palette.com. Make sure you plug in your email. You'll get these updates via email. When they come up, you'll know what the jobs are. David Devcon's coming up too. Should do a quick psa for Devcon.
01:20:14.314 - 01:20:18.814, Speaker A: What's Devcon about? And what's some of the alpha around Devcon.
01:20:18.942 - 01:20:28.798, Speaker B: Yeah. So it's a little bit like Devconnect that we did back in Amsterdam. Amsterdam was the first devconnect. Devcon, this will be the 7th. No, 6th. 6th. Devcon.
01:20:28.798 - 01:20:46.802, Speaker B: This one. It's held all over the world. If I was on my game, I would be able to list off every previous city that Devcon's ever been to. Even though Ryan, I have been to zero of them and I'm very bummed about that. But I will be going to Devcon number six. So Devcon ticket sales are underway. They are re release in tranches.
01:20:46.802 - 01:21:00.990, Speaker B: You can get your tickets at. For English, tickets.org. Oh, did I say org? Devcon.org. For your tickets. It's in Bagoda. Columbia. Some people got a little bit turned off by.
01:21:00.990 - 01:21:02.218, Speaker B: Columbia is scary.
01:21:02.314 - 01:21:03.878, Speaker A: Everyone's asking, is it safe?
01:21:03.914 - 01:21:09.038, Speaker B: David, if Vitalik's going, I'm going and I'm going to go anyways. Even if he doesn't.
01:21:09.054 - 01:21:09.810, Speaker A: Looks beautiful.
01:21:09.960 - 01:21:26.994, Speaker B: I'm definitely going like, yo, there are hotels and stuff. It's fine, it's fine. Yeah, it's going to be great. It's happening in October, like 11th through 14 October. So I will certainly be going. I'm very excited.
01:21:27.042 - 01:21:46.830, Speaker A: There is also a special discount for students, builders and particular students from Latin America. So we'll include a link to where you can find that as well. David, we got some hot stuff coming up next, including questions for you and I from the nation, including is eth a veblin good? Question mark.
01:21:46.900 - 01:21:47.502, Speaker B: Love this question.
01:21:47.556 - 01:21:53.630, Speaker A: What is a veblin good? Another question. What's Ryan and David's life like when they're not working? Does that even exist?
01:21:54.130 - 01:21:55.950, Speaker B: Who let that question in?
01:21:56.100 - 01:22:05.474, Speaker A: Hot takes from crypto? Twitter, of course. We've got a few hot takes for you as well. We'll be right back. But before we get there, we want to tell you about these fantastic sponsors that make bankless possible.
01:22:05.592 - 01:22:55.742, Speaker B: ZK sync is an ethereum layer two network that is pushing the frontier of high performance blockchains that don't compromise on security or decentralization. Zksync has combined the power of zero knowledge rollups in the Ethereum virtual machine, enabling developers to build the greatest web three project possible, ones we haven't even seen yet. Crypto needs its killer applications to onboard the world. But crypto killer apps need Zksync as a platform to build on first. It's generally accepted that zero knowledge rollups are the conclusion of crypto, blockchain scaling technology and Zksync is leading the charge into the final frontier of crypto economics. So if you're a developer who wants to build your app on a future proof foundation, which gives your users the best UX possible, check out Zksync's website at zksync IO. And yes, there's also going to be a token, so give them a follow on Twitter too at zksync rocket pool is your decentralized ethereum staking protocol.
01:22:55.742 - 01:23:33.434, Speaker B: You can stake your eth in rocket pool and get our EtH in return, allowing you to stake your ETH and use it in DFI at the same time. You can get 4% on your Eth by staking it with rocket pool, but you can get even more by running a node. Rocket pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating Ethereum nodes. Setting up your rocket pool node is easier than running a node solo, and you only need 16 eth to get started. You get an extra 15% staking commission on the pooled eth that uses your node to stake. You also get RPL token rewards on top. So if you're bullish e staking, you can boost your yield by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pool network, which currently has over 1000 independent node operators.
01:23:33.434 - 01:23:42.510, Speaker B: It's yield farming, but with Ethereum nodes you can get started@rocketpool.net and you can also join the rocket pool community in their discord. You can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat, so I'll see you there.
01:23:42.580 - 01:24:06.234, Speaker A: Hey guys, we are back, starting with the questions for the nation. As a reminder, if you have a question for David, myself for the roll up, get it in. Go follow us on Twitter. That's bankless hq on Twitter. If you have a question for the roll up, we're throwing a thread out there every Wednesday and just add your question to the list. The first here this week is from mymoneyplan. Ch is eth a kind of veblin good? That is a good.
01:24:06.234 - 01:24:16.254, Speaker A: That's demand increases as its price increases, like designer handbags, the Gucci, the Prada, that sort of thing. Is eth a Velen good? David, what do you say?
01:24:16.372 - 01:24:18.974, Speaker B: Ryan? The answer is unequivocally yes.
01:24:19.092 - 01:24:19.854, Speaker A: Yes it is.
01:24:19.892 - 01:25:33.762, Speaker B: And we have two ways of answering this question. One, we can just kind of reason about this ether the yield, the real world yield, as in what you can buy with ether yields goes up when ether price goes up, right? How am I trying to say this? Okay, so 32 ether gets you like five to 7% yield at like $1,000 price. It'll still get you a five to 7% ETH nominated yield at $1,000 or so. The yield does not go down in real terms as the price goes up, which makes it desirable as price goes up because the yield is always the same. We also can see this in the transactional volume of this thing, whereas we were talking about today, Ryan, where the volume of gas markets or the Gui prices super low because it's a bear market. But when it was a bull market, we had 4400, 500, 600 sustained guay gas prices for weeks. Because as the economy heats up on ethereum, more transactions happen on ethereum, more ether gets burnt, more yield goes to stakers.
01:25:33.762 - 01:25:57.680, Speaker B: And so as ether price goes up because the bull market is on, the yields go up, the eth burn goes up, and the price goes up. And so this turns into a positive feedback loop, which is exactly what a veblin good is. So this thing actually perpetuates itself forward. Now, it doesn't do that in a short time frame. It does it over like 1020 year long horizons. And so this self perpetuating bull market, I think, will take a long time to play out. But yes, this thing is a vebbling good.
01:25:57.680 - 01:26:31.078, Speaker B: It also gets more liquid as the price goes up. That's like a normal property of all assets. But it's especially true of ether, because it has its own native liquidity inside of things like uniswap and balancer and all these exchanges. And so ethereum provides ether, its own liquidity, which scales with price. It provides increasing yields as price goes up. So price goes up, but yields increase faster in real terms, not in these terms, in real terms. And so is eth a kind of febling glid? Does it get more demand as price goes up? Answer Ryan.
01:26:31.078 - 01:26:33.098, Speaker B: Yes. Yes it does.
01:26:33.264 - 01:26:42.698, Speaker A: There it is. All along, eth wasn't luxury. It wasn't ultrasound money, it was luxury money all along. That is a terrible prada of money. Gucci of money.
01:26:42.784 - 01:26:44.830, Speaker B: I do not subscribe to this Beblin good.
01:26:44.900 - 01:27:09.942, Speaker A: That's what you just said, david. I quoted you directly. Go to the second question. How does your day week normally look like in terms of work, outside of the hours you record? Would love to know how you guys go about your days. Why don't I pull up the bankless calendar, David, and see if there are any hours that you are not recording this week? Because I think you might be recording during more daytime hours than you're not recording, sir?
01:27:09.996 - 01:27:15.480, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. This week was special. I did a lot of podcasts this week.
01:27:16.010 - 01:27:19.020, Speaker A: Well, why don't you answer when you're not recording? What are you doing?
01:27:19.870 - 01:27:56.370, Speaker B: This week has been so far. Wake up at like seven in the morning and then kind of clock out at like 07:00 p.m. Go get dinner and then come back and write a little bit more for like an hour. This week has been only bank. That's been kind of insane. What is it like? Normally it's that wake up at seven, maybe I clock out at like five, go to the gym, go get a dinner with a friend, and then I come back and start writing more. I don't necessarily think that I have a healthy work lifestyle.
01:27:56.790 - 01:28:16.282, Speaker A: See how fun this is, guys, this is crypto. Well, look, man, when it's get a job in crypto, guys, it's also your job. It's kind of hard to separate. I mean, I have a similar schedule to you. I wake up at like 637 30. I spend some time with the family. I have kids, I have a puppy, a dog.
01:28:16.282 - 01:28:36.334, Speaker A: I do all of my family stuff. And then I get into bankless. I'm usually like trying to catch up on what happened the previous day is sort of where my day starts. So that's like email, twitter, discord, telegram, like digesting massive amounts of information and data and sorting it, putting it in different places.
01:28:36.462 - 01:28:42.690, Speaker B: I do all those same steps, except I skip email. But then I get discord messages from Ryan saying, see email, see email.
01:28:42.760 - 01:29:08.426, Speaker A: Or I will literally screenshot David an email, force me to check my email. Show this to you. Here you go. And as I just described it, like information sorting. I'm like, oh, my God, am I an AI? That was like, is this what I do? I digest information. Anyway, I do that for a while and then, man, we have so much going on at bankless. If it's not the podcast, it's looking at the newsletter, trying to improve the product.
01:29:08.426 - 01:29:15.614, Speaker A: We're launching a new website. We've got some other initiatives, some member initiatives that we're doing, and we have a team of.
01:29:15.652 - 01:29:21.022, Speaker B: Hang on, we have to stop talking about bankless. Fuma says, would love to know what you guys do.
01:29:21.076 - 01:29:23.662, Speaker A: Oh, my God, I misread it. Outside your work hours?
01:29:23.716 - 01:29:27.060, Speaker B: Yeah, outside of work hours, not how we work.
01:29:27.510 - 01:29:46.886, Speaker A: This is outside of the hours you record. So I was getting to the other non recording hours. Okay, I guess. Okay. So in terms of hobies and such, my hobby is also crypto and defi and philosophy and economics and history. And all of the things that crypto touches. So it's all kind of one and the same, I guess.
01:29:46.886 - 01:29:56.634, Speaker A: I love to read books. I'm reading a book on kind of. You know, there's a new Christopher Nolan movie coming out called Oppenheimer. Are you a Christopher Nolan fan, by the way?
01:29:56.672 - 01:29:57.434, Speaker B: Yeah, certainly.
01:29:57.552 - 01:30:04.730, Speaker A: We talked about this. Okay, so Oppenheimer is coming out, and I just recently started reading a book called the making of the Atomic Bomb.
01:30:04.810 - 01:30:05.920, Speaker B: That sounds great.
01:30:06.370 - 01:30:09.374, Speaker A: It is great, David, are you making fun of.
01:30:09.492 - 01:30:19.262, Speaker B: No, no. That's a really interesting. The United States, we kicked Germany's ass, and then we stole all their rocket scientists, and then we started making rockets.
01:30:19.326 - 01:30:43.986, Speaker A: And the book starts before that. It starts with kind of the scientists who actually discovered the physical property of a thing that hypothetically existed but they didn't actually know existed, called the atom. The freaking atom. And once you discovered that existed, then everyone's like, well, what do we do with it? And some brilliant scientists were like, we can harness the energy of the sun from this thing, both for good. It's just fascinating. And so it's all of these science.
01:30:44.018 - 01:30:48.310, Speaker B: Imagine saying that line in, like, the late 40s. We can harness the energy of the sun.
01:30:48.460 - 01:30:59.200, Speaker A: Look, it's the atomic era for reason. Anyway, I do stuff like this. I go on historical tangents. I listen to podcasts, spend time with my family. That's my life, man.
01:30:59.890 - 01:31:02.398, Speaker B: You used to have exercise on your calendar in the morning, right?
01:31:02.484 - 01:31:04.382, Speaker A: I used to. I haven't gotten to it, man.
01:31:04.436 - 01:31:09.840, Speaker B: Yeah, since coming back from ECC, I've actually gotten into it.
01:31:10.470 - 01:31:11.214, Speaker A: Are you lifting?
01:31:11.262 - 01:31:12.658, Speaker B: I got some sore glutes right now.
01:31:12.744 - 01:31:21.302, Speaker A: You know, I used to totally. Yeah, you're a big deadlifter. Heavy as. But, like. Yeah. I have not lifted in like two years. It's been bad.
01:31:21.302 - 01:31:24.326, Speaker A: I need to get back into this bank. Yeah. I need to do this.
01:31:24.428 - 01:31:43.046, Speaker B: Okay. I also need to redeem myself because I said made it seem like I eat food and do bank stuff, and sometimes I skip the food stuff. I thoroughly enjoy rock climbing, so there's a rock climbing gym not too far away, so I'm often there. Also, big, big smoked salmon. I don't know. I was going to say smoker.
01:31:43.078 - 01:31:43.674, Speaker A: I didn't know that.
01:31:43.712 - 01:31:53.366, Speaker B: But that doesn't land so well. No, I smoke some real good salmon, Ryan. Really? You have never had my smoked salmon. But, yeah, you can ask my San Diego friends, the alfalfa boys.
01:31:53.498 - 01:31:57.154, Speaker A: Can you smoke that? This might be a super noob question.
01:31:57.192 - 01:32:21.378, Speaker B: Like, in your apartment, you cannot smoke stuff. Yeah, so this is back in San Diego. So I've got this fire escape, and you are not supposed to put things on your fire escape at all. But it's right next to my window. And so I'm thinking about getting one of these green eggs because they come in various sizes. Famous green egg smokers get the medium size and just, like, carry it through the window.
01:32:21.474 - 01:32:31.366, Speaker A: Just share some with the rest of the apartment and no one will complain. It'll be fine. All right. We still have one more question, man. Okay, very important question. Is bankless doing a merge watch party? And how do I get an invite?
01:32:31.558 - 01:32:50.126, Speaker B: We are going to be a part of a merge watch party. We will not be hosting the merge watch party. The actual merge watch party will be done by the Ethereum foundation. On the Ethereum Foundation, YouTube. And me and Ryan will be there, or at least I will, but it will be the Gorely testnet that we will be hosting a watch party. Hosting a watch party.
01:32:50.158 - 01:33:01.270, Speaker A: Did you just say? At least I will. Dude, I'm not missing the merge live event. You kidding me? Virtual, right? I don't have to appear in person. You know I'm going to be there.
01:33:01.340 - 01:33:03.800, Speaker B: Yeah, you can pre record yourself and put it.
01:33:04.250 - 01:33:22.122, Speaker A: Guys, that's gonna be really exciting. How do I get an invite? Invite will be available. Everyone on YouTube, the entire crypto community comes. This is the biggest event in crypto, I think since the launch of Ethereum. Before that, it's probably the launch of bitcoin. This is like the third biggest event to ever happen in crypto. Are we overhyping this, sir? Let's get to take.
01:33:22.176 - 01:33:26.090, Speaker B: No, it's the biggest underhyping. It's the biggest event in crypto since the launch of Ethereum.
01:33:26.250 - 01:33:27.962, Speaker A: What's this take from? Cronk?
01:33:28.106 - 01:33:41.838, Speaker B: Cronk CT sentiment, crypto, Twitter sentiment. In November 2021, we're all going to be billionaires in this super cycle. July 2022, Germans will have to eat their own cats this winter to survive. Oh, wow. That was dark.
01:33:41.934 - 01:33:46.318, Speaker A: It's a little dark, but, you know, crypto sentiment runs real hot and then real cold.
01:33:46.494 - 01:33:49.650, Speaker B: Yeah, right. And it's been real counter tradable.
01:33:49.730 - 01:34:05.046, Speaker A: Question mark. Good question. Sometimes you got a hot take, though. How about I read this hot take from David Hoffman? Number one, the 2017 bull market was Ethereum driven explanation. Bitcoin had its own story, but it was the ICo mania at the center stage.
01:34:05.158 - 01:34:07.354, Speaker B: That wasn't the hard take. That was the lead up to the heart take.
01:34:07.392 - 01:34:23.162, Speaker A: That was the lead up. Okay, we're still building number two. The 2020 to 2021 bull market was clearly Ethereum driven. DFI, NFTs, gaming number three. The next bull market will be three. Three bull markets.
01:34:23.226 - 01:34:23.998, Speaker B: Three out of three.
01:34:24.084 - 01:34:30.894, Speaker A: Three out of three bull markets led by Ethereum. The bottom line, Ethereum leads rocket, send that tweet to the moon.
01:34:31.022 - 01:34:37.786, Speaker B: We're not done yet. We're not done yet. Wait, that was not the hot take. We got two more takes. Three for one package.
01:34:37.838 - 01:34:56.534, Speaker A: Sorry, I'm ruining David's incredibly hot take here. The third Ethereum bull market will be a fees based bull market. The merch will allow Ethereum fees to actually move Eth price. Uniswap, synthetix, MKR, and all the fee commanding tokens will also lead. The next bull market is based on fees. The third tweet.
01:34:56.582 - 01:34:58.314, Speaker B: Here's the hot take. Here's a hot take.
01:34:58.352 - 01:35:17.330, Speaker A: We're just building. Okay, now, you ready for it? Yeah. Bitcoin's unsustainable security budget is actually not going to be an issue for like, 20 years. As ETH goes through, a 20 year bull market helps support bitcoin price along the way. There. That was the hot take. You actually said that in the tweet.
01:35:17.330 - 01:35:26.574, Speaker A: All right, so it ended with, basically the son grows up and supports the father.
01:35:26.702 - 01:35:37.880, Speaker B: Yes. What's that meme of the Mutant Ninja Turtles who are, like, being taught by the dojo person and then the dojo person personnel, and then the mutant Ninja Turtles are super strong.
01:35:38.650 - 01:35:46.810, Speaker A: You know, the Star Trek meme? I see the Star Trek meme of like, are we friends? And the one Star Trek guys goes, no, while the others saying, yes. At the same time.
01:35:46.960 - 01:35:48.854, Speaker B: I've been kind of mean to bitcoin in this episode.
01:35:48.902 - 01:35:52.220, Speaker A: That's a bitcoin saying, no, we're not friends. And Ethereum saying, yes, we are.
01:35:52.590 - 01:36:10.270, Speaker B: Okay, this isn't a take, but I thought this was pretty cool, so I just put it in here. This is Tim Baco. He goes, first time here. Here being the Seattle, Washington NFT museum. And I'm impressed. Beyond the art, the museum also has a main net miner and proof of stake testnet running. So there's this NFT museum in Seattle.
01:36:10.270 - 01:36:35.930, Speaker B: Probably why this has showed up on my radar. Seattle's my hometown. But also what we're seeing on screen here is what that one specifically is like this nano pools mining software. And Ryan, this was like the beginning of the first nine months of my life, was like, staring at this screen, watching my miners mine ether. And if you zoom in, you see these little green words that say unit confirmed and you're like, boo, I got one.
01:36:36.000 - 01:36:36.522, Speaker A: Nice.
01:36:36.656 - 01:36:37.450, Speaker B: Yay.
01:36:37.950 - 01:37:06.494, Speaker A: Wow, what a great date idea. Take your perspective date to the nerd museum in Seattle here at the NFT museum, and watch live proof of stake command line. All right, Vitalik, he had a great update at EtHcc. I watched the video, it's about 45 minutes long. Completely worth it. An update on the Ethereum roadmap. We pulled out two slides here, and I think the big question here, there's much more in his full presentation.
01:37:06.494 - 01:37:45.866, Speaker A: But the big question, I think people have me included, is what percentage of Ethereum are we complete? Right? And so Vitalik has given the line before that the difference between bitcoin and Ethereum is bitcoin is 80% complete and Ethereum is about 40% complete. That's a big difference between the communities. He actually said from his perspective about the Ethereum roadmap that we are 55% complete once we finish the merge. So just over halfway complete, I want to ask you, David, so first of all, that number, 55%, does that feel about right to you? What would you have said about completion?
01:37:45.978 - 01:38:37.730, Speaker B: And so when we did our roadmap episode with Vitalik, he talked about there's all this extra stuff that there's a chance that we just don't have the time to get it into ethereum before this thing settles. And his talk at ECC is about Ethereum settling down, saying, like, we're about to go through this period of rapid change with the merge. After that, we need to let things stabilize. But there's a lot of things in the Ethereum roadmap that are kind of far out there, and we might not actually get to it before we accidentally unlearn how to coordinate, which is a feature, not a bug. Like eventually these things, these blockchains need to calcify. So I think when Vitalik says that post merge, we're at 55% done, he's accounting for if we did absolutely everything on the Ethereum roadmap, and we never really calcified before, we were unable to get some of the last remaining things on. And so I think that's that 55% measurement.
01:38:38.230 - 01:38:47.106, Speaker A: What are we looking at here? Because this chart, I think, tells a story here and describe the axis for us and the shape of this line here.
01:38:47.208 - 01:39:11.322, Speaker B: Yeah, so we're seeing an s curve, right. And the vertical axis is the capability of the system. So as we go higher, the capability goes up, and then the horizontal axis is, of course, time. And then we have this, we are here and where we are is like, right before the steepest part of the s. So we are on. What Vitalik is saying is, with the merge, we are on the cusp of the period of the most rapid change.
01:39:11.456 - 01:39:13.230, Speaker A: A lot of things are going to increase capability.
01:39:13.730 - 01:39:35.278, Speaker B: Yes. And increasing capability like. Yes. Blockchains aren't necessarily supposed to go through rapid change. So this is a compromise that we're making because we know that we can make a more performant system, higher capabilities, of course. But then what he's saying is like, okay, we're about to go through the merge, and that's going to change a bunch of things. After that, we need to chill.
01:39:35.278 - 01:39:45.810, Speaker B: We need to let things steep a little bit. We can focus on some other things other than the protocol. Also, the developers need to break. So we're going to go through this period of rapid change, and then we're going to chill.
01:39:45.890 - 01:40:03.674, Speaker A: But he's also saying that over time, you know, big criticism of Ethereum is it's always changing. That's only the case right now. It is eventually, the s curve kind of curves down, and it stops. It ossifies to a certain level of capability. And even in this chart, not the.
01:40:03.712 - 01:40:27.146, Speaker B: X curve, not the same s curve, the curve of the complexity of the system. So the chart that we were talking about previously was the capability. And then this next chart that we're now going to look at is the complexity of the system. And so we are here is, we are right up to the point of maximum complexity. We're about to go into maximum complexity. And so what Vitalik's saying is once we get to that point of maximum complexity, we should start becoming less complex.
01:40:27.198 - 01:40:31.618, Speaker A: Not more removing things, removing extraneous things. He actually gives examples.
01:40:31.714 - 01:40:35.110, Speaker B: The purge in the whole, like, purge, purge, merge, whatever thing.
01:40:35.180 - 01:40:38.146, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Purge. The great purge. The great Ethereum purge.
01:40:38.178 - 01:40:39.746, Speaker B: I'm here for it, David.
01:40:39.858 - 01:40:42.486, Speaker A: Those are the takes. What are you bullish on this week, Ryan?
01:40:42.518 - 01:40:44.874, Speaker B: You know how I recorded a bunch of podcasts this.
01:40:44.992 - 01:40:46.858, Speaker A: Yes. Yes, I do.
01:40:46.944 - 01:40:49.386, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm bullish on all the podcasts I record.
01:40:49.568 - 01:40:52.426, Speaker A: What's your favorite? You have to just name one that you.
01:40:52.528 - 01:40:54.138, Speaker B: I have three. I have three.
01:40:54.304 - 01:40:55.754, Speaker A: What are your three favorites?
01:40:55.882 - 01:40:59.114, Speaker B: So you know the cypherpunk t shirts that we made out of the bankless dow?
01:40:59.162 - 01:40:59.822, Speaker A: Oh, yeah.
01:40:59.956 - 01:41:30.790, Speaker B: I interviewed one of the names that's on the cypherpunk shirt. David Chom. David Chom coming on the podcast. So that was just an honor. This crypto industry stands on the shoulders of giants, and I got to interview one so that's coming out. I also did the Food podcast, the food podcast I've been talking about. Not what you expect, but the cool thing about it is we use very similar words like antifragility and the decentralization of our food supply.
01:41:31.530 - 01:41:33.754, Speaker A: Did you crypto pill this nutritionist, or was he.
01:41:33.792 - 01:41:34.806, Speaker B: He's already crypto pilled.
01:41:34.838 - 01:41:35.290, Speaker A: Oh, really?
01:41:35.360 - 01:41:44.766, Speaker B: Yeah, he's already crypto pilled. So he leaned into this with me and he's like, we have a debt to pay to our soil because we have not been reintroducing nutrients back into.
01:41:44.788 - 01:41:46.250, Speaker A: Our pay to our soil.
01:41:46.330 - 01:42:05.486, Speaker B: Yes, dude, we've had fiat soil this whole time. We've had fiat soil, and now we need to change our, because we have been borrowing and pulling out nutrients from our soil, leaving it empty, and we need to put nutrients back into it. We need to start saving nutrients more than we are borrowing nutrients.
01:42:05.518 - 01:42:08.706, Speaker A: This is some saffadine amuse type level stuff here, David.
01:42:08.738 - 01:42:43.866, Speaker B: Dude, it was really, really. No, but it's really, really good. Saffron amuse is like, he's acceptable, the best, but we have to have this soft landing, if you will, of how we change the way we produce our food, or else if we don't, we're going to overreach and then crash. These are the same principles of decentralization, anti fragility, like savings and debt, but we apply all of these same words that we've been using in crypto to this food crisis that's coming. It's one thing when we have a crisis in financial markets, Ryan, because we can just kind of print money. You can't print food. What happens as a result of that is people starve.
01:42:43.866 - 01:42:55.186, Speaker B: And so it's a really good podcast from a content perspective. But Ryan, it's also one of the, I think one of the most important podcasts that I've ever created because of how important this information is.
01:42:55.288 - 01:42:57.954, Speaker A: You have my attention, sir. I will be listening to this one.
01:42:58.072 - 01:43:14.050, Speaker B: Please listen. And number three is all the ECC videos of the ECC interview with Vitalik, 30 minutes long. That's out. Kane Warwick is out. I talked to Cain about, I think I teased this last week. I talked to Cain about his fight with Suzu. Just talked a bunch of.
01:43:14.140 - 01:43:30.046, Speaker A: A lot of this content, by the way, is coming on YouTube. All right. But special thing for people listening to the podcast, primarily, we are doing a massive content dump on Saturday where we're releasing all. Is it seven or eight of these ECC episodes? Eight. All at once.
01:43:30.148 - 01:43:36.094, Speaker B: All at once. That's just a fun 8 hours, but broken up into eight different episodes. So you can pick and choose as you see fit.
01:43:36.132 - 01:43:42.670, Speaker A: Yeah, get the full eth experiment. Right. So you could listen to six out of eight, or listen all eight. Listen to all eight twice.
01:43:42.830 - 01:43:52.694, Speaker B: Definitely listen. All reduced went from 6 minutes down to like less than 2 minutes. So you're welcome. Ryan, what are you bullish on?
01:43:52.812 - 01:44:48.742, Speaker A: What am I bullish on? You know what? DefI tokens. Okay, so the Hasu podcast that we are releasing on Monday, the theme of that episode was supposed to be how we fix DFI tokens, but the actual content was a bit more bearish and turned into a question of, can we fix DFI tokens? And the truth is, Hasu wasn't 100% sold that we could. And yet, as we had this discussion about all of the flaws with DFI token accrual mechanisms right now, and the regulatory landscape that exists, the difficulties, by the end of that episode, David, I was more bullish, because I see these, all of the difficulties that we outlined, though they are large, are also. It's. These are problems that can be solved.
01:44:48.886 - 01:44:51.350, Speaker B: We've solved them before in humanity.
01:44:51.430 - 01:45:07.742, Speaker A: Exactly. And so I left that episode more bullish on DFI tokens, particularly at their current values. When you see like, uniswap, we were talking about that case, how much money it's printing. David, I was just running the math, and $78 million a day, is that what it was?
01:45:07.796 - 01:45:09.758, Speaker B: Something like 7.8.
01:45:09.924 - 01:45:11.134, Speaker A: What was it per day?
01:45:11.172 - 01:45:12.714, Speaker B: $7.8 million a day.
01:45:12.772 - 01:45:26.694, Speaker A: $7.8 million a day. So what is that? $7.8 million? 400. And wait, 46, 50 million a year is what that amounts to. Is that it?
01:45:26.732 - 01:45:29.430, Speaker B: No, it's 2.9 billion.
01:45:29.850 - 01:45:32.360, Speaker A: 2.9 billion a year.
01:45:33.770 - 01:45:38.214, Speaker B: 7.8 times three. Six five is 2.85.
01:45:38.332 - 01:45:52.960, Speaker A: Yes, of course. Yes, sorry, I was multiplying that only by six, not 365. $2.8 billion. I don't know why the six was in my calculator instead. Proof of humanity right here. I can't calculate everything.
01:45:52.960 - 01:46:20.134, Speaker A: So $2.8 billion, and that's just one protocol. And anyway, I am bullish on DFI tokens of the future. I think the problems ahead of us from a governance perspective are completely solvable. I think regulatory is an issue. It's an obstacle, actually. The constraints that regulatory have given us, I mean, we're growing in a different way, in a different direction, and they're okay, and they will also be removed over time.
01:46:20.134 - 01:46:23.490, Speaker A: So DFI tokens is the thing I'm bullish on David.
01:46:23.650 - 01:46:49.978, Speaker B: I will have to say that the fees collected by Uniswap, $2.8 billion of fees, are fees that are paid to liquidity providers, and you have to pay them. So I think Uniswap fairly might get 5% of those fees if it took a five. Oh, that's a pretty steep charge, but let's run that number. $140,000,000 a year in revenue for Uniswap. If Uniswap took a 5% cut on the 0.3% average trading fees of Uniswap Lps.
01:46:50.074 - 01:46:54.558, Speaker A: 142,000,000 a year. And what's the cost of that? Like, very low.
01:46:54.724 - 01:46:55.598, Speaker B: A couple of million.
01:46:55.684 - 01:47:00.514, Speaker A: Right. So it's kind of close to profit at that level. Really cool.
01:47:00.552 - 01:47:01.854, Speaker B: I am similarly bullish.
01:47:01.902 - 01:47:02.820, Speaker A: Meme of the week.
01:47:04.470 - 01:47:08.722, Speaker B: We can fix defi tokens by fixing Dow governance. Got to fix Dow governance.
01:47:08.866 - 01:47:14.742, Speaker A: True, true. That's the topic of Monday's podcast. David, meme of the week. What are we looking at?
01:47:14.796 - 01:47:29.306, Speaker B: The week. Here we go. So this is the famous friends meme, where Phoebe and Joey are. Phoebe's trying to get Joey to say the words. And so Phoebe goes re and Joey goes re. And Phoebe goes se. And Joey goes se.
01:47:29.306 - 01:47:36.202, Speaker B: And then Phoebe goes Eshin. And Joey goes Eshin. And Phoebe goes recession. And then Joey goes risk on season.
01:47:36.346 - 01:47:40.030, Speaker A: Yeah. That's awesome. Yep.
01:47:40.530 - 01:47:42.350, Speaker B: Which one are you positioned for, Ryan?
01:47:42.790 - 01:47:51.138, Speaker A: I am positioned for both. Surprise. Phoebe and Joey. I got both sides. That's the crypto Barbell strategy, my friend.
01:47:51.224 - 01:47:51.966, Speaker B: Recession.
01:47:52.078 - 01:48:06.534, Speaker A: The crypto barbell strategies. All weather. Okay. That means you have cash on one side, you have crypto on the other side. You get the maximum risk on. And then you also have the safe haven risk off and nothing in the middle. That's me.
01:48:06.652 - 01:48:09.506, Speaker B: That's a good meme. This is one of the better memes you've had. Nice meme.
01:48:09.538 - 01:48:09.686, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:48:09.708 - 01:48:14.042, Speaker B: Who did this nice meme? Some intern that works with Haska trades, whoever that is.
01:48:14.096 - 01:48:24.106, Speaker A: Cool. Up and coming meme. More talent here, guys. As always, crypto is risky. None of this has been financial advice. Never is. On bankless, you could definitely lose what you put in.
01:48:24.106 - 01:48:30.126, Speaker A: But we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone. But we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
