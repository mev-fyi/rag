00:00:00.170 - 00:00:02.670, Speaker A: What's holding treasure and GameFi in general.
00:00:02.740 - 00:00:41.730, Speaker B: Back to me, one of gameify's biggest problems is gameify itself. People really want to play games on the blockchain. The only issue that you have, the way to play them is to purchase tokens and participate on this strange economic loops. To achieve mass adoption we need a game that is like a hybrid that has the benefits of blockchain but that has the technology that allows it to be a fun game. You need to have a game that's to some degree centralized. And yeah, I think that that's one of the things that's going to drive adoption. If you want to appeal to the web two crowd, give them what they want, which is to have fun, right? And if you show them the benefits of web three, they will inevitably keep on using the technology the way I sort of envision it that people will be using blockchain in games without realizing that they're using blockchain in games the same way that we don't realize many of the technologies that we use nowadays.
