00:00:00.250 - 00:00:00.986, Speaker A: Newstime, David.
00:00:01.018 - 00:00:01.422, Speaker B: Oh, boy.
00:00:01.476 - 00:00:02.542, Speaker A: Are we ready to get into this?
00:00:02.596 - 00:00:05.278, Speaker B: Here we go. This is gonna be a mess. Let's do it.
00:00:05.364 - 00:00:07.374, Speaker A: What do we even talk about? What do we even call this?
00:00:07.412 - 00:00:08.640, Speaker B: How do we even start?
00:00:11.330 - 00:00:15.690, Speaker A: Hey, guys. It's the fourth week of January, David. What time is it, Ryan?
00:00:15.770 - 00:00:30.902, Speaker B: It's a Friday weekly roll up where we roll up the entire week in crypto, which is always an ambitious endeavor, especially this week. Some. Some drama has gone on this week, so we're going to cover all of that and more because it's the Friday bankless weekly roll up.
00:00:30.956 - 00:00:46.378, Speaker A: I don't know where to start with this roll up, David, but I think it's got to be somewhere with Bear market. Okay. Because we've been feeling some bear market vibes after we hit the stop record button after the last podcast, something happened in the market. We're going to discuss it. It was not good. It was down. Only it felt like it was the.
00:00:46.384 - 00:00:48.282, Speaker B: Biggest oof we've seen thus far.
00:00:48.416 - 00:01:00.778, Speaker A: Yes. Stacked oofs. Massive raises as well. That's still happening. So we'll talk about that. Ark Investments, Kathy woods firm has been on the podcast. She just put out some insane price targets for bitcoin and eth.
00:01:00.778 - 00:01:02.910, Speaker A: I guess they're not bullish. We'll talk about that report.
00:01:03.060 - 00:01:04.606, Speaker B: They are bearish. They are very bullish.
00:01:04.718 - 00:01:13.198, Speaker A: Yes. Excuse me. They are not bearish. They are very bullish. Hayden Adams got canceled by his bank. Is Hayden Adams going bankless?
00:01:13.294 - 00:01:15.358, Speaker B: We'll talk about that banklessness.
00:01:15.534 - 00:01:35.354, Speaker A: And what about this last one? This is some of the drama you were alluding to. So, man, a lot of different names here. Blast from the past. Quadriga was a canadian exchange. Apparently, the co founder of the shady exchange popped up on the radar. He's a multi SiG manager for some pretty large defi projects. Who knew? We got to discuss that as well.
00:01:35.472 - 00:01:54.698, Speaker B: An ex convicted felon for identity theft is now discovered as the Anon multi Sig signer for the Wonderland project. And a lot of drama is currently unfolding as Ryan and I were prepping this agenda. So we're going to do our best to unpack all of that story. It's some drama.
00:01:54.874 - 00:02:13.926, Speaker A: This is crypto, right? It's like Bear bull markets changing the world. All this amazing thing, people making money, and then we've got, like, just entertainment shenanigans. Some people are here for the money. Some people are here for the tech. Some people are here for the political change. Some people are just here for, like, the popcorn and entertainment, man. Because that happens on a weekly basis as well.
00:02:13.926 - 00:02:15.382, Speaker A: And I feel like it's one of those weeks, too.
00:02:15.436 - 00:02:21.798, Speaker B: Yeah. So definitely grab your coffee because we have a lot to go through. And if it's for some reason in the evening time for you, also grab the popcorn because it's going to be.
00:02:21.804 - 00:02:46.522, Speaker A: One of those coffee and popcorn bowl. All right, we got to start here, David, because, you know, the last couple of roll ups, we've been talking about tax optimization stuff, and I caught this from Odell Beckham, Jr. You know who that is, Ryan? He's one of my favorite athletes. As you know, David, he plays sports. Okay. He plays sports. Well, he started getting his sports paycheck in bitcoin.
00:02:46.522 - 00:03:03.014, Speaker A: I think this happened last year, maybe the year before. Anyway, here is a tweet from an article. On November twelveth, Odell Beckham Jr. Signed a deal with the Rams worth 750k. Nice. He announced he would take that in bitcoin. At that time, bitcoin was worth $64,000.
00:03:03.014 - 00:03:11.946, Speaker A: Today it's worth $35,000. Today, that deal is worth $412,000. That's where things get interesting.
00:03:12.048 - 00:03:17.594, Speaker B: So he lost 50% because bitcoin went down, but holders are holders. Bitcoiners are bitcoiners still.
00:03:17.632 - 00:03:41.170, Speaker A: Okay, one bitcoin equals one bitcoin. But here's the problem. Okay, taxes come in, David. Odell will be taxed on the federal and California state tax is about 50%. So that means net, Odell has only made thirty five thousand k, or thirty five k, excuse me, from the Rams contract this year.
00:03:41.240 - 00:03:53.330, Speaker B: So he signed a deal for three quarters of a million dollars. And his net on that is going to be $35,000 because Ryan, you know what he didn't do? He did not optimize his taxes.
00:03:53.410 - 00:04:26.418, Speaker A: He did not optimize his taxes, David. That's why we talk about this. And you know what? I'm just going to fit this in, because crypto Ira is something that I think people need to have. And this wouldn't have worked for Adele Jr's case, but this could work if you are a retail investor, because it is a tax free account, tax deferred until you retire. So any trades in and out, any income you receive to this account, any staking, anything like that, is tax free. You don't have to pay it. And I've set this up a couple of years ago.
00:04:26.418 - 00:04:51.254, Speaker A: It was a lot harder back then. But crypto Ira, Alto Ira has created an easy button for this. So I encourage everyone listening as sort of a tax optimizer reminder, don't be like Odell Beckham, okay? Figure out your taxes. This is one step you can take. It's one small step you can take. Open up a crypto IRA, start depositing. Roll over a previous 401k, start depositing.
00:04:51.254 - 00:05:03.470, Speaker A: Turn that into crypto, and you don't have to worry about this. You don't have to pay taxes. You could find out more@altoira.com bankless. And check that out. There you go. Tax lesson for the day.
00:05:03.540 - 00:05:08.810, Speaker B: Yeah. Don't lose 95% of your paycheck to depreciating crypto and taxes.
00:05:08.890 - 00:05:18.114, Speaker A: That's such a bummer, man. Sorry, Odell. I'm sorry that happened. Sorry, guy. Let's talk about markets, though, David. This is the sad music bear territory. We are down.
00:05:18.114 - 00:05:20.082, Speaker A: Down. What's bitcoin showing us?
00:05:20.136 - 00:05:35.160, Speaker B: Bitcoin started the week at $43,000 and has gone down 12%. Hit a low of $33,500. So almost down a whole $10,000, and it's currently at the price of $36,200.
00:05:37.130 - 00:05:38.914, Speaker A: It gets worse. It gets worse, Ether.
00:05:38.962 - 00:06:01.050, Speaker B: It gets worse, Ether. The start of the week at $3,250 hit a low of $220, down a full $1,000 on the week. We are currently clocking in at $2,450, down a massive 20% on the week. Rut row. Rut row.
00:06:01.210 - 00:06:18.998, Speaker A: We'll take a look at that from all time highs in just a minute here, too. So bad going down. People feeling bearish. I think a lot of people have started capitulating and saying that this is a bear market. Maybe we should define that in a little bit. But before we do, let's talk about a few more numbers here. Eth bitcoin ratio is going down as well.
00:06:18.998 - 00:06:20.102, Speaker A: What happened this week?
00:06:20.156 - 00:06:30.166, Speaker B: Yeah, when markets go down, the ETH BTC ratio goes down. We started the week at zero 75. We are currently at zero 67. So down a pretty significant chunk on.
00:06:30.188 - 00:06:35.866, Speaker A: The seven day bear market indicator as well. And the bed index, that's got to be a story of down as well. Yeah.
00:06:35.888 - 00:06:46.606, Speaker B: Start of the week at $123. Currently clocking in at $98. Oh, wow. It's up from when I wrote down these notes, but still down 13.6% on the week.
00:06:46.788 - 00:07:04.418, Speaker A: Not as down bad as ETH is, but still down on the week. So let's talk about this. I put out this Twitter survey. Are we in a bear market? Now, 60% of those answered said yes, 40% said no. What do you think, David? Are we in a bear market?
00:07:04.504 - 00:07:17.426, Speaker B: I don't actually think people are allowed to. According to markets. Right. Markets determine whether we're in bear markets, not Twitter polls. But sometimes it doesn't really matter. Just sentiment is like when people are feeling bearish. Bearishness kind of begets bearishness.
00:07:17.426 - 00:07:33.600, Speaker B: Right. So now that we've been talking about being bearish on this podcast for the last 5 minutes, everyone else is probably feeling really down and bearish. These are how market psychologies kind of work. So bear market. It's a vibe. It's a feeling. Do you feel like we're in a bear market?
00:07:34.130 - 00:07:38.782, Speaker A: I actually don't. You don't feel like we're in a bear market?
00:07:38.836 - 00:07:43.866, Speaker B: We're up on the year. We're up on 365 days by a lot. By like two.
00:07:43.988 - 00:08:02.262, Speaker A: Okay. Not up since January. Yes, definitely. It depends on your holding horizon, doesn't it? Do you remember back in the days of $80 eth? Yes. Wasn't that long ago, still less than two years ago that was going on. Really? Yeah.
00:08:02.396 - 00:08:05.000, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. $80 in March 2020.
00:08:05.610 - 00:08:06.358, Speaker A: Do you remember?
00:08:06.444 - 00:08:06.838, Speaker B: Right.
00:08:06.924 - 00:08:07.830, Speaker A: Less than two years.
00:08:07.900 - 00:08:12.698, Speaker B: Also March 2019, also March 2018, hit $80, like three times.
00:08:12.864 - 00:08:44.594, Speaker A: But so I think we've said before under three K EtH, we're not feeling great in general. So this is not feeling great. The question is, how long does this last and how low do we go? Right. That, to me, is kind of the definition of a bear. It's like sentiment on Twitter, just changes on a dime. But the question is, is this another crypto winter or are we going to come out of this? Arthur Hayes, founder CEO of Bitmax, actually wrote a great post, and he's a trader, but has, I think, some insight into this sort of thing that we can glean. You could read the entire post.
00:08:44.594 - 00:09:35.314, Speaker A: It's a link in the show notes, but he talks about resistance levels of 28 500 bitcoin price for ETH and 1700, sorry, 28,500 for bitcoin and 1700 for ETH. And he says, I don't believe in the bottom until these levels are retested. If the levels hold, amazing this prong has been met. If it doesn't, then I believe a mega liquidation candle will happen in the for bitcoin and the 1300 to 1700 range for ether. And then he goes on to say, if we breach the previous all time highs, which were 20k for bitcoin and 1400 for ether, respectively, he doesn't even want to think about it. So that's like a worst case scenario. Then it's like down, down.
00:09:35.314 - 00:09:44.870, Speaker A: But he feels like we're going to test resistance at these levels. 1700 for ETH, 2800 for bitcoin, before all of a sudden done. What's your take on this?
00:09:44.940 - 00:09:47.320, Speaker B: Oh, I also don't want to think about it. Can we move on?
00:09:50.010 - 00:09:54.026, Speaker A: Well, what do you think? Do you think this happens? How long is this going to last?
00:09:54.208 - 00:10:25.690, Speaker B: There's a sentiment that I've had where bear markets are. When you see the market coming to a decision point, and it just always goes down. And we've kind of seen that happen, like, three times over the last three, four weeks, it's like, oh, and it goes down, and it goes down. But we're also just following macro. The difference between this bear market. Bear market is downtrend versus the last one is like, the last one. Ether went from, like, $6 up to $1,400 on this fake ico phenomenon.
00:10:25.690 - 00:10:44.794, Speaker B: Meanwhile, what's happening right now is that the Federal Reserve, which is completely exogenous to crypto, is raising interest rates and doing quantitative tightening. And so it's less. Not to say that crypto prices didn't get out over their ski tips. They were pretty high. $4,800. Ether, pretty high. Like $69,000.
00:10:44.794 - 00:11:08.526, Speaker B: Bitcoin. Nice. Also pretty high, but that kind of felt much more real. Crypto feels much more real this time. And now this market pullback is simply just because the Federal Reserve is making the price of money higher. And so it's really a function of we are tied to macro, and as soon as the S and P stops going down, crypto will stop going down, probably knock on wood.
00:11:08.638 - 00:11:27.770, Speaker A: Different flavor, different flavor of why down 2018? Yeah, I've got to take on that later. We'll say that till the end. But a few other things. The carnage this week, the top ten coins down by percentage from all time high. I always think these numbers are interesting. Doge is down 83% from its all time high. These are sorted in order.
00:11:27.770 - 00:11:46.798, Speaker A: Shib token, another dog token, down 77%. Cardano, down 67%. Salana, 65%. Avax, that's avalanche, 61%. ETH in the middle of the pack, 52% down from all time high. Bitcoin, 50%. Finance, 49%.
00:11:46.798 - 00:12:07.134, Speaker A: Maddox, 47%. Luna, 41%. So it's quite a spread. Yet the coins you'd expect, like ether and bitcoin, they're kind of in the middle of the pack. You'd expect them to be least down from all time high. And actually, Maddok and Luna and finance are the least down from all time high. So I think that's interesting.
00:12:07.134 - 00:12:09.110, Speaker A: To track as we get into the bear market.
00:12:09.260 - 00:12:12.566, Speaker B: Only 50% down. Only 50%.
00:12:12.668 - 00:12:18.094, Speaker A: Oh, there's a silver lining, David. 50%. We've seen that before in previous dips.
00:12:18.162 - 00:12:29.100, Speaker B: The typical average crypto dip is somewhere between 20 and 40%, and this dip is significantly higher than that. But also, we've seen 50% pullbacks before.
00:12:29.550 - 00:12:33.406, Speaker A: For bitcoin, David, for bitcoin. Four times in the last four years.
00:12:33.508 - 00:12:34.254, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:12:34.452 - 00:12:36.030, Speaker A: It's an annual tradition.
00:12:36.370 - 00:12:58.174, Speaker B: We all know crypto is volatile. I think there's plenty of rationale to say that this is just the one big pullback. Granted, bankless is known for being perpetually bullish, and so maybe I have infinite amounts of conviction for crypto, and sometimes that blinds me to short term price movements and lack of willingness to accept.
00:12:58.222 - 00:13:21.722, Speaker A: Just hold through them, though. Who cares? There is actually a silver lining, and I think we were talking about this a little bit, which is like 50% pullback. You get to see who the tourists are and who the settlers are. Right? And the tourists start to get scared. They start to leave. The settlers that know why, they bought with conviction, they're the ones who stay, and it gets a lot less noisy. I think you've got some lessons for you at the end.
00:13:21.722 - 00:13:29.722, Speaker A: We'll share in the take section, but let's look at our friends in the equities world. Stonks, what are we doing here, man? Pretty volatile.
00:13:29.786 - 00:13:57.202, Speaker B: Nasdaq investor sentiment is worse now than it was in March of 2020 during the big liquidation candle back then. And historically, when everyone is like, oh, it's a bear market, it turns around. And so you can see that red line down in the bottom corner. The market sentiment is so in the gutter. And typically, look at how low it was the last time it was this low. It was literally the bottom of the march dip. There was a Covid crash.
00:13:57.202 - 00:14:02.282, Speaker B: The COVID And then it was up only from then on. You know, it's kind of weird that.
00:14:02.336 - 00:14:20.382, Speaker A: All of this much ado given because of Jerome Powell, because of fed intervention, raising rates, just even whispering the raise of rates. This is a stat on the S and P. It had a really bouncy day. I think this was January 24. So a few days ago. What happened that day?
00:14:20.436 - 00:14:52.138, Speaker B: Yeah, so this is the day where bitcoin and ether bottomed, and then also researched just a little bit. And the tweet says the S and P 500 has recovered from an intraday loss of more than 4% only three times. January in October of 2008, and again in October of 2008. Again, I guess the housing crisis. The SP went down negative 4.5% and negative 2.4.2% respectively, and then also, respectively, closed up 4.2%.
00:14:52.138 - 00:15:14.170, Speaker B: So an intraday move of 8% and then 1.2% the next time. And so in January 24, like three days ago, the S and P 500 went down more than 4% and then recovered positively. Had a green day, which is crazy, crazy volatile moves.
00:15:14.330 - 00:15:36.502, Speaker A: Markets don't know what to do at this point. Even stocks up and down don't know where they're going. We'll see how that continues in the future. But let's talk about some happier news, which is Defi metrics still knocking it out of the park. Uniswap just crossed a milestone. They now have greater ETH and stablecoin volume than Coinbase and Binance love it. So it's happening.
00:15:36.502 - 00:16:01.742, Speaker A: Decentralized exchanges are taking on the centralized exchanges. I think that's great news from a big picture perspective. Some other things going on. Phantom is becoming the third largest DeFi protocol by value locked. I consider that sort of a. I mean, it's its own layer one. It's sort of a side chain, very small set pool of validators, but they are onboarding more people to crypto as well.
00:16:01.742 - 00:16:12.290, Speaker A: And some projects surged 52% last week to bring the total value locked to all time highs on Phantom. Any thoughts on that, David?
00:16:12.630 - 00:16:13.246, Speaker B: No thoughts.
00:16:13.278 - 00:16:33.654, Speaker A: Congrats to phantom overtaking binance smart chain, no easy task. Coinbase is listing salana ecosystem tokens as well, and I think this is part of their attempt to just list everything, just be like credibly neutral, and be listing maximalists and not maximalists to any particular chain. Any thoughts on that, David?
00:16:33.702 - 00:16:46.714, Speaker B: Yeah, the hard part about this is that Salana tokens aren't ERC 20 tokens, it's its own standard. And it's easy for Coinbase to just add another ERC 20 token because they already have all the implementations. It's just like add a new contract.
00:16:46.762 - 00:16:50.526, Speaker A: Address, which is similar to anything on the EVM. Like avalanche, for example.
00:16:50.628 - 00:17:09.710, Speaker B: ERC 20 Salana tokens are a different beast because of how they just are a completely different standard than the EVM. So that's why Salana tokens haven't really been able to get on the Coinbase exchange up until now. And Coinbase is now signaling that hey, we're working on getting the Solana tokens onto Coinbase. So really important step for growth for the Solana ecosystem.
00:17:09.870 - 00:17:39.354, Speaker A: Arkinvest has taken a hit from a stock price but they put out this fantastic report, and it was their big insights report, I believe, for 2022, what's going to happen in the future? They are, of course, we talked to Kathy Wood a few months ago, just bullish exponential growth curves, bullish technology in general. And the largest section of their report was actually on crypto. What were a few highlights from that, David, that we should talk about the price targets?
00:17:39.402 - 00:18:07.238, Speaker B: Ryan I think that's the whole. They have a fantastic report that covers so many different things. But of course, since we're in the market section, we want to talk about the price targets of what they predicted, bitcoin and ether. To do so, they say one bitcoin could exceed $1 million by 2030. That is eight years. So according to ARC, what's bitcoin at right now? $33,000. That $33,000 could turn into $1 million by the end of 2030.
00:18:07.324 - 00:18:12.966, Speaker A: If you hold, that's a hopian bankless listeners signed up for when they listen to.
00:18:13.148 - 00:18:48.494, Speaker B: ArC is also saying that Ethereum's market cap could exceed $20 trillion in the next ten years. And so for those that want to do that math, that's 180,000 ether, $180,000 per ether. And these two predictions put bitcoin and ether roughly at comparable market caps. Kathy Wood and Arc says that bitcoin will have a 21 million trillion dollar market cap by 2030. And then they also say that Ethereum will have a 20 trillion market cap in the next ten years. So just two years longer than that. So comparable market prices.
00:18:48.622 - 00:18:55.078, Speaker A: Are they more bullish than us? David, what happened here is that the real flipping couldn't be 20 trillion is a big number.
00:18:55.164 - 00:18:57.910, Speaker B: My price target for ether is infinity. Ryan.
00:18:59.450 - 00:19:09.290, Speaker A: There you go. All right, guys, we will be back with the releases of the week, the hot news items, everything else you come to expect from a roll up. But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:19:09.440 - 00:19:58.294, Speaker B: Polygon is Ethereum's largest and most vibrant scaling solution to date. With millions of monthly users and all of the biggest defi apps, the polygon ecosystem has turned into a blossoming metropolis of defi activity. Transactions on Polygon are quick and cheap, allowing users the freedom to achieve their DeFi goals, all while being economically anchored to Ethereum. But Polygon isn't just the proof of stake sidechain. The Polygon team is building a suite of scaling solutions, including Polygon, Hermes, maiden, nightfall, and Xero, all with different design choices in order to be optimized for all possible crypto use cases. If you're a developer who wants to build on the polygon ecosystem, go to the link in the show notes to check out their fantastic documentation. And if you're a user who just wants to experience fast and cheap DFI, you can bridge over your ETH or other tokens and start playing around with any of the thousands of applications that are available on Polygon.
00:19:58.294 - 00:20:52.262, Speaker B: The layer two era is upon us. Ethereum's layer two ecosystem is growing every day and we need l two bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer two life. Across is the fastest and cheapest and most secure crosschain bridge with across. You don't have to worry about the long wait times or high fees to get your assets back to the layer one assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously. Across's bridges are powered by UMA's optimistic oracle to securely transfer tokens from layer two back to Ethereum, across is critical ecosystem infrastructure and ownership is being handed over to the community. You can be a part of this story of across by joining the discord and becoming a cofounder and helping to design the fair, fair launch of across. If you want to bridge your assets quickly and securely, go to accross to bridge your assets between ETH, optimism, arbitrum or Boba networks living a bankless life requires taking control of your own private keys.
00:20:52.262 - 00:21:35.802, Speaker B: Not your keys, not your crypto. That's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallet. But the ledger ecosystem is much more than just a secure hardware wallet. Ledger is the combination of the Ledger hardware wallet, the Ledger live app, and soon the Clyptolife card powered by Ledger. The CL card powered by Ledger is a crypto debit card with powerful features like an instant exchange to fiat, where crypto assets are only sold at the moment that you swipe your card and also credit from crypto collateral, where you can collateralize your crypto assets in order to get a higher credit limit. You'll be able to manage your CL card powered by Ledger inside the Ledger live app, right next to all the defi apps and services that you're already used to using, making the ledger live app your one stop shop for all of your financial needs. Go to ledger.com,
00:21:35.802 - 00:21:40.442, Speaker B: grab a ledger and download ledger live to get all of your defi applications all in one place.
00:21:40.576 - 00:21:50.266, Speaker A: Alright guys, we are back with releases of the week. David, we have to start here with this release in the midst of the bear market when prices were getting slammed.
00:21:50.298 - 00:21:53.810, Speaker B: If this is the bear market. Martin, we're not in the midst of the bear market, I guess.
00:21:53.960 - 00:22:18.678, Speaker A: Comes ahead the beginning of it. Twitter just released a PFP profile feature to link your NFT to your Twitter profile. Instead of the classic Twitter circle for profile, it would be displayed as a hexagon. So they released this fantastic commercial that we're looking at right here and the feature simultaneously. How big of a deal is this?
00:22:18.844 - 00:22:55.666, Speaker B: It's just lovely to see web two platforms adopt web three stuff. In my mind, I'm a little bit underwhelmed by this, but I'm also just not going to just be a negative nancy and just say, hey, Twitter, nice job for doing NFT verification. There are some kinks that need to be worked around in the sense that I can just take a screenshot of a Jpeg mint that as an NFT, and then boom, I have a hexagon with my fake NFT and it's kind of like a workaround. But then you can talk about verification via openc APIs, stuff like that. It's a great, fantastic first step. People are loving it. People are having a fantastic time.
00:22:55.848 - 00:23:04.390, Speaker A: Not everyone, though. There's been some pushback. Yeah, there's been a little bit. Like if I see a hexagon, I just automatically unfollow.
00:23:04.730 - 00:23:07.222, Speaker B: No, not from the crypto people, though.
00:23:07.276 - 00:23:07.922, Speaker A: Not at all.
00:23:07.996 - 00:23:09.260, Speaker B: Well, fuck them.
00:23:10.830 - 00:23:18.666, Speaker A: We hate NFT type community. Sorry. For sure there's been that sentiment, but. Okay, so did you do it? Have you actually tried it?
00:23:18.688 - 00:23:33.454, Speaker B: Well, no, because my profile picture is my crypto punk, but with some Photoshop stuff going on, so I have my cool cat hanging out on the hat of my crypto punk. And so that's not an NFT, that's two of my nfts. So I've decided to not do that.
00:23:33.572 - 00:23:55.910, Speaker A: So I did it. And there's some other downsides, too. You have to have Twitter blue, which is like this premium service. I've never looked into it until now. I just wanted that to try it wanted the hexagon because it's a new crypto feature. So I do think that Twitter can't always charge for, like, I think this is going to be table stakes. Every social media platform will have to include this for free just to be competitive.
00:23:55.910 - 00:24:14.650, Speaker A: The other thing I would say is, the other reason I do think this is a big deal, David, and even this is just a very small step, is because, look, Twitter has 400 million monthly active users, okay? And we talked about memetic desire. When I see someone with a hexagon profile photo.
00:24:14.730 - 00:24:15.774, Speaker B: I want that too.
00:24:15.892 - 00:24:45.826, Speaker A: I want to do that too. And so I do think that there's this again, this is another example of web three using web two to propagate itself. And that is also bullish. I'm also seeing, like, we saw meta last week, Facebook, Instagram say they were going to add NFT features just this week. We'll get to it. YouTube adding NFT features in the future. So this is also going to have all the other social media platforms bandwagon onto this feature set and add NFT and crypto features.
00:24:45.826 - 00:24:48.040, Speaker A: So I think that is good too.
00:24:48.490 - 00:25:14.660, Speaker B: Okay. This was a fun little Twitter spaces where this was something about the lemons NFT project. I can't remember the full name of the lemons, but there was a Twitter spaces and two people showed up with the same NFT as their profile picture. Wait, where is it? On the right side? Yeah. The lemon with a little sprout. What is a circle? One's a circle and one's a hexagon. So you know who's got the real one.
00:25:14.660 - 00:25:17.220, Speaker B: There's an imposter among us.
00:25:18.390 - 00:25:24.110, Speaker A: That's great. That's very cool. And it is great that it validates directly on chain.
00:25:24.190 - 00:25:25.646, Speaker B: Little lemon was NFT.
00:25:25.838 - 00:25:27.122, Speaker A: Look, Reddit as well.
00:25:27.176 - 00:25:28.674, Speaker B: Here's the table stakes you were talking about.
00:25:28.712 - 00:25:40.594, Speaker A: Yeah, the table stakes I was talking about. So Reddit is apparently working on NFT profile pics as well. Everyone's going to do it. Very cool to see that happening, David. This was another cool feature rollout from the makers of Etherscan.
00:25:40.642 - 00:25:42.026, Speaker B: Yeah, I saw you having fun with this.
00:25:42.128 - 00:25:58.234, Speaker A: I was having a great time with this. This is called block scan chat. And what's cool about this is you can basically just send a message from your ETH address to some other ETH address. So you're like David Hoffman Eth, right, David? Yep. So I sent you a message. Did you ever respond?
00:25:58.282 - 00:26:01.982, Speaker B: Oh, that goes to my argent wallet. I need to get my ens name. Sorry.
00:26:02.036 - 00:26:24.626, Speaker A: That's why. Okay, so I just had fun because you log in with an ETH address if you have metamask or something, and I have one that's called bank. Eth is my ens address. And I just started dming some people I know. So I just dm'd DC. I dm'd Anthony Cisano. I dm'd you somewhere in here, I think this is DC.
00:26:24.626 - 00:26:36.860, Speaker A: Little back and forth DC. I didn't know it was him at first. Like, I had to actually label his ETh. And this is what he replies. He's like, hey, I'm launching a new one. Eth giveaway. Please send me your seed phrase to enter.
00:26:36.860 - 00:26:37.882, Speaker A: Oh, my God.
00:26:37.936 - 00:26:39.206, Speaker B: Did you send him a seed phrase?
00:26:39.318 - 00:27:01.102, Speaker A: No, I was like, okay, it's my first spam. It's my first spam message and I'm going to block this account. So I blocked him, and then I tweeted out that I blocked it, and he's like, hey, why'd you block me? So anyway, it was just fun going back and forth with people. Actually, Vitalik. I sent one to Vitalik. ETh is ETh, honey. I asked him and he replied, I think it's funny, personally.
00:27:01.166 - 00:27:02.494, Speaker B: That's pretty funny. That's pretty funny.
00:27:02.542 - 00:27:03.166, Speaker A: Classic Vitalik.
00:27:03.198 - 00:27:08.760, Speaker B: Wait, go back to DC's chat with him because. What did you say?
00:27:09.370 - 00:27:11.430, Speaker A: I hope we didn't talk bad about you, David.
00:27:12.570 - 00:27:20.780, Speaker B: I'm about to make fun of DC. You say, we're living in the future, DC. And DC goes, ha ha, strong. 1992 feels I was born in 1992.
00:27:23.070 - 00:27:41.470, Speaker A: There you go. DC investor. Oh, man, that's great. Yeah, DC always talks about, like, when you did that layer zero with him, he was talking about the birth of the Internet being very much like the birth of crypto. And I was just thinking like, does David actually understand this? How much of this is he picking up?
00:27:41.620 - 00:27:43.534, Speaker B: I had an aim. I had an aim account.
00:27:43.652 - 00:27:52.226, Speaker A: There you go. You had an aim account. This is aim. This is Ethereum instant messenger. So, super cool experiment that just rolled out. You guys can try it. This is another one.
00:27:52.226 - 00:27:53.918, Speaker A: David, what's this? SOS.
00:27:54.014 - 00:28:05.640, Speaker B: Sosmarket IO, a new prediction market on the scene. So in addition to polymarket, we now have SOS market, which has prediction markets for stuff. So check them out if you want to go bet on stuff.
00:28:06.090 - 00:28:33.038, Speaker A: A lot of ways to bet on stuff in crypto, that's for sure. I'm bullish on this. So opera just launched a dedicated crypto browser. Okay. Opera is a browser has like, one, two, 3% of market share, so it's not widely used, but they are going all in on crypto features. So imagine if Metamask was also a web browser. How much more usable, how much more extensible would it be rather than an extension? And that's what Opera is doing here.
00:28:33.038 - 00:28:49.702, Speaker A: Brave is doing some stuff, and I think Chrome and Firefox, they're going to be late if they don't join on the bandwagon as well. So it's good to see opera innovating here right now. This is in beta. I've used it. It's okay. It's kind of clunky. I can do some of my defi stuff, but not all of it.
00:28:49.702 - 00:28:53.154, Speaker A: But I'm sure it'll get better in the future. Anything to add on that, David?
00:28:53.202 - 00:28:56.710, Speaker B: More wallets is always better. Google should just buy Metamask.
00:28:57.210 - 00:29:03.526, Speaker A: Google should buy Metamask. Yeah, I don't want that, David. They'll kill it. I don't want them to buy Metamask.
00:29:03.558 - 00:29:06.140, Speaker B: Well, they got to do something and they have infinite money.
00:29:07.070 - 00:29:14.762, Speaker A: That's true. Now consensus does too. We'll be getting to that shortly. But let's talk about this. Robinhood is doing something. What are they adding?
00:29:14.826 - 00:29:46.166, Speaker B: Robinhood deploys beta crypto wallets allowing select customers to transfer off platform, which is a very needed feature so that you can time. Yeah, you can actually withdraw the crypto assets that you buy through Robinhood. Rather than just buying exposure, you can actually buy crypto assets. Imagine that this is them trying to catch up to the rest of the crypto ecosystem, but a really important feature to unlock because they're printing money with Dogecoin, they just printed a bunch of money and so they know that there's money there. So they need to just lean into more crypto stuff. And so that's what they're doing here.
00:29:46.268 - 00:30:02.110, Speaker A: Yeah, that's great. I don't know, 30 million users, 40 million users, like a lot of retail users using Robinhood. So another good onboarding also Zora v three. This is an NFT marketplace. I feel like it's a bit more crypto native, David and V three is rolling out. So what is coming on Zora v three?
00:30:02.180 - 00:30:33.938, Speaker B: Yeah, Zora v three I think is the most like bankless aligned marketplace, NFT marketplace that it exists. It's very much aligned with the protocol sync thesis. And if the phrase protocol sync thesis doesn't land with you, please go listen to the podcast or read the article on bankless about it. It's a fundamental bankless thesis. And what the protocol sync thesis is in a nutshell is it's a very deep protocol. There are very zero trust assumptions, very little trust assumptions. Things can be built on top of Zora.
00:30:33.938 - 00:31:07.646, Speaker B: NFT marketplaces can be built on top of Zora V three. It's like a meta protocol. And so not only is Zora a marketplace in of itself, but there's the Zora marketplace and then there's the Zora protocol. And the Zora marketplace is built by the Zora team and so is the Zora protocol. So they built their own marketplace on top of their own protocol. But many, many marketplaces can be built on top of the Zora protocol. So it's kind of like Zero X and matcha, right? Like matcha is an application built by the Zero X team that uses the Zero X protocol, but anybody can use a zero X protocol.
00:31:07.646 - 00:31:32.614, Speaker B: And so this is the same kind of idea with going on with Zora, just trying to scale out trustless NFT marketplaces. So they've released their Zora V three article. There will be a link in the show notes if you want to learn more. And at some point we're going to be doing some content with Jacob from Zora about this because he's a deep thinker and this is a very bankless ethos marketplace that we definitely need more of that in the world of nfts.
00:31:32.742 - 00:32:06.446, Speaker A: Almost everything on chain with this style of NFT minting. Actually, William Pistachio from Metaversal wrote a fantastic intro to Zora v three, too. So you can go check that out at metaversal banklesshq.com if you want more on that, too. Let's talk about this dollar hq. They're just launching full support for forming Dow llcs in the US from anywhere in the world. I just thought this was pretty cool, David, because Wyoming passed that legislation about being able to link Dows to Wyoming LLC type entities and get bank accounts.
00:32:06.446 - 00:32:41.882, Speaker A: And now here is a third party dollar who is making that easy. So you can just kind of click and generate, you have a Dao and you can generate an LLC entity for that DaO and register it in Wyoming. Get a tax id, get bank accounts. This is another form of interoperability, another form of bridging. This is a bridge from the new world of crypto to the legacy legal world of nation states. And it's cool to see that get developed. Let's talk about this Pac XYZ.
00:32:42.026 - 00:33:16.682, Speaker B: What are we looking at? Yeah, so we discovered this after doing our curve episode last night that was live streamed Wednesday night. Fantastic episode, by the way. And Pac XYZ is a way to vote on the quality of certain Congress members, certain representatives or potential representatives on how crypto aligned they are. So this is your, are you a friend of crypto scorecard? And it's public and everyone gets to vote as to whether they think somebody is crypto aligned or a crypto hater. And it's just basically calling out all the crypto haters out there that are.
00:33:16.736 - 00:33:18.058, Speaker A: Giving them a score, giving them a.
00:33:18.064 - 00:33:28.350, Speaker B: Score from negative five to positive five. And so there's a number of crypto haters out there. There's also Mitch McConnell comes up top. Elizabeth Warren is a big crypto hater.
00:33:28.690 - 00:33:33.182, Speaker A: This changed from yesterday, David. So yesterday, Elizabeth Warren was on the top.
00:33:33.316 - 00:33:36.834, Speaker B: Yeah. Somebody came in and really dumped some negative five votes on a lot of people.
00:33:36.952 - 00:33:42.802, Speaker A: Yeah. Tom Cotton, John Kennedy, Susan Collins all got negative fives. And the community votes on these things, right?
00:33:42.856 - 00:33:58.594, Speaker B: Community votes, yeah. This is community generated. This is kind of like a community generated list. But we also have some winners on there. So we have Erica rose up top. We have Tom Emmer coming on the podcast in a couple weeks. Pat Toomey, Ted Bud, Cynthia Lumis.
00:33:58.594 - 00:34:09.802, Speaker B: So if you are trying to figure out where your congressman stands or if you have an opinion about where your congressperson stands about crypto, you can check it out at Pac XYZ. Nice app, nice website.
00:34:09.856 - 00:34:11.870, Speaker A: Also, that curve episode is awesome. Go.
00:34:11.940 - 00:34:22.938, Speaker B: Episode is awesome. I learned so much, it felt like the finance MMORpg things that I've predicted would come to crypto, like, years ago. Yeah. Curve wars are dope.
00:34:22.954 - 00:34:28.734, Speaker A: Totally. This is the curve wars episode of Bankless. Go check that out, too. Let's get into the raises, David.
00:34:28.782 - 00:34:30.910, Speaker B: This is big raises.
00:34:30.990 - 00:34:43.638, Speaker A: All right, here's the theme. Right? Just like a few months ago, many of these companies were already massively valued, and now they're just raising at an even higher valuation. I'll start with consensus. So they just raised more.
00:34:43.724 - 00:34:46.214, Speaker B: It looks like they are raising. They have not.
00:34:46.252 - 00:34:59.174, Speaker A: They are raising at a $7 billion valuation. And just not less than two months ago, they raised at a $3.5 billion valuation. These private markets are just cranking. What's the next one, David?
00:34:59.222 - 00:35:07.402, Speaker B: Yeah, we got fireblocks clocking in at $8 billion after raising $550,000,000. They just raised.
00:35:07.546 - 00:35:10.334, Speaker A: They just raised during the summer. Do you remember this?
00:35:10.372 - 00:35:15.250, Speaker B: I think the last time we talked about a fireblocks raise, we were also saying how they had just raised.
00:35:15.670 - 00:35:16.514, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:35:16.712 - 00:35:19.506, Speaker B: So damn if you think $2.2 billion.
00:35:19.608 - 00:35:22.174, Speaker A: I think over the summertime when we talked to Fireblock CEO.
00:35:22.222 - 00:35:38.246, Speaker B: Amazing. And doesn't end there. We also have block Damon, which is a public blockchain's infrastructure service. Like staking as a service node stuff, raised $207,000,000 at three and a quarter billion dollar valuation. Crazy.
00:35:38.348 - 00:35:45.142, Speaker A: It's like the Oprah Winfrey meme. Like, you get to be a unicorn. You get to be a unicorn. Just handing out these billion dollar valuations everywhere.
00:35:45.206 - 00:36:00.320, Speaker B: Yeah. Meanwhile, while our crypto assets are taking a tumble, the valuations of some of these companies are just through the roof and coming in. Last but not least, FTX US scores an $8 billion valuation after raising $400 billion.
00:36:01.250 - 00:36:08.946, Speaker A: This is just FTX's US subsidy. Okay. FTX writ large is, like, already in the billions, maybe thirty s of billions by now.
00:36:09.048 - 00:36:28.970, Speaker B: But I have a take about this. Ryan, what's your take? Dave? My take is some gargantuan raises happened last week, and every single one of these investments is going to underperform ETH and BTC over time. Every single one. So if you, as the listener, are frustrated that you were not able to get into some of these rounds, just buy bitcoin and ether, because they're going to be the winners.
00:36:29.390 - 00:37:00.542, Speaker A: Do you think that can't be true in ten years when the price of ether is $20 trillion, as Kathy Wood and team predict? Right. So it's got to be the case that some of the value capture happens higher in the stack as the market matures, don't you think? And are you just saying that Ethan bitcoin still have a ways to go before that point? Or do you always think that Ethan bitcoin will outperform kind of app layer style investments?
00:37:00.686 - 00:37:35.710, Speaker B: I think if we are investing hundreds of millions of dollars into billion dollar valuations, then at that point, a lot of that upside has already happened. And so these are people trying to take risk off investments, which is weird because it's risk off investments onto an industry that is living on top of these risk on assets. So just take the risk. It's hidden risk because they're trying like, oh, we're going to go the safe route and invest in equities rather than crypto assets. But the equities are based on the crypto assets. Just buy the crypto assets.
00:37:36.290 - 00:37:46.162, Speaker A: Yeah, this has definitely been true historically. David, let's talk about another true thing historically, that's getting a job in crypto is awesome.
00:37:46.296 - 00:37:48.994, Speaker B: And also bullish for you.
00:37:49.112 - 00:38:19.206, Speaker A: Yeah, bullish for you. Bullish for your career. Go to the bankless job boards and see what jobs we have. Maybe 2022 is the year you get a job in crypto. A few I will read out senior go rust engineer at Syndica, a smart contract tech lead at Starx, a senior full stack engineer at Syndica, a lead data analyst at Makerdao, a data engineer at Paperchain, a senior technical writer for Go Ethereum, the Ethereum foundation. There's more, too. Go check the bankless job boards.
00:38:19.206 - 00:38:40.114, Speaker A: Bankless palette XYZ to sign up. Check those out. Get them in your inbox as know. This is an interesting tweet from the blockworks folks, and it's a whole thread on all of these weird job titles and the corporations that are starting to hire for them. Nike is hiring a metaverse director. Who is Nike? Sorry?
00:38:40.232 - 00:38:56.770, Speaker B: I said Nike. A metaverse director for Nike. And that's not the only one. They have a whole metaverse category. So. Principal innovation engineer, metaverse category. Senior 3d game designer, metaverse engineer at Nike.
00:38:56.770 - 00:38:57.846, Speaker B: Like, crazy.
00:38:58.028 - 00:39:00.250, Speaker A: Metaverse engineer at Nike.
00:39:00.830 - 00:39:06.060, Speaker B: I bet they have like, you need three years experience working in the metaverse or something like that.
00:39:06.990 - 00:39:10.474, Speaker A: Probably. But seriously, Nike, come post on the bakeless dabboard too.
00:39:10.592 - 00:39:15.450, Speaker B: Yeah, we'll get you a job. We'll get you a true crypto native, a true person who's actually been working in the Metaverse.
00:39:15.530 - 00:39:19.200, Speaker A: I mean, there are a few people, maybe three years. Have you been three years in the Metaverse, sir?
00:39:19.650 - 00:39:23.642, Speaker B: My whole life. Ever since I got into the metaverse. Diablo two was in the Metaverse.
00:39:23.706 - 00:39:33.134, Speaker A: Yeah, that's when you started. All right, back in the early 90s when you started join the Internet with DC. Right. All right, news time, David.
00:39:33.182 - 00:39:33.554, Speaker B: Oh, boy.
00:39:33.592 - 00:39:34.642, Speaker A: Are we ready to get into this?
00:39:34.696 - 00:39:37.398, Speaker B: Here we go. This is going to be a mess. Let's do it.
00:39:37.484 - 00:39:39.462, Speaker A: What do we even talk about? What do we even call this?
00:39:39.516 - 00:39:40.760, Speaker B: How do we even start?
00:39:41.930 - 00:39:44.070, Speaker A: Would you call this a defi scandal?
00:39:44.810 - 00:39:56.790, Speaker B: Yes, I think I. Hubbub. But it's scandals layered on top of scandals. We're invoking an older scandal because it's coming relevant again to talk about this Defi scandal.
00:39:56.870 - 00:40:25.106, Speaker A: Okay, let's set the stage a little bit. We have to talk about Danny Sesta gali Danny Sesta on Twitter, who is a Defi builder, very talented defi builder as well. Some people have compared him to, like, Andre Cronier. He's like the Andre cronier of 2022. Andre, of course, built Wifi, tons of fantastic protocols in 2020. And I guess that's some background on him.
00:40:25.288 - 00:40:33.762, Speaker B: He's got the guy behind magic, Internet, money, Wonderland, time spell, like all these. All this defi mafia.
00:40:33.826 - 00:40:42.490, Speaker A: He's got quite a following. So, like, how would you describe the tone and tenor of how Danny operates on Twitter and kind of messaging, that sort of thing?
00:40:42.640 - 00:40:47.770, Speaker B: Very populist. His following is very aggressive, of which I personally discovered.
00:40:48.270 - 00:40:49.418, Speaker A: You've been on the brunt end of.
00:40:49.424 - 00:41:15.154, Speaker B: This, I've been on the brunt end of this, as have. And it's very like working for the people, anti suits. I work for you kind of big frog army leader. I think in his Twitter bio, he's like CFOc, something of the frog army, something. CEO of the Frog army. Yeah, of the frog nation. And so very much like a four chan populace type.
00:41:15.272 - 00:41:22.806, Speaker A: And the projects are interesting too, because he has a tendency to ship fast, very fast, forking things, taking whatever got.
00:41:22.828 - 00:41:24.520, Speaker B: To appease the frogs. Right.
00:41:25.530 - 00:41:41.146, Speaker A: Abercadabra. And he's made a lot of people a lot of money, I would say is some of the context, like token price has gone up. Abercadabra money is a maker fork, actually, that takes some of the guardrails off of maker, I would say makes it a little bit more risky, a little.
00:41:41.168 - 00:41:44.670, Speaker B: Bit more, some people say interesting conservativism out of Makerdao. Yeah.
00:41:44.740 - 00:41:54.434, Speaker A: Yes. And Wonderland is a more recent project time. The time token is part of that. It's kind of an Olympus fork. And that's on avalanche. Okay, so that's Danny. That's who he is.
00:41:54.434 - 00:42:07.422, Speaker A: We got a first revelation this week, and this is Twitter confirmed. So it's somewhat unconfirmed, but it seems like it could be the case. What was this first revelation, David?
00:42:07.486 - 00:42:44.634, Speaker B: Yeah, so in the bear market, a lot of the quote unquote bear market, especially in the last week, a lot of his projects are based on collateral and collateralization. And when the value of collateral goes down, bad things happen. And so there's been a thread from Jack Nealwald that I don't follow his projects too closely and that's why I got the brunt of the frog army. But we'll go ahead and read this thread. Time is the largest own fork by market cap. Olympus dow fork by market cap. Ryan, if you scroll down and has been used as a playground by Danielle, I think is how Danny vcs ambitions and more creative ideas.
00:42:44.634 - 00:43:23.566, Speaker B: It's offered five figure APIs to stakers, but now as a result of the price crash, is trading at its below its treasury value. Cadabra money, which is the spell token, is a lending platform that lets users take out positions against crypto collateral and yield generating positions. This allows users to take out loans that pay themselves off. These loans charge interest and get liquidated, and fees go to the spell holders. Danny and other team members have also taken out loans against their wrapped memo, one of the tokens using spell, meaning they can cash out without actually selling. So using their tokens as collateral to borrow against. So they don't actually sell their tokens, but they can get the value out of them.
00:43:23.566 - 00:44:01.098, Speaker B: But if those positions get liquidated, they have all the money, and it's basically for selling. Like, they didn't press the sell button, but somebody did. And so people talked about how this strategy would be perhaps exposed or liquidated if the value of these collaterals went down too much. So they borrow all the money that they can against it, and if it goes down, then everything gets liquidated. And like that, you have a cascading liquidation. So this strategy was talked about on Twitter, causing time to crash below the value of the assets in the treasury, possibly triggering a liquidation event. Buybacks were supposed to be in place to keep the token price at the treasury value no matter what.
00:44:01.098 - 00:44:20.702, Speaker B: But this didn't happen, and the devs were silent, leading to accusations of a soft rug. Danny locked his Twitter account during all this drama, but fired back with an admission that time buybacks were not working as expected and a plan to fix time and Bosler's spell came out simultaneously. That was kind of like the start of this whole thing.
00:44:20.836 - 00:44:24.674, Speaker A: What is this idea of a soft rug? That's an interesting term. What do you think that means?
00:44:24.792 - 00:44:46.358, Speaker B: Yeah, that's just talking about how he's not capitulating his own assets, he's just putting his assets into a collateralized position, borrowing as much money as possible on that. And then if the value of those things go down and then there is a liquidation event, it doesn't matter because he borrowed all the money anyways. So it's like a roundabout way to exit without actually pressing the sell button.
00:44:46.524 - 00:45:00.490, Speaker A: I got it. And that's the charge. Again, somewhat unconfirmed, and that was just the first part of it. If that alone happened, we probably wouldn't be talking about it right now. But something was added to that, which is the second revelation. And this is going to.
00:45:00.560 - 00:45:06.814, Speaker B: This is unrelated, actually. So same person, same projects, but a completely different bit of drama going on.
00:45:06.852 - 00:45:15.234, Speaker A: Okay, so what is this bit of drama? Because it is unrelated, but it's kind of related to the entire scandal story.
00:45:15.352 - 00:45:50.778, Speaker B: Actually, before we get into that, it is TBD about whether Danny and some of the other big leaders of the projects were doing the soft rug. That is an accusation. They also could be using that same money to bolster the time price. That is what I think Danny has stated he was intending to do with that in order to prevent a cascading liquidation. This is still kind of unraveling, and we're still kind of figuring this out, but in the meantime, there is a bunch of other drama that came about. So are we ready to go into this?
00:45:50.864 - 00:46:25.686, Speaker A: Yeah, let's go into this, and there's some backstory here. So I guess maybe the high level is that a former Quadriga co founder just emerged, and apparently he's been the right hand man, right hand person of Danny managing a lot of the money behind the time treasuries. Yes. On the multi sig, this individual, Michael Patron, has an incredibly shady past. How should we best explain this? Like, who is Michael Patron? What is this shady past? What is Quadriga? Do you want to tell some of the story here, David? Yeah.
00:46:25.708 - 00:47:17.510, Speaker B: Well, Michael's patron has been off the radar, off the grid for a very long time. But this individual, Zach XBT, tweeted out private dms and telegram with Danny. And he says to Danny, I came across something rather odd about Ox Sifu, which is one of the multisig signers on the projects. I've discovered something about Sifu. And Danny goes, what's up? And Zach XBT says, well, he's the Quadringa guy, the Quadringa guy that was a convicted felon for identity fraud and has been off the grid for a while. And Danny goes, I cannot confirm, but I have thought a lot about that. And he responds, dangerous to be working with him, sir.
00:47:17.510 - 00:48:01.202, Speaker B: And that's one tweet. And that's basically that. And so he tweets out, this needs to be shared. Zero X Sifu is the co founder of Quadringa CX. Michael Patron, if you are unfamiliar with that, it's the canadian exchange that collapsed in 2019 after founder Gerald Cotton disappeared with $169,000,000. I've confirmed with this about, with Danny over messages. And so this is a really big deal because this is an individual with a very shady past and is discovered to be a multi sig signer on this defi protocol on avalanche that has a ton of so managing millions of dollars, millions of dollars of a protocol.
00:48:01.202 - 00:48:55.554, Speaker B: And what's egregious about this is that Danny knew about this for about a month without raising the alarm about the significance of this individual. So there's this fantastic summarizing article that we're going to read some of the things about it just because it summarizes so well after all of this came out, after Zero XBT revealed this, Danny, if you want to scroll down a little bit, Ryan. Danny posted on Twitter today allegations about our team member Zero Xifu will circulate. I want everyone to know that I'm aware of this and have decided that the past of an individual does not determine their future. I choose to value the time we spend together without knowing his past more than anything. Danny also issued an official statement reiterating his beliefs in a second chances and reassuring everyone that all the funds are safe, even though a convicted felon is watching over the treasury. I found out about this one month ago, and I am of the opinion of giving second chances.
00:48:55.554 - 00:49:26.370, Speaker B: As I've mentioned on Twitter, I've seen the community very divided about my choice of maintaining him as the treasury manager. After finding out who he was in his past, he added that patron. Patron will step down from his position at Wonderland, and there will be a vote as to whether or not he rejoins the team. That vote is ongoing at the time of recording. Wonderland has the say to who manages the treasury, not me or the rest of the Wonderland team, says Danny. Yes. Also, this is just, again, funny backstory on this Michael guy.
00:49:26.370 - 00:50:04.654, Speaker B: Michael Patron is former convicted felon Omar Donani, who legally changed his name to cover up his criminal past. Patron left quadringa in early 2016 after he and Cotton allegedly had a quarrel in split ways. Prior to founding quadringa, Patron was one of 28 people arrested in connection to operating an identity theft ring called Shadow Crew. He pled guilty and was sentenced to 18 months in us federal prison. Upon his release, he was sent back to Canada, where he went right back to doing the thing he was always doing all along, which was moving money. And so that's kind of the story. The take at the very bottom of this article has a take on this individual.
00:50:04.654 - 00:50:18.850, Speaker B: He says, patron is a one trick pony. He's not clever enough to reinvent himself, and his hubris makes it impossible for him to simply disappear and go quiet and enjoy a life somewhere. Kind of pointing out he's like a serial shenaniganizer.
00:50:19.190 - 00:50:42.858, Speaker A: Okay. All right. Just to follow this large defi protocol, managing lots of money with a very esteemed builder. Defi builder in the community, Danny. The community finds out that the person that Danny set in charge of the multi sigs and this community treasury is a convicted felon, super shady individual.
00:50:42.944 - 00:50:43.818, Speaker B: Nefarious individual.
00:50:43.904 - 00:51:29.174, Speaker A: Yeah, nefarious individual. Probably many in the community would say should not be trusted with money. And furthermore, that Danny knew about this for a month, didn't disclose this to the community. And then it was interesting because Danny decided to double down and, you know, second chances. I believe in giving people second chances before then going back to the community and say, what do you want to do with this individual? Should he still be managing the funds or not? And so this created quite a stir on Twitter. I would know back and forth people were disappointed with Danny about the kind of the lack of transparency, disappointed with the project and some of the statements. Michael Patron made a statement as well.
00:51:29.174 - 00:51:31.270, Speaker A: Do we want to get into that or skip that? David?
00:51:31.350 - 00:51:48.714, Speaker B: Yeah, it's more or less like, hey, I've had a fantastic time working on Wonderland. I'm sad that I'm going to have to go. I understand why I have to go, but I'm leaving, and I love all of you. And then a bunch of emojis from the community in discord. We'll put the tweet in the show notes.
00:51:48.842 - 00:52:02.078, Speaker A: Yeah. So here, I guess, some takes that I have early on. First of all, we reached out to Danny, actually, and he's going to come on the podcast, I think, hopefully next week and talk about this. So give him a chance to kind of explain, hopefully his actions.
00:52:02.174 - 00:52:05.982, Speaker B: I've given him my calendar link before and he hasn't clicked on it. Hopefully he comes on the pod.
00:52:06.046 - 00:52:09.110, Speaker A: Baker's crossed. That's what he publicly committed to Danny.
00:52:09.770 - 00:52:13.142, Speaker B: We are very fair and rational individuals. So we can do this.
00:52:13.196 - 00:52:38.830, Speaker A: Yes. At least David is. I'm not so much, but takeaways for me, this is a very bad look for Defi. This is kind of the fodder that Elizabeth Warren wants to bring to a senate committee. Like if she found out about this. Right, so you've got a convicted felon managing millions of dollars of investors capital without them knowing about it. What's her answer to that regulation? More regulation in the space.
00:52:38.830 - 00:52:41.518, Speaker A: So one take for me is like.
00:52:41.684 - 00:52:44.800, Speaker B: Sorry to cut you off, this is a shadowy super.
00:52:48.690 - 00:53:15.500, Speaker A: I told you so, and we'd have to say, okay, elizabeth, in this specific case, you were right. And here's the take. I guess if we don't regulate ourselves, they'll regulate us. Okay. And I think this is why the original poster for this is it. Zach, XBT is doing God's work in surfacing this, taking a big risk on this.
00:53:16.030 - 00:53:20.922, Speaker B: Yeah, because the frog army is not something that you want to mess with. And this is.
00:53:20.976 - 00:53:35.886, Speaker A: I'm sure he's gotten threats, David. I'm sure he's gotten threats. I'm sure it's know even legal threats, all sorts of things. But an individual whistleblower shedding a light on this is more of what Defi needs in order to keep itself clean.
00:53:36.068 - 00:53:39.070, Speaker B: Yes, Zach, XBT, nice job.
00:53:39.140 - 00:53:39.582, Speaker A: Well done.
00:53:39.636 - 00:53:40.106, Speaker B: Nice job.
00:53:40.148 - 00:54:07.018, Speaker A: Thanks for having the courage to surface this. And I guess my last takeaway on this is just in general, we have to be very careful of trusting people in DeFi okay. It's like trusting people in crypto in general, especially. It's a red flag for me whenever someone asks you to trust them. Okay. The takeaway here is never trust anyone in crypto that demands that you trust them. And people who are continuously saying, no, it's fine.
00:54:07.018 - 00:54:35.890, Speaker A: I've got the multisigs just like, trust me, I have your best interest at heart. That always sends red flags and shivers up my back, because the whole philosophy is crypto, of crypto is verify, don't trust. You shouldn't have to trust people. We have systems in place to make this entire space trustless, and we don't want to depend on trusting a small set of individuals. It's not reputational. Trust in the space. It shouldn't be.
00:54:35.890 - 00:54:38.278, Speaker A: Anyway. Those are some of my takeaways. What do you have?
00:54:38.364 - 00:55:07.386, Speaker B: Anon developers are always a hairy topic because it's good overall. But also, I'm happy that people are able to be anon in this industry if they so choose. But also, the combination of anons on multisigs is a little bit rough because reputation is a fantastic piece of collateral to have to hold someone accountable. And if you are an like, you remove that option from the community to hold you accountable because of how you're anon.
00:55:07.578 - 00:55:27.982, Speaker A: This guy Michael literally changed his. Yes, right. Literally changed his name. How much to cover up a past? Right, to cover up a past. How much easier is that to do on the Internet where you could just change an ETH address, create a new online reputation, and start from scratch? Yeah. So it's something that we have to work on. Here are some takes from around the community.
00:55:27.982 - 00:55:30.806, Speaker A: This is Andre Cronier, who works very.
00:55:30.828 - 00:55:32.098, Speaker B: Very closely with Danny.
00:55:32.194 - 00:55:33.414, Speaker A: Yeah. Why don't you read this?
00:55:33.452 - 00:55:51.958, Speaker B: This is just the. Oh, it's so tiresome meme. It's also tiresome. And Andre says, I just want to code. And he has some commentary further down as well where he says, I still support Danny, still planning on working with him, but there are lines. A history of consistent fraud, theft, and malicious behavior isn't a mistake. That's intent.
00:55:51.958 - 00:56:04.846, Speaker B: Having Sifu manage funds, especially user funds, can be argued is negligence. That's all I have. Danny knew for a month, and in that time, Sifu was handling funds. I don't know what psyops. I don't know what's going on. I want to get off Willy Wonka's magical ride.
00:56:05.038 - 00:56:10.830, Speaker A: There you go. From Andre, a similar kind of builder in the field. What's his take, David?
00:56:10.910 - 00:56:30.460, Speaker B: Yeah. So Danny wrote somewhere that he said, I thought I could fix him. Like, oh, I thought I could fix this convicted felon person, which is a brunt of some jokes on crypto Twitter. And then simona pop, who's a fantastic female community leader in the space goes the female urge to know that that never works.
00:56:32.750 - 00:56:56.910, Speaker A: Yeah, I can't fix them. And I think, look, I think the important thing here was transparency and disclosure, right? Like, if the community had have known who this individual was managing their funds, then they could have gotten ahead of this and voted on it. And they're in the process of voting now. And I expect they will not reinstate this individual as the manager of their millions of dollars in treasury.
00:56:56.990 - 00:57:04.130, Speaker B: We would show the snapshot, but it's got the feature of the votes are being hidden, so we don't actually know who's winning or who's losing.
00:57:05.030 - 00:57:07.686, Speaker A: It would probably be available by the time you guys listen to this.
00:57:07.788 - 00:57:14.806, Speaker B: Anyway, it ends January 20 eigth at 09:00 p.m. Pacific time, I think. Yeah, there you go.
00:57:14.908 - 00:57:18.870, Speaker A: Well, that's what's happening in DFI. Kind of the latest thing.
00:57:19.020 - 00:57:21.414, Speaker B: That was a good one. That was a good one.
00:57:21.452 - 00:57:34.750, Speaker A: It took us a while to get through. I hope you're hanging with us. Let's talk about some ethereum stuff. Big moves this week. So Ryan Wyatt, he is a executive at YouTube over their gaming division. He's leaving YouTube. He was.
00:57:34.750 - 00:57:52.258, Speaker A: He's leaving. He's joining Polygon Studios. He's joining a layer two development studio as their CEO. And we've messaged him privately and he's basically said, yes. Burning the ships. All in web three, here I come.
00:57:52.344 - 00:57:52.738, Speaker B: Nice.
00:57:52.824 - 00:57:57.714, Speaker A: Super cool to see that exodus. I think it's going to be big. He's coming on the podcast too, right?
00:57:57.752 - 00:58:03.110, Speaker B: Damn it. That's what I was going to say. Do you know what? He's also joining Ryan front, the bankless podcast.
00:58:04.010 - 00:58:12.090, Speaker A: Yes. We're excited about that, too. We're going to talk all about it. YouTube also wants to help content creators capitalize on NFts. That's the headline.
00:58:12.430 - 00:58:22.650, Speaker B: But apparently YouTube execs aren't satisfied by the rate of webtoon movement. So just saying that you're going to do nft stuff, not enough to keep the talent on the ship.
00:58:22.810 - 00:58:55.862, Speaker A: Yeah, that's right. But this is a cool message from the CEO of YouTube who is stating that they are going to focus on expanding the YouTube ecosystem to help creators capitalize on emerging technologies, including things like nfts, while continuing to strengthen and enhance the experience creators and fans have on YouTube, YouTube adding nfts. We'll see that this year at some point in time. That's big, David. Something happening in the Solana ecosystem as well. We don't have time to get into all of it, but what is the TLDR summary here?
00:58:55.916 - 00:59:13.674, Speaker B: Yeah, so during all the liquidations, during the big oof candles that happened last Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, Solana did the whole go down thing again, significantly degraded performance that basically prevented the average individual from pushing a transaction through the Solana chain.
00:59:13.802 - 00:59:21.470, Speaker A: They couldn't even pay enough. Like with Ethereum, gas prices rise, but in this case, they couldn't even pay enough to get their transaction. It just wouldn't work.
00:59:21.540 - 00:59:51.254, Speaker B: Yeah, the network just wasn't accepting transactions accepted, like very specific scenarios. Solana network consensus is different from what I'm used to. Anna Tolley, the CEO of Salana, goes a quick summary of the recent performance issues in the network. Liquidator bots started spamming the network with 2 million packets per second, hitting a single node with mostly duplicate messages. These messages unearthed a bug in how the network was handling duplicates. The code responsible for deduping messages was after the signature verification, blah, blah, blah, blah. Since then, the network has seen much better performance.
00:59:51.254 - 01:00:11.802, Speaker B: But there's still some starvation happening with a liquidator spam. Under load blocks are smaller, with fewer than expected transactions. And here's the part that is a really big red flag for me to address the general issue. Engineers plan to introduce flow control in version 1.9 with QoS by stake weight. Stakeweight is like the stake of the Salana token.
01:00:11.946 - 01:00:13.854, Speaker A: Qos stands for quality of service.
01:00:13.972 - 01:00:43.778, Speaker B: Thank you. But now implementing this feature in 1.8 is the highest priority. This implementation uses quic. Do you know what that one is? Quick no to rate limit senders that should be rolled out in the next four to five weeks. Okay, introduce flow control by stake weight in plain English, which Anatoly seems to be allergic to. He is saying that transaction input, transaction inclusion in the blockchain will be controlled by your level of Solana stake.
01:00:43.778 - 01:00:57.440, Speaker B: And so if you have significant stake, you get to add your transactions in more consistently. And this is the thing that has always bugged me about Solana, because if you cannot validate the chain, then you are at the whims of the people who.
01:01:01.010 - 01:01:19.362, Speaker A: Case in this case, they are giving validators with stake as a proportion of capital. They are elevating them. The validators with more capital have the ability to censor transactions, have the ability to capture mev, and get their transactions in ahead of the plebs.
01:01:19.506 - 01:01:48.286, Speaker B: So the significant stakers of the Solana ecosystem, the massive exchanges of the world that run the validators, are able to get their transactions in first before the users. So if you have a race condition to save your position from being liquidated, you will be losing to somebody with a significant amount of stake, which is almost always a very well capitalized individual. So your transaction as an individual to save your position is going to lose to somebody with a lot of capital who's going to liquidate you.
01:01:48.388 - 01:01:50.640, Speaker A: Welcome to robinhood again, welcome to.
01:01:51.010 - 01:02:04.610, Speaker B: Except why did we get upset by GME in the first? Is this is the traditional finance system where the bankers went. This is why the specific network design of Solana does not sit well with me.
01:02:04.760 - 01:02:23.030, Speaker A: Yeah, I just don't think it's situated to be a layer, one settlement layer with this kind of design. I think that some in Solana might see this as a feature. Oh, okay. We're making sure the network doesn't go down by implementing this quality of service by stake weight feature. But it is not a feature. It is a bug.
01:02:23.110 - 01:02:27.530, Speaker B: It's centralization. It's like, hey, we found another way to introduce centralization.
01:02:28.030 - 01:02:30.794, Speaker A: There you go. Enough of that. Sorry.
01:02:30.912 - 01:02:33.926, Speaker B: I don't like being negative, but it's.
01:02:33.958 - 01:02:34.898, Speaker A: Got to talk concerning.
01:02:34.934 - 01:03:17.078, Speaker B: It's extremely concerning. Okay. One more thing about this, Ryan. What happened in 2008 when the markets turned into a gigantic mess? When markets and financial markets, we had our episode with Tarun Chitra, who talked about every single financial innovation is about the process of removing lawyers. What happened during the bottom of 2008 was that markets broke, and because of the collateralized debt obligations and all the mess of who owns what, everything broke. And so they had to reintroduce lawyers back into the system to determine who owns what. If the Solana blockchain goes down and halts, and the clarity on who gets liquidated and how is broken and people's legal rights feel violated.
01:03:17.078 - 01:03:47.118, Speaker B: It goes from a world where we have consensus determined by a blockchain to back to lawyers. And the goal is to never go back to lawyers. And so we need networks that have 100% uptime, because the difference between 100% uptime and 99% uptime is that all of the important stuff happens in that 1%. And that 1% is when the lawyers get called in, and that's where regulations happen, and that's where Elizabeth Warren gets upset. And then we do not want to piss off Elizabeth Warren.
01:03:47.214 - 01:04:05.510, Speaker A: No, especially not. I don't want her to find out about the danny thing, to be honest. I hope she's not listening to this podcast, Elizabeth. Yeah. And I hope people aren't hearing from that, that like, oh, David hates Solana, bankless hates Solana, Ryan hates Solana. It's like, no, we don't. I mean, I think Solana is a fine execution layer.
01:04:05.510 - 01:04:28.882, Speaker A: I think it is fine in doing what it's doing and onboarding lots of people. What we are saying, though, is things like this reveal that it is not suitable to be a layer one settlement layer for the world. It's not suitable to be compared to what Ethereum is doing. And anyway, enough said on that. Let's keep moving. Layer two, 2022. It is the year of layer two.
01:04:28.882 - 01:04:35.230, Speaker A: Let's go through a few things. So synthetics just launched. Incentives, token incentives.
01:04:35.310 - 01:04:35.666, Speaker B: L two.
01:04:35.688 - 01:04:45.810, Speaker A: Unfair optimism. This is great. Tokens on top of tokens. This is going to juice up the l two ecosystem. I hope more projects do this. Any other thoughts, David?
01:04:45.890 - 01:05:01.930, Speaker B: Yeah. 50,000 SNX will be distributed over a one month period to people that LP, ether and SNX on gelato network on top of optimism. So cool. Congrats to optimism. Congrats to synthetics. Let's get these yield farms out the door, guys.
01:05:02.080 - 01:05:13.306, Speaker A: Yeah. This is another cool thing that's going on. A battle for fees. In the battle for fees, between all of the rollups, users win because fees just go down. Arbitrum just published an update that lowers.
01:05:13.338 - 01:05:15.082, Speaker B: Transaction fees once again.
01:05:15.236 - 01:05:27.438, Speaker A: And their big transaction fee lower hasn't even been implemented yet. That is called nitro. And look at them all competing. So Arbitram is screenshotting that and they're like, haha, we're lower than optimism now. Just last week they weren't.
01:05:27.534 - 01:05:34.774, Speaker B: They keep trading blow for blow. It's like optimism is like, well, we push an update and now our fees are lower. Now arbitrage. Well, we push an update, now our fees are lower.
01:05:34.892 - 01:05:45.674, Speaker A: And I love it. Right? And so this is optimism talking about transactions going up, savings going up as well. Get you a chain that can do both. This is the kind of I love competition we need in the space. Right?
01:05:45.712 - 01:06:15.122, Speaker B: Because can you click on the graph? Click on the graph, yeah. The red line is the number of transactions per day, which as soon as optimism did their update last week, which reduced fees by 30%, it just hockey sticks. And then also what? Also hockey sticks is the black line, which is the multiple times cheaper versus the Ethereum L one. And so we went from like, that's awesome. 50 ish, 60 times cheaper to over 200 times cheaper with that last update. And there are more updates to come.
01:06:15.256 - 01:06:29.478, Speaker A: When you make the blocks cheaper, there's more demand. That's what crazy graph is saying as well. Crazy. It's great. Fuse has also just deployed on arbitrum as well. That is from Rari. Of course, this is a pretty big deal too.
01:06:29.478 - 01:06:30.562, Speaker A: Zkdao.
01:06:30.626 - 01:06:31.286, Speaker B: Huge.
01:06:31.468 - 01:07:01.586, Speaker A: This was just approved. Zkdao is a DaO specifically dedicated to the ZK sync ecosystem. That is, of course ZK roll ups from the folks at matter labs. They now have $200 million to play with. They're going to deploy that to users, to actually not users, developers, ecosystem participants in the ZK roll up network. And there's all sorts of ways you can reach out and get involved. So these layer twos are well capitalized as well.
01:07:01.586 - 01:07:05.582, Speaker A: And it looks like they're going to use the funds to grow their ecosystems.
01:07:05.726 - 01:07:10.466, Speaker B: $200 million for the development. I'm Bullish. Bullish.
01:07:10.578 - 01:07:13.126, Speaker A: That's great. Nfts. You bullish nfts still. David. Yeah.
01:07:13.148 - 01:07:16.002, Speaker B: Can we just burn through these brands and nfts?
01:07:16.066 - 01:07:19.698, Speaker A: Everyone's coming aboard nfts. Okay. Do you want to start Prada.
01:07:19.794 - 01:07:42.298, Speaker B: Prada and Adidas, which has recently ventured into the metaverse even once again, no one knows what that means, are partnering to launch a collection of nfts later this month. So also on Polygon. Also on Polygon. Gucci. Gucci taps into toy brand super plastic to drop ten super Gucci nfts in February. I do not know some of these brands. Super plastic.
01:07:42.394 - 01:07:43.070, Speaker A: Bud light.
01:07:43.140 - 01:07:50.260, Speaker B: Bud light. The worst beer ever. Beer giant Hanhauser Bush launches NFT project for Bud light. Cool.
01:07:51.270 - 01:07:54.130, Speaker A: We don't know if it's the worst beer ever. Have you had all the beers?
01:07:54.470 - 01:07:59.234, Speaker B: I've had some bad Bud light. They're all in the same category. The light beer shenanigans.
01:07:59.282 - 01:08:14.970, Speaker A: Hey, this link won't load. But Paris Hilton, apparently she's giving away Paris Hilton. Nfts. She's a brand in of itself. He's giving those away on. Yeah. Elite shows are becoming like NFT propagation engines.
01:08:14.970 - 01:08:20.106, Speaker A: What's this? This is something different on the NFT side. So Opensea is doing a thing. What are they doing? Yeah.
01:08:20.128 - 01:08:54.680, Speaker B: So Opensea support has tweeted out on Twitter to address feedback we've received about our creator tools. We've updated our collection storefront contract limits to only support a creation, up to five collections and 50 items per collection. So basically what that means is that if you are using OpenC to mint your nfts, your NFT. You only have five different collections at 50 apiece. So you have maximum like 250 nfts before you have to make a new account or something. So putting in throttles on creators, minting nfts. And I actually don't know why that's going on.
01:08:54.680 - 01:08:59.810, Speaker B: Definitely some negative pushback from the creator community on this one.
01:08:59.980 - 01:09:06.042, Speaker A: That's interesting. Wow. Okay, bitcoin news, El Salvador. They just purchased more bitcoin. Buy the dip here.
01:09:06.096 - 01:09:16.286, Speaker B: 410 more bitcoins. The nation now owns 1500 bitcoins and also plans to issue a 1,000,000,010 year bond this year. So we have Michael, say, or ten.
01:09:16.308 - 01:09:17.246, Speaker A: Year Bitcoin bond, right?
01:09:17.268 - 01:09:31.694, Speaker B: Bitcoin bond, yeah. So we have microsaylor and strategy and now we have naive Taleb, or however, I can't remember his name. And El Salvador Tilleb is the other one. He hates bitcoin.
01:09:31.822 - 01:09:57.722, Speaker A: He does. Great writer, though. All this while the IMF is saber rattling and urging El Salvador to remove bitcoin as legal tender, kind of threatening them, basically being like, hey, you're going to be cut off from the IMF, from the global finance community. Bye bye, credit debt facilities if you continue doing this. IMF not happy waving their finger at Bukelli and El Salvador for doing this.
01:09:57.776 - 01:10:04.480, Speaker B: Granted, taking leverage on bitcoin as a nation state is like, well, maybe you shouldn't be giving any more credit in that case.
01:10:05.970 - 01:10:12.654, Speaker A: I wonder if bitcoin like five or ten x's in the next few years. I wonder what the IMF will say.
01:10:12.692 - 01:10:15.026, Speaker B: And then banks are like, hey, guys, want to borrow some money?
01:10:15.128 - 01:10:33.554, Speaker A: Yeah. I wonder if this message will change at all. Let's talk about this. I guess this is regulatory related ish. Bank related ish. Hayden Adams, creator of Uniswap, tweets this out this week. JP Morgan Chase closed my bank accounts with no notice or explanation.
01:10:33.554 - 01:10:49.286, Speaker A: I'm sorry, I'm laughing, Hayden. This has happened to me, okay? Bank of America. I've gotten canceled by banks as well. He says I know many individuals and companies who have been similarly targeted simply for working in the crypto industry. Yep. Thanks for making it personal. This part's hilarious to me, dude.
01:10:49.286 - 01:10:56.270, Speaker A: It's like Hayden built uniswap before he was pissed off. Okay, what's he going to do now?
01:10:56.420 - 01:10:57.994, Speaker B: Laser eyes, Hayden Adams.
01:10:58.042 - 01:10:58.622, Speaker A: Let's see it.
01:10:58.676 - 01:10:59.582, Speaker B: Let's see it.
01:10:59.716 - 01:11:06.334, Speaker A: Bad move. Chase JP Morgan. This is a take from Brian Quintez. What does he say here, David?
01:11:06.382 - 01:11:21.206, Speaker B: He goes, likely a shadow debanking of crypto by the Federal Reserve or the USOC office of the Comptroller. Is that what that is? Bank examiners with direction from the top. So Brian Quintez, very highly informed individual, says that this is direction from the.
01:11:21.228 - 01:11:24.600, Speaker A: Top, former CFTC commissioner. Right.
01:11:25.690 - 01:11:49.662, Speaker B: And he says, if the examiner told a bank that a certain customer is too risky and that bank ended that relationship, the bank is contractually prevented from telling that customer why. So I think my take is that they saw Hayden Adams as their customer of their bank. They probably saw his bank account go from like zero to plus $1 million very, very quickly. And they were like, we don't like this guy. We've got to rug pull this guy. This guy is getting too.
01:11:49.716 - 01:11:50.190, Speaker A: Is he?
01:11:50.260 - 01:11:54.846, Speaker B: Yeah, he's just a nerdy looking software developer with rainbow socks on. Like, we could. Yeah.
01:11:54.868 - 01:11:59.378, Speaker A: What's he going to do about it? We'll just shut down his bank accounts, right?
01:11:59.544 - 01:12:03.470, Speaker B: Meanwhile, all his wealth is in crypto. Welcome to the bankless world, Hayden.
01:12:03.630 - 01:12:06.046, Speaker A: Yeah, welcome. You're forced to go bankless.
01:12:06.158 - 01:12:07.410, Speaker B: Forced banklessness.
01:12:08.070 - 01:12:23.900, Speaker A: This is unfortunate, right? But this is going to happen more and more, and what it's going to do long term is completely erode the institutional credibility of the banking system. They can just exit Hayden from the banks, right? I mean, people see this smart, they'll know. They'll figure it out.
01:12:24.270 - 01:12:27.674, Speaker B: What happens to the money in his account? Do they just cut him a check or something?
01:12:27.712 - 01:12:36.126, Speaker A: No, this is what they did for me. They literally cut me a check. They're like, in 30 days, we're going to send you a check. And they sent me a check by mail with the money I have.
01:12:36.148 - 01:12:38.014, Speaker B: They hold on your money for 30 days?
01:12:38.212 - 01:12:39.054, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:12:39.252 - 01:12:40.094, Speaker B: Did they give you interest?
01:12:40.132 - 01:12:57.366, Speaker A: You can't log in. Yeah, 0.1% interest, probably. How do you know anyway, Mark Zuckerberg? Okay, Zuckcoin is dead. You remember Libra? Remember how that was going to take over all of crypto? That Facebook was going to be the blockchain? This is narrative in 2018, people thought.
01:12:57.388 - 01:13:02.902, Speaker B: That this was going to kill Ethereum. Everybody thinks everything is going to kill Ethereum. Just like. Just stop saying that.
01:13:03.036 - 01:13:11.462, Speaker A: Mark Zuckerberg. His ambitions unravel around a stablecoin of diem sale talk. So they're actually talking about selling Diem itself.
01:13:11.596 - 01:13:13.186, Speaker B: Whatever the app. Yeah, I'm right.
01:13:13.228 - 01:13:14.938, Speaker A: May JPMorgan, you guys could buy that.
01:13:15.024 - 01:13:16.170, Speaker B: Should we buy it, Ron?
01:13:16.750 - 01:13:17.786, Speaker A: How much?
01:13:17.968 - 01:13:21.020, Speaker B: No, I'll offer $5,000.
01:13:22.350 - 01:13:23.002, Speaker A: There you go.
01:13:23.056 - 01:13:24.326, Speaker B: Overpriced Zuckerberg.
01:13:24.358 - 01:13:31.486, Speaker A: If you're listing $5,000, bankless will buy DM for you and we'll complete that project. We'll just make it a stable coin on Ethereum, like it should have been.
01:13:31.668 - 01:13:42.580, Speaker B: Okay, next one. New York City Mayor Eric Adams receives first paycheck in the form of BTC and East New York City mayor receiving crypto make sure to sign up for Altoira, sir.
01:13:45.030 - 01:13:57.560, Speaker A: Nice. That's cool, though. Look, crypto friendly politicians. It's happening. There's a few of them now. He's trying to boost his ranking on the Pac XYZ website. I think that's Eric Adams strategy here.
01:13:57.560 - 01:14:10.060, Speaker A: All right, guys, we will be back with some takes of the week, and there are a few hot ones. Of course, we'll end with the meme of the week as well, so stay tuned for that. Before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
01:14:11.470 - 01:14:59.290, Speaker B: So you've got some money, but how are you going to use it? You want to spend when you know you should be saving? Never buy a house at this rate. But what if you could spend and save at the same time for the enlightened kind? With inquiring minds, a new world awaits. Set yourself free with completely flexible self repaying loan technologies supported on desktop and mobile. Seize the power of Alchemyx, allowing you to spend and save at the same time. Leverage your wealth without the risk of liquidation. Take out a loan that repays itself by using yield from your deposit to pay off your balance. Your only debt is time.
01:14:59.290 - 01:15:44.902, Speaker B: What was once inconceivable is now within your grasp. If you're going bankless, you need metamask. This is your tool to unlock the world of DeFi without giving up custody over your private keys. Metamask is both a secure in browser wallet and also a secure bridge for your hardware wallet. You can now trade tokens on any dex or aggregators. Metamask swap gathers real time pricing information across all the DeFi exchanges, allowing you to select your best price while getting all the metamask benefits of self custody, lower gas costs, and increased transaction success rates. Metamask also has a fantastic mobile wallet that I use when I'm out and about, which I use to collect poaps, nfts and do all my DFI things while I'm away from home.
01:15:44.902 - 01:16:20.610, Speaker B: If you haven't downloaded metamask, you got to try it out. Web three wouldn't be the same without it. Download Metamask for desktop and mobile at Metamask IO and load up your treasure ledger, lattice, or keystone hardware wallets so that they too can get into the world of web three.

01:16:42.982 - 01:16:48.906, Speaker A: All right, guys, we are back with the takes of the week. This is the first one. This is something you said in the market section.
01:16:49.018 - 01:16:50.462, Speaker B: Did I pull your take, Ryan? Sorry.
01:16:50.516 - 01:16:55.678, Speaker A: No, it's worth repeating. It's that good. Okay. Do you want to read the take?
01:16:55.764 - 01:17:06.850, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. Since I already said it earlier. Ryan, Sean Adams says this isn't 2018. In 2018, crypto died on its own. No macro to blame. The market decided the substance didn't justify the hype. Today is different.
01:17:06.850 - 01:17:17.510, Speaker B: In 2022, crypto is crashing alongside all risk on assets. Fed policy caused this. This is a macro shakeout. This winter won't last two years. That's great.
01:17:17.660 - 01:17:21.882, Speaker A: I think that's true. I don't think that people are saying it's 2018. I don't think it is.
01:17:21.936 - 01:17:26.358, Speaker B: As soon as the SP reverses, so does crypto, and it will reverse even harder.
01:17:26.534 - 01:17:44.138, Speaker A: That's right. Yeah. So temporary, maybe. I don't know how long it lasts, but I don't think it's going to be 2018. I don't think it's two years. This is something I ran across in the r antiwork subreddit, which was interesting and sad. There was some drama, by the way, this week in the r Antiworks subreddit.
01:17:44.138 - 01:18:04.274, Speaker A: It's 1.6 million subscribers, I believe, to the subreddit. And that, I guess, is out of scope of the podcast. But I ran across this. It's the headline people no longer believe working hard will lead to a better life, survey shows. I feel like that is very much why r antiwork got to 1.6 million subscribers.
01:18:04.274 - 01:18:42.238, Speaker A: It's because people are fed up. They're tired, they're jaded, they're exhausted by their shitty corporate jobs or their shitty jobs in general, and it's led to you, them feeling like working hard no longer pays. And I guess I just had a thought on it. First of all, I understand the sentiment completely, but also, it's not that working hard is the problem, is it? It's working hard in the wrong systems. That's the problem. The problems are all systemic yet again. And I've seen so many people that work hard in the right systems.
01:18:42.238 - 01:19:24.990, Speaker A: So I would say in crypto, it's much more meritocratic at this stage. So you work hard, you hustle, you connect with people, you level up, you learn on a weekly basis, you spend time at this, you meet people, you develop some skills, it will pay off. It will lead to a better life, like you will benefit. And so I guess I know if anyone from antiwork is listening, but I think that crypto actually holds some solution to the problem here. People being jaded with their jobs. And isn't it a shame that working hard doesn't lead to a better life now? I think in crypto it can. This is why we're on this journey as well.
01:19:25.060 - 01:19:28.254, Speaker B: Oh, I subscribe to anti work crypto. So I'm hearing you, Ryan.
01:19:28.382 - 01:19:29.460, Speaker A: You hear me?
01:19:29.910 - 01:20:05.198, Speaker B: Okay. Reframed. This is what Chris Berniski said when we had him on the podcast, not the arc podcast, but the one before that, where he said, the returns on capital will always outpace the returns on labor. As in the stock market is going to go up faster than your biweekly paycheck goes into your bank account. The house price that you are looking at is going to go up faster than how fast you can work for your money. And so that's why this headline is saying people no longer believe working hard will lead to a better life because all the assets are outstripped from their hands. And you know why that's an issue? Is because the Federal Reserve prints a bunch of money.
01:20:05.198 - 01:20:35.670, Speaker B: It makes the cost of money easy to benefit all the people with assets. And that's why Ryan is saying that in crypto, your work actually turns into actual capital, because we have a new monetary system with new assets, with new upside. And so when Ryan says the systems, I hear it's the assets. So go and work around the assets that are new and novel and working for you, rather than just like your wage slaves that you find in your typical nine to five job.
01:20:35.820 - 01:20:54.560, Speaker A: Absolutely. Well said, David. All right, let's go to the next one. This is Hayden Adams again, firing some tweets this week with a take. The metaverse is having an account, identity, history, digital assets, et cetera, that can be brought with you wherever you go. That's what the metaverse is, he says, not a bunch of Zuckerberg 3d avatars that hang out in virtual rooms together.
01:20:55.650 - 01:21:03.040, Speaker B: Click on DC's. DC's response is just this metaverse guy thumbs up, clearly out of, like some Facebook thing or something.
01:21:04.130 - 01:21:15.122, Speaker A: Yeah, it's right, though. I mean, we've said it before in our metaverse episode. The metaverse is about property rights. Digital property rights. That's what the metaverse is. It's not like a weird 3d lobby hang out.
01:21:15.176 - 01:21:17.860, Speaker B: I'd rather have a 2d lobby. And that's what Zoom is.
01:21:18.230 - 01:21:34.086, Speaker A: Yeah, that's right. By the way, great episode on the Metaverse earlier this week, too. If you guys want to tune into that, we talk about some of these themes. David, let's end this take with this. Five reasons to be excited for the bear market. You wrote this. This is a post in market muddy and bankless.
01:21:34.086 - 01:21:38.330, Speaker A: I want to be excited about the bear market. Okay, David, tell me, why should I be excited?
01:21:38.670 - 01:21:48.094, Speaker B: This post was so easy to write, and the thoughts I've been having ever since the bull market started is like, oh, wait, the bear market was actually nice. Maybe the stock was.
01:21:48.132 - 01:21:51.710, Speaker A: David. David's been craving the bear market. That's why we're down.
01:21:51.780 - 01:22:30.026, Speaker B: Okay, so here's five reasons to be excited about the bear market. One, long term wealth. One of the most frustrating things about the bull market and when ether was like $4,000 plus is I would take my paycheck and I would go to Gemini, and then I would put in the number and the number of ether that I would get back from that paycheck getting so goddamn small. And I was like, well, what the hell is the point anymore? I can't even move the needle. So that was extremely frustrating. And so now that ether is like, less than half those prices, your money actually translates into more real money, more eth, more eth, more actual money. So it's very, just much more rewarding to be buying prices when they're lower.
01:22:30.026 - 01:22:37.854, Speaker B: And so you actually get to move the needle on the size of your stack. And so I'm looking forward to that again. That's reason number one.
01:22:37.972 - 01:22:43.038, Speaker A: This is when people build generational wealth, generational bear markets. It's not during the people in the.
01:22:43.044 - 01:22:50.274, Speaker B: Bull markets are trying to get wealthy. Like, inside of twelve months, people in the bear market are trying to make their children's children wealthy. That is the difference.
01:22:50.392 - 01:22:58.434, Speaker A: The secret of the bull market is you actually aren't making the money in the bull market. You make money in the bear market as long as you stay for the bear market after the bull market. Okay.
01:22:58.472 - 01:23:30.062, Speaker B: Also, number two, long term relationships. Financial capital. Money is just one flavor of capital. And this is not something that I realized I was doing during the bear market, but it actually has been the most rewarding thing ever since, which is building social capital. Social capital was one of the best things that I earned in the 2018 to 2020 bear market. What is social capital? That's your friends, your Homies, your allies, your business partners. Did you guys know that the way bankless started was that I got good at twitter, I got good at writing, I was in discord all the time.
01:23:30.062 - 01:24:04.186, Speaker B: And at some point I realized that there's this nice guy, Ryan out there, and so I dm'd him and I said hi. And that's how bankless started. And I have so many friends that I made throughout the 2018 2020 bear market. I'm going to people's weddings in countries, and I was invited to people's weddings before I had ever met them in real life. And that can be true for you, too. Build friends in the bear market, because you know that those people that are around in the bear market are the long term people, the long term thinkers, the people that you want to be around, people that you can actually learn from. So build social capital in the bear market.
01:24:04.186 - 01:24:04.826, Speaker B: Do it.
01:24:04.848 - 01:24:11.286, Speaker A: You can do it over the Internet. David and I have never met in person. My mom still doesn't believe that. What's next? David?
01:24:11.318 - 01:24:39.746, Speaker B: Yeah, this lends itself to the same one. The amount of signal during a bear market is significantly higher than the amount of noise. Bull markets are noise dominated markets. Bear markets are signal dominated markets. There are tons of projects that exist in bull markets that exist on just attention and attention alone, not fundamentals. And that is the opposite of what's true in bear markets. Bear markets are only times that only projects with strong fundamentals can survive.
01:24:39.746 - 01:25:05.726, Speaker B: And so just the amount of alpha that you get comes to you and it's kind of shocking. Like, oh, wait, this is just straight, pure alpha. And the reason why no one's taking advantage of this is because it's the bear market. All the bull market tourists are gone, and they're leaving all of the value on the table. For me, that's what should be. Your attitude should be next one up is building. Just long story short, bankless started in the bear market, it's easier to build.
01:25:05.726 - 01:25:29.874, Speaker B: In the bear market, things are quieter. You can put your heads down, you can concentrate, you can think more clearly. There's not a new pumping dog token to pay attention to. It's just easier to build in the bear market. And as a founder, you can find talent better because other people are also in there for the right reasons. They actually care for the right reasons. And then lastly, also overall, the net effect of all of these things is that crypto gets stronger.
01:25:29.874 - 01:25:48.954, Speaker B: Crypto itself is antifragile. What doesn't kill us makes us stronger. And at this point in Crypto's lifespan, there's no way to kill it. We've already won. We have already won the game. It's just a matter of time for waiting for the rest of the world to realize it. And so think about while you are going through this bear market, which I don't think lasts all that long.
01:25:48.954 - 01:25:50.186, Speaker B: So you have six months to do.
01:25:50.208 - 01:25:51.120, Speaker A: All of these things.
01:25:51.810 - 01:26:09.330, Speaker B: What friends will you make? What will you help build? What skills will you develop? What reasons will you create to make you stay in crypto? And so that is why I look forward to building throughout all this bear market with you, if it is really bear, of which I'm not convinced.
01:26:09.750 - 01:26:21.602, Speaker A: Well said, though David is bullish on the bear market. That's the bottom line. And hopefully he's made you more bullish, too. David, what are you excited about? Besides the bear market, you seem to be very excited about?
01:26:21.736 - 01:26:32.714, Speaker B: Okay, I have three things that I'm super excited about, Ryan. One of them, I was quoted in the Washington Post, and I was actually just kind of like cracking up with the Washington Post. Some of the quotes I had that they decided to use, I think were.
01:26:32.752 - 01:26:37.706, Speaker A: Goodbye to all non believers, says David Hoffman, co owner of Bankless, tweeted on.
01:26:37.728 - 01:26:39.862, Speaker B: Sunday as prices continued to plummet.
01:26:39.926 - 01:26:50.800, Speaker A: Listen to this. We were all born in the bear market, so finally we're back home, David says, noting ethereum is now worth $2,400. And last time it was $80.
01:26:52.370 - 01:26:54.430, Speaker B: Oh, God, I love this, man.
01:26:54.500 - 01:26:57.242, Speaker A: It's a great article. Thankless in the Washington Post.
01:26:57.316 - 01:27:08.194, Speaker B: And to summarize it up, I say, obviously no one is happy to see their portfolio shrink 40% in seven days. But it's a question of do you believe that crypto is the dominant financial platform of the future?
01:27:08.312 - 01:27:11.814, Speaker A: My man, calling for conviction. Yeah, that's convicted out there.
01:27:11.932 - 01:27:25.766, Speaker B: All right. Sorry. Next thing I'm excited about, Ryan, is this link that I just sent you in Zoom. If you want to pull that up is that I finally set up my gallery so you can check out all my NFT displays. And so I'm going to wait for Ryan to pull this up. There we go. Boom.
01:27:25.958 - 01:27:26.678, Speaker A: Gallery.
01:27:26.774 - 01:27:30.522, Speaker B: So I recommend that you guys sign up for these. It's a great way.
01:27:30.576 - 01:27:31.702, Speaker A: Are these the crypto coven?
01:27:31.766 - 01:27:52.590, Speaker B: These are the crypto coven of which I think are fantastic, pure straight royalty. There's also my crypto punk. This is my NFT PFP section. There's my crypto punk, my cool cat, my couple of penguins, and also the Dow punks out of bankless dow. But then also if you keep on scrolling down, those are my one of ones from Nate Moeller, who I'm super bullish on. And these are just fantastic. And then if you go down, you have my metaverse plants.
01:27:52.590 - 01:27:59.474, Speaker B: I love plants of all types, including metaverse plants. And so I'm just excited that I got gallery up and running. And then this is awesome.
01:27:59.512 - 01:28:00.342, Speaker A: How hard was that?
01:28:00.396 - 01:28:15.658, Speaker B: Super easy. It's super easy. You just had to sign in with my Ethereum address. And then the last thing I'm excited about is the layer zero that's coming out on Tuesday, of which I did an interview with the two founders of the boys club. And the boys club is all about onboarding women into web three.
01:28:15.744 - 01:28:17.066, Speaker A: Not what it sounds like.
01:28:17.248 - 01:28:42.862, Speaker B: And it's a really funny name and they really lean into the humor behind it. So if you are a lady who is looking to find other ladies to use lady specific language and just onboard people that you know of that are of your vibe into web three, boys club is for you. Check out the layer zero that's coming out on Tuesday. And if you are a dude who's trying to get your lady friend into crypto, maybe send them to the boys club.
01:28:43.006 - 01:28:45.218, Speaker A: Send to the boys club. That's awesome, man.
01:28:45.304 - 01:28:47.954, Speaker B: Thank you for bearing with me through my three things. Ryan, what are you excited about?
01:28:47.992 - 01:28:53.542, Speaker A: Look, I'm excited to show you my gallery. So turtle collection pretty soon because I'm going to fire this baby up.
01:28:53.676 - 01:28:55.670, Speaker B: I'll be excited to see, you know.
01:28:55.740 - 01:29:24.590, Speaker A: The real thing I was excited about was I'm back to this blockscan.com chat. Okay. Because this was, I think, the first time where I actually used my ETH address as an identity to log in and interact with somebody else who also had an ETH address. And there are some fun use case. This is a silly app, but there are some fun use cases from this, like support emails for something you ship an NFT. How do you verify that the person who's owning the NFT is on the other side of a support message.
01:29:24.590 - 01:29:39.122, Speaker A: This could work for that also, like talking to hackers, for instance. But also, if I see an NFt in your gallery that I like, maybe instead of going through Opensea, I just message you on this. I'm like, david, I want to buy some flowers.
01:29:39.186 - 01:29:40.546, Speaker B: Hey, dude, like 0.2 eth.
01:29:40.578 - 01:29:40.918, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:29:41.004 - 01:29:42.626, Speaker B: And I'm like, no, Ryan, two eth.
01:29:42.658 - 01:29:48.920, Speaker A: Two eth, two E. I'm like, I'll give you 0.2 ETH and two turtles. And you're like, yes.
01:29:49.290 - 01:29:51.722, Speaker B: I'm like, no, this is cool.
01:29:51.776 - 01:30:12.846, Speaker A: This is cool. And it just reminded me of the AOL instant messenger days and really excited to see that. It was just a lot of fun, too. A bunch of people reached out and said how much they love bankless. All these messages. I can't wait for all the spam that's going to be incoming in the future. So I'm sure ether scan will add features and make it cooler over time.
01:30:12.846 - 01:30:13.598, Speaker A: But that was great.
01:30:13.684 - 01:30:15.994, Speaker B: New versions of nigerian prints messages.
01:30:16.042 - 01:30:26.526, Speaker A: Well, it's like, look, your ETH address is not just a bank account, it's also your digital identity. And I think this is one small application. We did say, I think 2022 is going to be a breakout year for some early use cases.
01:30:26.558 - 01:30:30.110, Speaker B: People don't anticipate non financial use cases of your private keys.
01:30:30.190 - 01:30:33.734, Speaker A: Yes, that's it. All right, meme of the week time. Let's get to it.
01:30:33.772 - 01:30:34.262, Speaker B: Here we go.
01:30:34.316 - 01:30:34.726, Speaker A: What do we got?
01:30:34.748 - 01:31:12.926, Speaker B: Lyn Alden, Lynn Alden with a meme that almost got 10,000 likes on Twitter. It'll probably be 10,000 likes by this time tomorrow. This is a Simpsons meme of grandpa Simpson talking to all the kids. And grandpa Simpson says, back then, the whole world would stop and listen to one guy say what he was going to do with the price of money. This is what's happening. This is why we're talking about a bear market, is because everyone's talking about, is the Federal Reserve going to make the money more expensive or is it going to make the money more cheap? And everyone's super fearful that the old guys at the Federal Reserve are going to make the money more expensive. The thing I love about this the most is it just strips the way of the curtain.
01:31:12.926 - 01:31:25.080, Speaker B: The emperor without the ropes. This is ridiculous that we listen to these old people behind closed doors, talk to us about what the price of money is. Just let the money price itself is good at that.
01:31:26.490 - 01:31:35.114, Speaker A: Yeah, it's definitely what we do and the way they analyze Jerome Powell's every word and gesture and intonation is painful as well.
01:31:35.152 - 01:31:37.558, Speaker B: But we do that. It's insane.
01:31:37.654 - 01:31:55.086, Speaker A: I hope still doing it several years from now. Guys, stay tuned right after this for your moment of Zen. Thanks a lot. Thanks a lot. It's not for everyone down bad like.
01:31:55.108 - 01:32:11.510, Speaker B: Solana net worth lost the comma, constantly refreshing tvls on Defi llama I only catch knives when I'm trying to catch a bounce from my savings on a JPEG. When I really need a house, need a tax harvest, I got l's I could lend you portfolio pegged to the freaking dollar menu we are headed west.
01:32:14.490 - 01:32:32.102, Speaker A: This is the frontier. It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot. But of course, gotta remind you, none of this has been financial advice. Eth and bitcoin are risky. Defi is risky as well. Sometimes it's extra risky and full of drama.
01:32:32.102 - 01:32:38.686, Speaker A: But we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
