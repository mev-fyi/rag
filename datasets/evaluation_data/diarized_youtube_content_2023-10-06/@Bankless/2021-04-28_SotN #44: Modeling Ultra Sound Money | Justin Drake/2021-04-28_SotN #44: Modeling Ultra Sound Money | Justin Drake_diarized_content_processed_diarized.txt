00:00:07.690 - 00:00:14.762, Speaker A: All right, bankless nation, welcome to another state of the Nation episode. David, what are we talking about today? What's the theme?
00:00:14.906 - 00:00:34.182, Speaker B: We are modeling out ultrasound money. We put out the episode with Justin Drake a while ago, and so now we are getting Justin Drake back onto the show to get into the granular details of what makes ultrasound money. Ultrasound money. There are numbers to discuss, and so we are going to discuss all of them.
00:00:34.316 - 00:00:57.520, Speaker A: There are numbers to discuss. There are models to discuss. There are four different pieces to this. David, you tweeted this out pre episode, and we're going to get into all of them. 25% staking annualized AP supply. Maybe it peaks at 121,000,000 and never gets higher than 120,000,000.
00:00:58.370 - 00:01:01.054, Speaker B: Kisses 120,000,000 and comes back down.
00:01:01.252 - 00:01:36.790, Speaker A: Long term ETH supply target, possibly 100 million. So that's the coming down part. And the potential for sell pressure to be reduced by 90%. Justin Drake has brought the models behind some of those astounding facts that I think very few people have actually looked into. I mean, the first exposure to EIP 15, five nine and to the merge, the staking merge in a comprehensive way, I feel like was almost the podcast that we did with Justin, ultrasound money. Now, that was very metaphor driven. That was very high level to help people understand the narrative.
00:01:36.790 - 00:01:50.462, Speaker A: Now, this is the supporting data. This is the supporting numbers, the supporting financial projections behind all of this. So I'm super excited to dig into this. And David, all time high eth coincidence? I don't know.
00:01:50.596 - 00:01:54.814, Speaker B: I think not, sir. I think it knew this episode was coming.
00:01:54.932 - 00:02:09.174, Speaker A: I choose to believe that as well. All right, David, what's new in the community? Before we get to Justin, got to talk about badges. If you are a bankless premium member, pick up your badge. We've been saying it for two weeks. Definitely do it. Pick up your badge. This is the week we're doing more raffles this week.
00:02:09.174 - 00:02:27.974, Speaker A: So check your email for that email from lucas@banklesshq.com. If you have issues with that email support@banklesshq.com. Also, David, we've got a killer episode coming up on Monday. Do you want to just give a taste of what we're going to cover in that episode?
00:02:28.102 - 00:03:08.754, Speaker B: Yeah, this episode makes some very bold claims. We like to make bold claims on the Bankless podcast, but this one is brand new Josh Rosenthal, who is probably a name that most people aren't familiar with, but he is a historian of european art, money, wealth, history. And we make the claim that we are on the cusp of a digital renaissance that is equal to or larger than what the renaissance that came in the 14 hundreds. And the connections here are in the 14 hundreds. We invented the Gutenberg press printing press. Thank you. And also double entry bookkeeping.
00:03:08.754 - 00:03:37.454, Speaker B: And in the modern day, the printing press is now the modern day Internet, and the modern day double entry bookkeeping is blockchain. And that actually is unlocking a brand new renaissance, a crypto renaissance. And he did a fantastic job just going through the history and drawing the parallels. We talk about renaissance meme culture. Meme culture actually started perhaps in the 14 hundreds. We talked about the parallels between Martin Luther and Satoshi, and we talk about. So cool, so cool.
00:03:37.454 - 00:03:42.338, Speaker B: And so there's a lot of awesome through lines here. And it's actually already been one of my favorite episodes come out of the.
00:03:42.344 - 00:04:20.766, Speaker A: Bank when we were recording that, David, I just like goosebumps almost the entire time when Josh was speaking, just talking about these various parallels between kind of the old renaissance and this renaissance. So be sure to check that out. Bankless nation as well. David, Dharma is still cooking some things up. They wanted us to let you know that they have now rolled the Dharma app out. They have a direct connection to your bank account in all 50 states in the US. And, David, when people ask, like, me, about DFI, especially my friends, who don't know much about them, I'm increasingly pointing them to start with the Dharma app, because that is a great onboarding experience.
00:04:20.766 - 00:04:28.238, Speaker A: Direct from their bank account to Defi in one tap. Super cool. Anything else you want to say about dharma?
00:04:28.334 - 00:04:47.030, Speaker B: Yeah, we know retail season is coming, and dharma is probably the best place to send retail who are still looking for that kind of tradfi experience of just good ux. But it's defi in the back, right? And so one tap separates you between your dollars in your bank account and ultrasound money on.
00:04:47.180 - 00:04:57.130, Speaker A: Ooh, dharma IO. Guys, check that out. Download the app. All right, David, I'm going to ask you the question I ask at the beginning of every state of the nation. What is the state of the nation today, sir?
00:04:57.280 - 00:05:24.194, Speaker B: The state of the nation. It was going to be bullish, Ryan, but I was. But we've used that before. And I was chatting with Justin before the show, and he asked him for inspiration or ideas about what the state of the nation is, and he said, ultra bullish. And so the state of the nation today is ultra bullish, as you can see. If you go and look at the ETH price chart as well, what will be an ultra bullish episode coming to your ears in just a moment.
00:05:24.312 - 00:05:56.302, Speaker A: You know what's crazy, dude? I have two emails waiting for me. One is an 80 page report on why ether is sound money, and the other is an institutional report. These just came out today. An institutional report, I should say, around ether as an asset. Ultra bullish that the narrative is spreading both in institutional side and the story of ether. The asset is spreading among analysts, too. So I've got tons of reading to do, but it's all ultra bullish news.
00:05:56.436 - 00:06:14.306, Speaker B: And it all feeds back to what Justin presented to us the first time around with ultrasound money. Right? So much of those reports tie into the ultrasound money thesis, and so, you know, tip of the hat to Justin for really pioneering this message, and I'm absolutely stoked to bring him onto the podcast. And here in a second, this is.
00:06:14.328 - 00:06:30.922, Speaker A: What bankless is doing. Helping to develop the narrative layer, the meme layer, also helping to spread the education of what these bankless systems are doing in the real world. We're going to get to Justin in just a minute, but before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:06:31.056 - 00:07:06.674, Speaker B: Bankless is proud to be supported by Uniswap. Uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure. Instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans, Uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on Ethereum, which is what Ryan and I call a money robot. No human counterparties or centralized intermediaries, just autonomous code on ethereum. Input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy. Something brand new in the Uniswap ecosystem is the Uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants. We have been saying this for a while, and we'll say it again.
00:07:06.674 - 00:07:34.702, Speaker B: Daos have money and they are in need of labor. If you think that you have something to contribute to the Uniswap Dow, apply for a grant to Uniswap. Just look at the size of the Uniswap treasury. It's almost $3 billion. This mountain of capital is looking for labor. Do you have something of value to contribute to the Uniswap Dow? No matter how big or small your idea is, you can apply for a uni grant@unigrants.org and help steer Uniswap in the direction that you think it should go.
00:07:34.702 - 00:08:12.294, Speaker B: That's exactly what we did to get Uniswap to be a sponsor for bankless, and you can do the same for your project. Thank you. Uniswap for sponsoring bankless, Balancer is Defi's most powerful automated market maker. Typical Amms just have two tokens inside of one liquidity pool, which can lead to fractured liquidity across the many pairs. In Defi, with Balancer, you can access the full power of multiple tokens inside of one single amm, which unlocks an entirely new playing field of possibility. This makes Balancer an awesome building block for so many different use cases. Balancer pools can make asset indexes, but instead of paying fees to portfolio managers, Balancer lets you collect fees from traders who use your portfolio for liquidity.
00:08:12.294 - 00:08:58.710, Speaker B: Additionally, balancer smart pools can be programmed to have properties that change according to predetermined rules, such as changing the swap fee based on market conditions or even liquidity bootstrapping pools, which can help you launch and distribute your token with day one liquidity. At bankless, we used a liquidity bootstrapping pool to sell our Bap t shirts to much success. Balancer V two brings powerful new features that makes your money work even harder for you. In V two, idle tokens are capable of generating yield in DFI without sacrificing liquidity in the pool. To top things off, Balancer is reimbursing all gas costs with valve rewards, meaning that all your gas costs are returned to your wallet. With the balancer governance token, Balancer's mission is to become the primary source of liquidity in DeFi by providing the most flexible and powerful platform for asset management and decentralized exchange. Dive into the balancer pools at Pools.
00:08:58.790 - 00:09:26.482, Speaker A: Balancer exchange bankless nation welcome back. We have Justin Drake back on the podcast again. This is the third podcast video show recording that we are doing with Justin. He of course, is an ethereum researcher. He was on two podcasts with us previously. One is on ultrasound money, the other was on cryptography, both incredibly important episodes for you to listen to and understand. Part of the bankless canon now.
00:09:26.482 - 00:09:28.260, Speaker A: Justin, how are you doing today?
00:09:28.710 - 00:09:29.780, Speaker C: Doing great.
00:09:30.550 - 00:10:26.818, Speaker A: We are excited about this episode and we're going to be sharing some models that you put together in a few minutes around some of the concepts that we really dove into quite deeply. In the ultrasound Money podcast, we're going to put some numbers behind some of the concepts we were talking about. But before we do, I feel like we need to maybe ground the audience again in understanding ether as an asset. And of course, we talked about the properties that are coming online for ether soon, in particular EIP 15 five nine, which adds a fee burn component and also the advent of full proof of stake and the shutting off of proof of work. We're calling that the merge. Those are all important concepts in the case for ultrasound money. But there's also another analogy that I think bankless listeners are familiar with that we want to get into here.
00:10:26.818 - 00:11:07.550, Speaker A: And that is the analogy of ETH as a triple point asset that David and I have used so often before. And the concept of ETH as a triple point asset is similar to sort of the states of matter that people might have learned about in science. I don't know, 7th grade science, eigth grade science, wherever you learned about that, perhaps lower as well. And the concept is that matter can be one of three states. It can be a solid, it can be a liquid, and it can be a gas. And ether as an asset can also be one of three states. It can be a solid, so it can be staked as a capital asset.
00:11:07.550 - 00:11:57.380, Speaker A: It can also be liquid, so it can be used as a money, and it can also be used as a gas, so it can be used as a combustible consumption. Good to purchase ether block space. So that is the triple point asset thesis and the triple point asset model for money, which we have used. And it's kind of cool because it maps very directly to the asset superclasses. Like an asset can either be a capital asset or a money or a commodity, and ether can be all three of those. You have now extended that metaphor a little bit with a new analogy, adding sort of this temperature dimension to ether as a triple point asset. Can we start there? Can we dig into that? So tell us about the temperature analogy you wanted to share with the bankless community.
00:11:58.630 - 00:13:00.870, Speaker C: Yeah. So I think the temperature metaphor is, as you said, a generalization of the triple point assets. So not only can we look at the individual state of, let's say, water, that will represent money efer, but we can look at more fine grained temperatures. So, for example, money, you could have money as a long term investment, which is kept cold in the fridge. So that's kind of cold money. Or you could have hot money, which is, for example, if you're a day trader, or if you're an exchange processing lots of withdrawals and deposits in a hot wallet. And I think the reason why this temperature of money metaphor is useful in the context of ultrasound money is that really there's three big consequences of EIP 1559 and the merge, and they each affect a different state of water.
00:13:00.870 - 00:14:02.620, Speaker C: So there's one key innovation that improves the kind of liquid money, as it were. There's one which improves the characteristics of the solid money, and one that improves the characteristics of gas money. And one of the interesting things, I guess, is that, as you say, ethereum is this unique asset. It's a triple point asset in the sense that in addition to being this money, in this narrow band between zero degrees celsius and 100 degrees celsius, it's capable of breaking boundaries which were not previously broken. So it can break down the zero degree and kind of freeze itself, but it can also break down the 100 degree kind of threshold and vaporize. So that's the analogy of having gas and literally vaporizing it, just like you would vaporize gasoline when you consume it, it leaves the system into the ether. So, yeah.
00:14:02.620 - 00:14:29.646, Speaker C: Looking forward to kind of explain, what are these three key changes to the cash flows. Right. So, in the previous episode, we had the energy metaphor. We had energy in the form of electric energy going through the various components. And the reason why I chose the electricity metaphor is because I wanted to focus on the components. There was these three components. There was the battery, there was the engine, and there was the solar panel.
00:14:29.646 - 00:14:50.730, Speaker C: But here, I really want to focus on the asset and on the cash flows. And as you said, I think this episode is all about modeling the cash flows and understanding how big they are and how they circulate and what are the consequences, maybe, for total supply, what are the consequences in terms of sell pressure, et cetera, et cetera.
00:14:51.630 - 00:15:08.800, Speaker B: So, Justin, let's hash out this temperature metaphor just a little bit more. So, we have ether as a capital asset. We have ether as a store of value, and we have ether as a transformable, consumable asset. How do these map on to the three phases of matter?
00:15:10.610 - 00:15:36.006, Speaker C: Right? So maybe the easiest one to understand is the solid state, right? So when you have ether and you lock it, you're essentially freezing it because you're really reducing the velocity of money. You're putting it in deep freeze. And one great example of this is staking in the context of the beacon chain. Right. When you want to unstake, there's a defrosting period, if you will.
00:15:36.108 - 00:15:37.798, Speaker B: A thawing period. Right.
00:15:37.964 - 00:16:14.334, Speaker C: A thawing period. Exactly. Thank you. And we're also seeing this in the context of defi, where you have the notion of total value locked, like the locked at the l, kind of suggests that there's some freezing going on. It's a spectrum. Like, different defi applications might have different temperatures. So, for example, uniswap might be somewhere maybe close to the freezing point or just past the freezing point, in the sense that the efer in uniswap technically can be removed with a single transaction.
00:16:14.334 - 00:16:46.240, Speaker C: And actually, if you want to sell ERC 20 for e, you can do that immediately. But what we've observed, kind of on a holistic standpoint, is that the collateral is sticky, right? So we did have things like the vampire attack with sushi swap, where liquidity would go from one place to another, but it still stayed within the realm of dexes or the realm of defi. If you look at total value locked on defi pools, it just goes up only.
00:16:47.650 - 00:17:36.000, Speaker B: And we also can talk about the metaphor of Makerdao, right? So, like, ether is collateral inside of Makerdao. And in theory, ether in Makerdao is also just one transaction away from becoming liquid on the secondary markets. But when we look at a systems level perspective, maker Dow has over $3 billion worth of dai preventing that ether from becoming thought, right? So that ether in makerdao is stuck behind a $3 billion dye supply that is keeping that ether being used as a cold store of value. It's frozen in its place, right. And so in the ether in Makerdao, we would be frozen ether, very cold ether, right? Not liquid, not available to the secondary market, and definitely not being burned because it's not being used as transaction money. It's just cold ether frozen, right?
00:17:36.690 - 00:17:52.610, Speaker C: Yeah, that's exactly right. I mean, if you place your ether as collateral and you take a die loan, for example, to buy a car or to buy a house, your income is going to allow you to gradually repay that loan, but it might take a decade for you to repay your maker loan.
00:17:54.710 - 00:18:43.474, Speaker A: If we're painting the holistic picture here, right? So we're almost looking at this whole spectrum of temperature mapping to ether, the asset. And on the far left side of the spectrum, what we're talking about is ether. If we're thinking of ether as like, say, water, it's below zero degrees celsius. So it is frozen, but there are degrees of how frozen it can be. And I'm guessing that you might say, justin, that the far side, the coldest ether can actually get is when it's staked, right? It's not slushy, it's not in this in between area. It's like deep freeze, very cold, locked inside of the staking contract. And maybe ether locked in DFI might be a little right to that.
00:18:43.474 - 00:18:52.280, Speaker A: So it might be like negative ten degrees celsius or so, and getting close to the thawing point, something like that.
00:18:52.890 - 00:19:27.010, Speaker C: So actually, you can go even more extreme than staking so you could, for example, artificially put some sort of time lock on your e. You could say, I'm going to lock my e for ten years. I'm going to create a smart contract that does that. They're kind of artificial and no one really does it. But in theory you could do it. But there's something that does happen naturally, and that's the process of losing coins or accidentally sending them to the zero address. So that's kind of zero degrees Kelvin is like maximum negative temperature.
00:19:27.010 - 00:20:06.686, Speaker C: And it's interesting because you've taken money and you've made it so cold that you've denatured money. It's no longer money, right? Technically, it's a balance somewhere, but it's no longer money. It's denatured because you can't move it anymore. It's frozen forever. And you could say the same thing, for example, for the Parity multisig wallet. So there's this very famous bug where there's basically over half a million e, which is provably at zero degrees Kelvin. And yeah, it's basically no longer money.
00:20:06.686 - 00:20:46.874, Speaker C: And the interesting thing is that when you go at the opposite end of the spectrum, you have very, very similar behavior. Because on the hot side of things, on the boiling temperatures, you're basically destroying ef. You're vaporizing it and removing it from the supply. So you kind of have the spectrum. And it turns out that on each extremes you have very similar behaviors. You're basically improving the monetary qualities of efer. Right? Because on the cold side of things, you're kind of taking liquidity, like literally liquid liquidity, and you're kind of freezing it and slowing it down.
00:20:46.874 - 00:21:36.790, Speaker C: And on the other hand, you're kind of vaporizing it and having it leave the supply. And this is kind of a geeky kind of math analogy, but I studied mathematics, so I'll share it. So when you do projective geometry, you have a line that goes negative infinity all the way on that side and that side. And you introduce this one point called the point at infinity, where basically these two lines meet at the point of infinity. So you can kind of think of it as a circle and kind of from a monetary standpoint, the two extremes are really the same place. The same place. And the interesting thing about Ethereum is that you can think of it as a machine to take this liquid money and push it to the extremes.
00:21:36.790 - 00:21:57.060, Speaker C: On the one hand, you're incentivizing this liquid money to become frozen. And on the other hand, you have this other mechanism where you're incentivizing this liquid money to vaporize. And so these are two very strong kind of scarcity engines that will suck out all the liquidity in its liquid state.
00:21:57.750 - 00:22:08.374, Speaker A: And by vaporize, what you're talking about is essentially literally being burnt through EIP 15 five nine. That's it becoming vaporized, right? Yeah.
00:22:08.412 - 00:22:10.310, Speaker C: So this is what I mean by vaporized.
00:22:14.970 - 00:22:22.938, Speaker A: Drake today brought his own sound effects. That was the sound of Ether being vaporized in EIP 15 five nine.
00:22:23.104 - 00:22:25.750, Speaker B: Okay, go ahead, Justin.
00:22:25.910 - 00:22:33.120, Speaker C: Yeah, post EIP 1559. Every time you make a transaction, you should imagine this sound in your head.
00:22:35.010 - 00:23:33.758, Speaker B: And that's one of three sound effects that we have on standby. And I want to make sure the listeners are up to speed with why we're talking about this temperature metaphor, because we're about to go into excel sheets and perhaps talk less about metaphors and talk more about numbers. But the metaphor is really, really useful to hold in our brains as we model this thing out, both as a model with numbers, but also a model for understanding these things. And I think what we just finished on right there is a fantastic through line. Me, I'm picturing a cylinder, like a test tube cylinder, and we have the hot water at the top, and we have the frozen water at the bottom, then the liquid water in the middle. And that composes, like, the ethereum system as a whole, right? Boiling water up at the top, which is the ether being used as transaction fees, and then some of that being vaporized and leaving the system. And then also we have ether being in deep freeze state in cryo at the very, very bottom, which is eth locked in defi and eth being staked.
00:23:33.758 - 00:24:31.950, Speaker B: And the through line here is that currently in ethereum, we have a very liquid center, and there's not that much boiling off the top, and there's not that much frozen at the bottom. But that's what is all about to change when we introduce EIP 1559, which really starts to turn on the boiler at the top. And a lot of ether is being vaporized up at the top. And we are also introducing staking, which is freezing a lot of ether at the bottom of the cylinder by incentivizing ether to be locked in the staking contract. And then there's also something to talk about with being locked in defi. That's like the slushy ether, the half melted half knot. But what's really changing is that this liquid center where there is what Justin, you've called a fire hose of water being added into the system, which is ether issuance from proof of work, is actually going to be constricted into perhaps just a much more modest garden hose.
00:24:31.950 - 00:24:53.820, Speaker B: And that liquid center is actually going to become much smaller in relationship to what is being boiled off the top and what is being frozen down at the bottom. And so this temperature frame of reference is, we're going to come back to this throughout the rest of this episode as we talk about some of these numbers, more explicit numbers, as we model out ultrasound money. Justin, do you want to add anything to that?
00:24:55.070 - 00:25:24.866, Speaker C: Yeah, so I kind of want to highlight the three cash flows that are, I think, important for this discussion. The first cash flow you mentioned, it is issuance. So issuance is you have just new liquidity that comes out of the sky. And right now it's a huge amount of issuance. It's like, as you said, it's this fire hose of liquidity, and the market has to bear with. It's like this huge amount of sell pressure. It's costly to run proof of work.
00:25:24.866 - 00:25:51.530, Speaker C: One of the big innovations of proof of stake is what I called economic efficiency. In the previous protocol, we're reducing by, let's say, ten x the cost of consensus. So that's cash flow number one, issuance. Cash flow number two is related to this warm side, this hot side of the spectrum, the burning. It's supply. Right. So we have a new mechanism to reduce supply.
00:25:51.530 - 00:26:37.014, Speaker C: And this is kind of where ultrasound money meme came from, right, because we have deflation. But really, the ultrasound money is a very holistic meme with strong fundamentals, with many pillars. This deflation aspect is just one of them, one which is easy to communicate in this kind of catchphrase. If bitcoin sound money, then ETH is ultrasound money. So that's cash flow number two supply. Cash flow number one was issuance. Now, cash flow number three is basically the ETH as collateral, and, like, how much ETH will be drawn out from this liquid center and kind of frozen.
00:26:37.014 - 00:27:16.274, Speaker C: And basically what we have here is when we have the merge, the transaction fees will be in two parts. One part will be burnt. We've already talked about this, but another part, which is the tip, is not burnt, and that goes directly to the validators. And so that will increase the staking APR, and that's basically going to increase the power of the freezer. Right. We're going to go from minus five degrees to minus ten degrees. Or I guess the APR could be like the degrees that you're targeting.
00:27:16.274 - 00:27:36.720, Speaker C: So we're going to set it, let's say at -25 degrees. Right. So that's a 25% apr, and it's going to be so cold that it's going to freeze a lot of the neighboring liquidity. So, yeah, these are the three cash flows that we could highlight one by one.
00:27:37.810 - 00:28:18.410, Speaker A: Before we get to all of that, can we talk about the part that we haven't talked about in depth very much, which is sort of this liquid piece right in the middle? So we talked about the freeze side that is staked eth. Frozen eth, eth used in collateral. We talked about the burn side that is it being vaporized via EIP 15, five nine. And of course, we use that analogy of new liquidity is coming into the system via issuance right now. And right now there's a lot of issuance, like 4.2% or something. Issuance annualized per year is coming into this squishy middle part.
00:28:18.410 - 00:28:39.998, Speaker A: There's not a lot staked and there's nothing being burnt. So we don't have the engine and we don't have the deep freezer. Let's talk about this middle portion, because that's mostly what we mean when we talk about money. Right. It's kind of liquid. It can be used as a store of value. It can be used as a medium of exchange.
00:28:39.998 - 00:28:53.320, Speaker A: It can be used as a unit of account. It can actually be spent. Is there anything more we need to talk about in this liquid phase, or do we just need to hear the sound effect? Justin, you tell us.
00:28:54.170 - 00:28:57.400, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the sound effect is very important. So let's go ahead.
00:28:59.050 - 00:29:00.818, Speaker A: This is the liquid phase.
00:29:00.994 - 00:29:30.366, Speaker C: Yes. So we have 100 million ether, roughly, which is in this liquid phase. If we remove the 3 million, sorry, 4 million now in the deposit contract and the ether locked in DFI. So we have this 100 million pool, which is slushing. And as you said, ether is used as money. It's used as money in the context of nfTs. It's used as money in the context of trading.
00:29:30.366 - 00:30:01.422, Speaker C: It's a unit of liquidity. Right on uniswap. Like 95% of the volume is eve pairs. And one of the interesting things is that this traditional power of being money is what bitcoin has explored. Right. So you can think of bitcoin as exploring this range from zero to 100. And with Ethereum, we can really push the limits, as I mentioned.
00:30:01.422 - 00:30:51.830, Speaker C: But, yeah, within this liquid phase, we have all the various use cases for Ethereum, but we have this kind of internality, this externality, I guess, which is that the issuance is this necessary evil that we have to deal with, and it's flooding us, and we're drowning in liquidity at the moment. And this issuance is representing a huge amount of sell pressure. We're talking tens of millions of dollars every day. And so one of the things for which we have a spreadsheet is looking at the sell pressure and how much it will be reduced, and we're talking billions of dollars of relief from the cell pressure.
00:30:51.910 - 00:31:07.598, Speaker A: Okay, guys, so that's the metaphor going into the models, and just quick recap, and we'll do it with sounds. So right now, Justin, you said there's about 100 million or so of the total supply of ETH, and I don't know the total supply of ETh up top of my head. 115,000,000.
00:31:07.684 - 00:31:08.494, Speaker B: 115,000,000?
00:31:08.532 - 00:31:26.594, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, let's say 115,000,000. Total supply of ETH right now, 100 million is liquid. What does that sound like? That's our 100 million eth liquid. The vast majority of it, the bulk. Now we're starting to get some eth that's frozen. It's frozen in the staking contract.
00:31:26.594 - 00:31:40.380, Speaker A: I'm going to say 6 million or so frozen in the staking contract. We also have some ETH frozen in DFI. 4 million frozen in the ETH. Staking contract. Justin's correcting me. We have some ETH in Defi as well. What does that sound like?
00:31:44.830 - 00:31:50.462, Speaker C: So you sort of imagine the water becoming ice and imagining that.
00:31:50.516 - 00:32:05.330, Speaker A: I'm also imagining my childhood in the cold winters of Canada Chester, when I hear that. All right, and we have not yet fired up the furnaces. We have not yet started to burn eth. But remind us again, what's that going to sound like when we start burning?
00:32:09.530 - 00:32:11.350, Speaker B: Sizzle sizzling.
00:32:11.930 - 00:32:38.686, Speaker A: EIP 15. Five, nine. Okay. All right, so that is the setup, guys. Let's dive into the numbers. And there are four models that you've put out recently, and I think maybe, Justin, you could give us some context on why you created these models and how you came up with them. But for those that are watching and listening to this, I'm going to quickly go over them at a high level.
00:32:38.686 - 00:32:50.126, Speaker A: One, we're going to look at the ETH peak supply model, and you're claiming that EtH peak supply could be 120,000,000. No more than 121,000,000 ETH ever created.
00:32:50.158 - 00:32:53.140, Speaker B: Where 120,000,000, not 120,000,000.
00:32:53.990 - 00:33:33.706, Speaker A: I keep saying it's the bitcoiner in me, Justin. 120,000,000 could be ETH peak supply right now at 115. So we're going to get into that model. That's model one. Model two, is the road actually going backward in time, going back in terms of supply, the road back to 100 million, because again, we're going to start burning ETH and we might be able to reduce over the next decade 20% of the total supply of ETH. What's that burning sound again, Justin? Got to hear that burn vaporizing from 120,000,000 to 100 million. That's model two.
00:33:33.706 - 00:34:11.670, Speaker A: We'll get into model three is we'll get into the net buy pressure. So David was talking about we have issuance of about 4.2% that is feeding this fat middle. There's 100 million supply ETH with 4% issuance or so per year that is getting greatly restricted. So we're going to talk about the implications of sell pressure reduced in ether on ethereum by as much as 90%. That's model three. And the last model we're going to talk about is the incentive for individuals and for people who own ETH to freeze their ETH.
00:34:11.670 - 00:34:40.200, Speaker A: And that is a staking APY that is getting massively increased to possibly 25%. We'll talk about how that's even possible because it's not coming from issuance, it's coming from transaction fees. And this is the first time I've actually seen transaction fees added to the Revenue cash flows that stakers receive. So we're going to go through those four models. Before we do, Justin, is there anything else? Like, why did you come up with these models in the first place? Tee these up for us.
00:34:41.930 - 00:35:28.706, Speaker C: Right. We've had these big structural changes with EIp one five nine coming and the merge coming. But I wanted to quantify things. And I think the big story, really, of the last few months is that we have one kind of mega cash flow, which is the transaction fees. And that's the root of everything, really, because it unlocks the high apr when you're staking, it unlocks the burn. And I just wanted to see, okay, what were the numbers? Because no one was talking about it. So one number that I was personally very surprised by was the 25% staking APR.
00:35:28.706 - 00:36:09.810, Speaker C: And we can talk about the consequences there, I guess, in terms of the supply. In my original little graphic, which introduced ultrasound money, I had this projected kind of cap, very conservative cap at two to the 27. And I just like powers of two because you don't have to bike shed too much, two to the 28 was clearly too high. Two to 26 was clearly too low. Like, two to 27 was the right kind of binary order of magnitude. But people were kind of confused, like, why did he choose two to 27? It's not a good meme number. It's a bit too geeky.
00:36:09.810 - 00:36:56.386, Speaker C: So it's like, okay, let's try and refine this to the closest million. And it turns out we can refine it to the closest 10 million. And the spreadsheet kind of suggests that we will never hit 120,000,000. We'll be able to peak under it. And then basically, once we have the merge, the total supply can go down. And then the reason why I created this other spreadsheet, like the road back down to 100 million e, is because 100 million is kind of a nice meme number. And I was wondering, okay, is it actually feasible for us to start at 120 and then go back down to 100 million? And the answer is yes.
00:36:56.386 - 00:37:47.774, Speaker C: It might take a decade, it might take two decades, but it is definitely possible to have the total supply go back down to 100. And 100 million kind of has a bit of historical significance because Vitalik at some point had this Reddit post where he was making projections around the difficulty bombing. He said, it's possible we'll never hit 100 million. And then we crossed 100 million, and then all the bitcoin maxis were like, ha ha, you have no supply cap, Internet supply, blah, blah, blah. Well, it's possible this kind of like the revenge of the 100 million where we're going back to 100 million. And then the other thing that actually the very first spreadsheet that I created was around it was actually in preparation for our previous podcast. So the sell pressure.
00:37:47.774 - 00:38:23.778, Speaker C: Right. In the previous podcast, I said that EIP 1559 and the merge combined is going to be the equivalent in terms of reducing sell pressure of both the deposit contract and grayscale combined. So 7.2 million e annually, right. So it's like a huge amount of relief in terms of sell pressure that we're going to have from these two kind of economic innovations, Sci-Fi economics, the EIP 1559 and emerge.
00:38:23.974 - 00:39:02.058, Speaker A: Okay, let's dive into it now then, Justin. This, of course, is the meme brought to life with numbers, with an actual model, a projection of supply and the economic implications. What would happen? Let's go to the first model, which is a spreadsheet that people will find in the show notes. Of course, if you're watching on YouTube, you'll find this in the show notes on YouTube. This is a spreadsheet you put together for a model of ETH peak supply. And the claim in this spreadsheet is pretty simple. There may never be more than 120,000,000 ETH in existence ever again.
00:39:02.058 - 00:39:26.500, Speaker A: It's back to this diagram. We might hit a point where we go ultrasound, we grow eth supply, and then it might bend back downward, and that point might be 120,000,000. Can you explain some of the variables behind this scenario and why 120,000,000? It's an estimate, of course, but it's almost a conservative estimate as well. Get into this for us.
00:39:27.190 - 00:39:58.250, Speaker C: Absolutely. So the way that you predict supply is quite easy. You look at the supply today, and then you basically add the daily supply. And there's various things that will influence the daily issuance. I mean, that will influence the daily issuance. So right now, the daily issuance is composed of two things. Number one is the proof of work issuance, which is about 13,600.
00:39:58.250 - 00:40:53.550, Speaker C: It's actually a little bit below that. So I've put 13,550. And then we have the daily proof of stake issuance, which is, I think, around 800 e per day. But I put 1000 e there in the best guess because that's going to be the average between now and the merge. And then there's these key dates that are right. The key date, number one, is when will EIP 1559 be activated? Because from that point onwards, there's going to be a huge relief in sell pressure because part of the fees, which will normally go to the miners and be converted into electricity and electricity bills and know it's, like, forcefully sold economically. It's forcefully sold, will now instead be burnt and not sold.
00:40:53.550 - 00:41:35.558, Speaker C: So right now, the current plan that was announced a few days ago by Tim and the whole crew is 14 July 2021. But, of course, we could slip. We've slipped many times. And so my conservative date for EIP 1559 is the 14 August 2021. And the reason why I've put it there is because we actually have to hard fork. And the reason we have to hard fork is because there's this difficulty bomb, which will stretch the block times. And so it's a necessity.
00:41:35.558 - 00:41:46.058, Speaker C: And at this point in time, the devs have extremely high confidence that EIP 1559 will go in this fork coming up in London.
00:41:46.234 - 00:42:29.798, Speaker A: So, Justin, the variables that really drive the difference between what you're calling the best guess, the more leaning conservative guess, and the conservative guess are the activation date for EIP 15, five nine, which is targeted for July but could stretch into August possibly, maybe, likely not later. Also the merge date. So that's the date at which proof of work goes away and proof of stake becomes the consensus engine for the entirety of ethereum. The proof of work issuance. That's going to not really an assumption. That's pretty static. That's definitely baked in daily average pos, proof of stake issuance.
00:42:29.798 - 00:42:53.780, Speaker A: That could vary some, but that feels pretty secure as an assumption as well. This other one, average daily fee burn. So there's kind of a range on that. On the conservative side, it looks like there's an average fee burn of about 3000 per day eth per day. And on the best guess side, it's about 6000. What are we burning per day right now? Is it closer to 6000?
00:42:54.630 - 00:42:56.130, Speaker C: Well, right now we're not burning.
00:42:56.210 - 00:42:57.762, Speaker A: Excuse me, not burning theory.
00:42:57.826 - 00:42:58.150, Speaker B: Right.
00:42:58.220 - 00:43:00.486, Speaker A: I meant in transaction fees. Yes.
00:43:00.588 - 00:43:33.620, Speaker C: Right. So the 100 day and 30 day and even seven day moving average are 12,000 e per day. Okay. And then the 365 day moving average, which is like the really conservative one, which spans a very long stretch of time, is at 7.5 thousand e per day. But as I see it, the total amount of transaction fees per day is one of these metrics, which is quite volatile. But directionally it's up only.
00:43:33.620 - 00:44:03.180, Speaker C: So let's say 10,000 e per day with a 70% or let's say 60% fee burn. Then that's how you would arrive at the 6000 e per day, like the conservative one. 3000 e per day. I just don't see how it could go below 3000 e per day given that we have 10,000 e per day in transaction fees and there's no way the fee burn will be 30%.
00:44:03.710 - 00:44:28.930, Speaker A: And then. So, Justin, based on these assumptions, we get a best guess case where we have about 118, call it million eth in total supply. Max total supply. Right. Because at this point in time it's going to start bending down and we're going to start burning more than we're issuing. Right. That's the best guess side of things.
00:44:28.930 - 00:44:38.790, Speaker A: If you were a bit more conservative, we get to a number that's closer to 120,000,000 ETH as the max supply.
00:44:40.570 - 00:45:21.326, Speaker C: Absolutely. Yeah. And the lean conservative is 119,000,000. So yeah, I'm expecting we'll peak between 118,000,120 million. And as you said, from the point of the merge until kind of the foreseeable future, we will deflate very likely every single day the supply will go down and down and down. And the reason is that proof of stake is so damn efficient, you need very little issuance to run the proof of stake, and so even a moderate amount of transaction fees will more than compensate for the issuance.
00:45:21.518 - 00:45:33.174, Speaker B: Justin, it's your belief that after EIP 1559 and the merge that there's no way that we are not burning more ether than we are issuing. You seem like you have complete confidence in that.
00:45:33.372 - 00:45:49.660, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm going to say 99% confidence that at the point of the merge, we're going down. And I have high confidence, let's say 95% confidence that for the years to come, let's say ten years, we're going to be going down pretty much every single day.
00:45:49.970 - 00:46:52.590, Speaker A: This is a massive narrative buster, because I think a lot of people have heard the narrative that ETh supply is infinite, that it has no cap. Right. What's the difference between those narratives and what you're showing in the model? Because I think people even hearing this are so used to hearing the narrative being told that Eth supply is infinite, Eth has no cap whatsoever. ETh will continue to issue more and more into the future. What's the difference between those narratives and the model here? Because I think people who are hearing this might still have a hard time, I guess, rationalizing the difference here, because this is not the narrative that is in mainstream. Few know about this. I'm not sure how many people have actually worked through the numbers and have a model like this in their mind, but it has to be not very many.
00:46:52.590 - 00:46:54.400, Speaker A: So can you talk about that?
00:46:55.330 - 00:47:51.780, Speaker C: Right, so at any given point in time, the eave supply is finite, and there's always been a constraint on issuance. Right. At Genesis, it started at five e per block, and we've always respected that constraint. We've gone down to three e for block and two e for block. But we've always been constrained from day one. Now, the claim that E has no cap is actually technically correct, and the reason is that in theory, if there was no fee burn and purely just issuance from proof of stake, we would just grow every single year. Now, it turns out that with proof of stake, you can have a provable cap, which is under a million e.
00:47:51.780 - 00:48:48.180, Speaker C: The plan right now is to basically cap the reward beyond 33 and a half million e stakes. So beyond that point, there won't be any more supply, and that represents roughly a 1 million e issuance maximum per year. But in practice, what's likely going to happen is that we're going to be burning significantly more than 1 million e per year, at least for the foreseeable future. And so in practice, not only are we going to have a finite supply which is de facto capped, it's not in theory capped, but it's de facto capped. But it's even better than a supply cap, it's a decreasing cap. And this is where the ultrasound, the ultra, comes in.
00:48:48.650 - 00:49:07.530, Speaker B: I think what we get to do with this narrative where many bitcoin maxis will come and say that ether has no supply cap, but now with proof of stake and EiP 1559, we get to say, well, there's no supply floor, it could just keep on going down, it could go in the opposite direction and there's nothing to stop it from going.
00:49:07.600 - 00:49:09.260, Speaker A: Equally true, isn't it?
00:49:09.870 - 00:49:12.814, Speaker C: There's no supply floor. Fantastic. Yes.
00:49:13.012 - 00:49:56.860, Speaker A: All right, well, let's go to the second model here. So the first claim was there may never be more than 120,000,000 ETH. And this is the model that kind of shows it. The second claim is, I think, equally interesting, but is also part of the first claim in that the supply might be going down and it might go down as low as 100 million in a relatively short period of time. So walk us through the model where we get to 100 million ETH supply, a decrease of like 20 million from 120,000,000 in twelve years time.
00:49:58.190 - 00:50:49.146, Speaker C: Right. So I was asking myself, can we reach this meme number of 100 million ETH in supply? And basically there's three key parameters or assumptions that you need to set. The first one is how much Eth is being staked. And here you can take kind of the maximally conservative approach, which is to say we're going to have the 33.5 million ETH, which is the maximum amount of ETH in terms of issuing rewards. The second assumption is the daily EVM fees in the long term, right? So right now we're roughly order of magnitude where it's 10,000 e per day in transaction fees. Now, I mentioned there's good reasons to believe that the fees, total fees, is up only.
00:50:49.146 - 00:51:42.110, Speaker C: By the way, when I say total fees, I don't mean the gas price, I mean the gas price multiplied by the number of transactions. So we can have our cake and eat it too, because we can have low gas price and lots of transactions with scalability and have this high daily evM fees. And then there's this third parameter, which assumption, which will be removed once we have EIP 1559, which is what is the fee burn percentage? Right, we doing 10,000 eve per day. Roughly how much of that is burnt is it 70%, 7000 eve per day. Is it more, is it less? And it turns out that it doesn't really matter too much. The ballpark is correct. If it's slightly more, it's good because we're deflating faster, we're reducing supply.
00:51:42.110 - 00:52:37.998, Speaker C: If it's slightly less, then that's also good because it means a higher staking APR for the validators, which means more eth that gets frozen. So either way, we win kind of. The really important number, I guess, is the daily EVM fees long term. And so if we plug in the numbers, you're welcome to plug in your own numbers. But my best guess was we're going to have 30 million e staked long term, we're going to have at least 10,000 e per day, and we're going to have a fee burn percentage of roughly 70%. And that gives us about twelve years to kind of go down from 120,000,000 e down back down to 100 million. So basically to vaporize 20 million, it will take twelve years, this best guess.
00:52:38.084 - 00:52:53.700, Speaker B: Of 10,000 ETH being burned per day. That's actually where we currently are right now in EVM fees. And so not only is that what you're saying, your best guess is, but we've actually already checked that box. In theory, according to current Ethereum gas demand, is that right?
00:52:54.310 - 00:53:21.178, Speaker C: That is correct. I mean, the gas market, as I said, can be quite volatile. It depends on things like what is the activity happening on Ethereum. It depends on what the volatility is of the market. It also depends on competitors. Maybe some new blockchain project comes out out there, which is so much better than Ethereum, and all your users migrate away. There's many different factors that will influence the gas market.
00:53:21.264 - 00:53:44.622, Speaker A: Do you know what I find funny is even the critics of Ethereum at this point, a point of critique is never that ETH block space demand will go down. That's never a point of criticism. At this point in Ethereum's lifecycle, it was maybe 2016, 2017. No one will use DFI. No one will use smart contracts. Ethereum is a solution in search of a problem. It's not anymore.
00:53:44.622 - 00:54:18.542, Speaker A: In fact, their criticisms are the opposite. Gas fees are too high, and that's why Ethereum will lose in the long run. Is kind of a narrative playing out. So even the critics don't claim that block space demand is going down. Even they think ETH gas demand is going up. But what this would mean in your best guess case, where we are reducing total supply by 20 million over twelve years. That's an annual supply rate decrease of negative 1.4%.
00:54:18.542 - 00:54:34.286, Speaker A: Right. So right now we're issuing 4.2%. If this best guess turns out to be true, what you're saying, Justin, is we'd have an annualized decrease of 1.4% in supply. Am I reading that correctly?
00:54:34.478 - 00:54:40.630, Speaker C: Yeah, that's about right. So every year the supply would decrease by 1.4%, roughly.
00:54:41.370 - 00:55:00.250, Speaker A: Even the most conservative. Can we just maybe walk through that? Even the most conservative side of things, where fee burn percentage is lower, daily EVM fees are about half of what we're doing right now. And there's a lot of ETH staked, locked up, even that. We're still burning Eth.
00:55:01.170 - 00:55:12.302, Speaker C: Absolutely. We're still deflationary. Even in this super conservative scenario. We're still burning more. Exactly right.
00:55:12.436 - 00:55:30.150, Speaker A: That's crazy. Okay. All right. So that's the second model, is the road to 100 million ETH supply, and you can see how that works out. Fork these, put your own variables in, put your own estimates in. These are all available in the show notes if you'd like to view them and fork them and play with them. This next model, I think, is really interesting.
00:55:30.150 - 00:56:12.626, Speaker A: And you said you prepared this model after you were thinking through the Ultrasound Money podcast. This is a model called net cell pressure reduction. And the way I think about this model is right now we've got cell pressure coming from issuance and coming from transaction fees of about 8.1 million eTh per year. And what you're saying is that pipe is going to be reduced by a lot. It's going to be reduced post EIP 15 five nine post merge to about nine hundred and fifty k per year eth per year. I think that's if you take the daily and you sort of annualize that.
00:56:12.626 - 00:56:27.240, Speaker A: So that's like an 88% reduction. So another way to say this is, I think this model is claiming that there's about to be a cell pressure reduction of about 88%. Can you talk through this model with us?
00:56:27.870 - 00:56:55.940, Speaker C: Right. So this goes back to proof of work being extremely inefficient economically. And so here we need to look at several things. Number one, we need to look at what is the issuance of proof of work versus proof of stake. And proof of work is fairly stable. It's 13.6 thousand or 13.5
00:56:55.940 - 00:57:29.146, Speaker C: thousand e per day. And then for the proof of stake issuance, I'm assuming, let's say this, by the way, this was at merge right now we have about 4 million eve staked. And I'm kind of assuming, let's say 20 million e staked, which is very conservative. There's no way, I don't think we'll be at 20 million e at the point of the merge. But let's assume conservatively that we're at 20 million e staked. Then the daily proof of stake issuance will be 2.1 thousand e.
00:57:29.146 - 00:58:17.434, Speaker C: Now, one of the things you need to look at is the profit margin of proof of work and proof of stake. For proof of work, you have a very small profit margin, because almost all the eth you're forced to sell economically to buy the hardware, to buy the electricity. So let's say that you have a 10% profit margin, but actually, after tax, you have this income tax, which is about 50%. The 10% becomes 5%. So basically, 95% of the ETH that you receive, you're forced to sell. Now, in proof of stake, you have a very different scenario where you don't have the electricity cost, you don't have the hardware cost, you only have the taxes. So your profit margin is 50%, and you're only forced to sell the other 50%.
00:58:17.434 - 00:58:57.678, Speaker C: And actually, on this point, I kind of want to correct one of the things that I said in my previous podcast. I said in the previous episode that proof of stake is not distributive. Right. We were basically claiming that all the rewards accrue to the validators, to the stakers. But that's actually not correct, because roughly half of your EtH that you receive as a validator, you're going to have to pay an income tax. In most jurisdiction, income tax is around 50%. And so you have this natural sell pressure, which is a distribution mechanism for proof of stake.
00:58:57.678 - 00:59:58.778, Speaker C: Anyway, you plug in all the numbers and you also include the fee burn, and you go from 22,000 e per day in sell pressure, which is an insane amount of sell pressure. We're talking, let's see, that's about $50 million per day, which is insane of sell pressure. And we're going to reduce that down by roughly ten x to 5 million e per day, which is much more reasonable. And so when you annualize this, it turns out that the sell pressure reduction is the equivalent of the deposit contract, which is around 4 million e, and grayscale holding the 3.2 million e combined. But that's not like a one time reduction in sell pressure. It's every single year we're going to have the equivalent of 7.2
00:59:58.778 - 01:00:08.030, Speaker C: million e. That is not sold on the market. So if you want, you can think of it as buy pressure. 7.2 million e per year of buy pressure.
01:00:10.290 - 01:01:07.982, Speaker B: Is insanely cool. And so, just to reiterate, removing sell pressure is the same thing at the end result of things as adding in new buy pressure. It's basically two sides of the same coin. And what Justin Drake is saying is that by removing the sell pressure of proof of work issuance and then also removing the sell pressure of EVM fees, fees paid to the validators miners, what we are able to get out of that is the equivalent of both grayscale and the deposit contract every single year. And so this is a recyclable mechanism. We get to generate an equivalent amount of buy pressure that grayscale puts in, and also an equivalent amount of deposit demand that the beacon chain staking contract also puts in. And we get to have this this year and next year and next year and next year until we perhaps even break through that 100 million ether supply floor.
01:01:07.982 - 01:01:10.530, Speaker B: There is no floor for ether supply.
01:01:13.030 - 01:02:01.454, Speaker A: I guess going back to the original analogy that we were talking about, David, you, you mentioned sort of this, this fire hose, right? That is, is feeding the center with the liquid portion of eth, and it's just feeding it more and more eth every year, about 8.1 million eth supply per year. And that's being reduced by a massive amount. So that's being reduced to about 950k eth per year. So there's just like an 80% to 90% reduction. We're moving from a fire hose, as you said, to a garden hose of liquidity that is filling that center part in the states of matter, that liquid.
01:02:01.502 - 01:03:00.866, Speaker B: Part of ETH, and to extrapolate on that as well, right? Not only do we go from just a fire hose of ether issuance, flooding this metaphor of this cylinder of various temperature, where this middle part is just getting injected with just liquidity, like ether selling pressure. But on top of that, we have the top part of this metaphorical cylinder, which is now burning ether, right? It's vaporizing ether. And so that what is being liquid is being vaporized by EIP 1559. And so the liquidity is being dried up that way. And then also we have, on the flip side of things, we have this incentive to stake your ether. And so while this middle section of lukewarm ether, it's very quickly getting vaporized or getting staked. And while it's also not getting resupplied by a bunch of new proof of work issuance, it's only getting resupplied by a very small trickle of proof of stake issuance.
01:03:00.866 - 01:03:42.914, Speaker B: And this reminds me, this turns my brain to some sort of like kind of stock to flow analysis where the center part is the new issuance and it's becoming very low and a lot of the total ETH supply is either getting burnt or staked, right, which is the stock. And so there's very little ether supply that's accessible in liquid, which is actually a security mechanism to Ethereum. Because not having too much ether on the secondary markets is a way to protect Ethereum from would be attackers because there's not that much ether available to them to purchase on the secondary markets and attack. Justin, did I say anything that tripped you up or did you like that?
01:03:43.112 - 01:03:59.078, Speaker C: That was amazing. That was fantastic. And one thing I'll mention is that in the stock to flow flow becomes negative, right? Because we have more. And so that kind of something for the bitcoiners to wrap around in their current model, right?
01:03:59.164 - 01:04:28.340, Speaker A: Massive amount of net sell pressure is reduced. This is crazy. So what are we talking about? A factor of ten or so of efficiency? Net cell price reduction? What's going to happen when that happens? When EIP 15 five nine comes around, when the merge happens, all of this net cell pressure is reduced by 80 90%. What happens?
01:04:30.070 - 01:04:32.018, Speaker C: I wonder what could happen?
01:04:32.104 - 01:04:47.110, Speaker A: I guess we'll find out. Justin, we've got one last model to go through and then we're going to talk about a few other things. But before we do bankless nation, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
01:04:47.260 - 01:05:49.370, Speaker B: Ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on Ethereum and just recently released Ave version two, which has a ton of cool new features that makes using Ave even more powerful. With Ave you can leverage the full power of DFI money, legos, yield and composability all in one application. On Ave, there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield, and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol. If you have deposited collateral here, you can see me getting a 200 USDC loan against my portfolio of a number of different DFI tokens and ETH. I'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option, but I could choose the stable interest rate option if I wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently. One of Ave's V two features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets, trade them on uniswap and then deposit them back into Ave. Ave does all of this for you, all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them.
01:05:49.370 - 01:06:16.526, Speaker B: Check out the power of Ave@ave.com. That's aave.com. Gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange. I've been a customer of Gemini since I first got into crypto in 2017, and it's been my main exchange of choice to make. My crypto buys and sells. Gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide. And on Gemini, there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets, including many of the hot DFI tokens.
01:06:16.526 - 01:06:54.574, Speaker B: And it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid Dai markets. Gemini just launched their earn program, where you can earn up to 7.4% interest on 26 various crypto assets. If you're tired of paying fees in DFI or you don't want to worry about DFI exploits, but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets, Gemini Earn is the product for you. Another product I'm stoked to get my hands on is the Gemini Crypto back credit card, which gives you 3% cash back on all of your purchases, but paid to you in your preferred crypto asset. When I get my Gemini credit card, I'm going to make sure that I get my cash back in ETH. So whenever I buy something, I get a little bit of ETH bonus back to me.
01:06:54.574 - 01:07:09.574, Speaker B: At the same time, you can open up a free account in under 3 minutes@gemini.com. Gobankless and if you trade more than $100 within the first 30 days after sign up, you'll be gifted a free $15 bitcoin bonus. Check them out@gemini.com.
01:07:09.692 - 01:07:24.620, Speaker A: Gobankless yes, we're getting to the fourth model. So, Justin, I was just about to ask you how you get to a staking APR of 25% under your best guess scenario. Can you walk us through some of the variables here?
01:07:25.070 - 01:08:06.550, Speaker C: Right, so we have three key variables here. Variable number one is how much eth will they be staked when we merge? Because this 25% is at the point of merged, it will get arbed away as more eth comes in and stakes. But I'm expecting roughly 6 million e staked when we merge. And the reason is because we're at 4 million right now. Coinbase is going to add another million, and then we're going to have maybe another million trickle through. And what's happening is that the APY is gradually reducing, right? So right now we're at roughly 7.8% apr, but with 6 million e, we're only at 6.8%
01:08:06.550 - 01:08:35.874, Speaker C: Apr. So the incentives are going down as more eth stakes comes in. Okay. Second assumption is, what are the daily EvM fees at merge? And I put ten k, as I mentioned, we're above ten k on the seven day moving average. On the 30 day moving average. On the 100 day moving average, we're roughly at twelve k. So that seems relatively safe, but anything could happen, I guess.
01:08:35.874 - 01:09:10.622, Speaker C: And then there's the fee burn percentage, which is one of the things that will be interesting to see when EIP 1559 comes in, in a few months. But yeah, I put it at 70%. And I guess one way to try and estimate it is to look at the slow gas price, right? So the base fee is meant to represent kind of the sustained demand for.
01:09:10.676 - 01:09:13.870, Speaker B: The basil level of demand. Yeah, the basil level.
01:09:13.940 - 01:09:46.790, Speaker C: Thank you. And so you can use that, and then you can just divide out, you can just take that gas price, multiply it by 15 million gas, which is the current gas limit, and then divide it out by the total eth received in fees in the block. And that will be one way to estimate a lower bound on the fee burn. But of course, it could be slightly greater than that, because the slow gas price might be too conservative.
01:09:47.370 - 01:10:40.886, Speaker B: And so when people were previously discussing the yield from staking, they would really point out just issuance, and people forgot to include the tip, and people forgot to include mev, minor maximum extractable value. Right? And so when people are seeing this 25% APY, and maybe they're getting like sticker shock almost, of how high, no one thought that staking rewards would be this high because everyone forgot to integrate really high gas fees and really high congestion. Right. And so that has been my takeaway, is that people, not only did we not really understand the large implications of reducing issuance and burning fees, but we also didn't understand the net effect of MEV, maximum extractable value rewards being paid to ETH stakers and ETH stakers alone.
01:10:40.998 - 01:10:49.814, Speaker A: But this isn't MeV, is it, David? This is just fee doesn't include MeV.
01:10:49.942 - 01:11:32.326, Speaker C: Is a very broad term, and it includes various things. One of the things that it includes is what I call the native fee, which is the fee that's paid by specifying a gas price in the transaction. But MeV is broader in the sense that there's different ways that you can get paid. For example, Flashbot, what they have is a bundle mechanism where it's basically where they provide a gas price of zero GUI, and instead you have a side channel payment, and the side channel payment happens in the contract, which pays the block proposer, which right now is the miner.
01:11:32.438 - 01:11:51.950, Speaker A: So I guess what I'm saying is, I think what you're saying, david, is absolutely true. But what I'm saying is, I think Justin's model only includes the protocol specific fee revenue as part of MeV. So if you wanted to include all MeV, it would be even more than this. Is that correct, Justin?
01:11:52.550 - 01:12:33.194, Speaker C: That is correct. But flashbots have this dashboard, which is currently in beta, and I got the privilege to see it. And from my understanding is that the incremental MeV, which is paid in these bundles, is only about 5% additional. So right now, at least, it's relatively small, but things could change. And this daily EvM fees, which is right now around ten k, that could go down. But you're right, you need to take into account the possible increase in the fees that are paid through flashbots, because those will go directly. This is pure tip that goes directly to the validators.
01:12:33.194 - 01:12:37.870, Speaker C: Nothing is burnt, really, in the flashbots fees.
01:12:38.450 - 01:12:55.010, Speaker B: Earlier in the episode, Justin, you talked about how the staking ether is so cold that it freezes the ether proximate to it. And I think this is the time to revisit that metaphor. Can you walk us through that metaphor and how this has to do with this 25% APY, right?
01:12:55.080 - 01:13:43.746, Speaker C: So 25% is clearly insane and crazy, and it's not going to last long. It's going to be a temporary thing. And so what's going to happen is that more ETH is going to come in and stake. And so the question, a very natural question you might ask is how much eth is going to come in and stake and get frozen. Exactly. And one way to answer this is using a model. And what you could include as a parameter in your model is, what is the fair cost of money of efer? What is the opportunity cost of staking efer, as opposed to doing something else with your efer? And then the other thing you need to model is, what is the cost of staking, other than the opportunity cost.
01:13:43.746 - 01:14:10.166, Speaker C: So there's various other costs. For example, there's the compute and bandwidth cost, but there's also the risk that you might get slashed. There's some sort of bug. There's also the risk that you go offline and you accumulate these offline penalties. My personal estimate for the cost of staking is roughly 1%. Okay, I might be overestimated. I might be underestimated.
01:14:10.166 - 01:15:16.830, Speaker C: That's for you to put in whatever you think is appropriate. And for the cost of money, of the opportunity cost, I would put it roughly at 5%. So let's say a 6% fair staking APR, anything over 6% will get arbed away. Now, if you go back to the second spreadsheet, the road to 100 million e, you'll see that even when you have 30 million e staked in this best guess column number e, the staking APR is actually above 6%. So if I'm correct that 6% is kind of the fair APR towards which the market will converge, then we're going to see tens of millions on the order of 30 million e staked. So if this road to 100 million comes true, we're going to have roughly 100 million e. 30 million of it is going to be in deep cryogenic cold storage.
01:15:16.830 - 01:15:47.530, Speaker C: We're going to have some amount locked in DFI. I don't know. Right now it's 11 million e, but that's been growing extremely fast. Maybe it could be 20 million, 30 million, 50 million, we don't know. And then the rest, which is going to be probably like a minority, is going to be this liquid etH, which will be available to be sold on exchanges and used to fuel kind of this high velocity ethereum economy.
01:15:48.190 - 01:17:04.690, Speaker B: So returning again to the cylinder of ETH at varying temperatures, metaphor. We have very little new ether being added, the liquid new ether being added to the middle. And where we've gone from where we are now with 4 million ether locked in the staking contract, that ether is so cold because it's receiving such a high APY from fees and issuance that that 4 million ether is so cold that it's going to freeze perhaps up to 30 million more total ether, right? And then we already have 11 million ether locked in DFI. Perhaps that doubles over the next year to 20 million. All of a sudden, we have 50 million ether frozen, right? Either in DFI or in the staking contract. And that's all but a decent, not, not half, but 40% of the total supply of ether is frozen, right? Meanwhile, we have, on the flip side of things, EIP 1559 burning off a lot of that excess vaporware, water vapor, and then we have only a small, modest garden hose of liquidity being trickled in via new proof of stake issuance. And so that is the complete final model of this ether cylinder of varying temperatures.
01:17:05.510 - 01:17:08.550, Speaker C: That is exactly right. You've summarized it perfectly.
01:17:10.090 - 01:17:14.550, Speaker B: And that is how we model, ladies and gentlemen, ultrasound money.
01:17:14.700 - 01:17:51.586, Speaker A: Wow, guys. All right, so that's how you got to those numbers, Justin. There may never be more than 120,000,000 eth. We might, over the next ten years, decrease that to 100 million eth. Sell pressure is going to get massively reduced 80% to 90% with the efficiency of proof of stake. And then staking APY at the start of the merge could be as high as 25%, and then it will decrease from there as more ether is getting cryogenically frozen. That's what these models are showing us.
01:17:51.586 - 01:18:51.910, Speaker A: Justin, let's maybe end with this. How soon could all of this happen? I think crypto is the crypto markets and just crypto natives in general are very used to living these bull bus cycles and almost like these four year kind of repeating cycles. And a lot of this maybe stems from bitcoin being the dominant asset. And there is a happening every four years where bitcoin supply gets cut in half. So every four years, we sort of anticipate something new is going to happen, a changing of the cycles. But I think that EIP 15 five nine and the merge are going to happen much more quickly at an accelerated rate and maybe at a rate that the crypto industry is not typically used to. So how soon could all of this happen? I know we talked about it a little bit, but there's this concept being floated around of the accelerated merge.
01:18:51.910 - 01:19:00.010, Speaker A: What is this? How likely are we to hit the merge date and also the EIP 15 five nine date of July?
01:19:01.950 - 01:19:33.150, Speaker C: Right. So let me talk about the accelerated merge and what it means. Basically, it means that we try to merge as soon as possible, but we have a proof of MVP, minimal viable product. We remove all the bells and whistles. That could slow down the merge. So we remove withdrawals from the beacon chain back to the EVM. That can wait a few more months for what we call the post merge cleanup.
01:19:33.150 - 01:20:40.198, Speaker C: We don't enable transfers internally to the beacon chain, so if you want to transfer some funds from one validator to another, well, you have to wait a little bit more until the post merge cleanup because we really want to focus on this minimal merge. And we don't do fancy stuff like statelessness. So statelessness is kind of a sustainability security feature. We have this massive state, and with statelessness, the validators don't need to store the state, which is very nice. But at merge, we're going to be asking the e two validators to run a full node, a full e one node with all the state and in terms of timelines, we've really tried to accelerate things, and that's for several reasons. One reason, as you can see, is that the cash flows are so large, the amounts of money are so extreme that one, this is bad for the environment, right. Because we're just pumping so much carbon in the atmosphere to pay for the electricity bills on the order of $50 million per day.
01:20:40.198 - 01:21:21.480, Speaker C: The other thing is that it's bad for the holders, the ape holders, right. We have this fire hose of issuance, which is just drowning us in liquidity, which is putting a huge amount of sell pressure. Also, we have miners that have issued some threats of violence. Right. They've said, okay, let's try and show that we're strong and powerful, that we can control the network by amassing 50% of all the hash rate in a single pool. And honestly, I think the merge at this point is kind of overdue. Right.
01:21:21.480 - 01:22:04.858, Speaker C: We're six years in. Right. The concept of proof of stake has been there even before the genesis of Ethereum. That was part of the roadmap from day -100 and really it's overdue. I think the fact that it took us six years really shows how difficult it is to change Ethereum and how robust and decentralized and how much due diligence we put in and how we want to do things properly as opposed to doing things fast. But the beacon chain is now running with over $10 billion. There's a lot at stake.
01:22:04.858 - 01:22:50.660, Speaker C: It's been running essentially fine since genesis. And I think if we were to merge, let's say in December, the beacon chain would be one year old. So we'd have a lot of value at stake for a long period of time. That's quite a bit of stress testing before we merge. So if you go to the eve peak supply spreadsheet, I actually have the best case lean conservative and conservative scenarios. So my best guess is that we're going to merge the 1 December 2021. And now the reason I picked this date is because it's the first anniversary of the beacon chain, which was launched on the 1 December 2020.
01:22:50.660 - 01:23:24.318, Speaker C: But of course, I kind of lean optimistic in general. So maybe people are like generally in the team. I'd say there's this rough consensus at this point that we want to merge as soon as possible and that 2021 is a good development target. But it's not an ultimatum. It's not something that we must deliver. We really want to focus on security first and foremost, because we don't want to put the whole ethereum economy hundreds of billions of dollars on a beacon chain which is not secure. And we don't want to risk all this value.
01:23:24.318 - 01:23:48.450, Speaker C: So if we have to, we will delay. But because the merge is so minimal, it's so simple from a technical perspective, as far as I know, no one believes that the merge would come after Q 120 22. And so that's why I put my conservative timeline at the 31 March 2022 for the merge.
01:23:48.530 - 01:23:53.880, Speaker A: And Justin, this would be that accelerated merge. And then of course, cleanup would need to occur afterwards, correct?
01:23:54.250 - 01:23:55.366, Speaker C: Correct. Yes.
01:23:55.468 - 01:24:09.980, Speaker A: Okay. And then the EIP 15 five, nine date. That feels like it's pretty strong, pretty set. July 14 is looking like the very likely date, but your conservative guess on that was August 2021.
01:24:10.450 - 01:24:29.154, Speaker C: Right. So there's extremely high confidence from the person leading this effort that EIP 1559 will be part of London. Like 99% plus confidence. It's happening. All the implementations are there. We have the testnets. It's already.
01:24:29.154 - 01:24:56.378, Speaker C: The EIP has been accepted. Like the real question is timing, but we're talking about weeks. That's the uncertainty period. And as I mentioned, we have this difficulty bomb, which is a forcing function. So we have to hard fork, and we will hard fork with EIP 1559. The question is just, are we going to hard fork in July, August, potentially in the extreme case, early September, but no later than September 2021.
01:24:56.464 - 01:25:52.250, Speaker A: So back to the acceleration that I was talking about when I asked this question. I don't think the crypto market is used to this amount of issuance, supply chain change in such an accelerated period of time. First of all, the amounts are massive, right? Going from like 4% to negative 1%. And then also the timeline is greatly accelerated. We're talking about nine months, maybe twelve months under the more conservative scenario. I think that the crypto market, crypto investors, crypto people in general, are going to have to get their heads wrapped around this accelerated timeline and the ramifications and implications of what you just laid out. And thanks for putting the models together for us.
01:25:52.250 - 01:25:56.458, Speaker A: I think David's got one last piece he wants to cover, and then we'll.
01:25:56.474 - 01:26:36.380, Speaker B: Let you, Justin and Ryan, you can stop sharing your screen just to finish these things off. And Justin, I want to finish off with, again, another metaphor or kind of like vantage point for viewing ethereum and moving forward. And you've talked about mocks when it comes to ultrasound money. If we were at Mach one, ether is supersonic and we are actually burning more ether than we are issuing, but machs can go up like we can hit Mach two. Which is twice the speed of sound. But what does that mean for ether, the asset? If ether, the asset, hits Mach two, what does that mean? Is that actually an explicit thing?
01:26:36.990 - 01:27:16.614, Speaker C: Yeah. So Mach one means that the fee burn exactly matches the issuance. So it's like as if we had a cap, right? The supply would not increase. It would be very similar economics to bitcoin. And we'd be like sound money if we reach Mac one, but if we reach Mac two, what that means is that the amount that we're burning is twice as much than the amount that we're issuing now. By the way, this is long term Mac one, Mac two, Mac three. If we were to look right now in the present day, it's more like Mac ten.
01:27:16.614 - 01:28:01.954, Speaker C: And the reason it's so high is because there's relatively little eth that's being staked, only 4 million e. And so the proof of stake issuance is quite a bit lower. So this little diagram is actually assuming 20 million e, which is a far cry from the current 4 million e. So I tried to be conservative, but as you can see, the 365 day moving average is at 7.5 thousand e per day. And the 300 day and the 100 day moving average are at Mac four, which is 12,000 e per day. So these data points at the top there, they're acting like magnets, right, for the 365 day moving average.
01:28:01.954 - 01:28:09.480, Speaker C: So we can expect that this moving average will keep on going up, cross Mac three, and possibly even cross Mac four.
01:28:09.870 - 01:28:41.938, Speaker B: I think this metaphor will do a really good job of kind of explaining the differences between the bitcoin strategy versus the Ethereum strategy. Because with bitcoin, we have the habitings, right? Every four years, it's programmed into the protocol. It's a very ceremonious time for bitcoiners. It's just like the time of the havening. It's the time for all bitcoiners get to come and celebrate the havening of the supply making its way to the secondary market. But with Ethereum, I think we could have our own mocks. And we get to have mach two, mach three, mach four.
01:28:41.938 - 01:29:19.962, Speaker B: And the difference is that with bitcoin, it's programmed into the protocol. Regardless of whether bitcoin is ready for it or not, it is getting cut in half, no matter what, regardless of whether the economics stand up. And bitcoin is very much hoping that because of the happening, it makes the economics stand up. But for better or for worse, the happening is happening with mocks, with ethereum, and going from mach one to mach two, mach three. It's not programmed, it's not guaranteed. Ethereum has to earn it. Ethereum has to viably leveraging just a native economy that's built on top of ethereum.
01:29:19.962 - 01:30:04.800, Speaker B: If it gets from mach one to mach two and then Mach two to Mach three, it's because it earned it. It's because it made the economics work out like that. And so rather than having it programmed and imposed upon the system, the mocketing or going from mach one to mach two, mach three gets to be a new ceremonious time for ethereum people when we don't know it's coming or not. And when we finally hit like mach 17 or whatever, we get to rejoice in this new mocking. We need to figure out a better meme for this, but a new mock level where we get to pat ourselves on our back, be like, we earned this, we got this done. It came to us. Rather than it being imposed upon the protocol, Ethereum was ready to reach this new speed of ultrasound money.
01:30:04.800 - 01:30:08.670, Speaker B: And that's my takeaway. That I think is a nice juxtaposition.
01:30:09.570 - 01:31:10.126, Speaker C: Absolutely. And I think this kind of shows the potential of the ultrasound money meme. Like, really, the whole thing started as a joke, right? It was supersonic money from Vitalik, and then it was upgraded from joke to meme with ultrasound. Ultrasound. One word and I think we're moving towards ultrasound money with a space in between as becoming reality, becoming fundamentals. And as you say, these fundamentals are going to age like fine wine, right? Because if this up only thesis is correct in terms of the total transaction fees per day, this theme is just going to keep on maturing and maturing and maturing. And actually, if you want to facilitate the maturing process, not only can you participate, of course, on Ethereum and be part of the economy and pay these transaction fees, but this is a small plug.
01:31:10.126 - 01:31:27.750, Speaker C: I'm looking for a website designer backend and front end to help with the website ultrasound money, right? So I think there's a lot of potential there to show really nice graphics of the daily burn and what Mac level we're at and et cetera, et cetera.
01:31:28.410 - 01:31:39.482, Speaker B: Wow, that is a very prestigious position. I think whoever ends up landing that job to help build out that website, that would be a pretty cool job to land, for sure.
01:31:39.616 - 01:32:01.380, Speaker A: Justin, thank you so much for spending time with us. This is number wow, you've just given us so much in terms of understanding what's happening with the crypto economics of this system. We call Ethereum, and we just really appreciate you spending the time to do this.
01:32:02.230 - 01:32:04.706, Speaker C: Thank you so much for having me. It was great fun.
01:32:04.888 - 01:32:38.702, Speaker A: Bankless listeners in the show notes there will be some action items for you, and one of those is to review these models, the models that we went through with Justin. Super important. Play with them yourselves. If you want to adjust the assumptions, go do that. Give us your feedback. Also, listen to the ultrasound money episode again, I've had a lot of bankless listeners tell us that they've had to listen to it not once, but twice, or sometimes three or four times to fully digest and understand that episode. I think that's a key precursor episode to this one.
01:32:38.702 - 01:32:45.786, Speaker A: And I'll just say that I think this is the most important thing happening in crypto right now and it doesn't.
01:32:45.818 - 01:32:47.818, Speaker B: Get enough, the beginning in my opinion.
01:32:47.914 - 01:33:24.958, Speaker A: Yeah, but especially right now because it's going to happen over the next nine to twelve months and it's going to happen so quickly. And Ethereum is the second largest crypto network, maybe moving into the first largest as a result of all of this. And people need to understand ETh's monetary policy, ETh's issuance schedule, what's happening with E 20, the fee burn, the implications of that, the merge, the reduction of supply, implications of that. And so we're trying to bring that information out to them. This is alpha, this is understanding, this is where ethereum is going. So thanks for tuning in. Thanks for tuning with us, as always.
01:33:24.958 - 01:33:37.380, Speaker A: Risks and disclaimers of course. ETH is risky, crypto is risky. So are these defi systems. You could lose what you put in. But we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone.
01:33:37.380 - 01:33:41.746, Speaker A: But we are glad you are with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
