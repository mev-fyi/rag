00:00:00.170 - 00:00:16.238, Speaker A: Are they arresting developers now, David. Hey, bankless nation. It is the third Friday of August. Hope you're doing well. It is time for the weekly roll up. That's what we're about to do, David. Every Friday coming at you, you're in a different place.
00:00:16.238 - 00:00:18.846, Speaker A: Are you going like mountain climbing or something this week?
00:00:18.868 - 00:00:22.830, Speaker B: No, not mountain climbing. I'm just gonna go climb a mountain which is meaningfully different.
00:00:22.980 - 00:00:23.678, Speaker A: Oh, okay.
00:00:23.764 - 00:00:34.390, Speaker B: Me and the four alfalfa, the boys. Right after this. We're about to go to the Olympics in Washington, so going to go have a little cabin weekend, and then we're going to go to the high divide trail.
00:00:36.170 - 00:00:43.050, Speaker A: This is different. There's distinction between mountain climbing. Climbing a mountain which is like, you're not using your hands. Is that the distinction?
00:00:44.270 - 00:00:46.650, Speaker B: We are just walking a lot, man.
00:00:46.720 - 00:00:50.438, Speaker A: I've been getting into the mountain climbing documentary scene.
00:00:50.534 - 00:00:56.654, Speaker B: There's quite a inspirational alpinist, Don Wall.
00:00:56.772 - 00:00:58.094, Speaker A: No, is that the next Don wall.
00:00:58.132 - 00:00:59.386, Speaker B: Is better than free solo.
00:00:59.498 - 00:01:04.094, Speaker A: All right. Does the guy die in the end, though? Because I can't do that. No, he doesn't do that. Again.
00:01:04.212 - 00:01:08.738, Speaker B: Well, all right, in one of these three movies he does, but not in the one I just mentioned.
00:01:08.824 - 00:01:21.510, Speaker A: You're right. No spoilers, guys. Sometimes it happens. It's a dangerous freaking sport. Which is why I'm glad you are climbing a mountain rather than mountain climbing, because this podcast would be pretty boring without my co host.
00:01:22.650 - 00:01:25.638, Speaker B: Since we're on the topic, I have done ice climbing in the past and let me tell you.
00:01:25.644 - 00:01:31.014, Speaker A: Yeah, I know, and that worried me. But with all strapped in, you're not.
00:01:31.052 - 00:01:34.650, Speaker B: Like pre strapped in. Absolutely. I am not a lunatic.
00:01:35.150 - 00:01:50.398, Speaker A: But still, you're like, ice climbing is not adrenaline. Not the same sport. Anyway. Okay, some adrenaline in crypto this week as well. Certainly the tornado cash saga continues. Are they arresting developers now, David? We're going to get into that.
00:01:50.484 - 00:01:51.914, Speaker B: There's an arrested developer.
00:01:52.042 - 00:02:01.854, Speaker A: Yeah, arrested. That's crazy. That's a big step up. And the question on the back of that is, is Ethereum really censorship resistant? We're going to get into that. What else we covering, David?
00:02:01.982 - 00:02:26.650, Speaker B: We are also covering the bad boys contagion. Topics are back. We got three arrows capital on the front page of the New York magazine, so we're going to talk about that. Also, the genesis CEO has stepped down and 20% of staff is being laid off as a result of the crypto contagion. And also, more updates on Celsius. So bad boy season. And also coming in in the third hottest thing of the week.
00:02:26.650 - 00:02:35.360, Speaker B: There's an exact date for the merge. We knew this last week, precise, but somebody has got it down to the minute, so we're going to talk about that as well.
00:02:35.810 - 00:02:50.978, Speaker A: David, while we're talking about things, we should talk about, our friends and sponsors at Smartcon. They wanted us to give the bankless nation a message, which is they are hosting a badass conference at the end of September, the 20 eigth and 29th. Who's going to be attending? Smartcon. What is this thing about?
00:02:51.144 - 00:03:08.742, Speaker B: Smartcon is Chainlink's annual conference. This is the first chain link smartcon conference that is happening in real life. So there are some absolute chads in attendance. Got Eric Schmidt, former CEO of Google. Sergey, of course, founder of Chainlink. Bology, of course. We just had him on the show.
00:03:08.742 - 00:03:26.414, Speaker B: SBF. We all know SBF, Ed from arbitrums, Donnie from Ave. Kane from synthetics. So that is coming to New York at the end of September. There is a link in the show notes if you want to take a peek and get a ticket. Also, if you do get a ticket, make sure to use the code bankless to get a healthy discount on that ticket price.
00:03:26.532 - 00:03:38.820, Speaker A: A substantial discount. This is numbering in the hundreds of dollars, so you definitely want to check that out. All right, David, let's check out some markets, man. What is bitcoin telling us this week?
00:03:39.190 - 00:03:50.198, Speaker B: Bitcoin, slightly down. Slightly down 4.7%. Started the week at 24,500. Ending the week where we are today at 23,400.
00:03:50.364 - 00:04:00.470, Speaker A: Okay. Slightly down on the week. No clear signal above 20k. I'm not feeling good about bitcoin unless it's above 30k, but how about Eth? What's that looking like?
00:04:00.540 - 00:04:07.260, Speaker B: Yeah, Eth down 2.2% on the week. Start of the week at 1900. Currently clocking in at 1860.
00:04:07.710 - 00:04:21.614, Speaker A: Are you surprised we're going to get into all of the ofax stuff? Rested developer censorship stuff in a bit more detail. But are you surprised that this action didn't hit Eth even harder? Like, price just kind of shrugged it off?
00:04:21.812 - 00:04:40.470, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess that is a good point. The Tornado ofax stuff was a big deal, is a big deal. And now it's two weeks in a row that crypto Twitter has been dominated by this tornado cash ofac conversation. Am I surprised that it didn't hit harder?
00:04:41.610 - 00:04:42.118, Speaker A: Maybe?
00:04:42.204 - 00:05:07.326, Speaker B: I guess so. I guess in a different state of the market, I would have expected that to hit the price a little bit more. But it goes back to, are we in a bear market? Are we in a bull market. Are we in a crab market? And one of the big indications, the actual solid indications of what kind of market you're in is what does news do to prices? And if bad news doesn't tank prices, you're in a bull market. If good news makes prices go up, you're in a bull market.
00:05:07.428 - 00:05:25.842, Speaker A: I agree. And I do think back to the statement, I don't care if we say it every week on the roll up, it's fine. Sentiment follows price. Sentiment follows price. And so I think if prices on ETH were down, like, 15% on the week, there'd probably be a different narrative spun out. There's all OFAc, all censorship. That's why ETH is down on the week.
00:05:25.842 - 00:05:33.302, Speaker A: So because it's flat. That really wasn't part of the narrative this week. And I do think it's maybe an indication that we are not in a bear market.
00:05:33.436 - 00:06:02.718, Speaker B: It's also worth considering that these seven day price updates that we do, every single roll up, since we have what is basically one month on the screen, the seven days is just that red square that I'm moving my cursor around right here. The trajectory, the trend is clearly up. And so if we went for 14 days, it would be green. And so inside the seven day of just like, just down 2.2%, it's actually in a monthly long uptrend, and it's still fitting there.
00:06:02.804 - 00:06:07.882, Speaker A: True short term. David, that's not your cursor. Well, you can't see your cursor.
00:06:07.946 - 00:06:08.862, Speaker B: Yes, I can.
00:06:08.996 - 00:06:09.258, Speaker A: Really?
00:06:09.284 - 00:06:10.578, Speaker B: I'm the one who's recording my screen.
00:06:10.664 - 00:06:11.522, Speaker A: No way. I did.
00:06:11.576 - 00:06:12.734, Speaker B: You can't see my cursor?
00:06:12.782 - 00:06:16.066, Speaker A: Yeah. Oh, my God. I thought it was my cursor this entire time.
00:06:16.168 - 00:06:20.306, Speaker B: No, I do capture your cursor. I also capture my cursor.
00:06:20.338 - 00:06:22.434, Speaker A: There's double cursors that people on YouTube.
00:06:22.482 - 00:06:28.118, Speaker B: Yeah, and also mine's bigger. See, I just placed my cursor over your cursor, and your cursor is gone.
00:06:28.284 - 00:06:40.038, Speaker A: Unbelievable. All this time, and now I find out. I guess I actually should have watched a roll up previously or on Spotify, by the way. Spotify. You can catch that coinbase.
00:06:40.134 - 00:06:42.602, Speaker B: Sorry, coin market cap.
00:06:42.656 - 00:06:45.760, Speaker A: Yeah. What's the crypto market cap this week?
00:06:46.850 - 00:06:55.102, Speaker B: We are slightly down on the week. We ended last week at 1.2 trillion. We are at 1.17, so down $30 billion, basically. Noise, basically.
00:06:55.156 - 00:07:04.194, Speaker A: Above a trillion. Okay. This is a metric we've been paying closer attention to, and it's gotten a lot more interesting in the last few months. That is the ETH bitcoin ratio. What is that like on the week?
00:07:04.312 - 00:07:20.150, Speaker B: Yeah, it is up on the week. It is up 2.4%, almost breaching, broke zero eight earlier this week, fell back down. But now we are at the ratio looking real good.
00:07:20.300 - 00:07:30.842, Speaker A: Real trend on this has been up. We've got another graphic we'll show a little bit later when we talk about it. But let's talk about the bullishness that is the merch because we can't not.
00:07:30.976 - 00:07:32.174, Speaker B: I'd love to talk about this.
00:07:32.212 - 00:07:49.998, Speaker A: We're like less than a month out. Okay. It's like less than four months a month from now. Four weeks, yes. Let me not fud the merge. Four weeks from now we will be in a post merge world, and this is what that world will look like. Monetary issuance rates.
00:07:49.998 - 00:08:19.190, Speaker A: If you compare fiat, the dollar, ethereum proof of work, gold and bitcoin and proof of stake, ethereum proof of stake. I'm going to read these numbers from you. And this is from a Bloomberg report actually, where they're increasing their coverage of Ethereum. It's getting me pretty bullish. So if you look at the fiat issuance rate from the 1970s until now, it's been about 12.8%, 12.9%. If you look at just the dollar it's issued, this is different than inflation.
00:08:19.190 - 00:08:39.090, Speaker A: This is issuance at 9.2%. Okay. Per year. These are all annualized numbers. Ethereum has been under proof of work, 4.2%. So already significantly less than fiat, but gold is even better than that. They only mine about 1.8%
00:08:39.090 - 00:08:50.886, Speaker A: gold from the ground. New gold issuance every single year since the 1970s. Silver a little bit better than that, 1.4% bitcoin. Better still, of course, right now that.
00:08:50.908 - 00:09:01.260, Speaker B: Number that they are showing on screen is post 2024 happening. So they are jumping forward in future. So the current issuance rate is about 1.7%.
00:09:01.710 - 00:09:15.838, Speaker A: Yes, 1.61.7 post, which makes bitcoin on par with gold, basically. And that's currently. Now if you want to project forward to the next happening, that'll be cut in half again. So it'll be 0.8%, 0.9%, something like this.
00:09:15.838 - 00:09:42.962, Speaker A: But ethereum under proof of stake coming in, in four weeks from now at 0%. All right. And then if demand recovers, current fees, yeah, issuance and then that's with current fees. And if demand recovers to the fees that we were generating during the bull market or over the past year or so, it will be deflationary at negative zero point 43%. Pretty stunning numbers here, David.
00:09:43.026 - 00:10:07.642, Speaker B: Yeah, we've been talking on previous roll ups of like, man, Ryan, we might not be deflationary post merge, but then if you look at this graph right here, and it's like, oh, we'll be zeroteen percent inflationary. It's like, oh, who cares? The difference between 0% inflationary versus negative 00:40 3% is like actually relatively small. Fundamentally bullish.
00:10:07.706 - 00:10:55.098, Speaker A: These scales for fiat and gold are like 50 year scales, right? When you're a monetary asset, you have to look in 50 year scales. There's another number that was on this graphic that I want to get your weigh in on is if you actually look at Apple stock buyback, okay? That's a deflationary asset too, at negative 3.7%. And so some people, when I posted this, they said, well, actually, if you're saying ether is a great store of value, you should actually be saying apple is an even better store of value. And that's an interesting take. But the difference between apple and ether is apple is not a monetary asset, all right? It's not used within the apple economy. You can't pay anything with apple dollars or apple as a unit of exchange.
00:10:55.194 - 00:11:06.874, Speaker B: There is no reservation demand for apple stock in financial. Okay, so you could collateralize your apple stock if you're a billionaire and you can make that deal with Goldman.
00:11:06.922 - 00:11:07.874, Speaker A: Slight amount. That's it.
00:11:07.912 - 00:11:16.370, Speaker B: Right? But other than that, it's not like inside of permissionlessly global networks that have deFi applications that are also permissionlessly built.
00:11:16.440 - 00:11:38.362, Speaker A: Right? And it never will be because it doesn't have the credible neutrality. Because Tim Cook and team can change the issuance policy at a whim. Stop those buybacks, right? Doesn't have the credible neutrality, doesn't have the decentralization, is not used as a store of value, unit of exchange. And what's the other one? Medium of exchange and unit of account. It's not used as a money.
00:11:38.496 - 00:11:57.682, Speaker B: Right. But ether actually gets the best of both worlds. It gets the stock buyback mechanism of EIP 1559, which is the same mechanism that drove apple stock to be like, quote unquote deflationary. So it gets that, but it also gets the reservation demand of being like collateral money inside of DFI. It gets to have both.
00:11:57.816 - 00:12:09.742, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. Compare it to equities, compare it to monetary instruments. You kind of have to compare it to both. And in both, it's pretty favorable. I've got to say. We are bullish on etH, and so are you. David here's a tweet from you.
00:12:09.816 - 00:12:55.362, Speaker B: Yeah. So here's a nice metaphor that I was cooking up, and I say, think of the merge as a current, like an ocean current or like a river current swimming against the current, which is equivalent to swimming against proof of work issuance is hard. If you are a swimmer and you are swimming upstream, you are swimming, and you're probably not going very far, you're becoming a really good swimmer. But because you have to swim against the current, which is swimming against the structural cell pressure of proof of work miners, you're swimming against the current like you're a strong swimmer, but you're not going anywhere. And so I say bitcoin and ether have become strong swimmers in order to sustain their current prices. They're swimming against the current, they're developing their muscles, but they're not really going very far. They're not moving.
00:12:55.362 - 00:13:47.698, Speaker B: But the merge kills the current because it kills the structural cell pressure of all of the proof of work miners. And so as ether has become this jacked swimmer swimming upstream, all of a sudden the stream doesn't stops being upstream and it actually starts being downstream. And so ether goes from swimming against the current to swimming with the current. And so I continue in the tweet thread that I say, when ethereum's network activity increases, EIP 1559 actually increases the speed of the current that is pushing ether forward. And so the speed of water that the swimmer is swimming in increases or decreases as a function of gas fees as a function of EIP burning. And so the more network activity, the faster the current is that's pushing ether forward. After ether's already developed all of these jacked muscles swimming really fast.
00:13:47.698 - 00:13:52.066, Speaker B: And so that's like the metaphor of the merge and ether like supply economics.
00:13:52.098 - 00:14:27.098, Speaker A: Right? Now, what I love about David Hoffman metaphors is you could just close your eyes and just visualize them. So if that didn't stick with you the first time, close your eyes, rewind this podcast, and listen to that again, because merge ASMR. Yeah, that's what's happening. And the question I think is, is the merge priced in or not? We had an excellent episode with Hal Press, who's, I think, the best writer, the best thinker on this, the best investor on this. He literally bet his fund on the merge trade. He wrote a fantastic post in the bankless newsletter that you should absolutely read. It's fairly long, but is incredibly detailed.
00:14:27.098 - 00:14:47.490, Speaker A: Send this to somebody with a tie, financial analyst as well. They'll enjoy this. And we did an episode with him earlier in the week that you can catch on the feed. But David, we've got to get the contrary take a little bit. Okay. And the contrary take to all of this bullishness is, hey, eth bulls, crypto bulls. Here's a tweet from Clark.
00:14:47.490 - 00:15:13.646, Speaker A: You weren't playing any EtH merge. You were telling yourself a comfortable story while you longed the S-P-I think he is showing a correlation between ethereum maybe and the s p price on this chart. I'm not sure if that's what we're looking at. Yeah, that's what's going on here. So basically the tweeter is saying, hey, eth bulls, like you're getting so excited. But look, Nasdaq's up. We all know risk on assets do really well when Nasdaq's up.
00:15:13.646 - 00:15:23.966, Speaker A: And that's what you're actually trading. Cut out the EtH merge bs. This is actually just the Nasdaq and SP stocks are up. So ETH goes up in higher beta.
00:15:23.998 - 00:15:55.626, Speaker B: Form, and they're probably right to some degree and perhaps a decent degree, like maybe it's actually greater than 50% of the effect. But we know with complete certainty, at least I'm completely certain that it's not the full story. And we know that that is true because of the ETH BTC ratio has rocketed off the floor, going from where it was at like zero five to where it is now at zero eight. And so did bitcoin follow the s and P 500, perhaps? Yes. Did Ether follow the s and P 500, perhaps?
00:15:55.658 - 00:15:55.950, Speaker A: Yes.
00:15:56.020 - 00:16:12.478, Speaker B: But Ether was like a two x multiplier on what bitcoin did. And so only one of these things followed the SP, and one of these things followed the SP even more, and ether did it even more. And my argument is like, that's clearly because of the S P or because of the merge.
00:16:12.574 - 00:16:35.670, Speaker A: I agree. So we're looking at an ETH bitcoin chart, and this is actually from an Arthur Hayes article, basically talking about how bullish he is on ETH, the asset and the merge and the trades. We'll include a link to that in the show notes. He just published that this week. Great article as well. And he's showing like this is ETh bitcoin ratio. And you could see that line of the merge probability increasing and ETH is just gaining strength on bitcoin.
00:16:35.670 - 00:17:10.166, Speaker A: But also, interestingly enough, David, alt layer ones are not doing the same thing. Ether is okay. They are still not relative to ether. So you might say, well, of course ETH is up relative to bitcoin because it's more risk off, risk on, excuse me, but all layer ones have not appreciated relative to ether. So I think this really goes to the fact that people are pricing in the merge. That's kind of what we're seeing in the Eth price right now. At least all the evidence points towards that.
00:17:10.166 - 00:17:14.438, Speaker A: David, we got a lot more to talk about. What are we going to cover next?
00:17:14.604 - 00:17:59.238, Speaker B: Coming up next, are they arresting crypto developers? And is that the future of crypto? Because there's already one in jail. So we're going to talk about that arrest and why that happened and our speculation around that and leading to the broader question, is Ethereum really censorship resistant? I'm pretty sure, Ryan, there's a bunch of listeners that don't pay attention to crypto, Twitter, so they kind of get it through this. And so we're going to speed run them through the seven day conversation that was the Ethereum community on crypto Twitter about its relationship with censorship because a lot happened on that conversation the last seven days. So we're going to give that conversation to listeners and also, of course, bad boys. Bad boys. What you going to do? Three arrows capital is on the COVID of New York magazine. Not in a good way.
00:17:59.238 - 00:18:29.034, Speaker B: Alex Machinsky took over trading of Celsius in the last days and really drove that thing into the ground in a grand fashion. And of course, the Genesis CEO steps down and lays off 20% of employees with it. So all of this spicy, spicy stuff and more coming right after we get through some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible. Lens protocol is an open source tech stack for building decentralized social media applications. It is the new era for social media. We all have toxic relationships with our web. Two apps, we want to break up with them, but we can't.
00:18:29.034 - 00:18:51.522, Speaker B: These applications own our digital lives and all the relationships that we've made. We need to break through to a new paradigm of social networking applications that we control rather than them controlling us. Lens isn't a social media app. It's a protocol to let a thousand web3 social apps bloom. Lens is a permissionless and transparent social graph that is owned by the user. In crypto, we say, not your keys, not your crypto. And on lens, we say, not your keys, not your profile.
00:18:51.522 - 00:19:32.114, Speaker B: With lens, your followers go with you to whatever social media application you want to use. And instead of being trapped by an algorithm chosen by that app, lens lets you choose the way you want to experience your social media. Lens is the last social media handle that you'll ever need to create. So in order to get started, there is a secret code word in the show notes. Enter that code word in the Google form link and you'll be well on your way to entering the world of web.

Fast, cheap, secure, and fiction free arrest of suspected developer of tornado cash no longer suspected.
00:20:13.226 - 00:20:58.094, Speaker B: We do know that this is actually the tornado cash developer. And this is Fiod NL, the website, which is a Netherlands website as to where, because that's where this individual, this developer, was arrested in Amsterdam. So on Wednesday, August 10, the fiod arrested a 29 year old man in Amsterdam who was suspected of involvement in concealing criminal financial flows and facilitating money laundering through the mixing cryptocurrencies through the decentralized Ethereum mixing service Tornado Cash Fiod is the Netherlands investigation of financial services and financial crime organization. And they arrested a tornado cash developer. Now, it's one thing to arrest open source developers. That would be egregious. We're not totally sure if that's what happened.
00:20:58.094 - 00:21:19.014, Speaker B: And so there's speculation out there that not only this person happened to be a tornado cash developer, but they were actually perhaps also assisting and aiding people in laundering money. But we don't actually know because Fiod released a statement that basically didn't give us any clarity. Ryan, what's your take on this?
00:21:19.132 - 00:22:05.330, Speaker A: Well, my take on this know, first of all, it seems very much like possibly they didn't have another reason for arresting this tornado cache developer rather than publishing the code. As David, you said, we're not certain of that. That is kind of the base case assumption. And if that's the case, a man was arrested for writing code that served as a public good for people to maintain their privacy online. That means they put a man in jail because people use his open source code. And I don't think, David, that can stand in any free society on earth. As you said, we still don't know if there were other reasons that this arrest was made, but I believe on the 16th FIAd provided some sort of statement on this, but it wasn't really clear.
00:22:05.330 - 00:22:18.466, Speaker A: This is Jake Chavinsky saying they refuse to say what charges are alleged, if any. So we still don't know if they think writing code is a crime. Does Fayad think writing code is a crime?
00:22:18.578 - 00:22:45.698, Speaker B: Two outcomes I see here is that there is an ongoing investigation that they don't want to show their cards for. And this is me trying to retain my grip of bullishness on humanity, as in really good. I'm trying here. This guy aided and embedded, like money laundering of criminals and actually committed crimes versus. They didn't say anything because they know that they just arrested this guy for building tornado cash, which is the outcome I do not want.
00:22:45.864 - 00:23:04.726, Speaker A: So it's possible that the first outcome still be bullish on humanity. Outcome is still out there. Right. And so we need to remain open to that possibility. But I will say a few other things happened congruent with this, which is they deactivated the tornado cache discord. Right. Okay.
00:23:04.726 - 00:23:48.934, Speaker A: They killed the GitHub repos of all devs. And these were centralized companies doing this. So you could argue this is kind of a chilling effect, but still, the chilling effect is an effect, isn't it? It's a legally defined term, as you explained last week on the tornado cash episode. And then this is the backdrop where OFAC actually banned, not individuals, but they banned some smart contract code. So what does the weight of evidence point us towards for this arrest? It is very possible that they made an arrest of an open source developer who just published some open source code, bad guys used it, and that's why they want to send him to prison. And if so, that is a big, big problem, I think not for. We'll get to these stakes later.
00:23:48.934 - 00:24:16.814, Speaker A: Not necessarily for ethereum, not necessarily for crypto, though. It is a problem for the technology, more a problem for the countries and the citizens that live in those countries. Who are restricting their first amendment freedoms. First amendment, of course, is, I guess that's a US only term. But like freedom of speech, freedom to write and publish code, some of these things are very important in any free democratic society. And these are the things that are in threat of being breached right now.
00:24:16.932 - 00:24:34.786, Speaker B: And without evidence that these fiod arrested this developer because they actually committed explicit and real crimes, then I think as a community, we have to assume that the man is innocent and didn't do anything until they tell us. Then in my mind, this guy just got arrested for writing code.
00:24:34.888 - 00:24:43.042, Speaker A: So what are the legal experts telling us at coin center? This is a crypto lobby group that investigates this and has lawyers on staff. What are they saying? David?
00:24:43.106 - 00:25:31.126, Speaker B: Yeah, so coin center released a very thorough and detailed statement, analysis, legal analysis of the OFAC ruling of tornado cash being on the list. So here's basically some excerpts from it that I think are important. They write, if the tornado cash application is not property in which some foreign country or national has an interest, then the tornado cash application cannot properly be added to the SDN list or blocked under the specific powers granted by Congress to the president in the IEEPA. IEEPA is what gives OFAC power. Someone should be able to challenge the designation as being made outside the bounds of the statute and therefore invalid. Basically saying coins are saying like, someone should be able to challenge this. There's like strong legal grounds for somebody challenging this.
00:25:31.126 - 00:26:10.194, Speaker B: And coins under basically lays out the two big claims as to why somebody could challenge this. So claim one OFAC's designation of certain autonomous contract addresses denies Americans their liberty and property without proper procedural due process. Yes, covered this. And claim two. An over broad interpretation of the IEEPA substantially chills First Amendment protected speech. So those are the main core claims that coincenter believes that there are legal precedents, there's legal ground for someone to take coin center to, or, excuse me, for someone to take OFAC to court. And coin center is not the only organization focused on freedom to release a statement like this.
00:26:10.194 - 00:26:47.280, Speaker B: The EFF, the Electronic Frontier foundation, which is an organization just dedicated to protecting the frontier, basically. And they put out a tweet that says, the EFF is deeply concerned that the US Treasury Department has included an open source computer project, Tornado Cash, on its list of sanctioned individuals. Tornado Cash is an open source software project and website that published a decentralized cryptocurrency mixer. And then they go on in their tweet thread and also release an article backing this. And so now we have our lobby groups, our frontier protecting agencies, putting up a flag and saying, yo, ofac, no back.
00:26:47.730 - 00:27:33.094, Speaker A: And so important to note that OFAC didn't arrest this developer. It was the group in the Netherlands, of course. But it's all part of the same thing, isn't it? This global kind of financial apparatus trying to enforce these, quote, unquote, financial crimes. And is privacy one of those financial crimes? This is a great tweet from Alex. David, what are we looking at? Just if you want to get the scope of other notable money laundering scandals in perspective and let it be known, of course, tornado cash was used by some bad guys for money laundering. I think you pegged the percentage at like, 35%, according to you, to analysts. So at least 35% of the funds inside of tornado cash was like North Korea and some other bad actors, money launderers.
00:27:33.094 - 00:27:39.274, Speaker A: But that wasn't the only use case. And let's compare it to other money laundering scandals in history. What are we looking at here, David?
00:27:39.322 - 00:28:19.130, Speaker B: Yeah, so we're looking at a graphic of just the previous biggest money laundering scandal. So, coming in at number one, at 390,000,000,000, we have the 2010 Wachovia Wells Fargo case, which was allowed to allowed drug cartels from Mexico to launder almost $400 billion during 2004 to 2007. Damn. Coming in at number one, coming at number 2265,000,000,000. Standard Chartered british banking giant. 2012, accused by New York Department of Financial Services of its failure to control money laundering, then helped the iranian government to circumvent us regulations to clear money to the tune of 265,000,000,000. Damn.
00:28:19.130 - 00:28:40.702, Speaker B: Donks bank. Donks bank. Donks bank money laundering scandal arose in 2017 to 2018, when it became known that €200 billion of suspicious transactions flowed from estonian, russian and latvian sources through the Estonian bank branch of Denmark. Bank donks bank. From 2007 to 2015. 228,000,000,000. Damn.
00:28:40.702 - 00:29:01.958, Speaker B: And so going to go back through those again. 390,000,000,000 from Wells Fargo. What happened was $160,000,000 fine, no arrests. The standards chartered the number, 2265,000,000,000. The bank paid an $842,000,000 fine and disciplined ten employees. I wonder what that means. Coming in at 228,000,000,000.
00:29:01.958 - 00:29:09.850, Speaker B: The danks bank. Result. Ten employees were arrested. So ten people went to jail. Okay, all right, no fine.
00:29:10.000 - 00:29:14.798, Speaker A: Maybe not to jail. Just initially arrested, arrested. We don't know what the outcomes were.
00:29:14.884 - 00:29:31.618, Speaker B: Coming in at number four, 8 billion HSBC. The result was this, a 300 million dollar fine, no arrest. Coming in at number 511 billion. Westpac Bank. Bank paid a $1.3 billion fine, no arrest. Tornado cash coming in at number six.
00:29:31.618 - 00:29:34.354, Speaker B: Tornado cash, open source question mark.
00:29:34.392 - 00:29:35.554, Speaker A: Right? We don't know.
00:29:35.672 - 00:30:07.962, Speaker B: At its highest point, it held $500 to $900 million. But while authorities link some of these addresses to north korean hacker groups, it's unclear how much of that total was used for illegal purposes. Ryan, earlier you said 35% was in tornado cash. That was in tornado cash at the moment of it getting added to the OFAC list. And that's after the Nomad bridge heist, all of these other recent heists when I was using tornado cache. As for my own personal use cases, in 2021, it was really sanctioned. Importantly, pre sanctioned.
00:30:07.962 - 00:30:17.282, Speaker B: It was really before all of the bridge heists that we've seen. And so I bet you back in 2021, it was way below 35%. I bet you down below 20%.
00:30:17.336 - 00:30:23.010, Speaker A: And the scope of this, we're talking like, look, 100 million to $300 million. All right? Look at these things.
00:30:23.160 - 00:30:23.970, Speaker B: Insane.
00:30:25.110 - 00:30:43.110, Speaker A: 390,000,000,000. Our friends Wells Fargo in 2010 did this standard Charter. 265,000,000,000 billion with a b versus, like $100 to $300 million. Right? And these are banks. These are banks doing this. So what, David? Should we shut down the banks? Like, just shut down banks?
00:30:43.190 - 00:30:52.186, Speaker B: I'm sorry. No bank has ever given me any privacy services. Like, what have they done for me? Tornado cash gave me privacy services. These banks didn't do shit for me.
00:30:52.208 - 00:31:19.178, Speaker A: Ryan, if the rationale is that smart contract code can be used by money launderers, we also know that banks can be used and are used by money launderers. And by the way, these are just the ones we've caught. Okay? So in that rationale, we're trying to sanction the smart contract code. Should we also sanction all banks? Right. This is not the way to handle the situation. It appears very egregious to me. But, David, maybe we should talk about the conversation on Twitter.
00:31:19.178 - 00:31:32.010, Speaker A: And that is part two of our story here, because there are a lot of implications. There's some backlash, too, but there are a lot of implications of getting smart contract code on the OFAC list. What is the first implication here, and what are we looking at?
00:31:32.080 - 00:32:24.394, Speaker B: Yeah, this is going back to the chilling effect that has been created as a result of this OFAC SDN list of tornado cash. So Micah Zoltul, he put out a tweet saying, adding to the shame list, Opensea, DyDX, and Microsoft, because Microsoft owns GitHub. And he says all of these companies have gone beyond what the sanctioned laws required. They didn't just obey an unjust order, they went out of their way to do additional injustice. And so there's been this meme created about these, the over complior. And so I'm over complying. Did you see the OFAC editions today modifies node to censor transactions? Seven hops from tornado, cash fire and AML report there's all these people in the ecosystem that are just like doing these things that was not requested of them, not related to the OFAC SDN list, and is censoring and prohibiting freedoms and users from doing the things that they want.
00:32:24.394 - 00:32:25.098, Speaker B: Well, it's true.
00:32:25.184 - 00:32:29.274, Speaker A: Everyone on Ethereum with an ETH address is probably two or three hops, maybe four hops away.
00:32:29.392 - 00:32:53.006, Speaker B: We know that was an analysis. Like the 90% of Ethereum addresses are two hops away from a tornado cash user. That's probably because of the aggregation of centralized exchanges. But whatever. Sure, some of the people doing this ave had a front end block. So Anthony Cesano, one of the recipients of two Sazzle eth, a 0.1 eth from the tornado cache, like dusting, that happened, he got blocked from the ave.
00:32:53.006 - 00:32:57.166, Speaker B: Front end Ave has recently since then pulled back all of this front end blocking.
00:32:57.198 - 00:33:03.926, Speaker A: But they was a third party that they use for the blocking, right? They said we got to get more control over the third party. And it's just the UI, not the.
00:33:03.948 - 00:33:06.530, Speaker B: Smart contract, but still even just the UI.
00:33:06.610 - 00:33:07.686, Speaker A: I get it.
00:33:07.868 - 00:33:31.230, Speaker B: Duidx blocking tornado cache user. So if you've used tornado cache, you get blocked from DuiDX. And these are things that they are not required of them. And so this triggered a conversation on Twitter is like, yo, is Ethereum going to just bend over backwards and become like the censorship chain? And this triggered a huge conversation inside of the Ethereum community.
00:33:31.380 - 00:34:32.478, Speaker A: Well, there was a back and forth that I had over the weekend with Antonio, and I want to make kind of like, because it's important not to get overly purist about this as well, right? And so I tweeted out, and this is around the time of where I was starting to see UI blockages from the OSAC. It's time for Defi to grow some backbone and fight back instead of just blocking eth addresses. Unelected bureaucrats, blacklisting citizens without cause or due process is unconstitutional, illegal and incompatible with the free society. If it doesn't stop here, it just gets worse. And then Antonio, who is the founder of DyDX he was like, what am I supposed to Ryan, like, are you saying you want me to go to jail? And if you're saying that, then why don't you spin up a front end of tornado cash? Why don't you put some stake in the game? And to be clear, that's really not what I'm saying. Right. It's like I replied to him, no, it's not time to go to jail.
00:34:32.478 - 00:35:04.574, Speaker A: Let's be smart. But also, on the other hand, it's not time for Defi David to sit down and die. And I really feel like this week has been a wake up call for DeFi. We have to catch our breath. We have to organize. We have to develop some strategy around this, deploy some resources and execute. I'm not saying now is the time to go to jail for an organization like DYDX, but we have to find strategic legal ways to push back on this, to protest and to move crypto and Defi forward.
00:35:04.574 - 00:35:07.086, Speaker A: And I think this has been a wake up call for that.
00:35:07.268 - 00:35:47.894, Speaker B: Yeah, certainly. But it's actually gotten even worse. It has been the conversation of this fork of Geth, which is facetiously being called OfAC Geth, which is a version of Geth that does not propagate transactions or validate blocks with sanctioned transactions. This is Stefan from Flashbots, who is actually going to come out on the podcast on Monday. But he's being facetious about this. I'm not saying he's actually creating OFAC Geth, but the conversation to bring up the conversation is that there's this world where we have these Ethereum clients that download a list of sanctioned Ethereum addresses and just don't include transactions from those Ethereum addresses.
00:35:47.942 - 00:35:49.430, Speaker A: It's in the base layer software.
00:35:49.510 - 00:36:19.682, Speaker B: This is the base layer software, which creates protocol level censorship, which in my mind is bad. But the point is it triggered this conversation, which is really, really, it was a great conversation that the community had on crypto, Twitter. And then, so the next part of this conversation, I think, was really triggered by Lefteris. Can't pronounce his last name. Sorry. He goes, question for Lido, Coinbase, Kraken staked us and bitcoin Suisse. These are all the biggest Ethereum stakers.
00:36:19.682 - 00:37:16.098, Speaker B: And he asked them, if a regulator asked you to censor at the Ethereum protocol level with your validators, what would you do? Would you, a, comply and censor at the protocol level, or B, shut down the staking service in order to preserve network integrity? And he's retweeting a tweet that talks about just like if you add all these stakers together, you get something like 80 or 90% of all stake. And so this conversation really triggered just the conversation that flowed. And so Eric Wall, a man with very sharp edges, who's also very poignant, says, question for the Ethereum community. If a majority of stake chooses a in this poll, and this is the poll that Lefteris put, would you one x consider the censorship an attack on Ethereum and burn their stake via social consensus, and we'll define what social consensus is, or y tolerate the censorship. And then he scrolls down and actually puts a poll. And so the poll is x or y? X burn the stake. Y accept the censorship.
00:37:16.098 - 00:37:46.142, Speaker B: And coming in at 61%, we have the people chose x, 9% of people chose y. So a very stark difference. And then 30% of people picked show results. And so really, this is not really something that you can put into the protocol level that the Ethereum community will state, we will burn your stake if you censor. This is something that we need to communicate to each other as a community. Like these are our values and we're going to make these values explicit.
00:37:46.206 - 00:38:33.546, Speaker A: Well, can you just walk through that for people? Because I'm not sure everyone understands the mechanism of how a social fork could essentially burn people's stake and create a fork that is uncensored while the censored fork happens. Could you just walk through a scenario here? So let's say those stakers in Leftress's tweet become evil. We call it evil. Coinbase, kraken, all of them. And they decide, or just some of them. Yeah, and maybe it's not just they just say we have to comply with OFAC, and so we are now going to only validate blocks from every other block that is not on an OFAC sanction list. So essentially they create an OFAC sanctionable Ethereum base layer.
00:38:33.546 - 00:38:46.786, Speaker A: And because there's so much stake there, essentially a lot of blocks are not getting, they kind of control it. So what happens in this scenario? What is Eric Wall actually teeing up? What does the Ethereum social layer, layer zero do about this? Right.
00:38:46.808 - 00:39:46.118, Speaker B: So the scenario here is that if all of those listed entities, Coinbase, Lido, kraken, all the big stakers, all followed OFAC sanctions lists and didn't propagate any blocks that included transactions that came from an OFax sanctioned list. Basically, if you are an OFax sanctioned list block, you only get five out of a hundred blocks that will be validated by a staker who's not following the OFAC sanctioned list. So like five out of 100 blocks of your transactions only go through. So making Ethereum just really hard to use. And the Ethereum community threw this poll where 61 to nine say that we will not tolerate that and we will burn their stake via social consensus. What does that mean? In Ethereum we have this concept called slashing. And slashing is this very objective event of you're a proof of stake validator with a stake bond and you tried to process an invalid block, you lied to the blockchain, you did some irregular thing.
00:39:46.118 - 00:40:10.782, Speaker B: And that is completely objective. You publish two blocks and they're conflicting, trying to fork the chain, basically doing something invalid, and you're trying to attack the chain. That's what we do with slashing. That is objective and built into the protocol and going to happen automatically. Then there's this thing called social slashing, which is something is going on with a validator. Maybe it's coinbase, maybe it's lido. They're censoring an address.
00:40:10.782 - 00:40:53.102, Speaker B: Maybe they're censoring every single transaction. And so imagine all of these people, all of these 90% of stakers, Elido, Coinbase, Kraken. The government comes and says, hey, we want you to shut down Ethereum. And since you're producing 90% of blocks, we want your blocks to be completely empty. And then if they had a gun to their head, they would probably choose to not die and only publish empty blocks. And that would be censoring 90% of blocks that would go through Ethereum, making the blockchain really, really just troublesome and useless. And so in the event that this happens, you can't actually slash that person at the protocol level because it's more subjective as to what is going on.
00:40:53.102 - 00:41:31.622, Speaker B: As in Coinbase is not processing transactions that interact with Uniswap. They're still processing blocks. And the blocks are valid. They're just choosing to not include transactions that interact with Uniswap or interact with tornado cash or do something. And so how do we as a community get back our ability to use these defi apps? There's this thing called social slashing or a user activated soft fork. And so what this means is that because we have this unique property in Ethereum, that Coinbase, Kraken, Lido, these blocks are being proposed by specific Ethereum addresses. So we know these specific Ethereum addresses are censoring transactions.
00:41:31.622 - 00:41:57.806, Speaker B: And these specific ethereum addresses have some amount of ether staked with them. And so what we can do is we can fork the chain and we can do something that punishes them. We can either freeze their stake. The most nuclear option is you can just delete their entire stake. That would be pretty damn nuclear. We probably wouldn't do that on the first iteration. The thing that we probably do first is we would do what is called an inactivity leak.
00:41:57.806 - 00:42:26.390, Speaker B: We would prevent them from being able to validate the chain and they would be forced to withdraw their ether staked from the network. And during that time they are no longer able to process blocks. And then you could also slash them some arbitrary amount. We would have to decide this as a community. But I think the first step would be like, hey, we're just going to kick you out of the validator pool. We're not going to delete your ether. We're going to inactivity leak you, which means you are losing as much ether as you otherwise would be gaining if you were staking.
00:42:26.390 - 00:42:53.902, Speaker B: So forcing you to exit and kicking you out of the validator pool and only allowing validators who have not been censoring. And this is a social slashing event. This is a user activated softfork. This is something that the community would have to coordinate around, saying, hey, ofac made Coinbase and Lido and Kraken. They made them, by the powers of the nation state, the monopoly on violence. They made them censor transactions. And we do not accept that in the base layer.
00:42:53.902 - 00:43:25.722, Speaker B: And so we are going to coordinate around a fork. And what that fork does is that kicks these validators out of the validating pool and they must withdraw their ETH, or else it's just like in limbo if they don't. And so this is what's called a user activated soft fork. And it's something that can only be done by social consensus of the Ethereum community, which is why this poll from Eric Wall is so important, because it's showing that a 61 to nine ratio of Ethereum community members says that we will do this if our entities censor transactions.
00:43:25.786 - 00:44:16.318, Speaker A: Now, this is a Twitter poll of like, it's not necessarily reflective of everyone, of course, but what David's describing is basically the end game scenario here. So a bunch of stakers, centralized stakers, decide that they are going to censor Ethereum via OFAC, okay? The community says, we're not running that software, we're continuing to run the original non ofac version of Geth. We'll fork you. This is the true Ethereum. And then they're trying to run an OFAC version or a censored version of Ethereum and it's forked. So you have eTh on both chains, you have every defi app that needs to select which one to spend their resources on. The community has to decide a set of validators which one to essentially run, which software to run, and it's a fork war.
00:44:16.318 - 00:45:08.174, Speaker A: And may the best fork win. And I think, David, in every single case, what will happen is as long as we have a social layer around Ethereum that says, look, censorship, resistance is baked into the base layer of the Ethereum project. This is the true Ethereum, that the non censorable version of Ethereum will win in the end. And the reason it will win, we know this from a game theory perspective, is why would China go deploy and trust the OFAC version of Ethereum that's completely us controlled? They're not going to. So the state will continue to collect to the non sensible version of Ethereum and the community will eventually win. This is what I mean. As long as you have a layer, zero, a social layer that is upholding these values and willing to run the original version of Ethereum that is non censored, we win.
00:45:08.174 - 00:45:19.938, Speaker A: And this is what would happen. It would be a messy outcome. The cool news, I think, is if you're an ETH holder, you just get eth on the OFAC version of the chain. You could sell that if you want to.
00:45:20.024 - 00:45:22.514, Speaker B: Dump that because it doesn't align with your values. Dump that.
00:45:22.552 - 00:45:42.394, Speaker A: It doesn't align your values if you want to. Or you could keep it, you could do whatever you want and then you could run validators on the real Ethereum chain that is uncensored. That's where you'll find me. You're going to find me on the non censored Ethereum chain. I think a large portion of the community, you'll find them there too. By the way, this same mechanism plays out in bitcoin, does it not? Yes.
00:45:42.432 - 00:46:12.686, Speaker B: And this is a great history lesson so we can move forward. One of the reasons why I focus on this, yeah, this conversation on tornado cash happened on crypto, Twitter. It's really important that this conversation happened because a lot of new people came into Ethereum in the last like 12, 18, 24 months that are still learning concepts like this. And so we have to have these conversations out in the public where the Ethereum community defines like, hey, these are our values. Like, no censorship at the base layer. And so this conversation continues. Eric Connor retweeted Eric Wall and says, I do agree with Eric.
00:46:12.686 - 00:46:56.626, Speaker B: We should make it known as a community that we stakers will burn the stake of any entity, burn at the stake any entity that tries to censure transactions, no matter the reason. These are the values that we're indoctrinating, we're instantiating into our layer one. Now, going back to what you just said about the user activated software has been a mechanism that the crypto world has seen before. We've done this once before. So Eric wall put out this fantastic Twitter thread, which I'm going to read here. And he goes as the Ethereum community gears up to prepare for its user activated software defenses to force any validator to think thrice before bending over to OFAC, there's going to be a lot of snark from bitcoiners. And so we'll talk about the bitcoiner relevancy here.
00:46:56.626 - 00:47:27.878, Speaker B: It's envy. User activated soft forking is the single most exciting thing that you can do in crypto. Bitcoiners had their user activated soft fork moment in 2017, and it is their proudest moment. I am a bitcoiner, and it is my proudest bitcoin moment. The idea that ethereum would even be even close to achieving something similar is the most annoying thing that could ever happen. They'll never let you have it. The entire bitcoin rhetoric relies on the reason that they were able to pull off their user activated soft fork is because users ran full nodes.
00:47:27.878 - 00:48:09.250, Speaker B: This is the basis for the entire design philosophy. It is true that the ability to run a full node is useful in a user activated soft fork, but annoyingly, ethereum can still pull it off, annoyingly to bitcoiners. First off, ethereum users can run nodes despite what bitcoiners will tell you, even if the default is succinct using state commitments. That doesn't mean you can't enforce a user activated software, you, of course can. Secondly, the outcome of a user activated software is much more of a market phenomenon anyways. You still win a user activated software just by demonstrating superior pricing power. So, meaning that if you're not a person who doesn't know how to run a node or doesn't want to, you can still dump all of your ofac eth and buy all of your censorship.
00:48:09.330 - 00:48:11.366, Speaker A: What's the true ethereum? Is it eth classic?
00:48:11.398 - 00:48:33.642, Speaker B: It's the one that has a higher price, right? And so eric wall continues and goes, all of these things should be narrative violations for bitcoiners. Ethereums should not be able to user activated soft fork is a core bitcoin thesis and I'll say this, bitcoiners are better at user activating soft fork than ethereums. They are, but they weren't born without ability. They were taught that they had this power. What is that word, ryan?
00:48:33.706 - 00:48:37.140, Speaker A: I have no idea. Jollen fry? I don't know.
00:48:37.590 - 00:49:07.850, Speaker B: Ethereums can be taught the same. Basically saying that bitcoiners don't have a monopoly on the concept of a user activated soft fork. What most people don't know is that if Ethereum's master user activated soft fork under proof of stake, they gain access to a weapon that is more powerful than the user activated soft fork of bitcoiners. This is because a user activated soft fork in proof of stake can selectively punish censoring validators. I talked about this earlier, bitcoin. You can't selectively punish a minor in proof of work. If a majority of hash rate censoring, you have to build more hash rate than the attacker, which is possible.
00:49:07.850 - 00:49:29.662, Speaker B: It just is hard and takes time. The non censoring miners also earn transaction fees that the censoring miners do not. I wanted to mention this earlier. If you have, like, OFAC guess, and you have 90% of block stakers that are not processing OFAC non compliant transactions, the remaining 10% of stakers actually make more money because they do get to process those transactions.
00:49:29.726 - 00:49:29.954, Speaker A: Right?
00:49:29.992 - 00:49:58.378, Speaker B: So you're actually rationally incentivized to process the illicit transactions. If you can't overpower the attacker on proof of work, the only option is the nuclear one. You change the proof of work function and vaporize the entire billion dollar mining industry in one shot. But you also kill the honest miners in proof of stake. There is currently $25 billion of east securing the chain. If 10 billion of that is involved in censoring, you can surgically vaporize the bad part, and you keep the $15 billion of remaining honest acres on your.
00:49:58.384 - 00:50:01.542, Speaker A: Side, and you vaporize it on your fork.
00:50:01.686 - 00:50:02.246, Speaker B: On your fork.
00:50:02.278 - 00:50:17.166, Speaker A: The non censored fork. Right. So it's like punitive actions, like, hey, you're going to pay for this, guys, because your fork's not going to be successful. Ours is. And on the successful Ethereum fork, you won't have any of your eth. That is like the stick that social fork can yield.
00:50:17.278 - 00:50:46.406, Speaker B: It's brilliantly elegant because you reward the honest people and you punish the negative people. Now, Ryan, I've always been curious about this because you and I could take our crypto Twitter conversations into this weekly roll up quite a lot. And I'm actually cognizant that I think maybe like 25 33% of listeners are actually on crypto Twitter. And so I've always been kind of curious, like, damn. From the perspective of the listeners. Like damn. Ryan and David are always concerned about the bitcoiners and the bitcoin, maxis and the tribes.
00:50:46.406 - 00:51:14.610, Speaker B: I want to go to the quote tweets from Eric Wall's first tweet. And so this is the set of quote tweets, people that retweeted Eric Wall's tweet. And you're going to get two classes of people here. One is ethereum's retweeting the tweet saying I vote x, I vote to slash. And the other is you have bitcoiners trying to brigade brigand the poll and saying bitcoiners vote. Why? Because it makes ethereum look bad.
00:51:14.680 - 00:51:32.874, Speaker A: Can I just say, whenever you're saying bitcoiners, I want to make sure that you are talking about not everyone who owns bitcoin, but a specific subset of bitcoiner, which is a bitcoin maximalist who wants all other chains to fail and only bitcoin to succeed. That's what you're talking about when you're shorthanding bitcoiners, when Eric Wall is doing that as well.
00:51:32.992 - 00:51:40.486, Speaker B: If you're not on crypto Twitter, you're not exposed to these tribes that are warriors and these zero sum games that are being played.
00:51:40.518 - 00:51:43.454, Speaker A: And we're overexposed and we are overexposed to these people.
00:51:43.492 - 00:52:12.918, Speaker B: So, yeah, if you want to scroll down, Ryan, and just see some of these conversations, because the list of quote tweets just keep scrolling. Just go through all of them. There's so many. The list of quote tweets, again, it's like, here's stats, sex and snacks at it's time for bitcoin. Imagine what it would feel like to know the integrity of your favorite shitcoin depends entirely on both stablecoin custodians in a status mole rat that lives in a hundred million dollar la mansion to do the right thing, even though it could sink them. Cry harder. I don't know.
00:52:12.918 - 00:52:43.200, Speaker B: These bitcoiners are insane, dude. These maxis are insane. And so again, there's two types of quote tweeters here. People that are Ethereum saying I vote x, and then people that are bitcoin Maxis trying to manipulate and attack the Ethereum community because of exactly what Eric Wall was saying. It's envy. He says the user activated software incorporates the most single exciting thing you can do in crypto. And bitcoiners don't want ethereums to have this power because right now it's the only thing that the bitcoiners have.
00:52:43.200 - 00:52:45.498, Speaker B: Maxis.
00:52:45.674 - 00:52:48.650, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's what's going on. What are we looking at here, David?
00:52:48.730 - 00:53:03.158, Speaker B: This is a meme again. The Ethereum community is taking this opportunity to meme into existence. This is the Prex X to doubt meme, but it's press x to slash. The entire Ethereum community is like, yo, we will absolutely slash anyone who invalidates our value.
00:53:03.244 - 00:53:42.606, Speaker A: And look, so here's the thing. A lot of this is talk conversation on Twitter, blah, blah, blah. I mean, at the end of the day, if this ever happened by the such, I just want to emphasize this is still incredibly remote. This is a conversation in crypto Twitter. But there is no talk of OFAC or the coinbases of the world or any of the validators running sanctioned code, running censored code here and complying with OFAC's sanctions. And OFAC is not even asking about. So this is just a remote probability that I feel like the crypto space went and ran with this week as a thought exercise, but it's a useful thought exercise, but it's still incredibly remote.
00:53:42.606 - 00:54:25.600, Speaker A: And this is, by the way, we have the stick, but we also have kind of the carrot, I think, for people who are centralized staking providers. So Brian Armstrong actually replied to Lecteris's tweet when he asked, if regulators ask you to censor, do you comply and censor, or do you shut down your staking service if you're a coinbase? Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, says, it's a hypothetical important to note we hopefully won't actually face. But if we did, I pick option B. I would exit Coinbase would stop staking, it would not censor transactions, it would not run the OFAC sanctioned validator code.
00:54:25.970 - 00:54:36.786, Speaker B: Worth to note that the Coinbase staking is extremely profitable. They make a ton of money. And Brian is saying, instead of censoring the chain and compromising the integrity of Ethereum, we will shut down that business.
00:54:36.888 - 00:54:52.666, Speaker A: Just we won't do it. And what will happen if they shut down? More people will have to kind of run their own nodes, obviously. So I think we've got a lot of defenses against the state level of censorship, resistance, and I think more defenses in a proof of stake world.
00:54:52.768 - 00:55:23.442, Speaker B: And it's definitely worth noting that these large entity stakers like Lido, Coinbase, et cetera, they're highly incentivized to not censor the chain because they don't want to piss off the will. We'll punish you. We have that power. And so the fact that this conversation is happening and the ethereum community is planting a flag saying, hey, if you censor our transactions, we're going to kick you out, we'll fork you and we'll burn your stake. And so they have to pick b because the community is forcing them to do that.
00:55:23.496 - 00:55:44.150, Speaker A: They have a fiduciary responsibility to pick b because they could get screwed. Imagine if they got slashed and they lost all of their depositors money, right? What are the costs of that? So even just the prospect of us being able to do this and this rhetoric on Twitter of like, you do this and we'll floor and we'll slash that, reins them in. They can't take the risk.
00:55:44.230 - 00:55:54.270, Speaker B: It's about having this user activated software as a threat without actually using it. The fact that it's an option nuclear us from having us to use mutually assured destruction, baby. Exactly.
00:55:54.420 - 00:55:57.054, Speaker A: Do it. Don't do it though.
00:55:57.172 - 00:55:58.142, Speaker B: Please don't do it.
00:55:58.196 - 00:56:20.274, Speaker A: This will be fine. We don't have to fight. There were some bad takes though, on terrible, I think on this. Terrible takes and love Ryan Selkis, previous guest on bankruptcy. Respect a lot of his ideas. He did not have the best take this week, but I think it's a summation of a lot of people who were saying like, bitcoin was looking great and ethereum was looking very censored. What was his take here? Yeah.
00:56:20.312 - 00:56:43.998, Speaker B: Ryan Selkis says ethereum is amazing, but I don't get the sense most in the ethereum have the stomach to full decentral, to push full decentralizing without compromises. USCC, of course, and OFAC imparting that. And then he follows up. Bitcoin remains metal af. Both are important for the decades ahead. But let's be honest, eth is fintech three, not web3. Absolutely terrible take.
00:56:43.998 - 00:56:45.742, Speaker B: Ryan, come. Love you, though.
00:56:45.796 - 00:56:46.746, Speaker A: Love you, Ryan.
00:56:46.858 - 00:57:01.380, Speaker B: And so I follow up and I say tornado cash is banned in the United States, yet tornado cash is up and running. Ethereum is fulfilling its promise on unstoppable applications. Metal AF, like subtweeting Ryan Selkis here.
00:57:01.830 - 00:57:05.460, Speaker A: You don't get points if you don't even have privacy at the base.
00:57:05.830 - 00:57:15.990, Speaker B: So, like, people are just obsessed with giving bitcoin so much credit. It's like, well, you didn't see bitcoin get banned. You don't get credit for not having any useful application show up at the game.
00:57:16.060 - 00:57:17.842, Speaker A: It's on the bench. Okay?
00:57:17.996 - 00:57:25.994, Speaker B: Bitcoin is just like this neutered app chain. You can only get coin mixing at the centralized level, which has also been.
00:57:26.032 - 00:57:47.378, Speaker A: Banned before bitcoin, because besides transfers, bitcoin uses basically its banking layer, its privacy layer. Doesn't have one. Doesn't have a privacy layer. But if you did want to use quote unquote privacy, it would be through centralized exchanges, which are fully OFAC compliant. You're not in the game, guys. I love bitcoin. It's really important.
00:57:47.378 - 00:58:01.346, Speaker A: But you're not in the privacy game. That's why OFAC is not bothering you. Nation states aren't bothering you is because you don't have a tornado cash on chain. That does not make you bitcoin stronger, okay? That just makes them not participating in the game that ethereum's playing.
00:58:01.458 - 00:58:24.254, Speaker B: We're jumping around here, but here's a tweet of all these annoying bitcoiners that are on crypto Twitter that are extremely toxic. Eric Wall again says the bitcoin maxis want you to fail. You haven't even started and they're already laughing their ass off. This doesn't even include all bitcoiners, though. I'm a bitcoiner and I will help in far as I'm able. And he's put in four screenshots of just the typical example of a toxic bitcoin maxi. And this is like Dr.
00:58:24.254 - 00:58:41.778, Speaker B: Bitcoin MD, a famous bitcoiner on crypto Twitter, just like laughing at the possibility of a user activated soft fork in Ethereum. Basically, there's like this cohort of bitcoiners that want to see Ethereum fail, and they think that they are just about to dance on Ethereum's grave right now because they don't think Ethereum has the.
00:58:41.784 - 00:59:08.838, Speaker A: Guts from a base principles perspective. So for me, the value set, the base principle, is freedom. It's decentralization, it's privacy, it's censorship, resistance, okay? And any chain, doesn't matter what it is, any chain that supports those base principles, I support. To the extent bitcoin supports that, I'm a bitcoiner. To the extent Ethereum supports that, I am Ethereum. To the extent solana supports that, or freaking tron supports that in the future. Or Cardano.
00:59:08.838 - 00:59:32.386, Speaker A: I'm a Cardinian, a tronian salonian. I don't know. But it's not about a specific tribe or a specific coin or a specific asset. It's about a specific set of ideals that we're protecting another take here, an equally bad take. I think this is from Kevin O'Leary, another previous bankless guest. We love you, Kevin. You've got a lot of great takes.
00:59:32.386 - 00:59:45.830, Speaker A: This was not one of them. This is a hell no. Kevin O'Leary says, essentially, I'm glad the tornado cash developer was arrested. Now we get to move on. We get to be more regulated. I'll read some of the direct quotes. I think we're getting to that stage now.
00:59:45.830 - 01:00:06.174, Speaker A: Kevin says, maybe we're in the third or fourth inning towards that, but I'm tired of this crypto cowboy crap. He's talking about privacy here in tornado. I want to get involved in a regulated place where we can bring billions of dollars to work. I want that, too. I don't need to be a crypto cowboy, and I don't want to be one, because I work in the regulated world. Okay? Understand that. But this is the take that really gets me.
01:00:06.174 - 01:00:14.938, Speaker A: At the end of the day, it's okay to arrest that guy, the tornado cash developer. Why? He's messing with the primal forces of regulation.
01:00:15.114 - 01:00:17.250, Speaker B: What do you think we're doing here, Kevin?
01:00:17.830 - 01:00:33.080, Speaker A: If we have to sacrifice him, that's okay, because we want to have some stability in that institutional capital. It is not okay to sacrifice an open source developer who is working on the public good. I know why I'm here, and it's not for that.
01:00:33.930 - 01:00:41.660, Speaker B: He says, we are messing with the primal forces of regulation. That's why I'm here, Ryan. That's what I'm here to do.
01:00:42.910 - 01:01:08.018, Speaker A: Well, it's just there's different kind of cohorts and reasons. We get different tribes. Crypto tribes certainly worrying it out. Well, we also get people who are just here for the money, and that's okay. But you got to rest on top of the base principles of why the social layer is here. Another bad take. But the question of all of this is, David, what can we do about this? All right, so what is this JW Varrett person doing? Who is.
01:01:08.018 - 01:01:12.738, Speaker A: I believe he's a legal professor and a lawyer. What is he doing?
01:01:12.904 - 01:02:00.386, Speaker B: Writes very eloquently. He tweets out, I bite ofac in the nose over their vague sanction of tornado cash. I applied to OFAC for a license in a way that would either obviate the harm that they did or give my nonprofit, the crypto freedom lab, standing to sue them if they deny my license. I think he's basically saying I've put ofac in a corner. Either answer that they give me opens back up tornado cash and he wrote this very eloquent, concise blog post about the choice rule that he's forced ofac into. And basically saying either way, either they take option a and tornado cash becomes freely accessible to everyone again, or option b, and then they give me grounds to sue them and I will sue them. So we have this individual going after OFAC right now.
01:02:00.408 - 01:02:09.734, Speaker A: It's great. JW varrot. We applaud just oFac might just take option C, which is don't reply to these things, which they often do, which.
01:02:09.772 - 01:02:12.102, Speaker B: He also stated that he will sue them for as well.
01:02:12.236 - 01:02:13.014, Speaker A: Nice.
01:02:13.212 - 01:02:14.006, Speaker B: Good job.
01:02:14.108 - 01:02:34.042, Speaker A: JW has all his bases covered. We applaud efforts like this. Also, coin center is doing some fantastic things. So just three of what they're doing. First of all, they're seeking to engage of, not let's in all of this, let's not attribute to malice, which may just be incompetence. They may not know what a smart contract is. They may not know the importance of privacy.
01:02:34.042 - 01:02:53.794, Speaker A: Let's make some space for that. Coin center is going to help OFAC with some of these things. Maybe. Second, there are some innocent Americans who have funds deposited in tornado cash, and they don't know whether they can take the funds out or not. My guess is probably not. None of this is legal advice. Don't know.
01:02:53.794 - 01:03:13.290, Speaker A: But coins center is helping those citizens. And then finally, they said they're beginning to explore with counsel a court challenge to this action. Stay tuned. All right, so that's what our crypto lobbyist friends are doing. We applaud coin center for doing that. I think, David, there are a few long term things we could work on. All right.
01:03:13.290 - 01:04:01.850, Speaker A: The very first politician who comes out with a recognition and a need that we all have for a digital bill of rights, I am supportful of that platform because, David, we need a digital bill of rights that protects our privacy, that protects our cryptography, that gives us the right to own our own private keys, that gives us the right to run our own software, that recognizes that code is speech for all citizens. Some of these rights are implied in the constitution with freedom of speech. I think it's now time, as we transition to this digital era, to make this more explicit. I would support laws on the books towards this. That needs to happen, but it's going to be a slow process. The other thing we can do, of course, is start to form prototypical crypto nation states, network states, as Belagi calls them. So imagine a crypto native country.
01:04:01.850 - 01:04:27.986, Speaker A: This is a decades long project. It'll take years to get to this. But imagine if we set up such a constitution for digital freedom where we enshrined property rights in Ethereum and other smart contract chains. We made sort of Yukoda's law from financial perspective. We backed our currency by ETH and bitcoin. We had citizen level ids that are maybe verified credentials or soul bound nfts. We use DeFi as our banking system.
01:04:27.986 - 01:04:57.622, Speaker A: We use Daos for capital formation. That idea from Belagi's burned in my head of like, let's start to work on this project. We can eventually get un recognition maybe years down the road. Even if we fail, this could be a prototype that other countries look at and they're, huh, you guys had some good ideas here. Like, maybe we should incorporate some of that because it's been successful. So that's another thing we can do. And then lastly, David, what is Gitcoin up to and how can we help actually donate as individuals?
01:04:57.766 - 01:05:48.246, Speaker B: Well, there's plenty of privacy forward and also open source software freedom projects on gitcoin. And so Gitcoin is like four grant rounds a year, I believe. The next one coming up on September 6 7th. There is a $3 million matching fund, as in there's $3 million out there to be matched for other donations. So, Ryan, you put out this bundle or this request for bundling of the top three to ten projects fighting for free speech and privacy and give them money because you know what moves the needle the most money in the gitcoin, there's going to be this privacy bundle which you can just donate to in net, and all of your money will be matched by this $3 million matching fund coin center, I'm sure will be in there. There are other efforts as well, but money moves.
01:05:48.278 - 01:06:00.014, Speaker A: Needles, save your money for September 7. We're going to kick this off. We're going to promote it on bankless, and, yeah, we're going to fund where our values are in the future. Wow. That was a lot, but.
01:06:00.052 - 01:06:04.766, Speaker B: I think it was a lot, but it was very significant. It was by far the most significant happened thing that happened.
01:06:04.788 - 01:06:08.578, Speaker A: Totally agree. All right. With that, let's move on to some other things, David, and on to the.
01:06:08.584 - 01:06:20.226, Speaker B: Bad boys of the crypto industry. Celsius owes 6.7 billion in crypto assets, and they only hold, Ryan, 3.8 billion of crypto assets. Rut row. Those are different numbers.
01:06:20.408 - 01:06:21.430, Speaker A: That's a delta there.
01:06:21.500 - 01:06:30.922, Speaker B: Yeah, there's a small delta there. I mean, this isn't anything new, but we're just getting more and more insight into the state of these Celsius books. And it is what you would call down bad.
01:06:31.056 - 01:06:47.280, Speaker A: It's a sorry state. Did you know, David, Financial Times reported that Alex Machinsky actually took control of Celsius trading right before the bankruptcy? So he was like, oh, things are going bad. I know what to do. I'll be the captain. I'll start trading. I'll fix this.
01:06:47.970 - 01:06:53.514, Speaker B: I'm pretty sure this is called revenge trading, and I know hate trading.
01:06:53.562 - 01:06:54.160, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:06:54.690 - 01:07:05.154, Speaker B: One last trade to get us out of the. So we watched Celsius do this. They were like, instead of paying down their debt, they were just adding more and more collateral to their maker, Dow position.
01:07:05.192 - 01:07:07.870, Speaker A: You got to take riskier and riskier bets to get yourself out of the hole.
01:07:07.950 - 01:07:10.646, Speaker B: Right. And that was Alex. That was Alex doing that.
01:07:10.828 - 01:07:11.762, Speaker A: Nice job, Alex.
01:07:11.826 - 01:07:19.960, Speaker B: Nice job, Alex. Just complete service to your entire company and customers and also grifting off of the whole defi name. Just a grifter of the.
01:07:22.010 - 01:07:32.720, Speaker A: Yeah, it's pretty crazy and actually reminds me sort of the 3 hours capital story. They just kept doubling down and doubling down, and they made the COVID of a magazine, the New York magazine, but not in a good way.
01:07:33.730 - 01:07:40.990, Speaker B: The title of this magazine is how two wall street washouts with a can't lose crypto headfund vaporize a trillion dollars.
01:07:41.140 - 01:07:44.746, Speaker A: The crash, a trillion dollars. Can you imagine?
01:07:44.938 - 01:07:47.266, Speaker B: Imagine having that associated with your name?
01:07:47.368 - 01:07:50.306, Speaker A: Are we at the point where we can laugh about this, David? A little bit.
01:07:50.408 - 01:08:23.310, Speaker B: I mean, I've been laughing about this through and through. If you're going to bleed out your eyeballs about this thing, you're just not going to make it in crypto. You got to see the silver lining of guess. The COVID of New Yorker for the podcast listener is kind of Od. It's like those two bitmoji type emojis for Suzu and Kyle. And then the actual article itself is like these just actually kind of cool illustrations of them with, like, sparkles in their teeth. Yeah, I don't know what to make about that.
01:08:23.310 - 01:08:41.746, Speaker B: In the small excerpt from the article, among Crypto's smartest observers, there's a widely held view that three arrows capital is meaningly responsible for the larger crypto crash of 2022, as market chaos and forced selling sends bitcoin and other digital assets plunging 17% or more, erasing more than a trillion dollars in value.
01:08:41.848 - 01:08:42.898, Speaker A: I'd say that's true.
01:08:42.984 - 01:08:57.718, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree with that. Yeah. Sam Bankman Fried says that in the article. I suspect they might be 80% of the total original contagion they weren't the only people who blew up, but they did it way bigger than anyone else, and they had way more trust than the ecosystem prior to that.
01:08:57.804 - 01:08:58.006, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:08:58.028 - 01:09:03.994, Speaker B: So this article is basically claiming that a trillion dollars of vaporized wealth was due to three errors. Capital contagion, which.
01:09:04.032 - 01:09:19.258, Speaker A: That sounds about right. Yeah, I'm kind of done with David. Like, I know we want to cover it in pieces, but I hope this is getting near to the end of talking about these guys. I saw Do Kwan did an interview last week. I don't even care. I'm not going to watch it. I just don't care anymore.
01:09:19.258 - 01:09:25.694, Speaker A: Right. Like, let's move on as an industry, learn what we can from these mistakes.
01:09:25.822 - 01:09:27.806, Speaker B: Is no one going to jail?
01:09:27.998 - 01:09:28.850, Speaker A: I don't know.
01:09:28.920 - 01:09:29.426, Speaker B: Is no one.
01:09:29.448 - 01:09:32.830, Speaker A: Tornadoes, developers gone to jail, potentially.
01:09:32.910 - 01:09:47.910, Speaker B: You're telling me Alex Machinsky, who traded customers funds outside of the scope of the product, not going to jail. Three arrows capital, who defrauded investors? Not going to jail. Doe Kwan's not going. Why aren't people going to jail?
01:09:48.490 - 01:09:51.982, Speaker A: Because they didn't write free open source privacy software. David.
01:09:52.146 - 01:09:52.758, Speaker B: Jesus.
01:09:52.854 - 01:10:06.202, Speaker A: Where's the justice in the world? I don't know. Maybe in time it'll sort itself out. Not sure. But like, hey, it's back to layer zero. We got to protect these freedoms and hold people accountable in the right ways. Some more crypto contagion, though. Genesis CEO.
01:10:06.202 - 01:10:31.446, Speaker A: This is the largest centralized crypto lending and borrowing OTC desk on the planet by far. The CEO just stepped down. He'd been working as CEO for like seven years. And Genesis also cut staff by 20%. This is more 3 hours. Capital contagion just took, I guess, a couple of months for it to catch up with Genesis and for these headlines to break, I guess, more down bad. All right.
01:10:31.468 - 01:10:42.106, Speaker B: And that is the recap of that thus far. I hope that this is kind of like the last recap of this that we get until somebody gets charged with something that would actually be a turning of the page of this whole, or.
01:10:42.128 - 01:10:43.402, Speaker A: I get my Celsius money back.
01:10:43.456 - 01:11:11.438, Speaker B: Orion gets his Celsius money back. Coming up next in the weekly roll up. Of course, the exact merge time down to the second, although it's going to change. We have down to the second. The current predicted merge time and Taiwan using ipfs ahead of just trying to protect themselves from China cyber attacks. What is going on there? That's an interesting development. So we're going to get to all of these developments and more right after we hear from some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible.
01:11:11.438 - 01:11:50.906, Speaker B: Rocket pool is your friendly, decentralized Ethereum staking protocol. You can stake your eth with rocket pool and get our Eth in return, allowing you to stake your Eth and use it in DFI at the same time. You can get 4% on your eth by staking it with rocket pool, but you can get even more by running a node. Rocket pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating nodes. Running a rocket pool node is easier to set up than running a solo node, and you only need 16 ETH to get started. Why would you do this? You get an extra 15% staking commission on the pooled ETH, so your API is boosted. So if you're bullish east staking, you can increase your API and get some extra tokens by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pool network, which currently has over a thousand independent validators.
01:11:50.906 - 01:12:18.402, Speaker B: It's yield farming, but with Ethereum nodes you can get started@rocketpool.net and also join the Rocketpool community in their discord. You can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat, so I'll see you there. Juno is bringing crypto friendly banking straight into your checking account. With Juno, you can send money from your Juno checking account straight onto a L2 like polygon optimism arbitrum, and they have Zksync and Starknet support on their way. You can skip the Ach wait times. You can skip all the gas fees and go straight from your checking account to an Ethereum L2 in seconds.
01:12:18.402 - 01:12:37.418, Speaker B: Inside Juno, you can buy and sell crypto with zero dollar fees, and your Juno checking account comes with a metal Mastercard that gives you up to 5% cash back on your spending. Juno is also giving you $10 cash back on your first crypto deposit, and $100 when you set up a direct deposit. This ad just writes itself. So go sign up at Juno finance bankless.
01:12:37.514 - 01:12:54.302, Speaker A: All right, guys, we are back talking about the projected exact time, a precise time that the merge will happen. This is Marius, a tweeter from Twitter tweeting out he's finally back from vacation, and he ran some computation to confirm the TTD date for Mainnet.
01:12:54.366 - 01:13:30.222, Speaker B: And the projected date, according to the TTD, is September 14 at 1057 Paris time, and what that translates into is about 457 eastern time. The TTD is not actually a clock. It does not listen to the sun or go with the rotation of the earth. So as minor hash power goes up or down, this number moves forward or backward. But if we hold hash power constant, we are merging at September 14, at 04:57 p.m. Eastern time. That number is going to change.
01:13:30.356 - 01:13:42.194, Speaker A: Number is definitely going to change the precision of this tweet and this estimate. But it's coming right, like, 14th, 15th, 16th, somewhere in that range. Probably more likely the 14th or the 15th, would you say?
01:13:42.312 - 01:13:53.654, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm going to guess that this date moves up as it becomes earlier because I think miners will turn off. No one's investing more into hash power now.
01:13:53.692 - 01:13:55.862, Speaker A: Hash will go lower. Hash will go lower.
01:13:55.996 - 01:14:00.918, Speaker B: It will either stay exactly the same or go lower. Hash rate is not going to come online now.
01:14:01.004 - 01:14:08.554, Speaker A: It's too late. What time do you hope it is? I hope it doesn't happen on the 14th, like, early in the wee hours of the morning, although that'd be fine.
01:14:08.592 - 01:14:10.874, Speaker B: I would like to be awake for it. Yeah.
01:14:11.072 - 01:14:25.474, Speaker A: Because you want to just do a party. You want to just, like, there's some celebratory activity. It shouldn't be, like, early in the morning. Yeah. All right, merch party is on, guys. There's also another airdrop this week, actually, pretty significant one, I think.
01:14:25.512 - 01:14:50.818, Speaker B: Yeah, this is a big deal. Yeah. The safe airdrop for the gnosis safe. And so this is breaking as of, well, today, the time of recording gnosisafe published an eligible wallet address list. 50 million tokens. About 5% are available for airdrop claimers. If you have a gnosisafe wallet that had a certain amount of ETH in it.
01:14:50.818 - 01:15:13.600, Speaker B: So a little bit of a surprise. I don't think people saw a gnosis safe wallet token coming. So if you had a multi sig, a gnosis multisig with more than ten ETh in it, and it also made two transactions. You got the airdrop wrapped. Ether or ether are considered no other assets. And the minimum distributed was 400 tokens, although I don't know what the total supply is.
01:15:14.130 - 01:15:25.090, Speaker A: Go pick that airdrop up. We will include a link to the show notes where you can click on that, see if you are eligible or not. I guess they just raised money, you know, airdrop on the back of that, maybe?
01:15:25.160 - 01:15:29.826, Speaker B: I guess. So why does the multi sig need a token? Ryan, I'm confused.
01:15:29.938 - 01:15:39.018, Speaker A: Hey, you said everything that can be tokenized will be tokenized. I recall you saying that on bankless podcast. My, that I did say that.
01:15:39.184 - 01:15:42.860, Speaker B: I guess this one confuses me.
01:15:43.790 - 01:15:47.820, Speaker A: Well, it can be tokenized, so according to Hoffman's law, it will be.
01:15:48.270 - 01:15:52.826, Speaker B: I don't even agree with Hoffman's law anymore, but it's still working. It's still working as a law.
01:15:52.928 - 01:15:59.422, Speaker A: It hasn't yet been disproven. All right, so it's still a good thesis. Opensea, what are they up to on the NFT world?
01:15:59.476 - 01:16:56.686, Speaker B: Yeah, so there's been this controversy with Opensea's policy on stolen nfts. So if an NFT was stolen by an exploiter or hacker, that hacker might go and then sell that, and then Opensea would report that NFT as stolen and then freeze it. But the problem is a legitimate buyer would buy a stolen NFT and then Opensea would freeze that legitimate buyer's NFT, basically freezing them out of the liquidity of Opensea. This caused a big consternation, big problem with the community, because you had legitimate buyers coming to buy nfts on OpenSea that were sold by thieves before OpenSea could flag these nfts as stolen. So Opensea is changing that policy. What's going on is that they are still freezing stolen nfts, but if a police report is not filed within seven days, then they are automatically lifting that freeze on that NFT. And basically this is a tactic to get around false reports so people could grief other people and say, like that NFT stolen.
01:16:56.686 - 01:17:15.042, Speaker B: And then Opensea would freeze it, and then the owner would be like, it wasn't stolen. That's my NFT. And so they're still freezing stolen nfts, but they need to show that the owner, previous owner, or current owner needs to file a police report. And if they don't do that, then that lift is automatically released, and so it's not frozen.
01:17:15.186 - 01:17:41.422, Speaker A: I want to get in the headspace, get out of our crypto bubble for a minute and get in the headspace of enforcement agencies like the local police. Okay, right here. So think about this. You're a board ape, yacht club owner. You have an ape and you lost it because you did something real stupid with your private keys. You just left them out there and somebody took it, and you have to file a local police report. So what's the police going to do? They're going to be like, what are you doing? Why did you do this?
01:17:41.476 - 01:17:45.258, Speaker B: Car going to show up your house? What are they going to do, write down notes?
01:17:45.354 - 01:18:13.962, Speaker A: If I was a cop on the beat, I would be incredibly annoyed just at the prospect of nfts even existing. Now I have to go hunt for stolen digital property online. What am I supposed to do with this? And the tie here is actually like the OfaC sanctions you notice came on the back of North Korea, hacking their own side chain, right? FBI has to get involved. All these smart contract hacks. The DeFi is basically saying to the FBI, hey, come help us sort this out. The FBI is probably, like, beyond annoyed. Like, no.
01:18:13.962 - 01:18:17.686, Speaker A: How about you guys write your code better so it doesn't get hacked?
01:18:17.718 - 01:18:19.322, Speaker B: Don't deal with this.
01:18:19.456 - 01:18:45.938, Speaker A: And so what do they do? Right? The government responds and is like, we're going to sanction OFAC. I just think that these are all somewhat related. And if we get out of our crypto bubble once in a while and we put our headspace in the minds of enforcers, they're probably pointing crypto and be like, hey, I understand what you're saying about that whole oFAC thing, but also, how about you get your stuff together and don't let North Korea hack millions of dollars worth of crypto?
01:18:46.034 - 01:19:03.990, Speaker B: Yeah, I think what we're really missing here is, like, virtual, like, our local law enforcement is not. They're here to settle, like, physical disputes. We need, like, virtual police to go after this digital police. But I don't even like that. I'd rather just us get our shit together. I think that's a better solution.
01:19:04.070 - 01:19:04.698, Speaker A: Same here.
01:19:04.784 - 01:19:31.218, Speaker B: Here's pseudoswap royalty fee. Pseudoswap is finding favor with NFT traders. Basically, this is a news report talking about the absolute fantastic volumes going through pseudoswap. So pseudoswap is just like an NFT liquidity primitive, and it is doing some great volumes. So $10 million, I believe, in the last accumulative trading volume. So congrats to pseudoswap liquidity coming for nfts, and we really need it because of what's about to happen next.
01:19:31.384 - 01:19:36.306, Speaker A: Well, what is about to happen next? Then with this liquidity comes great responsibility and power, doesn't it? Yeah.
01:19:36.328 - 01:20:12.042, Speaker B: So I've talked about this before. We've talked about the concept, the category of collateralized nfts, where you put up your NFT for collateral and borrow against it. We know DeFi loves to do collateralized stuff. It's like one of our biggest things. And so there's this application called Bendao which does this, allows for collateralization of nfts and allows you to borrow against it. And this Twitter account, Cirrus NFT, says there's currently 32,000 ether, about $60 million worth of nfts being used as collateral for a lows on Bendow for the first time ever. A lot of these are at serious peril of liquidation.
01:20:12.042 - 01:21:17.422, Speaker B: And he puts together a thread of the biggest risk to the NFT market that no one is talking about a little bit. A little bit hyperbolic, basically, board apes and mutant apes. These two NFT categories are on the precipice of a cascading set of liquidations because Ben Dow puts collateralized apes or collateralized NFDs up for auction at, like, probably a discount, 5% discount to the floor price, hoping that somebody comes and scoops these up. A lot of them are collateralized, and so a lot of these are going to be put on the market. And there's just, like, we saw that the 70% drawdown in crypto because of ave liquidations and central CFI liquidations, we can see on chain that there is cascading liquidations of board apes and mutant apes ready to go because of this NFT collateralization. I'm sorry, Ryan. How many times I talk about how this was going to happen on the weekly roll up over the last nine months? At least, like, four or five times I mentioned that as soon as we get NFT collateralization, we're going to have dgens going along on their nfts, and then they're going to get liquidated and lose their nfts.
01:21:17.486 - 01:21:25.510, Speaker A: That's all right. That's efficient markets, man. So people who are risky lose their money, and that's okay. It's a pawn shop, NFT. Everyone's going to be okay. I think.
01:21:25.580 - 01:21:46.782, Speaker B: Yeah. This is my truth. I say we're too degenerate as a community to not trigger cascading liquidations on our nfts. And since there's an update on this, the first liquidation of one is about to happen. There is one board, ape board, ape number five. Three, which. The floor price is about 72 ether, but it's being sold for 68.4
01:21:46.782 - 01:21:55.914, Speaker B: ether, which lowers the floor price. Ryan. And so the floor price keeps on dropping, which could potentially liquidate more nfts.
01:21:56.042 - 01:22:03.506, Speaker A: Hey, if you're looking for deals on it. If you're looking for deals on nfts, though, head over to the pawn shop. They're liquidating. Yeah, liquidating a great deal.
01:22:03.608 - 01:22:06.370, Speaker B: The fact that it is the apes, I think, is just like, of course.
01:22:06.440 - 01:22:09.510, Speaker A: Hey, there's some crypto punks in here, isn't there? There's got to be.
01:22:09.580 - 01:22:10.626, Speaker B: No, it's all apes.
01:22:10.738 - 01:22:33.200, Speaker A: Never mind. You know, Mailchimp as well. So bankless, of course, has a newsletter, and we use substack. Right now we're looking at transitioning something else. But did you know David Mailchimp has created a crackdown on crypto newsletters, including sorry, the Edge. Basically, if you have a crypto newsletter, they are not sending the emails out.
01:22:33.570 - 01:22:36.400, Speaker B: Your crypto newsletter got rugged. Sorry again.
01:22:37.330 - 01:23:08.142, Speaker A: I think they're back. I think they've resolved it somehow. I don't know, with mailchimp or with someone else. But the hazards of centralized companies, if you're decentralized, if you're a crypto media publication like us, David, this is kind of a wake up call to us to make sure that we have redundancy here. Also a wake up call for Taiwan in the face of attacks from China. They're actually looking to Ethereum's ipfs tech to help out. I don't know if this is a big way or what, or if this is sort of a small trial.
01:23:08.142 - 01:23:59.498, Speaker A: But David, I think what this speaks to is interesting, that nation states themselves will start to increasingly need to use decentralized technology like Ethereum, like ipfs, like of course, cryptography, which they already use today in order to defend themselves against other nation states. That is the reason at first, the US, Mark Andreessen told us on the podcast, the US did not want to adopt SSL, did not want to, did not want to allow crypto technology, cryptography technology in the browser, on the web, but they had to in order to protect all of their stuff from other nation state actors. So they just said yes to it. I think that is the destination for Ethereum, by the way, and why the Ofax sanctions will not hold up, because eventually they're going to need these decentralized asset money networks to protect against other nation states. And maybe we're seeing a whiff of that with Taiwan here.
01:23:59.584 - 01:24:50.650, Speaker B: Certainly. Like cryptocurrency, cryptography, blockchains, these are technologies that supersede nation States. They are a dimension higher than nation states. And so when you are a minority like nation state entity like Taiwan, it's advantageous for you to adopt these crypto protocols, these cryptography mechanisms, because the cryptography mechanisms, cryptography supersedes nation states. So if you are a subdominant nation state, you use cryptography, you use ipfs, you use blockchain stuff to get out under the thumb of a larger nation state. And so the ipfs, for those that don't know, is the interplanetary file system. It's a decentralized peer to peer network that lets users backup and store files and websites by hosting them across a network of nodes, eliminating central points of failure and circumventing censorship efforts.
01:24:50.650 - 01:25:09.690, Speaker B: The storage and file referencing system for Ethereum is frequently compared like ipfs is frequently compared to a file sharing protocol, kind of like bittorrent. And I don't think there's any coincidence that the news of this ipfs upgrade of Taiwan, I don't know what that means. I'm sure it's not just, like, universally, like, Taiwan.
01:25:09.770 - 01:25:11.902, Speaker A: No, I think it's probably in a very small way.
01:25:11.956 - 01:25:21.460, Speaker B: Yeah. And also the important stuff. But comes right after Nancy Pelosi shows up in Taiwan, and then China starts flexing its muscles. Like, that's no coincidence that this is happening.
01:25:21.830 - 01:25:31.510, Speaker A: Crypto is entering the geopolitical, nation state level conversations here. Decentralized tech is. David, do you remember all the way back from 2017, do you remember dragon chain?
01:25:32.730 - 01:25:34.018, Speaker B: Dragon chain bros.
01:25:34.114 - 01:25:36.390, Speaker A: This is like Disney's version of Ethereum.
01:25:39.150 - 01:25:53.858, Speaker B: They couldn't officially associate their brand with it, but for some reason, it got, like, wink, wink. Like a wink, wink associated with it. Yeah, like ex Disney people. And it was one of these things that pumped to the absolute moon in 2017.
01:25:54.054 - 01:26:02.314, Speaker A: Back in the days where we had Asia had an Ethereum killer called Neo Disney had an Ethereum killer called, like, dragon Chain. It was all of these Ethereum killers.
01:26:02.362 - 01:26:04.174, Speaker B: Dragon chain right now.
01:26:04.212 - 01:26:24.914, Speaker A: So the news is not that not dragon chain, it's kind of dead. But the SEC is filing suit against Dragon chain all the way back from 2017. So this is like, five years coming, and now it's happening. Now, we can comment on that in and of itself, but just if you go to the price of dragon chain, David, do you know all time highs for dragon chain above $5? $5.50?
01:26:24.962 - 01:26:30.694, Speaker B: Yeah, it started below a penny, and then it pumped to five and a half dollars. It made a lot of people very, very rich.
01:26:30.742 - 01:26:32.220, Speaker A: You know what it's trading at now?
01:26:33.150 - 01:26:34.730, Speaker B: I'm guessing it's down bad.
01:26:34.880 - 01:26:36.426, Speaker A: It's down real bad.
01:26:36.528 - 01:26:37.370, Speaker B: Real bad.
01:26:37.520 - 01:26:44.922, Speaker A: Two cent as a 99.9 something x drop.
01:26:44.986 - 01:26:47.214, Speaker B: That's a delay of wealth right there.
01:26:47.412 - 01:26:49.710, Speaker A: Yeah. So you weren't into dragon chain?
01:26:50.130 - 01:27:03.934, Speaker B: My friend was, but not me personally. I just like dragon chain. The name itself. I was like, back when names were important, I was like, ethereum. Dragon chain. Ethereum. Ethereum.
01:27:03.934 - 01:27:19.270, Speaker B: Name is way better. So I'm going to stick with. It's worth noting that the SEC statute of limitations is seven years. So if you issue an illegal security and the SEC doesn't come after you for seven years, you're good. Five years. They almost made it. They almost made it.
01:27:19.270 - 01:27:25.178, Speaker B: But you're not out of the woods for seven years, and dragon chain got caught at five years.
01:27:25.344 - 01:27:38.190, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess it takes a long time to go through the process of this. It's another lesson for crypto, where we think things happen fast. On other news. In other news, Ontario cracking down. What's this tweet from you, David, and tell us the news.
01:27:38.260 - 01:27:45.922, Speaker B: Yeah, there's new regulatory changes coming out of China for centralized. You're. If you're a cryptocurrency, that is.
01:27:45.976 - 01:27:56.902, Speaker A: David, you said China, but I think you meant Canada. Well, I mean, that's funny about freudian swift. Okay, so it's Canada. It's Ontario specifically, but Canada. Go ahead.
01:27:56.956 - 01:28:26.318, Speaker B: So all other crypto assets that are not bitcoin, ether, litecoin, or bitcoin cash, these are the four cryptocurrencies that you can buy without any limits. All other cryptocurrencies in Ontario, there's a $30,000 limit a year that an individual retail investor can buy crypto. So that includes Salana. And I would say as much as crap as I give Salana, it is way better than litecoin. It is so much better than bitcoin cash. There is no competition there. Litecoin, this is living in 2017.
01:28:26.318 - 01:28:48.718, Speaker B: And so only there are these enshrined cryptos that are like, okay, you can buy as much as this. Bitcoin and ETH are good litecoin, bitcoin cash, absolute trash. But then all the other cryptocurrencies are like, you're not allowed to touch them for more than $30,000 a year. This is very similar to accredited investor laws, where the wealthier you are, the higher your limits are. But like, dude, what the f. What.
01:28:48.744 - 01:29:09.098, Speaker A: The f. What are you doing? Ontario, what are you doing? It's not all provinces, of course. It's Ontario. And this is kind of Ontario's version of the SEC doing this. And some people actually, when I tweeted this out, too, they said these rules have been in effect for a while. They're just kind of now getting rolled out. So they were, in effect, starting last year, they're getting rolled out.
01:29:09.098 - 01:29:24.110, Speaker A: The other tweak on this is basically, they're enforcing this at the central exchange level. So there are ways to circumvent it, which is like, you could open up nine different exchange accounts, I guess, and get $30,000 of salana on each if you really want to.
01:29:24.260 - 01:29:33.378, Speaker B: You could also buy a ton of ether. You could buy and then send it to uniswap and then have no limits there. So it's not a ban on, like, you buy in uniswap, for example.
01:29:33.464 - 01:30:04.150, Speaker A: It is the principle of the thing, regulator knows best. These are the four crypto assets Ontario regulators have sanctioned you for. Bitcoin, ETh, litecoin, and bitcoin cash. These are the safe ones, guys, and we know as much as you want in this. I don't understand it, but for people to know. I actually grew up in Ontario, so I'm canadian and american, but I moved to the US when I was kind of in middle school. That was a freaking tough move, by the way, another story.
01:30:04.150 - 01:30:05.742, Speaker A: Moved to another country in middle school.
01:30:05.796 - 01:30:07.534, Speaker B: I'll ask about it in your layer zero.
01:30:07.652 - 01:30:30.840, Speaker A: But now I just feel like I have to look for where I live with how friendly is it, how free do I want to be? And this is like, if I ever wanted to move back to Ontario, I might be second guessing it if stuff like this is coming down the pipe. So anyway, Canadians got to resist, too. We're working on it on the OFAC side, but there's lots of regulatory fights to fight.
01:30:31.770 - 01:31:17.054, Speaker B: Coming in next, we have the House passes the massive climate tax and Health bill titled the Inflation Reduction act and is now being sent on its way to Biden to receive his signature, which he's totally expected to sign. $437,000,000,000 Inflation Reduction Act. 15% minimum tax on large corporations, 1% excise tax on share buybacks, tax credit for electric vehicles. There's 369,000,000,000 spending on climate and energy policies. And it also allocates 64 billion to extend Affordable Care act program to reduce insurance costs. Interesting that there's all this extra stuff, which is like stuff that we hear about all the time, like Affordable Care Act, Green energy investment. But it's inside of this inflation Reduction act.
01:31:17.054 - 01:31:37.194, Speaker B: The name itself is kind of like the Patriot act, like Inflation Reduction act. You can't hate it. And also there's something completely oxymoronic about spending over hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending to reduce inflation. That's what creates inflation. Like you're spending more money, to be fair.
01:31:37.232 - 01:31:58.378, Speaker A: So a couple things. So one is this was actually, I think the article we're looking at is from Friday. Biden did already sign it. So yeah, there are obviously some tax pieces to this too. Right? So they are raising some income, not just spending. They're doing a little both. But call me skeptical if this is actually going to do anything to reduce inflation.
01:31:58.378 - 01:32:14.966, Speaker A: It's just not. The drop in the bucket has impact on inflation. This is just a micro drop in the bucket, obviously before November elections, which makes sense. Nice bill to call it the Inflation Reduction act. Not going to happen. Not going to do much for it, though. David, what's this? We're on the releases side of things.
01:32:14.966 - 01:32:17.682, Speaker A: Galleon portfolios. What are Galleon portfolios?
01:32:17.746 - 01:32:52.046, Speaker B: Yeah, people, new listeners, people that came in last few years probably aren't familiar with this thing called token sets or set protocol. It was a big, all of the rage back in the bear market, 2018, 2019. But basically, people could create their sets of tokens, and, like, I created my set, other people created their set. Galleon is working, building on top of set protocol to make just like, more. It's a little bit like index co op. So Galleon portfolios, there's four of them. You have, like, the merge portfolio, the fees portfolio SPI, and it's just a collection of tokens in different ecosystems.
01:32:52.046 - 01:33:17.626, Speaker B: So the merge index, 50% wrap staked ether, 20% liquidity providers like lidio, rocket pool, 30% DFI primitives, uni, ave SNX. You have the spartan index ecosystem SPI, which is SNX, Lyra, Thales. The ve token index for holders of vote is all the ve tokens out there. So curve, CFX, FXS, bow, Butterfly. So it's just a new index machine out on the world. Galleon portfolios. So cool.
01:33:17.626 - 01:33:18.502, Speaker B: Nice release.
01:33:18.646 - 01:33:39.998, Speaker A: There you go. On the raises side of things, we've got a 16 z. They just gave $350,000,000 to flow. This is Adam Newman's company, a 16 z. This is one of the biggest checks they've ever written. Values flow at $1 billion. Adam Newman, of course, is the entrepreneur, in quotes, behind visionary.
01:33:39.998 - 01:33:53.974, Speaker A: Yeah, visionary, right? There have been many documentaries about him, some kind of scandalous, but a 16 z is a believer. It's funny that, like, three or four months ago, David Flow was actually a cryptocarbon company.
01:33:54.092 - 01:33:56.242, Speaker B: No, that was flow carbon.
01:33:56.386 - 01:34:22.010, Speaker A: That was flow carbon. But it's the same kind of thing. It was Adam Newman. Flow Carbon was the name. They shortened it to flow, and now it's a completely different thing. So I'm not sure it'd be an interesting story to hear what Adam and the team decided about the cryptocarbon market, deciding it wasn't ready and then pivoting completely to real estate. But the other side of this is, this is an absolutely colossal raise with a massive evaluation.
01:34:22.010 - 01:34:25.322, Speaker A: And Jason Calcanus has a take on this. What's his take, David?
01:34:25.386 - 01:34:45.494, Speaker B: Yeah, Jason Calcanis from the all in podcast, and he states, if a startup is worth $1 billion before it launches a product it's probably a scam. I tried to do some research on what this product actually is. I actually can figure it out. And that was actually a comment in one of the articles I read, is that we still haven't been able to figure out what this product actually is.
01:34:45.692 - 01:35:02.350, Speaker A: So that's the juxtaposition, because we also know that Mark Andreessen is, like one of the best investors of his generation, and he's pretty savy and pretty smart, and this is him giving justification for why they're doing 350,000,000 in this thing. Interesting juxtaposition, I think. Not super crypto related, other than this.
01:35:02.420 - 01:35:24.914, Speaker B: Well, that's what people are trying to look into. The quote from one article that came from some investigative journalist said that Adam is building a next generation, multifamily property management system with a proprietary payment system, adding that the system will include full financial services wallet, a tokenized reward program, and crypto payment method. What?
01:35:25.112 - 01:35:25.666, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:35:25.768 - 01:35:26.420, Speaker B: What?
01:35:26.870 - 01:35:33.634, Speaker A: Yeah. I don't know what that's about, David. I don't know what that's about. All right. Dragonfly. They are a crypto hedge fund. They bought another hedge fund called metastable.
01:35:33.634 - 01:35:48.794, Speaker A: Metastable was like a 2017 2018. In fact, they were earlier than that to crypto. They bought them for $400 million, all their assets under management. Kind of some consolidation in the crypto hedge fund world. David, let's talk about jobs, though.
01:35:48.832 - 01:35:49.546, Speaker B: Let's do it.
01:35:49.648 - 01:35:57.406, Speaker A: We talked about raises, so we got to talk about jobs. A lot of hot crypto jobs going on. What do we remind folks every week, David, that you should get a job.
01:35:57.428 - 01:36:07.554, Speaker B: In crypto because the private markets have a ton of money, and these private markets are going into the jobs that you see here on the jobs boards. There is a ton of jobs in crypto. Ryan, read them off.
01:36:07.672 - 01:36:13.294, Speaker A: I gotcha. DYDX is hiring a software engineer on the back end. Steakfish wants an HR business partner.
01:36:13.342 - 01:36:13.934, Speaker B: It's non technical.
01:36:13.982 - 01:36:27.234, Speaker A: Steakfish also wants a back end full stack engineer and a front end software engineer and a DevOps engineer. Bankless. We need somebody for media operations. It's non technical videos, that sort of thing. Software engineer for boardroom Labs, a manager of crypto marketing.
01:36:27.282 - 01:36:27.714, Speaker B: Non technical.
01:36:27.762 - 01:36:33.154, Speaker A: Manticore games. We need a thread. Or at bankless, a Vertex protocol needs a marketing coordinator.
01:36:33.202 - 01:36:33.806, Speaker B: Non technical.
01:36:33.858 - 01:36:46.878, Speaker A: A financial analyst from streams, product manager for bankless accounts. I could go on, but I don't need to because you can get all of these jobs at the bankless jobs board. Bankless palette.com, slash jobs. Go check it out. David, what's coming next man?
01:36:47.044 - 01:37:24.282, Speaker B: Questions from the nation. Every single week we ask the nation what you want us to answer. So we got those questions coming up next. Does staking before the merge matter? And also what comes next after the merge? And also some hot takes from crypto trader. So see, fantastic questions and the hottest takes are coming up right after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible. Zksync is an ethereum L2 network that is pushing the frontier of high performance blockchains that don't compromise on security or decentralization. Zksync has combined the power of zero knowledge rollups and the Ethereum virtual machine, enabling developers to build the greatest web3 projects possible, ones we haven't even seen yet.
01:37:24.282 - 01:38:04.114, Speaker B: Crypto needs its killer applications to onboard the world, but crypto killer apps need Zksync as a platform to build on first. It's generally accepted that zero knowledge rollups are the conclusion of crypto blockchain scaling technology. And Zksync is leading the charge into the final frontier of crypto economics. So if you're a developer who wants to build your app on a future proof foundation which gives your users the best UX possible, check out Zksync's website at zksync IO. And yes, there's also going to be a token, so give them a follow on Twitter too. At Zksync, the brave browser is the user first browser for the Web three Internet with over 60 million monthly active users. And inside the brave browser you'll find the brave wallet, the secure, multitrain crypto wallet built right into the browser.
01:38:04.114 - 01:38:29.626, Speaker B: Web three is freedom from big tech and Wall street, more control and better privacy. But there's a weak point in web3. Your crypto wallet and most crypto wallets are browser extensions which can easily be spoofed. But the brave wallet is different. No extensions are required, which gives brave browser an extra level of security versus other wallets. Brave Wallet is your secure passport for the possibilities of web3 and supports multiple chains including Ethereum and Salana. You can even buy crypto directly inside the wallet with ramp.
01:38:29.626 - 01:38:45.682, Speaker B: And of course you can store, send and swap your crypto assets, manage your nfts, and connect to other wallets and DFi apps. So whether you're new to crypto or you're a seasoned pro, it's time to ditch those risky extensions. And it's time to switch to the brave wallet. Download Brave@brave.com slash bankless and click the wallet icon to get started.
01:38:45.736 - 01:39:14.926, Speaker A: Alright guys, we are back. Reminder, get into the questions. If you have a question for the weekly roll up, you can reply to the tweet thread bankless HQ on Twitter tweets out every week and get your question answered. This is the first question from skiing lens on Twitter. Is there a reason that e should be staked prior to the merge versus post merge? Does staking post merge carry any negative connotations such as missing out on rewards versus possessing already staked eth going into the merge? Should I stake now or should I wait until after the merge? David, what do you think?
01:39:15.028 - 01:39:49.386, Speaker B: I think that it does not matter. There's nothing really special about staking through the merge. You get to say that you did it and that's the biggest thing is you get to say that you are there. The financial ROI, you're going to get 5% more eth between now and the merge because you're just staking for such a little amount of time. I would say if you are not already staking your ether, the risks might actually be higher because there might be some weird shenanigans with the merge. So I say we would say if you're not already staking your ether, I would just say hold on to it and then stake post merge and do that.
01:39:49.488 - 01:40:05.990, Speaker A: This is my take too, and this is personally what I'm doing. Right. It's like why stake now? Why not wait till after a year ago when issuing, yeah, when stake rewards were much higher, it was like something like 7%, something like that. Maybe there's some reason for it. It was never seven, it was like six.
01:40:06.080 - 01:40:08.174, Speaker B: Oh, it did start off very, started.
01:40:08.212 - 01:40:26.466, Speaker A: Off high when it was very low. Anyway, I could see that, but that's gone down. And for me there's maybe some execution risk in there. But also I wonder about forking. So if there is a POW eth version, do you think they might exclude anyone who's staked from that?
01:40:26.648 - 01:40:30.870, Speaker B: By definition, you will not get the proof of work stake again.
01:40:30.940 - 01:40:50.790, Speaker A: I know you're not very bullish that there's going to be a high value POW chain, but that's another reason you get more of that forked token if you don't stake pre merge. So I'm going to wait. I think that's the right call. What's our next question from Pete Eth? He says, or they say what will be the next thing to look forward to post merge? What do you think, David?
01:40:50.870 - 01:41:20.390, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the meta of conversation will shift into 4844 and this is going to be the thing that cuts L2 transaction fees by like one 100th. I think that'll be kind of the next thing that the general Ethereum community focuses on. And there's always something to focus on. But I will say it's also like the merge EIP 1559, like staking will be in the Revere Muir. We do have to, like, at some point, the Ethereum chain just runs, guys, at some point, there is no next thing.
01:41:20.460 - 01:41:21.606, Speaker A: Appreciate that for a little bit.
01:41:21.628 - 01:41:22.166, Speaker B: Yeah, we do.
01:41:22.188 - 01:41:23.650, Speaker A: Just ask in the glow.
01:41:23.730 - 01:41:26.790, Speaker B: Yeah, but it will be 4844 that we talk a lot about.
01:41:26.860 - 01:41:40.026, Speaker A: So 4844 probably next year, probably sometime in 2023, hopefully. And this gives scalability to roll ups, makes roll ups essentially free. Yeah, basically I'm using hyperbole, but like close to free. Good.
01:41:40.048 - 01:41:46.814, Speaker B: It's good hyperbole. I think I would also say proposer builder separation, but that is in the very distant. That's like 2024 stuff.
01:41:46.852 - 01:41:57.198, Speaker A: Yeah. And by the way, rolled up into the next fork, which could happen in 2023, is also withdrawals. So if you stake locked in, stakers.
01:41:57.214 - 01:41:59.540, Speaker B: Are like, you guys, I'm totally looking forward to.
01:42:01.830 - 01:42:12.838, Speaker A: I mean, I'd like to get my back. Yeah, yeah, exactly. And that's coming. That's right now it's bundled in the same fork. They're going to co release those things. But that may not be the case. They could release them in separate forks, too.
01:42:12.838 - 01:42:20.754, Speaker A: All right, David takes of the week. This one from Peter van Vulkenberg. He is a crypto lawyer at coincenter.
01:42:20.802 - 01:42:57.026, Speaker B: He's the one that wrote the coin center report. And he says, I don't know who needs to hear this, but if the big regulatory battles are being fought about a different cryptocurrency, it's not because your preferred crypto is more decentralized. It's because governments aren't worried about the things it does and how it does them. And then, of course, with some nice context, Ryan, Sean Adams says, I think I know who needs to hear this. Basically, this is subtweeting all the bitcoiners who are ha. Ethereum is being targeted by regulatory nation state regulations. And then Peter is saying, yeah, it's because bitcoin, the government's not worried about bitcoin.
01:42:57.026 - 01:42:58.520, Speaker B: It's not a threat to them.
01:42:58.970 - 01:43:19.894, Speaker A: Let bankless let you and I, David, make a public commitment. I just want people to hear this right, is bankless is about freedom. It's about decentralization. It's about censorship, resistance. Doesn't matter what chain. All right. If Cardano needs to fight the fight around this, because they're being unfairly targeted.
01:43:19.894 - 01:43:52.678, Speaker A: If Tron needs to fight the fight around this, if Solana needs to fight the fight around this, or bitcoin needs to fight the fight around this, we show up. We show up, and I hope anyone in crypto shows up for these fights, because we're all in this together. I think the tribalism doesn't want us to believe that we're all in this together, but at the end of the day, we are. This is the crypto nation. We are all fighting for the same things, at least if we are preserving those basic essential rights. So I just want to say that publicly, in case that's not clear, and.
01:43:52.684 - 01:44:13.606, Speaker B: I'll say that again if you aren't on crypto Twitter, in these trench warfares with tribes, intertribal warfare, I understand how weird it is that me and Ryan are like, oh, these bitcoiners, bitcoiners, they are so annoying. In my mentions of talking about how Ethereum is like decentralized scam coin that's controlled by Vitalik's basement, it's just so exhausting.
01:44:13.638 - 01:44:19.502, Speaker A: It could be that Twitter algo tricking you, though, that David, and we're going to screw. Let's put all these things in.
01:44:19.556 - 01:44:23.120, Speaker B: No, the bitcoiners are like, they target my tweets and they descend on them.
01:44:24.130 - 01:44:28.594, Speaker A: I know there's some of that. This is another take. Do you want to read it? Yeah.
01:44:28.632 - 01:44:37.810, Speaker B: Ryan, Sean Adams says people going to think twice about staking their ETH in a centralized exchange now. Thanks, OFAC, for promoting decentralization. What do you mean? What do you mean?
01:44:37.880 - 01:45:06.698, Speaker A: The meta take here is that this is getting us all thinking about decentralization and where the centralization vectors are. And I think it's super good for the space long term. So we're thinking about our front ends, right? Maybe more of these should be on ipfs. We're thinking about validating staking. And what happens if major validators go rogue and promote something that's centralized? What does the Ethereum community do to react? We're game strategizing all of these potential outcomes. Super healthy. I'm pretty excited.
01:45:06.698 - 01:45:39.580, Speaker A: So this is the beauty of crypto, I think, is anytime you get kind of like censorship or massive crackdown, it's just like kind of the water balloon, it just kind of squeezes through the authoritarian fingers and manifests somewhere else. And so, yeah, I think this is what progress looks like, is the bottom line. What I would say, it's actually a good thing, is that weird to say? I mean, people are like rose colored glasses. How are you saying that this ofac sanctioned thing is a good thing, but in a way it is, right?
01:45:40.590 - 01:46:11.886, Speaker B: Ethereum, crypto, these are organic systems, these are antifragile systems, and the community is the antibodies. And when the community gets faced with a stressor, we respond and we make it things. When something comes to attack Ethereum, we fix it and make it more decentralized. So if there was a weakness, we solve it. And it only happens when there is stress. Like animals, organisms, they respond to stress. Ethereum is being stressed by this Ofac sanctions thing, and we are responding to it by making us stronger.
01:46:11.998 - 01:46:16.462, Speaker A: Yep. We're just around ratting around. David, what are you bullish on this week?
01:46:16.536 - 01:46:30.246, Speaker B: Ryan, this one's going to be atypical for me. I am bullish on mountains. I'm turning off Twitter. I'm deleting Twitter nature. Yeah, I'm going into the mountains. I'm not disconnecting from cell service. You can't get cell service out there.
01:46:30.246 - 01:46:35.446, Speaker B: Going to hang out with four of my homies and only think about trees.
01:46:35.558 - 01:46:39.690, Speaker A: You're going to release all of the digital toxins from your body is what's going to happen.
01:46:39.760 - 01:46:44.794, Speaker B: Yes. This is my first non crypto trip since, like, 2019.
01:46:44.922 - 01:46:50.254, Speaker A: Oh, dude, you did a long time coming then. Yeah, enjoy it. Enjoy the grass. I will enjoy being outside.
01:46:50.372 - 01:46:52.318, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm missing grass for hours.
01:46:52.484 - 01:46:57.230, Speaker A: Yeah. I'll keep everyone at bay on Twitter for you. All right. Yeah, all the maximalists.
01:46:57.310 - 01:46:57.714, Speaker B: Thank you.
01:46:57.752 - 01:46:59.170, Speaker A: That'll be on me this weekend.
01:46:59.510 - 01:47:03.362, Speaker B: I'm bullish on zero cell reception. Ryan, what are you bullish on?
01:47:03.496 - 01:48:01.154, Speaker A: I am bullish on layer Zero, my friend. So what is layer Zero? That is the people underlying all of the guarantees, all of the security that we have in crypto. You have a podcast called Layer Zero, all about the people in crypto, because ultimately, this is our only defense, our best defense against everything that comes at this industry. And people don't realize this. Whether it's bitcoin, whether it's Ethereum, whether it's Solana is the thing that enforces all of the immutability and censorship resistance and anything else that makes a blockchain, a blockchain goes back to the layer zero, right? And that's what we've been talking about. Right? So it's like if enough people believe in censorship resistance for Ethereum as a core value and a core property that the project needs to have, they will run the software that makes that possibility a reality so it all comes out back to the people. If the people stop believing this, then we lose and we don't get the censorship resistance.
01:48:01.154 - 01:48:41.598, Speaker A: This is why I think movements like bankless are so important is because we are working on that layer zero. And the tech can be great. But if you don't have the layer zero to support it, to run the software, to say no in the face of censorship, and to say yes for immutability, you don't really have a blockchain. And I was bullish this week, I guess. Back to bullish on what I saw in Ethereum and the X movement of like, I vote to fork out any censorship resistance and run a different chain, sell my assets on the censored chain, burn the stake if I need to, and preserve censorship resistance. I'm very bullish on that, David.
01:48:41.694 - 01:49:08.154, Speaker B: Yeah, and it's the community that supports the blockchain that makes the blockchain. Right. And like I said earlier, so many new people came into this cryptocurrency industry in the last like 18 months, and they probably haven't been exposed to these very tough questions because some people didn't even think about, people are learning about what this means right now, and we need to have these conversations every two years because new people come in and they haven't had one of these conversations yet.
01:49:08.192 - 01:49:08.630, Speaker A: Totally.
01:49:08.710 - 01:49:16.830, Speaker B: And so we just have to keep on rehashing and reinstating what our values are on a regular basis because otherwise we'll lose them.
01:49:16.900 - 01:49:39.218, Speaker A: It's like 2022 has been the year of learning lessons, right? We learned the hazards of centralization and centralized lending providers. With Celsius and blockfly and others, we learned the hazards of massive speculation on margin through a 16, sorry, through three arrows, capital and others like them. Now we're learning the value of censorship resistance. This has been a fantastic year for teaching us lessons.
01:49:39.314 - 01:49:41.558, Speaker B: Bear Market this is why bear markets are so awesome.
01:49:41.644 - 01:49:48.860, Speaker A: I love them. I love bear markets. Meme of the week David, this is hilarious. What are we looking at, man?
01:49:49.230 - 01:50:10.362, Speaker B: We are looking at Vitalik's new album, which dropped September 15, called the Merge. And so this is not actually his album, but for the podcast listeners, this is a very dark looking rap album with Vitalik and this shadowy look just staring right into your parental advisory.
01:50:10.426 - 01:50:11.680, Speaker A: Explicit content.
01:50:12.530 - 01:50:15.146, Speaker B: The merge, it dropped September 15.
01:50:15.258 - 01:50:29.102, Speaker A: That's awesome. That's it from us. We got a moment of Zen for you. But before we do, we got to tell you, none of this has been financial advice. It never is. On bankless, you could definitely lose what you put in, but we are headed west. This is the frontier.
