00:00:00.250 - 00:00:48.260, Speaker A: How close are you to being a decentralization maximalist? Does that describe? I would not call myself in anything maximalist, but I definitely think that decentralization is extremely important. Ultimately, decentralization is what this space is about. Like once you start compromising on that, then there does come a point where you just have to ask, well, like what is even difference between what's being built here and centralized systems, the more that we can actually get to like genuine decentralization and an ecosystem where in order to make changes to the protocol, you actually needs to have buy in, not just from a couple of protocol elites, but from the entire user community. I think that's a really important and beautiful thing. It's also an important and beautiful thing for each of the asset to maintain its credibility. It's an important thing for a lot of the applications on Ethereum to maintain their credibility, and it's something that we need to fight for and support.
