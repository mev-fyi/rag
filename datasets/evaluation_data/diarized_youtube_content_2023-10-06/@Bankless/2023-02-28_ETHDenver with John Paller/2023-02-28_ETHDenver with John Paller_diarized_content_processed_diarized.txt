00:00:05.930 - 00:00:07.274, Speaker A: What up? Coordination on the pod.
00:00:07.322 - 00:00:23.950, Speaker B: Today we have John Powell, who was just on the podcast a few weeks ago, representing Opolis regen Web Three employment. This week we're talking about East Denver. So Colorado as a hub for Regenerative Crypto Economics biddle week, which is a hackathon that happens in Colorado.
00:00:25.050 - 00:00:26.342, Speaker A: Shelling Point, near day.
00:00:26.396 - 00:00:49.962, Speaker B: All of the side events to Ethereum. John's sort of philosophy on regen event building and then Spork Dial, which is kind of a co op that produces ETH Denver that you get membership in by joining ETH Denver. So I think it's kind of a fun episode for thinking about local activations that are regen and it's also the second live episode that we've done together. So a little bit of an experiment and I hope that you enjoy working.
00:00:50.016 - 00:01:28.274, Speaker C: In Web Three is awesome, but working outside of the typical W Two employee structure is a deal breaker for so many. Opolis is helping the self sovereign worker focus on what they do best. Their work. Tax time is coming up. Opolis helps professionalize your business by helping you form an entity, generate proof of employment through pay stubs, and receive a W Two at the end of the tax year. Are you self employed and forced to spend money on expensive healthcare insurance with limited coverage? Opolis leverages group buying power through a community employment coop, helping you save 20% to 50% on high quality, affordable healthcare options through Cigna. And finally, Opelis's member owners share in Opelis's success and profits based on their work token holdings.
00:01:28.274 - 00:02:12.054, Speaker C: You must be authorized to work inside the United States in select Canadian provinces to receive Opelis's benefits. Book a 30 minutes free consultation with Opelis's experts and join Opelus by March 31, 2023 to get 1000 work and 1000 bank tokens, go to connect Opolis Co Bankless to get started. And if you're going to East Denver, make sure to stop by the Opolis booth or attend their Future of Work Summit hosted by Opolis. The Glow dollar is a new coin with a very special property. As the market cap of Glow goes up, extreme poverty goes down. Glow is a dollar backed nonprofit stablecoin that creates basic income for people living in extreme poverty. Glow is basically the same business model as USDC, with yield generating Treasuries on one side and a stablecoin on Ethereum on the other.
00:02:12.054 - 00:02:42.270, Speaker C: But instead of being a for profit company, glow is a nonprofit that donates 100% of all yields from the Glow Reserve to Give Directly's basic Income Program. Give Directly is a charity that gives people money, no strings attached, to people living in poverty, and is a charity that Vitalik has previously donated to and supported in the past. With Glow, you can reduce poverty just by holding a stablecoin. Glow is launching in early 2023 and you can join the waitlist@glowdollar.org greenpill. That's glodollar.org greenpill.
00:02:43.730 - 00:02:44.558, Speaker A: What's up, John?
00:02:44.644 - 00:02:46.154, Speaker D: Hey, what's up, Kevin?
00:02:46.282 - 00:02:56.322, Speaker A: Not much. Excited to be here at ETH denver. 2023. Looks like you all have gotten bigger this year. And it's really cold in Colorado, so I feel for everyone.
00:02:56.376 - 00:03:00.006, Speaker D: Just today it's only going to be cold today. You know, tomorrow it's going to be 55.
00:03:00.108 - 00:03:02.790, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. So the weather will improve.
00:03:03.610 - 00:03:12.010, Speaker D: I paid to have it improve. I said it's okay if we have it sort of cold Friday. Yeah, but we're going to improve it tomorrow for sure.
00:03:12.080 - 00:03:23.146, Speaker A: Well, we are. Shilling, Colorado, for sure. You've done a really great job of making Colorado a home of regen Web Three and just importing people into Web Three. So I got to say, Kudos, denver has grown a lot over the last couple of years.
00:03:23.168 - 00:03:49.526, Speaker D: I couldn't have done it without you, man. In fact, I can't even take credit for the show. Colorado meme. That was you back in 2017. I remember me and you at it was either a Boulder meetup or a Denver meetup. We were talking about the idea that Colorado actually has a social and cultural vibe that fits the Web Three Ethos. And we're like, well, we should just make Colorado the epicenter for this.
00:03:49.526 - 00:03:57.142, Speaker D: And then you came up with the Shill, Colorado thing, and I just put it into the lexicon, and here we are, man.
00:03:57.196 - 00:03:57.510, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:03:57.580 - 00:04:00.626, Speaker D: 2023. Now that is what, six years ago?
00:04:00.748 - 00:04:07.418, Speaker A: Yeah, it's grown a lot over the last six years. So how big is ETH Denver going to be this year?
00:04:07.584 - 00:04:32.206, Speaker D: Well, so we're at the biddleweek kickoff. We're expecting a few thousand people today. Over the next ten days. I would expect we're going to see probably somewhere around 30,000 people. It'll be definitely north of 20. It's always hard to predict with free events, especially if they get freaked out by some cold weather, who's going to actually get on a plane or not. But we've already seen thousands of people in town.
00:04:32.206 - 00:04:43.000, Speaker D: And yeah, we're gearing up for the world's largest ever produced Web Three regen event. So it's going to be something.
00:04:43.450 - 00:04:50.862, Speaker A: I think I saw you tweet sometime over the last 24 hours that Ethnber is going to add something like $100 million to the Colorado economy.
00:04:50.946 - 00:05:11.774, Speaker D: Yeah, it's funny. There was a comment on there asking, well, it's like $4,000 a person. And it's like, well, have you looked at what airfare is? Have you looked at what hotel rooms cost? Like, have you looked at all this? Not to mention what sponsors are putting into site events and parties and all these things. I mean, every venue in this entire neighborhood is rented out multiple times.
00:05:11.812 - 00:05:13.714, Speaker A: It's really hard to get a hotel room. I got to say.
00:05:13.752 - 00:05:47.274, Speaker D: It's impossible to get a hotel room. I can't even get hotel rooms. And we've rented out everything. I mean, everything is booked. We put together a pretty simple model based on how you typically estimate these things. And if we have 25 to 30,000 people in town, it's a pretty reasonable estimate to say that somewhere around 110,000,000 in overall economic impact. And then there's sort of spillover from that.
00:05:47.274 - 00:05:56.830, Speaker D: I mean, when you have direct spend and then there's indirect spend, there's a bunch of different ways to look at it, but it's a huge number. Huge number.
00:05:56.900 - 00:06:27.490, Speaker A: Well, what I'm interested in is the symbiosis between the local government and the local economy and the Web Three community. And I think Governor Polis, who I know that you know, and have done some work with, has really been embracing the Web Three community. And it feels like it's a model for other jurisdictions to become friendly to innovation and to Web Three not only see their local economy boosted by events, but by innovators moving there permanently to innovate and spending in their local economy.
00:06:27.650 - 00:07:25.610, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, at the end of the day, the Governor's job is to create economic stimulus and vibrancy for its community. That's what they're supposed to do. There's an office called OEDIT, which is the Office of Economic Development and International Trade, which is actually part of the governor's office. And their entire mandate is looking for ways to stimulate innovation, spending, investment, growth, both here and even creating partnerships abroad. So the Web Three global nature, ethereal nature, fits well with their goals. And the fact that we've been able to also create a physical presence here, more so than just a conceptual one, is something that it aligns perfectly with what they're supposed to be doing. So it's not something we have to convince them, oh, this is good for Colorado.
00:07:25.610 - 00:08:03.526, Speaker D: It hits all the bullet points. It's innovative. It's innovative not in just a broad sense, but in a sense that's really good for communities. Like it's good for the average citizen. The average citizen doesn't have a clue about most of this stuff yet. But as we continue to experiment, as we continue to practice our trade and figure out what the recipes are, more and more, you're going to see more and more people participating. And it's a network effect kind of thing.
00:08:03.526 - 00:08:37.810, Speaker D: We're just in the early stages and Governor Polis has been visionary and instrumental in allowing this and sort of supporting it from an executive level because from his view, this is the kind of legacy stuff. When you talk about creating a new paradigm of call it a new paradigm of politics. It's sort of progressivism in a technology sense meets sort of self sovereignty and egalitarian systems. I mean, it's a really interesting kind of new thing.
00:08:37.880 - 00:08:59.974, Speaker A: Well, that's what's interesting to me about Colorado is that it's libertarian in the sense of not really favoring a lot of big government, but it's also very progressive in the sense of I mean, Boulder is just one of the most progressive places in the country. And so that intersection, I think, is where I find a lot of people in the Web Three kind of vibe with those two political axes.
00:09:00.102 - 00:10:15.154, Speaker D: And it's a really interesting mix because in the typical libertarian sense. So I refer to myself as an egalitarian libertarian, which means I believe in equal footing systems that give people open and fair opportunity and then the outcomes are really up to the player, right? Let's build better games that allow people to participate, let's remove barriers to entry, let's give people big time upside and then let's get out of their way instead of the nanny state sort of we're going to fix your life stuff for you on the one end or the don't tread on me stuff on the other end. I think it's a third paradigm. If you thought about those as the binary option left and right, let's think about this as up. It's pulling the rope from the center in that tug of war, right? So it's kind of picking from the best of both worlds into a new thing. And I wholeheartedly agree with mean the social sort of pieces of the libertarianism and the progressivism are an interesting mix and you don't see it around the country much. I mean, it's definitely not New York thing and it's definitely not a San Francisco thing.
00:10:15.154 - 00:10:18.034, Speaker D: Banking and VC culture are very different.
00:10:18.232 - 00:10:46.218, Speaker A: Yeah, well, this is an opportunity. I see within web3 people who recognize the need for public goods and regeneration but they don't trust the government as an institution to do it. And so what if we could build smart contracts or networks that are able to do that. And I guess it's with that as a platform that I want to ask you about the regen meme and your embracement of the regen meme. You said Colorado is a hub for regen economics. In what way has the regen meme proliferated Denver and, and your thinking about this space?
00:10:46.304 - 00:11:52.474, Speaker D: Well, I mean ETH Denver is now the world's largest regenerative economics live action experiment. I mean we've literally taken the event itself and put it into a regen game. I mean the Spork Token, Spork Dow, all of the incentives, the game design, the economic distribution, the cooperative legal framework, everything is experimenting with a new way of creating engagement value for the average person that might be interested in coming to this. The traditional quote conference vibe paradigm is a cost center. You come, you spend a bunch of money marketing dollars on the PNL and then you go home. Well, wouldn't it be cool if we could create a regenerative game out of that so that we could actually accrue value from the efforts that we put in and then distribute those back after we've all put in our expenses. I mean it's the beautiful circular life of regen games.
00:11:52.474 - 00:11:54.830, Speaker D: I mean that's exactly what we're doing.
00:11:54.980 - 00:12:50.820, Speaker A: So let me just say that back to you in the way that we've defined regen. I actually got regen defined or refi defined on coin market cap and what we said was it's a system that goes up in capacity over time and we're not just talking about financial capacity, but like intellectual capital and social capital and material capital and all those things. And so when I hear you describe that vision, basically what we're talking about is the export of biddling of software which is intellectual capital to the world. And then also the LCA framework in Colorado through which Sporkdao is incorporated is a public good to the space of legal innovation. And then it feels like the fact that all the sponsors and the participants actually get to participate in the Spork Dao creates sort of like this virtuous cycle that perpetuates it through year over year. So that's how I would define it in terms of how we've defined, regen and refi in the past and I'm wondering how that resonates with you.
00:12:53.270 - 00:13:38.594, Speaker D: To me you could call it a bunch of different things. Positive sum games is the synonym for it because there's incentive instead of this sort of scarcity landscape where somebody's going to take my idea. I don't want to collaborate because right and the underpinnings of all that is fear. Capitalism 1.0 is underpinned on fear and it's ironically done a lot of good for the world in terms of getting people out of poverty and sort of beginning the curve. But we need to evolve to something more sustainable. So we have to evolve to a place of abundance, mindset community is the new IP in web3.
00:13:38.594 - 00:14:58.454, Speaker D: So we don't have to worry about as much about the stealing of ideas because it's really the execution of ideas and the community is not going to support people who steal things and do things nefariously. I mean, there's some social overtones that sort of police indirectly a new paradigm of how to do business and those that collaborate are rewarded and those that contribute value in a multi layer way are rewarded. So when you look at ETH Denver and the amount of biddling and creativity that's been expressed in the space, I mean, we've had thousands of projects come out of the event over six. This will be our 6th year and it's really quite beautiful because people can do it in a way where they can just do it without economic barriers, without fears, without concerns because the community is here to support them and not just extract from them. So there's a whole bunch of things that you have to do to set the table to make this work. But in the end it's a fantastic way to experiment, frankly, as we refine these next generation games because I don't think anybody's really built the template yet. If you look at the capitalism model, you've got a Delaware C Corp and we've got the recipe.
00:14:58.454 - 00:15:37.970, Speaker D: Like you raise capital, you sell 20% of your company, you build it to a strategic exit or an IPO, right? Rinse, repeat, rinse, repeat. This is how we build value. We're going to do that same thing in the network state. We're going to do the same thing in the regen state. And we're going to have a way to build exponential value, distribute that value to communities, which is, again, the new IP, and they'll have incentive to do it because the contribution of their time, attention and creativity will be held in these networks and then represented by these community tokens that create that vibrancy and return of value to them at some point in the maturity curve.
00:15:38.050 - 00:16:01.678, Speaker A: The vision that comes to mind for me is the Nathan Schneider exit to Community meme, where instead of selling to Wall Street, you're selling to the community that's actually attended. I want to talk about Bill Week and I want to talk about the actual object level stuff that we're doing on the ground. Could you maybe touch on Spork Dao real quick and how that works? This is the year of the Spork, right?
00:16:01.764 - 00:16:52.826, Speaker D: This is the year of the Spork. So this is the year we're going to really get into the explanation of the Spork Dow and how ownership works, how membership works, what the Spork tokens use for all of that stuff, because I think some people know. But even if every person who showed up to Ethanber last year comes this year, over 50% of the people here are going to be first timers. So most people don't know much about this, and so we want to make sure that they understand it. So Spork Dao is a limited cooperative association incorporated here in Colorado. Spork Dao is a community event dow, or a digital event cooperative, and it's owned by its community. So attending ETH Denver, people who show up as part of your application process, you sign a membership agreement.
00:16:52.826 - 00:17:39.120, Speaker D: If you opt in, it's an opt in thing. You don't have to do it, but as part of that, you become entitled to participate and receive Spork, which is the unit of account that we use to distribute value back to the community when the time comes, if and when there's profits and things like that. It's called a patronage distribution in terms of cooperatives. And it's a fun way to think about a next generation event experience because it's like when you come, it's kind of like rei for events. I'm an owner. I'm not just a consumer. I'm a contributor, an owner, and ultimately a receiver of a portion of the value that not only I contributed, but lots of other people as well.
00:17:39.650 - 00:18:04.386, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, it feels like the opportunity to be part owner as a contributor is one of the big memes and ideas behind Web Three. Airbnb couldn't do a distribution to their hosts of their token or their stock, and Uber couldn't do it. And I really think that this is one of the most regenerative things that Web Three can do for the world, is turn us from consumers into citizens and part owners of our economies.
00:18:04.498 - 00:18:30.026, Speaker D: I think it's the most important thing. In fact, I would go so far as to say this is of all of the tools that we've created in Web Three smart contracts, dows NFTs the most important thing is the coordination mechanism of a community token. Now, how the design of the community token is executed is paramount. And this is why I'm so excited about Colorado co ops, because the legal.
00:18:30.058 - 00:18:32.126, Speaker A: Wrapper that makes it not a security.
00:18:32.308 - 00:19:11.434, Speaker D: And really helps sort of like give clarity to regulators about what you're using it for. So what we use it for is the unit of account that the Dow uses to determine how much of the profits a member is entitled to if and when there's a distribution of patronage. Right, okay. So there's also a voting component at some point with governance, but that's down the road. But right now it's just that unit of account. So if you own a bunch of spork and you're staking them, which is something that we're launching at Ether here.
00:19:11.632 - 00:19:19.642, Speaker A: You'Ll be able to is that an announcement? Is that just a casual alpha leak that you're going to move fast? Okay, cool. Stake your spork.
00:19:19.706 - 00:19:31.266, Speaker D: Stake your spork. You're going to want to stake your spork for sure because that's basically putting your marker down saying, I'm in on this thing. I've earned these sporks. So every person who's attended Ethnberg historically has had the ability to probably got.
00:19:31.288 - 00:19:34.802, Speaker A: A nice little AirDrop list with the attendees for the last five or six years.
00:19:34.856 - 00:19:48.742, Speaker D: Oh my God. We have over 40,000 unique holders of spork. I mean, it's a pretty cool community. I mean, to get in an engaged community of 40,000 unique holders is not an easy thing to do in Web Three.
00:19:48.876 - 00:20:02.800, Speaker A: But also just like the template, I think, of providing value first and then generating that value or that list through the value and seeing who's engaged in then doing the token distribution is just the way that all projects should do it in the future.
00:20:04.050 - 00:21:06.602, Speaker D: It's easy to say, it's really hard to do, but we have the good fortune of having other reasons why people want to be here, right? So it's not like we had to convince them about a token or something else. We don't need to. And we're happy to let the idea of spork and the demand for spork and all of that mature over time and take our time because we have again the good fortune of having thousands and thousands and thousands of people who are engaged in the value that we create. Aside from that, this just happens to be a cool, like, oh, really? I actually get a wait, what? It's a free event and I get to participate in the ownership of this? How does that work? It's pretty cool. So again, it's a big experiment. It seems to be working, but none of this is mature yet and we'll just see how it goes.
00:21:06.676 - 00:21:10.194, Speaker A: Great. Okay, I got one more question about sporked out and then I want to talk about Bittle Week?
00:21:10.232 - 00:21:10.820, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:21:11.830 - 00:21:12.622, Speaker A: Why is spork?
00:21:12.686 - 00:21:15.474, Speaker D: So it's a spoon that has little the four prongs.
00:21:15.522 - 00:21:18.994, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, so the four prongs of the fork what are the four prongs?
00:21:19.042 - 00:21:40.202, Speaker D: The four prongs of the Spork are community eat, denver Buffcorn Ventures and Colorado Jam. Okay, so the meme of the spork is, if you think about the Buffacorn, is the merging of the magic of the unicorn and the strength of the buffalo in simple terms.
00:21:40.336 - 00:21:42.314, Speaker A: So the ethnic mascot is a Buffacorn.
00:21:42.362 - 00:21:49.918, Speaker D: The Buffacorn buffalo, half unicorn, and how many times you ever seen a unicorn collaborating with another unicorn? Like, never.
00:21:50.004 - 00:21:52.798, Speaker A: You never see I've ever seen a unicorn, actually, now that I think about it.
00:21:52.804 - 00:22:12.920, Speaker D: Well, now you got to really screw up the joke. The point being is even conceptually, unicorns don't hang out with other unicorns unless you're My Little Pony. You can ask my daughter about that. But buffalo do. Right? So the community vibe of the buffalo with the magical, fantastical nature of the unicorn makes for some fun.
00:22:16.170 - 00:22:27.882, Speaker A: To just so everyone knows who's not local to Colorado, the buffalo is a symbol of Colorado. I think the cu they're mascot is Buff Buffalo. Yeah, okay, got it.
00:22:28.016 - 00:22:57.450, Speaker D: Yeah. So the spork is something similar. So in terms of web3 or just protocol talk, there's this thing called a hard fork, which is usually a contentious fork of code. So in the Bitcoin community back in 2017, they forked from BTC to BSc and whatever else. Right. Or BSV or BCH, I don't know, whatever. Very contentious, very uncollaborative.
00:22:57.450 - 00:23:27.102, Speaker D: Now, certainly that's fine if people want to do that, I guess I'm fine with that. It's kind of the point of open source, is being able to fork communities. I think it's great. But one of the things I love about the Ethereum community is it's so much more collaborative. So they were calling some of the upgrades of the Ethereum Protocol back in 2017 soft forks. So then I just said, I see where it's going. It kind of just sounds like a spork to me.
00:23:27.102 - 00:23:58.534, Speaker D: And so I started tweeting about that. And then you think about the spork, and it's this beautiful utilitarian tool that, if you think about it, I could dig with it, I could eat with it, I could probably even fight you with it. I could do a bunch of things with it, and it's very versatile. So this in combination with the biddle meme, which is the sort of expression of creativity of one's personal it's a use your spork to know it's meme central over here.
00:23:58.572 - 00:24:11.654, Speaker A: If you're listening on audio only. John has a spork in his hand. He's just gesticulating with it. But I do think the coolest thing is the So Buffercorn Ventures Colorado Jam, which is a hackathon for the Colorado lottery that y'all ran out here ETH.
00:24:11.702 - 00:24:24.266, Speaker D: Denver that's just one of the entities we did the game jam with the lottery. But the Colorado Jam generally is use cases that might be of interest to the state infrastructure or the state communities.
00:24:24.378 - 00:24:26.526, Speaker A: That's still legitimizing for the technology.
00:24:26.628 - 00:24:43.958, Speaker D: Oh, yeah, of course. I mean, we get to pilot all sorts of interesting things and talk to different state agencies and governments. So far we're still looking for governments are not really set up to apply web3 tech in their existing the.
00:24:43.964 - 00:24:46.758, Speaker A: Talent prong of their yeah, we basically.
00:24:46.844 - 00:25:12.910, Speaker D: Provide the talent to be able to quickly prototype and experiment because if you're trying to do it from inside the state, you can't do it. So we fund it. We do it. We have all the creative license and freedom to kind of execute how we see fit, and then we demo and pilot and we're experimenting all the time with well.
00:25:12.980 - 00:25:40.466, Speaker A: So the neat thing for me is it seems like with Sporkdow, you're not just getting upside in ETH Denver when you have ownership and you're not just getting governance in that, but you're getting it on all the different prongs of the Spork, I think. And that's what's cool, is that as an attendee of ETH Denver, I don't think I would even know that until the year of the Spork. And that's all explained to me exactly. To just attend an event and provide value to the community and have venture scale upside in buffercord and ventures.
00:25:40.578 - 00:25:41.094, Speaker D: Exactly.
00:25:41.212 - 00:25:41.926, Speaker A: That's cool.
00:25:42.028 - 00:26:37.766, Speaker D: It's really mean none of this has ever been done. I mean, the closest thing that you could say is it's kind of like taking south by Southwest, merging it with Y Combinator, putting it in a co op and tokenizing it, and there's what you got, right? And as an attendee, as a Biddler, as a contributor, you become an owner. And the more you contribute, the deeper of ownership you get. Because as a Biddler, for example, you're going to get a much higher distribution of Spork tokens than you do just as a general attendee. As a sponsor, you get a higher Spork token distribution, but not even as high as you get as a Biddler. The biddlers get the most because that's the highest value contribution you can do is to biddle because we then invest in those projects and that's the vehicle of return value because ultimately those investments that Sporkdow makes, that Buffcorn Ventures makes, come back to the Spork holders in terms of returns. Again, regen games.
00:26:37.766 - 00:26:54.400, Speaker D: Right? So we've created the cycle of life for your attendance, your consumption, your sponsorship, your biddling, and then through investment and helping build these things into reality, actually returning that value to the people that invested time, attention and.
00:26:57.330 - 00:27:11.430, Speaker A: Got at least I think I understand the hyper object of ETH Denver. Hyper object being something that you only see a part of when you look at it from a certain angle and grasping the whole object, grasping your whole vision. Anything else to say about the meta level vision before we get object.
00:27:11.500 - 00:27:40.842, Speaker D: No. Let's get into bittle week. I think that's the thing that people really want to hear about Biddleweek and the ETH Denver main event. And let's talk about Shelling Point, let's talk about Near Day, let's talk about Side going to I think by the time everyone's hearing this, it'll be Tuesday. It's Friday right now. So just for context here, we're at the main stage at the Biddleweek Hub, which is at Great Divide Brewing in Rhino on Brighton. So this venue will still be open through next Wednesday.
00:27:40.842 - 00:27:54.766, Speaker D: Coworking Lounges, chilling shilling, all sorts of stuff going on here. This venue is actually about as big as any other hackathon venue I've ever seen. The stage we're on right now, it's no Sports Castle.
00:27:54.798 - 00:27:56.334, Speaker A: I'll pour one out for the Sports Castle.
00:27:56.382 - 00:27:57.222, Speaker D: Yeah, no, that's true.
00:27:57.276 - 00:27:57.634, Speaker A: Venue.
00:27:57.682 - 00:28:36.990, Speaker D: Yeah, no, I mean, for what it's worth, we've never done anything this big and grand for a bit of week before. Yeah, it's always been sort of we've tried to accommodate, we've tried to kind of offer a little bit of here and there, but we've taken it to a whole nother level. This year, we actually have three venues. So it's this one. The Vibe Hotel has a stage in it and the Source Hotel has a stage in it. So there's activities, content, meetups, mini summits happening today, tomorrow, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday through next week until the main event venue opens next Thursday. That's the national Western complex in Rhino.
00:28:38.290 - 00:28:53.206, Speaker A: Yeah, well, quick show for Shelling Point, which will be on March 2, and is the region event that Gitcoin puts on. And I think that you have helped. So I'm disaffiliated from Gitcoin. It's Dow now, but back when I.
00:28:53.228 - 00:28:56.306, Speaker D: Was you're kind of a spirit animal still, but we'll let that slide.
00:28:56.338 - 00:28:59.798, Speaker A: I could be the Buff Accord half program.
00:28:59.884 - 00:29:03.534, Speaker D: I can give you a buffer cord to ride into Gitcoin Dow.
00:29:03.602 - 00:29:34.978, Speaker A: Okay, well, I guess what I was just going to say is that in 2020, we had this crazy idea that we were going to run this side event at East Denver and we called it Sustained Web Three. At that point was focused on open source software and you kind of gave us the space to prototype it. And every year it evolved from Sustained Web Three into Shelling Point, and then every year it gets bigger and more regen. And so I think it's neat that you're letting other people sort of swim in your wake of running these events and grow their own communities. And it's not just Shelling Point, but it's also I know that near is hosting a bunch of events. There's a bunch of other people that.
00:29:34.984 - 00:30:06.222, Speaker D: You'Re I mean, there's over 300 side events between hacker houses, like official side events, parties, dinners. We've seen hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of them. So my philosophy on that is the same as everything else. It's positive. Some games, right? Like a lot of. People believe that they've got to protect their space, right? And we've said, well, look, we have a responsibility to execute a good product. And if we do, if we create a good experience for people, other people are going to want to come and sort of draft on that.
00:30:06.222 - 00:30:40.562, Speaker D: And we can either embrace it or we can hate on it. And we've embraced it because, again, we're trying to contribute to success. And to see it as a competition, especially at the early stages of Web Three, I think is a mistake. We're not competing with each other. We should be competing with darker forces that are in the traditional world or just existing models that need reinventing or people that just have a resistance to this kind of stuff. We should not be fighting with ourselves. I think that's the wrong way to see it and it's not living the ethos.
00:30:40.562 - 00:31:26.310, Speaker D: We talk about collaboration, we talk about positive sum regen. We got to do it in all areas of our lives and this just happens to be one of them. So Bittle Week is it started as an open source calendar where we just were hosting something to let people because we didn't want to have like an official Blockchain week, boring corporate stuffy thing. But now it's turned into a huge open source calendar where people can do whatever they want and we're happy to support. I mean, we've got a big infrastructure that we built. So part of the reason why we wanted Shelling Point to become Shelling Point was because there's a little bit different angle and vibe that you guys bring. I've already got the infrastructure built, so you don't need to recreate a million dollar event.
00:31:26.310 - 00:31:36.166, Speaker D: We can do it for a pittance of that and share the wares of a great viewpoint that otherwise wouldn't get produced.
00:31:36.278 - 00:32:06.242, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I think that I can't speak for Gitcoin, but I'm thankful that you've created that Shelling Point to create a Shelling Point. Happy to do it. And I just want to comment on what you said about the culture not being sort of corporate and stuffy. You gave me this. If you're watching on video, you can see it, but if you're on audio only, I'm wearing this sort of tie dye, velour psychedelic thing. And I think it's just emblematic of your culture that you all create a new weird vibe. And meme every year.
00:32:06.296 - 00:32:24.246, Speaker D: Embrace the weird. We actually say this quite a bit. I think a lot of quote, conferences have this sort of like, template of how you need to know, at minimum, the Silicon Valley dress up, which is the jeans and sport coats and T shirts, right? And like, I got a Patagonia vest.
00:32:24.278 - 00:32:27.174, Speaker A: In my bag, but it's cold as AF in Colorado.
00:32:27.222 - 00:32:53.442, Speaker D: Yeah, it's pretty cold today, but remember, it's going to be nice tomorrow. You're not going to need it. But for us, it's like, embrace the weird. Everybody's got their own self their own creativity. And we just don't want anybody to feel like they can't be who they are. So we lead the way on that. I mean, we literally have buffacorn onesies that you can buy this year, right? So little hint on that.
00:32:53.442 - 00:33:22.154, Speaker D: Little alpha drop. If you happen to be dumb enough to buy one of those from the buffet swag store and you wear it to opening ceremonies, you get a freaking sweet present. And I'm not going to tell you what it is, but you're going to want it. So little alpha drop to the listeners there. If you happen to be, like I said, ridiculous enough to go buy that thing and wear it to opening ceremonies, that's the key. You got to wear it to opening ceremonies and you got to listen for the call. There's going to be a call to action of sorts.
00:33:22.282 - 00:33:22.622, Speaker A: Okay.
00:33:22.676 - 00:33:26.800, Speaker D: Hint, hint. All right, next.
00:33:28.290 - 00:33:38.206, Speaker A: I am teased. I am intrigued. That is fun. Yeah. So wear the buffacorn onesie if you buy it to the opening ceremonies and you get a gift and then the opening party.
00:33:38.238 - 00:34:03.722, Speaker D: Let's talk about that. So the opening party is being hosted by near sponsored by Shelling Point Sparkdow Eat denver Mission Ballroom, I think. Mission Ballroom. It's going to be fantastic. So that kicks off good venue. Oh my. Mean, it's just around the corner and it is the premier venue probably in Denver when it comes to throwing parties like that.
00:34:03.722 - 00:34:24.846, Speaker D: And it's going to be off the hook. So thanks to Nier, thanks to Ilya, thanks to Yudira, who's producing it. So shameless. Shout out for them. They put in an amazing amount of time contributing to the ETH Denver community. A lot of people think, well, it's ethereum. It's actually kind of more like EVM Denver nowadays.
00:34:24.846 - 00:34:54.314, Speaker D: The ethereum attraction is something that a lot of these layer two subscribe to as mean, it's the virtual machines, it's the moat complementary. Yeah, they're not competing. I used to give Ilya a bunch of crap about that. It's like, oh, your ethereum killer is like, no dude, he's like, we understand exactly what this is going to be and how we need to interoperate. And I think it's a very smart thing to understand. Collaboration is the key. It's a multi chain future, and we embrace that too.
00:34:54.314 - 00:35:01.306, Speaker D: We've got, I think, nine layer ones or ten layer ones coming. And a bunch of layer twos are.
00:35:01.328 - 00:35:03.738, Speaker A: Almost all of them EVM then. So that's the distinction.
00:35:03.834 - 00:35:04.750, Speaker D: Almost all of them.
00:35:04.820 - 00:35:05.150, Speaker A: Okay.
00:35:05.220 - 00:35:10.640, Speaker D: I mean, there's maybe like one that's not yeah, and they even say they've got EVM coming.
00:35:11.170 - 00:35:12.186, Speaker A: It's on the roadmap.
00:35:12.218 - 00:35:14.750, Speaker D: Yeah, everybody's doing EVM.
00:35:15.890 - 00:35:23.698, Speaker A: So get weird. Wear a buff, a corn to the opening ceremony. Come to the opening party. What are other highlights you got for.
00:35:23.704 - 00:35:53.242, Speaker D: Us on Tuesday night? So if this is dropping Tuesday during the day, if you own a buffacorn biddle brigade, NFT we have a free event for you called Buffalo Laughs at number 38 in Rhino. It is going to be a hoot. It is going to be a ton of fun. So starting at 08:00, we've got a slate of folks that are going to do comedy sets from the community. We've got some surprise things that are going to happen, and then we've got DJ Big Red Machine spinning until 01:00 A.m. After that. So it's going to be a super fun time.
00:35:53.242 - 00:36:04.910, Speaker D: But you will be able to claim your free ticket through. We look. And all you got to do is have your Buffcorn Biddle Brigade in your wallet that you're claiming from and it'll be free to attend.
00:36:05.730 - 00:36:12.366, Speaker A: Is the Buffcorn Biddle Brigade, whether it's a mouthful that's the NFT that people will use as their profile picture on Twitter.
00:36:12.398 - 00:36:39.740, Speaker D: Yeah, that's right. Okay, yeah, got it. The Buffalcorn Biddle brigade is the 10,000 NFT PFP. There's many reasons to want to own one of those at the event. There's even a private Buffalo Bittle Brigade lounge with claw machines and other fun Tom Foolery things that are going to be going on there. There's going to be private swag drops. We even have rare swag that you can't get unless you own one.
00:36:40.190 - 00:36:48.730, Speaker A: Your swag game is pretty strong, I got to say. You can't see it if you're on audio only. But there's a lot of fun, weird swag that you all have invested in. And I think it's culture.
00:36:48.890 - 00:37:25.590, Speaker D: It's culture, it's fashion, it's culture. Fashion is a representation of culture. Right? So the way I see it is the ethnberg sparked out Brand. The way we physically and visually represent it is important. Just talking about it is not enough. You've got to really think about how do you give people a piece of the culture to put on their bodies that they want to wear, right? So it's got to be reasonably fashionable, it's got to be comfortable, it's got to be corporate. Schwag is terrible, typically.
00:37:25.670 - 00:37:29.110, Speaker A: Well, it's part of participation is kind of getting into the swag.
00:37:29.190 - 00:37:47.614, Speaker D: Yeah. And when you can meld that with everyday life and culture, with clothing and articles that people actually want to use and they want to wear, then you win. Right? And we've been very good at that. I see our Swag all over the world when we travel to different places.
00:37:47.662 - 00:38:01.006, Speaker A: Swag is one of my metas also. So I've taken inspiration from you and super modular. My new company is called Super Modular since it is affiliated from Gitcoin and going to try to compete one up Gitcoin on Swag. And then we'll have to try to one up sporkdal and ethnic on.
00:38:01.128 - 00:38:07.042, Speaker D: Good luck with that. But again, it's not competitive. If you want help, I'd be happy to lend a little creative eye.
00:38:07.106 - 00:38:22.326, Speaker A: Now we got to merge the Bufficorn, which is a unicorn in a buffalo, with a Gitcoin robot, which is a robot learning to love a robocorn. Robo? Yeah, robo. I don't know, we'll figure something out there. Well, is there anything I didn't ask that you want to say? Any other highlights of ETH Denver?
00:38:22.438 - 00:38:31.182, Speaker D: Look, I think the thing that is most important is a lot of people think that the main event is really the only thing that you need to come to.
00:38:31.236 - 00:38:32.960, Speaker A: It's not just ETH Denver, it's a whole.
00:38:35.170 - 00:38:36.250, Speaker D: Mean biddleweek.
00:38:36.330 - 00:38:39.460, Speaker A: So ETH Denver is just like the beacon chain of all of the different.
00:38:40.230 - 00:39:08.730, Speaker D: Like so check out the Bitterweek counter@ethnberg.com. There's stuff all over the city. Go check it out. Come to the hub. There's coworking, Wi Fi, snacks, drinks, lounges, all sorts of cool stuff that it's not stuffy, it's casual. There's people that want to meet and talk and hang out and if all you do is come and people watch, you're going to get your fill of that, too.
00:39:08.880 - 00:39:13.230, Speaker A: There's plenty of Colorado to enjoy, skiing and breweries and all that kind of stuff.
00:39:13.300 - 00:39:14.478, Speaker D: Lots of Colorado fun.
00:39:14.564 - 00:39:35.026, Speaker A: Although I will say, please enjoy responsibly. It is very dry out here. Drink lots of water, elevation, pace yourself if that gets to you. The beer is stronger if you have IPAs, and if you're into marijuana gummies, please pace yourself. Actually, my first year at ETH Denver, I cleaned up puke of a major project founder that had too many, I.
00:39:35.048 - 00:39:39.706, Speaker D: Won'T say who, but I remember that memory.
00:39:39.758 - 00:39:41.970, Speaker A: So now I'm trying to tell people to be responsible.
00:39:42.050 - 00:39:46.678, Speaker D: Word of warning, the marijuana gummies are a lot stronger than you might think they are.
00:39:46.764 - 00:39:48.374, Speaker A: Yeah, well, they're well labeled in terms.
00:39:48.412 - 00:39:58.026, Speaker D: Of they are, but when you're at altitude and all the other physiological things that happen when you're at altitude, just pace yourself, be careful and hyped up.
00:39:58.048 - 00:40:04.240, Speaker A: About Ethanburg for all yeah, there's all sorts of get over your skis if you're a noob, super easy.
00:40:04.610 - 00:40:45.926, Speaker D: Again, the altitude is a big deal and a huge factor in that for a lot of people coming from sea level. So I think it's just one of those things. Just pace yourself. There's a lot of time. If you're in town now, take the day to acclimate kind of ease into the pool because you got plenty of time. I'll be around all week at Bitter Week, so I'll be actually hosting the Buffaloes event on Tuesday evening. And yeah, I'll also be at the Source Hotel pretty much all day on Tuesday for the Future of Work symposium in the morning and then the Dow thing in the afternoon.
00:40:45.926 - 00:40:47.994, Speaker D: I think you're going to be there too, aren't you, for that?
00:40:48.112 - 00:40:49.098, Speaker A: Yeah, that's the pen.
00:40:49.184 - 00:41:24.006, Speaker D: Yeah. So anyways, yeah, I think that the thing is and at worst, tune into live stream. Everything's being live streamed. Eatdember.com. You can grab the various feeds on the links. It's all being streamed on Twitch. Everything will be updated to YouTube within a certain period of time, so you'll be able to go back and watch various talks or if you missed something, but yeah, I mean, we're trying to canonize all of this and provide as much free access to learning and wisdom and creativity as we can.
00:41:24.108 - 00:41:25.554, Speaker A: Weirdness. Also weirdness.
00:41:25.602 - 00:41:38.040, Speaker D: We're expecting pushing probably 400 hours of total recordings in content, so, I mean, it's a lot more than any one person could possibly consume, but there's something for everyone.
00:41:39.290 - 00:41:42.382, Speaker A: I think that's place to end it. John, you're a force of nature. Thanks for doing this.
00:41:42.436 - 00:41:44.206, Speaker D: Thanks, man. Good to have you, brother. Thank you.
00:41:44.308 - 00:41:47.630, Speaker A: Looking forward to the whole bunch of events this year.
00:41:47.780 - 00:41:50.926, Speaker D: Thanks. And, yeah, look forward to getting weird with you, man. Let's do it.
00:41:50.948 - 00:41:51.322, Speaker A: Cheers.
00:41:51.386 - 00:41:51.660, Speaker D: All right.
