00:00:00.250 - 00:00:00.800, Speaker A: You.
00:00:04.850 - 00:00:53.234, Speaker B: What up? Coordination. Today on the pod, we got Adam Stollard from Bright ID, which is a tool that creates civil resistance in web3, basically weeding out sock puppet accounts so that you can build more one human, one vote type systems. The way bright id works is off of a data science methodology called web of trust. So basically quickly allowing you to verify with your peers that they're actual humans and they've got this whole big, beautiful web of trust that creates more civil resistance in the ecosystem. Gitcoin uses it for civil resistance with gitcoin grants. And it's just a real delight to talk to Adam because, boy, Gitcoin integrated with them in like, Gitcoin grants round six, and that was two years ago. And they have grown a lot as a technology platform, have become a dow, have become more sophisticated in their civil resistance and so is gitcoin.
00:00:53.234 - 00:01:27.090, Speaker B: So we're kind of like sister projects in that way. And I am just really excited to have Adam on the show to talk about civil resistance and how that contributes to a more regenerative, a society with more high resolution democracy with more civil resistance and is more pluralistic. So this episode was a lot of fun. Adam is super thoughtful and is really taking this problem of civil resistance seriously. And that's what we go deep in on this episode. So without further ado, I give you Adam Stallard of Bread ID enjoy. Coordination.
00:01:27.170 - 00:02:09.774, Speaker C: Refi Summer has arrived and Celo is here for it. Celo is the layer one blockchain for the regenerative finance movement. It's fast, planet positive and built for the real world. Celo has committed towards producing a sustainable future from the very beginning and is the world's first carbon negative, EVM compatible layer one blockchain. Celo has become much more than a technology, a currency, a community, or even just a layer one cello is a movement to create conditions of prosperity for everyone. You can soon engage with all of this via green asset uniswap pools on Celo, benefiting reforestation and other regenerative products through the Toucan protocol, Moss and more. Refi is also about the health of communities and resource network is creating bankless infrastructure for circular trade and mutual credit networks to benefit small businesses and local economies, all on celo.
00:02:09.774 - 00:02:52.754, Speaker C: Follow long on Twitter to learn more about how Celo is accelerating Refi summer for a positive impact on people, communities and the planet. If you're attending ECC, visit the cello saloon to learn about what's happening on the front lines of Refi from industry experts.

00:03:13.680 - 00:03:15.098, Speaker B: Hey Adam, how's it going?
00:03:15.264 - 00:03:16.890, Speaker A: Going really well, thanks.
00:03:17.040 - 00:03:29.326, Speaker B: Yeah, same. I am really excited to talk to you about civil resistance and bright id. So let's tee off with a super broad question. Why does civil resistance matter? And what is bright id?
00:03:29.508 - 00:04:11.574, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks. So the reason civil resistance matters is a lot of times when we try to give away something of value to people, there's a very small, tiny subset of people that are just kind of like waiting in the works to jump on that and just exploit the system and take more than their fair share. So we need to stop those people, and that's known as a civil attack when someone comes with multiple accounts hoping to exploit a system, and that's what we need to stop. And that's exactly like the tiny little thing that bright id tries to do really well is to stop attacks.
00:04:11.702 - 00:04:37.862, Speaker B: So it's basically like I put out a bowl of jelly beans and I say one jelly bean per person, and there's going to be that one guy that is going in and taking a whole fistful of jelly beans and bread id is a little piece of software that kind of like gates it and says, okay, prove your identity and then you can have a jelly bean. Is that kind of like a good real world parallel to the digital thing that bread id does?
00:04:37.996 - 00:05:06.720, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great analogy. And that analogy works on other levels too, because it's like if you're there babysitting that bowl of jelly beans, the problem is really easy, everybody. You're like, here's your jelly bean. Here's your jelly bean. When you try to automate things, which in the case of the jelly beans is like, okay, I don't want to have to expend the manpower to have someone manning this jelly bean bowl the whole time. I'm just going to leave it here with a little note. Please take one.
00:05:06.720 - 00:05:45.066, Speaker A: Unfortunately, we found that that little note that says, please take one doesn't work. There's always that person that just comes and takes the whole bowl. So we need something that works with an automated system in the real world, in real life, when we've got real people, it's really easy to tell that a person is just a person. But as soon as you move into the digital realm and things become automated and you're trying to run things with computer programs rather than every interaction requiring a human being, then you need something like bright id.
00:05:45.248 - 00:06:08.098, Speaker B: Right? And I also say, I know a requirement of bright id is that we're not trying to build a panopticon. So if I had to upload my passport that has my national id on it and my date of birth and my address on it into some system in order to get those jelly beans, then that's a different requirement than a privacy preserving, civil resistance tool.
00:06:08.264 - 00:06:44.010, Speaker A: Yeah, that's exactly right. So there's a couple of problems with using something like a national id. One is, like you said, that there's just way too much data attached to it and you don't need to share all that data. You just need to know that that person is a unique person. You just need to answer that one simple question. And then the other problem is that the creator and the guardian of that is this government agency that we don't get to. I mean, we supervise it from a great distance.
00:06:44.010 - 00:07:30.042, Speaker A: We don't get to know what's going on. So there could be some worker named Bob inside that agency who figures out like, hey, national ids are now used for acquiring jelly beans. I'm just going to go over to my office here and print up 10,000 ids so I can have 10,000 jelly beans. We don't know that there's any mechanism within those agencies to stop something like that. So it's better if we have a solution where everybody can audit each other and make sure that the people who are authorizing the verifications are under control of other people that are auditing verification. So it's kind of like this. You watch me, I watch you.
00:07:30.042 - 00:07:31.930, Speaker A: We all watch each other type of thing.
00:07:32.080 - 00:08:15.050, Speaker B: Yeah, totally. And just to illustrate the nation state thing, I think in one of Vitalik's posts about identity, he kind of talks about the range of actors that you can protect against. And there's a range from petty criminals to the mob, organized crime, and then there's even nation state criminal systems, depending on what your international rule of law is. So nation states are not created equal in terms of their legitimacy. And I think that's a core point when you are just ruling out that as a mechanism for creating that. So I think now that we've talked about what bright id isn't, I'd love to talk about what bright id is and how it provides that civil resistance, that sock puppet resistance to distribution of digital jelly beans.
00:08:15.550 - 00:09:25.294, Speaker A: Right. Cool. We boil things down to the idea that the gatekeepers of jelly beans or other digital goods, where it's one per person, should be the people that know you best, because they're the ones that are in the best position to know that this is your one and only you, your one and only account that's approaching this good that you want. And really all the other systems in the history. So if we go before digital systems and look at other systems that were used to give out benefits of certain kinds over the history of humanity, they've always been around some sort of social trust where either this, the simple example where you've got a tribe of people where everybody knows each other, that's an easy one to solve. It's like, well, we know Bob is one person because we know the whole tribe, and this is Bob. And so that's the easiest one to solve.
00:09:25.294 - 00:11:17.080, Speaker A: And then once you start to grow into the size of cities and other larger groups, then what's kind of happened in the past is we'll assign people those roles. Like, we'll create a government that's in charge of issuing ids, or we'll create a system of notaries where they can sign and vouch for people. That's worked pretty well over the years, but it hasn't transitioned well into the digital world, and that's the biggest problem, and that's what we need to solve. And so I don't think I actually, at the beginning, when I was trying to solve this problem, I thought, well, what if we brought national ids into it? Would that work? And then I realized, well, even if you start to do that, then, because the Internet is everybody, you get this weird other problem, which I can't work on, which is the problem of how do you federate this type of control, how do you get the nation states to work together? Or how do you get everyone to accept every type of id? And that problem really wasn't interesting to me, and I didn't even think that that was something I could solve. So instead I thought, well, what if we go backwards and look at kind of other types of social relationships that we have and see if we can't leverage those and do it in a way that it would work even if there was no nation state or even if you're one of the many people, millions of people in the world, who is, what's the term? Basically, like, de nationalized. You don't have any citizenship anywhere. We want something that could work for those people as well.
00:11:17.080 - 00:12:18.200, Speaker A: If you look at the way nation states approach it, often there'll be birth registration, so they'll say, okay, this is an event where we can track that a new person came into being. So we'll go here, and we'll trust the hospital to vouch for this person and then the parents and they'll all sign this document together that said that this is a new person. And then from there, we can create a new identifier for this person. We'll give them a Social Security card, and then they're good to go. And that works pretty well until it comes time to bring it onto the Internet. And then I think many of us are familiar with how horribly things have gone wrong when Social Security numbers have gotten onto the Internet, all the data breaches that have happened, et cetera, how hard it is to actually replace a Social Security card. So with bright id, what we want to do is we say, okay, it's the people that know you best that get to vouch for you.
00:12:18.200 - 00:13:48.322, Speaker A: The mom and dad that were there at your birth registration could also be the people that vouch for you and get you verified. And bright id, it's just a different setting that works natively well with the Internet because your mom and dad can cryptographically sign the fact that you're a person, and then other people can sign that as well to give it even more validity so that your mom and dad aren't just inventing fake kids to game the system or something. And then from there, you get verified. And the nice thing about using cryptography is then when you take that unique identifier into different realms, you don't carry all this baggage with you, like all this other personal data that isn't actually necessary to just answer that one question of, are you a unique person? And also, let's see, what was I going to say about privacy? So the nice thing about using cryptography is when you bring that into another realm, you can kind of abstract away that original identifier. So you can say, okay, here was your bright id, which we can kind of relate that to a Social Security number. Here's your bright id. But we're not actually going to use your bright id.
00:13:48.322 - 00:14:14.238, Speaker A: We're going to use something else. We're going to use another unique identifier and then we're going to allow you to link that to your bright id in a way that the application that's getting this uniqueness verification never actually sees your bright id. So that if there is a data breach that it's not something like, oh, I've got to go get a new Social Security number now. It's like, no, nothing got leaked to them.
00:14:14.404 - 00:14:33.298, Speaker B: Yeah, that's one of the things that's never really made sense to me, knowing about public private key cryptography. Why my Social Security number is my private key and my public key. And it seems like you all, since you're using 21st century technology, have managed to get around the data breach problem.
00:14:33.464 - 00:14:48.360, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. Social Security numbers are really old. They're from like something. And public key cryptography came out in the guess they're just really slow to adopt it.
00:14:48.750 - 00:15:17.362, Speaker B: Yeah. So tell me the use case for bright idea. I think I download an iPhone app and then it gives me a QR code and you and I will say, hey, scan me and verify that I'm a person. And then basically once I have a certain number of verifications, then I have some sort of trust level. And then there's kind of a web of trust is what you're building on the back end there, is that more or less, right?
00:15:17.496 - 00:15:27.470, Speaker A: That's right. So what I would do, since we're on video, is this video being captured for the podcast, by the way.
00:15:27.560 - 00:15:37.110, Speaker B: So we're going to have about half audio listeners and half video ones, but we can just speak to what we're doing so the audio people can hear it.
00:15:37.180 - 00:16:04.910, Speaker A: Okay, sounds good. So I just opened up my bright id app and there's something that says, well, let me back up. So if I say my code, if I click on my code, I get to show you a code. This works over video. I can hold this up. And then if you get your phone that has bright id on it, you open up the bright id app and you click scan a code and you scan this. And if you happen to have it, we could even do it right now if you happen to have your mobile phone.
00:16:04.910 - 00:16:15.650, Speaker A: If not, that's fine. I can just talk through what it's like. So you scan this and then I will pop up on your screen. You'll pop up on my screen. The interesting thing about this. Yeah, you got it. Okay.
00:16:15.720 - 00:16:17.862, Speaker B: Let me turn off the blur on my camera, actually.
00:16:17.996 - 00:16:21.766, Speaker A: Well, just scan me because you don't need to be unblurry. You just need to scan me.
00:16:21.948 - 00:16:32.922, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm doing that. I wanted to show my phone after what I see when I scan you. Yeah. Okay, here we go. We have the technology.
00:16:33.056 - 00:16:33.418, Speaker A: All right.
00:16:33.424 - 00:16:52.074, Speaker B: So I just scanned you and I have this little screen that has your information on it and it looks like I can mark you as suspicious or already known or just met. So I'm going to put already known since you and I have known each other for a couple of years. And now it looks like you're waiting to confirm my connection.
00:16:52.202 - 00:17:05.998, Speaker A: Yes, I see that we have no mutual connections, which is possible. I already know I have a new.
00:17:06.024 - 00:17:07.782, Speaker B: Phone and that's why.
00:17:07.916 - 00:17:26.490, Speaker A: Okay, you're starting over. This is good. Yeah, because you'll soon have some bright id verifications now that we've made that connection. So that's good. That information that we got, very importantly, that's just shared peer to peer between you and me.
00:17:26.640 - 00:17:27.002, Speaker B: Okay.
00:17:27.056 - 00:18:04.406, Speaker A: So there's no server anywhere that stores this information. There's no Facebook esque type thing. That's like collecting all this data that was just between you and me. So if I know, let's say that the two of us have nicknames for each other and that's how we know each other and maybe we have weird pictures that we like to use as our avatars or whatever. All of that is totally fine. There's no requirement other than that the other person should be able to recognize who they're connecting with.
00:18:04.588 - 00:18:05.318, Speaker B: Right.
00:18:05.484 - 00:19:05.078, Speaker A: And that's another thing that people ask about bright id is, is this going to out me in some way if I get bright id verified? And the answer is no, it's not, number one, because when you're making that connection, you're just sharing with the person that you connect with. It's not always possible at this point to find someone that you already know that is going to help you get bright id verified, unfortunately. So we have these connection parties. So you will have to make a connection to someone that you don't already know and share your name and photo and your face with them. So that part, but that's not the same as outing yourself on a public registry. Or something like that, or uploading your data to a server. But if you're lucky enough to already know someone who's in bright id, you're not sharing any data with anyone that doesn't already know that data, and you can still become bright id verified.
00:19:05.078 - 00:19:28.946, Speaker A: And then it goes one step further because once you start connecting with apps, they don't know anything about you. Like all the apps get is that little stamp of uniqueness that says that this is a verified bright id user. You don't know which one. We're not even going to give you the bright id identifier. We're going to give you this other identifier, such as an ethereum address or something like that, and that's all you get to know. And it's not linked to anything else.
00:19:29.128 - 00:20:04.814, Speaker B: Yeah, beautiful. Speaking of apps connecting, I have empirical experience of this because Gitcoin derives civil resistance for Gitcoin grants using bright id. So there we go. For the audio listeners, Adam's just showing off his Gitcoin integration on his phone. So Gitcoin grants relies on quadratic funding, which relies on civil resistance, and we derive civil resistance on gitcoin grants via bread id. I think the numbers were something like 30% of contributors are bread id verified or something like that. I'll have to look at the analytics again.
00:20:04.814 - 00:20:18.750, Speaker B: But yeah, it's been really great. Mutually beneficial, because gitcoin gets civil resistance from bright id. And I think that we sent a good set of users over to bright id to bootstrap your network. So it's been very mutually beneficial.
00:20:18.910 - 00:21:02.640, Speaker A: We love that. Yeah, because it's kind of this chicken and egg problem. To get bright id verified, you need to have other people that are bright id verified, and then you also need some compelling app, some reason to get bright id verified. So yeah, any large community like gitcoin that sends their community over to bright id helps with the whole bootstrapping thing, because then the next app, if you already got verified for a gitcoin, it's going to be super easy to get verified for the. I mean, you don't have to do anything, you just have to link the next app you're already verified. Plus all of your friends will have that much easier of a time of getting verified with bread id. They'll already know someone that's verified in bread id.
00:21:03.570 - 00:21:42.282, Speaker B: So I want to share my screen and show something that I just think is the coolest thing in the world. If I go to explore brightid.org, I can actually see a graph of all of the different. These look like dots on my screen, but they're all deeply connected to each other. And I think that this data model that we're looking at here, Adam, is called a web of trust. Tell me if I'm wrong, but basically you've got a directed graph where people can say, oh, I know each other. Actually, maybe not directed, but like a graph in that trust graph is like basically the data model that allows you to have certainty about different parts of the graph and whether or not they're a civil attacker or not.
00:21:42.282 - 00:21:44.158, Speaker B: So did I get that mostly right?
00:21:44.244 - 00:22:16.306, Speaker A: Yeah, you got that right. So it is a directed graph, and the reason is because our connection with each other doesn't have to be symmetric. It can be asymmetric. You could say, I just met you, and I could say, I already know you might have different opinions on that. So it is actually directed. And the cool thing about Explorer, and by the way, if you want to access explorer, for those who have never tried it, there's a way to copy your explorer code. It's on the left hamburger menu.
00:22:16.306 - 00:23:01.720, Speaker A: On Bright ID, you'll get your explorer code, and there's also a password that you can find under your profile. If you hit edit profile, you can see your password, and so you can use your password and your explorer code to open up Explorer, brightid.org. And the cool thing about it is it'll show you your view, including all the people that you know. So we probably don't want to share that on this recording right now because we don't want to out anyone. But, yeah, you can see your whole neighborhood. So for me, because I have like 600 connections, I can see my whole neighborhood of 600 connections, and I can see how they're connected to each other and all the other anonymous dots that they're connected to. So it's kind of fun to view the graph that way.
00:23:02.250 - 00:23:14.042, Speaker B: Beautiful. Are there any other sort of goodies that are worth showing off in the bright id analytics or labs ecosystem? I know that you all are always building new tools to understand the graph. Yeah.
00:23:14.096 - 00:24:20.814, Speaker A: So I can't really show it off because it's in public beta, actually, it's enclosed beta right now, but there's a new tool called aura. There's a forum post on it, and there's also a discord where. So if you're really interested, and this sounds like something that you want to try out, there are ways to get into the closed beta to get an invite. But what it is is it's a power toolbox for civil hunters. And so we want to extend this to not just bright id, but gitcoin and proof of humanity and any of the others projects that are really working hard on civil resistance. But we're starting out scratching our own itch. What we've realized is, in the years of working on bright id, is that almost all bright id users are just there to get verified, which is totally fine.
00:24:20.814 - 00:25:14.302, Speaker A: That totally makes sense. They found out that their app that they want to use requires bright id, and they say, okay, just tell me the steps. What do I need to do? I just want to find the quickest route from A to B, and I want to get verified, and that's going to be their interaction with bright ID pretty much, and that's fine. But then there's about 1% of users that go beyond that after they've been bright id verified, they either want to go help their friends get bright id verified, or they realize, hey, this is kind of a cool concept. Like, what else can be done with this? And so they explore deeper, and that's what the aura toolbox is for. It's a way to go beyond, and maybe I can share my screen. I wasn't really prepared for this, but let me see if I could pull it up and share my screen.
00:25:14.302 - 00:25:31.078, Speaker A: But aura is a way to. Let me see if I'm already logged in here. Yeah, I am. There's not a whole lot to show right now, but I'll share anyway and get back to zoom. Okay, so I'm going to share. Where was I? Aura. There we go.
00:25:31.078 - 00:25:48.394, Speaker A: Okay, so, Aura. In aura, I can rate people. So in bright, just. It's very simple. What you can say. You can label someone as just met already known or suspicious. And suspicious would be like, I don't know where this connection came from.
00:25:48.394 - 00:26:31.354, Speaker A: I wasn't expecting it, something like that. But in here, you can go beyond that, and you can start to rate people in your little group. So, like, I could go to my good friend Philip, and I can do a much more detailed rating of him, so I can give him an honesty rating. And what I'm doing there is. So this is beyond how well I know him. This is like my estimation of how likely he is to be an honest user versus an attacker. And there's different research tools that I can use to assess that.
00:26:31.354 - 00:27:02.882, Speaker A: And then once I've done that, I can go beyond that. If he's also an aura user, I can give him energy. So there's these little energy sliders, and I can give him some of my energy. And energy is something that is a concept in aura. It's a concept for bright ID power users. It doesn't exist for the normal 99% of bright ID users. 99% of bright Id users are not going to have energy.
00:27:02.882 - 00:27:48.034, Speaker A: But what energy means is it's your ability to help other people get verified. So the aura game is saying, I want to be someone who goes beyond just kind of like a consumer of bright id. I want to be a helper that helps other people get verified. I also want to help police the system and detect civil attacks. So in our early days of bright id, we played with the bright id graph, and we had algorithms that said, well, if I know you and you know someone else, then there's kind of like this. My vouching kind of flows a little bit. If I'm vouching for you, some of that flows over for you vouching for someone else.
00:27:48.152 - 00:27:49.870, Speaker B: This is kind of like edge rank.
00:27:50.030 - 00:28:23.158, Speaker A: Yeah. So we use something called civil rank to do that. But what we realized is that that relationship is not really transitive. If I know you and you know Bob, that doesn't mean that I know Bob. So that doesn't exactly work the way that we wanted. But in this aura construction, it does work the way we want. Because what I'm saying is, I know you, and I think that you're going to be a good aura player.
00:28:23.158 - 00:28:45.902, Speaker A: That's my rating of you. That's my energy. That's what energy means. I think you're going to be a good aura player, or I think you are a good aura player, and that is transitive. Because if I say you're a good aura player, that includes you saying that other people are being good aura players and being accurate, you being accurate about that assessment. So it actually is transitive. So you get this smaller graph.
00:28:45.902 - 00:29:27.454, Speaker A: It's also more manageable for these algorithms if it's a smaller graph. So you have this smaller graph of this 1% of bright id users that are the power users kind of rating each other on how honest they are, and not just how honest they are, but how good of a job they're going to do playing the aura game. Because you could be totally honest, but just be like a terrible aura player, but be a perfectly honest player. So that energy kind of combines those two. So they're all rating each other on how good of an aura player they're going to be. That energy gets spread around, and then the final hop of this graph. So the very outer edge of the graph is the other 99% of Bright ID users.
00:29:27.454 - 00:29:52.890, Speaker A: And all they need to do to get aura verified is connect is know one aura player and connect to that one aura player. If you can find more, that's even better for you. It increases your chances and your verification score, but you just got to find one. So the steps are simple. If you're not an aura player, you just find an aura player, connect to them. They'll take care of everything for you. They're kind of like your guardian or whatever.
00:29:52.890 - 00:30:17.330, Speaker A: Your introduction into becoming bright id verified, they'll say, okay, I've got your back. I'll take it from here. They do their research. They look at your account, they see who you're connected to. If there's some pieces missing or something that looks suspicious, they can help you work that out, and then they'll make sure that you get verified. So anyways, that's kind of what aura is. And then, like I said, it becomes this toolbox.
00:30:17.330 - 00:31:09.140, Speaker A: Right now, it's very simple. All we can do is pass energy around and rate people's honesty and help them get verified. But in the future, what we want is we want tools that allow me to do deeper research on people so we can see things like, okay, who else have they connected to? Are there connections missing that we expected them to have? A really interesting thing that I wrote a forum post about is, so let's say that I'm evaluating you to help you get aura verified. You're not an aura player, but I'm doing the work for you. Let's say that I know your so obviously I've connected with you on Bright ID. We have that connection. So let's say that I know your Twitter handle, which a lot of people know, so I know that.
00:31:09.140 - 00:32:08.226, Speaker A: And I feed that into the system anonymously using a cryptographic protocol called Socialist Millionaire protocol. And then other people do the same. And it can, without revealing which bright id user I connected to that said that they were Kevin Owalki. It can compare everybody else that also thought they were connecting to Kevin Owalki. And by anonymously comparing that Twitter handle, we can say, wait a minute, there's actually two people that people think are Kevin Owaki instead of just one. If that kind of makes connected to, let's say you connected to Philip, but you connected to Philip with a different bright of. We can detect that anomaly in the system without ever revealing anything.
00:32:08.226 - 00:32:55.750, Speaker A: So I don't have to reveal. So let's say someone's in there trying to fish for information. They're trying to figure out what your phone number is or what your Twitter handle is without even revealing what that is, we can save whether there's one Kevin in the system or two Kevin in the system, and so we can quickly shut down these kind of small scale civil attacks where you try to get verified using different accounts with different. So aura is going to have that bright id, doesn't have that. That's kind of one of the weaknesses of bright id right now is you could do something like that. You could say, well, okay, I'm going to go connect to this group of friends over here, get bright id verified. Now I'm going to take a different phone or make a new account, go over to this group of friends and get verified.
00:32:55.750 - 00:33:00.120, Speaker A: Aura completely shuts that down using the thing that I just.
00:33:04.810 - 00:33:39.860, Speaker B: Basically what you've done is kind of decentralized in a way, the network analysis role of the bright id system into this aura tool. And Gitcoin Dow listeners might not know this. We have like a whole fraud defense team at Gitcoin that's paid by the Dow, basically works for the DAO. And it's interesting to compare and contrast that, like having an internal team that's doing the fraud analysis versus a network graph based approach that kind of decentralizes it. And it just seems very elegant to me. So it's come a long way, actually, since I didn't even know about aura. That's very cool.
00:33:40.390 - 00:34:08.698, Speaker A: Yeah, we think this is the future just based on how we've seen users interact, and we hope that there's going to be lots of aura players. What we really want is this, to be able to be a paying job for people that are really good at it. I mean, if you're an excellent civil hunter, that could be your full time job. You could just be on the network, be on different networks. You could be on bright id, Gitcoin, et cetera. Just like hunting symbols. And that's your job.
00:34:08.698 - 00:34:09.898, Speaker A: So that's what we want.
00:34:09.984 - 00:34:43.874, Speaker C: Immutable X is the L2 platform for crypto gaming. Immutable offers massive scalability with up to 9000 transactions per second and instant transaction confirmation. No more gas fees, no more waiting around for your transaction to clear. Immutable's zero knowledge rollup finally unlocks the world of crypto gaming. Immutable X is the only gas free NFT minting platform with over 26 million nfts minted, all with zero gas fees. With the power of immutable, gaming developers don't also need to become smart contract developers. They just need to plug into Immutable's API and instantly start unlocking the full potential of crypto assets inside of games.
00:34:43.874 - 00:35:32.386, Speaker C: This is why world class companies and projects have decided to deploy on Immutable X like GameStop, Embersord, Planet Quest, Alluvium, TikTok and many more behind the scenes. So start building your game on immutable x today@immutable.com.

00:35:51.470 - 00:36:15.070, Speaker B: So I guess, you know, I'd love to talk for the users. So if you go to the App Store, you download bright id, you get verified, you go to a connection party. What can you do with it? Like, I want to take this thing for a spin. Now that I've got bright id, we've covered that you can contribute on Gitcoin grants and that contributes to your trust bonus on Gitcoin grants, increasing your civil resistance. What other are your favorite d apps? Once you're bread id verified to get integrated with?
00:36:15.240 - 00:37:01.330, Speaker A: Yeah, so some of my favorite ones are ones that give away something of value. So I think it's pretty cool when an app comes out and says like we're giving away tokens or nfts or whatever the case may be, or tokens that allow you to help govern a dow. But we're just going to limit the amount that we give per person rather than per address like we've seen done in the past. We're going to say that each person gets a certain number. So I love it when dows do that. Songadao did that with their DaO launch bright Dao, which is bright id's Dao. We did that with our launch.
00:37:01.330 - 00:37:31.630, Speaker A: So I think that's really cool. And I want to show something that I think a lot of people don't know about because it's really new. So let me share my screen again. But we launched something called Unitap and let me load that up. So I think it's just unitap app. So Unitap app. Unitap is a gas tap and soon to be a token tap.
00:37:31.630 - 00:38:33.066, Speaker A: And it's a way to collect tokens from different networks, just small amounts, just get you bootstrapped. So we want to be able to bring in the next 10 million crypto users, and we want them to actually be users, not just crypto holders, but crypto users, to find things to do with their tokens, whether it's participate in a Dow or just do any of the cool apps, any of the dapps that you can use. But a lot of times the barrier is that the network requires gas and they don't know how to bring that over. And so we want to really streamline this by letting people easily add the network. So we've seen things like Chainlist.org that allow you to easily add the network to metamask or whatever wallet you're using. We also want to give people gas tokens.
00:38:33.066 - 00:39:51.930, Speaker A: So this is kind of like chainlist plus a faucet. But as we've seen in the past, if you try to launch a faucet, a lot of times they'll get gamed. This is going back all the way to the first bitcoin faucet that Gavin Andreessen launched, where he was giving away 50 bitcoin to anyone that just showed up at the faucet because he wanted more people to have bitcoin, but he had to shut it down right away because for obvious reasons, someone figured out how to script it and just come and claim more than their fair share. So we use bright id to gate that. So you can come in here, you can get your little bits of gas tokens, but then the cool thing is we can go beyond that. And eventually, rather than just collecting gas tokens, we want you to be able to collect other tokens that are your gateway into other things, like Gateway into Dow participation, gateway into using an app. And eventually, we want people and projects to be able to give out kind of like micro Ubis, that if there's enough of them, they add up to a real UbI.
00:39:51.930 - 00:40:07.840, Speaker A: Anyways, we hope that this becomes something that a lot of apps use just to bring more people into their community without inviting all the Sybils in.
00:40:09.170 - 00:40:09.822, Speaker B: Right?
00:40:09.956 - 00:40:19.090, Speaker A: So this is already live and right now it's just got like a couple of main nets and bunch of test nets. But it's great, man.
00:40:19.160 - 00:40:36.200, Speaker B: Seems like a real triple win. I mean, it's more utility for the bright id network. It allows these networks to distribute their tokens to people who want them legitimately. And for the user, they get tokens to spend on these networks. So it seems like a real triple win.
00:40:36.730 - 00:41:24.840, Speaker A: Yeah, and just to mention Songadao again, they're going to use Unitap and I don't know if they're going to be using id chain or gnosis chain. They'll use one of those as kind of like the host for this new app that they're using to rate all the different songs in Songadao. And to be able to vote, to be able to participate, you need to stake a tiny little bit of the song token and you can go to Unitap and get a little bit of the song token. So anyone can just come and start participating without having to buy anything. Just kind of just smooths that. Plus you get the gas token for whatever network it's going to use. So you can just kind of like stop in there, get everything you need to start participating in the song ranking app.
00:41:25.850 - 00:41:40.730, Speaker B: Beautiful. I guess I'd love to talk about bread id Dow next, but I'm wondering if there's anything I didn't ask about the bright ids or journey or utility before we get into the Dow.
00:41:42.450 - 00:42:44.846, Speaker A: No, I think bright id is one of those things where it's like you'll discover cool apps that you can use. We have an updated apps tabs, so anyone's welcome to go to the apps tab and just start clicking on these and see what they are. I think you'll find that a lot of them are mostly giving things away because like we said, we're trying to protect that jelly bean bowl. So a lot of it is that. But there's also things like learn to earn like Rabbit hole, where it's like, okay, you've got to take this quiz to prove that you know the answers. But then once you know the answers, we don't want you coming back a thousand times and collecting it over and over. And then there's other things that are similar to Gitcoin where it has something to do with voting.
00:42:44.846 - 00:43:26.094, Speaker A: It's like your voting power is in some way related to being a unique human. So breaded is useful for that. So a lot of people who are not within the web3 community are like, well, I don't need $0.10 worth of a token and I don't want to vote in these weird things that I don't understand. But those of us that are deep into dows and stuff, like, mean, it's cool to discover. So I hope that Unitap becomes kind of a discovery engine for finding new uses for bright id. I hope that Dow tokens will start showing up there.
00:43:26.094 - 00:43:35.650, Speaker A: Other cool project tokens will show up there. So, yeah, if you're looking for more things to do with bright id, definitely keep your eye on Unitap.
00:43:36.070 - 00:43:55.240, Speaker B: Will do. Amazing. So tell me about bright id. Dao. So y'all have a dao. What's that about? How does it work? What was behind making it into a Dow? And how can people engage with that layer of the project?
00:43:56.250 - 00:45:05.946, Speaker A: Bright Dow is a gardens dow, which is a creation of one hive. They created a type of dow, which is, so it uses something called conviction voting, which basically says, okay, you use the community token, you vote on proposals. If you leave your token in a proposal, then your voting power automatically grows, which I find really interesting. And the whole point of that is to remove the need for getting everybody's attention because that's one of the hard parts of dows, is like you have to reach quorum or you should be trying to reach quorum. And that can be tricky sometimes. The gardens Dow is different. It says, well, the amount of attention that you need on a vote should be proportional to how much money that vote is requesting.
00:45:05.946 - 00:46:05.810, Speaker A: So if it's a small proposal that doesn't need a lot of money, then maybe only 5% of the users need to vote for it. Allowing people to, if there's a lot of competing proposals, you kind of have to choose which ones you want. But other than that, your vote grows over time. And not everybody has to know. And it's almost like as long as no one objects to what you're doing, it's like you can just come in and take money for something that's bright id related that you're building. So that's what we encourage people to do is just to come up with their own ideas of what they want, then go to brightdow and collect the tokens that they need to fund it. And we have some guidelines on how to create a proposal in forum brightid.org.
00:46:05.810 - 00:46:37.226, Speaker A: But yeah, I think it's Dow. Brightid.org will take you right to our gardens dow we gave away some bright tokens at the beginning as part of our bright fair drop is what we called. So a lot of gitcoin users got those. I think that was our biggest single airdrop recipient was gitcoin participants. And it wasn't for people that donated to bright id. It's for people that used gitcoin and donated to anything.
00:46:37.226 - 00:47:07.430, Speaker A: They got a share of bright tokens. And so you have bright tokens. A lot of our community friends have bright tokens and they've probably never used them. Voting and proposals. You can come check out and see what's up for a vote, check out the forum, see what people are talking about. But yeah, it's a pretty open forum. Pretty open.
00:47:07.430 - 00:47:08.950, Speaker A: Dow, right?
00:47:09.020 - 00:47:37.390, Speaker B: Very cool. So go to Dow. Breadid.org basically is the TLDR to get involved in, you know, as a project that's eating your vegetables around, decentralization and like, I just think that it makes total sense for bread id to become a Dow one day. And I'm realizing we integrated with each other. Gitcoin grants round six, which was like two, two and a half years ago. And since then Gitcoin has become a Dow and bread id has become a Dow or Gitcoin grants has become a Dow.
00:47:37.390 - 00:47:52.000, Speaker B: And so actually when I say we, I got to stop doing that because I'm disaffiliating from Gitcoin Dow right now. And the decentralization of not relying on the founder anymore is like a feature, not a bug. So it's just been cool to kind of grow up together a little bit.
00:47:53.330 - 00:48:23.566, Speaker A: Yeah. So the DAo is an interesting evolution. I didn't think we needed a Dow, but the community wanted one. And it's kind of cool because it wasn't my idea. I did some work towards helping it along and I'm happy to see that it launched and I'm happy to see that people are paying each other in bright token to do stuff related to bright id. And I don't have to be the boss of everything. And I'm sure you can relate to that.
00:48:23.566 - 00:48:36.314, Speaker A: It's nice to have that. Our Dow is probably like 1% of the size of gitcoin Dow. But it's still cool to have a community dow.
00:48:36.442 - 00:49:17.710, Speaker B: Yeah, it's not size. It's the impact that you're having that matters. Well, I guess I'd love to talk a little bit about Dow to dow relationships, which I feel like will be. It just seems obvious to me if you look at biomimicry, you had single cellular life and then you had multicellular life that kind of evolved. And I see that same thing with dows where we've got this kind of like primordial soup which these dows have emerged, and gitcoin and bread id have been sort of friend dows for a little while. And Gitcoin Dow recently launched Gitcoin Passport, which is like the decentralized version of its trust bonus tool. And you can use your bread id in that along with a couple of other civil resistance tools.
00:49:17.710 - 00:49:56.140, Speaker B: Is there anything that we can glean about future Dow to Dow relationships from this? I could imagine that the Gitcoin Dow fraud defense team could be using aura to give fraud defense back to bright id and vice versa. The traversal of that data back and forth, there's obviously a traversal of information and ideas because we're socially connected and talking about civil resistant dows. And then there's kind of like the data back and forth between the two systems. But is there anything else to say about the Dow to Dow relationship there that we can extrapolate between the two, or what do you think?
00:49:56.590 - 00:51:24.630, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that we're already seeing the beginnings of Interdao trust where we say, okay, you are showing me a proof that you were an active member of Gitcoin Dow. And so maybe you can start out with a big reputation boost when you join Brightdow or something like that. So I think that's an interesting way for daos to work together. I mean, we're also seeing kind of the beginnings of dows being able to kind of vote with each other. So you could do something like where you could say, okay, you can vote with bright tokens or you could vote with Gitcoin tokens to make decision. So that's interesting. Another thing that I think that we can do with Bright ID to help dows is we can help to avoid kind of dow attention overload and Dow apathy, I think that's one of the things that we noticed, at least with our launch of Brightdow, is we tried to cast a wide net when we were giving out our governance token.
00:51:24.630 - 00:52:15.346, Speaker A: We gave a bunch to anyone who could just show that they were a unique person because we thought, okay, at least some of that's going to stick. At least some of those people are going to stay around. And that was true and it worked out. But the majority of those people are just like, oh, what's this? Free money, okay, and sell. That's kind of just what happens. But it would be better if without giving away, you could find a cheaper way to settle in on who your core people are going to be. So going back to Unitap, which I showed earlier, one of the things that we want to do is once that list starts to become long, of all the tokens you can collect, we want to limit unique people to, let's say five tokens.
00:52:15.346 - 00:53:20.410, Speaker A: So let's say that we have a category there that says Dow governance tokens. You can get some free Dow governance tokens, and here are the 100 dows that are offering some free governance tokens for their dow. But you only get to pick three of them, three from this list. And so it forces you to go through and either pick the ones that are the most valuable, but then over time that will kind of balance out. So at some point it becomes which ones are you really interested in? You don't want to get a token and then just immediately sell it. If you could instead get a token that you're actually going to keep and use, it would be just more efficient for you to pick the ones that you're actually going to use. So by doing that, we can allow dows, rather than just, I guess, to be smarter about how they give away their governance tokens, like giveaway rounds, and actually attract users that are going to be using those tokens.
00:53:20.410 - 00:54:10.570, Speaker A: So that's one thing that we hope to do. And then, like I said, it goes along with the passport where you can say, here's my certification that says that I've been a good actor in this dow, and maybe that carries some weight in this other, um, I think that depop passport was A-I-I definitely see a future for that. I guess it started out as an experiment, but I hope it stays around because I think it's really cool and I hope we can use it for that sort of thing to hold like Dow certifications. So I don't know, maybe we should. What's your vision for the depop, like in just a few sentences?
00:54:11.070 - 00:54:54.700, Speaker B: So depop for the listeners stands for decentralized proof of personhood passport, which we're now just calling Gitcoin passport because it rolls off the tongue a little bit more. Yeah, I think that we just basically wanted to take the civil resistance on gitcoin and allow people to consume it from across the ecosystem in their dapps. And we kind of look at ourselves as an aggregator of decentralized society credentials. So basically this world in which there's all this different data out there, we can aggregate it into one passport, which are like stamps, and bright id is one of the stamps in that passport, and then give more civil resistance out to the.
00:54:56.750 - 00:54:57.018, Speaker A: Know.
00:54:57.024 - 00:55:36.018, Speaker B: I guess I look at y'all as this web of trust tool and us as an aggregator. And I keep on saying us, but I've just disaffiliated from Gitcoin Dow. I got to get out of the habit of that. But yeah, so that's the idea with Gitcoin passport and I'm just wondering how we can be good ecosystem partners to each other. We don't have to have this conversation on the podcast, by the way. We can do it privately if you want, but I just want to make sure that we're good partners to each other and also that we're kind of like building towards the same vision of civil resistance together. So what is a world in which bright idea is maximally successful look like? Paint me a picture of all the democratic dows that will be out there and quadratic funding and quadratic voting.
00:55:36.018 - 00:55:43.594, Speaker B: That's civil resistance. What's the world in which you all are maximally successful look like? And how can we be good supporters of that?
00:55:43.792 - 00:57:27.078, Speaker A: Yeah, so to me the maximally successful bright id world looks like we have the same level of security, still the best level of security that we can so one account per person, that it's good enough that we have tools like aura that ensure that it's good enough that you can support things like a true Ubi and then have it be so that it's just kind of like just part of the social fabric that everybody gets one. Right now it's kind of like, oh, who do I know that already uses bright id? And I've got to figure out this thing and I've got to go to this weird connection party thing. But in the future, when Bright id is maximally successful, it's like you'll grow up with bright id. It's just completely natural. It's like your parents and your close friends and relatives will be the ones you naturally connect to. And it's not like you have to go looking for someone and you'll just get verified that way. Why wouldn't you use bright? If you could know that your users were unique humans? Why wouldn't you want to know that? It's like right now it's like, well, what realm of apps are going to have the greatest need for bright id? And there's certain types where we've seen like bright id is so crucial to their operation that they need something like that, otherwise it's going to fail.
00:57:27.078 - 00:58:38.162, Speaker A: But in the future it'll just be like, well, this isn't crucial to our operation, but sure, why not? We want to know how many unique users we have that's useful information. And so it's like every app will just want to use it just to have that extra, I guess, assurance that their users are unique. And then as far as dows, so it's interesting because we have to be careful. So if you look at the DSOC paper that came out a couple of months ago and also I wrote a post about plutocracy like a little bit before that. But we have to be careful because just knowing that someone's a unique person doesn't completely solve the collusion problem. Because talking about dows, let's say that we have Dow A and Dow B and they're giving away governance tokens to whoever wants them. I collect tokens from Dow A and Dow B.
00:58:38.162 - 00:59:15.930, Speaker A: I don't care about Dow A, but I do care about Dow B and you are vice versa. So we just do a swap. Now I have two dow a tokens and you have two dow b tokens. And now we each get double the votes that we should just because we got all these free tokens that we don't really care about. And so we trade them, sell them to people who do care and we're not supposed to and stuff like that. So that's where the soul bound thing comes in. Because you want to make sure that these things that should be kept one per person are not being traded.
00:59:15.930 - 01:00:07.114, Speaker A: And also that you have the right amount of attention because you could also, I mean if you tried to do like a sole bound token by just having it bound to an Ethereum address or something like that, you can just sell the private key. So just making it non transferable doesn't solve it. What we did with bright id was we actually, earlier this year we launched a soul bound token and gave away 10,000 nfts that are soul bound. And in bright iD, what soul bound means is very simply that you can rescue it. It's bound to your bright id in a way that you can rescue it to another Ethereum address. So let's say that you have your soul bound nft in one ethereum address and then you lose everything. You lose access to all your Ethereum addresses.
01:00:07.114 - 01:00:46.842, Speaker A: Maybe someone stole it, or maybe you just lost access. Maybe you also lost access to your bright id. You can socially recover your bright id. And then those tokens, those sole bound tokens have a rescue operation. And so if you relink your bright id to a new Ethereum address, it will teleport that token from your old Ethereum address that you no longer have access to or got stolen or whatever into the new one. As long as you can get that bright id back, you can get that token back. That makes it soul bound because now it's bound to you as a soul, not to an ethereum address.
01:00:46.842 - 01:01:22.120, Speaker A: That also makes it not resellable because those nfts that we gave away are worth zero. And the way that I can prove they're worth zero is I can sell it to you and then I can take it back because it's bound to my soul and not yours. And so it automatically has a value of zero. So you can't sell these things. So anyways, I think that that's really cool. That paper is really interesting. I think the potential of soul bound tokens is really interesting and helps with some of these governance problems.
01:01:22.890 - 01:01:46.720, Speaker B: Yeah, very cool. I just think that the future is so bright, pun intended for civil resistance and thankful to you for being an early pioneer in this space. It's so neat to see the line of bread id growing over time and its relationship with gitcoin growing over time. So it's been great. Is there anything I didn't ask you that you want to tell us about?
01:01:47.410 - 01:02:15.506, Speaker A: No, I managed to cram in everything that I could possibly think of. So I appreciate that. But yeah, like you said, with the collaboration of Gitcoin and Bright ID, I see lots of potential there because it's like we're both trying to figure out ways to fund public goods and we're both trying to figure out how to get public goods out to people. So I see us collaborating for a long time, likewise.
01:02:15.538 - 01:02:59.186, Speaker B: And I hope to see the early success of gitcoin and bright id and other civil resistance tools to be sort of a sign that you can build non speculative apps and that I hope to see more democratic tools, more public goods funding tools in the next market cycle be built. And that's kind of the dream for me. This is my list of what civil resistance enables. And I just want to end by saying it because I just want to articulate how great it would be for the ecosystem if we can solve civil resistance. So quadratic voting, quadratic funding, measuring the genie coefficients of ecosystems. Ubi. One person, one vote dows.
01:02:59.186 - 01:03:09.080, Speaker B: So not one token, one vote dows. One person will vote dows and then civil resistance airdrops is my list. So anything to add to that or any pushback on that list?
01:03:10.410 - 01:03:13.126, Speaker A: No. Amen. It's all good stuff.
01:03:13.308 - 01:03:19.818, Speaker B: Amen. All right, well, thanks so much for being on the green pill pod, Adam. Really appreciate it and see you around the Internet.
01:03:19.954 - 01:03:21.200, Speaker A: All right. Thank you.
