00:00:23.390 - 00:01:23.034, Speaker A: Hi everyone, this is Defi dad and this is another bankless tutorial. Today I'm going to walk you through how to become a liquidity provider on curve and then ultimately earn the curve governance token. I'm going to first walk you through how I think about where to lend my assets and then ultimately how that leads me to yearn finance as a yield bouncer, potentially, but then how that ultimately leads me to the curve y pool. And that's where we end up with what's properly labeled yield farming. I'm earning multiple forms of yield as a lender, a market maker, and also as someone who's being rewarded with the curve governance token that was recently launched. So this is a tutorial that is going to end up costing me a lot of gas. In light of the gas prices on ethereum, I'm probably going to spend about $75 of gas by the time this is over or more.
00:01:23.034 - 00:02:17.034, Speaker A: So that means I need a position that is large enough to justify spending that to still earn a profit. And so we'll end the tutorial with me actually staking my liquidity provider token that I receive for being a liquidity provider in a curve pool. I'll show you how I'm staking that in the new curve Dao, and that's where I'm going to actually stake the YLP token and I'm going to earn the CRV, or curve governance token, which is estimated to have an annualized percentage yield of 143%. So I am needing a position that justifies me spending about $75 on gas in order to earn a return that is greater than $75 in transaction fees. And based on the size of my position, I can then use this number.
00:02:17.072 - 00:02:19.338, Speaker B: To figure out how much of a.
00:02:19.344 - 00:03:07.442, Speaker A: Profit am I actually expecting out of this. Also understanding that this number is going to change day to day with the fluctuations in the price of this new curve token. Curve is very new, it's very illiquid, there is not much supply of it. So the price is in price discovery, and this makes it really unpredictable at this point. But I'm just going to use this number because we are a few days in and at this point the curve token that I earn to me is icing on the cake. And so I just need to personally be able to overcome the cost of the gas that I'm going to spend. So last week I used the Dharma wallet, it's a self custody ethereum wallet, to trade for free in terms of not paying gas fees.
00:03:07.442 - 00:04:07.958, Speaker A: With uniswap this week I'm going to show how I'm putting those assets to work, earning lending interest. To get started, I'm going to combine a number of tutorials that I've done previously. So I'll try to link in the show notes, some of those recommended tutorials if you want to go deeper into the detail. But for now, let's just start with DeFi score. So this is at app Defyscore IO, and you'll notice that this is a place where I can compare what are the available lending rates according to the assets and the different DeFi lending platforms. So I keep it really simple and I think about what are the assets that are in my wallet? And one of the more obvious ones would be DAi. When I have previously, let's say, deposited fiat into my Dharma wallet, that wallet converts it to Dai.
00:04:07.958 - 00:04:40.262, Speaker A: So now I've got digital dollars that are decentralized and backed by collateral that's stored in maker. So long story short, if I have Dai, I can look here then to see what are the different available rates for that DAi. And what I quickly notice is that the rates are very different across these platforms. It's 8.59% on nuo, it's 4.27% on DYDX, 3.3% on compound, 1.27%
00:04:40.262 - 00:05:40.006, Speaker A: on ave list goes on. And these rates change daily. These rates are changing actually more than just daily. But if you check them daily, you'll notice that tomorrow compound could be offering 10% because their pool is more utilized and there's more people borrowing that die and hence they're incentivizing me to lend my DAi. So when I look at a platform like this, it quickly signals to me that I'm probably going to struggle to pick what is the highest rate continuously day to day. And I don't have the ability to move my die across these different lending platforms on a day to day basis because just the gas alone would end up destroying any hope of ever making a profit. So the alternative to this is depending on which of these platforms I'm willing to have exposure to, according to the defi score, or according to maybe my own experience.
00:05:40.006 - 00:06:50.350, Speaker A: Having used these, I then came to the conclusion that I would like to spread my dai across these different pools. I'd like to use a yield bouncing strategy. Now that I've decided that I want to spread my assets across different lending pools to maximize my lending interest for Dai, I'm going to go to urine finance. Urine finance is a protocol that's become much more popular, but it's been around since January February this year, and it's normally holding anywhere over like 500 million in total value locked. And it also became very popular because they issued a governance token called wifi. So with that information, if I go to yearn finance and I click on earn, this is the utility that made yearn finance popular in the first place. What I can do here is I can deposit any of these different tokens and I can maximize my interest rate lending them, because what yearn is doing is it's moving my money to whichever of the pools has the highest rate.
00:06:50.350 - 00:07:44.442, Speaker A: And it's deploying a strategy to basically try to get my money into the pool where it's going to earn the most, depending on the utilization rates of those pools, depending on what money is moving in and out of those pools. It's a lot of magic that happens under the hood and it saves me time and it saves me a lot of money to replicate what happens here, I would spend so much money on gas and I would never actually make a profit. So if we look at Dai here, this is where I could choose to earn or deposit my dai. And if I choose to use this application, they'll ask me to approve spending my die and then it'll actually deposit it. So it'll be two transactions, and then I'm effectively earning 4.28%. And so anyways, this is another route. And this is different than me using these individual lending pools.
00:07:44.442 - 00:08:31.082, Speaker A: This is more of a strategy to take my die and to push it to these different pools to maximize my lending interest. Because 8.59% might be the lending rate today for nuo, it could be much lower tomorrow. It matters over time that I'm able to average a higher lending interest rate on my dai. However, if I know that I'm going to use dai and I know that I'm willing to lend across multiple pools, I have a third option is I could hop over to curve. So that's curve Phi, and then I'm going to click on the y pool. So once I get to curve Phi iron, I want to click on deposit.
00:08:31.082 - 00:09:17.898, Speaker A: This is where I can become a liquidity provider and I can deposit my dai. Now what's special about the curve y pool is that I'm able to deposit my dai or any of these other stable coins. If I were to have those in my wallet and I'm becoming a liquidity provider and I'm earning a percentage of this fee. So every time someone trades between these four stable coins, they pay a fee of 0.4%. And then depending on how much of the pool I own, which currently this pool has almost 600 million in it. If I were to own, let's say, one of one of 1%, I would earn one of one of 1% of the 0.4% fee.
00:09:17.898 - 00:10:09.230, Speaker A: So the idea is that I'm earning these trading fees as people are utilizing this valuable service to swap between stablecoins. However, I'm also earning the lending interest because curve, or I'm sorry, the yearn finance team. This protocol is actually powering what's happening in the background here. These tokens are being lent across different pools, and it's maximizing my ability to earn interest across all of the different pools we showed here earlier. So let's just quickly review those puzzle pieces. Curve is a stablecoin swap, or a pool where I can trade between DAi, USDC, tether and true USD, and I would go to buy and sell if I wanted to do that. But I am not.
00:10:09.230 - 00:11:07.140, Speaker A: I am someone who wants to earn the fees, and I'm willing to put my stable coins into this pool and let people trade between them while those tokens are being lent. The urine finance protocol is actually taking my stable coins, and it's maximizing the lending interest by bouncing them between these different pools, which are all different DeFi applications or liquidity pools. So if I've made up my mind that I'm going to use the curve y pool to lend and become a market maker, I also have the ability to earn this curve token. And this is the new governance token from curve. So now I'm earning three different forms of yield. And this is technically why you would label this as yield farming. I'm earning multiple forms of yield for lending liquidity, and these are programs that are essentially stacked up on top of one another.
00:11:07.140 - 00:12:14.266, Speaker A: So instead of using the curve interface, I'm going to choose to use zapper. It's just a prettier, easier dashboard for me to use to track all of my deFi transactions in the dashboard, but to also use the invest tab, where I have all of these different zaps that allow me to participate as a liquidity provider across protocols like curve synthetix, urine finance balancer, and Uniswap. So once I find the Y curve pool, I can click add liquidity. And if I didn't have stablecoins, one of the really powerful things about curve is that I could actually just zap in some ether. But in this case, I'm going to deposit die, which I already have. So let's put in 300 die, and then you can see I'll end up with 285 y curve tokens. That is because these LP tokens are worth the trading fees, plus the lending interest, plus the original amount that I put in.
00:12:14.266 - 00:12:59.962, Speaker A: And so that's why I end up with less of these more valuable tokens. I also want to choose my slippage tolerance for less liquid pools. I would be willing to maybe take on two to 3% slippage, but this is a much more liquid pool in DFI, so I'm going to mark it down to 1%. Otherwise zapper will let me know if there is a chance that there will be greater slippage than 1%. And the last thing I do is choose my gas setting, which I can figure out by going to the ETh gas station. So the ETH gas station tells me the recommended gas prices according to whether I want a transaction to go through in less than two minutes, five minutes or 30 minutes. This means that I need my gas price to be greater than 71.
00:12:59.962 - 00:13:43.762, Speaker A: If it's greater than 71 guay. I'm pretty much assured that this transaction will go through. If it's less and gas prices continue to go up, I'll have to wait for the transaction to confirm at a later date when gas prices fall or I'll have to send a dummy transaction to unstick it. The reason I use this in all my videos is because this helps me to save on transaction fees. So if we go back to zapper, you can see that these are recommended gas settings, but I still get to choose through metamask in the end. So if I choose 77 as the standard gas setting, I can then click confirm. Now this is where I would give permission to spend my die.
00:13:43.762 - 00:14:37.926, Speaker A: So die is an ERC 20 token. I have to give permission for Zapperfi to spend it to enable me to actually deposit into the Y curve pool so I can click edit, look at advanced and I see the gas prices at 77 guay. Let's go back to the Eth gas station and let's hit refresh. The reason I do this is that gas prices change constantly according to how much network demand there is. I'm better off doing this and then setting the gas price and confirming it as soon as possible so that the gas prices don't rise on me before I set my gas price. So I'm going to set it somewhere between these two. I tend to put it above the 30 minutes mark to make sure it goes through, but below this just to save on ETH transaction fees.
00:14:37.926 - 00:14:41.050, Speaker A: So I'll probably put it at about 75 gwe.
00:14:43.250 - 00:14:43.902, Speaker B: All right?
00:14:43.956 - 00:15:32.890, Speaker A: So I'll choose advanced, mark it down to 75. So hit save, and I click my full transaction details. This is where I choose what permission I'm giving in terms of how much of my diet I'm willing to let zapper spend. Now, if I choose unlimited, it makes it really convenient when I come back to Zapdai in the future into different zaps on zapperfi. But it also is a risk, because if somehow someone gains malicious control of those smart contracts, they have unlimited permission to spend die in my wallet. So I tend to go the more conservative route and put in exactly how much I'm going to spend and then I can just hit save. All right, so we're ready to confirm this, first of two transactions.
00:15:32.890 - 00:16:18.202, Speaker A: And so now this is the second transaction. This is where I actually zap in my money. And this is why I was mentioning earlier that I think about the size of my position here. In order to participate in curve, I'm going to spend about $67 according to the gas price. And even if I lower the gas price to 75 guay, I end up just saving a few dollars. But given the size of my position, I should be earning more profit to overcome the 65 gwe in terms of gas fees. This is just another reminder of why we need eth two and why I always support gitcoin grants for eth two teams like prismatic Labs and Sigma prime and many others.
00:16:18.202 - 00:16:28.510, Speaker A: So once this goes through, I'll be a liquidity provider in the curve y pool, and then I'll show how I'm staking my LP token to earn the curve governance token.
00:16:32.760 - 00:17:25.756, Speaker B: Okay, so I'm back and my transaction's gone through. So you can now see that I have a share of the pool, which means that I have a share of DAi, USDC, tether and true USD. And it's split up according to the ratios in the pool. And you can see that I've got about $313. So if I want to hop over to where I can stake my curve LP token, I want to click on Dow and then I'll click on the minter. And then this takes me to a page that's mintergages. So this is where I can actually stake the token or the IOU that was given to me for becoming a curve y pool LP.
00:17:25.756 - 00:18:13.680, Speaker B: So again, it's curve because that's the protocol. Y refers to which stablecoin pool and LP is liquidity provider. So that's my LP token. And if I scroll down a bit here is the y liquidity gauge a gauge is just a word that they're using to describe where I can stake my YLP token. So there's a gauge for the binance USD pool, there's a gauge for the compound liquidity pool in curve. There's lots and lots of pools in curve. There's an SUSD curve pool, there's a pax pool, there's a ren pool, there's an SBTC pool, but I'm going to use the one that I just added money to, which is the Y liquidity pool.
00:18:13.680 - 00:19:05.824, Speaker B: And it's calculating about 136% APY according to the amount of CRv curve governance token that I'm going to receive at whatever the price of curve is today, which is around $5. So all I need to do then is just use this little slider to decide how much I'm going to stake. The more that I stake, the more curve CRV token that I earn. So I'm just going to stake all of my YLP token here and we'll click deposit. So the first thing I have to do is give permission for curve to spend my Ydai Yusdc Yusdt and Yt USD. This is actually referring to the y. Here we go.
00:19:05.824 - 00:19:35.676, Speaker B: Where did that go? The YLP token. So I'm going to give permission to spend that and I'm going to choose my gas price. So I'm checking the ethgastation info and I'm going to make sure that the gas price is around 78 guay and then I'm going to choose the permission here. Actually, I'll keep it at this. It's specifying exactly the amount of LP token that I'm going to spend so.
00:19:35.698 - 00:19:38.030, Speaker A: I don't have to worry about that unlimited spend.
00:19:39.840 - 00:19:55.344, Speaker B: And then I can hit confirm. Then the second transaction is where I actually stake or deposit my YLP token. So you'll notice that the gas price.
00:19:55.382 - 00:19:57.004, Speaker A: Is currently 80 gwe.
00:19:57.132 - 00:20:40.210, Speaker B: If I check the ethgastation info, I think this will go through if I put it down to 77 guay. And so that saved me just a little bit of gas. I'm still paying quite a bit, but relative to the prices last week, this is not too bad. So I hit confirm. All right, I'm back a few minutes later and my transaction has gone through. So now I am staked in the curve dow, which means that I'm now earning the CRV or curve governance token. And I can see that here under the Y liquidity gauge that I have 298.33
00:20:40.210 - 00:21:28.530, Speaker B: y curve tokens that are staked and if I ever want to withdraw this, I can just go here and again use this slider and I can withdraw that. But what will show up here over the coming hours and days is I'll see my claimable curve. So I'm earning crv, and as it becomes available, it'll let me claim it. Claiming it means that I'm basically withdrawing my reward. That is the curve governance token. Now, because of high gas prices, I'm probably going to wait to do this till I have a more sizable amount of curve that's worth withdrawing and paying gas for. But that's how it works, and that's how easy it is for me to withdraw that whenever I want.
00:21:28.530 - 00:22:37.194, Speaker B: Another thing worth noting is that if I'm in multiple curve pools, so let's pretend that I have liquidity in the curve SBTC pool. I would then have multiple pools earning curve, and I can claim all of that curve across multiple pools by using this button. And then lastly, up above, you can see a chart that shows me where all of my liquidity is. So if I had liquidity in the SBTC pool, it would show this as a pie chart showing what's in the Y pool versus the SBTC pool. Here's a quick recap of all the risks that I'm accepting in using the curve pool to become a liquidity provider, and then ultimately earn the curve governance token. So first, by being in the Y pool, I am using urine finance, and it's moving my money across these different pools that are different defi applications and have their own smart contracts. So that comes with its own risk.
00:22:37.194 - 00:23:12.458, Speaker B: Each one of these applications has its own smart contract risk. And then, so I'm essentially stacking that risk by moving my tokens across these different pools. So if we go to yearn, you can see here that yearn is moving my money across compound DydX Ave. And that's it. Actually, it used to move it into fulcrum by BZX and DDEx. It's no longer moving it into those pools. There's a chance that it could be moving money into more pools in the future.
00:23:12.458 - 00:23:53.666, Speaker B: So I've got exposure to compound DyDX and Ave smart contracts, and then there's exposure to the curve smart contracts. So just by using the curve y pool, that's additional smart contract risk to consider. It is worth noting curve smart contracts were audited by trail of bits. You can check out the audit there. And then lastly, I used Zapper earlier. So by using Zapper, that's another avenue to go down in terms of smart contract risk, they do shuttle me from my money to having it into this liquidity pool. So once I'm in curve, I'm no longer exposed to zapper.
00:23:53.666 - 00:25:00.746, Speaker B: But initially, when I zap my money into the curve pool, I am again putting my funds at risk in terms of any sort of smart contract failure that could happen on the Zapperfi side. The next consideration is just that I'm using a newer application built on curve. So these liquidity gauges are part of the Dow curve phi. And so this is all rather new and just I consider the fact that there could be a bug in these smart contracts, and the longer this exists, the better, the more tested it is, and the safer I will feel with my funds in curve. Next up is the risk of just a liquidity crunch. If everyone were to withdraw their dai from this pool, or if someone were to do a very large swap and to drain the pool of dye. If I was wanting or expecting or needing that dye, I now have a share of a pool that doesn't have that dai in it.
00:25:00.746 - 00:25:35.714, Speaker B: Despite the incentivization mechanisms behind curve's liquidity pool, the next risk to consider is just using a stablecoin. So I've got exposure to all four of these stablecoins. A stablecoin peg could fail, and if that were to fail, that would not be good for the liquidity that I'm holding. So that's all I've got for you today. I hope you find this helpful. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us in the bankless discord.
