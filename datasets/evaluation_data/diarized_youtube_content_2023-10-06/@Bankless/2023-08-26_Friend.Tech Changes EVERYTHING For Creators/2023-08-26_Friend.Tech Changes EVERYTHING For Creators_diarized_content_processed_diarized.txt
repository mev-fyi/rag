00:00:00.090 - 00:00:15.982, Speaker A: Bay's banks. Disclosure. Gracie Hardy, Grayson Allen what do they all have in common? They're on Frontech playing Crypto's hottest social media Ponzi game. And what do they get out of this? Well, Disclosure made a cool $10,000. Bayes Banks, 81,000. Even Y Combinator CEO Gary Tan has made $16,000 so far. And this is just for signing up.
00:00:15.982 - 00:00:37.750, Speaker A: Cunning fans have made off in a big way, too, with the top collecting fan making $72,000, you could trade shares now called keys, for legal reason of anybody on the app. The shareholders speculate, and the owners profit off trading fees. If you have a big following, this seems like a no brainer. So, what's the catch? Well, crypto is still not that easy to use right now. Funding an account on a centralized exchange, withdrawing to a wallet, bridging to a L2. There are a lot of tricky steps involved, and you can get screwed if you don't know what you're doing. But the chain works.
00:00:37.750 - 00:00:56.780, Speaker A: The base L2, built on ethereum, has taken it like a champ 1.7 million transactions, over $65 million of inflows, and still maintaining low gas fees and stability. We love that. So, what do you think? Is this game changing social tech? Is this a dystopian nightmare of a financial centralized social credit? Or maybe it's just a cool use case of promising technology. Are you getting involved, or are you staying far away from this one? Let me know in the comments and subscribe for more.
