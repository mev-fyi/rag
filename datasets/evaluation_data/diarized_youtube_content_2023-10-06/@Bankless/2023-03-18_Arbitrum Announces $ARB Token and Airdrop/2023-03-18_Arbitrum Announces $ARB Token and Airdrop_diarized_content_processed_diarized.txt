Eleven point something something percent airdropped to users of Arbitrum. One point something percent airdropped to Dows on Arbitrum to give to their communities.

And then investors and the team get something like 45% of total tokens. How do you like that? Good distribution. What do you think? I went into the small brands discord and I was like, Yo, ask for their gut takes. And everyone was very, very excited. And so the sentiment is good. I think the community is accepting this.
