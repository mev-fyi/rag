00:00:00.090 - 00:00:06.394, Speaker B: I want to start to get into some more specific things about the current state of DeFi. What parts of DeFi are preventing the pie from getting a lot larger?
00:00:06.442 - 00:00:37.958, Speaker A: The central thing that we're working on right now at vault directly at the moment is this liquidity management system where people may be familiar with the Dai savings rate. So there's a version where people can take their DAi stablecoin and lock it to get yield. It used to be some yield on it. Now it's been one basis point for a long time. And the idea that a stablecoin could be natively yield bearing we initially created vault is the idea of the inflation resistant stablecoin and a hard target on that us consumer price index inflation peg. But what we've realized, of course, is that in some market conditions, the risk that's needed to achieve a hard target may be unacceptable. It's a magic number and we need to get rid of it.
00:00:37.958 - 00:00:47.540, Speaker A: The goal of the system is still to preserve user value, and I'll create a marketplace where that's possible. But it's just that sometimes it's not up to me to decide that eight and a half percent interest is the right amount at the right risk level.
