00:00:00.090 - 00:00:15.722, Speaker A: You know, crypto represents just 0.3% of the average household's net worth. 0.3%. That's it. My house is a little different than that. Imagine your household is a little different. Bankless nation.
00:00:15.722 - 00:00:19.550, Speaker A: Happy fourth and final week of May. David. What time is it?
00:00:19.620 - 00:00:35.190, Speaker B: Oh, Ryan. It's the Friday bankless weekly rollup time where we cover the entire week in crypto, which it's always an ambitious endeavor, yet we persevere nonetheless. As we go into this build market that we are going into, we're going to talk about all the shenanigans that went down in the last seven days.
00:00:35.260 - 00:00:45.274, Speaker A: I like that, man. It's not the bear market, it's the build market. Right. And that's our mantra, is build the dip. You're not going to buy the dip. Well, you should do that, too. But first, let's build our way out of this thing, and that's what we're doing.
00:00:45.274 - 00:00:52.634, Speaker A: David, it's good to see you back, man, but this is our last recording from your studio apartment in Diego, right?
00:00:52.672 - 00:01:09.602, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. This is going to be the last time you're going to see this background. I'm going to be kind of figuring it out for the next three weeks because my stuff is going to take time to get to Brooklyn, but in three weeks time, there's going to be a nice, shiny brick apartment in Brooklyn somewhere. So new background, new background. My background changes. Ryan's never changes.
00:01:09.656 - 00:01:24.658, Speaker A: Mine stays the same, and it will be here for the next five years of tankless. All right, well, what are we getting into this week? Topics of the week. Number one, GameStop is releasing a wallet. That's a big deal for us on our side. Well, they're going to take a peek at that. What else we covering, David?
00:01:24.754 - 00:01:39.254, Speaker B: We got Luna relaunching. We got Luna round two. We unironically now have Luna classic and new Luna. So that is getting spun up under new management. Doe Kwan's troubles continues. We're going to update you on that. Also, optimism.
00:01:39.254 - 00:01:47.486, Speaker B: Token updates, warning it's good for holders. And then, of course, Ryan, you want to take this one? Defi going to court. What's going on here?
00:01:47.588 - 00:02:09.634, Speaker A: Yeah, Defi. It's a court case that we covered a while ago. Frivolous lawsuit, someone taking the pool together, protocol to court. But the community is fighting back. And now there's a way to mint your protest. I've minted mine. We'll talk about poolies and what we're trying to do in the defi community to get some funds to guard against that frivolous lawsuit.
00:02:09.634 - 00:02:18.646, Speaker A: Last thing, David. This feels like a bear market. But that's the thing with crypto. There's always a bull market somewhere. Where's the bull market this week?
00:02:18.748 - 00:02:31.818, Speaker B: The ENS numbers right now are absolutely insane. So we got the April and may numbers from the ENS dow about all the ENS metrics. So we're going to go and cover all of those because ENS is in a bull market at the moment, guys.
00:02:31.904 - 00:02:45.802, Speaker A: Every Friday, this comes at you. So if you're on YouTube, make sure you like and subscribe right now. Just do that right now. If you're listening to this podcast on Apple or Spotify, leave us a five star review, okay? That's how we pump this thing to the top of the charts.
00:02:45.946 - 00:02:59.250, Speaker B: How we get out of the bear review. More people listen to bankless, more people buy the dip, more people build the dip, and all of a sudden, we have a bull market on our hands. So, five star reviews strongly correlates to bull markets. Happens every time. Works like a charm.
00:02:59.330 - 00:03:17.366, Speaker A: There you go. Review the dip as well. Subscribe, do the dip. We also got something to tell you from our friends at Alchemyx. Alchemyx sponsored this message. They wanted us to tell you about their fantastic protocol. Dude, this is the closest thing to financial magic I've seen, because this kind of thing is not available in traditional finance.
00:03:17.366 - 00:03:25.386, Speaker A: But let me tell you how this works. So the merge is coming, we're in a bear market. But who wants to sell their ETH at these prices in the 1000 range?
00:03:25.418 - 00:03:26.334, Speaker B: Like, who wants to do that?
00:03:26.372 - 00:03:28.798, Speaker A: I don't want to do that. But maybe you need some money.
00:03:28.804 - 00:03:30.382, Speaker B: 1800, not 8800.
00:03:30.436 - 00:03:56.600, Speaker A: Okay. Thousands range. So here's what you can do with Alchemyx. You could take your eth, you could put it in Alchemyx, and you get your future yields paid to you up front. So like a lump sum payment, and you could do whatever you want with the yield. So maybe you need some student loans to pay back, some car loans to pay back, but you just want to treat yourself, go, I don't know, fancy your tax bill. Yeah, treat yourself to paying off that tax bill.
00:03:56.600 - 00:04:15.646, Speaker A: It's a way you could do just those yields for after a long while, you eventually get your ETH back. Okay? And we call this the never sell plan. In fact, David, you wrote an article about this back in the day. Really cool protocol. And it's not eth. You could do this with other assets as well. Yeah.
00:04:15.668 - 00:04:36.994, Speaker B: You can also put dai in and dai. Well, Alchemyx will go out and yield farm your dai in Defi, and then it'll pay you your interest payments upfront. And all you got to do is sit on your hands and wait for that loan to be paid back. It does take some time, but the beautiful thing is you can't get liquidated because that's how the protocol works. There is no leverage here. You are just taking future yield payments upfront. So there is a link in the show notes to get started.
00:04:36.994 - 00:04:48.920, Speaker B: Bankless cc slash alchemy. It's a capital a at the start if you want to dive into the alchemy. Also, they updated their tokenomics, so if you are an Alcx holder, they have a tokenomics upgrade you can take a peek at.
00:04:49.610 - 00:04:58.682, Speaker A: Very cool. All right, speaking of tokenomics, let's take a look at the bitcoin token economics. Bitcoin price, what's that telling us, David? I'm going to share my screen here.
00:04:58.736 - 00:05:13.838, Speaker B: Bitcoin price, it's down. It lost $700 in the last week. We started at $33,000. We had 29,400 ish. So overall, down 2% on the week. That's what a bear market looks like, just 2%.
00:05:13.924 - 00:05:19.300, Speaker A: That's like a good week in the bear market because ETH is down harder, right?
00:05:20.230 - 00:05:32.920, Speaker B: Yeah. Lost 7% in the last seven days. That's 1% a day for the mathwizzes out there. Started $2,000. We are currently at 1840 dipping the dipper. Dipper on this one.
00:05:36.970 - 00:05:38.738, Speaker A: Bitcoin ratio that's suffered.
00:05:38.754 - 00:05:47.706, Speaker B: Right. Also down bad. Down 6%. Yeah, my ETH bitcoin long position is not feeling good because I opened it right at the top, right over there.
00:05:47.728 - 00:05:48.426, Speaker A: Did you really?
00:05:48.528 - 00:05:58.318, Speaker B: Not the most recent spike. So I keep going a little bit to the right, like. Right. I can't really show you on the here. Yeah, well, it was at 0.7 something.
00:05:58.484 - 00:06:09.858, Speaker A: David, you got to stop betting on these ratios, my friend. Just go long on the asset you love. Do you remember? I'm not going to bring it up now. I'm going to bring it up. The Defi ETH ratio, that going.
00:06:09.944 - 00:06:16.580, Speaker B: Oh, God. Yeah, well, yeah, there's no more DPI left in me on that one.
00:06:17.190 - 00:06:33.194, Speaker A: The ratios will kill you in this market. But, yeah, people are more bullish bitcoin than they are ether in this particular week. That's kind of funny going into the merge, but is it sort of a flight to safety? Is everyone freaking out and like, hey, bitcoin is still the traditional safe asset. So we're going over.
00:06:33.232 - 00:06:58.702, Speaker B: There it is. Who the hell knows? The ETH ratio is inherently hard to trade on the short timeframes. I'm just bullish on the fundamentals. Flipping in Ether's favor with the merge in August, which is what was said by both Preston van Lewin and Justin Drake on our panel and permissionless merge in August time, where all of a sudden ether gets $30 million a day, increased net buy pressure. And so how can you not be bullish?
00:06:58.846 - 00:07:33.680, Speaker A: What probability do you give that merge in August? By the way? It's not just David and I saying this. Not David and I saying this. This is Preston Van Loon at permissionless last week and also Justin Drake saying that it was very likely that the merge would happen in August. I'm paraphrasing a little bit, but the stars are aligned. Also said there was a great deal incentive for this to happen before block fees increase. What's it called? What am I thinking of, David? Block fee increase, ice age. Ice age, yeah.
00:07:33.680 - 00:07:45.598, Speaker A: Difficulty bomb kicks in. So it feels like. I don't know. What percentage would you sign? I'm going to go with 80% probability that happens in August. What do you think?
00:07:45.604 - 00:08:01.054, Speaker B: Yeah, I was going to say like 90% by the end of September, just to include a couple of weeks of lead time being said, there needs to be no bugs discovered. So under a condition of no bugs discovered, we are like 90% likely there. We're going to be a post merge Ethereum by the end of September.
00:08:01.182 - 00:08:09.546, Speaker A: Agreed. That's going to be a big deal, but it's likely going to happen during a bear market, and we'll see how the market reacts. But how much did we lose on the crypto market cap?
00:08:09.728 - 00:08:17.606, Speaker B: $40 billion in total crypto market cap lost in the last week, which is like small change, I guess. Could be worse.
00:08:17.638 - 00:08:18.630, Speaker A: Luna could be worse.
00:08:18.710 - 00:08:21.020, Speaker B: Just a Luna one Luna down.
00:08:22.030 - 00:08:48.082, Speaker A: All right, well, let's get into some news, man. We're going to divide this because it's bear market season. Let's talk about the bear market news first, then we'll get into the good news, but let's bad news first. So bear market news. This is just general macro markets, but have you seen Ark innovation lately? Remember we had Kathy Wood on the podcast not less than a year ago, and things are pretty good at Arc still. That has completely reversed. Look at these charts.
00:08:48.146 - 00:08:49.718, Speaker B: Down bad. Arc down bad.
00:08:49.804 - 00:08:55.446, Speaker A: Very sad. Okay. ArC is. They were up. Let me see. No.
00:08:55.548 - 00:09:00.114, Speaker B: 750% since October 2014.
00:09:00.242 - 00:09:01.530, Speaker A: Since their inception.
00:09:01.950 - 00:09:03.082, Speaker B: That's a lot of percent.
00:09:03.216 - 00:09:22.538, Speaker A: Okay. So they were up 750%, and now they're only up 112%. And they're actually underperforming the Nasdaq by a lot. QQQ business chart by a lot at this point. So if you just had held Nasdaq versus Arc this point in time, you would have been up more than double.
00:09:22.634 - 00:09:25.274, Speaker B: Two x. Yeah, it's pretty brutal.
00:09:25.402 - 00:09:26.610, Speaker A: What do you think is going on here?
00:09:26.680 - 00:09:56.714, Speaker B: Well, I mean, it makes sense if you take everything together, right? The whole idea about ARc is that it prices in the future. Kathy Wood is saying there is so much growth that the market is not pricing in right now. We got growth in crypto and blockchain. We got growth in electric vehicles like battery technology, biotechnology. And people are mispricing how much future growth is coming in the short term. And so Ark is based on the future, which is crazy to think about. Like, oh, investing is about the future weird, but that's what the Arc real brand is.
00:09:56.714 - 00:10:34.482, Speaker B: Is like. So much of typical investing is about just pricing in historical history, like, historical patterns. But Kathy Wood has taken the counter trade of generally well accepted investing and pricing in future growth, which just makes sense to me. But also, when the Fed injects a bunch of money into the market, it allows the whole market to price in the future. When interest rates are cheap, you allow people to look into the future and invest and speculate. And so arc goes up 750%, and then inflation happens, and then we increase the interest rates to tell people to stop looking for the future and start saving your dollars now. And so then arc dies.
00:10:34.482 - 00:10:39.320, Speaker B: It goes down from 750% to 112%. So this all just makes sense.
00:10:40.090 - 00:10:56.842, Speaker A: Other than you're not saying the future is more pessimistic suddenly overnight. You're just saying the expectations or the market reaction to that future. Right. The liquidity is kind of dried up, and so cash flow potential of the future just looks much more pessimistic and dim.
00:10:56.906 - 00:11:07.634, Speaker B: Right. And this is why we're calling it the build market. Right. Same thing applies to crypto. Like, crypto's future has never been brighter. Like, the amount of building going on right now is insane. Yet prices don't reflect that.
00:11:07.634 - 00:11:15.780, Speaker B: Prices are down bad because of monetary policy and interest rates and all that stuff. So it's not that you're wrong, it's that the Fed doesn't like it.
00:11:16.390 - 00:11:33.002, Speaker A: Welcome to the build market. The new reality. I think we're all embracing openc new reality. This is a chart of seven day average. They're back to December 2021 levels. And I think continuing to drop. So NfT market pretty bearish here, too.
00:11:33.002 - 00:11:55.742, Speaker A: Let's switch it up, though. There's been some good news here. Okay, here's the one I want to start with. Uniswap just hit $1 trillion in lifetime trading volume. David, I remember not too long ago, okay, less three years ago, people said again, ether was dead. Bitcoin is kind of like the only use case, but it was dying as well. Defi would never work.
00:11:55.742 - 00:12:12.150, Speaker A: Smart contracts would never work. What are they good for? Here comes this upstart uniswap that's saying, hey, we're creating a different type of exchange. It's not going to be peer to peer. It's going to be decentralized. It's going to be peer to contract. Okay, now here they are. The experiment worked incredibly well.
00:12:12.150 - 00:12:23.718, Speaker A: Three years later, 1 trillion in value. All right. A lot of people said that this would never happen, and now we've hit it. It pays to be contrarian in these bear markets.
00:12:23.894 - 00:12:57.842, Speaker B: 10 trillion by the end of 2024. I'd say also in the world of awesome numbers and metrics, during our build market, the ENS boom is absolutely insane. So here are the April 2022 ens stats. 163,000 new ETH registration. So that's almost a million names registered. All of those fees for registering all those names goes to the ENS Dow. So the ENS Dow collected 2660 ETH in fees, which is up from the most the previous all time high of November 2021, which is 900 ETH more than November 2021.
00:12:57.842 - 00:13:19.766, Speaker B: That's basically $8 million going to the Dow. 38,000 new ETH accounts with at least one new Ens name. So this is a proxy for users because new Ethereum wallets buying their first Ens name, 38,000 of those, and then over 40,000 ETH being traded in secondary market sales. Just on openc 4000, I think. 4000 ETH.
00:13:19.798 - 00:13:20.186, Speaker A: Yes.
00:13:20.288 - 00:13:37.042, Speaker B: And that was April. That wasn't even May, Ryan. That was April. May is now all in, and there is an all time high for every single Ens metric that Nick Johnson from Ens tracks. There's a link in the show notes to go. Look at this. But here are the things to look at.
00:13:37.042 - 00:13:59.382, Speaker B: April. We're not even done with May, and it looks like May is already well beyond. Yeah, no, we're not done with May. We're already like 20% longer or higher in terms of revenue for the protocol versus April. We still have like five days left. This is one of my favorite lines, is that there's always a bull market somewhere. It doesn't matter what phase of the market in, you can always find a bull market.
00:13:59.382 - 00:14:04.922, Speaker B: The bull market cycle has rotated into Ens names in the last couple of months or so.
00:14:05.056 - 00:14:08.330, Speaker A: That's really cool. And this is another chart from Nick. What's this showing?
00:14:08.750 - 00:14:18.480, Speaker B: He says, oh, let's not forget new and returning users to all time high. With returning users, all time high for new users. ENS speculation. That's a thing.
00:14:18.850 - 00:14:40.342, Speaker A: There's more on the ENS boom from William peacery. Wrote a fantastic article on this in metaverse. We'll include a link to the show notes there, too, David, as well. Some interesting reports. Actually, two reports that I wanted to highlight is one from Goldman Sachs and the other from the Federal reserve. And I think the story here is, oh, my God. Most people don't have crypto yet.
00:14:40.342 - 00:14:56.250, Speaker A: So few people have crypto. All right, just a few stats from the Goldman report. First, crypto represents just 0.3% of the average household's net worth. 0.3%. That's it. My house is a little different than that.
00:14:56.250 - 00:15:19.246, Speaker A: Imagine your household is a little different, but 0.3%. Okay. And this is if you compare it to the rest of the economy, the total crypto market cap is about 1.3 trillion. American household wealth sits at 150,000,000,000,000. Less than a percent. Less than a percent of total wealth is held in crypto.
00:15:19.246 - 00:15:32.178, Speaker A: Right now. There's some other interesting stats, like if you sort of compare how many adults hold crypto. Last year, 12% of all adults in the US held crypto.
00:15:32.354 - 00:15:56.938, Speaker B: Yeah. The story here is that there's a lot of people left to buy our bags. Bankless doesn't stop until 90% of all household wealth is crypto denominated. And so we got a lot left to do. The crazy thing is that these are numbers even after the mania. Right? And so we're about to see probably an exodus out of the crypto industry from all the tourists. And while I would say, like, gut check me on this, Ryan.
00:15:56.938 - 00:16:03.310, Speaker B: Ryan. But, like, 20% of people that come in during bull markets stay as long term settlers. Is that kind of high?
00:16:03.380 - 00:16:08.302, Speaker A: Oh, 20% stay, 20% stay. Okay. Yeah, I'd say 80% might be on the high side.
00:16:08.356 - 00:16:08.858, Speaker B: That might be high.
00:16:08.884 - 00:16:13.394, Speaker A: Might be like 10% really stay, 20% stay. Kind of interested.
00:16:13.512 - 00:16:19.080, Speaker B: They listen to podcasts occasionally. Some people are like, oh, that's me.
00:16:20.250 - 00:16:22.760, Speaker A: Yeah, some people are not listening to this already.
00:16:23.610 - 00:16:34.426, Speaker B: We still have a bunch of people to leave in the next, if we are indeed in a b market, and so there's so much growth left in crypto, hashtag early, I guess.
00:16:34.448 - 00:16:38.540, Speaker A: Did you say if we are indeed in a b market, we're definitely in a b market, are we not?
00:16:41.710 - 00:16:59.682, Speaker B: Ether still $1,800, man. We're still $400 above the top tick of the last bull cycle, which means maybe we have more to go. We'll talk about this more, but there is universal consensus that we are going down, like another 50%. And David doesn't buy it. I don't buy it. I think we could.
00:16:59.736 - 00:17:00.946, Speaker A: I definitely think we could.
00:17:01.048 - 00:17:03.106, Speaker B: Everyone thinks that. Everyone thinks that.
00:17:03.208 - 00:17:33.950, Speaker A: You know, what did you know, though? This is super interesting. I saw this from coin metrics. They put this chart out this week. If you look at kind of the three classes of tokens on Ethereum, right? Just divide it into this. Ether, stablecoins, and other tokens, other ERC 20 tokens, all right, the numbers come out like this. Stablecoins are about $108,000,000,000. All right, other tokens, non stablecoin tokens are actually less than this, than that $86 billion.
00:17:33.950 - 00:17:54.942, Speaker A: And ether is $240,000,000,000. So ether is still the vast majority of value on the Ethereum network. Stablecoins are only $108,000,000,000, but they've already exceeded as a killer app the rest of the ERC 20s, which are $86 billion. Do you think that this will stay like this as a proportion? What do you think happens in the future? David?
00:17:55.006 - 00:18:49.378, Speaker B: Okay, so Ethereum is meant to be a protocol for other applications. Many of those applications being token related, seems to be the product market fit of Ethereum. We like tokens. It's been thought by the developers that a secure Ethereum has, like, roughly a one to ten to roughly one to 100 ratio of value on top of Ethereum to ether value, because the ether value proof of stake secures the network, right? And so if we have a $10 trillion ether market cap, which is where we will eventually get to, I'm sure it will be safely storing and managing $100 to $200 trillion of total wealth on top of that. And so that is the balance. Like a strong foundation of $10 trillion of ether market cap can safely secure 100 to maybe $200 trillion on top of that as well. Also shout out to just like wealth generation on Ethereum.
00:18:49.378 - 00:19:07.990, Speaker B: In the bullcase for Ethereum, the long term, what we're here for is like hundreds of trillions of dollars of total wealth creation. And so right now when we see only something like 20% of the Ethereum of the ether market cap being secured on top of Ethereum, so much room left for growth.
00:19:08.410 - 00:19:17.354, Speaker A: Absolutely. It's another indication network early guys, we got so much more coming up, including the GameStop wallet. We're going to peek that open. What else we got? David?
00:19:17.482 - 00:19:30.658, Speaker B: Oh my God. The loop ring boys are going to be really happy about the GameStop wallet. So shout out to those guys. Luna 2.0 no algo stablecoin this time. So what is it? And also loyalty coin season. We're going to talk about that a little bit.
00:19:30.658 - 00:19:59.578, Speaker B: Bear market prices but bull market building. We will be right back after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible. The era of proof of stake is upon us and Lido is bringing proof of stake to everyone. Lido is a decentralized staking protocol that allows users to stake their proof of stake assets using Lido's distributed network of nodes. Don't choose between staking your assets or using them as collateral in defi. With lido, you can have both. Using Lido, you can stake any amount of your ETH to the Lido validating network and receive st ETH in return.
00:19:59.578 - 00:20:30.982, Speaker B: ST ETH can be traded, used as collateral for lending and borrowing, or leveraged on your favorite defi protocols. All this without giving up your EtH to centralized staking services or exchanges. Lido now supports Terra Solana, Kusama and Polygon staking. Whatever your preferred proof of stake asset is, lido is here to take away the complexities of staking while enabling you to get liquidity on your stake. If you want to stake your etH, terra Sol or matic and get liquidity on your stake, go to lido fi to get started. That's lido fi to get started. The L2 era is upon us.
00:20:30.982 - 00:21:00.906, Speaker B: Ethereum's L2 ecosystem is growing every day, and we need bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a L2 life. Across is the fastest, cheapest and most secure crosschain bridge. With across. You don't have to worry about the long wait times or high fees to get your assets to the chain of your choice. Assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously. Across bridges are powered by UMA's optimistic oracle to securely transfer tokens from L2 back to Ethereum. A token proposal is being deliberated as we speak in the across forum, where community members will decide on the token distribution.
00:21:00.906 - 00:21:48.910, Speaker B: You can have your part of across's story by joining the discord and becoming a cofounder and helping to design the fair fair launch of Accrop. If you want to bridge your assets quickly and securely, go to accrop to to bridge your assets between Ethereum, optimism, arbitram, or Boba networks. If you're trying to grow and preserve your crypto wealth, optimizing your taxes is just as lucrative as trying to find the next hidden gem. Also, IRA can help you invest in crypto in tax advantage ways to help you preserve your hardearned money.

00:21:48.910 - 00:22:06.642, Speaker B: Let me repeat that again. You can invest in crypto tax free. Diversify like the pros and trade without tax headaches. Open an Alto crypto IRA to invest in crypto tax free. Just go to altoira.com bankless. That's altoira.com
00:22:06.642 - 00:22:19.938, Speaker B: bankless and start investing in crypto today. And we're back. It's GameStop season. The GameStop wallet is here. You can go and download the GameStop wallet. It looks like a metamask extension. I believe it's also on mobile wallet.
00:22:19.938 - 00:22:45.534, Speaker B: Gamestop.com. It's a L2 wallet, and Ryan has got it built into his browser already. So, I mean, if you know what Metamask is, you kind of are going to be familiar with it. But it's built on the loop ring L2. And so the loop ring bros are super happy about that. And so shout out to all them the alpha for what this thing actually is. I was trying to go around the blog post for like, all right, who's released like, loop ring didn't release very much information.
00:22:45.534 - 00:22:50.258, Speaker B: GameStop didn't release very much information. You know where the alpha is, Ryan? You know where I found it, I bet.
00:22:50.344 - 00:22:55.346, Speaker A: Is it on the GME subreddits? No, it's not on Superstonk or anything like that.
00:22:55.368 - 00:23:23.034, Speaker B: Yeah, the alpha is on the Chrome webpage store, and so it goes through the features self custodial Ethereum wallet. You can buy eth with a few taps or credit card or debit card using Apple Pay. There's probably a back end payment integration there. It's on the loop ring L2. It's got all the token standards, of course, ETh ERC 20, ERC 721 ERC 1155, send and receive. It's good for payments. You can swap both on the Ethereum l one and the loop ring L2.
00:23:23.034 - 00:23:46.802, Speaker B: You can connect your GameStop wallet to decentralized apps in the world of Ethereum, of course. But the bigger question is what you can connect this to in the world of GameStop. And so there are GameStop nfts at beta NFT, gameStop.com, those four dots, and you can check it out there. So GameStop going from a brick and mortar business to a web3 NFT store.
00:23:46.856 - 00:24:02.038, Speaker A: I can't believe it. I'm super impressed by this, actually. The meme became reality, and they're actually getting into crypto in a meaningful way. I mean, this is like a metamask level. It looks good wallet. It looks fantastic. There's a place for your coins, there's a place for your nfts, there's a place to swap, just like metamask.
00:24:02.038 - 00:24:31.758, Speaker A: In fact, the user interface in some ways is kind of nicer. Obviously, I haven't used this very much yet, but it's supporting L2 out of the box, which is loopering right now, but they're going to be incorporating other L2s as well. That's impressive. Completely self custodial. These guys are on it, and I'm blown away with what they delivered in this first release. So it's super cool to see. David, I thought we had wallet week, because, remember, we talked, it was like Robin Hood and Coinbase releasing a wallet, and ledger releasing a wallet.
00:24:31.758 - 00:24:41.222, Speaker A: And now here's GameStop entering. Just in the past seven days, all of these wallets have come to fruition, at least, like, I don't know, 14 days now. I don't know what the time span is, but two weeks?
00:24:41.356 - 00:24:53.562, Speaker B: Granted, I haven't tried to explore and use the other wallets yet that you just mentioned, but this is the first wallet that we have on screen in the browser, ready to go. So kudos to GameStop for that. Oh, boy. From the ashes, Ryan was.
00:24:53.616 - 00:25:04.826, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, so it looks like Luna is rising from the ashes. I think so. A Luna 20 sort of thing. Here's a thread that explains it. Terra 20, I guess I should say so. Luna is a token.
00:25:04.826 - 00:25:24.178, Speaker A: Terra is the chain. Of course, there's going to be a new Luna as well. And basically what they're doing is relaunching this blockchain network as a layer one without the algo stablecoin this time. So there seems to be some acknowledgement. Hey, I think that was kind of a bad idea.
00:25:24.344 - 00:25:25.490, Speaker B: That didn't work.
00:25:25.640 - 00:25:38.050, Speaker A: Let's not do that again. And they are distributing Luna tokens to the Luna Classic. So I guess the old Luna network is now called Luna Classic. Is that the case, or is this Luna classic?
00:25:38.130 - 00:25:42.006, Speaker B: No, old chain, Luna Classic, new chain is currently called Luna.
00:25:42.118 - 00:26:02.174, Speaker A: Okay. And they're giving it to a community pool, first of all. So it's the guy gets the slush fund for the community to vote on that sort of thing. Then they're giving an allotment to the pre attack Luna holders, 35%, the pre attack UST holders, 10%. And then the post attack. Yeah. Oh, my God.
00:26:02.174 - 00:26:34.538, Speaker A: I can't believe I'm reading that out and I didn't even notice that propaganda. But absolutely, I refuse to call it an attack. Now that you said that the post incident, post collapse Luna holders and the post collapse UST holders as well are getting some portion of this. So I don't know. I'm glad there's some resurrection. It seems like know some similar ideas, same management as, like, I think Doe Kwan, other than Dokwon involved in this. Other than Doe Kwan is not going.
00:26:34.624 - 00:26:37.740, Speaker B: He will not be here. He is in.
00:26:38.990 - 00:26:48.910, Speaker A: Okay. Like, was this his idea, though? I thought this was partially his idea, but he's got other things to deal with is more what you're like, maybe.
00:26:49.060 - 00:26:59.346, Speaker B: I don't know the details. Not connected to the terror ecosystem. I would be surprised if Doe Kwan is a leader in this whole entire thing, especially while he is going through some legal issues.
00:26:59.528 - 00:27:03.698, Speaker A: Oh, boy. Can you tell us what some of those might be? I think that's our next story.
00:27:03.784 - 00:27:18.966, Speaker B: Yeah. This is more related to the Luna foundation guard. And so police authorities in South Korea have taken action to freeze assets tied to the LFG. The Seoul. Seoul. How do you pronounce the capital of South Korea? I've actually never.
00:27:19.068 - 00:27:19.574, Speaker A: Seoul? Yeah.
00:27:19.612 - 00:27:21.590, Speaker B: Okay. Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.
00:27:22.030 - 00:27:23.494, Speaker A: It's like ethereum's got Seoul.
00:27:23.542 - 00:27:49.406, Speaker B: Absolutely. The police of Seoul has asked multiple exchanges to block Luna foundation guards from withdrawing any corporate funds. And so there is rumors of embezzlement, TBD on that. But that is one of the reasons why the police have said that they have the authority to do this. They said they intervened after finding clues that they were indicating there was embezzled funds within the LFG. Oof. That is an oof, Ryan.
00:27:49.406 - 00:27:50.498, Speaker B: That's what that is.
00:27:50.664 - 00:28:06.406, Speaker A: I remember there was some podcasters, maybe some critics, who said that holding assets like bitcoin off chain was not a good idea by a small set of multisig signers. Not a good idea not to have a clean, transparent audit trail for all of that stuff.
00:28:06.508 - 00:28:07.990, Speaker B: Yeah, but you're just a fudding.
00:28:10.170 - 00:28:22.634, Speaker A: I am. Look, I'm glad. I hope this will not be the last time we talk about Terra and Luna. I'm sure. But I'm just hopeful that all of this can be pushed behind us. I'm just done talking about it. It's over.
00:28:22.634 - 00:28:24.686, Speaker A: Let's move. Let's move. Let's move on this.
00:28:24.708 - 00:28:49.346, Speaker B: Moving on. Well, not the only thing taken to court, but this time not so nice. Layton Cusack of pool together is sadly part getting wrapped up in this whole pool together lawsuit. And this is becoming a bigger and bigger deal as we get more details about the lawsuit itself. Somebody deposited $12 into pool together and immediately filed a quarter billion dollar class action lawsuit on pool together. Because flagging is like. It's a lottery.
00:28:49.346 - 00:29:07.526, Speaker B: It's illegal. I lost money on gas. I'm not making a joke about that. That's in the whole thing. And so pool together has sadly been paying hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars of legal fees to fight this thing. This very innocent, very beloved Defi app. A no loss lottery.
00:29:07.526 - 00:29:27.906, Speaker B: You literally cannot lose money. It's called a savings account. It's called a gamified, linked savings account. You put your money in and every once in a while, if you win, you get a bunch of money. And then if you don't, if you want to get out, you get out. It has pulled together, has onboarded so many communities from all across the world. It's probably the most multinational Defi app that I know of.
00:29:27.906 - 00:29:54.858, Speaker B: They've done a fantastic job putting out documentation and literature in many, many languages to onboard people from Asia, from Africa, from all over the world. And so it's like the most diverse app by usage. And they are getting these absolute Schmidt sued out of them by somebody connected to Elizabeth Warren. A previous Elizabeth Warren campaign person is doing this. And so pool together. This is the call to arms. Defi is under attack.
00:29:54.858 - 00:30:05.342, Speaker B: They're not just going after pool together, they're going after Defi and they're using pool together to do it. And so if you think that this isn't your problem, it is your problem. This is an attack on all of us.
00:30:05.396 - 00:30:17.226, Speaker A: Yeah. So here's what they're doing. It says keep Pooley flying. So they're minting all of these Pooley birds. These are nfts that you can purchase. So there's a Pooley supporter. It's 0.1
00:30:17.226 - 00:30:57.790, Speaker A: eth all the way to a lawyer and a judge. And those are more expensive, and there's limited quality of each and all of the funds, all of the proceeds go to the defense of pool together in this lawsuit. And I think, David, this could become a shelling point for the rest of the Defi community, because this is like the first battle of a war that we have to fight the nation state level. And more specifically, I mean, we're fighting this war with kind of lobbyists and Washington politicians and regulators, this sort of thing. We also have to fight it in the court system. Okay, so this is how we defend our rights in the court system. And this is less about, like, no, will this court case kill Defi? Of course it can't kill Defi.
00:30:57.790 - 00:31:26.306, Speaker A: That can't happen. What this is about is making sure that Americans, people in the US, people in whatever jurisdiction you live in, do not get left behind. Because if our governments come together and they say regular citizens can't use a Defi savings account like this, or even worse, maybe I don't, can't open an ETH address. I don't know where this leads in the court system, then it's us citizens who will be left behind. That's why this is so important. I minted a pooley. I am a lawyer.
00:31:26.418 - 00:31:28.690, Speaker B: I also got a lawyer. We are now lawyers.
00:31:28.770 - 00:31:49.214, Speaker A: We are lawyers. You and I are lawyers. And look, David, it's scary, man. Do you ever think, like, even what you just mean you could be sued bankless could be sued for what you just pulled together in the very early. No, no, before that. Just talking about pulled together. We've posted articles about pulled together, how.
00:31:49.252 - 00:32:08.590, Speaker B: To engage with a prize linked savings account. And I remember writing about pool together back in my pov crypto days, all the way back in 2018 or something. And as a result of that, people took their money and put it in pool together. Some made money, and no one has lost money. And we might be sued for stating that, that you can do this.
00:32:08.680 - 00:32:28.730, Speaker A: Totally, David. I wouldn't be surprised if we were at some point, some frivolous lawsuits coming out. So, look, the community's got to rise up. We've got to protect people that are going bankless, protect our DeFi protocols, fight this out in the court system so american citizens don't get left behind. That's what this is about. DFI will be fine. Let's make sure America doesn't miss the boat here.
00:32:28.800 - 00:32:54.638, Speaker B: Okay, so what you got to do, you got to go mint your pooley. Mint poologether.com link. In the show notes, there are three different tiers that you can mint. 0.1 e for the little guy, one ETH for a lawyer, and 75 ETH for a judge. If you want to be a real chad, the bullcase for this, the financial bullcase for this, is that with this in your wallet, you are signaling that you are somebody who cares about Defi and you are a good community member.
00:32:54.638 - 00:33:03.800, Speaker B: And so with this nft in your wallet, you get to signal to the world that you care about Defi and that you are a good ethereum wallet to have this nft in it.
00:33:05.210 - 00:33:08.722, Speaker A: Are you implying that this could have financial upside?
00:33:08.866 - 00:33:32.110, Speaker B: Yeah. This added to an airdrop list, a list of good people who care about DFI. And I remember just like, and this is the story of airdrops, right? Like, things I did in 2017 ultimately got me an airdrop in 2022. And so you don't know when it's going to come, but you want to be on the list. You want to put your name on the list. So that is the financial bullcase for minting Apuli.
00:33:32.530 - 00:33:37.120, Speaker A: Yeah. Do it for the right reasons, do it for the wrong reasons, whatever.
00:33:37.970 - 00:33:44.146, Speaker B: It's regen crypto. We can turn bad incentives into good ones. This is a good thing to fight for.
00:33:44.248 - 00:33:47.746, Speaker A: Listen, crypto. Beautiful. What do we got next? David?
00:33:47.858 - 00:34:26.530, Speaker B: Optimism token. Okay, so optimism cracking down on airdrop farmers, removing 17,000 addresses that have been verifiable to have been farming the crap out of the airdrop. This is also a very similar strategy from hot protocol, these two airdrops, which have come out in the last month or so, I've been calling the new meta for airdrops. It is an arms race between farmers and airdrop senders. So we're trying to find all the farmers and nix them, because they're not the community, they're toxic. They just farm and dump the token. And so having this strategy, the optimism strategy, was to create six different criteria that you can get the airdrop for.
00:34:26.530 - 00:34:56.070, Speaker B: And then if you had multiples of those criteria, you had a multiplier. And so that was a community surgically discovering the community strategy. And then hop protocol strategy was you could go and do ether scan, like NArc on farmers, and if you could find the hop protocol farmers, you could report them, and you could receive 25% of the tokens that they would have received. Wow. Mitigating token distribution that way. So smart. And so this is the new metaphor, airdrops.
00:34:56.070 - 00:35:02.122, Speaker B: So, Ryan, for the listeners out there who are like, damn, but I want to farm the airdrop, what do you think that they need to do?
00:35:02.256 - 00:35:19.950, Speaker A: I think they should be a real human instead and just use the protocol the way a real human would use it and stop trying to game the system. And instead of trying to game the system and go for the short term rewards. Here, just think about crypto as just a long term, multi year, multidecade journey.
00:35:20.110 - 00:35:40.358, Speaker B: Put your student cap on, go learn how to use the protocol, treat it like a homework assignment, find every single corner about the protocol, put real money in, and then you will probably be getting an airdrop to other things related to, like size of money and time of money. So those are all concerns as well. Anyways, that's your alpha for the week.
00:35:40.524 - 00:36:03.854, Speaker A: There's more alpha here, which is love alpha. Yeah. Loyalty coins season. That may be starting. We've talked about loyalty coins in the past a little bit, but maybe you could give the TLDR on what a loyalty coin is. And we're seeing actually two examples of it in play this week. One at Coindesk, the desk token, and the other is revolut, which is with Revcoin revolut, a major fintech platform as well.
00:36:03.854 - 00:36:10.930, Speaker A: So give us the TLDR. What is a loyalty coin and what's happening this week that people should pay attention to?
00:36:11.000 - 00:36:57.498, Speaker B: Well, people should be familiar with loyalty points, right? And now it's just loyalty points, but as tokens. And so there was a big movement in 2017 to, during the Ico mania, tokenize airline miles, which I thought was hilarious, actually wasn't the worst idea of the Ico mania, but there's this concept that is universal. It's a primitive, I'd say, where if you put and engage your economic activity through a particular host, like your credit cards or your airlines, they just give you back rewards. And it's basically like yield farming, right? Like if you buy a flight, you get some points, and the points get you to buy more flights, right? It's like a form of yield farming. This is a primitive. One of great marketing strategies is to pay people to use your stuff. And so Coindesk has launched the desk token and is a part of the experience of consensus 2022.
00:36:57.498 - 00:37:31.994, Speaker B: For the people who are going to consensus 2022, you can earn desk throughout the festival by engaging in consensus stuff, and you can also redeem it for swag, food, drinks, nfts, and more. It's basically like the internal currency of consensus. And overall, the coindesk ecosystem, this is nothing new, but there's now like a verifiable place where you can spend all your points for swag and food and stuff. So it counts as, and this is, again, this is not the coindesk, which very large company. It's a big deal that they're doing this revolut. Even bigger company, even bigger deal. They're also doing this.
00:37:31.994 - 00:37:33.186, Speaker B: So they're doing revcoin.
00:37:33.238 - 00:37:56.978, Speaker A: Yeah. And Revcoin is kind of what you were just saying, david, from the article. Revcoin will function in a similar way to airline air Miles programs, where users earn rewards based on how often they use the service. It definitely won't be a stablecoin, says the founder. The goal is to make loyalty tradable. I love how he says it definitely won't be a stable coin right after the collapse of terra. No, we're not that, guys.
00:37:57.064 - 00:38:02.450, Speaker B: But it's also like, hey, price can go up, by the way. That's the other, between the lines.
00:38:02.530 - 00:38:20.034, Speaker A: Well, that's the thing. That's what he said. The goal is to make loyalty tradable. So the problem with airline miles and hotel points, and I don't know if, David, if in my younger years, I used to try to open a bunch of cards and game the system and get the. Maximize my programs from the credit card farming.
00:38:20.102 - 00:38:21.562, Speaker B: Yeah, that was credit card farming.
00:38:21.626 - 00:38:39.266, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly, man. Similar thing I do today, I guess. Anyway, it was way less profitable then. Part of the reason why is because you couldn't transfer the tokens or trade them. What is the value of an airline mileage? Whatever american airline says it is.
00:38:39.288 - 00:38:43.326, Speaker B: Plus, they're highly inflationary. They're kind of highly inflationary. They're terrible.
00:38:43.438 - 00:39:08.010, Speaker A: And so the ability to actually have a market price and allow these things to escape in the open finance economy and the Defi economy, that's what's special here. That's what's cool. I think we'll see all sorts of, look, there's no real regulatory pain points here in the way there is with, like, securities and that sort of thing. Right. Loyalty coin is sort of a different thing. We have some precedent for that in the real world. So I think that's all a good thing.
00:39:08.080 - 00:39:34.210, Speaker B: And if you listen to that, you have a summary. Yeah. And if you listen to that and you're like, oh, I'm bullish. Here's the bear case. There's one of my favorite episodes of always Sunny in Philadelphia, where they mint Patty bucks. Patty is the name of their pub, and they give out Patty bucks to incentivize people to come into their bar. And then people come into their bar and they buy beer with the Patty bucks, and then at the end of the day, they're like, okay, now we don't have any beer because we sold it, and all we have is Patty bucks.
00:39:34.210 - 00:39:47.800, Speaker B: They're like, okay, well, what do we do? Like, oh, well, we go give the patty bucks back out so they can come and drink our beer. And they're like, wait, when do we get the money, though? Where's the dollars come in? And then they've never quite figured that out. It's like a.
00:39:48.170 - 00:39:55.178, Speaker A: But Defi figures that out because they could just swap the patty bucks on you to swap, right? There's going to be a market for that. So you have your patty bucks at the end of the day.
00:39:55.264 - 00:40:02.266, Speaker B: Well, no, but then that's what we're talking about. Coindesk lets them take their death token to uniswap and sell it for Eth.
00:40:02.378 - 00:40:22.450, Speaker A: I don't know how it works, David. It's an experiment, okay? And we are not a stablecoin. Definitely it's not a stablecoin. Opensea just launched something big, too. This is Opensea marketplace called Seaport. And I'm not sure it's one marketplace, but it's a set of marketplaces. Can you try to explain this? I know the details are scant right now, but do the best you can.
00:40:22.520 - 00:40:56.746, Speaker B: Details are scant about what this whole spin up a marketplace thing means. The details that I do know, that it is verifiable, is that it is opening up more ways to express a sale. So right now, you go to Opensea, and you're like, I like those properties. I will buy it with my eth. A seller now with Seaport can take one of their nfts, like, I don't know, a hoodie cryptopunk, for example. And then they put up the hoodie cryptopunk, and they're like, I want a 3d glasses crypto punk. And so I will sell my hoodie punk for a 3d glasses punk.
00:40:56.746 - 00:41:07.200, Speaker B: And that trade can be executed by somebody who owns a 3d glasses punk. And so you can just skip the money. Apparently, the theme here is we're going back to the barter system.
00:41:07.570 - 00:41:11.058, Speaker A: I thought we were speed running finance. Now it sounds like we're going in the wrong.
00:41:11.144 - 00:41:28.758, Speaker B: We're going in all directions barter. This seems to be like the theme of the show is the part where we skip the money. Think about it inside of a video game, right? Where you have your axe and you want to trade it for some guy's sword or something, or just like, you have one, it would make more sense.
00:41:28.844 - 00:41:30.242, Speaker A: Three axes for one sword.
00:41:30.306 - 00:41:35.818, Speaker B: Yeah, stuff like that. And so it's just like expressing more abilities to trade stuff. So useful tool.
00:41:35.984 - 00:41:39.660, Speaker A: That's cool. What's not cool?
00:41:40.350 - 00:42:06.658, Speaker B: Here's what's not cool. Seth Green. Yeah. He has a tv show and he is because he owns TBD on that one, because he owns a board ape, he can use the property, the ip of that to make a tv show. So he's made a tv show. He's invested money into this, but he sadly lost his ape, as many apes do, to a phishing attack. So he no longer has the commercial rights to the NFT and therefore cannot run the show.
00:42:06.824 - 00:42:08.030, Speaker A: Wait, is that for real?
00:42:08.120 - 00:42:13.718, Speaker B: That is for real, Ryan. He no longer has ownership over the ip because he lost his Ape to a phishing attack.
00:42:13.884 - 00:42:16.162, Speaker A: His entire show got hacked.
00:42:16.306 - 00:42:48.850, Speaker B: The entire show? The entire show. So this is like really bullish for CCO. I'd say, like, creative commons open, which are things like nounstow is this. Mfers are this. There's a bunch of CCO type nfts where anyone can use, like, imagine if you have a Star wars level franchise around your NFT that has embedded ip and it gets hacked, right? And so you have to have that thing in the deepest cold storage of all time in case somebody steals the ip.
00:42:49.750 - 00:42:52.098, Speaker A: Wow. Isn't self custody fun?
00:42:52.184 - 00:42:58.174, Speaker B: Yeah, right? So bullish CCO. I think it's the TLDR. Sorry, Seth Green, you lost your ape.
00:42:58.302 - 00:43:18.986, Speaker A: Look, I also think, like, bullish, smart contract, wallets, social recovery, better security. People are learning the hard way this cycle. And it's funny, it's not just like the crypto ogs losing their bitcoin. It's like people who are in the NFT space and just didn't take the time to go all the way back down the rabbit hole to figure out how to secure their stuff before they're diving into this.
00:43:19.088 - 00:43:22.490, Speaker B: On a separate note, would you watch an NFT tv show, Ryan?
00:43:23.070 - 00:43:29.966, Speaker A: Only if my nfts were in it. I mean, to be honest, I don't know. It has to be good content, I guess.
00:43:29.988 - 00:43:30.718, Speaker B: It's all the content.
00:43:30.804 - 00:43:37.278, Speaker A: Why do I want to watch it? Yeah. With somebody else's bag. Why don't watch a show of somebody else's apes? Unless I'm part of the ape community.
00:43:37.364 - 00:43:37.674, Speaker B: Right.
00:43:37.732 - 00:43:40.658, Speaker A: So there'll be at least 10,000 watchers of that show.
00:43:40.824 - 00:43:43.300, Speaker B: I don't think that's a very high number for a tv show.
00:43:43.670 - 00:43:52.754, Speaker A: I think you need more. It has to be good content. We'll see. Also spend judgment until we see it. David, just some quick things. You know, Cammie Russo met the pope.
00:43:52.802 - 00:44:03.494, Speaker B: She met the pope and she gave him her book. So the pope now owns an ethereum book. Bullish, I guess. I think so.
00:44:03.612 - 00:44:10.326, Speaker A: Well, a couple weeks ago, when we say the Vatican was doing nfts, the Pope Eth pilled.
00:44:10.518 - 00:44:12.358, Speaker B: I forgot about that. Nice job, Cammy.
00:44:12.454 - 00:44:12.762, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:44:12.816 - 00:44:16.750, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. We got crypto missionaries going out and recruiting popes through our religion.
00:44:17.970 - 00:44:32.946, Speaker A: Wow. All right, that's a deep cut. I don't know how many people you offended with that, but we'll keep going. SBF. Sam, Bankman freed just says he could spend as much as $1 billion in the 2024 election. $1 billion?
00:44:33.128 - 00:44:47.030, Speaker B: Yeah. So SBF, his brand is all about philanthropy, right? Like, I'm going to give back all of my net worth. I'm going to give it all away. I'm just going to make a bunch of money just to give it away. Has he given away a billion dollars yet?
00:44:47.180 - 00:44:50.710, Speaker A: I don't know. I don't know how much he's got. I haven't been tracking that. But this is not philanthropy.
00:44:50.790 - 00:44:52.998, Speaker B: This is not philanthropy. This is political clout.
00:44:53.094 - 00:44:54.922, Speaker A: Yeah. This is like lobbying help.
00:44:54.976 - 00:44:57.740, Speaker B: I will steer this ship with a billion dollars.
00:44:59.710 - 00:45:01.180, Speaker A: How do you feel about this?
00:45:03.250 - 00:45:20.500, Speaker B: It's probably good for the industry. It's definitely good for the industry. It also is really good just to say, like, yo, politicians, there's these people giving out billions of dollars to other politicians, and so we know the world of politics responds to money. It's probably good. It's probably good. Yes.
00:45:20.870 - 00:45:24.322, Speaker A: It's not awesome that this is how it works, though, that this is how.
00:45:24.456 - 00:45:26.020, Speaker B: It doesn't make me feel good.
00:45:26.390 - 00:46:02.622, Speaker A: It's like, when we talk about kind of lobbying, I imagine it much more of a grassroots thing, where it's hundreds, thousands of people, hundreds of thousands of people, millions of people who are donating small amounts in order to fund some sort of political action movement. It coming this way is a little bit different. I guess as long as what SBF is doing is protecting the values of decentralization and hardcore crypto values and defending against those and supporting politicians who put those in place and not trying to prop up this neocrypto banking sector, then I am still aligned with his mission here.
00:46:02.756 - 00:46:03.102, Speaker B: Yes.
00:46:03.156 - 00:46:13.262, Speaker A: But I don't necessarily trust that that's going to be the eventual outcome. And I don't think we should trust it. I think we should be eyes wide open when we start to use these sort of nation state tools.
00:46:13.326 - 00:46:24.998, Speaker B: Yes. You tapped on to what I was feeling that I couldn't verbalize, is that it doesn't make me feel good that a crypto neo banker is paying $1 billion to Joe Biden. That does not make me feel good.
00:46:25.084 - 00:46:27.126, Speaker A: Not necessarily just Joe Biden. Right.
00:46:27.308 - 00:46:28.598, Speaker B: I think it is Joe Biden, actually.
00:46:28.684 - 00:46:29.542, Speaker A: Oh, is it really?
00:46:29.596 - 00:46:30.410, Speaker B: I think so.
00:46:30.560 - 00:46:32.122, Speaker A: Wow. Okay. Wow.
00:46:32.256 - 00:46:37.386, Speaker B: He's also saying he could spend $1 billion. So he actually hasn't spent this yet.
00:46:37.488 - 00:46:40.202, Speaker A: Okay, well, he could spend 10 billion. He could spend.
00:46:40.256 - 00:46:41.840, Speaker B: I could spend 10 billion. Right.
00:46:43.570 - 00:47:10.934, Speaker A: All right. Well, somehow it feels more credible coming from SBF. I don't know, Dave. But speaking of all of the opportunity and billions of dollars in the crypto space, should we talk about jobs in crypto? This is our weekly opportunity to tell you to go get a job in crypto. I'm going to pull this up, David, but this is the bankless jobs board. Okay? This is where we list all of the jobs. And I'm going to read them out for you because you know what you have to do? You have to check this out.
00:47:10.934 - 00:47:45.802, Speaker A: Get on the list. Submit your resume to the talent collective as well. Number one, solidity developer from unlocked senior product designer, smart D five business development lead, Goldfinch marketing manager, Wanderverse VP of engineering ZKX head of growth ZKX developer evangelist, Argent customer success lead tally. I could go on, but they're all available for you. Get on the jobs board list, subscribe, sign up, and you can be part of getting this notice in the future. David, jobs are hot in crypto. You know what I feel like we did this time a lot better, is we actually prepared for wintertime.
00:47:45.802 - 00:47:59.714, Speaker A: We put some of those chestnuts know, we scrolled them all away, and there are a lot of companies that are still hiring, well positioned for this bear market. I don't think we'll see a major decrease in hiring at all.
00:47:59.832 - 00:48:30.798, Speaker B: I think I said this last week, and I might have said it with the week before, but this bear market is going to be the most unlike any other bear market. I tweeted out today, this bull market or bear market is going to be the greatest bull market of all time. And then I had to add an asterisk to that, meaning how much fun we're about to have. Not like we're all about to get wrecked. Not price related fun, although that might also happen. But the idea we have so much, this industry is flush with cash. It's not going to the assets, sadly, but it's going to building.
00:48:30.798 - 00:48:49.720, Speaker B: It's a build market. So this is unlike 2018, where everyone literally almost, like, everything almost went to zero. We almost lost basically all of our funding when ether was $80. We couldn't pay people to develop Ethereum. And so that was bad. Like, we almost ground to a halt. That is not what's happening right now.
00:48:49.720 - 00:49:03.802, Speaker B: It's the complete inverse we have. Every single company's flush with cash. Everyone's hiring. Bankless is hiring. We're hiring like crazy. It's kind of scary. And every single company has the money to spend to pay a lot of people.
00:49:03.802 - 00:49:22.000, Speaker B: And so everyone is going to make so much wealth in this bear market, Ryan, because that's where wealth is created. And so, so many things are going to get built, so many salaries about to get paid. So many people are going to get a job because hiring is probably at all time highs right now. I'd say it's insane. It's so fun. I'm having a great time.
00:49:22.530 - 00:49:36.082, Speaker A: I think there is going to be some belt tightening, but we'll get into it when we get into the raises. I mean, massive raises this week announced as well. But before we do, David Tracer has just released something cool. You want to tell us about this?
00:49:36.136 - 00:49:51.786, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay. So I'm going to run through the five things out of Tracer Dow's perpetuals v two. Disclaimer. Ryan and I are advisors for Tracer Dow. So we're close with the team. We have tokens, and we also know what's up going on behind the scenes, and that's why we have the information to talk about it.
00:49:51.786 - 00:50:14.538, Speaker B: But it's also here in this tweet as well. Tracer Dow perpetual pools. It's like leveraged long short positions, kind of like DyDX, but tokenized into a token. It's on balancer on arbitram right now. So you can go like three x long bitcoin, three x short bitcoin, et cetera, et cetera. The idea is that you can plug in any sort of price feed into tracer Dow, and you can produce a perpetual pool on that thing. So like any other crypto asset.
00:50:14.538 - 00:50:37.526, Speaker B: But then you can also do, like, housing markets or like oil or water or whatever. Anyways, going from v one to v two, first thing, no minimums. There's no more minimums on getting into a position you can enter or exit at any size. Love it. Feature number two, more stable value transfers. So in v one, when bitcoin were to go up by 5% in a single hour, the actual value transfer in a three x market was 13.6%, not 15%.
00:50:37.526 - 00:50:56.042, Speaker B: This makes the whole thing more efficient and better. This which leads into feature number three, which is long term tokens. That thing is called volatility decay. Previously, tokens would have eventually go to zero over time, but that has largely been fixed. These tokens are now suited for long term holding. Perfectly times Ryan for a three x position to go into the merge. If you dare.
00:50:56.042 - 00:51:17.314, Speaker B: If you dare, take that leverage position. Mint fee. There's also a mint fee to get into it. So this also helps prevent volatility decay and increase holding of these tokens. So if you mint the thing, there's a small fee towards the holders, not towards the protocol, towards the holders, and so the holders get the fee. Currently, there are two markets available. Three x BTC long short, three x eth long short.
00:51:17.314 - 00:51:36.762, Speaker B: There's also a quiz. This is what is also super cool about this. They're teaching you how to use the protocol. There's a quiz that changes every single week, and you can pass it to quiz to get a po op. Same deal with the whole pull together nft thing. Holding these po apps that prove you did something in a part of community are useful things to do. So there is my shill of the week.
00:51:36.762 - 00:51:40.750, Speaker B: It's a really cool product. I'm really bullish on it. There's a link in the show notes.
00:51:41.330 - 00:52:21.958, Speaker A: Cool. This is also pretty neat sense finance. They just released a few products. And what's cool about this is we've compared David, sort of ether being bonded to the yield curve, like treasuries, for instance. In the traditional markets, there's this yield curve, right? So you get to look at t bills, and you get to look at on the one year and the ten year and even the 20 and 30 year or the one month, right? This is called the yield curve, or the risk free rate, if you will, the risk free rate of money. When you hear terms like this, well, this is what sense is coming up with. They're coming up with a risk free rate for ETH, and they're coming out with an Eth yield curve.
00:52:21.958 - 00:53:05.654, Speaker A: So what's cool is they're creating a two month, a six month, a one year, and a five year yield curve for ether, the asset. So that means ether as a bond. There's a market for a maturity of that bond in two months. There's maturity in six months, maturity in one year and five years. And so through this, they can create a yield curve. We can actually see what the risk free rate for ether is in the ethereum economy. So this is kind of wonky stuff to geek out to you, but I think the risk free rate for ether within the ethereum economy is going to represent sort of the cost of capital, right? Because it's going to be like a really important, it's the new interest rate.
00:53:05.654 - 00:53:29.354, Speaker A: Because why would you invest in any token, in any defi project, really, in anything in the ethereum economy, unless you could actually exceed the opportunity cost of staking something in ether for two months or one year or five years, for instance. So I'm just psyched and kind of geeking out that we're starting to construct these yield curves in crypto.
00:53:29.402 - 00:53:44.290, Speaker B: I have so much to say about this. And I'm like, oh, this is the weekly roll up. I can't ramp, but I'm going to. So there's two things. It's not called the Internet bond for nothing. This is the financialization of ether, the asset in its proof of stake form. This is the Internet bond market.
00:53:44.290 - 00:54:07.974, Speaker B: This is the new. Like Ryan, the cost of capital is what the Fed does when it controls money, the price of money. And right now the Fed's like, okay, we need to make the cost of capital go up. The cool thing about the ethereum interest rate is it's dynamic, it's set by the market. And so yields go up when less people stake, because then Ethereum is asking more for more security. So it's incentivizing you. More yields go down when a lot of people stake.
00:54:07.974 - 00:54:34.094, Speaker B: But also what's not very often discussed, Ryan, is that when the economy is hot, when there's a hot economy, which is generally associated with high inflation rates and low costs of capital, when the economy heats up, what happens to gas prices? They go up. What happens to the staking fees? When gas prices are hot, they go up, increasing the stake rate, increasing the cost of capital, naturally putting a dampening effect on the heat of the Ethereum economy.
00:54:34.142 - 00:54:34.498, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:54:34.584 - 00:54:41.640, Speaker B: How crazy is that? And so it's like, no, we just got rid of twelve jobs. The board members of the Federal Reserve. We got it, guys.
00:54:42.570 - 00:54:59.706, Speaker A: We need to honestly do an entire episode around this. Once the yield curve kind of matures. You can even see here, this is super fascinating. So an ETH bond with a six month maturity is about 7.1, right? So it's high, higher. With a one month maturity it's four. Okay, and it goes.
00:54:59.706 - 00:55:18.090, Speaker A: So one month it's down at four. Six month maturity it's seven. So picture kind of the slope of the line here, one year it drops down to 6.69, and then five years it's 5.6. Interesting slope here from a time perspective. And it does chart the cost of capital.
00:55:18.170 - 00:55:43.098, Speaker B: And if you want to speculate on, like, I think the ethereum economy is going to grow hotter or I think it's going to grow colder, and you can express that. And so if you think interest rates are going to go up, you can speculate that or not. Interest rates yield rates. ETH yield rates are going to go up because the future of Ethereum is going to be a hotter economy. This allows you to express that. Super cool. The financialization of ETH is like in day one of 365 days.
00:55:43.098 - 00:55:45.242, Speaker B: There's so much left to do. It's a build market.
00:55:45.296 - 00:56:09.474, Speaker A: Yeah. Do you remember when staking came aboard? This is the world's first Internet bond. That's what we're really launching here now. We're starting to see this emerge. David, let's go through some raises real quick. All right, so a 16 z, biggest crypto fund ever. What bear market is kind of what they're saying here, $4.5
00:56:09.474 - 00:56:24.482, Speaker A: billion. And this is their fourth crypto fund. We actually had Mark Andreessen and Chris Dixon on the podcast. We're releasing the full episode Monday. If you're a premium subscriber, you can go access that now on the bankless premium feed. Fantastic. Hot episode.
00:56:24.482 - 00:56:29.366, Speaker A: And, David, what did Chris say he's going to spend all this on the $4.5 billion, do you recall exactly?
00:56:29.468 - 00:56:35.306, Speaker B: Oh, a bunch of companies, a bunch of startups building really cool stuff in the crypto space. Is that the right answer?
00:56:35.488 - 00:56:46.078, Speaker A: I think that's the good answer. It's crypto stuff like protocols, these stablecoins, whole bunch in jobs. This is why crypto is hiring. Also, there's another.
00:56:46.164 - 00:56:53.226, Speaker B: Yeah. If you're worried about job security in the bear market, just take note that there is $4.5 billion coming into this industry.
00:56:53.338 - 00:57:00.354, Speaker A: That's very true. They also backed flow carbon, which. This is Adam Newman. Do you know Adam Newman from the WeWork guy?
00:57:00.392 - 00:57:02.610, Speaker B: Do you know much about it? I know the story. Yeah, I watched the.
00:57:02.680 - 00:57:06.194, Speaker A: Well, why don't you tell the story then? I didn't watch the documentary. I don't know much about this.
00:57:06.232 - 00:57:12.194, Speaker B: Okay, so Adam Newman, he is basically like a theranos type thing where he just like, turned theranos.
00:57:12.242 - 00:57:12.406, Speaker A: Yes.
00:57:12.428 - 00:57:30.774, Speaker B: Thank you. He turned wework into this cult trade where so many people kept on pouring money into this thing. He's a really good salesman. He had this crazy vision. And he was basically adding just, like, this visionary element on top of what was essentially just, like, renting cubicle space. He was like, we're going to change consciousness. We're going to change society.
00:57:30.774 - 00:57:57.286, Speaker B: We have such ambitious projects. And then at the end of the day, when the fundamentals came because they wanted to go public, the public took a look at their documents and be like, these fundamentals are, like, the worst fundamentals of all time. Like, what the hell is going on here? What do we buy? And then they stopped having to go private. It was a big scandal. Anyways, Adam Newman is now backing flow carbon, a $70 million raise for flow carbon. He's not part of the team. So the controversial nature of Adam Newman is not relevant to what flow carbon is building.
00:57:57.286 - 00:58:00.614, Speaker B: But it's just, like, an interesting story. Also, a 16 z.
00:58:00.732 - 00:58:04.306, Speaker A: This is a startup. He's co founded it, David.
00:58:04.338 - 00:58:07.090, Speaker B: So he's definitely just kidding. Oopsies.
00:58:07.250 - 00:58:34.814, Speaker A: No, he's the co founder of the thing. So it's backed by a 16 z and a whole bunch of others. General catalyst, Samsung next. Whole bunch of others. But this is his, like, I'm going to be a CEO again and co founder. Okay, but why don't we say, why don't we suspend doubt on who this individual is for a minute? Low carbon. This is like a tokenized carbon sort of platform, right? So this is sort of a public goods refi type angle.
00:58:34.814 - 00:58:35.442, Speaker A: Oh, that's cool.
00:58:35.496 - 00:58:43.614, Speaker B: Oh, I like, maybe. Maybe this is Adam Newman's great rebrand. All right. He's going to make a comeback.
00:58:43.742 - 00:58:52.470, Speaker A: Maybe. We'll have to see. I do think it's kind of cool. I guess. What could go wrong? Even if it is a big Ponzi scheme, we clean up the world a little bit.
00:58:52.620 - 00:59:01.640, Speaker B: There are worse Ponzi's out there. A Ponzi scheme that makes people money, doesn't collapse, and also cleans up the world is what Kevin Owalki would call a good.
00:59:02.570 - 00:59:05.238, Speaker A: That it's that middle part that's hard, doesn't collapse.
00:59:05.414 - 00:59:06.506, Speaker B: That's the hard part.
00:59:06.608 - 00:59:18.682, Speaker A: We got to learn more about it, to be fair. But that is the news that it was Adam Newman this week and a 16 c founded Starquare. They just announced a series D at an $8 billion valuation.
00:59:18.826 - 00:59:20.734, Speaker B: What bear market? All right, what bear market?
00:59:20.852 - 00:59:23.642, Speaker A: $8 billion. Dude, that's insane.
00:59:23.706 - 00:59:27.220, Speaker B: Only a bear market in the bags that we hold, that's what's going on.
00:59:28.150 - 00:59:45.826, Speaker A: It hits public markets faster than privates. These private valuations will take a few months. To catch up. I think this is true, but standard crypto, this is another crypto fund. They just raised a casual $500 million as well. So the private equity keeps chugging, man. It's only public markets that are suffering.
00:59:46.018 - 00:59:53.338, Speaker B: Won't one public fund care about the crypto prices? Can you just buy the crypto? So they stopped going down at some point?
00:59:53.424 - 01:00:02.470, Speaker A: Some of them should. I don't know if that's in their charter, but it's a little lopsided right now. David, we got some hot stuff coming up next, though, including our new segment, questions from the nation.
01:00:02.550 - 01:00:02.906, Speaker B: Love it.
01:00:02.928 - 01:00:09.486, Speaker A: All right, so some questions from bankless listeners to us. We're going to read those out and try our best to answer them. What else we got?
01:00:09.588 - 01:00:20.194, Speaker B: We also got some bullish takes from Vance Spencer, which will, I think, also summarize the whole entire vibe of this very giggly weekly roll up. I say this week, Ryan, that's just you. Yeah, that's just me.
01:00:20.232 - 01:00:21.490, Speaker A: I'm stone faced.
01:00:21.830 - 01:01:15.122, Speaker B: We also got Dan Ellis, Mike Damaris from Rainbow, and Hayden Adams all discussing uniswap chain. Just a theory, just a theory. So those takes are coming up next. But before you do, if you haven't liked and subscribed from the first time we told you in this podcast, please go do this now as you listen to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible. Ave is the leading decentralized liquidity protocol, and now Ave V three is here. Ave V three has powerful new features to enable you to get the most out of DFI, including isolation mode, which allows for many more markets to be launched with more exotic collateral types, and also efficiency mode, which allows for higher loan to value ratios and of course, portals, allowing users to port their AAvE position across all of the networks that Aave operates on, like Polygon, Phantom, Avalanche, arbitrum, optimism and harmony. The beautiful thing about AAvE is that it's completely open source, decentralized, and governed by its community, enabling a truly bankless future for us all.
01:01:15.122 - 01:01:48.010, Speaker B: To get your first cryptocuralized loan, get started@ave.com. That's aave.com. And also check out the Ave protocol governance forums to see what more than 100,000 Dow members are all robbing about at governance ave.com. Arbitrum is an ethereum L2 scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use DFI and NFts. Over 300 projects have already deployed to arbitrum, and the DFI and NFT ecosystems are growing rapidly. Some of the coolest and newest NFT collections have chosen arbitrum as their home. All the while, DFI protocols continue to see increased usage and liquidity.
01:01:48.010 - 01:02:41.066, Speaker B: Using arbitrum has never been easier, especially with the ability to deposit directly into arbitram through all the exchanges, including binance, FTX, Huobi, and crypto.com. Once inside, you'll notice arbitram increases Ethereum speed by orders of magnitude for a fraction of the cost of the average gas fee. If you're a developer who wants low gas fees and instant transactions for your users, visit Arbitrum IO slash developer to start building your DAP on arbitrum if you're a dgen, many of your favorite dapps on Ethereum are already on Arbitrum, with many moving over every day. Go to bridge arbitrum IO now to start bridging over your eth and other tokens in order to experience defi Nfts in the way it was always meant to be. Fast, cheap, secure, and friction free. Living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys, and that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallet. And brand new to the ledger lineup of hardware wallets is the Ledger Nanos Plus, a huge upgrade to the world's most popular hardware wallet.
01:02:41.066 - 01:03:15.894, Speaker B: With more memory and a larger screen, the Nanos plus makes it easy to navigate and verify your transactions. And the paired Ledger live desktop app gives you increased transparency as to what is about to happen with your NFT. What you see is what you sign. The Nanos plus gives you the smoothest possible user experience while you're doing all of your crypto things. So go to the Ledger website to check out the features of the new Ledger Nanos plus and join the waitlist to get yours. And don't forget about the crypto life card. Also powered by Ledger, the CL card is a crypto debit card that hooks right into the ledger live app, right next to all the defi apps and services that you're already used to doing, like swapping tokens and staking.
01:03:15.894 - 01:03:22.010, Speaker B: So if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet, go to ledger.com, grab a ledger, and take control over your crypto.
01:03:22.750 - 01:03:52.838, Speaker A: All right, guys, we are back with the questions of the week. And just as a reminder, if you want to get in the next roll up, you got to ask your question on Twitter. I think we got 65 of them this time around, David, but this is the one we picked. It's got a lot of likes. Now I'll read you the question. Maybe you can give your shot at answering first, why is there, this is from data underscore always on Twitter. Why is there so much incomplete and misinformation in the space and around the merge? What's up with that misinformation about the Ethereum merge? Why?
01:03:52.924 - 01:04:34.162, Speaker B: Yeah, this has always been perplexing to me. So I understand why this question, where this question is coming from and why it's getting so many likes. Ethereum is perplexingly misunderstood, not just about the merge, but persistently all of the time. And to why that has happened is a big mystery. The only thing that I really have to say about that is my two answers that seem reasonable to me is that the EF being like, the one thing that started Ethereum doesn't really do comms or communications or anything. And so as there is official, there is no ministry of truth of Ethereum. Right? And so Ethereum has the Ethereum team, but the Ethereum team is modular and distributed in of itself.
01:04:34.162 - 01:05:05.294, Speaker B: Because every single client team represents one component of Ethereum, there is no center of Ethereum to have these comms coming from. And so instead, that responsibility falls on the shoulders of media people, people like Tim Baco, who leads all core devs call, and then we report it here on bankless. Anthony Cesano does a fantastic job. The re finance community is fantastically well informed if you're trying to get high signal communities. But other than that, if you don't listen to those sources, that's about it.
01:05:05.412 - 01:05:11.630, Speaker A: Yeah. Do you know how the White House has a press secretary? There is no press secretary for Ethereum whatsoever.
01:05:12.290 - 01:05:40.194, Speaker B: Not at all. And then the other way that I will also explain this is just for the crypto industry at large. I've talked about this in other capacities. I view the crypto world as like concentric circles where at the very center you have the core beating heart of what makes crypto tick. Permissionlessness, decentralization, blockchain networks that imbue all the properties of crypto. And then, you know, bitcoin and ethereum, and that's really at the core center. And then you have all the people that surround those core values.
01:05:40.194 - 01:06:04.762, Speaker B: Like, I would put us there, Ryan, like, again, Anthony Cesano, people that really care about these values. And then there was like one more concentric circle out that are like, okay, there's something here, there's something really valuable here. Let me add my flavor to it and make a lot of money from it. And those are like, I would call that the terra luna ecosystem, which is like, yeah, crypto algo stablecoins. It's kind of a ponzi at the end of the day. But it's not true about decentralization. It's not really about the core ethos of crypto.
01:06:04.762 - 01:06:32.334, Speaker B: And those people surround the inner circle, and those people make a bunch of noise because they want to suck up attention and put their attention on their thing because they're here to make a bunch of money. And so there's this crust of grifters around the core beating heart of crypto that is taking the value out of crypto and redirecting people away from the center to go to the grifter side of the crypto community. And then they just make a lot of money over there. And that is my explanation.
01:06:32.482 - 01:06:55.290, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's a good explanation. I think high level. That's probably what I would say too. The only thing I'd add is it probably depends on what specific piece of incomplete or misinformation you're talking about. And you could probably take that piece of information and put it in one of the camps, like one of the categories. So, for instance, one thing that's often said is the merch will reduce gas fees. No, it won't.
01:06:55.370 - 01:06:58.502, Speaker B: Technically 10%. Actually it's a 10% scaling.
01:06:58.586 - 01:06:59.986, Speaker A: That's not what people mean.
01:07:00.168 - 01:07:01.346, Speaker B: Maybe that's where it comes from.
01:07:01.368 - 01:07:17.110, Speaker A: I just did it right. And they'll be like, well, and so where does that come from? It's probably just some wishful thinking people just not understanding, there being no official communication. It's probably that it might also be like post merge.
01:07:17.450 - 01:07:25.258, Speaker B: People think that it's Ethereum 2.0 and previously Ethereum 2.0 used to have sharding and that would have reduced gas fees. So there's miscommunication there.
01:07:25.344 - 01:07:48.894, Speaker A: Exactly. And then the incomplete thing. Why can't we just get a date on the merge? Why not? And I think that's nothing malicious. It's not like a community flooding. That's just like we're coming to consensus on what the date actually is and we don't know. And there's no spokesperson for Ethereum. But then you get something else, like the merch will never happen or will always remain proof of stake.
01:07:48.894 - 01:08:15.018, Speaker A: And some of these things are proof of work, some of these things are more malicious. It's like just completely uninformed and verging on like ethereum will never ship, nothing ever happens. Vitalik mans all the master nodes, this sort of thing. And so it's this confluence of reasons, and you almost have to go through the specific piece of misinformation and throw it in one of these buckets. But some total. I think you're right.
01:08:15.104 - 01:08:31.610, Speaker B: Yeah. And this is why I call the crypto world. Like, navigating the crypto world is navigating the dark forest. Right. You can't trust every bit of information that comes to you. You need to learn how to do your own research and verify for yourself, which is a fantastic skill to have. There is no nine year schooling for crypto.
01:08:31.610 - 01:08:52.946, Speaker B: You got to figure it out. And that's why the crypto culture is so strong, Ryan, because that's what separates us from society. The crypto Twitter, the crypto culture, the crypto communities that all, like, we can speak crypto. We know the words. We know the terminology. We've made it through the other side of the dark forest, right? And so we have that shared story of, like, yes, we all went through the gamut. We all went through the dark forest.
01:08:52.946 - 01:09:09.210, Speaker B: We figured out how to reason about it. We know what's right and what's wrong, and communities that agree with what's right, like, gang up together. That's also why we're so different from society. Right? We have this big handshake with each other. We all made it through the dark forest of learning how to navigate crypto.
01:09:09.630 - 01:09:28.138, Speaker A: I think that's true. I will say, though, that's just for me. That's just for crypto. Right. Another example is I start to doubt all of the other news sources that I get because, like, not experts in all of these various other things. I see the headline, like, oh, okay, I guess this is what's it's. My dad was asking me.
01:09:28.138 - 01:09:48.646, Speaker A: I'd spent some time with him last week in Florida. He's like, okay, so the Coinbase wasn't going bankrupt. What was that thing? I saw it on all my news, and I'm like, no, dad, they're not going, like, we pay close attention. This. These are all the reasons why. This is why it was misreported. And it just calls into question all of the other headlines that I'm not an expert in.
01:09:48.646 - 01:10:15.010, Speaker A: With all of these various eras, whether it's science or technology, it's like, what kind of stuff are we actually being fed? The one thing I'm knowledgeable about. And we could see how it's completely farcical, nonsensical, misinformation. How many other things do I just take at? Surface information is a very difficult thing, and good information is a very difficult thing to parse through and figure out in this day and age.
01:10:15.080 - 01:10:37.634, Speaker B: Yeah. And I really, actually love this discussion. Crypto gives you an insane vantage point to view the whole rest of the world. Like, we understand global relations because of just how our blockchains span all borders. We understand economics because our blocks or our prices respond to global economic forces. So we have to understand that. But also we have internal economics into the blockchain network.
01:10:37.634 - 01:10:51.658, Speaker B: We got to understand computer science. You have to understand sociology and tribalism. And once you make it through the dark forest, I feel like post learning about crypto and getting to the other side and being informed about crypto, I feel like I know at least a little bit of almost anything about the world.
01:10:51.744 - 01:11:02.686, Speaker A: Oh, dude, this is 21st century life skills. I 100% guarantee this is university. This is way better than don't drop it at school, kids, get your degree. But also.
01:11:02.788 - 01:11:04.078, Speaker B: No, totally do it. Totally do it.
01:11:04.084 - 01:11:09.150, Speaker A: Totally do it. Get a job in crypto. That was only the first question. The second question.
01:11:09.220 - 01:11:32.374, Speaker B: Second question. What are three things ideas that Ryan and David strongly disagree or clash on? Three things is a lot. There was one time where Ryan and I got into a debate about how gas fees come to be. How does the value of the gas fee come to? Not how it's calculated, but just like, what is the price of a gas fee? And does it depend on. What was that debate?
01:11:32.422 - 01:12:05.640, Speaker A: Actually, it was a debate. So I think you were saying basically that ETH price and gas fees are kind of one in the same market, very close. And I was saying they're not the same market, they're separate markets. They're correlated at some stages, but they are completely separate, like blocks based demand. It was a really geeky conversation and kind of a debate. I feel like we realized at the end of that thing that we should have been recording it, because a lot of people have this question, and I'm almost tempted to rehash it. I've come to the conclusion, David, that I'm still right about that.
01:12:07.690 - 01:12:39.370, Speaker B: Okay. I was saying that when ETH price goes up ten times, gas prices will also go up ten times. If you hold gas the same, like ten Guaya at $100 versus ten guaya at $1,000, gas fees goes up by roughly a factor of ten x. Yes, these markets are correlated. Ones float off of each other. But when everyone who's holding ETH is the person paying the gas fee. I would love to hear somebody make a tweet thread about this to answer this question in more depth.
01:12:39.450 - 01:12:46.450, Speaker A: Actually, if you guys would like to hear David and I debate this. If David still feels very strongly about that, maybe we'll record a one off podcast.
01:12:47.430 - 01:12:52.322, Speaker B: The funny thing is, of all things to debate about, it's one that just does not matter.
01:12:52.456 - 01:12:56.120, Speaker A: Is there anything. I'm trying to think of anything else, like major.
01:12:57.610 - 01:13:03.880, Speaker B: We have different stylistic choices on the podcast, so there's that. But that also works out.
01:13:04.570 - 01:13:05.506, Speaker A: Yang and yang.
01:13:05.618 - 01:13:06.710, Speaker B: It's a tug of war.
01:13:06.860 - 01:13:25.338, Speaker A: Yeah. You know, I use like, gas and brakes, right? Sometimes you're more gas and you're like, we should buy with everything at this moment. And I'm just like, well, are you sure about that? And the beauty is, sometimes you're right and sometimes I'm right. And on balance, we're more often more correct.
01:13:25.424 - 01:13:32.080, Speaker B: Yeah. And either way, we have fun along the way. But I wouldn't say that strongly disagree on. I think it's a gas thing that we only really strongly disagree on.
01:13:32.690 - 01:13:40.834, Speaker A: The Lost podcast will probably never happen. David, let's get to some takes, man. So this is a really hot take. I like this. Could you read it out for us?
01:13:40.872 - 01:14:08.460, Speaker B: Yeah. Yuga Labs is valued at a higher valuation than what Disney paid for for the entire Star Wars Ip. That's a lot of growth embedded into the board ape ecosystem, when you put it that way. Does that mean that anyone who is holding an ape and holding apecoin and all of that stuff are saying that at some point in time, the board apes IP will become equivalent to Star Wars? I think that's what you mean.
01:14:08.990 - 01:14:11.020, Speaker A: I don't know. I just feel like asking.
01:14:12.270 - 01:14:18.190, Speaker B: Look, I'm bullish on eth, but I am not bullish as much as the board ape ecosystem is on the board ape ecosystem.
01:14:19.650 - 01:14:35.182, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree with that. We'll see what happens. Look, the test of an ecosystem ranking communities. Can you survive? A bear is where this is the fiery crucible. Right? So it's happening now. This is a great take from Eric Connor. I'm glad he's back on Twitter.
01:14:35.182 - 01:14:53.354, Speaker A: I'll read this out and maybe comment. So much negativity towards defi lately. God, I've noticed that too many people are questioning what benefits it actually offers. Annoyed to see it. Honestly, permissionless access to financial tools for anyone in the world is powerful enough to have extreme meaning and staying power.
01:14:53.552 - 01:15:13.722, Speaker B: I think the take here is that the Overton window is shifting. As in like, yeah, people have gotten used to permissionlessness and Defi financial tools and now we're like, we want more, give us more things. And that's just the new norm. And so the people who are having negativity towards Defi. Like, oh, it's just like borrowing and lending in Aave. Oh, it's just like trading on uniswap. Reminder.
01:15:13.722 - 01:15:16.970, Speaker B: Those are big deals. That's a huge big.
01:15:17.060 - 01:15:35.318, Speaker A: We didn't have that three years ago, guys. This is amazing. I think it's one of those cases where narrative follows price, and so Defi prices are in the dump. So everyone's like, defi was never cool. It was never a thing. Who cares? It's not world changing at. No, no.
01:15:35.318 - 01:16:02.094, Speaker A: This tech, like, decentralized, bankless money, a bankless financial system, this is, like, the biggest innovation since the original Internet. This is absolutely massive. It's going to change how human beings coordinate across the world for generations to come. This is an absolutely huge deal. And so it's another example of. Remember the people we said earlier was saying, like, yeah, uniswap will never work. Smart contracts will never be a thing.
01:16:02.094 - 01:16:07.460, Speaker A: Defi will never be a thing. Okay, cool. No, you hit it. Hit it.
01:16:08.070 - 01:16:09.954, Speaker B: That's actually not the one I was going for.
01:16:10.072 - 01:16:25.590, Speaker A: Well, that's the one. I feel like that's how it falls for me when I hear them say this. And it's just like, man narratives are so overplayed and so boring. I'm glad we're back on the contrarian side of things, though, David. It feels good. Feels like home.
01:16:25.660 - 01:16:31.610, Speaker B: Yeah. That is where I feel very comfy. It's bear market contrarian vibes.
01:16:32.030 - 01:16:32.506, Speaker A: All right.
01:16:32.528 - 01:16:51.566, Speaker B: Okay. Dan Ellis says. Dan Ellis is the guy that wrote this thing that kind of called the defi bull market before it happened. Superphonic superfluid collateral. No, superfluid collateral, which is relevant, but also hydrophonic yield farming. He basically called yield farming before it happened. And he also called superfluid collateral before it happened.
01:16:51.566 - 01:17:11.218, Speaker B: So when Dan elser says something, I listen. That guy is like. He only gets loud on things he has high conviction on. He's always been right. This is actually completely irrelevant from this. But he didn't make an article. He didn't write an article this time around, but he made a tweet, which I thought was really interesting, and he goes, uni chain is inevitable.
01:17:11.218 - 01:17:29.098, Speaker B: There are three costs to Dex traders. The swap fees. That's like the 0.3% that you pay to the Uniswap liquidity providers. There's also the transaction fee and gas, and you also pay me v. So if you get, like, sandwiched, or if you get front run by validators who are doing mev, then you pay them a fee as well. Basically.
01:17:29.098 - 01:18:00.762, Speaker B: And so today, Dan Elsner continues saying today uni holders can only flip the switch to take part in number one. So only one of the three revenue sources and also probably the smallest one. And he finishes with two and three being transaction fees. And mev payments are more attractive long term and better align the chain. And so this is why he says uni chain is inevitable. Because if Uniswap puts Uniswap on a uni chain, it gets access to one, two and three. And so uni token can be like the currency of Uniswap.
01:18:00.846 - 01:18:02.726, Speaker A: Would this be like a L2 or something like this?
01:18:02.748 - 01:18:38.690, Speaker B: This would be like a L2, yeah. An application specific L2. Think of like, I don't know if Uniswap went on to an application specific ZK roll up, it would be like the APIs of L2 liquidity for Uniswap. Right. And so you could go right into it and then Uniswap would get the trading fees and then the mev on all that ecosystem. It's basically like the Uniswap universe on L2. And I bet you actually, now that I'm thinking about this, Uniswap does produce the first meaningful ZK application specific ZK roll up that is engaged with other roll ups on L2.
01:18:38.690 - 01:19:05.580, Speaker B: Mike Menderis from Rainbow Wallet goes, would that mean either accepting death of composability or that unichain will become competitive and hostile to Ethereum? And Hayden says that sort of assumes that cross chain composability won't ever exist. Is that a tweet from Hayden Adams Ryan, because it's a tweet or is it because he knows what he's talking about and this is something that they are actively discussing inside of uniswap TBD? I don't know.
01:19:06.750 - 01:19:27.182, Speaker A: I wouldn't be surprised. It does seem like that would be a huge barrier to basically like, I guess you're not entirely leaving the Ethereum economy, but you're leaving all of. And I don't know that this would mean leaving. I guess you could launch a chain that's kind of a L2 in addition to everything that you're doing on Ethereum main chain and other L2s.
01:19:27.246 - 01:19:41.046, Speaker B: Well, this thing about Uniswap, like going into it and becoming its own chain, fits in the roll up centric roadmap of Ethereum model where applications can become chains. That is like a new thought that actually I'm just having right now in this roll up.
01:19:41.148 - 01:20:18.660, Speaker A: I guess just here's where it kind of breaks my mental model. Right. It's sort of like a company gets big enough, like a Facebook gets big enough, and then they're like, well, we should just become our own nation, and we'll create our own money, and then that'll give us maximal control. And all of these things, what they sort of forget is like, okay, but people don't want to live in the Facebook nation because they don't have good representation, because it's owned by stakeholders and that sort of thing. It kind of breaks my brain a little bit, I guess. This is like uniswap saying, this would be like them saying, hey, we want to be a state in the union of the.
01:20:19.030 - 01:20:37.138, Speaker B: That's actually not how I see it. That's not how I see it. Okay, so I see it as optimistic roll ups becoming that optimistic, as generalized roll ups. Optimistic roll ups are like flat land. There's a lot of real estate there. They have their own internal gas fee markets. They have space to build your thing because it's generalized.
01:20:37.138 - 01:20:57.678, Speaker B: With an application specific ZK roll up. It doesn't operate like land. I think you wouldn't leave your assets there. It's more like, I don't know where the optimistic roll ups are, like, wide and flat, and they have real estate for you to settle on. Application specific ZK roll ups are very long and tall, and they're something that you ping and then you send something back.
01:20:57.764 - 01:21:02.574, Speaker A: What do you mean, application specific ZK? You're just talking about, like, DyDx or something like this? Yes.
01:21:02.612 - 01:21:09.714, Speaker B: Like one single ZK roll up that does one thing, and in the unichain world, it is uniswap. So it's uniswap as a ZK roll up.
01:21:09.752 - 01:21:16.306, Speaker A: Well, I guess we're kind of repeating this conversation that they just had, because then I want to be like, but wouldn't that mean they lose composability from.
01:21:16.328 - 01:21:18.882, Speaker B: All the other apps, not from L2s?
01:21:19.026 - 01:21:23.910, Speaker A: Yeah. And then Hayden goes, well, that assumes cross chain composability won't exist. Right?
01:21:23.980 - 01:21:28.520, Speaker B: Roll up centric roadmap of. We just. We just speed ran that whole entire thing.
01:21:30.650 - 01:21:33.910, Speaker A: These guys already thought about that. I guess that's why they're the defi.
01:21:34.270 - 01:21:36.460, Speaker B: It's a wise to take in the roll up.
01:21:37.550 - 01:21:41.430, Speaker A: Let's do this one. Man. This is pretty cool. This is a graphic that I really liked.
01:21:41.510 - 01:21:45.694, Speaker B: Yeah. 13 years. The tweet says 13 years of w three b. What does that mean?
01:21:45.812 - 01:21:47.200, Speaker A: I don't know what that means.
01:21:47.730 - 01:22:11.942, Speaker B: Web three. Web three? Yeah, web3. Web three. And NfT converted into a 24 hours clock. So for the listeners, we're just looking at a clock where 12:00 is the birth of bitcoin and then right to the left of it, as in where we currently are, like, 1159 is like the launch of Coinbase NFT platform. And it kind of just takes you through the history and lets you put things into relationship with each other in time. So that's pretty cool.
01:22:11.996 - 01:22:35.258, Speaker A: I like that visualization. So, like, midnight is the birth of bitcoin. All right? And the very first non fungible token that we ever got was bitcoin bit. Okay? This was even pre ethereum. And that happened at 04:00 a.m. In the morning that day. All right? And the very first ERC 721 that we got didn't happen until 16:00.
01:22:35.258 - 01:22:36.094, Speaker A: What is that?
01:22:36.132 - 01:22:38.858, Speaker B: That's 16:00.
01:22:38.954 - 01:22:59.558, Speaker A: It's 16:00. How do I read military time? 1600 hours. That's 04:00 p.m. 04:00 p.m. That was the first ERC 721. All right, so, like, 04:00 p.m. And now basically six minutes from midnight, that's sort of when Coinbase just launched their NFT platform.
01:22:59.558 - 01:23:06.486, Speaker A: It's kind of a cool depiction of the eras and how early things were before and still how early things are now.
01:23:06.668 - 01:23:16.678, Speaker B: They don't have any l ones. Why don't they have the genesis of ethereum? Where is that? That's got to be like somewhere at 09:00 a.m.. Yeah, we should make our own bankless dow.
01:23:16.774 - 01:23:17.242, Speaker A: Great idea.
01:23:17.296 - 01:23:24.954, Speaker B: $500 in bank to anyone who makes this and updates that. I'll commit to that. Somebody in the bankless dow do that and then ping me when you guys and I'll send you some bank token.
01:23:25.082 - 01:23:29.200, Speaker A: Amazing. All right, David, what are you bullish on, man? Besides this clock here?
01:23:30.690 - 01:23:55.638, Speaker B: I'm bullish on this new podcast, not from bankless, actually, it's called alfalfa, and it's for my friends that I've made in San Diego. And so they have been grinding away at their alfalfa podcast and I've been listening to. It's been getting better and better. Takes are becoming hotter and hotter. They're into like 20 something late 20 episodes. And so I said, yo, guys, come over and we'll record a podcast in my apartment. And I finally got to use my soundboard thing that I really, really like.
01:23:55.638 - 01:24:13.526, Speaker B: And so we recorded an alfalfa Bankless podcast, which is going to come onto the YouTube sometime soon. And it's an all in style podcast, and so they are very much bankless listeners, but they're also bankless skeptics at the same time. They play in things that like Ryan and I generally don't. They're a little bit more degen.
01:24:13.558 - 01:24:14.858, Speaker A: How they do with Luna.
01:24:14.874 - 01:24:31.886, Speaker B: David, they all escaped Luna except for one. All except for one. One guy got caught up in Luna, but he's not a complete degen, so there's only a small portion of his backs. But also they also talk about things like real estate markets and also kind of how the all in podcast does also like politics. And so they get into.
01:24:31.908 - 01:24:35.910, Speaker A: This is starting to sound like another Bankless podcast launch. Is that what this is going to turn into here?
01:24:35.980 - 01:24:48.566, Speaker B: Well, that is potentially a potential future. So if you are a consumer of crypto content, which you are, you might like this podcast, but you should start with the one that we put on the bankless YouTube in about a week or so. TBD on that. Just stay tuned. I'm really excited about it. I'm really bullish on.
01:24:48.748 - 01:24:49.382, Speaker A: Awesome.
01:24:49.516 - 01:24:51.530, Speaker B: Awesome. Ryan, what are you bullish?
01:24:53.230 - 01:25:22.414, Speaker A: Forgot. I'm going to steal Vance Spencer's take as the thing I'm bullish on and add my own thing because we forgot to cover this in the take section. This is a tweet from Vance Spencer, and I think it echoes my sentiments as well. He's coming on the show, by the way, so maybe we'll talk about this. He says this crypto is exactly where it needs to be right now. Very much not dead, very much alive, washing out the excesses, very much building things. People want to use coiled spring on a path to hypergrowth.
01:25:22.414 - 01:26:00.382, Speaker A: I think that's why if you're a unicycler and you've heard David and I in the last few roll ups when we've been very clearly in a b market, right, bear market, a build market, whatever, how we're so excited. We're so excited right now because the last b market that we were in, it felt like things could actually fall apart. Like it felt like Defi might not actually ever work, ethereum, the project might not ever scale. We would never find product market fit. And the whole bitcoin experiment was maybe, or the whole crypto experiment was maybe bitcoin, if we're lucky. And that would take years to recover. All right.
01:26:00.382 - 01:26:30.710, Speaker A: This is a very different feeling entering this bear market, and I couldn't say it better than Vance Spencer just says it right here, coiled spring on a path to hyper growth. We are washing out the excesses. We are building things people want to use. The hardest part of the whole thing, the whole thing in a new product, in anything. The birth of the Internet, like birth of Google, birth of any of these transformational. Uber is product market fit. Once you have product market fit, there's going to be cycles.
01:26:30.710 - 01:26:48.270, Speaker A: Now it's just a matter of scaling. We have product market fit. Now we're just scaling. So I've never entered a bear market with more confidence. And you know what that leads me to is the thing I am bullish on is I feel like this is the last time this is going to happen. All right. Ether in the 1000 range.
01:26:48.270 - 01:27:10.694, Speaker A: Look, I'm going to say it, david, I know David disagrees on this. Ether could dip into triple digit territory once again. We could go below 1000. I'm not saying it will. I'm not saying that'll happen, okay? I'm saying if it does happen, back the truck up. All right? Not financial advice, all right? Some other kind of advice for you, maybe life advice for you. I don't know.
01:27:10.694 - 01:27:42.058, Speaker A: I'm just saying this is the last opportunity that we'll ever have. It's this bear market. And I'm thankful, honestly, I'm thankful that a whole bunch of listeners who got in the first cycle, the last two years, a whole bunch of people who got into crypto, now they can prove their metal and they'll have an opportunity that previous generations have had. Right? It feels more fair that way. I'm glad we didn't just zoom all the way up to ten k and then pass that and see you later. Everybody else, you have another opportunity here. And this means be responsible.
01:27:42.058 - 01:27:53.140, Speaker A: Dollar cost average in, that's what you want. Like buy good assets. But think of this as the last great generational opportunity, buying opportunity, because that's what it is.
01:27:53.670 - 01:28:32.350, Speaker B: And this is why I've been saying this is the greatest bear market of all time. So much is going to get built, people are going to get jobs in crypto, people are going to get paid, and people are going to buy cheap east in ways that they'd never had that availability before. I remember after my first bear market or going into my first bear market in 2018, it's like, oh, okay, that was a cycle. It's not the future. I'm wrecked now. I'm not going to put out numbers, but I had an amount of eth that I had and I was like, by the time the next bull market comes around, I'm going to have ten times the amount. And that was like, a lot of money for me at the time, and that was actually cutting it short.
01:28:32.350 - 01:29:10.810, Speaker B: I made more than ten times the target that I had going through the bear market. And so think bigger dreams going into the bear market. Think about what you want to get done and just grind for that and work hard, because when you grind in the bear market, you turn into flowers. You grow flowers in the bull market. And so this is why we're so excited. This is such an awesome time to be in the crypto space when so much gets built and there's such little noise. One of the reasons why bull markets always end is because it becomes a meme, right? It turns into a self reflexive loop, as in like, oh, there's these things that people are just throwing money into, and they're doing that because other people are throwing money into them.
01:29:10.810 - 01:29:39.960, Speaker B: Therefore, I will produce this thing that they will throw money into. And the more that that self reflects on itself and turns into a loop over and over again. Like, how can I make the thing that people put the most money in the fastest? That is literally the opposite of long term time horizons. And so now that that is fully dead, we have products that are going to be built for things that people are like, oh, maybe I'm going to build a thing that people are going to put money into, hold it there for five to ten years and keep it there. And that is called Ryan fundamentals. And that is why this is a build market.
01:29:40.490 - 01:29:58.266, Speaker A: Absolutely. David and I are bullish on the bear market. That's the end of things. You were talking about memes. David, here's the meme of the week here, you and I, this popped out. I think the bankless HQ Twitter posted, captioned this. I saw some great captions, I saw some embarrassing ones.
01:29:58.266 - 01:29:59.514, Speaker A: But what are we looking at here?
01:29:59.632 - 01:30:19.534, Speaker B: It's us doing, I think, the weekly roll up, or it was recording the intro to Vlad with Robin Hood. And you're talking into the camera and I'm just looking at you for some reason. I'm biting my lift, dude, and I don't know why. The caption is, you feel uncomfortable. Yeah, the caption is that you are Eth and I am L2.
01:30:19.732 - 01:30:33.826, Speaker A: There you go. Yeah, I see it. And I hope this becomes a meme of the ages, guys, this has been the weekly roll up. It was fun to do one in person. We are back to our regular schedule where we are a coast away. You're going to be on the east coast next time, David.
01:30:33.938 - 01:30:41.770, Speaker B: No, I'm going to be in Seattle for a little bit because I guess my stuff has to get there. I have no idea where it is. I'm going to be floating around in the world for the next two weeks.
01:30:41.920 - 01:30:54.602, Speaker A: I do know, though, none of this, of course, has been financial advice. Risks and disclaimers bitcoin ETh is risky. It's very volatile. You could lose what you put in. But we're headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone.
01:30:54.602 - 01:30:57.774, Speaker A: But we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
