00:00:00.170 - 00:00:23.802, Speaker A: Arbitrum drama. Here's a tweet. Arbitrum foundation made a proposal to allocate 750,000,000 ARB tokens for admin and operational costs, but Arbitrum holders voted against it. Now, they said that the vote was just a formality and they have already spent 50 million tokens. Your vote is not a vote. And Arbitrum team says this AIP number one wasn't actually a proposal, it's just a formality.
00:00:23.866 - 00:00:33.954, Speaker B: All of the decisions were made before the token went live and before the Dow went live. It was silly for this to even go to a vote, to be honest, because it set the obviously wrong expectations.
00:00:34.082 - 00:00:44.500, Speaker A: Crypto people love drama. $1 billion worth of tokens getting sold by Arbitrum. Like, very hot thing to Tweet. It was really easy to turn this into a very viral, dramatic event.
