00:00:00.250 - 00:00:05.214, Speaker A: You. What up?
00:00:05.252 - 00:00:58.270, Speaker B: Coordination on the pod. Today. We got Alan from Encointer. We are going to be talking about local community currencies on the podcast and Cointer has two pilots, one going on in Zurich and another one going on in Rwanda in which they're doing community currencies on the order of 200 members in the Zurich pilot. And there's lot of interesting things happening here a actual data about how this stuff is being used on civil resistance, on the economics, on user experience and we dive in and pull all of those threads on this episode. So I think that I'm really bullish on community currencies. I think that there's a really beautiful opportunity for community currencies to create little pockets of value that are oriented around local values instead of global values that come from global commodified currencies like the USD or the Euro or Bitcoin.
00:00:58.270 - 00:01:36.938, Speaker B: I think that with global currencies you kind of get this race to the bottom of the brainstem of things that everyone in the world likes. Things like pizza and beer and not everyone in the world likes these things, but they're an example of like a globally commodified thing. And so what if we could create local community currencies around local values, whatever your local town values or maybe whatever your local internet community values if you index on locality of the meme space instead of physical space. So local community currencies I think is a theme that you'll see on the Green Pill podcast over the next couple of quarters and Incointer is doing so really, really fun episode with Alan and I think you're going to enjoy it as well. Without further ado, I give you the Encounter team.
00:01:37.024 - 00:02:17.886, Speaker C: The Glow Dollar is a new stablecoin with a very special property. As the market cap of Glow goes up, extreme poverty goes down. Glow is a dollar backed nonprofit stablecoin that creates basic income for people living in extreme poverty. Glow is basically the same business model as USDC with yield generating treasuries on one side and a stablecoin on ethereum on the other. But instead of being a for profit company, glow is a nonprofit that donates 100% of all yields from the Glow Reserve to Give Directly's basic Income program. Give Directly is a charity that gives people money, no strings attached to people living in poverty, and is a charity that Vitalik has previously donated to and supported in the past. With Glow, you can reduce poverty just by holding a stablecoin.
00:02:17.886 - 00:02:41.054, Speaker C: Glow is launching in early 2023 and you can join the Waitlist@glowdollar.org greenpill. That's glodollar.org greenpill. Working in web3 is awesome, but working outside of the typical W Two employee structure is a deal breaker for so many. Opolis is helping the self sovereign worker focus on what they do best their work. Tax time is coming up.

00:03:31.226 - 00:03:32.058, Speaker A: What's up, Alan?
00:03:32.154 - 00:03:39.380, Speaker B: Let's dive into encounter. So tell us about the why, what, how of how it works.
00:03:40.710 - 00:03:57.850, Speaker A: Yeah, so Encounter is about lowering inequality in the world. So big vision of it. And the way it does this is.
00:03:57.920 - 00:04:03.370, Speaker D: By issuing a basic income in local community currencies.
00:04:05.070 - 00:04:08.380, Speaker A: So in a way, it's kind of.
00:04:09.230 - 00:04:15.086, Speaker D: A culmination of what I observed in Crypto, what was happening, that made me.
00:04:15.108 - 00:04:29.730, Speaker A: Think about how money works and why it tends to accumulate capital on very few people and how we could do it differently.
00:04:32.710 - 00:04:39.640, Speaker B: All right, so let's dig a little bit deeper. How does it work and how does that change that problem?
00:04:40.730 - 00:04:45.526, Speaker A: So, if we want to issue a.
00:04:45.548 - 00:04:55.034, Speaker D: Basic income, we want to make sure that two things the basic income needs to have value, real value that people can use.
00:04:55.232 - 00:04:58.442, Speaker A: But also we need to be sure.
00:04:58.496 - 00:05:11.166, Speaker D: That each person only gets that income once. So that's the cyber resistance that we need. And I think the key contribution of.
00:05:11.268 - 00:05:22.130, Speaker A: Encounter is how it solves the cyber pack. And that's by physical, concurrent key signing meetups.
00:05:22.470 - 00:05:36.040, Speaker D: So if you want that basic income, you need to join a community, and it's a local community, so maybe we can talk later about why it is important that these are local.
00:05:37.050 - 00:05:44.214, Speaker A: So you need to be at a certain place at a certain time every.
00:05:44.252 - 00:06:16.674, Speaker D: Ten days, currently in your neighborhood, so you never have to go really far. But you need to meet a random bunch of people, and then you just attest each other's personhood you attest each other's attendance of that key signing meetup. And because all the meetups happen at the same time, you cannot attend two meetups. So that's really leveraging the physics of each person can only be in one.
00:06:16.712 - 00:06:22.694, Speaker A: Place at one time. And that's how we solve the cyber attack. Got it? Yeah.
00:06:22.732 - 00:06:47.120, Speaker B: I know that civil attacks are a big topic on this podcast just because one human, one vote systems are way more democratic than one token, one vote systems. And I think that we learned in our Brian Ford episode that there's four ways of creating civil resistance. There's KYC nation state government IDs, there's biometric, there's web of trust and there's presence based. So it seems like you at least have some element of presence based and maybe web of trust in there.
00:06:49.170 - 00:07:04.660, Speaker D: Well, web of trust does play a minor role, but really it is a presence based protocol. Why does it have to do with web of trust as well?
00:07:05.290 - 00:07:08.854, Speaker A: So if you want to join the.
00:07:08.892 - 00:07:26.090, Speaker D: Community, we always need to make sure that the majority is honest. That's just the basic assumption of our protocol. The majority can always bend the rules. So we rely on majority is honest.
00:07:26.240 - 00:07:30.862, Speaker A: And that means we somehow need to.
00:07:30.916 - 00:07:34.800, Speaker D: Limit how many people can join a new community.
00:07:36.610 - 00:07:40.206, Speaker A: Per cycle of proof of.
00:07:40.228 - 00:07:50.660, Speaker D: Personhood, so per ceremony. And that's where we use web of trust or kind of the social graph because we let people invite other people.
00:07:52.310 - 00:07:56.100, Speaker A: To join the protocol right.
00:07:59.910 - 00:08:04.150, Speaker D: Of proof of personhood or of cyber resistance.
00:08:05.370 - 00:08:09.994, Speaker A: Yeah, need that as well. Yeah.
00:08:10.032 - 00:08:13.500, Speaker B: So I mean, about how many people have been onboarded so far?
00:08:14.030 - 00:08:18.586, Speaker D: So far we have two communities, one.
00:08:18.608 - 00:08:28.974, Speaker A: In Zurich, one in Kigali, Rwanda, and in Zurich we have a well, right.
00:08:29.012 - 00:08:46.294, Speaker D: Now we have 200 reputables. That means 200 people who have attended at least once during the last five cycles. And that's kind of the constant population that we have.
00:08:46.332 - 00:08:57.720, Speaker A: Now, that may seem little, but it's just one city and we started in May.
00:08:58.830 - 00:09:10.134, Speaker D: And as it can only grow by one third per cycle, it can really only grow organically because of our trust.
00:09:10.192 - 00:09:18.974, Speaker A: Assumptions exponential over time. But yeah, well, we are still in the early days.
00:09:19.172 - 00:09:33.860, Speaker B: Yeah, I think you want to prove it out on a small scale first and only then kind of blow it up to web scale. So I'm curious if you could talk about the proof points that you have so far and how's the first population doing.
00:09:35.370 - 00:09:42.758, Speaker A: So, the population in Zurich is our pioneer community and I think it has.
00:09:42.844 - 00:09:48.634, Speaker D: Evolved pretty decently, especially also in terms.
00:09:48.672 - 00:09:52.522, Speaker A: Of who we could onboard and how.
00:09:52.576 - 00:10:20.594, Speaker D: People are using it. I would say our population is not dominated by crypto fans. So a lot of the people that participate don't care about crypto at all, but they care about the local identity, they care about basic income and about the whole story.
00:10:20.792 - 00:10:23.474, Speaker A: So, as I said, we started in.
00:10:23.512 - 00:10:57.438, Speaker D: March and we had a first acceptance point. So what we issue, the basic income we haven't talked about this so far is a currency called Loi, which in Zurich is at par with the Swiss franc. But that's just kind of a social agreement with the acceptance points. So we started with one acceptance point. That's a popular cafe close to my office. And they were really fond of the vision and they said, hey, you know what? We will accept Loy from day one.
00:10:57.604 - 00:10:58.878, Speaker A: And that's how we started.
00:10:58.964 - 00:11:02.846, Speaker D: So people got a basic income, and then they could go over to the.
00:11:02.868 - 00:11:05.502, Speaker A: Coffee and spend it on coffee.
00:11:05.566 - 00:11:10.962, Speaker D: So we started with 22 loy, which is 22 Swiss francs in buying power.
00:11:11.096 - 00:11:20.982, Speaker A: This would buy you five coffees or something like that. And then we went on from there.
00:11:21.036 - 00:12:04.740, Speaker D: So we started with ten people, we call them the Bootstrappers, doing kind of a secure setup, a trusted setup of the community. And then we onboarded more people, more and more like one third additional participants each, each time. And we had a few technical hiccups in the beginning, of course, but overall it worked really smoothly. Paying process was nice at the cafe. Pretty soon we had a little grocery store with local products that accepted loi as well. Now we also have a little pop up store.
00:12:05.050 - 00:12:06.040, Speaker A: We have.
00:12:08.170 - 00:12:36.880, Speaker D: Someone who sells his honey in loi. We have an artist who sells his stuff. And I think one of the bigger events was an open air happening in Zurich where you could buy drinks, lloyd. And where we also distributed vouchers, kind of welcome vouchers to start using.
00:12:39.970 - 00:12:40.960, Speaker A: Got it.
00:12:41.330 - 00:13:09.962, Speaker D: And I mean, yeah, talking about communities, I'm really proud to say we have now a second community which started in Kigali. They started with a slightly different concept, a little bit less formal. So they start with person to person trades first. They don't yet have kind of constant acceptance points, but it is an important.
00:13:10.016 - 00:13:13.562, Speaker A: Milestone for me because bringing more money.
00:13:13.616 - 00:13:16.886, Speaker D: To Zurich is kind of not the point of encounter.
00:13:16.918 - 00:13:17.114, Speaker A: Right.
00:13:17.152 - 00:13:42.500, Speaker D: So it's not our vision. I mean, if we can further local consumption of local goods in Zurich, that's a good thing. It's a good thing for the environment as well. But our vision is really to bring equal opportunity in terms of financial inclusion, in terms of.
00:13:44.890 - 00:13:48.258, Speaker A: Pure buying power in the communities.
00:13:48.354 - 00:13:51.986, Speaker D: So having now a pilot in Kigali.
00:13:52.018 - 00:14:06.134, Speaker A: Is really rewarding for us, and we're really curious how we'll use it there, what the impact will be. Yeah.
00:14:06.172 - 00:14:23.580, Speaker B: I wonder if you can say more about the pilot, just any anecdotes that you've heard from the people who are in the pilot. What are the conditions on the ground and how have they changed? Just really pinching and zooming on that pilot is really interesting to me, because if you do bring this to web scale, that's what more people are going to experience.
00:14:24.370 - 00:14:25.360, Speaker D: Yeah, absolutely.
00:14:28.690 - 00:14:32.542, Speaker A: I think the interesting insights, of course.
00:14:32.596 - 00:14:47.166, Speaker D: The technical bumps can be fun to tell as well. But I think it's more interesting to talk about how people perceive it. And the first people who got a basic income and went to the coffee.
00:14:47.198 - 00:14:53.062, Speaker A: And drank their coffee, they told me, you know, somehow I feel bad about.
00:14:53.116 - 00:15:00.520, Speaker D: Drinking this coffee because I feel like this cafe just gave me this coffee for free.
00:15:00.970 - 00:15:05.020, Speaker A: And I told them, well, it's not for free at all.
00:15:06.430 - 00:15:18.462, Speaker D: They get money for it. And if we establish a circular economy that's just how they make their turnover. And you just have a right in.
00:15:18.516 - 00:15:21.994, Speaker A: Our community for a basic income.
00:15:22.122 - 00:15:41.670, Speaker D: That's your right as part of that community. But it's bending people's minds, the idea of basic income. And that's what I really like here, that we can experiment with basic income without a political process because political processes are so slow.
00:15:42.410 - 00:15:48.280, Speaker A: I just don't have the patience for that. Right.
00:15:49.450 - 00:15:57.050, Speaker B: It seems like it sort of gives a replicable model that kind of goes around bureaucracy in these local jurisdictions to these communities.
00:15:58.350 - 00:15:59.500, Speaker A: Yes, well.
00:16:01.550 - 00:16:39.400, Speaker D: There are a lot of challenges, but it's challenges of community building, community growth. How can you motivate people to attend regularly? How can you convince acceptance points stores to accept that currency? That's a lot of work and that's what doesn't scale. Just like if we want to take this to global scale, I think the pilot can do a lot of good in just showing that it works. And that's why we invest a lot of money and effort now into this pilot to just show that it basically can work.
00:16:41.050 - 00:16:49.786, Speaker A: But then we really need just more communities and we need people on the.
00:16:49.808 - 00:16:52.390, Speaker D: Ground that take the initiative.
00:16:52.470 - 00:16:56.670, Speaker A: And that's why it might not be.
00:16:56.740 - 00:16:59.854, Speaker D: Kind of the protocol which has the.
00:16:59.892 - 00:17:03.230, Speaker A: Steepest curve of growth.
00:17:04.610 - 00:17:09.682, Speaker D: But if I may compare it to other proof of personhood approaches, I just.
00:17:09.736 - 00:17:15.730, Speaker A: Think it's a very secure approach to.
00:17:15.800 - 00:17:29.590, Speaker D: Cyber resistance, because physical presence is just a lot stronger than web of trust or than kind of AI hard challenges to solve.
00:17:33.710 - 00:17:43.706, Speaker A: Biometrics has its other drawbacks with respect to privacy. Yeah, well, we don't need to get.
00:17:43.728 - 00:17:50.494, Speaker B: Into that but I hear you and that's a whole nother episode which should be taken seriously. But given that you're not doing much.
00:17:50.532 - 00:17:53.262, Speaker A: Biometrics on this not at all project.
00:17:53.316 - 00:18:42.526, Speaker B: I'm not going to go into it. I'm a big believer in local currencies because I like the idea that we can create local pockets of values around local values. And I'm not just talking about geographic local but interest based. I could have like a keto Dow that just really values that type of diet. We could have a public goods dow that really values public goods and this allows us to create these little safe havens away from US dollars and Bitcoin which are like just race to the bottom of the brainstem kind of global commodified currencies. Beer and sex and pizza are I think, the ultimate embodiment of capitalism's values. I guess I'm really a believer in local currencies because I like the idea that we can have these little local currencies with our own GDP that have real value.
00:18:42.526 - 00:18:56.900, Speaker B: But I guess one of the things that when I explain local currencies to people they have a question of is like how can a community currency be issued out of nothing, quote unquote, and have real value? So I'm wondering if we could talk a little bit about the local currency design space there.
00:18:57.270 - 00:19:05.670, Speaker A: Yeah, very interesting. There have been a lot of local.
00:19:05.740 - 00:19:09.880, Speaker D: Currency initiatives before us, of course, and.
00:19:11.370 - 00:19:15.900, Speaker A: They usually are initiatives from a community.
00:19:16.590 - 00:19:22.410, Speaker D: That issues their own money but packs it to the national currency.
00:19:22.910 - 00:19:28.080, Speaker A: So that's really the most common way how people do it.
00:19:29.570 - 00:19:31.742, Speaker D: But that also means that the local.
00:19:31.796 - 00:19:37.082, Speaker A: Currencies do nothing to lower inequality because.
00:19:37.236 - 00:20:37.090, Speaker D: You need national currency to buy the local currency. And then you can kind of show local identity by spending the local currency. And that gives identity, gives kind of a status in your community and that does fine. So the experience from others is really that it can further local economy, it can further social capital in the community. But I think it's really the basic income aspect of it which goes into the direction of really lowering inequality. But your point is absolutely crucial. If we issue a basic income, who pays for it or why does it have value? Because there is no central bank that issues deloy here in Zurich.
00:20:38.710 - 00:20:50.022, Speaker A: So no one backs this currency with gold or with Swiss francs, but we.
00:20:50.076 - 00:21:35.880, Speaker D: Do back it by social contracts. So the acceptance point that we have so it's more like well, basically in theory, there are, I guess, two approaches. You can peg your currency to a basket of goods. For example, the baker could say you can always have a loaf of bread for that amount of that currency. And then, I don't know, the butcher says you will always get that amount of meat and so on. And that would give real value to that local currency because you can go to those stores who make a commitment and get something for it. So it does have real value.
00:21:35.880 - 00:21:44.410, Speaker D: This is a rather complicated approach. So we first wanted to try to.
00:21:44.480 - 00:21:49.706, Speaker A: Kind of have deloitte at par with.
00:21:49.728 - 00:21:58.922, Speaker D: The national currency because we need to explain less concepts to the community. And therefore it is really the acceptance.
00:21:58.986 - 00:22:03.610, Speaker A: Points that maintain this peg.
00:22:03.770 - 00:22:08.238, Speaker D: As long as they accept the peg of one lawyer is CHF1.
00:22:08.334 - 00:22:11.106, Speaker A: When they accept the currency, that's the.
00:22:11.128 - 00:22:13.300, Speaker D: Real value that the currency will have.
00:22:15.430 - 00:22:16.274, Speaker A: Got it.
00:22:16.392 - 00:22:36.378, Speaker B: So it seems like there's kind of this virtuous cycle between the social contract and people actually using the currency. It almost feels like network effects to me, where the more people use the currency, the more people accept it as legitimate, then the more people use the currency. And it kind of spins from there. I don't know if I'm saying back to you exactly in the words what you said to me, but that's kind of how I interpret it. Is that close?
00:22:36.544 - 00:23:01.394, Speaker D: Absolutely, yeah. But we should keep in mind that this only works if we can establish a circular economy, because if our acceptance point accepts the currency, but the currency will always stay there, it will just stack up. And that is not in the interest of the acceptance point, because what we.
00:23:01.432 - 00:23:11.382, Speaker A: Should mention here is, like other local currencies do, encounter has built into its.
00:23:11.436 - 00:23:33.370, Speaker D: Money design a concept called deMirage. So the local currency loses its face value over time. And that is an important concept to understand because the devaluation also continues when the money is at the acceptance point.
00:23:33.520 - 00:23:36.198, Speaker A: So if you have money in your.
00:23:36.224 - 00:24:01.154, Speaker D: Pocket that loses value over time, you want to spend it as quickly as possible, because today you can get more for it than tomorrow. And that's exactly why local community currencies work it's because they yield a higher money velocity, so you can do more turnaround with the same amount of money. But that also means that the acceptance.
00:24:01.202 - 00:24:04.534, Speaker A: Point doesn't want to keep the hot.
00:24:04.572 - 00:24:08.198, Speaker D: Potato in his hands for very long. So they want to get rid of it.
00:24:08.284 - 00:24:12.826, Speaker A: So they should be able to pay.
00:24:12.928 - 00:24:20.362, Speaker D: Their suppliers or maybe their staff in that currency such that the currency can.
00:24:20.416 - 00:24:22.140, Speaker A: Circulate the whole time.
00:24:25.490 - 00:24:51.074, Speaker D: If I may put that side note, we talked about the basic income and who pays for it. Actually, it is this deMirage, which basically pays for the basic income. So because we burn money exponentially in your wallet, we burn the money where it is not used, and we distribute.
00:24:51.122 - 00:24:56.742, Speaker A: It to all the humans in this community.
00:24:56.876 - 00:25:28.130, Speaker D: So it's in a way, it is the dermarage that pays for the basic income. And by doing so, it also makes sure that the money supply will be in proportion to the population. So it's not kind of an inflationary design that with each basic income that is issued, the money supply will just raise forever. But because we have deMirage, there will be an equilibrium which is proportional to the population.
00:25:29.030 - 00:25:34.180, Speaker B: And just for listeners who aren't super familiar with demaraj, what's the simplest way of explaining that?
00:25:38.630 - 00:25:48.230, Speaker A: So if today you have ten loy in your wallet, the loy has a.
00:25:48.300 - 00:25:52.342, Speaker D: Halving time of a year. So that means if you just do.
00:25:52.396 - 00:25:54.906, Speaker A: Nothing today in your wallet, you see.
00:25:54.928 - 00:25:57.706, Speaker D: A balance of ten. If you wait for a year, you.
00:25:57.728 - 00:26:00.954, Speaker A: Will see a balance of five, and.
00:26:00.992 - 00:26:14.110, Speaker D: It will still be five Swiss francs buying power, most likely where it was ten Swiss francs buying power a year ago. So it's exponential decay in your wallet.
00:26:17.410 - 00:26:18.014, Speaker B: Got it.
00:26:18.052 - 00:26:18.640, Speaker A: Okay.
00:26:19.650 - 00:26:40.150, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the analogy that I think that I learned about demarage with was like rice, basically. Like where if you have 100 units of rice and you expect that a certain amount of them are going to spoil on a weekly basis, then you have 99 if 1% spoil on a weekly basis. So that's like my analogy in my head for demarage.
00:26:40.570 - 00:27:11.330, Speaker D: That's actually where the word comes from, because if you are a trader of fresh goods, you need to account for all the rotten produce that you have over time. I really like this analogy because money is well, one of the only things in the world that we have in our lives that is not perishable. Everything else is perishable.
00:27:12.870 - 00:27:14.100, Speaker A: Why not money?
00:27:15.910 - 00:27:36.250, Speaker B: I guess I'm curious. I have in my notes here that you all have launched a pioneer community with 200 members in Zurich, and there's a launch that just happened in Rwanda in November 10. It's obviously very early. We're recording this November 29. It's very early to ask this question, but do you see any similarities or differences in these two very different geographies?
00:27:40.030 - 00:27:42.460, Speaker D: Well, it is really early to.
00:27:44.210 - 00:27:44.960, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:27:45.890 - 00:27:50.010, Speaker D: Well, we have talked to the leader.
00:27:50.090 - 00:27:55.966, Speaker A: In Kigali about how we approach how.
00:27:55.988 - 00:27:58.580, Speaker D: We tell the story and the story.
00:28:01.510 - 00:28:06.754, Speaker B: Just a note for the listeners. Kigali is in Rwanda. That's the second pilot there. Go ahead, continue.
00:28:06.872 - 00:28:12.520, Speaker A: Yeah, so, well.
00:28:14.730 - 00:28:33.450, Speaker D: I think it's harder there also because of legislation, so we shouldn't forget that. Well, if you're in different jurisdictions, it will be very different how governments will receive such local community currencies.
00:28:33.950 - 00:28:38.634, Speaker A: Although I have to say a crypto.
00:28:38.682 - 00:28:49.294, Speaker D: Ban usually is motivated by governments who don't want capital to flee the country, and you cannot do that with a local currency.
00:28:49.342 - 00:28:52.178, Speaker A: So I don't really think we need.
00:28:52.184 - 00:28:54.340, Speaker D: To be careful in how we compare there.
00:28:54.870 - 00:28:59.342, Speaker A: But definitely jurisdiction and kind of talking.
00:28:59.416 - 00:29:05.400, Speaker D: To the government is really important for our leader in Rwanda because.
00:29:08.570 - 00:29:09.382, Speaker A: He'S taking.
00:29:09.436 - 00:29:20.362, Speaker D: Risks because of this legal uncertainty there. And that's why that community starts, I would say, really as a low key.
00:29:20.416 - 00:29:21.290, Speaker A: Experiment.
00:29:24.770 - 00:29:50.440, Speaker D: Not with waving flags and calling the revolution. It's not how things will be approached there. In Zurich, we can act differently, we can be more bold on our ambitions, and our greatest fear is how the tax officials will act on it.
00:29:52.250 - 00:29:55.606, Speaker A: That's just a different level of we.
00:29:55.628 - 00:29:57.750, Speaker D: Don'T need to fear to go to prison.
00:29:59.290 - 00:30:02.050, Speaker A: Right, yeah.
00:30:02.140 - 00:30:12.490, Speaker D: Apart from that, really, I cannot tell how different people will use their local currencies. And we want to give as much.
00:30:12.560 - 00:30:19.360, Speaker A: Freedom as possible, so we support the community.
00:30:19.730 - 00:30:37.186, Speaker D: So as the Encounter Association, we have a little bit of means to support the new communities and we do so as unconditionally as possible because we think they know best how they need to allocate the funds, and we don't want.
00:30:37.208 - 00:30:43.574, Speaker A: To mess too much with how they do it and how the money has.
00:30:43.612 - 00:31:00.922, Speaker D: To work for them. So I think we just supply the protocol, we supply technical support and kind of a minimum starting funds, and then we hope that people just are motivated enough, take the initiative and do something.
00:31:00.976 - 00:31:05.450, Speaker A: Which works for them. Beautiful.
00:31:05.600 - 00:31:20.660, Speaker B: Well, I can't wait to have you back in a couple of years and just see how the experiments have grown. And you'll probably have a lot more data points at that point. So the traction is interesting so far. Is there anything that I didn't ask you that you want to say?
00:31:21.030 - 00:31:26.674, Speaker A: Yeah, well, maybe I can just tell.
00:31:26.712 - 00:31:31.266, Speaker D: About our next steps towards our vision.
00:31:31.378 - 00:31:34.390, Speaker A: So I think we have two more.
00:31:34.460 - 00:31:54.362, Speaker D: Big topics apart from adoption, and one is democracy. So as we have a cyber resistance in place, we want to establish one person, one vote subsidiary democracy, which means that every decision should be taken at the lowest possible level.
00:31:54.416 - 00:31:58.270, Speaker A: So our first vote as an example.
00:31:58.340 - 00:32:04.366, Speaker D: Will probably be how high should the basic income be in our community? And then we let people vote on.
00:32:04.388 - 00:32:06.382, Speaker A: That, which I think is a pretty.
00:32:06.436 - 00:32:39.130, Speaker D: Interesting question to ask. And it's kind of the fear of every central banker to submit this to a democratic process. But I think it will be an interesting experiment and we are concluding the minimum viable product to really have kind of on chain democracy doing that. So that's one thing and the other is privacy. So right now we are a substrate based protocol running on polkadot. Well, kusama to be precise.
00:32:39.550 - 00:32:55.342, Speaker A: And everything is transparent. This is an issue because local currencies are used for everyday purchases and you.
00:32:55.396 - 00:33:03.010, Speaker D: Have to register for these cycles to prove your personhood. That means you commit to be in a certain place at a certain time in advance.
00:33:03.430 - 00:33:07.486, Speaker A: And that's kind of an added risk.
00:33:07.598 - 00:33:18.930, Speaker D: It'S a security risk, but also it really leaks even future behavior about yourself. And that's why we take privacy seriously.
00:33:19.350 - 00:33:23.994, Speaker A: And we are now working on a.
00:33:24.032 - 00:33:37.694, Speaker D: Second layer solution, which not only helps us with scalability so that kind of each community can scale independently of others, but also helps with privacy because these.
00:33:37.732 - 00:33:42.330, Speaker A: Second layers will run with trusted execution environments.
00:33:42.410 - 00:33:47.186, Speaker D: I don't want to go too deep into tech here, but it's just one.
00:33:47.208 - 00:33:54.658, Speaker A: Of the options to provide privacy to transactions. Got it.
00:33:54.664 - 00:34:00.150, Speaker B: So that's what's on the roadmap next. More focuses on democracy and privacy.
00:34:00.570 - 00:34:10.614, Speaker D: Yeah, that's especially the technical roadmap. But I think more important than tech is really community work and adoption because.
00:34:10.652 - 00:34:19.806, Speaker A: In the end, this will decide if we get to fly or not. Yeah, bird.
00:34:19.858 - 00:34:24.140, Speaker B: Well, thanks so much for coming on the Pod. How can people find you and the project?
00:34:24.990 - 00:34:50.340, Speaker D: Well, the best place to start really is Ncointer.org. That's where you can start. You can download the app for your mobile phone, start playing around. We have a testnet, we have tutorials for people who want to start a local community where they live and please.
00:34:51.110 - 00:34:54.882, Speaker A: Just reach out to us. Great.
00:34:54.936 - 00:35:00.606, Speaker B: We'll put some links in the show notes for that. And thanks again for coming on the Pod.
00:35:00.798 - 00:35:01.680, Speaker D: Thanks for having me.
