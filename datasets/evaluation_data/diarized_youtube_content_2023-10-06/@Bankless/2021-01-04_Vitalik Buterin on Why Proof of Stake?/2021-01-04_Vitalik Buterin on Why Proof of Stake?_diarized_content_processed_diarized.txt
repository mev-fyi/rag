Synthetics is a platform for creating and trading synthetic assets, which are assets that are priced via an oracle. Rather than bids or asks, traders can use the Quinta exchange, which hosts and trades all of the synthetic assets created by synthetics.
00:01:46.842 - 00:02:14.290, Speaker A: Traders on quinta can trade synthetic tokens like SBTC s oil or SDFI. Because Quenta is powered by synthetix, traders experience zero slippage on their trades. No, I didn't mean low slippage. I meant no slippage because that is the power of the synthetics platform. No slippage on your trades. You can also easily short assets with isynth, which are synthetic assets that move inversely to their target asset. Synthetix isn't just for traders.
00:02:14.290 - 00:02:42.590, Speaker A: Developers can build on synthetics to access the infinite liquidity offered by synthetic assets, or investors can stake collateral to the protocol and earn fees that the protocol collects. If you're a trader and you're looking for a trading platform not found in the legacy world, check out quinta IO. If you're a developer or you just want to earn yield on your collateral, go to wWW synthetics IO, where you can stake your SNX or ETH and earn fees from synthetics.
00:02:45.810 - 00:02:56.900, Speaker B: Anklis Nation, we are pleased to bring you Vitalikbuterin again in front of the nation we are talking about a few things that are top of mind. Vitalik, great to have you. How are you doing?
00:02:57.590 - 00:03:03.414, Speaker C: Thank you very much, David and Ryan. It's great. It's great to be on bankless again.
00:03:03.612 - 00:03:28.480, Speaker B: It is fun and I feel like this is a really good moment to be on bankless. The first thing we want to talk about with you actually is this pretty momentous, maybe monumental in the history of Ethereum achievement, which is we hit the number 524,288 e now deposited in the staking contract. How does that feel?
00:03:30.370 - 00:04:51.814, Speaker C: Definitely feels great. I think for a long time, the first few weeks we were definitely a bit worried because the deposits were coming in slowly at the beginning and it seemed like with only four days left, we only had 20% and what the heck is going on here? And we even saw, right, that there are a lot of people who are starting to get worried. Like on our GitHub thread and saw Eric opened up that GitHub issue, basically suggesting, hey, just in case there is never enough deposits, let's set a maximum date. And there was a bunch of arguments around that, but no, the Ethereum community came in and the Ethereum community delivered, and just within the last 24 hours we ended up having more deposits than we had in the entire period before that. It definitely feels a little bit surprising, though in retrospect it should not be too surprising. I guess the one kind of event that happened in the past that this reminds me of is if you were here during the original ether sale back in 2014. If you remember that whole event, it was this kind of six week long sale.
00:04:51.814 - 00:06:00.766, Speaker C: But then the first two weeks were this most important period because that was the period during which you could get the most favorable price for your eth. And there was some amount of deposits on the first day, less on the second day, and then it seemed like it was going really slowly and almost petering out at a couple of million dollars. And then just suddenly in the last couple of days, everyone just whooshed in and pushed the whole thing up to close to $18 million. The curve feels kind of very similar to that. And I guess to some extent you should expect that because, well, why would someone participate earlier if they can just wait until the end? But just seeing that if Spike just come first slowly and done all at once is definitely amazing and it's definitely a great testament to the Ethereum community's level of confidence that first time in Ethereum itself, and then this second time in the proof of stake and sharding stuff that we've spent so many years working on.
00:06:00.948 - 00:06:21.480, Speaker A: So, Vitalik, what does this tell you about the Ethereum community as a result of this? Because we hit the 524,000 eth, but then we just blew past it by 200,000 more eth. If this is a litmus test for the community, what is it telling you? What are your big takeaways about the Ethereum community as a result of this event?
00:06:24.330 - 00:07:10.040, Speaker C: I think, first of all, there's definitely wide community buy in and confidence in e two in general, and that's something that I think I definitely believed the whole time. But it's definitely good to have just such a clear sign of it, $300 million worth of people just locking up their ETH, potentially never to see it again unless the thing either delivers or we find some further thing to do to make those coins in the deposits actually valuable again. So in some sense, it's the ultimate bet on progress. And I think I bet on progress is to some extent what Ethereum is about.
00:07:10.890 - 00:07:48.980, Speaker B: I feel like it happened in the perfect way, in a very climactic way, and really fired the Ethereum community up when it actually happened in the way that it did. It's almost fitting. I would say, that we weren't sure we were going to cross the threshold until the last 48 to 24 hours, but I'm curious about this number itself. Why was the number selected? What kind of drove that number to begin with? Was it fairly arbitrary that we have to have some amount of stake and so why not this particular number? Or was there some sort of rhyme or reason behind it?
00:07:49.990 - 00:09:10.198, Speaker C: I guess 524,000 was the power of two. That seemed like a relatively minimum acceptable threshold for an amount of deposits that we could have to ensure that the chain would actually be safe with that amount. So to give one example, that's the smallest power of two that the Ethereum foundation could not individually 51% attack. The Ethereum foundation has like slightly above that, but it would have to put everything in, and even then it would only be only be around 50%. So if we had less than just the number of actors that would have enough money to be able to take over the thing individually, it would just get higher and higher, and so the chain would just not be that secure with a lower amount. But on the other hand, at this level, it's getting to the point where there's really very few individual actors that actually have the ability to put in the funds to take over the chain. And aside from the foundation, there's also obviously the major exchanges and maybe consensus, I don't know how much they have a couple of whales.
00:09:10.198 - 00:09:42.134, Speaker C: And then if you go higher and we hope to go higher, then it is going to get out of reach of even those largest holders. But realistically we don't have to get up to those much higher levels immediately. This is still just the phase zero beacon chain. There's nothing completely relying on it. And so we start at a medium level of safety and then go up to the higher level over time as people naturally become more confident in the system.
00:09:42.332 - 00:10:14.370, Speaker B: So this process, this getting to that number and exceeding the threshold of eTh, that sort of initiates the rocket launch sequence. Right, but the chain is not yet launched. That will happen December 1, 12:00 utc time. So what kind of happens next? What's the next milestone in the beacon chain launch and in staking now that we filled up the deposit contract to its minimum threshold.
00:10:15.510 - 00:11:12.274, Speaker C: So the next milestone is obviously the thing that's happening in five and a half days after I'm saying this, December 1, the launch itself, we've done lots of test debts, but this is still larger than any test debt. It's a different set of stakeholders than any test debt. So just making sure that all goes smoothly. Then after that, we would hope the proof of stake changes to run smoothly for some amount of time. And at some point we want to just start getting onto the task of kind of upgrading it and bringing on all the full functionality that we want eth two to have. So the big ticket items are, one is sharding, the second is the merge. So bringing eth one into the e two system, removing the proof of work chain and kind of properly folding the system back together, and then there's also some smaller things that we want to do.
00:11:12.274 - 00:12:12.162, Speaker C: So like for example, we want to add light client support fairly quickly. So if you go into the e two specs, GitHub, there's already a pr that we've been working on for about a couple of weeks to analyze client support. And then there are some just efficiency improvements and some possible kind of economic tweaks. One example of a type of economic tweak we might want to make is just making the chain more friendly to people who validators who stay online during an inactivity leak, but don't stay online perfectly. So basically, if you have 90% of performance during an inactivity leak where people who are completely online lose 40% you should not lose 4%, right? Really? You should lose much less than 4%. You really were doing and the best that you can. So I have a proposal around fixing that, just general efficiency improvements.
00:12:12.162 - 00:12:32.746, Speaker C: So basically the e two chain is just going to kind of get into this progressing and upgrading mode, and it's basically preparing for the moment when the existing ethereum ecosystem can properly and fully fold into it.
00:12:32.928 - 00:12:51.410, Speaker B: Are you feeling a little bit. Vitalik so this is like the launch sequence initiated, right? But at some level we're all kind of standing close to the launch pad watching the SpaceX rocket, and it hasn't quite launched yet. And that, of course, is maybe the most nerve wracking part.
00:12:51.480 - 00:12:51.762, Speaker C: Right.
00:12:51.816 - 00:13:04.760, Speaker B: So is there any element of you being nervous about December 1 or I mean, what could happen December 1? Could we have a failed launch? Could there be some issue?
00:13:07.290 - 00:14:15.550, Speaker C: Issues are always possible, right? So this is, I think, why we should hold off the full celebration until gets off the ground. But we've seen what we've had with different test nets. Some of them launched perfectly, some of them had issues. Even the ones that had issues, they definitely all managed to fix themselves within either a couple of hours or a day or so. I expect that this time there's definitely more participants and potentially less experienced participants, though also maybe more experienced participants, because the people who participated in the test nets are also going to be in the main net and it's not going to be a first time for them anymore. I don't think we're going to see the thing that we saw in some of the testets where 40% of people just never showed up because this time we actually have a profit motive. There's just always the possibility of random technical risk, I suppose.
00:14:15.550 - 00:14:37.054, Speaker C: We've done lots of testing at this point. The quality of the test eds has definitely just gone up and up over time, but figures crossed and it hasn't happened until what's happened. So we're definitely hoping and eagerly awaiting everything going well.
00:14:37.192 - 00:15:33.670, Speaker B: So Vitalik, the ETH two research team recently did a Reddit ama that I thought was really fantastic. And there's one question I recall in there, I think somebody asked you the question about maybe ETH issuance or something. I forget the context for the question. You had this really, I thought, reflective reply where you talked about Ethereum being while e two is launching, it's also a technology and a network that is somewhat in motion, right. There are going to be a large set of improvements over the next two years. It's not necessarily going to be like instant scalability is here and both chains merge. It's going to still be a process, but at the end of that time, the e two chain will be in a much better place.
00:15:33.670 - 00:15:53.870, Speaker B: I was wondering if you could, I'm not presenting it the way you did and the way you answered that question, but I'm wondering if that jogs your memory and you could talk about maybe that answer to the question like, what's the future for issuance? What's the future for stability? V two? Where are we going to be on the other side when all of this stuff is done? And why should we hang with Ethereum?
00:15:54.610 - 00:17:23.034, Speaker C: Yeah, I definitely think I made that comment for a reason, and I think there's an important kind of insight to keep in mind there. There's a lot of people who have been recently commenting about how ETh doesn't have a finalized issuance schedule, or you can't calculate what the current total supply is or what is the max supply. And now you're changing things. And there's definitely some extent to which those queries are coming more from the bitcoin community than the Ethereum community itself. And so we should definitely kind of not, I guess, overrate the extent to which we really feel the need to kind of respond and satisfy all of those requests. But the thing that I think we need to just keep in mind is that just kind of being intellectually honest about the state of Ethereum. If you need a system which satisfies the property that it will stay the same as it is today, and it has existing properties that it's going to preserve, then Ethereum as it exists in 2020 is just, as a matter of fact, not the system for you, for at least the next one to one and a half years.
00:17:23.034 - 00:18:56.722, Speaker C: Right? There's just a reality that there has been this massive e 2.0 transition that's been planned pretty much almost since the project's launch, and now it's finally happening, and then at the same time there is these massive transitions in economics. So EIP 1559 is a big one, and also just activity moving from layer one to the L2 s is another big one. And these things are going to fundamentally change how a lot of economic and technical properties of Ethereum work. And so any property of the Ethereum blockchain today may well change in those one to one and a half years. And so if you're interested in long term economic properties of the ethereum ecosystem, it matters less what are the properties of the system today, and it matters more what are the properties of the thing that's going to slowly being built up over the next one and a half years, right? What even is the point of being able to verify the current proof of work issuance schedule perfectly if the thing that we really should be verifying is the economic properties of the proof of stake schedule that are going to be guiding Ethereum's economics for the 20 years after 2022 or whenever the merge ends up happening. So I think just explicitly understanding that, yes, Ethereum at the moment is a system in flux.
00:18:56.722 - 00:19:23.120, Speaker C: And yes, if you want something that's not a system influx, then bitcoin may be the thing for you. Ethereum classic may be the thing for you. Although Ethereum classic itself is kind of, I think influx as a matter of necessity because its immutability is being threatened by all these 51% attacks. So that's one example where in order to protect people's kind of property rights, you actually have to do something other than standing still.
00:19:24.530 - 00:19:49.660, Speaker B: So, Vitalik, if this is successful, if we cross the bridge, if we make it for the other side, to the other side, for those that kind of stick with the project, like the builders who kind of stick with it, the community that sticks with it, what's left for us on the other side? What do we get in terms of issuance, in terms of improvements, in terms of security enhancements? What's the reward there?
00:19:50.990 - 00:20:36.690, Speaker C: I think great things are on the other side. So number one is obviously proof of stake. So much more efficient, much more secure, much less tree killing, much less issuance, demanding form of consensus. Issuance is going to potentially go down by significant amount. The efficiency of the network will go up by a lot, and Ethereum is basically going to become what I think the expect a modern blockchain to be. So that's number one. Number two is sharding and at the same time the L2 ecosystem.
00:20:36.690 - 00:21:47.310, Speaker C: So those things together are going to give us scalability in the tens of thousands of transactions per second, which is hugely important because ultimately we're looking to create a platform that can achieve mainstream adoption, create a platform that actually can provide enough security and trust guarantees to its users, and actually scale that up to millions and potentially tens or hundreds millions of users, and not just a very small number like a couple of hundred thousand per day. And just proof of stake and sharding are the things that needs to be done to make that happen. So that's number two. Number three, is that just better protocol economics. So EIP 50 59 is the really big thing. I think the more you use Ethereum, the more you realize that just gas estimation is such a stupid and archaic concept. I really think that if all goes well, in five years time blockchains that rely on this first price auction model is just going to be looked at like caveman economics.
00:21:47.310 - 00:22:40.714, Speaker C: I'm really looking forward to it. And it seems like the model is already working well and increasingly being validated in filecoin. It's increasingly working well on the testnet. So really looking forward to that hitting the main net. I think that could be one of the big stories of 2021. Also just general efficiencies within the Ethereum system. So replacing the hex tree with binary trees, allowing stateless clients which make it much more efficient to process and sync the chain, much more sum of virtual machine improvements that would allow us to just not need any more pre compiles and be able to have all the advanced cryptography that we want inside of ethereum.
00:22:40.714 - 00:23:28.030, Speaker C: So basically just everything that you could want. If you're building some privacy preserving application or some kind of more complicated smart contract system, or some roll up for scalability, the tools actually are going to be there and you're not going to have to use kind of clever tricks anywhere close to the same extent as you do now. Also, light client support. So e two, we're taking a go at making it explicitly, much more light, client friendly, and so hopefully break the dependence on infuria and kind of actually make it so that people's wallets actually can be light clients.
00:23:28.610 - 00:23:41.314, Speaker B: And Vitalik, do we get to that place not fixed issuance, obviously, like the bitcoin model. But did we ever get to a place where we have more predictable issuance on the other side? What does that look like?
00:23:41.512 - 00:24:44.226, Speaker C: Yeah, so I think realistically we'll want to wait around one or two years after probably even the clock starts ticking next week. So just after phase zero, just verifying that the current economic structure of proof of stake is sustainable, verifying that that economic structure can survive the addition of sharding the addition of the ETH one chain, verifying that EIP 1559 is working as expected, and then once all of those pieces are in place, then I think people are going to just have a much more clear and visceral understanding of this is how high proof of stake issuance is, this is how high the AP 59 burn is, this is the kind of historical variance of those two parameters. And so the issuance and general kind of change of the total supply level is going to look, I think, much more predictable a couple of years from now, and I think people are going to be very happy with the results.
00:24:44.338 - 00:25:05.360, Speaker B: Last thing for you on this, Vitalik, then we'll move on to something that is equally exciting in a way. If somebody is just built on the ETH one chain right now has all of their ether on the ETH one chain, do they have to worry about any of the stuff that we were just talking about, or does this merge somehow in the future?
00:25:05.730 - 00:25:52.838, Speaker C: Good question. The answer is they absolutely do not. So one of the big compromises that we made for kind of practicality is that while Ethereum's consensus layer and scalability and all of these things are getting massive kind of revamps from the ground up, Ethereum's execution layer is actually remaining remarkably constant throughout the transition. So transactions that were valid before will be valid after. Smart contracts that executed in one way before will execute the same way after. Basically all applications, contracts, ETH, everything will just be kind of migrated from the eth one side to the e two side automatically. And so you as a user or as an application developer, basically do not need to worry.
00:25:52.838 - 00:26:25.430, Speaker C: There are a couple of corner cases. Like for example, if you relied on block hashes for randomness before, then in proof of stake, block hashes stop being secure randomness, and so instead you would have to use the randow output as randomness. But these are, block times are going to work slightly differently, but these are generally issues that only affect a very tiny portion of users. So for basically the vast majority of the user base, I think they'll experience close to no change from an application perspective.
00:26:26.730 - 00:27:33.440, Speaker A: Vitalik the conversation about proof of work versus proof of stake was really, really big from what I can remember in 2017 and 2018, or it should probably even bigger before that. But I came into the world of crypto in 2017, and I actually think it's really valuable that people understand this debate and why, and understand the merits of proof of work and also understand the merits of proof of stake. In order to understand why is Ethereum so committed to proof of stake, why do we want this? And so you wrote this article on your blog, Vitalik, ca. Everyone should check it out, called why proof of stake? And we kind of want to go through some of these points so we can help the bankless nation kind of come to understand the terms that you use here and the arguments of why proof of stake is inherently the right, I'm not going to say superior, but the right consensus mechanism for Ethereum, right? Because many bitcoiners will still say to this day that proof of work is the one true consensus mechanism. So let's go through some of the points that you wrote here. Proof of stake offers more security for the same cost. What does that mean? And how does staking offer that?
00:27:35.010 - 00:29:08.586, Speaker C: So the basic idea here is that if you try to quantify security, so the easiest way to quantify security is just how many dollars do you need to spend to break the thing? Then if you look at the ratio of security to cost, where cost just means like how many rewards you have to push out to the participants, then the ratio of the security level to the amount you pay for the security just is much more favorable on the proof of stake side than it is for any version of proof of work. And I think the way that you can look at this is that if you look at just first of all, start off with a comparison between GPU based proof of work and ASIC based proof of work. So this is a comparison that even bitcoin people make all the right when they defend why their ASIC based proof of work is better than the ASIC resistance algorithms is basically that in the GPU case, the cost of mining is only operating cost, and there's basically no capital cost. Because you can rent gpus, if you buy a GPU, you can always sell it after, even if the blockchain disappears, gpus continue to be useful. And so if you want to attack a GPU based chain, all you have to do is just rent some gpus for 6 hours or however long you want to do an attack. And so the cost of an attack is basically going to be just exactly the same as the cost of the rewards during the time period that you're attacking. And if you as an attacker receive walk rewards, then the cost of the attack even drops to zero, or it becomes profitable all by itself.
00:29:08.586 - 00:30:16.830, Speaker C: So for gpus, while GPU proof of work mining has a big advantage in terms of being decentralized, from a security perspective, it actually is quite weak. And we've seen this, right? As I mentioned, Ethereum classic has been getting a lot of 51% attacks recently. Now, if we look at ASIC based proof of work, ASIC based proof of work is considerably more secure, because ASIC based proof of work has not only ongoing costs, but also capital costs, right? And an analysis I did a few years ago suggests that it's about one third ongoing cost and about two thirds capital costs. Maybe that ratio changes over time. I actually have no idea which direction it's going to change into, but that's roughly what it is, approximately. Right. And then if you kind of make some assumptions about how long an ASIC lasts, you can actually kind of reverse engineer what the capital costs are from the amount of money that you're paying for rewards, right? So the idea basically is that if your chain is paying one dollars a day in rewards, then out of that one dollars, one third will be operating costs, two thirds will be capital costs.
00:30:16.830 - 00:31:03.726, Speaker C: And you can think of the two thirds as capital costs as being kind of amortized over the entire period of time during which that miner is mining. Right? And so if you assume that an ASIC lasts about two years, I think now it's a little bit more than two years. But Moore's law, increasing efficiency, wear and tear, all of these things. So at the two year level, all you have to do is you basically take the amount per day that they're spending on the ASIC and then multiply that by the number of days in two years. And that's the cost of the ASIC. If your model of an attack is that an attacker just has to buy up as many asics as the legitimate network, then you can use this to kind of get an estimate for the cost of the asics needed to attack the network. And so here you get about $486.
00:31:03.726 - 00:31:16.706, Speaker C: And so that's the cost of breaking proof of work if you have asics, right? So already much better than gpus, but asics have a cost of centralization. So now if we go to proof.
00:31:16.738 - 00:31:35.130, Speaker A: Of stake, can I get you to comment on Ethereum? One, if Ethereum won, if that was the chain that would just carry on into the future forever, would you have been in favor of it being GPU based, or would you have been interested in making an ASIC version of Ethereum?
00:31:37.070 - 00:31:58.190, Speaker C: So at the beginning, I was definitely much more pro gpus. But I think more recently, it's not so much that I've become more pro ASIC, it's that I've become less pro GPU. It just feels like kind of a tragic choice between two differently bad options, to be honest.
00:31:58.340 - 00:31:58.906, Speaker A: Okay.
00:31:59.028 - 00:32:13.846, Speaker B: But gpus did have this nice property in the early days, that it was a much more egalitarian, decentralized way to distribute the tokens, which arguably, that's kind of what Ethereum was looking for in the first part of its life.
00:32:14.028 - 00:32:23.610, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree, and I think that's very important. And I think Ethereum is definitely better as a result of having that GPU mining for the first few years of its existence.
00:32:23.950 - 00:32:30.490, Speaker A: As somebody who came into Ethereum because it was able to be GPU mined. I have to say thank you for making that choice.
00:32:31.710 - 00:32:37.178, Speaker B: But not as secure compared to asics is the point, at least from an economic security perspective.
00:32:37.354 - 00:33:56.130, Speaker C: The thing to keep in mind, right, is that the longer we, I think the chain even manages to be GPU mined up until this day only because people realize that proof of stake is coming, right? Basically the reason why there isn't much more work on building asics is that people realize that any asics that get built would only survive either a year or potentially even a few months, potentially in response to the chain getting taken over by ASICs. We could even just rush the entire transition and just do the merge in a couple of weeks, right? Doing that sort of thing would totally be extremely disruptive to the ethereum ecosystem, but doing something extremely disruptive in response to an already extremely disruptive attack is the sort of thing that would happen, right? And so people, I think, realize that it's just too risky to build ASICs because there's just no guarantee that you're actually going to have enough of a period of time during which you're going to be profitable, and that's why the chain continues to be GPU friendly, right? And so the fact that this GPU friendliness has been possible to this day should not at all be taken as evidence that GPU friendliness is a stable equilibrium going into the long term.
00:33:56.210 - 00:33:56.550, Speaker B: Right?
00:33:56.620 - 00:33:57.480, Speaker C: Makes sense.
00:33:58.090 - 00:33:59.690, Speaker A: Shall we get into proof of stake?
00:34:00.030 - 00:34:53.030, Speaker C: Yeah, so proof of stake. So basically the way that I view proof of stake is I view proof of stake as combining the efficiencies or this capital cost property of asiCs, but really cranking that property up to the extreme and at the same time having the kind of open accessibility of gpus, right? So basically proof of stake is almost entirely capital costs, right? The cost of operating a node is fairly small. And the difference is, though, is that in the case of ASICs, the capital cost is only kind of amortized over the course of about two years. So it's about like 50% a year. But unlike ASICs, deposited coins do not depreciate deposited coins. You can deposit them, you can stake for a bit, and you could get them back. And so you actually don't even need that high of a rate of return to motivate people to stake.
00:34:53.030 - 00:36:20.482, Speaker C: So here I was actually, I think, understating the case, right, because here I was saying, oh, imagine a 15% rate of return is enough to motivate people to be willing to lock up their money and stake. And I think 15% is roughly the rate of return that we're going to see in this initial phase of ETH two, I think with the current level of deposits, it's about 18%, but we're going to see more deposits. But I think in the long run, especially when it's possible to just deposit stake for a bit and then withdraw and get your money back within a day, I fully expect that the rate of return will just drop to something closer to 10% or even 5%. But even with a 15% rate of return on capital, that basically means that one dollars per day of rewards is going to attract 6.67 worth of deposits, right? Basically, if you stick $2,400 in as a deposit, then your annual return would be $2,400 multiplied by 15%, which would be around close to 365. And so $365 a year is equal to one dollars a day, right? So if we assume 15% rate of return per year, then every one dollars a day in rewards is going to correspond to $2,433 of deposits. That's at current rates.
00:36:20.482 - 00:36:53.460, Speaker C: If the rates drop to 5%, and this number obviously goes up to 7500. Right. Now, if we assume that only 90% of the costs are capital costs and there's still 10% that are operating costs, then the 24 33 goes down to about 21 eightyn. But basically even still, right, we have five times more deposits that are paid for by the same rewards in proof of stake as compared to async driven proof of work. And this is now in the long term, I expect it to go up to something like 10,000. So it'll be 25 times stronger than proof of work.
00:36:55.670 - 00:37:13.154, Speaker A: Is that summarized as the security of proof of stake comes from the fact that ether, the asset, doesn't deprecate in the same way that ASIC, a machine does. And so ether gives you a year on year return, where an ASIC gives you a year on year deprecation, devaluation of the unit.
00:37:13.202 - 00:37:13.366, Speaker C: Right?
00:37:13.388 - 00:37:18.780, Speaker A: And so that's the fundamental component of where proof of stake gets its security from.
00:37:19.790 - 00:37:23.770, Speaker C: Yes, that's definitely an excellent way of stating the point. Cool.
00:37:23.840 - 00:37:58.330, Speaker B: All right, so where we've come so far is we have GPU based proof of work, which Ethereum is on now. That means you can use a GPU card in your Nvidia gaming machine to mine a little bit. And that total cost of attack is fairly cheap. You can attack that fairly easily, lower economic security. And then bitcoin has ASIC based proof of work, which is a bit more expensive to attack. So higher economic security and that economic.
00:37:58.350 - 00:38:06.338, Speaker A: Security comes from the fact that the ASIC is only doing one job, that's only possible to do one job, which is mine, bitcoin. It's dedicated.
00:38:06.434 - 00:38:08.274, Speaker B: So it's all sunk capital costs.
00:38:08.322 - 00:38:09.714, Speaker A: Basically you are locked.
00:38:09.842 - 00:38:33.280, Speaker B: So. And now proof of stake because it's like ultra sunk cost. That's the only thing you can really kind of do with it. It's almost like a tokenized ASIC on steroids, if you will. That's even more efficient. And how would you quantify this? Is this like a five x more efficient, like bang for the security, for the dollar? Or is it a ten x?
00:38:34.530 - 00:38:41.406, Speaker C: According to the kind of back of the envelope numbers here, it's five x in the short term and up to 20 x in the long term.
00:38:41.518 - 00:39:02.780, Speaker B: Wow. So I think of this, Dave and I have often sort of analogized these sort of chains to nation states. And almost, this is like the security force, this is the defense, right? And so it's almost like you're upgrading your military from cavalry and horses to panzer tanks here, right?
00:39:03.550 - 00:40:07.230, Speaker C: Trying to think, what's a good analogy? Okay, so here's a really fun and dumb analogy. GPU based proof of work is you have to basically hire soldiers out every day to patrol your borders to make sure the enemy army doesn't get in, and you have to keep on paying them. ASIC based proof of work is the Great Wall of China. Then proof of stake is imagine a great wall of China that has the property that the way that this wall is constructed is that when people are not staying in their own houses, they just teleport the walls of their houses and they make it part of the Great Wall of. So whenever you're not in your house, whenever you're going off on vacation, you just click a button and your house teleports to being part of the wall. And the government pays you some small amount of money to do this, and you're happy to collect the reward. And then as soon as you want to move back into your house, you just click a button again and the balls teleport back at their part of your house again.
00:40:07.230 - 00:40:23.342, Speaker C: Right? So basically you don't even need to kind of create these separate resources. You're just kind of taking advantage of existing resources and you're moving them over to a different purpose when people know that they don't need them for a long time. So much more capital efficient.
00:40:23.486 - 00:40:40.360, Speaker A: So the idea is that this version of the great Wall of China would theoretically be a lot higher because of the incentive for everyone to allocate the walls of their house into the walls of the great wall of China in the moments that they are not inside their house, using their house as a.
00:40:42.170 - 00:41:13.460, Speaker B: You know, the interesting. So as I think. So you talked about this in the article, right? So we're talking about a five to 20 x gain in proof of stake potentially. And the question is, what do we do with this efficiency gain as a social contract for Ethereum? Can you talk about that? Because it seems like there are like maybe two options here of what to do with this drastically improved military. Drastically improved. Great wall.
00:41:13.990 - 00:42:01.970, Speaker C: Yes. So one of them is to keep the military budget the same, but have much higher security, and the other one is to have the same security but cut the military budget down. And I guess the reason why I think we're taking the second approach is actually best to kind of even describe to the next section. Right. I think ethereum has enough security today, especially if attacks become much easier to recover from. And we actually don't even need to have too much spending going into keeping the wall up because it turns out that basically, even if someone successfully invades, so you can do this clever move where you just hard fork and you delete their army.
00:42:05.930 - 00:42:41.214, Speaker B: I want to get into that just to link folks into what you're talking about. The way ethereum right now and the way bitcoin right now pays for their military is generally through block reward, through issuance, through supply. Right. And bitcoin's approach is to cut that military budget, at least military budget denominated in bitcoin every four years. Cut it in half every four years. So where the bitcoin protocol government every four years, you know what, it's forced on you. We're going to slash your military by four.
00:42:41.332 - 00:42:41.950, Speaker C: Right.
00:42:42.100 - 00:42:44.754, Speaker B: At least denominated in bitcoin by two. By two.
00:42:44.792 - 00:42:45.700, Speaker C: Excuse me.
00:42:46.470 - 00:43:18.380, Speaker B: Ethereum's approach is basically to do something that's maybe more what the social contract is kind of called minimum necessary issuance or minimum viable issuance where it's like, hey, maybe we can drop this a whole lot more because we have a stronger defense system. And so that issuance essentially is what goes to pay for the military. And maybe that could be slashed, maybe that could be cut. Right now it's at four and a half percent or so, and we could go to something less than 1%.
00:43:19.950 - 00:43:20.700, Speaker C: Absolutely.
00:43:24.690 - 00:44:12.400, Speaker A: One of the theories I've had about, one of the reasons why proof of stake is more secure in the long term is that with that reduced issuance, that reduction of issuance actually compounds as a benefit over time. And I want to get your take on this because I don't know if this is real or not. And this is the same dynamic is present in EIP 1559. The more ether that's burned in EIP 1559, the more ether is unable to be leveraged in an attack against stakers. Right. The less ether we can make available to the secondary market, the less ether there's available for attackers to be able to grab and use that to attack the ethereum network. Is that a real thing? So the less ether that we issue is that over time adding to security.
00:44:14.130 - 00:44:49.580, Speaker C: That's definitely an interesting and kind of novel way to think about it. And I guess generally, yes, the less ether there is, and even the higher the price goes, the harder it is for an attacker to buy enough to successfully make an attack. And that's definitely one of the factors that contributes to security. And if you have miners that are just constantly selling millions of coins every year, then some of those coins are going to end up in the hands of people that might be interested in attacking it at some point.
00:44:50.590 - 00:45:18.740, Speaker A: So let's go into one of the grand ways that, say somebody did somehow manage to get their hands on enough ether to attack the chain. We actually have a way around this. And so one of the sections in this piece is titled attacks are much easier to recover from in proof of stake. Maybe we can talk about after an attack happens, what path to maintaining or restoring security does Ethereum have?
00:45:20.070 - 00:46:02.926, Speaker C: Yeah, so I think in the GPU case, the only defense is basically just waiting and hoping the attacker goes away, which has worked so far. Right. But as soon as an attacker comes that's persistent, you're basically screwed and you have to try to figure out something else. In an ASIC based system, you do have one form of defense, which is you just change the proof of work algorithm. And what that does is it basically kind of bricks all the asics. It renders them useless, but it bricks both the attacker's asics and the honest miners ASics, right. But if the attacker is willing to suffer that initial expense, then at that point it just turns into a GPU mined coin up until after a couple of years when people build ASiCs for the new algorithm again.
00:46:02.926 - 00:47:11.382, Speaker C: And so it just turns into the first paragraph and the attacker can just continue the attack really cheaply for as long as they want. In fact, I would even argue that it's worse than this, because if an attacker starts doing this and if the attacker commits to continuing to attack, then it actually takes away from the incentive to build ASICs for the new algorithm, because anyone building the ASICs knows that if the attacker is going to continue, then potentially those ASICs could get bricked a second time. So basically, the fact that bricking hurts both the attacker and honest miners actually really makes the game theory behind all of this even worse. So in the proof of stake case, basically, it gets much better, right, because we have this concept of slashing, right? So if you contribute to breaking the chain, you get slashed. And even if you contribute to breaking the chain as part of a 51% attack, you get slashed. Now, there are attacks that are hard to detect and hard to slash for. So a big one is like a 51% coalition censoring everyone else.
00:47:11.382 - 00:47:57.066, Speaker C: But you can get around this by using this wonderful trick that the bitcoin people invented in 2017 called the UASF, the user activated soft fork. Right? Basically, just users coordinate on participating in a minority chain, and they just abandon the majority chain that's censoring them. And actually, because of the way that the Casper FFG rules work, the attacker cannot legally kind of move over to the minority chain without contradicting themselves and getting slashed. And so the attacker just gets weaked and they lose about half their coins. Right. So basically, no matter how you attack the chain, it's going to be very expensive for the attacker, not very expensive for everyone who is not an attacker. And so the game is very asymmetric.
00:47:57.066 - 00:48:10.940, Speaker C: Right? Like, every time the attacker attacks, they lose a huge amount of money. And potentially the amount of coins that are burned as a result of an attack could even mean that an attack would cause the price of eth to go up.
00:48:12.030 - 00:48:51.430, Speaker A: So one of my favorite features about proof of stake is that if an attacker attacks Ethereum, it makes all of the stakers rich by default. Well, not by default, but it's highly likely that the price of ether goes up because of somebody's buying up all this ether. One question I had about this, using this as a defensive mechanism in proof of stake, this is relying on the social layer. Right? In this moment, security has migrated away from the actual code and moved into the social layer, which maybe it perhaps is one day, if this ever does happen, it would be coordinated via something like Twitter or Reddit. Can you talk about that dynamic?
00:48:52.490 - 00:49:37.250, Speaker C: Yeah. So there's definitely a lot of discomfort in relying on the social layer for consensus. But actually, I wrote about this quite a bit in my original 2014 article, the one where I'd say, called how I learned to love weak subjectivity. If you actually even just go in and Google for that. Now you can probably find it. So basically, the arguments that I make is that relying on social consensus is actually reasonable occasionally. It's just that social consensus is not something that you want to kind of keep leaning on forever, right? So the idea is basically that even bitcoin relies on social consensus to some extent.
00:49:37.250 - 00:50:59.886, Speaker C: The UASF that was proposed in 2016 was ultimately a form of social consensus overriding mining. So basically, hard forks are done with social consensus. Even the idea that if miners push a blockchain that would increase the supply to beyond 21 million, then people would reject that blockchain, is ultimately secured by social consensus. The difference between a malicious protocol change and a bug fix is social consensus. So relying on social consensus in these kind of extreme matters, and especially on matters where there is clearly one side which is an attack, and one side which is just trying to push the chain forward, is, I think, actually a reasonable thing to do. The thing that you don't want to do is you don't want to rely on social consensus too often, right? And the thing to keep in mind is that if you even think about how an attack on proof of work would be responded to, right, defenders of ASIC based proof of work will say, oh, if our 51% attack happens, we can just break the ASIC and we can change the algorithm. Right? Like, if you press them on it, they will say that this is a defense, but that defense as well.
00:50:59.886 - 00:51:08.740, Speaker C: It's also a social consensus. Like, changing the proof of work algorithm is also a form of social consensus overriding the code.
00:51:11.190 - 00:51:18.454, Speaker B: It's also striking that the price of bitcoin, price in itself is one layer of social consensus too.
00:51:18.652 - 00:51:20.360, Speaker C: It is indeed. Yeah.
00:51:21.130 - 00:52:21.558, Speaker A: And we've seen the idea of bricking asics that's played out a number of times, I believe, in the Manero community. So this is not hypothetical conversations. This is strategy that blockchain ecosystems have leveraged. Ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on Ethereum and just recently released Ave version two, which has a ton of cool new features that makes using Ave even more powerful. With Ave, you can leverage the full power of DFI money, legos, yield and composability all in one application. On Ave, there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield, and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol. If you have deposited collateral here, you can see me getting a 200 USDC loan against my portfolio of a number of different DFI tokens and ETH, I'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option, but I could choose the stable interest rate option if I wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently.
00:52:21.558 - 00:53:17.258, Speaker A: One of Ave's V two features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets, trade them on Uniswap, and then deposit them back into Ave. Ave does all of this for you, all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them. Check out the power of ave@ave.com. That's aave.com. You want to live a bankless life? You need to get a monolith Defi Visa card monolith is a one two punch of both an Ethereum smart contract wallet and an accompanying Visa card that lets you spend the money that you have in your Ethereum wallet everywhere where Visa is accepted. When you swipe your monolith Visa card at the grocery store or at a restaurant, it actually makes a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain that spends some of the money you hold in your monolith wallet. It's insanely cool, and it's one of the best tools out there for living a bankless but still normal life.
00:53:17.258 - 00:54:01.894, Speaker A: Monolith also offers on ramp services for getting your fiat money into the world of defi, so it's trivial to top up your monolith card if you ever need to, and your deposited money goes straight into your non custodial wallet. So your money is never held by a centralized intermediary. Because monolith is native Ethereum infrastructure, the money you hold in your monolith wallet still has the power of defi behind it. Swapping assets on uniswap or earning yield in Defi is at your fingertips. Go to monolith XYZ and sign up to get your monolith Visa card today. So let's move on to one of my favorite subjects, which is how proof of stake is more decentralized than Asics. Some people would call this a bold claim.
00:54:01.894 - 00:54:04.140, Speaker A: Vitalik, why can you make such a.
00:54:06.350 - 00:54:46.274, Speaker C: And I think we do need to break up proof of work into two categories, GPUs and Asics. There is a very decent case that GPU based proof of work is quite decentralized, and I'm happy to admit this, my qualm against the GPU mining is not about the decentralization, it's about the security right now. The problem with ASICs, on the other hand, is that in order to make an ASIC, you need millions of dollars of capital right now. You could say, oh, you don't have to make your own ASIC. You could buy an ASIC. But the reality is that if you're buying an ASIC, the side that's making the most profit is not going to be you. It's going to be the ASIC manufacturer.
00:54:46.274 - 00:54:46.582, Speaker C: Right?
00:54:46.636 - 00:54:48.150, Speaker A: People selling the shovels.
00:54:48.750 - 00:55:41.610, Speaker C: Exactly. In the long run, the game is very much one that's kind of skewed to benefit whoever can sell the best shovel and whoever can sell the best shovel has a lot of. They can potentially even sneak in code that could allow that ASIC to be bricked remotely. They could do all sorts of really evil things that are harder to do with if you're running the thing on general purpose hardware. So basically, ASIC based mining really does rely very heavily on this very small number of these very wealthy and powerful manufacturers. And so basically, if proof of stake means the rich gets richer, well, guess what? ASIC mining also means the rich get richer, except the bar that you need to pass in order to get richer. In the case of ASIC mining, it's something like $10 million.
00:55:41.610 - 00:55:49.820, Speaker C: But in the case of proof of stake, it's $20,000 today and much less than $20,000 in the future when staking pools become possible.
00:55:52.690 - 00:56:40.940, Speaker A: I've been chewing around the ideas of staking pools, and there's a bunch of different design parameters, but I think the staking pool that retains as much ethos of Ethereum as possible, which I think that there is a spectrum of. How much does a protocol or company on Ethereum retain the original ethos of the system? There's something to be said for that, and that's kind of where I turned my attention to rocket pool, where rocket pool is trying to become a staking pool for people to decentralize the amount of people that can participate in staking by being a pool, and then also decentralizing the nodes by making more total nodes available to be part of the Ethereum proof of stake consensus mechanism. When you think of rocket pool, is that what you think of?
00:56:41.890 - 00:57:01.140, Speaker C: Yeah, I think rocket pool is definitely one of the good examples of someone trying to do a good job. The ETH protocol is really explicitly designed to make decentralized staking with things like multiparty computation as easy as possible. So that's definitely the sort of direction that we're looking into.
00:57:01.590 - 00:57:20.230, Speaker B: There's also this subargument that you made here, Vitalik, that proof of staking is more censorship resistant. And that's basically because it's not on the electricity grid. Right. For instance, in the way that a GPU mining or ASIC mining footprint might be. Is that the main argument?
00:57:21.050 - 00:57:59.330, Speaker C: Yes, exactly. If you want, you're living in, say, Venezuela and you want to participate in the ethereum network, then if you're a proof of work miner, then realistically you're consuming huge amounts of electricity. You have to get huge amounts of hardware. If the government wants to find you, they can find you, right? It's not hard to see someone consuming that much electricity. These are techniques that they've already perfected for years to figuring out, finding people who are growing the wrong kind of plants in their backyard. This is fairly established.
00:57:59.410 - 00:58:21.530, Speaker B: It does make you wonder how long it would take a motivated government body like the United States or some other government body. Maybe let's not name different governments here to go seek out all of the major mining, bitcoin mining, or even Ethereum mining facilities in the world and just confiscate them, take them over by physical force.
00:58:21.610 - 00:58:24.240, Speaker A: These are now, yes.
00:58:26.210 - 00:58:59.720, Speaker B: I think it's kind of a little bit of a game maybe, that some in crypto play as if we've already faced off against these nation states that are actually trying to censor us realities. They're just not even trying. Is that is an advantage that may come into play. But there are also some advantages that you talked about here, Vitalik of proof of work. And I think we'd be remiss if we didn't mention the ways proof of work actually is superior because there are some tradeoffs can you talk about.
00:59:00.810 - 00:59:50.614, Speaker C: So these are what I think are the two best arguments in favor of proof of work. One is this critique that proof of stake feels more like a closed system, like there isn't this kind of new source of issuance that kind of brings fresh economic blood into the ecosystem. It feels like the system has this kind of naturally kind of entropic pressure to just be more of the same people by default. And this is definitely something that does kind of concern me to some extent. And the best rebuttal that I have is that in proof of stake, the rewards in general are going to be fairly low. Right. I think if proof of stake rewards were, say 10% of annually, then I could see that very quickly lead to a few stakers.
00:59:50.614 - 01:00:20.814, Speaker C: Very quickly I'm having a very large portion of the entire supply and just dominating everything. But here we're talking about validator rewards equal to up to 0.5% to 2%, probably closer to 0.5% of the total e supply. And the more validators are staking, the lower the interest rates get. Right. And so the amount of time needed for this factor to cause a large amount of concentration is huge, right? It's potentially over a century.
01:00:20.814 - 01:00:50.682, Speaker C: And on such timescales, does it really matter much? People want to spend money. They want to distribute their money among their children. They would want to give their money to charity. And so basically, if there are any natural economic pressures toward deconcentration at all, then they're going to have an effect that's larger than 0.5% every year, is basically the argument. Whereas if that rate was instead of 0.5%, something like 4.5%,
01:00:50.682 - 01:00:57.674, Speaker C: then I think this argument would actually have a much stronger case. So this is one of the reasons why I'm pushing for lower rewards.
01:00:57.802 - 01:01:12.820, Speaker B: And the reason people make this argument is, of course, is, as we stated earlier, staked ETh is almost like an everlasting ASIC. There's no depreciation, there's no capital depreciation, unlike a real world unit, doesn't deprecate. Exactly.
01:01:13.750 - 01:02:03.890, Speaker A: And notably, the people that crypto has accidentally, inadvertently made really wealthy are largely people that I'm guessing this is my gut take that weren't wealthy beforehand. Right? And so what's the point of hanging on to you every single last denomination of ether, if you can't sell it and have kind of a nice, more comfortable lifestyle? The people that have large supplies of ether are going to have to sell if they ever want that material impact to do something real in their lives. And so that's kind of what I think what you were alluding to, Vitalik, is that the passive income rewards to ether accrue slower than people find ways to sell their ether to buy a new house or new car or something. And so there's like this natural sort of incentive to let go of your ether.
01:02:05.930 - 01:02:12.840, Speaker B: What about the second point, Vitalik? We talked about weak subjectivity earlier. Does anything bear repeating here?
01:02:13.450 - 01:04:06.218, Speaker C: Weak subjectivity is this extremely fascinating topic, and I think it's been really the center of the debate almost ever since the beginning and up until this day. Basically, weak subjectivity is this really subtle thing. The idea is that in proof of work, you have this property that you have your client, and you can just start it at any time, and even if you've been offline for ten years, you could just start it up and you can stick to the valid chain, and you have all the canonical chain, and you have all of these economic guarantees in proof of stake. You can still do that, but it depends on what guarantees you want, right? So if the guarantees that you care about are in an honest majority model, so you just assume that the majority of people are nice, then you can still do that. But if you want to have a hard economic guarantee, so you want to have a guarantee that says tricking you requires the attacker to burn a huge amount of money. The way that proof of stake kind of promises strong economic guarantees, then you lose this property to some extent, right? And the reason why you lose this property to some extent is basically because if an attacker just who has, say, 51% of the stake creates a fake chain, and they convince you that the stake chain is the real chain, then normally the way that they will get punished for this is they would be slashed, right? Like if you create a fake chain that conflicts with the real chain that you already contributed to making, then some large portion of the validators on a sacks, you can make proofs, and you can publish those proofs into both chains, and you can burn the attacker's money. This is just like standard proof of stake theory, like how swashing works.
01:04:06.218 - 01:05:31.158, Speaker C: But the problem is, what if the attacker has already withdrawn the deposits that they use to make the attack by the time that they actually need to do the attack, right? So what if someone has been offline for a year and you feed them a chain that looks like a valid chain from the perspective of their client that was online for the last time a year ago, but back in present day reality, you've already taken out all your coins. And so whatever slashing happens can't actually hit you. So you could still trick them and you would not get slashed for it. And so if you want to be resistant against this attack, basically you just have to log on and kind of be online often enough that basically the time difference between any two times during which you come online is less than the time that it takes for something like one third of the validator set to be replaced. Right? And that number depends on the size of the validator set. It's like somewhere between a couple of days and a couple of months, depending on how many people are participating. That requirement, the requirement that in order to have a really kind of economically guaranteed level of security on which chain you're getting, you need to log on with your clients at least once every few months.
01:05:31.158 - 01:06:27.810, Speaker C: That is this week's subjectivity requirements. And the reason why a lot of people feel uncomfortable about this is because it basically means that if you're just joining the system for the first time, then for the first time that you log on, you need to basically find some third party source that basically tells you which chain is the canonical one that you should be following. Now, most of the time, this actually isn't a big deal because most of the time there aren't going to be 51% attackers trying to use their old keys to screw people over. And so there is really going to be one chain that has enough signatures, right. But in the extreme case where there are attackers that can buy up people's old keys, then basically in order to disambiguate, you do need to find someone to trust to give you that information. And deep fans of proof of work say that, oh my God, this is trust. This is fatal.
01:06:27.810 - 01:07:01.140, Speaker C: What are you doing? You've completely destroyed the point of cryptocurrency. But my argument is basically that this level of trust is a level of trust that we already have. So, for example, you already trust developers to tell you the most recent hard fork version. You already trust them to fix bugs. You already get software updates from them once every half a year or so. And so why not just leverage that existing level of trust and use it for proof of stake checkpointing as well?
01:07:04.870 - 01:07:18.600, Speaker A: So with proof of work and Nakamoto consensus, we have the ability to actually legitimately and concretely verify the amount of work that is done on a particular chain. We don't have that with proof of stake because we're not doing work.
01:07:19.790 - 01:07:47.394, Speaker C: We're verifying signatures that are signed by validators. And in order to recognize that those validators actually are real, you have to look at the state of the blockchain itself at the time, a couple of months ago to a year ago. Right. So the security of a proof of stake chain is definitely more kind of. It's not circular, it's more like a spiral. Right. It's like the security of the system today depends on the validity of the chain six months ago.
01:07:47.394 - 01:08:11.482, Speaker C: And the security of the chain six months ago depends on the validity of what happened twelve months ago. And so if you skip one of those steps, then if you're offline for longer than that period of time, then you do need some way to kind of help you disambiguate and come back online. But if you're there more often, then basically staying in sync with the chain is more of this necessarily dynamic process.
01:08:11.616 - 01:08:12.300, Speaker A: Right.
01:08:12.990 - 01:09:06.134, Speaker B: So here's kind of, I guess, my takeaway to just sort of summarize this article, and you guys jump in if you have some other things, if you are willing to get past this edge case weak subjectivity requirement, and you made some compelling arguments why that makes sense, or it's less important than others think. And if you're willing to get past this issue, that stake never depreciates. And so there is the capability for people in the system to continue accruing wealth, and you sort of mitigate against that with lower rewards overall, then what you end up with is a chain that is much more economically secure and also more efficient in that economic security. So you can do things like reduce issuance, reduce the cost to actually secure that network, essentially security per dollar.
01:09:06.262 - 01:09:06.940, Speaker C: Exactly.
01:09:10.270 - 01:09:17.726, Speaker B: That's what proof of stake provides, at least under Ethereum. Right, because there are other flavors of proof of stake. But yes. Would you add anything to that?
01:09:17.748 - 01:09:20.778, Speaker C: Vitalik no, I think in general, that's a great summary.
01:09:20.954 - 01:09:21.998, Speaker B: Very cool.
01:09:22.164 - 01:10:03.710, Speaker A: And Vitalik, when a lot of the design decisions behind proof of stake and when you verbalize your arguments and kind of just thought out loud about weighing the pros and cons the way that you did, that turns to the next article that we want to talk about, which is convexity versus, and we're just burning through your articles here so you can put out a blog post faster than anyone. And I totally aligned with this article, and Ryan and I chewed on it together and had some conversations about the implications of this. Before we get into those conversations, maybe you can kind of give us the synopsis on convex versus concave dispositions.
01:10:04.770 - 01:11:14.690, Speaker C: Yeah, so I think the core idea here is basically that whenever there is a trade off and there's a choice between kind of taking one path and taking another path, one of the kind of more subtle differences between how people view that trade off is basically how they view the kind of extremes as opposed to the options in the middle. Right? So basically, do they view it as the sort of situation where the moderate option is kind of more likely to be better than the extreme options, or do they view it as this scenario where it is one or the other, and if you try to mix the two together, then it just completely doesn't make any sense. And it really is either this or that. And so those two graphs that are right there, they do a good job of kind of showing what the perspective is, right. Basically, the graph on the left, the concave worldview, you have a graph that's kind of sloaked downward. So it's kind of like a hill, right. So there's always some option in the middle that's best.
01:11:14.690 - 01:12:18.534, Speaker C: But whether it's kind of in the middle but much closer to the left or in the middle, much closer to the right. That's something you can legitimately argue on. But then as you go further to the extremes, then eventually on either side, it just starts becoming worse. Versus the convex worldview, which looks less, the chart looks less like a hill and more like a valley, where you want to be either on one side or the other side. In the middle is the worst place to be. Again, this starts off being very abstract, but once we kind of go forward and go a few paragraphs down, we can see where it starts becoming more concrete and where we could see some specific examples of what concave and convex means. Right? So here I just give us some examples of what kinds of things someone with a concave disposition versus a convex disposition might say one kind of concave statement, going to the extremes has never been good for us.
01:12:18.534 - 01:13:01.810, Speaker C: You can die from being too hot or too cold. We need to find the balance between the two that's just right. If you implement only a little bit of a philosophy, you can pick the parts that are the best and avoid the parts that are risky. But if you insist on going to the extremes, then once you've picked the low hanging fruit, the next fruit that you have to pick are going to. You'll be forced to look harder and harder, and you'll have smaller and smaller benefits, and the risks might multiply and outweigh the whole thing. The opposing philosophy, the philosophy that you favor less, probably has some value too. And so you should generally try to combine the benefit, the best parts of both, and definitely avoid things that the opposing philosophy continues to considers to be extremely terrible, just in case they have more of a point than you realized.
01:13:01.810 - 01:13:31.050, Speaker C: And then some examples of convex statements. One is we need to focus. Otherwise we risk becoming a jack of all trades master of none. Another example of a convex concept is kind of the slopery slope concept. So if we take even a few steps down that road, it'll become a slopery slope and only pull us down even further until we end up in the abyss. There's only two stable positions, either here or there, and we want to stay here. If you give an inch, they'll take a mile.
01:13:31.050 - 01:13:54.950, Speaker C: Whether we're following this philosophy or that philosophy, we should just be following something and stick to it. Making a wishywashy kind of mix of everything doesn't make sense. After this, I get into what's probably the kind of motivating example of this idea for me, which is basically the bitcoin versus ethereum.
01:13:58.250 - 01:14:45.720, Speaker B: Before we get there, I feel like I've met these two types of people. I've met the binary thinker, the convex disposition thinker, where it's just like you're with or against me kind of individual, right? And then I've definitely met the concave disposition, which is a bit more the pragmatist. I could see it this way, I could see it that way. Why don't we find the balance in between? And one of those definitely sounds like more of an ethereum, not to stereotype. And one of those sounds definitely more like a bitcoiner. Again, not to stereotype. Part of me wonders how much people are just hardwired into these modes from birth and genetics and whatever happens to them in the early ages, because I don't know.
01:14:45.720 - 01:14:50.054, Speaker B: I've definitely met these types of people and I'm not sure how much they can kind of help it.
01:14:50.172 - 01:15:20.100, Speaker A: And it's definitely noted in the crypto industry, when you come into this world, you find yourself quickly moving into a camp of sorts, like usually bitcoiners or ethereums. And you kind of find yourself in to be one or the other. And there never really seems to be any of this moment of flux where people are confused. They just kind of come to find themselves aligned with one of their particular communities. And I think you've totally tapped onto a very real parameter of personality that I think would predispose someone for one community or the other.
01:15:22.390 - 01:16:31.078, Speaker C: No, definitely. I think it's definitely a really interesting question to what extent someone's disposition toward this is either genetic or just like some cultural thing that's like so deep, like 5000 year old or whatever, that it might as well be genetic. If that's true, then that does mean that, for example, even if you personally like ethereum more than bitcoin, that there's just no way that you're ever going to convince 100% of the world population to also be in that same camp. And so you just have to acknowledge that bitcoin is going to continue to exist and there will always be some constituency that it appeals to. And if you're a bitcoin person, then you'll have to kind of pretty much admit the opposite. So if people really are, and if different in that way, then that does also just say something for kind of maximalism versus pluralism in the world. And I guess just one of the nice things about cryptocurrency as opposed to say, traditional nation states is that it's just so much easier to kind of sort yourself into the community that reflects.
01:16:31.094 - 01:17:37.514, Speaker A: Your values more so I want to ask you about your opinion as to the scalability of these social organizations that people find themselves in. So the way that I interpreted the convexity versus concavity graphs, like one is a u shape and one is a n shape, right? And so if you put a ball on both of those, on the concavity, it rolls off to the edges, right? It falls off to the edge, and then there's like a pit that the ball would fall into. And my mind goes to what Amin Soleimani calls a Moloch trap, right? A little trap where people fall into where the convexity is a valley, right? Rocks that fall down to the bottom of the valley, the center of the valley. So my gut take is that a convex worldview, or convexity is a more scalable group of coordinated people with the same opinions. Because they tend to converge upon pragmatism, they tend to converge upon the same ideologies, whereas the concavity seems to find itself in falling into 1000 different traps in different directions.
01:17:37.642 - 01:18:54.658, Speaker C: Would you actually, I think just one quick way to fix your analogy. Unfortunately, I think, please. It's the concave worldview, right? That's the one that's more inclined to stay in the middle. The problem is that in economics, the concept of utility is like positive utility is better, right? And so the graph here is how good? Whereas the gravity analogy is like he wants to fall down, right? And so down as the direction of the tendency or preference if he wants to talk about fundamental physical forces that way. So look at it upside down. I guess if you want to analogize it that way, but yes, but module of that, it's definitely a great way of looking at the issue. I think one of the challenges with the convex worldview is basically that if your worldview was that right now we're on the top of a mountain and we are going to fall on the left side of the mountain versus the right side of the mountain, then your first instinct is going to be, well, which side of the mountain seems less bad to fall down? And we're just going to fight like hell to make everyone fall down that side as fast as possible to avoid the greater evil of people falling down the other side of the mountain.
01:18:54.658 - 01:19:10.750, Speaker C: And then if you have people on both sides, they're kind of both thinking that way, then you basically end up getting into a tug of war. And I think that's definitely a very kind of good consequence of that intuition pump.
01:19:12.770 - 01:19:50.090, Speaker B: For those listening in who maybe haven't seen that yet. Do we have some examples from the bitcoin community or from the Ethereum community to kind of maybe prove this out. I consider you almost in this article, like it's a little bit philosophy, but it's a little bit anthropology as well, right? Where you're like, studying the culture of bitcoin and the decisions that the culture has made and contrasting that to the decisions and the culture that ethereum has. But what are some good examples of this? Was the block size debate a good example of this cultural temperament?
01:19:51.870 - 01:20:42.358, Speaker C: Absolutely. If you remember the block size debate, basically the block size at the beginning was 1. There were all these arguments about, do we make blocks unlimited? Do we make them 20 megabytes? Do we make them eight megabytes? Do we do some two, four, eight sort of thing? And eventually the side that ended up winning is very close to the extreme small block side. It basically says blocks are 1. There's this one kind of soft fork called Segwit, which de facto increases the block size to 2.3 megabytes. And then there's basically no increase kind of going from there, right? And if you remember, during the block size debate in the big block camp, there were people who were in favor of moderate increases.
01:20:42.358 - 01:21:55.140, Speaker C: So people who were in favor of eight, but not 20 or four, but not eight. And there were people who were in favor of just not having a block size limit at all because they felt that the system just needs to be able to support as much capacity as it needs, or the market should be deciding block size. There's a bit of a tangent about how that particular claim is crazy because the mechanism isn't really a market. But basically you did have these people who wanted very big. And I remember one of the arguments that the very big block people would make is basically that, well, if you oppose what the small block people are trying to do, then you should follow that thinking to the, quote, logical conclusion, and you should realize that ultimately the correct approach is no block size limit at all. And I remember being fascinated by that because, okay, so basically, if you're saying that moving from point x to point x plus one, if you support moving from x to x plus one, then you should also support moving from x plus ten to x plus eleven. Like, no, I don't believe that at all.
01:21:55.140 - 01:21:57.090, Speaker C: What kind of worldview is this?
01:21:57.160 - 01:22:00.622, Speaker B: That's a convex worldview. That's a very convex worldview.
01:22:00.766 - 01:22:29.414, Speaker C: It is indeed. So that was convex people on the big blog side. Right? And then convex people on the small blog side. I argued against them in a lot of places like Reddit whatever, all the time. Right? A lot of the smaller blockers would say things. I would say, oh, no. See, we need to compromise, and we need to make sure that it's possible to read the blockchain, and it's also possible to write to the blockchain.
01:22:29.414 - 01:23:07.378, Speaker C: You need to send the transactions to the blockchain at affordable rates. And we need to find some way to compromise between those two. And they're like, no, either the system is decentralized or it isn't. And if it's 95% decentralized, then really that just means it's on a track toward not being decentralized at all. And either you can verify the thing or you can't, and everyone should be totally verifying. Yet anything that involves any degree of trust just is trust. And we should all just dismiss any level of trust as being basically the same as just using PayPal.
01:23:07.378 - 01:23:40.242, Speaker C: And I remember also finding this worldview, like, very unreasonable and dogmatic as well. Actually, on that specific issue, I wrote another Vitalik, CA article recently, if you remember the one that's called on trust models. This was from August, right? Like, this is the one where I talk about the differences between, if you go to philosophy section, I think it's there. Third one, there it is, 2020, August 20. Basically, there's n event trust models. There's n over two Event trust models. There's one event trust.
01:23:40.242 - 01:24:04.330, Speaker C: There's zero event trust. Scroll down a bit and you see the graph right there it is. The thing that I argued is that one event trust is actually much, much closer to zero event trust than it is to n out of two event trust. Right. And on the graph, it really does seem like it is much closer. But a person who has a convex perspective on trust would. No, no.
01:24:04.330 - 01:24:16.830, Speaker C: Either you're at zero event or your trust. And if you're trust, then you're on Team PayPal. And PayPal is going to support Ethereum now. So we can't hate PayPal. I don't know. Who are we supposed to hate?
01:24:18.290 - 01:25:32.854, Speaker B: What's interesting about it is because this convex bent, at first blush, it looks very strong because the community absolutely stands for things. There shalt be only 21 million thou shalt not print more bitcoin ever. But then when you kind of look at it a little bit more, and maybe this is just the concave in me kind of speaking. But you also see this brittleness. I wonder, quite frankly, what the convex bitcoiner community is going to do if it finds out that it needs more security than 21 million bitcoin. At some point, as these happenings continue into the future, does that convex mode just tear at the center and become brittle? Does the community completely fracture apart because it can't make any compromise on anything at all, it has to stick with sort of this maximalist type of ideology and philosophy. So it's weird because it appears that there's a strength to this philosophy, but there's also a brittleness to it, and I'm not sure how to see that.
01:25:33.052 - 01:26:12.078, Speaker C: I definitely think that's a very good way of describing the trade off, like this concept of shelling fences and just setting hard boundaries and saying we're just never ever going beyond them. That's definitely a powerful thing. It definitely can be a scalable form of social coordination. It can be very emotionally appealing as well. But yes, it is brittle. And as soon as you enter into kind of territory that you were not expecting, it can easily end up backfiring on you. In the case of bitcoin, if they discovered that transaction fees are not enough, they basically have three choices.
01:26:12.078 - 01:26:42.550, Speaker C: One of them is print more than 21 million. The second is switch to proof of stake. And the third is just accept that the blockchain will get 51% attacked from time to time, and you'll just have people, sometimes days worth of transactions being reverted. And it's surprised to be, to an insane, extreme extent, just how many people are willing to accept the third option. Right. Have you seen any of this, even on Twitter?
01:26:42.630 - 01:26:43.900, Speaker B: I've seen a ton of it.
01:26:45.010 - 01:26:53.410, Speaker C: No, you don't understand. Transactions ever being final was never one of the intended properties of bitcoin.
01:26:53.750 - 01:27:00.930, Speaker B: Pierre Richard makes this exact argument that it's no big deal. Right? Like, we wait days for transactions to finalize.
01:27:01.510 - 01:27:04.610, Speaker A: Would you characterize this as a Moloch trap?
01:27:07.110 - 01:27:57.010, Speaker C: Good question. Is this a Moloch trap? I guess. Well, a Moloch trap would be a situation where everyone or most people want the situation to go in a certain direction, but just because they can't get along and ends up going in the opposite direction. I guess. In that bitcoin case, would it be a Moloch trap? One possibility would be that people actually, literally, genuinely prefer the blockchain breaking once every few weeks to violating either one of the core tenets. But I think what would happen in reality is that there's a small minority that genuinely feels that way. But the average bitcoiner, I think, is more pragmatic, and they really would rather switch to proof of stake or add a small amount of issuance than accept that state of affairs.
01:27:57.010 - 01:28:14.170, Speaker C: And so I could definitely see just coordination failures between those two leading to a split or just taking a really long time to resolve the situation. And I definitely categorize that as being Moloch. Well, a split is not necessarily Moloch.
01:28:15.310 - 01:29:56.554, Speaker A: So, Vitalik, it was very obvious to me when you were writing this that it was coming from the design philosophy of blockchains, the design philosophy of crypto economic networks. But on the bankless program, Ryan and I talk about how these crypto economic networks are very comparable to a neo nation, a new generation of a nation, right? And so when we're talking about design philosophy of a blockchain network, we're also kind of talking about the design philosophy of a new type of social organization, a new kind of nation. And so when Ryan and I resonated with the concave view, it seemed to be out of an endeavor. And also when we kind of came to the conclusion that Ethereum seems to be resonating with the concave view that Ethereum is trying to offer this credibly neutral layer. And what is credible neutrality, other than being in the middle, being a pragmatist about the middle of a curve. And so when a good nation state, to me, allows people to go about their day and achieve their personal goals without having any sort of convexity of the design dispositions of a nation state or a crypto economic network, getting in the way of this individual's goals, right? Like, we want to empower the individual, but it's important to have an organization where the whims of one individual doesn't impact the whims of another individual in achieving their daily goals. And so that's where the neutrality of a nation state or the neutrality of a crypto economic network comes into play in order to really empower the individual without enabling them to get in the way of empowering others.
01:29:56.554 - 01:30:00.540, Speaker A: Was this kind of what you were thinking about when you wrote about this?
01:30:01.470 - 01:31:19.126, Speaker C: I think concave versus convex dig definitely has implications going far beyond out of crypto politics. And I think nation state issues are definitely one place where this becomes also a really important concern down the line. I even give examples around nation state issues like dealing with the coronavirus and taxation, and how convexity and concavity and war, how they end up kind of affecting those. One philosophical thing that you could argue is that even the concept of freedom is to some extent a fundamentally concave concept, right? Because one way to think about freedom is that if side a is my way of is better, and everyone should live according to my way of life. And side b, as your way of life is better and everyone should live according to your way of life, then freedom basically says, well, people who like my way of life live according to my way of life, and people who like your way of life live according to your way of life. And that is in some way a compromise between those two options, right? You can definitely look at kind of concavity in that way. But then, as we see, there's a lot of kind of different layering here.
01:31:19.126 - 01:32:19.546, Speaker C: You can look at concavity in a lot of different ways. You can even look at concavity versus convexity as something affecting your personal decisions. So a bit further above, in the case of bitcoiners, the carnivory thing was one great example of this is, like proof that this actually does get into. This is convexity, right? A concave person would say, oh, you should eat a balanced diet, and you should make sure to have some salad, have some good beater fish or whatever you like, have some grains. But a convex person would say, no, there's one thing that's healthiest, and you should figure that out using research, and you should just eat it, right? So carnivores are convex, vegans are also convex. But on the other hand, normal people end up being more concave. On the diet issue, I find myself more concave, too.
01:32:19.546 - 01:32:20.730, Speaker C: What a coincidence.
01:32:21.710 - 01:33:19.740, Speaker B: It's funny, because this is the type of article that you have to kind of chew on, and you can apply to so many areas of life. But I will tell you that one gift it gave me is actually understanding crypto, twitter, and understanding bitcoiner culture and ethereum culture, because for so long, Vitalik, I just didn't understand it, to be honest. I didn't understand the perspective where you'd kind of explain something, or you talk about something, and there'd be still such a chasm, such a delta. And it's because of these totally different worldviews. Once you see it, it kind of explains everything. I'm curious where you got this mental model of the world. I mean, have you seen anything like this elsewhere? Were you influenced by anything when you were thinking about concave versus convex? I haven't seen anything quite that illustrates it in this way.
01:33:20.450 - 01:33:56.166, Speaker C: Yeah. I'm not sure if this exact presentation existed in some literature before. Concavity and convexity are definitely things that you would understand in mathematics, and concavity is definitely a thing in economics, for example. And I talk about taxes below, and that's one of those examples there. But I think it just took years of brushing up against this kind of a versus b logic and eventually just figuring out, yes, this is where the divide is.
01:33:56.348 - 01:34:26.020, Speaker B: So what are the implications here? Does this mean that at some level that ethereans should try less hard to explain their positions to people who are very convex in thinking, because there's just going to be a delta there that can't be passed, and maybe we should focus more on finding the other concave people in the world. Is that one implication? What are your thoughts on the implications here?
01:34:26.950 - 01:35:43.242, Speaker C: It could be. I think there's definitely people who I think are just attracted to the convex perspectives in a way that would be very hard to kind of get them to find the Ethereum camp appealing. And maybe that's okay. And again, that's just like one property opposition to bitcoin maximalism. Yes, there can be these multiple ecosystems and they can all kind of prosper within their communities. And I think ultimately for crypto to become mainstream, yes, it does needs to just to kind of reach out to the wider world and explain its perspective to the wider world more? I do think that we should continue kind of making the case for Ethereum, and I think one of the ways in which I think the philosophy here can help is that I think Ethereum sometimes gets framed as not having values because it's not willing to just dogmatically take a direction and stick to it. But I don't think that's not necessarily true.
01:35:43.242 - 01:36:08.980, Speaker C: Right? Because I think Ethereum has values, it has things that it's pushing toward. But concavity is a good mental model to explain how it's possible to believe in something, but at the same time be moderate about it. And it's possible to actually have this as something you believe and not just something you are, because you just don't know what you are.
01:36:09.670 - 01:36:28.490, Speaker A: So say we fast forward into 2030 years into the future, and Ethereum is maximally successful to the degree that we all hope that one day it becomes. Do you attribute that success to a concave mindset on behalf of Ethereum?
01:36:30.350 - 01:37:52.594, Speaker C: I definitely think the concave mindset is a very good one for at least what Ethereum's goals are, which I think involve a kind of broad adoption and bringing decentralization and permissionlessness to basically large groups of regular people. On the bitcoin side, it's interesting, right, because I think bitcoin is kind of of two minds in terms of what its goal is. One of its minds is basically replacing gold and becoming the new digital gold, whereas the other one is, let's focus specifically on censorship resistant wealth transfer for people in authoritarian regimes, or in general people. Every regime is authoritarian to some non zero extent. So people who brush up against that side of things and having a convex approach, it can definitely buy you a kind of success in that second side of things, because there really are people who just need fairly extreme trade offs. Though at the same time, I do think that Ethereum is also fairly capable of satisfying those tradeoffs. Except Ethereum's approach is different, and it relies more, I think, on just creating this thing that provides broad value for larger groups of people.
01:37:52.594 - 01:38:15.850, Speaker C: Even if in some cases the average value per person could end up being a bit lower than literally saving your life, rescuing your life savings. Ethereum can still literally rescue your life savings in some context. But the median use cases are, I guess, a little bit more closer to average people's experiences.
01:38:16.750 - 01:39:10.874, Speaker B: There's an element too, I wonder almost in the bitcoin culture community if that second pool that you mentioned, that convex pool, who has formerly been ardent supporters of censorship resistance, if that's not being driven out a little bit too, because it just seems like this narrative and this need for price go up has driven out a lot of the original values. And maybe I'm being a little harsh on bitcoin or culture, but it just seems this embrace of kind of crypto banks, if you will, and custody and institution, that wasn't part of the original convex plan for bitcoiner. So there's almost this hollowing out effect where you get this convex culture around things like 21 million and number go.
01:39:10.912 - 01:39:13.086, Speaker A: Up, number go up, everything else.
01:39:13.188 - 01:39:53.770, Speaker B: When our friend Nick Carter talked on Bloomberg about the happening being priced in, and he was absolutely crucified, because apparently that's not canon with some convex members of the bitcoiner community. It's those types of things that have become more important than elements of censorship resistance. So there's almost like this hollowing out type of effect of the values that at least I thought used to matter in bitcoiner culture. I don't know if you guys observed that, but it's something that has been surprising to me. These are not necessarily the extremists die for the cause martyrs that maybe they once were. I'm not sure. Maybe that's harsh.
01:39:54.190 - 01:40:59.130, Speaker C: Yeah. One of the kind of big fault lines I'm seeing is basically that the story that small blocker values were originally sold under is that you don't need that much security on the base chain because the lightning network can basically make up for it. Right? And they put a lot of their kind of heart and soul into the lightning network. But what's been happening over the last couple of years is that the lightning network has only received fairly limited adoption, and instead we're seeing liquid start taking off. And liquid is of course a permissioned consortium chain. So basically the same sort of thing that they denounced as evil back in 2014. People are just like they're cheering on etfs and bank the same kind of institutional adoption that doesn't actually translate to any kind of decentralization and some level of those things is definitely kind of natural and good and good for adoption.
01:40:59.130 - 01:42:32.380, Speaker C: But it does seem like the problem for me is when it gets to the point where it's so extreme that these people are literally start excusing the growing lack of accessibility of fully self sovereign options, right? Basically, when they start saying oh, it's totally fine if centralized intermediaries become used for most things, that's when it really starts kind of turning me off. So it feels like it's kind of just letting the, it feels like it's letting the wind of kind of historical default push it in a direction and then retroactively kind of retconning the narrative to say that it always was that direction all along. Right? And there's definitely a big part of that that's kind of difficult for me to relate to. I think someone who is honest about maximizing censorship resistance would realize that intermediary minimization is a pragmatic and needed part of censorship resistance. And if you want to minimize intermediaries, you need to have the base chain be able to provide more things, potentially even add some level of risk to that, making the base chain a bit heavier. But if you just care about permissionlessness of the base chain, but you don't care as much about the ability to do trustless and permissionless things on top, then that definitely gets to the point where it starts losing me.
01:42:33.810 - 01:42:42.794, Speaker A: Well, Vitalik, I really appreciated your post because it allows me to put so many of your other posts into perspective.
01:42:42.842 - 01:42:43.054, Speaker C: Right?
01:42:43.092 - 01:43:03.480, Speaker A: Like, I understand your proof of stake post better because I've read your concavity versus convexity post. So thank you for producing this work, and also thank you for coming on the bankless show to share some of that work in a new format to a new audience. And also, congratulations on the e two deposit contract, Genesis as well.
01:43:04.570 - 01:43:07.014, Speaker C: Thank you very much. It was good to be here.
01:43:07.132 - 01:43:08.580, Speaker B: Thanks italic see you later.
