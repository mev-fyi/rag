00:00:01.210 - 00:00:44.378, Speaker A: Yo, welcome bankless nation. Something cool recently just happened. Andre, the famous developer of the Wiren system, just released this new system called Stable Credit USD. And it's pretty unlike, and also very like other protocols that we've seen in this space. And so I've gone on this little journey to try and understand it, right? And so I'm going to go ahead, share my screen, and I've gone through a little process, and this is going to end with me bringing on Andre onto the bankless YouTube to walk me through the actual system. But before we get there, we're going to go on this journey together. Right? Because this was a journey for me, and this is going to be a journey for you, too.
00:00:44.378 - 00:01:11.022, Speaker A: All right, so on September 10, which is. That was yesterday. Wow. Today is the day that the sushi swap founder gave all of the ether that they stole back. So that's already, like, pretty insane. Never a dull day in defi, but. Okay, so yesterday, urine finance tweeted out, introducing stable credit, a new protocol for decentralized lending, stablecoins and amms and Chris Black comments.
00:01:11.022 - 00:01:52.314, Speaker A: I read this three times and I still don't fully get it. Somebody explained like, I'm five, please. And so this is kind of what I'm trying to do. All right, so here it is, introducing stable credit, a new protocol for decentralized lending, stablecoins and amms. Andre, who wrote this, goes through some of the existing infrastructure that we all know. Like you can mint a token, a synthetic asset, by providing a contract with a valuable asset, largely ether, right? And this is Dai and Makerdao. And then you can take this a little bit further and you can turn this into a lending protocol like compound or Aave, where you can provide ether or another asset as collateral.
00:01:52.314 - 00:02:46.058, Speaker A: And this gives you a line of credit in ether, in dollar value terms. And therefore, then you can borrow other collaterals that other people have provided as debt, right? And so, like, you submit ether, and then you can borrow WBTC or lend token or synthetics, and you can do that in aave or in compound. And then there's automated market makers that we know of, like Uniswap and balancer. And so Andre puts this in an interesting way where he says uniswap creates a tension between two assets. So if you provide ether and dai, it attempts to keep the ratio between these two assets equal in dollar value terms, right? So if ether becomes more expensive, traders will add dai to the pool to take out ether because of the arbitrage. Then the pool has more die than ether. And this equates to ether becoming more expensive because the ratio between these two shifted.
00:02:46.058 - 00:03:19.286, Speaker A: And now that is the new canonical ratio. So if you had one etH, one die, and then a trader, as one died, removes half an eth, then that half an eth is now worth two die. Now it's the new price. And we know these things, we're all comfortable with these things, I hope, if you're on the bankless journey with us. And then there's something called a utilization ratio. And this is where things start to get a little bit unique. And Andre writes, automated market makers can also be seen as decentralized utilization ratios.
00:03:19.286 - 00:03:51.974, Speaker A: If we consider a lender has 100 die and zero die is borrowed, then their utilization ratio is 0%. The cost to borrow one die is one die. This means that there is no premium to borrow die, but if there is 90 borrowed die, then that utilization ratio is 90%. And this creates a borrow premium. The cost to borrow one die is greater than one die. So this is where I start to get a little bit confused. And this is where I went to DC investor and then Andre himself eventually for help understanding this.
00:03:51.974 - 00:04:39.990, Speaker A: So Uniswap, as we just explained, know Uniswap reprices things based on the ratio of two assets. And Andre is taking this a different spin, but it's also the same thing. But he's just, instead of calling it like a ratio and therefore a price of the two assets, he's considering this rather to be a utilization ratio by a protocol. Right? It's how much of an asset has a protocol utilized, and it's using the AmM curve to determine this. I'm still wrapping my head around this, so if that was confusing to you, it's still confusing to me. And then Andre goes into something that he calls single sided amm exposure. And he writes, based off the concept, a tokenized transfer token.
00:04:39.990 - 00:05:56.698, Speaker A: We designed yswap exchange more information here, and then I'll link this article in the show notes. The concept was simple. In amms such as Uniswap, you have token a, eth, and also in EtH to token b. A trade of token a to token b can be described as token a to eth to token b, right? So what he's saying is like, all right, and uniswap v two actually does this, right? So say you want to trade your synthetics token for ave for lend, right? And so you want to go from SNX to lend, but the SNX lend trading pair in uniswap, I bet you probably doesn't even exist. And if it does, it's extremely illiquid. But ether is extremely liquid, right? Ether is the most liquid asset on ethereum, and so it's much more advantageous to go from synthetics to ether and then ether to lend token, right? And so using some basic algebra, right? Since you can just cut ether out of that same equation, and then you just go from token a to token b, you just use ether in the middle, right? And so ether, Andre writes, can be seen as a transfer token mechanism, right? It itself does not need to have value when it is created destroyed. It must simply abide by creation destruction rules.
00:05:56.698 - 00:06:40.300, Speaker A: This allowed us to develop an amm with a single sided exposure. I'm not too sure what he meant by this when it's created and destroyed. I think he's talking about a new possible token, a new token that can be created and destroyed to facilitate this token transfer mechanism. And that's what I think this stable credit token is. Right? Stable credit is a protocol that combines tokenized debt, stablecoins, lending, amms, and single sided amm exposure to create a completely decentralized lending protocol. So here's where he gets into explaining stable credit. You can provide any asset and create tokenized credit called stable credit with this process.
00:06:40.300 - 00:07:19.918, Speaker A: And the cool thing is, it's very similar to synthetics, where stable credit USD can actually just be stable credit. Insert your asset of choice here, right? This is just USD is just an oracle, right? He says it also could be the euro or the japanese yen, or it could be gold, or it could be bitcoin. It could be like stable credit ether, for all I know. And so here's the process. So you come and you provide an amount of collateral, right? Like $1,000 of USDC. The USDC price oracle is used to determine the value of one USDC. So you may need to know that this thing actually has a price, right? And so this is using Chainlink.
00:07:19.918 - 00:07:57.614, Speaker A: Shout out to the chainlink Marines. And then, so the protocol mints the value of the collateral you deposited times the USD value of stable credit USD, I think. Then the USDC and the stable credit USD is provided into the 50 50 automated market maker, which is uniswap. He's talking about Uniswap here. Then the protocol calculates the system utilization ratio up to a maximum of 75%. And then the utilization ratio value of the supplied USDC is minted as a stable credit USD. All right, so that's kind of where I got lost.
00:07:57.614 - 00:08:38.194, Speaker A: And if you just did, sorry, but we're going to fix that at this point. Your stable credit USD is your lending credit. You can use it to borrow or aka buy via the amm, buy via uniswap other assets so that if another user provides link as collateral, you can borrow link by selling your lending credit. When you want to repay your debt, you can sell the link back for stable credit USD, pay off your debt, and receive your USDC. All right, so that was a lot. So let's go into what DC tried to interpret, another urine announcement, which, if I'm interpreting correctly, could be a huge effing deal. And here's that tweet that we started with.
00:08:38.194 - 00:09:20.282, Speaker A: Details are sketchy, but here's my take. I'm thinking of this like an asset collective. Deposit an asset and then you get borrowing rights up to the required collateralization ratio for that asset. If the value of your initially deposited asset declines below the acceptable collateralization ratio, you lose rights to your deposit due to liquidation, which in this case could be virtual. Read on. This effectively creates a new single sided AMM lending service, allowing to deposit any supported asset and mint a new yearn debt token, which is also a stablecoin. This is similar to how DAI works, deposit ETh or any other asset, print Dai.
00:09:20.282 - 00:09:56.730, Speaker A: Now, all of a sudden, that debt token becomes a currency which you can use with the urine AmM exchange to buy any token that the user has deposited there. I'm not sure if this uses a pricing curve structure by traditional amm, but I lean towards no. If that's correct, that means that you could run out of certain assets from time to time, meaning that you will not be able to withdraw your originally provided collateral. Could be wrong on this DC, we're about to get into this. He is right. But also meaningfully, no. You will be able to withdraw your assets probably based off of incentives.
00:09:56.730 - 00:10:34.230, Speaker A: You will still have your available collateral ceiling and debt tail and stablecoin, and you could go buy more of that asset, or wait until someone redeposits it and pay off your debt and withdraw. Let's see. A simple way to explain this is imagine one giant maker multicolateral vault accepting all sorts of assets. All right, so that's like the best summary so far that we've gotten. It's one gigantic maker vault. But think of it also like a compound or AAVE, where you can deposit many assets into them. Or yeah, multicolateral also works in that model.
00:10:34.230 - 00:11:31.158, Speaker A: You deposit any acceptable asset, print die up to that amount, then you can buy any collateral that's been deposited into the same vaults by anyone else using that printed Dai. Your debt obligation remains. And if you want to recover your initially deposited collateral, you need to pay off that debt directly. And you may have times when you can't recover your initial collateral due to shortage of the asset based off of the utilization then so I take this, what DC investor just put in the east finance subreddit, and I go and I tweet Andre, it's like, hey, can you confirm that this is cause, like, DC isn't totally true either? And Andre goes, yes, it's solid. Only points to a difference that the pricing curve uses standard constant product market maker implementation to add a premium discount to utilization ratios. Andre explains this very well in the interview that we're about to get to. And so that's kind of where we are.
00:11:31.158 - 00:12:02.382, Speaker A: That's kind of where we are. So I'll link to all of these things in the show notes, so check them out. Let's go ahead and get right into the interview with Andre where he can explain this better himself. But first, talk about Aave. Ave is a money market protocol which I've mentioned so far, which you can deposit assets into and then borrow other assets as well. Right? And so the cool thing about Ave is that you have both the option to have a variable interest or a stable interest. Stable is nice people like stability.
00:12:02.382 - 00:12:47.650, Speaker A: It allows you to have long term thinking. So if you want to get a line of credit and stable, you can go and deposit assets into Aave and get that. Also monolith. Monolith is this very awesome system where if you want to spend your dai in the real world, you can get the monolith defi account, which has an actual defi card, like a real life debit card that connects to your smart contract wallet on Ethereum, so that when you swipe your debit card, you make a transaction on Ethereum. So check them out at monolith Xyz. Unstoppable domains unstoppable domains is dope because you can generate a single human readable name for all of your crypto assets. Bitcoin, litecoin, ethereum.
00:12:47.650 - 00:13:15.318, Speaker A: You can link all of these things together inside of one human readable domain across multiple blockchains. That's super cool. So long as the wallet that supports unstoppable domains, you can have, like for example, I have David Hoffman eth. I can tell bitcoiners to send bitcoin to David Hoffman eth. It won't show up in my Ethereum wallet. It'll show up in my bitcoin address, and I link that with unstoppable domains. Lastly, there's Zapper.
00:13:15.318 - 00:14:22.590, Speaker A: Zapper is my new blockfolio, right? And so this isn't my wallet, but this is an example wallet. You can go to Zapper and it will tell you where all of your assets are, right? And so in this particular dummy wallet, they have a bunch of different assets in a bunch of different places, but you can also invest in different things in the DeFi world, right through Zapper, right? So it's like the front page of Defi, making it really easy. And lastly, if you have not yet go to the bankless YouTube and hit that subscribe button, because we are trying to keep the bankless nation as up to date as and through YouTube's videos like this, as well as tutorials by Defi dad. And then I read a bunch of articles aloud, and then we have our weekly state of the nation and podcast, right? So make sure you subscribe so you know exactly what the hell is going on in this crazy world. And without further ado, let's go right into this explanation from Andre, where he explains this thing and how it came to be way better than I ever could. So thanks for listening. All right, everyone, we're bringing Andre right into the bankless YouTube to get Andre to explain what this new stable credit system is.
00:14:22.590 - 00:14:44.920, Speaker A: So, Andre, first off, thanks for coming. Thanks for giving up your time. I know you're a very busy individual, but me and DC investor were going back and forth trying to understand what this new stable credit system is. And so bringing you on the bankless pod to help explain it to us step by step. And so, first off, thank you for coming on and welcome.
00:14:45.450 - 00:15:00.362, Speaker B: No, it's a pleasure, man. I appreciate you having me on at a time like this. I mean, sushiswap just returned all of their, let's call it stolen eth, and everyone's going crazy. And here we are talking about this system. So, yeah, cool, let's do it.
00:15:00.416 - 00:15:38.066, Speaker A: Yeah. Lots of going on, always in the defi space, never a dull moment. And I think this kind of slipped under the radar, your stable credit announcement a little bit, because it's many different things all stitched together. And so you start the article with a few primers. We know how maker works, right? You submit ether into a maker vault to produce Dai. And Dai is just this synthetic asset based off of a price feed. And then we also have lending protocols like compound, where you submit many assets and you can borrow other assets so long as you keep a reserve ratio.
00:15:38.066 - 00:16:08.980, Speaker A: And then there's also the automated market makers like Uniswap and balancer that we all know and love, and then utilization ratios like in ave and compound. But then we get into single sided Amm exposure and stable credit, which are new to me. Can you kind of walk us through the construction of stable credit out of yearn and a where did this idea come from? And then let's kind of get together with how all these money legos came to be to create stable credit.
00:16:10.230 - 00:17:00.226, Speaker B: So the original actually came from Yswap exchange that I was busy working on, which is basically a modified uniswap that allows for single sided exposure a big part of yearn. Anyone that has interacted with the vaults or the strategies would know that. I don't do impermanent loss strategies. Reason for that? It makes the decision making tree far too complex, because now you have to decide which asset do you take out? If you take both out, where do you sell the other one? Where do you get best ratios? And it's not always a positive sum, which I don't like. So I started working on single sided liquidity provisioning. So using Uniswap one as an example, Uniswap one, everything was paired to ETH. It didn't matter what you did.
00:17:00.226 - 00:17:40.590, Speaker B: If you created a uniswap pair, it was Dai to ETH, it was USDC to EF, it was link to ETH. It didn't matter. So the fascinating thing about that is it actually meant that ETH itself didn't matter because ETh was just this transfer token used underneath. It just needed to have enough liquidity in the system so the trades could happen without affecting slippage too much. So ETH was the perfect candidate because it's the most liquid asset on Ethereum. So it was great for uniswap one. That's why even in Uniswap, two, most pairs are wrapped EF because it's still one of the most liquid assets.
00:17:40.590 - 00:17:49.694, Speaker B: So that was the goal was just to create a system where you had the single side exposure and you didn't worry about the ETH pair.
00:17:49.822 - 00:17:59.830, Speaker A: And what's the benefit of that? So you can just deposit just ether into an amm and you can receive fees just based off of ether.
00:18:00.810 - 00:18:26.714, Speaker B: Correct. There's three important caveats to mention here. Number one is, yes, you only provide a single asset. The system provides the counter asset. So in this case, you would provide e. The system would say one e is equal to 400 transfer asset, and then it would mint 400 transfer asset. And put in your EF and the transfer asset.
00:18:26.714 - 00:19:03.500, Speaker B: So now if ETH's price declines, that's okay, because when you withdraw, you get back more ETH because you're a percentage of this pool. So now more ETH was put into the pool, you withdraw, I have more eth. I'm happy. So my net sum is about the same. If ETH became more expensive, it means I now have less ETH. So what happens then is you are actually given the transfer token, you're given the proportion you're withdrawing of the debt token or credit token, rather. Now that credit token you can use in another market, say USDC, take some of the USDC out and then buy.
00:19:03.500 - 00:19:49.530, Speaker B: So has it still has that in quotes. I want to say impermanent loss, but it's more like an offset loss because you can always buy it back with the counterasset. In the case where you got back more ETH, it simply burns the counter asset. In the case where the Ef you got back is worth less, you get the ETH back and the counterasset. It doesn't negate impermanent loss. Anytime you do any kind of trading activity, you're going to have impermanent loss, but it offsets it by basically giving you an iou of the system that you can use against something else or trade it for another or trade it for more. So that's the base layer that allows the single sided exposure.
00:19:49.530 - 00:20:31.078, Speaker B: And that was Yswap. And it's sort of standing on its own. But because it uses its own custom underlying amms, it needs its own integration, its own aggregators, its own liquidity providers, its own trader, its own interface. And there's just so much ecosystem work to do there that I have not had the time or capacity to do that. So that's why Yswap kind of is on the back burner currently. But then I think it was about two or three weeks ago Hasu on Twitter tweeted out about the possibility of having a fully decentralized lending system. And that's something I've been playing with for a while.
00:20:31.078 - 00:21:16.066, Speaker B: But one of your problems with, there's basically three things that mean that you can't really decentralize lending systems right now. Number one is what collateral do you accept as collateral? So one of the problems there is you can't just open it up to anything because otherwise I can just mint shitcoin, one, two, three, I go throw that, I give it an oracle price in uniswap, and then I throw a billion of it into Ave and I pull out all of the, I drain it. So they have to limit what collateral you put in. And that's done by governance and voting. In. Number two is the utilization ratios. In other words, what is the premium or the discount you're paying? And the way it currently works is it's normally dynamic.
00:21:16.066 - 00:21:49.630, Speaker B: So the more that gets borrowed, the more interest you pay back. And that's fairly traditional lending model that worked. But then I started thinking of tokenizing debt, or rather tokenizing credit. And this idea, it's no different than maker and it's no different than an Ave. Like in Ave. Right now, Ave denominates everything in eth. So you could technically mint a credit eth that you can then exchange for other collateral that other people borrow.
00:21:49.630 - 00:22:33.262, Speaker B: So by using this concept of tokenizing credit, you're creating a credit line that allows people to borrow collateral. Now, stable protocol really just puts all of these concepts together. So at its baseline, it does the single sided exposure. So I provide, let's say USDC as collateral, and then it uses that normal single sided rule. So it takes the USDC, it says, cool, you're depositing $1,000 worth of USDC. I'm going to mint $1,000 of transfer token, or whatever you want to call it, and it puts it inside of the amm. Now this is an important part.
00:22:33.262 - 00:23:32.762, Speaker B: It does not give that thousand that it mints to you as a user, because right now, the pair you're providing is actually your collateral. And we'll get to why that's important when we get to the trader side. So what it does then is it calculates what is the percentage contribution of this pool that you just added to the entire ecosystem worth. So that's a dynamic utilization calculation. And it's not based on a single market, it's based on the entire market as it is denominated in this transfer token. So that means if the system is 99% USDT and I provide more USDT, then the actual credit value that I get per dollar of USDT I provide is going to be 1%. So for every $10 I give, I'm going to get one dollars worth of credit that I can actually use because the system doesn't want more USDT.
00:23:32.826 - 00:23:45.090, Speaker A: Right. You're not losing money that way because you still are able to withdraw an equal amount of tether that you deposited. It's just that the credit that you receive when you do this is just extremely capital intensive.
00:23:45.670 - 00:24:28.130, Speaker B: Yes, but you also only have one dollars worth of debt. So now if I pay back that one dollars worth of debt, I get back the $1,000 of USDC I put in. So my collateral is always equivalent to the amount of debt I give. But this is specifically designed so that shitcoin one two three example you can't use to overpower the system because now I can't flood the system with this thing and drain everything else because my capital inefficiency is going to be so big that it makes it pointless. So the nice thing about that is you can actually add any pair. So you can still add shitcoin one, two, three, assuming it has some kind of oracle that is recognized in the system. But you can't flood the system, you can only do small amounts.
00:24:28.130 - 00:25:34.818, Speaker B: So that part handles how much of the credit token you are given. Now this credit token I can then use to go borrow something because now I have, let's say it was a more equivalent system and I got my max 75%. So I deposited 100 USDT and I got 75 stable USD out of the system. Now I can take this $75 of USD I have and I can go borrow in quotes. What I'm actually doing is I'm selling the 75 USD into, let's say the USDC pool and I'm withdrawing an equivalent amount of USDC. Now this is where I commented on Twitter, and that's the only difference there was is in the Reddit post, it assumed it's a one to one ratio, but now that would mean that you can do infinite loops, so it needs to be at a premium or a discount. And this is again where the constant product market maker of Uniswap is so beautiful, because the more you try and withdraw, the more expensive that USDC becomes.
00:25:34.818 - 00:26:25.960, Speaker B: So if there is only 75 USDC and I provide 75 of my debt token, I'm actually only going to get like 30 USDC out of the system. And that's basically the premium or the discount I'm paying. So if there's a lot of USDC in the system more than the transfer token, then I'll end up actually getting more. So there's a nice little discount premium system built into the utilization between these different amms and as they're interacting with each other. Now the third part of why it's important that these are amms and why specifically I chose Uniswap as well. You could do this with something like balancer, et cetera, but I prefer the tightness of the Uniswap curve, but the secondary net effect is that Uniswap is integrated with a lot of existing aggregators. You've got one inch, you've got Paraswap, you've got matcha, there's a lot.
00:26:25.960 - 00:27:18.962, Speaker B: And almost all of these systems use multipath trading. So what that means when the trader wants to do USDT to USDC, he doesn't actually know it's going USDT to transfer token, transfer token to USDC, and he trades. So as borrowers and lenders are providing collateral and borrowing and repaying, these pools are actually being held at price equilibrium by traders outside of the ecosystem. Which means if one pool gets drained a lot by a borrower who's paying a premium for that, a trader can come in, provide that extra collateral, and trade something else out of the system. And this is what keeps the collateral pools at a healthy utilization ratio without making it too expensive for borrowers. Because if you didn't have the trader side, then any pool that's over leveraged in terms of borrowing would become so prohibitively expensive that people don't borrow.
00:27:19.026 - 00:27:19.398, Speaker A: Right.
00:27:19.484 - 00:27:59.342, Speaker B: And while by design that's not really a problem, that's actually a little bit of a good thing, because it makes it expensive, it does mean that it's not as scalable. Because one of the things I needed is I needed a system that can scale beyond the current yearn system. Because the current yearn system is kind of capped in terms of where it can deploy capital, because there's just too much capital. And deploying more at this point doesn't increase API, it actually dilutes it for everyone else. So needed a new solution in there in any case. But that's the whole system. It's actually just minting that stable token, giving you a debt portion or a credit portion, and then having the amm at the bottom.
00:27:59.342 - 00:28:59.450, Speaker B: So if you actually go through the code, it's like 30 lines of code. It's probably the least amount of code of everything I've actually written, because it just uses this amalgamation of all of these concepts in such, I think, an elegant way. So now the net effects of this is you have a decentralized lender, where anyone can actually provide a collateral in a completely decentralized way and borrow against it. You have a stablecoin that is actually a stablecoin that is equivalent to the equilibrium of the entire system, and outside traders actually keep it at equilibrium. And I actually think it's a slightly more powerful stablecoin, because it's redeemable to $1 equivalent of its underlying value. And that redemption mechanism is incredibly important that I think a lot of protocols have been missing out, and that's why they struggle to keep peg. Because a reason why something like USDT keeps peg is if I can buy USDT at 1% over, I'm going to do it, because I can immediately redeem it for a dollar.
00:28:59.450 - 00:29:54.794, Speaker B: So that part is important for the stable token side. And then you have the single sided exposure, which from a yield and a yearn system is very important because it means I can actually scale. And another reason why this stable protocol is nice is because it is an aggregate of all of the markets provided. So if there's a link market and a USDT market and a USDC market, they all compound with each other instead of actually being isolated markets. So in something like the current vault strategies, we kept the ye vault because it was close to 70 million of die, and that was just too much given the exposure of the underlying protocols, because it's isolated versus if all of the vaults were in this, it's a billion dollars of capital. So all of a sudden 70 million over a billion. It's such a tiny amount of slippage that it doesn't matter.
00:29:54.794 - 00:30:07.694, Speaker B: And it's actually fully deployable in this ecosystem. So this also allows for a much larger scalable funding system, which I'm also very excited about. Okay. And I've blabbed way too much. I'm sure you have questions.
00:30:07.812 - 00:31:02.160, Speaker A: Yeah, no, it's great. I want to go to DC's, kind of his attempt to dissect what's going on, because he also did a very good job. I'm wary that a lot of people who aren't as able to keep up with the technicals are maybe a little bit lost. And so let me read this. DC says, I'm thinking of this as an asset collective, where you deposit an asset and then you get borrowing rights up to the required collateralization ratio for that particular asset. If the value of your initially deposited asset declines below the accepted collateral ratio, you lose your rights to your deposit due to liquidation, which in this case could be virtual. This creates a new single sided AMM lending service, allow you to deposit any supported asset, and mint a new yearn debt token, which is also a stablecoin, very much like DAI and MKR when the maker model.
00:31:02.160 - 00:31:42.894, Speaker A: And then this debt token becomes a currency, which you can use in the yearn Amm exchange to buy any other token any user has deposited there. So this is like a synthesis of a makerdao deposit assets receive a synthetic crypto dollar, but it's also like Uniswap because all of the deposited assets are allowed to trade between each other. And so people who are interested in seeking yield can deposit their assets just for the yield, but then they also are minted this new decentralized stablecoin. Correct. Is all of that right so far?
00:31:43.092 - 00:31:44.238, Speaker B: Yeah. Nailed it.
00:31:44.324 - 00:31:57.538, Speaker A: Okay, so then you deposit your ether into the new yearn Amm system. Now, it's not Uniswap, right, but it is a copy of Uniswap dedicated for urine. Is that correct?
00:31:57.704 - 00:32:19.340, Speaker B: No, it's clean. 100% Uniswap. I use Uniswap exactly as deployed on chain currently because they're already integrated everywhere. So by using them, I automatically get all of that volume, all of that traders, all of those integrators, all of those aggregators, which just evens out the entire system. Otherwise we have to build that all ourselves. And I'm too lazy for that.
00:32:19.950 - 00:32:59.618, Speaker A: You're too lazy? Yeah. Okay. All right. So then we have, you used the Uniswap contracts to put in single sided Amm liquidity, which then mints a brand new stablecoin into Ethereum. So one of the crazy things about this is this is a new stablecoin for Ethereum. And one of the big criticisms that people have been making of makerdao lately is that the centralized assets, like USDC, for example, they have companies putting receipts in there that's kind of been on the roadmap for Makerdao. People are concerned about the centralization of the assets in Makerdao.
00:32:59.618 - 00:33:36.114, Speaker A: And this provides a new alternative to Dai, like stable credit USD, which is now this new stablecoin. But it's a stablecoin generated out of this particular balance of assets, which is deposited into the urine system in the same way that you can deposit many assets into compound or aave, but it leverages the liquidity of those in a particular way that leverage it with Uniswap to mint this new stable USD. Which then you is the point of the system to produce a new stablecoin or is that a means to an.
00:33:36.152 - 00:33:38.930, Speaker B: End that's just a cool side effect.
00:33:39.000 - 00:33:39.954, Speaker A: Of cool side effect.
00:33:39.992 - 00:34:06.140, Speaker B: Actually. It's actually nice because it market makes itself as well. Because now let's say you just had the stablecoin part and you made the stablecoin. Now you still need to get trading pairs for it, and you still need to get people to actually list it and use it, blah, blah, blah. But this thing automates its own market. So the second, the first two pairs of collateral are added. The stablecoin has trading value and it has actual spend.
00:34:07.550 - 00:34:32.686, Speaker A: So it's also a little bit like the Federal Reserve model where the Federal Reserve just has this balance sheet, right, and then it's issued dollars based on that balance sheet. And that balance sheet can be managed and reorganized and rebalanced and redeployed, and there's flexibility around there as determined by governance. But in the crypto economic defi world, it's governance by, I'm assuming, the wifey.
00:34:32.718 - 00:34:42.962, Speaker B: Token rather than twelve no token management. So the equilibrium between the stablecoin and the assets are actually done by the arbitrage traders.
00:34:43.026 - 00:34:43.640, Speaker A: Right.
00:34:44.170 - 00:35:13.794, Speaker B: So as the USDC value in the system grows greater than the stablecoin value, they're incentivized to trade the stablecoin and take USDC out of the system. So it's actually arbitrage traders that keep the system in equilibrium. So this protocol is designed 100% decentralized. There's no governance, there's no token interaction, there's no users making decisions. I try to keep it as pure as uniswap. You deploy it and it just works.
00:35:13.992 - 00:35:21.758, Speaker A: So how do we determine which assets are approved to be a part of the system, or are they all approved?
00:35:21.934 - 00:35:47.180, Speaker B: So right now for the PoC, it's reliant on the chain link oracle. So it's anything that has a chain link price feed is accepted as collateral for a v two that I'm busy building. I want to use the uniswap's own built in over time oracles and do like daily measurements and then do it based off of that. And by doing that, it can actually accept any collateral that is available for trading in uniswap itself.
00:35:47.550 - 00:35:59.006, Speaker A: Okay, that makes sense. So there is actual no, any connection to the wifey token or urine finance except for the fact that urine may be a very strong customer of this new protocol, is that correct?
00:35:59.108 - 00:36:04.006, Speaker B: Yeah. Urine can use this to actually scale near infinitely with its vaults.
00:36:04.058 - 00:36:04.274, Speaker A: Right.
00:36:04.312 - 00:36:12.562, Speaker B: So right now we're basically capital capped. We can't actually deploy much more. And this will allow us to just ten x those numbers.
00:36:12.696 - 00:36:36.620, Speaker A: Right. And so I'm assuming this solution came out of the problem of like you had to close down the y eth vault because it was so popular, but there was just too much capital because there was so much demand and having that limited by Dai because Dai was too much of a proportion of the capital of urine, is that correct? And so you could create this thing?
00:36:38.670 - 00:37:14.920, Speaker B: I've been working on this concept for much longer than that. It just happened to time up as a very elegant solution, I'd like to say. I started thinking of this two weeks ago and now it's done. Sadly, I'm not that good. This is a bunch of concepts I've been working on for a very long time that just finally fit together. I did only make the breakthrough in terms of how these components work together when I ran into that problem, though. But like, each of these subcomponents is stuff I've been working on and building on since late last year.
00:37:15.290 - 00:37:34.814, Speaker A: Fantastic, fantastic. Okay, so let's talk about timeline. So at the end of this article, you said you are currently finalizing the UI and will make it available in the coming weeks. So it sounds like the code of this is done, like you've been working on it in the background. So now it's just a matter of getting something up and running so people can actually look at it and interact with it.
00:37:35.012 - 00:38:17.046, Speaker B: Yeah. So the core smart contracts are deployed, the helper smart contracts are deployed. We're not just tying up a UI that makes logical sense for a user so that they can see how much collateral do they have? How much can they borrow? If they were to borrow, how much would they actually get out, like in quotes? What's the slippage? It's actually the utilization ratios. But anyway, so just putting all of that together and then people can start playing with it. But I do want to stress there's no benefit to an early mover advantage here. So there's no need to rush in, there's no need to start using it, just chill. Because I know people have a tendency to FOMo into as soon as we release stuff, there's zero benefit, there's just risk.
00:38:17.046 - 00:38:20.138, Speaker B: So just chill when we open it up.
00:38:20.224 - 00:38:28.640, Speaker A: Right. And this isn't a yield farming thing, there isn't a token to be farmed. This is just a protocol that can offer new services.
00:38:29.330 - 00:39:19.758, Speaker B: Correct. I mean, one of the appealing things is obviously the more capital that's in there, then people can start leveraging themselves, because that is what you do with credit. That's the attraction part. That's why you provide collateral, because on the one hand you get trade fees, which is obviously awesome, but on the other hand you get credit that you can use to buy something else or exit or leverage or all of the usual stuff you do with Dai at this point. Right? So those are the value adds for the users of the system, aside of it being a decentralized lending protocol, which in itself is cool, but yeah, there's not going to be any fucking thousand percent API or special new token or any of that stuff. So just chill and let the protocol age a little bit before you start horribly abusing it.
00:39:19.764 - 00:39:27.950, Speaker A: Let it steep in defi first. All right, Andre, thank you so much. Any last messages you want to give out to the bankless nation?
00:39:29.490 - 00:39:37.734, Speaker B: I'll probably see you guys again in a few weeks. It seems like I'm going to start becoming a regular, I hope show. I'd love to hear it. That's awesome, man.
00:39:37.772 - 00:39:39.650, Speaker A: Thanks for the time. Bye, Andre. Thank you. Bye.
