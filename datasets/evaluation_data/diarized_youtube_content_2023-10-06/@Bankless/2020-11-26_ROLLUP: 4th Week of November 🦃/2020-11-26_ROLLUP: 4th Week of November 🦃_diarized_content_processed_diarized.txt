00:00:00.000 - 00:00:40.598, Speaker A: Hey guys, the next sponsor is ledger and Ledger is running a 40% off Black Friday week sale. So if you haven't gotten your ledger yet, you are in luck. For the week of the 23rd through the 30th, you can get 40% off of all ledgers on the Ledger website. So if you are still using a hot wallet or you're just looking to get a backup, maybe for a multi sig or just for some more redundancy, now is the time to go get that ledger. There's a link in the show notes that can get you that 40% off Black Friday deal. If you want to live a bankless life, you need to get a hardware wallet. There is no alternative for storing your crypto in a self sovereign fashion.
00:00:40.598 - 00:01:37.334, Speaker A: That's why I have four ledgers that I use to manage my different crypto assets using the Ledger live account as well. Ledger Live is like your home base for managing your Ethereum, defi and crypto accounts. It does a really good job of aggregating all of your different Ethereum wallets if you are the type of person that uses more than one. But you can also add other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or Cosmos or whatever your preferred blockchain is, and then it will display an aggregate portfolio of all your accounts at the main page. One thing that ledger is doing a really good job of is enabling all the money verbs that me and Ryan talk about with the bankless Guildcube enabled in the Ledger Live app. So right now in the ledger Live app, you can buy, sell, lend, swap, and stake your crypto assets, which is doing a really good job of fulfilling all of the money verbs in the bankless skillcube. Something that's new to Ledger Live is Ledger swap, where you can swap assets one for another, directly inside the ledger.
00:01:37.382 - 00:01:41.382, Speaker B: Live application, ensuring trustlessness in your financial.
00:01:41.446 - 00:02:04.722, Speaker A: Activity on Ethereum and on bitcoin. If you want to learn more about what you can do with a ledger, go to the blog post the power of Ledger Live on the Ledger website where they share some of the more advanced things that you can do with your ledger that you might not have known about. There's a link in the show notes that will take you to the ledger shop where you can get your preferred ledger hardware wallet. I personally like the ledger Nano X, but I also have both.
00:02:04.776 - 00:02:06.098, Speaker B: They're both great options.
00:02:06.264 - 00:02:10.246, Speaker A: When you own a ledger, you own your own assets in the way that.
00:02:10.268 - 00:02:12.514, Speaker B: They have been designed to be held.
00:02:12.642 - 00:02:19.560, Speaker A: By the user and the user alone. So go get your ledger today to make sure that you are as self sovereign as possible.
00:02:20.090 - 00:02:52.478, Speaker B: The bankless state and the nations are brought to you by Wyrn. Wyrn is DeFi's first self building community run project which I just get really excited about. Wiren is a system that seeks out yield in DeFi and it does that in a number of different ways. A very aggressive way is with the vaults where you can deposit your preferred asset of choice and different DeFi experts will come in and generate a strategy for what to do with your deposited token. Right? And so it'll go find ways to get yield in that deposited token in Defi.
00:02:52.574 - 00:02:54.174, Speaker A: For those who want to just earn.
00:02:54.222 - 00:03:21.226, Speaker B: Yield on their stablecoins, the earn system is for you where you can deposit your preferred stablecoin. And Wyrn will go and figure out which money market on DeFi in DeFi is producing the best interest rate, whether it's Dydx, it's compound, or aave. It looks around DeFi to see where the yield is coming from and it directs stablecoins automatically so you don't have to check them out at yearn finance to get started. And also check out the stats page to see what other people are doing as well.
00:03:21.328 - 00:03:31.790, Speaker C: Bankless nation Happy Thursday morning. We're coming at you a day early because it is Thanksgiving edition of our weekly roll up. Happy Thanksgiving. David, how you doing, man?
00:03:31.860 - 00:03:48.878, Speaker A: It's a turkey roll up this week. Glad you guys are here. Hope you guys are having a fantastic Thanksgiving. And we are ready to get this roll up underway. Going to go through five topics, get it injected right into your brain. First we're talking about the markets. What are the markets saying? 5 minutes for that.
00:03:48.878 - 00:04:05.386, Speaker A: Then we're going to go into releases. What got released this last week, 5 minutes for that. What's in the news? 5 minutes for that. And then we go into what's on your mind and what are you excited about? 5 minutes each. Ryan, are you ready to roll up this week?
00:04:05.488 - 00:04:23.150, Speaker C: I am super ready. Guys, grab a drumstick, grab your morning coffee. It's time to roll up. As a reminder, this usually comes at you on Fridays on YouTube. You can catch it live with the visuals you also get on the podcast. We're doing it Thursday special today and I am ready. Let's get started, David, with the market.
00:04:23.150 - 00:04:29.458, Speaker C: What is the market telling us this week, my friend? Let's open these bitcoin charts and see what's going on here.
00:04:29.544 - 00:04:53.926, Speaker A: Bitcoin is at $18,800. It's been poking around 19,000. The low 19,000 the high 18,000s really flirting with all time highs. So that's just an absolutely exciting thing to see. With bitcoin, ether is at $580. It got up to $620 earlier. So both of these assets are really into uncharted territories with regards to their previous levels.
00:04:54.038 - 00:05:15.738, Speaker C: Yeah, it's been a long time coming for ETH. Last week when we were talking, bitcoin had that big run up. And now this week, from then till now, it was ETh's turn. Let's talk about bitcoin on ethereum, because that continues to run up as well. Although it might be down a little bit from previous week. It's up in terms of total value, probably, but down a little bit in terms of bitcoin.
00:05:15.834 - 00:05:32.998, Speaker A: Yeah. Last week it was 151,900 and it's 151,800. I do think that it's interesting to see that that number go down. I always kind of thought that it would be easier for that number to go up, but going down by 100, it's kind of inconsequential. If you look at that chart, it's still just perpetually up and to the.
00:05:33.004 - 00:06:00.830, Speaker C: Right, pretty much flat from week to week. Okay, let's talk a little bit about some mainstream coverage of bitcoin. It's starting to get attention, and this will rapidly increase, especially as we exceed all time high, which we assume is just a matter of weeks at this point in time. This is the Wall Street Journal price of one bitcoin made the front page of the Wall Street Journal. They have a nice little price chart here. They're getting the mass media fomo engines running, right?
00:06:00.980 - 00:06:27.350, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. And if you think about the perspective of somebody who was paying attention to bitcoin back in 2017, they saw a $20,000 price tag. And for people that aren't in the bitcoin world, that compare that $20,000 price tag to that $10,000 price tag that was just present in bitcoin roughly four to five weeks ago. 10,000 looks really just, like, inconsequential. It's like bitcoin is never coming back to life. It's not ever coming back to 20,000. And then all of a sudden, just four or five weeks later, it's back at 20,000.
00:06:27.350 - 00:06:39.622, Speaker A: Right. And so this is where people realize that, wow, once again, bitcoin is not dead, and it's past all time highs. So this is when we start accumulating new people who are interested in bitcoin.
00:06:39.766 - 00:07:06.802, Speaker C: And for those of you who tune in and listen to people like Jim Kramer on CNBC. He tweeted this out, it is not too late for bitcoin. Great alternative to gold, which I've always believed in. Oh, yes. Jim Crater has always been a huge crypto believer. I think this is an example of one of those individuals in mass media who has just obviously ceased the trend a little bit before it happened. Definitely not in the bear market, but a little bit before it happened.
00:07:06.802 - 00:07:12.566, Speaker C: He's sort of planting that seed out there, but he's somebody that financial folks listen to from time to time.
00:07:12.668 - 00:07:23.334, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, he's very entertaining and he's the intersection of finance and entertainment. And so just another way for bitcoin to have exposure to eyes that don't usually see bitcoin.
00:07:23.462 - 00:07:59.000, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. And as you said earlier, the big story is ETH this week jumping from wow, the believe it hit something to that effect. And now as we're recording this around 580, does the staking contract have anything to do with that? David, we're about to talk to Vitalik in just a little bit. But the big news is we are going to launch ETH two because enough ETH was deposited in the ETH two staking contract to make that happen on December 1. Does that have anything to do with price?
00:07:59.370 - 00:08:28.510, Speaker A: If you ask me, what is the most bullish scenario to come out of the ETH two? It would have been exactly what happened. Right. We blew the limit out of the water. We got there at the earliest possible day, which is December 1. And then in addition to that 525,000 minimum that we needed, we got 200,000 more ether than what we needed. However, I don't think it was impactful on the price. I don't think the people trading ether and making the price discovery happen actually are paying attention that much to Ethereum 2.0.
00:08:28.510 - 00:08:49.094, Speaker A: So maybe there was like a little bit of price action, but not something that you could extrapolate from the price run from 470 to 620. I think that was going to happen regardless. And I think that ether is that valuable. That's a fair valuation for ether. I actually think that this was not reflective in the price.
00:08:49.292 - 00:09:17.854, Speaker C: Definitely a big moment for the ethereums who've been watching this the entire time, though. DFI. The DFI numbers total locked value is about flat this week, but we're approaching that 15 billion number of total value locked. It seems astounding to say 15 billion, but that's what we're looking at. Pretty crazy here. We also have the DFI pulse index, which is an index of DFI tokens. That's gone up a little bit this week from 104 to 108.
00:09:17.854 - 00:09:41.414, Speaker C: So it's kind of hanging there, really. The story has been ETh's big run over the past week. And let's pull up this tweet from Spencer noon, our friend who talks about eight signs that we've entered an ETH bull market. We should go through these super quick, David. But what are the eight signs that Spencer is pointing out that we've entered a new ETH bull market here? Yeah.
00:09:41.452 - 00:10:02.502, Speaker A: The first one is number of daily active addresses. This is a pretty safe metric to see the trend for unique people that are using Ethereum. The trend is up and to the right. We're flirting with all time highs of 500,000 daily active addresses. So that's a really big number. And so that's up and to the right. You want to take number two, Ryan.
00:10:02.646 - 00:10:15.006, Speaker C: Bank accounts. Absolutely. That's what those are. Every ETH address is a bank account. Ethereum is also dwarfing everything else in terms of average fees paid. This was not the case in 2017. It's distinct, it's different.
00:10:15.006 - 00:10:28.982, Speaker C: At that point in time, bitcoin was dominating, but Ethereum block space is now the mvp, the most valuable block space. And it's looking pretty good from a productive asset perspective. When you think of Ether as an Internet bond as well. Why don't you take number three?
00:10:29.116 - 00:10:54.480, Speaker A: Yeah, number three, the gas being used on a daily basis. So 8 billion gas is now being used. What that means is that the network is being used at its maximum capacity. Gas being used on a daily basis or a time unit basis is just a measure of how underload Ethereum is. The more gas being spent, the more transactions and more complex transactions that Ethereum is doing. Is that an all time high?
00:10:55.890 - 00:11:13.394, Speaker C: Number four, we've got 16 billion in stablecoins issued on Ethereum. I don't think we have to go into that in detail. It's been a theme on bankless. It's been parabolic since the beginning of the year. So that is huge. All those crypto dollars are on Ethereum. Why don't you take five? Yeah.
00:11:13.432 - 00:11:22.358, Speaker A: According to dune analytics, we are basically at 1 million total DFI users, which is up ten x from the start of this year. And we're just getting started.
00:11:22.524 - 00:11:40.826, Speaker C: David. I like to compare these to cities. Now we are a major american metropolis. We've gone from a few city size of 100,000 and now we're in the major metropolis area. Definitely huge growth there. Okay, number six, I'm trying to load it here. Okay.
00:11:40.826 - 00:11:56.110, Speaker C: There's now 14 billion total locked in. D five. We already talked about that. Number seven, all of the bitcoin on Ethereum. There's one hundred and fifty k. Now, we report on that on a weekly basis. Why don't you take this last one, number eight, on Dexes.
00:11:56.190 - 00:12:14.066, Speaker A: Dexes have done over $20 billion in volume over the last 30 days, meaning that at the entirety of this entire year, we've seen 86 billion in this last year, and 20 billion of that is over the last 30 days. So Dexes are in, and they're going to be really hot, especially in a bull market where people like to trade.
00:12:14.098 - 00:12:32.714, Speaker C: And speculate, guys, that is the market. Let's talk releases, what got released last week. Can you explain this one to me? David, I know you've got a fantastic video with Andre from Wire and YFI about it, but what is the TLDR on Daraswap, this new project that he's working on? Yeah.
00:12:32.752 - 00:13:08.600, Speaker A: If you want to learn more about this, check out the bankless YouTube. I did a quick interview with Andre to get down into the details about what this is. Andre is obsessed with making things capital efficient on Ethereum, and one thing that he is definitely not doing is staying within the confines of traditional finance tools and instruments. And he's trying to take, like, three or four different instruments and see if he can slap them all together into one single contract. And so Deraswap is swaps like uniswap, it's loans like compound and aave. It's options like deribit, which doesn't really actually have a defi correlate at the moment. That's something that's lacking in the defi world.
00:13:08.600 - 00:13:23.690, Speaker A: And then also futures, which is the same thing as options, but just with a time delay on it. And so Andrew has the thing that he calls Dariswap that is just all these things all at once. So when that gets slapped up onto a website with the front end, I'm really excited to tinker around with that.
00:13:23.760 - 00:13:33.338, Speaker C: Is this all going in the wire and ecosystem? Is this all part of YFI? Somebody asked me how to get exposure to Andre's brilliance around Dariswap. How do they get that exposure?
00:13:33.434 - 00:13:56.514, Speaker A: Yeah. So there's no token. So it's not, to my knowledge, maybe. I don't think there needs to be ever. And so it's not something that's investable as an application. It is something that Wifi could tap into and utilize, because after Andre was done working on wire, not that he's done, but he's building out hubs, spokes away from wifey that make urine more useful.
00:13:56.562 - 00:13:56.774, Speaker C: Right.
00:13:56.812 - 00:14:01.378, Speaker A: And so this is a place that makes wire more useful. Wire can find yield here.
00:14:01.564 - 00:14:05.530, Speaker C: Last question, because I think this is big ETA. When's that shipping, David?
00:14:06.030 - 00:14:11.110, Speaker A: Well, I'm assuming the contracts are up on main net. When is the actual project up and running? No clue.
00:14:11.270 - 00:14:20.334, Speaker C: Okay. All right, let's go to our friend Anthony Cisano, the Daily Gwe. So Anthony is a repeat guest and visitor. What's Anthony doing?
00:14:20.452 - 00:14:45.746, Speaker A: Yeah, so he's always on the Daily Gwe, which is a daily newsletter which talks about the subject of the day and kind of distills and analyzes it for you. Anthony is into the source code of Ethereum, both on a technical level and on a media level. And so when he analyzes something, it's almost always the correct take. It's always the correct take. I've never seen a bad take out of Anthony. He's doubling down on the daily Gwe ecosystem. He's going to do daily video recaps.
00:14:45.746 - 00:15:04.862, Speaker A: He's going to build tutorials. He's just really into the idea of capturing all the people that come into this space confused and then educating them. And so I think that's going to be a really valuable thing for the Ethereum community and the Ethereum ecosystem. We need more knowledge, people. We need more people spreading out knowledge. And Anthony's, I'm sure Anthony's going to do a great job with that.
00:15:04.996 - 00:15:15.534, Speaker C: Absolutely. Friend of bankless. If you like bankless, you're going to like Anthony's stuff. So connect with the Daily Kui. All right. This Defi database, I'll just mention it. Great resource that someone came up with.
00:15:15.534 - 00:15:41.162, Speaker C: But there are hundreds of projects in here. If you're looking for a project, just an index of some project you've heard of, we don't know the link. We will include a link to the Defi database in the show notes. You can click here, you can find the project. It is astounding, David, to see the vast number of Defi projects that have just seemingly popped out of nowhere. Like, I can't keep track of. Like, it's impossible for us to keep track of them at this point in time.
00:15:41.162 - 00:15:43.466, Speaker C: Pretty amazing stuff. You want to.
00:15:43.648 - 00:15:47.802, Speaker A: That effort is happening before the bull market. Yeah. That's a really useful website.
00:15:47.936 - 00:15:50.582, Speaker C: Absolutely. All right, you want to tell us about Slingshot?
00:15:50.646 - 00:16:07.038, Speaker A: Yeah, Slingshot is the rebrand from Dex AG. Coming out of the concourse. Open team. That's Scott Lewis over at Defi Pulse. Really just big friend of Ethereum, big friend of Defi and I'm really excited to see this slingshot. There's a Dex ag for those that haven't used it. It's like a Dex aggregator.
00:16:07.038 - 00:16:31.430, Speaker A: And like I said, they'rebranding to Slingshot. I'm assuming that there's going to be some spiffy new features coming out of this release. Check them out at Slingshot Finance. It's a pretty spiffy looking website and it's kind of a UX or brand identity that I think is really cutting edge and I think would be really attractive to all these new people who are trying to come into this Sci-Fi world of defi. So nice job Scott and Chad and everyone at Concourse open.
00:16:31.580 - 00:16:58.930, Speaker C: I love the branding and slingshot guys just raised a whole bunch of money, so I think they're putting it into this. It's going to be like one inch, if you're familiar with that. It will be like that. Maybe with some enhancements too. Pretty exciting stuff. Hey, last thing we got to touch on, just on the releases side is of course proof of stake is released. But the question on everyone's mind is why the heck did it take so long? Our friend Jeff Coleman put together a fantastic tweet thread on this.
00:16:58.930 - 00:17:01.918, Speaker C: But what's the TLDR on this tweet thread? David?
00:17:02.014 - 00:17:37.562, Speaker A: Yeah, the TLDR is that proof of stake is hard, and the reason why it's taken so long is because Ethereum didn't cut any corners. It did it right, it did it methodically, it didn't rush anything. The whole move fast and break thing ethos of Ethereum is totally just like Jeff Coleman kind of gives the historical account of just like the process of developing proof of stake Ethereum. And the reason why we're talking about this right now is just, it's a really good resource to get up to speed with what happened over the last three years in proof of stake. So if you just want to know a little bit about the history of Ethereum, Jeff Coleman summarizes this really well in this thread.
00:17:37.706 - 00:18:10.182, Speaker C: I'm involved in other ecosystems too, and other chains that have talked about proof of stake for a pretty long time. But the money line here is basically all of these other proof of stake chains are doing something that's more akin to delegated proof of stake, right? So this is not like delegated proof of stake is not anything new. You have a small group of permissioned validators. E two is doing something completely different. It's launching with already 16,000 validators. That's never been done before in these numbers. So doing proof of stake is easy.
00:18:10.182 - 00:18:20.026, Speaker C: Doing it in a decentralized way, which is what ethereum is trying to accomplish very hard. That's why it took so long. But we're here now, right at the very beginning, exciting stuff.
00:18:20.128 - 00:18:32.254, Speaker A: Because of the efforts that Jeff is talking about. We all get to stake at home, and that's why we get to say on the bankless program, it's your patriotic duty to stake. You don't have that duty in delegated proof of stake. That's not a thing.
00:18:32.372 - 00:18:47.902, Speaker C: No. You can just outsource that duty to someone else. All right, let's talk news. News is always exciting these days. Let's start with BlackRock CIO. So BlackRock, for people don't know, manages 8 trillion in assets. They just manage, like, all the world's assets.
00:18:47.902 - 00:19:10.460, Speaker C: There's a few other renaissance technologies. We talked to Nick Carter about this, but the CIO, something you would have never heard in 2017. That's why this bull run is different. Just said bitcoin will take the place of gold to a large extent. Bitcoin will take the place of gold to a large extent. Can you imagine that in 2015 or even 2017? This is crazy.
00:19:11.150 - 00:19:34.674, Speaker A: And this is just indicative of bitcoin is just becoming more mature, more financialized, much more of an accepted asset. Like, people that thought it was rat poison in 2017 are starting to come around to it in 2020. And again, the 2020 was a year that kind of blindsided everyone. And so I actually think as just an ability to be adopted, the threshold for adopting bitcoin is just lower. It's 2020. Like, all bets are off.
00:19:34.792 - 00:19:57.030, Speaker C: Yes, absolutely. All right, so something else that's happening we always talk about. This is a reoccurring theme of government in crypto. Coinbase, a crypto bank, as we call them, is suspending all margin trading operation tomorrow. This feels like it's to get on the good side of the CFTC. Right. Like, what's your take on this action? They just recently opened margin trading.
00:19:57.030 - 00:20:00.490, Speaker C: Now the bull runs here and they're closing it. Why else would they be doing this?
00:20:00.560 - 00:20:19.886, Speaker A: Yeah, Coinbase wants to offend the nation state. Not at all. It does. Everything crosses all the t's dots, all the I's. So when the regulators come and say something, Coinbase follows. And this is just the burden of crypto banks, of legacy institutions. And this is not something that you would see on DeFi.
00:20:19.886 - 00:20:30.402, Speaker A: This is the opposite of DeFi. So let it be known that margin trading on DeFi is up and running and margin trading on all crypto banks or USA crypto banks have been paused.
00:20:30.466 - 00:20:30.646, Speaker C: Right.
00:20:30.668 - 00:20:36.930, Speaker A: And so if you want to margin trade your bitcoin, you got to come to a DeFi or go to some offshore exchange.
00:20:37.090 - 00:21:02.526, Speaker C: Absolutely. It always is the case that if you present some surface area as a centralized crypto bank does, you're going to have to interact with regulators. And this is the case, by the way. I don't think it's all bad that Coinbase plus regulators are interacting. They do a lot of work on the lobby side of things to push the nation state in favor of crypto. So that is definitely a benefit. And I think Brian Armstrong and team are doing some good work here.
00:21:02.526 - 00:21:41.902, Speaker C: Here's another maybe outcome of some of that crypto industry pushing in. The US office of the Comptroller of currency just proposed a rule prohibiting large banks from something they've been doing for a very long time through regulators, which is basically disfavoring certain industries. So if you are, say, in the marijuana industry, you can't open a bank account, for instance, if you're in crypto. I've gotten kicked out of crypto. Like banks. I've gotten kicked out of banks. Bank of America sent me a dear John letter one time because I had a transfer from Coinbase to my b of a account.
00:21:41.902 - 00:21:58.098, Speaker C: They shut me down. They just said, we don't do anything with crypto. Sorry, see you later. And office of Comptroller saying, sorry, you can't do that anymore. Everyone has an opportunity. There should be no disfavored industries. What's your take here?
00:21:58.184 - 00:22:32.282, Speaker A: Yeah, this is really good. I think just for society. Like, if you are in a legal, but perhaps stigmatized industry, banks still have to serve you regardless of the stigma. And we ran into this at realty where PayPal kicked us off the platform. They didn't actually say why, but the reason is obvious because we're doing stuff in crypto and that's just BS. The marijuana industry, like you said, the crypto industry, hell, the porn industry, all these things are stigmatized, but should be offering banking services. So this is actually something that is like, nice job, nation state.
00:22:32.282 - 00:22:33.962, Speaker A: Like, you got it right. Good job.
00:22:34.096 - 00:22:43.454, Speaker C: This is Coinbase's influence too. I mean, they are getting people like this, I think this industry, they're getting people like this in these positions where they can do things like that. Okay.
00:22:43.652 - 00:22:52.914, Speaker A: The long term, the implications of this is that new companies, new startups can access banking services, which is really important. It's really bullish on innovation in the space.
00:22:53.032 - 00:23:13.770, Speaker C: Absolutely. The banks are also. This is our next news item here. The banks are also entering ETH staking, apparently so. Bitcoin suisse is depositing almost 100k eth, 100,000 Eth into ETH 20. They've already done that, I believe almost all of it at this point in time. What's your take there?
00:23:13.920 - 00:23:31.274, Speaker A: My take here is this is just indicative of the gargantuan industry that centralized staking as a service providers will be. That is going to be a massive industry. The demand to just charge fees on staking is just going to be so high. So competition is good for the consumer.
00:23:31.402 - 00:23:40.654, Speaker C: It's interesting because it's not something you can do with your bitcoin. You can't turn it into an Internet bond. So this is definitely going to be like a big industry.
00:23:40.782 - 00:23:43.790, Speaker A: Entire industry is based around solely ether.
00:23:43.870 - 00:24:07.066, Speaker C: The asset we're going to include a link to, I think what was staking rewards. Put this out as a super useful table so you can get a sense as a consumer of what the end destination options are going to be to stake your eth. Right. The top is these custodians and exchanges. That's the crypto bank option. But that's only like one of six different options here. You could also do a lending platform.
00:24:07.066 - 00:24:33.458, Speaker C: We talked to liquid stake about that. We are super bullish about staking pools, particularly ones like rocket pool, that aim to be decentralized. Also there's validator as a service solutions where you're just paying for infrastructure but you're not giving up your private keys. That's a fantastic option as well. There are pre configured validator nodes, hardware. We wrote a guide on the best hardware that you can buy, like Dapnode and Avato. You can just buy it in a box and stake from home.
00:24:33.458 - 00:24:58.490, Speaker C: And then of course you can run your own validator nodes in the cloud. So just because the crypto banks want a piece of this doesn't mean you as a consumer aren't going to have this slew of options available. Which is super exciting because I do think we're going to see a mix of both centralized and decentralized people running in big data centers and people running from home. Staking providers is something you don't see in these other proof of stake.
00:24:59.550 - 00:25:00.278, Speaker A: Yep.
00:25:00.374 - 00:25:04.046, Speaker C: David, you ready to talk about what's on your mind?
00:25:04.228 - 00:25:05.390, Speaker A: I've got stuff on my mind.
00:25:05.460 - 00:25:15.050, Speaker B: Looking for the front page of Defi? Look, no further than Xerion IO. Xerion is your home base for managing your defi portfolios.
00:25:15.130 - 00:25:16.866, Speaker A: Xerion offers a central place for you.
00:25:16.888 - 00:25:24.126, Speaker B: To engage with all of the DeFi protocols and assets that you engage with on a daily basis, but all in one central spot.
00:25:24.238 - 00:25:27.522, Speaker A: Here you can see I've loaded up a wallet and Xerion is giving me.
00:25:27.576 - 00:25:33.842, Speaker B: The portfolio performance of all the assets in this wallet over time, as well as a breakdown of all the assets.
00:25:33.906 - 00:25:35.846, Speaker A: That I own as well as all.
00:25:35.868 - 00:25:42.454, Speaker B: Of my transaction history that I've ever done. In an easy to view fashion, Xerion also lets you invest right into Defi's.
00:25:42.502 - 00:25:48.634, Speaker A: Best yielding financial opportunities right from their homepage. Xerion also makes it super easy to.
00:25:48.672 - 00:25:54.070, Speaker B: Access interest in Defi using applications like compound and aave in the background, and.
00:25:54.080 - 00:25:58.714, Speaker A: You can also exchange your assets using the Xerion app using an exchange aggregator.
00:25:58.762 - 00:26:12.802, Speaker B: In the background to make sure that you always get the best rates. You can even use the Xerion mobile wallet to add your metamask or argent or another ethereum address right into your mobile wallet so you can see your portfolio and engage in Defi on the go.
00:26:12.856 - 00:26:15.166, Speaker A: Here, I just loaded up my argent wallet and now I'm going to load.
00:26:15.198 - 00:26:27.270, Speaker B: Up my metamask as well. And Xerion will do the same thing. It will add all of my assets and wallets together, all in one space, and give me a portfolio summary of what's going on. Adding wallets is trivially easy.
00:26:27.340 - 00:26:28.598, Speaker A: If you already have a metamask, you.
00:26:28.604 - 00:26:31.786, Speaker B: Can get it right into the Xerion app, and it can sync with your.
00:26:31.808 - 00:26:34.266, Speaker A: Desktop app as well. And the best part is you can.
00:26:34.288 - 00:26:42.582, Speaker B: Also buy ether right into the app itself. Use the Invest tab to look at all the things that you have invested in, as well as other opportunities.
00:26:42.646 - 00:26:44.574, Speaker A: And coming soon to the Xerion app.

00:27:01.502 - 00:27:04.370, Speaker A: That you own and how much yield they're generating for you.
00:27:04.520 - 00:27:36.566, Speaker B: We're also brought to you by monolith. Monolith is your cool new DeFi account, your DeFi savings account, your Defi checking account. Except the cool thing about the monolith Defi account is that it gets software updates, right? You actually get to increase the usefulness of this over time. So here are some of the features. Monolith is a smart contract wallet with a lot of the features that you would expect. If you've come to know Defi and what it is, you can add money to it. You can put that money to work in compound and accessing yield, and you can also swap through Uniswap.
00:27:36.566 - 00:28:20.650, Speaker B: What was cool with monolith is that they will send you a very sexy monolith visa card that connects to your monolith smart contract wallet on Ethereum. So it's a really awesome tool to live a bankless life with a savings account that gets software updates. So this is something that you're never going to find out in the real world, but you can still do real world things with real money, like buy your groceries. So that's just fantastic. Coming soon to monolith. Actually already here to monolith is now you can buy Dai and get it sent to your wallet directly, right? So it's also being an on ramp, so you don't have to go through your centralized exchange like Coinbase or Gemini or wherever. You can just go straight from your bank account right into your monolith checking account.
00:28:20.650 - 00:28:25.050, Speaker B: Smart contract wallet. So check them out at Monolith XYZ.
00:28:25.210 - 00:28:26.702, Speaker A: I've got stuff on my mind.
00:28:26.836 - 00:28:28.350, Speaker C: All right, what's on your mind?
00:28:28.500 - 00:28:50.130, Speaker A: So the theme, I guess, of this week is that this bull market is different, right? This bull market is new. There are new dynamics, there are new things to consider. One of those new things is Ethereum media, also bankless. Mainly bankless. Bankless wasn't here last bull run. We're putting out like three or four videos a day, like two podcasts a week. We have a daily newsletter.
00:28:50.130 - 00:29:09.566, Speaker A: None of that was here in 2017. When I was getting into Ethereum, learning was hard. That was a hard thing to do. And not only with bankless, but with Anthony's daily Guay and ETh hub. Both of those things weren't around in 2017. DFI dad's yield tv not around in 2017. Ethereum Media wasn't around in 2017.
00:29:09.566 - 00:29:48.470, Speaker A: And that would have been really useful for learning. And so I'm kind of really optimistic and just excited to see what happens when we have a bull market, when Ethereum Media is a thing, right? And so listeners, viewers, when you see a question, when your friend has a question, just know, remember how hard that was for you to get into crypto and do your duty and send them to this source. That is helpful. People will get lost in the wrong rabbit hole, in the wrong youtuber, and then that's how they end up investing in XRP. Do us a favor. Do your friends a favor, like send them to bankless. We want them.
00:29:48.470 - 00:29:50.358, Speaker A: We will get them on the right path.
00:29:50.454 - 00:30:03.974, Speaker C: We will nurture them on their journey. And like David said, we're not stopping. We're just getting started here. So more content, more participation from the community. I'm super excited about that, too, David. You're right. It was completely bleak.
00:30:03.974 - 00:30:10.206, Speaker C: There was nothing. Just a bunch of technical documents back in 2017 to wrap your mind around. We're trying to make this stuff easy.
00:30:10.308 - 00:30:11.790, Speaker A: Remember white papers.
00:30:12.610 - 00:30:13.946, Speaker C: Too many white papers.
00:30:14.058 - 00:30:14.634, Speaker A: White papers.
00:30:14.682 - 00:30:16.974, Speaker C: It's terrible. A terrible time in history.
00:30:17.092 - 00:30:18.318, Speaker A: Ryan, what's on your mind?
00:30:18.404 - 00:31:10.510, Speaker C: You know what, one thing that's on my mind is this bull market is just getting started, and I don't think retail is even here yet. Right. So most of the price increase that we've seen has just been, I think this is my sense of things, bulls doubling down and institutions getting in. Coin metrics has a convincing article about this where they're sort of dissecting who holds the bitcoin and how folks are entering the space. And they seem to indicate to you that retail hasn't even entered the party yet. So what happens when retail enters? Here's another graph from Larry from the block, who is looking at this indicator of retail mania. This is an indicator of weekly follows of Twitter accounts.
00:31:10.510 - 00:31:39.322, Speaker C: And you can see over here, in 2017, weekly follows of Twitter accounts for binance and Coinbase were just off the charts. People are like, how do I get crypto? Oh, like, I'm going to follow finance. I just opened an account completely off the charts right now. What's happening? We're seeing price increase almost to all time high bitcoin. Massive price increase for ETH this week, but there's no Twitter activity following. It's pretty flat for binance and Coinbase. I don't think retail has entered the game at all.
00:31:39.322 - 00:31:48.078, Speaker C: I think this has mainly been institutional demand and current bull Demand. So that all begs the question, David, what do you think is going to happen when retail enters the game?
00:31:48.164 - 00:31:58.010, Speaker A: When retail is finally here? We are seeing signs of retail coming like the first. People are starting to download TikTok because tokens are being shilled in TikTok right now. And I'm getting.
00:31:58.100 - 00:32:01.278, Speaker C: I don't even know, is there a TikTok Twitter?
00:32:01.374 - 00:32:12.694, Speaker A: There's going to be. There's TikTok, like investments. Right? And imagine what happens when you mix together zoomers, TikTok and illiquid shitcoins that pump 100 x.
00:32:12.892 - 00:32:14.600, Speaker C: It sounds terrible to be.
00:32:15.370 - 00:32:16.550, Speaker A: That's what's ahead of us.
00:32:16.620 - 00:32:20.710, Speaker C: Okay. Should we be on TikTok? I don't want to do it.
00:32:20.780 - 00:32:22.466, Speaker A: We are not going on TikTok, guys.
00:32:22.508 - 00:32:28.566, Speaker C: Bankless nation. You tell us if we should be on TikTok, and David and I. No, we'll get somebody to go on TikTok.
00:32:28.598 - 00:32:31.660, Speaker A: If you want to run the bankless TikTok, let us know.
00:32:32.030 - 00:32:45.262, Speaker C: Yes, please. All right. You know, I've got another take, too. Not only one, but two takes. Okay. So this is about on ramps. And it's kind of Nick Carter, in our conversation with him earlier this week, sort of inspired this.
00:32:45.262 - 00:33:19.286, Speaker C: But the first, I want to talk about two on ramps. The first is institutional on ramps, okay. Like, think of on ramps, the ability to move from liquidity, from traditional fiat assets or stocks, those sorts of things that exist in legacy finance, to crypto. That's like a pipe, right? And the pipe was like this. It was like this very narrow 2017 very narrow pipe. It was like a 14K modem or something like that, right? We didn't have broadband, but now the pipe has, like ten x increased. Right? So now we got a big pipe, a big floodgate.
00:33:19.286 - 00:33:37.054, Speaker C: Thick pipe. We got a floodgate, right? And this is true in institutions. How do we know this? Like we talked to Nick about now, we have futures CME volumes at all time high. These are regulated futures. We have options. We have crypto banks providing custody. Right? So the pipe to institutions is this much bigger.
00:33:37.054 - 00:34:12.542, Speaker C: It's like, no wonder institutions like the CIO of Blackrock are becoming bullish, because last cycle, they didn't want to be bullish on crypto because they couldn't buy any of it. These asset managers are smart. They're not going to start shilling an asset until they actually have a position in that asset. Well, now they can get a position. That's why you're hearing Paul Turdo Jones talk about it, not talk smack about it, because he's owned some, right? They're all bag holders, just like us, let's be honest. Okay, so that's the first pipe that's gotten bigger. You know, the second pipe that's gotten bigger, David, is the pipe to retail, which hasn't even opened up yet.
00:34:12.542 - 00:34:31.074, Speaker C: So here's what I see happening, is Fintech is going to totally betray the banks, and they're going to start building on crypto rails, right? If you take a look at, these are the top five apps right now in the finance category. I think this is like itunes or something.
00:34:31.112 - 00:34:38.646, Speaker A: Right, I'm going to read. That's cash app number one, PayPal. App number two, Venmo. App number three, Robin Hood. Number four, Coinbase number five.
00:34:38.828 - 00:34:41.110, Speaker C: Guess what they have in common. David Hoffman.
00:34:41.770 - 00:34:46.450, Speaker A: If not now, then later. They are all onboarding ramps for crypto.
00:34:46.610 - 00:35:08.154, Speaker C: All of them? Every single one. So the only one that's not right now is Venmo. And that's coming in Q one, 2021. All right, so what happened here? These are all fintech apps. Fintech has spent the last ten years completely optimizing user interface. Because you go into your wells Fargo account online, it sucks. It's a terrible user interface, but you go into something like Venmo.
00:35:08.154 - 00:35:16.882, Speaker C: Hey, they have an app. It's super easy for friends. Robinhood. It's an easy place to trade. It's very millennial friendly. The UX is fantastic. Fintech does that really well.
00:35:16.882 - 00:35:58.670, Speaker C: Guess what they've built on crypto banks so far on that, or, excuse me, they've built on traditional banks so far on that infrastructure. But what's happening? They're slowly bifurcating. They're starting to enable pathways and bridges to crypto. Well, what happens when they completely abandon the traditional bank legacy infrastructure and they go completely into crypto? I don't think the banks are ready for that. But that's going to be the team up of Fintech plus, crypto is going to eat the world. Fintech UX on top, backed by crypto, backend, database, money infrastructure, defi protocols, protocol sync.
00:36:00.530 - 00:36:20.098, Speaker A: You know, this image just bleeds protocol sync thesis, because after number five, Coinbase, there's number six, zelle, number seven, chase, and number eight, capital one. Like huge losers to all the companies that integrated crypto. No one wants your stupid banking app. Give me the app that lets me buy crypto.
00:36:20.274 - 00:36:41.030, Speaker C: Totally. It's inevitable they're just falling into the trap. So it's playing out just as we might predict. That's going to take time. But again, back to that bandwidth, the pipeline. So we saw the institutional pipeline, ten x. Well, the retail pipeline has ten x, and we're not even seeing it active yet, but I think we will sometime in this bull cycle.
00:36:41.190 - 00:37:04.338, Speaker A: That's exactly right. And Nick Carter on our video with him on the bankless YouTube, which everyone should go watch, he talked about all these different pipes that are built, and the important thing is the title of his piece was called nine bitcoin metrics that are at all times highs. Not only are the pipes built, but they're just being used at maximum capacity at the same time. So there's not just that the option is available. The option is available and being used.
00:37:04.424 - 00:37:16.550, Speaker C: Well, I think they're being used like they're being used at more capacity than they've ever been used, but their capacity for even more is like increased. Right. I think CME could do another five x, another ten x at some point.
00:37:16.700 - 00:37:18.438, Speaker A: I'm sure of it. I'm sure of it.
00:37:18.524 - 00:37:22.698, Speaker C: What are you most excited about? Let's spend the last few minutes here, my friend.
00:37:22.784 - 00:37:49.742, Speaker A: Keep it on theme. I am most excited about how unique that this bull market is going to be for Ethereum specifically. We've already talked about how Ethereum Media hasn't seen a bull market. That's cool. That's going to be new. But you know what else hasn't seen a bull market? DFI hasn't seen a bull market like maker Dow is. Contracts got deployed in Ethereum in December of 2017, which was the peak bull market, and only like 100 people started using maker Dow.
00:37:49.742 - 00:38:16.778, Speaker A: Uniswap didn't come around until 2018 or 19. Compound didn't come around until 2018. Ave wasn't a thing until 2019. The protocols that have all of the money in them that are responsible for that 14 billion locked in DFI, none of them have seen a bull market. The number of $14 billion in DFI, that number hasn't seen a bull market. We haven't seen a bull market with applications on Ethereum that collect capital. Right.
00:38:16.778 - 00:38:48.166, Speaker A: Last bull market, capital came in, bought some icos, tried to make some money, then they left. In this bull market, we have sinks, we have basins for value to go to Ethereum and then collect at the bottom of these basins. And those basins are like Uniswap, like Makerdao, things that attract capital and then there's reasons to stay, there's reasons to settle on Ethereum, right? And so they're just going to get lured into the ecosystem and then they're going to stay there and then they're going to become. That's just, that's what I see ahead of us. And that's what gets me real riled up.
00:38:48.268 - 00:38:54.946, Speaker C: It's all been entrapped, this whole ty what Tyler Winklevoss tweeted right before we're recording.
00:38:55.138 - 00:38:57.510, Speaker A: Yeah, he. Yeah, we're gonna go for it.
00:38:57.580 - 00:39:22.362, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm going to read this quote. This Ethereum eth bull run is know I got to notice, like Tyler Winklevoss, one of the Winklevoss twins, of course, he got a bit more bullish after. Am I imagining things or did he get more bullish after our show with him in June of this year, we talked about DefI and Eth. I don't know if this is a little bit like, I don't want to take credit for this tweet. We shouldn't take credit for his tweet, but let's also take credit for this tweet.
00:39:22.426 - 00:39:32.318, Speaker A: We're taking credit for it because that's exactly what we were hammering on in this week's state of the nation. So I'm pretty sure Tyler Winklevoss watched the Ethereum side of the bullish part of the state of the nation.
00:39:32.414 - 00:39:36.898, Speaker C: Well, we know he is the listener. Tyler, if you are listening right now, nice tweet, my friend.
00:39:37.064 - 00:39:38.222, Speaker A: Keep him coming, Tyler.
00:39:38.366 - 00:39:40.760, Speaker C: Keep him coming. Very exciting times.
00:39:41.290 - 00:39:43.058, Speaker A: All right, Ryan, what are you excited?
00:39:43.234 - 00:40:15.326, Speaker C: Know, I'm excited about. I think this goes back to what you were saying is really the community coming together. People forget crypto for all the self sovereignty that we talk about. All of that's true, but crypto is not a single player game. We need a whole community to come around this. Almost everything that we do in crypto is social, from agreeing to consensus on what money that we use to auditing DFI contract protocols. You know, what we saw in the last week is the crypto community coming together to really launch eth.
00:40:15.326 - 00:41:00.154, Speaker C: Two, right. Part of the social layer, the investors kind of the meme layer, the media layer that you were talking about, but also the engineers and the developers and the brilliant people who actually built this stuff and spent the last five years thinking through a decentralized way to do proof of stake. So this is like the community coming together. And you know what? Because it's thanksgiving, david, I'm, like, thankful for that. That's the one thing about crypto that I am most thankful for. I'm thankful also for people in the community who helped me along the journey. So today, six years ago today is when I first, like, I'd heard about bitcoin, I'd heard about crypto, but this is when I first jumped down the rabbit hole.
00:41:00.154 - 00:41:22.950, Speaker C: I had some extra time, like holidays, right? Like, you're hanging with your family, but know, pursuing your hobies. And I read stuff from andreas. I watched his talks. I watched some documentaries. Later on, I started getting to Chris Berninski. I mean, these are folks who left a breadcrumb trail for me. And I just want to, like, thanks for doing guys.
00:41:22.950 - 00:41:44.622, Speaker C: Like, thanks, andreas. Thanks. Chris Berninski, a close personal friend of mine, jeff, he was running miners in his basement. He told me about this weird crypto thing, and those people set me off on this journey, and I'm thankful for that. I'm thankful for this community, and I'm thankful for that. Who are you thankful for? Do you have anybody that you're really inspired you to start?
00:41:44.756 - 00:42:38.830, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess I'd have to give a tip of my hat to Carl Florish, who he was. Somebody I discovered after discovering crypto. I kind of discovered crypto on my own, but one of the first people I discovered that was truly helpful for me was Carl Florch and his cryptoeconomics study website. When I was battling between do I go off to physical therapy school, or do I figure out how to get a job in Ethereum, it was just the ethos and energy and vibes that Carl Flores exuded that I thought he was just representative of Ethereum at large. And so I actually haven't spoken to him about this, but he's, like, one of my big inspirations for Ethereum as a culture I resonate with, and ethereum as a technology I also resonate with, and I see that represented by Carl. So, carl, thanks.
00:42:38.980 - 00:42:57.474, Speaker C: We got to get Carl on the show. Talk about optimism. That's what he's working on right now, and he is an optimistic fellow, that is for sure. Lots of energy. All right, David, we've taken a little bit of time over, but I think that is it. Oh, last thing I'm excited about is Black Friday deals. Maybe we'll see a few in crypto, but we've got the ledger deal going on right now.
00:42:57.474 - 00:43:04.854, Speaker C: 40% off a ledger. And I like that shirt you're wearing, David. What's that? That feels like it's going to black Friday deal, too.
00:43:04.892 - 00:43:38.910, Speaker A: Tell us the bap zero shirt. The sale period, whatever we're calling the sale period, wraps up the day after thanksgiving. So for those who don't know what we're talking about, there's a balancer pool that is a weighted between dai and this token called bap bap zero, bankless apparel season zero. You purchase the token, you burn the token, you get a sick t shirt, the one I'm wearing right now. And the cool thing about this balancer pool was that over a one month long period, the weights changed, and so it started. Heavyweight baptoken lightweight die, and then it flipped. And that's kind of like a reverse dutch auction.
00:43:38.910 - 00:43:59.954, Speaker A: So price goes down over time. It goes up when people sell up when people buy down when people sell, like, uniswap. And a day after tomorrow day after thanksgiving is the last day prices change, and so it turns into a fixed 90 ten, uniswap type pool. And so if you are interested in buying baths, know that the prices stopped changing the day after thanksgiving.
00:44:00.002 - 00:44:01.330, Speaker C: And they've never been cheaper.
00:44:01.410 - 00:44:04.314, Speaker A: I don't know, $393 right now. They've been a lot.
00:44:04.352 - 00:44:22.030, Speaker C: Okay, so they went up. I saw them drop below 200, but you got to keep monitoring that, guys. All right, that's it, everyone. Happy thanksgiving. Enjoy the time with your family. If you guys are doing that. And, of course, if they ask about crypto, you know what to say.
00:44:22.030 - 00:44:23.230, Speaker C: You know where to send them.
00:44:23.300 - 00:44:38.338, Speaker A: Wait, listener, you are bringing up crypto. You are bringing it up. That is your duty. That is the action item that we are leaving you with. Bring up ethereum. Bring up the crypto culture. People need to be informed.
00:44:38.434 - 00:44:53.506, Speaker C: Yeah, revolution. At least wear your t shirt or something. Bankless tea. Get them to ask. Make it subtle, whatever your style is. Guys, thanks so much for joining us for the weekly roll up. This has been a blast.
00:44:53.506 - 00:45:05.534, Speaker C: Risks and disclaimers. None of this is financial advice. Eth, defi, bitcoin, they're all super risky. But we are glad you're with us. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone. But thanks for joining us.
00:45:05.534 - 00:45:06.010, Speaker C: Bye.
