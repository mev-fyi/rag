00:00:00.090 - 00:00:01.674, Speaker A: What happened? What did Uniswap release?
00:00:01.722 - 00:00:36.210, Speaker B: Nfts are a big part of digital ownership, so that's why we're so incredibly excited to announce that Uniswap Labs has acquired Genie. Genie, for people who don't know, is the first NFT marketplace aggregator. So I think most people know about OpenSea and other NFT marketplaces that let you buy and sell nfts. Genie basically lets you buy and sell and discover nfts across all the different marketplaces. And so we acquired their team. We're going to be working on buying our two products and building in a full NFT experience directly into the Uniswap web app and work towards a much more unified experience across the two and essentially become a marketplace for all digital value, as opposed to just ERC 20 token.
