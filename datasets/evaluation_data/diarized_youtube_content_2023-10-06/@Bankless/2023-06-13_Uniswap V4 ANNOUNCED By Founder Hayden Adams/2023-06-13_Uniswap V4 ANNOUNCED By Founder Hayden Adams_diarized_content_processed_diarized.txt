00:00:00.090 - 00:00:07.198, Speaker A: One cool thing about the single to design is it actually reduces current estimates. Have it. Have it. Reducing the gas cost of pool deployment by about 99%.
00:00:07.284 - 00:00:08.094, Speaker B: Wait, what?
00:00:08.212 - 00:00:16.480, Speaker A: Sometimes people pay when gas costs are high, like north of $1,000 to deploy a pool just a gas cost. And that same deployment would be something like $10.
00:00:18.770 - 00:00:45.670, Speaker B: Bankless Nation there's a big announcement for everyone in DFI today. Uniswap version four. It's coming out. We have Hayden Adams on the podcast to tell us more. We talk about a few things. What is Uniswap version four? V four? What does it do? When's it coming? How big of a deal is this from an order of magnitude? Size? Is this as big as V three? We also talk about hooks. This idea of a modular uniswap.
00:00:45.670 - 00:01:10.754, Speaker B: What are hooks? What do they do? What is the future for liquidity on ethereum? And finally, we talk about DFI. Has DFI slowed down? Has it diminished? Does Hayden still think we're on track to eat traditional finance? All of these topics unpacked in the episode today. Guys, before we begin, though, want to tell you about a prize linked Ethnominated savings account from our friends and sponsors at Asymmetrics. David, what is this?
00:01:10.872 - 00:01:58.702, Speaker C: Asymmetrics? It is a way to make your ETH staking super exciting or super boring or super exciting. If you want that 4.55% ETH stake to range anywhere between 0% or 1000%, asymmetrics may be for you. Okay, what the hell am I talking about? So Asymmetrics, it's a little bit like pooled together. Same kind of concept where everyone stakes their ether, but only the yield goes to one person who gets a lot of yield while everyone else gets zero yield. This is why Ryan called this a prize linked savings account. So if someone just feels like a little bit extra lucky and they want to add some excitement to their ETH staking, they can go to Bankless CC Asymmetrics to get anywhere between zero or 1000% stake on their yield.
00:01:58.702 - 00:02:40.814, Speaker C: Ryan, diving into this episode when I was learning about uniswap V four, I really just got visions of a microcosm of ethereum. So I'm calling this the hook centric roadmap for Uniswap. Whereas ethereum has its roll up centric roadmap, uniswap now has hooks, and it allows for Uniswap base to be extremely primitive. But hooks to reintroduce complexity into the uniswap AMM on an opt in basis. And I think this really gives a lot of power to builders who want to make their uniswap pools very expressive. Overall, it starts off as a very small update. V Four is a small update to V three.
00:02:40.814 - 00:03:22.986, Speaker C: But the cool thing is that the size of how awesome and powerful uniswap V Four is actually grows alongside the open source developer community around Uniswap. So I'm very bullish on this new update. Hayden is going to unpack it for us in this episode. Small disclaimer uniswap Labs is a sponsor of Bankless they currently sponsor the Bankless podcast, but Uniswap V Four is an episode that we would never miss. And so we're having Hayden Adams, the inventor of the Uniswap Protocol, on to discuss all about Uniswap V Four. So let's go and get right into the conversation with Hayden Adams.

00:05:56.782 - 00:06:14.830, Speaker C: Bankless Nation I would love to introduce you to Hayden Adams, the inventor of the Uniswap Protocol and CEO of Uniswap Labs, a software company building on and around Uniswap. And today, Hayden is here to talk about the vision behind Uniswap V Four and what it could mean for liquidity on Ethereum. Hayden. Welcome back to Bankless.
00:06:14.910 - 00:06:18.594, Speaker A: Thank you for having me. So excited to be here and to talk about Uniswap V Four. Yeah.
00:06:18.632 - 00:06:20.710, Speaker C: Hayden, are we getting a new Uniswap?
00:06:21.370 - 00:07:14.710, Speaker A: Short answer is we are. Long answer is that the process of getting a new Uniswap is going to look a little bit different this time around. I think that a really important starting point is that we see Uniswap as very similar to Ethereum itself, where it's a core piece of infrastructure, public infrastructure on which thousands of teams are building. There's hundreds of thousands of liquidity providers, and it's really just this public infra for the entire space, right? At times it has over 90% market share for on chain trading on Ethereum at least. And so similar to how Ethereum has this public process for it being rolled out. And there's a lot of time for people to respond and react and give feedback and input. There's time for all the different projects building on top of it to begin preparing their infrastructure and build on top of it.
00:07:14.710 - 00:07:36.880, Speaker A: With this version of Uniswap, we really wanted to build it in public. And so what we're rolling out today is basically a vision for Uniswap V Four, as well as a white paper and a draft of the code. So the code is we have an initial code base and it works. And it proves that it can work, but it's not final, and we don't expect it to be final for many months.
00:07:37.250 - 00:07:40.942, Speaker C: Okay, so the big new announcement is uniswap v. Four. Jazz hands.
00:07:40.996 - 00:07:41.226, Speaker A: Yay.
00:07:41.258 - 00:08:08.006, Speaker C: We're getting new uniswap. And also the way that Uniswap V Two and V Three were built was it was built and then I think within a month, both of them were live on main net. And this is not what is going to be happening with V Four. There is no release date if I'm correct. And it's just a very long open period for public collaboration, community engagement, public conversation to tinker with Uniswap V Four. Is that correct?
00:08:08.188 - 00:08:40.094, Speaker A: Yeah. I think that Uniswap V Three was kind of like a Beyonce Lemonade album, Drop, where when we released it, it was this cool thing and it was entirely ready. And it was a surprise. And I think this time around and honestly, one of the pieces of feedback we got at the time was, hey, this is really cool. This is going to take me like a month to understand, let alone build an entire integration on top of. And so that was one aspect of it. The other aspect of it is that at the time that we announced it, the code base was basically frozen and already well underway of auditing.
00:08:40.094 - 00:09:12.654, Speaker A: And so there wasn't time to incorporate any pieces of public feedback. And there were very, very minor things that people I mean, it was like a very good code base. We did a really good job, but it was like there was like, minor pieces, very minor improvements people found at the time, and they weren't really able to be integrated. And so with Uniswap V Four, there's going to be many, many months. There'll be time for people to open issues, to submit PRS. There's contribution guidelines, and there's a lot of time for people to start planning integrations and start building on top of it.
00:09:12.772 - 00:09:21.086, Speaker B: So what are we getting right now, Hayden, at the time this episode is released? What can people go get busy with and start digging into?
00:09:21.268 - 00:09:53.306, Speaker A: Yeah, so first we have the blog post, which just outlines a high level overview of what it is, or at least what our vision for it is. Similar to Ethereum, you sort of have a sense of where things are going, right? We had this sort of vision of proof of stake, and then everyone started marching towards it. So we have this vision for what Uniswappy Four is. We have a white paper that gives a lot more background and technical information and supporting math, et cetera. And then we have a code base. And the code base really just contains a full draft implementation. So it kind of proves it works.
00:09:53.306 - 00:10:12.880, Speaker A: It's definitely not audited. It's not production ready. And we aren't going to march straight towards audit or production ready. We're actually going to give space and time for people to contribute and to give feedback into it. And so, yeah, right now we have an initial implementation. We have a vision. Excited to talk about what that vision is.
00:10:15.010 - 00:10:53.902, Speaker B: Before we get into the vision of V Four, I want to just maybe zoom out for a minute, because it's not often, Hayden, that we're able to get you on bankless and have this kind of conversation, but let's zoom out all the way back to 2018. And I'm wondering if you could kind of share how far Uniswap has come from that point in time. I was reading the blog post a little bit earlier, something like 1.5 million or sorry, trillion with a T. My God, million. How quaint of me. Trillion in value flows through this platform.
00:10:53.902 - 00:11:04.762, Speaker B: Give us some stats. Give us some of the numbers that you look at to understand uniswap's progress and its impact. Yeah. Flex on us for a minute.
00:11:04.906 - 00:11:50.910, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, it's been an absolutely insane journey. We have the previous Bankless episode we did where we really went through a lot of the early days, but since then it's just been absolutely insane. I guess a few of the things that we look at that are pretty interesting, definitely like total all time volume traded is north of 1.5 trillion at this point, which is pretty crazy. There's billions of dollars in daily trading, hundreds of thousands of liquidity pools created, hundreds of thousands of liquidity providers, millions of traders. I think even just like the amount of the market share on Ethereum, it's like north of 90% at times of on chain trading on Ethereum happens through the Uniswap protocol.
00:11:50.910 - 00:12:14.706, Speaker A: It trades off at different times, but it's been trading off with coinbase in total trading volume. All sorts of things that we look at to just show the amount of activity happening on top. Definitely, I wish I had a number for the amount of projects building on top of it. My intuition says tens of thousands, not just thousands, just because of the number of tokens and projects that exist.
00:12:14.818 - 00:12:26.010, Speaker B: So, given all this, Hayden, one question in my mind is can Uniswap get even mean? Haven't we seen all the growth? Aren't the growth years already behind us? How can this thing possibly get any bigger?
00:12:26.750 - 00:13:18.714, Speaker A: I definitely think that Uniswap can get much bigger. There's a few ways for it to get bigger. Definitely in terms of market share on Ethereum, it's hard to get much bigger. There's very marginal gains to be had there, right in the order of like ten to 15%. And so I'd say that where Uniswap grows bigger is about basically growing the entire space, about having enabling more things to be built on top of it, basically growing the space around it and really taking innovation that currently happens external to Uniswap and having that innovation happen within Uniswap. I think that one pretty important nuance here is that Uniswap has this dominance in market share. But there is a lot of innovation today that does happen in the AMM space and a lot of experiments and maybe a little bit of a spoiler alert for some of the stuff that's coming.
00:13:18.714 - 00:13:32.318, Speaker A: Is that a big? Part of what we're trying to do with Uniswap V Four is make it easier for people to experiment and innovate even within on AMM design and functionality. But having that happen still within the.
00:13:32.324 - 00:14:13.630, Speaker B: Uniswap ecosystem, what's the goal here, Hayden? I remember at one point in time when DEXes were still in their infancy and we were just hoping to get 5% market share from centralized exchanges. So basically all of the exchange volume happened with centralized exchanges. And wouldn't it be great if we could actually get this whole decentralized exchange thing off the ground and we could eke out maybe double digit percentage of volume. How do you think of the competitive landscape these days? Do you consider centralized exchanges as competitors, or would you draw those lines differently than maybe we did back in 2018? 2019?
00:14:14.050 - 00:15:11.854, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that it's pretty interesting. I say that generally decentralization offers some fundamental advantages. And the way that we always think is how do we expose those advantages to more people? And so it's definitely possible, I think centralized exchanges are going to continue to exist. But I think that there are really strong advantages of decentralized exchanges. And even things that are centralized exchanges today will start tapping into the liquidity from decentralized exchanges over time in terms of where it actually ends, really, I think that first it's DeFi growing bigger than CFI, and then it's DeFi growing bigger than TradFi. That's like the long term of it. And the purpose of that is not for its own sake, but because we think that that leads to a world with fairer, better financial system, more accessible financial system, just a better world in general.
00:15:12.052 - 00:15:42.378, Speaker B: These are what we call bankless values. And we don't talk about them. Maybe well, maybe we talk about them too much. David I'm not sure we'll let the listeners decide, but it's definitely why we enjoy having Hayden on the podcast, to kind of rearticulate it. And it's been baked into the DNA of uniswap from day one to provide a bankless exchange experience where user can retain custody of their private keys and their assets. And that is certainly we don't talk about it as much now in 2023. Right.
00:15:42.378 - 00:15:49.546, Speaker B: We're off chasing other things. But that is the core of this entire movement. I mean, that is why we're here.
00:15:49.648 - 00:16:05.598, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's what you said a lot of the time, kind of people who've been in the space for a really long time take it for granted, and it's sort of like, yeah, of course we're doing all that stuff, let's talk about what's new. But, yeah, agreed. The values are super important and really important to guiding even day to day decisions.
00:16:05.774 - 00:16:43.660, Speaker C: So, Hayden, I'll admit, when uniswap V three came out and concentrated liquidity added in just a whole entire layer of expression onto uniswap V three, uniswap in general, I was like, oh, that's the last uniswap. That's the final completion of uniswap. It's the logical conclusion that uniswap V three is now uniswap. So clearly I was wrong about that. So what was incomplete about uniswap V three that we need uniswap V four? So let's start unpacking the uniswap V four box. What does V four bring to the table that V three still had left to complete?
00:16:44.510 - 00:17:38.222, Speaker A: Yeah, so uniswap V three, I think it was a really good protocol, right? It's really proved itself. There's a reason it has such dominance today. It's really efficient, really flexible for liquidity providers relative to previous editions. I think that maybe the one thing that we really wanted to tackle with V four is Uniswap. V Three was also extremely opinionated. And what I mean by that is when you have these immutable smart contracts, the rules for it are kind of set in stone at creation and the more you can modify and upgrade in certain ways, it compromises on certain security properties and compromises on other things as well. And so I think that as an example, right in the process of designing unisoft V Three, there were like a million trade offs that had to be made.
00:17:38.222 - 00:18:34.258, Speaker A: And one example trade off is the price Oracles. So the price Oracles were really just basically at the beginning of every swap, the contracts store the first swap of every block. It stores the price and adds it to these accumulators. And with that you can basically other applications can extract really efficiently average prices across any period of time in the uniswap, in that uniswap pair. And it was a really good, almost like public good for the space many other projects have built on top of that feature. At the same time, running that logic for these price accumulators actually is a gas cost that is paid by swappers every swap. And so you could think of maybe something like 10% don't quote me on it, of the gas of swaps is going to updating these price Oracles and that amounts to a huge amount of money that swappers are paying over a period of time.
00:18:34.258 - 00:19:15.550, Speaker A: And the thought process was basically like, well, if uniswap can be used in more ways and in more places, then ultimately that will lead to more usage of the protocol, more liquidity in the protocol, and that will be better for swappers and offset the increased gas cost. Now has that played out probably in certain situations. Some pools the Oracles do get used and they're tightly integrated into important protocols. And in some pools maybe they don't get used at all. Probably the majority of pools actually they don't get used at all. And that's just like a tax on swappers paid over time. And the kind of opinionated way that V Three was implemented, that isn't like a choice that you can make when you deploy a pool.
00:19:15.550 - 00:19:45.240, Speaker A: So I'd say that the flagship feature of uniswap. Actually before I even I'd say another area that is really interesting as it relates to this sort of opinionated nature is like fees and how fees are implemented. There's a lot of different people who kind of experiment with we're going to build our own AMM. And usually what they're doing is actually just like experimenting with the fee logic. Sometimes they're doing other things, but that's like the most common thing that people do and there's like a few other changes.
00:19:45.770 - 00:19:56.858, Speaker C: People are building entirely new uniswap forks and what you're saying is and they're really just tinkering with the fee model and so they're building out entirely new exchange just to tinker with fees sometimes.
00:19:56.944 - 00:20:38.840, Speaker A: And maybe sometimes they're doing other changes as well, but sort of no matter what, they're probably doing more work than they should have to if all they're really trying to do is modify the functionality of a pool. And so I guess we'll get to the point of it, which is the flagship feature of Uniswap V Four is what we're calling hooks, which are essentially modules or customizations that you can make when you deploy a pool. And anyone can build a hook, anyone can implement one, and anyone who's creating a pool can choose what hooks their pool uses. And these hooks are pretty expressive, and they allow you to add on new features, new functionality, modify parameters of the pool in really interesting and meaningful ways.
00:20:39.450 - 00:21:32.038, Speaker C: So hooks. Okay, so you started off this conversation with Oracles and then also talked about fees. And these are all things opinions that you're saying Uniswap V Three had. If you wanted to start a new Uniswap V Three pool, you had embedded in it this Oracle feature whether you asked for it or not. And then because of that feature, swappers who touch the logic of every single V Three contract, every time they swap, pay for that complexity to be built into that V Three pool. So what you're saying is Unisoft V Four has these things called hooks that are like generalizable things to insert into a V Four pool. So I'm guessing a base V Four pool, a V Four uniswap exchange has almost zero features built into it, just, like, by default.
00:21:32.038 - 00:21:51.454, Speaker C: And then the idea is you can opt into certain features like the Oracle, like fee structures, et cetera, after the fact. But the standard issue uniswap V Four exchange is just like bare bones, primitive reductive, maximally simple, maximally cheap, maximally efficient. Am I on the right track here?
00:21:51.572 - 00:22:27.606, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. I think that funny enough, uniswap V Four actually has, like, the base system has almost less features, right, because the Oracles have been taken out of the contract, and now they can be implemented as a hook. And so in the process of building V Four, we also built a whole bunch of example hooks to show how expressive it is and the types of things that you can do. The simplest form actually has fewer features in a certain sense. Uniswap V Four, I could just start going through some examples of what you can do with hooks. Maybe we'll make it more clear. Okay, so one example is definitely dynamic fees.
00:22:27.606 - 00:23:33.550, Speaker A: So right now, when you deploy a new pool, the pool creator gets to choose between a few fixed fee tiers and actually the reason V Three yes. In V Three, you choose between there's, like, four different fee tiers today, and governance has the ability to add more. And the reason that there weren't, like, arbitrarily many is to kind of discourage liquidity from overly fragmenting and encourage people to kind of consolidate around specific pools with uniswap v Four. When you deploy a pool, you can choose any fee you want as a static fee or you could attach a dynamic fee hook and the dynamic fee hook could actually customize the logic of your fee in any way you want. One example would be that you could basically try to do some sort of oracle that tracks on chain volatility and automatically adjust the fee based on that. And that's an interesting experiment we've wanted to run for a long time, but we didn't want to hard code it into V Three because it was unclear if that was the optimal design. And so with uniswap V Four, people can experiment with a whole different world of fee implementations, volatility based.
00:23:33.550 - 00:24:14.602, Speaker A: You could imagine Dow controlled, et cetera. So that's one example. I think that's like a hook that will probably get a lot of usage. Other pretty major features that you can add onto a pool we have an implementation of a limit order hook which allows you to place limit orders at ticks. So right now you can kind of simulate limit orders a little bit in uniswap V Three by providing liquidity to very narrow ranges and withdrawing your liquidity after it's filled. But with uniswap V Four you could actually just create straight up limit orders that execute basically maybe to step back quickly. Hooks are basically code that run at certain points in the lifecycle of a pool and a transaction.
00:24:14.602 - 00:25:31.122, Speaker A: So you could imagine there's a hook that runs at the beginning of every swap, before every swap, run this code after every swap, run this code at the moment of pool creation, run this code before adding liquidity, run this code before anyone removes liquidity, run this code. And so the hook for a fee might be like code that runs before every swap or after every swap. Limit orders would also be code that runs during the swap transaction. So maybe another kind of interesting hook that we designed is there was this paper that Dan and Paradigm put out a while back called TWAM, which stood for a Time Weighted Average Market Maker. Long kind of don't want to go way into the complexity in the weeds of it, but essentially when you think about a unisoft pool and people who want to make very large orders, very large orders relative to the size of the pool, you're going to get a lot of price impact and you'll get a worse price. And so usually when you have to make a very large order, if you want to trade it over uniswap, you would probably want to break that order up into many pieces and you'd have to submit a separate transaction spanned over multiple blocks. And that kind of reduces the sort of price impact of your trade.
00:25:31.122 - 00:26:20.610, Speaker A: And Tom is this idea of essentially creating long form orders on top of AMMS that would basically split up into little pieces and could execute over time and you could have them happening in both directions and it's sort of reducing the price impact of a trade and spreading it out over a long period of time. So you could imagine like sell 1 million USDC over the next day or over the next hour or the next week. And this is a really interesting, cool feature. And to do it properly, you can build it externally. But to do it properly and have it really benefit from the liquidity within the protocol, then you actually do need to have it run at specific points. You need to sort of guarantee that it's going to run before swap tap, before people add or remove liquidity to properly do the accounting. So you can build this entirely as a hook.
00:26:20.610 - 00:27:07.140, Speaker A: And we think this can be really powerful for one example is for like protocol, treasury rebalancing, stuff like that, or just generally large orders. And the nice thing is that it executes your order over a very long period of time, but you only pay the gas costs at creation and closing of the order. Those are two examples. So the point is it spans from customization of pool parameters like how fees work, which can be really interesting and meaningful and actually change the economics of a pool. You could try to have a pool that favors passive liquidity providers more than active liquidity providers if that's what you want to do. But it also ranges to entirely new order types like Tuam and limit orders. Have a few other ones I'm very excited to talk about as well.
00:27:07.690 - 00:27:54.578, Speaker C: I definitely want to unpack every single one, but I really just want to double down on the emphasis that this new hook feature inside of V four pools brings to the table with regards to developers. So just going back to the Fees hook example where right now uniswap V three has you said four fee tiers, I believe it started as three, then uniswap governance invoted in a fourth. And so these are four fee tiers that a uniswap V three pool could be created under. And like you said, the reason why only four is because we need to coalesce liquidity under shelling points. Right, just pick four of these. Ten is too many, one or two is not enough. But we need to have convergence of liquidity upon specific pools in order to have any liquidity at all.
00:27:54.578 - 00:29:01.382, Speaker C: And you said that, well, we were interested uniswap Labs or Uniswap in general, was interested in making a more dynamic version of Fees that would be more flexible to incorporate wider ranges of fees based on certain parameters. But you all didn't want to create that because that was an opinion and you didn't want to make that as a part of a core V three contract. But now with hooks we could have someone or some group of people create that logic for what is a flexible and adaptive fee structure for most. Types of uniswap pools. And that could become the new shelling point of the new standard. And so I'm assuming, like, over time, certain hooks, certain apps, uni apps, uni widgets will be developed in public with many, many people, and one or a few will emerge as like the leading hooks for generalized fee tiers for uniswap V Four pools. Or this is the leading, most incorporated, most hooked in feature, most hooked in hook for on chain limit orders.
00:29:01.382 - 00:29:31.986, Speaker C: And this is now the on chain limit order hook because this is now no longer being developed internally to the protocol. This is now developed externally as a part of just building on permissionless, open source rails. And so a lot of this complexity of how to make a flexible, adaptive, uniswap V Four pool is being pushed to the margins and allowing the shelling points of what are good hooks and what are good uniswap features to be kind of determined by the free open source market. Am I on track here?
00:29:32.168 - 00:30:42.038, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. I think I've definitely trended in my own thinking, just seeing how it plays out towards just more expressiveness, more flexibility over super constrained shelling points. I think shelling points are really valuable, but I think that the shelling points will happen over the best designs. I will mention that there are, like, a few other features of V four that blend really nicely with hooks that I just want to quickly mention that help, which is, like, the other kind of kind of core feature. Is a bunch of architectural changes to the contract that we're calling Singleton and Flash accounting, which essentially are aimed at significantly reducing the cost of fragmentation across many pools and making it much more efficient to route across many pools. So we're entering a world of many more pools and pool designs. And what we're trying to do is say, for pools within the uniswap ecosystem, can we significantly reduce the cost of fragmentation and make it easier to route across more pools more efficiently? So the Singleton design essentially is saying it basically has all pools live in a single smart contract.
00:30:42.038 - 00:31:28.140, Speaker A: And Flash accounting is just a new way of doing some of the logic that basically makes it easier to right now, when you make a trade that executes across many pools, it's basically like sending tokens between pools. And it has a very opinionated order of operations. And the core idea of flash accounting. Kind of like the way flash loans allow you to take whatever you want and then do everything you want and then as long as you paid it back at the end, uniswap V Four actually lets you basically do anything you want across any number of possible order transaction types within all uniswap pools, as long as across all of it at the end. It's sort of reconciled insolvent and then only transfers net balances in and out of the pool. Or actually, you don't even have to transfer it in or out of the pool. But that's another little feature that we can come back to.
00:31:28.140 - 00:32:25.866, Speaker A: But the general point here is that hooks introduce much more expressiveness, many more different pool types. And singleton and flash accounting basically just make it more efficient to route across more pools at once. And also, I think that the one other thing that I'll note there is that today there's sort of a cost to fragmentation across AMMS that's sort of imposed on the space. You can think about, like, the more AMM pools exist in, the more places there's like, gas cost to constantly be ARB. Ethereum only has so much capacity to some degree, obviously. And basically there's a cost to constantly arbing across all the different AMM pools and there's also a cost to splitting your order across more pools. And so one of the nice sort of things about Uniswap e Four most like as a platform, is that if you build your custom AMM logic within hooks instead of externally, you actually get to benefit from this sort.
00:32:25.866 - 00:32:40.094, Speaker A: Of like shared contract pool model. Which will mean that building your innovations within Uniswap will actually lead to more efficient routing across everyone else building within Uniswap. And it's sort of like a nice network effect and benefit to doing that.
00:32:40.292 - 00:33:56.242, Speaker B: Okay, I want to pull two things out of this, Hayden. So the first is when we talk about Uniswap V Four, we're talking about a specific set of features. One is Hooks, which we're going to spend even more time on, I think. The other is Singleton, which you mentioned, and flash accounting. I wanted to go back and talk about this design philosophy where you're saying with Uniswap V Four you guys are trending towards more expressivity, which is very interesting because this is kind of counter to the reason you picked those four different or three different fee tiers for Uniswap V Three pools. Really, the idea was so that you don't lose liquidity, right? So there's not thousands of different pools out there and you're kind of like spreading your liquidity too thin across all of those pools. I think what you're saying is because there are some incentives or benefits through singleton's and through flash accounting that sort of there's almost like a tax, not an explicit protocol tax, but like an efficiency loss type tax native to uniswap that will still collapse towards a small, more shared liquidity.
00:33:56.242 - 00:34:28.980, Speaker B: I guess what I'm trying to ask is, why are you no longer concerned about the thing that you were concerned about in Uniswap v. Three? Which is like, well, if we're creating the opportunity and the white space for all of these different pools, we just lose the network effect. We lose all of the liquidity, and there will be no shelling point in a specific set of pools. Why is that no longer a concern? Is it because of singleton, flash accounting and kind of still the inherent efficiency that you gain here or why the change in rationale here.
00:34:29.350 - 00:35:06.394, Speaker A: So I should quickly clarify, there's not a tax. There's actually a benefit. Basically, if you build your sort of custom AMM as a hook within the Uniswap singleton contract, then it is much more efficient to route it with other uniswap pools than it is to route, say, between uniswap and an external. You know, generally most people are trading today when you trade across multiple pools, there is sort of an inherent tax to trading across multiple pools. And what we're doing with Singleton in Slash accounting is essentially reducing that tax significantly when you're trading within the Uniswap ecosystem.
00:35:06.442 - 00:35:07.114, Speaker B: So it's all carrot.
00:35:07.162 - 00:35:37.014, Speaker A: No stick is the way yeah, no stick here. It's all carrots. We're basically saying, yeah, if you build an entirely separate AMM, then there is going to be a trade that sort of splits across uniswap. And this external AMM will has like a higher gas cost similar to how it does today. Right? There's no stick on that either. But if you build your custom AMM within uniswap as a hook, it actually is more efficient to route. That happens because of essentially this.
00:35:37.014 - 00:36:27.110, Speaker A: Like all the pools are stored in the same contract and we have cool ways of doing some of the accounting logic. And even transient storage, which is in the next Ethereum hard fork, kind of plays a little bit of a role here where we're using transient storage to more efficiently update internal balances and save gas there as well. But no, it's really purely a benefit in terms of liquidity fragmentation. More broadly, I'd say that I still believe Shelling points will exist and there's even ways to helping encourage that through interface and default and all of that. But I think that what we're also starting to say is that, yes, shelling points will exist, but also this innovation is going to happen. Let's have it happen as safely as possible. Let's have it happen within the Uniswap ecosystem.
00:36:27.110 - 00:37:26.250, Speaker A: Let's speed up the rate of AMM innovation and allow shelling points to form around some of the best designs as opposed to just around Uniswap as a monolithic thing. I'd also mentioned that some of the network effects are really just like infrastructure that us and other teams build around the protocol. And I think that having more stuff built into selfie four, there'll still be sort of this network effect of tooling and integrations and to some degree even the security and safety of it. A cool thing is that when you're building an entire custom AMM that's a really complicated smart contract, you kind of need to audit the entire thing from scratch. And with hooks you need to audit the hook basically. Kind of like the same way Ethereum lets you build safe smart contracts, it doesn't prevent you from making unsafe smart contracts. I think of a similar thing to hooks where hooks make it possible to build very safe custom pools that have very limited functionality.
00:37:26.250 - 00:38:06.230, Speaker A: A hook that changes how fees work is very different from an entire AMM that changes how fees work in terms of your starting point and how easy it is to build, how fast you can build it, how easy it is to audit, et cetera. And so all carrots here. We're trying to make it as safe and easy to innovate. And then the point being, really, just like, we do expect there to be some additional fragmentation, but we still expect showing points to happen, the cost of fragmentation is being significantly reduced, not increased.
00:38:06.730 - 00:38:59.074, Speaker C: So there are some really strong parallels between uniswap V Four and the Ethereum roadmap. I see the parallels here. I'll call this like a hook centric roadmap for uniswap. Whereas Ethereum has its roll up centric roadmap, uniswap has now a hook centric roadmap. And I want to get to that conversation, but I think we need to start there with the singleton contracts. The singleton design uniswap V Three and V Two and V One, I believe, all had this thing called a factory contract where uniswap pools, uniswap exchanges were spun out individually and they were all separate contracts. So if you made a new token and then you made a uniswap pool to correspond with that new token, that is a brand new smart contract on Ethereum, that is the same contract as, like, the USDC Ether uniswap pool, but it's still a separate contract.
00:38:59.074 - 00:39:08.374, Speaker C: And so a singleton contract is something that's the opposite of that. Can you just unpack that a little bit more Hayden? Like, what does it mean for everything to be under one contract?
00:39:08.502 - 00:39:24.174, Speaker A: Yeah, so what it means is that we're duplicating the same code across a million different smart contracts, and that has a cost to everyone. One cool thing about the single to design is it actually reduces current estimates have it reducing the gas cost of pool deployment by about 99%.
00:39:24.292 - 00:39:25.294, Speaker B: Wait, what?
00:39:25.492 - 00:39:40.134, Speaker A: Yeah, so it goes from like, gas costs vary a lot, but you could imagine sometimes people pay when gas costs are high, like north of $1,000 to deploy a pool just in gas cost. And that same deployment would be something like $10 again because you were just.
00:39:40.172 - 00:39:42.386, Speaker C: Updating a preexisting contract.
00:39:42.498 - 00:40:10.522, Speaker A: Yeah, most of the code isn't being replicated. It's just like adding a little thing, making a little modification to an existing contract. It's not deploying an entirely new smart contract. So gas costs for deployments go down massively. That's sort of like one of the advantages. There were designs that actually did reduce the gas cost for V Three, but in ways that slightly increased gas cost for swappers. That was sort of like this design a lot of people use where you call out into a library contract.
00:40:10.522 - 00:40:45.130, Speaker A: But that's sort of like one of the benefits of singleton. The other benefit is that when you can imagine transactions that interact with multiple pools and have multiple interactions with multiple pools. A lot of what they're doing is they're updating the same. You can imagine. Let's say I'm doing like a multi hop swap. I'm going like ETH to Dai to USDC or something that actually involves routing ETH into the ETH Dai contract. Then Dai is sent from the Ethi contract to the Dai USDC contract, converted to USDC, and then USDC is sent back to the user.
00:40:45.130 - 00:41:40.714, Speaker A: When you have everything stored in the same contract, those internal transfers don't actually need to happen. They're sort of like ephemeral. And Ethereum already today has a method of basically if you are updating it. So one thing is that there's basically less transfers happening under the hoods when you have multi step transactions or transactions that route between many pools. Ethereum has like this thing called a gas refund. It's super technical, under the hood stuff, but might as well for those who understand this, mention it quickly. Ethereum has a thing called a gas refund, which basically means that if you are updating something and then the same thing multiple times is cheaper than basically updating different things because that's easier on an Ethereum node, essentially, and we'll get out of the weeds in a second.
00:41:40.714 - 00:42:18.454, Speaker A: But the refund has like a cap. So basically there's like a limit to if you update the same thing like a thousand times, the refund sort of runs out and then you basically don't actually get any of the refund. So there's this new proposal called transient storage, which is slated for the next ethereum hard fork and that provides additional benefits where you can actually save on gas for things that are updating the same contract multiple times well beyond this sort of refund, which was capped out at 20% of the sort of gas provided to the transaction. So there's sort of like additional gas savings kind of like on the forefront of the next Ethereum upgrade, which is kind of exciting.
00:42:18.582 - 00:42:27.660, Speaker B: Am I misremembering that? Was there some controversy about this particular Ethereum upgrade at all? Or you guys refresh me on that?
00:42:31.550 - 00:43:17.660, Speaker A: I don't think there's any controversy around the proposal itself. It's technically very sound and there's no real controversy around it. I think that there was like a strong push to have it happen in the previous hard fork, which didn't happen in part because we thought it was like an obvious win for developers. There's many other projects that also want this and want to build on top of it and have come out in favor of it, but it ultimately didn't make into the previous Ethereum hard fork because there was a lot of other things happening in that hard fork. But it was sort of very non controversially added to the most recent one because it's very far along and it's not competing with the merge. It was kind of a little bit of like a day of drama on Twitter, but it wasn't really like at this point, it doesn't feel controversial at all.
00:43:18.430 - 00:44:05.994, Speaker C: So I want to see if I can get bankless listeners heads wrapped around this pattern that I'm seeing with Uniswap. And this again goes back to the whole hook centric roadmap for uniswap. So a while ago, a long time ago, ethereum's long term vision came to be defined as like this roll up centric roadmap, aka like roll ups are going to be treated as a primary concern for Ethereum's design philosophy. The Ethereum researchers came to the conclusion that roll ups are like the ultimate form of expressive apps for Ethereum in terms of scalability. And so the idea was that Ethereum would constrain the layer one push complexity to the edges using roll ups. And this became like the modular Ethereum design philosophy. The Ethereum layer one does not need to be concerned with doing it all.
00:44:05.994 - 00:45:04.922, Speaker C: And that role can be pushed to the open source community building permissionlessly in the free market. Which is why we have so many roll ups teams building different roll up scaling strategies, polygon optimism, arbitram, zksync, you know, all scroll tyco, all of these crazy things. And the only reason why all of these Ethereum microcosms exist is because of the primacy of the roll up centric mode map for Ethereum. I see that same pattern playing out with uniswap. So I want to check this metaphor with you, Hayden, make sure this is right. But I think uniswap V Two and V Three, where we had this deployer contract, this factory contract that spit out new uniswap contracts that were all disconnected to each other, is like the cross l one bridge version of layer ones. Whereas the singleton contract is like the roll up centric roadmap for Ethereum because everything is placed into the singleton contract.
00:45:04.922 - 00:45:30.198, Speaker C: Everything is under one platform. There is a very constrained reductive base, call it uniswap V Four pools and then there's hooks. Hence the hook centric roadmap for uniswap. These are my words. I don't know if Hayden accept these words. The hook centric roadmap for uniswap places complexity back into the base of uniswap V four via hooks. And hooks are freely developed in public.
00:45:30.198 - 00:45:52.374, Speaker C: They are highly generalized for all public pools to use. Or they can be pool or use case specific kind of like role apps or app chains. But we can have hooks that are just meant for one or a few pools, or we can have hooks that are generalizable. And so now we have modular Ethereum and now we also have modular uniswap. Hayden, do you accept this metaphor? Would you throw any flags?
00:45:52.422 - 00:46:18.978, Speaker A: I accept the know. I think that definitely we are definitely going to modular customizable uniswap. And I'd say that it's not turn complete the way Ethereum is, but it's much more expressive. And if you have a gradient of turn completeness, it is more turning complete than uniswap V two. It's more expressive. And really you can do a lot of things with hooks. And we are definitely pushing complexity to the edges.
00:46:18.978 - 00:46:42.060, Speaker A: We're definitely encouraging a world of other people to try. There's no clear single way to best way to scale Ethereum. And so Ethereum is allowing other people to experiment with the best way to scale Ethereum. And I'd say that uniswap very similarly. There's no single best tool design. We're enabling a whole world of experimentation. So definitely the metaphor lands for me in that way, for sure.
00:46:42.060 - 00:46:58.900, Speaker A: I'll also mention just casually don't want to open a whole can of worms with this, but technically, Uniswap is also on a rollup centric roadmap, and that we all are, because Ethereum is on one. And so I think that that's definitely like an avenue of future exploration, but sort of like kind of parallel to V Four.
00:46:59.510 - 00:47:17.480, Speaker B: Hayden, while we're on roll ups for a minute, can you also describe Uniswap's approach to all of the various roll ups? I know that's kind of orthogonal to our conversation today about Uniswap V Four, but will Uniswap have a presence on all roll ups or how does that work?
00:47:17.870 - 00:47:58.094, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that we're all on this roll up centric roadmap journey in Ethereum right now. And I think that we've been to date, it's really been about supporting the roll ups on the protocol level. There's been this whole process around governance and people are doing votes to deploy the different chains. But within Labs products, we're kind of like supporting chains as there are ones that have users and it's almost worth the time to do the work. And it is a lot of work to support new chains in our products. But yeah, so it's really been about just making sure that Uniswap is on all the chains that get traction and have usage.
00:47:58.142 - 00:48:00.674, Speaker B: And uniswap v four would be on all the chains.
00:48:00.802 - 00:48:28.910, Speaker A: And yeah, Uniswap V Four similarly would be on all the chains. In terms of if there's a future world where there's a uniswap specific roll up or something like that, I think that sort of remains to be seen. I think it's like a really interesting avenue of exploration. I'm personally excited by some of the off chain vision and all that stuff. As I mentioned, we're kind of like all on this roll up centric roadmap. There's no getting off it because Ethereum is on it. Sometimes I think that people almost don't even internalize everything that means.
00:48:28.910 - 00:49:03.706, Speaker A: But, yeah, it's a pretty cool, interesting direction for Ethereum. I think that maybe what I was getting. I think that there's a lot like scaling execution is actually pretty hard. And I think it kind of makes sense that Ethereum pushed that to the edges. But I think that sometimes people almost underestimate how much work there is to do on the roll up side and how big of an effort that is. Right. It's kind of like in the long, right? Maybe it's more of an effort than building ethereum itself to build the right roll ups on ethereum anyway.
00:49:03.808 - 00:49:29.618, Speaker B: Yeah, I completely agree. I mean, part of modular ethereum, the roll up centric design roadmap, was obviously focusing ethereum on what it does best at the core and the consensus layer. But also, I mean, some of these problems are complicated. They're complex, they're thorny, and so nice to push them up to other teams rather than have the ethereum research team sort of do everything. I don't know if that similar to.
00:49:29.624 - 00:50:14.034, Speaker A: Your strategy with hooks, but I think it both makes sense. But there are implications to it where the more you push to other teams, there are sometimes benefits of working on multiple layers of the stack. It's something that we've learned a lot at uniswap is having a mobile wallet and having a smart contract team and a protocol working multiple layers of stack where you're able to kind of sort of innovate across the stack a little bit. And there are things like even it came up in this conversation where EIP 1153 provides very significant benefits to Uniswap V four. And that required it was sort of like already a proposal that happened many years. The initial proposal was like before the V One launch. So this idea has been around for a long time.
00:50:14.034 - 00:50:40.486, Speaker A: But there's sort of like this sometimes if you don't have the right layers of modularness, if you don't have enough expressiveness in each layer, then you sort of can run into constraints of the system in which you're building. So that's a risk of hooks, it's a risk of ethereum's roadmap, but it's also like, ultimately it kind of makes sense as well.
00:50:40.668 - 00:51:40.986, Speaker B: I get it. It's definitely a trade off, though, right? It's like I was thinking of Vitalik's most recent post where he talks about the three transitions, by the way, he talks about kind of everyone moving to roll ups. That's going to be a massive transition for Ethereum, that everyone has to move to smart contract wallets and we have to somehow figure out how to get privacy working. There is something nice about the monolithic vision because you can control all layers of the stack and so what gets sacrificed or maybe trade off is the right word for this in a modular kind of structure is user experience. Sometimes it can be difficult to weave this all together, whereas monolithic has other challenges, but you have the opportunity to get kind of user experience down. Let's get back to kind of the hook centric roadmap for uniswap. Who's going to build hooks? Who are the devs? Who are the builders that actually, we know in the rollup community, all of the teams building roll ups and kind of the advantage to doing that.
00:51:40.986 - 00:51:49.182, Speaker B: They want to create their own kind of ecosystems, build their own chains. Lots of reasons for doing this. Who are the builders behind hooks? What will they look like? What are they going to dream up.
00:51:49.316 - 00:52:46.234, Speaker A: Yeah, there's so many possibilities and we're kind of constrained by what we've already thought of, but there's so many other we kind of expect maybe the coolest hooks will be ones that we haven't dreamed up yet. So ones we've already mentioned are things like so obviously we've built a few hooks almost to prove the system. So some of the ones we already mentioned were like TWAM and on chain limit orders and swap fees. I think we expect probably one category of hook builder is like people who need basically people with projects with on chain protocols that interface and interact with you. It's basically like the people who build on uniswap today, but they can build on it in a more meaningful way. So any project that has uniswap as a core component of their system, we expect that they can build what they're building in a more efficient or more meaningful or more expressive or better way with hooks. So that's sort of one category.
00:52:46.234 - 00:53:09.190, Speaker A: I'd say that people who want to anyone who's building an AMM today, I don't know, maybe they'll continue building their own AMM. It sort of depends. But definitely the type of people who would go out and build a new AMM might be more likely to say, okay, well, rather than building a whole AMM, why don't I just try it out as a hook? So liquidity providers, I think, DeFi builders.
00:53:09.530 - 00:53:11.306, Speaker B: Is it accurate to say instead of.
00:53:11.328 - 00:53:17.580, Speaker C: Starting your own layer one, why not just build a roll up on ethereum? It's the same conversation exactly.
00:53:18.670 - 00:54:04.346, Speaker B: Is it accurate to say anybody who wants to use the verb swap? In the early days of bankless we used to talk about making all of kind of these money verbs basically real and bankless. So verbs like lend, borrow a verb that uniswap has dominated has been trade or swap. Anyone who is sort of doing swap functionality as part of their application, whether it's some sort of aggregator like a matcha for example, maybe they're dealing with swap. Anyone who is working with the swap verb might have something that they can build as a hook with uniswap. So that kind of opens the door to basically any application that needs this basic trade swap type primitive, is that correct?
00:54:04.528 - 00:54:10.634, Speaker A: Yeah. I do like to think of the two sides of the marketplace where it's definitely like swapping and also creating liquidity in the first place.
00:54:10.672 - 00:54:12.250, Speaker B: Forget about liquidity providers.
00:54:13.170 - 00:54:55.610, Speaker A: They're an important bunch, although sometimes not talked about as much as the swappers. But creating liquidity, anyone who's creating liquidity in any way, I'd say that this just provides so much more flexibility in how you do it. Now, it's very possible that certain hooks will be much a few hooks will rise up as the most popular used hooks. If I had to take some guesses, things like some of the ones I already talked about might be examples. So certain hooks might be the most used. And maybe most people interact with hooks just by adopting a few common ones that change in meaningful ways. But then, yeah, really, anyone that creates liquidity might want to create liquidity in more expressive, interesting ways as well as anyone building a protocol that needs swapping functionality.
00:54:55.610 - 00:55:55.530, Speaker A: I could give a few more examples of hooks that we've talked about and thought about or built examples of yeah, go for it to help spur some of this. So I guess one example is even like this one is more theorized. We don't have an implementation of it at the moment, at any given moment for a uniswap trade. There's like uniswap V Three, split the pools up into discrete ticks and then there's like, liquidity exists between ticks and it's almost like many uniswap pools for each split up into each tick. And we sort of theorized about the idea of vaults that stored out of range liquidity in lending protocols and would sort of pull them out as a trade got closer. But that wasn't super easy to do in uniswap V Three because you don't sort of have a guarantee that you can pull liquidity out of the lending pool before the trade crosses a certain price. Whereas with uniswap V Three you actually can, or before you actually can using a hook.
00:55:55.530 - 00:56:48.560, Speaker A: And so an example is just like increasing your yield where all liquidity that's not stored in the current tick could be stored in a lending protocol and earning whatever it's earning. And then as the price crosses out of the tick just in real time, could pull the liquidity out of the lending pool and start trading into it. And in that way you don't actually have to. There's sort of like the risk in V Three if you do it externally that you don't pull the liquidity in time and it sort of gets rebalanced in a way you weren't expecting or something if you were to try to do something like that. So like increasing your yield by building a thing that stores extra liquidity in lending pools but does have a guarantee that it will be executed at the time that it will be included in the contract at the time of the swap is like one pretty interesting idea. We haven't built this, but we know it's possible. I think this is an interesting class of designs that might come up.
00:56:48.560 - 00:58:14.358, Speaker A: Probably most of these will use the swap fee hook, but just like attempting to internalize mev better for liquidity providers, you know, there's sort of like a lot of liquidity providing a lot of value. Is is kind know, people always talk about mev and how do we kind of keep more of that for our swappers or for our LPs? And I'd say that like, there are definitely classes of hooks that can attempt to do that, whether by adjusting the swap fee in real time or proportional to size of trader. Whatever it is, you can even do things like auctioning off basically allowing people to you could almost do like a harbor attacks or something for all fees in the pool. And so basically it's like kind of like, again, this is sort of theoretical, we haven't built this, we haven't proven it, but these are sort of like general places our brains have gone is like you could allow basically anyone to set the fees for a pool and they could pay liquidity providers for that, right? And then you could imagine in that way the mev is sort of internalized to some degree by properly setting the fees and paying it out to liquidity providers. Those are maybe two even more complex examples. But I think just like there's so many different kind of ideas and designs in the AMM space. People are always talking about them, we're always having them, but today it's never worth it to build it because it's like we can't build the entire next version of the protocol around one of these ideas.
00:58:14.358 - 00:59:04.358, Speaker A: They're just interesting ideas. Oh, I'll mention another category of hook that exists is actually potential withdrawal fees as a hook as well. So fees take, today fees are only taken on swapping and before it's actually possible for hooks to take fees on adding and removing liquidity and could sort of redirect those back to LPs. And so in that way you could kind of, for example, have the more active a liquidity provider is, maybe you could sort of have more of those fees go to passive liquidity providers and maybe passive liquidity providers would be more willing to provide in those pools. Those are sort of like some kind of additional examples. I think that there's so many though any project that needs an oracle probably will be tempered. I think that even V two and V three oracles, they weren't just like opinionated.
00:59:04.358 - 01:00:16.658, Speaker A: There are also weaknesses of them because they were opinionated in that we implemented them, but they were kind of like trying to be very neutral in what they were because they were trying to serve all possible oracles. But that's not very maybe the best oracle is removing outliers and doing on chain medians and all these other things. And so anyone that wants an oracle now you can actually build your oracle into a pool and you sort of have a guarantee that that pool is like tracking. It's sort of the difference between you could build an oracle external to a pool, but that pool can only read from the pool at moments where it is asked to do so versus when it's in a hook. You have a guarantee that that oracle can be updated at every swap or at every provide liquidity or at every interaction with the pool. And so you sort of have a guarantee that that oracle can always be super up to. So, you know, if you think of it as like any contract that needs to be updated with any specific type of interactions with a uniswap pool can now be fully up to date and sort of doesn't need to rely on being poked externally by people, which is kind of interesting.

Notes introducing Ethx from Stator Ethx is a liquid staking token designed to maximize rewards, all while securing ethereum. With Stator, you can run an ethereum node with just four ETH, an 85% lower capital requirement versus the 32 ETH required for solo staking.
01:02:24.614 - 01:03:13.634, Speaker C: With Stator's four ETH nodes, you can get a 35% average higher yield since you charge fees to those who use your node to stake their ETH. By running a node with Stator, the Ethx staking derivative token can get minted on your validators and can flow into the world of DeFi, which Stator is actively building integrations and partnerships into. To increase the utility of Ethx, Stator allows for both permissioned and permissionless nodes to join the network, maximizing its potential scalability for Ethx while preserving the values of decentralization and openness behind its liquid staking token. Go to Statorlabs.com ETH and sign up to get access to the Stator Staking protocol.

Visit Arbitrum IO, where you can join the community, dive into the developer docs, bridge your assets, and start building your first DAP with Arbitrum experience Web Three development the way it was meant to be secure, fast, cheap, and friction free. There's something that you said that I just want to double down on because it just gets me really excited. You said that you and other people at Uniswap Labs, and I'm sure just anyone that you talk to about nerd stuff, about uniswap all of these ideas of what could be placed into a pool, uniswap V Three didn't have a way of receiving those ideas.
01:04:17.258 - 01:04:42.146, Speaker C: And so every time you all are having your serial futurist daydreams about what a crazy Uniswap Four pool could be, I'm just bullish on the fact that Uniswap V Four can actually receive those ideas now. Because whereas Uniswap V Three was constrained in its ability to accept expressivity, uniswap V Four can now start to get pretty crazy and pretty weird. And so that makes me bullish.
01:04:42.178 - 01:04:44.310, Speaker A: Well, exactly.
01:04:44.380 - 01:05:25.574, Speaker B: That's what's interesting about this, Hayden. Even the Word choice that you're using, you're calling these things hooks as opposed to maybe Widgets or as opposed to apps or something like that. And I guess, look, I'm not a programmer. I'm sure the term hooks is used in all sorts of other places. The area I'm familiar with it is in CMS platforms like WordPress, right? Which is like and WordPress is this kind of ecosystem where anybody can kind of create a hook in WordPress. And hook is not a specific app. It implies kind of openness, it implies permissionlessness, it implies anyone can develop it.
01:05:25.574 - 01:05:55.280, Speaker B: And it's broader than an app. It could do something very small, like implement a Captcha service on WordPress, or it could do something entire, very big, like implement an entire feature set on top of WordPress. I'm curious, what other maybe an analog to this in another developer ecosystem? Why did you use the term hook rather than App or rather than Widget or something else?
01:05:56.050 - 01:06:23.766, Speaker A: I think you nailed it. Beautifully said. Part of it is it's like moments at which the contract it's sort of like kind of a moment where the contract can call out to another. They're sort of like moments where you can inject code in an arbitrary point and Hooks just felt like a good kind of moment for that versus like a widget or an app. Sounds almost like marketing or branding. This is sort of more like a low level code base kind of feature. So that's part of it.
01:06:23.766 - 01:07:14.310, Speaker A: I can mention even something here quickly on the history of how we came up with Hooks. I don't remember actually specifically who this sort of has been an idea that's been in our brain for a while, but it came out of this idea that we had had. This was before V two. One of the features we were considering in V Two was an external contract that basically had the right sort of first back running rights to every trade. And what I mean by that is when someone is making a trade that moves the price from the market price away from the market price, there's sort of like a back running kind of opportunity and giving back running rights. If you are sort of like auction off those back running rights then you can sort of give some of the profits back. You can basically reduce the kind of price impact of a trade.
01:07:14.310 - 01:08:02.710, Speaker A: And this is sort of a design space that is still very relevant today. You hear the Flashbots team talking about it. It's something that people talk about when they talk about intents. It's like how do we kind of reduce mev? And so we had this sort of general concept of what if at the very end of every uniswap V Two swap, it arbitrarily called a specific contract. And that specific contract was able to with preset prices built in, the contract would be able to kind of trade back in the other direction and then reshare some of those profits back to the swapper. And then maybe you'd sort of auction off that external contract. We called this idea like Trader Dow or something and it sort of was an idea in the back of our brains for like literally since before V Two launch.
01:08:02.710 - 01:08:46.254, Speaker A: And I think that sort of that idea of that feature where it's like at the end of every swap, do this. And then we sort of ran into that pattern again with the Oracles where it's like at the beginning of every swap of a transaction, if it's the first swap of a block, then update the Oracle. And we started to realize there were multiple points within the transactions lifecycle where you wanted to do arbitrary things sometimes. And so that's sort of like where Hooks came from. It came out of this idea of, oh, there is a time in a transactions lifecycle where it's useful to immediately execute some other code and not allow any other code to execute before that code. So that's sort of like where some of this comes from historically.
01:08:46.382 - 01:08:49.602, Speaker B: Now those ideas, like the trader Dow idea that can be implemented as a hook.
01:08:49.666 - 01:08:56.166, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. And maybe it was a good idea, maybe it wasn't. It's sort of like a now we.
01:08:56.188 - 01:08:57.990, Speaker C: Can find out in 2019.
01:08:59.130 - 01:09:15.710, Speaker A: I think that even if we were doing it today, we'd probably do it very differently from how I described it. But now we can find out. Now anyone can run an experiment in AMM designs much faster, much more easy. So super exciting.
01:09:16.370 - 01:09:53.306, Speaker C: I'm just going to put on my speculative cap here and I bet you there is a bunch of use cases for token minting and token issuances that I'll probably not ask Kaden about. And I'll just leave that to the imaginations of the listeners that there's probably a way to do a token issuance with this as an app on Uniswap that is developed by the open source community. Hayden, I have a we should as a hook. As a hook, yes. Right. I have a question about some of the bigger pools. So it makes the uniswap v four with specific hooks that do specific things.
01:09:53.306 - 01:10:44.454, Speaker C: Sounds like from the individual developer standpoint, awesome. As in I can do cool new things that I was never able to do before. But some of these bigger pools in uniswap v three have a ton of liquidity in them, like the Die Ether Pool, the USDC Ether Pool. And if we are assuming that we can make a better v four pool for these very large v three pools, we're going to actually need to get that liquidity to migrate. And it's an open, interesting question as to how do we determine who decides what the best USDC Ether Pool is on uniswap v four and how do we even have a shelling point of like, hey, uniswap v three liquidity go to uniswap v four? It's better now. How do you think we're going to get this to progress? Do you think we are stuck inside of some pools, are stuck inside of uniswap v three forever? How will we get migration to happen? Do you have any thoughts on this, by the way?
01:10:44.492 - 01:10:51.054, Speaker B: I remember being really worried about this with v two and I was like, well, how are they going to get all the liquidity to move from v two to v three?
01:10:51.252 - 01:11:02.640, Speaker C: Well, v two to v three was a paradigm shift in liquidity expressivity. And to me that made sense because of concentrated liquidity with this one, I don't know.
01:11:03.010 - 01:11:33.114, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, for what it's worth, like the unisox pool, the biggest unisox pool is still in v one. And so, yeah, I think that the answer is like a combination of things. It's like a really interesting, complex topic. But I'd say that v one almost no one uses it's mainly only used for unisox trading at this point, which is pretty fun. V two still actually gets a lot of usage and new pools created. V Three, obviously even more usage, especially by volume, because we should tell people.
01:11:33.232 - 01:11:57.202, Speaker B: Just for the listener who's not familiar with how uniswap works, is the contracts never die once you deploy V One, V Two, V Three, they live forever. They're out there. Anyone can use them. Just as the day they were first deployed, they don't go away. So almost like a new version of uniswap has to earn its place in the world, earn its liquidity, has to earn its swap users, it has to earn the market, doesn't it?
01:11:57.336 - 01:12:25.686, Speaker A: Yeah. So I'd say that with V Three. What's really interesting sorry? With V four, I actually don't expect as fast of a migration as from V two to V three. Or from V one to V Two. I think it will be probably a little bit of a slower migration. But that the long term network effects of the sort of gas improvements of pooling liquidity within a singleton contract. Basically, maybe the initial liquidity pools in V Four will really be like specific use cases that need a uniswap V Four hook.
01:12:25.686 - 01:13:18.154, Speaker A: But the more of those that start to get created, the more liquidity that starts to get in this singleton contract. Suddenly you can create an identical pool like you can make the same trade offs V Three did in V Four, and you'll now have more efficient routing against other V Four pools. And so I'd say that over time, the sort of shelling point of the singleton contract and the benefits of pooling liquidity will win out. And so I do expect, like a slower migration relative to V Two just because it's more complicated, there's more things happening, it's a bigger ecosystem. V three is extremely efficient relative to v two. There are a bunch of other improvements to Unisoft in Unisoft V Four that I haven't mentioned yet, which might be a good now might be a good time to mention some of them because I think that they get at some other kind of reasons to migrate. Still kind of relating to gas efficiency and shelling point.
01:13:18.154 - 01:13:47.030, Speaker A: But I'd say that maybe in no particular order. One interesting. So one we support Native ETH pools again. So v one had Native ETH. Every token was paired against native ETH. So maybe a context for, I guess, bankless listeners who don't know. There's Wrapped ETH, which is ETH that is represented as an ERC 20 token, and then there's Native ETH, which is like the native token to the network.
01:13:47.030 - 01:14:33.406, Speaker A: And transferring Native ETH is about half the gas cost of transferring Wrapped ETH, but it can't be used in certain smart contract patterns, sort of in the name of kind of like code simplicity. We moved to only Wrapped ETH pools because it allowed you to treat ETH and Wrapped ETH exactly. It allowed you to treat ETH as an ERT 20 token. And you didn't need like a whole separate code base for that, but with Uniswap Before, we're bringing back Native ETH pools, which do provide significant gas savings for transactions that are buying and selling ETH. So that's one benefit. Another Benefit is another kind of interesting Feature that is kind of like I'd Say, cute. It's not like, game changing.
01:14:33.406 - 01:15:37.730, Speaker A: But interesting is we've kind of taken the flash accounting stuff I talked about, right, which is like, oh, I kind of can do a whole bunch of things, and I only transfer some amount of tokens in, some amount out, and everything that happens in the middle can sort of be reconciled with uniswap v four. That was almost allowed because you actually don't even need to transfer Tokens in or out sometimes. And What I mean by that is that if you buy a Token and your only intention is to sell it in the future, there's no reason to actually transfer that token back to your wallet. If you Want, you can actually just leave it in the so the same Way that pools are separated out by internal Accounting, you can actually leave your Tokens you Buy inside the Uniswap Singleton Contract and sell them later. And if you do that, then you actually don't need to pay the gas cost of transferring them out of the Singleton contract. There's still some cost of updating the internal Balances, but it's Lower. So there's sort of like a nice little benefit there where if you're buying a Token only to sell It, you can actually have additional gas savings.
01:15:37.730 - 01:16:34.700, Speaker A: There's a bunch of these features, and actually, when you add them up, if you imagine a native ETH pool and you remove the oracle and you have maybe you even buy a token with ETH, and then you sell it later for ETH, and you never take that out of the pool. You could imagine that across all of that there's, like, really significant It's possible you could have a contract that has no hooks, removes the Oracle, actually So it's actually less features than V Three. And using Native Ethan, you Actually have very significant gas savings. We don't have, like Actual I'm not going to say any numbers because we don't have any gas benchmarks and not all this is or maybe we have some, but they're still kind of like the code base hasn't even been frozen yet, so we're not ready to be hyping up gas Numbers. But the general point Being, like, there's actually very significant gas savings to be had here for certain use Cases. And So That Also could be a Reason to move liquidity, because lower gas for swappers means more trading volume, means more fees for liquidity providers. And So that could be another Reason.
01:16:35.150 - 01:17:44.334, Speaker C: I Think, why this Feature, I Think, is unique, even though it's small, but it's big at the same time, the Idea of you can actually leave funds inside of the Uniswap contract, it really emulates a centralized exchange, but in DeFi with all the DeFi values, right? And so in the same way I can send my USDC or my Ether to Coinbase, I can now send my Ether and USDC to the Uniswap contracts, DeFi contracts, and they can exist inside of the limbo state of Uniswap. And then if I'm a trader, I can do a bunch of trades and then I can withdraw my crypto assets later. And the cool thing about this is that it's DeFi. There's no central custodian, it's all protocols, it's all smart contracts. There's no one I'm trusting with my funds except for the contracts themselves, except now it's on chain. And so this makes to me, for traders, I would actually be primarily very interested in this because of the gas savings. I'm sure one of the big reasons why people still host their money on centralized exchanges, leaving it up to the trust of humans that run these exchanges, is because of the UX and fees that are reduced in the centralized exchange world.
01:17:44.334 - 01:18:09.480, Speaker C: But if you are able just to leave your money inside of Uniswap, be charged much reduced gas fees and have those assets ready to trade on a moment's notice. Like the UX of a centralized exchange would give you. This starts to make Uniswap very competitive with centralized exchanges on a vector that it has never actually been able to compete before. So it's a small thing, but I'm wondering if it's actually quite a big thing. I'm wondering your perspective on that.
01:18:10.090 - 01:18:54.742, Speaker A: The reason that I'm not making it like a massive thing is because it's still on a relative basis, it's relatively cheaper, but it's not like centralized exchanges is like no, it's just like a spreadsheet, right? So there's no gas cost to transactions except for depositing and withdrawing. Here there are, it's just we're trying to reduce them as much as humanly possible. We're trying to reduce the costs of using DeFi and using decentralized exchanges by finding every gas optimization we can. And this is one of them. And so I think the net result of all of these changes is that it is possible to have, we hope, for very significant gas savings. All said and done. But I don't want to promise like centralized exchange level scale in because there's sort of like no gas costs at all there.
01:18:54.796 - 01:19:33.220, Speaker B: Hayden when you add all these things up, all of the features that we've talked about today and hooks being maybe kind of the bright shiny object and one of the most interesting things out of this conversation order of magnitude level, how big is this change? Is this like the difference between V one and V two or V two and V three or V three? How big is this compared to previous Uniswap version releases? And you guys have decided to call this four rather than a three five or some kind of point release? How big is this in the scheme of things.
01:19:35.110 - 01:20:34.338, Speaker A: I think that kind of on its own with if you ignore all the hooks that are going to be built, it's only so much better. Right? All the other changes are somewhat marginal. But when you imagine but five years from now, when everything that's been built on hooks, my hope and expectation is that it is a V two to V three style leap more so than like, a V one to V two. Although I think that each version of uniswap has been legendary in its own right. And I think that the reason that we think this should be called V Four is because we think this is like a real massive step forward. I don't know how to put multiples on it, but I'm kind of feeling the Ten X extremely excited about uniswap V Four. I think it has just so much potential, and it's such a powerful developer platform, even for innovation and building on top of liquidity layer.
01:20:34.338 - 01:20:36.054, Speaker A: So I don't know, I'm extremely another.
01:20:36.092 - 01:20:41.050, Speaker B: Ten X gets us to 15 trillion, I might point out. So that would be quite sizable.
01:20:41.870 - 01:21:08.062, Speaker C: Well, I think the reason why this can be measured as a very big deal is that it seems to be an update that allows uniswap pools to continue to update without needing another V Five. And so we can have improvements to the Uniswap protocol naturally or smoothly emergently without ever having to actually make a uniswap V Five, because now this can come in via hooks. So we're done.
01:21:08.196 - 01:21:10.290, Speaker B: We found the end of the roadmap then.
01:21:10.440 - 01:21:26.710, Speaker C: Well, that's what I said about V three, and then we got V Four. So I don't know if Hayden's ready to make that promise, but it does seem to be like, hey, first we had analog cars running on combustion engines, and then we got electric cars that had over the air software updates. And this kind of feels like a transition to that.
01:21:26.860 - 01:21:50.880, Speaker A: Yeah. For what it's worth, v one and V Two each lasted a year. V three lasted two years. And so maybe this one lasts like three years, right? Hard to say. I don't have a ten X. Well, I say that, look, we have ideas for where things could continue to iterate in the future. I think that probably this is like a huge step forward in the next one.
01:21:50.880 - 01:22:14.194, Speaker A: I think future ones have to be more like if there are future Ten X's or whatever, they're probably more tightly coupled to layer two, kind of roll up the sort of like, ethereum roadmap and how blockchains scale in the future, if that makes sense. But this feels like a really obvious huge win. And next step that we're incredibly excited.
01:22:14.242 - 01:23:02.882, Speaker B: About is very exciting. And I think Bankless listeners will definitely be excited about this. And as we draw to a close, hayden, I want to ask you the question about kind of zooming out. So we've been in bear markets before. I think Uniswap very famously was born in one of the worst bear market that Ethereum has ever seen. That is the 2018 19 bear market when Ethereum certainly was dead and everyone thought crypto was dead. What's going on with DFI these days? I mean, is DFI kind of has it peaked and it's just sort of steady incremental growth from here? Are there any big innovations left? Just zoom out and tell me about the space because Uniswap has been one of the forefather protocols, I would say this entire DeFi movement.
01:23:02.882 - 01:23:08.390, Speaker B: And you've been a huge piece of that, Hayden. So what do you see right now? What is the future for DeFi?
01:23:08.730 - 01:23:48.338, Speaker A: Yeah, so I guess one place I'd start is that to me, it's less about fancy new, shiny new things. I think that at times DeFi has sort of been made about being about these shiny objects. And to me, it's really about doing very simple things better and exposing benefits to users. Uniswap has kind of for the past five years, I've been working on how do we make swapping better? Swapping is like a relative conceptually, a relatively simple thing. Right. I want to convert one token to another and that's sort of what we've been iterating on for five years straight. And there's definitely cool, interesting, complex, financial primitives.
01:23:48.338 - 01:24:45.014, Speaker A: But for me, it's always about doing the simple things better and keeping kind of doing it better until it becomes actually better, until it can provide more tangible benefits in the real world. Right? How do we make it? I think that at times we can talk about like, oh, no one controls it, and that's great, but we also need to make it useful and usable and put it in people's hands and we're kind of like iterating our way to getting there. And so I think that it's really not about the sexy things. It's about just constant progress towards making it cheaper, making it easier to use. Those are like the two cheaper, easier to use, and just constantly kind of pushing on that and pushing on that until we actually get to a system where maybe Uniswap is used. Let's say that I am someone in the US. And I want to send money to let's say someone in the US wants to send money to their family.
01:24:45.014 - 01:25:18.962, Speaker A: In know, ideally, that should be built on DeFi, but DeFi isn't there yet, right? People aren't using it yet for that. And so people eventually have to build applications on top of it that are better. But there's still a lot of like, we're in the super early days and I think that people want it to be in the late days. People want it to be like production use cases where hundreds of millions of people are already using it. But there's a lot of work to get there, right? We're still learning how to scale blockchains, we're still learning how to make AMMS, have only. Been around for five ish years. As a technology, they're just like very new.
01:25:18.962 - 01:25:34.230, Speaker A: And so to me, DeFi is a long game of steadily improving until it becomes useful to more people. And I think it already is useful. Right. There are already initial early adopters and early use cases.
01:25:35.370 - 01:25:59.440, Speaker B: I'm wondering if you think we'll get there though, if your confidence has wavered at all. There was a time where I know you predicted that uniswap and decentralized exchanges would eclipse everything in TradFi that we've seen from a volume perspective, be larger than S P and Nasdaq and all of these things combined. Do you still believe that's the case? Do you think we have a chance?
01:26:00.290 - 01:26:50.602, Speaker A: I wouldn't I wouldn't spend five years working on this that I'm like not even it's like the only thing I want to work on today. So I'm personally still extremely optimistic about DeFi and where it's going. I mean, for me it's funny because people look at the last if you look at the last one year, maybe it's not only in a vacuum, maybe it's easy to be negative. But I think that if you look at where we've come from, even, like, a few years ago, there's just been so much growth in there's been so much exploration of the technology. There's more usage now. Even like post FTX, decentralized exchange market share has gone up relative to centralized exchange significantly. It was sort of recently at like an all time high of decentralized exchange versus centralized exchange volumes.
01:26:50.602 - 01:27:33.520, Speaker A: And so we're starting to see even within crypto, more of a shift towards decentralization. I expect that to continue in terms of TradFi and supplanting that that's like a longer game. And it's really about, I guess to me, I think that there are fundamental advantages of this technology and when we can package them up and expose them to people in a tangible way, I think that they'll sort of kind of by definition win out. But it's not going to happen overnight and it's not going to happen in a few weeks. Right. It's going to take some time. But I do expect kind of a steady there are more people using it now than two years ago.
01:27:33.520 - 01:28:20.650, Speaker A: Many orders magnitude more than even two or three years ago. Right. Personally to me, the long term trajectory is up and we're just like in the early days and that's what it's sort of all about. And so personal confidence hasn't wavered. I do think that maybe to touch on something underneath that though. I do think that when you see things like FTX are discouraging to new people in the space, they are a little bit like I think that people in the space often sort of see or maybe even like Terra. Lud is, like, a better example where it was kind of, like, very obviously shitty to a lot of people maybe, who are kind of diehard early fans of DeFi.
01:28:20.650 - 01:29:35.838, Speaker A: And so I think that it can be tiring to have yourself represented by people often just look at crypto as like a monolithic industry. And I think it can be very hard sometimes on people in the space to sort of have the loudest kind of worst voices in the room, sort of be the ones that people kind of see us all see as representative of our broader industry. Whereas I think that the industry is pretty multifaceted and there's people working on all sorts of things across the entire space, and there's so many incredibly smart, talented people, and sometimes they're getting less attention than people who spend hundreds of millions of dollars on stadium sponsorships, but they're real and they're happening. I always try to encourage nuance in these discussions. I totally sympathize with people who look at crypto and like, wow, it seems like a scammy industry because you see these very high profile scams that have happened. But to me, it's all about that fundamental underlying progress towards better technology and a better financial system. And to me, that is still progressing and improving and kind of like on the right trajectory.
01:29:36.014 - 01:29:59.100, Speaker B: The trajectory, of course, is DeFi eating TradFi, DeFi eating the world. And that's certainly what you are building. And the Uniswap team is kind of building with this next release. And we'll know we're close when Nasdaq and the SP and all the large exchanges of the world start building hooks on top of Uniswap V Four. Hayden, it's been a pleasure to have you on Bankless. Thank you so much for joining us.
01:29:59.710 - 01:30:01.574, Speaker A: Thank you so much for having me. It's been a pleasure.
01:30:01.622 - 01:30:20.660, Speaker B: Hayden, as we get to action steps here, I know you've got a blog post, White Paper Code Base. We'll include links to that in the show notes. There are any other big action items that folks can take to kind of get involved and start doing things, maybe even starting to build hooks. Is it too early for that?
01:30:22.630 - 01:31:14.222, Speaker A: It's too early. If you want a guarantee that there will be no changes, right. The code base is not frozen, has not been audited, has not been finalized. And so if you are like, I just can't wait to get my hands and I just want to experiment with it conceptually, then go for it. If you want a kind of more finished platform to build on, then maybe wait a little bit, maybe wait a few months. One thing I'll add is that if you think that you have what it takes to get some code into the core Uniswap V Four code base, we have contributor guidelines in the GitHub. I don't think that it's obviously still, like a pretty complex code base and isn't necessarily for super beginners to do, but obviously the space has so many incredibly smart, talented, smart contract engineers.
01:31:14.222 - 01:31:27.106, Speaker A: And so if you have a gas optimization, if you have a feature request or an improvement, create an issue, work on an issue, by all means, read the contribution guide.
01:31:27.138 - 01:31:34.860, Speaker B: Open invitation there. And of course, we'll also include our previous episode with Hayden in the show notes as well. David, you have an action item too?
01:31:35.630 - 01:31:51.520, Speaker C: Yeah. The actual launch date of Uniswap. V four, I believe. Correct me if I'm wrong, Hayden depends on an EIP being included. So perhaps there are some action items for the Ethereum devs to get included. Is that correct or is there a different launch date for V four?
01:31:52.290 - 01:32:28.538, Speaker A: I think that the benefits of this sort of singleton and flash accounting that we think is really part of our vision for where this goes. Does those benefits increase significantly once this next Ethereum hard fork happens? It's possible to launch a version without it or before it or only on layer two. Is there something like that? But my personal guess is that this will happen post cancun hard fork. That would be my sort of personal thought. On the best timing, I don't know if there's any action items it's kind.
01:32:28.544 - 01:32:33.054, Speaker B: Of already slated for they're going as fast as they can. Okay, David, it's going to happen.
01:32:33.252 - 01:32:36.334, Speaker A: For what's worth, I just want another.
01:32:36.372 - 01:32:38.330, Speaker C: Reason to wait for the cancun hard fork.
01:32:38.490 - 01:32:39.680, Speaker B: Yeah, there you go.
01:32:40.290 - 01:32:52.574, Speaker A: We did do some contribution to 1153 and definitely like, support for it in solidity stuff like that also will be helpful.
01:32:52.702 - 01:33:05.880, Speaker B: There you go. We got some things for action items for everyone. And I guess the main thing is during the bear market, the builders keep building and Uniswap is certainly building. So is ethereum. So is DeFi. Hayden, it's been a pleasure to have you on Bankless. Thanks so much.
01:33:06.650 - 01:33:07.750, Speaker A: Thank you for having me.
01:33:07.820 - 01:33:25.340, Speaker B: Risks and disclaimers Bankless Nation got to let you know, none of this has been financial advice. Not trading advice, not swapping advice, not hooking advice. Crypto is risky. This would you put in? Yes, but we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the Bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
