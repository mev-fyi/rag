00:00:08.170 - 00:00:21.386, Speaker A: Bankless nation. It is the third week of May and it is a Friday morning. That means it's roll up time. And this is dip week, David. Dip week, David. Roll up time, too. Are you excited? Dip week, David.
00:00:21.498 - 00:00:33.718, Speaker B: Also all time high week and dip week all in the same week. Yeah, ether hit its all time high in the Friday after we recorded the last week of the roll up. And then crypto also crashed all in the same week.
00:00:33.884 - 00:00:54.390, Speaker A: Guys, we're going to be talking about all of that. That's going to be in the market section. That's what we do here every Friday morning. We try to cram as much of the week that was crypto into your brain, where we cover markets, releases, news takes, and then we end with what we're excited about, except that we don't end there. We actually end with the meme of the week. So stay tuned for the meme of the week. This comes at you every Friday.
00:00:54.390 - 00:01:04.734, Speaker A: All right, David, before we get in, we got to talk about consensus. Big crypto conference coming right up. People can get their tickets. This is the last chance, though, to get their tickets. David, you're going to be speaking. What are you speaking about?
00:01:04.852 - 00:01:36.422, Speaker B: Ultrasound money on Monday. Still working on my presentation, but it's going to be hot. Ultrasound money gets its debut at consensus, and then I'll also be speaking on a panel about the current state of Defi and of course, how to live a life without banks. So bankless also getting its debut at consensus. Really excited for this particular year of consensus because so many of ethereum things have gone mainstream, as we expected them to for years and years. But now they are finally here. Now they have like the front stage at consensus, Defi, nfTs.
00:01:36.422 - 00:01:48.366, Speaker B: So much to talk about. Really excited to talk about all those things and listen to the other conversations that are going on. Ray Dalio is going to be there. Michael Saylor is going to be there. Anyone who's, anyone in crypto is going to be there. So you should be there, too.
00:01:48.388 - 00:02:15.110, Speaker A: Awesome. Yes, I'm definitely going to be there. And bankless listeners, you still have a chance, I think, two more days from today to get your ticket $20 off with the bankless codes. Make sure you do that. There's a link in the show notes, David. Also, this is no longer an opportunity. The bankless dow that is issued an awesome shirt and this is based on our April Fool's Day joke where we said, like, bankless was getting acquired by Wells Fargo.
00:02:15.110 - 00:02:28.374, Speaker A: That'll never happen. Right? And anyway, the bankless Dow created community created this fantastic shirt to commemorate that. It's the first, I think, in a future apparel line. It's all sold out now. That was a limited edition sale.
00:02:28.422 - 00:02:29.642, Speaker B: I think you got one.
00:02:29.776 - 00:02:45.742, Speaker A: Yeah. From what I've heard, hundreds of sales there, it went really well. So the thing to do, guys, is, next time, don't miss out on this. Go to cryptoculture substack.com. Sign up. Get your email address there. That's where the drops will be dropped.
00:02:45.742 - 00:02:55.442, Speaker A: So you are first to know, I think future drops, David, might have a set amount sell out, might be time limited, but it might be also number.
00:02:55.496 - 00:03:30.586, Speaker B: Limited, like scarcity in one form or another. And that is really the through line with bankless apparel is in the non crypto world. The non cryptoculture world, apparel is not scarce. And there is the world of scarce apparel. And just like street wear that some people are into, and we want to emulate that culture. In crypto apparel, there is a through line about fixing fast fashion, like bad garments that just cost $2, and you wear them two times and then you never touch them again. No, we want scarce apparel that you wear for life because it has that premium price tag.
00:03:30.586 - 00:03:56.646, Speaker B: It doesn't fray, it doesn't wear out. It's a dope design done with an intent. The cool thing about this is that we didn't mass produce these shirts and then sell them. We took the orders, and now we are making one shirt per unit of demand. So there's no excess, there's no environmental issues. It's about changing the culture of the world around us, using scarcity and scarcity tools, and also rug pulling the Wells Fargo logo and making it our own.
00:03:56.748 - 00:04:14.586, Speaker A: Oh, that's just exporting cryptoculture. And that's just the fun part. I'm wearing one of these, which is ritual bap design. Only 50 have ever, will ever be made. Really fun, guys. So get in on that. Okay, David, you ready to get in? We got to start with markets this week, and with markets, we have to start with the dip.
00:04:14.586 - 00:04:22.142, Speaker A: But before we get there, let's describe it for folks. Bitcoin. What happened this week in bitcoin price, sir?
00:04:22.276 - 00:04:59.046, Speaker B: Yeah, bitcoin fell from 58,000 of the high of the week all the way down to 36,500 or so at the deepest part of the dip, which is a level that I don't think anyone saw coming. Slight rebound up into the low 40,000 range. But bitcoin has really been having a tough number of weeks. Ryan, if you zoom out all the way until April. Bitcoin has been in this consolidation period, which everyone was hoping would break out from because it's a bull market. You tend to break out in bull markets. But no, it broke down and it's been having a real tough time just overall in the news cycles.
00:04:59.046 - 00:05:07.070, Speaker B: It's the elon just been pounding it, like, environmental issues, blah, blah, blah. China fud. Bitcoin having a really tough time lately.
00:05:07.650 - 00:05:14.750, Speaker A: This is definitely three months low lows. It's not quite year to date lows, but it's getting close, man. Getting really close. Year to date lows.
00:05:15.250 - 00:05:22.578, Speaker B: I do think there's a case to be made that the current risk adjusted return risk profile is really strong with bitcoin right now.
00:05:22.744 - 00:05:35.842, Speaker A: Interesting. We'll get back to that, too. But first, let's talk about what happened in ether, because that went down as well. The price of eth went down after, as you said, we hit all time highs. So tell us about the highs. And then let's go to the lows.
00:05:35.906 - 00:05:56.618, Speaker B: Yeah. Ether hit an all time high of $4,390, which. Wow, really high. And that kind of makes sense as, like, when things are that high, it's easier to go in the down direction. And that's definitely what happened. Again, no one really expected this level of downness. And that's really the through line of the markets this week is like, holy shit.
00:05:56.618 - 00:06:28.966, Speaker B: I kind of thought the only thing that I can remember of a move like this was Black Thursday. In all of my years of crypto has never really seemed to move that much that quickly. And ether went from after it topped out of its tide as $4,300. It came down to $3,700, then went down to $3,500 and held there. It kind of seemed like it was going to make a nice basing pattern, but then the floor just fell out and it went from 3500 all the way down to 2000. No, all the way down to $1,800 on some exchanges. Think about that.
00:06:28.966 - 00:06:32.326, Speaker B: $4,300 down to $1,800.
00:06:32.428 - 00:06:52.974, Speaker A: That is 5% or so really quick, right? 55% drop really quick. I've got some hot takes on that, but I'll reserve that for now. Let's take a look before we get to those takes on the dip. It was dip week, guys. Buy the dip. Maybe we'll talk about that, too. First, let's talk about how the ratio held up.
00:06:52.974 - 00:07:04.994, Speaker A: This is the ETH to bitcoin ratio. It's something David, we've been monitoring since the first part of this year when ETH was really gaining on bitcoin. How did the ratio hold up last week?
00:07:05.112 - 00:07:37.982, Speaker B: Yeah, the ratio peaked out at just over zero eight, which, again, really high. And then historically, when dips happen, the ETH BTC ratio, quote unquote slaughtered, it gets slaughtered consistently every single time. When bitcoin sneezes, Ethereum just gets absolutely wrecked. And to some degree, the ratio did pull back a little bit, but it's still really strong. And that's kind of in sentiment around crypto Twitter right now, is the ratio held up between Ether and bitcoin, which is something to take note of people don't remember.
00:07:38.036 - 00:08:02.986, Speaker A: But another time it held up, David, was 2017, when we saw this kind of action. And I feel like this is maybe a theme when we get into talking about the dip. But so far, dude, 2021 feels like a fractal of 2017. It's playing out very similarly. Definitely 2018. 2019, when bitcoin sneezed, ETh got destroyed. But that was not the case in 2017.
00:08:02.986 - 00:08:07.030, Speaker A: And this is reminding me a bit of 2017. We'll get to that.
00:08:07.100 - 00:08:39.490, Speaker B: I've been kind of thinking about what it means to go a full cycle. And I got into crypto and Ethereum after Ethereum pumped all the way up from like $10 up to $430, and that was crazy. And that's when I started paying attention to it. And then after Ethereum or Ether hit $430, it crashed down to $135. And that's the moment that I got in. And this feels like a fractal of that. Now, I know a lot of my friends who have just gotten into ether in this brief moment of time.
00:08:39.490 - 00:08:53.430, Speaker B: And so a lot of my friends are just now getting into Ethereum. And price is a great marketing tool. And it feels like that time when ether ran up to $430 off of the insane floor of like ten dollars to twenty dollars and then fell down to $130.
00:08:53.500 - 00:09:06.986, Speaker A: Oh, dude, that's exactly it. Look, and the numbers are similar, too. I remember those days. This is why I feel like this is like 2017, right? So that was 66% off of all time high. And I remember that drop, David. It was like 420. The memes were about 420.
00:09:06.986 - 00:09:32.274, Speaker A: EtH priced 420, and then all the way to 130. It was like mass panic. Bull markets over ETH was a bubble this whole time. The entire platform is worth nothing. Like I told you guys, all of this talk, and it happened very rapidly. Like in this move, it was like in the flash of a day, two days, all of a sudden, 66% drop feels very much like that, right now. All right, David, let's take a look at this chart, because I think this really nails it home.
00:09:32.274 - 00:09:40.550, Speaker A: This is one ugly looking chart, or at least one strange looking chart. Green candle up, spike. Green candle down, spike. What are we looking at here?
00:09:40.620 - 00:09:55.482, Speaker B: Yeah, this is the weekly chart. So each candle is one week for the eth dollar price. And there's a famous line both in markets, but especially in crypto, where stairs up or escalator up, but elevator down. Right. And so markets climb a wall.
00:09:55.536 - 00:09:56.330, Speaker A: I love that.
00:09:56.480 - 00:10:21.278, Speaker B: Right. And so we were all super euphoric when ether hit $4,300, and then just one week later, it spikes all the way back down and retraces 1234-5678 weekly. Candles are erased in two weeks. Right. And so this is a lesson in a. Just being in Zen about this, because this is going to happen. Pain comes in markets.
00:10:21.278 - 00:10:42.886, Speaker B: If you feel pain, it's just inevitability. And so this is also a lesson in leverage. If you were on leverage and you got liquidated. I'm sorry, that's the pain. It's a lesson to be learned if you didn't get liquidated. Good job. And the take here is that perhaps as crypto becomes more mainstream, we always thought the markets were becoming less volatile.
00:10:42.886 - 00:10:47.450, Speaker B: Perhaps as these markets become bigger, the volatility actually gets bigger.
00:10:48.750 - 00:11:11.010, Speaker A: Yeah, I still think volatility is going down over the long term if you cycle all the way out a little bit. But, yes, absolutely. We're not over the volatility days. And I actually think volatility is a feature, not a bug at some level. Right. So people are so afraid of volatility, but you only have to worry about volatility. Holders don't have to worry about volatility.
00:11:11.010 - 00:11:37.642, Speaker A: I'm holding eth. Yeah, traders do. The holders don't. The market gets. And I feel like the news cycle, David gets all hung up on crypto's volatility, and they think that volatility is like a proxy for. Right, but like, the fiat markets are a lot less volatile, but I think they have a massive, whole lot more tail risk here in fiat markets. Right.
00:11:37.642 - 00:12:02.754, Speaker A: So it's almost a more honest market, if you will. Right. Like, there aren't people tinkering with the dials, and so you get this craziness and, of course, less liquidity, too, at these earlier phases. But let's talk about, everyone's asking what happened. Right. So when something like this happens, you get a big drop. Everyone wants to know what was the cause of this.
00:12:02.754 - 00:12:25.654, Speaker A: So we have to talk about this. What was the cause of this? Here is a trader's perspective. This is Dylan Leclaire had a great tweet thread about it. Let's go through some of these. David. So first off, Dylan says bull market corrections on the general of 25% to 30% are completely normal and expected. This has happened in all previous bull runs.
00:12:25.654 - 00:12:49.294, Speaker A: That's his first point. His second point, he talks about Elon Musk here throwing a Molotov cocktail into the mix here. Also, Elon Musk talking about energy consumption of bitcoin. So that's one other possible explanation for it. Where else does this thread take us in terms of Dylan's explanations for this downturn?
00:12:49.342 - 00:13:36.610, Speaker B: David yeah, he looks at some Utxo analysis where who is sending bitcoins? This is a bitcoin focused trader who is sending bitcoins and at what prices? And he draws the connection that you can do this thing called the spent output profit loss ratio. I'm not familiar on this metric, but the conclusion he comes to is that there was a ton of leverage in the system. It's all about leverage. And this is where these normal 20% to 30% drawbacks, which are healthy, turn into violent, immediate, cascading, quick drawbacks. And so he goes on his next tweet, Ryan, here's what he says. Following the 64,000 all time high, the market started to sell off. During the sell offs, funding flips negative, which means that you are actually incentivized.
00:13:36.610 - 00:13:56.422, Speaker B: I think this is right. Correct me if I'm wrong, listeners. I guess when funding flips negative, you are actually paid to go long. And so each time, traders quickly leverage back up. So, like, bitcoin hit 64,000, it dipped down to 55,000. And people are like, there's the dip. I'm going to buy it and I'm going to leverage up.
00:13:56.422 - 00:14:43.906, Speaker B: And so the leverage never got flushed out of the system. Right. Underwater, longs kept adding to their leverage. Right. Every dip, they added more to their leverage. And at some point, this guy claims that on the next tweet that a bunch of whales saw this, opportunistic whales saw this and deposited into exchanges and began relentlessly spot selling, knowing that how many leverage traders were going to, they were going to forcibly make them underwater and forcibly liquidate them, right? And so in theory, whales looked at how much leverage was in the system, and they're like, if we dump the market, we can buy discounted bitcoins, right? And so that's the conspiracy, is that there was way too much leverage that was identifiable. Very much like the GME debacle.
00:14:43.906 - 00:15:02.666, Speaker B: Right. Like, people just notice how much short position there was, and so they bought a bunch of GME, and then all of a sudden, we had the squeeze. This is the same exact thing, but in the inverse. Right. And so now there's a ton of leverage that's flushed out from the system. If you get liquidated, your leverage goes to zero. And that's what happened to a lot of people.
00:15:02.666 - 00:15:11.680, Speaker B: We had $27 billion of open interest at the, I believe, the $64,000 mark, and now we got that cut in more than half.
00:15:12.530 - 00:15:39.826, Speaker A: The trader finishes by saying, this is nothing and should be treated as a huge buying opportunity. I feel like that's a great trader's explanation of what happened. It's just like there was so much leverage in the market downturn, caused cascading downturn because of leverage. The leverage was flushed. Right. And it has to happen periodically as part of a bull run, which is why you've seen this pattern in other bull runs. You know what's also interesting, David? That's kind of the trader's take of why this happened.
00:15:39.826 - 00:16:03.790, Speaker A: But, of course, crypto media and the narrative side of crypto wants to take, too. Here were, I guess, a few popular takes, I heard, for why this happened. One, routers. China banned bitcoin. Routers reported that China banned bitcoin. I don't know if you saw this circulating, but it was, in fact, not the case. China did not ban this.
00:16:03.790 - 00:16:09.120, Speaker A: I don't know how many times this has happened for real.
00:16:09.990 - 00:16:13.746, Speaker B: It's like, honestly a ceremony at this point. It's like, oh, we got to try it next week.
00:16:13.848 - 00:16:32.678, Speaker A: Yeah, it's going to happen. It's going to happen every three months or so, just like clockwork. Elon Musk tweets his tweet that Tesla was dumping 1.5 billion bitcoin stash. Of course, Tesla was not dumping the bitcoin stash, although Elon's pretty erratic these days.
00:16:32.764 - 00:16:33.310, Speaker B: Very erratic.
00:16:33.330 - 00:16:49.390, Speaker A: In his tweets about cryptocurrency, which we'll get to. Okay, so some people said that was the cause. It was Elon's fault over leverage, which we talked about. Other people said it was tether. So Tether published a breakdown of its reserves. Not super cash centric. I don't know if you saw that, David.
00:16:51.410 - 00:16:53.982, Speaker B: Also, very little ceremonious Fud. We always get.
00:16:54.036 - 00:17:02.386, Speaker A: Yes, yes. Also, tether's compilation is like, when you buy a tether, you're definitely not buying a dollar in the bank account, you're buying a lot of other things, but.
00:17:02.408 - 00:17:05.050, Speaker B: It'S redeemability of a dollar.
00:17:05.150 - 00:17:19.210, Speaker A: Yeah. Plus, like treasuries and bonds and all sorts of things. Anyway, separate discussion. That was a reason given. Also broader macroeconomic trends, inflation warnings. Right. Was a reason.
00:17:19.210 - 00:17:48.622, Speaker A: Okay. Maybe that's led, like, correlation with stocks. Maybe that's led to the growing fear and uncertainty. Investors are getting skittish. All of these things are given as explanations, but I almost feel like they're always, like, narratives that sort of retrofit the data, and I'm not convinced by any of them. Right. I just think, like, in bull markets, this sort of thing is going to happen, and then people will look back after it happens and be like, oh, here were the causes.
00:17:48.622 - 00:17:54.066, Speaker A: Very clearly, it doesn't actually have to have a cause. It could have been anything that happened.
00:17:54.248 - 00:18:17.478, Speaker B: I think holistically we can say like, oh, yeah, all of those things. Overall, it just made everyone just really down. Like our hero Elon turned against us. People are just down about this tether fud like china. Maybe it made people pessimistic, right. Holistically, not really any one of these things, but overall, people just like, oh, there's so much to fight. This energy debate is relentless.
00:18:17.478 - 00:18:29.278, Speaker B: Nick Carter is getting swarmed. And then also at the same time, we have these over leveraged traders in Wales, which really just lights the dynamite that I feel like is a more rational explanation for sure.
00:18:29.364 - 00:19:01.786, Speaker A: And I guess I feel like you could swap this set of headlines out with any other set of headlines in a given week or two weeks in crypto, and it would be the same. Like the net of this, David, is. I feel like a reckoning was needed. A reckoning people needed to get wrecked after this bull run. It had to happen and dips happen. I tweeted this out, David, right? So people are stunned by the drop, the sudden drop, right? And I get that.
00:19:01.808 - 00:19:03.386, Speaker B: But also feel it.
00:19:03.408 - 00:19:38.934, Speaker A: We feel it, we feel it, we feel it. But also, guys, zoom out, right? So the prices that you just quoted, right, ether all the way down to 1800, it was 1845 days ago. Like, just 45 days. We only lost 45 days at the lowest of the low. Now ETh is recovering a bit, but like, oh, my God, man, if you bought 45 days ago, you wouldn't have lost anything on ETh. Let's zoom out a little bit and realize how much this asset class has been growing. Right.
00:19:38.934 - 00:19:53.146, Speaker A: Rather than focus on the dips. It is true. When in doubt, zoom out. You have to zoom out and realize that we're sitting at a price right now, that we were, like, 30 days ago. Less than 30 days and as low. As low. It was only 45 days ago.
00:19:53.146 - 00:20:16.174, Speaker A: From a price perspective, there's a tweet response on my response that just made the point that, David, you and I were talking about that the same thing happened in 2017 from the 420 mark to the 150 mark. So dips are going to happen. It could have been anything. I feel like this is just destined to happen at this point in the cycle. Yeah.
00:20:16.212 - 00:20:24.340, Speaker B: And again, this feels like the marker of the second half of the bull market. That's what it was in 2017. I feel like that's what this is now.
00:20:25.110 - 00:20:43.994, Speaker A: Good. Take springtime. It's funny, it kind of happened around the same time in 2017 as well. Let's go to Raul Paul. I thought this was interesting, too. So Raul Paul does a chart comparison. The first is bitcoin now versus 2013, where he's comparing the two.
00:20:43.994 - 00:20:47.270, Speaker A: And in white, you see current price of bitcoin.
00:20:47.350 - 00:20:47.786, Speaker B: Right.
00:20:47.888 - 00:20:56.766, Speaker A: In this navy color, you see bitcoin price, 2010, 2017. The lines kind of line up.
00:20:56.868 - 00:20:59.502, Speaker B: Yeah. Chaotically line up. Yeah.
00:20:59.556 - 00:21:04.800, Speaker A: Totally fractally line up. Let's go to.
00:21:06.690 - 00:21:22.162, Speaker B: BTC now. Right, perfect. And this is exactly what we're just talking about, the dips, almost. Yeah, exactly what you just said. Seasonality is actually the same. The dip amount is pretty similar. I guess this is just the ceremonious.
00:21:22.162 - 00:21:32.058, Speaker B: Halfway through the bull market, whales are getting more bullish and they have more resources to liquidate markets who are over leveraged. Maybe this is it.
00:21:32.224 - 00:21:39.178, Speaker A: I think he did Eth somewhere, too, in the thread. Someone asked him, hey, do Eth. Here it is.
00:21:39.264 - 00:21:42.102, Speaker B: Yeah. Or ETH now versus BTC in 2017.
00:21:42.246 - 00:21:43.980, Speaker A: Is that what this is? Yeah.
00:21:44.350 - 00:22:04.098, Speaker B: Wow. So ether in the bear market of 2018 to 2019 was lower than BTC in 2017. And right now, it's higher. And I feel like that's just a perfect indicator of just, like, ethereum and Ether's narrative was getting just absolutely slaughtered in the bear market. And now, finally, people are starting to figure out. And so it goes from underperforming to overperforming really quickly. That's interesting.
00:22:04.264 - 00:22:08.290, Speaker A: That is interesting. What's he doing? So he's doing one for ETH.
00:22:10.010 - 00:22:11.366, Speaker B: That was what we just looked at.
00:22:11.468 - 00:22:27.046, Speaker A: Okay. I would love to see, like, EtH now versus ETH in 2017, but I'm sure that's out there anyway, these patterns are all super similar. So there's that. While this chaos was going on, of course, crypto exchanges went down. I think a number of them, David.
00:22:27.238 - 00:22:37.678, Speaker B: I think a record number of them. Coinbase doesn't help. I mean, usually goes down. Binance, us went down, Kraken went down, Gemini went down. Bitstamp went down. That's all of the exchanges. That's all of them.
00:22:37.678 - 00:22:38.622, Speaker B: That's every single.
00:22:38.676 - 00:22:41.326, Speaker A: Didn't go down. What didn't go down, David? DFI didn't go down.
00:22:41.428 - 00:22:44.894, Speaker B: DFI did not go down. Ethereum did not go down, 99.
00:22:44.932 - 00:22:46.586, Speaker A: Gas prices went up, though, guys.
00:22:46.708 - 00:22:55.010, Speaker B: Went up. Kind of a proxy of going down. If you can't afford a gas price, is it really up for you? Yeah, it's a bigger conversation.
00:22:55.350 - 00:23:04.998, Speaker A: Yeah. Did not go down, though. All right, David, let's talk a little bit more about what happened in DFI. So total locked in DFI, almost $90.
00:23:05.084 - 00:23:09.400, Speaker B: Billion, and then it got flushed out to below $60 billion.
00:23:10.030 - 00:23:20.186, Speaker A: We were almost celebrating that 100 billion mark, and then all the way down. So that's total locked value in DFI. How did DFI tokens hold up this week? Let's look.
00:23:20.208 - 00:23:26.800, Speaker B: DFI tokens have been doing okay, right? Like Ave still $460, uniswap, $26.
00:23:27.330 - 00:23:28.170, Speaker A: Impressive.
00:23:28.250 - 00:23:40.754, Speaker B: It's pretty impressive, as in like, generally flat. I mean, they definitely took a hit, of course, but as far as things go, DFI tokens didn't really get the run up that Ether got, but also didn't get the slaughtering that ether got either.
00:23:40.952 - 00:23:46.162, Speaker A: That's super impressive, actually. I didn't realize DFI tokens held up. They did okay this week.
00:23:46.216 - 00:23:47.880, Speaker B: They did okay. DFI did okay.
00:23:48.570 - 00:23:50.774, Speaker A: Let's take a look at this and look.
00:23:50.812 - 00:23:58.954, Speaker B: Yeah, look at it. DPI versus ether, again, called the bottom last week a little bit. So roughly ten days ago, called the bottom of zero.
00:23:59.152 - 00:24:00.154, Speaker A: You did, sir.
00:24:00.272 - 00:24:12.970, Speaker B: ETH per Dpi, we are at the level of zero. We almost got up to 00:16, but yeah, eth versus Dpi, bottom. Still in patting myself on the back, maybe I'll become a trader.
00:24:13.810 - 00:24:26.066, Speaker A: That's actually impressive, David, because I actually would have predicted that DPi would have gotten slaughtered relative to this, in this, and that didn't happen. So maybe that bottom will hold, sir.
00:24:26.248 - 00:24:27.300, Speaker B: I think so.
00:24:28.230 - 00:24:49.894, Speaker A: I like this chart, too. This is from, this is good alternative me. It's the fear and greed index. I think they measure this based on various social media sentiment, other sentiment scores. But right now, we are on the extreme fear side of the spectrum. I think the other side of the spectrum is like jubilance, exuberance, rational exuberance. Right.
00:24:50.012 - 00:24:56.870, Speaker B: We are now Shibu tokens are going bajillion X's last week. And then also Eth maxis are gloating about the ratio.
00:24:57.030 - 00:24:59.050, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Wait, who does that?
00:24:59.120 - 00:25:00.298, Speaker B: No one does that. No one does that.
00:25:00.304 - 00:25:25.630, Speaker A: No one does that. But let's say hypothetically, they did gloat about the ratio. They would do that in the exuberant phase. They would not do that in the extreme fear phase. And now we are in extreme fear phase. I'm reminded of this Warren Buffett quote where he says, be greedy when others are fearful and be fearful when others are working out for you. When you dial into the extreme fear phase, when we're over there, that's when you got to be greedy.
00:25:25.710 - 00:25:26.290, Speaker B: Right?
00:25:26.440 - 00:25:34.722, Speaker A: When we're in exuberance, that's when you feel like your lizard brain tells you. It's like, oh, my God, it's going up. It won't stop going up. I got leverage.
00:25:34.786 - 00:25:36.754, Speaker B: I got to leverage. I got to get more fomo. Fomo.
00:25:36.802 - 00:25:59.822, Speaker A: Fomo. Worse, right? That's worse. When you lever up to even get, like, increase those gains, that's when you should be fearful. You should look around and be scared. But right now, we swung into the extreme fear, and I think that investing adage, Buffett's investing adage holds up. You got to be greedy during those times. I will say one thing back to your comment, David, earlier about the.
00:25:59.822 - 00:26:20.954, Speaker A: The thing that gives you confidence during the extreme fear times, like, confidence to be greedy. Like, the ability to be greedy is if you don't have margin. It's a lot harder to be greedy when you have margin. Like, during that times of extreme fear, because you're just like, you're feeling flushed.
00:26:21.022 - 00:26:22.818, Speaker B: You're flushed. Yeah, you got nothing on the verge.
00:26:22.834 - 00:26:38.778, Speaker A: There's no dry powder. Exactly. So how do you be greedy when others are fearful? It's no leverage, fam. If you want to do that, have the dry powder ready. Don't overinvest long term time horizons. All of these things are important.
00:26:38.944 - 00:26:57.102, Speaker B: I think it's also a practice in mindfulness. If you can be zen about the dip and be like, yay, I get to deploy capital. Everyone else is scared. I'm scared, too, and I'm buying anyways. That's a practice in mindfulness. And that's how you survive long term in crypto.
00:26:57.246 - 00:27:14.120, Speaker A: Position yourself to do that. You have to position yourself to do that, too. This is a good take from Hasu, man. He might be more EIP 15 five nine bullish than we are. David and that podcast. Guys, if you haven't listened to podcasts we had with Hasu on EIP 15 five nine. Go listen to it.
00:27:14.120 - 00:27:21.130, Speaker A: But he did a thought experiment. Imagine if EIP 15 five nine was live today. David, what did he say here?
00:27:21.280 - 00:28:04.834, Speaker B: Every single block mined during this big dip had 30 Eth in fees or more. That was the basal level of ETH fees per block during this crazy volatility times all of that would be burned and retroactively paid like via buyback and burn to ether holders. Like 30 ETh just deleted every like 12 seconds, by the way, because that's how fast Ethereum blocks 30 ETH paid every 12 seconds. I don't know what that is annualized, but it's a really big number. And then of course, if proof of stake goes well, stakers receive all of the extras fees, right? One day fees of $80 billion. 80 million. Excuse me, I bet you it was over 100 yesterday.
00:28:04.834 - 00:28:21.754, Speaker B: I forgot to check it yesterday. But I'm sure $80 million of revenue per day. Think of Ethereum as a business. 80 million of dollars per day in revenue with no overhead. That's a profitable business that you want exposure to. And ether is how you do that, dude.
00:28:21.802 - 00:28:49.270, Speaker A: Also, look at Uniswap. I was paying attention to Ethereum all week on fee revenue, but look at Uniswap, man, 10 million in fees. Sushi swap, 8 million in fees this week. Decentralized exchanges have really hit their stride. And they do best in bull markets. Sorry, in volatile market, whether that's bull or bearish volatility.
00:28:49.690 - 00:29:06.826, Speaker B: Here's a new member on the crypto fees page. It's quickswap, which is the Uniswap fork on Polygon. Polygon, yeah. Uniswap fork on Polygon is the number 1234, fifth, the fifth largest revenue generating application in all of crypto. And it's on an Ethereum l two.
00:29:07.008 - 00:29:18.240, Speaker A: That is markets. Guys, we are going to be back with some hot releases, some news, some takes, of course, meme of the week. Stay tuned for all of this, but first, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:29:18.610 - 00:30:13.530, Speaker B: Ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on Ethereum and just recently released Ave version two, which has a ton of cool new features that makes using Ave even more powerful. With Ave, you can leverage the full power of DFI money, legos, yield and composability all in one application. On Ave, there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield, and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol. If you have deposited collateral. Here you can see me getting a 200 USDC loan against my portfolio of a number of different DFI tokens and ETH. I'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option, but I could choose the stable interest rate option if I wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently. One of Ave's V two features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets, trade them on Uniswap, and then deposit them back into Ave.
00:30:13.530 - 00:30:47.862, Speaker B: Ave does all of this for you, all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them. Check out the power of aave@aave.com that's a a ve.com balancer is Defi's most powerful automated market maker. Typical amms just have two tokens inside of one liquidity pool, which can lead to fractured liquidity across the many pairs. In defi with balancer, you can access the full power of multiple tokens inside of one single amm, which unlocks an entirely new playing field of possibility. This makes Balancer an awesome building block for so many different use cases.
00:30:47.862 - 00:31:44.670, Speaker B: Balancer pools can make asset indexes, but instead of paying fees to portfolio managers, balancer lets you collect fees from traders who use your portfolio for liquidity. Additionally, balancer smart pools can be programmed to have properties that change according to predetermined rules, such as changing the swap fee based on market conditions, or even liquidity bootstrapping pools, which can help you launch and distribute your token with day one liquidity. At bankless, we used a liquidity bootstrapping pool to sell our bap t shirts to much success. Balancer V two brings powerful new features that makes your money work even harder for you. In V two, idle tokens are capable of generating yield in DFI without sacrificing liquidity in the pool. To top things off, Balancer is reimbursing all gas costs with valve rewards, meaning that all your gas costs are returned to your wallet with the balancer governance token, Balancer's mission is to become the primary source of liquidity in DFI by providing the most flexible and powerful platform for asset management and decentralized exchange. Dive into the balancer pools at pools Balancer exchange.
00:31:47.090 - 00:32:15.734, Speaker A: All right guys, we are back with releases. We've got to talk about Uniswap v three. At the start of this v three, released two weeks ago, maybe three weeks ago now, it is already the second largest decentralized exchange on Ethereum trailed only by Uniswap v. One, and it's fast catching up v two. Excuse me. Yes, and it's fast catching up. So at this pace, it might actually surpass uniswap v.
00:32:15.734 - 00:32:20.060, Speaker A: Three or, sorry, v three might surpass v two by the end of this month.
00:32:20.590 - 00:32:21.002, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:32:21.056 - 00:32:22.540, Speaker A: Are you surprised about that?
00:32:23.550 - 00:32:44.766, Speaker B: No, because uniswap v three is straight up a new paradigm in amms, where amms, to begin with, are already a new paradigm. But v three is a new paradigm inside of a new paradigm. And so I like to use the word paradigm. It's also interesting to note that uniswap v two and v three are not uniswap. Right? There is no uniswap. There's uniswap v. One, there's uniswap v.
00:32:44.766 - 00:32:53.758, Speaker B: Two, and now there's uniswap v. Three. These are all different things. They just are under the same brand. Right. And technically, shelling point social consensus around the same token.
00:32:53.934 - 00:32:54.274, Speaker A: Yes.
00:32:54.312 - 00:33:07.586, Speaker B: And everyone expects big things out of v three. And v three has been adopted in very specific niche circumstances. But now people are coming to learn how to use it. The UI is getting better. People are getting more strategic with their liquidity.
00:33:07.778 - 00:33:40.834, Speaker A: Look, man, there was always the chance that it could fail. I remember, because it's such a new. So, like, you know, you hit a grand slam and then is the follow up going to be as good? Kind of reminds me of Apple released the iPhone and then they released the iPad, and analysts were like, what? Yeah, like, is this going to do well? And this kind of felt to me like this. It was definitely a paradigm shift, but also risky. Some level. You're changing the core way uniswap V two worked. You're changing everything about it.
00:33:40.834 - 00:33:46.740, Speaker A: And so it felt risky to me, but it's working and seems to be working really well.
00:33:47.190 - 00:33:49.094, Speaker B: Congrats jobs for the Uniswap team.
00:33:49.212 - 00:33:54.086, Speaker A: Absolutely. Slingshot. Let's talk about that. What is slingshot? David used it this week.
00:33:54.188 - 00:34:08.582, Speaker B: Yeah. Slingshot is a decentralized exchange aggregator on Polygon. So this is a new polygon release. I've traded on it and God damn are the fees. Absolutely awesome. It literally feels like a centralized exchange.
00:34:08.646 - 00:34:14.138, Speaker A: And they're very in, like nonexistent. Right, sorry. Awesome. As in nonexistent fees?
00:34:14.234 - 00:34:27.578, Speaker B: Yes, as in one matic. Which one matic is like $2 right now. And so one matic is basically zero. Call it zero. And also basically instant finality. Right. And so block times are really, really short in polygon.
00:34:27.578 - 00:34:49.494, Speaker B: I think they're like two or 3 seconds and they always gets through on the first block because there's so much extra free real estate. It's a suburb. It's an Ethereum suburb. Right. And so the great thing about polygon and specifically slingshot is like polygon is still relatively new, even though that they have been being adopted very, very fast. There's actually really decent liquidity on polygon, but there can always be more. And that's what slingshot does.
00:34:49.494 - 00:35:02.714, Speaker B: It's a liquidity aggregator, it's a Dex aggregator, much like one inch, much like matcha, but now it's on polygon. And so really just adding liquidity into polygon, making polygon a very hospitable place to live.
00:35:02.912 - 00:35:31.186, Speaker A: That's cool that there's enough liquidity on polygon for a Dex aggregator at this phase. I think we're going to be talking about polygon some more later because it's had a big run up and a big week. Yeah. Coinbase is excited to announce, they say in this tweet, a new Coinbase wallet extension. A wallet extension to more easily and securely connect to apps and Defi on your desktop. David, this sounds like Coinbase is rolling out their version of metamask.
00:35:31.218 - 00:35:54.830, Speaker B: Is that what this, right, yeah, there's people just gotten used to using a browser extension to interact with Defi. And so Coinbase is getting into that game. They already had this metamask or this Coinbase wallet, which I don't think very many people will be familiar with. If you have downloaded what is canonically known as Coinbase. This is not what you have downloaded. This is Coinbase wallet, which is a self custody. You control your own private keys.
00:35:54.830 - 00:36:24.610, Speaker B: Defi enabled wallet with DeFi apps involved. And so you put your own ether there, you put your own tokens there, you pay for your own gas. It's non custodial, non centralized. And so now they are trying to really finally double down on this infrastructure, which they basically had in the back pocket forever now. And finally trying to get that thing integrated into DeFi because they finally know, finally recognizing that DeFi is the place to be. And so hopefully coinbase just expends more and more resources into the coinbase wallet because we could definitely use some diversity of options in DeFi.
00:36:24.770 - 00:37:06.674, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm very excited that metamask has some competition to make them better. And you know, another reason I think Coinbase joined is because metamask is absolutely crushing it on fees, like they are generating real revenue, it seems for a while like, well is metamask going to be sort of a public good? Does it really have a business model? But they incorporated some decentralized exchange aggregation, added a layer of fees on top of that. People are using it for convenience reasons and they're just crushing it in terms of revenue. So Coinbase is like business opportunity. What are we? We're a business, we're a crypto business, so we're going to go where the business opportunities are. And I think that's part of their expansion of the space too, which is cool. Let's talk about this.
00:37:06.674 - 00:37:10.342, Speaker A: David Miso. Miso on Sushiswap. What is this?
00:37:10.476 - 00:37:31.322, Speaker B: Yeah, so this is interesting. This is a really interesting conversation. And this is kind of, I feel like very much in my camp because I came in, into the crypto during the ICO boom. Icos leave like a bad taste in people's mouths just because of what they turned into. But as a primitive, all an ICO was, was a token launch and distribution mechanism mania.
00:37:31.466 - 00:37:32.298, Speaker A: Permissionless.
00:37:32.394 - 00:38:01.314, Speaker B: Permissionless, right. And it was very, like I said, rudimentary, primitive, bare bones. And also too early. We are returning to the concept of good token issuance, or just token issuance at large. So this is basically a rebranded ICO platform. But maybe we should stop, maybe we should leave the term ICO behind. This is a token launch and distribution sale infrastructure platform, and so they have a bunch of different mechanisms to get your token out into the wild.
00:38:01.314 - 00:38:44.942, Speaker B: And so here's. I'll read this from the launch article. Miso is a suite of open source smart contracts created to ease the process of launching a new project on the Sushiswap exchange. Miso aims to drive new capital and trade to the exchange by increasing the attractiveness of Sushiswap as a place for token creators and communities to launch new project tokens. We aim to create a launch pad for both technical and non technical project founders that will allow communities and projects to access all the options they need for a secure and successful deployment to the Sushiswap exchange. Choose from crowd sale, dutch or batch auctions, and as well as how you would like to manage participation. So it's basically a suite of tools built on top of Sushiswap to launch your token.
00:38:44.942 - 00:39:29.698, Speaker B: This is exactly what Binance tried to do with their ieos, which was just an iteration off of icos. I remember consensus how they had the foundry spinoff that didn't really do well, that tried to capitalize on the token issuance, Sushiswap getting back into token bootstrapping tools. And I'm really optimistic about that because while icos were corrupted, that doesn't mean that token issuance and token creation is bad. And I think we could just have more optionality and expressivity with how we launch these things. And now that we kind of as a community are more self regulating. I'm very much bullish on open more permissionless easy launch tools because I remember I wanted to launch my own token back in 2017 because I just wanted to. Why not? And I didn't really have any help to do it.
00:39:29.698 - 00:39:43.798, Speaker B: I had to learn how to code. If this is allowing just random people to just launch their token in ways they see fit, people like Gary Vee who just wants to launch a token doesn't really care about the technicals or any other community member. This is a tool for them that makes me really bullish. Awesome.
00:39:43.884 - 00:40:17.386, Speaker A: Yeah, it's really exciting. And with binance chain or with binance ieos, they sort of got corrupted, right? Like you had to pay binance a fee. They wanted their cut of the process. This is really open permissionless Saki and Miso is not taking an inordinate cut out of this whole process. So it's really different and really accelerates that idea. The other thing that struck me, David, is like, what a perfect project for a pseudo anonymous team to capture, to execute on, right? There are many other teams.
00:40:17.418 - 00:40:18.186, Speaker B: That's a good take.
00:40:18.228 - 00:40:36.902, Speaker A: Wouldn't want to even touch this because of 2017 sec securities type pressures. But where is the Sushi swap team? I don't know. All over the world, outside of jurisdictions. Right? This is a Dow pseudo anonymous project. Great. Launch public infrastructure. More tokens are coming.
00:40:36.902 - 00:40:44.380, Speaker A: Some of these tokens will be terrible. Absolutely terrible, as they were in 2017. But this is a new primitive and mechanism for us to experiment on.
00:40:44.830 - 00:40:52.186, Speaker B: They're also launching with this sake token, so they have their own internal project. And sake is literally, it's a token redeemable for a bottle of sake.
00:40:52.378 - 00:40:52.878, Speaker A: What?
00:40:52.964 - 00:41:14.366, Speaker B: Yeah, right. They've partnered with this very craft sake, I guess you would call it, I don't know what to call it, but very premium sake. And there's only going to be, I think, 800 sake bottles. So don't even think that this is just like a DFI token launch prop platform. Literally launch your token for whatever. We could have launched our Bap tokens with this as well. Literally.
00:41:14.366 - 00:41:32.954, Speaker B: It's up to you to use your imagination to how you want to use this infrastructure. And also it's really bullish for sushi because they help people launch their tokens and naturally, people who launch their tokens on Sushiswap are going to be so inclined to keep their tokens on Sushiswap and keep liquidity there. So it's a really big play by the Sushiswap team.
00:41:33.072 - 00:41:40.054, Speaker A: The last take on this is, remember when Sushiswap was just a fork of uniswap, right? Man, has it evolved.
00:41:40.102 - 00:41:40.554, Speaker B: Right?
00:41:40.672 - 00:42:06.338, Speaker A: Evolved into its own thing, doing a separate direction. Really cool to see the Community build new things around this. All right, David, let's get to the news of the Week. I think there are two big stories of the Week that we need to cover. The first is Erratic Elon. What is Elon Musk doing again to the Crypto Markets? We got to talk about that. And the Second is he doing this theme that we've talked about elsewhere, which is the rise of Polygon.
00:42:06.338 - 00:42:19.014, Speaker A: What does that mean for L2s? What does that mean for side chains like Binance? Smart contract chains? Let's talk about that first, Erratic Elon. Why is Elon picking a fight with.
00:42:19.052 - 00:42:52.494, Speaker B: Picking fights left and right. What's he doing here with Michael Saylor, of all people? Right? So Peter McCormack made this big thread trying to help Elon guide him down the Rabbit Hole of Crypto. And then Elon was like, annoying Maxi threads like this just want to make me ape all my money into Doge. Michael Saylor made a comment, and then Elon Musk made a meme of some Guy looking in the Mirror, pointing at himself in the Reflection, and goes, no, you are a genius. Everyone else is wrong. It's not the Bull market. You really are a genius.
00:42:52.494 - 00:43:18.202, Speaker B: Which is poking Fun at who, you know, bought a bunch of bitcoin, and then bitcoin went up in Price. And so now everyone loves Michael Saylor. He's really just picking fights left and right. Like, we picked a fight with Chainlink. God. And so really has no friends in the crypto space because he picks fights with everyone except doge community, and then goes and chills Doge. Right? Erratic Elon probably contributed to some of this market decline, because, again, it was just demoralizing for everyone.
00:43:18.202 - 00:43:31.902, Speaker B: Like, fuck, Elon. It's just ceaseless. It's endless. Why are you even doing this? It makes no sense. Why are you concerned about bitcoin's energy now? Why didn't you care about it two weeks ago? It's like, God damn it. Just shut up, Elon. Just shut up.
00:43:31.902 - 00:43:33.954, Speaker B: Delete Twitter. But of course he's never going to do it.
00:43:33.992 - 00:44:07.526, Speaker A: Do you know, here's the thing, David. It's like, I don't care. So here's the mistake that I feel like the crypto community made, and I understand, right? Like, when somebody with a lot of clout says something good about an asset, the community wants to put this person on a pedestal. And that's what bitcoiners specifically, but also crypto in general, did with Elon two months ago when he added bitcoin to the balance sheet. Elon loves bitcoin now. He's a supporter. He's our hero.
00:44:07.526 - 00:44:46.402, Speaker A: We put him on this pedestal, right? But now he's turning on them. And we didn't have to put Elon on a pedestal in the beginning. Here's what I feel like, david. It's like billionaires have been last to crypto, except maybe the Gemini or the Winklevoss twins at Gemini, but they've been last to crypto this entire time. It's been the nobodies who've really adopted crypto and understand where the puck has been going, right? Like, very beginning of bitcoin, it was the nobodies, like Ethereum, very beginning. All of the vcs turned down. Ethereum didn't buy any ether in ico.
00:44:46.402 - 00:45:02.862, Speaker A: Very few of them did anyway. And it was the regular people, the crypto natives, who got in first. It was the people. It was the. Like, why are we even taking advice from billionaires? We don't need their clout. Who cares, dude? I don't care what Elon says. I don't care in the slightest what he says.
00:45:02.862 - 00:45:34.854, Speaker A: Has Elon ever used uniswap, has used Aave? Does he know anything about using metamask and non custodial wallets and defi? Right? If the answer to those questions is no, he doesn't really know about crypto yet, in my opinion. Like, okay, here's another Mark Cuban, different situation billionaire. He's gone deep, like he knows what he's doing. In Defi, you can see teaching himself solidity. We had him on the podcast, right? Different story. He's informed. I don't think Elon's takes are informed right now.
00:45:34.854 - 00:45:38.840, Speaker A: Maybe someday they will be. But why do we care so much?
00:45:39.450 - 00:46:12.530, Speaker B: I think there's good reasons as to why we not. Elon Musk is just one man, happens to be the richest man, but he has influence, and so who cares about Elon? But I care about the people that think of him as a leader and are looking to him for information. Right? Because the guy landed a rocket and stuff on Mars. I think he did that he does stuff, right? He does really good stuff. He basically memed electric cars into existence and forcibly changed the entire automotive industry. The guy moves markets. Like, crypto markets aside, he moves market.
00:46:12.600 - 00:46:15.060, Speaker A: He memed it. He memed it. But he also built it.
00:46:16.070 - 00:46:36.842, Speaker B: Right? Yeah. And so while he's just one man, he's got a ton of clout and following. And so it's not just this one guy. It's like, if he legitimizes bitcoin, that's really powerful. If he's delegitimizing bitcoin, uh oh, fuck. Like, a lot of people are going to take what Elon says at face value and be like, well, if Elon doesn't, like, know the guy lands rockets on Mars. Like, who am I to disagree with this man?
00:46:36.976 - 00:47:08.706, Speaker A: So this is why we had this podcast we did with Udi Werthheimer, right? And this was kind of actually, I expected that to be sort of a troll fight back and forth. But Udi actually had some good takes about this. One of his takes was. Yeah, he does. But good take here. One of his takes was like, hey, crypto natives are dramatically underestimating influencer coins. And what is Elon doing is he's propping doge up as an influencer coin.
00:47:08.738 - 00:47:11.302, Speaker B: It's kind of like his coin. Yeah, yeah.
00:47:11.356 - 00:47:30.330, Speaker A: And the market doesn't necessarily care about bitcoin, maximalism, or decentralization. They very much care what Elon buys and what he says. So they're going to go to whatever he says. I don't know. What's your take on that? Do you think we're underplaying in crypto influencer coins? You think they have a huge future here?
00:47:30.480 - 00:47:51.454, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, at the end of the day, crypto needs help going mainstream. Like, we can't do it ourselves. We can try and bootstraps our way into existence, and it'll work, but really slowly. And we all want crypto to be here tomorrow, right? So we do need influencers to come and say, like, oh, yeah, crypto's dope. And Elon Musk is perhaps the world's biggest influencer. And right now he's saying crypto's not dope.
00:47:51.454 - 00:47:55.618, Speaker B: And so we're all like, fuck, yeah, that's that, man.
00:47:55.704 - 00:47:56.414, Speaker A: That's Elon.
00:47:56.462 - 00:47:57.318, Speaker B: Here's my take.
00:47:57.404 - 00:48:02.438, Speaker A: Fuck yeah. There you go. Not a kid friendly show. Not this week.
00:48:02.604 - 00:48:03.270, Speaker B: Sorry.
00:48:03.420 - 00:48:07.870, Speaker A: Let's go to another take. Oh, this is Elon again. I'm skipping. Yeah, we're done with Elon.
00:48:07.970 - 00:48:09.194, Speaker B: So many doges. Yeah.
00:48:09.312 - 00:48:39.438, Speaker A: All right. Another take polygon. Rise of polygon. What does this mean? Sushi swap passed 500 million total locked value on Polygon this week. That's just one. Delphi Digital released a report about Polygon as the swiss army knife of scaling solutions and emphasized how fast it's growing, how well it's doing, how many defi apps have migrated to it. This is what the polygon ecosystem looks like.
00:48:39.438 - 00:48:44.146, Speaker A: We've got to talk about the rise of polygon, David. So what's happening here?
00:48:44.328 - 00:49:06.842, Speaker B: Yeah, so the swiss army knife of l two s is a really interesting take, and my budy Michael Wong, the chief of culture at bankless, made this really good take that there's a reason why Loop ring has had troubles trying to get out the door, and it's because sushi swap can't build on loop ring. Loop ring has to build its own.
00:49:06.896 - 00:49:07.610, Speaker A: Not open.
00:49:07.760 - 00:49:22.080, Speaker B: It's not open. Right. And so sushi swap comes into polygon, just deploys itself on polygon, and like, oh, we take this big project on al one and just, we put it on the polygon, and all of a sudden that makes sense. That makes a lot of sense. Shout out to Michael Wong. Here he is.
00:49:23.090 - 00:49:25.060, Speaker A: Hey, Michael Wong. What are you doing?
00:49:25.430 - 00:49:26.162, Speaker B: Is that real?
00:49:26.216 - 00:49:27.154, Speaker A: Did that just happen?
00:49:27.272 - 00:49:38.786, Speaker B: That really does happen. He's in the back. This gets into a broader conversation as what really polygon is. Right? It's not like a specific l two. It's a swiss army knife of l.
00:49:38.808 - 00:49:43.798, Speaker A: Two s. I got to stop you here. I got to stop you here, though. Okay? Because l two, we've defined this before.
00:49:43.884 - 00:49:44.230, Speaker B: Sure.
00:49:44.300 - 00:50:25.866, Speaker A: L two is secured by an l one. So an l two on ethereum would be secured. The economic security and the underlying asset of the l one of eth and polygon is not quite that it does checkpoint back to ethereum, but it is more like a side chain. At least they have a plasma version, but that's not really what we're talking about here. It's their proof of stake version, which has a set of validators. So it's almost like similar to maybe Cosmos, similar to a more, I guess, distributed version of binance chain, even. It does checkpoint to eth, so there are some differences.
00:50:25.866 - 00:50:34.294, Speaker A: But you were saying L2. Would you amend that? Because it's not really a L2, is it?
00:50:34.412 - 00:51:31.766, Speaker B: Yes, you are technically correct, and that is the correct way to view things. And that's the informed way to view things. I will not amend this because I'm going to put on my first cycler hat and my crypto novice non informed perspective, which is going to be the mainstream perspective, right. So they come onto ethereum and they say like, oh, gas prices, those really suck. How do I get rid of those? Some people got rid of those by going to binance smart chain, and which is a different chain, other people are going to get rid of those by going to polygon. And this is where the question of does decentralization really matter? Can actually, I think, be much more fitting, because the difference between optimism and arbitrum, which are like holistic, complete, uncompromising l two s and polygon, maybe that difference is less. And maybe we are ready to sacrifice decentralization not because we're sacrificing it at the base layer, but we're okay with sacrificing it at the l two layer.
00:51:31.766 - 00:51:53.390, Speaker B: The l two layer. And so to some degree, if polygon is not a true l two, and it's actually just a side chain that checkpoints to ethereum to some degree, if it just works and it's not maximally decentralized in the way that other l two s could be, if it just works and everyone gets their funds back and nothing breaks, that's great. That's fine. Call it a night at that point in time.
00:51:53.460 - 00:52:14.166, Speaker A: Okay, I got to take the other side of this for a second. Would you say the same about chain? Right. Binance chain has had definitely some transaction volume. There are definitely some applications on binance chain that are doing well, definitely lower gas fees. Is there a difference between binance chain and polygon in your mind?
00:52:14.348 - 00:52:26.522, Speaker B: Yes, there's two main differences. One, you have to go through binance to get to binance smart chain. So that is a big change. Like the process of actually moving your funds there actually literally goes through, I think that's true. Literally goes through a centralized service.
00:52:26.576 - 00:52:28.166, Speaker A: Well, let's say there was a bridge.
00:52:28.278 - 00:53:10.934, Speaker B: Yeah, okay, say there is a bridge. One is about the incentive misalignment between binance smart chain and Ethereum, and in stark contrast, the attempted incentive alignment between polygon and Ethereum. The polygon team Mihilo Sandeep, Ethereum bulls want to help Ethereum. They are politically aligned with Ethereum, and polygon is trying to become constructed in a way that's politically aligned to Ethereum on a technical level that's involved with checkpointing to Ethereum. And that kind of removes that centralization vectors over time. Not perfectly, but over time it removes that centralization vectors by checkpointing. But also just there's a conversation of allowing ether to be gas on polygon.
00:53:10.934 - 00:53:52.806, Speaker B: And so there's the Matic token, which you stake to be part of the consensus level two matic, which is what separates matic from Ethereum and makes a division. But what they are considering is using ether as the consumable gas asset. On, and I use this metaphor yesterday when I was talking to Mike. It reminds me of like two kingdoms back in old times. And one kingdom is bigger than the other and one kingdom owns the smaller kingdom and makes the smaller kingdom pay taxes to the bigger kingdom. Ethereum is like, oh, do you want our blessings? You use our money as the native fee payment currency on matic, right? Like you better use our money. And so matic is giving up.
00:53:52.806 - 00:54:29.214, Speaker B: It's like, oh, Ethereum, please, like us. We want you to like us. You know how we will get you to like us? We will use your money as the consumable, transformable asset and we will give up that role of the matic token to ether. The token which just is making a. And so really what matic is doing is optimizing, it's making a hybrid bullish position between matic bulls and ether bulls and trying to blend Matic community and ethereum community. And that's starkly different than binance marchain and some of those things to tie this off. Main difference between Matic and polygon and binance marchain is political alignment with Ethereum.
00:54:29.214 - 00:54:34.900, Speaker B: And as we say, at the end of the day, it all collapses down to layer zero, which is people.
00:54:35.590 - 00:55:24.834, Speaker A: So you're saying even though some of those things haven't happened yet, like ETH being used as a native fee, for instance. And I know by the way, Polygon has other plans to roll out more L2 like solutions, right? So Polygon is kind of a swiss army knife. Proof of stake chain is just one approach. They plan to have kind of a roll up based approach in the future. But what you're saying is those plans, even though they're in the like, because they are socially and politically aligned with Ethereum, then that's why you trust Polygon more than you would binance chain. Whereas like CZ is not socially or politically aligned with Ethereum, he is socially and politically aligned with Binance, the company and BNB token holders. Maybe.
00:55:24.834 - 00:55:49.178, Speaker A: But if that's the case, David, is this you being like, and again, I'm playing devil's advocate, right? I like what's going on, but is this you being tribal about? Are some people would say David's saying polygon good, but binance smart chain bad. Just like there's a contradiction here what would you say to that?
00:55:49.264 - 00:56:27.314, Speaker B: I think the contradiction is not there. And I think Polygon good, binance smart chain bad is that binance is bankers and polygon is attempting to be as aligned with the values and be an extension of the values of Ethereum as possible. I think there's something to say that the absolute insane rise of Matic token over the past month has occurred simultaneously with the rise in ether, the asset, over the last month. People rotating into Matic is a fractal off of people rotating into ether. And it was a political rotation both ways. Right? Like people understanding that ethereum is a place to be. Also, matic is the Binance smart chain killer.
00:56:27.314 - 00:56:34.954, Speaker B: And so while perhaps they are fundamentally constructed similarly, even though checkpointing is actually a very big point about.
00:56:35.072 - 00:56:37.978, Speaker A: There are some differences for sure, I totally agree.
00:56:38.064 - 00:56:56.194, Speaker B: But the difference is that binance smart chain is a banker's chain through and through. And I'm pretty sure consensus is permissioned, whereas consensus is not permissioned with a matic token. And overall they are committed to Ethereum values. And that's really what the through line of polygon is. Very big difference.
00:56:56.312 - 00:57:40.846, Speaker A: The big take here is something that we've, I think, predicted on bankless is actually coming true, that side chains like binance smart chain aren't actually competing against Ethereum. They're competing against other Ethereum side chains or Ethereum's L2. That's what they're really competing against. We've seen this massive rise in Polygon as it's kind of got its feet at the expense of not Ethereum, but at the expense of binance smart chain. Right? Like a lot of that activity is starting to leak over to Polygon and at the expense of finance smart chain. So it's like two L2s, two side chains competing against one another. And Polygon is starting to capture that flow from Ethereum now.
00:57:40.846 - 00:57:57.060, Speaker A: All right, I think we have some takes on polygon a little bit later that we'll get back to, but let's get to some other Ethereum stuff. Speaking of billionaires, Mark Cuban, this dude on Twitter has been stalking Mark Cuban's ETH address, which is kind of cool that you could do that, I think.
00:57:57.670 - 00:58:01.202, Speaker B: Also Mark Cuban didn't really know that you could do that when he first got into Ethereum.
00:58:01.266 - 00:58:13.914, Speaker A: That's true. I think he knows now though, right? Yeah. But what's Mark Cuban doing? Well, maybe he's listening to bankless podcasts. Maybe he's reading the newsletter because he's fooling around with Alchemyx which we're big fans of right after the never sell.
00:58:13.952 - 00:58:16.330, Speaker B: Plan, which had alchemy front and center.
00:58:16.480 - 00:58:26.714, Speaker A: Look at this. He's staking hedge, some advanced defi stuff. 200 meters, dow, vault.
00:58:26.762 - 00:58:27.034, Speaker B: Vault.
00:58:27.082 - 00:58:28.170, Speaker A: Wow, look at that, dude.
00:58:28.250 - 00:58:31.726, Speaker B: Nice. Cool. Good job. Good job. Mark Cuban. Proud of you.
00:58:31.748 - 00:58:33.370, Speaker A: That's how you do it if you're a billionaire.
00:58:33.450 - 00:58:36.258, Speaker B: Sorry for stalking you, but we're going to keep on doing it.
00:58:36.424 - 00:58:54.834, Speaker A: Someone's going to if we don't. All right, let's talk about this, too. Speaking of big money. All right. Ark invest massive fund. They've been primarily bitcoin focused to this point, but it's the fund Chris Berninski came from. They have finally started to purchase.
00:58:54.834 - 00:59:30.014, Speaker A: It is official ETH small increment now 20 million worth. But David, I remember not too long ago we had people on the Bankless podcast who were debating us. Ryan Selkis was debating us about institutions never purchasing ETH, like funds like Arc wouldn't purchase ETh. Companies, wouldn't put it on their balance sheet, wouldn't hold it in their treasury. And now, not less than six months later, it's starting to happen. I feel like Ark is a big move in that space. Now they're not custodying it, they're buying it through Grayscale.
00:59:30.014 - 00:59:34.642, Speaker A: But that's how they purchase bitcoin fine as well. So it's happening, man.
00:59:34.696 - 00:59:42.038, Speaker B: And it's only $20 million. But I mean, the bigger signal is that it's at all right. That's really the new paradigm shift here.
00:59:42.204 - 00:59:46.674, Speaker A: I think it is. We should have Kathy on the podcast. Be good discussion.
00:59:46.802 - 00:59:48.860, Speaker B: Kathy, please come.
00:59:50.110 - 01:00:00.378, Speaker A: EBay opening up its platform to NFT sales. This is like OG web 10 meets crypto. Kind of cool to see.
01:00:00.544 - 01:00:09.150, Speaker B: Slightly disappointing that they didn't pick Ethereum, they picked a wax blockchain, which is a did they wow project. But if they're getting into nfts.
01:00:11.090 - 01:00:11.406, Speaker A: If.
01:00:11.428 - 01:00:16.622, Speaker B: You believe in the protocol sync thesis, you end up at Ethereum. So I'm just happy they're getting into nfts.
01:00:16.766 - 01:00:31.730, Speaker A: There you go. Let's talk about this. This is in bitcoin news, ish. Bitcoin news is. This is crypto news. Blockfi botched some promos with an outsized bitcoin reward payment here. What happened with Blockfi?
01:00:31.810 - 01:00:56.814, Speaker B: Right, so blockfi crypto bank, crypto lending platform like compound or Aave, where you deposit assets and you get yield on them. They pay out USDC payments. Obviously in USDC, something got messed up. And when people hit the withdraw USDC button. Instead of getting USDC withdrawn, they got bitcoin withdrawn. So instead of one USDC, they got one bitcoin. That's a big difference in value.
01:00:56.814 - 01:01:23.142, Speaker B: And so I think some people got two bitcoins. Some people got seven bitcoins. Like, a decent number of bitcoins accidentally got sent out by blockfi. And there was one post on Reddit or on Fortune I saw of one of the recipients of one of these bitcoins, and they were like, not your keys, not your crypto. Like, thanks for the bitcoins, which not recommended. If one of you guys got bitcoins, don't send those bitcoins away like the meat space. Nation state regulation, police are coming after you.
01:01:23.196 - 01:01:24.722, Speaker A: I mean, to get on blockfi.
01:01:24.786 - 01:01:30.134, Speaker B: Those transactions are getting reverted. Yeah, you're right. KYC is on blockfly. They know who you are. You know that.
01:01:30.172 - 01:01:31.254, Speaker A: They know where you live.
01:01:31.372 - 01:01:42.866, Speaker B: Yeah. This is, I think, an interesting example of, just like this is going to get rolled back, not at the protocol level, obviously, but at the meat space level. Those bitcoins are getting sent, like, unless.
01:01:42.918 - 01:01:55.330, Speaker A: You want trouble with the nation state, which you don't. They have your passport on file anyway. Too bad for blockfi on that one. I think it'll get resolved. Just a little snafu there. Let's talk regulation.
01:01:56.550 - 01:01:59.700, Speaker B: The through line here is that protocols don't mess these things up.
01:02:01.430 - 01:02:03.058, Speaker A: Protocols? Yeah.
01:02:03.144 - 01:02:07.490, Speaker B: Ave doesn't accidentally withdraw bitcoin when you requested to withdraw USDC.
01:02:07.650 - 01:02:26.070, Speaker A: That is true. That is true. As long as the code is written. Well, they don't mess this up. All right, so this is part of the China flood, I think, David. So this is regulatory. Three self regulatory organizations within China reiterated a 2017 stance on crypto.
01:02:26.070 - 01:03:06.530, Speaker A: Here's what they said. These are bank regulators in China. Basically, they said that crypto is, here's the quote, severely damaging the people, the safety of people's property, and disrupting financial stability. What's interesting about this is not that this is coming out of China, but I think that this is something that bankers in all nation states will say. The problem with crypto is it's damaging safety of people and it's disrupting financial stability. We're going to hear that reiterated over and over again when nation states and bankers take a negative stance on crypto. So it's coming out of China.
01:03:06.530 - 01:03:08.998, Speaker A: Wouldn't be surprised. We hear it in other jurisdictions, too.
01:03:09.084 - 01:03:21.580, Speaker B: If you hear headlines like that, what you should actually hear is we have all the control. We don't like these things that take away control from us, please. Here's some reasons why you should keep us allowing to have control over your.
01:03:22.430 - 01:03:33.070, Speaker A: That's what's, that's what's really going on. But they'll say they're protecting you. Let's talk about some more banks, David. Bank of America leaned into blockchain to speed settlements. What's the quick take here?
01:03:33.140 - 01:03:47.186, Speaker B: I love leaned into blockchain as if blockchain is a thing. What they actually mean is ethereum. That is actually what's going on. They are actually settling securities on the Ethereum blockchain. So that's pretty cool. Pretty cool. Yeah.
01:03:47.208 - 01:04:01.722, Speaker A: What's cool about this is they partnered with the crypto bank to do it, Paxos to do it. So it's like, I think this is what's going to happen. It's legacy banks. They'll partner with Coinbases, they'll partner with Paxos, and they'll roll out something cool. This might be cool. Security is on chain. We've been promised that for a while.
01:04:01.722 - 01:04:15.474, Speaker A: Maybe they could do something in this space. Let's go to Wells Fargo. Our favorite. Wells Fargo is instituting some onboarding to crypto for clients.
01:04:15.622 - 01:04:32.126, Speaker B: I think they have some bitcoin fund offerings. And the thing is, it's only available to wealthy clients, which is just peak banks. Peak banks. Bitcoin only fund for wealthy. Only Wells Fargo customers. Nice job, Wells Fargo.
01:04:32.238 - 01:04:46.690, Speaker A: 2 trillion in assets, but only for wealthy clients. Like, as if we need Wells Fargo to help us buy crypto. Right? Too slow, too slow. Sorry. Moving on, Wells Fargo. Bye bye. You think they heard about our t shirt, David?
01:04:46.850 - 01:04:52.714, Speaker B: Oh, I'm sure they're sweating. They are just corporate. Wells Fargo is just sweating at the t shirts we had.
01:04:52.912 - 01:05:03.386, Speaker A: Some bad stuff's happening on Binance. Smart chain, by the way. I haven't kept up with all the technicals here, but here's one bad thing. It seems like the network is increasingly unstable. What's going on here?
01:05:03.488 - 01:05:31.654, Speaker B: Yeah, so we have crypto Ultron, who says he runs a BSc node. He says the network is constantly forking uncontrollably for every block that is part of the main chain. There are around five uncles. So five accidental forks going on before the blockchain can find consensus again. Several validators are running subpar hardware and cannot keep up with the rest of the network. This is, first off, just a tweet, so unverified. But we've been covering topics like this of the massive amount of state blow over the last few weeks.
01:05:31.654 - 01:06:00.762, Speaker B: And so this was predictable. And so that's kind of why I feel comfortable talking about this here, even though it's unverified. It's like this is the predictable, logical conclusion of what happens when you just fork Geth and the Ethereum. One client, add 50 million gas instead of 15 million gas and cut block times down from 13 seconds to 2 seconds. Blockchain just grows too fast. And so now everyone is having consensus issues because there's too much data being going around and no one can keep up with things. This is the logical conclusion of the binance smart chain.
01:06:00.762 - 01:06:23.558, Speaker B: It's finally coming to a head. CZ, if you're listening, here's how you fix this. I'm going to tell you how to fix this. Come up with a checkpoint where one single block, that was perhaps yesterday's block is just the new genesis block of binance smart chain. Delete all of the history and go from there. Problem solved. All you have to do is do that every two months and come up with a checkpoint, and then you can keep going.
01:06:23.558 - 01:06:29.586, Speaker B: And every single two months you're going to lose consensus. But you just checkpoint, delete the history and keep going. Problem solved.
01:06:29.698 - 01:06:31.190, Speaker A: Is this defi, sir?
01:06:31.340 - 01:06:33.254, Speaker B: Send me my bet tokens, please.
01:06:33.372 - 01:06:39.260, Speaker A: Yeah, it's funny. The developers of Geth predicted that this would happen. Here it is. It's happening.
01:06:39.790 - 01:06:40.598, Speaker B: Shocker.
01:06:40.694 - 01:06:58.306, Speaker A: Let's see some peak drives. I'm going to start with this one, David. Let's go back and forth. Microstrategy has acquired another 10 million in bitcoin. Another week, another microstrategy dollar cost average in from Michael Saylor. No wonder he is the savior of bitcoin right now. Let's drive by one.
01:06:58.306 - 01:06:59.202, Speaker A: What's this one?
01:06:59.336 - 01:07:33.290, Speaker B: Urine finance sees at the dip and buys back $1.47 million of YFI tokens. Doing the same thing as Michael Saylor. And the funny thing is, they have these same similar announcements about, like, urine bought the know added to the treasury. The other cool take on this is that urine is at the team layer. The team behind urine is now executing on a makerdao style tokenomics value capture mechanism where they're using funds generated by urine to buy back Wi Fi off the secondary market and withhold it from the secondary market. It's a buyback and burn model, just like makerdao.
01:07:33.450 - 01:07:44.066, Speaker A: Cool community there. Let's go to the next one. Alchemy's audit. It finally came. So Alchemyx has been a really cool protocol. But I got to be honest, David, I was sweating it. I don't think I have the tweet up.
01:07:44.066 - 01:08:09.474, Speaker A: But I was sweating it when Alchemyx was getting all of this total locked value locked inside of it, and there hadn't been a completed registered audit. Right now it's come. I think that will give some folks it will help them breathe a sigh of relief. Although an audit does not mean that the thing is unhackable, it is a good sign that they are now audited. What's the next one here, David?
01:08:09.522 - 01:08:31.326, Speaker B: Usually we wouldn't really report on audits, but literally everyone was, like, waiting for the Alchemyx audit. So that's why I reported the next one is $1 billion now stored in Argent wallets. Congratulations to Argent. They have also been innovating at the transaction level, I think pooling transactions together either via mining pools or just other user customers together. I don't know. I was talking to Mike. He knows about it more than me.
01:08:31.326 - 01:08:44.398, Speaker B: But they have some innovations with reducing gas fees out of Argentin, which is always helpful because they're a smart contract wallet. Therefore, gas fees are always higher in smart contract wallets. And then they say, yeah, they end with L2 is on the way. Hashtag ethsummer. I like that hashtag.
01:08:44.574 - 01:08:58.694, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's because maybe it's coming in summer. We'll see. Diversify. $5 million round. Diversify is a DFI exchange. They are built on Starkware's L2. This is a true L2 solution.
01:08:58.694 - 01:09:08.842, Speaker A: They're closing some more funding, which will help them build out their exchange. I love the work that they're doing. Congratulations to that team.
01:09:08.976 - 01:09:33.762, Speaker B: Next up in the funding round, DFI dashboard. Zapper raises $15 million to build on platform App Store. App Store. What are the plans coming from that? Wow, interesting. First off, Zapper is absolutely fantastic. That's where I see just a report of all of my wallets and all my little Djen activities. They also have Polygon interacted with there, and so they also just ship so fast.
01:09:33.762 - 01:09:38.500, Speaker B: So really excited to see what they can do with this $15 million. Excited to see what an App Store is?
01:09:38.950 - 01:09:47.686, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. All right, guys, we are going to come back with some hot takes and of course, the meme of the week. But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
01:09:47.868 - 01:10:23.554, Speaker B: Bankless is proud to be supported by Uniswap. Uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure. Instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans, Uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on Ethereum which is what Ryan and I call a money robot. No human counterparties or centralized intermediaries, just autonomous code on Ethereum. Input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy. Something brand new in the Uniswap ecosystem is the Uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants. We have been saying this for a while, and we'll say it again.
01:10:23.554 - 01:10:51.642, Speaker B: Dows have money and they are in need of labor. If you think that you have something to contribute to the Uniswap Dow, apply for a grant to Uniswap. Just look at the size of the Uniswap treasury. It's almost $3 billion. This mountain of capital is looking for labor. Do you have something of value to contribute to the Uniswap? Dow, no matter how big or small your idea is, you can apply for a unigrant@unigrants.org and help steer uniswap in the direction that you think it should go.
01:10:51.642 - 01:11:29.222, Speaker B: That's exactly what we did to get Uniswap to be a sponsor for bankless, and you can do the same for your project. Thank you Uniswap, for sponsoring bankless Gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange. I've been a customer of Gemini since I first got into crypto in 2017, and it's been my main exchange of choice to make. My crypto buys and sells. Gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide. And on Gemini, there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets, including many of the hot DFI tokens, and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid dye markets. Gemini just launched their earn program, where you can earn up to 7.4%
01:11:29.222 - 01:12:12.786, Speaker B: interest on 26 various crypto assets. If you're tired of paying fees in DFI or you don't want to worry about DFI exploits, but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets, Gemini Earn is the product for you. Another product I'm stoked to get my hands on is the Gemini crypto back credit card, which gives you 3% cash back on all of your purchases, but paid to you in your preferred crypto asset. When I get my Gemini credit card, I'm going to make sure that I get my cash back in ETH, so whenever I buy something, I get a little bit of ETH bonus back to me. At the same time, you can open up a free account in under 3 minutes@gemini.com. Gobankless and if you trade more than $100. Within the first 30 days after sign up, you'll be gifted a free $15 bitcoin bonus.
01:12:12.786 - 01:12:14.806, Speaker B: Check them out@gemini.com.
01:12:14.908 - 01:12:27.706, Speaker A: Gobankless all right, David, let's start with the takes. DFI summer round two, this is Andrew Kang with this take. What is he talking about here? What is defi summer round two? How's it going to be different? Right?
01:12:27.728 - 01:13:10.118, Speaker B: So defi summer round one was all about yield farming, liquidity mine token distributions, events to people that are using these protocols. And so what Andrew Kang is talking about is the game plan for defi summer round two. We're not just going to repeat history because that's not how it works. We're going to rhyme history. And so the way that history rhymes with his upcoming DFI summer round two that he's trying to illustrate is that instead of applications on Ethereum doing yield farming, instead it's going to be l two s doing liquidity, mining incentives, distributing tokens on L two s. That's currently what's going on. On Polygon, you can get matic rewards by depositing liquidity into Ave, you can get matic rewards by depositing liquidity into sushi.
01:13:10.118 - 01:13:35.518, Speaker B: Swap. So many different ways are being subsidized and incentivized by the Polygon team via Maddox token distributions. And so just go use Maddox stuff, you get Maddox rewards. And they got me with this. I put my Maddox, Maddox l two, deposited into Ave, realized that the yields were insane. So I deposited Maddox into one side of Ave, borrowed Maddox from the other side of Ave, redeposited. That just kind of wound up the position.
01:13:35.518 - 01:14:04.982, Speaker B: It's actually not leveraged because my borrowing is denominated in what I'm lending and so that's much more safe. Again, do your own research. Getting a decent amount of Maddox rewards. And now I just find myself with a decent size of my portfolio on the polygon. L two, they got me, they got me with the incentives. I got got. And we're about to have optimism and arbitrum probably, they're probably going to have a token because why the hell wouldn't you have a token? How else are they going to incentivize people to come on board and use their stuff? And they also need to distribute their tokens.
01:14:05.046 - 01:14:13.130, Speaker A: Who's funding these incentives, David? Is it the l two s themselves or is it the l two S plus the protocols? Like, is it like Ave plus?
01:14:13.200 - 01:14:44.582, Speaker B: Right, it works both ways, right. And so the l two s are incentivizing the apps who are and the apps are incentivizing the people. It all works out. And so you thought DfI Summer was crazy with yield farming opportunities. What happens when you add a whole entire new dimension, which is the l two, right? So the DFI summer round two is going to be underpinned by just yield farming out of the actual base layer, the L two itself, not just the application and then also the applications. Right? Absolutely crazy. Really interesting take from Andrew Kang, guys.
01:14:44.636 - 01:15:12.286, Speaker A: I think this is one of those alpha takes. This is one of those opportunities to get ahead of things. Because what Andrew is saying, what David is saying feels absolutely right to me as well. Right. The reason we saw DeFi summer last season was because compound issued a governance token and it worked so well that all of the other DeFi protocols did. By the end of September, Uniswap didn't even have the intent to launch a uni token. This is what Hayden Adams said when we had him on, but did anyway.
01:15:12.286 - 01:15:44.922, Speaker A: Why? Because crypto economic incentives worked so well. Now you've got DeFi protocols who continue to have this incentive to push users to L2s. Plus you have the L2s themselves that are locked in this competitive battle to gain traction, gain liquidity and gain users. So optimism, arbitram, polygon, they're all going to want to incent users and incent liquidity. So token summer, it's about summertime too. I don't know. That feels like a great take and a little bit of alpha for you guys.
01:15:44.922 - 01:16:06.242, Speaker A: Get prepared for the possibility of defi summer round two. Let's go to this next take. David. This was Dave Portnoy, man. This almost got overshadowed by everything else as the market fell. But like, is this the top? Just he introduced what he calls his shitcoin announcement and he got behind this coin called safemoon. Has a whole video about it.
01:16:06.242 - 01:16:10.370, Speaker A: He did kind of funny. Yeah. So you didn't see this?
01:16:10.440 - 01:16:11.634, Speaker B: No, I didn't see this.
01:16:11.752 - 01:16:33.462, Speaker A: Oh my God. Yeah. I must feel conflicted about actually talking about this because it gives more attention to the thing that he wants attention for. But he's basically saying, I am behind Safemoon now. I've bought it. You should buy it too. Jump into my influencer Ponzi scheme.
01:16:33.462 - 01:16:40.090, Speaker A: Right? It's like his version of Elon's dogecoin is safe moon here.
01:16:40.160 - 01:16:49.520, Speaker B: And he put this tweet out on the 17th and then we just absolutely had the most violent dump two days later. Perhaps that was the quote unquote top.
01:16:50.130 - 01:17:13.970, Speaker A: Here's my take on this, man. I am not here for meme coins. I'm just not here for this shit. Being a meme coin. And by this, I mean just being sort of an influencer coin or not having any value proposition beyond the value proposition of somebody else is going to buy this thing in the future, right? Which I don't discount.
01:17:14.130 - 01:17:18.150, Speaker B: There's some value there only if it's underpinned by fundamentals.
01:17:20.410 - 01:17:42.362, Speaker A: It's not enough for me anymore. I feel like everybody chasing these meme coins, by the way, bitcoin included. At some level, it's the most successful meme coin. I mean, they're playing in the kiddie pool, and we're out here exploring the ocean. Dude, what is ether? It's so much different. Yes, there's a meme coin aspect to it, but it actually generates transaction fees. It's a capital asset.
01:17:42.362 - 01:17:42.750, Speaker A: Right.
01:17:42.820 - 01:17:44.366, Speaker B: Which is the meme, by the way.
01:17:44.468 - 01:17:58.098, Speaker A: Which is the meme. It's making the world more decentralized. It's making the world more bankless. What is safemoon doing? Is safemoon doing that? Is doge doing that? Buy and hold doge. Right. It's not enough for me. It's not why I'm here.
01:17:58.098 - 01:18:27.178, Speaker A: I'm done with meme coins. I'm done with influencer coins. I'm still bullish on bitcoin, right? Because there is a place for some of these successful meme coins, but for me, it's totally not enough. And this market and this whole industry will be hollowed out by meme coins if that is the only thing we're producing for the world. Fortunately, we're not. It's just the thing that media likes to shine its light on and give attention to at this moment in time. But kind of annoying, kind of frustrating.
01:18:27.178 - 01:18:38.254, Speaker A: I don't hate it. People can do whoever they want. It's free, open market. People can buy meme coins if they want. I don't hate it. It's just a shallow pursuit to me. And it's not enough.
01:18:38.254 - 01:18:39.198, Speaker A: Not enough.
01:18:39.284 - 01:18:47.350, Speaker B: You got to have substance. At the end of the day, there has to be something real. When you collapse down and kill the meme, there has to be something real there. Good memes are built on real foundations.
01:18:47.850 - 01:19:12.140, Speaker A: Absolutely. Good memes have to be validated. Elon Musk is now blowing up the Wall street case for bitcoin. Here's the take here, basically, that if Elon's tweets can evaporate, like hundreds of millions in crypto market cap, right. It's not an institutionally ready asset. Institutionally grade. That's basically the Bloomberg take here.
01:19:12.590 - 01:19:25.562, Speaker B: That's a fair take. That's a fair take. But also, that is kind of the future. The future, in my opinion, here's standing outside of crypto. The future is chaotic. The next ten years is chaotic. The next ten years is volatile.
01:19:25.562 - 01:19:34.258, Speaker B: And so you got to learn to play in the game. Like, this is not your world anymore. Institutions, we are finding new institutions. So you better get with the change.
01:19:34.424 - 01:19:41.730, Speaker A: But also, what does a statement from Jerome Powell do to markets? Yeah, Jerome Powell can make a statement.
01:19:41.810 - 01:19:43.990, Speaker B: Jerome Powell is the world's biggest influencer.
01:19:45.290 - 01:20:00.246, Speaker A: Right. Are institutional influencers really that much different? I don't know. Jerome Powell has this power, and people think it's normal. It's just like, yeah, Jerome, let's watch everything he says. Just a different set of influencers.
01:20:00.358 - 01:20:05.058, Speaker B: Yes. Institutional influencers. Approved. Institutionally approved influencers.
01:20:05.094 - 01:20:06.890, Speaker A: What are you excited about, David?
01:20:07.050 - 01:20:26.462, Speaker B: I am excited about the second half of the bull market. I said it earlier in 2017. I got into the world of crypto after I watched Ether go up to $430 and then fall down to $135. And I was like, whoa, I got to buy now. And that was my first entrance. That was my first real buy of ether. A dip.
01:20:26.462 - 01:20:40.066, Speaker B: Well, die also bought the top earlier. Don't have. I'm a crypto novice. I'm not automatically buying the dips. I'm definitely buying the tops the first time around. So I would like to just put myself, pat myself around the back. So this is my crypto birthday.
01:20:40.066 - 01:20:47.718, Speaker B: I went one full cycle around the crypto markets. Four years around. I feel like I've gone one full crypto revolution.
01:20:47.814 - 01:20:49.466, Speaker A: And so here I go, around the sun.
01:20:49.568 - 01:20:59.230, Speaker B: Yeah. And so I kept on talking about how there's first cyclers, and technically, I was still on my first cycle as of this dip, this massive dip. I now consider myself a two cycler.
01:20:59.650 - 01:21:00.186, Speaker A: Congrats.
01:21:00.218 - 01:21:02.110, Speaker B: That's what I'm excited about. Happy birthday.
01:21:02.180 - 01:21:02.782, Speaker A: Birthday, sir.
01:21:02.836 - 01:21:03.502, Speaker B: Thank you.
01:21:03.636 - 01:21:05.794, Speaker A: Happy second birthday. First birthday. That's awesome, man.
01:21:05.832 - 01:21:06.334, Speaker B: First birthday.
01:21:06.382 - 01:21:16.420, Speaker A: Because I was zero years old. You're one. This is what I say. Crypto is like three year olds teaching two year olds things. We're all so early in this.
01:21:17.110 - 01:21:18.820, Speaker B: Ryan, what are you excited about?
01:21:19.530 - 01:21:42.398, Speaker A: I want to riff off that, man. I'm excited about the dip. Like, sharing a dip with all of you fine people is actually exciting. Right? This is where you earn the crypto that you hold. It's very much a battle against your lizard brain, against all of your emotional reactions. Builds character. It does the volatility in crypto will throw you for a loop if you let it.
01:21:42.398 - 01:22:08.690, Speaker A: Right? But if you can take a long term mindset, if you can hold through these dips and think about long term horizons. Right? I don't know. It's actually kind of a Zen like experience as a little like Chris Berninsky out there. That guy is always Zen. And he's Zen during the dips, he's Zen during the bull runs. He's Zen all of the time. And you achieve that with practice.
01:22:08.690 - 01:22:20.566, Speaker A: And I'm excited to go through it. I know many people are on their first birthday, they're unicyclers. And this is all part of the game, guys. This is completely normal. It's all part of the game.
01:22:20.748 - 01:22:39.674, Speaker B: Crypto. It's really a lesson in how well can you control your brain, how well can you control your emotions? Because markets investing are emotional. Markets are, by definition, emotional. And when they are so incredibly crazy in crypto, that's by definition crazy emotions. And I remember when I was first getting into crypto, I was like, oh, that token pumps got to go chase. Oh, that token pumps got to go chase. Fomo.
01:22:39.674 - 01:22:40.506, Speaker B: Fomo. Fomo. Fear.
01:22:40.538 - 01:22:40.746, Speaker A: Fear.
01:22:40.778 - 01:22:51.326, Speaker B: Fear. Oh, dip. Is it over? It's like, shit. I don't know. And then this time around, I'm like, congratulations to whoever won on that pump. I'm going to wait my turn. Like, no, I'm not going to pay that gas fee.
01:22:51.326 - 01:22:56.446, Speaker B: I'm just going to sit back. I got my bags. I'm comfy. Oh, a dip. Oh, fuck. Wow. Ouchie.
01:22:56.446 - 01:23:13.750, Speaker B: That hurt. Let's keep going, though. Much more zen this time around. And so I hope all the people who are going through these crypto markets are also practicing mindfulness at large, because in separate from crypto, it's a good skill to have, but it also is a very strong skill to make you more money in crypto markets if you can be mindful.
01:23:13.910 - 01:23:20.780, Speaker A: Well said. All right. With that, let's go to meme of the week. David meme of the week. First meme emotions. This is awesome.
01:23:21.550 - 01:23:33.230, Speaker B: It's not even a complete meme because the text is in the good. Here's Niraj. I don't know what GM. He starts saying GM. I don't remember. I don't know what that means. But he goes, remember, you can't spell crypto without cry.
01:23:33.230 - 01:23:38.590, Speaker B: And he's got a teary eyed cat with a thigh kitten. Sad, sad kitten.
01:23:38.930 - 01:23:40.146, Speaker A: It's so good.
01:23:40.328 - 01:23:42.254, Speaker B: GM sounds for. Good morning. Thank you, Mike.
01:23:42.382 - 01:23:50.246, Speaker A: Okay, good morning. Remember, you can't spell crypto without cry. That's awesome. I was feeling it this week a little bit. All right, what's this one documenting? Ethereum. Great meme account.
01:23:50.428 - 01:24:07.034, Speaker B: Yeah. Second meme of the week. You get two this week. We're spoiling our listeners. We can't give them two too many times. We have the grid of gravitational waves, right? And so we have the sun, and it's pulling down the gravity of the gravitational grid. We have a neuron star.
01:24:07.034 - 01:24:16.110, Speaker B: It's even more. And then we have the Eth price just going absolute tanking and then back up. And that's what a dip looks like. And that's sometimes how you can try and call a bottom.
01:24:16.260 - 01:24:36.274, Speaker A: Very good ending. On a happy note, of course. Guys, none of this was financial advice. Was this just the dip? Was this the end of crypto? There's no way to be sure, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. We don't think it's the end of crypto. We think we'll continue to do this into the future.
