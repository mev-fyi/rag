00:00:00.170 - 00:00:36.820, Speaker A: What is the idea of cosmos? What is the central thesis? The central thesis of Cosmos was that we are going to see a world of not a few blockchains, but many, many blockchains, most of them being application specific blockchains or app chains. And there's no such thing as a single final settlement layer. Every blockchain is going to be the settlement layer for its own native assets and its own native state. And that's what gives it fundamentally sovereignty. Right? We believe that we're not trying to build the world computer, as Ethan Buckman puts it, we're trying to build community computers and let these community computers all talk to each other.
