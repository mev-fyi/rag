00:00:00.090 - 00:00:20.542, Speaker A: Creative fidendas coming out with his second generative art collection, 900 new NFTs. And he just finished a sale at 14 e each. So he raised 12,600 ether inside of the sale, $17.6 million in a bear market. And Ryan, they are beautiful. If you are into this game of generative art. Ooh, that one is great.
00:00:20.542 - 00:00:41.942, Speaker A: So the people that bought what these things are, they actually bought a mint pass, not the actual NFT themselves. If you have a mint pass, you can go into this kind of create your own, build an NFT algorithm workshop. So the minter and the artist in the algorithm are all having this three way relationship. You can start to tinker with some dials and make your NFT look a particular way, and then you get to mint it, which is kind of cool.
00:00:41.996 - 00:00:43.170, Speaker B: NFts are back, baby.
