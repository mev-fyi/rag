00:00:00.090 - 00:00:18.794, Speaker A: And here we are not just over halfway through 2023. Quan is in jail in Montenegro waiting to be extradited to the United States. Sam Bankman Fried is under house arrest. Can only assume he's going to jail. Machinsky is going to jail. Suzu and Kyle Davies are still on the run, but they are completely ostracized from the west. They can't step anywhere outside of Dubai or otherwise they would be arrested.
00:00:18.794 - 00:00:37.750, Speaker A: So that box is not yet checked. However, with all the other boxes checked and the complete fall from grace, that is 30 capital and probably the very likely cases and efforts going into actually grabbing those guys that's probably going on behind the scenes that we don't know about. I say that we have permission to be bullish.
00:00:40.830 - 00:00:47.286, Speaker B: Bankless Nation, it is the third Friday of July, and it is time for what, David?
00:00:47.478 - 00:01:04.126, Speaker A: It's the Bankless Friday weekly roll up, Ryan, where we cover the entire weekly news in crypto, which is always an ambitious endeavor, yet we persevere nonetheless into the frontier, no matter where we are in the world. As you can tell, I'm in a kind of a cramped little this is the most cramped podcast recording setup I've ever had.
00:01:04.228 - 00:01:13.618, Speaker B: It looks good, actually. So David's in Paris, and by the way, Bankless Nation, this is the first time we are actually doing an episode in three weeks. All right.
00:01:13.784 - 00:01:19.986, Speaker A: Mine and Ryan's first podcast in three weeks, which is the longest time that we've gone since starting this podcast. Yeah.
00:01:20.008 - 00:01:24.822, Speaker B: So we've had david's been off climbing mountains and you've got some more mountains to climb, by the way.
00:01:24.876 - 00:01:25.750, Speaker A: I've got one.
00:01:25.900 - 00:01:34.860, Speaker B: So we queued up some podcasts. We put those out for you for the last and I've been doing some solo episodes. David's got one more mountain. How has it been so far?
00:01:35.550 - 00:02:00.610, Speaker A: It's been pretty good. Let me tell you. The whiplash between being on a mountain and then the next day flying to Paris to go to ECC, so, like, from mountain to crypto conference in under 24 hours was a lot. I was sitting on the plane. There was a few moments I had like, halfway up the mountain, I was like, climbing rainier. And we were at like 12,000ft with 2000ft more to go, and I was pretty exhausted. And I'm like, this is my first vacation.
00:02:02.470 - 00:02:03.970, Speaker B: And that's what you choose to do?
00:02:04.040 - 00:02:33.746, Speaker A: That's what I choose to do, yeah. And then just a day and a half later, I'm on a flight to go to Paris, and I'm like ten days behind on anything crypto related. Like, crypto is a new industry. Ten days later, I was like, sitting around. I was like, man, I need to catch up on crypto. What do people do? How do people consume crypto news? What do they do when they need to catch up on the week? Oh, I can listen to the roll up weekly roll up with you and Anthony. And I was like, oh, this is so you know, it is really useful.
00:02:33.798 - 00:02:48.654, Speaker B: I mean, Bankless, I think for me and for you, David, has just been about kind of a journey of creating content, exploring subjects that we would have wanted to explore otherwise. So it's just kind of a chronicling of that journey. I'm glad you found that roll up so useful, David.
00:02:48.702 - 00:02:49.154, Speaker A: That's great.
00:02:49.192 - 00:02:51.540, Speaker B: That's great customer.
00:02:52.390 - 00:02:54.638, Speaker A: I was very satisfied. Okay. Very informative.
00:02:54.734 - 00:02:56.690, Speaker B: Remind people what Anthony did a great job.
00:02:56.760 - 00:03:02.134, Speaker A: A huge shout out to Anthony Cesano for tapping in three times over the last, like, five weeks or so.
00:03:02.252 - 00:03:07.046, Speaker B: I mean, he really is the third podcast co host, even if he doesn't know it.
00:03:07.068 - 00:03:08.406, Speaker A: Yeah, he's better than us.
00:03:08.508 - 00:03:13.098, Speaker B: Okay, so what are you doing in Paris? You said a crypto conference. What conference is that?
00:03:13.264 - 00:03:44.606, Speaker A: ECC. So I'm at the Ethereum Community Conference. So actually ECC is interesting because it was the super spreader event right before COVID So it was the last Ethereum Conference before we shut down conferences. And then it was also the first conference in 2021 that started things up again. So this is the third ECC since the conference season really got started. And conference season started after in 2021, where crypto was dead between 2018 to 2020. From the perception of the outside world to very much alive.
00:03:44.606 - 00:03:59.974, Speaker A: And so July. It's always in July. It's always in the same place. It's always the same running and programming this thing. And so it always feels like one trip around the sun. It's like an arbitrary birthday for all the conference. Goers out there like, oh, it's a nice landmark every single year.
00:03:59.974 - 00:04:05.034, Speaker A: So this is ECC number six. This is my third. It was great. It's been great.
00:04:05.232 - 00:04:16.714, Speaker B: I always like to ask because as you know, I don't go to these things. I only go to one conference a year, and that is Permissionless, which is coming up, by the way. When is that coming? That's the next one. You're doing that's in September.
00:04:16.762 - 00:04:18.590, Speaker A: That is next. Permissionless is next. Yeah.
00:04:18.660 - 00:04:46.886, Speaker B: All right, so, Bankless Nation, make sure you grab a ticket if you already haven't. But EthCC is different. My impression, it's kind of a technical type of track. My favorite question to ask people, and we'll get into some of the events, some of the announcements that were made at EthCC, but the question right now is, because we're still in a bear market, is like, what's the vibe among the builders? So how's everyone feeling? Like, what's your assessment? Because you've been to so many ECCs, how does it compare to previous ones?
00:04:47.068 - 00:05:12.506, Speaker A: Yeah, since it's at the same venue every single year. I walked up to the venue this year, and there's always people kind of hanging out outside. People come without tickets, and so they come and just hang out outside, and then people take a break outside. So there's always people hanging out outside the venue. And I was walking up and I see the massive people that's always there. And I could just tell, like, oh, thank God it's a calm one this year, because last year's was insane. And also it was 100 degrees last year.
00:05:12.506 - 00:05:40.246, Speaker A: This year was only 80 in Paris. I would say it's calm and relentless. The rate of building in ethereum has always been redlining in a good way at the highest RPMs possible. Whether you're in a bull market or in a bear market, that hasn't changed. And specifically the building. Now it really feels like people have always been building hard. But rubber is really meeting the pavement here.
00:05:40.246 - 00:06:07.794, Speaker A: And I think we'll see that as we go through this weekly roll up agenda. And you can just kind of look around this space. Like, layer twos are shipping the infrastructure around. Layer twos are shipping hard. Entire ecosystems are transitioning. All the hard problems, if they are not being currently solved, they are on the cusp of being solved. And that's kind of how I would share the sentiment of builders, is like, it's real inside of it's been real in the last six months.
00:06:07.794 - 00:06:12.254, Speaker A: And the next six months, a lot of very real stuff, hard problems are getting solved.
00:06:12.382 - 00:06:25.670, Speaker B: I like those words. Calm but relentless is a really interesting way to describe it. And there was a Bankless party event as well that we had for Bankless citizens. This is a photo from one of these. So what was the vibe there?
00:06:25.820 - 00:06:44.106, Speaker A: Yeah, this is the Bankless team. So this is at the end, the end of the party. And we took a team photo. Party was great for all the Bankless citizens. Shout out to all the Bankless citizens that were out there. I talked to John Ice Cool from the Dow quite a lot there. And just a number of other people while talking to all the Bankless citizens, there's like certain archetypes across crypto.
00:06:44.106 - 00:06:51.546, Speaker A: Of course we know this. The different tribes I would call the Bankless citizens, like the Athenians of crypto.
00:06:51.658 - 00:06:52.478, Speaker B: Oh, really?
00:06:52.644 - 00:07:20.178, Speaker A: Yeah. There's a lot of dads. We have a lot of dads. Shout out to all the dads that listen to Bankless. But there are a lot of people who really care and really care deeply about crypto. And they're living like it's a lawyer with two kids. Why I call this the Athenians is in the 300 movie, you have the Spartans and the Athenians talking to each other and the Spartan guy who's I can't remember the name, the guy, it's.
00:07:20.194 - 00:07:22.294, Speaker B: Just like a warrior society, right?
00:07:22.492 - 00:07:53.090, Speaker A: Yeah. And he's asking the Athenians who want to join the fight? And it's like, what's your profession? And one guy says, like, oh, I'm a blacksmith, and, oh, what's your profession? It's like, oh, I'm a cobbler. And like, oh, what's your profession? I'm a farmer. We're the Athenians. It's just this very diverse group of very humble, focused people who live in a society, live in a collective and so everyone's just really appreciative, of course, of the podcast. But the diversity, I think diversity is really the word I'm going for here is pretty cool to see.
00:07:53.160 - 00:08:03.106, Speaker B: I really love that description of Bankless as the Athenians. I feel like an Athenian myself, so that's really cool to hear. David I see a lot of plants at this venue. Was that intentional?
00:08:03.138 - 00:08:26.666, Speaker A: David yeah. So I wish I could say I picked this place, but Rachel, who is in the middle, she picked this place. Curator of Vibes the drinks were fantastic. I had a number of chinning cocktails, so I got a little loose. And because we had this beautiful event sponsored by Sega, all of the drinks for the bankless citizens were free. These are the rules. If you're a Bankless citizen, you come to the bankless meetup, you get free drinks.
00:08:26.666 - 00:08:33.134, Speaker A: The founder of Sega was there and we were talking a little bit. Ryan, do you know what an exotic option is?
00:08:33.252 - 00:08:35.358, Speaker B: No, it sounds fun.
00:08:35.444 - 00:09:04.218, Speaker A: Exotic is it's? So you have normal options, you have vanilla options and you have exotic options. I think the simplest way to explain an exotic option is if this then that statements for options. So like conditional options. So he was like walking me through what you can do with exotic options. And so if you are interested in exotic options or you are interested in free drinks, sega might be the place. Free drinks protocol is the link. Yeah.
00:09:04.218 - 00:09:04.714, Speaker A: So thanks.
00:09:04.752 - 00:09:05.066, Speaker B: Very cool.
00:09:05.088 - 00:09:10.006, Speaker A: Thanks for Sega, for providing DFI exotic options and providing the Bankless nations with our liquidity.
00:09:10.118 - 00:09:29.394, Speaker B: And the next time the band gets back together, of course is at Permissionless. And hope the Athenians, the bankless citizens show up for that one. Anyone who's listening, of course, you can catch that in Austin, Texas, September 11 through 13th. There's a link in the show notes to tap into this. David, do you still have some conference energy in you for the back half this year?
00:09:29.512 - 00:10:04.750, Speaker A: Yeah, I actually signed up for one more here at ECC, but we'll talk about that later. You called ECC a very technical conference and you're totally right. For people that hear me and Ryan talking about conferences and hear the crypto industries talking about conferences, ECC, it's like 301, 401 kind of hard mode. It's like professionals and teams and people coming to get shit done. And definitely that's also true for Permissionless. But I think if you're looking for a stepping stone into being a conference or and I can't recommend being a conference or enough. Ryan permissionless is a great place to get started.
00:10:04.750 - 00:10:27.186, Speaker A: It's like the Vibes last year, just like yeah, the Athenians like so many different people, a hodgepodge group of people coming to all coalesce under Permissionless and Blockworks does a killer job, just like facilitating and organizing and operationalizing a conference. And so we will have our next banquet meet up for citizens at Permissionless. That is September 13, 11th, through 13th in Austin, Texas. A ton of people if you only.
00:10:27.208 - 00:10:28.306, Speaker B: Go to one if you only go.
00:10:28.328 - 00:10:30.386, Speaker A: To one if you only go to one is permissionless.
00:10:30.498 - 00:10:34.422, Speaker B: This is me. I only go to one. This is the one I go from.
00:10:34.476 - 00:10:35.302, Speaker A: Personal experience.
00:10:35.436 - 00:10:57.534, Speaker B: We got a lot to cover this week. David, man, we're talking about conferences. It's good to catch up with you, but there's so much going on in Crypto. I'm glad you stayed up to date on the roll up, but topics of the week, alex Machinsky, remember that guy Scammer from Celsius? He was just charged by the SEC, the CFTC and the FTC. Finally they are busting the Scammers. We'll talk about that. What else we got going on the Ripple case?
00:10:57.572 - 00:11:15.438, Speaker A: I know the Ripple case happened right after you stopped recording with Anthony last week and then you added that little bit. But we're going to get the reactions from the Ripple case. I actually have a take. I think Ripple actually lost, but Crypto still won. That's my hot take about that. Yeah. And then also I interviewed Hayden Adams about this next announcement.
00:11:15.438 - 00:11:31.062, Speaker A: Uniswap X. I interviewed him right before ECC. So we're going to go into what is Uniswap X. It's a brand new protocol to pair with the Uniswap AMMS. We also got an L one that wants to become an L two. And we'll talk about all the EthCC relevant things along the way as well.
00:11:31.116 - 00:11:57.474, Speaker B: Before we get into it, guys, I want to give a shout out to our friends and sponsors over at Stator Protocol. This is a new ETH staking protocol. It is decentralized. One of my favorite things about this is that it is permissionless. So similar to some of the decentralized protocols out there, like rocket pool. And second, if you're ever looking to run an ethereum node yourself, this is the lowest cost way to do that. Lowest capital requirements, I should say.
00:11:57.474 - 00:12:28.762, Speaker B: Way to do that only for ETH to spin up a Stator node, which is really cool. And they also have a pledge to keep staking decentralized on ethereum, including a self cap on the amount of ETH that they'll accept in their protocol. So, David, I got to tell you, I am now in the season where I'm thinking about staking my ETH. Okay, I've staked some in the past, but now I'm kind of ratcheting that up. It feels like a lot of the risk has been boiled out of it. And it is so fantastic to see all of these new staking options right now. As far as launch incentives, stator has a 1.5
00:12:28.762 - 00:12:41.822, Speaker B: X staking boost this month that you can be eligible for. And they've got some LP rewards too. So go check them out. And in general, look for options to stake your ETH. That is the bankless way.
00:12:41.876 - 00:12:53.790, Speaker A: That 1.5 x boost. What that means is you are getting a little bit extra from the SD token paid as incentive. So Token, incentives is where that boost come from. If you want that boost, there's a link in the show notes so you can go and get started with stator.
00:12:53.870 - 00:12:59.890, Speaker B: David, let's talk markets. Man, it's been too long. Where are we at this week on bitcoin?
00:13:00.790 - 00:13:21.180, Speaker A: I'm not going to get out the words out of my head at the bankless meetup where everyone says that they just chuckle when we do the prices, but we're doing them anyway. We're doing them anyway. Bitcoin last week, seven days ago, 30,900. It's currently down Thursday afternoon, 4% to 29,700. So down 4%. Bitcoin down 4% on the week.
00:13:21.710 - 00:13:29.550, Speaker B: I think pricing in the crab market is difficult because it just doesn't change from week to week. This is basically in single digits a lot.
00:13:29.700 - 00:13:30.206, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:13:30.308 - 00:13:33.182, Speaker B: How about ether? May as well. What's ether on the week?
00:13:33.236 - 00:13:44.500, Speaker A: Down 3%. So 1930 to 1890. So down 3%. And then, of course, that means the ratio is up. It's up a little bit more than a percent hanging out. I would call it a negligible week.
00:13:45.190 - 00:13:48.898, Speaker B: This feels like our crab market numbers, right? 30k.
00:13:49.064 - 00:13:50.478, Speaker A: This is big crab markets.
00:13:50.574 - 00:14:06.940, Speaker B: Yeah, this is where we are crab, by the way. It just is a market that goes back and forth, back and forth. It continues. And that's sort of where we are left to right before this influx of new money, which where's it going to come from? I think that's a major theme for us this year in 2023. 2024. But what's the ratio look like? Any change there?
00:14:07.470 - 00:14:11.100, Speaker A: Up a little percent and a half point. 63.
00:14:11.470 - 00:14:13.446, Speaker B: Market cap. I think we're above a trillion.
00:14:13.478 - 00:14:21.134, Speaker A: I'm not even 1.3 trillion. You said 1.3 trillion last week with Sazle. That was the first time we hit 1.3.
00:14:21.252 - 00:14:34.130, Speaker B: I mean, that feels big, right? To be above a trillion? That's another big number for me. Let's talk about tradfib. David, you remember stocks, those things that you could they're like tokens, they're like, ERC, 20s. But honestly, I clearly forgotten about stocks.
00:14:34.550 - 00:14:38.586, Speaker A: I only look at the charts that you have pulled up, the Nasdaq and the spy.
00:14:38.638 - 00:14:41.350, Speaker B: Well, look at them. It's a nice looking chart.
00:14:42.250 - 00:14:44.406, Speaker A: I shouldn't have forgotten about stocks, let.
00:14:44.428 - 00:14:45.398, Speaker B: Me tell you that.
00:14:45.484 - 00:15:04.814, Speaker A: They're almost at all time highs. Both the Nasdaq and the spy are almost at all time highs, which is around where crypto set its all time highs. Crypto set its all time highs at the end of 2021 and going into 2022, the Spy and Nasdaq did the same and they are almost back there. What gives?
00:15:04.932 - 00:15:07.022, Speaker B: Yeah, what gives? Where's our bull market?
00:15:07.076 - 00:15:08.990, Speaker A: Where's our all time highs?
00:15:09.410 - 00:15:21.140, Speaker B: It's funny because people in crypto are bragging about how bitcoin and Ether are decoupled from stocks and how great that is. I'm like, but it's decoupled in the wrong direction. That's not fun. That's bad.
00:15:22.470 - 00:15:56.174, Speaker A: This is a take from Anthony Cesano where he said, Max Payne for crypto investors is watching stocks hit all time highs, while ETH and BTC are range bound. Aka crab market Ultra Pain is selling crypto for stocks just before crypto starts a new bull market. And I comment below this and I say the year is 2019. This is exactly what 2019 was. The equities markets were ripping and crypto was just lagging so hard and it gave us all so much FOMO. We were so bummed about that. And then you all know what happens in 2020.
00:15:56.174 - 00:16:02.286, Speaker A: But man, the 2019 to 2023 discrepancies not you know what?
00:16:02.308 - 00:16:04.430, Speaker B: It's different for me. I'm feeling zero FOMO.
00:16:05.250 - 00:16:06.694, Speaker A: Go ahead, rally stock.
00:16:06.842 - 00:16:12.818, Speaker B: I don't care. We are so well positioned right now in crypto. I'm just like, okay, that's great. Go do your thing.
00:16:12.984 - 00:16:27.650, Speaker A: In fact, now that the discrepancy is there between Spy and Nasdaq all time highs and crypto is still flat, it would be dumb to chase that because the discrepancy is bullish for us for crypto assets, and it makes permission to be bullish.
00:16:27.730 - 00:16:31.346, Speaker B: Well, permission to be bullish. Is that the theme for the episode? Do we have permission?
00:16:31.378 - 00:16:54.034, Speaker A: That's the theme for the yes, yes. I've put this in the agenda a number of times. This is the first of many reasons in this roll up why bankless listeners, I think you have permission to be bullish. Now, if you are a bullish person on crypto and your friends are saying, ha ha, you're dumb for being in crypto, you're like, no, you should be buying crypto. You have permission to be bullish about that. Yeah, there's enough evidence there.
00:16:54.152 - 00:17:08.054, Speaker B: I totally agree. Should I say I've never been more confident about crypto, but I just feel like we are so well set up. The spring is coiling right now and.
00:17:08.172 - 00:17:22.742, Speaker A: It resonates with what I'm seeing here at ECC and all the hard problems about sequencers and layer twos and ZK stuff. All the hard problems coming into fruition being solved. Man okay, again, theme of the episode, it'll be it's a reoccurring theme. We'll keep going.
00:17:22.876 - 00:17:27.482, Speaker B: Okay, well, be patient. You have permission to be bullish now. That's what David Hoffman, my co host, says.
00:17:27.536 - 00:17:28.234, Speaker A: Good to have you back.
00:17:28.272 - 00:17:47.058, Speaker B: Man I like that bull energy. Okay. How about go? The protocol that's gho this is Ave. This is a stablecoin that launched on top of Ave. They've hit 4 million in market cap in two days and are probably larger by the time we're recording this. So a pretty good entry, I would say, into this. Yeah, it's 4.56
00:17:47.058 - 00:17:51.202, Speaker B: right now. Remind us what Go is, david yeah.
00:17:51.336 - 00:18:20.266, Speaker A: It'S pretty similar to Die from maker Dow, except this is Go from Ave. Pretty similar. If your mental model starts there, you're off to a great start. So Ave has assets in its vaults and it has extra margin because people deposit more than they withdraw. And so you can mint Go from your deposits into Ave, just like how you can borrow anything else. And so now ave is a hybrid compound Maker protocol, which is bullish, I would say.
00:18:20.288 - 00:18:21.146, Speaker B: Yeah, I like it.
00:18:21.168 - 00:18:40.946, Speaker A: Cool. And then also similarly, I would say another theme of what I'm noticing, a lot of parallel development. MakerDAO, this is aside from the news of this week, but MakerDAO is doing its Spark protocol, which is Aave for MakerDAO. So Aave's got a stablecoin, and MakerDAO's got a lending facility. So all these verticals well, MakerDAO has.
00:18:40.968 - 00:18:43.940, Speaker B: Always had a lending facility. What do you mean by this?
00:18:45.450 - 00:18:59.990, Speaker A: It's different. It's being compartmentalized now. So the stablecoin and the Ave is different than MakerDAO. And now MakerDAO, the system as a vertical, has the credit facility, which is Dai, and then the money market facility, which is Aave.
00:19:00.810 - 00:19:09.318, Speaker B: This is a meta pattern. There's definitely a lot of convergence here. One thing I'm seeing so much convergence is there's a ton of convergence on layer twos as a layer strategy.
00:19:09.494 - 00:19:11.162, Speaker A: That's another big theme that's going on.
00:19:11.216 - 00:19:17.066, Speaker B: This was completely unsettled two years ago. Anyway, let's keep going on. Do you do any whale watching, David?
00:19:17.178 - 00:19:18.634, Speaker A: I'm talking about crypto whale.
00:19:18.762 - 00:19:20.640, Speaker B: All right, well, I don't either.
00:19:21.010 - 00:19:26.594, Speaker A: I feel too jealous of people who I see moving their funds after ICOs after eight years.
00:19:26.632 - 00:19:28.658, Speaker B: I'm like, man, you got to remember.
00:19:28.824 - 00:19:30.386, Speaker A: This one address out there.
00:19:30.488 - 00:19:44.978, Speaker B: There's still some massive whales out there. This address awakened after eight years and just moved $116,000,000 to Kraken. Oh, our friends and sponsors, Kraken. What other exchange would you use? Of course, it's got to be Kraken.
00:19:45.074 - 00:20:08.138, Speaker A: To sell your ETH ICO. Imagine investing in the ethereum ICO and not making a single transaction, and the next thing you do is you send it to Kraken to sell don't. I wonder if they lost their private keys and magically found it somehow, which is the best day ever for them, or they just have the biggest diamond hands of all time. Just patient, don't even care about DFI.
00:20:08.234 - 00:20:13.722, Speaker B: Maybe it's just patience. So you wrote that thing from I mean, how much was this when they twenty five cents.
00:20:13.786 - 00:20:15.658, Speaker A: Twenty five. Thirty three cents.
00:20:15.834 - 00:20:17.906, Speaker B: Okay, well, that was the price of ether, right?
00:20:17.928 - 00:20:20.210, Speaker A: So it's 100 and the ICO price. Yeah.
00:20:20.280 - 00:20:44.140, Speaker B: Oh, no, it's 61K worth of ether times $0.25, whatever that is. I don't know, $15,000, something like this. So $15,000. You buy this thing, wait eight years, and then you send it to cash out, presumably at 116,000,000. Wow. That is a patient investor right there.
00:20:45.790 - 00:21:02.042, Speaker A: They must have had another address, because they never got themselves, like, I don't know, a house, a car. They never glowed up their life in eight years when they had access to hundreds of millions of dollars multiple times. Patience.
00:21:02.106 - 00:21:04.126, Speaker B: Who knows? Wow. What are the chances that way?
00:21:04.148 - 00:21:06.418, Speaker A: That's insanity to me, listening to this.
00:21:06.504 - 00:21:18.130, Speaker B: Right now and us talk about this individual, and they're like, Yep, that was me. They're bankless listener, maybe. David, we got a lot more to talk about. What else we got coming up next?
00:21:18.200 - 00:21:47.178, Speaker A: Coming up next, we got Mishinski arrested on fraud. But I have a conversation starter that actually starts with a Nick Carter take, which leads into our second reason of the week as to why we're allowed to be bullish. Ripple put the SEC on its heels, and I also have a take as to why Ripple actually lost, but crypto still won. ECC has brought plenty of announcements, and Base is open soon to builders. We're going to talk about that. I interviewed Jesse Pollock here at ECC Ryan. We're going to talk all about that and more as soon as we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible, especially Kraken.
00:21:47.178 - 00:21:55.246, Speaker A: If you have a dormant ICO that you haven't touched in over eight years, consider using Kraken to get your liquidity. We're going to go hear from them right now.
00:21:55.348 - 00:22:28.698, Speaker C: Kraken Pro has easily become the best crypto trading platform in the industry.

Mantle, formerly known as Bitdao, is the first Dowled web3 ecosystem, all built on top of Mantle's first core product, the Mantle Network, a brand new high performance ethereum layer two, built differently from the other layer two S that you may be familiar with. Mantle asks the question, how would you build a layer two if you had the technology of 2023? Mantle Network is a modular layer two, built using the Op stack, but uses eigen layer's data availability solution instead of the expensive ethereum layer one. Not only does this reduce Mantle Network's gas fees by 80% compared to other layer two S, but it also reduces gas fee volatility, providing a more stable foundation for Mantle's applications. The Mantle Treasury is one of the biggest Dow owned Treasuries in DFI, which is seeding an ecosystem of projects from all around the web3 space for Mantle.
00:23:22.822 - 00:23:51.982, Speaker C: Mantle already has subcommunities from around web3 onboarded to help the growth of Mantle, like Game Seven for web3 gaming, or Edudao from the world of DSI and Bybit for TBL and Liquidity and Onram. So if you want to build on the Mantle Network, mantle is offering a grant program that provides milestone based funding to promising projects that help expand secure and decentralize mantle. If you want to get started working with the first Dowled layer two ecosystem, check out Mantle at Mantle XYZ and follow them on Twitter at zero x mantle.
00:23:52.046 - 00:24:28.766, Speaker A: Alex Vacinsky, one of the big great scammers of 2022, has been arrested on fraud and a bunch of other charges, wire fraud. We're going to talk about all the details of what he's getting charged. But first, before we get into that conversation, I want to pull out this take from Nick Carter. I want to start this conversation here. Nick Carter, in November of 2022, right after FTX collapsed, he tweeted out, and I remember him talking about this on his podcast. He says, if we can't purge the Three Arrows Capital Boys, SBF and all of his cronies, Machinsky and Kwan, we don't deserve to move on as an industry. Good people will continue to leave because they can't morally justify participating.
00:24:28.766 - 00:24:49.286, Speaker A: I remember reading this take and I was like, oh, that's bearish. That's going to take so long. There's so many of them. They're all over the world. And today, Alex Machinsky is arrested on fraud and all these other charges that we're about to go into. And so the details here and we're going to come back to Nick Carter's take at the end. The details.
00:24:49.286 - 00:25:34.434, Speaker A: CEO of Celsius, of course, charged by the Department of justice, lawsuits from the SEC, CFTC, and FTC. The Department of justice accused Machinsky and his cronies of orchestrating a years long scheme to mislead customers on the market value of the company and interests in the sell token. The SEC has accused them of securities fraud and misleading investors. The CFTC has accused Machinsky of engaging in a scheme to defraud customers by misrepresenting the safety and profitability of the platform. And the FTC has accused Machinsky of violating the Federal Trade Commission Act in connection with the marketing and sale of cryptocurrency lending and custody services. The companies have agreed to a judgment of $4.7 billion, which will be suspended to permit Celsius to return its remaining assets to consumers in bankruptcy proceedings.
00:25:34.434 - 00:26:01.674, Speaker A: Basically, like that is the comprehensive takedown of Alex Wishinsky at all. That book is closed. And while we can go into the details of Alex Wishinsky, I think we can really just summarize it there. And I kind of want to go back to the Nick Carter take. Three errors. Capital Alex, Machinsky, Doe, Kwan and SPF. And he goes, if you want to pick a bottom, it is when all of Kwan, Bankman, Machinsky, Livingstone, and Suzu have reached their reckoning.
00:26:01.674 - 00:26:22.354, Speaker A: Only then can we recover. And I remember being intimidated by this take because I didn't want to admit that that's true because I thought that it was such a crazy hill to climb. And here we are, just over halfway through 2023. Quan is in jail in Montenegro, waiting to be extradited to the United States. Sam Bankman, Fried is under house arrest. I can only assume. He's going to jail.
00:26:22.354 - 00:26:55.010, Speaker A: Machinsky is going to jail. Suzu and Kyle Davies are still on the run, but they are completely ostracized from the west. They can't step anywhere outside of Dubai, otherwise they would be arrested. So that box is not yet checked. However, with all the other boxes checked and the complete fall from grace, that is three years capital and probably the very likely cases and efforts going into actually grabbing those guys that's probably going on behind the scenes that we don't know about. I say that we have permission to be bullish. I say those boxes are checked.
00:26:55.510 - 00:27:27.290, Speaker B: Look, I think it showcases the value of the bear market as well. If prices didn't go down and we didn't see the collapse that we saw, if we just continued to go kind of straight up, then all of these frauds would still be here in this industry and we'd have that toxic cancer inside of the body and not even know it. I mean, some people would know it, but it wouldn't be obvious. This is the value.
00:27:27.360 - 00:27:28.246, Speaker A: They'd be the minority.
00:27:28.358 - 00:27:55.374, Speaker B: They'd be the minority. We saw the same thing in 2019 too. All of the ideas were tested. We had a whole bunch of ICOs that were just like raising ungodly amounts of money for what? Like slides, white papers. Remember it was the white paper season. You just create a white paper, raise $50 million in a token, and then just like exit scam. Basically all of that was lifted during the bear market of 2018.
00:27:55.374 - 00:28:22.038, Speaker B: 2019. So we need these purges. This is the reason for bear markets and why I'm glad that I'm thankful that we have them. David Ripple case, we talked about this at the outset of last week's roll up. So of course, XRP, a judge ruled in the US that XRP itself isn't a security. According to the court. We talked about this, including we had Mike Selig on the episode.
00:28:22.038 - 00:28:35.166, Speaker B: Maybe we should just recap this for folks because you weren't here. And then I'd love to get your takes on this in terms of catching up and what you think about it. So what happened last week? That was so momentous. Yeah.
00:28:35.188 - 00:29:05.434, Speaker A: So last week that course case came out finally. We knew it was coming, but we didn't know the specific dates. And then it finally comes out. And the TLDR of the case is that it's both a win and a loss for both the SEC and Ripple. Both sides won and lost depending on which part of the case that we're talking about. So Mike Selleck says it's a massive win by the Ripple team against the SEC, where Judge Torres clearly affirms that the view that the same crypto asset may be sold in an investment contract as a standalone. Good.
00:29:05.434 - 00:29:47.846, Speaker A: So what he's saying is there's a line being drawn here and it's a line that is so elegant to me and it actually really restores my faith in the court system to actually methodically and clearly and thoughtfully come to the correct conclusion. So we have sold as an investment contract and then later sold as a standalone. Good. And those are two different things. And this is why I think this is so elegant. The SEC is charging Ripple and Ripple's loss here is that they are being charged with selling an investment contract of SRP to certain large institutions under the premise that later, because of the efforts of Ripple, they will be able to sell those tokens to retail after price appreciation. That was a security.
00:29:47.846 - 00:30:01.038, Speaker A: That was a legal securities offering. That was an investment contract. The actual XRP that is sold later to retail is not a security. So retail did not buy a security. A security was not sold. It was a standalone. Good.
00:30:01.038 - 00:30:56.460, Speaker A: So Ripple, who I think you and I would have say is like I do not agree with the strategy and ethics perhaps of Ripple as a product. And they got charged for what I think you and I would agree on is what they ought to have gotten charged for, which is quote unquote dumping on retail. They just did it with these institutional security sales, primarily the primary sales of XRP, which was an investment contract. But then it's a huge win for crypto because XRP is not a security. When retail, the interested retail parties permissionlessly bought that XRP token of their own volition, of their own accord. So the bad guys got got for the right reasons and crypto got protected also for the right reasons. Ripple has to pay fines for all of their legal securities offerings and Gary Gensler has to put his tail between his legs and we.
