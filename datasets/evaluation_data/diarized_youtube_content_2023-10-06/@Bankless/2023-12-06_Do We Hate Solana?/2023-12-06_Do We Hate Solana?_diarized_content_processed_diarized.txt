00:00:00.090 - 00:00:31.266, Speaker A: The bull market's in. And when you use Solana, it's got fantastic user experience. Let me just say that one of the best wallets come out of the community, the phantom wallet. Fantastic user experience. Right. It feels very good to get a transaction through, to end, to pay, like, you know, micro fractions of a cent, and to do many of the things that the original Ethereum vision promised. All right, David, so put out a bankless takes yesterday and got a lot of feedback from that Twitter, YouTube comments.
00:00:31.266 - 00:00:44.634, Speaker A: And actually, the highest signal for me is the bankless citizen discord. So that's where, you know, people are real there. Yeah. And so some of the feedback is basically like, I guess I would hang on.
00:00:44.752 - 00:00:48.298, Speaker B: Can we start with what's the bankless takes episode? What is the structure of this?
00:00:48.384 - 00:00:58.702, Speaker A: Yes. The bankless takes episode is an episode that you and I kind of formulate based on the last week of our hot takes. Things that we're thinking about, or the.
00:00:58.756 - 00:01:00.986, Speaker B: Not even hot takes, just takes opinions.
00:01:01.098 - 00:01:41.920, Speaker A: Stuff we're thinking opinions and the conversations that might be going into crypto Twitter. I think when we were preparing this week's takes agenda, it was basically like, what I really cared most about was talking about the bullcase for Ethereum, right. And how it feels like it has a lot of strengths and two k is undervalued, like going into the bull market. So that was my main take. The main thing I wanted to talk about. Also on the menu, there was a big Twitter discussion about solana. There was conversation about, is Solana doing flipping? We had a discussion about this, and I was like, David, I don't even know if we should talk about this at all.
00:01:42.290 - 00:01:44.138, Speaker B: What specifically? The Solana element.
00:01:44.234 - 00:01:45.274, Speaker A: Yeah, the Solana element.
00:01:45.322 - 00:02:18.610, Speaker B: Because the ETH element was. ETH's fundamentals are really strong, and also fundamentals and understanding them are important. And one of the meta conversations that was happening in the Twitter sphere was the back and forth between fishy and Santiago on the podcast. And fishy was all about, like, you just said, that Salana has a 20% chance of flipping ethereum. What fundamentals are you basing that on? Basically saying, like, you are just making this up, because how can you not? Because of the fundamentals are missing.
00:02:18.690 - 00:02:32.630, Speaker A: So I totally understand how they were related, and that's why we ended up including it. The reason that I was cautious about that is because that can feel like punching down, or that can feel like dunking, and that can feel like negative hate content. Right.
00:02:32.800 - 00:02:35.226, Speaker B: Because it's our takes. Because it's our opinion.
00:02:35.338 - 00:02:50.914, Speaker A: Yeah. When you're saying that this one thing is great, but this other thing that the market thinks is great and that a whole bunch of users think is great from an asset value accrual perspective, this other thing maybe isn't so great. Right.
00:02:50.952 - 00:02:58.310, Speaker B: The incumbent, the big one, is fantastic, and the disruptor, the smaller one, the one 10th of the size of the one, is shitty and bad.
00:02:58.460 - 00:03:40.946, Speaker A: So I didn't want to. My instinct was we shouldn't include it, we shouldn't talk about it, because just the perception is you're propping up one thing and you're punching down the other, when really, I think we ended up including it. And the case for that was basically, well, it's all the same conversation about what are crypto fundamentals? And that is the topic. So part of the Twitter conversation here, this is a tweet from Italio, just watched the latest bankless HQ episode and quoted Salana, is more narrative than actual fundamentals. One of us may have said that, probably said that. And he goes, you have an L, two and 527. Sorry, you have an L, one and 527.
00:03:40.946 - 00:04:04.294, Speaker A: L two s stuck in a vicious infrastructure cycle. But that's fundamentals for these guys. I'm going to put Ryan in the bitboy category from now on. So I had a nice little conversation with this guy on Twitter, and I said this ethereum was also more narrative than fundamentals last cycle. But by fundamentals I mean profitable blocks, based sales. And I defined it as such in the episode. It's fine if you disagree.
00:04:04.294 - 00:04:17.630, Speaker A: I could be wrong. It's a bankless takes episode. So we give our hot takes one thing. I'll just say there is like, that's what the episode is. It's our hot takes. I don't know that. Is this episode format a good idea?
00:04:17.700 - 00:04:19.854, Speaker B: It's in the name. It's in the name? Yeah.
00:04:19.892 - 00:04:36.530, Speaker A: I don't know. Some people like it. Some people like the space, I guess. The spice. I guess some people get upset when we give kind of our raw takes. But that's the episode format. And he continues, for whatever reason, your hot takes about any network that's not ETH l two s are just bad takes.
00:04:36.530 - 00:05:12.686, Speaker A: I understand we are all biased towards something, but come on, I asked him, what am I most wrong about? Would you say the entire thesis around ethereum, L2s versus Salana? And I said, it's an investment thesis. You're welcome to have your own argue for it. Right. Like that's it. It's an investment thesis. I think the quest here is, and maybe this was kind of lost in translation, or just like the perception of us continually dunking on Solana is I am like. And you are trying to understand how to value assets in this space.
00:05:12.686 - 00:05:13.102, Speaker A: Yes.
00:05:13.156 - 00:05:16.754, Speaker B: And it's been one of the longest pursuits of what we've been trying to do in this space.
00:05:16.872 - 00:06:02.222, Speaker A: I think that's important to have some sort of consensus. Take that we all, as an industry, and that everyone looking at these assets, looking to buy them, has a framework for valuing them. Because if we don't, any pump and dump like, memetic narrative thing can go from like one to 2000 20,000 and then back to zero. And it's all memetic. It's all a bunch of dogecoin. And my hope for this industry is that we get beyond memetic pricing and we actually just like other capital assets in the real world, we have some takes on how to value this space. And yes, we might not get it right, we have to change this over time.
00:06:02.222 - 00:06:25.942, Speaker A: But that to me, is like a sign of maturity, and it's important. So I'm always looking for it, and I'm open to adjusting what the fundamentals are and how to value this space. But if we don't have some sort of foundation for how we talk about these assets and value them, aren't we just falling prey to whatever pump and dump narrative, memetic thing exists? And we're just a bunch of memes, aren't we?
00:06:25.996 - 00:07:24.550, Speaker B: You give room for things that absolutely have zero fundamentals to pretend that it does have fundamentals. I think one mistake or just problem that we produce when we do these bankless takes episode is that there's a lot of motivations about like, hey, why are we saying the things that we're saying or doing the things that we're doing that aren't totally upfront? Because people haven't been listening to bankless forever and they don't understand David and Ryan's emphasis on fundamentals or the motivations. And then we are also the opinionated media company who's got opinions about stuff. And so those two particles combine and it results in the effect of just like, ethereum's got the fundamentals, that's why we emphasize it, that's why we talk about it. It's good for the industry that the number two blockchain has very strong fundamentals. That's why I believe in the flippining, and that's just grounding crypto in reality, which it's been disconnected for, for almost its entirety of its existence. These are the things that we want to see more of in the industry.
00:07:24.550 - 00:07:35.200, Speaker B: And then when we see so much, just like, narrative excitement around Solana and we don't see that same grounding in reality, it turns into us punching down.
00:07:36.610 - 00:07:46.434, Speaker A: I want to kind of flip that a little bit because it is true. And this criticism is important that we hear and receive that. It's just like we have a narrow definition of fundamentals right now.
00:07:46.472 - 00:07:50.866, Speaker B: Yeah, more narrow than what people like to accept or want to accept or agree with.
00:07:50.968 - 00:08:36.366, Speaker A: So the narrow definition of fundamentals that we were talking about in that episode is basically like capital asset fundamentals. It's like PNL. I'm under the belief right now, I think, that we can start to value our layer one assets based on how much cash it actually throws out, like discounted cash flow, like school of finance. Other people will say, what the f, are you doing? Like, one, it's way too early to do that. This asset class can't be valued like other asset classes yet. We're still trying to figure this out. And so don't even talk about blocks based profit or revenue or anything like that.
00:08:36.366 - 00:09:09.142, Speaker A: It doesn't matter. Another school of thought will say, well, actually, we don't want any of these things to be profitable at all. It's a fantastic strategy for a blockchain to subsidize user fees in order to get more users through issuance. That's a brilliant way to do it. It's called business development. It's called growth. Why are we getting on our high horse when we have the population of a mid sized US city using crypto right now? And the prize is millions of users.
00:09:09.142 - 00:09:38.514, Speaker A: And so the actual fundamentals here should be user experience, like active users, like the apps, the dev teams, is it actually going to work? And onboard people and you, a bunch of ETH holders and maximalists are narrowly defining it as how much block space you sold. And like, who cares? It's all about network effect and users. And people are using chains like Solana and they're like, this is better, right?
00:09:38.552 - 00:09:38.898, Speaker B: Feels better.
00:09:38.904 - 00:09:56.774, Speaker A: It is way better. Yeah, it's way better than ethereum, for instance. Ethereum, layer one main chain from a UX perspective. And they're seeing the fragmentation of L2s and being like, so this is your great solution to that? That's what they mean by fundamentals. And we have a more narrow definition when we were talking about it in yesterday's episode.
00:09:56.902 - 00:10:26.994, Speaker B: Okay, I think that our narrow definition of fundamentals is correct in, well, it's just correct in the longest of terms. It becomes more relevant. And I will take the fact that in the near term that it doesn't really matter. It's more noise. And if you invested based off of, like, blocks based sales or fundamentals, you would not have made nearly as much. You would have underperformed the market probably in the fullness of time, because it's all narrative based.
00:10:27.032 - 00:10:27.234, Speaker A: Right.
00:10:27.272 - 00:10:39.794, Speaker B: And so there's this era in crypto in which narrative really, really matters, because this is very young industry, and we're all trying to price in the future when there's such little amount of reality grounding.
00:10:39.842 - 00:11:05.600, Speaker A: But I think that's what people stumble on, David, when you say it's all narrative based. Right. And that's what people are jumping on. And I think justifiably so in some cases, bad UX is not just a narrative. That's a fact. Yes. Paying $10 for a transaction when you're just trying to send money from one place to another, that's not a narrative, that's a fact.
00:11:05.970 - 00:11:49.086, Speaker B: Yeah, but it's derived. The whole idea of blocks based sales is, to me, like a first principles version of valuating fundamentals. And I accept that that's a narrow way of doing this. Just having good ux is something that people experience firsthand, and that turns into their version of reality, which is totally valid. And it's, like, secondary to the fact. That's great that you have ux, but does it translate into blockspace sales? The reason why blockspace sales are so important is one of the core tenets of the bankless thesis is positive economics. Because positive economics means that your system is going to stand the test of time.
00:11:49.086 - 00:12:30.414, Speaker B: It captures more value than it leaks. If your system leaks more value over time, then in the fullness of time, it will eventually not work. It will eventually dissipate. If you only leak a little bit of value, it might work for, like, I don't know, a very long time, thousands of years, perhaps. And so, granted that there is wiggle room here with how fast your system leaks value versus how fast it doesn't. Like terra Luna leaked way too much value way too quickly. But still, the point stands that there's this very concrete way of valuating systems, which is, is it positively economic? Does it capture more value? And then you can say, like, okay, well, Solana, yes, it leaks value.
00:12:30.414 - 00:12:50.530, Speaker B: It inflates. But look what you get from that inflation. You get, like, super strong ux. You get instant transaction finality. You get insane throughput. And so, yes, Solana is not positively economic now, but what it is now is fantastic ux. But I would still call that like a second order fundamentals.
00:12:51.030 - 00:13:30.026, Speaker A: Is that a fair take? I think so. I think another way to maybe frame this and clarify it is. I think some people still do a lot of equating with the network and the asset in all cases. Right? And this probably comes from bitcoin, where bitcoin network and the bitcoin asset, they're much more singularly unified because previously, for a very long time, until we had all of the NFTs and BRC 20s that are being spun up on bitcoin, there were no apps. The only app was sending bitcoin from one person to another. That was the only app. And so bitcoin, the network and bitcoin the asset were kind of like synonymous.
00:13:30.026 - 00:14:19.038, Speaker A: When we get into a smart contract world and like chains like Ethereum or chains like Avalanche or Solana or any of these or Cosmos, right, you can have a disconnect between the network and the value that is created on the network for users and the value accrual mechanisms of the token themselves. So the token is not the network and the network is not the token. Right. And I think this is an important investor sort of take in general, again, maybe not in the early stages, but in kind of the later stages of things, you can have a network that creates so much value for the world. I think of networks like Napster, for instance, like peer to peer file sharing, a lot of quote unquote value was created. Did any of those on the.
00:14:19.204 - 00:14:21.946, Speaker B: Yeah, the value was created at the margins.
00:14:22.058 - 00:14:42.726, Speaker A: Yes. Did they capture that value in the form of an equity or a token or an investable asset? No. So they had value creation without value capture. And my biggest worry in general about some crypto assets is even if they create value, it doesn't necessarily mean that the thing that you're buying is able to capture that value. Right.
00:14:42.748 - 00:14:49.170, Speaker B: Which is like the big problem with uniswap right now, right? Creating infinite amounts of value and then is like kind of a shit.
00:14:49.330 - 00:15:05.594, Speaker A: I'm sensitive to it too, because honestly, it was a huge problem for Ethereum, right, in 2019. And so in 2019, there would be a common retort from the bitcoin community of basically like, ETH is just useful for gas.
00:15:05.642 - 00:15:06.458, Speaker B: ETH is gas.
00:15:06.554 - 00:15:07.402, Speaker A: ETH is gas.
00:15:07.466 - 00:15:09.434, Speaker B: It's a velocity token. It's a payment token.
00:15:09.482 - 00:15:11.374, Speaker A: Velocity token. Yes. It's not going to.
00:15:11.412 - 00:15:15.386, Speaker B: People are just going to hold the minimum amount of ether they need to use the applications.
00:15:15.578 - 00:16:26.226, Speaker A: Right. And so the quest for me, since that time, is to actually understand, okay, well, why is bitcoin even valuable in the first place? And I feel like I have a framework for understanding that, like, monetary premium, primarily, like reservation demand, and then, okay, why is ether going to exhibit value accrual at all? You got monetary premium, but it's also a capital asset, right? So it's actually throwing off cash. And so I just apply that same framework to other layer one assets. And anyway, just because the network could be absolutely fantastic, and I think it's fantastic that TroN is being used in the way that it's being used to make people more bankless, I think that cosmos, in the way that it's being used is fantastic. I think that Solana is also fantastic to the extent that people are using these apps and these are experiences. Well, but the question is, will the token accrue value? One reason I actually jettisoned from the cosmos community was like, I didn't see the value accrual around the atom token. And to be honest, I still don't.
00:16:26.226 - 00:16:58.706, Speaker A: So, nothing against Cosmos. It's fantastic. I just don't understand how the investment is good. And sometimes I think people put both hats on the same time in that. Are you saying the Solana network is bad or it doesn't have fundamentals? No, the network can have fantastic UX and fundamental all of these things. The question in the episode we were trying to answer yesterday was like, well, how does value accrual work? And I still have a lot of questions on that story for Solana. Does that make sense?
00:16:58.808 - 00:17:31.654, Speaker B: Kraken knows crypto. We are all on the journey of building a better financial system, and Kraken has been leading that charge for over a decade.

This is a tweet that I put out after my Kyle Somani the floor is modularity tweet. And so I kind of did the same thing for Solana.
00:19:18.106 - 00:20:11.594, Speaker B: It's like the floor is transaction fee revenue, and Solana is like the guy who's not touching the. So like the bankless take on this. The me and you take is like, you need transaction fee revenue to be sustainable. If we want our blockchains to stand the test, the time they need to be positively economic. And then if you go and scroll down, you'll find Solana community members seeing like, wow, David's dunking on like kind of like flipping it on its head because transaction fee revenue to many in the Solana world is extraction, right? And so this idea of a positively economic blockchain is synonymous with extraction from its user base. At least that's part of one of the shards of the Solana narrative that many people are coming out there. And so it's one of the same muddling of the investment case for Solana and the application layer for Solana.
00:20:11.594 - 00:20:53.726, Speaker B: These things can be bullish separately, and you can be bullish on the Solana app layer because it's minimum viable extraction. And if you believe that, that's great, because then applications get to use Solana, they get to have super fast transactions, everything is subsidized. But then using that same argument to say, and therefore Sol token is bullish is missing a link here, because the sole token is specifically subsidizing the value of the application. It's a transfer of the value capture of the Sol token to the value produced by the Solana application layer app. And you get to say, well, the token is still going to go up in price because all the apps are built on Solana. Solana has more mind share. If it has more mind share, people are just going to buy.
00:20:53.748 - 00:20:55.774, Speaker A: It has inflows. More inflows, right.
00:20:55.812 - 00:21:01.498, Speaker B: More buying inflows. But I would call that a narrative based buy pressure, because, oh, the apps are on Solana.
00:21:01.514 - 00:21:43.646, Speaker A: I'll buy soul narrative based. Or you could call it like, if you're being generous, like monetary premium too, right? I think kind of narrative based is like proto monetary premium. Like monetary premium at some level is just like everything left over after you take out the reservation demand for using the asset as a product, sorry, as a payment token to buy blockspace. And after you take out the discounted cash flow, the cash that you actually receive as a staker of soul tokens, for instance. So it's just like this monetary premium category. And to me, that's like the narrative category, the meme category. Bitcoin has this, Ethereum has this, and it is the hardest piece to value.
00:21:43.646 - 00:21:51.582, Speaker A: And so that's why I very much like blockchains that produce cash, because you can kind of evaluate that.
00:21:51.716 - 00:22:07.078, Speaker B: The memetic layer ought to be based on top of the fundamentals. We don't want memes for memes sake. That's like Dogecoin. We want memes based off of measurable metrics that you can go take to crypto skeptics out there and hear the.
00:22:07.084 - 00:22:09.926, Speaker A: Apples tradfi is like, hey, all the.
00:22:09.948 - 00:22:10.982, Speaker B: Money out there, right?
00:22:11.036 - 00:22:34.090, Speaker A: Yeah, I do think that actually, the floor's transaction fee revenue, where Solana has no transaction fees. I think that it's actually a pretty good strategy to not make its money on user transaction fees and to do it on the backside, which is like, I actually think if the bullcase for soul tokens is that soul holders make money on me V basically Sol stakers.
00:22:35.150 - 00:22:53.070, Speaker B: So that was one of the other tweets I got in trouble with the Solana community about is, you know, Solana is just as extractive as Ethereum. It just obfuscates it better if Solana is positively economic because people are going to buy sufficient soul tokens so they can have priority MEV extraction. That's just an abstraction in the backdoor extraction.
00:22:53.150 - 00:23:15.670, Speaker A: Yes. It's basically like, again, it's just our thesis so far, from what we've uncovered, our journey, our crypto journey for Dave and myself. And what we think we know is blockchains make money in two ways. They either sell blocks. This is how they produce cash, they sell blocks, or they sell the ordering of transactions inside those blocks. And what I'm saying is, if Solana.
00:23:15.830 - 00:23:20.522, Speaker B: Or both, I mean, it is both. It's just a matter of where's the balance between those two?
00:23:20.576 - 00:23:23.994, Speaker A: And Solana is being like, let's set transaction fees at zero.
00:23:24.112 - 00:23:24.442, Speaker B: Right?
00:23:24.496 - 00:23:32.506, Speaker A: And the bullcase for sole tokens themselves is you make money on the ordering of transactions inside the gate. Now, if they don't make money on.
00:23:32.548 - 00:23:37.086, Speaker B: Either, then they're not producing negative economics.
00:23:37.198 - 00:23:46.402, Speaker A: Yes, but it could still be worth something in that narrative. Monetary premium, memetic value category or uses money category.
00:23:46.466 - 00:23:51.010, Speaker B: But that's based off of very little. That makes me scared.
00:23:51.170 - 00:23:52.934, Speaker A: It makes me scared, too.
00:23:53.052 - 00:24:04.106, Speaker B: I just think that's not to invoke this, but just like when you're based off of something very little, very feeble, it can crumbling down. It comes crumbling down because there's not much holding it up there.
00:24:04.128 - 00:24:09.558, Speaker A: Although somebody will listen to this and be like, this is coming from the ETH is money, guys? Like, really? Are you serious?
00:24:09.654 - 00:24:10.070, Speaker B: Why?
00:24:10.160 - 00:24:14.122, Speaker A: Because we're proponents of monetary premium for ether, the asset?
00:24:14.186 - 00:24:21.840, Speaker B: Yes, because of the fundamentals. It's a result of not. First, it's the tail wagging in the dog.
00:24:22.530 - 00:24:38.870, Speaker A: Wait, but I'm bullish on Ethereum. Apart from the amount of cash that it throws off, I'm bullish that it is an asset that's going to be used, let's say, throughout the Ethereum economy. That includes a monetary unit we've called.
00:24:38.940 - 00:24:43.218, Speaker B: A unit of account in Opensea. It is the collateral inside of makerdao.
00:24:43.234 - 00:24:46.838, Speaker A: And AavE CDPs, like, you take a loan against it, all of these things.
00:24:46.924 - 00:24:50.286, Speaker B: That's like, people monetary premium, stake it for yields.
00:24:50.418 - 00:25:06.638, Speaker A: Solana could have the exact same. It could have like zero cash flow ability, but just massive monetary demand and sold tokens. It's just used as collateral in the Solana ecosystem. And it could be worth hundreds of billions of dollars based on that.
00:25:06.724 - 00:25:17.102, Speaker B: Sure. On the triple one asset thesis, you're missing a leg. And in my mind, so is bitcoin. I also don't believe in bitcoin.
00:25:17.166 - 00:25:44.490, Speaker A: Well, but that's the thing is that's where I feel like then you have to compete as a monetary instrument. Then you really have to have a strong, I'm a little bitcoin or old school on this, where you have to have some sort of monetary schedule and credibility and credible neutrality around that schedule so that it gains legitimacy. And it doesn't feel like some centralized actor can kind of tinker the monetary policy at any point of time.
00:25:44.560 - 00:25:50.458, Speaker B: Yeah, the Salana monetary policy is relatively stable. It's inflating at 7% or something a year.
00:25:50.544 - 00:25:52.746, Speaker A: But who can change it? How does that change?
00:25:52.848 - 00:26:19.320, Speaker B: I mean, that's up to Salana governance, which is also in a relatively weak state, but that's because it's like a newer system and they haven't really been focusing on governance to the degree that other systems have, because they've been focusing on just like shipping, execution, execution. They've got parallel fee markets, right? Like local fee markets, parallelization. They've been doing the execution thing that Ethereum has been like, well, we're going to do the research and governance thing. And I was like, well, Solana's like, well, then I'm going to just.
00:26:20.250 - 00:26:51.470, Speaker A: That's. And that's where I think some of the pushback and criticism from bankless citizens and also from people on Twitter is basically like, you guys are living in La La world, right? Yeah, like, basically Ethereum, get your shit together. Like, ux sucks right now. Layer twos are hard. This whole bridging experience, like connecting, doing all these things, changing networks and metamask, it all kind of sucks. And what they're hearing is Ethereum. Like, we'll abstract that away.
00:26:51.470 - 00:26:55.394, Speaker A: It'll be better in the future. But we're not talking about the future, we're talking about here and now, right?
00:26:55.432 - 00:26:56.274, Speaker B: Bull market's in.
00:26:56.312 - 00:27:35.698, Speaker A: Yeah, the bull market's in. And when you use Solana, it's got fantastic user experience. Let me just say, like, Solana really excels from a user experience. It's one of the best wallets come out of the community. The phantom wallet. Fantastic user experience, right? It feels very good to get a transaction through, to end, to pay like micro fractions of a cent, and to do many of the things that the original Ethereum vision promised, right? Collateralized lending, trading of perps. It all feels very defi and it feels like you're doing this without kind of a binance or centralized exchange.
00:27:35.698 - 00:28:03.030, Speaker A: You're holding your own private keys, right? So people are saying that and they're like, okay, but this is here and now. And by the way, it has these aspirations and promises to massively. The monolithic chain strategy of the integrated chain strategy is like a strategy about fantastic UX for users. And is it back to the Suzu like Ethereum has abandoned its users type of. It's that kind of take, I think, and I don't think that's an unfair.
00:28:05.770 - 00:28:44.418, Speaker B: And the way that I would describe this goes back to our episode with Micah Belito when we had him on. It's like Cosmos is approaching the trilemma, the scalability trilemma from one angle. Ethereum is approaching it from a different angle, and Solana is approaching it from the last angle, right? And I think it's you and me, we came into crypto in the moment where Ethereum kind of really set our vision for the world, for this industry and the Ethereum perspective of you come in to the scalability trilemma. You start with and do not compromise on decentralization. And then you figure out how to get the others, whereas Solana is coming in. Well, we're going to start with scale and we're going to figure out how.
00:28:44.424 - 00:28:49.682, Speaker A: To start with users. Start with users, right? More decentralized over time as a BD.
00:28:49.826 - 00:29:19.898, Speaker B: System, as a BD strategy. Great killing. It works. Has already been working. The whole narrative around Solana is absolutely fantastic right now. It's like deafening. In the fullness of time, and this was my point to Mike, I'm sure you remember in the fullness of time, where you elect to start on the scalability trilemma and the thing that you enshrine is critically important, and then you'll try and get the others, determines in the wholeness of time what your system looks like at completion.
00:29:19.898 - 00:29:52.150, Speaker B: And so Solana, which compromised on decentralization in the hopes of gaining it later, will look like a system that compromised on decentralization and tried to get it later. Ethereum is a system that did not compromise on decentralization, but tried to get scalability layer later, and then in the fullness of time it will look like that. And maybe these systems really look very similar to each other. But the past dependency is critically important right now. Ethereum has to figure out bridging and chain abstraction. Solana doesn't have to do that because it's monolithic. Solana has to figure out decentralization.
00:29:52.150 - 00:30:39.900, Speaker B: The problem that I see Solana running into is it's got its high inflation rate of Solana at the same time that it's in a network infancy phase. I would prefer a network that would have a higher inflation rate while it didn't have a smaller set of actors than it would once have in the future. Because if you combine high proof of stake inflation with a low set of ecosystem participants, then you have the inflation going to an early set of adopters that become difficult to un entrine. You're accidentally formally entrying the early set of people because you compromise on decentralization. So I guess really the conversation is like, which is the easier problem to solve? Ethereum has decentralization solved, Solana doesn't. Solana has ux solved, Ethereum doesn't. Which is the easier problem.
00:30:40.750 - 00:30:52.954, Speaker A: I think that I agree largely. But also we run the risk of someone hearing that and feeling like there's some hyperbole there. I wouldn't say that Ethereum, for instance, has decentralization solved, right?
00:30:53.072 - 00:30:54.282, Speaker B: Comparatively solved.
00:30:54.346 - 00:30:58.622, Speaker A: There's things like Lido, for instance, and this is the case that, yeah, but.
00:30:58.676 - 00:31:12.942, Speaker B: Again, we call Lido. Lido is a problem. But also, just like in the grand scheme of things, we have to also parameterize how big of a deal that problem is. It is the next biggest problem for Ethereum, decentralization. It is not the problem for the Ethereum decentralization.
00:31:13.086 - 00:31:46.906, Speaker A: Here's the thing. What if the market doesn't really value decentralization? Or what if it doesn't value the type of decentralization that Ethereum is putting forward? And I think this is bankless. Citizen Scott Connor, who we're talking to in discord, made this take on Twitter. What we are market testing now is how valuable decentralization actually is. And then he goes on and says, ethereum has one definition of decentralization. Solana has a slightly different definition of decentralization. This goes to the point that we were making the other episode where to me it's not so much about the feature set of decentralization.
00:31:46.906 - 00:32:41.726, Speaker A: We can now move towards how coercion corruption resistant is your protocol. Look at do OFAc sanctioned transactions actually make it through? But I think he has a valid point here. It's like, how much do users care about decentralization? And at some level, that's the meta test of crypto, right? Like, what is bitcoin? It's a big decentralized consensus database. How much do people care about that? Well, what's the value of bitcoin right now? You know what I mean? The entire crypto experiment is finding out some value proposition for decentralization, and you're letting the market. So at some level, it's not about you and I saying, we'd prefer that Solana did it this way or some other chain did it this way. And that's the way Ethereum is doing it. It's not up to us, it's up to the market.
00:32:41.726 - 00:32:54.740, Speaker A: And I recall a conversation that you and I had recently with Chris Berniski, and he was basically like, guys, you have to be comfortable with the new cohort of people that join crypto, not sharing the values that you have.
00:32:55.830 - 00:33:00.246, Speaker B: Which sums up the fight between the Solana community and the Ethereum community so.
00:33:00.268 - 00:33:04.502, Speaker A: Well, I remember hearing that and just being like, yeah, but I want to convince them, right?
00:33:04.556 - 00:33:08.950, Speaker B: And he's like, they need to appreciate centralization.
00:33:10.410 - 00:33:23.690, Speaker A: He's like, no, you'll exhaust yourself doing that. You'll start to sound, like, shrill. You'll start to sound like, okay, boomer, if you overextend that, which is definitely.
00:33:23.760 - 00:33:28.586, Speaker B: The reaction that I tend to get when I give out my Solana hot takes on bankless. Bank takes episodes on Twitter.
00:33:28.618 - 00:33:47.118, Speaker A: There you go. That's it. And that's what I think the bankless community is saying to us and what some of our listeners are saying to it. And what I would say is message received. So here's alchemy. Greg here from the bankless discord saying, I'm honestly getting pretty tired of all the dunking and stoking the fire about Solana from the host. That's you and I, David, on crypto Twitter.
00:33:47.118 - 00:34:08.266, Speaker A: And in the show. I know they get triggered and are ETH maxis for life, but it's coming off pretty unprofessional and childish. No reason both can't exist and succeed in their own right. We all survived the last bull. Let's try to bring more positivity into crypto. I appreciate more coverage of Solana on the pod, but it seems impossible for either of them to just say anything positive. Y'all talk smack, basically.
00:34:08.266 - 00:34:22.910, Speaker A: Is it? Let me just say something positive about Solana. More private keys and more hands. Fantastic. Fantastic. Better user experience onboarding more people to crypto. Fantastic. Many of the builders I've met in this space are absolutely fantastic.
00:34:22.910 - 00:34:31.940, Speaker A: And I would say to alchemy Greg, message received. Okay, so I think we could do.
00:34:33.830 - 00:34:51.020, Speaker B: It goes back to one of the original things I was saying. It's like, well, we come in with a bankless takes episode. We've got our foundation, we've got our theses, and then we export them in a podcaster YouTuber fashion out of our mouths into the microphone. Yes. And we're sometimes, like, YouTube dance monkeys in order to.
00:34:53.790 - 00:34:55.020, Speaker A: Those are my takes.
00:34:55.390 - 00:35:09.920, Speaker B: Those are our takes. The delivery of them is sometimes, like, shrill. We just get riled up. You and I believe in stuff. We really believe in stuff. And that comes out by default. It's kind of just like who we are.
00:35:10.370 - 00:35:23.406, Speaker A: Yes. But I think as investors, we definitely have to be strong conviction. But weekly held as well. Right. Okay. You have to be ready to kind of, in order to survive in crypto.
00:35:23.438 - 00:36:08.894, Speaker B: You need to be able to call bullshit. And perhaps our bullshit senses are not appropriate at this phase of the market, because everyone that we are right now in the inflection point between bear and Bull, and according to the words that we've used previously on the podcast, before all the tourists are gone, all the settlers are here, the people that are clearly in it for the tech are here. Right now in the market is going to be when that's the most true. And sometimes we still have our walls up as if this was. We were still getting attacked by the terra luna frog arm, which, by the way, sometimes I do get harassed by the Solana community. Like, oh, you guys remind me of getting the lunatics army on me. And so we need to do better in our reflections and statements about Solana.
00:36:08.894 - 00:36:32.038, Speaker B: And it's impossible to ask the Solana community, homogeneously, to do the same. But, like, yo, sometimes, just like being on Twitter and then having takes about an antagonistic tribe, you attract some people who are just insane people, and then same kind of thing with a bankless dow incident, there's, like, real signal, and then it just gets lost to the lunatic margins of every single tribe.
00:36:32.134 - 00:37:10.802, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, what I would love to hear from solana as it matures, and by the way, Ethereum, if you go back to the beginning of the last cycle, Ethereum was pretty shit at talking through how you value ETH. There wasn't a good framework. There wasn't a good kind of understanding of it. There wasn't a good narrative of it, and I think we helped with that in trying to understand it. I would love something similar through this. It would be a bull market success story for me if we came out of this and we had something a bit more substantive for value accrual for the sole token.
00:37:10.802 - 00:37:34.586, Speaker A: All right, so your network can have millions of users, and that can all be fantastic. And I would just love to see the early signs of how that accrues back to the sole tokens. Maybe it's Mev, maybe it's monetary premium. I don't know, like some bridge to help speak the language of things that I feel are more grounded in crypto and what I call fundamentals.
00:37:34.698 - 00:37:48.030, Speaker B: For this entire time, give me the triple point asset thesis for Solana, to which some people say, like, thesis. The Solana investment thesis is the triple point asset. It's just at different levels of parameters.
00:37:48.110 - 00:37:49.090, Speaker A: I totally.
00:37:50.230 - 00:37:52.226, Speaker B: Then write that. Somebody write that.
00:37:52.408 - 00:37:59.062, Speaker A: Well, anyway, we'll be on a quest to continue to understand it and. Yeah, I guess those are the takes on the takes episode. I don't know.
00:37:59.116 - 00:38:01.378, Speaker B: We just gave a takes on a takes episode.
00:38:01.474 - 00:38:03.126, Speaker A: Well, so, Dave, here's our takes about.
00:38:03.148 - 00:38:04.342, Speaker B: The takes episode we just did.
00:38:04.396 - 00:38:07.860, Speaker A: My God. Anyway, if anyone appreciates this. Here you go.
