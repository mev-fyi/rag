00:00:06.130 - 00:00:25.154, Speaker A: Hey, bankless nation, it is time for another state of the nation. Super excited about today's episode. This is super scaling with Starkware. We have the two Starkware co founders on. We have Ellie and Yuri of Starkware. We're going to get to that conversation in just a minute. But David, this is the time to bring on Starkware.
00:00:25.154 - 00:00:41.582, Speaker A: I mean, this is ZK rollups, roll up in general are starting to really take off, I think in a big way. Starkware is rolling out some crucial tech. Why is now the time to have Starkware on to tell us about the scalability strategy for Ethereum and blockchains in general?
00:00:41.716 - 00:01:11.446, Speaker B: Yeah, I recently tweeted out that layer two is here. It's just not evenly distributed yet. And some components about Ethereum are super scalable. DoidX is doing more volume than Coinbase. Immutable just released its gaming focus NFT platform and it's already like throwing out the transaction throughputs. The scalability that we all want to see on Ethereum is being built in these different corners. Yet that is the first version of Starkware's product, Starkx.
00:01:11.446 - 00:01:30.986, Speaker B: Starknet is also coming soon. All of these conversations are happening all at once and definitely in the moment of where crypto Twitter just absolutely blew up over Ethereum scalability. It's a fantastic time to bring on Starquare to talk about how scalable ZK rollups can actually be when put on top of a decentralized, permissionless settlement layer that is Ethereum.
00:01:31.098 - 00:02:05.142, Speaker A: Yeah, I feel like the knowledge isn't evenly distributed either. Right? It's like we're doing our part, but a lot of this technology is hard to understand. And so part of what Bankliff is trying to do is break this down into mental models. We put together the modular blockchain podcast and you wrote an article about that. David would refer listeners to that if you want to get a high level overview. But we're now on a journey towards unpacking these ZK scalability type solutions and Starkware is definitely one of the leading ones, one of the ones we are most excited about in the space. So going to be a fascinating conversation.
00:02:05.142 - 00:02:19.550, Speaker A: Stay tuned for that. Also some quick announcements. We dropped a podcast with visa. Visa is going all in on crypto in the crypto space. Other fintechs are following. That was an episode we just dropped on Monday. David, any sneak peek on that app.
00:02:19.700 - 00:02:39.650, Speaker B: Not only visa, but also Anchorage, which is really the emblem of the defi mullet. You got visa in the front, you got anchorage in the back. What is it like to completely redefine what it means to have fintech, fintech based on crypto rails, not central banking rails. So all of that and more in the podcast that came out yesterday on bankless.
00:02:39.730 - 00:03:04.798, Speaker A: There you go. Defi mullet thesis, right? So the mental models just keep flowing out of bankless. Guys, this is crucial stuff for you. Also, we need to give a shout out to Opolis. They're doing some cool stuff these days. They are sponsoring this message. I tell you, David, I've heard this so often, like somebody telling me I'd quit my corporate job, my boring corporate job in a heartbeat, but I can't because I'd lose my health care.
00:03:04.798 - 00:03:41.766, Speaker A: This is, of course, in the US. I know other countries don't have these problems, but this is how they keep you a wage slave. This is how they keep you a member of the corporations, right? You might want to go where your heart is, go towards a Dow, go where the opportunity is, but you lose benefits. Opolis is an organization that services daos that help solve this. They do payroll and they do benefits for daos and for self sovereign workers. We think the future is moving from the gig economy to the ownership economy towards self sovereign workers and provides, provides benefits for those. Anything else you want to say about Opolis, David?
00:03:41.878 - 00:04:12.798, Speaker B: Yeah, this is really the infrastructure that we need to go fully sovereign. And not only when you sign up for Opolis can you start to have healthcare with your other Dow workers, right? These are all the same healthcare. Opolis is like a co op. You guys all get to choose your health care together and we all get to be insured together. And also rates go down as the organization grows up, gets larger. But if you sign up for Opelis, you get a thousand work tokens and a thousand bank tokens if you sign up by the end of this year. And so the work tokens is the tokens of the Opolis network.
00:04:12.798 - 00:04:27.494, Speaker B: Again, it's just like every other dow. If you use it, you become an owner in it. And so Opolis, making sure that all of the infrastructure needed to be workers in the DAO decentralized world are there so that we can actually sustain this ecosystem going forward.
00:04:27.612 - 00:04:36.714, Speaker A: Guys, there's a link in the show notes if you want to get plugged into Opolis. David, I want to start with the question I ask you in every state of the nation. What is the state of the nation today, sir?
00:04:36.832 - 00:05:00.514, Speaker B: I've done this one before, but I'm doing it again today. We are building and the Sarquar team has been super hard at work building out ZK tech for everyone on Ethereum to use. As we go through a weekend of drama and FUD, the only answer to really any of that shenanigans is to just keep on building. And that is exactly what we are doing here on the state of the nations we are building today.
00:05:00.632 - 00:05:11.318, Speaker A: I want to find out from the starware team if they are abandoning Ethereum. My guess is their answer is no, but we will get into that in just a minute. Before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:05:11.484 - 00:06:01.558, Speaker B: Arbitrum is an Ethereum scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use DFI, and now it's live with over 100 projects deployed, gas fees on the Ethereum l one sucks. Too many people want to use Ethereum, and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us. And that's why teams like Arbitrum have been hard at work developing layer two solutions that makes transactions on Ethereum cheap and instant. Arbitrum increases Ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude, at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying. When interacting with arbitrum, you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into Ethereum's level of security and decentralization. That's why people are calling this Ethereum's broadband moment, where we get to add performance onto decentralization and security. If you're a developer and you want to save on gas costs and overall make a better experience for your users, go to developer offchainlabs.com
00:06:01.558 - 00:06:33.610, Speaker B: to get started building on Arbitrum. If you're a user, keep an eye out for your favorite DFI apps. Building on arbitrum many DFI applications that are on the Ethereum layer one are migrating over to layer twos like Arbitrum, and some are even skipping over layer ones and deploying directly on layer twos. There are so many apps coming online to Arbitrum. So go to Bridge Arbitrum IO and start bridging over your ether or any of the tokens listed, and start having a DeFi experience that you've always wanted. Living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys. Not your keys, not your crypto.
00:06:33.610 - 00:07:09.814, Speaker B: That's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallet, which makes proper private key management a breeze. But the ledger ecosystem is much more than just a secure hardware wallet. Ledger is the combination of the ledger hardware wallet and the Ledger Live app. And if you're used to seeing all of your crypto services and favorite defi apps all in one spot. Ledger live is where you want to be. Not only does Ledger let you buy your crypto assets straight from the app, but it also hooks into all of the defi apps and services that you're used to using Ledger Live. You can stake your Ethan Lido, swap on dexes like Paraswap, or display your nfts with Rainbow.
00:07:09.814 - 00:07:36.920, Speaker B: You can also use wallet Connect inside of Ledger Live to connect to all the other defi apps that keep coming online. Defi never stops growing, and the Ledger Live app grows alongside with it. So click the link in the show notes to see all of the defi apps that Ledger Live has. And stay tuned as more apps come online. And if you don't have a Ledger hardware wallet, what are you even waiting for? Go to ledger.com, grab a ledger, download Ledger live, and get all of your Defi apps all in one space.
00:07:38.570 - 00:07:50.300, Speaker A: Guys, we are back with the Starkware team. Pleased to introduce you to Ellie from Starquare, co founder of Starkware. Also Yuri, co founder of Starkware. Gentlemen, great to have you on. Bakelis, how are you doing today?
00:07:50.670 - 00:07:52.780, Speaker C: Hi, guys. Thanks for having us.
00:07:53.870 - 00:08:29.030, Speaker A: Well, we are super excited to dig into everything that Starquare is doing in this space. And we're excited because this is really kind of the scalability answer, I think, to crypto and to blockchains, and you guys are really delivering it and ramping up the delivery of it. So we're going to talk about Starkx, Starknet, everything that you're delivering. But first, we want to congratulate you on this massive series C fundraise. So it's a $50 million fundraise, a $2 billion valuation. Congrats on that. How does it feel to be on the other side of this fundraise?
00:08:30.330 - 00:08:56.302, Speaker C: Well, the series C was done with Sequoia. They've been our investors and close collaborators since our series a going back to 2018. So we've known Mike and the Sequoia team well, and that made for a very simple and sort of easy process. So, regardless, we're happy to have this sort of milestone behind us.
00:08:56.436 - 00:09:00.160, Speaker D: I want to say that it's better to be on this side than on the site before.
00:09:02.610 - 00:09:28.380, Speaker B: Guys, there are so many different things that we want to dive into with everything, with Starkware. But first, you guys have a lot of things that are named Stark something. And so at the start of this podcast, we want to go in and actually label and define these things, because we're going to be referring to them more and more throughout the rest of the podcast. So there's Starkware, there's Starkx, there's Starknet. Can you guys define and delineate between these three things for us?
00:09:28.750 - 00:09:29.498, Speaker D: Sure.
00:09:29.664 - 00:10:27.420, Speaker C: So first of all, Starks, Starks were co invented by two of my co founders, Michael Briapsev, who's our chief architect and got his phd under Ellie before co founding Starkware with us and with Alessandro Chiesa. They're co inventors of Starks. That's the zero knowledge protocol that we're using in our software stack. Starkx was our first product, and this is a permissioned, standalone, customizable scaling engine that runs over Ethereum. And this powers immutable X and Sorre and Dydx and diversify and soon will power seller as well. Starknet is our permissionless, decentralized CK rollup. And the alpha has been live on a public testnet since mid June and is going live on Mainnet Ethereum before the end of this month.
00:10:28.370 - 00:11:13.034, Speaker B: So just to reiterate that Starkx are these multiple scaling chains that are app specific, right? So Dydx is using an app specific ZK technology platform, which we call Starkx, and also diversify is also using this, and so rare is also using this and immutable. But then Starknet is maybe a little bit more what users might be familiar with when it comes to optimism or arbitrum. One where there's one canonical chain that is permissionless to build on and everyone can build on that that is not let yet live, but has been in Alpha since early June. And maybe we have some announcements coming soon about its release date, maybe is all of that.
00:11:13.232 - 00:11:38.930, Speaker C: Yeah, so as I mentioned, it's been on a public testnet since mid June. It's coming to Maine at Ethereum before the end of this month. I should just one minor correction. The Starkx instances are not chains. They are essentially applications, services, scaling services powered by the Starkx cloud service running over Ethereum.
00:11:39.590 - 00:11:48.870, Speaker B: Okay, let's unpack that a little bit. They're not a blockchain. So why is it not a blockchain where the differences lie? And how does it actually achieve scale?
00:11:53.210 - 00:12:51.830, Speaker D: Elite, do you want to. So I think what defines a blockchain? I mean, there are several things, there's no formal definition, but it's very permissionless. Everyone can come submit transactions and it's something that basically the public sort of runs and uses. And Starkx, as you said, a line of products that each one of them is sort of a backend that services one particular customer. That is another business that is customer facing. So Dydx, it's an exchange that faces customers, and it uses a technology stack that is Starkx. It basically uses the ZK stark technology in order to compress computation and achieve computational integrity without any trust, but for trust in math and trust in the blockchain.
00:12:51.830 - 00:13:12.846, Speaker D: So it's sort of an interface and a settlement layer that's very specific to a customer. That's Starkx. So I think it would be a stretch to call it a blockchain. It is more an interface and a settlement layer and sort of something that boosts up the capacity of some other blockchain. And in all of these cases, it's.
00:13:12.878 - 00:13:16.100, Speaker C: Ethereum, a compression service, if you will.
00:13:17.110 - 00:13:26.600, Speaker B: Okay, a compression service. Right. So you guys talked about said the word cloud, who is actually operating the compression service? Is that you guys?
00:13:27.050 - 00:13:27.462, Speaker D: Yes.
00:13:27.516 - 00:13:29.846, Speaker C: For Starkx, it is correct.
00:13:30.028 - 00:13:30.422, Speaker D: Okay.
00:13:30.476 - 00:13:38.762, Speaker C: For Starknet, it will eventually be a fully decentralized network where anyone could function as a sequencer improver on the network, okay?
00:13:38.816 - 00:13:40.380, Speaker D: Hopefully including you. And.
00:13:43.070 - 00:13:54.880, Speaker B: Is Starkx, is this technology that you guys have in your own cloud that you guys run and you guys allow people like DyDx or so rare or immutable to tap into that service?
00:13:56.450 - 00:13:57.246, Speaker A: Yes. Okay.
00:13:57.348 - 00:14:12.290, Speaker B: And then Starknet is that same sort of service, but more streamlined and just made more available for everyone. And rather than have it being on one single cloud, is Starknet an actual blockchain?
00:14:12.870 - 00:14:57.694, Speaker D: It's closer to it. And there's another distinction. So Starkx is sort of crafted towards a very small number of special purpose use cases that are extremely important. For instance, dealing with a massive amount of payments, very high TPS, like for a payment processor. Another example is a massive amount of trades or perpetual swaps and positions, or minting of nfts. So it caters to things where you have very high demand, but for very specific functionalities. Now, Starknet, in addition to being permissionless, it is also a platform that is turing complete and universal, very much like Ethereum.
00:14:57.694 - 00:15:48.706, Speaker D: So it means that instead of us saying, okay, you can do one of four or five things that our customers really want, like minting, trading, transferring, blah, blah, blah. Basically it says, okay, anyone can write any kind of logic for any purpose they want. It could be generative art, it could be compressing many votes, it could be some game design, it could be a whole number of things that we don't actually know what they are. We basically invented and then designed and offered tooling for writing any smart contract deploying it submitting transactions to it. So instead of limited functionality for these things that are in high demand, it is this general purpose framework. So it's closer to a blockchain. It's not quite a blockchain because it's a layer two, right? So I think blockchains are more layer one.
00:15:48.706 - 00:15:56.440, Speaker D: So just like optimism and arbitrum, I don't think they're described as blockchains. They are layer twos. We are also a proud layer two.
00:15:57.850 - 00:16:26.320, Speaker C: I wanted to add to that a very important feature that Starknet has had for a while and will have on mainnet by the end of this month is composability. And this is something that a lot of DAP developers care deeply for. This allows for this money, Lego or NFT Lego or smart contract Lego to thrive and have this amazingly accelerated and open development framework that developers enjoy so much.
00:16:26.850 - 00:17:01.610, Speaker A: This is super cool and I'm surprised as we're going through these names that Tony Stark wasn't involved somehow because this is super advanced tech. But I'm sure you get that joke all the time. Can we talk a little bit about the Starkx first? Because want to just cover that scalability now really with Starkware is kind of the conversation. Then I definitely want to spend the bulk of the conversation talking about Starknet because that is the next thing that is coming. As you said, you're releasing to mainet the end of this month. So we're close to the end of this month. We are breathless with anticipation here.
00:17:01.610 - 00:17:54.518, Speaker A: But let's talk about Starkx first because there is this impression in the space and we just saw it last weekend. Okay, literally last weekend. I don't know if you guys hang out on Twitter at all, but the Twitter world was a buz with this idea that Ethereum is not scaling today, that there is no scalability on Ethereum today. Hence the need for all of these other alternative layer one solutions. And there were a lot of things I wanted to say, but one of the things I wanted to say was, of course it's scaling today, right? Look at what Starkx is doing, look at what DyDx is doing, look at what diversify is doing. Look at what so rare is doing. Immutable x scaling using this compression layer, this layer two on Ethereum today now, app specific for now, but later this can be more generalized in something like a Starknet.
00:17:54.518 - 00:18:16.834, Speaker A: But can you talk about that a little bit? Because I don't think people understand or appreciate the numbers here and what's actually being done across, say the big four Starkx applications today, DyDx diversify. So rare, immutable. Do you guys have any numbers here or any sort of metrics on what's happening, how this is scaling so far?
00:18:16.872 - 00:19:18.050, Speaker C: Yuri, why don't you, you know, DYDx would be, I think, one sort of remarkable case study that we could point to, the transactions that DyDx used to do on layer one. Each transaction composing of two trades, a couple of markets only those were around 250,000 gas, maybe 280,000 gas per transaction. The transactions they're doing today on Starkx touch many more assets. They have the ability now you can put up collateral against many more positions. And so it's a far more complicated transaction. We estimate that equivalent transaction on layer one, it will have consumed about 600,000 gas per transaction. Those transactions today in production on Starkx consume sub 500 gas, not 500,000 gas, sub 500 gas per transaction.
00:19:18.130 - 00:19:18.518, Speaker A: Wow.
00:19:18.604 - 00:20:06.978, Speaker C: Now we're talking about, this isn't a demo, and this isn't like a nice sort of case study that we ran for an hour and that brought down, this is day in, day out. The past 24 hours were at 10 billion, I believe, trading volume for DYDX at the end of another one of their fabulous epochs. Cumulative to date, over 230,000,000,000. B as in boy dollar settled on Ethereum, Starkx, in total, over 55 million transactions. Dy DX is probably around half that in total. So a very, very dramatic scaling today. Already on Ethereum, our estimate at 600,000 gas, that's about 300,000 gas per trade.
00:20:06.978 - 00:20:22.330, Speaker C: That's roughly three tps, would have consumed all of Ethereum's layer one capacity. Okay, we're doing on a very regular basis, 15 times that on Starkx.
00:20:22.670 - 00:20:46.210, Speaker D: Yeah. This is just to show what we're talking about. So this is the TPS, the effective TPS that we're seeing. I hope you see my screen share. This is the effective TPS over the past 24 hours. So you see, it's like on average, I'd say on the DyDX system. So this is like, on average, a TPS of seven with peaks at 13 tps.
00:20:46.210 - 00:21:04.120, Speaker D: And again, as we just mentioned, the effective TPS. If all of Ethereum would have been consumed for just settling these trades, Ethereum wouldn't be able to settle this many. It can handle a TPS of, I guess, one.
00:21:06.110 - 00:21:10.700, Speaker A: At its peak, basically. Dy DX is another ethereum, right?
00:21:11.150 - 00:21:13.638, Speaker C: It's multiple ethereums.
00:21:13.734 - 00:21:14.380, Speaker A: Wow.
00:21:16.270 - 00:21:36.270, Speaker D: That's just one of our systems. And it's consuming on a regular basis over the past 24 hours, we haven't looked at the numbers, but it's going to be less than 1% of Ethereum's gas while doing something like five x or whatever. Two to five x. The capacity of all of Ethereum and consuming 1% of the gas.
00:21:36.930 - 00:21:51.640, Speaker A: Yes. And I want to get to so rare and immutable in a second too. But what we just said, that is scalability, right? This is why I feel like there's such a narrative mismatch in the market and in crypto Twitter these days. And it's a very bizarre world we're in right now.
00:21:52.170 - 00:22:10.910, Speaker B: Just to recap, there are multiple ethereums, perhaps two to five ethereums worth of capacity that is being settled on Ethereum by Dydx. And what you guys said is less than 1% of Ethereum's capacity. So two to five ethereums being compressed down to just 1% of Ethereum's capacity.
00:22:13.170 - 00:22:28.130, Speaker C: On one of our systems. But I want to emphasize that we're not supporting two to five because that's what we can support. We're supporting two to five because that's the demand, right? We can support substantially, substantially more multiples of that easily today.
00:22:28.200 - 00:22:32.194, Speaker B: And so when I said that would.
00:22:32.232 - 00:22:43.366, Speaker D: Probably be another, I don't know how many, but like another five to ten ethereums we minted, I forgot how many million nfts over the past half year, probably again, that would have consumed, I.
00:22:43.388 - 00:22:48.038, Speaker C: Think, about 25 million nfts over the past.
00:22:48.204 - 00:22:50.794, Speaker A: Are we talking about so rare or immutable now or both of them?
00:22:50.832 - 00:22:52.042, Speaker C: Both of them. Both of them.
00:22:52.096 - 00:22:55.194, Speaker A: Cross both of them. Okay, give us those stats again so we don't miss them.
00:22:55.232 - 00:22:59.882, Speaker C: About, I think, 24, 25 million nfts minted to date.
00:23:00.016 - 00:23:00.698, Speaker B: Wow.
00:23:00.864 - 00:23:02.474, Speaker D: Take a few million here.
00:23:02.592 - 00:23:03.674, Speaker B: That's a few million.
00:23:03.792 - 00:23:05.230, Speaker A: So we're not the start of this show.
00:23:05.300 - 00:23:33.206, Speaker B: When I said that at the beginning of the show, that scalability here is just not evenly distributed yet. This is what I'm talking about. Dydx, hyperscalability. It's just people are expecting this thing to be happening everywhere, equally across the board. But no, we are getting hyperscalability at sub one penny transactions in very specific examples and applications. Yeah. And I think Starkx is bringing, I.
00:23:33.228 - 00:24:00.990, Speaker C: Want to stress this, these are production systems. So both surbear and immutable are working in validium mode where they chose to have an off chain data solution. Starkx employed as an off chain data solution because they wanted reasonable gas cost per mint. We are minting batches of 600,000 nfts at sub ten gas per mint. Once again, ten gas, not 10,000 gas.
00:24:01.410 - 00:24:19.830, Speaker A: Wow, that's incredible. Yeah. And I think bankless listeners will be familiar with what a validium is, because we've talked about that. We did an episode on modular blockchains that kind of talked about and touched on all of these differences. But that's basically modular blockchain. If you kind of break it up, consensus data and then execution. Right.
00:24:19.830 - 00:24:49.006, Speaker A: You're talking about a validium uses, not Ethereum for its data layer, uses Ethereum for its consensus layer, but it uses something else for its data layer. And a volition, of course, is when a chain kind of has the choice, an application has the choice. I want to ask about this because this is a question. Incredible. Extreme scalability. Super scalability, as we said, is happening right now. Are there any trade offs here? Refresh us on this.
00:24:49.006 - 00:24:57.282, Speaker A: We're still camping on Starkx right now. But what are the tradeoffs here with Starkx from a decentralization perspective? Ellie, what would you say?
00:24:57.336 - 00:25:39.246, Speaker D: Yeah, there are actually many trade offs that are behind the scenes. I'll just mention a few of them. So if you want latency to be smaller, meaning, so what would entail. So, right now, we're basically taking a very large number of transactions, and you need a very long time for them to accumulate, and then you're producing one single proof for that. So you need also a lot of computation to get that thing. So what you get is you're increasing latency, which is bad, but you're decreasing and minimizing amortized gas cost per transaction because the larger the batch. That's basically what the magic of Starks give you.
00:25:39.246 - 00:26:34.238, Speaker D: The larger the batch, the lower the amortized cost per transaction will be. Okay, so one very clear trade off is that as we grow the batch sizes, all things considered, latency grows, but amortized gas cost goes down. Another thing is that as you. Yeah, I think that's probably the most important trade off. There are other internal trade offs in our system. For instance, if we wanted to keep, if you kept the same batch size and latency and everything, but you actually wanted the on chain proof to be smaller, you would pay with off chain computation, because there are various mathematical parameters you can play with there. And that's another trade off that we have at our disposal.
00:26:34.238 - 00:26:40.980, Speaker D: Buy a bigger machine, have even more latency, and even for a fixed batch size, you can decrease that.
00:26:42.630 - 00:27:18.014, Speaker C: There's an obvious trade off in the context of data availability. If you want to operate in roll up mode, your data is on chain. It is no doubt more secure. It is no doubt more expensive. The beauty of the volition solution, which is coming online in a matter of weeks, is that this decision will be handed off from the app to the user. And so the user can decide on a transaction by transaction basis if they care enough for security to pay that premium of on chain data.
00:27:18.132 - 00:27:27.202, Speaker B: Will it literally just be like a drop down menu where it says, here's my transaction, I want it stored on chain, or I want it stored off chain? It'll be just that simple.
00:27:27.336 - 00:27:28.386, Speaker A: Here are the costs, right?
00:27:28.408 - 00:27:32.034, Speaker B: And it'll have two different costs associated with pretty.
00:27:32.072 - 00:27:34.478, Speaker C: That's pretty fantastic indeed.
00:27:34.654 - 00:28:00.590, Speaker A: Ellie, can we go over that latency trade off again? So it's like, I kind of understand that, but what is the trade off that an individual user is making with? I have, if there's higher latency, how does that affect the, I guess, security position for an individual user? Does that just mean things get settled to ethereum less frequently so there's a longer window of time where they're potentially vulnerable?
00:28:00.930 - 00:29:22.262, Speaker D: That's a terrific question. So, currently on StarkX, this is very much abstracted away, and the risk of this window is taken by our customers, Dydx, diversify, mutable and so on. Now, what does it mean? It means that you as a user, and I'm assuming that many of your listeners have used some of these systems, Dydx, so they probably notice that they have instant finality. And even if they want to basically go retrieve all their funds on chain, they get it very quickly. Now, this does not mean that the relevant Stark proofs happen with the same finality, but what is happening is something like this dy Dx, which gets these orders and settles them, and matches them and calculates the positions, knows that once it settles something or did something, it basically now goes into this stack or queue, which is controlled by Dydx. And it will take some time for a batch to reach enough size for it to be convenient to put in a proof and then for the proof to be generated and accepted on chain. And currently for DydX, for instance, with its very large proofs, this is a number of hours, but the user doesn't experience any of that.
00:29:22.262 - 00:30:27.514, Speaker D: What's happening is that Dydx is essentially assuming whatever risks are associated with that. And I think they made a wise choice. The risks are relatively small because they know that something that has been settled will appear in a proof and that approve will be accepted on chain, and basically they know what the next state of the. So it's a little bit like, I think in traditional trading, a lot know settlement is t plus three, but a lot of exchanges will sort of assume the risk for three days. With a case of DyDX and other customers, it's a small number of hours, and again, it's in their control. For instance, DyDX could decide that it wants to close a batch every, whatever, two minutes, and then the proof would probably be much quicker to generate and would go on chain much quicker. So maybe the latency from DyDX's side would not be hours but minutes, but then the cost would be that the amortized gas cost per transaction would be higher because the amortization is over a smaller number.
00:30:27.514 - 00:30:42.122, Speaker D: So most of our customers have chosen to basically crank the knob to maximal batch size, minimal amortized gas cost, but also maximal latency, which is a wise choice, we think.
00:30:42.276 - 00:30:56.166, Speaker B: But when a bunch of more users come and deploy more transactions at a higher rate, you guys can actually increase the rate at which these settle to ethereum without also increasing the per user gas costs, is that correct?
00:30:56.348 - 00:31:44.290, Speaker C: For sure. And we can do that thanks to a remarkable technology called Sharp, which stands for shared prover. And this is a technology that's in production today, serving at the moment so rare and immutable and diversify. And hopefully DyDX will be added soon to this system. And sharp basically relies on the fact that all of these systems run on Cairo, or a zero knowledge proof programming language. And a Cairo program can describe any logic, any application logic that one wants to implement. It can also implement a sequence of application logic, and that sequence can be immutables logic, followed by Samar's logic, followed by diversifies, and so on and so forth.
00:31:44.290 - 00:32:26.654, Speaker C: So you can bundle all these transactions and all these completely disparate applications into a single proof, okay? And now this proof can be verified once on Ethereum, meaning all these applications can amortize their gas verification cost across sort of the Cairo ecosystem. Now imagine if Ryan is launching a new game and it has just a few users. He's just started out not terribly sort of big, yet from day one, he's benefiting from the marginal cost of the entire Cairo ecosystem, the entire sharp ecosystem. And so that is a huge cost saver for low bandwidth applications.
00:32:26.782 - 00:33:16.606, Speaker A: That's fascinating, because that creates such a virtuous cycle, because now here I am with my small game here, and I'm incented to bring David's game in too, because I want him to share in the costs, the whole thing. And it also breeds some network effects, too, I would assume, where everyone wants to kind of camp out in the same location to spread these costs, we would assume for. So, okay, can I just zoom out for a minute? Because I feel like part of the narrative around Ethereum not scaling these other things is like. Let's talk a little bit about your approach to scalability, because I think this is fundamental for people to understand. It's very math heavy. We call this a compression technology. And we did an episode with Justin Drake called Moon Math cryptography.
00:33:16.606 - 00:33:50.474, Speaker A: And basically, the whole thesis of the episode was, hey, these blockchains are trust machines. And the way to scale them up, to get a giant leap from one generation of the computer to the next, is actually not just creating bigger blocks and bigger block sizes. It's actually cryptography. That's the technology that scales these trust machines. Right. And so, to me, it seems like stark and zero knowledge. This is a big advance in terms of cryptography technology.
00:33:50.474 - 00:34:25.478, Speaker A: And the key to all of these unlocks that you're talking about. So, not asking you to get into the moon math or the specifics, that would be probably, definitely beyond David and I and beyond many in the audience. But can you just talk about this philosophy? Because this is a different path to scalability than I think we're seeing with a lot of alternative chains, which are increasing blockchain size, like creating more complexity and difficulty in running validators. You guys are scaling with math and cryptography. Can you talk about that for a minute? Ellie, what would you say about that?
00:34:25.644 - 00:35:40.894, Speaker D: Yeah, I completely agree with Justin that blockchains are about being a trust machine. And I would add to that that the reason we trust them currently is that everyone and anyone can participate in validating that all transactions are good, and they can do so using very simple, off the shelf computational means. So, here's a bad way to scale. What if we just ten x whatever the gas limit of a block on Ethereum, or increase the block size on bitcoin? So what would happen is that there are machines that could process ten x more, but it's probably not going to be my laptop, the one that I'm using to talk to you. And very quickly, you'll just have a very small system of very big computers that process at very high tps. Some so called blockchains are already doing that, and whether they are decentralized and trustworthy is open to debate. Certainly, the conventional normie world has been doing this for a very long time.
00:35:40.894 - 00:36:55.950, Speaker D: I'm sure that banks and credit card companies have very big data centers, but blockchains don't want to do that. They want to continue and maintain inclusive accountability that allows each and every one of us to use our laptop to check that everything's okay. So what are we going to do? Well, there's this amazing math that started in the 1980s, and we're not going to describe how it works, but to quote from one of the very earliest papers in this field, I'm probably misquoting the exact thing. I can find it later. But it says that using this technology again, that was invented already in the 1980s, even a single weak computer can monitor and track a computation done by a herd of supercomputing computers, even if they are run on faulty hardware by malicious parties. So it's a very. Cryptography is this amazing, powerful technology that allows even the weakest of computational devices to monitor and know with very high certainty that a huge computer run by an evil government even has been executing with integrity.
00:36:55.950 - 00:37:38.626, Speaker D: And this is completely mind boggling. The little man can basically check and know that some huge corporation, monopoly, or government is operating correctly because of the power of cryptography. Now, this was already known. Some parts of it were known in the 1980s. What was not known was how to make this really efficient and tractable. And that's, I think, where a lot of the inventions coming from Starquare, really help in, first of all, making it practical on today's computers and more recently, making it available to programmers. I just read today someone that wrote, here's my experience of working on Starknet.
00:37:38.626 - 00:38:03.822, Speaker D: And the very first sentence is, you do not need to know anything about the math of Starks. It's all been abstracted away. You just have a programming language and you write your code and you press a button. So you just program as a developer, no math, no nothing, and you get this very low gas cost and the integrity offered by some magic that is.
00:38:03.876 - 00:38:21.378, Speaker A: Behind the scenes incredible, by the way. I just got to say, it's like cryptography is just what a gift to humanity, right? All of the technologies that we can unlock at this juncture in humanity, we get this freedom technology that we've just unlocked. What a gift to humanity it is.
00:38:21.544 - 00:39:00.320, Speaker B: So one part before we get into the conversation of Starkneck, which we definitely want to go to next, it's really fantastic that you guys have abstracted away all of this complex technology and just allowed people to build with this coding language and APIs. The other side of that spectrum is like, well, if you guys are just making it super easy. You guys are centralizing all of the development onto your cloud server. So there's this one cloud server that's doing all of this central processing for these many, many systems. So what happens in the case where the police force of the united of the world come and knock on your door and says, we'll unplug the server? What happens in that case?
00:39:00.870 - 00:39:34.342, Speaker D: Well, if it happens before we decentralize, which would be in a small number of months, then, yes, maybe we'll just release everything before we go out with the police to some undisclosed location. But the plan and the hope we certainly believe this will be the case is that within a very small number of months, it won't be Starcore operating these things. The code will be available, and many, many operators, including you and Ryan, will be running it, just like with Ethereum.
00:39:34.486 - 00:39:47.518, Speaker B: So kind of in that way, where we talked about having the drop down menu of where you deploy your data, might you have a drop down menus like, oh, I want Starkware to run my server, or I want to run my server? Like, you guys probably will do both?
00:39:47.684 - 00:40:08.598, Speaker D: Well, like Ethereum, you don't get to choose your miner. There's some consensus thing that picks the next. So something like that. You'll send it to some network, peer to peer network, and there'll be some mechanisms by which a decentralized network of approvers and sequencers will pick it up and it will be accepted. You don't choose which one, but I think that's probably even better.
00:40:08.764 - 00:40:13.250, Speaker C: You're not burdened with that. You just send your transactions to the network, Ethereum style.
00:40:13.410 - 00:40:26.682, Speaker B: Wait, so is this now what you guys are talking about right now? Is that Starknet, or is that something. Okay, exactly. So we've actually gotten into the Starknet. Okay, can you guys talk about the evolution from Starkx into Starknet? How is that transition going to.
00:40:26.816 - 00:40:55.182, Speaker A: And I'm actually, as you're speaking, I'm actually going to bring up this diagram that I've seen in a lot of your documents that kind of illustrates it. And, yeah. So for people who can't see this on the podcast, there's three steps. And over the top, there's 2021 and 2022. And this is kind of the Starkware roadmap, as I see it. And the Starknet roadmap, to be more specific. The first step is planets that says single operators, single app roll ups.
00:40:55.182 - 00:41:20.000, Speaker A: The second step is constellations, single operators, multi app roll ups. These two steps are both in 2021, and then the third step in 2022 is the universe, which is decentralized operators moving from single operators to decentralized and multi app roll ups as well. So, with that context, too. Yeah, to David's question.
00:41:20.770 - 00:42:04.170, Speaker C: So planets is essentially Stark X, right? These are single operators, sorre, immutable x, diversify, DydX, they're each running a single app roll up, and that's been in production. Three of these systems went live in April. The numbers we quoted earlier, exceeding 50 million, transactions settled, et cetera. This is across all these systems, constellations is essentially what's coming in a few days time, and that is a single operator. In the context of the Starknet system. Initially, much like the optimistic roll up playbook. Optimism, arbitrum, we're following in the footsteps of our very talented colleagues in the roll up space.
00:42:04.170 - 00:42:40.258, Speaker C: Starting with a single node operated by us, it will be a multi app roll up. This goes back to the composability point that I made earlier. So folks would be able to deploy their smart contract on this, invoke one another's smart contracts, and you would have a single roll up with all these applications running on top of it. And universe, which is coming next year, is the fully decentralized vision, where the operator, namely the sequencer, improver functions, are fully decentralized. And all this bliss is shared across multiple applications, sharing estates, invoking one another, et cetera.
00:42:40.434 - 00:42:49.100, Speaker B: So, on the step two, the constellations is this, where immutable and Dydx will actually find themselves on the same roll up.
00:42:49.870 - 00:43:31.480, Speaker C: So that is a separate question of if and when the Starkx instances currently running choose to port and move over and run over Starknet. But for constellations, we're talking about, for example, teams like Zigzag, which is building a decentralized exchange that announced that they're going to be launching in a matter of days on Starknet and influence etH, a wonderfully talented team building a game. These will all deploy on Starknet and coexist there and be able to invoke one.
00:43:33.930 - 00:43:34.294, Speaker B: Ahead.
00:43:34.332 - 00:43:35.638, Speaker A: Go ahead, David. Okay, you go.
00:43:35.724 - 00:44:03.060, Speaker B: So the conversation that we've been having in the space, the space has been having, and I know a number of people that are confused by this point, the ZK roll up bulls think that ZK roll up EVM powered ZK roll ups are going to be here in six months. The optimistic roll up bulls think that the development and infrastructure needed to make ZkevM roll ups isn't going to be here for three to five years. What's going on? What's true?
00:44:04.630 - 00:44:49.514, Speaker C: Unfortunately, Vitalik published a post in early 2021 this year announcing that DK roll ups are the long term solution, that they're coming in three to five years up. As we apologized already a few weeks ago, we're sort of ahead of schedule. This tooling is here now. In fact, it's been on a public testnet since the middle of June. Supports general computation, supports composability. There's still a ton of work to be done, and it's being done as we speak. If folks hop on the Starknet discord, they'll see a very thriving ecosystem of tooling and infrastructure that's being built in a decentralized fashion by dozens of developers outside of starkware.
00:44:49.514 - 00:45:25.654, Speaker C: Of course, Starkware itself is contributing a significant amount of talent and resources into this, but all this tooling is being built on a week by week basis and making tremendous progress in that respect. So we are able today to support essentially any application that wishes to build on top of Starknet. And in fact, what we're already seeing is people doing stuff that is just completely out of bounds on layer one. So to give a couple of examples. Guilty. Gioza. Just a brilliant programmer who's doing all these sort of physics simulations on Starknet.
00:45:25.654 - 00:45:54.790, Speaker C: Now, some people know what is that good for? I think that's almost a silly question in the sense that the question is not what is it good for? The question is, why aren't sort of people registering the fact that any computation, any computation that one chooses to do is now suddenly within the breach of blockchain developers. Whereas when we were limited to layer one, it was a very sort of resource constrained environment.
00:45:55.450 - 00:46:17.050, Speaker A: So, Yuri, I just want to just highlight the answer to that question is, you're saying it's here now. You're saying general purpose ZK roll ups are here now ahead of schedule. And that last phrase, ahead of schedule, that's not something we hear very often in crypto.
00:46:18.610 - 00:46:23.086, Speaker D: Okay, folks, making those statements, consult with us now.
00:46:23.108 - 00:46:24.000, Speaker B: That's fine.
00:46:27.330 - 00:47:12.110, Speaker D: It's well known that making predictions about the future is very hard. And if you're trying to predict something about a field of expertise, it would be prudent to go and ask some of the experts what they think. So you have two of the experts? It's not a prediction. We have how many? Four systems running, many of them for more than a year. We just saw the numbers now with general computation on ethereum scaling it, as you mentioned, two or three ethereums, each one of them today. Not three to five years, not six months. This is something that happened in the past, now, next week sometime.
00:47:12.110 - 00:47:31.010, Speaker D: Starknet Alpha. It's already in testnet, but general computation, same sort of scale, available to everyone. Next time you want to make predictions about ZK roll ups, you know where to find us. Dm us, check with us before making the prediction.
00:47:34.230 - 00:47:46.854, Speaker A: This is great. Look. This is incredible. You won't find a single person listening who will be disappointed that you just said that. Okay. We feel like with crypto, in terms of scalability, we've been disappointed too many times. Right.
00:47:46.854 - 00:48:21.106, Speaker A: Which is like, when teams talk about dates and the shipping, it always seems to slip by. Now you guys are shipping. Yeah. So you guys are shipping. You have it. So can we talk about what then is shipping next week? Right, like what? Exactly? So understand it's a general purpose version of Starknet. Are there any applications that are launching? Is it going to be permissionless at launch? So can any team decide to start building on top of this, or is there going to be a phased rollout, some sort of whitelist? Yeah.
00:48:21.106 - 00:48:24.598, Speaker A: Give us some more details on what's shipping next week.
00:48:24.764 - 00:48:25.480, Speaker C: Sure.
00:48:25.850 - 00:48:52.650, Speaker D: We'll link a post with a lot of disclaimers on what is not in there. So there's a lot of things that we're very meticulous in pointing out. We don't want to make false statements, but we'll share. There's a lot that will be missing initially next week. Account abstraction won't be there. ERC 20 tokens. It will be very hard to deal with fees.
00:48:52.650 - 00:49:29.420, Speaker D: A lot of things will be missing, but there will be applications. And in terms of deploying, anyone can submit a contract initially for computational purposes. So the system might be buggy and not running as well as we want. We will do a whitelisting process, just like arbitram and optimism and other l two s to ensure that our system is not crashing and this will be removed later on. I'll find the link.
00:49:30.670 - 00:50:24.070, Speaker C: I want to just mention some of the folks who are building, and some of these will launch with the alpha, some in the weeks following the Starnet Alpha launch. I want to reiterate what Ellie said. This is called Alpha for a reason, and we strongly urge everyone to sort of proceed with caution. Our training wheels are on. We're all sort of figuring this out together, so we want people to fully appreciate that fact. But some of the ecosystem that's being built around Starknet, so we have the Nethermind team who are building the warp transpiler, and the Voyager block explorer Openzeppelin, who are defining the standard contracts for Starknet. Last time they defined that, that was for this blockchain called Ethereum.
00:50:24.070 - 00:51:00.050, Speaker C: The Aragon and equilibrium teams who are building full nodes figment who are building API services argent who are building tooling and a wallet. The Taurus wallet ledger, who are building an application to go live soon. The Shardlabs team building tooling. The UK front end team. Multiple bunch of applications. So just to name a few. Snapshot, announced recently that Starkvote.
00:51:00.050 - 00:51:40.450, Speaker C: We're building Starkvote together. So this is to make voting for daos once again sort of open to the general public and exercise for the wealthy Wales. There are multiple games being built first and foremost. There's sort of the wonderful Parama, who was really one of the very first folks to start building on Starknet, building dope wars. And another surprise sort of game that will be announced very soon. The proof of humanity team guilty Gioza who we mentioned the influence team who are moving their wonderfully interesting game from layer one. Ethereum bricks clan.
00:51:40.450 - 00:52:17.710, Speaker C: The Starknet JS framework by Sean Hans Exchange we mentioned the QSAR team maker has a core unit moving sort of maker or deploying maker on Starknet and hopefully one day soon minting dai on Starknet. And rumor has it, just following crypto Twitter, that some core devs of Aave are looking into building an Ave version on Starknet. So as you can see, there is an awful lot going on. So I can't sort of give you exact dates of each one of these things, but we're talking weeks here.
00:52:17.860 - 00:52:18.366, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:52:18.468 - 00:52:19.822, Speaker C: These things to start rolling out.
00:52:19.876 - 00:52:38.550, Speaker A: This is fantastic. And I'm wondering if you could kind of project forward six months for us. Right. It's like getting into a user's head, right? So all of those apps sound wonderful. If they're deployed on Starknet, that would be fantastic. Also, other things that are important is wallet support, the metamass of the world. You mentioned Argent, which is fantastic.
00:52:38.550 - 00:52:59.440, Speaker A: Layer two, sorry, fiat on ramps as well, are going to be super important. So if you project this forward six months to maybe even like nine months to twelve months, do you think all of those things will be in place? Like, this will feel like basically a fast ethereum type of experience, or do you think it's going to realistically take a little bit longer?
00:53:00.370 - 00:53:37.766, Speaker D: I'm an optimist. I think six and definitely twelve months. All of that and much more. The main thing that look back and be surprised at is like some new classes of applications that cannot live on l ones because of the gas crunch there. And suddenly there's some new class of stuff that we can't predict right now. It's going to be there. The main thing that will happen within the next six months and certainly nine months and twelve months is a lot of standardization and a lot of ecosystem growth.
00:53:37.766 - 00:54:47.950, Speaker D: There'll be a whole bunch of standards for various things, account abstraction, fee abstraction, interactions, bridges, ERC 20s, ERC 720 ones, and so on. And people will be using them. But much more importantly, we'll be either past the decentralization point at universe where there will be multiple provers running permissionlessly, and we'll probably also have decentralized validium for data availability and volition. Initially we'll start in roll up mode and we'll probably already be en route to various decentralized governance mechanisms and all they entail. So all of that will be basically our goal is Starkware currently is a company that is running all the stark provers for these production systems, and within six to nine to twelve months you'll see that dramatically changing. And we will not be running the majority of the provers and sequencers and data availability providers.
00:54:48.450 - 00:55:27.318, Speaker B: Well Ellie, that gets right into the part of the conversation I want to go next, which is that long term horizon for what Starquare is as it relates to the rest of the ecosystem. And ZK tech is actually platform agnostic tech, and so we actually can talk about this tech outside of Ethereum. Those are the conversations I want to get to next. But first we have to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible. Matcha, everyone's favorite Dex aggregator, has just launched an open beta for gasless trading. So if you're trading more than $5,000 in common ETH and wrapped bitcoin pairs, then your gas fees on matcha are free. And that's why you should be using matcha.
00:55:27.318 - 00:56:07.138, Speaker B: Matcha routes your orders across all the various DFI exchanges on Ethereum, polygon, binance, smart chain, and gives you the best possible price without any trading fees or unnecessary slippage. Matcha has smart order routing that splits your orders across multiple liquidity sources. If matcha sees that, it gets you better pricing. Trading on Matcha is super easy because it pools the liquidity for me into a single and easy to use platform and has even saved me multiple times from accidentally picking the wrong decks to trade on and getting a bad price. Matcha also allows you to make limit orders on chain so you can set and forget your defi trades and they will go through automatically while you're away. So when you're making a trade. Head over to Matcha XYZ slash bankless.
00:56:07.138 - 00:56:40.814, Speaker B: Connect your wallet and start getting some of the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets. Alchemyx is one of the coolest new DFI apps on the scene. It introduces selfpaying loans, allowing you to spend and save at the same time. Deposit the dai stablecoin into the Alchemyx vault in order to get an advance on the interest it generates. Borrow up to 50% of the total amount of your deposited dai in the form of Al USD stablecoin. Here's the craziest part. The loan pays itself back and you cannot be liquidated.
00:56:40.814 - 00:57:38.950, Speaker B: Unlock your assets potential in the ultimate defi savings account and brand new to Alkmix is the eth vault, where you can deposit eth into the application. Borrow al Eth against your deposits while having your advance gradually paid back over time. V two is rapidly approaching, which will allow for even more collateral types, plus a variety of yield strategies to choose from. Harness the power of Alchemyx at Alchemyx fi that's A-L-C-H-E-M-I-X-F-I. Follow alchemyx on Twitter at alchemy and join the discord to keep up to date with Alchemyx V two and to get involved in governance. All right, guys, we are back with the Starkware team coming into the second half of the show, just tying off some loose ends with some of the things that are not yet talked about on the show. And the first one I want to talk about is the long term prospects for Starkware, the company, because you guys are trying to decentralize your own product, which kind of means you're trying to decentralize yourself.
00:57:38.950 - 00:57:43.350, Speaker B: So what's the long term future for you guys? What's the long term future for Starkware?
00:57:44.170 - 00:57:45.880, Speaker D: I want to take a swing of that.
00:57:46.270 - 00:57:51.980, Speaker C: I would mention that we've decentralized successfully with our kids so far.
00:57:53.470 - 00:59:02.622, Speaker D: I wanted to say that the number one objective is keep on having as much fun and meaningful fun and keep on expanding this amazingly talented and capable team that will grow into an ecosystem that's objective number one. But as David correctly pointed before the break, ZK stark technology is much bigger than just a solution for scaling Ethereum. Initially, of course, it can and will be adopted by, we think, pretty much all blockchains that require scale. It's sort of just like all over the world. You'll see fiber optics everywhere because they scale bandwidth really well, and you'll see cellular phone technology everywhere because it scales communication or makes it easier. You will see ZK starks on all blockchains that still exist. And we, Starkware would like to help that happen.
00:59:02.622 - 00:59:51.274, Speaker D: Once we can put our focus right, you can only do one thing at a time. But beyond that, we think that this technology that allows even, let's go back to the cryptography that allows even simple citizens to sort of hold in check the strongest of monopolies and governments. This is something that we all need today. So we think it will permeate from that into the larger world. Now that's about the technology. So there'll be a whole bunch, there is already a whole bunch of other teams that are driving this forward with starts and we're very proud to see them and help them. There's the Winterfell and maiden effort that is now incorporated into Polygon and we very much support this effort.
00:59:51.274 - 01:00:37.054, Speaker D: There are some other teams that we know are dabbling with Starks but have not gone public with that information. And we support them as well. So there will be multiple ones now for Starkware, we hope. What are we going to do after this? Decentralization? So two very possible routes after, let's say, decentralizing. One is, it's very plausible that some of those conventional institutions and corporations and so on might want something that is their standalone version of stark technology, and we can help with that. And the second thing is hardware. As more and more provers and more scale is demanded, we might want to try and help with that.
01:00:37.054 - 01:00:38.800, Speaker D: So there's at least two.
01:00:40.210 - 01:01:07.020, Speaker A: Oh, Ellie, I want to ask you a question here about decentralization. So some other, I guess, layer two's answer to this partially, and even layer ones is about community ownership as well, right? Some sort of like tokenization, some sort of form of community ownership, whether that takes the form of a governance token or something like that. How important is community ownership to your roadmap to decentralization? What would you say about that?
01:01:09.550 - 01:01:16.170, Speaker D: Very important. But on the specific question of token, we hold to our position of no comment.
01:01:17.070 - 01:01:58.860, Speaker A: Got you. That makes sense. Can you talk a little bit about, like you mentioned this with Ethereum, right? And you also mentioned that this technology is agnostic as well. But it seems like, as David and I have talked about this, it seems like those chains that have embraced this more modular design, this modular thesis, rather than maybe the contrast, is a monolithic, where you're doing execution and consensus and data availability all in the same platform. The more modular chains will be probably first to pick up this technology. And Ethereum is definitely with a rollup centric roadmap, definitely adopted that. Near is maybe another one, Tezos is maybe a third.
01:01:58.860 - 01:02:21.620, Speaker A: Do you think that the more modular chains will be first to adopt this sort of technology? And I guess, do you have any thoughts or comments on where this might leave the rest of the blockchain space? Like the more monolithic designs, do you think they eventually capitulate and sort of become roll up centric and more modular design oriented? Any longer term thoughts here?
01:02:26.150 - 01:03:27.666, Speaker D: This is something that's hard for me to predict for two reasons. One is that our focus is just very limited on this one thing. And Starknet, we did get approached a bunch of times by various l ones asking if we want to deploy. And we gave the same we need to focus answer. And then I would say, if I had to give an answer, I would say, just like I said, with fiber optics or cellular technology, starks are going to be anything that still lives in five years and is blockchain will want to use just like any communication network in a modern country today, probably has some fiber optics. So I would say any blockchain that is massively used would also want to use ZK Starks, because they just offer you this asymmetry, right. Having one huge computer do a whole lot of work and everyone else trusting the outcome, even if that node doesn't have to be trusted.
01:03:27.666 - 01:03:32.840, Speaker D: That's a very powerful technology that I think all blockchains are going to want.
01:03:33.690 - 01:03:40.940, Speaker A: One subject we haven't touched upon yet is privacy. Are there any privacy ties in terms of what you guys are doing?
01:03:42.670 - 01:04:16.520, Speaker D: Well, I mean, we are Starkware, and all of it is like Stark. And we're sort of omitting the ZK, which is part of the whole line of stuff that we invented. And we even did a little bit. There's some open source stuff that is already, there's a signature, post quantum secure signature that we developed that's also open source. So yes, for sure, at some point we will add privacy and zk to. That's another thing about focusing. Right.
01:04:16.520 - 01:04:35.370, Speaker D: There's probably demand for that. We just can't defocus right now. But yeah, there's tremendous opportunity and demand there. The scale with the privacy is. You're right, we sort of neglected it recently just for focusing purposes.
01:04:36.910 - 01:04:38.278, Speaker A: Hey, David, you're muted.
01:04:38.374 - 01:04:47.200, Speaker B: Thank you. One thing I want to ask about is the economic sustainability of Starkware. The business, what's the actual business model there? How do you guys make money?
01:04:48.770 - 01:04:49.182, Speaker D: Sure.
01:04:49.236 - 01:05:29.342, Speaker C: So at the moment, Starkx, these are commercial agreements that we have with our customers that generate revenue in Starknet, we hope to be one of the participants in this open network and provide services to the network and hopefully generate revenue by doing so. As Ellie mentioned, there are other venues to consider beyond that. For example, hardware. We're building applications for the many normies we expect will show up and want to benefit from this beautiful, decentralized, trustless world. So those are all directions that we're actively exploring and working on.
01:05:29.476 - 01:06:01.222, Speaker B: Right. So with the commercial agreements with the Starkx chains, like mutable, DyDX, if you're making money off these things, it must be coming off of the transaction fees of the network, right. I don't understand how it would be anything else. How are these agreements made with things like teams like DyDx and immutable? And does it, can you just illustrate the value flow from the people that transact on these things to how it actually becomes economically sustainable? For starquare, sure.
01:06:01.276 - 01:06:34.674, Speaker C: So just say, going back to the DyDX numbers, if a DYDX transaction on layer one, if such a layer one existed, that could support their existing throughput. If that's at 600,000 gas, and on our system, they end up spending less than 500 gas. Well, there's a huge pie here. Everyone could be made exceedingly happy. The customer Dy DX startware. So there's a lot of value to be had.
01:06:34.872 - 01:06:53.670, Speaker B: Is it just as simple as, say, I'm an immutable user, I'm on immutable or DyDX, and then I make a transaction, the system charges me a dollar to transact on that layer two, and then that's split up between you and DyDx or you and immutable.
01:06:54.010 - 01:07:42.390, Speaker C: I'll give an example. DeFi pooling is this beautiful service that seller is going live with. Powered by Starkex, and Defi pooling caters to the long tail of DFI participants who are priced out of the market on Ethereum layer one. Today they want to transact on Ave on compound, whatever it is. Layer one transactions are absurdly expensive. We're talking about people who want to put a few hundred or a few thousand dollars to work and end up spending tens, maybe hundreds of dollars in transaction fees per transaction. Defi pooling basically allows them to move their assets to layer two, pull them together like car pooling services and those carpool services, then initiate transactions, single layer one, transactions that go from that layer two system onto layer one.
01:07:42.390 - 01:08:19.554, Speaker C: So you pool together 100 users or 1000 users that all go combined in a trustless fashion, say to initiate an Ave transaction. So a single layer, one transaction now is split across so they can pay this service. They spend far less on gas. Ethereum is far less burdened with all these transactions. Ave is getting all this action that would have been sort of just left out of the market. Seller is making money. Hopefully starkware is making money.
01:08:19.554 - 01:08:26.278, Speaker C: Everyone is better off for it. The market is more efficient. The pie is bigger. The pie is actually bigger, right?
01:08:26.364 - 01:08:46.060, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. The cool thing about all these roll ups, it adds just economic activity to the greater pie. Right. Growing the pie. So the idea for starquare is that if we can two x the pie, you take like 5% of the extra growth or something like that. That's the business model.
01:08:46.590 - 01:08:49.040, Speaker C: Well, two k x the pie. But yeah.
01:08:50.850 - 01:08:56.510, Speaker B: Is there an actual percentage that you guys charge or how do you guys actually structure your fees?
01:08:57.330 - 01:08:59.706, Speaker C: The fees are sort of commercial agreements.
01:08:59.818 - 01:09:01.026, Speaker A: That what we put in place with.
01:09:01.048 - 01:09:07.940, Speaker C: Our customers and that handle sort of the revenue side of things.
01:09:08.710 - 01:09:14.962, Speaker B: Each individual agreement with each individual chain is its own agreement. Or are they kind of just like similar agreements, similar structures?
01:09:15.026 - 01:09:19.238, Speaker C: No, they're actually very similar in structure, if not identical, actually.
01:09:19.324 - 01:10:14.550, Speaker D: Okay, I want to say something about actually like a potential business model just around fees on Starknet. Not for starkware, just for anyone running operators. So the argument goes like this. Currently, take ByDX as an example, right? We are consuming much less than 1% of the network, but offering scale that is like roughly five x or ten x more than that. So there's like a thousand x factor or 1000 x reduction in cost between doing a transaction on l one and doing it on our l two. So now what if the fee charged by such an l two would be, let's say one 10th the fee of an l one. So if you run the numbers, first of all, users will be extremely happy because they're paying just one 10th.
01:10:14.550 - 01:11:23.760, Speaker D: But this leaves huge profit margins for the network, right? And if you take into account that, for instance, on Ethereum today, the daily fees are around like $60 million and you're consuming 1% of the network, but you're charging, let's say in total ten x that while doing 1000 x more, everyone's happy. And the actual revenue per day for the operators is something around. If I got the numbers right, like $6 million per day just in fees, and most of it will be profit and the users are happy. Now I'm not saying this will be the main or only business model, and it's not something we explored in depth, but I'm saying just by the fact that there's this huge amount of fees being spent today on Ethereum, along with the amazing 1000 x scale factor that our l two will bring starting next week, there's a very lucrative business model that sits just even there.
01:11:24.370 - 01:11:45.902, Speaker B: Fantastic. That's fantastic color. And, guys, I want to thank you for your time and helping us unpack. What is this really complicated technology in very easily to digestible ways. I want to zoom all the way back out for this last question. And something that really just fascinates me personally is the relationships between humans and code. There's a link here and crypto.
01:11:45.902 - 01:12:05.500, Speaker B: As me and Ryan often say, crypto is a political revolution. It's not left or right, but it is anti authoritarian. Right. And so when you guys are looking at Starquare and looking at the code that you build, do you see any sort of values alignment? How does Starkware, what you guys are building at Starquare, align with the values that you guys.
01:12:08.670 - 01:12:08.998, Speaker A: Can?
01:12:09.024 - 01:13:19.650, Speaker C: I can share my personal perspective. Looking back over the past few decades. Technology is just technology, right? It can do all sorts of things, good things and bad things. And often the same technology can be put to good use and malicious use. I think that a lot of the things that we're building are inherently for the better, in the sense that they are inherently supportive of shifting the power of balance away from centralized entities into the hands of individuals in all sorts of very meaningful ways that Ellie alluded to earlier. And that is something we care for deeply. And I think it's something that a lot of people all over the world are concerned about over these past few years, and they should be concerned about and having the technology that can support those values and do so at scale, meaning not as a thought experiment, not as a little sort of exercise in independence, but something that can actually serve their daily needs, yet protect those rights and privileges is something we care for deeply.
01:13:20.310 - 01:14:05.298, Speaker D: I want to add two different thoughts. One, I think the values that we have at Stark, where I think the first things that jump to mind that I think distinguishes us are, like, meritocracy and excellence. We have audit teams looking at our code and saying we haven't seen many code bases that are, you mentioned code that are as professional and clean, even though this is, like, very moon math stuff and very easy to get wrong. So I think we have our whole team, right? Both Uli and I don't really code.
01:14:05.464 - 01:14:08.660, Speaker C: But fortunately for all of you guys.
01:14:10.230 - 01:15:12.838, Speaker D: I don't think the audits would have looked the same way had we dabbled in that. But we're very proud of this excellence, professionalism and meritocracy when it comes to code, but also to math and science and innovation. The second thing I would say is that we are having fun. But we do recognize that through this opportunity offered by inventing a technology that we believe will transform the world, we understand that there's immense responsibility on our collective shoulders. We can try to get it right for humanity and we could mess it up. And I think so far we've really tried to focus on making decisions that are correct, not only for our own personal short term goals. For instance, I'll give one example.
01:15:12.838 - 01:15:51.460, Speaker D: We founded the company in 2017. Everyone was icoing. Everyone said, guys, just do an ICO. At the time, we raised 6 million people were raising ten x and 100 x on that with technology or with promises that were not as impressive as ours. So we didn't do that because we said it's not right for the state of the technology. And we went first for building very specific applications, handcrafted like StartX is very limited. It does like a few things.
01:15:51.460 - 01:16:14.890, Speaker D: So we're like treading with a lot of responsibility and recognition that we are lucky to have this power to unleash this technological revolution. And we hope we'll make decisions that are good for all of humanity. But who knows?
01:16:15.230 - 01:16:28.730, Speaker A: Ellie, Yuri, it's been an absolute pleasure. I think that's the perfect way to end it. Tremendous amount of responsibility on our shoulders. Being early to this movement. We completely agree. It's part of the bankless nation. It's part of the bankless journey.
01:16:28.730 - 01:16:41.460, Speaker A: We appreciate so much what you guys are doing in the scalability space and we are massively excited about Starknet and what you're delivering both next week and in the weeks to come. So thanks for joining us today.
01:16:41.910 - 01:16:42.866, Speaker C: Thank you guys.
01:16:42.968 - 01:16:44.450, Speaker D: It'll be a fun ride.
01:16:44.610 - 01:17:04.778, Speaker A: Absolutely. Bankless listeners, I hope you enjoyed this. I hope you learned a bit more about one of the premier layer two technologies coming. I certainly learned it was even, I knew it was close, but it's even closer than I thought at the end of this podcast. So once again, another Bankless podcast. I am bullish. Some action items for you.
01:17:04.778 - 01:17:39.586, Speaker A: If you are a builder, if you're interested in developing on Starknet and this technology, make sure you check out the show notes. Join the Starkware Discord service where you'll find a lot of information about this and fellow builders who you can build alongside with. Also, we'll include a link to the post that was mentioned earlier about the Starknet Alpha release and I expect to see some posts next week about the main net release too. Very excited about that. Risks and disclaimers of course, none of this has been financial advice. Maybe this is scalability advice though. EtH is risky, Defi is risky, crypto is risky.
01:17:39.586 - 01:17:48.610, Speaker A: You could definitely lose what you put in, but we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
