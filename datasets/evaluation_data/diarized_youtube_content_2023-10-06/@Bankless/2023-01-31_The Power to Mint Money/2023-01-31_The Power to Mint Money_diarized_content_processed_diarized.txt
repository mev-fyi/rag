00:00:14.560 - 00:00:23.860, Speaker A: Bankless Nation. Welcome to another episode of State of the Nation. At least that's the format we're trying to keep here. But the guest today is just you and I, David.
00:00:24.200 - 00:00:25.504, Speaker B: We are the guests.
00:00:25.632 - 00:01:12.576, Speaker A: Just you, actually, because I'm going to be walking through a concept that you really wanted the Bankless Nation to understand. You think this is very powerful, the title of this episode, and the theme is The Power to Mint Money. The power to mint money. And I think, David, as I'm looking through what you've got prepared for us, kind of this agenda, you've identified some patterns that have been found in every single bull market to date. 20 13, 20 17, 20 21 and 2022. How they've grown and also how they've fallen. And you're using that as a predictor, a way to sort of understand the future, the next bull market, and how this cryptocurrency industry is going to evolve.
00:01:12.576 - 00:01:21.204, Speaker A: So I think it's a powerful model that you're using and this repeating pattern. But you tell us, what are we in store for in this episode?
00:01:21.332 - 00:02:11.704, Speaker B: We're in store for a lot of things. I think this hopefully turns into a kind of episode that I think only Bankless can really produce and which is why I'm really, really excited about this. This is one part, a history lesson about the history of the crypto industry thus far. What was the 2013 bull market like? What was the 2017 bull market like? And of course, what was the most recent bull market like and what are the common denominators between all of those things? So if you only came in Bankless Listener for the 2020 to 2021 bull Market, this might be really useful to just take a snapshot in history about the bull markets that happened before your arrival. Ryan and I can speak very well about the 2017 bull Market. The 2013 bull market was both before our times. However, it was, of course, much more simple to understand because of how early it was.
00:02:11.704 - 00:02:53.604, Speaker B: But understanding these things and then also understanding at very first principles what this whole crypto industry is based on, we can extend this forward into, again, what is the next bull market going to look like, but also, just what does this mean for humans? And I'll give a little teaser here. Every single bull market is noted is marked by a Cambrian explosion of assets. Because what is this industry based off of, Ryan? The free and open and permissionless ability for humans to mint assets, which is previously a superpower that was gated by governments, monarchies, any sort of social elite. It's the 1%, if you will.
00:02:53.642 - 00:02:54.080, Speaker A: Bankers.
00:02:54.160 - 00:03:31.680, Speaker B: Bankers, yeah. Well, this also goes back to Roman times, where the concept of coinage was even produced in the first place. And leaders like government leaders of the Roman Empire would start to dilute the value of their coin by adding in fake metals into gold to dilute them. So, like the concept of seniorage and dilution of fiat of currency has been something baked into humans forever. But only the elites had this power. And for the first time in human history, humans have this power to mint new monies. And every time we express this power in the crypto industry, Ryan, bull markets happen.
00:03:31.680 - 00:03:49.080, Speaker B: 20, 13, 20, 17, 20, 21. And I'm predicting 2025 ish whenever the next bull market arises. You can bet that another Cambrian explosion of Assets and Asset Minting will arrive and we will go through this story and unpack every single nuance along the way.
00:03:49.230 - 00:04:02.028, Speaker A: There it is. It's always been about tokens. Tokens every single time. Every single time we've had a bull run, it's because of one thing. We've invented some new way to issue tokens. I think that's what you're saying here, David. Guys, we're going to explore that.
00:04:02.028 - 00:04:43.668, Speaker A: But before we do, got to shout out our friends and sponsors over at Crypto Tax Calculator. Have you done your taxes yet? If you've been deferring doing your taxes, maybe it's because you feel like it's a nightmare. All of the layer, two transactions that you did last year, all of the DFI trading that you did, all of the NFTs here and there that you don't want to think about. Maybe you're dreading putting that all together and sending it to your accountant or inputting it into your tax software or whatever. Crypto Tax Calculator is a way to sort out that tax nightmare. It deals with the complex transactions that are especially hard for other crypto tax software. You input your ETH addresses, it spits out what you owe.
00:04:43.668 - 00:04:57.150, Speaker A: That's how it happens. And they're integrated basically everywhere. Look, man, this wasn't available back in the day, david okay, grandpa Crypto, when he was doing these early maker transactions. Talking about myself.
00:04:57.760 - 00:05:00.520, Speaker B: CDPs. Remember CDPs? CDPs.
00:05:00.680 - 00:05:10.160, Speaker A: Trying to tax log that and figure out the statuses. Well, now we've got tools that do it for you. David, there is a special offer, I think, for the Bankless Nation as well. Can you give folks an idea of what that is?
00:05:10.230 - 00:05:26.544, Speaker B: Yeah. That is a 30% discount for people that sign up for Crypto Tax Calculator with the code bank 30. Bank 30. There's a link in the show notes to go get started on your taxes. Just inputs and outputs. Again, I love hearing you say that. And also, again, 30% discount.
00:05:26.544 - 00:05:44.220, Speaker B: Bank 30. If you are a bankless premium subscriber, there is a 40% discount extra 10% for being part of the Bankless Nation. You can find that code inside of the Bankless Nation discord for all the premium members out there. Why aren't you a premium member, I'll ask you? Bankless listener, you should sign up. There's a bunch of cool stuff.
00:05:44.370 - 00:05:49.532, Speaker A: Yeah. Go bankless. Become a citizen. All right, David, give us a last piece.
00:05:49.586 - 00:05:58.480, Speaker B: There's a comment in the YouTube I need to read that Ryan sticks. Intern asks, can't an AI like Ryan just do taxes automatically.
00:05:59.140 - 00:06:36.316, Speaker A: This is not for AIS, all right? This is for all the regular humans listening to this. It's not for robots. We have other powers. I mean, robots have other so why did you decide to put this together other than David having a sick guest that had to catch the flu this morning and cancel last minute? And then we're know, who should we bring on as another guest? And you're like, hey, I'm throwing my hand up. I want to be the guest because I've got something to say. Why is this so important to you? And what should listeners really look out for in this Professor David episode as we get into it?
00:06:36.338 - 00:07:13.624, Speaker B: Yeah. Classroom time with Bankless. Yeah. Again, like I said, this is, I think, an episode that I think you and I are particularly good suited for producing. It's talking about the crypto as the details of it, the details of these last bull markets, but also going down to base principles of crypto is like, what does crypto really unlock for humans? But we'll end with, of course, the great line. With great power comes great responsibility. And this related to some of the securities conversations that we also had at the beginning of this year, where I got in trouble with the apes because I said everything all apes are securities, implying that everything is a security board.
00:07:13.662 - 00:07:14.696, Speaker A: Apes NFTs you're talking about.
00:07:14.718 - 00:07:36.896, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah. But then bringing up the broader conversation as, like, guys, we want our assets to be bullish. And that is what a securities laws are. And so we have this newfound ability called being able to mint a token, mint an NFT, mint an ERC 20 token. And that power has previously been restricted and gatekeeped and controlled by the elites. Now we all have it.
00:07:36.896 - 00:07:58.452, Speaker B: But we also need to understand that now that we have this power, with great power comes great responsibility. So how, as humans, as humanity, are we going to contend with the fact that we have this superpower that can be very destructive as well as very constructive? So some philosophy, some history, some crypto alpha, it's all baked into one, which is why I wanted to do this episode.
00:07:58.596 - 00:08:36.416, Speaker A: Fun fact, by the way, did you know that David's nickname in high school was Tobey Maguire Spiderman movies? Great power comes great responsibility. I learned that about 18 months ago about you, David, and I don't think I'll forget it. But guys, you're in for a special episode. We get you in the classroom today, talk about all of these things, talk about the power to mint money and what that means for the opportunities in crypto as well. Before we get into the episode, we want you to stay tuned because we're going to talk about the sponsors that made this episode possible, in particular, Kraken, which is our number one recommended exchange for crypto. Go create an account, sign up for Kraken.
00:08:36.528 - 00:09:25.876, Speaker B: Kraken has been a leader in the crypto industry for the last twelve years. Dedicated to accelerating the global adoption of crypto, kraken puts an emphasis on security, transparency and client support, which is why over 9 million clients have come to love Kraken's products. Whether you're a beginner or a pro, the Kraken UX is simple, intuitive and frictionless, making the Kraken App a great place for all to get involved and learn about crypto.

00:09:25.876 - 00:09:46.756, Speaker B: Rarity rankings, no gas fees, and the ability to buy an NFT straight with cash. Does your crypto exchange prioritize its customers the way that Kraken does? And if not, sign up with Kraken@kraken.com slash bankless. How many total airdrops have you gotten? This last bull market had a ton of them. Did you get them all? Maybe you missed one. So here's what you should do. Go to Earnify and plug in your ethereum wallet.
00:09:46.756 - 00:10:17.664, Speaker B: And Earnify will tell you if you have any unclaimed airdrops that you can get. And it also does poaps and mintable NFTs any kind of money that your wallet can claim. Earnify will tell you about it. And you should probably do it now because some airdrops expire. And if you sign up for Earnify, they'll email you anytime one of your wallets has a new AirDrop for it to make sure that you never lose an AirDrop ever again. You can also upgrade to Earnify premium to unlock access to airdrops that are beyond the basics and are able to set reminders for more wallets. And for just under $21 a month, it probably pays for itself with just one AirDrop.
00:10:17.664 - 00:10:25.640, Speaker B: So plug in your wallets at Earnify and see what you get. That's Earnifi. And make sure you never lose another AirDrop.
00:10:26.060 - 00:10:35.130, Speaker A: All right, David, let's dig into this. I think the first question we have to establish and set the context for is this question of money. What is money?
00:10:36.300 - 00:11:08.544, Speaker B: I think if you've been a longtime bankless listener, you've probably heard Ryan and I talk about this, but people think like, oh, money. It's the cash in your wallet, right? It's the number in your bank account. But we really like to get deep here on bankless, of course. And so I'm going to pull out a quote from Yval. Noah Harari, who's the author of the book Sapiens, which I know. Ryan, it's one of yours, my favorite books. The quote goes the story of money is more important to the evolution of society than religion, corporations and a host of other human imagined institutions.
00:11:08.544 - 00:11:30.392, Speaker B: Money is probably the most successful story ever told. It has no objective value. But then you have these master storytellers, the big bankers, the finance ministers, and they come and tell you a very convincing story. Look at this piece of paper. It's actually worth ten bananas. And that story works. Try telling that story to a chimpanzee.
00:11:30.392 - 00:11:37.740, Speaker B: It won't work. So that's the end of that quote. When I say that quote, Ryan, what triggers in your brain?
00:11:38.320 - 00:12:39.010, Speaker A: I love it for so many reasons. First of all, I think this quote comes from the book Sapiens, where you've all know, Harari paints humanity as a storytelling species. He says that storytelling and our ability to work collectively, cooperatively, that is the thing that makes humans special, humanity as a systemic single entity. And it's crazy to me that how well he identifies that and just kind of lays it bare. He calls it the story of money, right? Another word for story that we might use in crypto is meme, the meme of money. The narrative of money. Because what actually is money other than a story, other than a meme, other than some shared belief that we all collectively reach consensus on that this particular piece of paper or these digits in a bank account somewhere has value.
00:12:39.010 - 00:13:29.810, Speaker A: The reason this is so fundamentally important to me is because I think that for most of my life prior to crypto, I never gave a thought to what money actually is. I just kind of take it for granted. I never kind of considered that it takes a collective group of humans all thinking the same thing about money for a money to actually manifest. And if suddenly we all stop viewing a certain piece of paper or a certain denominated digit as money, then it ceases to be money. It's so weird, this ability to kind of manufacture something from nothing through shared cooperation and shared coordination. But that's exactly what we do with things like money. There are other institutions like this, of course.
00:13:29.810 - 00:13:42.912, Speaker A: He talks about the LLC, the corporation. These are also shared stories, figments of our imagination. But money is perhaps the most powerful because it is underneath all of the other things. So that's what I think of when I hear this quote.
00:13:42.976 - 00:14:25.244, Speaker B: Yeah, and I think that's really great context. And we're going to start to apply some of these thoughts about storytelling behind money because it's not constrained to just money, actually. Like, think about Tesla stock. Great story behind Tesla stock. And perhaps that's why the valuation on Tesla has been so high. And so this story goes beyond money, and it's really just finance, right? There's a market capitalization to a lot of assets, and how valuable these assets are, are a large part about the story of the fundamentals being told. And so it's one thing to have fundamentals, but it's the story around fundamentals that really creates that market price in the secondary markets.
00:14:25.244 - 00:14:49.404, Speaker B: We just got done with our podcast with Chris Berniski. And the theme of that episode was really about how markets are just psyche. And when there is a story told about something that is the world of finance. Finance is about the difference, the elevation of the value of assets above and beyond their fundamentals to Bake in future growth. And if you can tell a good story, you can tell a good story about future growth, you end up ultimately impacting the valuations of these.
00:14:49.602 - 00:15:38.632, Speaker A: So I want to pause there too, right, on this idea of like, somebody's I know, somebody's thinking they're back of their mind is going to throw their hands up at this point in time, and they'll say, But David, I went to business school, okay? I got my MBA. And they told us how to value companies, right? It's the net present value of discounted future cash flows, right? So it's DCF model discounted cash flows. You model that over time and you get the value. Just because things trade off of their fundamental value doesn't mean that they have fundamental value. The fundamental value is driven by, as I was taught in business school, discounted net present value of discounted future cash flows, basically, right? Even that, though, pause and think for a second. Even that model itself. Discounted value of future cash flow.
00:15:38.632 - 00:15:56.396, Speaker A: That is a story, right? It's just a story that we all reach consensus on sometime between the 1940s and 1970s. And it's a story that become so popular it was put into business school textbooks and how to value a company and baked into our psyche.
00:15:56.428 - 00:16:08.724, Speaker B: But it's still a story, and it's a good story. And it's perhaps the correct story, as in, it is the correct way to value an asset, but it is a story nonetheless. You can never escape it being a story.
00:16:08.842 - 00:16:34.940, Speaker A: It's only correct if we all agree it's correct, right? We could all decide to say, no, actually, profit doesn't matter anymore. It's all about growth, it's all about revenue. And you kind of change the story, fundamentally value. You just change the story and then you change the valuation of every company. In fact, I think somewhat that's what sort of happened with stocks and other assets for the last ten years. So just even when you think there's not a story is the point, there's still a story behind the value that is the story.
00:16:35.010 - 00:17:09.704, Speaker B: Yeah. And so this brings us to the question, all right, what is crypto doing? It's doing a lot of things. Distributed systems, solving the Byzantine generals problem. I think in the context of this episode, I'll make the claim that crypto is shattering the current story of money. And the current story of money is a paradigm of fiat currencies and largely just the US dollar. If you look at the market cap of all fiat currencies, the story of fiat currencies is really the story of the US dollar, especially when a lot of fiat currencies are just based around the Fed, basically. And so what is crypto doing? It's shattering this story.
00:17:09.704 - 00:18:01.396, Speaker B: And so I'm going to share my screen here real quick and share what I think really breaks the fourth wall of money, which is the $1 trillion coin. We are looking at a coin that is worth $1 trillion. I don't think this thing ever got minted. But the thought experiment itself is the point where, to me, the idea of the $1 trillion coin goes full circle about the farce of fiat money. It starts to break through and puncture the fabric of reality. For so many people, when they see a $1 trillion coin, it really begs the question, all right, what's money? And so crypto obviously didn't produce the $1 trillion coin, but at the same time that crypto is arriving on the scene, the fiat money system starts to fall apart. And so we are starting to puncture through one story as another story arrives on the scene.
00:18:01.396 - 00:18:03.928, Speaker B: And this new story is crypto money. Right.
00:18:04.094 - 00:18:09.820, Speaker A: But the $1 trillion coin, this is not just a fabrication. This is actually a serious proposal, right?
00:18:09.890 - 00:18:15.932, Speaker B: It's a serious proposal, yes. Which is then treated as a farce by the crypto industry, because we get it.
00:18:16.066 - 00:19:03.884, Speaker A: Well, I recall it originally emerging during the debt ceiling crisis way back in the early 2010s as something that was a serious proposal by Congress at the time. And then I recall it emerged, do you remember, in March 2022, the beginning of COVID Rashida Taleb was an advocate of this, too, and she was talking about this could be a good measure to take in response to sort of some of the debt cycle type issues involved with COVID So these are actually serious proposals by our government bodies and our legislators and those in powers. The $1 trillion coin is not just a thought experiment. It's like an actual proposal. Yes.
00:19:03.922 - 00:19:37.152, Speaker B: It's an actual proposal from the people who are still inside of this story of fiat money. And then the crypto people who have really deeply thought about what is money, understand that this is a farce from our perspective because we were kind of like, quote unquote, enlightened to this concept of money. Like, we understand the concept of money. And so to me, this is what really crypto is doing. It's shattering the current story of money, and it's taking the power around storytelling, around money, and it's giving it to everyone. Right? Like, make a new blockchain, make a new token. This ability.
00:19:37.152 - 00:20:03.040, Speaker B: I've minted an ERC 20 token, I've minted a handful. I have the power to mint new tokens. And if I wanted to, I could engage in a storytelling campaign about my tokens. Right. Except so I want to make a clear difference, is that crypto is shattering the illusion of the dollar, but in its place, it's not giving us another new money. It's giving us a new ability. It's not Indiana Jonesing where it's taking away one money and replacing it with another.
00:20:03.040 - 00:20:19.350, Speaker B: Although the bitcoiners would love to tell you that that's what their bitcoin is doing. Instead it's crypto shattering one story of money and giving us the ability to tell any story about money. So we're not getting a new crypto money to replace dollars, we're getting a new ability. Does that difference make sense?
00:20:19.720 - 00:21:30.420, Speaker A: It does make sense. And I think that maybe the link here with the story of the $1 trillion coin is what made that so audacious is that the US government was essentially saying we can mint a trillion dollars at any point in time. They're basically saying like, yeah, all of that point system that's out in the economy, we control it and we can inflate the number of points at any point in time and we get to control that. Right? And what you're saying I think that is, well, crypto gives that power into the hands of the people, into the hands of communities and it sort of lays bare that this is always what people do, right? It's all about a shared story and a narrative and somebody has the ability to mint every money system that was ever invented and generally a small group had the power to mint. Now this is democratizing that ability, the power to mint. And what you're saying though, is that it's a broader story, it's more about kind of the verb of being able to mint rather than a specific coin, kind of knocking out all of the previous versions of minted coins.
00:21:30.500 - 00:22:30.428, Speaker B: Because if crypto just came in and said like, oh, the dollar is out, here's the new money, it's kind of like old boss, same as the new boss, it's really much more powerful if crypto gives us the power to make any money. And that's also in line with the progress of the internet. Right? Before the internet we had, I don't know, like six, five, a handful of telecommunications news broadcasting services and then the internet came and then we had like 10,000 bloggers, right? And so new technology comes and it enables 1000 of what was previously centralized and controlled and elite to be democratized to the masses. And so this is what crypto is doing with money. We have a few fiat currencies, mainly the dollar, also the Euro Japanese yen. And instead of just like replacing it with a new, better version, it's just opening up the ability to make any of these things up to everyone, to the free market, right? So it's replaced the dollar with the ability for any money to come into existence. And so that is really what is crypto here to do.
00:22:30.428 - 00:22:42.316, Speaker B: It's here to democratize the power to mint new assets and let what money becomes adopted as a result of that up to the free market, rather any sort of like top down and controlled authority.
00:22:42.428 - 00:22:49.412, Speaker A: And David, let me ask you, when you're saying money, you're using that as shorthand for any asset that is valuable, am I right?
00:22:49.546 - 00:22:54.708, Speaker B: Yes, any asset not including NFTs, any asset that has a premium to it.
00:22:54.874 - 00:23:32.176, Speaker A: So you're not just saying, let's be clear about this. You're not just saying when we're using the term money in this episode, we're not just saying things that are a store value medium exchange unit of accounts, things like the dollar or the euro or the yen or like nation state currencies. We're also saying like the stock, for instance, the additional value that you might store in stock, that would be a type of money, a type of asset. You're talking the power to mint stock, the power to mint different, other forms of collectibles, I would say, is that correct? That when you're saying money you mean.
00:23:32.198 - 00:24:24.604, Speaker B: It'S that broad assets I think would be the correct word. But money is like more fun of a word and more striking. But it's really the power to mint new assets. And this is also where we get into conversations of just like the authorities, the powers that be don't like it when the people of the world can mint new assets because how do they tax it, right? The Romans don't want other people to make new money because they had the power of senior age. And if other people could make new money, it reduces their power to issue new coins. And so the powers that be, one of the core ways that the powers that be of whatever organizational system that has come throughout history, one of the ways that they maintain power is they maintain control over the asset printer, the money printer, the ability to mint new assets. And so now that we have that power, we have experienced three bull markets.
00:24:24.604 - 00:24:38.372, Speaker B: And this is what the subject of the rest of this episode is going to be is like what do humans do when we have this power? Like what is our behavior when we are expressing this new power that we have, which is the ability to mint new assets, right?
00:24:38.426 - 00:25:35.908, Speaker A: That's kind of what we've seen play now. So I guess if you are an empire, the one thing, the one story that you have to enforce is your story around money because that gives you kind of control over your sprawling empire. But okay, let's talk about this. So if crypto was really basically giving individuals the power to mint new assets, what patterns do we see play out in all of these bull cycles previously? Is it sort of the case where in each of these bull cycles previously, maybe we can need to get in the history of this, but in each of these bull cycles we've got this new power to mint money or tokens or assets. Remember money, something anonymous with those things, mint something like this. And then we use that power, flex it up to the max and something happens to cause we take it too far tell us about how we've used the power to mint new assets in crypto historically?
00:25:36.004 - 00:26:06.868, Speaker B: Yeah. So looking back at the bull markets that we're going to dive into every individual bull market just to explore and unpack each one. We'll do an autopsy of every single bull market. The patterns I've identified is that first, there's a trigger, something new happens, something net new, brand new onto the scene. And second, as a result of that, a Cambrian Explosion happens because of this new thing that we've unlocked, this new reason to mint money, this new kind of money that we're printing in the crypto world. So a Cambrian explosion happens. That's phase two.
00:26:06.868 - 00:26:25.380, Speaker B: Phase three is corruption sets in. Grifters come because all of this money, this new money printing, is happening all over the place and people are trying to get their hands on it and then they overprint. They overprint, exactly. They overprint. They over issue, they're not responsible. And then as a result of that, a collapse happens and that's phase four. So trigger.
00:26:25.380 - 00:26:31.116, Speaker B: Cambrian explosion. Corruption. Craps collapse. These are the four phases I've identified in every single bull market.
00:26:31.218 - 00:26:36.504, Speaker A: Do you know what's funny about this? This almost reminds me of Radalio's idea of long term debt cycles.
00:26:36.552 - 00:26:36.892, Speaker B: Oh, really?
00:26:36.946 - 00:26:59.124, Speaker A: Across kind of nation states and empires. Well, it basically plays out like this. There's some sort of, like, trigger for the Bretton Breton Woods. It was the end of World War II, dominant power that was kind of the trigger. And then you get camarian explosion of the US economy and the dollar. It's everywhere now, becomes the petrodollar. It dominates the medium of exchange and unit of account all around the world.
00:26:59.124 - 00:27:07.332, Speaker A: 70% of all values traded in dollars. At this point in time, then you see corruption starting to set in. We could just mint this.
00:27:07.386 - 00:27:09.968, Speaker B: We can make new money, can't we?
00:27:10.074 - 00:27:43.490, Speaker A: This is interesting. Well, these are seeds of the corruption. And then later, this is Dahlia's prediction. At some point, all of these empires that create and harness money as part of their empire, they collapse. After the corruption sets in, they have to relieve all of this debt. So what's interesting is the pattern you establish for crypto actually happens over the what is Dalio's cycles, like 70 year periods of time. Sometimes empires go through a few of these cycles in hundreds of years type period of time, when crypto just happens real fast, real fast, like every four years.
00:27:44.120 - 00:28:13.436, Speaker B: And we repeat it because we don't learn the lessons. Because what is the common denominator between everything here? Humans? It's just us. We have the same behaviors, we have the same DNA, we have the same brains. It doesn't matter what cycle it's on. The fact that humans, like all financial markets, are ultimately based on human collective brain power means that these same patterns are going to happen again and again and again, which is why we want to teach this lesson to. The bankless nation, because this is going to happen again. We're going to do this again.
00:28:13.436 - 00:28:20.216, Speaker B: Next bull market. It will play out just like this, I promise you, to a T. Are you ready to get into 2013?
00:28:20.328 - 00:28:22.008, Speaker A: Yeah. Take us back to 2013.
00:28:22.104 - 00:28:49.128, Speaker B: Okay. So, Ryan, did you know in 2013, this is the earliest I'm sharing my screen here, the earliest snapshot of Coin market cap. We can't even use coin gecko because coin gecko came after coin market cap. The earliest snapshot coin market cap goes back to is the 5 May 2013, where there is a whopping ten crypto assets listed. Bitcoin litecoin Namecoin peercoin Feathercoin is true. Frycoin Terracoin Devcoin Nova Coincoin minor Coin yeah. Frycoin yeah.
00:28:49.128 - 00:28:56.356, Speaker B: It's actually crazy that 20% of these tokens are actually still around bitcoin and litecoin. All the other ones have largely gone.
00:28:56.398 - 00:29:00.360, Speaker A: To zero of the top ten. Right, well, let's throw out these market caps.
00:29:00.440 - 00:29:11.144, Speaker B: So bitcoin, $1.3 billion. Wow. Litecoin at the time is $115 115.
00:29:11.202 - 00:29:20.576, Speaker A: For bitcoin at the time. So we're looking at a total crypto market cap of about 1.4 billion. 1.4 billion, something like that. Wow.
00:29:20.678 - 00:29:46.356, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay, so this is the state of where things are in 2013. Bitcoin had been around for four years now, three and a half years now. We're kind of into already this growing energy around bitcoin price. Litecoin was created in 2011, and Litecoin was just a fork of bitcoin with very minute parameters changed. Like, they made the blocks faster. They did use a different hashing algorithm, largely the same thing as bitcoin.
00:29:46.356 - 00:29:48.276, Speaker B: It's really just the same thing as bitcoin.
00:29:48.388 - 00:29:49.560, Speaker A: But there was a meme, right?
00:29:49.630 - 00:29:51.944, Speaker B: There was a meme. Bitcoin is gold, litecoin is silver.
00:29:51.992 - 00:29:55.064, Speaker A: Litecoin is silver. Of course, silver and gold.
00:29:55.112 - 00:30:19.712, Speaker B: And so the funny thing is, I think this will take too long to do, but if you skip forward in the weeks, you'll kind of just see this. Look, I fast forward two more weeks, there's already four more coins, BBQ coin, if you will, and you can just see these prices play out over time. But this is the idea. So this is the trigger. The trigger is bitcoin was created, and then as a result of that trigger, people are like, oh. Blockchains. Oh, internet scarcity.
00:30:19.712 - 00:31:02.624, Speaker B: How about litecoin? I'll just tinker with bitcoin and I'll make a new one. And Litecoin came in and created $50 million of value inside of a year. $50 million of value in a year. That's great. And so this is the trigger for this first ever Cambrian explosion in the crypto space, which was the proof of what we call the proof of work fork and Fair Launch era, as in, oh, proof of work. Blockchains you can just fork bitcoin and make many, many more of them. And so kind of in the same era as, like, DeFi Summer, which was like yield farming in order to distribute, there was like this fork and fair launch era where you could fork bitcoin, you could fork litecoin, launch a brand new token, have a different way of distributing it, different proof of work algorithm.
00:31:02.624 - 00:31:20.500, Speaker B: And that was super innovative. And so this is where things got started. American coin. Meme coin, digital coin. Franco CHN coin. BBQ coin. Megacoin FastCoin Dogecoin came out of this Cohort Dogecoin in 2013.
00:31:20.500 - 00:31:24.840, Speaker B: Bitcoin fork, I think Dogecoin was a litecoin fork, actually. Okay.
00:31:24.910 - 00:31:26.890, Speaker A: Which is a fork of bitcoin. Right?
00:31:28.540 - 00:31:43.272, Speaker B: It's a fork of the code base. It's not a fork of the blockchain. But yes, you're right. Yeah. And so we're watching these prices play out, right? And we're watching the first bull market happen. Look, bitcoin had just hit $6 billion. Look, in one week, it goes from that's insane.
00:31:43.272 - 00:31:43.976, Speaker B: That's insane.
00:31:44.008 - 00:31:47.904, Speaker A: Those are the days. Well, we started this with bitcoin price at 100, and now we're at 870.
00:31:47.942 - 00:31:57.012, Speaker B: And I think we actually just passed the peak right here, which is January of 2014. So we're on the downtrend. But this is the pattern, right?
00:31:57.146 - 00:32:35.744, Speaker A: Was that the trigger? Then we had bitcoin is super successful, and it turns out you can fork other versions of bitcoin. That was kind of the trigger. And then we saw the Cambrian explosion. Of all of these other coins, we should say some of these were newer experiments, right? Like purecoin was. I think, one of the first proof of stake coins you had some early dabbling of that namecoin was that was sort of ancestor of ENS ENS, but as a blockchain domain service type of blockchain. But a lot of these were kind of just forks of bitcoin. I guess XRP came out at that time, too.
00:32:35.744 - 00:32:42.940, Speaker A: All right, so we got the trigger. I think we're seeing the Cambrian explosion. What about the corruption? So what is the corruption part of the cycle?
00:32:43.020 - 00:33:09.892, Speaker B: So the corruption part of the cycle is we started in April of 2013. There were seven cryptocurrencies listed on Coin market cap. By the end of 2014, there were 513. So a year and a half, basically, 500 new currencies were made. Now, do you think, Ryan, that in the early days of crypto, like, no MetaMask, no ethereum, every single blockchain had its own wallet? How many people were buying all these assets?
00:33:09.956 - 00:33:12.748, Speaker A: Enough to asking, is there demand for 500?
00:33:12.834 - 00:33:21.790, Speaker B: Is there demand for 500 currencies? And also bitcoin at a market cap of $10 billion back in 2013. $10 billion was probably insane back then.
00:33:22.240 - 00:33:34.464, Speaker A: I'm going to say no. I'm going to say people got greedy. Or I guess a more charitable explanation. I don't know if you call this corruption is but, David, you just opened this episode and you said, this is the power to mint money. People using their powers. People use the power, minting money. Why are you calling this corruption?
00:33:34.512 - 00:33:58.296, Speaker B: That well, I guess I wasn't there for 2013. Maybe corruption is perhaps semantics. But I think the point is, like, you're right, people used this new power to mint new money. There was also appetite to buy the new monies. So people wanted to go look down the market cap. Sac on bitcoin at $10 billion. I'm going to buy made SafeCoin at $7 million.
00:33:58.296 - 00:34:35.860, Speaker B: That's a better deal and there's more upside there. Maybe it's the next bitcoin, and so maybe it's the next bitcoin buying lower market cap assets because they want to get rich. People will take advantage of that. You could imagine Grifters come in and tell you like, oh, XRP hits the next bitcoin. It's going to be the swift of the internet. Right? And so these narratives come in, these storytellings come in. People start to flex their storytelling abilities, like, why my money is better than your money? Probably this is the genesis of maximalism behavior about people being maximalist about that one particular coin.
00:34:36.220 - 00:34:46.964, Speaker A: But maximalism was probably also part of the antidote to this problem of too many coins. It's basically like, well, no, there is only one bitcoin.
00:34:47.012 - 00:34:47.732, Speaker B: There's only one bitcoin.
00:34:47.796 - 00:34:52.844, Speaker A: Stop talking about your, like, 50th fork. Exactly. We don't care about that.
00:34:52.962 - 00:35:07.170, Speaker B: Right, okay. So like I said, by the end of 2014, 513 cryptocurrencies listed on coin market cap. If we get into the ICO mania there are around the start of ICO mania, I'll stop sharing screen here.
00:35:07.540 - 00:35:10.624, Speaker A: Are you skipping forward to the next era or did we do the collapse yet?
00:35:10.662 - 00:35:37.450, Speaker B: Because oh, that was a collapse. Cloud prices went to like basically zero. Everyone thought it was dead. It was the first ever bitcoin bubble. And so when bitcoin goes from where it was at like a $10 billion market cap to where it fell down below $1 billion market cap, the idea that it was actually dead is probably pretty easy to accept. It's like, oh, that was a one time thing that's never coming back. It's easy to say bitcoin always comes back after it's come back four times, but bitcoin had never come back before then.
00:35:37.900 - 00:35:44.968, Speaker A: Remember the narratives in this era? People were like, I'm done with public blockchains. It was blockchain blockchain, not bitcoin.
00:35:45.144 - 00:35:45.484, Speaker B: Right?
00:35:45.522 - 00:35:49.672, Speaker A: And so it was the idea that, oh, well, enterprise blockchains could be a thing. There was all sorts of narratives.
00:35:49.736 - 00:35:52.190, Speaker B: This is when IBM hyperledger came around.
00:35:52.580 - 00:36:10.260, Speaker A: It's a really brutal bear market. In fact, I remember some of it. I wasn't nearly as plugged in, but that was definitely the era of bitcoin's dead, never coming back. It was all a ponzi all along. It got over 1000 in terms of price and fell all the way back down to the 100s, never coming back after this 100%.
00:36:10.330 - 00:36:33.070, Speaker B: And then that was like the 2014 to 2016 era, that two year long bear market where everyone left except for the diehard believers. And you kind of had to be crazy to believe in bitcoin at that time, to be the type of person to believe in bitcoin, that it would come back before it had ever come back before. You kind of got to be an insane person. And insane in a good way, too.
00:36:33.440 - 00:36:54.000, Speaker A: Yeah, in all the best ways. So we got the trigger, we saw the Cambrian explosion, we saw the corruption setting in and then the collapse. Because this power to first of all, mint new coins in bitcoin, but then create forks of bitcoin, essentially. And mint even newer versions of bitcoin.
00:36:54.420 - 00:36:58.480, Speaker B: Exactly, yeah. And it just overextended itself. We flexed.
00:36:58.560 - 00:37:00.148, Speaker A: I think your internet cut out for a second.
00:37:00.234 - 00:37:06.920, Speaker B: Yeah. The stream's still up and running, so we're good. So I'm going to continue. Ready to go into the ICO mania?
00:37:07.980 - 00:37:08.952, Speaker A: Yeah, let's do it.
00:37:09.006 - 00:37:24.284, Speaker B: Okay. Sorry about the stream quality. I'm getting drop frames, but we'll see how that goes. We're recording locally. Okay. ICO mania, 2017. At the start of 2017, there were about 789 cryptocurrencies listed on coin market cap.
00:37:24.284 - 00:37:50.500, Speaker B: So only 200 added in the next two years. After the first collapse of the first bull market, by the end of 2018, Ryan, at the culmination of the ICO mania, there would ultimately become over 200 or 2000 cryptocurrencies. So 789 to over 2012 of them had over a billion dollar market cap. Now, this is called the ICO mania. I think, Ryan, you know the answer to this. What was the first ICO?
00:37:51.560 - 00:37:54.964, Speaker A: The very first oh, that would be Auger very first ICO.
00:37:55.092 - 00:38:02.090, Speaker B: No, Auger was the very first ICO for a token. Yeah, Ethereum was the first ICO. Yeah, I think that's true.
00:38:05.500 - 00:38:10.888, Speaker A: There may have been very smaller ICOs, I don't know, but it's the first one that gets referred to anyway.
00:38:10.974 - 00:38:23.760, Speaker B: Yes, I think there was some on Mastercoin, but it was the first big one. It was the first ICO of, like, a public blockchain. That was a very big deal. And this ICO was done in 2014. Ethereum raised something like $17 million, $25 million. Very.
00:38:23.830 - 00:38:27.884, Speaker A: It ICO'd at inception. It was born into sin as bitcoin maximum.
00:38:28.012 - 00:38:51.748, Speaker B: Exactly. The pre mine, 70% pre mine. So Ethereum raised an ICO very successful, immediately had a positive return on investment as soon as the blockchain was up and running. And then later in 2015, there was this ICO called Auger. Auger was a prediction market. It was the first ICO for an ERC 20 token on top of Ethereum. This was a project spun up by Joey Krug, who's now at Pantera.
00:38:51.748 - 00:39:22.668, Speaker B: I remember being very excited about Auger. Sadly, Auger came, it arrived, it was built. No one really adopted it, but it was a very legitimate project that raised a bunch of money and captured the attention of a bunch of possibility and imaginations of people. That was the trigger. So we're back at phase one, back at phase number one of, oh, you can mint tokens and sell them for money in order to build something. And that was the ICO trigger. That was the trigger that led to the 2017 ICO mania.
00:39:22.844 - 00:39:49.560, Speaker A: This is the first time I think we started calling these things tokens more than cryptocurrencies. Yes. The 2013 sort of era was we called all of these things still cryptocurrencies. But in the ICO mania, 2014, 2015, we started calling the things at least on top of Ethereum, not cryptocurrencies, but tokens. And Auger was the first, I suppose, ICO for a token.
00:39:50.220 - 00:40:24.512, Speaker B: And as you could imagine, people realized, oh, I can solicit for investment. They probably weren't using these words because this is words that will trigger nation state laws. But I can advertise this project that I'm going to build and then sell a token and then promise that I'm going to build that thing. And then maybe I will, maybe I won't. I think you could imagine how this would trigger a bunch of just grifters and short termers who don't really care about the project that they purport to want to build. But millions of dollars started to flow into these ICOs and this started to snowball. This started to become memetic.
00:40:24.512 - 00:40:41.008, Speaker B: It's like, oh, that token just raised $100 million. And all they had to do was make a website and a web page. I guess I will do that. And then we had a Cambrian explosion of ICOs. This is the paradigm I was born under. Ryan, I don't know if you came in a little bit yeah, a little bit earlier.
00:40:41.044 - 00:40:53.728, Speaker A: Yeah. So we had the trigger, which is Ethereum, the Cambridge explosion of these ICOs. And then you're starting to point to the corruption, which is everybody's doing an ICO then. And I remember those days, David, in 2017, all you needed was a white paper.
00:40:53.814 - 00:40:54.732, Speaker B: Yes, that was the joke.
00:40:54.796 - 00:41:26.040, Speaker A: You set a website and that's true for the Minting function. But the business plan was just this esoteric white paper. Right? And in fact, I don't know, the main question people ask is, like, can I read your white paper? Right. But these ICOs were doing quite well in terms of the amount that they were raising, but also the values of these tokens. Post token launch products hadn't necessarily been launched, but tokens were definitely launched and they were also pumping in price.
00:41:26.190 - 00:42:18.200, Speaker B: Yeah, that's exactly right. People would raise money for an ICO. They would release the token to the blockchain on the blockchain on Ethereum. This is also where binance got started, because there was a sensational desire to trade these tokens, because people wanted to speculate, like, is this token going to move faster than this token? What's that token's roadmap? Which token has a catalyst? And while there was perhaps some meager amount of fundamental development behind these tokens, it was mainly about this narrative game of who's got the best story? Which team can tell the best story about their token? Why will this token accrue value? This is when we started talking about MV equals PQ. If you guys remember that equation way back when. Or the concept of token velocity and token syncs and all of this stuff, but it was really a storytelling exercise. It was like all these ICOs are just trying to tell a better story than all the other ICOs.
00:42:18.780 - 00:43:07.448, Speaker A: So is that where the corruption starts to slip in? When did we first get signs that this whole ICO market was going to go south? Because there were some legitimate ICOs that were actually building a product and trying to ship it. Even those were like, massively stupid valuations. But I would say 99% of all these ICOs collapsed into nothing no ship product. Like, nothing good even came of it. And the vast majority of these were actually I don't know if we'd call them scams, certainly some of them were scams, but many of them just really had no merit raising the kinds of funds that they did or they would sort of exit scam slowly over time by not shipping anything. Massive overvaluation. When did we get the first signs that this corruption was slipping into the ICO market?
00:43:07.534 - 00:43:25.484, Speaker B: Yeah. Towards the end of 2017. And I'll pull out this example. There's a number of very bad ICOs that I can pull back from memory. They all start to blur together. My first job in crypto was an ICO advisory company. And let me tell you, Ryan, some of the ICOs I had to work on for it was egregious.
00:43:25.484 - 00:43:51.828, Speaker B: That the fact that people even thought that these were a good idea. But I'll draw attention to this one ICO, which was done as a farce. And this was called an ICO called Useless Ethereum Token. It was labeled as the world's 1st 100% honest Ethereum ICO. And the tagline is, you're going to give some random person money on the Internet and they're going to take it and buy stuff with it. Probably electronics, let's be honest, maybe even a big screen TV. Seriously, don't buy these tokens.
00:43:51.828 - 00:44:15.376, Speaker B: So this is uetoken.com. I'm so happy that this website is still up and running, but this was basically a website saying, hey, I'm doing an ICO. My token that I'm building is called Useless Ethereum Token. I'm not going to do anything with it. These are the sale terms. I'm going to take your money and I'm going to buy stuff for me. And also, don't buy this token because I'm not going to do anything with it.
00:44:15.478 - 00:44:32.612, Speaker A: I love this FAQ. Wait, is this a joke? Is it a scam? Neither. This is real and it's 100% transparent. You're literally giving your money to someone on the Internet and getting completely useless tokens in return. Obvious satire, but somehow I've got to say, probably this token pumped. Is that the story here?
00:44:32.666 - 00:44:34.356, Speaker B: Yeah. So how much money do you think.
00:44:34.378 - 00:44:41.060, Speaker A: This token raised at the time? So, 2017, I bet it did a $10 million raise.
00:44:41.140 - 00:45:02.000, Speaker B: It did about a million dollar raise. This was the last snapshot I could get. And then I had to look at the chain to actually get some numbers. I think it did something like $600,000. It raised $600,000, which is for nothing at this point. $600,000 is actually a tiny raise in this day of time. The Telegram raised a billion dollar ICO.
00:45:02.000 - 00:45:32.040, Speaker B: The Tawn Token Telegram, the app that we all know and use. A billion dollars. There were billion dollar ICOs, like, left and right towards the end of this thing. The crazy thing is, Ryan, the useless Ethereum Token raised $600,000. When the Token went to trade, it pumped, it went up. Investors in the useless Ethereum Token made money because the Token went to a secondary market and people bought it on the secondary market. This is an ether.
00:45:32.040 - 00:45:53.004, Speaker B: Yes. And so this is in August of 2017. And so we still had a good number of, like, four months left in this bull market, where Ether went from 600 to one. $400. This is why people would do this. People would issue a Token and the Token would go up. And so people would keep on issuing Tokens because every time people would issue Tokens, the price would go up.
00:45:53.004 - 00:45:55.490, Speaker B: It was free money. Money was flying left and right.
00:45:56.020 - 00:46:20.696, Speaker A: I think probably everyone listening can imagine this didn't end well. In fact, most of, you know, kind of your history of 2017, that it didn't end well. And this is what you're calling corruption. I can't help but think that this is corruption in some cases. In other cases, it's just bubble behavior might call this corruption and bubble, like, corruption and exuberance or something like this. The maker behind that Token, literally, it was satire. Right?
00:46:20.718 - 00:46:20.904, Speaker B: Right.
00:46:20.942 - 00:46:23.640, Speaker A: It's like, thank you for your donation.
00:46:24.780 - 00:46:25.956, Speaker B: I'm buying a TV.
00:46:26.068 - 00:46:29.076, Speaker A: Yeah, I wouldn't label that as, like, corruption.
00:46:29.108 - 00:46:29.352, Speaker B: Right?
00:46:29.406 - 00:46:44.796, Speaker A: He's just like, if you want to give me money, go ahead. Here's my donation address. And yet it's still pumped. So corruption and bubble behavior is really what happens here. But then what happened next, I guess, with the 2017 market, it was the collapse.
00:46:44.908 - 00:47:09.700, Speaker B: 2018 was just like 2022. The crypto markets peaked in December of 2017. It was down for twelve months in a row to when we bottomed in, like, December of 2018. So the collapse happened. People got overextended ICOs, got extremely fraudulent, extremely scammy. I literally ryan worked on a token. This is when I started to get disillusioned by crypto.
00:47:09.700 - 00:47:26.030, Speaker B: It was called Pet Community. Pet Data. On the blockchain, you would wear, like, a Fitbit, but a collar for your dog, and it would register data about your dog's health, and it would put it on the blockchain. I shit you not, I had to work on that project.
00:47:26.960 - 00:47:31.648, Speaker A: Wow. Move to earn for pets. This is health data.
00:47:31.734 - 00:47:32.368, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:47:32.534 - 00:47:39.776, Speaker A: I somehow feel like that could have been successful with different framing in 2021 as well.
00:47:39.958 - 00:48:04.792, Speaker B: I don't know, man. There was fast pass. So autonomous cars could use FastPass to pay other autonomous cars to have them move out of the way so the autonomous car could drive through in FastPass, like Disneyland. Spot Token. Spot was you can sell your garage initially for parking spaces, but then the idea was that Spot Token would be just like the land. It would just be land. And people loved this story.
00:48:04.792 - 00:48:06.104, Speaker B: It was a good story.
00:48:06.222 - 00:48:17.416, Speaker A: Do you know what's funny about this era? So there's all these stupid, crazy ICOs, but then there was also a big exuberant market around layer One alternatives. So ethereum alternatives.
00:48:17.448 - 00:48:17.980, Speaker B: Right.
00:48:18.130 - 00:48:26.112, Speaker A: That's when it started, basically. Like, yeah, if Ethereum can launch all these Tokens, well, then why don't we launch another Ethereum that can launch a bunch of other Tokens? Right, right. And so I remember if you like.
00:48:26.166 - 00:48:32.068, Speaker B: It was Neo, which was China of Ethereum. China, yes, ethereum of there was do.
00:48:32.074 - 00:48:33.328, Speaker A: You remember Dragon Chain?
00:48:33.424 - 00:48:35.408, Speaker B: Yes, I remember Dragon Chain.
00:48:35.504 - 00:48:45.220, Speaker A: Dragon Chain was like, somehow there was this super nebulous, never confirmed connection to Disney. Maybe it was some former Disney.
00:48:45.300 - 00:49:03.976, Speaker B: It was a wink wink connection. Yeah, yeah. And it was like people would announce their partnership with Amazon. We have a partnership with Amazon. What were they doing? They were using AWS to host their website, and they use an announcement that we're partnering with Amazon to facilitate our ICO.
00:49:04.088 - 00:49:14.640, Speaker A: Remember the Omise Go guy who's, like, he took a skateboard and he took a picture of himself with a skateboard in front of Google's office or something, and then tweeted this out?
00:49:14.710 - 00:49:15.648, Speaker B: Partnership with Google.
00:49:15.734 - 00:49:21.504, Speaker A: Yeah, it was like, partnership with Google and Token. It was so stupid, but it worked.
00:49:21.622 - 00:49:27.940, Speaker B: And that's why it happened. It's because the story was told and the market accepted the story at the time.
00:49:28.090 - 00:49:52.910, Speaker A: Okay. All right. So this was all caused because of Minting, the power to mint unleashes potential and also exuberant corruption, bubble behavior, and then eventual bust. Sort of the same thing that we saw in the 2013 phase, I guess. We saw a repeat in the 2017. Are you here to tell us that the 2021 phase or whenever this kind of starts? 2020, I guess. To 2021.
00:49:52.910 - 00:49:54.348, Speaker A: It's the exact same.
00:49:54.434 - 00:50:27.636, Speaker B: I think you know the answer first before we get to 2020. To 2021. 2017. And the ICOs was the triggering of the ire of the SEC. This is when enter SEC, enter player SEC came around. Jay Clayton, former agency chairman of the SEC, told a Senate in a hearing in February of 2018, I think every ICO I've ever seen is a security, because Ryan, of course it was. It was a solicitation of investment.
00:50:27.636 - 00:50:53.292, Speaker B: It was an investment contract. It was literally a smart contract that was an investment contract for Tokens. So no shit. The SEC comes in and this is when the nation state, going back to the original state opening statements of this podcast. Nation states, the powers that be don't want the many to have the ability to mint new assets, to mint new money, because that is their power. That is how they can't maintain control. That's what they regulate.
00:50:53.292 - 00:50:57.490, Speaker B: And that being outside of the regulatory apparatus is, like, threatening to them.
00:50:58.100 - 00:51:07.156, Speaker A: That is kind of the nation states are evil sort of take. But I think if you were a regulator, you would say, okay, but you.
00:51:07.178 - 00:51:09.012, Speaker B: Guys just said how fraudulent they were.
00:51:09.146 - 00:51:40.972, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. So, like, what do you want? US people are asking us, the citizens of our country are asking us, the governors of our country, by means of Congress and the President that you guys elected in your democracies, asking us to protect our citizens, and this is our freaking job. You're scamming retail. If you weren't scamming retail with these mania pumps, then we wouldn't have to step in. We don't want to control you. We're just trying to do our jobs and protect our citizenry. I think that would be their take on this.
00:51:40.972 - 00:51:41.952, Speaker A: Is that a wrong take?
00:51:42.006 - 00:52:19.652, Speaker B: I think that's 100% fair take. That is their jobs. And I don't really have any other counterpoint other than to also say that controlling the issuance of assets and money is another way that the powers that be maintained control. Ryan I think it's time to get into DFI Summer and NFT Mania 2020 to 2021. But first we have to talk about Uniswap, where we talk about all of these tokens that trade and also the rest of the bankless sponsors that make this show possible. Uniswap is the largest on chain marketplace for self custody digital assets. Uniswap is, of course, a decentralized exchange, but you know this because you've been listening to Bankless.
00:52:19.652 - 00:53:06.440, Speaker B: But did you know that the Uniswap web app has a shiny new Fiat onram? Now, you could go directly from Fiat in your bank to tokens in DFI inside of Uniswap. Not only that, but Polygon, Arbitrum, and optimism layer two, S, are supported right out of the gate, but that's just DFI. Uniswap is also an NFT aggregator, letting you find more listings for the best prices across the NFT world. With Uniswap, you can sweep floors on multiple NFTs, and Uniswap's universal router will optimize your gas fees for you. Uniswap is making it as easy as possible to go from bank account to bankless assets across Ethereum, and we couldn't be more thankful for having them as a sponsor. So go to app Uniswap.org today to buy, sell, or swap tokens and NFTs.
00:53:06.440 - 00:53:47.400, Speaker B: Arbitrum One is pioneering the world of secure Ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the web3 landscape. Hundreds of projects have already deployed on Arbitrum One, producing flourishing DFI and NFT ecosystems. With a recent addition of Arbitrum, nova gaming and social DApps like Reddit are also now calling Arbitrum home. Both Arbitrum One and Nova leverage the security and decentralization of Ethereum and provide a builder experience that's intuitive, familiar and fully EVM compatible. On Arbitrum, both builders and users will experience faster transaction speeds with significantly lower gas fees. With Arbitrum's recent migration to Arbitrum Nitro. It's also now ten times faster than before.
00:53:47.400 - 00:54:00.990, Speaker B: Visit Arbitrum IO, where you can join the community, dive into the developer docs, bridge your assets, and start building your first DAP with Arbitrum experience. Web Three development the way it was meant to be secure, fast, cheap, and friction free.
00:54:02.720 - 00:54:10.864, Speaker A: All right, guys, we're back. Let's pick up the story here. So we talked about some of the themes of all of these previous markets. You wanted to show us this, david, what are we looking at?
00:54:10.902 - 00:54:23.040, Speaker B: Yeah, I saw this from the comment from the YouTube chat during the commercial break. VChain signs a working agreement with McDonald's. VChain was a supply chain blockchain back in 2017.
00:54:23.120 - 00:54:24.144, Speaker A: I remember VChain.
00:54:24.192 - 00:54:38.980, Speaker B: Yeah, it had a multibillion dollar market cap, tens of billions of dollars McDonald's had to tweet out. McDonald's has not entered into a cooperation or partnership with VChain Foundation. The company is only using our burgers to feed their staff.
00:54:39.060 - 00:54:45.492, Speaker A: Oh, my God. That is corruption. All right? That is not exuberant corruption.
00:54:45.556 - 00:54:46.388, Speaker B: That's corruption.
00:54:46.484 - 00:54:56.504, Speaker A: That's corruption at play. All right, so what can we glean from this? What sort of pattern can we see echoed across all of these previous bull markets?
00:54:56.552 - 00:55:03.064, Speaker B: Well, should we echo these patterns into 2000 and 22,021? Because we still have one more Bull Market to go, brother.
00:55:03.192 - 00:55:03.896, Speaker A: Let's do that.
00:55:03.938 - 00:55:32.456, Speaker B: Okay, so we're in 2020, the start of 2020. There are now 3000 cryptocurrencies again. We started the start of 2017 with 789. We ended 2018 with over 2000 cryptocurrencies. We are entering this next phase of the Bull Market in 2020. Next phase of crypto in 2020. With about 3000 cryptocurrencies by the end of 2020, which Ryan, does not include 2021 or 2022.
00:55:32.456 - 00:55:40.716, Speaker B: By the end of 2020, the year of DFI summer, there were over 5500 cryptocurrencies listed on Coin Market Cap.
00:55:40.898 - 00:56:07.684, Speaker A: That's the number of cryptocurrencies, which is one dimension here. Another dimension is the size, the total market cap of crypto. Right. And so I think we were showing, like, something approximate in 2013, we got to like, 10 billion, maybe 15 billion, something like that. And then the next cycle in 2017, how high did we get? We got in the hundreds of billions, didn't we?
00:56:07.802 - 00:56:12.436, Speaker B: Yeah. Let me pull up Coin Market Cap and I will answer that question.
00:56:12.538 - 00:56:22.056, Speaker A: I don't think we got quite to we didn't get to a trillion, I know, in the 2017 market, but yeah, show us some Coin Market Cap where.
00:56:22.078 - 00:56:28.600, Speaker B: We got let's see. How do I do this? This might take some jumping around.
00:56:28.670 - 00:56:32.172, Speaker A: Oh, just go to Coin Market Cap and look at total crypto market Cap.
00:56:32.226 - 00:56:34.892, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, you're right. You're right. I don't need to do that. Yeah. Okay. One moment.
00:56:34.946 - 00:56:35.992, Speaker A: She is the master chart.
00:56:36.056 - 00:56:52.348, Speaker B: Yeah, okay. Oh, God. Log scale. So in 2013, we peaked out at $13 billion. In 2017, we peaked out at what is that? $500 billion. $570,000,000,000. Oh, we almost got.
00:56:52.348 - 00:56:56.070, Speaker B: Up to 1 trillion. We almost got up to 1 trillion. Look at that.
00:56:56.760 - 00:56:59.830, Speaker A: That's just an order of magnitude difference in terms of size.
00:57:01.160 - 00:57:17.048, Speaker B: And then we fell down to almost below 125,000,000,000 at the bottom of 2018. And then we got up to 3 trillion in this last bull market. This last bull market.
00:57:17.134 - 00:57:28.280, Speaker A: What's interesting is not nearly like the difference, 700 billion to 3 trillion is much different than like 12 billion to 700 billion.
00:57:28.360 - 00:57:36.176, Speaker B: Right. Honestly, I wasn't in this cycle. You weren't in this cycle. But this first cycle, of course, the first cycle of crypto is the best cycle to be in.
00:57:36.198 - 00:57:39.104, Speaker A: It's where all the most epic run up ever yeah.
00:57:39.142 - 00:57:40.336, Speaker B: The most insane thing yeah.
00:57:40.358 - 00:57:41.376, Speaker A: Where it takes and now it's like.
00:57:41.398 - 00:57:42.784, Speaker B: No money to move the price.
00:57:42.902 - 00:57:50.052, Speaker A: The difference is, like, we created tokens in this market cycle, I guess, which that might be the big minting unlock here.
00:57:50.106 - 00:57:55.188, Speaker B: It's easier to make value with tokens than it is with layer one blockchain. So I think that's a great take.
00:57:55.274 - 00:58:04.712, Speaker A: Right. And then, so going into 2020, we had already had this invention of tokens. But yeah, take us to 2020. What were we seeing then?
00:58:04.766 - 00:58:37.856, Speaker B: Yeah. So the trigger for 2020 DFI Summer was compound governance. Compound released the idea of a governance token and all of a sudden, tokens go from, like, to get that token out of my face, I don't want to see another token, because the last time someone showed me a token, it was an ICO that went to zero. So the appetite for tokens between 2018 and 2020 was absolutely zero. Compound releases compound governance and yield farming. Invented yield farming. And all of a sudden people are like, I can yield farm with tokens, I can get yield on my tokens.
00:58:37.856 - 00:59:09.880, Speaker B: I love tokens, tokens are great. And all of a sudden, tokens become in vogue again. And so this is one of the big points I want to drive home. Tokens bull markets are not only we create a reason to mint new assets. In 2013, it was, we can make new blockchains. In 2017, we can mint new, ERC, 20 tokens. In 2020, it was, we can yield farm because these tokens have value now with governance, but also it creates the appetite to receive these tokens, to buy these tokens.
00:59:09.880 - 00:59:46.776, Speaker B: In bear markets, everyone flees up the Market Cap stack to bitcoin and then later to bitcoin and ether. In bull markets, people flee down the Market Cap stack because they want the low cap tokens, because tokens are in. And so the trigger for 2020 is compound governance and liquidity mining. Yams, if you remember, Yams also a big trigger of just this Cambrian explosion of yield farming. And so appetite for buying tokens and issuing more tokens comes back. And so what do we do? We mint a bunch of tokens once again. And this was DFI summer, the most lucrative part of the 2020 to 2022.
00:59:46.776 - 00:59:53.164, Speaker B: Bull market, by the way, was 2020 DFI summer. It got scammy and bad in 2021 when corruption set in.
00:59:53.282 - 01:00:26.856, Speaker A: Well, there's two dimensions to this because so I agree with everything you're saying, but let's also not forget about NFTs as a token, right? And we didn't see that massive, whatever that was, 70 x increase in fungible tokens. But we did see that kind of an increase in NFTs. And we didn't just invent NFTs in the 2020 to 2021 bull run. We had those previously, but they were barely used.
01:00:27.038 - 01:00:27.384, Speaker B: Really.
01:00:27.422 - 01:01:06.356, Speaker A: I consider sort of 2020 to be sort of the birth of the first real NFT bull market. And that did see like 70 x types of increases. And so we got this entirely new asset class. It's almost like in 2013, we figured out we had the ability to mint cryptocurrencies other blockchains. In 2015 to 2017, we figured out that we could mint tokens. And in 2020, yeah, we figured out we could add yield to our tokens and that maybe some of the DFI tokens weren't as valuable. But we also figured out this NFT thing, which is a whole new minting experience.
01:01:06.356 - 01:01:21.992, Speaker A: And that had the most massive bull market that I think we saw. It's just like from zero to all the way to kind of how many tens of billions of dollars the NFT market landed, but just grew from nothing.
01:01:22.126 - 01:01:43.004, Speaker B: Yeah, and it really triggered parts of the brain that other, like ERC 20 tokens just hadn't. ERC 20 tokens. Highly financial in nature, right? Fungible tokens, there's no character, there's no culture in those. ERC 20 tokens are unique. There's art, there's things to look at, there's pixels. And so it triggered the appetite for so many people. For so many people.
01:01:43.004 - 01:02:33.070, Speaker B: It's like, I didn't really care about crypto, but NFTs are interesting to me and it lights up a new part of the brain. It triggered the appetite for buying these things, and especially during the early days when a crypto punk in 2018 was one ether. The appetite is also conduced by the fact that these things are always going up in price. And so no one has anti NFT bias here because every time they buy an NFT, they make money because it goes up in price, which furthers people's appetite to buy more NFTs. So, like the first half of the bull market, very strong appetite for NFTs. Then things like a shitty fiverr project comes out, shitty NFTs come out, the minting process sucks, gas fees happen, and all of a sudden people's appetite for NFTs lessens. And then of course, the corruption just goes from a little bit to a lot turns up to a T.
01:02:33.070 - 01:02:54.484, Speaker B: We have scams, we got rug pulls, we got all this stuff, and all of a sudden the market turns over once again because there's a flurry of activity going around and that triggers the grifters. The grifters come, they can smell all the money and then they come in and do their Grifting stuff. They suck out all the money from the market, and then they leave us with a bear market and a collapse to deal with.
01:02:54.682 - 01:03:29.868, Speaker A: Yeah, the Grifters are definitely responsible in that play, and yet, so are we, as the exuberant people who are buying their bags. Grifters can't grift you if you don't buy their asset, their product. But what we saw was exactly what you're saying is the trigger, the explosion in all these minting, all of these tokens, all of these assets, the corruption and the exuberance setting in, and then the collapse. And, of course, here we are at the beginning of 2023, post collapse. This is like 2018. This is like, I guess, 2014 again, and this is all happening. So what is the trend at play here, David?
01:03:29.964 - 01:04:12.840, Speaker B: The trend is something we've talked about on Bank List before. I'm showing my screen of the Euthanasia roller coaster, the frequent meme that you should definitely understand in crypto, the Euthanasia roller coaster is a concept for a roller coaster designed to kill its passengers. So it's one gigantic, very steep incline to a very, very high point. And then the roller coaster starts to fall down and gain acceleration. And then it does a series of loop to loops, seven loop to loops. And the loop to loops are getting tighter and tighter and tighter and tighter as they go along. And the idea is that I'll read from this caption here, the creator of this roller coaster wanted to create a way in that the roller coaster kills its passengers with elegance and euphoria.
01:04:12.920 - 01:04:14.636, Speaker A: It is a ride experience, by the way.
01:04:14.658 - 01:04:15.364, Speaker B: It's a thought experiment.
01:04:15.432 - 01:04:16.492, Speaker A: This does not exist.
01:04:16.636 - 01:04:42.712, Speaker B: But it will kill you. It will kill you. Yes, because you're sustaining g forces for too long. So it's a ride to the death. The seven loops or inversions put the human body under such stress that it causes the brain to be starved of oxygen and the heart simply cannot push blood against the enormous g forces. It's designed to kill you, but it's at least a fun death. Kind of like a bull market, right? The longer you stay in the bull market, the more loop the loops you're going around.
01:04:42.712 - 01:04:54.264, Speaker B: But if you don't sell by the end of the bull market, you're going to get crushed. Right? That's the lesson I took out of the Chris Berniski episode that we just did. So this is a pattern of every single bull market. It's a euthanasia roller coaster.
01:04:54.392 - 01:05:26.388, Speaker A: Each of these loops are like, tighter and kind of like, I guess, worse and sort of repeating fractals of the first. And that's why we see this massive quality difference between the first versions of the minting or that token and the final versions of the minting of the token. You start with something that's so very creative, something like a crypto punks, for example, and you end with some like Kevin, do you remember that NFT? The Pixelmon?
01:05:26.484 - 01:05:27.610, Speaker B: Pixelmon, yeah.
01:05:28.060 - 01:05:45.928, Speaker A: People were minting NFTs from fiver contracts where they would just be like, design me these NFTs very quick. Quick and dirty. I mean, look at even like some of the Donald Trump NFT stock images.
01:05:46.104 - 01:05:48.952, Speaker B: Of his body, stolen stock images.
01:05:49.096 - 01:06:12.116, Speaker A: Very, very low effort token minting that is clearly not going to sustain into the long run. That's how these markets always end. All right, so what is the takeaway around this, David? It's the takeaway here that minting is bad power and this is why nation states were right all along and empires were right all along.
01:06:12.218 - 01:06:16.580, Speaker B: Yeah, that's exactly what I believe. This is now the Statist podcast.
01:06:17.240 - 01:06:34.060, Speaker A: Well, I mean, some people will say that. They'll be like, all right, you're saying how great it is to give the people the power to mint, but I'm not seeing greatness across these three cycles. Is that just the cynical take? Is there some greatness hidden? What are the good things about it and then what are the bad things about it?
01:06:34.130 - 01:07:03.140, Speaker B: Yeah, so the good things, it's good and bad. And is technology good? No, technology is evil. Humans are no, excuse me. Technology is neutral. Humans are either good or evil based off of their behaviors and what they do. And so neutral technology can get corrupted or what's the opposite of corruption? It can get used in very healthy and productive and proactive and socially productive ways. It depends on who's using it.
01:07:03.140 - 01:07:25.820, Speaker B: And so there's this resistance to nation state laws, resistance to the SEC. We don't want OFAC to come and censor our blockchain. And so that's great. I 100% believe in that. We as humans now have the power to mint new money. That is a power that we have in our back pocket. We can mint new tokens, we can make new blockchains, we can make new NFTs.
01:07:25.820 - 01:07:59.416, Speaker B: This power, which was previously only held by the elite, is now democratized. And that power is something I fundamentally believe in. That's good for humans to have the maximum amount of tools at their disposal because the free market will eventually sort out, okay, that money that that human made is bad, but this money that these humans made are good. And so the market will start to adapt. An answer to that. I believe in the free markets. Ultimately, after much chaos and settling of dust, we will settle on a brand new money that's brand new and not fiat money.
01:07:59.416 - 01:08:33.232, Speaker B: And much better because it's community adopted, bottom up adopted. This is why I'm a fan of Ether. But at the same time, with great power comes the great responsibility. We now have the power to mint new money. And Grifters also now have the power to mint new money. And that is something to watch out for. And so we have this resistance to nation state authority, but we have to remember, and this is why we did those securities episodes at the beginning of this year to explore, like, securities laws date back, Ryan, to like 1200 back way long ago, like, very early.
01:08:33.232 - 01:09:13.632, Speaker B: And then they also adapted and grew and grew and grew because humans realized that if everyone has this power to mint assets, to make a company, make an LLC, whatever, some people will corrupt it. And so we came together as a society and bestowed the power of self regulation unto a certain authority. The SEC is that authority for us. Perhaps you don't believe that the SEC is no longer a good faith actor and they've also become corrupted. But the idea is that the need to self regulate is bestowed upon us. And so this is my call to action for the crypto industry. We now have the power to mint new money.
01:09:13.632 - 01:10:07.884, Speaker B: With great power comes great responsibility. If not the SEC, then who? Then us? What are we going to do about this new power that I believe is fundamentally good, but Grifters can sneak in and corrupt it? How do we answer to this problem? How do we solve this problem of Grifters coming in and corrupting every single bull market that ever will ever happen in crypto? Because if we want the super cycle to ever happen, Ryan, it's going to be because we figured out how to self regulate and keep Grifters out and allowed for sustainable and real fundamentals based asset minting to come about. So that's my call to action. That's why I wanted to do this show. If we want to resist, like, three letter agency control over our industry, we need to self regulate ourselves. We need to do something. And I don't know what that is, but that is my call to action for the Bankless Nation.
01:10:08.012 - 01:10:22.596, Speaker A: Well, I think that's a good take. And I think doing that will obviously alleviate some of the pain and hopefully listener. Once you understand how these market cycles work, you'll understand the next one. Because, look, guys, it's going to play.
01:10:22.618 - 01:10:24.260, Speaker B: Out the exact same way. The exact same way.
01:10:24.330 - 01:10:52.584, Speaker A: All right? So there's going to be some trigger in the future, but maybe it starts in 2023. 2024. That trigger will be related to the minting and the creation of some sort of token. Or maybe it's a new way that we are minting things, or it's a new distribution mechanism, or it's a new way we're adding value to our existing tokens and narratives will form from this. There'll be something there. There'll be the seed of something that is incredibly useful.
01:10:52.632 - 01:10:55.360, Speaker B: There very real, very innovative, very awesome.
01:10:55.510 - 01:11:29.140, Speaker A: That'll be the trigger, guys. We don't actually know what it is. And in advance, it was impossible to call all of these, but I think you can recognize it in the early stages. And then what you'll have is the Cambridge explosion of this experiment was successful. And it gets repeated, repeated, repeated, repeated. The first ten to 20% of those experiments will probably be pretty wholesome, pretty healthy, pretty useful, but we'll go round and round on the roller coaster, it'll get worse and worse and worse and loose, will get tighter and we'll start to lose our oxygen and it'll play out and eventually it'll die and reset.
01:11:29.220 - 01:11:33.064, Speaker B: You will need to get off the roller coaster at some point, yeah, so you don't die.
01:11:33.112 - 01:11:54.816, Speaker A: And I think that's, look, how can we prevent this? You can be educated, you can understand how this works, you can protect yourself. At some level, though. David I do think that, yes, it would be nice if we all held hands and were like, we're going to self regulate and here's exactly how we should do it. I've not seen that play out in any of the cycles I've been part.
01:11:54.838 - 01:11:56.400, Speaker B: Of, sadly kind of bearish on that.
01:11:56.470 - 01:12:41.920, Speaker A: I think there have been some efforts towards that and we've made progress every cycle, but I don't think it's going to fully play out this cycle either. However, what I will say is the healthy part of these cycles is how quickly they happen. And all of the veterans who've been on this roller coaster before, they kind of know we can sort of spot it. And I do think that the grifters will come, but what happens at the end of these cycles is all of that excess and scamminess and fraud and margin and all of the corruption actually gets burnt off in a healthy way. We've used the analogy of sort of the woods, and if it's sort of older woods, lots of foliage falls, dry twigs and leaves, that sort of thing.
01:12:41.990 - 01:12:45.936, Speaker B: Underbrush, yeah, all the underbrush falls.
01:12:45.968 - 01:13:28.384, Speaker A: It's actually a healthy process for the forest to go through some sort of fire rejuvenation period to burn that off, so that new plants, new life, new trees can actually grow in its place. And we have that happen in crypto. That, I think is the regulatory effect. Sure, this is in some ways David, yes, we can pain, but if we don't do it ourselves at the social layer, which I don't know if we can, I don't know if all the bankless podcasts in the world can hold the scammers and fraudsters at bay here, right. I don't know if the most educated crypto community can, because a whole nother set of the population is going to come in and just be like, what? You boomers, you don't know anything, you.
01:13:28.422 - 01:13:30.828, Speaker B: Dumb East Maxis yeah, this time it's.
01:13:30.844 - 01:14:03.640, Speaker A: Different and here's why. And they'll go fall for it and they'll have to learn the lesson the hard way. But I think through the process of exuberant market failure, collapse, total wipeout, no bailout on the other side, that is actually how we're leveling up, because every single cycle we get ten x 20 x 30 x in order of magnitude more useful in terms of the applications value creating the world than the previous cycle. Everything gets better and values increase as well. So the old ceiling becomes the floor for the future cycle.
01:14:03.720 - 01:14:04.124, Speaker B: That's right.
01:14:04.162 - 01:14:06.492, Speaker A: So yeah. Anything else you want to say to end this thing?
01:14:06.546 - 01:14:09.576, Speaker B: That concludes this episode, I believe. Classroom time with Bankless.
01:14:09.768 - 01:14:27.776, Speaker A: Hope you guys enjoyed it. Of course, the power to mint money, that has been the episode I'll end with this. Our typical risks and disclaimers. Got to warn you that of course this crypto roller coaster is pretty risky. It will kill you. It could kill you. You could lose what you put in is our way of saying it, but we are headed west.
01:14:27.776 - 01:14:31.970, Speaker A: This is a frontier. It's not for everyone. But we're glad you're with us on the Bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
