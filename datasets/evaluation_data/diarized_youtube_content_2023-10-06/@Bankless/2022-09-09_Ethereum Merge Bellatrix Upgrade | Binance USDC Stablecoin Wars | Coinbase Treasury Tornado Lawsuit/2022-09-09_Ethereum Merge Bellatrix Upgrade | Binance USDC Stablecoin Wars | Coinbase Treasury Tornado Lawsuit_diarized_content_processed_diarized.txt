00:00:00.170 - 00:00:04.990, Speaker A: This is the last weekly roll up that will be under proof of work with Ethereum.
00:00:07.490 - 00:00:11.354, Speaker B: Bankless nation. It is the second Friday of merge timber.
00:00:11.482 - 00:00:26.786, Speaker A: What time is David Ryan? It's the Friday bankless weekly roll up where we cover the entire weekly news in crypto, which is always an ambitious endeavor, especially this week because it's merge week. Ryan, this is the last weekly roll up that will be under proof of work with Ethereum.
00:00:26.898 - 00:00:33.702, Speaker B: I know that blows my mind. The very last one. In fact, you mentioned that this morning. I tweeted something out about it and.
00:00:33.836 - 00:00:35.810, Speaker A: You always take my ideas and put them into tweets.
00:00:35.890 - 00:00:44.298, Speaker B: Not always, but 50% of the time I do that and I started to get a little bit nostalgic about it and I don't know why.
00:00:44.384 - 00:00:46.822, Speaker A: Right. End of an era.
00:00:46.966 - 00:01:01.950, Speaker B: Yeah. I was never a miner. I know you did some GPU mining in your history. I'd never done that. But it does feel like the end of an era and we're crossing something. And this is the very last roll up where Ethereum is on proof of work. And I guess that counts for something.
00:01:01.950 - 00:01:11.298, Speaker B: So cross your fingers next time you guys hear this. Bankless nation, we will be post merged. Be all proof of stake from there on out.
00:01:11.464 - 00:01:29.506, Speaker A: Okay, I'm just going to make this joke once and we're never going to speak of it again, but we're praying that this is not like the Hillary Clinton election party of 2016, where they were completely confident that they were totally going to win against Donald Trump and then Donald Trump won. That's the last time we'll ever have to make this joke.
00:01:29.538 - 00:01:35.930, Speaker B: What a day that would be. Yeah, that's just a joke. He's joking, guys. All right. David is actually highly confident.
00:01:38.350 - 00:01:59.842, Speaker A: So were all the Hillary anyway. So was Hillary. But anyways, it is like this whole, I was around in Ethereum when it was proof of work. People are going to say that in the future. So if you were here listening to bankless, paying attention to crypto before Ethereum went proof of stake, that's pretty cool. That's pretty cool. Your kids are going to think you're cool.
00:01:59.896 - 00:02:23.466, Speaker B: Hopefully there's only two times to buy ETH before the merger. And we're glad you're here with us because we got a lot to cover today. First, will we be merged next roll up? We just talked about that, but we're going to go through the schedule of what the roll up week looks like next week, because next week is roll up week. We're looking at Thursday for the merge date. David, what else are we talking about?
00:02:23.568 - 00:03:04.166, Speaker A: We are also talking about binance rugging all non binance USD stablecoins on its platform, but it's actually a good thing what happened there. Binance swapping out other people's stablecoins. We'll talk about that. Also, Coinbase going to bat for the crypto industry putting a lawsuit down on the table in front of the Department of Treasury because of tornado cash. So yeah, Coinbase footing the bill for a Treasury against lawsuit, saying that what the treasury has done with banning tornado cash is unconstitutional outside of their jurisdiction and just against innovation. So Coinbase, nice job with that. We'll go into all those details later in the show.
00:03:04.268 - 00:03:20.506, Speaker B: Grab your popcorn, guys, and of course grab your coffee because this is going to be a good one today. David, before we get in, got to share some special news from our friends and sponsors at consensus because they are giving away a free NFT. Free NFT commemorate to celebrate them, to.
00:03:20.528 - 00:03:24.300, Speaker A: Prove to your kids that you were here during the emerge during.
00:03:24.910 - 00:03:52.818, Speaker B: So I'm definitely going to collect one of these. And if you want to be first to know about it as soon as it goes live so that you can mint one of these merge nfts commemorative NFTs for free, you need to click the link in the show notes. Click this button on the Coinbase website called be the first to know. It's got some merge information. Type in your email address and they will send you an email when it is ready to mint and you can mint that for free. So that's the first thing we got going on. Also, David, there's a conference that you're attending at the end of September.
00:03:52.818 - 00:03:55.974, Speaker B: Should tell folks about that and some discounts that are available.
00:03:56.092 - 00:04:18.110, Speaker A: Yeah, of course. Converge 2022 in San Francisco. Your boy is going to become a west coast boy for a half second. The September 27 through the 30th. This is being put on by Circle. This is Circle's converge event, of which there will be many speakers who you might be familiar with. Jeremy Alair, of course, the CEO of Circle, but also Mike Anderson from framework.
00:04:18.110 - 00:04:32.286, Speaker A: Vitalik, of course, will also be giving a talk and to many, many others in the industry. So if you are in San Francisco, definitely get a ticket. If you're around San Francisco, definitely get a ticket because I will see you guys all there. There is a link in the show notes to get a discounted ticket.
00:04:32.398 - 00:04:46.434, Speaker B: Yeah, juicy discount too, I think hundreds of dollars off, $250 off. And by the way, that discount expires on the 15 September. Expires the day of the merch. So you better pick that up before the merch.
00:04:46.482 - 00:04:51.030, Speaker A: But by the time we tell you next roll up, it'll be expired. This is the time.
00:04:51.180 - 00:05:02.298, Speaker B: David acting like he's an east coaster here. He's going to be a west coaster for a hot SEc. All right, east coast, David, let's get to the markets today. What's bitcoin looking like on the week? Are we above 20K?
00:05:02.384 - 00:05:13.066, Speaker A: No, we are not. We started the week at $20,070. We are ending the week at $19,250, down about 4% on the week for bitcoin. Oof.
00:05:13.178 - 00:05:16.926, Speaker B: I don't like that being below the 27 all time high on overall.
00:05:16.958 - 00:05:18.802, Speaker A: The bitcoin chart looks not awesome.
00:05:18.936 - 00:05:22.466, Speaker B: No, that's not feeling good. How about ETH? Any better news for us here?
00:05:22.648 - 00:05:40.630, Speaker A: ETH is up 3.5%. So started the week at 1570, $1,570, ending the week at one, $630, up 3.5%. So bitcoin down 4%. Ether up three and a half percent. Ryan, it feels like the merge. It feels like the merge trade.
00:05:40.710 - 00:05:49.898, Speaker B: Yeah, it feels pretty mergey. Yeah, merge tastic bitcoin ratio. That's got to be up on the week, obviously.
00:05:49.984 - 00:06:00.094, Speaker A: I did the math. Yeah. Up 7.8% on the week. Up to zero eight five. Ryan, do you know what that means?
00:06:00.292 - 00:06:05.086, Speaker B: I bet it is the highest we've been in a long time, maybe in a year's time or so.
00:06:05.188 - 00:06:15.918, Speaker A: We are about there. I think we are matched at the highs of the 2021 bull market. It also means that one ethereum is worth 53% of one bitcoin.
00:06:16.014 - 00:06:16.978, Speaker B: You don't say.
00:06:17.064 - 00:06:18.094, Speaker A: I do say. Sir.
00:06:18.152 - 00:06:19.330, Speaker B: That's halfway to the flipping.
00:06:19.410 - 00:06:24.870, Speaker A: That's over halfway to the flipping. The ETH market cap is now greater than 50% of bitcoins.
00:06:25.530 - 00:06:28.886, Speaker B: What happens? Did we unlock an NFT when that happens?
00:06:28.988 - 00:06:40.986, Speaker A: No, I just get really excited because after white knuckling my ETH BTC down to, like, 0.5, it's nice to have it recovered and then be in the green up to zero.
00:06:41.088 - 00:06:49.774, Speaker B: David, my friend, you're still trading ratios. I thought the DPI ETH would have, like, just destroyed you on ratios from now on.
00:06:49.892 - 00:06:54.958, Speaker A: That was only once. This ratio is working out. Ratio is working out, and there's a reason why. We'll talk about it later in the show.
00:06:55.044 - 00:07:01.402, Speaker B: Well, it probably has to do with the merge, but we'll get into more details. How about the total crypto market cap? We above or below a trillion?
00:07:01.466 - 00:07:09.894, Speaker A: Yeah, we're above a trillion. Last week, we're at 1.1 trillion. We are now at 1.25 trillion. So, small but healthy gain on the total crypto market cap.
00:07:10.012 - 00:07:10.486, Speaker B: Okay.
00:07:10.588 - 00:07:14.120, Speaker A: Which is interesting that the crypto market cap is up, yet bitcoin is down.
00:07:14.650 - 00:07:15.158, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:07:15.244 - 00:07:16.966, Speaker A: That divergence does not happen often.
00:07:17.068 - 00:07:39.374, Speaker B: That doesn't happen often. That's really fascinating, actually. How about ETH gas prices? So what we want to know is, going in the merge, is, are we going to be deflationary post merge? Are we burning more ETH in the form of gas fees, or are we inflationary? Is the money actually? Ultrasound, David, what are we looking?
00:07:39.492 - 00:07:51.074, Speaker A: So, okay, so this is actually something that we have to correct basically all times we've ever reported on gas, because I've been using that total gas distribution chart. The chart further down, and just, like, looking at the peak and seeing.
00:07:51.192 - 00:07:52.434, Speaker B: You've been looking at this.
00:07:52.552 - 00:08:07.442, Speaker A: No, keep going up. You went right over it there. The green one on the top. Right. The weekly gas distribution. I would just measure the peak, and that's how I would report it. But the peak is not the average, and the peak is actually lower than the average.
00:08:07.442 - 00:08:32.170, Speaker A: And so what we've actually been reporting is the median, the middle number, but we're not reporting the average. And so for the month, for the last 30 days, here are the new numbers. The new numbers are, in the last 30 days, the median has been 14 GWe. The net average of gas prices over the last 30 days has actually been 18 Gwe, and that is the more accurate number when it comes to the ETH burn.
00:08:32.250 - 00:08:34.106, Speaker B: And remember, that's the average.
00:08:34.218 - 00:08:46.174, Speaker A: The average. The average, yes. Okay, so the average is 18 GWe, and the ultrasound barrier is 15. So according to last month, we will be ultrasound by the time we go into the merge.
00:08:46.302 - 00:08:53.062, Speaker B: Wow. That's great. Unless block space demand goes down. But you can't imagine it going down too much.
00:08:53.116 - 00:08:55.158, Speaker A: But it can't go down too much more. Yeah.
00:08:55.244 - 00:09:01.462, Speaker B: So will our. Will our very first blocks be ultrasound or not? It's looking like right now they will be.
00:09:01.596 - 00:09:12.842, Speaker A: Well, I think they certainly will be, because there will be hella activity anyways, because of the merge. It's really just like, are we going to sustain that ultrasoundness? And it's close. We're hanging on by our fingernails, but it looks pretty ultrasound to me.
00:09:12.896 - 00:09:25.738, Speaker B: All right, for the last time, we're going to look at the merge estimator date. I know we'll get into the schedule a little bit later, but what is the projected date of the merge date and time of the merge right now for next week.
00:09:25.844 - 00:09:35.486, Speaker A: Thursday, 08:00 a.m. Eastern time on Thursday. Thursday morning. Eastern time. Sorry. For the Pacific coasters, you might still be asleep. You'll have to get up early to watch the live stream.
00:09:35.486 - 00:09:39.266, Speaker A: Not too early, though. But yeah, 08:00 a.m. Eastern time.
00:09:39.368 - 00:09:41.302, Speaker B: It feels perfectly reasonable now.
00:09:41.356 - 00:09:41.714, Speaker A: Totally.
00:09:41.762 - 00:09:47.042, Speaker B: Still move up. It could still move back, but it could also still move up. But 08:00 a.m.. Eastern. I have no complaints.
00:09:47.106 - 00:09:48.050, Speaker A: I have no complaints.
00:09:48.130 - 00:09:49.766, Speaker B: Yeah, it's going to be good. Good morning.
00:09:49.948 - 00:09:50.342, Speaker A: Sorry.
00:09:50.396 - 00:10:10.234, Speaker B: Pacific coasters, we're doing a lot that week. Of course, bankless is doing a lot. The Ethereum community is doing a lot. So we'll give you the schedule a little bit later after we get to the market section, but we still got more market stuff to cover. David, you unlocked this fantastic visualization of ETH price at staking deposit time. What are we looking at and what is this telling?
00:10:10.282 - 00:10:29.830, Speaker A: Yeah, this came from a fantastic Twitter account. Data underscore always, which, just some really fantastic data analysis of blockchain stuff. And there's been this argument that the ETH supply overhang or the ETH unlock, when we finally unlock, is like bearish because that means everyone's going to dump all their ether. And I just think that this argument is totally overstated.
00:10:30.410 - 00:10:33.746, Speaker B: Real quick, what happens there for people who have forgotten?
00:10:33.858 - 00:10:51.942, Speaker A: So, okay, if you are staking ether on the beacon chain, there are no withdrawals. And so it's a one way street. Once you deposit and begin staking ether, that's the only thing you can do. You can't get your ether back. That continues to be true post merge. So we merge and that is still true. We need to do another hard fork to enable withdrawals.
00:10:51.942 - 00:11:51.514, Speaker A: Predicted something like six to twelve months out after the merge. And then people will unlock and people will fear that there is just this pent up demand to sell ether because there's been like this massive staking event where people can't get liquidity on their ether. And I think that this is overstated. Granted, there's a supply of ether, there's like 13, 14 million ether that has not been able to be sold. But you have to really ask your question, who are these people that are staking on the beacon chain? And especially the most credible fear is like this $500 to $700 range where people began staking their ether in the very, very beginning, December of 2020 when the Beacon chain launched, or January 2021 when ether price was still cheap. If you remember, Ryan, January 2021 was when Ether went and broke, like, $1,100 and then started ascent, basically up to $4,000 in May. So people staked in December and January, when ether was still, like, cheap, $500 to $700, and a lot of ether became staked.
00:11:51.514 - 00:12:31.414, Speaker A: Who are those people that are going first through the door into an unknown technology with an unknown stake to lockup time just to get permables? 6% yield on your ETH? It's permeables. It's not like they deposited all of their ether. They probably deposited, like, less than 10% because they're ether permeables that have been here through the presale. These people are not sellers. And also for the remainder of the ETH deposits, if you are somebody who's itching to get liquidity on your ether, you probably staked with Lido, which launched the same time as the beacon chain. And that's all of the blue bars you see here on the visualization. That's all lido deposits.
00:12:31.414 - 00:12:52.638, Speaker A: And so that ether is actually liquid. And so a majority of ether that's been deposited, other than that first cohort that came in between 500 and $700, is actually underwater. So they're actually underwater in terms of their ETH time of deposit, not necessarily when they bought it. And so this whole, like, oh, there's going to be this mass unlocking event, and it's going to flood the marketplace, I think, has been totally overstated.
00:12:52.734 - 00:13:02.594, Speaker B: And you're saying that because you're seeing a lot of this who are below current prices, they staked below current prices, a lot of the ETH. That's.
00:13:02.722 - 00:13:12.146, Speaker A: And even that, I just don't think the people who are willing to take the lockup time are people that are inherently itching to sell their ether. These aren't like, flimsy paper handers.
00:13:12.178 - 00:13:25.680, Speaker B: Well, you know what's funny, though? So I agree with that, and I think that's, like, a valid take. You know what's funny, though, is I know a number of ETH bulls who still haven't staked very much either. In fact, I would count, like, probably yourself and myself among those.
00:13:26.610 - 00:13:36.034, Speaker A: We have our stake with rocket pool, but my personal stake, I have my ether, and then I have my degen, and my dgen supply is creating the ratio right now.
00:13:36.072 - 00:13:49.666, Speaker B: Right. I've got some staked stuff, but I have been also been waiting for it to be derisked, ironically, until after the merge. We'll see how the merge. Yeah, it's interesting. It's certainly complex, by the way.
00:13:49.688 - 00:13:51.154, Speaker A: Derisk the Hillary Clinton risk.
00:13:51.202 - 00:14:12.650, Speaker B: You are having a debate with Jordy on this. I think the episode for listeners will come out live tomorrow. It'll be today by the time you listen to this, right? Isn't that what we're doing? Because David will debate Jordy on this very topic. And you can catch that on the bankless podcast, YouTube, as always. What's this, David?
00:14:12.810 - 00:14:33.134, Speaker A: Just one last amount of revenue for the miners. Ethereum miners made $756,000,000 in revenue in August ahead of the merge. It's the last time we'll see that headline. This is the last amount of revenue for the miners. They get two weeks in September. All of that will be largely deleted.
00:14:33.262 - 00:14:34.786, Speaker B: Good night. Good night, prince. That's it.
00:14:34.808 - 00:14:35.634, Speaker A: Good night.
00:14:35.832 - 00:14:38.230, Speaker B: That's it for the miners. They are now retired.
00:14:39.770 - 00:14:47.650, Speaker A: A lot of them have to retire. There's not sufficient proof of work chains that can support GPU miners to support that entire industry.
00:14:47.730 - 00:14:57.414, Speaker B: I think some of the miners have been stacking their ETH in order to stake, but others haven't. And they'll just move on to greener pastures and other proof of work networks. David?
00:14:57.542 - 00:15:00.666, Speaker A: Not very green, Ryan, not very green.
00:15:00.768 - 00:15:14.190, Speaker B: Some red ones. Let's talk about the general markets in the macro side of things. So first, let's start with the S and P. This is a tweet from Charlie. Charlie Bilo.
00:15:16.130 - 00:15:16.938, Speaker A: Bello.
00:15:17.034 - 00:15:47.498, Speaker B: This is a tweet from Charlie Bello. The S and P 500 is down 17.7% in the first 169 trading days of 2022, the fourth worst start to any year in history. So sp down on justifies an oof. Yeah, definitely. So that's what we're looking at. But I think that the more broad thing in macro that we should probably be thinking about right now is european energy markets and its effect on monetary policy.
00:15:47.498 - 00:15:52.410, Speaker B: This is a great tweet thread from our friend Jim Bianco that kind of explains this. You want to run us through this?
00:15:52.480 - 00:16:36.490, Speaker A: Yeah, he goes. Jim Bianco says the bottom line, Europe is in an intolerable position and the public is getting angry and it's not even cold yet, because, of course, energy is how people stay warm during the winter. And so Jim Bianco continues and says natural gas is used for power generation and space heating, and it's highly seasonal. Storage of natural gas is filled in the summer and run down in the winter for space heating, like they stock up their reserves during the summer when people don't need natural gas as much, and then they consume that in the winter. Currently, storage facilities are at 81% full, about the middle of what you would expect. An average like this is about a normal amount of being full at this point in the year. Jim continues and says, too many have pointed out to the chart above and proclaimed that there is no problem.
00:16:36.490 - 00:17:20.290, Speaker A: But this neglects the fact that it has cost a lot to fill these facilities. And as this chart that we're showing here says, european natural gas prices are soaring even after this week's decline. And so, yes, the reserves are acceptably full, but it's costing way more this year, like three, four, five x times what it would be last year. Consequently, the cost of filling the storage has already cost, yeah, 6.5 times the sill storage in any other full season. They have the supplies, but they paid bigly for it. And this cost has already happened, will be borne by the european population because of soaring energy bills or through some form of taxation or bailouts.
00:17:20.290 - 00:18:03.398, Speaker A: And then he continues and says, also note the natural gas storage detailed above only covers about 25% to 30% of winter natural gas needs, meaning they will have to sip their energy straight from the pipeline in addition to their storage. So it only solves up to, like, 30% of the actual problem. So Europe still needs flows from Russia this winter. And before the Ukraine war, Germany got about 55% of its gas needs from Russia, and this has certainly lowered somewhat during the recent month. But gas flows from Russia are down more than 75% from a normal flow. Note, this is a largest part of the Nordstream being constrained. According to Jim, the Nordstream pipeline will continue to be constrained because that's the whole strategy from Putin right now.
00:18:03.398 - 00:18:40.030, Speaker A: And Jim Bianco continues and says, make no mistake, Putin knows all this, which is why he is trolling Europe with leaks requiring a shutdown of Nordstream for an unspecified period of time. So Putin is basically shutting down Nordstream, saying, just on the play, that this is going to make things really painful for Europe. Of course, none of this should be a surprise. Putin gave a speech in June saying that he was going to do this. Now he's actually doing it. And so what does all this mean? Europe has all the gas it needs as long as they're available to drain their bank accounts for it, says Jim Bianco. So TLDR there is adequate natural gas reserves.
00:18:40.030 - 00:18:57.970, Speaker A: It was really expensive. It only solves 30% of the problem, and that remaining 70% of that problem is going to be expensive even further. And so how are they going to pay for it? Some form of money printing, some form of bailouts, some form of taxation. But it's not going to be pretty either way, is, I think, the summary of this thread.
00:18:58.050 - 00:19:24.222, Speaker B: Yeah. And what's interesting about that as it affects monetary policy is, of course, energy bills, they're soaring for average business owners and average citizens. That means everything else gets more expensive. And so there have already been some government interventions. So the UK is deploying some price caps on energy contracts, but the bills across energy have been, utility bills have been storing. Nonetheless. Italy is approving new aid packages.
00:19:24.222 - 00:20:09.870, Speaker B: We've seen similar aid packages in Germany, and the one in Italy is $12 billion in government funding to help shield firms and families from surging energy costs. And so I think what we're going to see across all of Europe is essentially the government has to deploy policies and deploy funds, stimulus funds to help consumers and help businesses pay for these energy costs. And where's that going to come from? It's not from additional tax revenue. Very likely. It's mostly going to be in the form of money printing. And they're doing this with the backdrop of inflation continues to heat up, too. And so they are cutting checks to people to help them pay for their energy needs.
00:20:09.870 - 00:20:28.286, Speaker B: Yet at the same time, the European Central bank just last week raised rates by 75 basis points in order to tackle soaring inflation. So it's this like rock in a hard place that central banks and governments are trying to manage. And it's a very difficult place to be. Yeah.
00:20:28.328 - 00:20:48.870, Speaker A: And I don't know if this is bullish or bearish. It's bullish because money printing means asset prices go up. It's bearish because people are struggling. And that's never good. That can result in many different things, like people are burning their bills and protesting paying their energy bills. So it's just like, I don't know whether it's bullish or bearish, but it's definitely chaotic. And chaotic makes me scared.
00:20:48.870 - 00:20:50.410, Speaker A: Markets don't like chaos.
00:20:51.150 - 00:21:13.490, Speaker B: Speaking of chaos. So I read this great post this week from Arthur Hayes yet again. Arthur Hayes writing it up. And we had Arthur on the podcast earlier this week, too. So, guys, if you haven'tuned, into that episode, it's a fantastic episode. He's talking all about the merge trade. But maybe I could just, because I know you haven't had a chance to read this, David, but let me just summarize it for you, because I think it's super valuable.
00:21:13.490 - 00:21:53.454, Speaker B: Basically, Arthur is saying, we're in wartime right now. People don't know it, but we're actually in wartime and not. He's talking about the russian ukrainian conflict, although that is a source of kinetic war. He's talking about economic war between Russia and China and the US and the EU. And so his central thesis for this article is like, we're in economic war. Wars could escalate in various ways, but at least acknowledge we're in economic war. We were also previously in a war against a virus, in a COVID war, and we saw all sorts of restrictions and money printing as a result of that.
00:21:53.454 - 00:21:58.210, Speaker B: So the tale of the 2020s so far has been kind of like war.
00:21:58.280 - 00:21:59.874, Speaker A: It's like economic wars, right?
00:21:59.912 - 00:22:52.062, Speaker B: Economic wars and wars against viruses and COVID. And what happens during war when you look at it historically? Well, two things happen. Inflation, which we've talked about a lot. But the second, which is somewhat interesting, is capital controls. And the reason nation states flags, as Arthur calls them, put capital controls in place is so that their citizens can't get out of the inflation, so that we're all kind of in it together. If we are going into an economic war or total war mode, then all of the citizens need to be united and spend whatever is necessary in order to help the government and help the people, help the nation win the war. And so the very first thing that nations do when wartime gets worse is they impose capital controls and sanctions.
00:22:52.062 - 00:23:21.898, Speaker B: And so we saw just glimmers of that. I think during COVID we're seeing a bit more with the russian economic sanctions. But Arthur goes through history and talks about times where it's gotten a whole lot worse. And this, I think, is an interesting piece of history that I would personally like to study a little bit more. And maybe we can do a bankless episode on this in the future. But let's take the US in World War II. Did you know that before World War II? So this is during the Great Depression.
00:23:21.898 - 00:24:24.698, Speaker B: FDR put in place an emergency banking act in 1933 that essentially meant a gold confiscation. So the problem was citizens at that time were trying to escape from inflation, from other economic wars by taking their assets and putting it in coins, bars, gold certificates. And FDR basically made that illegal. You couldn't exit the existing fiat system through a store of value like gold anymore. And did you know that gold, private citizens, american citizens owning gold, was actually illegal until December 1974? So this was like a capital control that lingered. And this is when the US, which they came out of the depression like fairly strong, they actually won World War II. If you look at other countries like Germany, for example, and Japan, the capital controls were far more severe.
00:24:24.698 - 00:24:58.650, Speaker B: There was no way for the average citizen to actually escape. And so Arthur is kind of adding these things up like we're in kind of this early wartime period. Things could get worse. They may not, right? Hopefully, probabilistically, things will end up okay, but they could get worse. And when they do, expect inflation and then also expect capital controls. And his overarching point toward the end of the article is basically this. The time to escape from the fiat system is not after they put the capital controls in place.
00:24:58.650 - 00:25:09.226, Speaker B: So it's basically the time to buy assets, non inflationary assets, like bitcoin, like ether. They're in the digital mode, maybe like other things. If you think real estate.
00:25:09.338 - 00:25:10.702, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe.
00:25:10.836 - 00:25:30.550, Speaker B: Or that can be capital controlled very well by the nation state. Ideally, you want to kind of exit the system entirely, and so you're not dependent on the existing banking system. The time to do that is now at this point. And, yeah, I guess some dark thoughts this week as I was thinking about all of these things, but I think he's absolutely right.
00:25:30.620 - 00:26:05.774, Speaker A: And the basic calculus as to what happens during fiat currencies during wartime, right? Like wartime is destruction. Capital gets destroyed. Like, we spend capital to build a tank, that tank goes to war. Tank blows up, that capital gets destroyed. Fiat money, which paid for that tank, becomes printed and inflated to move atoms. And what is ultimately war is like, it's a fight over the way that the physical world looks. And so people, like governments, are using their fiat currencies as the ultimate power that creates and supports and directs the resources of a world, an army.
00:26:05.774 - 00:26:32.700, Speaker A: And when two armies are going at each other, what happens is that ultimately, the most downstream net effect of war is that inflation happens. And so destruction creates inflation. And why there's capital controls is like the nation state is like, yo, we are all in this together. You all can't sell your dollars because we need to sell the dollars to pay for war. And so you guys can't sell dollars. Only we can sell dollars. And we sell dollars by minting dollars and then selling them.
00:26:32.700 - 00:26:55.280, Speaker A: Usually this works when the populace is behind the effort. This is like buy war bonds in World War II. And people are like, okay, I'll buy war bonds. My son is going to war. I feel really scared for his life. How can I help? I'll buy war bonds. Brian, I don't really think the populace of today is in that kind of sentiment to buy war bonds, certainly not now.
00:26:55.970 - 00:27:08.070, Speaker B: Like, Arthur goes through the kind of the return on investment of war bonds, basically, even for the US, who actually won the war and there's like negative 40% to 60%. If you actually bought the war bonds, you lost money in real terms.
00:27:08.140 - 00:27:11.538, Speaker A: Some people lost lives, some people lost money. It was a group effort.
00:27:11.714 - 00:27:35.214, Speaker B: Yeah. So anyway, very interesting, but I think that people have to start thinking, we have to start thinking about fiat currency and what it actually is. And it's actually just a form of short term debt to the government. You're lending money to the government in exchange for your hard assets like commodities like energy, essentially. Starting to see that in Europe play out. Anyways, back to the merge, back to lighter news. What's coming up next?
00:27:35.252 - 00:27:54.578, Speaker A: David, coming up next, the merge. Did you know it's happening next week? I hope you did, because we talked about it earlier in this episode and last week and the week before that. But it's actually next week. So we're going to talk about the merge schedule. What you need to know, what you need to do, all that stuff, binance rugs, all non USD stablecoins. But it's a good thing. We'll figure out why.
00:27:54.578 - 00:28:21.686, Speaker A: And lastly, Coinbase proposes something big to Makerdao. This is unrelated to how Coinbase is also suing the treasury. We're talking about all of these things and more. But first, a moment to talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible. Rocket pool is your decentralized Ethereum staking protocol. You can stake your ETH in rocket pool and get our ETH in return, allowing you to stake your ETH and use it in DFI at the same time. You can get 4% on your ETH by staking it with rocket Pool, but you can get even more by running a node.
00:28:21.686 - 00:28:54.322, Speaker A: Rocket pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating Ethereum nodes. Setting up your rocket pool node is easier than running a node solo, and you only need 16 e to get started. You get an extra 15% staking commission on the pooled ETH that uses your node to stake. You also get RPL token rewards on top. So if you're bullish e staking, you can boost your yield by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pool network, which currently has over 1000 independent node operators. It's yield farming, but with Ethereum nodes you can get started@rocketpool.net and you can also join the rocket pool community in their discord.
00:28:54.322 - 00:29:19.610, Speaker A: You can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat, so I'll see you there. Makerdao is the OG Dfi protocol. The first DFI protocol to ever exist, even before we called it DFi, Makerdao produces Dai, the industry's most battle tested and resilient stablecoin using maker. You don't need to sell your collateral if you need liquidity. Instead, you can spin up a maker vault and use your collateral to mint dai directly. With Maker, the power to mint new money is in your hands. And there's something new in the Makerdao ecosystem.
00:29:19.610 - 00:29:57.046, Speaker A: Every time a new makerdao is opened, the owner can claim a poap, which contributes funds to one tree planted, an organization with ongoing global reforestation efforts, creating a world where digital participation and the health of our environment can live side by side. Soon, Maker will be present on all chains and L2s, bringing the biggest and best DFI credit facility to everywhere there is DFI. So follow maker on Twitter at makerdao and learn from the oldest and most resilient dow in existence. Ryan the last hard fork before the merge happened. It's called Bellatrix happened last week. It's activated. There are now zero more steps between where we are now and the Ethereum merge.
00:29:57.046 - 00:30:11.614, Speaker A: The next thing to happen on Ethereum is the merge. And the merge is happening next week. September 15, Thursday morning. Is that September 15? Yes, September 15. Thursday morning 08:00 a.m. Eastern time. 05:00 a.m.
00:30:11.614 - 00:30:17.970, Speaker A: Pacific time later in european times. But that's what's next. The merge. The merge is next.
00:30:18.120 - 00:30:24.610, Speaker B: Okay, so Bellatrix being the last hard fork before the merge, how did that go? David, can you go over that with us?
00:30:24.680 - 00:30:48.598, Speaker A: It went super well. Here is a tweet thread from Christine Kim who is live tweeting as Bellatrix happened. And then so some quick stats that she put forth. Network participation rate 97.8% active validators 420,000 offline validators 1100. That number can be expected. And then also here is just like a quick cheat sheet of client diversity.
00:30:48.598 - 00:31:15.140, Speaker A: Everything is below 51%. That's good. We could still get prism down, but it's not really going to stop us from doing anything. And then Bellatrix happens. And the other side of Bellatrix, every hard fork you lose people that aren't ready. And 95% of people hard forked with the Bellatrix update, if we saw 95% with the actual merge, that would be fantastic. So 94.94%.
00:31:15.140 - 00:31:28.634, Speaker A: The 11,000 validator offline validators jumped up to 17,000. But you could imagine these people just like didn't update their nodes. All they have to go do is download more software, fix something, unplug it replug it in something like that.
00:31:28.672 - 00:31:32.700, Speaker B: Is this right number of active validators? 403,000.
00:31:33.470 - 00:31:36.134, Speaker A: Correct. That is the beacon chain validators.
00:31:36.182 - 00:31:36.780, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:31:37.150 - 00:31:57.390, Speaker A: Not unique numbers of computers, but like 403,000 unique instances of 32 ether, which is one validator, of course. And so 94.94% succeeded. And all we need, Ryan, is 66%. All we need is 66% for it to be a flawless merge. And we had 94.94%.
00:31:57.540 - 00:32:00.350, Speaker B: Well, in my school growing up, 94% was an A.
00:32:00.420 - 00:32:12.390, Speaker A: And even if it was below 66%, all it needs is like 24 hours to get above 66%. So it's not like this one moment we need to be above 66%. We just need to get to 66%, like Soonish.
00:32:12.890 - 00:32:20.490, Speaker B: Is this what the merge is going to look like? I'm looking at a meme here. It's just a guy staring at his computer and then he's got the merch happens, and then he's got a little celebratory thing.
00:32:20.560 - 00:32:24.730, Speaker A: It is like this naturally anticlimactic thing of this invisible software.
00:32:25.390 - 00:32:34.982, Speaker B: Not this time. We're going to make it fun on the social layer. But yeah, I mean, it's just code, I guess, in the background. Not a lot's happening. What's this tweet saying, David?
00:32:35.046 - 00:33:10.874, Speaker A: Yeah, this is adrian saying, Bellatrix looking good so far. Again, this is moments after the merge. Definitely some people who didn't update, probably around 5% turned out that was right. But money at stake, we should see that get fixed up pretty quickly. So Bellatrix, the update doesn't actually mean too much. Like, you go offline if something's bad, but you get the leakage response because there's money at stake with the merge, then there is money at stake with Bellatrix because it was the beacon chain. Yes, but this is why this has such a good success rate and why even if it repairs so fast, because there's financial incentive, unlike all previous testnets, which is like, yo, we're going to do a dry run.
00:33:10.874 - 00:33:18.438, Speaker A: There are ticket paying audience members in the theater waiting to see the merge. And so you don't mess up that because there's incentive.
00:33:18.534 - 00:33:21.034, Speaker B: You're losing ETH every few minutes. Right?
00:33:21.072 - 00:33:21.660, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:33:22.430 - 00:33:38.530, Speaker B: This is getting some exposure in mainstream. I've seen a number of articles. This is an article from the Economist about the merge. The title is the future of crypto is at stake in Ethereum. Switch. A lot of these articles, David, they're pretty surface level, but they're also pretty good.
00:33:38.600 - 00:33:56.150, Speaker A: Yeah, and they're also about energy, obviously. They're like oh yeah, look at that subtitle. Can decentralized networks reform themselves, as in repent for their energy consumption? And Lucas has always been like, they're not going to talk about ultrasound money. They're not going to talk about Ether's deflation. They're talking about how Ethereum is going to go green.
00:33:56.220 - 00:34:30.158, Speaker B: That's all right. They got to leave some space for us to talk about. The economists can't steal our content. Come on, guys. I think a lot of people are also wondering whether a proof of work chain will remain. And I think people are just curious, like, if I have some ETH, will I get a free fork? They've maybe received a fork funds in the past, and there is talk of Ethereum proof of work fork that could be happening. What are we looking at right here on Coingecko? I think the chart we have pulled up is for an asset called the Ethereum proof of work fork IOU.
00:34:30.158 - 00:34:30.994, Speaker B: What is this thing?
00:34:31.032 - 00:34:57.398, Speaker A: Yeah, this is basically a tokenized future of the Ethereum POW chain. Ryan, I want to say this extremely clearly. I've said it all the other times on the show. I think listeners should expect getting $0 from the ETH proof of work fork. I think this is a game that's being played by traders who are trying to meme this thing into existence. I think people who are positioning themselves to capture that ETH proof of work token are going to find themselves receiving roughly $0 from this trade.
00:34:57.494 - 00:34:58.618, Speaker B: Unless they're super fast.
00:34:58.704 - 00:35:01.706, Speaker A: Unless they're super fast and sophisticated. In playing this game, you talk about.
00:35:01.728 - 00:35:03.046, Speaker B: Like, just normal retail traders.
00:35:03.078 - 00:35:19.218, Speaker A: Normal retail traders, like a few bucks. I don't think there's going to be this brand new proof of work chain that spawns off, and you see extra ether show up in a different wallet. It doesn't make any sense. I can go to reasons why, but it would just be me ranting for like ten minutes.
00:35:19.384 - 00:35:27.282, Speaker B: I know here we're looking at kind of a futures market, right? But it's about 2% or so the price of ETH, right?
00:35:27.336 - 00:35:32.854, Speaker A: $31 for one proof of work ether, as opposed to the current price of ether, which is one, $632.
00:35:32.892 - 00:35:56.142, Speaker B: And this is one hypothetical hypothetical exist yet. It's hypothetical. But another way to look at this, of course, is to look at the liquidity on this. We're talking just such low liquidity, right? 24 hours, volume of 350,000, not nothing. It's not zero, not nothing, but it's kind of a lowish cap DFI token would have something similar. So don't expect it. It could happen.
00:35:56.142 - 00:36:15.282, Speaker B: Here's the thing, we'll answer some questions. I think we had a lot of questions this week about what do you do in case you want to receive a hypothetical ETH proof of work coin? Is there anything you have to do in case that happens? The good news is, hypothetical scenario that it happens. Yeah, we'll talk about it. David, doesn't you not want this to happen?
00:36:15.416 - 00:36:41.558, Speaker A: I just don't think it will like. Okay, I'm going to speed run this. How are these users going to access this chain? Are they going to update their RPC endpoint in inferior? Somebody inferior is going to have to accept it, which means they're going to have to run their own node that connects to the Ethereum non proof of work chain, which means they're going to download old consensus software. There's going to have to be a client for this thing. People are going to have it. Where's all the infrastructure?
00:36:41.654 - 00:36:46.846, Speaker B: If they have their funds in Coinbase or an exchange, Coinbase would have to obviously release it to them.
00:36:46.868 - 00:36:54.398, Speaker A: There's a lot of Poloniax is going to do that. But if just one exchange services this service for people, it's not anything.
00:36:54.564 - 00:37:04.718, Speaker B: This does feel different than previous forks that we've seen, which actually had some traction. Like Ethereum classic for one, had some traction, but even in the bitcoin world, bitcoin cash was like, roger there, we've.
00:37:04.734 - 00:37:06.206, Speaker A: Got a mission forks.
00:37:06.318 - 00:37:11.794, Speaker B: Yeah, we've got a developed community. No community is rallying around the ETH.
00:37:11.842 - 00:37:18.680, Speaker A: Proof, other than the miners. And the only reason why the miners are rallying on it, because they want to dump on you, because that's their business model.
00:37:20.410 - 00:37:44.686, Speaker B: All right, well, yeah, I totally see the point, so don't expect any free bucks. I wish we had better news for you, but if you do see that token, maybe sell it real quick before everyone else does. You know what's kind of bullish about this though, David, and this is really good to see, is the at home staking community 100% shout out solo stakers. What are we looking at, David? I know we've got a bunch of images lined up.
00:37:44.708 - 00:38:07.414, Speaker A: Yes, super fizz, who's just a fantastic community member of the Ethereum community, just really focused on proof of stake, the merge, and also just fundamentally bullish. On stake from home. He started this whole stake from home meme, and I found all of these tweets because he retweeted it. So just shout out to superfiz. And this is just like this Hozpodge group of people who live at home, and they're staking at home. Look at this mess. Look at this.
00:38:07.414 - 00:38:09.526, Speaker A: Absolute absence of cable management while this.
00:38:09.548 - 00:38:10.994, Speaker B: Wait, where's the staking node?
00:38:11.042 - 00:38:17.386, Speaker A: It's that little black square. It's a little black square right there, connected to the router with a tiny ass keyboard that doesn't even like this.
00:38:17.408 - 00:38:18.618, Speaker B: Does not look like a data center.
00:38:18.704 - 00:38:32.126, Speaker A: This is not professional. This is just, like, amateur at home staking. Here's somebody with the panda sticker on their intel nuck. Their nuc. Tiny little computers running rocket pool. Here's another one. Again.
00:38:32.126 - 00:38:39.502, Speaker A: Steak at home, smaller than a pen. We got, like, 15 of these. Here's another one connected to this battery.
00:38:39.566 - 00:38:40.094, Speaker B: Beefy.
00:38:40.142 - 00:38:59.594, Speaker A: Yeah. So that's the battery. It's the tiny little intel machine that's up in the shelf, but it's on the battery in case the power goes out. Here's somebody having their tiny little staking computer on top of their Ps four, next to their family photos, next to their baby, like a grandkid or kid or something. I don't know.
00:38:59.632 - 00:39:02.620, Speaker B: It's another child. My validator is my child.
00:39:03.390 - 00:39:07.446, Speaker A: Here's one laptop just, like, sitting on some shelf.
00:39:07.558 - 00:39:10.138, Speaker B: Laptop sitting in the basement. That's what this one looks like.
00:39:10.224 - 00:39:26.722, Speaker A: Yeah. Here's a nice, professional looking one. Very clean. Yeah. You can see this on our battle stations, maybe. Here's one with, like, a stuffed dog next to it, right next to all their other server stuff. Here's one sitting under a shelf right next to somebody's modem with a fan on it to make it cool.
00:39:26.722 - 00:39:29.234, Speaker A: Here's one with a postit note that says, don't touch.
00:39:29.352 - 00:39:31.134, Speaker B: This is Daddy's sign. Daddy.
00:39:31.182 - 00:39:36.786, Speaker A: Yeah. Kids, don't touch this next to some home server, because, kids, if you do.
00:39:36.808 - 00:39:41.222, Speaker B: Touch it, the family loses money. All right, don't touch dad's validator, please.
00:39:41.276 - 00:40:00.874, Speaker A: Here's like, a custom made raspberry PI with some ETH branding on it that somebody clearly just put together in, like, a wood shop. Here's somebody with, again, like, a very small box, an intel nuc thing with their little temperature monitor inside of a home. Yeah, right next to their home. Family TV and Xbox, right?
00:40:00.912 - 00:40:03.386, Speaker B: Yeah, right next to your fire stick.
00:40:03.498 - 00:40:18.510, Speaker A: They got that little monitor. Yeah. This is great. Here's somebody's cooler, bigger one. I think this might be actually super physics. Here's one baked into a shelf, just, like, built in. Right? So that's their hue light mode, and they have it hooked up to their shelf.
00:40:18.670 - 00:40:19.490, Speaker B: That is awesome.
00:40:19.560 - 00:40:39.110, Speaker A: Yeah, it is great. Here's Austin Griffith pointing behind him. This is his setup, of course. Here's one with, like, a Vitalik photo. Okay, so we're getting to the good ones here. This guy is staking in his mobile home. He has a full size computer, and he's in the forest of Washington, staking mobile via satellite.
00:40:39.110 - 00:40:41.750, Speaker A: You're not even on the grid.
00:40:41.910 - 00:40:43.094, Speaker B: He is off the grid.
00:40:43.222 - 00:40:43.942, Speaker A: Off the grid.
00:40:44.006 - 00:40:49.740, Speaker B: This is, like, solar powered or something. How crazy is on the grid? Not even connected in a camp.
00:40:50.130 - 00:41:03.146, Speaker A: Amazing. And here's one. This guy has it in his kitchen, on top of his shelves. And so it's above his kitchen cabinets. And I was like, I just love how this is in this dude's kitchen.
00:41:03.178 - 00:41:04.202, Speaker B: And there's that mixer.
00:41:04.266 - 00:41:20.786, Speaker A: There's the Cuisinart. The kitchenaid cuisinart that somebody's making cookie. I'm sorry you're not seeing this kind of stuff with professional proof of work miners. This is in my mind, the reason why we can share all of these photos is because of what? The purposes of proof of work or proof of stake.
00:41:20.898 - 00:41:24.198, Speaker B: Why does this matter? Is this just like hardware porn? Like, why are we even.
00:41:24.284 - 00:41:45.534, Speaker A: It's a little bit hardware porn. But the point is that Ethereum becomes as decentralized as capital and hardware, which are very fundamentally decentralized. And that was my take that I put in here. It's like, the reason why we can share these photos is because how ethereum exists in people's homes. Ethereum by the people, for the people. Yes.
00:41:45.652 - 00:41:47.454, Speaker B: This is what decentralization looks like.
00:41:47.492 - 00:41:47.838, Speaker A: Right?
00:41:47.924 - 00:41:58.706, Speaker B: Scroll through. It's like 100%. Run this from home. This is your check on the network where individuals have power over the network. This is a change that they don't like.
00:41:58.808 - 00:42:06.740, Speaker A: You making just a little bit of money. Four, five, six, 7% on your ETH for just doing the network thing. Doing the ETH thing.
00:42:07.510 - 00:42:10.630, Speaker B: I thought you couldn't run a validator from home. I was told this.
00:42:10.780 - 00:42:15.714, Speaker A: I think a lot of listeners actually haven't heard that because the bitcoiners who say that have just become more and more and more relevant.
00:42:15.762 - 00:42:16.950, Speaker B: We have now.
00:42:17.020 - 00:42:17.734, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:42:17.932 - 00:42:22.390, Speaker B: What is this? From? Jonathan Mann, of course. Put together a nice song. Should we play it for people?
00:42:22.460 - 00:42:28.680, Speaker A: Yeah. Jonathan Mann is the song a day man. So, of course, he sang a song about staking from home. So here it is.
00:42:30.210 - 00:44:03.478, Speaker B: From home. Taking solar with rocket pool or on your own? Taking from home. You're not alone here in the network till we all know it's a night baby into the mouth faint big messing from home follow your nose tending the garden as a theory from home through the tornado the windows are open if the doors are closed into the mind great big mind into the mind great mind break the great big merch close. All right, a lot to celebrate over merge week, of course, including solo stakers. But David, let's talk a little bit more about the stablecoin wars. Because Binance did a thing this week, they have stopped supporting USDC. This is, of course, one of the largest stablecoins in the world, second to tether USDC.
00:44:03.478 - 00:44:28.590, Speaker B: It's kind of a Coinbase circle, american regulated bank stablecoin type product, and binance isn't having it anymore. Essentially, they have converted all of the USDC funds over to their own stablecoin, which is called BuSD. This is the binance stablecoin. Similar product in a lot of respects. Not as american regulated, certainly not a coinbase product or a circle product either. What's going on here, David?
00:44:28.670 - 00:44:46.310, Speaker A: Yeah, and it's actually not just USCC. It's also Pax, dollar, and true USD. These are much smaller stablecoins, but all three of these stablecoins are just being swapped on the back end to BUSD. So if you had USDC or pax or true USD deposited into binance, congrats. You now own BUSD instead.
00:44:46.380 - 00:44:47.186, Speaker B: A different stablecoin.
00:44:47.218 - 00:44:48.214, Speaker A: A different stablecoin, yeah.
00:44:48.252 - 00:44:57.846, Speaker B: This is kind of like an analogy, I think, is, know when you deposit funds into Wells Fargo, they're actually like dollar IOUs. They're wells Fargo Fargo dollar ious.
00:44:57.958 - 00:44:58.522, Speaker A: Right.
00:44:58.656 - 00:45:12.910, Speaker B: And if you deposit it into Chase bank, they're chase dollar IOUs. This is as if Chase bank was holding Wells Fargo ious and they said, no more Wells Fargo IOUs. They're just all chase IOUs now. It's kind of what's happening here.
00:45:12.980 - 00:45:34.166, Speaker A: Yeah. And no capital was lost because it's all one for one. It's all like kind assets. But just like the bankless take here is that banks can do whatever they want with your money. Other banks throughout history, like central banks, have said, like $20 bills, no longer valid. Just like that. This kind of feels a little bit like that, but at least no users lost their money.
00:45:34.166 - 00:46:17.270, Speaker A: And actually, there are some huge proponents of this, saying it's actually really a really good move, mainly because you can actually still withdraw USDC. So if you have dollar, it's basically making all dollars on binance homogeneous, which is actually a good move. You just now have binance dollars, which is literally what it's called but if you want to withdraw USDC to Ethereum, they actually still give you that option. So you deposit dollars into binance, it gets turned to busd on the back end, your binance account. So it's like, okay, you credited this many dollars and then you can withdraw those dollars and turn it into. What do you want to turn it into? USDC on Ethereum, Dai on optimism, like true USD on avalanche, it still lets you do that. It's just homogenizing dollars in the deposit side.
00:46:17.270 - 00:46:47.758, Speaker A: And this is actually very good for liquidity, because rather than having bitcoin trade against USDC and BUSD and UST, it's just now it's just bUsd. So actually these order pairs actually get more liquid. Interestingly, they did not do this for tether. And I think that's because of the manual redeemability of tether. I think this is the case. And so the take here is that it's a good ux upgrade for depositing stablecoins, except for tether. Tether gets a little bit left out here.
00:46:47.758 - 00:47:31.918, Speaker A: And so there's a prediction here that says that this move leads to a gradual net share shift from USTT tether to binance dollar and USDC. And this is also echoed by Jeremy Alair, who is supported of this move by binance. And so the argument here is that this actually cuts out steps for USDC users who want to trade on binance. And so this is actually removing a step and still enabled everything that you could do before FTX actually already had this and built into their exchange. But this feature doesn't get embedded into tether because tether has this T plus one settlement time. I'm a little bit Harry on the details, but that's the hot takes here.
00:47:32.004 - 00:48:16.070, Speaker B: Yeah, Jeremy Lair, of course, is the CEO of Circle, who would be very incentive to respond negatively to this if he felt it was negative to USDC. Yeah, I think there's an element of this is news, but it's also kind of non news. There's also an element of, like, rest assured, this is definitely, you'd say it's in binance users best interest, maybe from a pooled liquidity perspective, but it's definitely in Binance's best interest. Right. They want to propagate busd. And what's interesting about this to me is we're fine with centralized stablecoins like the bankless position is, hey, they can provide some good uX, right, USDC, BUSD, whatever it is. But we should also recognize their limitations.
00:48:16.070 - 00:49:00.002, Speaker B: And these are effectively bank coins, sometimes on crypto rails, but they're issued by bankers. Both are fine, it's good ux, but neither of them are decentralized. And I do think that each bank, over time, of course, they're going to be biased towards their own stablecoin. The interesting juxtaposition, of course, is ethereum is credibly neutral and biased towards neither. It cannot favor USDC, it cannot favor Busd in any stretch. It's interesting when you consider something like the binance chain, for example, you can very easily see that maybe favoring a binance centric stablecoin over another type of stablecoin. We're not going to get that on a truly decentralized system like Ethereum.
00:49:00.002 - 00:49:19.646, Speaker B: So banks will be banks, they're going to play their bank games, and some of it will be good ux and some of it will not be detrimental, but it's definitely not decentralized. David, speaking of banks, playing bank, speaking of banks, Coinbase and MKR, is Coinbase proposing some kind of agreement to the maker community? What is this?
00:49:19.668 - 00:49:39.190, Speaker A: Yeah, Coinbase, the exchange is making a proposal to maker Dow, the Dow. And so they make this proposal for Maker Dow to take one third of its USDC, which is about 1.6 billion. 1.6 billion is one third of it. So multiply that by three and you get the total supply. Again, can't do math, listeners do that in your head.
00:49:39.190 - 00:50:01.726, Speaker A: But Coinbase is proposing that 1.6 billion USDC in makers vaults be deposited into Coinbase to earn yield with Coinbase. And they are offering maker 1.5 yield on their 1.6 billion USDC. And Makerdao is currently getting 0% on that USDC. So this would net maker Dow about $24 million in yearly revenue if they agree to do this.
00:50:01.726 - 00:50:58.800, Speaker A: And so some of the parameters here is that maker will pay zero custody fees on USDC held by Coinbase prime. So Coinbase isn't charging maker for this maker, governance will be able to freely mint, burn, withdraw, and settle almost instantaneously in USDC less than six minutes, consistent with Coinbase's prime standard offering. One of the reasons why this works is this highly automated, and then the rewards from the USDC account with Coinbase will be calculated based on the weighted average of assets on the platform each month and paid out on the fifth business day of the following month. And so some takes are like, well, you're taking collateral that's backing DAI and you're giving it to Coinbase. Does that offer any sort of security risk or centralization risk. Rune responded to this criticism, saying, from a regulatory, legal and seizure risk perspective, this proposal changes nothing, because there was already centralization risk with USDC anyways. And also circle and Coinbase are kind of embed together formally, they have a formal agreement, and so there's not additional risks here.
00:50:58.800 - 00:51:26.674, Speaker A: Another community question came in. Why not advocate to Ave or compound you would improve censorship resistance, reduce centralization risk? And it's less likely than a risk to a custodial service. And I guess actually the answer to this is exactly what I just said. USCC is already a centralized, already custodial. Right? It's already custodial, yeah. But also it would nuke the yields inside of DeFi. And so putting out USDC into defi sucks up defi yields.
00:51:26.674 - 00:51:43.290, Speaker A: And they actually want that DeFi yield to actually go work for DAi. So they're using their USDC for Coinbase to get external yields. So it's actually going out and getting external yields into crypto, rather than just having this internal circular economy where we're just like lending each other our stablecoins.
00:51:43.650 - 00:51:56.926, Speaker B: So that's that, I guess. It's interesting. A few maybe hot takes for me on this are like number one, isn't it cool that a company like Coinbase is proposing a proposal on the maker governance forms? That is cool.
00:51:56.948 - 00:51:57.738, Speaker A: That is really cool.
00:51:57.844 - 00:52:29.580, Speaker B: That's really neat. So I love that piece of it. And I also think, I mean, my other hot take is probably like, Coinbase is probably looking at some of the discussion around the USDC concentration in the MKR. Remember we talked about last week, these factions of the maker community and Dai, and one faction wants to completely eject all centralized stablecoins from the backing of Dai. And here's Coinbase coming in with a sweetener, 1.5% annual APY if you don't. And so that's interesting as well.
00:52:29.580 - 00:52:40.954, Speaker B: It's always fascinating, David, to see how all of this has evolved. And maker is a relatively new project, like five years old. Now here it's getting on the governance.
00:52:41.082 - 00:52:43.514, Speaker A: It's not new in crypto terms, it's.
00:52:43.562 - 00:52:47.730, Speaker B: New in global terms, it's a new kind of like Operation new type.
00:52:47.800 - 00:52:49.860, Speaker A: It's new in the same way that crypto is early.
00:52:50.470 - 00:52:51.220, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:52:52.550 - 00:53:19.402, Speaker A: My hot take here is that this actually doesn't fit the protocol sync thesis I always thought Coinbase would be depositing money into Makerdao, not making proposals for Makerdao to deposit money into it. That actually seems inverted from what I would expect, because this is like a protocol is on top of a centralized entity rather than a centralized entity being on top of a protocol. That's my hot take. It's like that actually didn't really fit my model here.
00:53:19.536 - 00:53:36.814, Speaker B: Yeah, I see that as well. It's interesting to ask what actually is maker right? It's not quite a bank, it's not fully a protocol. What is it? It's some kind of new thing in the middle something. It's a dao. I got a new sort of bank Dow David, what's coming up next?
00:53:36.852 - 00:54:11.094, Speaker A: Though it's not the last time we're going to be hearing from Coinbase in this weekly rollout because they are also suing the treasury department. So go pop your popcorn once you're done with your coffee. And then also the ENS August numbers are in and they're hot because they're always been hot. So we're going to cover those numbers and more right after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible. There is a brand new staking feature in the Ledger Live app today. We all like staking the assets that we're bullish on and now you can stake seven different coins inside the Ledger live app. Cosmos, Polkadot Tron algorithm, Pezos Solana, and of course Ethereum.
00:54:11.094 - 00:54:46.946, Speaker A: With Ledger Live, you can take money from your bank account, buy your most bullish crypto asset and stake that asset to its network all inside the Ledger Live app through a partnership with Figment Ledger also lets you choose which validator you want to stake your assets with. And Ledger is running its own validating nodes, offering a convenient way to participate in network validation. And it even comes with slashing insurance. Ledger Live is truly becoming the battlestation for the bankless world. So go download Ledger live. If you have a ledger already, you probably already have it and get started securely staking your crypto assets. The Brave browser is the user first browser for the web3 Internet with over 60 million monthly active users.
00:54:46.946 - 00:55:14.186, Speaker A: And inside the brave browser you'll find the brave wallet, the secure, multitrain crypto wallet built right into the browser. Web three is freedom from big tech and Wall street, more control and better privacy. But there's a weak point in web3. Your crypto wallet and most crypto wallets are browser extensions which can easily be spoofed. But the brave wallet is different. No extensions are required, which gives Brave browser an extra level of security versus other wallets. Brave wallet is your secure passport for the possibilities of web3 and supports multiple chains including Ethereum and Salana.
00:55:14.186 - 00:55:33.366, Speaker A: You can even buy crypto directly inside the wallet with ramp. And of course, you can store, send, and swap your crypto assets, manage your NFTs, and connect to other wallets and defi apps. So whether you're new to crypto or you're a seasoned pro, it's time to ditch those risky extensions, and it's time to switch to the brave wallet. Download Brave@brave.com bankless and click the wallet icon to get started.
00:55:33.468 - 00:55:51.690, Speaker B: It's still airdrop season. David one inch users on optimism are receiving an airdrop of 300,000 op tokens. In order to receive this, you had to be a highly active one inch user on optimism, and you get a little airdrop bonus incentive in the form of Op tokens. Any thoughts here?
00:55:51.760 - 00:56:26.982, Speaker A: Yeah, this is just really the effort of distributing op tokens to users of optimism. Again, using crypto rewards you, at least it tends to. This one is unique, though, in the sense that one inch already had an airdrop with the one inch token and they already had users on optimism. I'm not really sure if this is actually moving the needle of just like incenting usage of optimism, but it is distributing Op tokens widely, which I guess is good. I want you left with more question marks on than anything on this one.
00:56:27.036 - 00:57:10.040, Speaker B: I think the new meta for airdrops is you got to be doing stuff on L2. That is maybe one of the learning lessons from this, which is in order to get your next Airdrop hit, you got to be active in a L2, like optimism or arbitrum or like later, ZK sync, Starkware, and others. So take note, my friends. Let's flip over to NFTs, though. Do you know Reddit? We talked about Reddit launching NFTs, except they're secretly not calling them nfts for the Reddit community, and they are actually selling fairly well. David, some of these NFTs are selling for over $2,000 and all of the ones that they've released so far have sold out, which is pretty fascinating looking at some of the NFTs here.
00:57:10.810 - 00:57:29.626, Speaker A: This is just good adoption of Reddit. I'm loving where this is going. I want to see more. I want to see more. What's delivering more, though, Ryan, is the August numbers for ENs. So we got the August numbers, 301,000 new ETH registrations. So minting new Ens names is still hot.
00:57:29.626 - 00:58:03.142, Speaker A: That's $4.7 million in protocol revenue, of course, all going to the Dow. And we got some unique new holders, of course, 34,000 new Ethereum wallets that are holding at least one new Ens name. And of course, like always, 99% of domains on OpeNC are being sold as ENs because I don't even know what another domain service provider is. So EnS numbers are hot. I think the ten K club, where if you have an ens number that is zero through nine, nine has like a floor price of three, which is, wow, pretty good.
00:58:03.196 - 00:58:03.510, Speaker B: Really?
00:58:03.580 - 00:58:04.054, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:58:04.172 - 00:58:05.970, Speaker B: That's maintained. It wasn't just a blip.
00:58:06.050 - 00:58:07.814, Speaker A: No, not just maintained, for sure.
00:58:07.852 - 00:58:11.638, Speaker B: That's funny to me that Ens names are like, they are the bear market NFT.
00:58:11.734 - 00:58:12.522, Speaker A: They really are.
00:58:12.576 - 00:58:14.762, Speaker B: They've become like, I saw them last week.
00:58:14.816 - 00:58:18.442, Speaker A: They worked on fundamentals. Right? Like, these are non speculative. These are totally going to be around.
00:58:18.496 - 00:58:37.374, Speaker B: Get the jpegs. You can actually use a domain, just tech ens domain name, no JPEG, but, like, useful. You can use it to name your ETH address or direct an ipfs website or something like this. And you can't do as much with your JPEG. So last week I saw they were actually exceeding the trading volume of board apes.
00:58:37.422 - 00:58:44.530, Speaker A: Yeah. So trading volume was 2300 ether in the last month. Board apes was at 2120 ether.
00:58:45.290 - 00:58:46.760, Speaker B: I'm the captain now.
00:58:48.010 - 00:59:01.814, Speaker A: 9000 ens names have changed hands in the last seven days. So not only are the ENS registrations happening, new Ens domains are coming into the world, but people are also just, like, trading them around, too. It's crazy bullish.
00:59:01.942 - 00:59:05.114, Speaker B: I kept the Ens airdrop, too, David. I don't know if you did, but.
00:59:05.232 - 00:59:08.086, Speaker A: I wasn't able to claim mine. Mine got burnt.
00:59:08.278 - 00:59:09.574, Speaker B: Sad. You lost tokens?
00:59:09.622 - 00:59:17.870, Speaker A: I lost tokens. Yeah, this sounds like. But I don't have to pay taxes on them. That's what I'm claiming. If I can't claim the tokens, I can't pay taxes.
00:59:18.770 - 00:59:20.574, Speaker B: Somebody fact check that for us.
00:59:20.692 - 00:59:24.202, Speaker A: I lost the private keys. If I don't have the private keys, I can't claim the tokens.
00:59:24.266 - 00:59:29.198, Speaker B: Well, if you said it in a podcast, it's 100% true. So if any IRS agents are listening.
00:59:29.214 - 00:59:34.702, Speaker A: The IRS agent is like, okay, deduct $500 of dues paid by David Hoffman.
00:59:34.766 - 00:59:36.638, Speaker B: Like, okay, yeah, they're listening.
00:59:36.734 - 00:59:37.918, Speaker A: That's how taxes work.
00:59:38.024 - 00:59:46.998, Speaker B: One thing that remains bullish is nfts for public goods. What is Trent doing here with the protocol guild in this NFT issuance? Yeah.
00:59:47.004 - 01:00:25.154, Speaker A: So the protocol guild is this guild that's really meant to provide things for the market, for the community that people might want, and then sell those things and then give that revenue to protocol devs, open source sale. Yeah, lemonade sale, bake sale. But the protocol devs development funding development has always been like a problem in open source world and also with Ethereum. And so the protocol guild has gone after that problem. And so they are making NFTs with actually really big deal artists and platforms. And so there's this whole network around producing some really cool NFTs. So while it seems like a bake sale, like, oh, buy a cookie, send.
01:00:25.154 - 01:00:31.270, Speaker A: It's big. These are coveted nfts. I think people are going to play the speculation game on these things.
01:00:31.340 - 01:00:53.830, Speaker B: Look at this 120 Ethereum core devs that this guy being funded. And that's amazing because guess why next week is Merch week. David, it's because of these people, right? It's because the Ethereum core devs, they made it happen. And so now is a good time to celebrate them. You could do so by purchasing an NFT and the proceeds go to the devs via the protocol guild.
01:00:53.910 - 01:01:15.394, Speaker A: I've checked out some of the art on these things, both from like some of it's not released yet, but you can just check out because some artists are on board, other artists haven't been revealed yet. But this is not just like a casual thing. This is like a big deal thing. Like artists are coming, secret artists, blah, blah, blah. But the art of what has been revealed is pretty damn cool. Pretty damn cool. Another way to be participating in this.
01:01:15.394 - 01:01:23.366, Speaker A: Yes. Okay. Oh, yes. Here we go. Okay. Victor Buenan out of Coinbase. He works at Coinbase Cloud, but definitely, just like deep in Coinbase says.
01:01:23.366 - 01:01:40.906, Speaker A: Today we announced that Coinbase is funding and supporting a lawsuit by six individuals against the Treasury Department's sanctions of tornado cash smart contracts, an open source piece of software. You can read more about the details here. So six individuals are suing the Treasury Department and Coinbase is footing the bill and basically coordinating everything.
01:01:41.088 - 01:01:41.850, Speaker B: Here we go.
01:01:41.920 - 01:01:46.458, Speaker A: Nice job, Coinbase. Okay, are you ready to rumble?
01:01:46.634 - 01:02:32.502, Speaker B: This is basically so you guys know because you've been listening to the roll up the last few weeks. Dave and I have talked a lot about tornado cash, the OFAC sanctioning of smart contracts and the unconstitutionality of it or the illegality of it. We've done a number of episodes about that with Jake Trevinsky. And the question is, okay, what is the crypto community going to do about it? And if you're an right with an ETH address and your government has just told you, if you use tornado cash to try to keep your transactions private, you could go to jail for 30 years. What can an individual do about it? They can fight back. Right. So now we have the infantry coming in, we have Coinbase stepping up and actually suing the Treasury Department.
01:02:32.566 - 01:02:35.226, Speaker A: Well, no, Coinbase funding this, funding the.
01:02:35.248 - 01:02:50.670, Speaker B: Suing, funding the treasury, funding the lawsuit of the treasury department on the behalf of six plaintiffs. So six individual citizens like you and I, who they are representing and they are funding. They're paying the legal bills for these individuals. It's badass.
01:02:50.830 - 01:02:53.118, Speaker A: Super Chad. Super Chad of Coinbase.
01:02:53.214 - 01:03:00.018, Speaker B: Coinbase to do this, they don't have to do this. This is crypto native values above and beyond, in my opinion. Pretty excited.
01:03:00.194 - 01:03:37.278, Speaker A: I don't know how much this is going to cost. I imagine a decent amount. But overall, I actually do expect this to be like expected value positive for Coinbase because from a brand perspective. From brand perspective, but also ensuring that Coinbase can integrate with other Defi projects. Maybe they don't integrate directly with tornado cash, but if they stop the unwarranted regulation at tornado cash, then they're free to do stuff that's not so ridiculous, not so dubious as privacy stuff. Just like compound aave uniswap. It really just stops the progress of dubious regulation so they don't have to fight it later.
01:03:37.278 - 01:03:38.862, Speaker A: So I think they've got to draw.
01:03:38.916 - 01:03:40.014, Speaker B: A line in the sand somewhere.
01:03:40.062 - 01:03:40.226, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:03:40.248 - 01:03:40.914, Speaker B: Is that what you're saying?
01:03:40.952 - 01:03:41.394, Speaker A: Yes, exactly.
01:03:41.432 - 01:03:54.770, Speaker B: I mean. And this is where Coinbase is drawing a line in the sand. It's great. This is a blog post from Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase. This is not legal. This is Brian Armstrong, the CEO and co founder of Coinbase. I always think things are stronger when they come from a co founder.
01:03:54.770 - 01:04:16.286, Speaker B: And the TLDR of this post is Coinbase is funding a lawsuit brought by six people challenging the US Treasury Department's sanctions of the tornado cash smart contracts and asking the court to remove them from the US sanctions list. The sanctions exceed Treasury's authority, harm innocent people, remove privacy and security options for crypto users, and stifle innovation. Well said.
01:04:16.388 - 01:04:43.266, Speaker A: Coinbase's legal officer told CNBC, it sets a dangerous precedent. If this code can be designated without any limits imposed by law, any technology, any tool or system could be fair game for also being banned. So this is what I was saying, is like Coinbase, maybe Coinbase is cool with tornado cash being banned, but they know more than tornado cash. And so in order to protect their future business models, ones that might not be alive today, they are doing this. Thank you. Thank you, Coinbase.
01:04:43.298 - 01:04:48.198, Speaker B: Well done. Did you know, David, Alex ETH is actually one of the plaintiffs here.
01:04:48.364 - 01:04:49.366, Speaker A: Alex, great guy.
01:04:49.388 - 01:05:22.894, Speaker B: This is Alex ETH on Twitter. He says, today I joined five other plaintiffs in challenging the US treasury's no FAQ sanctions against tornado cash, a regular citizen ethereum that known for a while in the space just on Twitter and other places. He's saying, I did not take this decision lightly being a plaintiff in the case. So this also required bold action by individual citizens, individual crypto natives and crypto citizens. But he said, code is speech, and free speech is a constitutional right and worth protecting. Well done, Alex.
01:05:22.942 - 01:05:24.306, Speaker A: I hope you get the poap, you.
01:05:24.328 - 01:05:30.786, Speaker B: Get the retweet, man. Good job, Alex. I'm proud of the community for doing this. David, what do we got for releases?
01:05:30.898 - 01:05:55.678, Speaker A: Releases? Today, curve USD was born new, decentralized stablecoin on the scene from curve, which is an interesting place for a stable coin to come out of because it is the source of stablecoin liquidity in all of DFI. So I expect that to be highly competitive. Not much more to report, but that's kind of big. We just are going to have to wait and see. As curve USD gets integrated into the.
01:05:55.684 - 01:06:13.422, Speaker B: Rest of DFI, finance US is launching Ethereum, staking with 6% APY. 6% of the merge. Yeah, 6%. Yeah. Binance us. All right, so it's the US. You're trying to play catch up, obviously, with Coinbase and others, and staking with a 6% APY.
01:06:13.422 - 01:06:19.414, Speaker B: David, that has to be juiced, because I know you ain't getting 6% from the protocol right now.
01:06:19.452 - 01:06:32.634, Speaker A: Probably you're getting 4%. Granted, they're only paying, it will be six ish percent post merge, so they're only juicing it for like two weeks ahead of the merge. So it's not that ridiculous. Why they're juicing it in the first place, I don't know.
01:06:32.672 - 01:06:43.402, Speaker B: Oh, promotion. It's just like promotion, right? Why would I do coinbase if Coinbase is 4% and maybe finance is 6%, if you're just not really looking carefully at it, you just choose the higher.
01:06:43.456 - 01:06:50.366, Speaker A: APY, but the yield should jump up to at least five point something percent post merge, so they're not juicing it by that much.
01:06:50.468 - 01:06:56.162, Speaker B: This is kind of cool. From notional introducing leveraged vaults from Notional. What's going on here?
01:06:56.296 - 01:07:23.082, Speaker A: Yeah, basically the way that this works is that a user, say, for example, brings 100,000 USDC into notional. That gives them a line of credit of up to $700,000 USDC. From notional for 4%. And then you can combine those two things together to deposit this into this leverage yield vault. So it's a way to get like eight x on your yield is like the TLDR of this product. Probably some risk, but also pretty cool.
01:07:23.136 - 01:07:37.998, Speaker B: Definitely some risk. Notional, of course, is fixed rate lending and borrowing, which is really super cool to have a DeFi primitive for that. But as always, with leverage. Be careful out there, guys. Do not take leverage unless you absolutely know what you're doing. And a lot of you think you know what you're doing.
01:07:38.084 - 01:07:40.538, Speaker A: Even myself at times, you find out that you don't.
01:07:40.554 - 01:07:47.458, Speaker B: You find out you don't the hard way, you get liquidated. David, on the raises side, one thing to cover. What are we looking at here?
01:07:47.544 - 01:07:56.790, Speaker A: Miston Labs is the creator of the sui sui blockchain closes $300 million raise led by FTX Ventures.
01:07:57.850 - 01:08:00.658, Speaker B: 300 million dollar raise. That's not a valuation.
01:08:00.754 - 01:08:07.320, Speaker A: No valuation is $2 billion. What, we should start a layer one.
01:08:09.950 - 01:08:13.562, Speaker B: What would be our price? 5 billion. $5 billion higher.
01:08:13.616 - 01:08:14.220, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:08:17.790 - 01:08:25.326, Speaker B: I've seen, like, this new crop of fast TPS blockchain. And you see these kind of every single cycle. Right?
01:08:25.428 - 01:08:27.214, Speaker A: See this all the time now, this is just like.
01:08:27.252 - 01:09:27.134, Speaker B: Yeah, well, the very first one, it was EOs was one of the main ones. And then later, I think in future, like it was Solana. Now, what's interesting is there seemed to be three. This one, sui, if we're saying it pronunciating it correctly, and there's another one called Sei say, I think maybe how you say that? So there's Sui say, and there's Aptos, and you're getting a lot of the FTXs and the multichain capitals and a lot of the VC firms who are funding at these levels, like $2 billion market cap types of levels. So it's just interesting to me, because we question, of course, we question all the time, what is the durable competitive advantage? Why is the token worth what it's worth as a layer one? And I guess it's the VCs taking on that risk. Right. Just, I always get worried about the retail dumpage that comes later without any significant progress on many of these projects.
01:09:27.134 - 01:09:40.382, Speaker B: And that is what can tend to happen. Although, David, I do feel like there probably could be a bankless episode where we explore these projects in some just, I want to wait until there's some traction or something to actually talk.
01:09:40.456 - 01:09:42.342, Speaker A: I'm sure they would love that if we did that.
01:09:42.396 - 01:09:53.594, Speaker B: Well, just the fundraise is kind of boring to me. It's like, what can we do? What have you built? That's the point at which we could get. But, like, I don't even know the technology stack. I know Aptos is using.
01:09:53.632 - 01:10:05.870, Speaker A: Like, there's too many, Brian. There's too many of sui say aptos. Like, one of these things is going to zero at the very least, if not all three. So somebody's wasting their money. Yeah, or mine. Just an ETH maxi or something.
01:10:05.940 - 01:10:14.574, Speaker B: Maybe David's an ETH maxi. What do you think? Bankless community? Which of these projects should we be looking at? You tell us. Jobs, David. What time is it?
01:10:14.612 - 01:10:21.602, Speaker A: Job time. Time to get a job last week to get a job before the merge. I'm not sure that matters, but it's true either way.
01:10:21.656 - 01:10:25.314, Speaker B: You think someone could turn around and get a job in like a week's time? They really.
01:10:25.432 - 01:10:25.858, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:10:25.944 - 01:10:26.820, Speaker B: Hit apply.
01:10:27.830 - 01:10:32.594, Speaker A: If they are a fitting candidate for one of these fantastic jobs that we're about to read out, maybe perhaps.
01:10:32.722 - 01:10:38.290, Speaker B: Well, I'll read them out then. Economia is looking for a lead product and brand designer. What's that, David?
01:10:38.370 - 01:10:41.354, Speaker A: Non technical with ryan silent protocol, full.
01:10:41.392 - 01:11:06.202, Speaker B: Stack smart contract engineer. Superfoam senior backend engineer. Bitgreen full stack software developer. Masari needs those software engineers for market data and media. Dydx needs a backend software engineer, Steakfish, an HR business partner. A steakfish also needs a backend, a software engineer and a front end engineer, a DevOps engineer. And of course, bankless is looking for someone to help with media operations.
01:11:06.202 - 01:11:17.042, Speaker B: Go apply for these jobs. Go get a job before the merge if you can. The merge is fine, too. Crypto is always hiring in the bankless job boards. That's bankless palette.com slash jobs. You can find out more.
01:11:17.042 - 01:11:19.590, Speaker B: All right, David, what do we have coming up next?
01:11:19.660 - 01:11:47.274, Speaker A: Got some questions for the nation. This is when we talk about some of the ethpow questions, ETH stake questions, overall, merge related questions, because, Ryan, it's of course, the last weekly roll up before the merge. I don't know if you mentioned that yet, but we got to answer all the merge questions, so we'll talk about that. And also the hot and spicy takes from crypto. Twitter coming up next. But first, let's talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible. Arbitrum is an ethereum L2 scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use DFI and NFTs.
01:11:47.274 - 01:12:45.022, Speaker A: Some of the coolest new NFT collections have chosen arbitrum as their home while DFI protocols continue to see increased liquidity and usage, you can now bridge straight into Arbitrum from more than ten different exchanges, including finance, FTX, Huobi, and crypto.com. Once on Arbitrum, you'll enjoy fast transactions with cheap fees, allowing you to explore new frontiers of the crypto universe. New to Arbitrum for a limited time, you can get arbitram NFTs, designed by the famous artists Ratwell and Sugoy for joining the Arbitrum Odyssey. The Odyssey is an eight week long event where you complete on chain activities and receive a free NFT as a reward. Find out more by visiting the Discord at Discord GG Arbitrum. You can also bridge your assets to Arbitrum at Bridge Arbitrum IO and access all of Arbitrum's apps at Portal Arbitrum one in order to experience DFI and nfts the way it was always meant to be, fast, cheap, secure, and fiction free, the L2 era is upon us. Ethereum's L2 ecosystem is growing every day, and we need L2 bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a L2 life.
01:12:45.022 - 01:13:26.926, Speaker A: Across is the fastest, cheapest and most secure crosschain bridge. With across, you don't have to worry about high fees or long wait times. Assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously. Across's bridges are powered by UMA's optimistic Oracle to securely transfer tokens between L2s and Ethereum across its critical ecosystem infrastructure and across V two has just launched. Their new version focuses on higher capital efficiency, L2 to L2 transfers, and a brand new chain with Polygon, all while prioritizing high security and low fees. You can be a part of Across's story by joining their discord and using across for all of your L2 transferring needs. So go to across to quickly and securely bridge your assets between Ethereum, optimism, Polygon, Arbitrum, or Boba networks we are.
01:13:26.948 - 01:14:01.570, Speaker B: Back with the questions from the nation. Of course, if you've got a question for the weekly rollup you can follow at bankless HQ on Twitter. Look for that question the week. Respond and we may read your question out on the roll up and answer it to the best of our ability. The first one is from Johnnycast ETH. Will I receive ETH proof of work for the staked ETH I have? What about if it's staked on a centralized exchange or in an ETH staking derivative? So this person wants to know. Johnny cast wants to know if he is getting a fork of the ETH pow token should it come.
01:14:01.660 - 01:14:44.102, Speaker A: He is asking if he's going to receive the ETH proof of work token if he has ether staked. And if you have ether staked, that answer is no. No you are not, because that ether is in the deposit contract on the ethereum side, which is where people deposit ether into the beacon chain. The only reason why you deposit ether into that contract is to tell the beacon chain to mint you some ether on the proof of stake beacon chain. It's a one way street, it only goes into that contract, there's no way to get it out of that contract. So all staked ether on the ethereum chain when it goes into the proof of work chain will be irredeemable. The proof of work ether will be in that same contract on the proof of work side, but there's no way to get that out.
01:14:44.102 - 01:14:55.818, Speaker A: So all staked ether is not redeemable for proof of work ether doesn't matter where you staked it on a centralized exchange or with lido or rocket pool. That ether is gone. That proof of work ether is gone.
01:14:55.904 - 01:15:06.542, Speaker B: But to our point earlier, guys, who cares? It's probably almost nothing. It's probably pennies. It does make sense for a proof of work fork to kind of punish those who staked, right?
01:15:06.676 - 01:15:08.634, Speaker A: But that's not what it is, that's a byproduct.
01:15:08.762 - 01:15:15.826, Speaker B: It's a byproduct, but it's kind of interesting what's happening. What about on centralized exchange then? What happens there?
01:15:15.848 - 01:15:26.034, Speaker A: Or in staking driven, any supply of staked ether will be irredeemable. So they won't be giving you anything because they don't have anything to give you.
01:15:26.152 - 01:15:36.854, Speaker B: The keyword is there is staked. It's the staked piece, right? If it is on a centralized exchange and it's not staked, then it's totally dependent on the exchange, which then the.
01:15:36.892 - 01:15:38.294, Speaker A: Exchange has to facilitate that.
01:15:38.332 - 01:15:42.330, Speaker B: Yeah, that could be months down the road or never, so don't expect much.
01:15:42.400 - 01:15:50.394, Speaker A: I think if the price moons because people are doing shenanigans, they'll enable it. Then they'll enable it because people will desire it.
01:15:50.512 - 01:16:14.370, Speaker B: Yes. Here's another question from Matt. In the first few hours after the merge, is ETH proof of work value? We'll receive equal the value of our ETH proof of stake. So can we double our ETH holdings if we exchange the proof of work for the proof of stake as soon as possible? This is another question. I think there's been a lot of questions about this new proof of work hypothetical chain. What's the answer to Matt's question here?
01:16:14.440 - 01:17:00.926, Speaker A: Well, so we saw the chart earlier that was doing a futures market for $30. For a proof of work ether, you will have the same number of units, but the market prices on these things will be totally different. And so after Armageddon on the proof of work chain happens because all ether positions in Makerdao ave compound will be liquidated. All tokens on uniswap like MKR ave will be worth zero. And so those people who have those will liquidate those. There's going to be just like y two k on the Ethereum beacon chain on the block one, two and three after the dust settles. Then the proof of work ether will have some sort of value determined by the market that will be significantly, meaningfully lower than the actual ether, real ether, proof of stake ether.
01:17:00.926 - 01:17:09.698, Speaker A: And then if you are sophisticated and you can set up the infrastructure, you can sell the proof of work ether. Can you? Yeah, on Poloniax, because they say they're going to support it.
01:17:09.784 - 01:17:11.154, Speaker B: Maybe if you could find an exchange.
01:17:11.202 - 01:17:18.214, Speaker A: You can find an exchange. There's not going to be a uniswap, yo, it's only going to be centralized exchanges that facilitate this market decides to.
01:17:18.252 - 01:17:29.210, Speaker B: Kind of pick that up and run. Yeah, it's going to be really hard to escape from. And what we're talking about here, even in the futures market, it's like $31 per ETH. Basically. It's kind of what you'd get.
01:17:29.360 - 01:17:35.694, Speaker A: I do not think anyone will be seeing a dime. Very few people will see a dime.
01:17:35.892 - 01:17:39.166, Speaker B: Like normal highly motivated retail people who.
01:17:39.188 - 01:17:46.970, Speaker A: Are running both a consensus node on the beacon chain. Well, no, actually, just look, Dave, the.
01:17:46.980 - 01:17:49.490, Speaker B: People asking these questions are probably getting nothing.
01:17:49.560 - 01:18:31.758, Speaker A: Yeah, if you don't know how to do it, you're not getting it. Sorry. The best thing, okay, if you are a retail and you are super bullish on trying to get that ETH proof of work token, the thing that I would do, even though I'm not recommending you to do this in the first place, is to deposit your ether into Poloniex, because Poloniax, the exchange, even though it's run by a very shady individual, Justin sun said that they are going to support the ether proof of work chain and so they will do all the service for you. So if you are somehow after listening to this magically still bullish on the ETH proof of work chain, and you don't know how to go do it yourself, deposit your ether into Ploniax. They said that they will credit people with their proof of work ether and then you can just use them to do it. I don't recommend you doing that, but that's how you would do it.
01:18:31.924 - 01:18:33.022, Speaker B: But also don't do it.
01:18:33.076 - 01:18:36.202, Speaker A: Also just don't fucking do it. Sorry for swearing.
01:18:36.346 - 01:18:58.278, Speaker B: Here's a question from Henry JK four. This may be basic, but with the ETH I have, when the merch happens, will I get new ETH or will my existing ETH convert to the proof of stake chain? Can you explain this for me? Thanks so much for all you guys have been doing. Been listening for about a year now. So what does the average person ignore the ETH, proof of work, proof of stake, ignore all of that. You're just holding ETH right now.
01:18:58.364 - 01:18:58.966, Speaker A: What do you got to do?
01:18:58.988 - 01:19:05.030, Speaker B: And yeah, what do you have to do on the other side? Is there anything that you have to do? What happens to your existing ETH that you're holding?
01:19:05.190 - 01:19:21.486, Speaker A: Nothing changes. Remember we saw that pie chart. There's a 95% of validators are ready. That's because 95% of people, and it's going to approach 99% are ready to do the hot swap. Your ether doesn't convert. It doesn't change form. It doesn't do anything.
01:19:21.486 - 01:19:36.158, Speaker A: You actually won't even notice anything at all happening whatsoever. Maybe there will be a blip in ether scan or something. Ideally just a blip. But just like your ether that you have today is proof of stake Ether once we hit post merge.
01:19:36.254 - 01:19:43.800, Speaker B: So if you're an ETH holder, what do you have to do? Nothing. If you're a defi user, what do you have to do? Nothing.
01:19:44.890 - 01:19:47.942, Speaker A: Maybe monitor your positions if you're on leverage or something like that.
01:19:47.996 - 01:19:50.186, Speaker B: Sure. If you're levered up or doing something like that.
01:19:50.208 - 01:19:50.394, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:19:50.432 - 01:20:00.198, Speaker B: Pay attention, pay some attention. If you are running a node, ethereum node, you got to update. Well, you will have already have updated your nodes.
01:20:00.214 - 01:20:02.054, Speaker A: If you haven't updated your nodes, you got to update your nodes.
01:20:02.102 - 01:20:02.726, Speaker B: You're late.
01:20:02.838 - 01:20:04.418, Speaker A: Yeah, you're late, but not too late.
01:20:04.454 - 01:20:13.114, Speaker B: But if you're not running a node, if you're just an ETH holder or a general defi user is not on leverage, nothing you have to do, it just transfers gracefully.
01:20:13.162 - 01:20:17.466, Speaker A: You can tune into all of the live streams. That's what you can do. Many, many live streams a day.
01:20:17.508 - 01:20:21.570, Speaker B: Next week we're doing a lot of those. We went over the schedule earlier, didn't we?
01:20:21.640 - 01:20:22.754, Speaker A: Yes, we did. Okay, cool.
01:20:22.792 - 01:20:25.326, Speaker B: Schedule. All right. Takes the week, David.
01:20:25.358 - 01:20:25.970, Speaker A: Takes the week.
01:20:26.040 - 01:20:30.610, Speaker B: This is from Tim Baco, who is an e, I guess, core developer. Core coordinator.
01:20:30.690 - 01:20:34.210, Speaker A: Core developer coordinator, yeah. Works for the Ethereum foundations.
01:20:34.290 - 01:20:35.670, Speaker B: He person that made the merge happen.
01:20:35.740 - 01:20:50.650, Speaker A: Yeah. Him and Danny Ryan are like the two people that made the merge happen. And Tim Baco. That's putting too much weight on their shoulders. Many people made the merge happen. Tim was a coordinator of many of these people. And Tim Baco says, I've said we might have merged by then.
01:20:50.650 - 01:21:03.050, Speaker A: Twice on the core dev meeting today, and it feels pretty surreal, to be honest. It's happening. Sparkly emoji. Really cool take. Really cool take. We're already talking about just like, after the merge, the state of things after the merge.
01:21:03.130 - 01:21:27.906, Speaker B: It's happening. So much work to get us here, and it's actually happening. The Ethereum community has been waiting for so long for this week to happen, and it's actually happening in spite of so many doubters who said the merge would never happen. Ethereum, there's no way it'll transition to proof of stake. It's like replacing an airline engine in midair. Too complicated, too difficult protocol.
01:21:27.938 - 01:21:29.910, Speaker A: Devs were like, challenge accepted.
01:21:30.570 - 01:21:32.026, Speaker B: Awesome. I've got it again.
01:21:32.128 - 01:21:34.620, Speaker A: Knock on wood. Against the whole, like, Hillary Clinton thing.
01:21:35.230 - 01:21:52.782, Speaker B: This is a tweet from me this week. You're old, but are you old enough to remember this? And this is. I'm showing an image. If you can't see it on the podcast side, you can catch it on YouTube. This is an image of the original maker Dao interface. David, do you remember when Maker looked like this?
01:21:52.836 - 01:22:23.546, Speaker A: I do remember, and I remember experiencing this interface being frustrated but also optimistic and then finally figuring out how to mint Dai for the first time and seeing the DAI show up in my wallet. And I didn't obviously have any concrete predictions, but you could just feel the future, like, no, I did not know uniswap would be a thing, but I kind of figured there would be something like it. Yes. This is automated algorithmic, financed by code. And this was like my magic aha moment. It's like I just minted money, and.
01:22:23.568 - 01:22:34.510, Speaker B: No one stopped minted money. I just took out a loan. No bank, no bank account, no paperwork, just code and ETH transactions. It was incredible.
01:22:36.130 - 01:22:42.250, Speaker A: Could you imagine this if all DFI interfaces were like, this level of just, like, clunkiness?
01:22:42.330 - 01:22:54.878, Speaker B: Now, what we're looking at is an interface that looks like it was from, I guess, 2017 or so. 2017, 2018. But it looks like it's from the early 2000s. Yeah, I mean, it is just terrible.
01:22:54.974 - 01:22:57.574, Speaker A: The US experience did the job it needed to do at the time.
01:22:57.612 - 01:23:04.070, Speaker B: So this is like the old grandpa David and grandpa Ryan saying to you, youngsters, you got it good kids.
01:23:04.220 - 01:23:06.102, Speaker A: Your interfaces are great.
01:23:06.236 - 01:23:08.970, Speaker B: They're so good compared to the old days.
01:23:09.120 - 01:23:13.574, Speaker A: They don't even know what Peeth is. They don't even know what Peeth is. Pe say peeth. Peeth.
01:23:13.622 - 01:23:22.234, Speaker B: I said path. I said path. We didn't even have a consensus on whether it's path or, oh God, remember.
01:23:22.272 - 01:23:27.966, Speaker A: When people would say ETH? Yeah, instead of ETH. I hate it. I hated that.
01:23:28.148 - 01:23:39.730, Speaker B: Your interfaces have gotten much better and the rate at which they are improving makes me so bullish on this. Know if I contrast that to my interface for my bank, Wells Fargo. Right. It's like no change in the last five years.
01:23:39.800 - 01:23:40.242, Speaker A: So bad.
01:23:40.296 - 01:23:46.034, Speaker B: But it's basically the same as it was five years ago. It's like equally kind of terrible, right? What's this take from?
01:23:46.072 - 01:24:05.898, Speaker A: Polenia says a swap on finance smart chain is five times more expensive than arbitrum, yet finance smart chain has ten times the activity BSE has established clear network effects, particularly in the eastern markets. And roll up teams have to do their marketing, have to up their marketing game significantly to outcompete BSE their stiffest competition. Interesting take.
01:24:05.984 - 01:24:34.434, Speaker B: What do you think about this? The idea plenty goes on to say, today I learned Binance smart chain are building zk roll ups. Can you imagine running a ZK roll up L2 on top of Binance smart chain? And this is plenty. Who knows what they're talking about, really. Not necessarily bullish on Binance, like the token behind binance smart chain, but certainly it's establishing it as the one to beat for other L2s. What do you think of this take?
01:24:34.552 - 01:25:08.462, Speaker A: Yeah, I heard Anthony Cesano on the daily grade talk about this, and I think a lot of this comes down to language, as in there might just be more chinese or english language support of the binance chain ecosystem. And so it's kind of accidentally become like the ethereum of the east just based off the language barrier. I think that actually does account for a very decent amount. And just like the raw power of finance is also big in the east, too, I think that chalks up to more than 50% of the reasoning why finance chain is so big.
01:25:08.516 - 01:25:26.130, Speaker B: I think this is a good message for L2s. If you want to onboard the world, you have to have multiregional, multi language support. Right. It's a key component of this. Anyway, I'd like to do a bit more on binance smart chain. I'm not super interested in the technology, but the adoption it's had and where it's coming from is somewhat interesting to me.
01:25:26.200 - 01:25:43.178, Speaker A: Right, here's another tweet from Ryan, Sean Adams, who's been super focused on just like, reserve currencies and war and all this stuff. And so we're going to hear his takes here in a hot sec. Ryan says reserve currency statuses rise and fall over the decades. I expect Ethereum to be one of the next ones to rise. Ryan, what are we looking at?
01:25:43.264 - 01:26:02.502, Speaker B: We are looking at a pie chart over time. And the way this begins is at the beginning of the 19 hundreds. Let me take you back to 19 one, when the british pound was 60% of the world's reserve currency. Do you know what's second, David? The french franc.
01:26:02.586 - 01:26:03.874, Speaker A: I don't remember that one.
01:26:03.992 - 01:26:37.430, Speaker B: And then behind that pound sterling. No, excuse me, behind that Deutsche mark. And there's also a category for, you know, british pound, by far the world's reserve currency. And then this kind of fast forwards through time. And you can see the british pound is a percentage of the world. It kind of ebbs and flows through World War I, through World War II, and we fast forward all the way to. Even after World War II, in the 1950s, the british pound still had, like, 45% today, I learned.
01:26:37.430 - 01:26:55.222, Speaker B: Right. But then the US dollar, which wasn't even present in 19 one, wasn't even on the map for a world reserve currency, is now 46% of the world's currency. And then we fast forward to, of course, where we are today. Can you see the british pound anymore on the chart?
01:26:55.306 - 01:26:57.678, Speaker A: No, it got folded into the euro.
01:26:57.854 - 01:27:00.114, Speaker B: Got folded? Well, it's still present. It got.
01:27:00.152 - 01:27:00.626, Speaker A: Oh, wait, no.
01:27:00.648 - 01:27:01.986, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, it's still present there.
01:27:02.008 - 01:27:03.374, Speaker A: It's 4.5%. It's tiny.
01:27:03.422 - 01:27:21.130, Speaker B: It's tiny. It's 4.5%. You got the euro, that's 20%. And the US dollar, that is 61%. I think the take here is just when you see this chart over time, the fleeting nature of reserve currencies. Reserve currencies is something to hold on to. And this looks a lot like 19 one.
01:27:21.130 - 01:27:31.850, Speaker B: Right? When the british pound was the dominant reserve currency. Now we're in 2022 and the US dollar is about 60%. All right, David, what are you bullish on this week?
01:27:31.920 - 01:28:37.966, Speaker A: Ryan, I am bullish on the ETH BTC ratio, as I have been. And Djen Spartan put out a pretty cool tweet that talked about how much of etHBTC people that are taking on this trade, such as myself, will be permanently unwound post merge, he says. I expect a drop from the people that think it's an airdrop play, lmfao, but I expect it to be one of the greatest paradigm shifts in hindsight as ETH goes from a zero to one as a hoarding asset, and flows will be one directional. And then I follow up and I say the point of the ETH BTC trade is to hold it, and it's not just like a momentary thing, because that's how press said on our show with him, once we go through the merge, time works with ether and against bitcoin, because with proof of work, it theoretically approaches 100% of all sell pressure from proof of work miners. And with proof of stake, it's the inverse. It's the theoretical 100% gets held by proof of stake stakers. So every single dime of proof of work miners gets sold, every single penny of ether stakers gets held.
01:28:37.966 - 01:29:04.726, Speaker A: Again, in principle, these things are probably more around, like 90%. But that just goes to the contrast is time works with ether and it works against bitcoin. And so if you are somebody like myself who short bitcoin and long ether, the point of that trade is that it just works. So people are super focused on the flipping rounds. Ether is 53% the market cap of bitcoin. At some point, it'll flip bitcoin. I have 100% confidence in this eventually.
01:29:04.726 - 01:29:12.634, Speaker A: But the trade is not over there either. Once you flip bitcoin, you can flip it again. You can lap bitcoin over and over.
01:29:12.672 - 01:29:15.646, Speaker B: And over again, shilling his ETH bitcoin ratio bags to you.
01:29:15.668 - 01:29:22.222, Speaker A: Yes, I am. I'm shilling my trade. It's like I'll unwind my ether bitcoin trade. When ether, ethereum is worth, like, three.
01:29:22.276 - 01:29:30.206, Speaker B: Bitcoins, that's a hold forever. Wow. Are you mad at bitcoin at all? Is there any vindictiveness in that trade?
01:29:30.238 - 01:29:53.622, Speaker A: No, it's just that. It's just the flows. It's just the factual flows. If proof of work is forced selling and proof of stake is incentivized hoarding, this is why Djen is saying ether goes from zero to one as a hoarding asset, and flows will be run directional. It's just a fundamental part of the fundamentals. I'm not trading narratives. I'm trading the fundamentals.
01:29:53.766 - 01:29:58.202, Speaker B: I've been hoarding this thing for a while. I didn't just start hoarding zero to one.
01:29:58.256 - 01:30:03.706, Speaker A: Been hoarding right. You want to hoard ahead of the transition from zero to one.
01:30:03.888 - 01:30:06.282, Speaker B: Ideally. There's still time. Of course.
01:30:06.336 - 01:30:10.142, Speaker A: That's what I've been. Oh, you know what? I'm also bullish on Ryan. You know what I'm about to go do after this?
01:30:10.196 - 01:30:10.800, Speaker B: No.
01:30:11.330 - 01:30:13.294, Speaker A: You know this guy Zach Weinberg?
01:30:13.342 - 01:30:32.600, Speaker B: Yes. I saw a clip with him with andreessen, Mark Andreessen, where he's kind of playing an Andreessen clip and just, like, digging into how stupid it is. Andreessen's answer, I think, on what web3 means. So this person is. Zach is a web3 crypto critic, I believe.
01:30:32.970 - 01:30:40.070, Speaker A: Yeah. Right after this, I'm about to go into Manhattan and debate him on stage at some Vc founders conference.
01:30:40.570 - 01:30:41.880, Speaker B: That'll be fun.
01:30:44.330 - 01:30:55.214, Speaker A: I don't think it is. I don't think it is. But if it is, I will definitely tweet it out. But, yeah, me, and I was listening to him. I didn't listen to his Andreessen clip, so I got to go listen to that. But I did listen to him going up against Mccormick. Yes.
01:30:55.214 - 01:31:11.294, Speaker A: And I'm like, dude, paki, you are missing some really low hanging fruit points here. And so I don't think that Zach Weinberg has gone up against any sort of meaningful competition yet until 2 hours from now when I smear his. Kidding. I'm kidding. I'm super aggressive.
01:31:11.342 - 01:31:15.826, Speaker B: David pre merged. David is like, know I've had an.
01:31:15.848 - 01:31:16.914, Speaker A: Extra cup of coffee today.
01:31:16.952 - 01:31:30.562, Speaker B: He's got the adrenaline. Watch out, Zach. I think it'll be good, actually. I think if that goes well. Sorry, I caught it. An episode. If that debate goes well, we should host him on bankless and have kind of a review of another one of that because we need some more critics.
01:31:30.626 - 01:31:36.140, Speaker A: If he's a good round two. Ding, ding, ding. All right, Ryan, what are you bullish on? Who are you debating this week?
01:31:36.590 - 01:31:58.994, Speaker B: I'm not debating anyone if I can help it, all right? I just want good vibes into the merge. I don't want no hassle. But you know what I am bullish on or what? Maybe this is kind of a thank you. This is a gratitude. The ETH developers we saw earlier, about 120 core developers, a lot of ETH developers, made the merge happen, and we know some of them. We don't know all of them. All right.
01:31:59.032 - 01:32:00.002, Speaker A: We don't know most of them.
01:32:00.056 - 01:32:22.278, Speaker B: We don't know most of them, and particularly the silent people have been just coding in the background making this happen. Sincerely, thank you. I think the entire Ethereum community has you to thank, we can't build this. Dave and I are here working on the social layer. We're users. We're building in a different way. But none of this would be possible without the Ethereum developers, the core developers.
01:32:22.278 - 01:32:36.318, Speaker B: And I remember a time when everyone said no one thought they could do it. Do you remember back in 2018, a lot of the talk was, there's not enough funding for the devs to actually do this.
01:32:36.404 - 01:32:37.454, Speaker A: You don't have any money.
01:32:37.572 - 01:33:19.242, Speaker B: There was semi serious propositions to actually add a protocol dev tax inside of the protocol to siphon off a portion of this and give it to devs to fund it. We did this without protocol funding. We did this with frustrating roadmap pivots. Do you remember in 2018 we were supposed to get proof of stake? We were like months away from forking it in an earlier version of it, and the roadmap completely changed. A better version was in sight, so we just pivoted towards the better version. Right. Kind of patience does that require to keep along with the project? It's like delayed for another five years.
01:33:19.242 - 01:34:03.226, Speaker B: They've been working on this stuff, and they did it all without a centralized corporation, all in this decentralized, open source way. And I don't think there's any precedent for what we are seeing, like launching a staking protocol like this, which is maximally decentralized at scale, and converting it in real time with a network that's worth hundreds of billions of dollars in real time. That's what's happening next week. I think it's a historic event, and I am bullish and thankful for the Ethereum developers. And, man, this protocol can ship. I didn't always know that was true. I didn't always believe that, but we're doing it now, so that's what I'm bullish on.
01:34:03.328 - 01:34:34.966, Speaker A: Yeah. Every single client team has 810, 20 people on its team that have been working on this, and there's like six, seven client teams. That's not even to account for all the people at the EF also helping coordinate this thing. So the image that came to mind while you're talking is just like the picture of Atlas, and they have all the core teams, like, holding up Ethereum. Everyone who's ever used Ethereum and is bullish on the merge has a core developer to think. Have you thanked a core developer this week? Because if you haven't, please do. We should make that into a meme next week.
01:34:34.966 - 01:34:36.310, Speaker A: Have you thanked a core dev yet?
01:34:36.380 - 01:34:37.960, Speaker B: Thank you. Thank you.
01:34:38.730 - 01:34:39.606, Speaker A: Ryan did just now.
01:34:39.628 - 01:34:50.326, Speaker B: That's what he was first. I feel like there's other things I could be doing. But yeah, we appreciate the Ethereum development community for sure. David meme of the week, what are we looking at? This week?
01:34:50.428 - 01:35:21.182, Speaker A: We were looking at the Patrick SpongeBob meme. That is like, what if we take this and put it over there? Ethereum miners. This was the headline from earlier on the roll up. Ethereum miners made $756,000,000 in revenue in August ahead of the merge. And Patrick, the meme goes, what if we take the minor revenue and give it to the stakers? Basically what the Ethereum proof of stake mechanism is, although you do have to take note that we are doing a supply reduction of 90%. So actually only 10% of the stakers get that. But also stakers are holders of ETH.
01:35:21.182 - 01:35:29.430, Speaker A: And so since the miners aren't dumping the ETH, they do get the benefit of not having ether dumped on them by miners. So I will say that they get the full value of that.
01:35:29.580 - 01:35:53.354, Speaker B: It's true. It's what's happening. The stakers are the new security budget for Ethereum, essentially, and so, right, I mean, this notion of ether as a tokenized ASiC, basically, I think is holding true. So that's what's happening. Next week, of course, David and I will be with you all week. Make sure you tune into bankless podcasts and on YouTube and of course on Twitter. We'll leave it there.
01:35:53.354 - 01:36:07.102, Speaker B: None of this has been financial advice. ETH is risky, Defi is risky. So is all of crypto. You could definitely lose what you put in, but we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone. But we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey.
01:36:07.102 - 01:36:07.906, Speaker B: Thanks a lot.
