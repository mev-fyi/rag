00:00:10.290 - 00:00:49.422, Speaker A: You. All right, I'm going to show you how to become a uniswap LP in argent in under 30 seconds. So click the invest button, scroll down to uniswap v two liquidity. Choose whatever pool you want to become a market maker in, then click the buy investment button, and then put in however much ether you want. I'm going to put in about $25 worth and click the invest button. And that's good. So it's going to split my ether in this case into 50% dai, 50% ether, which then allows me to be a market maker and earn fees whenever someone trades between Dai and ether in Uniswap, fee two.
00:00:49.422 - 00:01:10.630, Speaker A: And then argent subsidizes all the gas. So you can see my transaction still in progress, but it should settle in a few minutes. So after the transaction settles, you'll see it in the finances tab here at the bottom, the die eth pool. And that's a univ two token. So that's it. And I hope you find this helpful.
