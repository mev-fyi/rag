00:00:00.250 - 00:00:14.080, Speaker A: SBF coming home extradited to the US prison wasn't so great for him, so he wanted to, you know, work his way home. Brian Armstrong makes regulation proposals that we wish that we had. And also, Visa steps into the ethereum frontier. What does that mean?
00:00:16.530 - 00:00:21.390, Speaker B: Bankless nation. It is the Friday before the holidays, david, what time is it?
00:00:21.460 - 00:00:31.670, Speaker A: Oh, it's the Bankless Friday weekly roll up, Brian, where we cover the entire weekly news in crypto, which is always an ambitious endeavor. And we are almost at the finish line of 2022. Thank the Lord.
00:00:32.090 - 00:00:32.840, Speaker B: Yes.
00:00:33.610 - 00:00:38.406, Speaker A: And so, if you have not yet grabbed a morning coffee to enjoy the weekly news in crypto with us, please.
00:00:38.428 - 00:00:42.874, Speaker B: Do put some Bailey's in this one because let's get festive today.
00:00:42.912 - 00:00:43.418, Speaker A: Why not?
00:00:43.504 - 00:00:52.554, Speaker B: All the calls I've been having with people have been like they've been at their parents house or something, like visiting family this week. And you are there too, right? So you're on the west coast today.
00:00:52.672 - 00:01:00.350, Speaker A: I am freezing my absolute tail off in the bottom of my sister's house with a sleeping baby in the next room. So this is a different kind of weekly roll up, guys.
00:01:00.420 - 00:01:21.586, Speaker B: I want you to know this level of dedication, all right? This is what David Hoffman does on his holiday while he's with family sleeping babies. It's the crack of dawn when the West Coast, there's no sun out. And we're still getting a weekly roll up to you, of course, right before I take off myself. All right, David, so what are we going to talk about this week? What are the topics?
00:01:21.698 - 00:01:32.030, Speaker A: Of course, there are some SBF updates. He is no longer Ryan in the Bahamas. He is in New York with hanging out with the what's?
00:01:32.050 - 00:01:33.580, Speaker B: Just visiting family, too?
00:01:34.110 - 00:01:56.794, Speaker A: Just visiting temporarily or perhaps more permanent. So we'll talk about all of the SBF drama. Caroline Ellison. Apparently cooperating with the fed. So we'll talk about that, too. Brian Armstrong proposes crypto legislation that we wish we had, so we'll unpack all of that. And also, Visa is taking a big step into the frontier of ethereum protocol development.
00:01:56.794 - 00:01:59.330, Speaker A: We'll talk about all of that and more.
00:01:59.480 - 00:02:32.106, Speaker B: One of the things as well that's going on this week is Binance is talking about bailing out Voyager, doing the thing that SBF promised to do but was never able to manage. So that's an emerging story as well. David, we got our friends and sponsors, Kraken, to tell you guys about today. Kraken is a crypto platform that did not rug us in 2022. There are a few crypto platforms that I recommend coming out of that crazy year that we just had to people, and Kraken is one of those can you tell them why?
00:02:32.208 - 00:03:04.326, Speaker A: Yeah. Kraken is one of these few exchanges that are living and breathing the ethos of crypto to the best of their ability while also being a centralized exchange. And that is why we are choosing to work with Kraken in 2023 as our strategic sponsor. Because, Ryan, they use cryptography to empower individuals. These are words that I love. And so with their proof of reserve system, they allow their users to verify their own liabilities inside of Kraken. And just when we interviewed Jesse Powell, he just exuded the crypto Ethos that I know that you and I are all about.
00:03:04.326 - 00:03:16.362, Speaker A: And we still need centralized exchanges to go bankless. That is many, many people's first step. And so we are working with Kraken in two and 1023 more closely to emphasize the best of what their product has to offer for the Bankless world.
00:03:16.496 - 00:03:45.922, Speaker B: Yeah, I think, look, when it comes to a centralized crypto platform, if you're a customer of that platform, you should have the ability to verify whether the crypto platform has your deposits and whether they're backed by real assets, full stop. And Kraken has a proof of reserves system that they have rolled out to do that. They've been doing proof of reserves for a long time. You can find out more about that in the link in the Show Notes. That's Kraken.com. David let's get to the markets, man. What's Bitcoin doing to us today?
00:03:46.056 - 00:04:01.270, Speaker A: It's going down. It started at 17,000 rather than for us. Exactly. Okay, we are feeling the Bitcoin. Yeah, it is at 17,700 at the start of the week, ending the week at 16,700, down about 6% on the week, down 6%.
00:04:01.420 - 00:04:02.022, Speaker B: Okay.
00:04:02.156 - 00:04:11.402, Speaker A: Yeah, this is a little bit of the timing of the measurement. We just happened to start last week at a little bit of a high and now we're kind of back to like two weeks is flat, but like.
00:04:11.456 - 00:04:14.714, Speaker B: 1600, that doesn't feel great, does it?
00:04:14.752 - 00:04:15.158, Speaker A: No, it doesn't.
00:04:15.174 - 00:04:20.314, Speaker B: I mean, we are below the 2017 all time high, aren't we, for Bitcoin?
00:04:20.362 - 00:04:21.390, Speaker A: By a lot. Yeah.
00:04:21.540 - 00:04:28.430, Speaker B: How about ETH? That's also below the 2018. Yeah. What's ETH doing on the week?
00:04:28.500 - 00:04:37.650, Speaker A: Down 6% on the week as well. 1270, down to 1200. A little bit more than Bitcoin. Bitcoin was a little bit less than six. ETH is a little bit more than 6% down on the week.
00:04:37.800 - 00:04:45.958, Speaker B: Guys, I don't think we're going to get our bullish recovery, our V shaped recovery in 2022. I feel like that's a safe one to call. David yeah, people were down.
00:04:46.044 - 00:04:51.670, Speaker A: People were kind of bullish for a green December, but December so far seems to be pretty weak.
00:04:51.830 - 00:05:16.462, Speaker B: And we're down on the year. Like, if we look at the yeah, we're down. What do you mean? Well, no, actually, no, ETH was like, at the start of this year, so December 23 of last year. I remember it being in like, the 800s, something like this. So I think we're up from that, at least. Wow, look at the charts. It seemed like a long time ago.
00:05:16.516 - 00:05:20.434, Speaker A: No, you're skipping you're two years. You're thinking in two years right now.
00:05:20.472 - 00:05:21.042, Speaker B: Am I really?
00:05:21.096 - 00:05:25.150, Speaker A: Yes, you are. Yeah. Because ETH was $4,000 in December of last year.
00:05:25.320 - 00:05:32.360, Speaker B: Guys, the years are not blending together. Okay, cancel that. That was wrong.
00:05:33.210 - 00:05:34.518, Speaker A: Zoom out to two years and you.
00:05:34.524 - 00:05:38.294, Speaker B: Can I was thinking about 2020 December, wasn't I?
00:05:38.332 - 00:05:50.134, Speaker A: Yeah. You got confused because we were recently talking about this when we were doing our ETH bullcase, or ETH with the bulls that we recently did, which I believe comes out Monday. Yeah, it does. You were thinking in two year time frames. Sorry, brother.
00:05:50.182 - 00:05:51.418, Speaker B: All right, so we're up on the.
00:05:51.424 - 00:05:52.522, Speaker A: Two year, though, David.
00:05:52.586 - 00:05:56.350, Speaker B: That's the silver lining. But look at the one year. Wow.
00:05:56.500 - 00:05:59.006, Speaker A: One year is literally down only.
00:05:59.188 - 00:06:03.214, Speaker B: We were 4K last year at this time on ETH. Definitely down.
00:06:03.252 - 00:06:06.386, Speaker A: Definitely in complete denial of the bear market.
00:06:06.488 - 00:06:12.850, Speaker B: Yeah, I basically was subconsciously for a minute there. How about the ETH bitcoin ratio? What's that looking like?
00:06:12.920 - 00:06:17.910, Speaker A: ETH bitcoin ratio down one and a half percent. We are down to 0.7. 118.
00:06:19.370 - 00:06:30.582, Speaker B: We shaved off a nice $2 trillion this year in terms of crypto market cap, I believe. And we are under a trillion dollars. What's this number this week, David?
00:06:30.646 - 00:06:37.610, Speaker A: Yeah, we were at roughly 900 billion in total market cap last week. 837,000,000,000 is the total market cap this week.
00:06:37.680 - 00:07:07.974, Speaker B: Oof, yikes. A few trillion down. But I want to say to everyone listening to Bankless, and we know you guys have been with us through this mighty fall, from 4000 all the way down to 1200. Congratulations to you, because you have survived 2022. It's almost over. This is a market that, as I just mentioned, is 2 trillion down from the top in crypto. That's a lot of zeros down.
00:07:07.974 - 00:07:39.242, Speaker B: We've also suffered the worst inflation, David, in over 40 years. And we had the death of one of the three largest crypto exchanges this year. FTX just evaporated. SBF is literally in jail right now. And not just an exchange, an Algo stablecoin. All of the biggest lending platforms, celsius, BlockFi, Voyager, the biggest hedge funds in crypto, all evaporated last year. And yet you, you are still here, you are still listening.
00:07:39.242 - 00:07:47.570, Speaker B: You survived. And I think that is worthy of some holiday celebration. Congratulations for surviving 2022. You've definitely earned it.
00:07:47.640 - 00:08:15.878, Speaker A: Yeah. It's worth noting that it was not easy to do that. It was not easy to get through 2022. And this is one of the if you zoom out as to what crypto is going to do for society and for all markets, all financial markets, holding on to your crypto assets from now into 20 years from now is not easy. People get whipped off by volatility. They get enticed by leverage. They play in the shitcoin casino.
00:08:15.878 - 00:08:21.258, Speaker A: If you are still around, congrats. That was not a hard thing to do. That took mental resolve.
00:08:21.434 - 00:08:30.478, Speaker B: That's the thing. When you say, David, it's not easy, you're absolutely right, it is not easy. And yet, David, it is so simple. It's simple.
00:08:30.564 - 00:08:31.646, Speaker A: It's not easy.
00:08:31.828 - 00:09:02.874, Speaker B: It's just like a whole bunch of things you don't do. Yeah, just hold. How about that? Just hold. Rather than going margin, rather than playing in kind of the shitcoin casino, rather than aping into you the latest NFT, right. You just hold for the long term and you would have been fine through this as long as you can bear like these kind of 70% to 80% downs from all time high. But there is a silver lining here and that is DFI is rising. Look at this.
00:09:02.874 - 00:09:25.774, Speaker B: This is the decentralized exchange user growth across all chains. And this starts in January of 2020 over two years. Look at this. The number of Dex traders over time on Ethereum, we're above 5 million now. We're closing in on 7 million. And that was basically nothing two years ago on Ethereum. And we're also seeing this on Polygon.
00:09:25.774 - 00:09:39.550, Speaker B: Okay. We have almost the same amount of total decentralized exchange traders on Polygon now. Binance smart chain Solana as well. Up optimism, massively up. And of course, this is a layer too.
00:09:39.640 - 00:09:45.270, Speaker A: So we're seeing some optimism currently is accelerating more than any of those previous charts.
00:09:45.690 - 00:09:54.042, Speaker B: It really is. And let's talk about that a little bit more, David. This is a stat from layer two Beat, which tracks the progress of layer twos. What are we looking at?
00:09:54.096 - 00:10:16.626, Speaker A: Yeah, specifically this framing that they use, scaling factor. So in this graphic that we're looking at in the last 60 days, the scaling factor of layer twos was 2.4 x, as in 2.4 times the amount of Ethereum. Layer one transactions happened on layer two. I really like this new metric scaling factor. I think that's going to be a metric that sticks around.
00:10:16.808 - 00:10:32.230, Speaker B: Okay. And so basically 2.4 x, it says over the past 60 days there was 2.4 more transactions in the Ethereum ecosystem thanks to layer twos. So that is basically doubling the scalability of Ethereum, right?
00:10:32.300 - 00:10:40.906, Speaker A: Yeah. So 63 million transactions happened on the ETH layer one and 88 million transactions happened on layer twos. Cool.
00:10:41.088 - 00:11:00.922, Speaker B: Yeah, very cool. Here's another stat for you too, David. On layer twos. Layer twos have actually flipped the Ethereum base layer in terms of aggregate transactions per second. And you can see that in the chart. Layer twos are in the green here and ever since October they've been above Ethereum in terms of transaction activity. Pretty impressive.
00:11:00.986 - 00:11:16.198, Speaker A: Yeah. I expect this to only continue into 2023. The Lappening also can apply here as well. When can we get to ten x Ethereum layer one transactional activity? Probably sometime in 2023, I bet.
00:11:16.364 - 00:11:42.806, Speaker B: I definitely think that's coming. And let's talk about some of the old DFI coins as well. MakerDAO recently experienced an increase in revenues, and that's interesting. Imagine a DFI protocol generating revenue. MakerDAO has done this fairly consistently, especially in thanks to Real world assets. WRA is the acronym for that. The real world asset category is expanding pretty quickly in Maker.
00:11:42.806 - 00:11:44.246, Speaker B: What are we looking at here. David yeah.
00:11:44.288 - 00:12:26.502, Speaker A: So this is a chart that shows the distribution of types of assets inside of Maker Dow. And that blue section in the top right corner is the real world asset section, which is now over 50% of all types of assets inside of Maker Dow. And if you click that chart right there, you can see how much money that they are making. Speaking of charts that are going up and to the right, this chart was basically nothing in January and April of this year and is now over $600 million of revenue from real world assets going into the maker Dow Treasury. And this is a landscape that no other DFI app is going after. And some people don't like it because it's centralization risk. It's real world risk.
00:12:26.502 - 00:12:47.294, Speaker A: That's a fair take, fine. But also, just like, think about being able to charge interest rates on the world. No other DFI app has that in their sites other than MakerDAO. And they're actually executing on this $600 million in revenue a year going into MakerDAO by charging real companies real money. I think that's bullish.
00:12:47.422 - 00:12:59.750, Speaker B: And these real world assets are things like treasury bonds, zero to one year maturity, one to three year maturity. So these are traditional legacy assets that are being put into these DeFi protocols.
00:13:00.490 - 00:13:03.782, Speaker A: There's also real estate in there as well, but much less than that.
00:13:03.836 - 00:13:39.986, Speaker B: Real estate tokenized real estate. David who would have thought? Let's talk about what you're doing during the bear market. I was thinking about this as we're preparing the roll up for today, what to do during a bear market. I came up with four answers to this and I want to get your take on this. David number one, I think what do you do during the bear market? Invest in yourself and acquire skills. This could not be more important. This is a fantastic way and time to build marketable talent, things, skills that you can sell to crypto companies.
00:13:39.986 - 00:14:06.982, Speaker B: That's number one. Number two, start a side hustle in crypto. So if you're not fully employed in crypto, then it's your full time hustle. But if you're not, this is a great time to begin experimenting. I mean, join various Dows, for instance, start a side hustle. Bankless started as a side hustle for both of us, didn't it? David so even if you have some sort of opportunity role in crypto, you could still engage in side hustle. It's a very side hustle friendly environment.
00:14:06.982 - 00:14:32.900, Speaker B: Number three dollar cost average into the gems, not financial advice. Of course. My take is 70% ETH, that's what I'm doing. And then 30% other dollar cost averaging in during the bear market is another thing to do. And number four, build your network and meet as many people as you can. It's a fantastic time to meet more settlers like yourself, more builders. This is the best time.
00:14:32.900 - 00:15:11.306, Speaker B: All of the people who are here for kind of the short term gains, they're gone. They're out of the space, mostly. And so there's a lot of signal in the space now and a lot of quality people. And this is a time to begin building relationships. Build out your network, get on zoom calls with people, get in people's DMs, provide some value to them, write articles, publish posts, contribute in some way to the ecosystem and build those relationships. So these are my ideas for a bear market. What's your take on this, David? And I'm curious what gems you're buying.
00:15:11.306 - 00:15:13.790, Speaker B: Are you dollar cost averaging in yet? And what are you looking at?
00:15:13.860 - 00:15:26.274, Speaker A: Oh, I'm always dollar cost averaging in that button never turns off. For sure. I'm looking at these one through four. I'm just like being taken back to the 2018 to 2020 bear market because this is exactly what I did.
00:15:26.312 - 00:15:26.850, Speaker B: What you did?
00:15:26.920 - 00:15:27.550, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:27.720 - 00:15:29.542, Speaker B: I was kind of thinking about you during this.
00:15:29.596 - 00:15:56.880, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Got out of physical therapy and into consulting inside of the crypto space. So that was my number one. Starting a side hustle was my first podcast before starting the Bankless podcast, which was also developing skills for the Bankless podcast, of course, was buying dollar cost averaging. I was definitely doing you could also call it dumping a paycheck every single two weeks. Same, same. And then number four.
00:15:56.880 - 00:16:35.430, Speaker A: Number four is where one through three get expressed. So make yourself better, acquire skills, start a side hustle that you can talk to people about, get skin in the game, but then go out and meet people. Because like Ryan said, when you meet people in the bear market, it hits different than a bull market. Because if you meet people during a bull market, sometimes I'm like, are you going to be here in two years? I'm not sure I'm going to expend my time engaging with you when I don't know you're going to be here in two years. When you meet people in a bear market, you don't have that query. Everyone understands, like, oh, we are in it, we are here together. And so it's just easier to build a network in that context.
00:16:35.590 - 00:17:21.078, Speaker B: Honestly, I think all four of these could be its own separate post or podcast that we talk about. But could you talk about number four for a minute? Because I consider you very good at this, building a network and meeting as many people as you can. So what does this mean in crypto? Like networking, right? Does this mean you're going to crypto conferences and handing out your business card? Okay, it's not that. So how do you actually meet people and how do you find the right people to meet? Because there's definitely an 80 20 role with respect to people. You want to find the 20% that would deliver 80% of the value, including your network, and get in a relationship. So how do you even screen those people? How do you find them. What's your method?
00:17:21.254 - 00:17:55.730, Speaker A: It's a little bit about are you seeing the same people on a reoccurring basis? And this works both inside of conferences in real life, but also Twitter too. You can build a network on Twitter is what it is for. And so if you are showing up on Twitter and providing value on Twitter, you will just naturally grow followers and then you'll also start to become first in Twitter. You'll see other people engaging in your tweets and you can grow a network on Twitter. And this is when Ryan said don't be afraid to slip into someone's DMs. Grow a relationship that way. And Twitter is just like the precursor to in real life conferences, by the way.
00:17:55.730 - 00:18:17.670, Speaker A: And so when you are tweeting and stuff and you are engaging with people and others, you will see many of those people at conferences. And then when you go to your second conference or your third conference or just meetups in general, you'll start to see the same reoccurring cast of characters and you have to be social and you have to be able to go up and say hi, you're going to go into our Twitter DMs?
00:18:17.750 - 00:18:23.654, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm going into our Twitter DMs and scrolling up and to actually track this. When did we first start talking?
00:18:23.792 - 00:18:35.758, Speaker A: Wow, my first DM to you in December 1, 2018. I said to you, I do not understand the resistance to ethereum on behalf of so many bitcoiners. It is utterly confusing to me. Wow, we have not changed at all.
00:18:35.924 - 00:18:44.482, Speaker B: That was the first DM you sent me. And then I said I've been trying to figure this out as well. At the core, the value systems appear so similar.
00:18:44.616 - 00:18:47.422, Speaker A: Wow, we have not changed to whatsoever.
00:18:47.486 - 00:19:11.994, Speaker B: Yeah, and then back and forth. Maximalism is lining. This is the beginning of a conversation we had know, David just got in my DMs and I was reading some of his work that he was posting on Medium. And then from there it took a while, it took many months for us to start working together on the newsletter and then eventually starting a podcast. But that's where we started in the depths of the bear market in 2018.
00:19:12.122 - 00:19:51.930, Speaker A: Wow, 2018, what a throwback. Anyways, just something to consider is optimizing for luck surface area, which means putting yourself out there, putting value out there. Like when you are investing in yourself and acquiring skills, make sure you find a way to broadcast those skills so you can let people know that you're a useful person. And then just start growing the relationships in ways that create serendipity. And that can be true on Twitter, that can be true on substac, that can be true in real life events. That just casual meetups. But I would emphasize that in real life, meetups do provide value that you kind of can't get in the metaverse because it's like meeting humans meet face to face.
00:19:51.930 - 00:19:54.620, Speaker A: Ryan, I feel so attacked right now.
00:19:56.030 - 00:20:26.562, Speaker B: Well, let's talk about some of the gems piece of of course, you know, everyone listening knows we are bullish ETH and you'll find that out even more when our episode on Monday comes out. There are some other gems in this market too. Ryan Selkis was recently on the bankless podcast he called a bottom for DeFi. I think there are some really interesting DeFi tokens out there. Again, not financial advice, but that's something that I'm looking at also even in the public markets. David, this is a tweet from Matt hogan about coinbase. What's he saying here?
00:20:26.616 - 00:20:58.830, Speaker A: Yeah, so he tweets out saying coinbase raised money in 2018 at an $8 billion valuation. It is currently trading at a $9 billion valuation. Meanwhile, revenues are up in that same time frame from 520,000,000 to 3.3 billion. Users are up from 22 million to 101,000,000 and assets on the platform are up from 11 billion to 101,000,000,000. So same valuation going back four and a half years. But meanwhile all the metrics are up about a five x, five to six x, sometimes a ten x on assets on the platform.
00:20:58.830 - 00:21:15.860, Speaker A: So the coinbase stock hit a low of $35 when it opened up at something like $450. Coinbase stock is going to be one of the most generational buys of all time. It's got to be not financial buy. I don't own any because I don't own in stocks, but whatever.
00:21:16.230 - 00:21:37.674, Speaker B: Yeah, these numbers are pretty compelling to be honest. My only question whenever I have some money to dollar cost average in is, okay, should I do this or should I go buy some more? Right? That's kind of the question. They're certainly correlated anyway. There you go guys. A lot of things you can do during the bear market to keep busy. David, what do we have coming up next?
00:21:37.792 - 00:21:56.302, Speaker A: SBF coming home extradited to the US. Prison wasn't so great for him, so he wanted know work his way home. Brian Armstrong makes regulation proposals that we wish that we had. And also visa steps into the ethereum frontier. What does that mean? All of this and more right after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors to help you go bankless.
00:21:56.366 - 00:22:32.262, Speaker C: The reality today is that five corporations control the entire world of social media. They own our names, they restrict our content, they monitor our every move. And their time is up. Thanks to our sponsor, DSO.

00:23:41.774 - 00:23:59.850, Speaker B: IO SBF back in the USA. Maybe not of his own will. I'm not sure there's an extradition here, but it sounds like the prison system in Bahamas left something to be desired. We'll talk about that. Just, I guess, getting into this again. Jake Trevinsky had a fantastic summary. He tweeted this out.
00:23:59.850 - 00:24:34.722, Speaker B: Two months ago, SBF was debating the future of crypto policy, and nobody knew FDX was a sham. One month ago, SBF was apologizing for losing billions, and everyone worried for losing billions and everyone worried he might get away with fraud. Today, SBF is in FBI custody and his chief co conspirators have pleaded guilty. It's amazing how fast all this has unfolded. Jake says it's very rare to see criminal prosecutions move so quickly. That's the high level context. Look how fast all of that happened.
00:24:34.722 - 00:24:50.886, Speaker B: Two months ago, SBF was on this podcast debating crypto policy, and now he's in jail and in FBI custody. So I don't know if this bodes well for other previous bankless guests.
00:24:50.918 - 00:24:58.170, Speaker A: Other guests? Please don't take that too seriously. Yeah, customer deposits. It's fine.
00:24:58.240 - 00:25:14.906, Speaker B: Look, it's honestly not that hard to do well in crypto, but just by playing long term games. But SBF was clearly not playing that. So give us the stories. It sounds like SBF was having a bad time in jail in the Bahamas. What were the conditions like and what might have led to his extradition to the US?
00:25:15.028 - 00:25:43.210, Speaker A: So the conditions of the Bahamian jail are not great. There are, like, buckets, for example, that are required for all inmates. You can guess what those get used for. This report says cells were infested with rats, maggots, and insects. I'm just going to go ahead and guess that. It was a miserable place to be. And so it made it really easy for SBF to just wave the white flag and say, fine, just extradite me to the United States.
00:25:43.210 - 00:25:54.286, Speaker A: If that's how it happened. That kind of makes sense. I don't really know if that's how that happened, but that's what people are speculating as to how bad the Bahamian prison was. Just like, SBF was like, fine, extradite me. Yeah.
00:25:54.308 - 00:25:55.950, Speaker B: He's like, I don't want to spend Christmas here.
00:25:56.020 - 00:26:25.190, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Send me home to mom and dad. So now he is in New York City. So that was last night at the time of recording. So Wednesday night, Thursday morning, he was flown from the Bahamas to New York City in custody of the FBI, and that is where he currently resides. So SBF, wow, looking unshaven and unkempt and definitely pretty sweaty being escorted off a plane or excuse me, that is a photo of him being escorted onto a plane in the Bahamas.
00:26:26.170 - 00:26:30.074, Speaker B: Definitely a different climate. He's entering in New York City this time of year.
00:26:30.112 - 00:26:42.874, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. He's probably cold. Interesting is that Alameda's Caroline Ellison and FTX's Gary Wang have pled guilty to the Department of justice fraud charges and also have settled with the SEC and CFTC.
00:26:43.002 - 00:26:44.510, Speaker B: They've already settled.
00:26:45.810 - 00:27:08.150, Speaker A: Either that or looking to settle. Yeah. So they have been talking, the SEC and also CFTC has charged Ellison with market manipulation of the price of FTT. No surprises there. But it looks like that they are moving faster than SBF is when it comes to going down. The prisoner's dilemma rabbit.
00:27:10.730 - 00:27:25.466, Speaker B: You know, you have to wonder what those private conversations were like. But I bet it was a lot of full cooperation. And I'm happy to rat SBF out and I have no loyalty to him. I bet it was some of that. Maybe that's why this case is moving so fast.
00:27:25.568 - 00:27:57.614, Speaker A: Yeah, perhaps. Yeah. What's also interesting is that now that this asset recovery program has started, they're actually starting to find money. So a new headline out of Defiant says, FTX finds $1 billion inside of hundreds of company bank accounts with no less than $720,000,000 of cash. So it's not like illiquid FTT tokens. They found $720,000,000 of cash in just hundreds in hundreds of bank accounts.
00:27:57.662 - 00:27:59.410, Speaker B: Hundreds of bank accounts.
00:27:59.990 - 00:28:07.766, Speaker A: This kind of feels like with me and my multiple times I got the uniswap AirDrop because I was too chaotic to own my own ethereum addresses. So I just had like 20 of them.
00:28:07.788 - 00:28:08.306, Speaker B: Couch cushions.
00:28:08.338 - 00:28:10.360, Speaker A: Yeah, the couch cushion. But I didn't shout out.
00:28:12.970 - 00:28:39.442, Speaker B: Yeah, if I could help with this, guys, these were all D five wallets. Okay, but so they're just like searching the couch cushions, basically. But you know what's impressive? Hundreds of company bank accounts. And have you ever seen those pictures of the structure of this FTX empire in Alameda and all of the companies and subcompanies and joint ownership things? It's an absolute mess.
00:28:39.496 - 00:28:40.754, Speaker A: It looks like a board.
00:28:40.872 - 00:28:52.022, Speaker B: I'm almost blown away by the complexity of this and how he was able to accomplish this yet. That's almost know FTX has only been around. For what, like, four years, something like this?
00:28:52.076 - 00:28:52.918, Speaker A: Yeah, less.
00:28:53.084 - 00:29:00.074, Speaker B: It's like starting a new bank account. Like, every couple of days, every two to three days, you're starting a new bank account, form a new company.
00:29:00.192 - 00:29:03.850, Speaker A: That's got to be somebody's job. Like, how do you even do all of this?
00:29:04.000 - 00:29:07.450, Speaker B: It's impressive at that level. From a scam perspective.
00:29:08.190 - 00:29:55.402, Speaker A: From a scam perspective. Anyways, in addition to just finding their own money, they have also engaged in clawbacks. And so article out of the Guardian says, FTX intends to commence actions before the bankruptcy court to require the returns of such payments. Political donations with interest accruing from the date any action is commenced. Sharing an email address ftxrepay at FTX us that recipients could use to voluntarily return money. Recipients are cautioned that making a payment or donation to a third party, including a charity, in the amount of any payment received from an FTX contributor, does not prevent FTX debtors from seeking recovery from the recipient or of any subsequent transferee. They added in a statement, basically saying, hey, we're coming for you.
00:29:55.402 - 00:29:58.134, Speaker A: Hold on to that money, because that's ours.
00:29:58.182 - 00:30:10.846, Speaker B: Don't spend it. Don't politicians, the politicians, the celebrities, the charities. This means, I guess, Kevin O'Leary will have to give back his $15 million. Do you think this means the actually keeps it?
00:30:10.948 - 00:30:15.280, Speaker A: Because that was actually a payment to him. You think that's different? I don't know.
00:30:15.730 - 00:30:18.650, Speaker B: Actually, I'd be interested in donations, I think.
00:30:18.740 - 00:30:24.290, Speaker A: So they signed a contract with Kevin O'Leary, I'm assuming, but he should get back anyways.
00:30:25.270 - 00:30:35.894, Speaker B: He definitely should. I kind of wonder about Kobe and Ledger at up. Only if they'll be subject to this clawback, too. Yeah, it's not a ton of money.
00:30:36.012 - 00:30:39.960, Speaker A: No, because it's a contract that they signed with them for services.
00:30:40.970 - 00:30:42.550, Speaker B: And they render the services.
00:30:42.700 - 00:30:45.482, Speaker A: Yeah. And they perform the services. I don't know.
00:30:45.536 - 00:30:46.506, Speaker B: I don't know either.
00:30:46.608 - 00:30:48.794, Speaker A: Yeah. What constitutes a clawback look?
00:30:48.832 - 00:30:59.786, Speaker B: Definitely, if you're Kevin O'Leary, you should give the 15. If you're a politician, you should definitely give the money back to you. It's a really bad look to just keep that money and spend it on campaign finance.
00:30:59.898 - 00:31:04.750, Speaker A: The headline of this is, FTX seeks to claw back donations to politicians and charities.
00:31:06.690 - 00:31:21.042, Speaker B: I feel like I have closure on SBF at the end of 2022. If he wasn't in jail, if there wasn't prosecution ongoing, I would have felt like we were wounded in 2022. And the wound is still open, it's still raw, but now it feels like starting to scab open. Heal.
00:31:21.106 - 00:31:22.034, Speaker A: Yeah, we can heal.
00:31:22.082 - 00:31:25.634, Speaker B: And that feels really good. Going into 2023, it was nice hearing.
00:31:25.682 - 00:31:37.734, Speaker A: Jake Shavinsky say, wow, it's surprising how fast this went, because in the middle of it, it was like, Why isn't he in jail yet? It did not feel fast. He's getting away. We're watching him get away with it. Oh, he's in jail.
00:31:37.782 - 00:31:38.214, Speaker B: Just kidding.
00:31:38.262 - 00:31:38.860, Speaker A: Thanks.
00:31:41.870 - 00:32:15.954, Speaker B: All right, well, in the meanwhile, Brian Armstrong was actually putting together a regulatory proposal. And his post about this, this kind of reminded me of the antithesis of SDFs, the inverse post on regulatory that happened like two weeks ago, or sorry, two months ago, I guess. And this is a post from Brian Armstrong. I tweeted this out less than 60 days ago. I read SBF's crypto regulatory proposal. It was hot garbage, and it turned out so was FTX. The proposal we saw from Brian Armstrong was much more practical and sane.
00:32:15.954 - 00:32:30.742, Speaker B: Here's the full post on Coinbase. What's the TLDR of this? What is Armstrong saying? The title of this post is Regulating Crypto. How do we move forward as an industry from here? What is he saying about how we move forward? David?
00:32:30.806 - 00:33:05.174, Speaker A: Yeah, there are three pillars that he puts into this proposal. One is create regulatory clarity for centralized actors. No surprise there. He names three further centralized actors that he wants clarity for stablecoins exchanges and custodians and commodities and securities. So making it more clear as to who can issue a stablecoin and how that can be structured. He even gets a little tidbit as to like, if you're a bank, you can issue a stablecoin and do fractional reserve if you are going to be compliant in all the banking licenses, exchanges and custodians. Of course, need more regulation there.
00:33:05.174 - 00:33:41.934, Speaker A: And then also commodities and securities just need clarity on what's a commodity, what is a security, things we've been asking for forever. And so that's the first pillar. Second pillar is enforce a level playing field. This is definitely a tip of the hat to how onshore United States exchanges felt super hamstrung to just the amazing set of products that FTX was able to produce because they were not onshore. And so in order to be competitive, our American exchange, and also keep American US money onshore, we need our exchanges to be competitive. So that's number two, enforce a level playing field. And three, let innovation happen in decentralized crypto.
00:33:41.934 - 00:34:08.202, Speaker A: Brian Armstrong always keeping DeFi in mind and saying, like, hey, the whole point of crypto is to be decentralized and do decentralized stuff. So let that thing grow and regulate decentralized actors like Coinbase appropriately. These are three fantastic pillars. It was so refreshing to read this thing. It's like, oh, this makes just so much rational, logical, sense. We don't even have to overthink this. Thank you, Brian, for posting this.
00:34:08.336 - 00:35:09.498, Speaker B: Yeah, and I mean, part of this was in the Dccpa, right? Definitely part of kind of the exchange regulation. There wasn't as much on stablecoins, but there was in the Dccpa, the legislation of which SBF was a proponent. Some language about securities versus commodities and some clarity there. There was a little something, I don't know if it went as far enough, but the difference is with the Dccpa is basically treated all of DeFi as if it was a centralized exchange and required similar levels of compliance and registration. Even down to kind of like the front ends. Absolutely terrible piece of legislation that SBF seemed like he was crafting in order to pull up the ladder on all of the innovation that would come after him and install protections for FTX. Now this is not what Coinbase is saying at all, not what Brian is saying at you know, I think he means definitely, I hope he means it, but this at least is sensible, right? Let's kick the can down the road for DeFi.
00:35:09.498 - 00:35:53.120, Speaker B: It doesn't need this level of regulation at this point in time. The easy wins clearly here in the US from a regulatory perspective are stablecoins. Let's do the thing where we get a bitcoin ETF, and it's actually a bitcoin ETF. Let's finally hear with complete clarity from our regulators and lawmakers that ETH is not a security. Can we just do that? I mean, these are the easy, low hanging fruit stuff where you can kind of institute this and allow DeFi to continue to flourish in the US. So seems like a no brainer to me. It's of course not the perspective of all lawmakers here, but yeah, this is a refreshing take on things.
00:35:53.570 - 00:36:05.470, Speaker A: I think certain status lawmakers are going to look at this thing and it's like, but how do we surveil people and stuff like that, and stuff that's like not going to be able to come to terms with exactly.
00:36:05.620 - 00:36:12.898, Speaker B: And that's where I'm happy to fight the battles. But this meme of like, oh, people in crypto don't want any, we just, we don't want dumb regulation, we don't.
00:36:12.904 - 00:36:16.034, Speaker A: Want your regulation, we don't want yes.
00:36:16.232 - 00:36:28.426, Speaker B: If you're going to make regulation mean ban DeFi effectively, then like, no, that's dumb, don't do that. David there's some cool stuff going on at Visa, though. Stepping to the frontier. What's this about?
00:36:28.528 - 00:37:33.918, Speaker A: Yeah, so global payment giant Visa signaled stronger, sustained interest in crypto, releasing a paper outlining how the firm could one day collaborate with the Ethereum network on automatic payments. And so they released a document, a research document of sorts, talking about account abstraction, which is a 400 level Ethereum topic, crypto topic, and how account abstraction wallet could enable Visa to set up automatic payments for monthly bills. So inside of this article, here's a quote. Many of us rely on automatic payments to pay monthly bills. In a few simple steps, we can set up reoccurring payments with a local utility or subscription provider with blockchain technology, potentially representing a new way to process payments in a distributed and programmable fashion. Could this everyday payment experience be replicated or even improved on the blockchain with the punchline? Visa is exploring exactly that. And so this is a technical piece where Visa outlines how to write a smart contract app for a self custodial wallet, where that wallet is maintained exclusively by the user and the user has the private key.
00:37:33.918 - 00:38:00.840, Speaker A: And the application allows a user to set up a programmable payment instructions to push funds from their self custodial wallet to another wallet at reoccurring intervals without using the user's participation at each time. Basically an automation of what a lot of just commerce is. But Visa is exploring how to do this with self custody account abstracted wallets on Ethereum. And they are researching, they are pushing the frontier here. So this is super cool.
00:38:01.210 - 00:38:57.650, Speaker B: Self custody reoccurring payments is a fantastic use case and bypasses the banks completely. How cool is that? You know what else is cool, David, is this is actually a hackathon project that they've implemented. And account abstraction is not yet available on Ethereum and the main net, but it is available right now in Starkware, in the StarkNet ecosystem. And so they actually built this fully out on StarkNet, using Argent as the wallet. This is another example, I think, of like the Ethereum mainnet will be sort of more conservative for a while. And some of the innovation, like we already have account abstraction in StarkNet, some of that will start to happen in layer twos is incredibly bullish in terms of how we push this industry forward using sort of layer twos as our frontier for innovation and technology. And they could deploy this kind of thing on layer two, even absent the Ethereum main net supporting account abstraction.
00:38:57.650 - 00:38:58.710, Speaker B: Super cool, man.
00:38:58.780 - 00:39:09.878, Speaker A: Yeah. Great stuff. Great stuff. All right, coming up next, the metrics behind the Trump NFT drop. I know you all wanted to hear exactly how many newbies bought Trump NFTs.
00:39:09.974 - 00:39:12.110, Speaker B: We were here for your Trump impression, David.
00:39:12.450 - 00:39:22.110, Speaker A: I got none more of that. So, Ryan, what do you think? More than 50% new buyers, or more than 50% of them are NFT speculators?
00:39:22.690 - 00:39:27.502, Speaker B: I'm going to go with new buyers. More than 50%. I think this reached an entirely new audience.
00:39:27.566 - 00:39:28.786, Speaker A: All right, I was not held by.
00:39:28.808 - 00:39:30.740, Speaker B: It, but I think others would be.
00:39:31.190 - 00:39:51.230, Speaker A: The other things as well. Ren protocol is in trouble. Ren the bridge that puts assets on one chain across to another chain. We'll talk about that. And also finance bailout. Not a bailout for Binance, but Binance bailing somebody out who is getting bailed out by finance. All of this and more right after we talked to some fantastic sponsors to help you go bankless.
00:39:51.410 - 00:40:45.562, Speaker C: Sequence is the all in one developer platform you need to build web three games and applications for your users. Sequence is a smart wallet, and it's the easiest, most intuitive onboarding your users will ever experience and comes with all the features users need to feel empowered in the Web Three world MultiChain support NFT Display, and users can buy SFTS, NFTs and crypto directly with a credit or debit card. For developers, Sequence is the plug and play platform for web three games and apps. Their APIs let you bring NFTs, SFTS and tokens into your game or application, and a Sequence relayer enables gasless transactions for your users. Sequence already powers some of the best web three games like SkyWeaver, NFT projects like CoolCats and Marketplaces like Nifty Swap. And Sequence is compatible with all the EVM chains, including Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart chain, Arbitrum, Optimism and Avalanche. So go to Sequence XYZ Bankless to start building or speak with the Sequence team today.
00:40:45.562 - 00:41:22.754, Speaker C: If you've been listening to Bankless, you know that we're fans of the modular Blockchain thesis. The idea that Blockchains will separate execution from data availability and consensus, allowing all three to become the best versions of themselves. And Fuel has built the fastest modular execution layer in the industry. By supporting parallel transaction execution. Fuel unlocks significantly faster throughput for the web three world. Fuel also goes beyond the limitations of the EVM with its own Fuel VM, which is more efficient and optimized, opening up the design space for developers. And lastly, Fuel brings a powerful developer experience with its own domain specific language, Sway and a supportive tool chain called Fork.
00:41:22.754 - 00:41:34.118, Speaker C: With Fuel, you can have the benefits of smart contract languages like Validity while adopting the improvements made by the Rust tooling ecosystem, letting the Fuel development environment go beyond the limitations of the EVM. If you want to learn more, there's.
00:41:34.134 - 00:41:35.098, Speaker A: A link in the show notes to.
00:41:35.104 - 00:41:37.430, Speaker C: See how you can get involved with the Fuel network.
00:41:37.590 - 00:41:58.980, Speaker A: It was recently announced that MoonPay, the onramp, is now integrated directly into the Uniswap front end. So you can now buy tokens on Uniswap directly through Uniswap using MoonPay. That's got to be one of the fastest on ramps into Ethereum that I can think of. Direct to uniswap straight into the shitcoins, you know.
00:41:59.670 - 00:42:24.758, Speaker B: Well, you don't have to, that's a choice. Look, there is great personal responsibility when it comes to crypto because you can literally buy anything on Uniswap and it's completely up to you. But this is really cool. This is a screenshot of how it looks and you can see this is fully integrated into the Uniswap app where you could just buy crypto directly from uniswap. So stay the step in the process and not have to transfer through an exchange.
00:42:24.854 - 00:42:27.180, Speaker A: I wonder if we're ever going to see PayPal there.
00:42:27.950 - 00:42:57.262, Speaker B: I would imagine so. I mean, there's going to be all sorts of different onramps are a big deal, like a big freaking deal. And it's cool to see some of these larger companies getting in the game there. But David, what's going on with Ren protocol? First of all, what is Ren protocol? Because it's been a while since I've heard that name, actually. And last I recall it was like some sort of a cross chain asset bridge of some sort. So if I wanted my ETH on well, if I wanted my bitcoin on ETH, I could use Ren in order to get there somehow.
00:42:57.406 - 00:43:16.534, Speaker A: Yeah, that's exactly right. Yeah. So Ren BTC is a token that you could buy on Uniswap. However, with this news, I wouldn't suggest it in this present moment. But it was basically this, think of this just like a mesh layer between many, many chains. A very ambitious project. It's like a mesh layer between many chains that had its own token called Ren.
00:43:16.534 - 00:43:49.794, Speaker A: And Ren was the asset that economically secured all of the cross chain transfers of assets. So it was like a bridge, but a hyper linked bridge across all the blockchains. At least that's what the vision was. It was actually bought by Alameda back in February. Shortly after being bought by Alameda started supporting Solana. Because in hindsight, now we know that we need to do everything we need to do to prop up the price of Sol because that's what Sam was using as collateral. But I digress anyway, now that Alameda bought Ren and then is now defunct, there's no more funding for Ren.
00:43:49.794 - 00:44:29.234, Speaker A: And so according to this article, alameda was contributing $700,000 per quarter to keep the Ren operation going. And during a community call last month, ren revealed that it only had $160,000 left in funding, only enough cash to get down to the end of the year. And so there's probably further details about what this means if you are a holder of Ren tokens. So click that link in the show notes to go dive down that rabbit hole to see what you need to do. But the Ren 1.0 network is shutting down and they are saying that compatibility between Ren 1.0 and 2.0
00:44:29.234 - 00:44:44.786, Speaker A: cannot be guaranteed. So if you are a holder of Ren 1.0 assets, you should probably do something. By something, I mean, like go back to port your Ren tokens back to their native assets. So definitely pay attention to that if you are a holder of any Ren tokens.
00:44:44.898 - 00:45:02.302, Speaker B: I've never been a huge fan of this sort of bridging, personally. Never gotten into it. I'm glad that it's there as an option, but also not glad because I think it provides a false sense of security. Because really the security of that Ren bitcoin on ETH is kind of backed by the value of Ren, the token itself.
00:45:02.436 - 00:45:06.922, Speaker A: And it was always in the security of the protocol too, which is also unknown.
00:45:07.066 - 00:45:14.838, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm not particularly bullish these types of bridging solutions, much more bullish kind of layer twos and trustless bridges.
00:45:14.954 - 00:45:39.270, Speaker A: They seem to be a very seasonal thing because I remember this being a topic of conversation during the height of the last bull market. Like during the last interoperability, it's always a meme. And it seems to be like one of these things that gets a lot of funding during the bull markets and starts to work during the bull markets and then breaks during the bear markets every single time. However, I will say that Ren actually did stick around throughout last bear market. It has been around for two cycles.
00:45:39.770 - 00:45:48.522, Speaker B: Perhaps no longer. Yeah, perhaps no longer. Let's talk about ETH Global. What's happening in 2023. Like all around the world, there's 18 different hackathons. Is that right?
00:45:48.576 - 00:45:57.822, Speaker A: Yeah. So many. So many. Yeah. So ETH Global released their big 2023 schedule. So if you are a developer who is a hackathon, attendor. Here we go.
00:45:57.822 - 00:46:15.234, Speaker A: Scaling Ethereum in March. ETH Global tokyo in April. ETH Global istanbul in May. ETH Global toronto in June, paris in July. That's right after ECC New York in September. I'll probably be there. And then ETH online in October and then ETH Global at DevCon sometime in 2024.
00:46:15.234 - 00:46:20.840, Speaker A: So if you are a hackathon at Tendor, this schedule is out. So mark your calendars for 2023.
00:46:21.370 - 00:46:26.994, Speaker B: Build market. That's what we're doing here. We're building DevCon. Has that location been announced yet, David?
00:46:27.042 - 00:46:28.326, Speaker A: No, it has not.
00:46:28.508 - 00:46:48.880, Speaker B: Okay, we'll have to see. I'm waited with bated breath. All right, let's talk about those Trump NFTs, baby Trump made. Did you know this? I don't know about your 50% question earlier, but I do know he made about 6.7 million on NFTs last week. And I also know, David, for Trump, that means he ain't leaving. He's here to stay.
00:46:49.250 - 00:46:52.640, Speaker A: Trump NFT drop in 2.0, coming very soon.
00:46:53.010 - 00:47:25.018, Speaker B: I mean, I should mention, all of that money probably didn't go directly into Trump's pocket. I'm sure this was some sort of licensing deal where some third party was doing this on his behalf. But, you know, he got a sizable cut using his likeness and the Trump brand and his face and his muscly chiseled body on some of these NFTs that had to come with a cost. So give us the stats. What is the case? Are a bunch of new NFT users in these Trump NFTs? Or are these the same old Dgens that are now like, Aping into Trump NFTs and dumping them?
00:47:25.104 - 00:47:42.894, Speaker A: Yeah. So zero X. Sydney put together a fantastic thread detailing some of these metrics. So about 15,000.8 total holders and about 65% of that, about 10,000 wallets only hold one card. So that's a pretty good distribution, I'd say. Yeah.
00:47:42.894 - 00:47:47.602, Speaker A: So let's go down to wait 1 second here.
00:47:47.656 - 00:47:55.182, Speaker B: The largest whale is the team and they have 1000 cards. I thought somebody bought a thousand. The second largest holder has 329 cards.
00:47:55.326 - 00:47:58.806, Speaker A: All purchased from the secondary market. They didn't even mint it.
00:47:58.908 - 00:47:59.560, Speaker B: Wow.
00:48:01.450 - 00:48:10.614, Speaker A: The particular person who bought 329 cars on the secondary has transactions in their wallet that goes back to 500 days ago, both on Polygon and on Ethereum.
00:48:10.662 - 00:48:14.300, Speaker B: So this it was Donald Trump Jr. He bought those.
00:48:15.070 - 00:48:28.080, Speaker A: The person that paid the for the highest sale was a whopping 37 ETH. And they owned 24 Trump cards, all purchased from secondaries. Wow. Paid a total of 72 ETH across the entire collection. Wow.
00:48:28.450 - 00:48:29.934, Speaker B: $84,000.
00:48:30.052 - 00:48:31.262, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay.
00:48:31.316 - 00:48:32.560, Speaker B: They're doing okay.
00:48:33.970 - 00:48:57.494, Speaker A: About 9.7 thousand holders do not hold any Maddox or Ether, which means that they are likely a first time NFT purchaser that probably paid with a credit card. So that is our assumption of these are all first time crypto users. 9.7 thousand people bought one Trump card and they don't have any ETH or matic in their wallet. Means they don't have any gas to pay to transfer those things. So if you do the math, 9.7
00:48:57.494 - 00:49:09.340, Speaker A: are crypto, noobs, 12.8 total minted the collection. That brings us to a whopping 76% of new crypto users because of the Trump NFT. Wow.
00:49:10.290 - 00:49:17.406, Speaker B: Okay, so what do we do here? More private keys in more hands is net good thing, right? More NFD use.
00:49:17.508 - 00:49:18.734, Speaker A: That's what we say.
00:49:18.852 - 00:49:19.840, Speaker B: Net good.
00:49:20.770 - 00:49:22.438, Speaker A: We got people onboarded.
00:49:22.554 - 00:49:30.258, Speaker B: Onboarding people to crypto. Look at the floor price of these things right now. It's 00:23 at the time of record.
00:49:30.344 - 00:49:34.130, Speaker A: 23 for 45,000 units.
00:49:35.510 - 00:49:39.062, Speaker B: Is that really true? 45,000 items? Yes. Yeah.
00:49:39.116 - 00:49:45.350, Speaker A: At zero point 23, almost a quarter of an ETH. What the absolute f dude, that is insane.
00:49:45.930 - 00:49:50.600, Speaker B: I don't think I've paid much attention to these things. It's basically pictures of Trump.
00:49:51.210 - 00:49:56.602, Speaker A: $276 for a floor NFT, and the minimum price was $100.
00:49:56.736 - 00:50:00.522, Speaker B: It does not appear to me like a lot of time went into these things. It's just Trump.
00:50:00.656 - 00:50:08.800, Speaker A: No, this is one background picture of Trump with different things, photoshopped on him. There is only one photo of Trump.
00:50:09.170 - 00:50:11.482, Speaker B: The entire collection is just one Trump photo.
00:50:11.546 - 00:50:19.326, Speaker A: It's just one Trump photo. And then he has different backgrounds, different suits, different bodies, different hats, but it's just one Trump photo.
00:50:19.438 - 00:50:26.190, Speaker B: Look, I am not an NFT aficionado, but might call this a low effort NFT.
00:50:26.270 - 00:50:29.880, Speaker A: David, I don't know your they made 45,000 of them.
00:50:30.410 - 00:50:35.942, Speaker B: That's a lot of quantity. I don't know about the quality, though. Teach their own, though.
00:50:35.996 - 00:50:38.614, Speaker A: One stance, one photo of Trump. Wow.
00:50:38.652 - 00:50:49.386, Speaker B: Just a JPEG. You buy in the JPEG. I hope everyone knows. And I guess getting onboarded into the polygon network as a result. I wonder how many of those users actually learned how to use MetaMask through.
00:50:49.408 - 00:51:25.366, Speaker A: This for it must have been a lot. Oh, this was funny. Did you see this Tweet thread? So this was a Tweet thread because there was one photo, right? So, like, where did they get all of the bodies? And so apparently these are all like shutterstock images that they just pulled off the shutterstock image and then slapped it onto Trump's and edited it for a little bit. And there's so many examples of these, of where they got the tuxedo for Trump and then they just slapped it on there. It's just the most on brand thing I can think of for Trump. Just like one Trump photo. Like 10,000 shutter stock stock images just slapped on there.
00:51:25.366 - 00:51:30.374, Speaker A: And for a photo crush, they look pretty good. And also crushing it.
00:51:30.412 - 00:51:43.660, Speaker B: Yeah, also crushing it in terms of volume and sales. Pretty amazing there. All right, Trump is here. So is reddit. Of course, reddit. They just launched another free NFT collection. They've been crushing it toward the end of this year.
00:51:43.660 - 00:51:58.978, Speaker B: Five days ago, it's called the Recap 2022. This was free, but already. David has 1.3 million owners. They call these not NFTs in the reddit ecosystem, they call them digital collectibles. And the community is definitely collecting them. 1.3
00:51:58.978 - 00:52:04.306, Speaker B: million owners of this thing. This is all happening behind the scenes. I think that's pretty amazing as well. Yeah.
00:52:04.328 - 00:52:13.030, Speaker A: And mainly, I would say the majority of these people don't know that they're NFTs because there's no trading volume on these things. They're not getting transferred around.
00:52:13.180 - 00:52:25.274, Speaker B: Right. Here is a graph from Hildabi. And this is maybe a sobering graph of some of the NFT market from 2022. What are we looking at here? Yeah.
00:52:25.312 - 00:52:46.814, Speaker A: So this is Wash trading on Ethereum. Ethereum NFT Wash Trading Volume. And there was basically zero wash trading up until about, I think the start of this year, maybe like January of 2022. And you said sobering, but also Ryan, remember, this is when Looks Rare launched. And looks rare. Incentivized incentive.
00:52:46.862 - 00:52:47.406, Speaker B: Wash Trading.
00:52:47.438 - 00:52:50.606, Speaker A: Basically trading in General which created Wash Trading.
00:52:50.638 - 00:52:53.698, Speaker B: And what is Wash Trading for people who don't have a crisp definition of.
00:52:53.704 - 00:53:05.346, Speaker A: That, it's when you buy and sell an NFT immediately. And so perhaps you do that from one wallet to another. You do it to a friend. You just do fake trade. It's not a real trade. You fake a trade.
00:53:05.458 - 00:53:06.342, Speaker B: Why would you do this?
00:53:06.396 - 00:53:29.390, Speaker A: Why are you trying to a whole number of reasons. For Looks Rare, it's to earn the looks tokens because you were paid for volume on Looks Rare. You can also do it to launder money. If that's your vibe, don't suggest it. You can also do it to do tax locks hovering as well. There's plenty of reasons to wash an NFT trade, some legitimate, some not legitimate.
00:53:29.810 - 00:53:39.970, Speaker B: Yeah. Anyway, this graphic is showing a lot of the volume. Does this say 44% of the volume traded in all of 2022 was Wash Traded?
00:53:40.790 - 00:53:58.194, Speaker A: Yeah, looks like it. Yeah. It was definitely concentrated in the middle of the height of the mania. It's definitely come down now. But Wash Trading is probably going to be a thing that is just I'm not going to say plagues, because, again, it's not inherently negative, but it's going to be something that's always going to be a part of the NFT industry.
00:53:58.322 - 00:54:05.626, Speaker B: I love that you can see this all on chain, though, right? And this is sort of a citizen journalist type hildavi, who's constantly coming up.
00:54:05.648 - 00:54:08.118, Speaker A: With these fantastic Dune analytics master.
00:54:08.214 - 00:54:45.398, Speaker B: Yeah, he's just crazy at this. Christie's down kind of bad from an NFT perspective, at least from those 2022 highs, their sales, christie's NFT sales fell 96% in 2022. Not unexpected, but when you look at these numbers, david Art Auction house, Christie sold 87 NFTs for a total of 5.9 million in 2022. And that was down 96% compared to 2021. So must have been hundreds of millions previously. Yeah, 150,000,000 in 2021.
00:54:45.398 - 00:54:48.466, Speaker B: So a down year for Christie's from that perspective.
00:54:48.578 - 00:55:01.798, Speaker A: Yeah. I just don't think anyone's surprised by this. And also Christie's continues to make investments and efforts into building out virtual auction houses for NFTs for moving forward. So even though they're down, I think they are still bullish.
00:55:01.894 - 00:55:25.618, Speaker B: Look, they're so psyched about the new growth opportunity that they didn't previously have. And now we have digital art. Let's talk about some more digital art that's coming. A digital collectible. This is the last in a series of five we are calling the Genesis Collection, where you can get an NFT of five of our favorite bankless podcasts. And this is the original collection. There's only going to be five of these.
00:55:25.618 - 00:55:34.258, Speaker B: The last one is getting issued tomorrow. And the last one is another one of my favorite episodes of all time. David, what are we releasing tomorrow?
00:55:34.434 - 00:56:11.620, Speaker A: The fifth of five of the Genesis Collection is, of course, none other than Vitalik Butyrin. Who kelts could it be? And we are going to tokenize episode 99, End the Game, which I think was a fantastic episode about the long term philosophy of the Ethereum Roadmap and not just the technical details, but why it is what it is. So if you want to collect the Ethereum Roadmap as a podcast with Vitalik Butyrin, that is available at Collectibles Bankless.com at noon Eastern time on Friday. Tomorrow. Well, today, if you're listening to this, tomorrow Friday. Sorry about that.
00:56:11.990 - 00:56:19.462, Speaker B: It's today. It's the 23. December 12:00 p.m eastern. You can pick that up. And the previous ones have gone fast, like the Drake one.
00:56:19.516 - 00:56:21.858, Speaker A: Three blocks. They're sold out in three blocks.
00:56:21.954 - 00:56:32.182, Speaker B: Yeah. All right, let's talk bitcoin stuff. And I guess the story around bitcoin right now is a bunch of bitcoin miners going bankrupt or on the verge of bankruptcy. What's this one, David?
00:56:32.246 - 00:57:11.074, Speaker A: Yeah, Core Scientific, which is one of the bigger bitcoin miners out there, has filed for Chapter Eleven bankruptcy protection. It's one of the largest publicly traded mining firms still generating positive cash flow, but just not enough to pay back the debts that it owes. And so when energy prices go up, which energy prices are up big right now, and also bitcoin prices go down, Ryan, that is bad for the mining industry. That is not what you want. And so, of course, Scientific estimated assets and liabilities is at between one and $10 billion. $1 billion of assets, $10 billion of liabilities, and has between one and 5000 creditors per its filing. Oof.
00:57:11.202 - 00:57:35.070, Speaker B: Well, here's the thing, David, is this always ends up leading to consolidation, doesn't it? Because who's going to buy these assets? A stronger, healthier bitcoin mining company that was able to weather this storm. They're going to end up purchasing these assets. And so the big fish get bigger and kind of the smaller, weak fish get weeded out and they die. And then you get increasing consolidation.
00:57:35.810 - 00:57:56.210, Speaker A: That's always been my take as well. That the destruction of bitcoin miners at the bottom of the bottom of the bear. Always leads to consolidation. When I gave that take to Bitcoiners, they say, well, actually, the biggest fish dissolve, and a lot of the cheaper fish, smaller fish, get to buy up discounted mining equipment. So that was their retort to that.
00:57:56.280 - 00:58:08.526, Speaker B: I don't know that that practically happens just because the economies of scale and the risks to launch, like, injecting enough capital to launch something like this are so large these days. In particular, you have to have a lot of capital in order to inject.
00:58:08.578 - 00:58:10.394, Speaker A: This makes sense to me.
00:58:10.592 - 00:58:26.640, Speaker B: The Bitcoin take on this is interesting about proof of work is that it's a free market anyone can enter. But actually, I find Staking much more compelling from that perspective, as a solo staker is never going to have to go bankrupt and go out of business, are they?
00:58:27.250 - 00:58:33.070, Speaker A: You don't need to invest to get ahead of your competition. You just put ether into your Validator.
00:58:33.890 - 00:58:55.190, Speaker B: It's interesting, and I think more might be ahead as they weather the storm. But let's talk about Binance. All right, maybe Binance is doing the thing that FDX could not, which is actually purchasing Voyager and helping to bail out some of the Voyager depositors, refresh US. Who is Voyager again? What's the story there and what's Finance doing?
00:58:55.260 - 00:59:40.440, Speaker A: Yeah, Voyager is the digital currency exchange that gave a $660,000,000 unsecured loan to Three Arrows Capital, who vaporized that loan and was unable to pay Voyager back, which caused Voyager to go into bankruptcy. And now Finance US is now looking to acquire. But no, not before Alameda attempted to bail out Voyager. So Alameda gave, I think, Voyager, like, a $250,000,000 line of revolving line of credit to maintain liquidity, and then Alameda went bust, and so here we are. Now Finance US has won a $1.2 billion bid to buy Voyager Digital and all of their distressed assets. And so this is looking like this is going to happen.
00:59:40.440 - 00:59:50.262, Speaker A: So cool. I guess this is some light at the end of the tunnel for anyone who had assets inside of Voyager. You might be able to get your money back as a result of this.
00:59:50.316 - 01:00:08.240, Speaker B: Are we worried about this, though? Is this mean? I'm feeling a little bit of deja vu. A big crypto banker steps in. Not SBF this time. It's CZ going and buying the just it feels kind of similar to a recent pattern. Is CZ different than SBF, though?
01:00:09.170 - 01:00:28.100, Speaker A: Is it ridiculous for me to say, like, let's just give CZ the benefit of the doubt? I don't know. He made it through two market cycles. He's doing the main character thing right now, which is a little bit concerning, but I don't know. He hasn't indicated anything that Binance is completely binance is above board, as far as I can tell.
01:00:28.790 - 01:00:44.026, Speaker B: That's the thing. The end statement is as far as we can tell, and we don't know for sure. But I guess the other option for Voyager was what complete Chapter Eleven bankruptcy. Go bust your death. So this has got to be at least better than that. This is a lifeline. This is some hope.
01:00:44.026 - 01:01:02.222, Speaker B: So we'll see if Binance and CZ can pull this off. This is a take. David I saw this week. So this is the Senate Banking Chairman says when asked about banning cryptocurrency, maybe could be a good idea. Not too sure. Here's a quote from him. Maybe banning it.
01:01:02.222 - 01:01:22.982, Speaker B: Although banning it is very difficult because it will go offshore. And who knows how that will work. Some of the Senator type conversation is absolutely maddening to me. A message to Sherrad Brown. You said banning it would be very difficult because it will go offshore. Let me give you another reason why it's going to be difficult. It's going to be difficult because we will fight you the entire time.
01:01:22.982 - 01:01:43.082, Speaker B: These are our digital property rights, Senator Brown. These are important. This is not only difficult because it will go offshore. It's difficult because this is a breach of our constitutional rights to own these sorts of assets and to preserve our think.
01:01:43.136 - 01:01:55.418, Speaker A: Also, I got news for you, Senator Brown. It's already offshore. If you ban it here, you're just banning your own citizens from accessing something that already exists. It's not going to go offshore. It's on the Internet.
01:01:55.514 - 01:01:59.458, Speaker B: Bro I think some of this is posturing similar to the kind of I.
01:01:59.464 - 01:02:08.226, Speaker A: Think some of this thing is just being uneducated about how this works. Maybe we'll ban crypto because I'm a regulator and I can do whatever the hell I want. I'll just ban that.
01:02:08.248 - 01:02:08.946, Speaker B: Oh, you like that?
01:02:08.968 - 01:02:11.702, Speaker A: I'll ban it. No, bro it's not how it works.
01:02:11.836 - 01:02:38.202, Speaker B: Yeah. Anyway, this would obviously be challenged in court. There'd be a lot of reasons why crypto is going to be difficult to ban, including, as he rightly points out, that it would be completely ineffective and counterproductive. So let's hope logic holds as we get into 2022. David all right, job time. This might be the last time we tell you in 2022 that you should get a job in crypto. Even now, even during the bear market is a good time to work in crypto for companies that are hiring.
01:02:38.202 - 01:02:39.726, Speaker B: I'm going to read out the job.
01:02:39.908 - 01:02:43.520, Speaker A: And Bitcoin denominated salaries are at all time highs right now.
01:02:44.210 - 01:03:04.050, Speaker B: Silver lining. I love it. Alchemy is hiring a backend engineer, uniswap Labs. They need a senior frontend engineer. Diagram Ventures needs an associate for crypto venture creation, rabbit hole business operations person. Diagram Ventures is continuing to hire two, I guess, crypto venture creation specialists. MakerDAO needs legal counsel.
01:03:04.050 - 01:03:15.946, Speaker B: I could go on, but I don't have to because these are posted on bankless palette.com jobs. And you can get a job in crypto and start 2023 off. Right. All right, David, what do we got coming up next?
01:03:16.048 - 01:03:32.474, Speaker A: Coming up next, we got some hot takes from crypto. Twitter and then Ryan and I take some time to shit on Wells Fargo because it's the end of the year. You got to punch them on the way out. And then, of course, we got the meme of the week, so all of that and more. First, though, we have to talk to some of these fantastic sponsors to help you go bankless.

01:05:20.488 - 01:05:43.686, Speaker A: Here's a tweet that I saw this week, Ryan, which documents the penalties that Wells Fargo has accrued since 2012. In 2012, 5.3 billion paid for mortgage abuses. In 2013, 1.9 billion paid for banking violations. In 2018, 2 billion was paid for toxic securities abuses. In 2020, 3 billion was paid for fraud.
01:05:43.686 - 01:06:02.506, Speaker A: And in 2022, just recently, 3.7 billion was paid for customer abuses. These are all collective penalties that Wells Fargo has paid. And I was doing a little bit of a deep dive just to fact check this. You know how many billions of dollars Wells Fargo has paid since 2000 in penalties?
01:06:02.618 - 01:06:05.040, Speaker B: Ryan I bet we're in double digits here.
01:06:05.490 - 01:06:13.618, Speaker A: We are at $20 billion of penalties wow. Paid by Wells Fargo since 2020. And I just really want to drive two more points home on this.
01:06:13.704 - 01:06:16.262, Speaker B: Wait, since 2000?
01:06:16.316 - 01:06:17.414, Speaker A: Since 2000.
01:06:17.612 - 01:06:18.310, Speaker B: Okay.
01:06:18.460 - 01:06:49.440, Speaker A: 120 billion dollars that they paid since 2000 is just a fraction of the money that they made, because they keep on doing it. So they made more money. These are all slaps on the wrist. So think about all of the shady ways that they made money and how much money you think that they made when they only paid $20 billion. So that's the first point I want to drive home. Second point is you don't get caught the first time you do something. And so we actually don't know what they these are just the things that we know about.
01:06:49.440 - 01:07:13.414, Speaker A: These are the things that they've just been caught for. And so they were fined $3.7 billion in 2022 for customer abuses. I'm going to go ahead and guess they've been abusing customers the whole time. I'm going to go ahead and guess that's the goddamn business model of the goddamn company. And it just happened to be that in 2022, the nation state said, hey, you're doing things a little bit shady. Pay us $3.7
01:07:13.414 - 01:07:26.486, Speaker A: billion to continue, and we'll just find you a few more billion dollars. In a few, we look good. You still get to yield. Farm your customers. Yeah. Absolutely insane.
01:07:26.598 - 01:07:38.494, Speaker B: Do you know what's crazy about this, too? As I look at this rap sheet, 5.3 billion. 2012 1.9 billion. 2013 2,000,002,018. I mean, this is a repeat offender, David. Yeah.
01:07:38.494 - 01:07:41.406, Speaker B: It's not like they just change what.
01:07:41.428 - 01:07:43.570, Speaker A: They are calling the offense.
01:07:45.350 - 01:07:49.454, Speaker B: Mortgage abuses, banking violations, toxic security abuses.
01:07:49.502 - 01:07:52.322, Speaker A: Fraud, customer abuses those could all be the same thing.
01:07:52.456 - 01:08:22.758, Speaker B: How does this link to going bankless? All right? It's just like, banks suck. We know from a UX perspective, they're also preying on their customers, it seems like, with kind of a rent seeking, in many ways, toxic business model, bankless has always been about using less banks over time. By the way, somebody over the weekend on Twitter tried to nail us and get us with a Gotcha, which was basically like David and Ryan. Are you guys even bankless anyway? Or do you secretly have bank accounts?
01:08:22.854 - 01:08:26.778, Speaker A: Do you think my secretly landlord accepts Ethereum?
01:08:26.874 - 01:08:32.026, Speaker B: No, we don't secretly have bank accounts. We publicly have bank accounts.
01:08:32.058 - 01:08:33.306, Speaker A: We've talked about this forever.
01:08:33.418 - 01:09:19.610, Speaker B: Yes, we want to have less bank accounts over time. And every year, a benchmark for me, David, since I've been on this crypto journey, is more of my net worth outside of banks than inside of banks. Number one. And am I using crypto money systems more than I'm using my Wells Fargo account? I literally have a Wells Fargo account that I'm stuck with because I have to pay bills in real life, all right? And every single year, those two metrics have gone up in that. I have been more bankless this year than I was in the previous year. And that's what this journey is about. Because, look, these predatory practices, this kind of landlord, rent seeking, middleman type of behavior that most of the time goes unchecked.
01:09:19.610 - 01:09:47.800, Speaker B: We can solve this at the protocol level. How? Everybody owns their own money. We don't require the banks to give us permission to withdraw money from an account. We can have a smart contract wallet with a circle of social recovery, a small set of friends and family that I trust help me recover my keys. I can use DeFi rather than use the traditional banking system. That's why we're on this journey, so Wells Fargo can't screw us any longer.
01:09:48.250 - 01:10:04.366, Speaker A: Nice rant. That's great. It's really just a matter of just like my Wells Fargo account is like gathering dust. And you know how I know this is like I have to reset my password every time I log in because I always forget it. Then I got a password manager, and now I don't have to.
01:10:04.468 - 01:10:06.846, Speaker B: Have you actually gone in person to Wells Fargo this year?
01:10:06.948 - 01:10:10.206, Speaker A: I remember this year. No, not this year.
01:10:10.388 - 01:10:11.034, Speaker B: Our bank.
01:10:11.082 - 01:10:13.382, Speaker A: Oh, no, I did, because I needed to get quarters.
01:10:13.546 - 01:10:20.850, Speaker B: Remember we used to do, like, bankless paychecks with actual physical checks? I think you had to show up at Wells Fargo and cash with your bank.
01:10:21.510 - 01:10:22.820, Speaker A: Exactly, yeah.
01:10:25.190 - 01:10:48.220, Speaker B: Our previous bank, by the way. Bankless. The company density was previously banked with bank of America, and they sent us a Dear John letter and kicked us out one day. We have nice little community credit unions. Ironic that we actually were made bankless. But anyway, that's Wells Fargo continuing to be great. Be great.
01:10:49.630 - 01:11:18.822, Speaker A: Be really good content for this podcast, that's for sure. So here's the associated meme with this. So after Wells Fargo gets violated pays violations, here's my favorite SpongeBob meme, which is the SpongeBob looking at that rock. He goes like, want me to see me running? This is an esoteric SpongeBob meme. He's like basically the flash. And he goes like, want to see me go and touch that rock? Want to see me do it again? If you didn't get the SpongeBob meme, then you didn't get it. I'm sorry I butchered it, but whatever.
01:11:18.876 - 01:11:28.322, Speaker B: Bankless fans are going crazy right now. They're wildest excitement. Just a reminder, this is from me. I actually received a Binance account deactivation notice.
01:11:28.466 - 01:11:29.254, Speaker A: Good for you.
01:11:29.372 - 01:11:53.826, Speaker B: From an old Binance account that I had that I no longer used. This is what it looked like. Account deactivation notice. Thank you for your support of finance. This is to inform you that your account has been flagged by a third party compliance tool, and we have taken a tough decision to terminate the service. You may withdraw your funds and ask that you do it before December 27. So give me, like, ten days or something.
01:11:53.826 - 01:12:32.774, Speaker B: Afterward, your finance account will be permanently deactivated. Look, this is just a PSA for us to remember that the crypto banks that we use, they can provide a fantastic service, are very important, great crypto platforms. They could still deactivate your account. What is the definition of a bank is you can deactivate your account. And so this is why we are such advocates of decentralized financial systems like Ethereum. An ETH address can never be deactivated. I'm never going to get an email or a message like that saying you can no longer access your private keys on Ethereum.
01:12:32.774 - 01:12:45.406, Speaker B: Right. That just can't happen. I have direct access to it and always will. And so that is, I think, a distinction that a lot of people learned in 2022. And yeah, just another reminder of it. When I got this account notice from.
01:12:45.428 - 01:13:34.018, Speaker A: Finance, and then you had a critique or, oriel Zengo, who said, okay, but your Ethereum wallet can be stolen, phished, lost, tricked in, malicious scams. And your reply is exactly what I was going to say. Yes, those are all things that you as an individual have control over. As somebody that has juggled 50 wallets over the last, like, five years, never lost a single one, never gotten fished, never been tricked in a malicious scam, except for that one iota scam, and I haven't, even though I've never been stolen. So, yes, it can be those things, but that's because I'm in control. Like stolen fish, lost, tricked. And that could happen to your Wells Fargo, probably, but that's their problem.
01:13:34.018 - 01:13:35.538, Speaker A: Now. What's your problem?
01:13:35.704 - 01:13:53.670, Speaker B: See, the only time I've actually lost sums of money in crypto has actually been on crypto banks lending platforms. Really? Yeah. Remember I've lost a little bit in Celsius, a little bit in BlockFi. Those are the only times I've actually lost money.
01:13:53.820 - 01:13:59.000, Speaker A: So you can't lose your own money. You'll just trust somebody else to lose it for you. Great.
01:14:00.490 - 01:14:06.294, Speaker B: All right, man. It's been a year, hasn't it, David? It's been a fun year. Good in so many ways.
01:14:06.412 - 01:14:12.542, Speaker A: 51 weekly roll ups. Yeah, I'm going to do I'm going to do the 52nd next week. But you're going to be out.
01:14:12.676 - 01:14:22.142, Speaker B: Yeah. Oh, thank you. Thank you for doing that. But let's end with this then. What are you bullish on? And this could be this week, this could be going into 2023, whatever you're bullish on right now.
01:14:22.196 - 01:15:02.378, Speaker A: Oh, I'm bullish on 2023 the whole entire year. And not just in crypto. Although I'll say it again, when prices are this low and when we're down this bad, it's kind of like up, only hopefully the upside is larger than the downside, that's for sure. But what I'm talking about in 2023 is a little bit just more like 2022 was challenging for the crypto world, also for bankless. And I know, you know, this, like, team has grown bigly. We're doing some really ambitious things. And now I'm at the point in my own personal life where, like, oh, I can't just ape into 2023 without a plan.
01:15:02.378 - 01:15:30.680, Speaker A: And so I've got my calendar up, I was like, in this month, I'm doing this, in that month I'm doing that. I need to have this done by this month. And so I'm just leaning into the whole structure thing and I encourage other Bankless listeners to do something similar. Like if you, for example, were listening to the ETH Global hackathons and you want to go to some of those, get a calendar, put them on. Also put ETH Denver on there. Put ECC on there. Like, set up a goal, a system of goals for 2023.
01:15:30.680 - 01:15:51.582, Speaker A: Because if you're going to win big in crypto, that's what it's going to take. So, Ryan, I'm bullish on 2023 being like a planned, structured year for all of the crypto industry, for me personally, for Bankless, and hopefully we can all just plan the end of the bull market rather than just wait for it to happen 100%.
01:15:51.636 - 01:16:27.938, Speaker B: I'm so bullish on having a plan going into 2023. Well, you know, I'm a planner. Look, that's how you too many people, I think, were just thrown by the seat of their pants and went wherever the wind carried them in 2021 and 2022, they didn't have a bedrock thesis for the space. They didn't have a plan for the space. They would FOMO into things and during the FUD times they would sell at the bottoms. That's a recipe for disaster. You just get thrown around and tossed by the wind and you can never accomplish anything.
01:16:27.938 - 01:16:34.582, Speaker B: So, yeah, I'm absolutely bullish on having a plan, too. You know what else I'm bullish on, though, David?
01:16:34.646 - 01:16:35.420, Speaker A: Tell me.
01:16:36.270 - 01:17:07.400, Speaker B: I am bullish on 2023. Being way smarter than 2022. 2022 was just dumb. And I don't want this to sound glib, but I think we have some separation on it where we could zoom out and distance ourselves from it. But 2022 really needed to happen. Yeah, it absolutely needed to happen. There's no way we could have a successful 2023 or 2024 without 2022 happening.
01:17:07.400 - 01:17:27.850, Speaker B: Crypto is now way smarter. A lot of the tourists have left. A lot of the corrupt fraudsters are out, too. The shaky companies have been completely wrecked. Much of this was justified, some of it didn't. It wasn't, of course, but much of it was. And we're coming into 2023 way stronger, way smarter.
01:17:27.850 - 01:17:55.122, Speaker B: Crypto didn't die. Once again, the builders are still building. And this is the underlined ever since we started this Bankless podcast. We started this podcast because there's a recognition, I think that you and I have, that the world needs crypto more than ever. And going into 2023, it's the same thing. It's like the world needs crypto even more than when we started the podcast back in 2020. David yeah, big time.
01:17:55.122 - 01:18:20.714, Speaker B: It's become more critical, more necessary, and we are smarter. We're better capitalized, we have more builders in the space, we have a clear roadmap and direction for where we're going. So that's what I'm excited about is we just got a lot smarter. 2023 is going to be a fantastic year. I think it could be one of the best years for being in crypto. I don't have the hopelessness that I had in 2018. Right.
01:18:20.714 - 01:18:26.814, Speaker B: I'm like, oh, we'll get through this. Not a big deal. And yeah, I'm excited about it.
01:18:26.932 - 01:18:50.930, Speaker A: There was like a vibe in about like 2019, I think, where it was the golden age of building an ethereum. It was really the golden age that so many of us during the peak of the bull market were like, man, I really want some of those quiet times to come back. 2019 feels like 2023. It's like, okay, the pain is behind us. There's just building left and just signal and progress. That kind of feels like the right timing.
01:18:51.010 - 01:19:10.858, Speaker B: Is this David too stupid to map? It is like, 2019 is like 2023, right? 2020 is going to be 2024, analogous. And then we're going to get another 2021 that's going to be 2025. Do you think it will just play out pretty much exactly like that or close to that? It's just another fractal pattern.
01:19:11.034 - 01:19:16.720, Speaker A: You asked if it's too stupid to do that. I think yes. And it's still going to be, right?
01:19:19.650 - 01:19:39.122, Speaker B: I think so too. If you were to ask my just gun to my head prediction on how this is played, that's exactly what I would say. I would say we'll have next year where we're building, it's going to be like 2019. And it'll be 2023 will be just builders. There'll be some chop. It'll be boring. It'll be all sideways action.
01:19:39.122 - 01:19:47.766, Speaker B: We won't even get any big run ups. And then 2022 will hit and we'll have a glimmer. And it'll be something like, no will.
01:19:47.788 - 01:19:52.186, Speaker A: Be the bull market, but only in hindsight. You won't know it in the moment.
01:19:52.288 - 01:20:10.222, Speaker B: And a small segment of people, only the people who have stayed around will actually see the glimmers. We won't get mainstream in 2024. It'll be like 2022. And then we'll have breakout in 2025. And we'll get back to kind of mania craziness 2021. We'll have calm down.
01:20:10.356 - 01:20:12.560, Speaker A: We'll all forget to sell. It'll be great.
01:20:14.470 - 01:20:18.290, Speaker B: That's what I would predict. Meme of the week. What are we looking at, David?
01:20:20.230 - 01:20:39.046, Speaker A: How it started. Sam Bankman Fried playing with some magic cards, sitting in front of six monitors in his gaming chair, looking like a traitor. God. It's how it started. And now it's how it's going, which is being escorted with unshaved, unkempt sweaty shirt into a jail. Wow, it's going.
01:20:39.148 - 01:20:42.860, Speaker B: These two pictures sum up the beginning of this year and the end of this year.
01:20:43.390 - 01:20:46.122, Speaker A: The top of 2022 and the bottom of 2022.
01:20:46.256 - 01:20:55.518, Speaker B: Well, guys, Bankless listeners, on behalf of us to you, I hope you enjoy some time with your family. Happy holidays. David's going to be with you next week. Next Friday for the roll, I got.
01:20:55.524 - 01:20:56.778, Speaker A: To reach out to Anthony.
01:20:56.954 - 01:21:21.154, Speaker B: Never misses a roll up. All right, I'm going to be gone, but he's going to give you a final send off before the new year and we hope you enjoyed this year with Bankless. We've certainly enjoyed bringing this to you, even though it's been such a crazy year. It's been a lot of fun as well. So risks and disclaimers got to end like this.
