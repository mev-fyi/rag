00:00:00.440 - 00:00:58.765, Speaker A: Somebody borrowed 100,000 bitcoin and are selling into the Luna foundation guards purchasing of bitcoins to fund what will ultimately become the attack on Terra that brought it down. The attacker who amassed over a billion UST if they have a bunch of us that means they have a bunch of us t to sell which means somebody needs to absorb what will ultimately become 1 billion UST token sell pressure. And so during the first phase of this attack they sell 350 million USD into the curve pool and that is what causes the initial destabilization. And this is where a lot of people start to pay attention here around May 6th or 7th the attacker who has 650 remaining UST tokens they take that 650 million USC tokens to Binance and they start aggressively selling on binance between lots of 300,000 to 3 million UST at a time. Somebody is defending the peg at 0.98 cents preventing the price from going down. But at some point that defender either just capitulates or they ran out of money and it breaks through the 98 cents.
