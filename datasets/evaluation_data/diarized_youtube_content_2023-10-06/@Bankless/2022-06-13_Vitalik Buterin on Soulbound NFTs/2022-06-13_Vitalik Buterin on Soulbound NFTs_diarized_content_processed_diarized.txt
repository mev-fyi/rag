00:00:00.090 - 00:00:07.322, Speaker A: What is the point of putting something on the blockchain if that thing cannot be transferred to another address? So what does that non transferability unlock?
00:00:07.386 - 00:00:58.540, Speaker B: Basically, if you have on chain transferable things, right, then on chain transferable things are going to basically just get transferred to the highest bidder. The word soul bound comes from World of Warcraft to where there is this type of item in the game called a soul bound item, where basically once you pick it up, you can't transfer it to another player, you can't trade it, you can't auction. I've always thought that that's a very good mechanism, because if that mechanism did not exist, then basically everything would just be sold. And so if you wanted to get all of the best stuff, all you would just have to do is go off into the forest and kill boars for like six months in a row without ever going to sleep. And you'd just be able to get all of the same stuff anyone else has without actually doing anything challenging. Basically, once those kinds of things become possible, then the whole concept just kind of starts to lose meaning. So that's why I think credentials have to be non transferable if we want credentials to actually represent properties of a person.
