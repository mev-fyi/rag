00:00:00.090 - 00:00:32.562, Speaker A: Clocking into number 16, DFI bigger than CFI. And this is a story, I think, in two parts. The first is this. We're looking at a tweet from Hayden Adams. Uniswap just became the first decentralized trading platform to process over 100 billion in volume, an exciting milestone for DFI that on some days was larger than the volume on Coinbase. Also, there were some days in 2021 that stablecoin look, liquidity and volumes on Uniswap V three dwarfed that of Coinbase as well. The second part of this story is Antonio from DyDX.
00:00:32.562 - 00:00:51.580, Speaker A: I left Coinbase and I eventually founded Dy DX. Today, for the first time, Dy DX is doing more volume than Coinbase. This DFI protocol deployed on L2, now doing more volume than the Coinbase exchange. DFI grew bigger than CFI in a few cases in 221, and that's a big deal.
