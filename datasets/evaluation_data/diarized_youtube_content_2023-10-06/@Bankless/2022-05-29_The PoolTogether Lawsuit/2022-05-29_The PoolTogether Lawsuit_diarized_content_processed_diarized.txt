00:00:00.090 - 00:00:20.062, Speaker A: Somebody deposited $12 into pool together and immediately filed a quarter billion dollar class action lawsuit on pool together. Because flagging is like it's a lottery. It's illegal. I lost money on gas. I'm not making a joke about that. That's in the whole thing. Pool together has sadly been paying hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars of legal fees to fight this thing.
00:00:20.062 - 00:00:25.366, Speaker A: This very innocent, very beloved DFI app you literally cannot lose money savings account.
00:00:25.388 - 00:00:26.120, Speaker B: It's called a.
00:00:26.490 - 00:00:42.294, Speaker A: Linked savings account. You put your money in, and every once in a while, if you win, you get a bunch of money, and then if you don't, if you want to get out, you get out. They're not just going after pool together. They're going after Defi, and they're using pool together to do it. And so if you think that this isn't your problem, it is your problem. This is an attack on all of us.
00:00:42.332 - 00:00:56.540, Speaker B: I think, David, this could become a shelling point for the rest of the Defi community, because this is like the first battle of a war that we have to fight. Will this court case kill Defi? Of course it can't kill Defi. What this is about is making sure that Americans, people in the US, do not get left behind.
