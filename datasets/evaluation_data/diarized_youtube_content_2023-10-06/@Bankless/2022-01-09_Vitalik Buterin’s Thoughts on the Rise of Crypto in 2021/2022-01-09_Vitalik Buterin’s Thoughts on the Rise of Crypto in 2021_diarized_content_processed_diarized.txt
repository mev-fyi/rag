00:00:00.090 - 00:00:03.774, Speaker B: What are your thoughts on 2021? Was it a good year for crypto? What'd you think about it?
00:00:03.812 - 00:00:53.340, Speaker A: I definitely think it was a great year for adoption and for mainstream attention. The rise of NFTs was definitely something really fascinating to see and I think it's brought a lot of people into the crypto space that would not have gone into it before. The rise of daos is definitely also interesting and exciting. We've been seeing more and more daos that are actually doing a lot, lots of interesting things, experimenting with different governance algorithms, projects like Citadel that are actually trying to do things in the physical world. The progress that we have seen in layer two scaling I think has been really amazing. I think over the course of this year really seen layer twos go from theory to practice and now we have this thriving ecosystem and people are really experiencing what a layer two with am looks like firsthand. Definitely lots of happy things to report this year.
