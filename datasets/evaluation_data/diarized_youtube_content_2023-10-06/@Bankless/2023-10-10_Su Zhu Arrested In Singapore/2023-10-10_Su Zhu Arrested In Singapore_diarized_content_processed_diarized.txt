00:00:00.090 - 00:00:30.740, Speaker A: What happened to Suzu? This week, Suzu was arrested in an airport in Singapore while trying to travel out of the country. The 3 hours capital liquidator Teno received a committal order against Suzu after he did not comply with a court order to cooperate with an investigation involving liquidation. The order has sentenced sue to four months in prison and has also placed an order out against Kyle Davies, who has not been arrested, which I can only presume means that he is on the run. He's been doing, like, CNBC interviews and such. Not a while. Not like. Not in a while, but like three months ago, he was.
