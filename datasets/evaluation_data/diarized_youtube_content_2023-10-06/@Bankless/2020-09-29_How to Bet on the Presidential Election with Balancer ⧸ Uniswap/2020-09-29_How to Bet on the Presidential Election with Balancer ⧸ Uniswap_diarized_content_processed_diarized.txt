00:00:19.180 - 00:01:15.632, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. This is defi dad. And this is another bankless tutorial. Tonight is the first debate in the US presidential election, so we thought it would be interesting to do a tutorial on how to take advantage of the Auger foundry application. This allows me to tokenize outcome shares in a prediction market. And all that mumbo jumbo just means that if I want to participate in an auger prediction market, normally I have to go to the Auger application. But when we mint tokens which have a claim on whether you believe the outcome will be yes or no, in terms of will Donald Trump win the 2020 us presidential election, it should be easier to participate and gain exposure by simply buying a token.
00:01:15.632 - 00:02:24.430, Speaker A: So there is a balancer pool with Dai and what's referred to as the y Trump, as in yes Trump, and N Trump as in no Trump. And then there's also a pool in uniswap with the y Trump pairing. So in balancer, you can have up to three tokens, which is awesome because it allows for, I think in this case, liquidity amidst Dai, and then the two different outcomes. In uniswap, you would need two different pools. Here. One is for the Y Trump token, and then another liquidity pool for the N Trump token. So, long story short, if I want to participate in this market, if others do the service of minting these tokens, or minting these shares in the outcome of this prediction market, and if they provide that liquidity on Uniswap or balancer, I then can buy those tokens if I want to bet on the outcome of the market.
00:02:24.430 - 00:03:24.760, Speaker A: So this tutorial really could be over for anyone who simply wants exposure to the outcome of this market, all you have to do is go to this balancer pool or this uniswap pool. I'll link them both in the show notes. You would just buy the token. So if the market know after the election is decided and it resolves, yes, as in Trump wins the election, each y Trump token settles for one die, and each n Trump, as in no Trump, pays out at zero. So if it resolves no, each of the N Trump tokens will settle for one die and the y Trump tokens lose, and hence it pays out zero. So let's go back to the auger foundry, and I'm going to walk through how to mint these outcome shares in the prediction market. So right now, there's only one prediction market available here in the Auger foundry.
00:03:24.760 - 00:03:56.984, Speaker A: Please be aware, this is not audited. According to the blog post by the Auger team, so don't put any money into this that you're not 100% willing to lose. So I'll mint ten shares. So let's go ahead and mint. It's going to be two metamask transactions per usual. So let's check what the gas price is. So according to the ether scan gas tracker, a price of 88 gwe will get this through in nine minutes or less.
00:03:56.984 - 00:04:48.520, Speaker A: I'm going to go ahead and put this up to 90 just to be safe. And then I'm going to put the permission here to just ten die. That way, there's not unlimited permission to spend my die. All right, so it's about 1 minute later, and this is the second transaction that's coming through. Bear in mind I'm doing this as an experiment. You can imagine if I were doing this with any sort of intent of making a profit, I would want to consider how much I'm actually minting here at ten shares compared to what is my gas price at $10 of ether. So gas prices are still around 88 guay to get it through in less than ten minutes.
00:04:48.520 - 00:05:33.640, Speaker A: So I'll put this through at 90 guay just to be safe. And let's go ahead and confirm. All right, looks like my shares were minted successfully according to the little pop ups here. Let's check and see what this looks like when we refresh. So you can see here under holdings of ERC 1155, which is a newer token standard. I'm not going to really go into it much, but just know that this is what enables us to take advantage of tokenizing the outcome of a prediction market. And so I can see here that I'm holding ten yes, ten no at this point.
00:05:33.640 - 00:06:09.860, Speaker A: So I'm going to go ahead and wrap my shares. I'll use the same gas price or close to it as before, and we'll hit confirm. All right, so that first transaction or the third one that I've done here, the third one was to give approval to wrap my shares. It's that usual, like give approval to spend something on Ethereum. So this should be the final transaction. And let's see, I'm going to put through a gas price of. Let's do a little bit less at 85 gWe.
00:06:09.860 - 00:07:00.770, Speaker A: All right, so the wrapping is done. So I now have converted these tokenized outcomes in the market for will Donald Trump win the 2020 us presidential election. I've tokenized those into ERC 20 tokens, which means that I could provide those tokens as liquidity on balancer, or uniswap. And so the next step beyond having minted those tokenized outcomes for the prediction market is I can click add liquidity. And then I've currently got ten of these, the Y Trump and N Trump. And I could add these then as liquidity. So I could add the maximum, let's say, of this maximum of this.
00:07:00.770 - 00:07:33.196, Speaker A: This will allow you then to do that as a single asset as well. All right, that's all I've got for you today. I hope you find this helpful.
