00:00:06.570 - 00:00:15.998, Speaker A: Welcome to Bankless, where we explore the frontier of Internet money and Internet finance. This is how to get started, how to get better, and how to front run the opportunity.
00:00:16.164 - 00:00:16.826, Speaker B: I'm Ryan.
00:00:16.858 - 00:00:28.102, Speaker A: Sean Adams. I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless. David, we have Vitalik on once again. What topics do we cover?
00:00:28.236 - 00:01:10.718, Speaker C: Yeah, we cover three of his most recent blogs on his Vitalik, CA blog. These are all fantastic reads. And in order to help amplify Vitalik's message and try and get out what he's trying to get out, we go through each of these blog pieces together. We start with his recap of 2020 and his forward looking kind of his forward looking predictions into 2021. That blog was particularly interesting. That's how we start the conversation. We move into his blog post called an incomplete guide to roll ups, and he kind of helped us unpack what it is to be a roll up, how we as an Ethereum l two scaling community landed on roll ups as a construction and why they are so powerful.
00:01:10.718 - 00:01:44.234, Speaker C: And then we also get into the topic of social recovery wallet. So these are all relatively three different topics, but I would say they are all forward looking topics that Vitalik sees as kind of like the logical conclusion of a lot of different forces, perhaps, maybe a lot of them social, a lot of them political, in his first blog post that we get into. But then the second two are more technological and about the way that Ethereum, the landscape is going to manifest and mature over time. So again, a wide ranging conversation, but still with a lot of awesome through lines. Absolutely.
00:01:44.352 - 00:02:07.540, Speaker A: If you're listening on the podcast, of course we have this on YouTube as well, where we actually go through the articles visually. If you're watching this on YouTube, you can check it out on the podcast and get it directly into your ears. Make it more portable that way. David, we should just get right into the interview. But before we do, guys, we want to talk about the sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:02:08.170 - 00:02:25.222, Speaker D: If you want to live a bankless life, you need to get a monolith defi Visa card. Monolith is a one two punch of both an Ethereum smart contract wallet and an accompanying Visa card that lets you spend the money that you have in your Ethereum wallet everywhere where Visa is accepted.
00:02:25.286 - 00:02:27.034, Speaker C: When you swipe your monolith Visa card.
00:02:27.072 - 00:03:15.980, Speaker D: At the grocery store or at a restaurant, it actually makes a transaction on the ethereum blockchain that spends some of the money you hold in your monolith wallet. It's insanely cool and it's one of the best tools out there for living a bankless but still normal life. Monolith also offers on ramp services for getting your fiat money into the world of defi, so it's trivial to top up your monolith card if you ever need to, and your deposited money goes straight into your non custodial wallet. So your money is never held by a centralized intermediary. Because monolith is native ethereum infrastructure, the money you hold in your monolith wallet still has the power of defi behind it. Swapping assets on uniswap or earning yield in defi is at your fingertips. Go to monolith XYZ and sign up to get your monolith Visa card today.
00:03:15.980 - 00:04:08.154, Speaker D: If you are looking for a product that connects your fiat bank account with Defi tokens and products, you need to download the Dharma mobile app. Dharma is a non custodial smart contract wallet and comes with a bridge that connects you right into your bank account. Dharma is the fastest and most efficient wallet between your fiat in your bank account and any token on Uniswap, or even any vault in yearn. With Dharma, you can get over $25,000 per week into the DFI universe, and you can do it noncustodially. If you or anyone you know is hot on DFI and you're trying to get your money into a Defi investment, Dharma is the place to go. Signing up and going through KYC is an absolute breeze. It took me just under 3 minutes, and after signing into my bank account via plaid, I am now just one transaction away from any token that uniswap has to offer.
00:04:08.154 - 00:04:19.120, Speaker D: Go to ww dharma IO. That's D-H-A-R-M-A IO. Download the Dharma app and get yourself unbanked today.
00:04:20.370 - 00:04:40.226, Speaker A: This is an incomplete guide to roll ups. So, Vitalik, can we go through the incomplete guide to roll ups? Maybe direct this to someone who has heard about the buz that maybe roll ups are Ethereum's next big scaling solution, right? And it's kind of the promised land of reducing gas fees.
00:04:40.338 - 00:04:42.146, Speaker B: Tell us, what are roll ups?
00:04:42.178 - 00:04:43.800, Speaker A: Where would you like to start with this?
00:04:44.570 - 00:05:33.142, Speaker B: Sure. So roll ups are a member of this family of scalability solutions that we call L2 scaling. There's this long running dichotomy between layer one scaling and L2 scaling, where layer one scaling says we increase how many transactions we can process by making the blockchain able to process more transactions. And L2 scaling says we increase the number of transactions we can process by moving work off chain. And instead of running everything on chain directly, we only run kind of more limited verification activities on chain. And so we use these more clever contraptions to reduce the need to use the chain in the first place. And in the case of bitcoin, this was basically the topic of their civil war.
00:05:33.142 - 00:06:33.802, Speaker B: But in the case of ethereum, we're basically doing layer one and L2 scaling at the same time, right? We have sharding for layer one scaling, but we also have this very kind of healthy and rich L2 scaling ecosystem. And I talk about the three scaling approaches. So there's channels in plasma and roll ups, and channels are this method for optimizing one to one interactions. So for example, channels are really good at the use case of like, let's say I'm selling you an Internet connection and you want to pay me per megabyte. And then what would happen is that I would start for giving you an Internet connection and then every time it would reach 1 would just send me these off chain messages that I call tickets. So your first ticket would be a signed message that just says, I'm paying you 0.1, your second ticket would be a message that says, I'm paying you 0.2,
00:06:33.802 - 00:07:33.278, Speaker B: and so forth. And the way this works is that I only needs to actually put on chain the very last ticket or the highest value ticket that you send, right? And so basically what you're doing is you're making these payments, but we're not yet committing them. And you just constantly keep paying more by just replacing these payments with higher value payments. And then when I publish the last payments on chain, I'm basically kind of settling all of these payments at the same time. And it's happening in one transaction. And the smart contract implements this kind of interaction game where basically, let's say if you try to submit one of your tickets that has a smaller payment, then I can challenge and I can send your ticket that has the higher payment. Or if I just disappear completely, then you can send your own payments or your own tickets to close the channel and get your money back and so on.
00:07:33.278 - 00:08:40.174, Speaker B: So channels are good for bi directional payments, and there are things like the Lightning network and raiden that tried to expand that out to broader payment networks, but they also do have some weaknesses, right? They're fairly complicated to deal with. They have these high capital requirements and so forth. Then there's plasma. And plasma is this very technically clever construction that it turns out plasma is really amazing for dealing with non fungible tokens because the whole idea with plasma is that you basically assign every unit of an asset a different id. And then you have this kind of Merkel tree contraption where if an asset has some sub iDx, then the transaction that corresponds to that address goes into a Merkel tree at index x. Then you publish the Merkel roots on chain. And then if someone who has some asset X wants to withdraw it, then they would publish an operation on chain, and then they would have to provide that Merkel branch.
00:08:40.174 - 00:09:14.586, Speaker B: And if someone else wants to challenge them, well, they can do that. And then all the challenges happen just by providing these Merkel branches. So plasma is this really clever thing. It's good for asset transfers, it's good for payments that can be used for exchange. So the OMG network has been doing a great job of pushing the plasma vision toward its logical conclusion and basically doing as great a job as it can possibly be done with it. So very happy that their work exists. But then we move on to the third solution, which is roll ups.
00:09:14.586 - 00:10:09.226, Speaker B: And roll ups are a fascinating class of technology because in some ways, they're not a full L2 scheme. Right? And what I mean by that is that in a traditional L2 scheme, all the data and all the computation of at least each additional transaction is fully off chain. Right? Like in plasma, you do have to publish Merkel roots on chain, but that's 32 bytes. It's 32 bytes if there's ten users, and it's 32 bytes if there's 10,000 users. In a roll up, you have to publish. It looks like somewhere around like ten to 15 bytes of data on chain for every transaction. Now you are able to move all the computation off chain, and you are able to move most of the data off chain, but you do need to have some amounts of data on chain for every transaction.
00:10:09.226 - 00:11:14.334, Speaker B: And it turns out that the ability to have data on chain basically just gets around some very fundamental game theory issues that have to do with data availability. And in my blog post, I linked to this YouTube video that I made. I think it was in some Stanford conference or meetup or one of those, where I just talk about why data availability is hard and why there's these complicated game theory issues around. Basically, you can't have a fraud proof system for data the same way you can have a fraud proof system for computation and roll ups. Plasma and channels kind of get around this issue by relying on this explicit concept of owners that basically says that every asset has an owner, and if the owner for that asset misbehaves, then the system can fail, but the system can fail in only one direction. And that direction, basically, is that the owner loses the asset. But in a roll up, you actually can just make a hard guarantee that says the state definitely will be processed correctly.
00:11:14.334 - 00:11:57.866, Speaker B: And it turns out that that's really important if you want applications to become more general purpose. Right? Because in more general purpose applications, you can't map assets to owners. Who's the owner of Uniswap is the easiest example. There is no single actor who's kind of the logical beneficiary of everything that happens inside of Uniswap. It's just this automated thing that exists on chain, and it benefits everyone, and it's owned by no one. So then I get into, basically, how does a roll up work, right? And the core idea of a roll up is basically that there is a smart contract on chain. And that smart contract maintains a state route.
00:11:57.866 - 00:12:41.914, Speaker B: It maintains, basically a merkle hash of all the state inside the roll up. So that means all the account balances, all the contracts code, everything inside the roll up, you have this Merkel hash. And that Merkel hash gets maintained by the roll up contract. Anyone can publish what we call a batch. And a batch is basically this collection of transactions in this very compressed form, together with basically a record of the previous state route and a record of the new state route. So a batch is basically a claim that says if you start here, if you start from this state route and you apply these transactions, then this is the new state route. Now, in reality, the batch by itself does not have enough information to fully compute the new state route.
00:12:41.914 - 00:13:37.134, Speaker B: Because if you want to actually compute that, you need to have the Merkle branches. And of course, you don't actually want to compute all this stuff on chain. So instead, what happens is that the roll up just believes the batches by default. And then you have one of two mechanisms for proving that these batches are correct, right? So one of them is optimistic roll ups, and the other is ZK roll ups. And here's where we get to the core difference between these two great families of roll ups, right? In an optimistic roll up, what you have is a system where you basically kind of trust but verify, right? So the smart contract kind of trusts the batches by default, and it just accepts the results of the batches by default. But then there are nodes in the network that actually do run the full computation. And if one of them discovers that something is wrong, then they can publish a challenge.
00:13:37.134 - 00:14:21.882, Speaker B: And if they get challenged correctly, then the badge that's incorrect gets reverted, and whoever submitted the badge loses their deposit and the challenger gets a reward. And then you kind of continue from there. So optimistic basically says trust by default. But if someone challenges, then if the thing they challenge is incorrect, then you revert it. And as long as you trust that there is at least somebody online who can revert, then the mechanism works. Now, ZK roll ups, they use validity proofs, right? ZK roll ups use these kind of fancy cryptographic proofs that we call ZK snarks. And they basically prove directly that the post state route is a correct result of executing the batch on top of the prestate route.
00:14:21.882 - 00:15:11.002, Speaker B: And the way that these proofs work is really complicated. I've tried to make a couple of explanations of this. I'm sure I'll try making more explanations of this in the future. But these are just incredibly powerful and just incredibly clever mathematical contraptions that actually let you make a proof of a computation that takes a long time to compute, where that proof itself can be verified extremely quickly. And this is what ZK rollups rely on. So there's these fairly complicated trade offs between optimistic and ZK roll ups, right? In terms of the fixed gas cost of each batch, which influences how frequently batches can be published, the withdrawal period. So optimistic roll ups, the fixed cost per batch is much smaller, which means batches can be published much more frequently.
00:15:11.002 - 00:15:58.414, Speaker B: ZK roll ups have instant withdrawals. Optimistic roll ups have withdrawals that take one week. But the thing that you can do if you want optimistic roll ups to have instant withdrawals is you can basically have a kind of third party market. So basically, if I have, say, one ETH that's being withdrawn in progress, then if you were validating the roll up and you are perfectly confident that withdrawal is correct, then what you can do is you can just buy that, buy my right to one ETH for, say, one ETH minus a fee, you can just buy up my withdrawals rights for, say, 0.99 ETH. I would get my 0.99 ETH immediately, and then you would just wait a week, and then you would get your one ETH at the end, right?
00:15:58.612 - 00:16:01.002, Speaker C: Or your .1 ETh.
00:16:01.146 - 00:16:02.240, Speaker B: No, sorry.
00:16:03.670 - 00:16:04.500, Speaker C: I see.
00:16:05.350 - 00:16:36.982, Speaker B: I sacrifice my right to one instead. I get 0.99 immediately. You, as the buyer of the withdrawal, pay me 0.99 immediately and you get the full one at the end. So this is a technique that's available for optimistic roll ups to have instant withdrawals. But it does have capital costs and importantly, it doesn't work with nfts because with nfts, inherently there is nobody who has a second copy of the same NFT that they can collateralize.
00:16:36.982 - 00:17:16.082, Speaker B: But for coins, it works amazingly. Complexity of technology. Optimistic roll ups are simpler generalizability. Optimistic roll ups are easier to have kind of full general purpose EVM computation for. And this is something that's really important, right. There already are ZK roll ups that are live, and ZK roll ups, like there's ZK sync, there's loop ring, there's the diversify. And those can be application specific, but it's very hard to make them support much more general purpose computation.
00:17:16.082 - 00:18:04.882, Speaker B: Whereas with an optimistic roll up, like, well, we already have one on main net that's basically running EVM code on L2, and then per transaction on chain gas costs. So this basically means are the on chain costs that you have to pay per transaction. So this is basically paying for the 16 bytes. It turns out that there's technical reasons why, for certain types of transactions, you need more bytes in an optimistic roll up than in a ZK roll up. And then there's off chain computation costs, which are actually lower for optimistic roll ups than there are for ZK roll ups. So there's complicated trade offs. But my kind of opinion, summing it all up, is that I think in the short term, optimistic roll ups are likely to win for general purpose EVM computation.
00:18:04.882 - 00:19:07.820, Speaker B: ZK roll ups are likely to win for simple payments and some very specific use cases. But I do think that on a five to ten year time horizon, ZK roll ups are going to be winning out in all use cases. So I think the fact that teams like optimism and arbitrum are doing optimistic roll ups today is perfectly fine. And I think it's completely the correct path in order to just get some kind of scaling out for Ethereum in 2021. But there is going to come a time when ZK snark technology improves and ZK snarks are capable of moving, actually verifying EVM computation. Now, expect to see demos of ZK snarks doing things like verifying solid decode this year. But just keep in mind that there's a big difference between a demo and a production implementation, right? Because once you have a demo.
00:19:10.290 - 00:19:10.606, Speaker C: You.
00:19:10.628 - 00:20:12.414, Speaker B: Have to security audit it, you have to debug it, you have to really make sure that the verifier is correct. And those things are hard, right? Like, I personally would much rather trust $10 million of my own money to an EVM optimistic roll up than to an EVM ZK roll up for at least the next couple of years. But in the long term, ZK roll ups, I think are going to be everything. And so my advice to teams like optimism and arbitrum is that I think they should start kind of zkifying themselves fairly soon. It's not so urgent that people should lose interest in projects that are optimistic roll ups today. But I think projects that are optimistic roll ups today should have the attitude that they are not going to be optimistic roll ups forever and they should start putting together their strategies for ZK themselves. So then I talk kind of more.
00:20:12.452 - 00:20:36.470, Speaker C: Technically about if I could cut in here. Vitalik, I would just like to clarify one thing between optimistic rollups and ZK roll ups. What would you say is the defining characteristic difference between optimistic and ZK rollups that makes you long term belief in ZK rollups? What's the real separation between those two things that makes you optimistic about ZK rollups long term?
00:20:36.810 - 00:21:42.702, Speaker B: Sure. So one is just ZK roll ups have instant withdrawals, even and without any collateral requirements. Another is that ZK roll ups do not have this kind of one of n online requirements in order for someone to be able to publish a fraud proof. And that's valuable because it opens the door for ZK roll ups to be able to go up and process things like tens of thousands of transactions per second, where in an optimistic roll up, once you start having that many transactions, then it starts becoming less obvious that there will always be enough honest to nodes that are checking that all the computations are done correctly, also the data efficiency. So I have a table a bit further below where I look at the mixer example, and it's one table further below it. There it is. Right.
00:21:42.702 - 00:22:28.474, Speaker B: And the mixer only has a 77 x scalability gain in an optimistic roll up, but a 570 x scaling gain in a ZK roll up. And the reason why this is true is because ZK roll ups allow you to have lesser data on chain. Because in a ZK roll up you only need to have enough data on chain to update the state tree, whereas in an optimistic roll up you have to have enough data on chain to verify the full computation, which is a slightly larger amount of data. Now to be very clear. Right. I don't think that these advantages are decisive in 2021. And I think in 2021, optimistic roll ups and ZK roll ups are both totally fine.
00:22:28.474 - 00:23:22.330, Speaker B: We're going to have these withdrawal markets. We're going to have ways for people to withdraw from things like optimism and arbitrum instantly. And in 2021 and 2022 and even going a bit further. The fact that optimistic roll ups just rely on clean EVM verification and they have surprisingly simple fraud proof verifiers I think is a decisive advantage, as opposed to ZK roll ups, which needs to have just like this much larger and complicated compiler code to convert solidity or viper or EVm into arithmetic representations. And there's just much more attack service for bugs in there. But over the longer time horizon, those issues will get resolved and the calculus is slowly going to shift toward the ZK side.
00:23:22.480 - 00:23:49.982, Speaker C: So I like to take a stab at trying to go through the history of this to lead into my next question. Ethereum l two scaling started with state channels, which were. And the great thing about state channels is that it's just between two parties. You can make any number of transactions without committing anything to the blockchain. And then to wrap up your day, you commit something to the blockchain. That state channel ends, and then you bundle up 10,000 plus transactions into just one little packet of data, submit it to the blockchain. That's great.
00:23:49.982 - 00:24:48.118, Speaker C: That's great. For two parties, or just a low number of parties, plasma was an attempt to have one to many or many to many type of interactions of various types. And there are different constructions of plasma that did different things, but it ended up being weak because of this thing called this data availability problem, which in short, is that it's hard for Ethereum, the blockchain, to know about the plasma l two chains, and know about how to manage that without making assumptions and assumptions. We don't like assumptions in the world of cryptography. That's not how we play in the world of crypto economics. We like things to be secure. And then, so then that turned into the roll ups revolution of the optimistic and ZK flavor, where there was a compromise made, where we figured out we could actually just regularly submit some data to the Ethereum blockchain to solve that data availability problem.
00:24:48.118 - 00:25:19.730, Speaker C: And so we aren't getting like millions of transactions per second. We are still generally bottlenecked, but the actual bottlenecks are actually still pretty wide, and there's lots of optimizations there that can make them even wider. And that's kind of where we are today. How do we know that we are towards the end of this research and development process? How do we know in 2021 and 2022 we're not going to come up with this new scaling system? What indications or evidence do we have that we have approached the end of this research and development phase?
00:25:21.190 - 00:26:34.842, Speaker B: That's hard to tell for certain. There's no theorem that says that these are the only scaling mechanisms that exist and there are no others. But I think there are kind of heuristic arguments that suggest this one of them is just the Lindy argument, right? Like, we've had channels and plasma and roll ups and basically nothing else for something like four years now. Roll ups themselves, like I said, in their current form, they were kind of created in 2018 to 2019, but there was this much earlier thing of shadow chains that I published back in 2014 that kind of is a prelude to roll ups. So we've had a kind of long and growing time span within which we've known about these three techniques, and we've seen no others. Another thing that arguments that you can make is this mathematical arguments that basically says, if there are end users, how much data gets published on chain, not taking into account deposits and withdrawals and fraud, and you can classify them very easily, right? In a channel, the answer is zero. In a plasma, the answer is o of one.
00:26:34.842 - 00:27:34.414, Speaker B: So just the one merkel root, regardless of how many uses there are. And in a roll up, it's o of n, right? So there's a bit of data per transaction. And so that basically covers the space. Right. Now you might say, well, are there things between one and n? Are there things that are like square root or like logarithm or some weird thing in between? And I think my intuitive answer there is just probably not, because that just means that eventually you have less than one bit on chain per transaction, and how much can you actually do with that? But intuitively, it just feels like those three numbers, like zero, one, and just kind of COVID the whole range. And you can tell how with increasing on chain load, you have increasing capability, right? Like plasma gives you increasing capability from channels. The particular thing being just the ability to send off chain to new users who have not yet been inducted into the system.
00:27:34.414 - 00:27:55.650, Speaker B: And then going from one to n, you have this other gain of capability, which is being able to go general purpose. So there is that kind of heuristic, intuitive reason to potentially believe that these three options just are the options out there, and that everything we're going to see from here is just like, different permutations on that.
00:27:55.800 - 00:28:52.946, Speaker D: Gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange. I've been a customer of Gemini since I first got back into crypto back in 2017, and it has been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells. Gemini is available in all 50 states, in over 50 countries worldwide, and on Gemini, there are markets for over 30 various crypto assets, including many of the hot DFI tokens like Wifi, Ave, Uni and also they are one of the few exchanges that has liquid dai markets. Having both the option of logging into the Gemini.com website or instead opening the Gemini mobile app has allowed me to be able to access any and all exchange and on or off ramp services that I've needed to on a moment's notice. With instant deposits and fast withdrawals, I'm able to make my money do the things I want it to, when I want it to. You can buy crypto safely and securely on Gemini with the peace of mind of knowing that your investments are insured and protected.

GoBankless and if you trade more than $100 within the first 30 days after sign up, you'll be gifted a free $15 bonus. Check them out Gemini.com gobankless Ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on Ethereum and just recently released Ave version two, which has a ton of cool new features that makes using Ave even more powerful. With Ave, you can leverage the full power of DFI money, legos, yield and composability all in one application. On Ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield, and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol. If you have deposited collateral here, you can see me getting a 200 USDC loan against my portfolio of a number of different DFI tokens and ETH.
00:29:48.562 - 00:30:19.842, Speaker D: I'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option, but I could choose the stable interest rate option if I wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently. One of Ave's v two features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets, trade them on uniswap, and then deposit them back into Ave. Ave does all of this for you, all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them. Check out the power of ave@ave.com. That's aave.com.
00:30:19.896 - 00:31:21.080, Speaker A: Roll ups are definitely very exciting. What's also exciting is we can begin using them now, right? So this is no longer hypothetical theoretical like loop ring has one in production. Synthetics just released their version on optimism, so it's going to be very exciting to see how both the optimistic roll ups and the ZK roll ups play out. I had one other question for you, and then maybe we could move on to social recovery wallets. But just last question. On roll ups, how does ETH two kind of, just to tie this out, how does the ETH two roadmap fit with the roll up roadmap? I understand that e two is going to provide a way to provide consensus on a sharded data layer, which is going to make more space, more sort of bandwidth, I guess, for roll ups in the future. What's that going to look like, and what's that going to do for Ethereum's holistic scalability story here?
00:31:22.170 - 00:32:22.982, Speaker B: Great question. It's definitely very important to kind of circle back and answer this one, basically. So we have this thing called the roll up centric roadmap, which basically says that in the short term we recognize that there is massive fee pressure, and roll ups are the only thing that can relieve the fee pressure no matter what we do. And at the same time we recognize that for sharding, providing sharding of just data. So just having sharded blocks that just contain these blobs where you might have whatever data you want, but there's no kind of on chain processing of it is an easier problem to solve than sharded computation. And so if you take those two facts together, the thing that you realize is basically that, well, what do roll ups need? Roll ups need data. And what's the scalability limit of a roll up? The scalability element of roll up is basically, well, how much data space is there that the chain has a consensus on? And with the current ethereum chain, that limit is somewhere around 500 block.
00:32:22.982 - 00:33:20.060, Speaker B: But with the sharded system, you basically have like 500 each of these 64 blocks in every slot, right? So there's just going to be this much larger amount of space, and within that space you can use that to potentially go up to something like 100,000 transactions per second just with roll ups. Right? And I have some numbers. I definitely encourage people reading the post. It's also on Vitalik, CA, and I talk about some of the tricks that we use for data compression and some of the math that shows how many bytes you need for a transaction of different types and how much scaling gain you can get on a regular roll up or on a roll up on ETH one, and then multiply that by another 64 to get the scaling gains for roll ups on e two.
00:33:21.250 - 00:33:35.550, Speaker A: And just to clarify here, Vitalik, so this sharded data layer, is this going to be available to use for roll ups before the ETH one and ETH two merger.
00:33:36.950 - 00:33:54.518, Speaker B: It can be. There is work that needs to be done for that to happen. Basically, we need an ETH two light client inside of ETH one, and that technically requires some eips on ETh one to be done, which I think are in the pipeline, I believe, for soon after Berlin or something like that.
00:33:54.684 - 00:33:55.398, Speaker A: Got it.
00:33:55.484 - 00:33:56.166, Speaker B: Cool.
00:33:56.348 - 00:34:09.206, Speaker A: All right, well, excellent. This has been a fantastic article. So, of course, an incomplete guide to roll ups. I didn't feel like that was incomplete. What about you, David? I felt like that was a very complete guide to roll ups.
00:34:09.318 - 00:34:09.882, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:34:10.016 - 00:34:11.294, Speaker A: At least for me, maybe.
00:34:11.332 - 00:34:14.990, Speaker C: That's a good question. Vitalik, what would a complete guide to roll ups.
00:34:17.810 - 00:35:08.990, Speaker B: One thing I say is that the guide is already so one of the tables. Line four, general purpose EVM roll ups are already close to Mainnet. Well, as of now, the optimism roll up already is on main net, at least for synthetics. So that's progress. And I think this is just evolving technology, and people are going to come up with new and more clever tricks. I wrote this blog post with the goal of it being something that people can kind of go back to and just get their just primer on what the heck? Roll ups are even for years into the future. So I expect there to be more and more things that end up just inevitably not being part of the post, but that continue improving roll up users experience.
00:35:09.140 - 00:35:19.786, Speaker A: As always. Want to end with this. None of this was financial advice. Of course. ETH is risky, so is Defi, so is crypto. You could lose what you put in. But we are headed west.
00:35:19.786 - 00:35:27.010, Speaker A: This is the frontier. It's not for everyone. But we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot. Bye.
