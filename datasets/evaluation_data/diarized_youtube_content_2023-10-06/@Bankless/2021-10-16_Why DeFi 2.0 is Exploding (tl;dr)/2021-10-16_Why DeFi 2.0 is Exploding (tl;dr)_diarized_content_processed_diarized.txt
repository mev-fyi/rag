00:00:00.250 - 00:00:43.386, Speaker A: What's DFI 20? Where are the best yields in crypto? And how do you catch a vibe? All this and more on I'm Luke and this is TLDR, where we catch you up on all the important narratives and headlines from around Bangladesh this week. As always, they're gonna be linked down in the show notes so you can do a deeper dive into any of these topics. So before we start, I want to shout out our sponsor, Pool together, which just announced pool together v four. The no loss DFI lottery has just leveled up by merging all the pools together into one big prize pot and the pool together. Treasury has allocated $1 million to the prize pools to celebrate the new launch. Dive into the pool at Bankless CC. Pool together.
00:00:43.386 - 00:01:15.834, Speaker A: So Rune Christensen, the founder of Makerdao, came on the podcast this week to explore two big statements he's made over the last couple weeks. The first is a technical case for maximalism. The TLDR is that over a long time horizon, only one layer, one blockchain, can survive. It seems impossible to bridge your assets from one layer, one to another, in a trustless way, and that kind of defeats the whole purpose of all of this. So this ties into the protocol sync thesis, where resources will gravitate towards and orbit around the most decentralized, credibly neutral protocol.
00:01:15.902 - 00:02:17.650, Speaker B: If you just think coming from the perspective of I'm going to make a blockchain, I'm going to enable defi, I'm going to make sort of blockchain business, blockchain, economic ecosystem and all these things, right? The number one thing you're always thinking about is if you're trying to optimize for a good blockchain, a good environment for people to build, the main thing people care about, which is why they're using DeFi and why they're using blockchain, is interconnectedness, essentially, right? Like this interoperability, this synergy, permissionless innovation money layer goes, this is kind of the entire value proposition, right? So there has to be a really compelling reason to sort of deliberately exclude that, which then becomes this sort of this l one narrative, essentially, right? Which is this idea that you can be a self sovereign, dominant blockchain, essentially, that can have its own ecosystem.
00:02:17.730 - 00:02:53.614, Speaker A: The other part of this conversation covers the environment. And that was also the topic of market Monday this week. Fixing climate change. We talk all the time about programming our values into our money, and it's time to put that to the test. Rune argues that we can and should be making dye into clean money, accepting collateral and prioritizing investments that demonstrate an alignment with sustainability. For a community like Makerdao, which has solidified its spot in DeFi, it seems ripe to begin pursuing the greater good for projects in general. I think a good rule of thumb is that first comes growth and then comes purpose.
00:02:53.614 - 00:03:33.674, Speaker A: While the more OG protocols are solidifying their place and seeking purpose, a new crop of DFI projects are exploding into their growth phase. Recently termed DFI 20, this new class of primitive seems to be emerging with some shared attributes, like an emphasis on openness and dows. Really DFI native, really composable and also risky. On State of the nation this week we had Jay, the co founder of Rari Capital. On Rari Capital is one of these DFI 2.0 projects, and we covered it in an article last week. But basically, Rari is a protocol for money markets, so that's lending and borrowing on any DFI asset.
00:03:33.674 - 00:03:39.586, Speaker A: During the episode, Rari actually crossed 1 billion in total value locked, which was really exciting to me.
00:03:39.608 - 00:04:11.020, Speaker C: This whole zoomer Phi DFI 20 phenomenon is really just that we have these risk averse protocols, we have this risk averse foundation, and what would Rari be if it didn't really already have assets like Dai or other money markets out there, right? So it actually is the time towards leaning in towards some of these riskier ventures, because as of just a few minutes ago, Rari Capital crossed a billion dollars locked in DeFi. So you know that something is.
00:04:13.630 - 00:04:17.578, Speaker D: Showing on the screen. David, do you have some sound effects for this? This is pretty momentum.
00:04:17.594 - 00:04:34.398, Speaker C: Oh gosh, I don't think I do. Oh no, it's only music. It's only music. I don't have the right sound effects, but jay, congratulations, my man, on crashing a billion dollars in DeFi. So clearly the strategy is working out. How does it feel to have a billion dollars in the smart contracts?
00:04:34.574 - 00:04:35.410, Speaker E: Scary.
00:04:37.990 - 00:04:40.142, Speaker D: Good answer after we just discussed risk.
00:04:40.206 - 00:05:12.874, Speaker A: The riskiness of DFI 2.0, however, is not to be slept on. And a massive liquidation event hit the Olympus dow pool on Rari earlier this week. This sector is an experiment, but these platforms have seen tremendous growth. While the traditional defi blue chips have certainly been much quieter, an increasingly loud space in crypto have been daos. But for the amount of energy and hype surrounding daos, the tooling and infrastructure is quite primitive. The business model and internal structures are also brand new and experimental.
00:05:12.874 - 00:05:56.606, Speaker A: Our resident frogmonkey argues how the next unlock for Daos is decentralizing capital flows. So the idea is that not everything runs through a treasury department or a centralized hub of resources. Instead, you distribute out those resources to a set of interconnected nodes and let the power of a network take over. And suddenly you turn from a more centralized linear flow of capital to a decentralized web of relationships. And what you're seeing here happening in real time is Metcalf's law. The more connections you have in a network, the resilience and efficiency of that network increase at an exponential rate. So crypto gaming is here, but it's also still definitely on its way.
00:05:56.606 - 00:06:06.014, Speaker A: This newer sector is exploding. So we brought on some key community members from axie, infinity and alluvium to talk about where we are and where crypto gaming is headed.
00:06:06.062 - 00:06:33.738, Speaker E: So here's the way I take a look at it. Defi is the gamification of finance. Gamefi is the financialization of games. These are actually no different. You're just coming at it from kind of the opposite ends. And when you combine them, what you have is basically play to earn. And the metaverse, where if you watch ready player one, people own their assets across different game experience, buying these assets and owning them and then taking them basically to their whole virtual lives with them.
00:06:33.738 - 00:06:37.350, Speaker E: So I think they're just opposite ends of the same outcome.
00:06:37.430 - 00:07:22.826, Speaker A: What I liked most about this conversation is how positive some it feels. This doesn't feel like a competitive environment. The core builders in this space just want to see an entire economy built out and flourishing. The passion here is not about making the most successful game at the expense of users and at the expense of competition. It's about shifting the paradigm, creating a world where the lines are blurred between gamers and developers, where earning and owning are real things in the digital world, removing boundaries and incentivizing growth and collaboration. Other emerging sectors are nfts and scaling, and both of these are happening in parallel. Layer one Ethereum will increasingly become a hub for bundles of transactions instead of individual ones.
00:07:22.826 - 00:08:05.298, Speaker A: So your nfts will likely live on L2s down the line. And it's worth learning about how to get ahead of the curve and figuring out how nfts work on L2s. This feels like a fractal of the idea of modular blockchains, which we've been talking a ton about lately. The idea here is that we separate out different layers on the blockchain for different purposes. We have the consensus, or security layer on layer one, Ethereum mainnet, and then we use rollups to build out the user aggregation front end layer. This week we also covered where to find the best yields in Defi, things like curve and yearn, Mstable and Barnbridge. Oh, but where are the hottest yields in Defi? Well, not gonna make it, Luke.
00:08:05.298 - 00:08:27.226, Speaker A: Defi's hottest yields are. Wait, but I didn't catch any of that. Oh, turns out, gotta be a premium subscriber for the hottest yields in Defi. But I don't want to be a premium subscriber. Well, not gonna make it, Luke. Looks like you're not gonna make it. Subscribe to Bankless, get the best yields.
00:08:27.226 - 00:09:14.186, Speaker A: I don't make the rules. And finally, on layer zero this week, we had on Metacartel core member Peter Pan. And if you remember, Peter Pan wrote the before bitcoin series, which David can't get through without crying, so it's probably worth a read. And this conversation covered a lot more, going through his journey into crypto and being an early pioneer of the Dao space. When it boils down to it, a dow is basically just a vibe. Dows introduce a lot of complexity into an organization, and it's honestly much easier to understand what's going on if you just try to catch the vibe rather than, I don't know, analyzing a hierarchy chart or going through a bulleted list. And with vibes, instead of having a list of rules or some objective rundown or bureaucratic small print, you just have a feeling.
00:09:14.186 - 00:10:00.918, Speaker A: Vibes encompass work, play, culture, incentives, and compress them into a type of shared knowledge, a harmony between those sharing the vibe. A vibe is an understanding, and although you can try to talk about it and try to define it eventually, a vibe is something that is unspoken, deep, subjective, and internalized. Vibes are a good way to conceptualize the complicated nature of dows. Instead of trying to learn every detail, read every word of a white paper, every interaction, just learn the vibe. Learn the principles. And when you are coasting on top of this vibe, you can start doing some pretty cool things. So with that, I want to quickly shout out our sponsors, matcha, Alchemyx, Ledger, and Arbitrum.
00:10:00.918 - 00:10:17.630, Speaker A: Vibes are being built on top of these projects, and also, this video wouldn't be possible without them. So thanks a lot. And finally, none of this is financial advice. Eth is risky. Defi is risky. Are vibes risky? I don't know, but we are headed west. This is the frontier.
00:10:17.630 - 00:10:22.866, Speaker A: It's not for everyone. But we are glad you are with us on the bankless journey. See you next time.
