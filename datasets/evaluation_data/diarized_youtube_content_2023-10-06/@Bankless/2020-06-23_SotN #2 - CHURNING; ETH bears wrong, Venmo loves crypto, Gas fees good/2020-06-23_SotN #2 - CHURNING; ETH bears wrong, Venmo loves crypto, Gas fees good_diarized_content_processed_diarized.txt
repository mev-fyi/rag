00:00:00.510 - 00:00:32.310, Speaker A: You welcome to a June 23 edition, our second episode of State of the Nation. We are glad you are with us. So here's what we do in these episodes. We talk about what's going on in crypto, and we relate that stuff to the big picture to help you understand the state of the bankless nation. So we release these episodes right here on YouTube every Tuesday. Make sure you subscribe. And then we also release them on the Bankless podcast on Wednesdays.
00:00:32.310 - 00:00:42.560, Speaker A: And here's the question I always start out with. I'm going to relay this one to David. David, what is the state of the bankless nation today? Sir?
00:00:42.930 - 00:01:07.398, Speaker B: The state of the bankless nation is churning. We are churning at the moment. Last week, the state of the nation was bullish. I said that DFI tokens had really gone up a lot in price, and that was illustrative of a catalyst of all of Ethereum. And then ether started pumping a little pump from 229 to 243, where we are today. So I feel pretty validated about this one.
00:01:07.564 - 00:01:25.574, Speaker A: Totally called it. You just nailed it. Comp tokens did. Like, after you, after you said that, after we gave the state of the nation, they did like a three to five x after that, after you said it was bullish. Do you think state of the nation had any effect on the comp pump? David Hoffman.
00:01:25.622 - 00:01:29.526, Speaker B: Oh, one to one. One to one. It wouldn't have happened otherwise.
00:01:29.638 - 00:01:34.314, Speaker A: Yeah, that was my thought, too. Okay, so churning. So why are we churning?
00:01:34.442 - 00:01:56.280, Speaker B: Okay, so we had that bullish week. Prices have gone up. People are all talking about yield, yield farming, liquidity. Farming, like bat is being borrowed. And then relent. Tether is just flooding into compound all of a sudden. All of Defi, all Ethereum is like, tether is cool now we're okay with it.
00:01:56.280 - 00:02:18.630, Speaker B: It's real. It's here to stay. So our mental models are now integrating tether. Our mental model capitulated. Yeah, it's a real thing. There's a lot of both. Churn with asset prices, but also churn with mental models like the comp governance token and the SAFG.
00:02:18.630 - 00:02:29.710, Speaker B: The simple agreement for future governance is like this brand new paradigm that we're all trying to integrate into our brains. There's a lot of change going on, changes in the air. So things are. Yeah.
00:02:29.860 - 00:02:49.480, Speaker A: And I guess one question for you. So last week I wrote an article and I published it Monday. And I said, stocks are drunk, but DFI is sober. Right? And then we had that crazy week last week where it looks like DFI might be drunk too. Is it drunk? Is this going to cause problems for us later?
00:02:50.090 - 00:03:07.734, Speaker B: Well, I mean, if we're comparing what 2017 was to being drunk and what we are today, DFI is just a little bust. It's been sober for a very long time, and it's just really sensitive right now because it hasn't had a drink in years. Okay, so it had a small drink and now it's a little buzed.
00:03:07.782 - 00:03:15.198, Speaker A: Okay. So its alcohol tolerance is low due to abstinence, and it's just a little buz right now, but feels good, though.
00:03:15.364 - 00:03:16.250, Speaker B: We like the buzz.
00:03:16.330 - 00:03:41.638, Speaker A: We had a good week. It was a good week. Now, I think the big question on everyone's mind is what's going on with ETH? Like ETH the asset. Right? So we see dFI tokens pump like crazy. I mean, you comped maybe an eight x last week. It's down a little bit from that. Ave two is up in the hundreds of percentage points, synthetics as well, from last week.
00:03:41.638 - 00:04:16.306, Speaker A: But ETH is not following. So ETH has been pretty flat, honestly. It's been hovering around this price point of like 230 ish just recently had a small bump, but we're talking mere percentage points. That was different. Like in 2017 in the ICO wave, that was a killer use case, a killer app for Ethereum. It was decentralized funding of the protocol, and the price of ETH just went insane. Is that not going to happen in this case? Is ETh just going to kind of languish and fall by the wayside while defi moons? Right?
00:04:16.328 - 00:05:01.374, Speaker B: So, like, all these defi tokens, like comp, like Ave, and now even profits, the cash flows generated by these systems are becoming less and less ETH denominated, right? So there's cash flows coming from tether, which is definitely not ETH denominated. There's cash flows from Dai, which is only limited ETH denominated. And we're seeing the backing of dai become less and less eth over time. So, like the bears are saying, eTH is losing its supremacy over Defi tokens. And the value of comp, the value of aave, is coming from other cash flows, not just ETH denominated. And so that is something to integrate into our brains. The ETH isn't the one true asset of Ethereum.
00:05:01.374 - 00:05:20.050, Speaker B: Right? Like, there are other assets that the valuations of these defi tokens gain their value from. We have to remember that ever since, basically now, very recently, all of Makerdao was ETH, all of compound collateral was ETH, and it was just because there weren't other assets on Ethereum.
00:05:20.130 - 00:05:20.326, Speaker A: Right.
00:05:20.348 - 00:05:53.202, Speaker B: It was just a matter of just like, what other assets are there on Ethereum other than ETH, which was basically none. But at the same time, we've seen ETH in compound absolutely skyrocket. We've seen ETH in Defi, just suck up EtH. And so it's also sucking up other assets, too. But also ETH primarily is being sucked up by Defi. And so there's going to be this constant tug of war for a while between the bulls and bears saying, defi doesn't need etH. And then the bulls are saying, well, yeah, but it's still using it.
00:05:53.202 - 00:06:17.260, Speaker B: It doesn't need it, but it's still using all. Another thing to point out is defi isn't correlated to bitcoin, btC, but ether is. And so Ether's got this tug of war between being correlated to bitcoin and being correlated to defi. Defi has mooned, bitcoin has not. And so ether, like, stuck in the.
00:06:18.030 - 00:06:41.438, Speaker A: You know, I should pull this up. Pull up this graph from Defi pulse for everyone who's watching. This is total value locked, denominated in USD, in Defi. And you can see the total value locked has absolutely skyrocketed, given sort of the DFi tokens, adding rocket fuel to.
00:06:41.444 - 00:06:45.666, Speaker B: That 1 billion to 1.5 billion in what looks like two weeks.
00:06:45.768 - 00:07:04.706, Speaker A: That's insane. And if you go, by the way, let me just show comp really quick. If you go to comp specifically, this is the compound protocol that just launched the comp token that we talked about on the last day of the nation. Look at this chart. Wow. Right? Yeah. 100 million or so locked.
00:07:04.706 - 00:07:05.286, Speaker A: Right.
00:07:05.388 - 00:07:08.138, Speaker B: In all assets. 100 million, right.
00:07:08.224 - 00:07:30.634, Speaker A: All assets. Pretty flat, to be honest. And then they issue comp tokens and they juice the returns, basically. And we're up to 600 million now. 600 million. That's a six x leap in terms of the capital inside of this protocol. And we talked to Dan Elitzer about this in our episode that we released yesterday.
00:07:30.634 - 00:07:45.094, Speaker A: This is not free money that's being generated. Some people are saying, like, comp printer, go burr. Right. As if this is just money coming out of thin air. It's not really. You're pulling it from future expectations of the compound protocol. Right.
00:07:45.094 - 00:08:11.870, Speaker A: And you're bringing those expectations into the present and in the future. Investors, apparently, if they're rational anyway, they're expecting comp to generate a return as a capital asset. And that's why they're valuing it the way they are, it's juicing returns. But here's back to ETH. If we look at ETH locked in compound, this is just ETH denominated, locked in compound. Look at that. Look at that pump.
00:08:12.290 - 00:08:38.198, Speaker B: That is too good. Yeah. So compound now is just under a million. It was a million ETH yesterday, which makes us having two applications on Ethereum that has 1 million eth locked in it, and there's like 110, 115,000,000 ETH out there in total. How many more of these do we need before a meaningful amount of ETH is locked up? That you can't argue with.
00:08:38.284 - 00:09:10.960, Speaker A: Yeah, totally. I mean, it goes to. What you're saying is, I don't think the bears, like the bears are right, that there are now other money assets on Ethereum that are competing with ETH. But what they don't understand is that the success of DeFi, like, what's good for DeFi is also good for ETH. And you're seeing it right in the charts because that's increasing the total amount of ETH locked. But, like, here's the question. Why hasn't this borne out? Why hasn't this flown into ETH price yet? Right? So the bears would say, that's because you're wrong, guys.
00:09:10.960 - 00:09:36.262, Speaker A: These two things are not related. I think the bulls would say, just be patient. It's been seven days, right? These are market cycles. We've come off of a two year Ethereum winter where ETH lost 95% of its value. This is what Amazon lost in 2001 when the.com bubble burst. Right.
00:09:36.262 - 00:09:56.238, Speaker A: 95% of its value in this winter. And investors are skittish. People are afraid. People still are using, like, they're looking backwards at a world where it was just bitcoin maximalism, and that was the only money. And they're not looking at ETH as a monetary asset. Is that the reason? Why? Are we just in a cycle? David, what do you think?
00:09:56.324 - 00:10:22.614, Speaker B: Yeah. Markets have memory inside of them. Right? And the DFI market has much less of a memory than the ETH market does. And the ETH market has, like, fear and skepticalness baked into it, because we went from 1400 down to 80, and now we're at two whatever. And at the same time, we have gone up a little bit east, did run up a little bit. 229 to 243. Still not much.
00:10:22.614 - 00:10:55.310, Speaker B: Could have been noise, could have been uncorrelated. However, it did lead first bitcoin. It started moving first sooner than bitcoin did, and it was going up, and then bitcoin dumped and it pulled down eth with it. So like, ETH moved first and then bitcoin also moved upwards after ETH started moving upwards. And then bitcoin dumped a little bit and it killed the momentum of ETH. And so I really think know Defi is pumping and it's trying to bring eth with it. But bitcoin is holding ether back because ether and bitcoin are so strongly correlated.
00:10:55.470 - 00:11:02.222, Speaker A: It seems that way. You know, the other thing I'm seeing is a narrative shift. Can you see my screen right here, David?
00:11:02.366 - 00:11:02.674, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:11:02.712 - 00:11:40.062, Speaker A: Uh huh. All right, so this was an excerpt, I'm not going to share the full email. An excerpt of an email I received yesterday from a fund manager guy I know, runs a decently small to mid sized crypto hedge fund. He's got some other content in this, but the money line was this. My fund was 60% bitcoin until recently. Now we're 80% ETH and DFI. The time has come, in my opinion, is what he said above that he said basically the previous cycle he's been allocated bitcoin, but nothing's happening in bitcoin right now.
00:11:40.062 - 00:12:26.254, Speaker A: All of the action, all of the activity is happening in the Defi Ethereum space. And bitcoin maximalists are going to get left behind and maybe they'll be a bit salty as a result of getting left behind. I don't know for sure if he's right, but I do know that I've seen a lot of places where sentiment has seemingly of our, one of our friends. Hopefully he's coming on the podcast, right, Chris? Chris Berninski tweeted this. He said, if you think Defi will have a smaller impact on Ethan icos, you aren't paying attention. Defi will flex Ethereum's ability to perform all in bold, all financial services. This is early stage capital formation, is what he said.
00:12:26.254 - 00:12:38.498, Speaker A: Are you starting to see the early signs of a narrative shift? The thawing of the Ethereum winter, and people are like coming back to ETh as an asset. Do you think we're getting closer to that?
00:12:38.664 - 00:13:15.690, Speaker B: Yeah, 100%. And it's just because it's coming in so many different directions. Right? Like you have your money verbs, icon, and Ethereum is just knocking them down one by one. Like, got that one, got that one, got that one. And also, I think the biggest narrative shift is the seemingly one way movement of bitcoin onto Ethereum, right? Because it just goes to show that people that own bitcoin, bitcoiners or not want to do things that do verbs with their money. And you just can't do that on bitcoin, at least not in a custodial fashion.
00:13:15.770 - 00:13:36.390, Speaker A: Okay, so take that though. So some people say bitcoin on Ethereum is actually tokenized bitcoin is actually bullish bitcoin because they want to use the better money, which is bitcoin, even on the Ethereum network. And so bitcoin, tokenized bitcoin on ethereum will cannibalize the moneyness of ETH as an asset. What say you?
00:13:36.540 - 00:14:17.202, Speaker B: Well, it is bullish bitcoin, but it's not bullish necessarily. Bitcoin versus ether. Right? It's good value for bitcoin. I'm really happy that bitcoin can do some of these things that it can do. Like you can generate a loan, a permissionless loan inside of makerdao with your bitcoin, and then ether is its own thing, right? And so sure there's going to be some displacement of sorts in the same way that tether is also displacing ETH and other assets will ultimately displace eth. But this isn't a zero sum game, right? Like ether is going to go up, especially because all economic activity ends up feeding into ETH. But just being proximate to each other is always going to be good.
00:14:17.202 - 00:14:30.040, Speaker B: And so we can talk about how bitcoin may be cannibalizing ETH, but it's only going to do it to a small degree, and it's really going to just push the fold as to why Ether and Ethereum are important.
00:14:30.730 - 00:15:00.930, Speaker A: Yeah, it's hard to replace ETH as trustless economic bandwidth. I know we've both talked about this and written about it. We will include some articles and references to you if you want to understand the concept of trustless economic bandwidth. We'll include that in the show notes. One last thing we should maybe touch on before we leave this topic of why ETH might be getting left behind, but why I think both of us are still bullish ETH, and that's this. Nexo finance. So this is a crypto bank.
00:15:00.930 - 00:15:36.954, Speaker A: Just last week, people linked some of their ethereum transactions to putting in USDT, so they're putting assets in the compound protocol. So this is a crypto bank depositing close to $30 million. There were a few transactions here into the DFI protocol comp. You know what this is? This is the great protocol sync thesis that we've been talking about, right? I mean, it is. We talked about in that episode. We did on the protocol sync thesis, we said look for signs of it. This is it.
00:15:36.954 - 00:15:59.154, Speaker A: This is what it looks like. You're seeing a crypto bank actively depositing funds. Is it customer funds? I'm not sure where these funds are. Okay, so they're depositing funds into the compound protocol. Right. So they wouldn't do that. They wouldn't deposit funds into a protocol that coinbase is spinning up, or one of their competitors, like crypto.com,
00:15:59.154 - 00:16:22.698, Speaker A: but they are inside this credibly neutral lending and borrowing protocol. That's how the DeFi protocols slip underneath the crypto banks. And there's the potential here, David, that crypto banks and other capital pools like them might actually be the primary consumers of DeFi protocols. If we're right, if the protocol sync plays out the way we think it's going to.
00:16:22.784 - 00:16:32.218, Speaker B: And there's two things I want to bring up with this. One, Nexo finance. This gives Nexo finance an edge because it's getting a return that other crypto banks aren't.
00:16:32.314 - 00:16:32.862, Speaker A: Right? Yes.
00:16:32.916 - 00:16:42.546, Speaker B: And so that's good for Nexo. It's also making compound a better protocol at the same time, because the more capital and liquidity inside of compound, the better.
00:16:42.648 - 00:16:42.914, Speaker A: Right.
00:16:42.952 - 00:17:20.606, Speaker B: So this is mutually beneficial for both Nexo and compound, and it's going to start to force the hands of every other crypto bank because Nexo has this edge that they also have available to them, so they need to start using it. And so all these crypto banks are going to start. And we've seen such a strong level of competition with crypto banks. Like, you need to iterate and improve faster, really fast. So I think this is going to come really quickly. And the thing is, it all converges upon the same protocols. Compound, makerdao Ave, dydx, perhaps, is even one.
00:17:20.606 - 00:17:50.706, Speaker B: And so all these many crypto banks are going to converge upon the same DeFi protocols. And all those same DeFi protocols, their primary collateral is eth. In my article, Ethereum is an emergent structure. I had this section where I claimed, like, ethereum is the epicenter. Ether is the epicenter of Ethereum. It's the capital of the Ethereum state, right? So any application that uses some sort of crypto bank, it lands upon ether, ultimately, like, all roads lead to ether.
00:17:50.898 - 00:18:18.940, Speaker A: Yeah, totally. I totally agree. And it's exciting to watch the protocol sync play out a little bit. We'll include some information about the protocol sync thesis in the show notes. There's at least a bankless episode you got to write an article, David, like one of us does. I wrote this little snippet of an article, but we need something meaty because I think the protocol sync thesis is really what's going to drive the success of Defi and has already driven the success of bitcoin and ETH as assets. So the people need an article, my friend.
00:18:19.390 - 00:18:27.986, Speaker B: Yeah, no, you're totally right. I need to pound that one out now that we have already been talking about it so much. We've already done a podcast episode on it. Should be pretty easy. Yeah, it should be. I'll bang it out.
00:18:28.008 - 00:18:58.278, Speaker A: All right, before we go any further, we want to talk about the sponsors that make this show possible. The first is ramp. I'm really excited about ramp because they are a crypto fiat gateway. So the problem with a lot of DFI applications is that most users, 99% of new users, are not going to have ETH or crypto in their account. So they can't even complete an Ethereum transaction. Ramp solves that in like five minutes. They can get crypto to a wallet.
00:18:58.278 - 00:19:17.234, Speaker A: So the key thing here is if you're a DFI app developer, you want to check out how to integrate ramp inside of your defi app and you're just going to explode growth. That's how we address the total addressable market for DeFi as we make fiat on Ramps super easy. We'll include info on ramp in the show.
00:19:17.272 - 00:20:10.450, Speaker B: Notes part of the protocol sync thesis is that all these worldwide companies and businesses are going to ultimately use applications on Ethereum. And one way that this is playing out is through monolith. Monolith uses the visa network to generate a payment network. But instead of using dollars in your bank account, it uses Dai in a smart contract wallet. So using that dense protocol, Dai and Makerdao, and a smart contract wallet on Ethereum, you can top up your wallet with Dai and then go to your local coffee shop, your local whatever, your local grocery store, swipe your visa card, and make a transaction that settles on Ethereum using Dai. So this is a great tool to live a bankless life, to break up with your bank and still be able to access a normal life that is relatively indistinguishable from people that are perhaps not as far along in the bankless nation as you are.
00:20:10.600 - 00:20:14.082, Speaker A: Are you saying we should break up with our banks but not be weirdos? Right.
00:20:14.216 - 00:20:27.114, Speaker B: Break up with your banks but still be a normal person. Yeah. You don't necessarily have to be a complete revolutionary. You can check them out at monolith XYZ to get your bankless visa card today?
00:20:27.312 - 00:20:52.882, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. We are very practical on the bankless revolution. Breaking up with your bank is a process. It's less like a clean breakup and more like growing apart, is how I think about it. You start using your bank account less and less and networks like ethereum become more and more valuable for you. That's the journey we're on. It's been true in, I think, our daily living, so we expect it to be true in the future.
00:20:52.882 - 00:21:26.890, Speaker A: But speaking of bull markets, you said churning, right? PayPal and Venmo. An article came out this week that PayPal and Venmo are getting ready to add a buy crypto feature. I got to think they're certainly going to enable buying bitcoin, right, because square did that. But ether can't be far behind because it is also the only crypto asset that is CFTC deemed. They're an important regulatory body in the US. They've deemed them a commodity. No other asset has that distinction.
00:21:26.890 - 00:21:42.046, Speaker A: What do you think this is going to do once this is added? Are we going to see more people onboarded? Are your neighbors and friends and family and start asking you about how they buy ripple? I hope not.
00:21:42.228 - 00:22:16.570, Speaker B: God, if they list ripple, I will throw a fit. This is just part of the normalization of crypto, right? Bitcoiners would call this hyper bitcoinization. And if PayPal only added bitcoin, that would probably fit well into that narrative. However, the reason why cash app only has bitcoin is because cash is run by Jack Dorsey. And Jack Dorsey is very idealistic and holds bitcoin in a more supreme position than other assets. PayPal doesn't have such biases or leanings. Right.
00:22:16.570 - 00:22:20.170, Speaker B: They are primarily focused on generating revenue.
00:22:20.990 - 00:22:24.234, Speaker A: They're going to one up square. Right, more than bitcoin.
00:22:24.282 - 00:22:39.966, Speaker B: Yeah. They're going to have to force Square's hands, too. So you're totally right. It's probably going to be bitcoin and ether. And then I bet a stablecoin, probably USDC. It would be fantastic if they did Dai, but Dai doesn't have the same volume as USDC. So I bet those are the three assets that are coming and I bet right out the gate.
00:22:39.966 - 00:23:16.266, Speaker B: This doesn't really do much, but again, it forces the normalization of crypto. And this is part of the settlement the protocol sync thesis. Right. Like all companies, like legacy or not, will ultimately use crypto because crypto in itself, regardless of the apps on in crypto, crypto is a dense protocol. And so it's going to find its way into banks like PayPal, or banks like Wells Fargo or whatever. And so this is that playing out. And PayPal, every single person, not every single person, but a lot of people have a PayPal account, especially millennials.
00:23:16.266 - 00:23:33.250, Speaker B: Right? Especially young people. And it's also in Venmo. Like, it's also going to be an app on your phone that you already have KYC'd with, you've already submitted your id. Be wary of that, by the way. And it's already going to be a tool that you have to instantly buy crypto and send it into the Ethereum economy.
00:23:33.830 - 00:24:21.938, Speaker A: Yeah, I think this is really. So this is how millennials, and certainly Gen Z, pays for things, right? We're even beyond PayPal. It's just Venmo. If you're buying, selling anything from anybody who's under the age of, like, 35, it's going to be on Venmo. And providing a gateway, an in app gateway to purchase crypto is really important, I think, for this generation to get into it. I saw this tweet earlier this week about millennials having basically no money in terms of wealth as compared to previous generations. So if you compare boomers to millennials, boomers at the age of 29 or 39, and now you have to remember the oldest millennial now is 39, which is, like, crazy to me.
00:24:21.938 - 00:25:08.178, Speaker A: But boomers had 21% share of the wealth when they were 39 when the first boomer hit 39. Millennials have 3% of the total us wealth now that they're at the age 39. So this generation, the millennial generation, is not doing better from a wealth perspective than our parents were. And to me, I think we make the mistake a little bit as, like, millennials, in looking for the nation state to solve all of these things, because the nation state is not necessarily equipped to solve these things. The nation state is in a process of being squeezed. That's what the last 30 years, at least in the US, have been. It's been a squeezing process.
00:25:08.178 - 00:25:41.758, Speaker A: And right now, with all the money printing you're seeing, it's a squeezing process of the US dollar as reserve currency status, something that the US essentially has worked for over generations. It's being squeezed out right now. I think the big opportunities for millennials are actually going to be in these digital nation states, as we call them, like Ethereum and bitcoin. So having a gateway to those digital nations in apps that are easy to use and that we already use, is pretty important, at least to me. And I do think these younger generations will be all about that, and I hope they are.
00:25:41.924 - 00:26:51.486, Speaker B: And we've already seen the demand for this sort of activity from millennials, right? From the Robin Hood rally, right? People are taking their one $200 like Covid, check their Trump bucks, throwing it right into Robin Hood and buying Hertz as it goes bankrupt, because they know that this sort of GDP growth that came to the boomers is not coming to them, right? I think in a similar stat, like GDP growth during the boomers, when they were from 20 to 35 was like 34%, and millennials, it's been 11%. And so we have seen one third of the growth in GDP in our best years, in our best professional years than boomers have, right? And so what that's doing is millennials are like, well, fuck it. I'm not going to get a high paying job because robots are going to automate my job away. So I'm throwing all my money into Robinhood because this is this gambling app. So at least I have some chance of generating some sort of wealth for myself. And that's because there's risk there. And there's also risk in Defi.
00:26:51.486 - 00:27:04.178, Speaker B: There's also risk in crypto. There's also Risk in Ethereum. But this is like real risk, not just fake. Hertz is going to the moon because they're going bankrupt. Risk, this is real value measure.
00:27:04.354 - 00:27:08.934, Speaker A: There's no fed backing up crypto, right? There's no bailouts coming for us, right?
00:27:08.972 - 00:27:22.310, Speaker B: No wild millennials have this risk appetite, right? Because they are looking for greener pastures. And in my mind, there is no greener pasture than crypto, especially defi, especially decentralized finance.
00:27:22.390 - 00:27:59.110, Speaker A: Well, because Ethereum, you've said it before, ethereum is an entire economy, right? It really is. It's like going out west and settling, right? People on the east coast who were comfortable in their positions and secure and fine with the status quo, those weren't the ones traveling west in search of golden opportunity. It was the people who are looking for another chance, looking for an opportunity outside of the existing constructs of the system. And that's really where I do think the opportunity is there. It's not GDP growth in the US, it's GDP growth in the Ethereum economy.
00:27:59.850 - 00:28:10.234, Speaker B: Also, to add on to that metaphor, people went west to escape the tyranny of the state. They wanted to be free. That was also a real thing. So that is a direct one to one comparison.
00:28:10.362 - 00:28:39.800, Speaker A: Yeah, so I love that analogy. David, before we go any further, we should talk again about our sponsors. So I'm super excited about Maltes. So they've decided to sponsor bankless on the show and they are really providing a bankless business account. So they've released a new edition of their application. This is like a bank user interface, but underneath it's all Ethereum and Defi protocols. And we're going to be releasing a video on the channel about that too.
00:28:39.800 - 00:28:58.940, Speaker A: And I plan to convert some of my business activity to Maltis and give it a try. And you should too. It is like a bankless bank account where you can operate your entire business on Defi, on Ethereum. Super powerful stuff. We'll include more info in the show notes for you to check out.
00:29:00.130 - 00:29:46.790, Speaker B: Another great application on Ethereum, which we talk a lot about is Aave. Aave is a borrowing and lending application. You can supply assets, you can borrow assets, you can get an interest rate or you can pay an interest rate. But what's different about Ave is that aave will give you stable interest rate payments, a really important tool to build out this DFI economy. This economy on Ethereum, if you are pulling out a loan, you need to have some assurances that the interest rate on that loan isn't going to jump up to like 20% or something crazy, which we have seen before in DFI. So you can get that sort of stability and long term thinking using Ave. They also have a tokens which are representations of the assets deposited in their protocol, which has the interest baked into the tokens.
00:29:46.790 - 00:29:57.840, Speaker B: So you can use those to transact while also receiving interest rates, interest payments at the same time. Check them out. They're a fantastic protocol. Check them out@ave.com.
00:29:58.210 - 00:30:14.450, Speaker A: David, one more thing we should talk about, and we're trying to keep the show a little bit. We tend to go on for a while. So we've got one more topic. We're excited. We're excited about this stuff, guys. So you got to forgive us. We're going to try to keep this to 30 ish minutes, but I think we might be close to that now.
00:30:14.450 - 00:30:34.474, Speaker A: Anyway, let's talk about gas. All right, so gas prices are too damn high. You agree or disagree? Like, here's the gas price right now. I'm sharing it. This is ETh gas station, a fantastic site. So again, gas is required for every ethereum transaction. And gas prices go up and down.
00:30:34.474 - 00:30:48.026, Speaker A: Right now they're fairly expensive. I remember a time not long ago when it cost two guay to send a transaction. Now it's 46. It's been like 46 to 70 for a while. Is this a good thing or a bad thing for Ethereum.
00:30:48.138 - 00:30:54.880, Speaker B: So I think actually the very correct answer is it is a thing.
00:30:56.930 - 00:30:58.340, Speaker A: You're dodging the question.
00:30:59.350 - 00:31:27.930, Speaker B: It is both good and bad. And to what degree it is good also generates some equal and opposite amount of badness. And so here's what I mean by this. The high gas prices on Ethereum represent, are correlated to the potential returns that you can get on Ethereum, right? If there are high returns on Ethereum, there's going to be high economic activity and there's going to be high demand for block space. Also, fees are good for the long term health of the network. In this new digital nation world. Fees represent taxes.
00:31:27.930 - 00:32:16.890, Speaker B: Taxes are the thing that fund the economy, right? They secure the Ethereum economy. So when we see high gas fees, we can safely rest assure that the Ethereum economy is going to exist a long time into the future, because that's where revenue for security comes from. At the same time, it's bad, right? Because high fees price people out. And this is the main concern that the Ethereum side of things has versus the bitcoin side of things, right? If we have an inflexible block space and extremely flexible block space demand, what you get is really high fees and it ultimately forces the small guy out and only allows the large capital holders in who can afford those fees. So that's bad. We don't want that. And that's why Ethereum has always committed to scale.
00:32:16.890 - 00:32:21.930, Speaker B: And so it's pros and cons. There's pros and cons.
00:32:22.080 - 00:32:54.994, Speaker A: It's good and bad, as you say. It does seem to be the case. Look, there's always going to be limits to the amount of block space available. It's a scarce, and it does, we talked about this with Nick Carter. It does seem like high density economic transactions. By that I mean like the big ones, the high value ones are going to be the ones that are prioritized because those transactions are the only ones that will essentially be able to afford these kinds of fees. And the lower value transactions will move to layer twos, to side chains, maybe even to crypto banks.
00:32:54.994 - 00:33:05.098, Speaker A: So even though Ethereum is scaling, there's still a limit, the amount of transaction space in the ethereum network, and there always will be, right?
00:33:05.264 - 00:33:29.150, Speaker B: Absolutely. Yeah. But I would say if you forced me into a corner and made me answer this question, I would say it's a good thing because the alternative is having 1 Gy fees or two gray fees. And that makes us look like a ghost chain. And so at the end of the day we do have to do this deal with a devil and ask for high fees because that means our chain is useful. That means our chain is in demand. And I would prefer that to low fees.
00:33:29.230 - 00:33:46.662, Speaker A: There's a lot of ghost chains out there, a lot of ghost cities. In fact, almost all of them are. Go look at the transaction fees. We'll put this in the show notes. Go look at the transaction fees of dash or Ethereum classic or bitcoin cash or XRP. It's nothing. If you're looking at this chart.
00:33:46.662 - 00:34:03.646, Speaker A: Okay, so this chart is bitcoin in red and ether in purple, right? These are the daily transaction fee revenue. Okay, so let me just click in XRP. Let's see XRP way down here.
00:34:03.748 - 00:34:07.390, Speaker B: And this is a log scale graph, right? Yeah.
00:34:07.460 - 00:34:09.210, Speaker A: $95 a day, baby.
00:34:09.290 - 00:34:12.510, Speaker B: 95 smackers for the whole XRP network.
00:34:12.670 - 00:34:17.870, Speaker A: That's how much they're making in transaction fees. I don't even know who's paying that, but it seems overpriced.
00:34:18.030 - 00:34:18.740, Speaker B: But.
00:34:20.470 - 00:34:30.822, Speaker A: Ether now is five hundred and forty k per day. And over the past two weeks, 14 days, it's actually been higher than bitcoin. So bitcoin right now is three, two.
00:34:30.876 - 00:34:34.326, Speaker B: K. This is the highest it's ever been over bitcoin for this long amount of time.
00:34:34.428 - 00:34:57.354, Speaker A: The last time it was, was in 2018, the last 14 day window. But if it goes another week, it probably will be the longest time. Transaction fees on ether. So what that means is block space on Ethereum is more valuable currently than blocks based on bitcoin, right? That's what that means. It doesn't mean the asset is more valuable. Right. Bitcoin, the asset is worth more than ether, the asset.
00:34:57.354 - 00:35:02.158, Speaker A: But it does mean the Ethereum block space is worth more, which is.
00:35:02.324 - 00:35:06.638, Speaker B: Let's do some eth killers. Will you click in Ada and BNB?
00:35:06.734 - 00:35:08.766, Speaker A: Are you just trying to embarrass these guys, dude?
00:35:08.878 - 00:35:09.634, Speaker B: A little bit.
00:35:09.752 - 00:35:11.506, Speaker A: They're never going to sponsor us now.
00:35:11.608 - 00:35:20.386, Speaker B: Oh, no. Oh, wow. Oh, look, Cardano is beating litecoin. Hey, Cardano, flip into litecoin. All right, let's do BNB right below Ada.
00:35:20.578 - 00:35:22.114, Speaker A: Wait, what is Binance?
00:35:22.162 - 00:35:22.706, Speaker B: Binance chain?
00:35:22.738 - 00:35:27.754, Speaker A: Well, this is the whole binance casino. It's got that going for.
00:35:27.792 - 00:35:30.140, Speaker B: Oh, they have over a thousand.
00:35:30.670 - 00:35:31.130, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:35:31.200 - 00:35:36.314, Speaker B: Binance has over a $1,000 in daily transaction fees right on the board.
00:35:36.512 - 00:35:40.134, Speaker A: On the board, yeah. I mean, we could like litecoin.
00:35:40.182 - 00:35:41.260, Speaker B: Oh, don't do it.
00:35:44.910 - 00:36:02.098, Speaker A: No one cares about. No one's willing to pay for block. And look, there was a time look at this. There was a time when no one cared about Ethereum either, right? Let's be honest. Look back 2016, no one cared. No one cared. And then they started to care because DFI got its first use case January 2017.
00:36:02.098 - 00:36:38.800, Speaker A: And then they really started to care, right? And now Ethereum block space has been consistently valuable up until about that time, and it's seeing a resurgence in its value. So it's interesting to watch. We don't have time to talk about all of the implications. There's a whole discussion we could have, David, about fixed issuance in your monetary policy and how that is supplemented by transaction fees and how bitcoin is essentially moving to a network that is all transaction fee revenue driven from a security perspective. But we won't today because I think we're getting up to time.
00:36:39.410 - 00:37:02.130, Speaker B: I would like to plug Anthony Cesano's recent newsletter, the Daily Guay, where he broke down what the miners are doing about these high fees. They're increasing the block size limit. And so if you guys want, we can't go into it because it's a really nuanced conversation with lots of things to talk about. And Anthony does a great job of breaking it down there. So I would definitely recommend that a read if you are interested in this subject.
00:37:02.210 - 00:37:09.198, Speaker A: Oh, Anthony. I subscribe. It's good. He does it every day. Yeah. So check this out. Daily quait.
00:37:09.198 - 00:37:39.666, Speaker A: We'll put that as an action item. Other action items, actually. So as long as you're looking at things, subscribing to things. We released the bankless guide on Saturday. The bankless Guide is basically the best of the best that we have published so far in bankless on the newsletter. And it's created in a format to help go through the goals, the resources you need for the journey, how to understand core concepts and the key skills, and then lastly, where to get help. So you got to check this out.
00:37:39.666 - 00:37:51.734, Speaker A: People have really loved it and that would be another action item. David, do you have any other action items in this churning state? You called it? Yeah. What else should we be doing?
00:37:51.932 - 00:38:18.958, Speaker B: I would definitely say the easiest ones are subscribe to the YouTube. Give us those likes. We are trying to get this bankless gospel onto the front page of the crypto YouTube, so that is really important. Also, if you have not subscribed to the podcast as well, where Ryan and I just peel back the layers of the most complicated topics, as well as bring on some of the smartest guests in this crypto world, we have a fantastic lineup coming over the next month. So stay tuned for all of that.
00:38:19.044 - 00:38:21.118, Speaker A: Ankle is hitting some all time highs too, right?
00:38:21.204 - 00:38:21.770, Speaker B: Oh, yeah.
00:38:21.860 - 00:38:36.418, Speaker A: And we hit our 1000th YouTube subscriber just got a notification of that. Podcast is fantastic. Yeah, this morning. Yeah, podcast is going up, too. So thanks for all the support, guys. We really appreciate it. That's what makes State of the nation possible.
00:38:36.584 - 00:38:43.726, Speaker B: So it makes me think that we're on the cusp of a bull run because everyone wants to hear about all the great craziness that's going on in Ethereum and DFI.
00:38:43.838 - 00:39:04.298, Speaker A: Absolutely, guys. That's it. So we're coming at you every Tuesday, state of the nation on YouTube. Give us feedback, tell us what you like about the show. Tell us what you don't like. We're also pushing this out on the podcast on Wednesdays, so if you prefer not to see our faces when we're talking, you can take a listen on Wednesdays. That's it from us.
00:39:04.298 - 00:39:07.880, Speaker A: The state of the nation is churning. Thanks, guys.
