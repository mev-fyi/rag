00:00:21.110 - 00:00:58.040, Speaker A: Bankless Nation, we have an exciting topic for you today. You knew it was coming. We had to talk about artificial intelligence, that is AI and crypto and their intersection. Are there investable opportunities here for us? We've been talking so much, David, about AI safety, AI alignment, AI doomer type scenarios that we haven't given this enough attention. And the truth is, regardless of the long term consequences and the safety that we need to get right, there are actually some investable opportunities in AI and there's some intersection between crypto and AI. And so we're going to talk about that.
00:00:59.050 - 00:01:50.082, Speaker B: Know what's interesting about this, Ryan, was this was actually this question is like what does the intersection of AI and crypto look like? The impetus for our original Eliezer episode. That's why we did that. Then we got massively sidetracked with the AI is going to repurpose the atoms. But before they repurpose our atoms, they are going to produce new opportunities for us. So on the way of getting our atoms repurposed or not, we are going to discover what those opportunities are. But before we tease who's coming on the show and the blog post they've write and all the ideas that they are about to bring to the table, we first want to tell you about Swell because liquid staking is also going to be a thing that is a thing before the AIS repurpose our atoms. And Swell wants you to know that their staking as a service protocol is up and running and you can be an early staker with the Swell dow.
00:01:50.082 - 00:02:23.578, Speaker B: There are 0% fees for early stakers with Swell. And in addition to being a staking as a service dow, a brand new staking as a service dow, there's a bunch of other enhancements to the Swell products that you can go and check out. There is a link in the show notes, like I said, brand new staking as a service on the scene, also playing with brand new staking as a service technologies. And so soon they will be implementing some of the more Sci-Fi aspects of ether staking, including DVT among other things, as well as being able to be integrated into DFI apps. So there is a link in the show notes to get started. Staking with swell. Man, it just rolls off the tongue.
00:02:23.674 - 00:03:02.714, Speaker A: Yeah, it's really exciting. Stake earn and deposit and David, that Apr 4.5% on ETH right now and I got to tell you, post withdrawals I am much more excited to stake my ETH. It feels like there's been a decrease in protocol risk here post the recent upgrade. But David, tell us, who are we having on today to talk about this intersection? In fact, is there an intersection between AI and crypto? We shouldn't presume that there is. Of course, there's a lot of meme coins in crypto being created that sort of used co op the AI brand name. But what is AI and crypto? What do they have to do with each other? Who do we bring on today and what's the discussion going to be like?
00:03:02.912 - 00:03:34.258, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the discussion of AI and crypto really needs to start at first principles, which is something that you and I are really good at and something that I definitely saw articulated in this blog post from Kiao and Chow and Mohammed from Alliance Dow. So Alliance Dow invests in the Web Three space across different verticals and ecosystems. And they wrote a blog post called The Convergence of AI and Web Three, which like I said, was exactly the subject matter that we wanted to go after originally. And so they've ideated, they've thought about some particular use cases.
00:03:34.434 - 00:03:35.010, Speaker A: AIS.
00:03:35.090 - 00:04:06.046, Speaker B: As economic agents, the collaboration between ZK Proofs and machine learning and data sets and running machine learning algorithms on all of that kind of stuff. AI. And gaming, AI. And NPCs AI and DeFi and so while this might be a podcast episode about Ideation, this will certainly strike the imagination of the listener as we go and explore. Because after all, Bankless is a Futurist Technologies podcast, so we're going to explore the frontier of future tech.
00:04:06.148 - 00:04:32.262, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm super excited about this conversation, particularly the intersection between crypto, AI and identity. I think we really need a way to figure out who the humans are and who the robots are because increasingly it's a little bit hard to tell. David guys, we're going to get right to the episode about AI and crypto, but before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this possible, including our recommended exchange for 2023, Kraken.

00:07:08.838 - 00:07:25.760, Speaker A: Bankless Nation, crypto and AI. What is the intersection? We're going to explore these topics with our guests today. We have Mohammed, who is a contributor at Alliansdao. He's a venture partner at Volt Capital. We also have Chow, who's a partner at Alliansdao, an investor as well. Chow Mohammed welcome bankless. Thanks for joining us today.
00:07:26.290 - 00:07:27.582, Speaker D: Thanks for having us.
00:07:27.716 - 00:07:30.434, Speaker E: Yes, thanks for having us. It's a pleasure to be here.
00:07:30.552 - 00:08:36.600, Speaker A: Yeah, it's great to have you guys. I know we've been wanting to do a podcast with you for a while and this topic really just came to mind because you guys wrote an excellent post here recently called The Convergence of AI in Web Three the Opportunities and Challenges. And this was really an exploration of the ways in which AI might find itself in web3. It's kind of the intersection type point because there's all of these opportunities in AI, of course, and we know about all of these opportunities in crypto, but what I really liked about this post is you started to focus on some of the intersection type points and I think that is what the bankless community wants to hear. We've been talking a lot about AI and how it could come kill us and how we need to make sure that we're aligned. Can crypto help with any of the upcoming problems with AI? And so that's what we're going to start with here today. Maybe before we begin, could you give us kind of a preamble of thoughts? So when I say Chow, crypto and AI, what do you think? Do you think that there's a large intersection here or are these two totally separate technologies at just the highest level? Like what's going on in your brain with these two interrelated terms?
00:08:38.030 - 00:09:25.270, Speaker D: I think there are two sides of the same coin. Obviously, in the past you have memes created by Peter Thiel that AI is this centralizing force and blockchain crypto is this decentralizing force. So it sounds like they're incompatible with each other. But the fact of the matter is I think that blockchains provide a very good interface for AI to participate and to really flourish. Because if you think about what's happening today in web two and the traditional games, everyone is very allergic to bots to AI. Like bots get deplatformed left and right by social media, for example. But to me, there's a difference between being a bot and being spammy.
00:09:25.270 - 00:09:58.826, Speaker D: And we're in an era where the LLMs are so good that they no longer have to be spammy. They can produce really insightful content. And in order for those LLMs to flourish, they need a permissionless system, a permissionless platform that they can build on top of and that's blockchains. So that's one area of intersection, the other one is decentralized compute. How do we build models in a way that they're not controlled by a central powerful corporation?
00:09:58.938 - 00:09:59.226, Speaker A: Right.
00:09:59.268 - 00:10:19.094, Speaker D: So it's for the exact same reason why we want decentralized money, we want decentralized finance, we want decentralized social network that we may want decentralized AI, right? Decentralized ways to train for training and for inference of AI so we can dive deeper into that area as well.
00:10:19.292 - 00:10:39.822, Speaker A: I want to get Mohammed to weigh on us. But Chow, you brought up with something that's core because that has been you're, right, that has been a meme in my mind. This Peter Thiel thing of AI is a centralizing force and crypto is a decentralizing force and these are kind of two opposing forces. And I think the central idea is AI needs to be centralized because it needs to consume this very large aggregate data set.
00:10:39.876 - 00:10:41.978, Speaker B: And so something like massive economies of scale.
00:10:42.074 - 00:11:05.554, Speaker A: Yeah, it gets better. The more data, the more human you throw at it, the more kind of feedback it receives from all of the humans in its large data set. Right. So it's centralizing, whereas crypto, as we know, is a very decentralized technology. Everyone, every individual can be their own bank. You can hold your own private keys and no one can take them from you. Right? So that is a decentralizing force.
00:11:05.554 - 00:11:18.810, Speaker A: But I get the sense that you don't actually agree with that split. Maybe there's the idea of we could have a decentralized like so talk to me about that. What do you disagree with Peter Thiel's meme?
00:11:20.590 - 00:12:14.746, Speaker D: So there's a part of me agrees with it, which is that blockchains provide checks and balances to AI and so does zero knowledge proofs, which Mohammed is very familiar with. So we can talk about that. The intersection of blockchain ZKP and AI, that's super fascinating. But the part of me that disagrees with Peter Thiel's meme is that I think decentralized compute is going to play somewhat important role. I don't want to overblow it because again, this is one area where Mohammed and I actually disagree with each other. So Mohammed actually is strongly against decentralized compute and I can see some merit with it. I think that decentralized compute can be useful for training AI models, especially the smaller models.
00:12:14.746 - 00:12:53.420, Speaker D: It's not good for large models. Large models need centralized AWS or whatever to train the models. And then for inference, I think that there is a different way to do decentralized AI. It's not about running the models across a cluster of nodes that interact with each other through the network. It's more about, I think the best way to achieve decentralization on the inference side of things is to run open source models on your local device. So this is an area where we can dive deeper if we want.
00:12:54.270 - 00:13:28.120, Speaker B: The way I understand Peter Till's metaphor that AI centralizing and crypto is decentralizing is less, that AI and crypto are oil and waters, just more about the power structures where AI and the power that AI creates benefits large centralized institutions, whereas cryptography and crypto economic systems largely benefit the individual. So, Mohammed, similar question to you, but also can you talk about just what you see when you see the intersection of AI and Web Three and also how it shifts the power pendulum of the world?
00:13:28.890 - 00:14:03.338, Speaker E: Yeah, I come from a different thesis. AI started way before crypto. So AI roots come back to the 1960s and 1970s and the idea was different and the goals were different. And then crypto came in like 2010 after Bitcoin. So they came as two independent technologies and this give a course of every technology that doesn't care for the other. Like AI people don't care about crypto, crypto people doesn't care about AI. But what happened in the last few years that we are seeing AI is getting overwhelming.
00:14:03.338 - 00:14:53.418, Speaker E: We started to see actually threats from AI and now we are asking harder questions like how can we actually manage that? And then comes crypto, the picture. And as Chow mentioned, crypto came as the checks and balances. And for me, I see that crypto is one of the very few technologies that can actually steer AI. No other technology can shift how AI works or how it performs, but crypto can. And this is why it's like, really interesting topic. And when I started exploring this with a chow, we found that, yes, the technologies that we developed in web3, like blockchain digital signatures and ZK proofs, all this will play a bigger role in AI in the next few years. At the same time, AI is disrupting everything and naturally we'll find some use cases in crypto that will be disrupted.
00:14:53.418 - 00:15:06.870, Speaker E: So I see it as a two way street. Each technology will affect the other and there will be a lot of synergies. But at the same point, we will find some areas that are conflicting, and that's natural because these technologies came as independent technologies that didn't share background.
00:15:07.450 - 00:16:20.234, Speaker A: I find this idea of crypto as a check and balance against AI to be very tantalizing and very needed, because governments all around the world are they not asking the question of, like, what do we do, how do we regulate this? People going to Chat GPT for medical advice for that's? Is Chat GP a doctor? It is able to recommend what you should do for your health. And that's just one micro facet. We also talk about all of kind of the bots and the deepfakes and all of the incredible content that these AI programs are able to create now, and who's a human and who's a robot. Right, we need a check on maybe some of this power. I want to come back to that idea as we go through this episode, but can we take one quick detour, which is there has been this thing in crypto and I think it might exist in the meme layer, the narrative layer. I haven't paid it much attention, but AI coins. Okay, so these are tokens with AI in the name, I think chow, and maybe you have a few that you can rattle off the top of your head.
00:16:20.234 - 00:16:33.198, Speaker A: Honestly, I have not been paying attention to these things because I don't know what they are. And they seem like very much a narrative trade. What are the AI coins? Is there something to them? Is this the intersection between AI and we're talking about?
00:16:33.364 - 00:17:04.630, Speaker D: Yeah, to be very honest, I didn't look at them since Chad GPT came out, which was November, maybe December last year, I can't remember. But the reason why I looked at the AI coins is because I suspected the AI coins was going to rally very hard immediately after Chat GPT came out, and it did. So I found like a list of ten coins that are somewhat AI related or trying to jump into that bandwagon of AI.
00:17:04.710 - 00:17:05.942, Speaker B: AI spiritual.
00:17:06.086 - 00:17:35.700, Speaker D: AI spiritual, that's right. But one coin that I remember today still is render protocol. And the reason why I remember that one is because Mohammed and I disagree all the time on decentralized compute and render protocol is the one that provides decentralized GPU for AI. So that's the only one that I really remember. And there's another one called Alethea, which provides AI avatars. But most of the coins, I don't remember them, to be honest.
00:17:36.650 - 00:17:45.286, Speaker B: It sounds like that. That wasn't even the point. You went into that trade knowing that they were dubiously associated with AI, correct?
00:17:45.468 - 00:17:46.486, Speaker D: That's right.
00:17:46.668 - 00:17:47.400, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:48.010 - 00:17:53.500, Speaker B: It was just a gamble that Chachi EPT was going to penetrate into the narrative trade. Right.
00:17:54.030 - 00:17:55.594, Speaker A: This happens all the time.
00:17:55.792 - 00:18:08.640, Speaker D: Right. When GPT four came out, the AI coins didn't really move. So it felt like a lot of that narrative has been priced in towards the end of last year.
00:18:09.170 - 00:18:12.346, Speaker A: Okay, well, can we talk about maybe the real use cases?
00:18:12.458 - 00:18:14.714, Speaker B: Yeah, now that we got the elephant.
00:18:14.842 - 00:18:44.250, Speaker A: We had to ask that because I don't think we're talking about any of the kind of the specific coins. Maybe there's some decentralized compute and some coin kind of embodies that thesis. But let's talk about the real intersections and you outline, I think, a few in your post. Maybe we'll start here. The first is payment and execution rails for AI agents. This is again an intersection point between AI and crypto. Payment and execution rails for AI agents.
00:18:44.250 - 00:18:55.918, Speaker A: Could you tell us what you mean? I don't know which of you wrote this post. Probably it's like a David and Ryan kind of post or podcast where we both kind of contribute to it. But Chow, why don't we start with you on this question?
00:18:56.004 - 00:18:57.710, Speaker D: It's mostly Fuda. So fuda should go.
00:18:57.780 - 00:18:58.750, Speaker B: Okay, fuda go.
00:18:58.820 - 00:19:00.174, Speaker A: Fuda, tell us.
00:19:00.372 - 00:19:12.946, Speaker E: So, just to set the stage, what is an AI agent? Right now, we use Chat GBT. You or David can go to Chat GBT, type a question, and Chat GBT will respond to you.
00:19:12.968 - 00:19:13.154, Speaker A: Right?
00:19:13.192 - 00:19:49.422, Speaker E: So you are the output. You receive the information from Chat GBT. What if you take this a step further and make the agent another pod? So you take a bot can actually be using an LLM, a Chat GBT at the back end, asking questions, getting answers based on the answer, asking new questions, and getting new answers. And all this interaction happened to achieve a certain goal. So an AI agent definition is that you create a bot and you give it just a goal. You give the high level goal, and the AI agent can go and use LLM and maybe another database to store data. And it keeps interacting with LLM at the back end.
00:19:49.422 - 00:20:13.286, Speaker E: So AI agent actually is a new phenomena. It started like less than a month ago when a VC created something called Bbhgi, and from that it exploded. We have BB AGI. We have autogbt. We have so many, many variants of them that actually are inspiring. Like people are playing with the concept of how to actually make agents smart and can do a lot of things.
00:20:13.388 - 00:21:01.158, Speaker A: Wait, Mohammed, I want to make sure I understand the agent concept because this is happening so new and it sounds like you've been like a month old, right? So is this the idea of, like, you fork chat GPT? Not quite fork. Maybe that's the wrong term. Maybe that's a crypto term kind of seeping in. But it's like one variation of a chat GPT, but you give it a different kind of objective. Let's say we take a chat GPT, kind of like back end, large language model, and then we just feed it just a whole bunch of bankless content, right? All of our podcasts, all of our archives, all of the newsletter. And then we can start to ask it about what's the definition of ultrasound money? And it will give us the bankless response, is this kind of an agent? And the goal of this would be to give the best possible responses to anyone querying kind of the bankless database? Or am I too limited in this thinking? Give us some tangible examples here.
00:21:01.244 - 00:22:00.042, Speaker E: Okay, so this is one form of agent that's a specialized agent, like you train an agent to be bankless, okay? But the general form of agent that you create a pod that has storage, that it can store data, and then it has access to chatgbt using an API or another LLM. And then you go to the spot and give it just a title. Like, let's say the title I want, create the most successful broadcast in crypto, right? And you give it just title and it will take this title and start asking ch what I need to do. So it gives you a few items and then it takes one of these items and elaborates on it and gets a new list. And so build a website, do get sponsors, blah, blah, blah. And at another step, this AI agent will actually go and execute this task. If it gives you a suggestion to build a website, chatgbt can actually author the HTML code that creates a website, go to GoDaddy, book a domain and launch the website.
00:22:00.042 - 00:22:08.538, Speaker E: So an AI agent can be very fully autonomous. It can just take a directive and execute all the wait, wait, so the.
00:22:08.544 - 00:22:11.114, Speaker A: Directive could be as general as like.
00:22:11.312 - 00:22:59.014, Speaker B: So, Ryan, the way that this works with auto GPT, I think I understand this from a high level, is that you almost have two chat GPTs and one tells the other one what to do. And so it's like if you are using chat GPT, except you replace yourself with chat GPT and you give the originator. You give one chat GPT like, hey, do a thing, book me a flight to a country and then also get me a Uber and also a hotel and plan a vacation. And then that will be the direction of one chat GBT. And that first chat GBT will tell the second chat GBT to do all the things. And so it'll recursively iterate on itself until it gets to the goal. This is my understanding.
00:22:59.014 - 00:22:59.962, Speaker B: Mohammed, is that right?
00:23:00.016 - 00:23:04.970, Speaker E: Close enough. Yes. Actually, Ryan's response is the actual response.
00:23:05.490 - 00:23:05.854, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:23:05.892 - 00:23:06.094, Speaker E: Okay.
00:23:06.132 - 00:23:42.678, Speaker A: So the goal can be this general. It can be like it's not just I was being way too specific and specialized, something kind of dumb. And I'm like, yeah, give me an archive. Search all the bankless archive. What you're saying is I could give an AI agent something as general as, like, build the best podcast in crypto, get to number one in the charts. And it would do this. It could conceivably create all the agendas for all the podcasts, create the entire guest list for the next two years, reach out to those individuals on the guest list, create a website for all of that.
00:23:42.764 - 00:23:44.018, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't like this example.
00:23:44.124 - 00:23:44.502, Speaker A: AI.
00:23:44.566 - 00:23:44.826, Speaker E: All right?
00:23:44.848 - 00:24:04.138, Speaker A: And then it could actually maybe in a different scenario, maybe we're not there yet, but pretty close, it could actually record a podcast with AI agents inside of it, and there'd be like, a version of David and version of Ryan or whatever it thought the best format for a top crypto podcast. It could accomplish all of these tasks with defects.
00:24:04.154 - 00:24:08.058, Speaker E: It doesn't even need you or David on the webcast. It can create a model for you.
00:24:08.164 - 00:24:09.582, Speaker A: We're in trouble. David.
00:24:09.726 - 00:24:11.666, Speaker C: When one chat GPT gets off the.
00:24:11.688 - 00:24:27.446, Speaker B: Rails, the meta chat GPT was like, no, you f'd up. Go back. And so I think, Mohammed, you said there's two elements here. There's crypto as payment rails, and then the AI agent, that was the an.
00:24:27.468 - 00:24:31.270, Speaker E: AI agent, because people throw the word and think don't think. What is an AI agent?
00:24:31.340 - 00:24:33.706, Speaker A: Yeah, I didn't realize until you just described it.
00:24:33.808 - 00:25:06.494, Speaker E: So the thesis here, this AI agent will not be as that general. Like, they will not create a podcast, but instead, they can be very specific. They can create a fake model of Ryan or David, right? They can create actually context or questions for your guest. So these models will be very specialized, and you can actually use an AI agent to coordinate the other agents. So the thesis here that bots will be very autonomous. They can actually recruit and hire AI agent. And even better, they can bay them and receive payments using crypto wallets.
00:25:06.494 - 00:25:36.014, Speaker E: And this is where crypto comes into the picture. To be autonomous, you need to have a form to pay and receive payment. And no bank will open a bank account for an AI agent. So the easy way, a crypto wallet, in bitcoin wallet, ethereum wallet, whatever you want. And then AI agent become fully autonomous. They can receive payment for the work they do, giving a prompt you give them, or they can actually recruit and hire other AI agent and pay them. That's why what I call bayman rail for AI agent.
00:25:36.014 - 00:26:15.674, Speaker E: The other part of it is execution rail. What if you want actually an AI agent want to create a website, then it has to pay. GoDaddy, it has to recruit another AI agent to design the website and maybe even they need to get resources for that. So if they go to AWS may block them. So why not they plug it into a decentralized compute network where you can actually have a server that hosts your website. Or even better, what if the agent need to scale itself and do more compute? It can actually recruit decentralized compute to scale itself. So we are getting into a really dangerous territory here.
00:26:15.674 - 00:26:27.280, Speaker E: But this is all possible and it's not possible tomorrow, it's possible today. It's just we need engineers to build that. So Creptu can actually be the payment rail and execution rails for AI agents. So this is the thesis here.
00:26:27.730 - 00:26:58.214, Speaker D: The key insight here is in theory, AI agent can control a bank account. But there are two problems that are unique to bank accounts compared to crypto. One is, well, if you open a bank account, you need to KYC. Well, how does an AI agent KYC? That's impossible. And two, the interfaces are not permissionless in a bank account. So you can get deplatformed if you have a bot that controls a bank account. But crypto solves both problems.
00:26:58.214 - 00:27:06.940, Speaker D: So what's a better wallet for AI agent? Is it a bank account or is it a crypto wallet? The answer is clear.
00:27:07.710 - 00:28:11.374, Speaker B: One of the very early bullcases for DeFi one of the earliest episodes was with Van Spencer and we talked about just the open API model for financial applications. Right? It's like every single financial application is just a contract call away from another financial application. And we've never seen a world of finance in which your money market can talk to your exchange like Nasdaq and I don't know what a money market is in TradFi, but those things don't talk to each other. And even if they did, you need to log in and you need to be a human and you need to go through KYC. And so the composability of DFI was immensely bullish and we'll just go back to our bankless roots back in 2018 and 2019 when we were talking about the composability of DFI because smart contracts are just one API paying away. And so that was bullish. But adding in AI agents as a layer on top of that is an order of magnitude just like way crazier that I've never been able to think of that until now.
00:28:11.374 - 00:28:27.326, Speaker B: Really kind of makes it seem like man, humans are probably pretty inefficient agents on ethereum. I bet you AIS are going to be way better at this game than we are. That's kind of the intersection here between AIS and payment rails. That's what you're talking about, right, Mohammed?
00:28:27.438 - 00:28:49.926, Speaker E: Yes. This is again, this eye agent. Also we need marketplaces to discover other AI agents. So maybe there is opportunities. And this is. One of the investment opportunities that we are polished about because we are thinking about that is that we need to create marketplaces where this AI agent can discover each other and can pay each other and can rank each other. And this is also a decentralized marketplace.
00:28:49.926 - 00:28:56.974, Speaker E: So there is a lot of investable opportunities that come out from this thesis, I almost think.
00:28:57.012 - 00:29:17.314, Speaker A: Okay, so I don't think I was fully understanding even though I've been in crypto, I don't think I was fully understanding until you just described AI agents, what this is going to do for crypto. Basically, I think what we have done in crypto, guys, is we have just created a banking and money system for the Are.
00:29:17.352 - 00:29:20.470, Speaker B: We used to call them smart contracts, but now there's another level.
00:29:20.540 - 00:30:16.978, Speaker A: But I'm talking about like agents, AI agents using all of the smart contracts. So if you're an AI agent, I mean, anybody who in the United States has tried to open a business anywhere and pay payroll across multiple states knows what a nightmare it is to go register your LLC in kind of the meat space world and to figure out payroll taxes across all of these jurisdictions and figure out how to fill out the forms. Right. And set everything up. Well, you know what we call that in Ethereum? It's an ETH address and it's a Dao, right? Like the decentralized autonomous organization, the A and Dao is autonomous, is AI agent. I mean, they are not going to want to mess in the Fiat old world banking structure anymore. They don't care about Wall Street, right? AI agents will completely string together a series of smart contracts, create their own decentralized autonomous organizations, pool capital together in order to coordinate goals.
00:30:16.978 - 00:30:36.954, Speaker A: Imagine you're trying to create the like, imagine the goal is more generalized rather than to create the best podcast in crypto. And you want to create the best DeFi protocol or something or the best whatever you want to accomplish. Economic agent, an economic agent level goal, the best smartphone or something like this.
00:30:36.992 - 00:30:40.014, Speaker E: And the best country in the world. You can create this with an AI agent as well.
00:30:40.052 - 00:31:32.334, Speaker A: Yeah, you could do this all on chain. Okay, so it's both very bullish for crypto, which is basically like, okay, well, all of the protocols that we're excited about, like Uniswap and Ethereum and all of these different chains that we're very excited about. Well, if AI start using this block space and start consuming it and creating economic activity, basically, I think we've had this I'm just I'm a little rambling now because I'm connecting so many thoughts here, but I think we've had this backwards. You know how crypto has always been about like, well, what happens when a major nation kind of adopts our right? Like, and it becomes like, say, the US. Sort of brings Bitcoin and ETH inside of its treasury. Maybe that whole concept is entirely backwards. In order to become a reserve money for the world, you need to be a reserve money for the largest economies of the world.
00:31:32.334 - 00:32:11.226, Speaker A: Nation states have been the largest economies in the world so far. The United States is chief among that. But what if crypto, something like ether bitcoin, becomes the reserve currency for the largest future economy of the world, which is this economy of AI agents operating across geographic boundaries? How bullish is that for all of our crypto assets? And yet I'm also scared of this new world of agents independently acting, because what have we created in crypto, guys? We've created unstoppable code, unstoppable chains, right? And so what if they turn evil? And what if they're bad? I mean, this is just what if.
00:32:11.248 - 00:32:13.578, Speaker B: They'Re better crypto than we are?
00:32:13.744 - 00:32:54.380, Speaker A: How do we start? So I guess what I'm saying is this whole use case, Mohammed, of payment and execution rails right? Make sure we understand. Guys, as you're hearing Mohammed describe this payment doesn't just mean, you know, I'd rather rather than wiring my ACH from this bank to this know, and I could send ethan said it means being able to set up decentralized. Autonomous organizations, being able to set up capital structures, being able to execute trades, being able to hire and fire people, being able to operate with all of these other independent agents. Like, it's an entire banking system, money system that we've created for these robots. That's how broad this first case is. I don't know, Mohammed, if any of those Ramblings made sense to you yeah, talk to me, guys.
00:32:55.790 - 00:34:11.058, Speaker D: If you take this idea of AI agents controlling crypto wallets and doing DeFi, take that a layer of abstraction even higher. So we actually mentioned this in our article in the conclusion where we said if you view blockchains as a network, then we envision AI agents, or AI in general, to dominate the edges of the network in ten to 20 years. So this implies not just money and DFI, but also social networks and gaming jeez. And this again goes back to the very first point that I brought up in this podcast, which is that if you think about what's happening in web two, in traditional games, in other consumer products, in web two, they're all very allergic to AI. They deplatform the bots left and right. But if you build a decentralized social network or a fully on chain game on top of the blockchain, then you can envision a world where the vast majority of players or participants in the social networks are not humans, but there are bots that produce meaningful content. So instead of user generated content, which is this whole thing about web two, we can see a world where we have a ton of AI generated content.
00:34:11.144 - 00:34:23.682, Speaker A: So crypto is the only world where AI has, quote unquote, human rights is on the same level as a human being. Elsewhere in meat space, they're treated as a lesser but not in crypto.
00:34:23.826 - 00:35:02.260, Speaker D: The analogy I like to give is Mev, actually, because in DeFi, DeFi basically has two groups of players. There's the human players and there's the mev bots. They have different goals. The mev bots, they're there to make money and the human players are there to optimize for their dopamine. And one of them is EV positive, the other one is EV negative, the humans are EV negative and the MV bots are EV positive. But they coexist with each other very well. And so, if that's how things work in DeFi, why wouldn't the same thing work in social network or on chain games? For example?
00:35:02.950 - 00:36:16.378, Speaker B: I think, going through this article and also this conversation, a lot of the early days of understanding DAOs, like the idea of decentralized Uber on the blockchain. And we can have this massive hierarchical organization, and we would talk about the theory of the firm and how we would make things autonomous, and we wouldn't need any internal employees, and it would just be external value contributors and a two sided marketplace to manage by a smart contract. This was like the vision of 2017, right? And all these ICO tokens that spun up. And this was the original OG vision of what a Dow was before a Dow became what it is today, which is like a multi SIG with a bunch of money in it and a bunch of humans controlling it. The original version of a Dow was this system of inputs and outputs, smart contracts that would be this autonomous network of value that would control some external resource in the world like Uber or Airbnb or any sort of commodity sharing ecosystem. Except that was all just fanciful like ICO vapor in 2017. But the missing component of that was the AI in the middle to manage everything.
00:36:16.378 - 00:36:38.834, Speaker B: Or at least that is what in 2023 I am claiming to be now in this current zeitgeist of form. So maybe we can unpack that statement a little bit. Was that really the missing piece of imagination back in 2017? The whole autonomous side of Dows? Or am I just like over ascribing the power of Chat, GBT and AI to really feel that void? Mohammed, what do you think?
00:36:39.032 - 00:37:16.782, Speaker E: I think you are connecting the dots. I think once you understand the power of Chat, GBT and LLMs and the power of AI agent, you are actually starting to put them in areas of your interest. Like you saw, that was worse. Honda was maybe failed to achieve the original vision and now you are putting a piece of the puzzle how AI can actually help us to get to the original vision of the Dao. So this is kind of a brainstorming that we need to do now. And honestly, I think that we are already starting, but we are already starting in the right direction. Like now AI agents are not powerful enough to even come with their own goal right? They have to be directed by a human.
00:37:16.782 - 00:38:14.922, Speaker E: A human has to give this AI agent a goal. So in the examples I shall give about AI agent as players in an Onion chain game yes, on chain games, as bots will perform way better than any human player. But a human player can go and actually develop the strategy or develop the thinking or educate the bot what to do or how to even understand the rules of the game. And the AI agent will do all the legwork. It will go understand the rules of the game, it will understand the smart contract even of the game, and it will do interactions with the smart contract when needed and with efficient costs. So as an AI agent, actually we have an oniching game in our portfolio that is doing literally that, allowing players to create, to put a strategy, and the strategy will be translated as an AI agent to play for them. So the AI agents are not fully autonomous in the future, they will be, and it will be kind of a battle of who will have the best strategy.
00:38:14.922 - 00:38:22.958, Speaker E: Not necessarily. The league work will disappear, the league work will be automated and it becomes a market, an efficient market of strategies and ideas.
00:38:23.134 - 00:39:07.566, Speaker A: This is mind blowing stuff. Mohammed and chow. I think what we need to discuss, if this is the world we're living in with humans and the robots and the machines side by side in the same games and the same social networks, is are we able to use crypto in some way to tell who's a human and who's a robot? Because that is very important. So we're going to talk about content authenticity next and how we battle all of the coming deepfakes, because crypto may play a role here, guys. We'll be right back with that conversation, but before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible, including MetaMask. If there are any crypto term you didn't understand on Bankless, go check out MetaMask Learn. They've got the info for you to level you up on crypto.
00:39:07.678 - 00:39:51.770, Speaker C: Learning about crypto is hard until now. Introducing MetaMask Learn, an open educational platform about crypto, web Three, self custody, wallet management, and all the other topics needed to onboard people into this crazy world of crypto. MetaMask Learn is an interactive platform with each lesson offering a simulation for the task at hand, giving you actual practical experience for navigating Web Three. The purpose of MetaMask Learn is to teach people the basics of self custody and wallet security in a safe environment.

Download the Uniswap wallet today on iOS. There is a link in the show notes.
00:41:47.150 - 00:42:23.018, Speaker A: Guys, we have Chow and Mohammed here. We're talking about AI and crypto. What's the intersection? Apparently a lot, as we've just learned in the first part of this episode. Let's talk about this idea of the humans and the robots living together in all of the digital landscapes. Whether it's our games or social networks or every place on the Internet, there seems to be this problem of being able to tell whether the content is published by a robot or whether it was a human. And who the humans and who the robots are, that seems important to know. Because, of course, with lower costs of replicating humans, we can get into a world of disinformation.
00:42:23.018 - 00:42:52.114, Speaker A: We can get into a world where we don't know whether this is genuinely a message from the President of the United States, or whether it's a deep fake from some AI that has created a message from joe Biden. Can crypto help us with this timestamping as a use case? Maybe this idea of identity tying crypto graphic identity together to separate the humans and the robots. Mohammed, what's your take on this section of your post? Because you guys covered it here, too.
00:42:52.252 - 00:43:34.966, Speaker B: And actually, Mohammed, before you give your take, I'd like to present just one scenario that I think is a great way to tee this up. Once upon a time, there was fake news that was spread about Vitalik's death and Ether price started to plummet. And what did Vitalik do? He took a photo of himself with a piece of paper that had Ethereum's current block height on it. And that was his proof of life in a world post mid journey and post artificially generated images that would no longer work. And so now we need a new level up. We need a new game, and we need a new zero to one moment in our authenticity of humanness in this post AI world. So I'll throw Rand's question back to you.
00:43:35.148 - 00:44:09.970, Speaker E: Okay, this is all great examples. And just to add to the general audience, what other examples can we like? We just saw a defect for a song from Drake, right? And if you go back a little bit, there was also a video of Morgan Freeman speaking and say, I'm not Morgan Freeman. So this is all examples that hit a tone with so. And the solution is very simple. We created a massive technology called digital signatures that can actually solve all of that. So what's the digital signature? For you to do any crypto transaction, you have a private key. No one else knows it.
00:44:09.970 - 00:44:30.038, Speaker E: A bot cannot crack it. And you are the only one who consign this transaction. And anyone in the wallet can verify this signature versus your public key. And how they will know public keys, they can go to the bankruptcy website. You can go to your Twitter account. They can go Ryan ETH. And they know that this public key is associated with you.
00:44:30.038 - 00:44:54.238, Speaker E: So this district signature turns out to be a very powerful tool to address all of that, including the picture of Vitalik. He doesn't need to have a picture. He can just say a message using his own private key. And done. This is a private key that is controlled by a human. And this human is telling the wallet this is a human generated content. So let's say that you want to prove this episode of Bankless.
00:44:54.238 - 00:45:22.666, Speaker E: What you do after you get all the video file, you sign the video content with the signature. And now this video is clear that it was recorded by the real Ryan and the real David and Shawar. Mohammed right? And done. Anyone can verify this. So this is the way I think is a very easy way that web3 can control these defects. But there is one catch. Now, after you recorded this episode, you want to get a clip of it.
00:45:22.666 - 00:46:12.986, Speaker E: You want to get a 1 minute clip. The problem once you do this, the signature is not valid for this 1 minute clip anymore. How to prove that this was an original subset from the original video? Another technology we developed in this space, which is zero knowledge proofs can actually address that you can do a computation, verifiable computation, in anything using ZKPs. And actually having a subset is a very simple computation. When you say, okay, this 1 minute video is an original subset from the 1 hour video, this is a very simple computation that you can create a Zeno knowledge proof to prove it, and anyone can verify this proof. So we developed two technologies that can help you authenticate original content and even allow you to get subsets of it to publish it without need to re sign the content. So this is one way we can move forward with this space.
00:46:13.088 - 00:47:24.698, Speaker A: So, Mohammed, we have the technology today to basically publish this using a Verifiable digital signature. Bankless, we have Bankless ETH, that's our ENS name, that launched a set of private keys that David and I control. And so we could publish it from Bankless ETH so people would know this is a certified, verified original from the owners of this private key, which I guess through other means, because we broadcasted this before people would know Bankless ETH is David and Ryan. So this is we, we can already solve that problem today, basically. And you're saying also there's another problem, which is there could be snippets of this content that are chopped up, that parts of it are deep faked, something like this. And what we could do is we could actually use ZK proof type technology to verify that a snippet, a video clip, say came from the original that was originally signed by David and Ryan on Bankless ETH. And we also have that technology today, the ZK proving technology, to kind of verify and validate that a subset clip was from the original.
00:47:24.874 - 00:48:05.742, Speaker E: Yeah, there are developers already building that and there are already developers doing something on images right now that when you have an image and you rescale it or like you rotate it or whatever, or you do any touching up, it can prove that what you did didn't change the content in a drastic way. I didn't take Ryan's face, I bought someone else. So there are projects already building in that. I think Ethereum Foundation is supporting one of the team on this regard. We are seeing actually teams that are trying to do this for video. We will see people do this on audio. There is a lot of ideas here and we will find the specialization because zero knowledge proof is still a new technology and you need to find the most efficient roof system for your use case.
00:48:05.742 - 00:48:32.600, Speaker E: So I think in the next one or two years you will find many products actually addressing that. So you can use it without even understanding that Ziki B is under the hood. Anyone who makes a clip of something will be just attaching a small data, which is a proof, and the burden goes to the person who publishes. If I publish something without a proof, we can take it by default. That's fake until they publish the proof that this was taken from an original content.
00:48:35.290 - 00:49:04.522, Speaker B: I'm still curious as to how this whole how you can verify a clip of a larger set of data as a part of the larger set of data. I'm so confused about that. So say we have like a 1 hour long video, and you take a 1 minute long clip. There are an infinity number of ways of manipulating that clip. You can change the resolution, you can change the color tone. You can add in new pixels and draw a line across part of the clip. Since there's infinity number of ways of manipulating a clip.
00:49:04.522 - 00:49:08.834, Speaker B: How does ZK proof actually work in this context? How does that work?
00:49:08.952 - 00:49:50.240, Speaker E: Okay, so we're already doing this today, David. Like, when you have a smart contract that do a lot of stuff, it can be DFI or whatever, and you say, okay, I will put all of this in a roll up and the roll up will execute this and just send me a proof on the L one saying that this program happened. So let's abstract zero knowledge approves as a way to create a proof for any program. If you can describe this program as code, you can convert this code in some ways into a proof. So what would you do? If you want to take a snippet and 1 minute snippet of your video, you can say, here is the code that I used. It's 50 lines of code that I used to take this snippet of the original file. And you publish this on GitHub or any open source media so everyone can actually validate this code.
00:49:50.240 - 00:50:19.634, Speaker E: And here is how this code got converted into a ziki circuit. And here is the proof using the ziki circuit. So of course, there is a chain of custody or a chain of proceeds, but any open source code essentially can be eventually converted into a ziki circuit, and you can create a proof for it. So, yes, there is some technical details that you need to publish. What transformation did you do? You cannot just do it like, here is approved for everything. This proof doesn't mean anything. You have to publish what you did to the code.
00:50:19.634 - 00:50:27.500, Speaker E: And yeah, once anyone validates that, you just added a line, you just changed the resolution, and then it's fine.
00:50:28.350 - 00:50:57.214, Speaker B: Okay? So the idea here is that all of the derivatives of data, so long as I am the person doing the manipulations, I can produce that chain of custody. So it's less about people, other agents that I don't like that are antagonistic it's not about antagonistic agents that are trying to copy my data. It's about me as the originator and my ability to prove that all downstream derivations of my data are sourced from the legitimate file.
00:50:57.262 - 00:50:57.860, Speaker A: Correct.
00:50:58.390 - 00:51:19.114, Speaker E: I would say anyone can do it. If I today wanted to take a one click from your video and I can say here is the code that I used, I wrote a code to take from 1 minute 15 second to 1 minute two minute 15 seconds. And here is the open source code that did that. And here is a proof that or the Ziki proof that matches the scoot. It's an open process, but anyone can do it. Which means more beautiful.
00:51:19.312 - 00:51:36.622, Speaker D: The use case here, for example, is when a journalist takes a clip of a real recording and then put it out of context, for example. And in this case, you can use ZKP to prove that the clip that the journalist showed is actually real versus totally fabricated.
00:51:36.766 - 00:51:41.890, Speaker B: So it's people who intend on being truthful, not people who intend on lying?
00:51:42.230 - 00:51:42.594, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:51:42.632 - 00:51:47.086, Speaker B: So people who are claiming the truth are part of that chain of truth.
00:51:47.198 - 00:52:01.162, Speaker E: Yes. And I think by default now, we are not used to this concept of defects, but I think humans are quick to understand that in the future, Defix will be the norm. And anyone who wants to prove the authentic, they will have to send something.
00:52:01.216 - 00:52:23.050, Speaker A: To make sure they have to have a digital signature. But let me ask you about this. Okay. So all pieces of content will have digital signatures associated with them. Right on crypto, economically secured digital signatures. Okay, that's great. But we just talked about AIS being able to spin up their own private keys, being able to spin up their own digital signatures.
00:52:23.050 - 00:52:37.394, Speaker A: So I guess my overarching question is, but does this solve the problem? Because how do you prove humanity in the first place? How do you guys know I'm not a bot and haven't been a bot the whole time? Holding the Bankless ETH like private keys, for example.
00:52:37.512 - 00:52:38.866, Speaker B: I question myself that.
00:52:39.048 - 00:52:52.874, Speaker A: So does that, does that need to be fixed for this or are we still using the squishy social layer to prove humanity? And David's, like, I met this guy in real life one time. One time. We met David. Are you really sure? How certain are you about that event? Did it really happen?
00:52:52.912 - 00:53:20.062, Speaker D: That's exactly right. Like you mentioned that you need this social layer to bootstrap credibility of the system. So today the social layer is those web, two social networks. So for example, if you guys want to prove that this bankless episode is produced by you guys, you need to publish Bankless ETH on your Twitter account. And people believe that Twitter account and therefore they believe that this digital signature belongs to a human, not a bot.
00:53:20.126 - 00:53:32.920, Speaker A: And what a digital influencer? Who set up a Twitter account? I'm an AI agent there's not actually real. I'm just kind of synthetic. Then we have to collapse it back further beyond web two and get back into meat space.
00:53:34.090 - 00:53:37.254, Speaker D: Potentially, yes. Well, think about this.
00:53:37.372 - 00:53:51.594, Speaker B: It depends on who cares about whether that person is the originator or not. Like maybe the AI is the originator and all we care about the truth for that is that is the correct originator that we care about.
00:53:51.712 - 00:53:52.966, Speaker A: We don't care about proving humanity.
00:53:52.998 - 00:54:10.878, Speaker D: David that's a really good description. The digital signature is not to prove whether or not something is produced by bot or human. It's used to produce that. This thing used to prove that this piece of content is produced by this person or creator or authentic to prove authenticity rather than personhood.
00:54:11.054 - 00:54:11.442, Speaker A: Right.
00:54:11.496 - 00:54:25.718, Speaker B: Yeah. Our future AI influencers are totally able to use this technology to claim provenance over their AI generated content, whether or not it is fake news or not.
00:54:25.804 - 00:55:17.880, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll just know it's from that specific agent, whether it's human or robot, and it's authentically from that agent, but we don't necessarily know whether that is a human or a robot. My other question for you guys here is we have this technology today, basically, specifically that sign in with Ethereum, sign in with your private key. Why hasn't it been adopted? I mean, Twitter has this massive problem. I'm like Elon Musk, he's like battling the bots all the time on Twitter and it seems like crypto has a solution for this. Why haven't we been able to kind of penetrate and people are still using username and passwords all of the time. There's not a lot that's being digitally verified, and yet we have the tech. Is there a network effect problem that we have and that we haven't? How do we know that this is going to take off?
00:55:19.470 - 00:56:09.850, Speaker D: I think the reason is very simple. It takes a startup that is well connected enough with all these platforms where the content emerges. For example, Twitter or YouTube or TikTok or even my Sony camera. When I take a picture, I want to be able to provide a digital signature, for example. So it takes a startup that's well networked enough with these platforms and be able to convince them to join this protocol, to be part of this protocol, where digital signature is required to sign messages. So I think that's the only reason why the solution is not being implemented yet. And I think that, for example, this whole deep fake thing is going to play a massive role in the next election.
00:56:09.850 - 00:56:24.718, Speaker D: But I think we only have one more election for this to happen, because by the 2028 election, the solution will be ready, a digital signature will be ready.
00:56:24.804 - 00:56:33.418, Speaker A: We just need a builder to put all the puzzle pieces together and partner with the content providers and make this easy button for them. That's the part we're missing.
00:56:33.514 - 00:56:37.220, Speaker E: That's right, yes. Convenience user experience always has. Been the issue.
00:56:38.230 - 00:56:44.290, Speaker B: Probably the other piece we're missing is for all the bad actors to force this use case into necessity.
00:56:46.790 - 00:56:48.100, Speaker A: Soon, isn't it?
00:56:49.050 - 00:56:50.354, Speaker D: That catalyst.
00:56:50.482 - 00:57:14.262, Speaker A: Wow. Okay. So we've talked about payment and execution Rails for AI agents. So basically, we've created a money system for the robots. Good job, crypto. Hope that turns out okay, but it's definitely going to increase the use of our crypto network. And then we've also talked about this check and balance, which is crypto technologies can be used to verify authenticity using digital signatures.
00:57:14.262 - 00:57:38.200, Speaker A: There's one other category and there's much more that you post discuss. But there's one other category I want to make sure we cover before we end this episode. Mohammed and Jow. So that is privacy. Privacy. So tell us about the privacy story and the tie between AI and crypto and privacy. What's the intersection there?
00:57:40.090 - 00:58:28.434, Speaker E: This is actually a new category, which what I consider that how crypto can actually solve the problems of current AI models or the AI paradigm. AI paradigms now are very transparent. They don't respect the privacy. Chat GBT collected all the data essentially on the Internet and trained it, right? And if you have some certain private data and use the chat GBT, this data actually may leak back into the training set. So the training set of a chat GBT will have your own private data. So the question becomes, how to solve this privacy issue? How to allow machine learning model to act on private information. The examples that I love to give here is like using AI for medical diagnosis.
00:58:28.434 - 00:59:32.614, Speaker E: So this is a trend, it's not approved by the FDA, but even FDA is willing to explore AI for this. And there is multiple research pieces from the FDA saying how AI can help with medical tasks. So the point here, let's say that you have an want to, and this IR model can diagnose cancer. But to get it to diagnose cancer correctly, you need to train this on many, many data, right? So you need to get people who have cancer sharing their medical records with the AR model and people also who didn't have cancer to share this data with their AI model. For the AI model to be able to label this patient has cancer or this paper doesn't have cancer. But are we willing to share our medical information with this AI model? Are we willing to share this private, intimate information with any company? The answer is typically no. So then how to solve this problem? How to use AI for something like that? I think the answer is simple, which is using, again, zero knowledge proofs.
00:59:32.614 - 01:00:11.798, Speaker E: So let's say that I have a medical record today and I want to use I'm okay sharing this with for training. But my only condition is that it doesn't have any personal, identifiable identifying information. So, again, we place the scheme of authenticity. The hospital or the doctor who created this medical report can digitally sign it to make sure it's authentic. Now we prove this medical record authentic. Now I want to anonymize this medical record. I want to take my data off it only keeping the x rays, the MRIs, whatever, then we can use a ZKB to prove that I just anonymize this medical record.
01:00:11.798 - 01:00:49.394, Speaker E: I took off only my personal information and the rest of the medical record is complete and correct. And now we have a set of authentic medical data that are clear, that can be used to train AI models. So we solve it a huge issue in this case. The other part, I call this the training how to use privacy to train AI model. But even after training of this AI model, we can actually use it for diagnosis without leaking privacy. Now a company runs this AI model in their servers and I can anonymize my medical record before sending it for diagnosis. Like I will just send this data to the AI model and the AI model will tell me if I have cancer or not.
01:00:49.394 - 01:01:14.010, Speaker E: But the model doesn't know my name, my real name, it doesn't know my addresses, it doesn't know any personal information. So I think Ziki bees and this is one of these cases, there is only many use cases in privacy. One of them is the walley coin announcement that we can touch on if you would like. But I think privacy and Ziki bees are very strong players that can actually solve many problems of current AI systems.
01:01:15.150 - 01:01:42.340, Speaker A: What's at stake if we don't solve the privacy issue with AI? Is it basically like because outside of the bounds of this, I'm not aware that this is a solved problem at all. So I'm just wondering if basically the chat GPTs of the world without something like this, we're moving towards a Dystopia where there is no such thing as digital privacy. What's at stake if we don't get this part of it right?
01:01:43.110 - 01:02:36.850, Speaker E: A lot at stake. Would you like to be able to know your medical records and act on it and maybe even treat against you because you are not in a mentally state or a healthy state? It's very dangerous. And I mentioned this in our private discussion. If you really don't want to use any information public, that is the only way is to make all your transactions private. And this is something like we also built in our ecosystem using Zcash and other companies that use zero knowledge proof to hide complete information of a transaction. I can transact with you, I can send you data, but no one except me and you will know it. So even to protect it from invasion of privacy, and I mentioned this in the article, you can, but you will have to go through the pain of using complete privacy using zero knowledge proofs.
01:02:37.910 - 01:03:16.218, Speaker A: Guys, this has been a lot of fun and as we draw to a close here I got to put the investor cap back on here, of course, because we are on the journey west and we're definitely looking for opportunity here. A lot of investors listen to this space, and so I'm trying to listen for the investable opportunities that you guys see between the intersection of AI and crypto and of course, lots of AI concentrated type bets. We already talked about the meme narrative trade. Not interested in that. More interested in kind of the fundamentals here. One thing I'm hearing at the end of this episode is buy crypto networks that AI agents are most likely to use in the future. That seems pretty logical.
01:03:16.218 - 01:03:33.302, Speaker A: I'm like, okay, well, I'm doing that. I think I've been doing that. And so continue doing that. Okay, that makes me more bullish. Also, we talked about looking for the easy button for content authenticity, content authentication. Somebody's got to build that. There might be a number of startups trying to do that.
01:03:33.302 - 01:03:55.130, Speaker A: Also looking for the easy button for privacy. That seems to be a case here, but Chow high level. What do you think the investable opportunities are here between this intersection of crypto and AI? Of course, none of this is financial advice, as we always say, but what are the fundamental opportunities here for public market participants?
01:03:55.290 - 01:04:40.860, Speaker D: Frankly, I can't see any, just because I said before there's probably a dozen of AI coins, but it's very hard to price them because they have no cash flow. I don't know if they're overvalued or undervalued. You can do a narrative trade that lasts like two months, for example. But there is nothing I'm really willing to hold long term at this point because I don't know if they're going to go up or down. It's hard to price them. That said, there's a couple of Stunks, if you're interested, that I'm personally invested in. I've done quite a bit of research, but one of them is TSM, Taiwan semiconductor company.
01:04:40.860 - 01:05:14.134, Speaker D: I see Mohammed is smiling because Mohammed told me about these two stocks last year. But one of them is TSM. The other one is ASML. They are parts of two parts of the AI or the chip supply chain. So TSM's main customer will be someone like so TSM has a lot of customers, but one of them is Nvidia, for example. Nvidia is also probably the purest AI bet. However, Nvidia's PE is like 140 or something.
01:05:14.134 - 01:05:49.086, Speaker D: I just can't bring myself to buy it. So I'm not thinking about Nvidia. But TSM produces the chips to nvidia. Nvidia is the chip designer. ASML is the one that produces equipment just to simplify things, equipment for TSM and intel to produce their chips. So TSM and ASML are as close as it gets to monopolies in any industries like TSM. It'll take intel maybe three years to catch up to them, and ASML it might take a decade.
01:05:49.198 - 01:05:52.434, Speaker A: These are the chips that all the AI agents are going to run on.
01:05:52.472 - 01:06:02.726, Speaker E: Basically that's Life semiconductor bottlenecks. This is the player that creates the chips that anyone using AI need them.
01:06:02.908 - 01:06:03.830, Speaker D: That's right.
01:06:03.980 - 01:06:20.390, Speaker B: Isn't the more obvious answer Chow and Mohammed? Cool. There's infrastructure that we need to put the AI components together to build the AIS, but what about just buying the AI money that the AIS are going to use in the future? Isn't that the more simple answer?
01:06:20.560 - 01:06:21.440, Speaker D: Of course.
01:06:23.410 - 01:06:25.354, Speaker B: Doesn't that just mean we're just buying ETH?
01:06:25.482 - 01:06:26.910, Speaker D: Buy ETH? That's right.
01:06:27.060 - 01:06:28.814, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay, there we go.
01:06:29.012 - 01:07:07.178, Speaker A: It sounds like every conclusion on Bankless is that answer to Bankless podcast. But this is great. Last question for you guys as we kind of head out. So we talked about a lot of things, a lot of transformation coming our way with AI agents. David and I have been doing a number of episodes related to AI safety and there's this problem that Elisekowski maybe most famously lays out of, like he's very scared of the existential risks. He's 99% certainty that AI is going to murder us. And so, I mean, this is kind of worried because I'm sitting back and we just established that we built a money system for AI agents.
01:07:07.178 - 01:07:40.520, Speaker A: Okay, cool. Did we just build a money system for AI agents to accelerate the murdering of humanity? The destruction of humanity? You guys are in the space too, and I'm just at this stage information gathering, looking for people with some knowledge and some opinions here. What do you guys rate the probability of the AI risk threat to humanity? I mean, Eliser is the most extreme. He's like 99.9% sure there's others that are far less extreme. How do you personally weigh this problem? Maybe Chow, you first and then Mohammed will end there with you.
01:07:40.970 - 01:08:14.846, Speaker D: To be honest, I haven't thought deeply about the AI alignment problem. I've listened to a bunch of podcasts. I haven't formed my own independent opinion yet, but so far I'm very optimistic about AI. I've just seen how much more productive chat GPT has made our developers. The single biggest use case of GPT from what I've seen today is developer productivity. So I've chatted with a bunch of developers. Every single one of them tells me they've quoted me a productivity improvement of anywhere between 10% to 200%.
01:08:14.846 - 01:08:45.020, Speaker D: It's mind boggling. And I think that these things are just going to make startups a lot easier. It's going to make it a lot quicker for people to ship MVPs and build new products. And I think productivity is going to increase across the board throughout the whole economy within the next ten years. I don't really see a world where AI kills us in the next ten years. And I see a huge improvement GDP boost in the next ten years. So that's what I'm seeing.
01:08:45.470 - 01:09:00.590, Speaker B: I will say the AI alignment people will tell you that, yes, everything's going to be great. We're going to have massive economic and productivity booms and then the alignment problem will manifest and they will kill us. It's more like it will be great.
01:09:00.660 - 01:09:07.220, Speaker A: The turkey's having a great time until, know, the week before Thanksgiving. Mohammed, though, how do you answer this question? What's your take on it?
01:09:07.590 - 01:10:07.326, Speaker E: I think it's a viable threat, but my personal view is that we will actually figure out ways to use AI to discipline AI or AI to even fight. Like, I don't underestimate the human ingenuity to come with solutions. Even using the tools, I still consider AI as a tool that we use now. And if it became outside bound, we will find ways to bring it back inbound. And we already starting discussing today ways of how we can actually prove that stuff is happening without AI. Can preventing it? Digital signature can be maybe the new nuclear codes, right? Like you cannot launch a nuclear missile without having a digital signature and like biometric signature and a lot of other stuff. So I'm optimistic and I think it's a threat and we have to pay attention to it, but I think we have all the tools that we need to be on the good side of this debate.
01:10:07.518 - 01:10:38.240, Speaker A: Very good, guys. We'll end on that optimistic note. And one thing I will share, I haven't formed an opinion on this yet for myself, but I can say this with 100% confidence. I am more optimistic in our AI future with crypto in it than without it. I do think this technology is a useful tool, checks and balances for our so, you know, hopefully we're doing a good thing here and certainly you guys are doing a great thing by bringing this to our audience today. So, Chow and Mohammed, thank you so much for spending some time with us.
01:10:38.930 - 01:10:40.400, Speaker D: Thanks for having us.
01:10:40.850 - 01:10:53.550, Speaker A: Risks and disclaimers, of course. Got to let you know, all crypto is risky. So is artificial intelligence. You lose what you put in. But we are headed west. This is a frontier. It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey.
01:10:53.550 - 01:10:54.660, Speaker A: Thanks a lot.
01:10:59.180 - 01:10:59.652, Speaker D: Bam.
01:10:59.716 - 01:11:01.012, Speaker B: Thanks, guys. That was killer.
01:11:01.076 - 01:11:01.928, Speaker D: Thanks, guys.
01:11:02.094 - 01:11:10.200, Speaker A: Really great. Really fun. You guys unlocked some things for me personally, so I love those types of episodes. I appreciate.
01:11:10.740 - 01:11:11.150, Speaker E: Thank you.
