00:00:00.090 - 00:00:32.662, Speaker A: This eth thing is interesting. We have the number two currency that's going from proof of work to proof of stake. Now, whether or not that's a good thing, it's irrelevant. But the structural fact is there's less issuance of it, and it's the only currency that's of this size that's doing this switch. I love this trade because I can be wrong on the Fed and still make money, in my opinion, on Ethereum, because the structural flows are dramatically changing in such a way that it gives, I think, the price enough up side to overcome possibly a negative macro environment. And that's the only trade that I see right now with that sort of setup. And it's a one time thing.
00:00:32.716 - 00:00:51.420, Speaker B: So you love this trade because you can be wrong on the Fed, you can be wrong on Ethereum. Even winning, like another competitor, could blow past it in the future. But it doesn't matter because this is a structural change. It's a one time event, and the flows are fundamentally changing. And that's kind of like guaranteed as long as the merge is successful. And so this rate is like a no brainer. Yes.
