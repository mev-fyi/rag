00:00:07.530 - 00:00:14.734, Speaker A: Hey, bankless nation. It is the fifth week and last week of September. And you know what time it is? David, tell them what time is it?
00:00:14.772 - 00:00:30.994, Speaker B: Roll up. Time to roll up. The entire week of crypto, which, like I always say, is an ambitious endeavor in this industry. An insane amount of things happen every single day. And we are going to roll up the last week of September here on this Friday. Bankless weekly roll up. Ready, Ryan?
00:00:31.122 - 00:00:38.918, Speaker A: Yep, I'm ready. Enjoy this with your cup of coffee, guys. And David, it looks like you've had a few cups of coffee. Looking good, man. You're back in your place right off the road.
00:00:39.004 - 00:00:51.498, Speaker B: Yeah. In stark contrast to a very, very tired hotel room. Weekly roll up. I'm back in San Diego with my setup, with my coffee in the morning. Multiple cups of coffee today. So, yeah, it's going to be a fun weekly roll up this week.
00:00:51.584 - 00:01:08.610, Speaker A: All right, guys, we have so much to cover. I think we're going to hit the china ban. They banned crypto for the 500th time, but this time maybe they mean it. We're going to get into that. We're also going to touch on NFTs on Twitter. Is this the new blue check mark? We got to talk about Virgil Griffith as well, guys. So this is going to be a jam packed roll up for you.
00:01:08.680 - 00:01:41.254, Speaker B: A bunch of cool things mixed in with some unfortunate things. And the China band actually has some silver linings, which we're about to get into, into the market section, the Virgil Griffith story. No silver linings there. So you're going to hear some frustration coming out of me and Ryan later in the show. But I think that the coolest thing is Twitter, led by Jack Dorsey, who only talks about bitcoin, did two things like you said. One was integrate NFTs on their platform so you can get your verified NFt. And you can also tip with bitcoin now with Twitter.
00:01:41.254 - 00:01:50.382, Speaker B: So they're doing two things, one's ethereum focused, one's bitcoin focused. I wonder which one the market will like more in the future. We will see.
00:01:50.436 - 00:02:15.226, Speaker A: Well, I can't wait to talk about that some more. So we're going to get into those items. A few announcements we need to share with you. So if today you're listening to this, it is Friday, October 1, then that means discounts have just launched for permissionless. So permissionless is a DFI conference. We are putting this on with our friends at blockworks. I think it's going to be the biggest d five party of 2022.
00:02:15.226 - 00:02:21.770, Speaker A: And you guys need to be there. This is going to be in Florida. Where are we headed, David?
00:02:22.110 - 00:02:24.570, Speaker B: West Palm Beach. Palm beach.
00:02:24.990 - 00:02:45.154, Speaker A: Almost forgot. And so what they're doing with the ticket rollout is they're rolling out 250 at a time. So every two weeks, 250 new tickets get issued up. They get snapped up quickly. If you are a bankless premium member, you can get the tickets at 30% off every two weeks. Tickets increase in price. I think it's $300 and something.
00:02:45.154 - 00:02:58.290, Speaker A: But if you're a bankless premium, you get $95 off this week. So if you're interested in coming with us partying in Florida, then check this out in the show notes and jump on permissionless train.
00:02:58.440 - 00:03:07.286, Speaker B: As the resident conference goer here, it's no surprise that Ryan forgot where we were going. But yeah, Ryan is actually going to be there too, as well. Be there by iPad or am I.
00:03:07.308 - 00:03:09.702, Speaker A: Actually attending in person? We hadn't discussed this yet.
00:03:09.756 - 00:03:12.822, Speaker B: I mean, you don't live too far away from West Palm beach.
00:03:12.886 - 00:03:14.602, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm going to be there in person.
00:03:14.656 - 00:03:48.686, Speaker B: Guys, definitely, it's been a ton of fun organizing this event with the blockworks team. They definitely understand that crypto conferences aren't just about the conferences and more about how it's a cultural festival. So if you've never been to a crypto conference before, don't think of it like a boring conference. Think of it something much more closer to literally a festival of the arts, a festival of culture. There's going to be the actual conference with actual good content and talks, but then after the fact, it's going to be just a bunch of good vibes. So looking forward to that. Bankless.
00:03:48.686 - 00:03:53.526, Speaker B: Going to throw a party question mark. I have to convince Ryan of this. I haven't talked about it to him.
00:03:53.548 - 00:04:05.770, Speaker A: Yet, but you sent it to me in discord. I was definitely down. I haven't commented on that. But guys, we are throwing a party. Absolutely. So be there. Also, NFT gallery, they're going to have tons of cultural things too, so make sure you check this out.
00:04:05.770 - 00:04:33.026, Speaker A: One last thing on this is we're working a little bit with the sponsor team and there's been a ton of interest from prospective sponsors, but we want some Defi sponsors to partake in sponsorship. So if you are interested in being a Defi sponsor, we've got a lot on the list. We want the premium, we want the cream of the crop Defi sponsors to show their force at this conference. Then ping one of us, I don't know, dm us or something and we'll get you in touch with the right people.
00:04:33.208 - 00:04:59.610, Speaker B: We are just holding the floodgates of the dam of centralized companies who all are chomping at the bit, right? But defi companies generally a don't have the opportunity or don't think about this as a place to get their branding out because generally defi companies have their own community to help support their branding. But let me tell you, if the defi companies don't take it, the CFI companies absolutely will. So we're holding the doors closed on the CFI companies.
00:04:59.680 - 00:05:00.362, Speaker A: We're making room.
00:05:00.416 - 00:05:02.394, Speaker B: We're making room for you guys.
00:05:02.432 - 00:05:27.326, Speaker A: Come talk. Also, this is like an offer that I think you have maybe three more days for. If you're listening to this, if you become a bankless premium member by Sunday, in the next three days you get a bankless t shirt. This is the bankless essential t shirt. It's the one I'm wearing right now, the one David and I are displayed in, in many of our shows. All you have to do, I think the value on this is like $28. All you have to do is sign up for bankless premium.
00:05:27.326 - 00:05:54.778, Speaker A: You can see the benefits. We'll include a link in the show notes, but that's a full market opportunity report. Every Monday you get to hang out with the crew in the inner circle, discord chat, podcast debriefs. You're not catching all of the podcasts unless you are bankless premium. David and I do extra podcasts after the show and release that on a bankless premium feed. Alpha leak emails. You would have known about DyDX in advance if you got these emails.
00:05:54.778 - 00:06:02.170, Speaker A: Also, a 30% discount to the conference we were just talking about and an NFT badge. All of that is included in bankless premium.
00:06:02.250 - 00:06:06.802, Speaker B: The newsletter is designed to pay for itself, so don't get left behind.
00:06:06.936 - 00:06:25.814, Speaker A: All you need is one alpha leak and it's like a ten x return. I tell you, we'll get to one of those alpha leaks later. But lastly, we got to talk about Xerion, David. So Xerion wants us to get the word out to you. They are doubling down on nfts. Tripling down on nfts. I think we are looking.
00:06:25.814 - 00:06:42.938, Speaker A: You probably use Xerion for your defi user interface to do. For me, Xerion is like a go to tool. I can't be without it. But right now I'm displaying on screen one of David's ETH addresses and I'm seeing a lot of nfts in this address. These are your nfts, right?
00:06:43.024 - 00:07:03.838, Speaker B: Please ignore the Fidenza rocks, which are 100% scams that I thought that I thought it was going to be, like in the 80s, yet I need to send them away from my portfolio. So please ignore the Fidenza rocks. They are scams. Do not buy them. I got rugged, but here are my flowers. Look at my flowers, Ryan. Wait, you just scrolled right by my fantastic flower collection.
00:07:03.838 - 00:07:08.866, Speaker B: Dude, the portfolio gets better as you go along, right?
00:07:08.968 - 00:07:09.774, Speaker A: We're looking at flowers.
00:07:09.822 - 00:07:26.134, Speaker B: Here are my flowers. The black and white ones are the rare ones. Fun fact, but I really like that rose one in the middle here. And then if you keep on scrolling, then also ignore those. Those are bad. I need to also get rid of those generative mass and cyber Kongs. The London EIP 1559 gift.
00:07:26.134 - 00:07:43.246, Speaker B: My pudgy penguins, which are super cute. Super cute penguins. They both look rare. And then, of course, finishing off is the cryptopunk one one eight. Also, you can see it right behind me. Yeah, Zerion doing a really good job making an NFT portfolio interface alongside your DFI portfolio, sir.
00:07:43.428 - 00:07:47.982, Speaker A: No turtles in this portfolio yet. What are you doing, man? You sleeping on turtles, though? Tiny turtles.
00:07:48.126 - 00:07:54.260, Speaker B: I'm absolutely sleeping on turtles. As soon as I see a turtle in my Twitter feed, I put it away.
00:07:55.190 - 00:07:56.238, Speaker A: You mute.
00:07:56.414 - 00:07:58.086, Speaker B: I mute the turtle. Yeah.
00:07:58.188 - 00:08:29.438, Speaker A: You know what's awesome about this, too, is I haven't used this yet, but you can actually configure this interface to display an NFT through Xerion on your Apple Watch, too. So something else to check. Another way to flex when you're off your screen, when you're just out in public, it becomes like your NFT Rolex. Just like that. With the new features, NFT features that Xeron is adding. So if you're interested in checking that out, we'll include a link in the show notes. Thanks to Xeroon for sponsoring this message.
00:08:29.524 - 00:08:31.518, Speaker B: Yeah, cheers. All right.
00:08:31.604 - 00:08:36.880, Speaker A: It's dope. That's awesome. I love that.
00:08:37.590 - 00:08:39.460, Speaker B: Not are not awesome.
00:08:40.150 - 00:08:46.062, Speaker A: You are proud of them. All right, guys, we're going to get to the markets next. David, do you want to start with bitcoin markets?
00:08:46.126 - 00:09:09.654, Speaker B: Bitcoin, starting the week at roughly $44,000, got up to the high price of $45,000. And then it has fallen after that down, hit the lows of roughly $41,000 a number of times throughout the week. And then it has reclaimed $43,200 at the time of recording, generally flat down 1% on the week. Unexciting.
00:09:09.782 - 00:09:14.910, Speaker A: It's a good day when bitcoin is above 40k. That's what I say.
00:09:14.980 - 00:09:16.494, Speaker B: Yeah, every ten k, right?
00:09:16.612 - 00:09:19.742, Speaker A: Yeah, every ten k. Absolutely. How about Eth? How's it doing?
00:09:19.796 - 00:09:52.466, Speaker B: Eth, starting the week at roughly, what was it, $3,000? Got smacked pretty hard. Fell all the way down to $2,750, where we did see some liquidations reclaimed $3,150 twice inside of the week, and then also fell again twice inside of the week, down to $28,000. And we are now almost trying to get our heads right above $3,000 at the time of recording. So some volatility this week between 2000, 753,150 volatility. A lot of volatility.
00:09:52.578 - 00:10:04.362, Speaker A: It's pretty crazy. We're back to the chop. Are we back to the crab season once again? I thought we were almost out of that. The end of the summer and September was looking promising. Now it's let me down in the second half. What's going on, David?
00:10:04.426 - 00:10:36.530, Speaker B: Well, we have a bunch of Fud, right? So we have the regulatory Fud that scared a lot of people. We also had China banning crypto, which apparently the market is actually reacting to this time, which is like a first since 2017. And then there was this whole treasury debacle, insider trading, like insecurity in the legacy markets. The traditional markets got hammered this week. The first day that legacy markets got hammered, crypto fell right in parallel with it. The second day, which was today, I believe. Today or yesterday.
00:10:36.530 - 00:11:01.438, Speaker B: Crypto markets have instead become resilient to that. So I think crypto markets are done being scared, and they're now just kind of waiting for everything else in the world to solidify so they can finally show some strength. I think. I always think this crypto markets want to show strength. There's just been, like, a bunch of fud in the last week or so coming from so many different directions. And so once the rest of the.
00:11:01.444 - 00:11:04.366, Speaker A: World can just deal with that, I.
00:11:04.388 - 00:11:07.218, Speaker B: Think we can resume bullishness. But that's my take.
00:11:07.304 - 00:11:25.302, Speaker A: Yeah, I still feel like, David, we are in a major bull trend. Right. If this kind of level of flood had happened during a bear market when everyone's pessimistic, I mean, crypto would have tanked and it would have stayed down for a while. The fact that we're even kind of seeing this volatility and rebounding, it still indicates to me we're in this secular bull market.
00:11:25.436 - 00:11:29.234, Speaker B: We are not hitting new lows. We are getting fud, and we are not hitting new lows.
00:11:29.282 - 00:11:49.006, Speaker A: Yeah, I do think that the fourth quarter, generally, it's been good for crypto, particularly in bull years. So we'll see how this fourth quarter pans out. But it still could be good for crypto. We'll keep you updated every Friday as we do. All right, let's talk about this. Updates on the ETH to bitcoin ratio. What's going on here?
00:11:49.108 - 00:11:58.126, Speaker B: Nothing too much, I believe. Last week it was at zero 70 something something, and right now we are at zero 69. So flat on the week for ETH.
00:11:58.158 - 00:12:25.574, Speaker A: BTC, there's rumors of, like, a bitcoin ETF in October. Remember Rao Paul said that? And bitcoin has shown some resilience, some strength. I wonder if it's kind of feeding on that rumor. I wonder if we'll actually see something. I've been waiting for kind of a Maya Copa from Gensler to just be like, here's an olive branch, crypto, your ETF. I hate you in all of these other ways, but I'm going to give you this ETF. Maybe that's going to happen in October.
00:12:25.574 - 00:12:32.906, Speaker A: That could shed some light or that could give some life to bitcoin, but we'll have to see absolutely the two.
00:12:32.928 - 00:12:37.358, Speaker B: Faces of Gary Gensler, the nice face we haven't seen yet. So maybe that one.
00:12:37.524 - 00:12:51.294, Speaker A: Come on, Gary, help us out here. All right. DFI pulse. This is slower than I've seen for a while. We're at 68 billion total locked value. I think it's because crypto has gotten sort of pummeled in the last quarter.
00:12:51.422 - 00:12:59.094, Speaker B: I actually think that that might be a bug on DFI pulse, because if you look at the chart, that chart is definitely above $80 billion.
00:12:59.212 - 00:12:59.846, Speaker A: It is.
00:12:59.948 - 00:13:08.342, Speaker B: So there's a little bit of a discrepancy there. Sometimes the DFI pulse.com front end does experience some bugs just because there's so many different ways to count.
00:13:08.396 - 00:13:12.150, Speaker A: What's the real number? It's 81 billion. Then it looks like on the graph.
00:13:12.910 - 00:13:17.434, Speaker B: That'S the higher one. So we'll go on that one as the source of truth. 81 billion locked in D five.
00:13:17.472 - 00:13:22.058, Speaker A: When in doubt, skew bullish, folks. Crypto is in a ten year secular bull market.
00:13:22.144 - 00:13:24.750, Speaker B: Wait, Ryan, you're giving away all of our bankless secrets.
00:13:25.890 - 00:13:34.798, Speaker A: Let's look at ETH locked in D five, though. That's where I think this chart gets interesting. I'll focus on the chart. We're at 7.8 million ETh locked, which.
00:13:34.804 - 00:13:35.794, Speaker B: Is an all time high.
00:13:35.912 - 00:13:37.234, Speaker A: This is an all time high.
00:13:37.352 - 00:13:38.354, Speaker B: Well, I think that's true.
00:13:38.392 - 00:13:43.266, Speaker A: Let me show that. Let me scan out. Yeah, no, close. Close. Super close.
00:13:43.368 - 00:13:44.194, Speaker B: Yeah, count it.
00:13:44.232 - 00:14:09.162, Speaker A: Tied all time high since April, right? Yeah, and really close to the all time high ever. So that's a good sign. I think it's nice for ETH to become more reliant on this much more trustless piece of collateral, rather than all of kind of the stablecoins that we've seen going around the ecosystem. Okay, how about DFI pulse index? Where are we at with DFI tokens themselves?
00:14:09.296 - 00:14:31.906, Speaker B: Yeah, the DFI pulse index started the week at roughly. Can you go to the one week chart? Started the week at $327, hit the high of the week at 348, and the low was 275. Again, you're seeing a lot of that volatility in the DPI token, ending the week at $304. Overall, down 6% on the week.
00:14:32.088 - 00:14:40.002, Speaker A: All right, now we're going to take a look at this chart, which is the ratio of DPI to ETH. It's not DFI season yet, David.
00:14:40.066 - 00:14:49.158, Speaker B: No, it's flat. Last week it was at 0.1. This week it's at 0.1. So we are flat on the week with some inter week volatility as well.
00:14:49.324 - 00:14:54.074, Speaker A: You sound sad about that. Are you sad about that? You want d five season to come back?
00:14:54.112 - 00:15:03.022, Speaker B: I do want defi season. It's always so much fun. But NFTs just don't stop being bullish and so all the attention keeps on going there.
00:15:03.156 - 00:15:07.840, Speaker A: Yeah, we should start putting some NFT indices on, like, I don't know, the best one.
00:15:08.770 - 00:15:28.326, Speaker B: We need some defi NFt infrastructure to come out. People need to start using fractional more so we can stop talking about the floor price because the floor is just such a terrible metric to actually measure the value of these things. Yeah, dude. If there's a bankless listener out there who has a good idea for a consistent metric we could use to talk about the value of NFT markets over time, let us know.
00:15:28.428 - 00:15:41.000, Speaker A: We've seen some indices, but nothing that has kind of the mind share of something that we would need to report on this prestigious high journalist integrity media outlet, which bankless is.
00:15:42.510 - 00:15:44.682, Speaker B: I can't tell if you're being facetious or not.
00:15:44.736 - 00:15:57.310, Speaker A: Oh, no, that was 100% serious. Let's talk about the bed index. That is our favorite index in crypto. Composed 30% bitcoin, 30% E, 30% dpi itself. What are we looking at on the week?
00:15:57.380 - 00:16:09.060, Speaker B: Yeah, down 4% on the week. Started the week at 136, hit the high of 143, hit also a low of 115. Ended the week at roughly $134.
00:16:09.430 - 00:16:24.166, Speaker A: There you go, David. I think it's time we check in on our friend EIP 15 five nine. I mean, it's been great guy, two months now. Yeah, great guy. Doing great things. Just like busy burning. Every day eth is burnt is a day that I am bullish, sir.
00:16:24.166 - 00:16:34.566, Speaker A: But let's look below the surface. That's the title of this article itself. And what does EIP 15 five nine look like below the surface? Has it accomplished its goals?
00:16:34.758 - 00:17:08.510, Speaker B: Yeah, so the author, who is named t, does a fantastic write up of just kind of trying to parse apart the data of EIP 1559. And the cool thing about EIP 1559 is that the data that comes out for it is not known how significant that data is, what it really means. EIP 1559 is emergent, as in the properties and behaviors and data that arrive out of EIP 1559. There is no canonical definition of what these things mean. And so this was actually one of the best. There's no history. There's no history.
00:17:08.510 - 00:17:48.058, Speaker B: Not only has it never been done in crypto, but blockchains and everything is new. Everything is new. And so there's a lot of data here. And T gives his interpretation and analysis, but he definitely qualifies it, saying like, hey, this is just my take, and we're going to need to have more data to see what these things mean. There's a ton of fantastic graphs and some analysis with each one. So if you want to just learn more about how EIP 1559 is impacting Ethereum and ether, definitely check this out. It's a great homework assignment for people who are trying to dive deeper to the code of Ethereum and the ETH markets, and they're just, overall, some great analyses.
00:17:48.154 - 00:17:54.194, Speaker A: What is this take here, David? What's the summary of it? Is EIP 15 five nine working as designed or no?
00:17:54.312 - 00:18:13.340, Speaker B: Yeah, it's absolutely working as designed. What he was trying to indicate is like, well, okay, it's working as designed, but how does that actually change things? Right? We know EIP one five nine, it makes it easier to transact. It burns eth. But what does that actually do?
00:18:13.790 - 00:18:17.260, Speaker A: What does it do to daily minor sell pressure, for example?
00:18:18.350 - 00:18:44.740, Speaker B: Right. And how does it actually impact the EtH price at all? Right. And his take, if I remember correctly, is like, in the short term, it actually doesn't impact the EtH price at all because the ether that's being burnt is like, literally the most elastic portion of the Eth supply. It's the most flexible. That actually doesn't impact the price. But what it does do in the future is that it'll prevent price drops in the future. Right.
00:18:44.740 - 00:19:17.726, Speaker B: And this is actually set a floor. It's helping set a floor. Right. And so in the future, especially in the long term future, and this is actually what I said in my original EIP 1559 article, is that it's paying like EIP 1559 when it burns etH. It's like Ethereum putting security in a rainy day fund. Right. When there does come a time of high stress environments, that reduction in sell pressure, because we've been burning it for the past one, 2510 years, there's just simply less ETH available to sell.
00:19:17.726 - 00:19:29.810, Speaker B: And so one of his takeaways, which, again, is up for interpretation, is that during future volatility events, the downside should be dampened as a function of how much total ETH was burned.
00:19:30.150 - 00:19:48.422, Speaker A: Yeah. That's why I say full circle. It goes back, every day that ETH is burned is a day that I am bullish. And that's long term bullish. I can't tell you what's going to happen in the short run, but long term, this is a secular trend. I mean, we passed a billion dollars worth of ETH burnt. Right? Over 300,000 ETH today.
00:19:48.476 - 00:19:50.298, Speaker B: We actually passed 400,000.
00:19:50.464 - 00:20:07.198, Speaker A: 400,000 today. Right. And so this pressure is just going to keep compounding on Ethereum. Then you get the merge, everything bankless listers knows. We don't have to belabor that point. But bullish, I'm glad someone has done some deep diving on EIP 15. Five, nine.
00:20:07.198 - 00:20:21.310, Speaker A: David. Let's also talk about DyDX. That was a story with some numbers in the market section. We love to talk about numbers. This is Antonio. Antonio is a founder of DyDX. He's going to actually be coming on the podcast on Tuesday.
00:20:21.310 - 00:20:32.200, Speaker A: Right. So he says, five years, I left Coinbase. I remember when he tweeted that he left Coinbase and he eventually founded DydX. Today, DyDx is doing more trade volume than.
00:20:34.410 - 00:20:47.654, Speaker B: Yeah, just what is a moment of reflection? Five years. That's what it takes, five years for a Defi protocol to get built and then do more volume than the company that originally hired the guy. Like, wow, that's crazy. Congratulations, Antonio.
00:20:47.782 - 00:21:02.910, Speaker A: Yeah, it's huge. Antonio, so looking forward to talking to you soon. And this is the market share. This is a graph of the market share of DYDX. They're up to 27% market share of Dex volume changes.
00:21:03.060 - 00:21:05.498, Speaker B: Right? Yeah, Dex volume. Right.
00:21:05.684 - 00:21:15.854, Speaker A: And this includes some of the sillier dexes, like pancake swap and that sort of thing too. So actually even higher than that, probably in terms of real Dex volume. Totally.
00:21:15.982 - 00:21:37.386, Speaker B: And the other cool thing is this is the second decentralized exchange app to pass coinbase in volume. Uniswap being the first, I'm pretty sure Coinbase actually over time has done more volume and sustains itself as the leader over time. Hey, breaking it over a 24 hours period or even a seven day period, which Uniswap has done, is just the first step.
00:21:37.568 - 00:22:01.886, Speaker A: Yeah, well, DYDX is doing a lot of things right, right. So like perpetuals is a fantastic product. Everybody loves that. They were one of the first to roll out on L2. So under the hood this is all ZK roll up technology. Right. And also I think what's given them steroids, some extra juice, is kind of their token rollout and the token launch which they're using for liquidity mining.
00:22:01.886 - 00:22:08.510, Speaker A: But you have an alternate theory as well as to why it's gained so much traction recently. Tell us about that, David.
00:22:08.670 - 00:22:39.822, Speaker B: I think these theories are definitely paired. Like everyone likes tokens and when tokens exist, they attract a lot of attention towards the app. But also at the same time, we have China banning crypto. And apparently it's real this time. And the reason why we know it's real is because we can see chinese actors actually making decisions to exchanges, exchanges like outflows. You can actually see this in the blockchain, right, which is like the ultimate source of truth. And that is the clear differentiator between this China band and the infinity other China bands that we've seen.
00:22:39.822 - 00:23:39.950, Speaker B: And so there was speculation that all of this demand out of all these chinese exchanges to trade and speculate and do exchange things has gone from these chinese exchanges to DYDX to a trustless DFI exchange, which operates on a similar performance level because of the L2 as the exchanges that they are fleeing from. And so I think the big takeaway here is that when a nation state like China comes and bans crypto, where do they go? They don't go to another alternative like more western centralized exchange. They go to DFI. Right, because they just got, quote unquote censored. And so they're not going to go onto another censorable platform, they're going to go onto a DFI platform. And so there's an article here out of coin Telegraph that says the DyDX token gains 80% in a week. What's driving the Dex token rally and their subline is traders raised their bids for the decentralized exchange token, believing as it would benefit from China's decision to classify all crypto transactions as illegal.
00:23:39.950 - 00:23:51.126, Speaker B: And so there's speculation that people are moving on to DYDX in order to escape China, which just makes sense, like go on to the censorship resistance platform after you get censored by your nation state. That's what they're for.
00:23:51.308 - 00:24:14.190, Speaker A: Well, yeah, there's sort of a crypto narrative for you. It's like China ban equals bullish for DeFi, bullish banning. That could be what's happening. Love that man, love that. I think that could be what's happening, David. Let's also explore another trend that's happening. And this is the trend to total locked value in the multi chain, as people say.
00:24:14.190 - 00:25:01.370, Speaker A: So this is interesting. This is a plot of market cap of Ethereum and a number of other chains. And obviously we've seen sort of a alternate L2 kind of resurgence with I guess binance earlier in the year and then Solana and Avalanche more recently starting to really increase in market cap. And this is interesting when you look at a market share perspective, but I think it's actually more interesting to look at from a total locked value perspective. Right. So Ethereum dominance has dropped from 84% of total locked to value to 77%. So it's down I guess 7%.
00:25:01.370 - 00:25:30.886, Speaker A: Right. And then finance has gone down a little bit. Salana has gone up from about 1% to 5%. Terra has gone up a little bit. Avalanche has gone from basically nothing to 2% in phantom as well. I want to get your take on what do you make of this? Is total locked value? Is it moving into these other ecosystems? And is that to the detriment of Ethereum? What does that mean for the space? Is that bullish alternative layer ones? What do you think?
00:25:30.988 - 00:26:31.302, Speaker B: Yeah, so the take here, and we've been saying this for forever now, is like during bull markets, Ethereum's capacity gets consumed and there's overflowing demand that Ethereum cannot satisfy because it has not done like layer one, sharding. And the l two ecosystem is about as nascent as the alternative l one ecosystem. So when there's overflow for Ethereum main chain demand, when gas fees exceed $100 a transfer, people need to go elsewhere. So some go to L2 s, some go to other l ones. And so what we're seeing here is that the crypto industry has done a fantastic job bringing new people in, and a lot of new people don't want to or simply can't transact on the Ethereum l one, so they go elsewhere. The interesting story here to me is the lack of consensus as to where else to go, right? So finance smart chain was like the first app, the first other alternative l one to absorb some of Ethereum's overflow. But we've seen that actually go down this week.
00:26:31.302 - 00:27:15.000, Speaker B: While Salana, Terra, avalanche and Phantom have all gone up, there doesn't seem to be a clear consensus as like, oh, Ethereum is full. Here's where we go next. Everyone's just going everywhere, right? And antiprosynthesis one of like, he's probably the only person that will actually accept the ETH maxi label willingly has tweeted out this one tweet, which I really, really like, is like, if you ask what alternative l one is going to kill Ethereum, you'll get 10,000 different answers because there actually isn't a viable the next second place to Ethereum, right? There's just like five third places. And that's why you don't see any of the overflow to Ethereum going into one specific blockchain. They're all kind of getting spread out.
00:27:15.610 - 00:27:34.910, Speaker A: I remember when Rao Paul came on the podcast and he mentioned briefly about Ethereum dominance going down from its highs, right? In terms of total locked value, he's like, yeah, it'll probably decrease from 85% to 75%, maybe 70%, but that's still.
00:27:34.980 - 00:27:38.558, Speaker B: A lot, especially when everything is ten xing, right?
00:27:38.644 - 00:28:25.694, Speaker A: Yeah. It's basically sort of a prediction of power law winners in the space, which I tend to kind of agree with. But I have another take on this too, which is like, I think actually, David, total locked value can be a flawed metric in some ways, and made this point in an article that I wrote in 2020 on bankless, talking about trustless economic bandwidth versus economic bandwidth that is more trusted. And what I meant by that is it is more valuable from a bankless and decentralization perspective to have capital on chain, which I call economic bandwidth. So value on chain that doesn't have any outside trust dependencies, right?
00:28:25.892 - 00:28:28.974, Speaker B: Which is the whole point of this whole thing, right?
00:28:29.012 - 00:29:26.470, Speaker A: So if you're looking at USDC versus Dai, right, Dai is better. It's more trustless because it has less trust guarantees and it has less USDC inside of it's backed by other things, like ETH, for example. And if you look at another asset on chain, like rye, which is fully backed by ETH, that is less trusted still. And if you look at ETH in and of itself. That is the most trustless asset on Ethereum, right? And so what we miss, when we look at just pure total locked value, total value locked is we miss whether this is like actual trustless value or whether it's just some kind of a stable coin. We also miss the settlement guarantees of the chain, right? So if we wanted to look at this and put another, I guess, column here, we could look at the Coinbase side chain, right? What's Coinbase? It's a ledger. It's a side chain.
00:29:26.470 - 00:30:15.210, Speaker A: It has one validator. And that is like the Coinbase database organization, AWS servers, but it has like shareholders, right? It has Dao participants. Anyone who owns Coin shares, I guess, has governance vote over it, right? So why not include them from a total locked value perspective? Well, you don't, because we don't call that deFi. But there is this scale, right? Ethereum is the most decentralized Defi platform. Coinbase is not decentralized at all. And some of these chains are like somewhat in the middle. And I think a lot of this starts to look a bit more like a phantom, for example, or a terra, for example, or even a polygon and sidechain example looks a bit more like fintech and a bit less like permissionless, trustless deFi.
00:30:15.210 - 00:30:38.998, Speaker A: That's why I think total locked value can be misleading. Are we talking about trusted total locked value, or are we talking about purely trustless total locked value? The trustless is the stuff that I care about and the stuff that is, I think, the most sustainable and fits the protocol sync thesis of being the most permanent and foundational for this whole operation. That explained that.
00:30:39.084 - 00:31:51.834, Speaker B: Does that make sense? A hundred percent. And if listeners want to dive more into this, I highly recommend reading the article from Nick Carter called it's the settlement assurances stupid. Or if you want to consume something out of bankless, there is a talk I gave at ethereal called settlement assurances and the protocol sync thesis, and it describes this spectrum of just like not all, when you make a transaction on a blockchain, they're not all created equal, right? Not all transactions are equally as trustless or equally have as strong settlement assurances, right? So, like, when you send a litecoin transaction, litecoin blocks happen every 2.5 minutes. Does that mean when that block finalizes on litecoin that you have as the same amount of settlement insurances as when you do when you make a transaction on bitcoin? No, absolutely not. Those are different levels of settlement assurances, therefore different levels of trustlessness and each one of these blockchains are on that same sort of spectrum. How strong are the assurances that you have when you make a transaction that that transaction actually settles? And the answer to this question needs to go into the architecture of the actual blockchain itself, but also the asset that you are also transferring.
00:31:51.834 - 00:32:24.966, Speaker B: Right? And so if you send USDC both of those things. It's both of those things. If I send Ryan USDC on Ethereum, well, actually, did it really settle or not is actually not really related to the architecture of Ethereum or any other blockchain that's on, because you're actually trusting circle to actually be this final arbiter of final settlement. Right? And so these are very nuanced subjects. And this is a new concept for you. Settlement highly and highly. Encourage you to go read it's the settlement insurances, stupid by Nick Carter.
00:32:24.966 - 00:32:35.034, Speaker B: And then also the settlement insurances and the protocol sync thesis video, which is on the ETH, ethereal, YouTube. And then there's also some things. I will put them in the show notes as well.
00:32:35.072 - 00:32:59.134, Speaker A: Yeah, that's it. We'll just do you guys a favor and put some of this stuff in the show notes. But it does require. The last thing I'll say on this is this, David, is I don't think this is a zero sum game either. Right? Like more value, more eyeballs, more entrance into you. Whether it's a more centralized side chain or some alternative layer one, it's all good for the space. It's all good for Ethereum.
00:32:59.134 - 00:33:26.154, Speaker A: I think it's all good for bitcoin, right? People often think that this is some sort of a tribal game where there's going to be big losers and big winners. But even like, look, man, Ethereum is good for bitcoin. Bitcoin maximalists don't know it, but it is. You think bitcoin would be above 40k if not for Ethereum? Hell no. Absolutely no chance. Right? And it works the other way too. Ethereum wouldn't even been possible about bitcoin.
00:33:26.154 - 00:33:40.018, Speaker A: So none of this, guys is a zero sum game either. This is all going to be good. And we think the most decentralized protocols eventually will sink to the bottom, win the most market share and be the most dominant. And that's a good thing if that happens.
00:33:40.184 - 00:34:12.106, Speaker B: Well, he actually even goes even further than that. Right? So, like when you have a maximally decentralized protocol, you can build centralized stuff on top of that, you can compromise on decentralization later. Right? And so another article and also a bankless podcast. I think number five is called the two faces of Ethereum, or the Defi risk spectrum, or the DeFi trust spectrum. The cool thing about maximizing decentralization is it allows you to compromise on decentralization later. Right. But you have to get decentralization first.
00:34:12.106 - 00:34:19.678, Speaker B: And so if you want to build a centralized permission side chain on Ethereum, you can do that. Right? You have that option available.
00:34:19.764 - 00:34:21.070, Speaker A: You can't do the opposite.
00:34:21.410 - 00:34:23.920, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. You can't put the car.
00:34:24.370 - 00:34:30.466, Speaker A: Yeah. You can't build ethereum on the sidechain. Absolutely. Guys. Well, we got excited about that Porsche. We got to keep moving on.
00:34:30.648 - 00:34:33.154, Speaker B: I wonder why our roll ups last so long.
00:34:33.352 - 00:34:46.306, Speaker A: I have no idea. Hopefully you guys enjoy them. We definitely enjoy doing so. All right, well, this is. What's a graphic that caught my eye. This is from coin metrics. Their newsletter is fantastic, by the way, comes out weekly.
00:34:46.306 - 00:35:02.062, Speaker A: But this is a chart of the uniswap, three trading pairs. And you can see the various assets that are trading with. You see tether, you see USDC, you see die. But this big pink cloud that you're seeing, that's all eth, right?
00:35:02.116 - 00:35:04.314, Speaker B: Trustless economic bandwidth.
00:35:04.442 - 00:35:34.114, Speaker A: Trustless economic bandwidth on Ethereum. And I think the position, what this graph is really showing us is on Ethereum, and I think in general, across DeFi, ETH is positioning itself and becoming positioned by default to be the reserve asset of DeFi. Right. This is back to that narrative we talked about, reserve asset of nfTs. Talk about reserve asset of the metaverse, even, which is kind of a newer thing. But back to the reserve asset of DeFi. It's bearing out on the graphics.
00:35:34.114 - 00:35:42.694, Speaker A: That's what Uniswap is using as its primary trading pair, and that's a great thing for decentralization. Any other follow ups on that, David?
00:35:42.742 - 00:35:45.738, Speaker B: No, I think this actually fits in right into the conversation we were just.
00:35:45.824 - 00:36:03.970, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Okay, last thing for you on the market side of things, pretty big milestone for polygon. Again, this is their sidechain solution, the proof of stake type solution, but they just eclipsed Ethereum layer one in daily active addresses for the very first time.
00:36:04.040 - 00:36:30.534, Speaker B: Okay, so this is a great illustration of why it's actually valuable to compromise on decentralization, because you can scale better that way. Centralization actually scales really far because you've actually compromised on decentralization. But because matic, because polygon is built on Ethereum, they get to give all of their users the ability to exit into the more trustless, into the more decentralized version of the universe.
00:36:30.582 - 00:36:30.842, Speaker A: Right.
00:36:30.896 - 00:36:40.150, Speaker B: So you can get more scale by reducing decentralization. But once you hook into Ethereum, you also get the benefits of Ethereum.
00:36:40.310 - 00:37:08.034, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. And look, this is not a new idea either. We just call them sidechains and this sort of thing now. But where did you guys start your crypto journey? I bet it was on an exchange, a centralized exchange, which is a side chain, which then you then exited to continue the DFI world. Same thing is happening here. But anyway, I think a lot of users will start their journeys on, obviously, exchanges on sidechains and on L2s. And that's where we're going to see the user growth.
00:37:08.034 - 00:37:25.034, Speaker A: We'll probably see the capital growth on main net, but the user growth will happen on these L2s and side chains 100%. All right, David, last thing. Total locked value in tracer just exceeded $20 million. So it's super cool. And I know you did a meet the nation with them. When's that coming out?
00:37:25.072 - 00:37:47.566, Speaker B: That's coming out Monday at 12:00 p.m. Eastern time. 12:00 p.m. Eastern time. It walks us through the history of tracer Dow. They have one of the most interesting genesis stories I've ever heard, as well as where the team actually got the expertise, where they got the idea, what their roadmap is, and where they are going. So if you want to learn more about one of the most promising young daos that I've ever seen, check out tracer.
00:37:47.598 - 00:37:48.658, Speaker A: Dao. Yeah.
00:37:48.744 - 00:37:49.858, Speaker B: On the Meet the nation, on the.
00:37:49.864 - 00:38:02.214, Speaker A: Bankless YouTube building on arbitram perpetuals protocol. You've heard us talk about it in previous roll ups as well. All right, guys, we are going to be back with the releases for the week, but before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:38:02.412 - 00:38:38.174, Speaker B: Bankless is proud to be supported by Uniswap. Uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure. Instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans, Uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on Ethereum, which is what Ryan and I call a money robot. No human counterparties or centralized intermediaries, just autonomous code on ethereum. Input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy. Something brand new in the Uniswap ecosystem is the Uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants. We have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again.
00:38:38.174 - 00:39:06.202, Speaker B: Daos have money and they are in need of labor. If you think that you have something to contribute to the Uniswap Dow, apply for a grant to Uniswap. Just look at the size of the Uniswap treasury. It's almost $3 billion. This mountain of capital is looking for labor. Do you have something of value to contribute to the Uniswap Dow? No matter how big or small your idea is, you can apply for a Uni grant@unigrants.org and help steer Uniswap in the direction that you think it should go.
00:39:06.202 - 00:39:55.590, Speaker B: That's exactly what we did to get Uniswap to be a sponsor for bankless, and you can do the same for your project. Thank you Uniswap, for sponsoring bankless the era of proof of stake is upon us proof of stake systems like Ethereum, Terra and Solana allow the industry to move away from the hot, loud and wasteful proof of work systems and return back to a cottage industry of individual stakers and individual validators. And that is what we need to make this industry stay decentralized. Individuals must play their part in crypto network validation, and that is what Lido is here to do. Lido makes staking accessible to everyone at the click of a button. By delegating your stake to Lido's network of nodes, you can access the yield offered by proof of stake systems and claim your share of the network transaction rewards. Do you have 32 ETH and want to stake it to Ethereum? But running a node sounds intimidating.
00:39:55.590 - 00:40:27.618, Speaker B: Or maybe you have less than 32 ETH and you need to pool your ETH with others so you can access staking yields. Lido offers a solution for both. Simply go to lido fi, choose which assets you want to stake, and deposit them to the Lido validating network. Lido is working to make sure proof of stake stays as decentralized as possible and is committed to decentralizing its own validating network to eventually become a completely permissionless protocol. So if you want to stake your ETH, terra or Sol and get liquidity on your stake, go to Lido fi to get started.
00:40:27.784 - 00:40:54.974, Speaker A: Alright guys, we are back with the hot releases of the week. The first is this. David Kinext is launching an NXTP protocol, they say, to improve liquidity. Kinext, of course, is dealing with the kind of the Ethereum multi chain space. So the ability to transition and move seamlessly assets from, say, an arbitram to an optimism back to mainet without waiting for anything. It's kind of an interoperability protocol. What are they doing here?
00:40:55.092 - 00:41:41.274, Speaker B: Yeah, if you guys remember Ryan and I talking about hop protocol, it's very similar, just hopping assets between L2s. Connect has actually been in the Ethereum space for as long as I can remember, working on payment channels, which we all know is a very foundational, fundamental piece of technology. But it's kind of been a solution looking for a problem, because we used to think, oh, we'll scale Ethereum with payment channels. And then we forgot that, well, you don't have generalizability on payment channels. That's really, really hard. And so we have this awesome piece of technology led by Arjun, Bhutani and a bunch of other people working on payment channels. But now with this L2 ecosystem absolutely exploding, we actually now have the problem that we have the technology to solve for.
00:41:41.274 - 00:42:25.386, Speaker B: And so Kinex has been like reappropriating their already existing payment channel tech to span payment channels between all the different L2s. I think two weeks ago we shouted them out because they recently passed $500 million in volume over their NXTP protocol. But that was before they announced the main net, which is what they are announcing right here. So they have the NXTP protocol main net, which is going to help you live a life on L2 by bridging all the L2. So you never actually have to touch the Ethereum l one. They had a blog post forever ago announcing what they were building, and they had a fantastic meme called the l one is lava, as in like, you never actually have to touch the. Don't touch it.
00:42:25.386 - 00:42:36.590, Speaker B: Yeah. And so this is what it means to be a citizen, I think, in the whole global nexus of Ethereum, which is only if you want to do you have to actually go to the l one.
00:42:36.740 - 00:43:14.378, Speaker A: These bridges are super important, really essential infrastructure for the next wave here. Speaking of infrastructure, Andre, the founder of Wyron and YFI, of course, famous d five builder in the space, he is launching an NFT marketplace, or has launched an NFT marketplace, but the title of this article is a coinbase article says Andre's new NFT marketplace is a vampire attack suicide pact. Wow. What is that? That sounds like some hyperbole. He's going up against Opensea. I guess that's the vampire part of this. What's your take here and what does this mean?
00:43:14.464 - 00:44:01.014, Speaker B: Well, I think after Opensea had that drama with the insider trading employee who they have since let go, everyone has been asking like, hey, wait a second, Opensea, it's not a Dap, it's not an application, it's a company. And so now there's been some attention on decentralized marketplaces, peer to peer marketplaces for nfts. And so Andre, in his tweet that we're watching here, he's demoing what very much looks like an openc type format, but apparently it's a P two P version of that. It's also built on Phantom, apparently, which Andre Cronier is a big fan of, but he's also built other things on Phantom. Before that. He ultimately just ports to Ethereum because that's where all the users are. And the title of this piece, the vampire tack, is alluding to like, well, Opensea doesn't have a token.
00:44:01.014 - 00:44:36.754, Speaker B: And we all know what happens when something that doesn't have a token gets forked and then a token is added before that original token exists. Right? We saw this with the sushiswap drama. That's how sushiswap came into existence in the first place. It vampire attacked Uniswap before Uniswap had a token. And so the idea is that this new NFT marketplace is, in theory going to get a lot of adoption if it can find a way to vampire attack Opensea. Opensea's code is not open source and verifiable, so I think that makes it a little bit more difficult to actually do that. I'm not a coder, so I don't know.
00:44:36.754 - 00:44:49.270, Speaker B: But I'm pretty sure that's true. But either way, the incentive to vampire attack Opensea before it has a token is really, really strong. We were actually recording with Devin Finzer tomorrow, Friday.
00:44:50.170 - 00:44:51.266, Speaker A: Today's Thursday.
00:44:51.378 - 00:44:59.770, Speaker B: And so I'm actually going to ask him about this, asking this question. It's like, yeah, wait a devin, like, how are you guys going to have a moat if you don't have a token?
00:45:00.190 - 00:45:22.900, Speaker A: Yeah. The other important piece here, of course, is they're going to be expanding each chain, but this is all open source as well. So Andre is going to release this as an open source project. But in general, I love competition like this, David, because I think it leads to better user experience, better products, cheaper products for the end customer. So vampire tax, bring them on. It's great. It just ups our game.
00:45:22.900 - 00:46:02.922, Speaker A: Let's talk about this, David. Coinbase just released a direct deposit feature. So this allows users to get paychecks in crypto. It's not what you've always wanted. If you're like working in a corporation, getting a paycheck in crypto, in USDC, or maybe some slice of that in bitcoin. Or eth, maybe the bed index someday, rather than getting it into your Wells Fargo account. How much more convenient is that? Looks like Coinbase is making a play there, and it's fulfilling sort of some speculation that we've had in the very early days of bankless, that all of these exchanges would slowly transform into banks.
00:46:02.922 - 00:46:11.554, Speaker A: We called them crypto banks in the early days. And this is the next checkmark, right? Oh, direct deposit, just like a bank. Yep, we're doing it. What's your take?
00:46:11.752 - 00:46:58.210, Speaker B: First off, much better banks. Let's divide a line between upgraded banks, upgraded banks, like crypto powered, crypto enabled banks, and we're going to talk about this later. But the more and more that Coinbase becomes a bank, the more and more it threatens all the other banking institutions out there, which, according to, I think some of the incumbents will be argued. It presents a systemic risk. Right? Like, if Coinbase is literally so successful that it sucks up all the deposits of the other banks, the other banks are literally in trouble, and they are very, very integrated into the rest of the financial system. So this is probably causing a bunch of concern from all the boomer banks out there that aren't crypto powered while they watch Coinbase just, like, run circles around them when it comes to innovation and just consumer benefits.
00:46:58.360 - 00:47:16.278, Speaker A: Look, it's not just us saying this. This is exactly what Kathy Wood told us when we had her from Arkinvest on the podcast a few weeks ago. She's like, hey, you're seeing this ugly regulation because the banks are scared. Like, they're pushing on the regulators to go do something in defi and crypto, and maybe that's what we're seeing, endgame type stuff.
00:47:16.364 - 00:47:36.526, Speaker B: I think if I never have to touch Wells Fargo again, I can get all of my basic financial services out of Coinbase, which are so basic, by the way. I just need direct deposit, which they just enabled, and then just the ability to transfer money and pay my credit cards. There is not very many steps left before I just have to fundamentally question why I keep my Wells Fargo account.
00:47:36.628 - 00:47:57.890, Speaker A: Oh, David, we've got some more shade on Wells Fargo coming to this podcast. Wait to the news section, my friend. Wells Fargo, get ready. All right. USDC as well has been enabled in Angellist. So Angel list is a very popular kind of angel investing platform. And now they are enabling not just fiat, but USDC.
00:47:57.890 - 00:48:19.914, Speaker A: So this is another step for USDC to gain some traction in kind of the emerging fintech space, which is also awesome. Speaking of fintech and Defi, mullet type stories. We got fintech in the front and defi in the back. Affirm. Have you ever used a firm? They're like a fintech type product, but they like split payments or. No, they delay payments, right?
00:48:19.952 - 00:48:24.846, Speaker B: Yeah. So they turn some one expensive purchase into like a monthly thing that you can pay for over time.
00:48:24.948 - 00:49:03.046, Speaker A: Okay. I hate those things personally, but I understand that it's an interesting product, and clearly they have some adoption. What's interesting about this story is they're kind of pivoting to Defi. Not entirely pivoting, but they are rolling out debit cards that allow customers to buy and sell crypto directly from savings accounts as a product. So I think it's interesting here is they've got some traction product market fit with their single killer app feature. Right. And now where are they looking for the green space opportunity? Well, it's all crypto, and they appeal to millennials, Gen Z, sort of that demographic.
00:49:03.046 - 00:49:22.622, Speaker A: Guess who likes crypto? Same demographic. This is the Defi mullet thesis playing out where fintech companies start building on top of decentralized protocols. And I'm here for it. Man, I love this stuff. We're going to see more and more of this stuff throughout the year and throughout the years to come.
00:49:22.756 - 00:49:48.082, Speaker B: It's kind of interesting that the crypto thing about their new product has nothing to do with the core business. But that's also kind of cool, right? It doesn't even matter. It's just they think it's valuable enough that they're doing it anyways. And the more and more we can get companies to do this, the more and more crypto gets integrated into our actual economy, our fintech economy, our existing economy, the harder and harder it is for regulators to gut that stuff out after it already gets integrated.
00:49:48.226 - 00:50:11.838, Speaker A: It's a heat shield for the regulatory heat for sure, when we have more adoption like this. Dave, this is interesting, too. So I guess the index co op folks are creating a polygon indices, right? It's called PDI. This sounds like it's an asset that you hold that invests in a whole bunch of polygon assets, like Polygon apps and this sort of thing.
00:50:12.004 - 00:50:23.186, Speaker B: It's like the Polygon app layer token. So if you want to not only bet on Polygon by buying Matic, you can also bet on the Polygon app layer by buying the Polygon diversified index from index co op.
00:50:23.288 - 00:50:55.982, Speaker A: That's really cool. I was curious where index would grow. And looks like they're pressing into all of these interesting spaces. David, last thing for the week Nami is a L2 scaling effort as well. I don't know too much about Nami, but they have just announced 8 million in funding led by Dharma Partners and they are supposedly bringing some eth scalability to L2. It's kind of an optimistic roll up type approach, plus some state channels. But I don't know much about this project.
00:50:55.982 - 00:50:56.862, Speaker A: Any takes here?
00:50:56.916 - 00:51:10.018, Speaker B: Yeah, I also don't know much about it. It seems to be coming out of left field for me. A couple of people I've talked to have had some grumblings about being just a little bit unsure as to what the product actually is. I think it's going to be a.
00:51:10.024 - 00:51:24.290, Speaker A: Wait and see for me. Yeah, absolutely. But that is out now. Let's talk about raises. David. The big raise of the week, I think is this social token raise with the roll protocol. So we've been talking about social token infrastructure.
00:51:24.290 - 00:51:45.120, Speaker A: It's starting to attract more and more capital. They just raised role, raised $10 million. And roll is kind of like this social money experiment, would you say? It allows people with followings communities to issue their own token in easy ways. You don't have to deal with smart contracts and fork code. They just make the whole thing easy. Any takes here?
00:51:46.050 - 00:52:01.794, Speaker B: My take is that actually, I think social tokens and dow tokens are actually kind of closer than what people think. These things aren't very well defined and I think we're only going to define them as they get more and more used and more and more built out.
00:52:01.912 - 00:52:17.926, Speaker A: And so stay tuned. This goes back to like thousands and thousands and tens of thousands and millions eventually of tokens are coming, right? I don't know that regulators are prepared for that world either, but they're coming. Like it or not, the regulators are.
00:52:17.948 - 00:52:20.162, Speaker B: Waiting for them to show up at their door to ask permission.
00:52:20.306 - 00:52:30.990, Speaker A: Yeah. Last thing for you guys before we get into the news is jobs. This is your weekly reminder. Get a job. Get a job for a dow. Go work for crypto. Go do your part.
00:52:30.990 - 00:53:01.094, Speaker A: We've got a community manager role from Aragorn. I'm Lord of the Reed. This is like Aragon and also a founding blockchain engineer at Highlight, a senior software programmer from Popcorn, community lead from Popcorn as well, senior front end web developer for Tracer Dao. In addition, I don't know. There's dozens more of jobs on this board. So if you are looking for a job in crypto, best way to get it is on the bankless job board. Go check that out.
00:53:01.094 - 00:53:02.850, Speaker A: We'll include a link in the show notes.
00:53:03.010 - 00:53:07.906, Speaker B: And I bet you a decent number of those jobs come with tokens. And everyone likes tokens.
00:53:08.018 - 00:53:14.970, Speaker A: Never know. Never know. All right, guys, news time. David, what are our news headlines for the week? What are we going to talk about?
00:53:15.040 - 00:53:57.606, Speaker B: Yeah, coming up first, we're going to lead with the fun stuff is nfts on Twitter. Yay. So if you have an NFT that you think is especially cute, or your crypto punk that you think is especially cool, you can now prove to the rest of Twitter that is literally something that you do actually own instead of just right click saving it. And so that's pretty cool. Ethereum has found its way into the depths of Twitter and is doing it with nfts. I've been saying this a bunch of times on the bankless program, and I'll say it again, NFTs are how Ethereum markets itself to the rest of the world is literally Ethereum's marketing surface area. It's the social flexing aspect of things and it's also the verifiable aspect of things.
00:53:57.606 - 00:54:31.070, Speaker B: And so, Ryan, you got a tweet here that you tweeted out saying Twitter should roll out a blue checkmark for NFT profile picks. Just validate them against Ethereum. Every social network will be doing this. It's the most obvious feature ad ever. And that came in August 29, which was a month ago. And then just recently, we have a developer at Twitter teasing what an NFT verified profile might actually look like. And so that involves actually syncing up your address with some of the various options that we all know and love, like metamask, coinbase, wallet, trustwallet, argent.
00:54:31.070 - 00:54:39.474, Speaker B: And if you have an NFT in those addresses that you link, you can sign a transaction to verify you own a NFT.
00:54:39.602 - 00:54:55.018, Speaker A: That's pretty cool. This is awesome, man. This is exactly what crypto wanted. This is exactly it. All we wanted was for Twitter to authenticate and verify our nfts as profile pictures on the platform. Right? And here they are. They're doing it.
00:54:55.184 - 00:55:01.782, Speaker B: Look at that little eth logo right next to the profile picture. Yeah. Do you think Jack's going to allow that to make it into the production version?
00:55:01.846 - 00:55:05.278, Speaker A: Yes. It's not an Ethiopia flag. Right? It's the ETh logo this time.
00:55:05.444 - 00:55:06.586, Speaker B: Checkmate. Jack.
00:55:06.698 - 00:55:41.058, Speaker A: It's kind of cool that they'll differentiate on what chain you own this thing, right? Because somebody could create a crypto punk clone on some other chain and it wouldn't be the same thing, right? So, yeah, this is exactly what crypto needs. I think this will add massive legitimacy for nfts. I think this is going to add value to nfts. I also think every single social media platform is going to follow in their footsteps. Right? Like Twitter is the lead here. Then next is going to be Instagram, like Facebook, TikTok, everybody's going to follow this trend. No one cannot.
00:55:41.058 - 00:55:58.222, Speaker A: Now that Twitter is rolling this out, they're probably already working on it, David. Right. Like when I tweeted this out in know I was just thinking about it was just like a shower thought like, wouldn't that be cool? They were working on it at the time. Obviously. It's a very obvious feature for these social network platforms. Web.
00:55:58.276 - 00:56:00.718, Speaker B: I don't know, Ryan. I think they took your tweet and they ran with it. I think.
00:56:00.724 - 00:56:05.920, Speaker A: You think? So I've been tweeting Jack to do lots of things on Ethereum and this is the only.
00:56:06.450 - 00:56:26.502, Speaker B: Listen to every single one. I swear to God. He just picks and chooses and at the same time, I'm going to front run this. We were going to talk about this later, but I'm going to talk about it right now. You can now also tip on Twitter with bitcoin. This is the other bitcoin thing that they integrated as well. And so I'm looking forward to seeing the data as to what comes out.
00:56:26.502 - 00:56:28.534, Speaker B: What do you think is going to be used more?
00:56:28.652 - 00:56:41.514, Speaker A: I know what I think, dude. I think people don't want to spend their bitcoin. They want to flash their nfts. They don't want to spend their bitcoin. One's going to have product market fit. The other is barely going to do anything, unfortunately. It's great.
00:56:41.552 - 00:56:44.620, Speaker B: But payments on bitcoin, we've tried this before.
00:56:45.330 - 00:56:48.446, Speaker A: We've been trying it since the inception of crypto. Right.
00:56:48.628 - 00:56:50.670, Speaker B: People don't care about payments.
00:56:52.770 - 00:57:05.918, Speaker A: Anyway. All right, let's talk China. David, sad face. Okay, I guess stuff getting real in China. We've had bans before. This time maybe it's different. We had saw Hill on the podcast.
00:57:05.918 - 00:57:15.814, Speaker A: If you guys missed that earlier this week, go check out our state of the nation with Sawhill, where we cover this in depth. But what's the high level take here? What are they banning? What does this mean for us?
00:57:15.932 - 00:57:48.210, Speaker B: Yeah. So what are they banning is a little bit kind of up in the air. I think it's more related to actual businesses. So if you are helping facilitate crypto transactions, then that's bad. But there's a little bit of speculation that simply holding crypto and owning crypto is still okay. It's going to be one of those things where we're just going to have to find out after the fact. Chinese regulators, they kind of get to do whatever they want, right? And so they will interpret their own laws in ways that will benefit them by their choosing.
00:57:48.210 - 00:58:29.118, Speaker B: But as far as being a business in China, you are shutting down, basically, is what's going on. And not only are businesses inside of China, but businesses that are serving chinese customers are also restricting access to their platforms to chinese customers. So we've seen mining pools not allow chinese miners. We see exchanges that are based in China with a lot of chinese customers, have extreme outflows. And this is why we know that this ban is real, because we are actually seeing on chain verifiable data and decisions being made by companies that are in China or relating to chinese customers actually change their policies. So it's kind of like the easiest tell ever to figure out. Oh, yeah, this one's actually real.
00:58:29.284 - 00:58:45.182, Speaker A: Yeah. Huobi, which is a large exchange based in China, they are getting rid of. If you're a chinese citizen and you're on Huobi, you have to exit, you have to leave. Right. They're blocking them all from their platform. That's going to phase out. Also, you mentioned outflows, David.
00:58:45.182 - 00:58:59.206, Speaker A: There was a coinbase chart that just showed, like, Ethan, bitcoin outflows from Huobi over the last few months. But then on the news of this, and it was just like this single red spike down, right.
00:58:59.388 - 00:59:01.450, Speaker B: Exit all chinese exchanges.
00:59:02.270 - 00:59:19.422, Speaker A: Largest decrease ever. Now, to some of your thoughts. Earlier, we're talking about maybe some of this is going to end up in Defi. Like this capital has got to go somewhere. China's just squeezing the balloon. They're squeezing it outside of their borders, outside of their regulated exchanges. Seems like a short sighted move, but it's going somewhere else.
00:59:19.422 - 00:59:51.746, Speaker A: Maybe it's going to Defi, maybe it's going to us exchanges, maybe it's going to the binances of the world, but they don't want it in their jurisdiction. This is also something that I noticed this week, David, is they blocked Coingecko, Coinmarketcap and Tradingview. It's all blocked in China now. So great firewall. Of course, you can vpn around that, I guess, but this is now more censorship of Defi, maybe a direct attack on Defi and crypto to make these websites blocked in China. It's the first time they've been blocked.
00:59:51.778 - 01:00:17.694, Speaker B: Ever, as we all know. You actually can't ban crypto you can only ban your own citizens from touching crypto. And so crypto, it's still actually in China. It's just now illegal for you as a chinese citizen to actually touch it. And that's an important distinction and an important takeaway. I mean, how much can China, they've already banned video games, apparently. So how much is China actually going to ban before their citizens are just fed up with it? I mean, it's China.
01:00:17.694 - 01:00:20.930, Speaker B: So the answer is like a lot. But there's a tipping point somewhere.
01:00:21.590 - 01:00:53.290, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. And I think they're just going to, many citizens are just going to not listen. Right. They'll just find other avenues and ways of doing this and move capital the way they want to. All right, those are the three. Well, actually, the third item that we wanted to talk about, I think we should save to the end of this, David, because that's kind of a deep, sober topic. Virgil Griffith, an Ethereum developer, was pled guilty, just pled guilty on Monday to some charges.
01:00:53.290 - 01:00:58.090, Speaker A: We'll get into that in the detail, but first, let's talk about some happier subjects.
01:00:58.170 - 01:00:58.734, Speaker B: And I'm ready.
01:00:58.772 - 01:01:18.406, Speaker A: Back to Virgil Griffin. Happy for that. We're not ready for that. Okay, so let's talk about this on Ethereum news. This $23 million fee. So Bitfinex paid a $23 million fee accidentally, I believe, in just kind of a routine type of transaction. What happened here?
01:01:18.508 - 01:01:30.786, Speaker B: Yeah. So what happened here was they swapped out the send value with the gas fee value. And so how much they wanted to send, they actually accidentally put into how much gas they were willing to pay. Oopsies.
01:01:30.898 - 01:01:31.910, Speaker A: Have you ever done that?
01:01:31.980 - 01:01:33.274, Speaker B: I have not done that. No.
01:01:33.312 - 01:01:34.746, Speaker A: I've never done that either.
01:01:34.928 - 01:02:17.574, Speaker B: Things get really complicated when you're in an organization as large as Bitfinex and you're sending that much money, they're not using Metamask. Right. They're using their own proprietary software. And when you do that, and they were sending it on to diversify the ZK proofs, L2. And something just went wrong in the transaction. Fortunately, 99% of the time, transactions go to a centralized mining pool, and those mining pools are known individuals, and they don't miss when they just get a random $23 million transaction. So that transaction actually got sent back because, hey, you can just go knock on a centralized company's email address saying, hey, we accidentally mailed you guys $23 million.
01:02:17.574 - 01:02:35.694, Speaker B: Can you send that back to us, please? And everyone knows who these people are. And so they sent it back. So the money ended up back in the right spot. But the lesson here is that L2 transfers have growing pains with them. We still have to nail down our protocols and harden our code. These are the early days of L2s and things go wrong every now and then.
01:02:35.892 - 01:02:44.674, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. I wonder what would happen if a validator in kind of e two received this amount of money and it was like an anonymous validator, right?
01:02:44.792 - 01:02:49.294, Speaker B: At that point you would just pray and pray that that person was altruistic.
01:02:49.422 - 01:03:13.494, Speaker A: Yeah. Here's your $23 million back. Wow, what a reward, though, as a validator to suddenly have that pop up. All right, let's talk about this. Ave, we've talked about this before, but the institutionalization of Defi, that's starting to happen. Ave, Arc is a platform on Ave. It's built on the same protocol, but it is open and primarily whitelisted and targeted towards large institutions.
01:03:13.494 - 01:03:17.702, Speaker A: Now they are gearing up for launch. Anything to talk about here, David?
01:03:17.846 - 01:03:34.818, Speaker B: Nothing other than the previous Fireblocks podcast episode that we did that talks about all this infrastructure that something like an institutional version of AAVe needs to support their institutional clients. This is a huge frontier that we are just now pulling the curtains back behind.
01:03:34.984 - 01:04:27.566, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's fine. It works on bankless. They just want some Kyc, right? They have to have that. And this institutional capital is kind of sitting dormant with low apys outside of Defi, and they want access to some of these yields, so this is a way to get them that access. Also, David, there was a blip, a scare in compound earlier this week, and I noticed that some people pinged me on discord. It's like, what is this? What's going on with compound? I was concerned at first that the worst was happening, which was maybe there's some kind of zero day bug in compound itself, and like, contracts are getting drained, right? Because so much of this industry is built on compound yield. But what actually happened was less severe.
01:04:27.566 - 01:04:28.178, Speaker A: What happened?
01:04:28.264 - 01:05:02.358, Speaker B: Yeah, so the actual bug was that the comp token, which is issued at a regular rate to all the people supplying or borrowing from the compound application. Over time, you get a trickle of comp to reward you for participating either on the supply or the demand side. What happened was that I believe there was an update to the comp controller, which controls the comp token like a week ago, and apparently people were allowed to claim more comp than they were actually supposed to be issued. And so this was more or less like an inflation bug in the comp token.
01:05:02.454 - 01:05:04.766, Speaker A: I don't think it was like comp token. None of the pool.
01:05:04.788 - 01:05:17.634, Speaker B: Just the comp token. Yeah, pools are fine. Deposits are fine. All funds are safe except for the comp token. Had a little bit more supply get sent out into the markets than was intended. I don't know how much more supply. Apparently it was actually a decent amount.
01:05:17.634 - 01:05:20.866, Speaker B: I think it was like $80 million. But other than that.
01:05:20.888 - 01:05:34.998, Speaker A: Yeah, a lot. Yeah, exactly. I think it was $80 million. I ran this calculation. Or 280,000 comp tokens that were released, which is the equivalent of about $80 million released into the wild. So not awesome.
01:05:35.084 - 01:05:43.322, Speaker B: Not awesome. But if you tell me that this is the bug that compound has, I'm like, okay, thank God. Jesus. It's okay.
01:05:43.376 - 01:05:53.786, Speaker A: I was super relieved to hear about this. And they'll get that fixed and upgraded, so I guess no big deal this time around. We got to wait for that.
01:05:53.888 - 01:05:56.030, Speaker B: Knocking on wood. Knock on wood.
01:05:56.450 - 01:06:22.502, Speaker A: You know what's cool here, too, David? Next bit of news is if you ever played Axio Infinity before October 26, 2020, check your wallet. This is Axio Infinity tweeting this out from their account. They just airdropped $60 million, 800,000 AXS tokens to their earliest gamers. Just a thank you. Like, just a reward here, Ogs. You believed in this when no one did. And so here's $60 million.
01:06:22.502 - 01:06:24.886, Speaker A: How freaking awesome is that?
01:06:24.988 - 01:06:26.326, Speaker B: Yeah, that's pretty crazy.
01:06:26.348 - 01:06:26.998, Speaker A: It's really cool.
01:06:27.084 - 01:06:44.614, Speaker B: I've seen people report they got $9,000. I heard another person report they got $16,000. I'm not sure the metrics as to how they distributed this to their players, but, like, $60 million to early players when there wasn't nearly as many players as there are today. That's a nice chunk of change, David.
01:06:44.662 - 01:06:55.858, Speaker A: We ran a post on Axio tactic, a how to on bankless, March 2020 that would have been well before this. If you did your bankless homework, you got some money from AXS. That's all I'm saying.
01:06:55.944 - 01:06:57.730, Speaker B: Brian, did you do your bankless homework?
01:06:58.950 - 01:07:01.330, Speaker A: My homework is to publish the post, David.
01:07:02.230 - 01:07:06.500, Speaker B: Okay. You give out the homework, you don't have to do it.
01:07:07.510 - 01:07:14.040, Speaker A: I mean, bankless is alpha. I'll just say that we have some more homework to do.
01:07:15.210 - 01:07:16.754, Speaker B: Can't take our own lessons.
01:07:16.882 - 01:07:54.466, Speaker A: Can't take our own lessons. Moving on, let's talk about the amount of ETH that is staked because it's absolutely colossal amount at this point, almost 8 million ETH staked. So at current prices, Lido reports this. That's $22 billion worth of ETH backing the economic security of the beacon chain, which, of course, doesn't have state on it yet. Right? But will. And it's really cool to see this amount of values far more efficient than proof of work. If you guys listen to any of our Justin Drake episodes where we talk about, like, ultrasound money.
01:07:54.466 - 01:08:12.250, Speaker A: You've heard that meme for ETH, the asset. Wonder where it comes from. Came from Justin Drake episodes on Bankless, where he actually describes the economic efficiency and the importance of having a massive amount of money backing a network like Ethereum. Any other takes here?
01:08:12.320 - 01:08:42.718, Speaker B: Yeah, with ETH and ether, right? Two sides of the same coin. You have ultrasound money on the ether side, and you have ultra secure Ethereum on the Ethereum side. You like that one? And as we get closer and closer to the merge date, the number of how the dollar value, the capital measure of how much is staked on the beacon chain, on the future Ethereum chain is just making it safer and safer and safer. When we do port over, that's just more and more security towards DFI.
01:08:42.894 - 01:08:51.960, Speaker A: There was the myth at one point in time, David, I remember in the doldrums of 2018 2019 that the price of ETH doesn't matter.
01:08:52.810 - 01:08:56.200, Speaker B: That was so wrong. I have a button for that. I have a button.
01:08:58.810 - 01:09:00.314, Speaker A: Thank you. It deserves another one.
01:09:00.352 - 01:09:02.060, Speaker B: Please push that again, please.
01:09:02.750 - 01:09:17.280, Speaker A: That's how wrong it is. Now we know. Right now we can see, as we transition to proof of stake, it's becoming self evident that the value of ETH is the economic security of the network. Super important. Look at this slope up. Yes. Thank you.
01:09:17.280 - 01:09:23.680, Speaker A: This is ETH deposited over time, and it's just a nice curve up.
01:09:24.050 - 01:09:31.694, Speaker B: Does not go down at all well, I mean, it can't go down. So there's that, but it continues to stay. No, it can't, because it can't get withdrawn.
01:09:31.822 - 01:09:39.762, Speaker A: Well, I mean, we're still at 6.6% yield from staking, so still not a bad yield.
01:09:39.906 - 01:09:42.150, Speaker B: ETH denominated yield, 6.6%.
01:09:42.300 - 01:10:06.350, Speaker A: Eventually, this has got to drop to something like the risk free rate, right, which has got to be like three, 4%, something like that. So this is all playing out as expected. David, let's get into NFTs really quick. Snoop is getting into NFTs. We talked about it last time, but now he's actually got something going on in the metaverse. I see a snoop car here. I see what looks like a virtual party.
01:10:06.350 - 01:10:07.822, Speaker A: Here you go.
01:10:07.876 - 01:10:26.270, Speaker B: Oh, wow. Look at this. Oh, my gosh. Okay, so what we're looking at here is the sandbox. Game. And I think what's going on is that they've signed on Snoop Dogg as like their influencer, right, to get onboarding and traction for people listening to the podcast. It looks very much like Minecraft.
01:10:26.270 - 01:10:47.318, Speaker B: Very. Actually, I've actually gone and done a little bit of investigating as to what this thing actually is. It actually looks like a very well built out sort of like for those that remember second life, kind of like that. You get to build your own assets. You get to build your own avatars. Each of these assets are nfts. You can buy it with this native sand token currency.
01:10:47.318 - 01:11:13.486, Speaker B: So it's very much a virtual world universe that is NFT powered. And they've gotten Snoop Dogg on their influencer team. So this is pretty cool. We'll see if this actually gains any traction. The only reason why I noticed it was because of Snoop Dogg. It didn't really come from any of my internal NFT Ethereum circles. But hey, NFts are exploding beyond of what I can comprehend or pay attention to, so who knows?
01:11:13.598 - 01:11:17.234, Speaker A: Yeah, that's what's cool. Do you see some board apes in the screen clips here?
01:11:17.272 - 01:11:18.114, Speaker B: Oh, I missed it. I missed it.
01:11:18.152 - 01:11:20.534, Speaker A: They're integrating other nfTs. Wait, here it is.
01:11:20.572 - 01:11:27.570, Speaker B: So I can run around with my crypto. My cryptopunk would actually, or cryptopunks at large would fit very well into this aesthetic because they're already very pixely.
01:11:27.730 - 01:11:34.810, Speaker A: Yeah, you can import them into this world, I'm sure. But by the way, do you know what sandbox is built on? Is it some kind of all ethereum?
01:11:35.550 - 01:11:40.038, Speaker B: I don't know. If it's on a L2, I can't imagine it wouldn't be. But I do know it's on Ethereum.
01:11:40.134 - 01:12:14.710, Speaker A: If it's got board apes, it also reads the Ethereum blockchain and imports those NFTs in, which is super awesome. Man, entire world's being built around this. Let's talk about another NFT news. Dapper Labs, whom, you know, the folks behind NBA topshots and also the original cryptokitties, they're expanding into the NFL. So I think they're just doing the same play in the NFL as they did with the NBA. And they're signing Packers Aaron Jones as well. No, sorry, that's wrong.
01:12:14.710 - 01:12:32.958, Speaker A: FTX is signing Aaron Jones. I guess all of crypto is trying to get some legitimacy and credibility with the NFL market. But let's talk about this dapper labs thing. Seems like an obvious play for dapper after you hit the NBA to go after the NFL and probably a big deal for them. What do you think?
01:12:33.044 - 01:12:50.114, Speaker B: I mean, we all know that there is this massive world of collectibles that runs alongside sports. Right? Like, you can go into any sports stadium. Go into. Where do you go buy things inside of sports stadiums? Yeah, but there's a specific.
01:12:50.152 - 01:12:52.270, Speaker A: David and I are really good at sports.
01:12:52.430 - 01:13:13.798, Speaker B: Once upon a time. Once upon a time, like, the players drop. I don't know. You can go in and you can buy signed baseball bats, signed baseballs, and now we can make more virtual representations of whatever. I don't know, however they want to do this, but, like, virtual collectibles. And again, I don't think people are going to go in and be like, why would I buy this digital version of. No, they're just going to buy it.
01:13:13.804 - 01:13:22.398, Speaker A: They're just going to buy, my favorite athlete did this. I want this memorabilia. It's digital now. That's even better, because now I can display in my phone. Doesn't have to take up space in my house.
01:13:22.484 - 01:13:22.974, Speaker B: Exactly.
01:13:23.092 - 01:13:36.542, Speaker A: So onboarding the world again, I think of dapper more as sort of a side chain. Right. And I think all of this will flow into the rest of the crypto economy. It's all pie. Expanding good stuff.
01:13:36.676 - 01:13:39.122, Speaker B: Team store is called a team store.
01:13:39.256 - 01:14:03.866, Speaker A: That's what it's called. Listeners need to know that. Listeners are probably like, what the hell, guys? Don't you do any sports? All right, bitcoin stuff. Bitcoin's lightning network just reached all time highs, which is super cool to see. I'm a huge supporter of lightning, David. It is a trustless way, at lower cost of transaction, to send bitcoin. So I'm pleased to see some adoption here.
01:14:03.866 - 01:14:05.914, Speaker A: And they're getting up to three k.
01:14:05.952 - 01:14:07.994, Speaker B: They broke three k. Yes.
01:14:08.192 - 01:14:26.226, Speaker A: Three k bitcoin. That is. So. That's the equivalent of about 120 or so million dollars. So it's great to see lightning catch on. Part of this might be El Salvador, part of this might be maybe the Twitter traction on tipping. Maybe that's too early, I don't know.
01:14:26.226 - 01:14:37.300, Speaker A: But other things like that. I will say if you go to d five pulse right now, lightning is number 41 on the d five. It's not an apples to apples comparison. Right.
01:14:38.390 - 01:14:43.718, Speaker B: Three k is more bitcoin than I have. But like, in the grand scheme of things, it's not a lot. Not a lot. Yeah.
01:14:43.884 - 01:14:58.390, Speaker A: But we'll be monitoring this and see how it goes. And I think this is a good sign. This is a bankless money system as well. It's just always the question, David, do people really want to spend their bitcoin? I don't know. And have you ever used lightning? It's pretty clunky.
01:14:58.470 - 01:15:06.094, Speaker B: No, most people haven't. And most people think that they have, except they've actually just used a custodial service that runs a lightning node for them.
01:15:06.212 - 01:15:20.850, Speaker A: Exactly right. And I think there's a reason the Ethereum community abandoned state channels. Right. Hop across protocols, but payment channels, state channels never really took off on ethereum.
01:15:21.750 - 01:15:32.550, Speaker B: Until this whole l two thing. But also state channels built on an EVM is fundamentally different than state channels built on a Utxo model.
01:15:32.700 - 01:15:54.166, Speaker A: Yep, absolutely. But anyway, good news there, David. We should talk about the visa regulation, or, sorry, not visa regulation, but visa has actually just released a white paper. They are developing an interoperability concept so that central bank digital currencies can talk to cryptocurrencies and I guess exchange trade.
01:15:54.198 - 01:16:00.714, Speaker B: With one another and other central bank digital currencies too. It's like a general interoperability network.
01:16:00.762 - 01:16:09.778, Speaker A: Right. Okay, so I didn't read this entire white paper, but cool to see visa expanding the space. Any other takeaways for us here?
01:16:09.864 - 01:16:19.842, Speaker B: Yeah, my takeaway is the infrastructure for cbdcs is getting built out faster than the cbdcs actually are. Like the United States has not started China, except in China.
01:16:19.906 - 01:16:21.062, Speaker A: China's crushing it. Right?
01:16:21.116 - 01:17:00.466, Speaker B: Crushing it. Right? Like they don't even need infrastructure, they just need the actual CBDC, which is getting rolled out. So visa is like, hey, we have this interoperability mechanism to bridge all the cbdcs and crypto, and then the actual Federal Reserve of the United States is like cbdcs. Do we really need that? I mean, the answer is yes, but they don't even know it yet. But yeah, the private market is ahead of the public markets by orders of magnitude. So I think visa is just like taking a gamble that at some point in time the US regulators will get their head out of their blanks and figure out that they do need a CBDC. And then visa is like, hey, we've been waiting for you.
01:17:00.568 - 01:17:20.694, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. Visa is absolutely getting ahead. They've seen the light with crypto even though us government has not. Let's talk about some more us government stuff. This will tee us up for our next conversation, David. But one inch, which is a Dex aggregator. Did you know that? They just blocked us traders for the first time? So it's a geo block.
01:17:20.694 - 01:18:04.870, Speaker A: If you go to one inch from the US, you'll be kicked off the site. You'll be geoblocked out of it. I know some folks use vpns, but step, and I think they're doing this because they're planning to create a US only product like bifurcate. But this is back to the story of like, okay, so one inch is an aggregator and user interfaces can be blocked. The underlying smart contracts that power one inch and that power all of the assets and decentralized exchanges behind them, those are things that cannot be blocked. Right? So you can still have access to those because it's defi, because it's on Ethereum. But aggregators have a role and can definitely block individuals from using their platform.
01:18:04.870 - 01:18:41.058, Speaker A: And I hate going to these sites, David, and being present in the US and just because I'm a us citizen, I can't freaking use it. What's up with that? Right? Missed a DyDX airdrop because of that. Tons of us citizens did. Right? It's no other country, by the way. It's not even like North Korea and Iraq, China. China. But it's so strange to be blocked out of this emerging financial system as a us citizen, as a citizen of a free country.
01:18:41.058 - 01:18:43.794, Speaker A: And I don't understand. What's your take?
01:18:43.912 - 01:19:21.120, Speaker B: Yeah, so Dex aggregators, they are actually on the more centralized side of the spectrum. They're not completely on chain. I do believe there is some web two infrastructure that is a component of aggregating all the dexes for sure. Yeah, the order routing is a smart contract on chain, but I think the API pings and getting the information that is all done in a centralized fashion. So in theory, the Dex aggregators do have a centralized front end that can be blocked and that will actually mess up point, the choke point, right. That will actually mess up the product. Unlike uniswap, unlike balancer, unlike the actual true dexes out.
01:19:21.120 - 01:19:35.950, Speaker B: And I think one of the reasons why we can definitely say that's true is because they're making a us version of their front end, right? What they actually put on the US version versus the international version. How they differentiate those things, who knows?
01:19:36.030 - 01:20:02.810, Speaker A: Also we could say they tried. I think that's what some of these companies are trying to do is we're trying to comply. Speaking of trying to comply. So the CFTC just imposed a penalty. This is a commodity future exchange regulator in the US of 1.25 million against Kraken for offering illegal off chain digital asset trading and failing to register as required. So I think this is maybe some of the futures.
01:20:02.890 - 01:20:11.658, Speaker B: The TLDRs, they gave their customers margin accounts and they didn't register with the mean. I guess that's actually pretty straightforward.
01:20:11.834 - 01:20:12.362, Speaker A: Totally.
01:20:12.426 - 01:20:17.294, Speaker B: I won't go harp on, like, yeah, that's actually relatively normal. That's not like anybody targeting.
01:20:17.342 - 01:20:20.622, Speaker A: I see normal, relatively normal things coming out of the CFTC.
01:20:20.686 - 01:20:21.010, Speaker B: Right?
01:20:21.080 - 01:20:35.702, Speaker A: Yeah, David, they seem, at least to date, they've been much more reasoned and rational about this. And what's interesting about this is 1.25 million. That's just like a slap on the wrist for somebody like Kraken. Kraken is probably like, yes. Worth it.
01:20:35.836 - 01:20:36.840, Speaker B: Moving on.
01:20:38.190 - 01:21:14.802, Speaker A: Wells Fargo, man, I told you we'd get back to Wells Fargo. Here they are. Wells Fargo has been overcharging customers for, like, seven years in a row. This is a final settlement from a case that spanned from, like, 2010 to 2017 or 2018. And what they were doing, David, if you were a small business customer and you were trying to exchange, say, some dollars for euros or something, they would actually give you the wrong amount. Okay. So if the exchange rate was like, 1.25,
01:21:14.802 - 01:21:40.462, Speaker A: they'd do like, 1.52, just like, switch around two digits and then pocket the rest. Okay. And the whole cult, the culture, was to do this to cheat their customers. Right? And this is what the settlement actually says. Wells Fargo create an atmosphere in which employees openly joked about and celebrated taking advantage of the bank's customers. Okay, nice, right?
01:21:40.516 - 01:21:42.794, Speaker B: You know what fixes this, Dex?
01:21:42.842 - 01:21:44.654, Speaker A: Aggregators tell me.
01:21:44.692 - 01:21:45.630, Speaker B: Right? Yeah.
01:21:45.780 - 01:22:03.170, Speaker A: Like, no person in the middle of, like, you could see all of the transactions on chain, on exchange. That's what we're moving toward. That is the reason for bankless. So banks can't screw people over. And it's nice for the DOJ. The DOJ had to go prosecute this in court. Had to catch them.
01:22:03.170 - 01:22:16.774, Speaker A: How many times are the banks not caught doing these things? We'll never freaking know. Right? But the DOJ doesn't have to worry about this sort of thing if all of this is on chain, and they can see the full transaction history, and.
01:22:16.812 - 01:22:59.506, Speaker B: The customer does too, which is important, which is why huge missing component that Wells Fargo doesn't have to deal with is report their on chain data of how they actually got the number that they got. Right. Ryan, if you remember, I think in 2013 or 2014, there was a big story as to how Wells Fargo did so well after the eight crisis. And then in 2014, they were charged with the culture at Wells Fargo, promoted their salespeople, their bankers, to open up as many accounts from their customers as possible. And so they were charged with, like, I remember their bankers being really aggressive with their customers saying, like, hey, you need to open up this account and this account and this account. Because they needed to make quota.
01:22:59.538 - 01:23:02.198, Speaker A: Their bankers were salespeople, and so they.
01:23:02.204 - 01:23:40.994, Speaker B: Got charged in 2014 for having a culture that promoted opening unnecessary accounts. And they were also doing it to their customers without even asking their customers permission, because the pressure on these bankers to make sales quotas were so incredibly strong that it became a toxic, abusive relationship between the bankers and their employees. Right. And so this is what happens when you have a financial system that is no longer innovating and growing and developing, but has just switched to an extraction based model, because there's nothing left in the web legacy financial world. So you have to extract as maximally as possible, and there's no innovation. There's only extraction left in that world.
01:23:41.192 - 01:23:48.254, Speaker A: Absolutely. Rent collection, gouging. These are words that come to mind as you're talking about. You know, we need to do, David, is break up with our banks.
01:23:48.302 - 01:23:49.266, Speaker B: Yeah, I've heard this one before.
01:23:49.288 - 01:24:02.422, Speaker A: That's what we need to do. Open finance, guys. This is the solution. This is why we're on the journey. Senator Lumis might be on the journey as well. At least she seems to be in our court. We've been looking for advocates coming out of the Senate.
01:24:02.422 - 01:24:37.960, Speaker A: She might be one. In fact, we're hoping to get her on the bankless podcast at some point in time. But she laid out in front of the senate some principles for us digital currency, talked about the role of stablecoins, talked about America's leadership in global financial services is something that the country should be proud of and they should extend that into cryptocurrency, lean into it rather than trying to stop it and trying to create barriers and blockers every time someone wants to do something with cryptocurrency. That is a welcome message. David, any other takeaways from her notes here?
01:24:38.330 - 01:24:39.846, Speaker B: I think we should keep on going.
01:24:40.028 - 01:24:40.566, Speaker A: Absolutely.
01:24:40.668 - 01:24:42.280, Speaker B: Other than good job and thank you.
01:24:42.650 - 01:24:53.850, Speaker A: Yep. Well, let's get to this while we're talking about the US, Virgil Griffith. David, do you want to start with this story? Because people might not be familiar with this story and the context. Give us that.
01:24:54.000 - 01:25:20.402, Speaker B: Virgil Griffith, he is an Ethereum developer. That was actually before my time. I never had the honor of meeting this guy. For those that know the hamster dance or the skunk dance or the raccoon dance that a lot of these core Ethereum people did, I can't remember, at Devcon or something, there's a funny little dance out there. There are Vitalik's out there. Caller florists are all doing this funny little dance. And Virgil Griffiths was there too.
01:25:20.402 - 01:26:05.870, Speaker B: Right? That's kind of where I see him in the space. But he's a very core part of some of the early days of Ethereum. Very just overall proponent of how blockchains and crypto economic systems that span global communities can create global peace. And he actually made the decision to go to North Korea to give a talk at a north korean blockchain conference out there. Turns out North Korea has crypto conferences too. And then when he came back, he was arrested for violating sanctions and helping teach Korea how to get around sanctions. The criticism of that decision by the US government was that he didn't teach North Korea anything that you couldn't have already found on YouTube or just googled it, apparently.
01:26:05.870 - 01:26:12.558, Speaker B: Granted, there is a little bit of naivete, like, hey, don't go to North Korea and teach about crypto transactions.
01:26:12.654 - 01:26:14.050, Speaker A: A lot of naivety.
01:26:14.390 - 01:26:32.910, Speaker B: But also at the same time, he's not doing anything inherently illegal. Right. According to the United States he was. But he was just promoting knowledge and education about this thing that is inherently open source. Right. Like, they're going to learn about it anyways. And so he got arrested.
01:26:32.910 - 01:26:57.874, Speaker B: This news story that's come out here is that he got arrested a couple of years ago. The news story came out here that he had a trial. He's been hammering on the fact that he's not guilty, but his trial just started last Monday. And he opened up that trial with a guilty plea and a request for 6.5 years in jail, whereas the maximum sentence could be up to 20. So he requested six. And the story has to go from there.
01:26:57.874 - 01:26:59.394, Speaker B: But that's the gist of it.
01:26:59.512 - 01:27:40.234, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's definitely sad, right. I think that Virgil, it seemed to me, had sort of a crypto utopian sort of vision. And I think he was going to North Korea, which is obviously one of the worst regimes on the planet. Right. Very oppressive, like terrible regime. Right. But I think Virgil was going there perhaps with good intentions as far as talking about cryptocurrency and the freedom this could provide and kind of the enhanced coordination it could provide and didn't realize the full impact of his decisions.
01:27:40.234 - 01:28:16.778, Speaker A: Right. And the US arrested him, I think, when he was coming home to visit family on Thanksgiving, coming to the US. And he's actually been in the same for the last two months anyways, in the same prison that Jeffrey Epstein was in for the last two months. So it can't have been pleasant. I think there was an increasing amount of pressure on him to maybe plead guilty and not actually risk going 20 years prison. Yeah, 20 years in prison. So it's an unfortunate story because I don't think that what he was doing was legally wrong in the eyes of the US government.
01:28:16.778 - 01:28:51.480, Speaker A: Right. I think his defense would say, hey, he was just teaching them things that they could find online. And this is like an open conference and this is all publicly available on YouTube. And for my part, I believe that that's. But, like, even if you think it was legally not, not morally wrong, and this is a very harsh sentence for, I guess, the stated crime of what Virgil may or may not have done. So kind of sad to see it. David, from my perspective, I don't know if there's anything more to say on.
01:28:52.010 - 01:30:08.922, Speaker B: So for those that listen to the before bitcoin series we did, where I read out Peter Pan's four part series about the history of the cypherpunks, this is, in my mind, a continuation of that story of people that dedicate their lives towards cryptography and the social public systems, the public good systems that they create and that ultimately runs and butts heads with nation states who don't like systems that are outside of their control, of which cryptography is inherently about that. So Amin Soleimani, who's the writer of this thread that we are looking at right now, starts this thread off with, his name is Virgil Griffith. It was fun to see everyone this week in New York, but I'll admit I was walking around with a hole in my heart and a looming sense of dread. Virgil's trial starts this Monday, hashtag free Virgil. And then he goes through the history of both this case and also where it fits into the greater case of the story of the cipherpunks. He said, tweet number twelve. He goes, all of us in crypto today are downstream of the original cyberpunks we inherit, their 50 year struggle to emancipate cryptography as a weapon exclusively for militaries and provide it as a tool for individuals to use to protect their speech from illegitimate surveillance.
01:30:08.922 - 01:30:33.800, Speaker B: And so I feel like maybe if I put again, I never met Virgil Griffith. I don't know what he's like. But if I want to put my mind, my brain inside the mind of a cyberpunk, when you promote adoption of cryptography, you promote adoption of public resources that can escape oppression. And so maybe Virgil's mind was like, well, I'm going to go to North Korea, which is the site of the most oppression in the world. And hope this information leaks out. I don't know how that works.
01:30:34.730 - 01:31:06.478, Speaker A: I think from a cypherpunk's perspective, right. And from somebody who's deep into cryptography, you're going to a terrible, oppressive regime and you're kind of preaching the gospel. You're kind of preaching like freedom, technology. It's like going to a regime like this and talking about the value of freedom of speech. At least I think that's what it is like in Virgil's mind. Right. And I just contrast this, it's very clear, I think, that the US government wanted to make an example out of Virgil.
01:31:06.478 - 01:31:32.300, Speaker A: Right. Because clearly this is not actually a national security threat in any way, shape or form. Right. But technically was a crime committed. They just absolutely wanted to make an example out of this. And I just contrast that with like, man, the amount of people who went to jail after the 2008 shenanigans that went on, it's like one guy, maybe.
01:31:33.150 - 01:31:34.762, Speaker B: Virtually zero people, right?
01:31:34.816 - 01:31:52.042, Speaker A: Yeah. We're just talking about the Wells Fargo incident. $73 million slap on the wrist. Right. Sometimes the punishment far exceeds the quote unquote, crime committed. I think this may be one of those cases. So it's sort of a sad day in crypto.
01:31:52.186 - 01:32:22.118, Speaker B: And just to tie this thread off, tweet number 17. Amin goes today. The US government treats cryptocurrency with as much superstition as it did with encryption in decades past. I really like that framing, treating crypto as superstition. In that context, they are attempting to cast Virgil's presentation as a military grade violation. But just like encryption, cryptocurrency will inevitably triumph for years. Now, when cryptocurrency is widely adopted across the globe, Virgil's presentation to North Korea will appear trivial.
01:32:22.118 - 01:32:27.690, Speaker B: It will seem as silly as prosecuting someone for sharing the, quote, military secrets of HTTPs.
01:32:28.670 - 01:32:37.518, Speaker A: Absolutely. Well said. We'll leave it at that. Guys, we're going to cut to our sponsors and then we'll be back with some takes of the week. Here they are.
01:32:37.684 - 01:33:17.078, Speaker B: The Ave protocol is a decentralized liquidity protocol on Ethereum, which allows users to supply and borrow certain crypto assets. Ave version two has a ton of cool features that makes using the Ave protocol even more powerful. With Ave, you can leverage the full power of DFI money, legos, yield and composability all in one application. On Ave, there are a ton of assets that you can supply to the protocol in order to gain yield. And all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol. If you have supplied collateral here you can see me borrowing 200 USDC against my portfolio of a number of different DFI tokens. In ETH.
01:33:17.078 - 01:33:57.122, Speaker B: I'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option, but I could choose the stable interest rate option if I wanted to lock in that interest rate in permanently. V two also features the ability for users to swap collateral without having to withdraw their assets, trade them on uniswap, and then deposit them back into Ave. With Ave, users can do this in one seamless transaction, saving you time and gas costs. Check out the power of ave@ave.com. That's aave.com. Gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange. I've been a customer of Gemini since I first got into crypto in 2017, and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells.
01:33:57.122 - 01:34:42.482, Speaker B: Gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide. And on Gemini there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets, including many of the hot DFI tokens, and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid Dai markets. Gemini just launched their earn program, where you can earn up to 7.4% interest on 26 various crypto assets. If you're tired of paying fees in DFI or you don't want to worry about DFI exploits, but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets, Gemini Earn is the product for you. Another product I'm stoked to get my hands on is the Gemini crypto back credit card, which gives you 3% cash back on all of your purchases, but paid to you in your preferred crypto asset. When I get my Gemini credit card, I'm going to make sure that I get my cash back in ETH.
01:34:42.482 - 01:35:03.802, Speaker B: So whenever I buy something, I get a little bit of ETh bonus back to me. At the same time, you can open up a free account in under 3 minutes@gemini.com. Gobankless and if you trade more than $100 within the first 30 days after sign up, you'll be gifted a free $15 bitcoin bonus. Check them out@gemini.com. Gobankless all right, guys, we are back.
01:35:03.856 - 01:35:09.038, Speaker A: Takes of the week. Let's start with this. David, why don't you read this take and then I'll comment on it.
01:35:09.124 - 01:35:10.958, Speaker B: Read your own tweet. I will read, I don't want to.
01:35:10.964 - 01:35:12.110, Speaker A: Read my own tweet.
01:35:12.850 - 01:35:31.586, Speaker B: This guy, Ryan Sean Adams, I don't know who he is, never met him before. Says my advice for the US. One, buy ETH and BTC for your treasury. Two, issue a fed coin as an ERC 20 token. Three, become the world's most friendly DFI jurisdiction. That's it. That's literally all you have to do to win the next chapter of the Internet.
01:35:31.586 - 01:35:33.720, Speaker B: Brian, what's this guy saying?
01:35:34.890 - 01:36:00.798, Speaker A: I couldn't have said it any better. I really do think the three things that the US needs to do, and if it just does, those three things help. Let's take two. Pick any two of those us government and you will be ahead of any other geographic jurisdiction on the planet. But I don't know. They're not doing any of these right now, which makes me worried. It's very simple.
01:36:00.798 - 01:36:22.438, Speaker A: Some people think it's maybe more complicated than it is, but it really is this simple. Buy bitcoin and ETH, issue a fed coin of some sort as an ERC 20 on Ethereum, and just be really friendly to the talented engineers that are building DFI in your country. Make it an appealing jurisdiction, rather than pushing them outside, which is what they're doing right now.
01:36:22.524 - 01:36:30.890, Speaker B: Ryan, you've made it seem really simple, but that's because you skipped a step which is step zero. Stop caring about all the incumbents and check your biases at the door.
01:36:31.230 - 01:36:32.378, Speaker A: That's why they're not doing.
01:36:32.464 - 01:36:33.546, Speaker B: That's why it's not simple.
01:36:33.648 - 01:36:50.160, Speaker A: That's the tweet behind the tweet. Some guy should tweet that out. All right, David, why don't you take this one? So this is interesting. I'll read the headline here. The SEC is threatening coinbase to protect the public, but not in the way you think. Okay.
01:36:51.330 - 01:37:19.094, Speaker B: This was a fantastic thread that you should absolutely go and check out yourself. We're not going to read the whole thing because it's a little bit long, but basically juice ojuice underscore ETH talks about how, because of trying to get the recovery going after their pandemic, the reserve requirement ratios for banks have gone from 10% to 0%. And if we go. Yeah, we're going to start at tweet number six. Here it goes. Banks are more or less offering the same interest rates as each other. Right now this is around zero 5%.
01:37:19.094 - 01:38:23.690, Speaker B: For decades, there have not been any significant products with better rates whilst maintaining the convenience of the liquidity of the savings account. Until now, at a 5% interest rate, which is literally a 100 x improvement than any savings account at a bank, is what Coinbase earn has offered. What was going to offer, except here's the problem? The problem is that the product is so good and it's such a no brainer and can very realistically cause millions of depositors to move their savings to the Coinbase earn product. And then the last tweet that we're going to read is, which means a concentration of dollars will suddenly be siphoned off into the institution Coinbase banks with, and every other bank would be left unable to meet that 10% reserve requirement. So what they are worried about is that Coinbase's products are going to be so incredibly successful that banks will never be able to actually return to a 10% collateralization requirement, which is saying something about the power of the product, the Coinbase earn product, that the SEC told them that they were going to sue them if they've released that product.
01:38:23.840 - 01:38:39.090, Speaker A: Okay, so basically what he's saying is Coinbase earn and crypto related products like this are so good that it's going to slurp in all of the money from the banking system, cause the banks to collapse. And public. We don't want a banking system collapse like 2008 again, do we?
01:38:39.160 - 01:38:39.634, Speaker B: Right.
01:38:39.752 - 01:38:41.540, Speaker A: So we're protecting you from that.
01:38:42.150 - 01:38:46.150, Speaker B: The product was so good that it's going to collapse the economy.
01:38:49.050 - 01:38:57.382, Speaker A: It's going to collapse this strong foundational banking system that we've propped up. Yeah, I think that could be it.
01:38:57.436 - 01:39:03.162, Speaker B: I'm sorry. If good products collapse the economy, what the actual f are we doing?
01:39:03.296 - 01:39:20.842, Speaker A: Look, it goes back to the tweet that you were just talking about. Right. Which is like, we don't want to disrupt the incumbents. That's why we're doing it. That's the tweet behind every tweet too big, behind every regulatory action that we're seeing that's aggressive towards crypto.
01:39:20.906 - 01:39:26.994, Speaker B: Literally not allowed to have nice things because it'll break. All the bad things in our entire society is built on bad things.
01:39:27.112 - 01:39:37.394, Speaker A: Well, you've got a take on this, right? So this is actually, well, I don't know if it's your take or this guy David Hoffman eth on Twitter goes by the handle trustless state. Really smart guy.
01:39:37.512 - 01:39:38.830, Speaker B: He's got a cool punk.
01:39:38.990 - 01:39:45.110, Speaker A: Crypto is going to nerf the SEC is what you said. And this goes back to a post you wrote earlier in the week. What did you mean by this?
01:39:45.180 - 01:40:48.678, Speaker B: Yeah, so Gary Gensler is coming at crypto super hard, right, trying to, I think, more or less do everything he can to have more and more jurisdiction over crypto. Basically wants everything to be a security. Right. And careful what's your wish for Gary. If everything becomes a security, I don't think you realize how trivial it is to spin up a new token. Like spin up a new ERC 20 token, spin up a new social token, a new Dow token, a new NFT that represents some in game asset. If you do want all of those to be securities, because what's more likely? Is it more likely that as a result of your desire to regulate all of these things, you actually have to ease back what it actually means to regulate those things? Or do you want everyone who ever issues a token to come knocking on your door, wait in line with their forums and say, hey, Gary Gensler, will you please give me my stamp? What's going to be more likely? I think it's going to be more likely that we're going to use this asset printing press, which is the ERC 20 or ERC 721 standard, and print a bajillion tokens.
01:40:48.678 - 01:41:08.114, Speaker B: Gary's going to get real upset that they're all securities, but in order for him to legitimize what the SEC does as a regulatory body, they're just going to have to water down what it actually means to be a security. Right? And so sweet. This thing on my wall is a security. Yay. Everything's a security.
01:41:08.232 - 01:41:15.640, Speaker A: SEC does not want to have jurisdiction and regulate a flaming sword of.
01:41:16.970 - 01:41:17.430, Speaker B: Right.
01:41:17.500 - 01:41:29.466, Speaker A: Like, that's what you're saying is they're biting off way too much more than they can chew, and it's actually going to completely, I guess, water down the.
01:41:29.488 - 01:41:32.300, Speaker B: Definition of a security. Yeah.
01:41:32.670 - 01:41:45.870, Speaker A: So if everything's a security, nothing is. Guys, let's take this next tweet. David, this is, I think, a meme tweet that some people took seriously from bankless HQ, Twitter. What is this?
01:41:45.940 - 01:41:50.110, Speaker B: Wait, the headline isn't a meme? That's a real headline, right?
01:41:50.260 - 01:41:51.834, Speaker A: No, this is the meme, dude.
01:41:51.882 - 01:42:21.660, Speaker B: Oh, is it? Okay, I just ate the onion there. In that case, love it. Got him. All right, well, okay, so the headline is. That makes more sense as to actually who's actually the picture depicting Lindsey Graham, I believe, is who that is. And then the bottom headline is senate bans nfts. Quote, the trend is bankrupting our youth, which I guess is a wink wing to the fact that when you buy one NFT, the next thing that happens is you buy a second one, and then right after that, you buy a third one.
01:42:21.660 - 01:42:35.230, Speaker B: That's funny, because I'm pretty sure the guy that tweeted this, Michael Wong, he's working on a crypto satire website very much like the onion. And we talked about how our KPIs is like, how many people can we get to. Do you know the term eat the onion?
01:42:36.370 - 01:42:37.374, Speaker A: Okay, now tell me.
01:42:37.412 - 01:43:04.214, Speaker B: It's like when somebody reads an onion article and then they take it seriously and they start blowing it up on Twitter. I just ate the onion. Yeah. And so a secret skunk works project out of the bankless Dow is there's going to be a crypto satire website, show website, like news organization, very much like the onion, that has meme only headlines. And the KPI is like, all right, how many times can we get people to actually believe some of the BS headlines that we're going to write?
01:43:04.332 - 01:43:05.320, Speaker A: That's awesome.
01:43:05.850 - 01:43:07.826, Speaker B: I'm the first victim. Son of a bitch.
01:43:07.938 - 01:43:14.794, Speaker A: Yeah, well, here's the bottom behind this. This is a meme, guys. But the fact that people think it's real is exactly why Congress is failing us. Right?
01:43:14.832 - 01:43:15.754, Speaker B: There's a take.
01:43:15.952 - 01:43:26.698, Speaker A: This trend is bankrupting our youth. Senate bans nfts. That's why Congress is failing us, because people actually believe that's true. I have another confession for you, David. This is my meme.
01:43:26.794 - 01:43:27.790, Speaker B: Is this yours?
01:43:29.890 - 01:43:32.846, Speaker A: I was thinking about the satire thing and everything you said, and I was.
01:43:32.868 - 01:43:33.726, Speaker B: Like, you know what?
01:43:33.828 - 01:43:36.580, Speaker A: I'm going to throw a meme up. I did.
01:43:37.190 - 01:43:39.982, Speaker B: Yeah. Hey, sometimes the Ryan Sean Adams memes.
01:43:40.046 - 01:43:43.090, Speaker A: They'Ll get you, okay. They're great.
01:43:43.240 - 01:43:44.626, Speaker B: You just don't know when they come.
01:43:44.728 - 01:43:59.798, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a surprise every time. All right, let's see this golden age of building. David will look back on the. Remember it as the golden age of building. This is another tweet that you put out there last week. What does this mean?
01:43:59.884 - 01:44:30.100, Speaker B: Yeah. Once upon a time in high school, I was really into the world of aviation. And in the world of aviation, there's the golden age of aviation, which was the 1930s. It's just when so much innovation happened. And a lot of the same technologies that we use today for flying and aviation was found in the 1930s. And I think that that is what we are seeing here with the 2020s, when this decade is over, I think we're going to look back and be like, God, that was fun. Remember when there was cool time? Those were great times.
01:44:30.100 - 01:44:45.586, Speaker B: It's actually a call to action for everyone listening just to like, hey, take a moment, reflect, and remember what it's like to be where we are today. Because we only get to do this once, and it's a good time, regardless of all the regulator FOMO out there or regulator FuD.
01:44:45.618 - 01:44:48.898, Speaker A: Excuse me, FOMo.
01:44:48.994 - 01:44:51.110, Speaker B: But with denial is fud.
01:44:51.450 - 01:44:52.502, Speaker A: There you go.
01:44:52.636 - 01:45:02.026, Speaker B: And so, yeah, hey, we're in the golden age of building. There's cool stuff being built every single week. There's cool things happening. And I think we will look back with nostalgia on this era.
01:45:02.138 - 01:45:21.010, Speaker A: I totally agree. I'm super grateful to be here. I'm grateful for all the listeners. And that sense of gratitude really underlies, I think, the best projects. They know they're early. They know they're doing something super cool. And, yeah, it's really important to pause and just reflect on that sometimes.
01:45:21.010 - 01:45:22.082, Speaker A: David, good thought, man.
01:45:22.136 - 01:45:22.402, Speaker B: Absolutely.
01:45:22.456 - 01:45:26.174, Speaker A: Thank you. Let me ask you this last question of the week. What are you excited about, dude?
01:45:26.222 - 01:46:12.626, Speaker B: Okay, so I was at MCon last week and MCon two weeks ago, and Mainnet New York last week, met a ton of cool people. And the number of times that I would go up to one of the booths at Mainnet, at Missari Mainnet, and just meet with some people, somebody would say, hey, the reason why I got this job at Company X or Project Y is because you and Ryan kept on just yelling at me to get a job in crypto, either on the newsletter or on the podcast. You guys say, hey, you can do it. You can quit your legacy job and get a job in crypto. And so I did it. I think I ran into, I think, seven people@main.net. And that's not even counting EmCon that said, hey, I got a job in crypto because you guys at bankless really encouraged me and inspired me to do that.
01:46:12.626 - 01:46:40.554, Speaker B: And so I'm honored and humbled that people actually listened to us at all. And the fact that so many of you have gotten jobs in crypto is also thank you for helping turn this into the golden age of building, because the people that quit their jobs to take the step into crypto and take that risk are the people that are going to be pioneering so many more people in crypto in the future. So thank you for taking that leap. And if you are yet to take that leap, what are you waiting for? Like, don't miss out.
01:46:40.592 - 01:46:49.770, Speaker A: It's a fun time, as we say. It's people all the way down. Nothing more exciting than attracting good people to this space. That's absolutely awesome to hear, David.
01:46:49.850 - 01:46:54.910, Speaker B: Yeah. And before I ask you what you're excited about, Ryan. Hey, look, according to Twitter, it's international podcast Day. Look at that.
01:46:54.980 - 01:46:58.954, Speaker A: Hey, happy international podcast Day. Do you know what episode number this is?
01:46:59.092 - 01:47:02.386, Speaker B: This will be the weekly, I don't know what weekly roll up number this is. But we are.
01:47:02.408 - 01:47:05.154, Speaker A: I mean, how many podcasts do you think we've done right now?
01:47:05.272 - 01:47:13.640, Speaker B: The actual Monday podcast will be number 89, I think. State of the nation. We're up to like 60 ish weekly roll ups. We're at like 40.
01:47:14.170 - 01:47:20.470, Speaker A: Yeah, take 80, I guess, and roughly multiply that by four. Probably what we're doing. Because we do like.
01:47:20.540 - 01:47:28.298, Speaker B: Well, no, because the podcast started earlier than all the other ones, so I say like three, maybe. So we're definitely over 200. I think we're two to 300.
01:47:28.384 - 01:47:30.666, Speaker A: Well, there you go. One day we will count while you.
01:47:30.688 - 01:47:34.286, Speaker B: Tell me what you're excited about. I'm going to go to lib that account. Yeah, I'm going to look that up.
01:47:34.388 - 01:47:34.686, Speaker A: Do it.
01:47:34.708 - 01:47:36.560, Speaker B: Okay. What's your number? What's your number?
01:47:37.330 - 01:47:41.118, Speaker A: My number is 364.
01:47:41.204 - 01:47:43.290, Speaker B: Okay. All right. Now tell me what you're excited about, Brian.
01:47:43.370 - 01:47:49.154, Speaker A: All right, so while you're looking that up, what I'm excited about is also bankless podcast right now, because we.
01:47:49.192 - 01:47:50.594, Speaker B: 245.
01:47:50.792 - 01:47:52.500, Speaker A: Oh, God, I was way off.
01:47:52.950 - 01:47:54.414, Speaker B: 245 podcasts.
01:47:54.462 - 01:47:55.122, Speaker A: That's still good.
01:47:55.176 - 01:47:56.514, Speaker B: That's still great. Really good.
01:47:56.632 - 01:47:58.198, Speaker A: Now, how many hours is that?
01:47:58.284 - 01:48:00.982, Speaker B: Multiply that by, like, at least 1.5.
01:48:01.036 - 01:48:21.882, Speaker A: Yeah, 1.5. Multiply that by 1.5. All right, so we just secured a dream guest on bankless. Right. When we started the Bankless podcast, we had a list of, like, I don't know, 510 names that were like, hey, we'll be doing it if we get this name. And now we got one of those names, another one off the list. Super excited about it.
01:48:21.882 - 01:49:04.090, Speaker A: Not going to reveal it now, coming later in October. We'll have a big reveal soon. But we're very excited. And I think this just reflects as one of the reasons I got into crypto and started crypto media. I got into crypto first. I thought all I wanted to do was invest, right? But then I realized investment and kind of narrative and learning about this stuff, we can learn about this stuff collectively, right? That's why we started bankless, and that's why we started the Bankless podcast, to go on the journey together, because we can level up together. And one thing we realized early, David, is if crypto is going to go mainstream, there has to be a big tent around it, right? It can't just be like this isolated cult of weirdos and geeks.
01:49:04.090 - 01:49:43.202, Speaker A: It has to saturate itself into all areas of culture. And so that's why we're doing bankless, is to saturate crypto and defi. And these values into culture. So that means, like, politicians, that means regulators, that means musicians, that means investors. Anybody who's out there, we want to get them on the bankless podcast. And here's the beautiful thing about it, David, is like, if they adopt crypto protocols, okay, they adopt crypto values, all right? We tricked them, we got them, and that's how we change the world. As long as our values are embedded in the protocols.
01:49:43.202 - 01:50:17.874, Speaker A: When they adopt crypto, they don't know it, but they're adopting crypto values when they buy that NFT, what's that? NFT secured by? What's it paying out? Right? What's it propagating? The economic security of Ethereum, which is a decentralized money system that embodies crypto values. So this is a covert ops man. And we're doing it by getting these big guests, by listeners tuning in, by you hitting the subscribe on YouTube, if you haven't subscribed yet, you are helping to propagate crypto values and crypto culture to the world. And that's why I'm excited about today.
01:50:17.992 - 01:50:24.978, Speaker B: That was a great answer. I'm looking forward to talking to that guest of which we've named on this show before.
01:50:25.064 - 01:50:31.080, Speaker A: So I will say that of which we've named so you can go back in past episodes, all of them.
01:50:31.610 - 01:50:32.194, Speaker B: Start writing.
01:50:32.242 - 01:50:33.718, Speaker A: All 200 and how many?
01:50:33.884 - 01:50:34.982, Speaker B: 245.
01:50:35.036 - 01:50:41.850, Speaker A: Yeah, it shouldn't take long. Meme of the week. Meme of the week time. Let's do this. What are we looking at?
01:50:41.920 - 01:51:04.890, Speaker B: All right, we are looking at that famous picture of two people getting divorced and they're separating out their beanie babies. This was in the believe, but instead of beanie babies, they're nfts. So we got these couple. One's pulling out a cool cat, the other one's about to grab a meat bit. There's a chromy squiggle in there. If you get divorced, make sure you know who's getting what nfts.
01:51:05.050 - 01:51:08.018, Speaker A: That is a very important point, sir. That's awesome.
01:51:08.104 - 01:51:16.310, Speaker B: All right, guys, hopefully there's not hopefully don't get divorced, but also hopefully our nfts don't go, by the way of Beanie babies. Yeah.
01:51:16.380 - 01:51:18.230, Speaker A: Is that what this is? A preliminary?
01:51:18.810 - 01:51:19.126, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:51:19.148 - 01:51:23.714, Speaker A: What are those Beanie babies worth now? Hilarious.
01:51:23.762 - 01:51:24.278, Speaker B: Too much.
01:51:24.364 - 01:51:35.354, Speaker A: Guys, this has been the weekly roll up. Of course, none of this has been financial advice. Eth is risky. Defi is risky. Beanie baby. I'm sorry. I mean, nfts are risky as well.
01:51:35.354 - 01:51:42.766, Speaker A: You could lose what you put in. But we are headed west this is a frontier. It's not for everyone. But we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
