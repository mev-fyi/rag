00:00:07.610 - 00:01:11.074, Speaker A: Hey Bankless nation, welcome to this special edition of the Bankless podcast. Today I'm talking with Scoopy truples of the Alchemyx protocol. We had Scoopy on a while ago on the state of the nation to talk all about alchemy's v one and also the new ETH vaults that were coming online shortly thereafter. And today we are getting an update as to the state of the Alchemyx ecosystem, the story of the al eth vaults and what happened with that, and also the story of the coming v two of Alchemyx, as well as their L2 plans. And then I also pick Scoopy's brain with what he is calling a new era for DeFi, which is using Olympus Dow's primitive to replace the traditional yield farming mechanism where you just deposit your liquidity into a contract and then you receive the governance tokens as a reward for depositing your liquidity. Scooby thinks that the time of that model for yield farming has come to an end and is going to be replaced by something much more sustainable, much more long term aligned. And so we go into the details of that as well.
00:01:11.074 - 00:01:53.722, Speaker A: So I hope you enjoy this update as to the state of alchemy's v two as well as Goopy's brain with regards to what's going on in DFI. And so we're going to go ahead and get right into that conversation. But first, a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible. Matcha, everyone's favorite Dex aggregator, has just launched an open beta for gasless trading. So if you're trading more than $5,000 in common eth and wrapped bitcoin pairs, then your gas fees on matcha are free. And that's why you should be using matcha. Matcha routes your orders across all the various defi exchanges on Ethereum, polygon, binance, smart chain, and gives you the best possible price without any trading fees or unnecessary slippage.
00:01:53.722 - 00:02:34.006, Speaker A: Matcha has smart order routing that splits your orders across multiple liquidity sources. If matcha sees that, it gets you better pricing. Trading on matcha is super easy because it pools the liquidity for me into a single and easy to use platform and has even saved me multiple times from accidentally picking the wrong decks to trade on and getting a bad price. Matcha also allows you to make limit orders on chain so you can set and forget your defi trades and they will go through automatically while you're away. So when you're making a trade, head over to matcha XYz slash bankless. Connect your wallet and start getting some of the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets. Alchemyx is one of the coolest new defi apps on the scene.
00:02:34.006 - 00:03:09.226, Speaker A: It introduces self paying loans, allowing you to spend and save at the same time. Deposit the Dai stablecoin into the Alchemyx vault in order to get an advance on the interest it generates. Borrow up to 50% of the total amount of your deposited die in the form of Al USD stablecoin. Here's the craziest part. The loan pays itself back and you cannot be liquidated. Unlock your assets potential in the ultimate DFI savings account. And brand new to Alchemix is the eth vault, where you can deposit Eth into the application.
00:03:09.226 - 00:04:03.722, Speaker A: Borrow al ETH against your deposits while having your advance gradually paid back over time. V two is rapidly approaching, which will allow for even more collateral types, plus a variety of yield strategies to choose from. Harness the power of Alchemyx at Alchemyx Fi that's A-L-C-H-E-M-I-X-F-I. Follow alchemyx on Twitter at alchemyx Fi and join the discord to keep up to date with Alchemyx V two and to get involved in governance. All right, bankless nation, today we are here with Scoopy truples of the Alchemyx protocol. Scoopy truples, in addition to having one of the coolest and most fun names to say in all of crypto, Twitter has been with Alchemyx since day one and has co founded it. And Alchemyx has really just planted its flag with one of the cool new Defi primitives that the rest of defi hooks into.
00:04:03.722 - 00:04:06.838, Speaker A: So Scooby triples. Welcome back to bankless.
00:04:07.014 - 00:04:17.166, Speaker B: Yeah, it's great to be back, man. I'm really pumped to be here and talk about alchemics and sort of like just DFi in general, man. Thanks for having me on.
00:04:17.268 - 00:04:34.610, Speaker A: Yeah, so the last time we had you on it was during Alchemyx's v one days and not yet getting into the world of v two, but yet now Alchemyx is in its v two. So, Scoopy, can you tell us the upgrade from v one to v two and where Alchemyx is now?
00:04:34.760 - 00:04:53.900, Speaker B: Oh, let me issue a little correction. We're not done with v two just yet. It just entered code freeze and it's going to go into its audit at the end of the month, and hopefully we will be able to get that out by the end of the year. If not, then very early next year we'll be having v two out.
00:04:54.430 - 00:04:58.220, Speaker A: Fantastic. So what are the big upgrades that v two is bringing along?
00:04:58.590 - 00:05:29.142, Speaker B: So in v one we only have one collateral type and that's Dai, and that means al USD. And same thing with eth that mints al eth. And we only have one strategy that's yearn for both of those. In version two of alchemics, we are just going to blow open the doors for what we're going to be able to do. Multi collateral USD. So lots of new stablecoin collaterals are going to be collateral for Al USD. So you could think of sort of like the big ones.
00:05:29.142 - 00:06:01.886, Speaker B: So Dai, USDC, tether, but also a lot of the new decentralized stablecoins. In this past year, a bunch of really new, really high quality decentralized stablecoins have come out, I'd say most notably LUSD and magic Internet money. And I think adding those to the mix and also some of the other kind of up and coming decentralized stablecoins is going to make alchemics a big tent for lots of different assets in the space.
00:06:02.068 - 00:06:18.642, Speaker A: Very cool. That is really like it in the world of defi where things open up. So is each one of these stablecoins going to have their own vault, or is it going to be all collapsed into one or a few vaults? Are collaterals going to be mixed together or are they going to be siloed?
00:06:18.786 - 00:06:56.610, Speaker B: So the collaterals are all going to kind of work together to be a big composite position for you. Let's say you just have, it's split between three different collateral types. And let's say you have $1,000 in there, you'll be able to borrow 500 al USD off of that. Regardless of how much you have in either one of them. It'll work all seamlessly together. And I think one of the cooler things about this is that not only are we having multicolateral Al USD and Al ETH as well, but also multi strategy. So inside of each collateral type, we'll be offering an ever growing selection of strategies.
00:06:56.610 - 00:07:37.310, Speaker B: Think about all the different yield aggregators. So right now it's just urine, but we're going to be adding ave, we're going to be adding compound, we're going to be adding like pickle harvest staked out and more to come because I know there's going to be some more innovations in the yield aggregator space as well. And the cool thing is you don't have to go all in in one strategy. You can mix it up however you want to. So if you want to go like half in urine, half and staked out, you can do that. You can make it whatever composition you want. So it ends up being kind of like a meta yield aggregator that you can sort of build to your own risk tolerances.
00:07:37.310 - 00:08:02.130, Speaker B: And let's say one of the underlying strategies suffers a black swan event, your collateral and other strategies are fine, you're only going to take that loss in that one strategy. So it's really going to be you kind of parameterizing your own risk tolerance in addition to your yield preferences and stuff like that. So it's going to be really powerful.
00:08:02.290 - 00:08:21.440, Speaker A: Okay, so this isn't, correct me if I'm wrong, but because of v two, you're not going to be getting more yield than you previously would have. The big unlock, the big innovation is being able to more finely tune what you are exposed to, the risks that you're exposed to. Is that correct?
00:08:22.130 - 00:08:31.786, Speaker B: Yes, but also since you're going to have different yield providers to choose from, you could end up having higher yields than what urine is presently offering.
00:08:31.978 - 00:08:32.622, Speaker A: Okay.
00:08:32.756 - 00:09:13.386, Speaker B: Yeah, because different yield aggregators use different strategies. So there are going to be some differences in that. We're also really looking into taking sort of like curve lps, like the ones that are made up of stablecoin positions. And going into convex, which is a really awesome platform for curve lps, is going to also increase the amount of yield that our users are going to be able to have in alchemics V two. So we're expecting yield to go up, choice to go up, and people being able to sort of choose their own spectrum of risk involved in alchemics.
00:09:13.578 - 00:09:36.770, Speaker A: Okay, so one of the questions I had when you talked about having multi collateral LUSD, where you can have die or LUSD as the deposit, my mind went to, well, what about having a stablecoin curve LP position where you're lping a bunch of stablecoins into curve and using that as the deposit? Can you do that or is that nonsense?
00:09:37.530 - 00:10:15.874, Speaker B: Yeah, that's what I just said. So those curve LP positions, they're really cool because they work as a composite of all of the tokens that are underlying, but they also have a sort of thing about like number go up about them because the trading fees from curve end up going to the LP token. So the LP token's underlying value tends to go up and to the right gradually over time. So of course not all the LP tokens are made equal we have to do a lot of risk parameterization to see which ones are acceptable as collateral. But I think that they are going to be a very good addition to alchemics, and we can accept a lot of them for sure.
00:10:15.992 - 00:10:32.070, Speaker A: I would imagine as a yield optimization protocol, having your collateral be curve LP positions, and then also being able to borrow more stable coins to go yield farm even more. That seems to be just like an insane amount of yield.
00:10:32.730 - 00:10:38.940, Speaker B: Yeah, it's just going to be yield all day and all night. Yeah, we're excited for it.
00:10:39.390 - 00:10:57.450, Speaker A: Okay, so Alchemyx has now integrated into more yield bearing strategies and is also integrated into more stable coins. But what about protocols that have integrated more into Alchemyx? Can you talk about how you guys have becoming adopted in the greater defi ecosystem?
00:10:57.610 - 00:11:48.480, Speaker B: So, in version one, there's no real greater adoption for other protocols going into alchemics as a security measure, because we really wanted to make sure everything was as safe as possible. We did not allow for smart contracts to interact with alchemics, and that would prevent flash loans and other exploits associated with them. But our version two is being audited by one of the best firms in the business, runtime verification. And we were designing V two with them all summer long with security in mind, and it's going into audit with them, and it's going to pass through, like, formal verification and lots and lots and lots of testing. And so we're going to be able to make version two a lot more composable, where any person, any application, any Dow can plug into Alchemyx and use it for themselves.
00:11:49.330 - 00:12:25.078, Speaker A: So this really seems to be Alchemy's stepping into the wild moment where you are fully unleashing, allowing the powers of defi to get integrated, which is like a double edged sword, right? Like, well, if you become more and more permissionless, well, you get more and more used. But also if you become more and more permissionless, you increase your surface area for exploits. So this seems like Alchemyx is, we're ready for the wild, we're ready for the risks moment. We think we've got this, and this protocol is locked down, and we're ready for the integrations. Is that the right vibe?
00:12:25.254 - 00:13:02.454, Speaker B: Yeah, totally. I think when new protocols launch, v one is always sort of really like glorified beta, where we have to cut features and you have to sort of do things in order to just ship and get your product out. And then V two is really like kind of the vision that you had originally for your v one. And then I think it was a t eleven s from Twitter. He's like, so then what's v three? And then V three is actually the true v two, right? I don't know when V three is coming out. Don't ask me, please, for the love of God. But I am super excited for v two.
00:13:02.454 - 00:13:02.902, Speaker B: Yes.
00:13:02.956 - 00:13:31.680, Speaker A: Well, congratulations for making it all this way. And I think one of the biggest strengths that Alchemyx has is its community, which I think is evidenced by what happened when there was the accidental exploit of the eth vaults, which is why I thought you guys were at v two, because I thought the EtH vaults, we were v two at the very beginning. That's how I got that mixed up. So, Scooby, can you tell us the story of the EtH vaults and the resulting rallying of the community behind it?
00:13:32.290 - 00:14:29.890, Speaker B: Yeah. So when we launched our al eth vault, we were really confident that it was secure. It was passing all of our internal tests and everything like that. But there was a weird thing that happened in the deploy sequence where one of the vault adapters that handles moving your ETH collateral to urine, it failed its deployment two times, but there was no error message involved. And so the vault that finally got deployed was at the wrong index number than we anticipated, but it was at the same address, and we didn't have a sanity check because we didn't think that could happen. And so when we called pool id zero to harvest the yield from it, it read that there was a balance of nothing supposed to be in there, but then there was all this Eth in there thinking that this was profit. And then it used all of that eth to then repay everyone's debt erroneously.
00:14:29.890 - 00:15:15.890, Speaker B: And so then people were free to just withdraw their collateral and have this free al eth at that time. And a lot of people obviously were really distraught that this had happened. And we're kind of scrambling. What are we going to do? And then a lot of people in our discord spoke up as like, hey, I got free stuff. Can I give it back? Where should I send it? And then it dawned on us, hey, what if we just asked nicely and it ended up being really successful? A lot of people in the community gave it back. I think it was over 200 wallets gave ETH back and a lot more people donated. We finally made good on our promise and we made a patron NFT that has metadata for how much ETH people donated back to alchemics.
00:15:15.890 - 00:15:21.570, Speaker B: And that will have some functionality in some future apps that we have.
00:15:21.720 - 00:15:27.990, Speaker A: Very neat. Do you know how much total ETH was lost and then what percentage of that ETh was recovered?
00:15:28.490 - 00:15:54.830, Speaker B: Yeah, there was around 2300 ETH that was lost. And we got a little bit over 50% back. Some of that was our team members kind of rallying together and making donations of our own as well, in addition to the community. So I'd say like minus that we were under half. But still, even then, it was a very awesome thing to see our community come together.
00:15:54.980 - 00:16:17.220, Speaker A: Right. Kind of even weird to think that you got anything back at all. People got free eth. Why would they give it back to you? And so what lessons or what takeaways do you have by the fact that so many people gave anything back at all? What are your big takeaways about what this tells you about maybe the alchemyx community or maybe defi at large?
00:16:18.010 - 00:16:54.562, Speaker B: Well, I mean, I think it speaks to the larger Ethereum community. If you foster a good community and people think you're a good actor in the community, then they want to do good by you. And I think we see that a lot in Ethereum, not with everybody in the space, but probably more than any other blockchain in the space. You see a lot of good actors and good people in Ethereum in general. Another thing is that we asked nicely, we took calls with our community. We spent time, all that time before launching Ali. It's really trying to grow and foster our community and have it be a nice, friendly, welcoming place for people.
00:16:54.562 - 00:17:29.890, Speaker B: So we got the right people into the application. So I think that's part of it. In crypto you can fork any project out there, even if the code isn't public. On GitHub, you can pull it off the blockchain, reverse engineer and deploy it yourself. Anybody who's a decent coder can do that, but you can't fork a community. And that's something that we really learned with Aleth, and we love our community and are so grateful that we were able to recover so much of the funds in that incident.
00:17:30.070 - 00:17:33.470, Speaker A: How much do you think the NFT had to do with that recovery?
00:17:34.610 - 00:18:15.900, Speaker B: That's a really hard one to say. I think we ended up getting around like a couple hundred eth returned or just donated to us because people felt bad for us and small donations and stuff like that. And that's including some of our team members giving back and just trying to support our protocol as well. But yeah, it was really big. And I think when you kind of offer somebody a little carrot, it's a lot better than a stick for sure. If we went out and we're threatening people to give it back, I think we would have gotten almost nothing.
00:18:16.510 - 00:18:48.566, Speaker A: So that brings me to my next question. Not too long ago, a kind of similar ish thing happened to compound where comp token was issued way faster than it should have been. And then Robert Leshner famously tweets out anyone that got comp tokens that they shouldn't have, either return it or basically threaten to dox people that got this token to the IRS saying, like, hey, we will report your tokens as income. When you saw that tweet out of Robert, what did you think?
00:18:48.748 - 00:19:04.182, Speaker B: Well, I disagree with the fact that he was threatening to dox people personally. I think he was more stating the fact, know, if you're trading on Coinbase, then they know who you know, and therefore Coinbase will dox you to the IRS, not him personally.
00:19:04.246 - 00:19:04.906, Speaker A: Yeah, correct.
00:19:05.008 - 00:20:12.766, Speaker B: And I think when he said that, he was probably under a lot of duress, a lot of pressure, had probably people trolling him, fudding him, probably up for 24 hours straight, because I was there at the same time and I wanted to pull my hair out. And when we're tired and we're stressed, we don't make the best decisions sometimes. So I'm really willing to give Robert a pass on that one because I know the guy and he's a great guy. And I want to stick together with my defi brethren and founders, because being on the other side, people who are not involved in projects, they don't know how tough it can be sometimes. And the pressures and trying to work with it in this 24/7 industry, I mean, I kind of understand why bankers in Wall street keep the hours that they do. It helps them keep their own sanity. And that's something that I think all the builders in DFI, we try our best to do good by the community, to build and to do the best that we know.
00:20:12.766 - 00:20:18.820, Speaker B: We're all people at the end of the day, too. So we're going to slip up. We're going to mess up at times.
00:20:19.350 - 00:20:39.210, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I totally agree with that take. And even Robert followed up that tweet. It's like, oh, yeah, guys, that was a boneheaded tweet. Sorry about that. But everyone's just trying to do the right thing. The thing they feel is right. It's just an interesting little dynamic in defi that some of these things happen, and then people go to crypto Twitter to see the drama.
00:20:39.210 - 00:20:41.674, Speaker A: Go ahead.
00:20:41.712 - 00:21:04.606, Speaker B: I remember before I was a founder and when a hack happened or something spicy happened. I'd weigh in with my hot take and fud something and get all the engagement from it. And it felt good to get that engagement, but then I started realizing that that kind of stuff, while it is like a little growth hack for your Twitter account, it kind of just makes you a dick.
00:21:04.718 - 00:21:05.380, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:21:07.350 - 00:21:22.722, Speaker B: Especially being on the other side. I don't want to do that. Of course, if there's a really bad actor in this space, call them out. But for the people who are out there and they just messed up or something like that, I have no interest in going after those people anymore. Totally.
00:21:22.786 - 00:21:32.886, Speaker A: Totally. So scoopy. We are hopefully at the cusp of a massive migration to L2. Does Alchemyx have any L2 plans?
00:21:33.078 - 00:22:28.540, Speaker B: Yeah. So we now have had five forks of alchemyx at this point in time, and we realized that if we don't go and cross the chasm to L2s and other chains, and other people will do it and fork our protocol over there. So definitely, we are looking to go to Arbitrum and Polygon. They're the most ethereum aligned L2s and side chains out there. But we're also open to what the community wants in alchemics. And if that is avalanche, if that is phantom, if that is BSc or Solana or one of these know, kind of like new, and I would say viable side chains, then I think that it's worth considering for us to do so.
00:22:28.910 - 00:22:37.680, Speaker A: Have you noticed any desire out of the. And first off, am I pronouncing it incorrectly when I say alchemy? Because you're saying alchemics is one of those correct?
00:22:38.850 - 00:22:55.234, Speaker B: I like to say alchemics. I did come up with the term, but if you say alchemy, that's fine, too. We have people from all over the world on our team, and everyone on the team says it differently, so it doesn't bother me. I didn't even notice you were saying it differently than I was. Okay.
00:22:55.272 - 00:23:07.400, Speaker A: In that case, I'll stick with Alchemyx, then. So, yeah. Is there any alignment or community coherence about having alchemyx being deployed on a non Ethereum layer one?
00:23:08.090 - 00:23:51.240, Speaker B: Yeah. There's been some debate in our discord. Somebody just was talking about the recent podcast that you did with Rune from Makerdao and a lot of the points that he made, and I've almost listened to the whole thing, and I think Roon makes a lot of good points, especially with the fact that bridges are what they are right now, which is sort of a glorified multi sig. But I also see that there's a lot of innovations being made in the bridging space, and I'm really, really excited about connect. And for full disclosure, as a part of egirl Capital, we did do a round with connect.
00:23:51.770 - 00:23:54.966, Speaker A: I also am in that round. So full disclosure there as well.
00:23:55.068 - 00:24:09.286, Speaker B: Yes, and I think that's going to bring a lot more security and trustlessness to bridging from one chain to another, because they have really awesome technology that lets you just send it from any EVM chain to any other EVM chain.
00:24:09.398 - 00:25:14.530, Speaker A: Right. What about Rune's argument that, his argument is that a lot of DeFi apps will have this incentive to deploy on everything that they can ever, all the l ones, regardless of the EVM compatibility or not. But then he says that, well, if you have an alchemy on Ethereum and then you have an alchemy on Salana, because you are doing the whole multi chain strategy, you actually might generate sufficient network effects outside of your home base, which is Ethereum, that you actually might force a core migration of your energies to a different. So Rune's argument is that, well, that's messy. And so he's just going to stick to Ethereum and Ethereum only because he doesn't actually want to contribute energies to building on an Ethereum competitor. Because if that Ethereum competitor wins, then maker has to do this messy migration to this new chain. Do you align with that argument at all, or do you think that it's not entirely accurate?
00:25:15.430 - 00:26:33.446, Speaker B: I could see that happening. But I think as far as alchemics goes, the way that we're envisioning, the way to deploy on other chains is that instead of giving minting keys for our Al assets on other chains, we would do is kind of mint them on layer one Ethereum and then bridge them over to other chains. And then just instead of when you go to borrow Ali SD minting from the zero address, it would just be taken from the actual contract itself, would have a balance of the al assets there. And I think by doing that, we can still have the security guarantees and ensure that Ethereum l one is our hub, it's our main base. And if somebody wants to go from polygon over to avalanche or something like that, then they would have to go to Ethereum mainnet, ben over to the other chain. So definitely Ethereum is the most secure. It's the chain that I have the most philosophical alignment with by far, because they never sacrificed on decentralization, whereas other ones, even if they have a really cool consensus mechanism.
00:26:33.446 - 00:27:27.340, Speaker B: A lot of times it's kind of just like deposits at the end of the day. And I think Ethereum managed to maintain their security and decentralization while also finding a way for scaling, whether that's through sharding and e two, but also roll ups. And I actually think that if ZK sync and or Starkware really delivers with their EVM compatible ZK roll ups, then it's game over for all these other chains anyway. Honestly, why would you go there when you can have lightning fast, super cheap transactions with the full security of Ethereum? But that technology is still a little far away out, and if there's opportunities, if there's demand on other chains, I think it should be at least considered to go and expand over there.
00:27:27.790 - 00:28:28.720, Speaker A: So Rune's argument, you talked about how if you guys don't deploy Alchemyx contracts on a L2, then somebody else will. And Rune's argument is kind of similar, but with other layer ones, right? And so you talked about how you actually don't need your minting contracts on a competitor layer one, you could just port the assets over there and that would be good enough. But then Rune's argument was, okay, well, you can bridge your assets over, but then you just leave the opportunity for someone to just fork your code and add the minting contracts to that alternative layer one. And now you have a competitor there that's native towards that ecosystem where your assets are just bridged over there and are non native. But what you're saying is you think that the connects protocol, the ITXP or XTP protocol, the interchange communication protocol, you think that is sufficiently secure where the non nativity of alchemy's assets on other layer ones doesn't matter. Is that correct?
00:28:30.530 - 00:29:15.274, Speaker B: I haven't done like a super deep technical dive, so I can't say without a shadow of a doubt if it's as secure 100% secure or not. But I know that the connect team has been working on this for years, and they have an awesome team. So I think if anybody can deliver a sufficiently trustless bridge, it's them. That's where I feel on that. And I think to kind of counter Rune's opinion on this is that even if you are on l one, there are going to be other people who try to take your lunch anyway, even on that chain. Look at LUSD. They're kind of going back to the single collateral die purity of just only eth collateral.
00:29:15.274 - 00:29:55.980, Speaker B: Then you have mim, with their ultra aggressive strategy for expansion, going across chains and using yield bearing collaterals, you also have, like USDP, there's lots of competition even on l one. I think that's probably the place where the competition is the fiercest. And so I think a lot of protocols that have a name for themselves on l one. When they go over to l two or to a side chain, it's like a really big deal over there because they don't have sort of the legitimacy of some of these big names. And so when they go over there, people are excited because it kind of brings legitimacy to their chain as well.
00:29:56.990 - 00:30:25.170, Speaker A: That's a really good take. As we finish off the aspects of alchemy, I want to ask about governance and community with regards to, because you talked about Alchemy V two and all the technical updates that are coming along there. But there's always the issue of the community participation in governance and the state of the discord. So how has the community rallied around Alchemy's governance, and what are those dynamics like, how have you guys tackled the governance.
00:30:27.030 - 00:31:28.134, Speaker B: Mean? I think we have a governance channel in our discord, and people come up with ideas a lot, and we also have a governance forum. And before, I was kind of like the sole officer of the Dow, making proposals and trying to get them through. But then recently, I'm just like, hey, this is a great idea. Why don't you write a proposal and telling that to people? And I think it's like, of the last six proposals, only two of them were written by me and the rest were written by other community members. So it's really good to see the people in the community coming into the fold and writing proposals and getting active in governance and going forward in V two, since it's going to be a lot more composable and people are going to be able to build apps on top of it, we want to get the community involved even more in community development as well. Right now, Alchemics V one doesn't have any extensibility to it. You can't compose apps with it, so it kind of cuts people off.
00:31:28.134 - 00:32:08.150, Speaker B: But V two is not like that at all. And people have been expressing interest. So we're actually using, or like, kind of beta testing some coordination tools internally. One is called coordinate. It's made by the urine team. And basically the gist of this one is that you get a bunch of people together in an instance, and then you set like a time period, like maybe a month, maybe two months, and then you fund it, saying, okay, let's say there's $50,000 worth of rewards for here, everybody in the Instance gets a token called give. And then based on the amount of give tokens that they receive from others, in the instance, it determines their payout.
00:32:08.150 - 00:32:40.720, Speaker B: So people will be posting up their git, commits, their other contributions, whether that's through education or marketing and things like that. People will see what others are doing and then give those tokens to them accordingly. And I think they have a really cool tool that helps you visualize it too. It's like sort of like this graph that you can see who is giving tokens to who. So that way some bad actors get in there and try to make a cartel and game the system. The admins in the system can just be like, yo, you're out of here. Nice.
00:32:43.750 - 00:32:56.580, Speaker A: Community incentivization, I think is how dows ultimately win. Where are you in the process of implementing that? Have you already had your first coordinate round finish?
00:32:57.270 - 00:33:28.382, Speaker B: We're just beta testing, just like really small. It's not formal yet, but we're trying to get the structures in place. Our team is crunching super hard right now on our v two code. We're having code freeze either today or tomorrow. And then we are finishing up our testing and documentation suite for the remainder of the month. And then once we have a little breather there, we are going to go full steam ahead and really get the organization ready for more and more contributors to come in and work with us. Right?
00:33:28.436 - 00:33:46.870, Speaker A: Yeah. Smart contracts are hard and also so is governance. Right. So it makes sense to take those things one at a time. How big is the Alchemyx team? And are you guys a formal registered company, or is it more of a loosely defined set of Internet contributors?
00:33:47.610 - 00:34:02.650, Speaker B: We are a loosely defined set of Internet contributors, frog army. And our team is. Let me count now, we've added somebody recently, so what does it mean to add someone?
00:34:02.720 - 00:34:04.940, Speaker A: How does that work if you're not a company?
00:34:05.310 - 00:34:41.110, Speaker B: So we have sort of like an internal core team without a company. Instead of pre mining a bunch of alchemics tokens and then giving them to the founders or core team members, what we did is we made a special pool in our farming contract and then made a token for it that only the core members have. And then we all get the same amount of this token. So it's very egalitarian and flat. And then we put it in the staking contract and we get Alcx kind of linearly vested towards us that way. Cool. Very cool.
00:34:41.110 - 00:35:03.098, Speaker B: Yes. So when we onboard somebody, usually what happens is we give them a couple of months trial to see if they're a good fit with us, see if they're a good worker and they gel with a team, and then we do a unanimous vote to bring somebody in. So everyone's in agreement. So and so let's make them core, then they become core.
00:35:03.274 - 00:35:08.800, Speaker A: Neat. Neat. Okay, so that's very much decentralized from day one ethos, is that right?
00:35:09.490 - 00:35:29.982, Speaker B: Yes, the team is like a core team, so it has some centralization aspect to it. And we do have some managerial roles because we have a multi sig and time lock for our governance at the moment. It's like that. So we're on our way towards decentralization.
00:35:30.126 - 00:35:39.450, Speaker A: Well, as opposed to employment contracts and stuff like that. It seems to be your dog fooding defi in order to create your organization.
00:35:39.870 - 00:35:58.640, Speaker B: Yes, we pay die to our people who come in and then once they become part of core and they get the time token to stake into the staking pools contract that we have, then they become ALCX lifers at that point.
00:36:01.330 - 00:36:29.862, Speaker A: And so you talked about coordinate and also you have in your roadmap to really double down on governance. But any last comments about how you have incentivized the community to self actualize and write the proposals themselves? It's fantastic to see that you only wrote two out of the six proposals. Do you have any tips or tricks to help incentivize the community to actually go from just like a discord stray thought idea to an actual proposal? Anything we can learn there?
00:36:29.996 - 00:37:06.980, Speaker B: Yeah, whenever anybody writes a proposal. So four of the last six, we've had a lot more than six total, but we have a really awesome, we have the tip CC bot and we have that hooked up with Al USD, Al eth and Alcx. And whenever anybody writes a proposal, we always make sure to give them a generous tip whether it passes or not. I know that synthetics did that in their discord when anybody would write a synthetics improvement proposal, and I noticed that and I saw how that got people actively writing proposals and I thought, yeah, why don't we do the same?
00:37:07.510 - 00:38:06.482, Speaker A: Very cool. Hey guys, I hope you're enjoying the conversation with Scoopy. Thus far in the second half of the show is when we get into this new DeFi primitive with regards to liquidity, mining and governance token yield farming. Scoopy thinks that if this is adopted across all protocols that have yield farming mechanisms, that we might actually be able to see a resurgence of the ETH DeFI ratio, the ether to DPI token, because he thinks that a lot of tokens have not seen the price appreciation that they could have because of this now broken yield farming mechanism that is just not up to date with the current state of DEFI. So Scoopy walks us through this new primitive that he thinks can change the tide of deFi, and so we're going to go ahead and get right into that. But first, a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible. Arbitrum is an Ethereum scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use DFI and NFTs.
00:38:06.482 - 00:38:49.554, Speaker A: And now it's live and has over 100 projects deployed. Gas fees on Ethereum l one suck too many people want to use Ethereum, and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us. And that's why teams like arbitrum have been hard at work developing L2 solutions that makes transactions on Ethereum cheap and instant. Arbitrum increases Ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude, at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying. When interacting with arbitrum, you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into Ethereum's level of security and decentralization. This is why people are calling this Ethereum's broadband moment, where we get to add performance onto decentralization and security. If you're a developer and you want to save on gas costs and overall make a better user experience, go to developers offchainlabs.com
00:38:49.554 - 00:39:26.686, Speaker A: to get started building on Arbitrum. And if you're a user, keep an eye out for your favorite DFI apps being built on Arbitrum. Many DFI applications on the Ethereum L1 are migrating over to L2s like Arbitrum, and some are even skipping over the layer ones entirely and deploying directly on L2. There's so many apps coming online to Arbitrum, so go to bridge Arbitrum IO now and start bridging over your eth or any of the tokens listed and start having the DFI or NFT experience that you've always wanted. Living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys. Not your keys, not your crypto. That's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallet, which makes proper private key management a breeze.
00:39:26.686 - 00:40:08.542, Speaker A: But the ledger ecosystem is much more than just a secure hardware wallet. Ledger is the combination of the Ledger hardware wallet and the Ledger live app. And if you're used to seeing all of your crypto services and favorite defi apps all in one spot, Ledger live is where you want to be. Not only does Ledger let you buy your crypto assets straight from the app, but it also hooks into all of the defi apps and services that you're used to using Ledger Live. You can stake your Ethan Lido, swap on Dexs like Paraswap, or display your nfts with Rainbow. You can also use wallet Connect inside of ledger live to connect to all the other defi apps that keep coming online. Defi never stops growing and the Ledger live app grows alongside with it.
00:40:08.542 - 00:40:42.410, Speaker A: So click the link in the show notes to see all of the defi apps that Ledger Live has. And stay tuned as more apps come online. And if you don't have a Ledger hardware wallet, what are you even waiting for? Go to ledger.com, grab a ledger, download Ledger live, and get all of your DFI apps all in one space. Scoopy, you recently put out a tweet thread about DFI 2.0, which talked about a new generation of DFI apps that are coming online into the ecosystem. Could you summarize your thoughts that you put into your thread for the listeners?
00:40:42.830 - 00:42:03.918, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think if you take a top down approach to it, it's sort of the difference between yield farming and protocol controlled value, right? So when you're doing yield farming, essentially you put in a token into a staking contract, and then you get the governance token back out from it as a reward for doing, it's a renting of liquidity. And then what happens in that, since a lot of times there might be like a stable asset pair, like for alchemics, we have the Al USD three curve pool and then the al eth pool in the al eth saddle and curve pools, right? So those are all very low risk for people to supply liquidity. And so they kind of just treat it as a place where they can get ALcx and then dump it. And that's the kind of same across everywhere in defi, anyone that offers a pool two or pool ones, or more of like these kind of stable asset pools, people just sort of see the governance token as their yield and they'll cash it out to eth or stablecoins. And, you know, this, this then kind of like migrates over to the pool two. Normally pool two are people who are very aligned with the project. You know, they feel good enough in order to take that risk and the impermanent loss in hoping that the rewards that they get will more than make up for the impermanent loss.
00:42:03.918 - 00:42:29.850, Speaker B: But when other people are dumping and that toxic liquidity comes in and that toxic liquidity is in there because they think they can dump on the believers and profit off of them. And in that dynamic, even the believers will be like, man. Because such and such, this giant VC whale or whoever is dumping on me, the only good strategy for me left over now is to do the same.
00:42:29.920 - 00:42:31.038, Speaker A: So dump, right?
00:42:31.124 - 00:43:48.902, Speaker B: Yes. And so it turns what should be a community coordination tool into a PvP game. And people are trying to outsmart and be more cunning than each other and play off of each other. So it kind of gets rid of that cooperation that you really actually need in a dow in a decentralized protocol. And you, I think deep down I knew this probably back in May or even June, and I was scrambling, thinking, what can we do to fix it? What can we do to fix it? How can we turn this tide around? I'd done a lot of analysis of other protocols that had yield farming, especially as DeFi and the DeFi pulse index was really kind of lagging against ETh. It dawned on me that even with all these great revenues, these DeFi protocols are pulling in and they're skyrocketing tvls, their token prices weren't matching with them and they were bleeding against ETh so terribly. And I was like, why is this? And that's where I had that realization about these liquidity flows and this kind of pvp kind of dynamic that's going there.
00:43:48.902 - 00:44:25.040, Speaker B: And there was one protocol that stood out compared to all the other ones, one that I initially brushed off, and that's Olympus Dow. And instead of just having people yield farm and get the token that way, what they did is they offered their community discounted prices to get the Om token by essentially purchasing their lp tokens. So what was once a rent to own is now a kind of.
00:44:27.270 - 00:44:27.634, Speaker A: Pay.
00:44:27.672 - 00:44:45.560, Speaker B: To rent is now a bond to own model for protocols. And what happens is the protocol starts getting more and more of its own liquidity and the protocol is not going to dump on itself.
00:44:46.170 - 00:44:48.440, Speaker A: Right, okay.
00:44:50.270 - 00:46:05.170, Speaker B: And as the protocol gets more and more and more of its share of the liquidity on the markets, then it gives everybody involved, all the investors involved, a lot of confidence that the bottom is not going to fall out. Right? And then traders know that hey, there's all this liquidity, I know I can trade and the markets are still going to be there. So traders trade and volume goes up and then people's investors come in and they're like, wow, the market makers are not dumping and manipulating the price. I'm going to get in. I think this is a good investment and sort of all this stuff kind of dawned on me that it kind of flipped the dynamic on its head because liquidity is super important, but how you get it really matters. And seeing how the Olympus Dow community was really cooperative with each other and everyone was really vibing over there, for lack of a better word, it made me really think about it. And so over the summer I reached out to Olympusdao and I asked them know, possibly offering their tech for alchemics because I wanted to do something about this.
00:46:05.170 - 00:47:03.090, Speaker B: And I was kind of hesitant to add things like token vesting and other lockup mechanisms or even really dramatically altering the emission schedule because especially the last one, dramatically altering the emission schedules. I've seen other projects do this and it kind of backfired. People were expecting there would be a pump once the inflation went down, but then nothing happened and then the protocol didn't have as much incentivization for liquidity and then the TVL dropped and then it kind of went down this spiral. And I also, as somebody who has been yield farming since 2018. Yeah, I guess it was 2018. No it wasn't 2018. It was early 2019 when synthetics sort of had their kind of ad hoc seal on uniswap that they incentivized.
00:47:03.090 - 00:47:58.470, Speaker B: I was in there in the early days and then obviously compound Wifi and the rest. And I really like yield farming, but I don't like yield farming contracts where it's like they make you lock up or you try to go claim and you can't get all the tokens and you have to vest them. I never liked that. And I was like, not my cup of tea. So when I approached them about Olympusdao and using their bonding services and they were like, yes, we actually started thinking about this ourselves and offering this to other protocols because we had the same realizations as you. And that was kind of the seeds of Olympus Pro, which is their newly launched app, that we were one of the launch partners with them. Essentially what they can do is they can kind of trade lp tokens for a governance token at a discount.
00:47:58.470 - 00:48:38.674, Speaker B: And the way that it works is really genius. Basically there's no oracles involved, it's all just market dynamics. So it's just you initialize the bond program, set initial price, how much tokens that you want to sell weekly and things like that. And the Olympus team actually helps you set this all up and they're there to support you. So if you are thinking about going there, there is a lot of support and then the more time there is between bond sales, the greater the discount will be. And then when somebody finally does buy the bond, the price goes up, so the discount then goes away. Right.
00:48:38.674 - 00:49:06.460, Speaker B: So it always tries to find how much the market wants to discount the token at the time. And so there's always constant buy pressure for the bond. So the protocol is always going to be increasing its liquidity. This way it's not as fast, it's not like a shortcut to getting liquidity like a pool two would be, or liquidity mining is. It's more of a gradual process.
00:49:06.910 - 00:49:09.686, Speaker A: It's more sustainable at the same time. Right, because there's always trade offs.
00:49:09.718 - 00:49:16.478, Speaker B: Yes, it's a lot more sustainable. You're not going to inflate your token away by doing this.
00:49:16.644 - 00:49:32.210, Speaker A: Okay, so let's go through the dynamics of this just one more time, just because I haven't totally wrapped my head around this. The currency that you're using to buy the token, is that defined or is that up to any protocol that wants to use this method?
00:49:32.630 - 00:49:55.270, Speaker B: It's completely up to the protocol for what they want to do. Right now, a common token, it's LP shares, LP shares, sushi swap, Uniswap, et cetera. Those LP shares are used to. You basically trade those LP shares for the native governance token.
00:49:55.350 - 00:50:09.406, Speaker A: And so it's the LP share of the governance token. So like if it's alchemy, it's Alchemyx Eth is the LP share and you're selling Alchemy's EtH LP share for more Alchemyx, correct?
00:50:09.588 - 00:50:38.314, Speaker B: Yes, that's correct. But it doesn't have to be limited to that. Alchemics, we have other pools that are really important to us, like the Al USD three curve pool and then Al ETH pools. Pretty soon we're going to be offering the bonding service for them as well, so people can trade in those tokens for ALCX as well. And that's going to be really important for the long term sustainability of alchemics because we definitely need liquid markets for our protocol to work the best it can work.
00:50:38.512 - 00:51:20.950, Speaker A: Okay, so you take the preferred LP token for whatever protocol sounds like. For Alchemyx, there's multiple LP tokens. So multiple work and then you bond it in the sense that you put it into a contract for a period of time. And then by doing that you get the ability to purchase the governance token. In the Alchemyx world, it's the ALCX token, and then you put it in the contracts and you get to purchase this token at a discount, and then time passes, and then over time, somebody else comes and buys the bond. Is that right?
00:51:21.100 - 00:51:41.370, Speaker B: It's a little bit different than that. Sorry, I might not have explained it very well or got you tripped up there. So, basically, when you go to the Olympus Dow side or Olympus Pro, and you go to purchase a bond, you'll see that there's a certain discount that you can get on it, but the currency that you buy the bond with is the LP share, right?
00:51:41.440 - 00:51:42.722, Speaker A: Right, yep.
00:51:42.886 - 00:51:58.302, Speaker B: So when that happens, the protocol immediately gets that LP share. Right. And then there's, like, a seven day vesting contract for the governance token that you just bought.
00:51:58.366 - 00:51:58.690, Speaker A: Okay.
00:51:58.760 - 00:51:59.620, Speaker B: That's also.
00:52:00.470 - 00:52:09.138, Speaker A: So you sell, like, $90 of an LP share for $100 worth of tokens, but you're not going to get those $100 for seven days or so.
00:52:09.304 - 00:52:26.938, Speaker B: Yeah. They linearly vest over the period of the vesting, and the vesting period can be configured however you want to. If you want it to be a week, that's fine. If you want to be a month, that's fine. It's just one parameter that you set when you're initializing the bonds, and you can also alter it even while it's live.
00:52:27.104 - 00:52:27.820, Speaker A: Okay?
00:52:28.910 - 00:52:29.660, Speaker B: Yes.
00:52:31.310 - 00:52:32.940, Speaker A: Then what happens next?
00:52:33.330 - 00:53:09.960, Speaker B: So, after you buy the bond, you wait for it to vest. If you want to do a partial claim halfway through, you can do that as well, or anytime. And then you have that token, and some people who are long term aligned with the protocol will just hold it and add it to their portfolio. Other people they might want to do is try to play the spread like, hey, I just got a 9% discount on this ALCX tokens. And if I sell now, that's a 9% profit I got after this week, assuming that the token doesn't budge in price during that time.
00:53:10.330 - 00:53:26.000, Speaker A: And in theory, they could just go do this again. Right. If they got a 9% spread, 9% arbitrage, they have, in theory, 9% more capital than they did if prices didn't stay. If prices stayed the same. So they could just keep on doing this over and over and over again and keep harking this bread over and over and over again.
00:53:26.450 - 00:53:35.758, Speaker B: They could, potentially. But there's also risk involved. If the price of ALCX goes down in the meantime, then they wouldn't have profited.
00:53:35.854 - 00:53:52.406, Speaker A: Right. So that seven day vesting schedule is what keeps people that are less aligned away, because people that are more aligned are more willing to take that price risk because they believe in the protocol regardless. Is that correct? Yes.
00:53:52.508 - 00:54:37.958, Speaker B: And it's also one of those things that the ALCX eth SLP token, it's very deep and very liquid and especially with our V two coming up, we got on Olympus Pro, we were selected as one of the reactors in Tokamac. So kind of like things are on the up and up, I think for alchemics and if somebody's going to be in that SLP pool for ETH alchemics, they might experience a lot of impermanent loss on the way up for alchemics, assuming it does go up, this is not financial advice. So that's also another layer of strategy for people to consider while they are thinking about doing bonding through Olympus Pro.
00:54:38.124 - 00:55:14.354, Speaker A: Okay, so explain again to me the differences between yield farming. You put your ether or your pool, two tokens, your LP tokens into a contract and then you receive governance tokens distribution. In this model you put your LP tokens, you sell your LP tokens to the protocol to receive the governance tokens. But if you are just receiving the governance tokens, which I'm pretty sure are newly minted, and you are selling them to do that again and again and again, how is that different than just dumping the yield farms from the original method? Where does that difference come in?
00:55:14.472 - 00:55:46.410, Speaker B: So if people are only playing the strategy where they are recycling the ALCX, they get from the bonds back into SLP to buy more bonds. That's essentially exactly what's going on with yield farming, especially like the yield aggregators who take the LP tokens and stuff like that. It's essentially the exact same thing except that the protocol is now getting more and more and more of that liquidity share and it's rooting out the toxic liquidity that's a part of that pool.
00:55:46.910 - 00:55:51.590, Speaker A: Selling mechanism that forces that one way function of liquidity into the protocol.
00:55:51.750 - 00:56:05.186, Speaker B: Yes, it's a one way thing. The people in Olympus pro and Olympus Dow, like they're not going to be selling their own LP shares, they're not going to be like cashing them out and dumping on you and stuff like that, right?
00:56:05.208 - 00:56:13.300, Speaker A: Because it's much more capital intensive, right? Because you are selling your LP shares, you don't get to recycle that capital because you already sold it.
00:56:13.830 - 00:57:02.770, Speaker B: Well the thing is, let's say you can do that. So if you trade $10,000 worth of an LP share and you have a 10% discount, right, then you get $11,000 with the LCX, which then gives you more ammo to then go in and then sell half of it and then get more LP shares and then repeat the process. You could do that and I'm sure that there are people who use that strategy, but even if they do that, the protocol is earning that. The protocol is accumulating more and more of that LP and eventually it'll start to outnumber or be the majority holder of liquidity for the protocol itself. And then when that happens, it kind of flushes out all of the toxic liquidity. Right?
00:57:02.840 - 00:57:03.278, Speaker A: Neat.
00:57:03.374 - 00:57:46.980, Speaker B: So I like to think of LP farming or liquidity farming, or yield farming rather as kind of like a drug. Right? It's really awesome at first, right? It makes your protocol grow, it puts you on the map. Steroids, or it's like even heroin for that matter. You're in euphoria when you first launch, the float is low and the only way people can get that APY is to buy your token. But eventually that drug, that becomes a problem and you become addicted to it and you rely on it. But it also, just like a drug turns into a very toxic thing in your life or for the protocol in this case. And I like to think of olympus pro.
00:57:46.980 - 00:58:08.034, Speaker B: I know I've been shilling them so hard today, but I like to think of them as like tokenomic rehab. Yeah. You flush out that toxicity and you get on your road to recovery and make sure that the liquidity in the pool is aligned with the interests of the protocol.
00:58:08.162 - 00:58:11.802, Speaker A: Right. It's like pesticides for the liquidity locusts out there.
00:58:11.936 - 00:58:15.078, Speaker B: Yes, exactly. That's a good analogy.
00:58:15.174 - 00:58:32.510, Speaker A: Yeah. No, I like ending these more technical conversations on analogies because they allow the listeners to latch onto something Scoopy. Where does this go? Do you think everyone should adopt this new primitive? And what does this really unlock?
00:58:33.590 - 00:59:26.594, Speaker B: I think that if you are a DeFi protocol with a robust yield farming program, especially one that's finite, I think that you should definitely do this because, yeah, you might bootstrap your liquidity, but what happens when the rewards run out? Most of that mercenary capital, especially if it's this toxic liquidity flow, they're just going to drop you dump your token and then move on to the next one to harvest. So I definitely recommend other builders in the space, other protocols to. And I think, you know, if more and more people in protocols do this, then it's kind of turned the tide for Defi, which has kind of been suffering over the past number of months against ETH in the broader market. And I think it's going to be a part of the resurgence of DeFi, a big part of it.
00:59:26.712 - 00:59:36.930, Speaker A: Do you think that if, that this new mechanism, new primitive gets adopted that it ultimately might show up in the ETH, DPI pair.
00:59:39.530 - 00:59:42.230, Speaker B: Alchemics or ohm or what?
00:59:42.380 - 00:59:56.454, Speaker A: No, I mean if you talk about it's a resurgence to DeFi, do you actually think DPI as in just like indicator of DeFI at large, do you think that this might actually turn the tide on the DPi versus ETH ratio?
00:59:56.582 - 01:00:03.950, Speaker B: I mean if the protocols that are listed on DPI adopt this, then yeah, I think it would help turn the tide.
01:00:05.410 - 01:00:06.062, Speaker A: Interesting.
01:00:06.196 - 01:00:56.222, Speaker B: I also think that kind of a transition away from worthless governance tokens to tokens that do revenue share and dividends or however, whatever mechanism they decide is also going to help turn the tide as well. Because when people see that, they see it's an investable asset and then DPI, they could actually participate in the staking of these tokens in their networks and then use that to even compound the gains as well. So I definitely think that it's going to help rehab DFI. Nice. We saw our TVL go up 100 x over the past year for DFI and the tokens have not 100 x along with it. Right.
01:00:56.276 - 01:00:59.118, Speaker A: Interesting. That's a really good point. That's definitely a really good point.
01:00:59.204 - 01:01:02.062, Speaker B: Even though it should have like by all metrics it should have. Right?
01:01:02.116 - 01:01:10.078, Speaker A: Yeah. Total value locked in. DFI is about to hit all time highs and tokens are not anywhere near all their all time highs.
01:01:10.254 - 01:01:24.006, Speaker B: Even the juggernauts are not doing well. They've been flat, especially down against ETH and those are ones even with really impressive revenues as well.
01:01:24.108 - 01:01:31.418, Speaker A: Scoopy, you have definitely given me something to talk about. So maybe I need to go over to the Olympus Dow and pull them into a podcast, get them to talk about this.
01:01:31.584 - 01:01:42.806, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. I can intro you to people on their team. Yeah, no problem. There's one other cool protocol that's like imminently launching Tokamac.
01:01:42.918 - 01:01:45.662, Speaker A: Yeah, we did a meet the nation with them.
01:01:45.796 - 01:02:12.774, Speaker B: Yeah, they're really cool and I think they're also going to be part of this DFI 2.0 wave of finding more healthy sources of liquidity for participants in DFI and for protocols. Yeah, so we're really excited to be on top of them. They have an awesome team, I'm sure you know, because you talk to them and stuff like that. So I'm excited to be working with them and yeah, we just did a dow to dow token swap with them.
01:02:12.892 - 01:02:14.850, Speaker A: Oh really? Oh that's fantastic.
01:02:15.010 - 01:02:31.930, Speaker B: Yeah, they are a large, I think they're now, I think our fifth or 6th largest stakeholder outside of some of our investors and some of the bigger whales. And we now have a lot of Toka ourselves. So we will be directing liquidity over at alchemics in the Tokamac protocol.
01:02:32.510 - 01:02:46.046, Speaker A: That is kind of like the bullish case for Tokamac is that everybody wants their token because all the Defi apps want the power to direct the liquidity towards the ways that align with them. So Tokamax seems like a perfect protocol to do a token swap with.
01:02:46.228 - 01:03:47.526, Speaker B: Yeah, we're excited. I think there's a lot of alignment, and I think there's going to be a lot of dows kind of scrambling to get their hands on Toka, especially as they get reactors in the system and stuff like that. We even saw it in the core event as people were vying to get selected as their reactor protocols and supporters of protocols were scrambling to buy Toka so they could influence the vote and stuff like that. And it was just like the coolest governance experiment I've ever seen in my life, and I was just glued to the page. I know I had a horse in the race, so to speak, but even then, it was just fascinating to see the leaderboard always constantly shifting and then seeing people lobby on Twitter. I kind of activated a cheat code, and I said, yeah, we'll give you an NFT if you vote for us. And I was looking at the data and I see, like, a bunch of ones that are like, one toke, vote for us.
01:03:47.526 - 01:03:50.120, Speaker B: I'm like, oh, you guys just want the NFT, obviously.
01:03:53.530 - 01:04:16.862, Speaker A: That's pretty funny dynamics going on in this new era of what is kind of like DFI 2.0, right? A new era of D five protocols coming and building on Ethereum that look a lot different from the legacy protocols. Wow, do I use that word like maker, dow, compound? Definitely a new cohort of protocols coming into the ecosystem right now.
01:04:16.916 - 01:04:22.270, Speaker B: Let's call them the generation one protocol. Generation one. I think that's a little bit nicer of a term.
01:04:22.690 - 01:04:26.482, Speaker A: Yeah, because we use legacy to knock the legacy financial system.
01:04:26.616 - 01:05:07.680, Speaker B: Yes, Gen one. I mean, huge shout out to all of those protocols. We're standing on the shoulders of giants over here. It was originally me listening to Epicenter podcast in 2018 with all the interviews with Rune and him talking about maker down, me listening to the podcast, like ten times in a row just to get my mind around the idea. And now these ideas are mundane, right? Think how far we've come. It's amazing. And I think when Gen three D five comes out, we're all going to have our minds blown by what all those 16 year olds at Rarity capital are going to be doing and stuff.
01:05:08.210 - 01:05:16.110, Speaker A: I'm very ready to just sit back and become a crypto boomer while innovation just goes and outpaces my ability to keep up with it.
01:05:16.260 - 01:05:19.380, Speaker B: We'll be semi retired farmers in a few years together, man.
01:05:20.710 - 01:05:21.170, Speaker A: Awesome.
