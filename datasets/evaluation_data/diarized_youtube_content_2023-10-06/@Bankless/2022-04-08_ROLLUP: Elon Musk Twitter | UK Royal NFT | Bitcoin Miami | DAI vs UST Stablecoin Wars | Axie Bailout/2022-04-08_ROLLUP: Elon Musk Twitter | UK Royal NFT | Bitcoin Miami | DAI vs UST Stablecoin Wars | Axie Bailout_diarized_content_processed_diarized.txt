00:00:00.250 - 00:00:11.034, Speaker A: This is the first royal NFT. Okay. Queen Elizabeth in on the knighted NFT, the holy. Yeah. Hey, bankless nation.
00:00:11.082 - 00:00:12.474, Speaker B: Happy first week of April.
00:00:12.522 - 00:00:17.530, Speaker A: This is the first week in April 2022 that we are doing what, David?
00:00:17.610 - 00:00:33.154, Speaker B: Oh, we're rolling up the week in crypto, Ryan, where we condense the entire week of cryptocurrency, which is always an ambitious endeavor, yet we persevere nonetheless. So many crazy things happened this week. Gosh, Ryan, you want to tell us about. Give us the tease.
00:00:33.202 - 00:00:51.486, Speaker A: Tease us. Yeah, look, okay, I'll give you the little tease. So Elon Musk just became the largest shareholder in Twitter. And for those of you who are like, that's not crypto news, well, Twitter is like crypto social governance protocol. Basically. A lot of the social layer of crypto happens on Twitter. So we're going to talk about that.
00:00:51.486 - 00:01:00.538, Speaker A: UK. The UK United Kingdom is minting an NFT. This is the first royal NFT. Okay. Queen Elizabeth in on the knighted NFT.
00:01:00.634 - 00:01:01.390, Speaker B: The holy.
00:01:02.050 - 00:01:16.210, Speaker A: Yeah, it's. It's a very special royal NFT. So we're excited about that. And the UK talk as well. Also, the stablecoin wars are heating up. If you haven't heard of the stablecoin wars, we'll talk about them. There's this thing called four pool on curve.
00:01:16.210 - 00:01:24.274, Speaker A: There's a lot of detail here, but the key thing is stablecoins are getting aggro with each other, like communities coming after one another and trying to conquer.
00:01:24.322 - 00:01:37.958, Speaker B: Market share, while Doe Kwan is trying to basically kill Dai, according to his own tweets. Meanwhile, Makerdao is making deals with Tesla at the same time. So there are some deep things to be talking about in the stablecoin wars.
00:01:37.974 - 00:01:55.282, Speaker A: This week, Luna is also buying bitcoin and avex. So that's what we're going to be talking about. Not eth, though. So that's interesting political choice. A lot more to say about that. Okay, guys, before we get in, we want to tell you about this really exciting NFT opportunity. All right, so this is an NFT that goes to a good cause.
00:01:55.282 - 00:02:48.590, Speaker A: That's the first thing you need to know. So it is National Awareness Day for HIV and AIDS on April 10, and Mac, the makeup company consensus NFT, they're partnering up, teaming up to present some art by the artist Keith Herring. Some fantastic art here embodied in an NFT, and all of the proceeds go to support those affected youth affected by HIV and AIDS. So really cool opportunity if you've never partaked in the NFT, sort of shenanigans as David calls them. This is a good starter NFT. Some of the lowest tier mints cost $25, and then upwards of there, there's a limited supply, and the art is really cool. David, Keith Herring, I've had an opportunity to look up more of his art, and I'm sure you've probably seen it in pop culture references, but he's done some incredible work here in the past.
00:02:48.740 - 00:03:31.098, Speaker B: Yeah, actually, I didn't know the name Keith Herring, but I knew the art by Keith Herring. Very iconic art. And so this is actually a pretty interesting opportunity. We have a very big company, Mac Cosmetics, pairing up with consensus, one of the biggest crypto companies, using the art of Keith Herring, an absolutely massive artist in the space to make some nfts where 100% of the revenue from these nfts is going to youth, HIV AIDS awareness. So just a lot of cool things all in this NFT project. And so perhaps this might be the NFT project for you. Maybe you're looking at all these monkey pictures and all these, all the weird nfts.
00:03:31.098 - 00:03:38.430, Speaker B: But if you want to get into an NFT and also feel good about it, maybe this is the first NFT for you. If you've not yet minted an NFT.
00:03:38.590 - 00:04:06.902, Speaker A: So if you want to hear about that sign up so you don't miss it, go visit the link in the show notes. It's bankless Cc, Capital A, sorry, Capital M, Capital A, capital C. And you'll be directed to that where you can sign up. David, some other things going on is we are doing an episode on Treasure Dow, treasure ecosystem. And I think that's cool in and of itself. But also this is a new show series that we're playing around with. Tell us about this, David.
00:04:06.966 - 00:04:49.398, Speaker B: Yeah, we're calling this the Alpha League series. Basically, anytime that there is a community out there who wants to present the bull case for that community, bankless is here for you. So I started out with this whole series with Makerdao, and then this is going to be the second show in that series, treasure Dow. And so I'm just posting on Twitter who should come on next. So if you are a part of a community and you think that the bullcase for that community needs to be heard, make sure you're following bankless and me on Twitter because I will always listen to who gets the most energy into these tweet. Know, you got to get that engagement, Ryan. And that's how we decide who's coming on next is who wants this the most.
00:04:49.398 - 00:05:00.970, Speaker B: So treasure the ecosystem really, really vibrant community had never been on bankless before, but now they will be. And so your community can be on bankless too. So, yeah. Stay tuned for more.
00:05:01.040 - 00:05:03.094, Speaker A: I can't wait for the Cardano episode. David.
00:05:03.142 - 00:05:05.420, Speaker B: Oh God, what did I just do?
00:05:06.050 - 00:05:17.086, Speaker A: I think you may have said too much. Speaking of saying too much, though, I don't think we're doing that in the bankless Alpha report. But there is a lot disclosed in the Alpha report, a lot of alpha.
00:05:17.118 - 00:05:51.590, Speaker B: Okay, so this is where you get your alpha. There is, I think, a growing need for people that are really just paying attention to the token ecosystem as attention goes from one token to another. The bankless alpha report is where you get an understanding as why is attention going to where it is? So this is coming off of analyst Benghiyev. He's a super hungry zoomer analyst in the DeFi space. He's the methodologist behind the GMI index and he pays attention to defi more than anyone that I know. He is on the bleeding edge. He is on the frontier.
00:05:51.590 - 00:06:43.482, Speaker B: And so he is covering the hottest tokens that have captured people's attention in the last month or so. He's explained why they've captured attention, and then he gives his rating, overweight, underweight or neutral, along with some price targets and some analysis and justifications as well. This is going out to bankless premium subscribers for those that pay $22 a month. This will be an ongoing thing every single month to capture some of the hottest themes and the biggest alpha that Ben discovers, Ben and the rest of the bankless analyst team discovers in the Defi space. So if you are a bankless premium subscriber, this Alpha report is coming to your inbox today, Friday as you are listening to this. So go check it out. You can see the preview here, but the text is hidden and so expect this to come out every single month and just to always be a rotation of the hottest tokens that are in people's mindshare every single month.
00:06:43.482 - 00:06:44.990, Speaker B: Ryan, anything to add to that?
00:06:45.060 - 00:07:13.320, Speaker A: Oh, dude, I'm super excited about this because I actually want to know. Right? It's like we're so busy with the day to day of kind of managing all of the news and the ecosystems to spend the in depth time that our analysts do and finding actual token opportunities and what the catalysts might be. It's something I don't have time for. So this is something I'm going to pay a lot of attention to and I can't wait to read the entire thing. I've read part of it now, David, but I'm going to give it all my attention soon.
00:07:14.890 - 00:07:25.386, Speaker B: We asked Ben to put in these digests to really bolster up the bankless roll up and what we talk about. But then we just realized, you know what, let's just put into a report. And so that's what we did.
00:07:25.488 - 00:07:35.038, Speaker A: Absolutely. Okay. Speaking of reports, I guess market report, what's the market telling us right now? Bitcoin. Where are we at on the week?
00:07:35.204 - 00:07:48.274, Speaker B: It's a whomp whomp whomp week, Ryan. Bitcoin is down 7%. Started the week at $46,000. Hit a low of $43,000 to where we currently are at now at 43 and $43.6 thousand.
00:07:48.392 - 00:07:53.410, Speaker A: Okay, we're down, we're down. Let's look at the three month. Still up. Still up a little bit.
00:07:53.480 - 00:07:55.566, Speaker B: Crab, crabby, uppie, crab.
00:07:55.678 - 00:08:00.582, Speaker A: Year to date, we're kind of down ish, but it's all been crab. How about ether? What's that looking like on the week?
00:08:00.636 - 00:08:21.930, Speaker B: Ether price started the week at $3,300. Hit a low of $3,150. But it also had an inter week high of $3,550. Looked really good. Ryan, trying to break out to the upside. It failed that breakdown, and now the bears are in control again. But also not really because we didn't really break down below 3100.
00:08:21.930 - 00:08:28.298, Speaker B: So crabby week, but down overall. Down 6%, I think. Yeah, down 6% over three k. It's.
00:08:28.314 - 00:08:30.000, Speaker A: A good day is what I say.
00:08:30.370 - 00:08:32.154, Speaker B: And you know it's true because of rhymes.
00:08:32.202 - 00:08:49.286, Speaker A: Yeah, that's true for anything eth bitcoin. We'll talk about maybe why we're down on the weekends in a second, because I think some of this has to do with the fed news this week. But before we get there, the ETH bitcoin chart on the ratio, the all important ETH bitcoin ratio, what's that looking like this week?
00:08:49.388 - 00:09:11.094, Speaker B: It's looking good, Ryan. Last week it was at zero. 72. This week it's at zero. 74. So above a little bit more than a 2% growth on the week, you can't be disappointed. We didn't really get the US dollar breakout that we wanted, but the ETH BTC, the risk appetite indicator, is slowly grinding upwards.
00:09:11.222 - 00:09:24.430, Speaker A: Okay. Crypto hungry for more risk, I guess. The bet index, which tries to moderate some of that volatility in that risk. A third, a third, a third with. That's a third bitcoin, a third DFI tokens, and a third ETH. What's that looking like on the week?
00:09:24.500 - 00:09:30.706, Speaker B: Yeah, down 7% on the week. Started at $122, currently at $113.
00:09:30.888 - 00:09:44.342, Speaker A: Very good. There we go. Gas markets. It was a lower gas week most of the time, with some huge spikes, I think, like the Gary Vee spike. We'll talk about that when we get to the news. But what's the average gas, what's this looking like?
00:09:44.396 - 00:09:52.998, Speaker B: Yeah, average gas last week was 40 gwe. It has moved up to 44 gwe. So ethereum usage marginally increasing. Marginally increasing.
00:09:53.094 - 00:10:03.774, Speaker A: There you go. Well, let's talk about maybe why some of the prices are down. This is our Fed watch. The Fed officials this week announced a plan to shrink the balance sheet by 95 billion a month.
00:10:03.892 - 00:10:04.926, Speaker B: That's a big number.
00:10:05.028 - 00:10:05.822, Speaker A: That's a big number.
00:10:05.876 - 00:10:06.382, Speaker B: Right.
00:10:06.516 - 00:10:37.334, Speaker A: This is reverse quantitative easing. Quantitative tightening, I suppose. I don't know if these terms are still used very much, but 95 billion a month they are shedding, and this would shrink the Fed's balance sheet by 1 trillion per year. David. And the reason is, of course, this is on the back of concern about inflation. It's not so fleeting, apparently, as the Fed was talking about last summer. It seems to be a sustained issue that the Fed is now dealing with.
00:10:37.334 - 00:11:04.334, Speaker A: And so they're not only talking about, of course, shrinking the balance sheet, but also continuing to raise rates expeditiously was, I believe, a term that was used. And we saw some of the damage that came in the bond market as a result of this. So massive damage. This is like one of the biggest drops, I think, since the 1990s in the bond market. So the biggest drop we've seen like 25 plus years.
00:11:04.452 - 00:11:11.102, Speaker B: On what time frame, though, just for the listeners that aren't looking at the chart, are we talking about from the end of November to where we are currently time frame?
00:11:11.166 - 00:11:20.870, Speaker A: No, this is a different chart. This is a different chart. I was just saying that in general, this is the ishares 20 year treasury ETF chart, which is down 11% year to date.
00:11:20.940 - 00:11:23.106, Speaker B: So in general, it looks like a crypto chart.
00:11:23.138 - 00:12:06.898, Speaker A: Ryan, the takeaway is like people are getting out of bonds. What's interesting about this is stocks are still up, right? So you got bonds going down, stocks up. Like, people don't want to be in bonds. People want to be in. I guess traditionally they've been seen as risk on assets like stocks, like even crypto didn't take too big of a hit compared to bonds. And you sort of wonder if maybe the definition of risk is changing fundamentally, bonds are somewhat risky. You're looking at a federal government, who's printing trillions per year, all of every single nation state, is printing so much money these days, and their deficits are getting higher.
00:12:06.898 - 00:12:31.386, Speaker A: Their ability to pay them back without printing is becoming less and less likely. And so, are bonds really the safe asset? I don't know. Maybe the market is showing some signs of that cracking. Of course, I'm not a macro economist. I just see the Fed doing some more tightening. Interesting that crypto didn't take quite as big a hit as I thought it might. And perhaps all of this is saying something to us.
00:12:31.386 - 00:12:43.326, Speaker A: It's also saying that us mortgage rates are up. You're looking to get in a mortgage. The time was like, a few months ago, not so much now. Rates are up to, like, four and a half percent almost now.
00:12:43.508 - 00:13:19.798, Speaker B: And the take I have here, is that the joke? The tweet is saying, this is not oil. This is not a meme stock or even a shitcoin. It's Us mortgage rates, which is indicating the absolute gargantuan run in mortgage rates from just like, earlier this year, where it was at 3% down up to 4.4%, which is like a big move in mortgage rates, apparently. But also the speed and magnitude of the move is kind of what's caught a lot of people by surprise. And my take here is that the world is becoming more and more chaotic as crypto becomes less and less volatile. The world around it is becoming more and more volatile.
00:13:19.798 - 00:13:43.278, Speaker B: I remember in 2017, 2018, one of the conversations about why crypto will never work was like, oh, it's too volatile. It's too volatile. Well, the rest of the world has gotten a lot more volatile since then. And also since then, crypto volatility has dampened. So not really how I expected that to play out at the time, but the world becoming more chaotic makes crypto a lot easier, a lot more appetizing than previously.
00:13:43.374 - 00:13:48.230, Speaker A: Can I just say this? I feel like crypto has made me volatility proof, totally.
00:13:49.290 - 00:13:52.694, Speaker B: If you've been in crypto, you are prepped. You are prepped for the next.
00:13:52.732 - 00:14:04.282, Speaker A: You are totally prepped emotionally. You've been through volatility wars. You are the veteran. And so when you go back to the regular markets, you see something like this. You're like, oh, is that it?
00:14:04.336 - 00:14:07.020, Speaker B: People are talking about this? Why are they talking about this?
00:14:07.790 - 00:14:15.550, Speaker A: It's always funny to see equities and people are like, a 4% shock to the market. Stocks are s and p is 4% down. I'm like, what?
00:14:15.620 - 00:14:17.520, Speaker B: I don't wake up over 4%.
00:14:17.970 - 00:14:51.010, Speaker A: 4% in either direction. How boring. Thank you. Speaking of volatility, I guess volatility of 3 hours capital in their, in their alignment, they're rotating back into ETH. We talked about not last week but the week before, where people are of course tracking their ethereum addresses and seeing that 3 hours capital, they just bought another 31,000 e. That's another $100 million. Not a lot, probably for 3 hours capital, but interesting.
00:14:51.010 - 00:15:06.014, Speaker A: And I feel like this is part of the great merge rotation that we're about to see. Even trading firms are like, okay, we know that merge narrative. We want to be here. So that's what I think is happening here with 3 hours capital. Yeah.
00:15:06.052 - 00:15:20.130, Speaker B: So I think the next steps for 3 hours capital is after they are done rotating into eth, you'll start to. They've already added the eth tag back into their bios. I think this is Suzu. And at some point they're going to start talking about the merge on Twitter. Like this is what everyone's expecting.
00:15:20.470 - 00:15:21.022, Speaker A: Totally.
00:15:21.086 - 00:15:21.730, Speaker B: This is the game.
00:15:21.800 - 00:15:36.534, Speaker A: And a bankless episode, maybe. I don't know whether we'll do that. We'll have to see when the time comes. Guys, we're going to get to the releases and of course the news of the week. But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:15:36.732 - 00:16:02.654, Speaker B: Makerdao is the OG DeFi protocol. The Makerdao produces Dai, the industry's most battle tested and resilient stablecoin.

00:18:03.260 - 00:18:06.786, Speaker A: Hey guys, we are back with the hot releases of the week. The first is it's nitro.
00:18:06.818 - 00:18:07.880, Speaker B: Nitro time.
00:18:08.590 - 00:18:38.750, Speaker A: That sounds awesome. Okay, here's what it means, though. Arbitrum, very popular layer two optimistic roll up layer two. They have just released the testnet version of Nitro. Okay, this is going to be a seamless upgrade, I believe, so there's nothing that folks have to do. And of course, this is still testnet, so it needs to go through the process and eventually get to their main net. A few things that this includes are one, a custom built EVM emulator.
00:18:38.750 - 00:19:12.106, Speaker A: That's what they had previously. They're now replacing that with geth. So getting a bit more standardized, I think, is part of what they're doing here. Of course, there's also the minimization of layer two costs, so gas fees on arbitram going down. Once this is implemented through batching and compressing, there's so much room for optimization. We've been talking about this for a while on bankless with optimistic roll ups and ZK roll ups. Once you have the first version of these things where transactions are maybe still like ten cents, twenty cents, twenty five cents a dollar.
00:19:12.106 - 00:19:31.742, Speaker A: That's just the first version. Now all of these layer twos are going through the process of just massive compression, and that's kind of the first pass of improvements into these ecosystems. And that's happening with nitro now the same is happening with optimism as well. So it's really cool to see these upgrades.
00:19:31.886 - 00:20:07.760, Speaker B: Yeah. A couple of paragraphs out of their article. Today, we throttle Arbitrum's capacity, but with nitro, we'll be able to release these controls and significantly up our throughput. And while arbitrum today is already 90% to 95% cheaper than ethereum, on average, nitro cuts costs even further. When we eventually migrate arbitrum one over to nitro, it'll be a seamless migration from the current stack to the nitro stack, so users will have an uninterrupted experience. The only thing they'll notice are reduced fees, increase capacity, and overall faster experience. So this is, they have the testnet, and then they have the current arbitram one, and they're doing the Indiana Jones hotswap thing.
00:20:07.760 - 00:20:14.446, Speaker B: If I was on the arbitrum marketing team, I'd start calling this the merge if I were them, just because this is perfect.
00:20:14.548 - 00:20:16.282, Speaker A: Can you guys hear that, arbitram team?
00:20:16.356 - 00:20:43.766, Speaker B: Yeah, there you go. Some free advice, some marketing advice for you guys. The arbitrum merge is coming. I think that I might be getting outside of my technical capacity here, but replacing the EVM emulator with Geth, I think, is following an optimism's footsteps of optimizing for EVM equivalents, which is a concept that I'm super, super bullish on. This is how you scale ethereum out beyond the l one and have EVM equivalents across all the l two s. It makes things very, very replicatable. Replicatable is antifragile.
00:20:43.766 - 00:20:56.670, Speaker B: This is how crypto works. Really excited to get this arbitrum nitro out the door. And, Ryan, I'm going to go ahead and guess that this is the last major thing that arbitrum does before they launch a token. This is my guess.
00:20:56.820 - 00:21:11.598, Speaker A: Oh, interesting. Well, I don't know if the team can either confirm or deny that, but we have predicted that 2022 would be l two year, and by that, we also meant tokens. Tokens. We definitely did. Gimme, gimme, gimme. Give me all the stuff. Arbitrum.
00:21:11.598 - 00:21:29.554, Speaker A: We want tokens, we want low gas fees. We want all of it. And it seems like they're delivering that. So super cool to see instadap. Really cool app. They just released a light version of their application. What's cool about this, I think, is the ability to get one click defi yields.
00:21:29.554 - 00:21:37.194, Speaker A: I almost worry that it's too easy. Like, look, I click that button, I start earning 10% on my eth. How do they do that?
00:21:37.392 - 00:21:38.410, Speaker B: How do they do that?
00:21:38.480 - 00:21:55.906, Speaker A: I don't know how it works, but because I haven't looked at it, I'm sure it's throwing it into all strategies. There might be some leverage. You don't know the risk. Anyway, cool stuff from instadap. Let's talk about layer zero. Not your layer zero. God, not that layer zero.
00:21:55.906 - 00:22:56.110, Speaker A: This is a bridge application, a bridge platform that we're talking about last week in the context of receiving some funding. The interesting thing this week is a NFT project that has rolled out something that the industry and people are calling omnichain nfts. In fact, William Pester did a fantastic overview of what omnichain nfts are, what they are, why they matter, but it's basically the idea of deploying an NFT, not just on one chain. You don't have to pick a solana or a polygon or an avax or an ethereum, but deploying a little bit on each chain. And the application itself, I believe, sits inside of layer zero, right? So it's almost like a layer zero type of application. And the idea of an omnichain is you don't have to mint on one specific chain and live there. You can kind of live pieces of the nfts live on all of these various chains.
00:22:56.110 - 00:23:02.758, Speaker A: It's a cool concept and something. I think we'll see some pickup this year, and so does William Peester. What are your thoughts here?
00:23:02.844 - 00:23:30.990, Speaker B: Yeah, having nfts that change their expression based on properties is always interesting. Having one of those properties be which blockchain is it on? Is pretty cool as well. It's one of those things where I can't really immediately think of a use case for it, but I also probably couldn't have thought of a use case for the Internet back in the 1980s. And so same kind of thing where it's just like opening up the design space to something completely brand new. Again, thank you for naming your project after my podcast.
00:23:31.730 - 00:24:02.460, Speaker A: Ghostly Ghosts is the NFT project. By the way, this hearkens to a podcast episode we just did with Olaf Carlson. We that's coming out on Monday for bankless listeners, where he made the case that bridges might also be an application platform in the future as well. I wonder if we're seeing hints of that with Omnichan nfts and layer zeros. We'll be following that closely, of course. I see ETH is a new interest compounding ETH index from index co op. Okay, this is a way to boost up your ETh yield as well.
00:24:02.460 - 00:24:52.940, Speaker A: Super cool. I could tell you a little bit about where the yield is coming from, but I don't know all of the details. Here's a dune analytics chart describing the process, but basically it deposits Lido's liquid staked ETH token as collateral in AavE, and then recursively borrows the ETH through Aave and then swaps more of that ETH for staked ETH. So it's kind of a margin play on your ETH to boost your yield on ETH using staking plus some aave margin. You could do this yourself, but it would be a lot of work. And this asset that you can buy from index co op essentially automates that entire process. What are we looking at as far as yield? Look at this 10%.
00:24:52.940 - 00:24:55.046, Speaker A: Hey, that's where the insta dap yield.
00:24:55.078 - 00:25:39.766, Speaker B: Came from, I guess so. That would just make way too much sense. And in theory, this should be risk free if we remove away smart contract risk and other DFI exploit type risk, which is always a risk. In theory, this is risk free, right? Because if the value of your ETh goes down, the value of what you also owe is also going down. So you're immune from us dollar fluctuations because you're putting your staked ETH as collateral to borrow eth. And so these things move in tandem with each other, except one moves slightly higher than the other one over time. So in theory, this is a risk free move to leverage up on yield, if you are okay with taking smart contract risk and any other defi exploit risk that might come with this.
00:25:39.868 - 00:26:12.194, Speaker A: Yeah. I asked an analyst who's very familiar with this product what he thought about it. He said, good product, but non zero blow up risk. But it's still probably safer than leveraging on Aave yourself, and it's really accessible to retail. Of course, the risks are the smart contract risk, as you said, and then any mechanical issues with the automated leverage and rebalancing sort of functionality that's going on. So there's definitely some risk here. But wow, 10% yield on ETH is pretty appealing with a single asset that does that.
00:26:12.194 - 00:26:18.146, Speaker A: So index co op, bring in some cool products to market. David, what's this? Tracer having a competition.
00:26:18.258 - 00:26:39.162, Speaker B: Yeah. Tracer Dow having a trading competition. $25,000 in prizes and nfts. It starts Wednesday, April 7. That was two days ago, and it ends the 16th. And this is on the arbitram wrinkle b test net. This is ahead of Tracer Dow's coming v two when they decide to go live on the main net with their v two perpetual pools, which I'm really excited about.
00:26:39.162 - 00:27:00.446, Speaker B: I'm already using Tracer V one, but the properties coming in Tracer V two are definitely much needed. And as soon as those come about, we will be talking about that on bankless and around. So if you want to come and be part of the tracer trading competition and perhaps get up to $25,000, there's a link in the show notes for you to go participate.
00:27:00.558 - 00:27:25.942, Speaker A: Perpetuals products, they're the future. Super cool here to have them in DFI. All right, let's talk raises. So the first is not quite a raise, I suppose, but is a lot of capital. So it sort of counts. The Luna foundation, that is, LFG, they just bought $231,000,000 worth of bitcoin. They, of course, have plans to purchase $10 billion worth of bitcoin.
00:27:25.942 - 00:27:33.020, Speaker A: They've stated to backstop UsT. I think they're at like over 1 billion now. Like 1.3, something like this.
00:27:35.070 - 00:27:35.814, Speaker B: 1.6.
00:27:35.872 - 00:27:57.414, Speaker A: Okay, 1.6. That in and of itself is a story. And by the way, if you'd like to hear kind of a debate about the merits of UST and maybe some of the risks associated with UST, tune into our podcast from earlier this week down the bull and bear case for that. That's one piece of the news, but the other piece of the news is this. David, do you read this?
00:27:57.532 - 00:28:35.466, Speaker B: Yeah, this is an interesting choice. Buying bitcoin to backstop your stablecoin makes sense. But in addition to that, the terra LFG fund has bought $100 million of the Avax token. And so that is a different choice than buying bitcoin. And again, the idea is that we have these reserve currencies that help backstop the peg. And so it's like ammo in the bank to use. If, in case there's ever a lull in UsT demand and UST removes its peg, you use the bitcoin and the rest of your reserves to buy up the stablecoin.
00:28:35.466 - 00:28:53.830, Speaker B: To make sure the peg is maintained. Bitcoin. I don't think anyone really would question the choice to use bitcoin as an asset to backstop this. The $100 million into the Avax token. Questionable. Questionable. There is a big difference between an $830,000,000,000 market cap in bitcoin versus the Avax market cap of $223,000,000,000.
00:28:53.830 - 00:29:53.110, Speaker B: And so if you are going to backstop something, you need something that has strong insurances and extremely high liquidity and is going to be available for you in the time of need. In a time of need, Avax token, which has a lower history of price than bitcoin does, is not the same level of assurances that bitcoin has. And they've skipped from going from the number one crypto asset, which is bitcoin, with an $830,000,000 market cap, skipped over ether, skipped over BNB, skipped over Salana, justifiably skipping over XRP and Cardano, down to avalanche down to the number ten crypto asset. So this, in my mind, is not actually something that's in the best interest of the protocol. This is a political choice. This is like an alignment with the Avax community because they're putting Avax on the terra balance sheet.
00:29:53.190 - 00:30:29.910, Speaker A: Okay, so it kind of depends here from my take is this. I don't think that Terra is actually prioritizing risk mitigation with the move like this. And in fact, that was kind of what we learned from our podcast earlier this week with the bull Jose, who explained much more about the terra ecosystem. Ust that the end game for UST in Terra is actually like utility, it's actually usage. And so the prioritization is not necessarily on risk mitigation. With the move like this, the prioritization is on composable communities. Right? Uplift, basically.
00:30:29.910 - 00:30:53.326, Speaker A: So if I get the bitcoiners on my side at Terra, what happens? Bitcoin price goes up a little bit. Terra price goes up. Bitcoiners are more friendly to my community, more likely to use UST. Oh, yeah, we like UsT and Luna. It's kind of a bitcoin friendly, and a portion of it's backed by bitcoin. How great is that? Rinse, wash and repeat. Do the same thing with the Avax community.
00:30:53.326 - 00:30:54.490, Speaker A: Now we've got a tie.
00:30:54.570 - 00:30:55.082, Speaker B: Political.
00:30:55.146 - 00:31:39.142, Speaker A: Yeah, it is political, but it's a move for not to backstop from a risk perspective. It's more to pump the usage of this thing, maybe even pump the value of this thing, right? So avax now, the avalanche community is like, okay, I'm excited about this. Number go up for Luna. Token number go up for Avax. Because Avax is only the second coin that LFG has purchased, and everybody wins. Everyone's happy. Now, whether you think that is a short term game destined to fail, or whether you think that is a long term, bootstrapping phase sustainable thing that's going to bootstrap UST and Luna into the stratosphere, the strategy does make some sense from that perspective.
00:31:39.142 - 00:32:00.510, Speaker A: But I would also say I still make this claim. I'm not sure what the difference is between UST that is buying and custodying bitcoin and Avax for its reserves to backstop a currency and an actual, like, I don't see a lot of distinction here. It's a bank, Jim.
00:32:00.670 - 00:32:02.402, Speaker B: This is what a federal bank does.
00:32:02.536 - 00:32:29.930, Speaker A: Looking a little bit like that. And that's some probably unresolved piece of the discussion. I think Jose made a lot of fantastic points in our discussion with him, but I was still not understanding how this is much different than a bank's balance sheet that is trying to prop up the value of its asset. So I've still got some more, I guess, due diligence or things to think through on that side.
00:32:30.080 - 00:32:45.598, Speaker B: I will throw a flag in saying that putting Avax on the balance sheet doesn't make UsT the token, have more utility. Like UST has the same amount of utility based on what's on top of the terra blockchain. Putting Avax in the LFG fund doesn't add to the utility of that token.
00:32:45.694 - 00:33:06.226, Speaker A: So here's what it could do, though. It's like the Avax community now wants to adopt it more. So Avax now prefers me. They prefer UsT to die. Why? Because UST is now backed by Avax, and so you're creating a composable community linkage there. And so that could increase the utility of UST.
00:33:06.418 - 00:33:15.526, Speaker B: So why would they skip over Ethereum, which has a much larger defi ecosystem, and go straight for avalanche, which has a smaller, more nascent defi ecosystem?
00:33:15.558 - 00:33:22.458, Speaker A: Well, I think that is what you said earlier, which is the enemy of my enemy is my friend. I actually didn't say that earlier in.
00:33:22.464 - 00:33:30.862, Speaker B: The podcast that was in the Vitalik debrief. Okay, guys, we just recorded an episode with Vitalik this morning. That debrief will come out in two weeks, I think.
00:33:30.916 - 00:33:36.642, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's what's going on, don't you? Do you have another explanation yeah, no.
00:33:36.696 - 00:33:47.090, Speaker B: I think, again, it's a political alignment, as in, like, yeah, let's band together all the subdominant l ones so that together we can beat Ethereum. I think that's kind of what's going on here.
00:33:47.160 - 00:33:58.662, Speaker A: It's interesting, it's crafty, it's clever in a lot of ways. You got to hand it to him from that perspective. Does it actually increase the or decrease the risk of usT? Not sure about that one.
00:33:58.716 - 00:34:20.426, Speaker B: Yeah, because Luna and avid and the Avax token have to have such a high correlation with each other in the time of need. You need non correlated assets. Bitcoin is still pretty correlated, but also it's bitcoin, it's much more stable. It would have made much more sense to have gold. If we're going to do this whole centralized custody thing, like effort, let's do gold.
00:34:20.618 - 00:34:27.374, Speaker A: I don't know, put some dye in it. I mean, really, because it's backed by.
00:34:27.412 - 00:34:33.282, Speaker B: Real estate and Tesla, which is actually where we're going next in this story. Let's talk about. Actually, we have a few more things.
00:34:33.336 - 00:34:51.034, Speaker A: No, yeah, a few more things first. So wormhole, which is the bridge, you remember, had a big, massive hack, biggest hack bridge hack in history until last week. Well, they've recovered from that crypto bridge. Wormhole is seeking $2.5 billion valuation price tag in private token sales. I don't know. My mind's exploding at the valuation of these things now.
00:34:51.034 - 00:35:00.640, Speaker A: Bridges are just valued as highly as layer twos. I don't quite understand it yet. Am I missing something? Are we collectively missing something?
00:35:01.010 - 00:35:53.590, Speaker B: This is the debate as to whether or not we live in a bridge ecosystem. There's the debate as a layer two cryptographic bridge, or cross layer one interoperability bridges, which I'm pretty sure, unless I miss something, the interoperability between l one blockchains is not a solved problem. Maybe that's what they're trying to solve, but I'm pretty sure in theory, it is an unsolvable problem. And so all layer one bridges are going to have to be centralized multisigs, and I don't think it can get any better than that. At the fundamental level. This is to what I understand about cryptography, which is more decent than most other areas of my technical knowledge, you cannot have a secure cross layer one ecosystem. And so these valuations on these cross layer one bridges, it doesn't make any sense to me, most of the bridges.
00:35:53.670 - 00:36:06.766, Speaker A: And by the way, I think I am bullish on bridges, and I think as are you bullish on bridges as a category? Like hugely bullish on them. But most of the bridges that we've seen are like more layer two to layer two, which makes a lot more sense.
00:36:06.788 - 00:36:08.270, Speaker B: Cryptographic bridges. Yes.
00:36:08.340 - 00:36:32.210, Speaker A: Right. This is a multilayer one bridge. But if you want the contrary opinion to that, listen to our episode with Olaf Carlson. We, because he is very bullish on bridges. And I think polychain was probably involved in I don't know if in this sale, but layer zero for sure. Anyway, wormhole is back, baby. Twitch co founder, NFT startup just netted 35 million in seed funding.
00:36:32.210 - 00:36:50.766, Speaker A: So Twitch co founder is starting an NFT startup and in seed funding he's getting $35 million for that. That's seed funding, David. That's not series a. That's not series b. That's like, I got a PowerPoint with some ideas. It's that level of seed funding. I don't know, maybe it's just me.
00:36:50.766 - 00:36:53.962, Speaker A: This week, valuations seem a little more ridiculous than usual.
00:36:54.026 - 00:37:01.218, Speaker B: What do you think we could get for like 10% of bankless? No idea. How much seed funding do you think we could get?
00:37:01.384 - 00:37:13.206, Speaker A: I think you could create a narrative. Bankless is a media interoperability bridge. Cross blockchain for those.
00:37:13.228 - 00:37:14.630, Speaker B: No one would multiverse.
00:37:15.210 - 00:37:16.440, Speaker A: Not doing it.
00:37:17.130 - 00:37:18.306, Speaker B: We didn't take this more seriously.
00:37:18.338 - 00:37:34.814, Speaker A: This is my bad course one. They are a staking ecosystem leader. They've been doing this since 2018. They're getting into the venture game. So investing $30 million into promising protocols. So staking company turns vc. Interesting.
00:37:34.932 - 00:37:38.078, Speaker B: Yeah, there's a discussion to be had there. I think we'll skip that one.
00:37:38.164 - 00:37:53.410, Speaker A: How about this? Boba network valuation just hit $1.5 billion after a $45 million series A round. Who's in this series A? Companies like Crypto.com, Huobi, Bitmart, Will Smith.
00:37:54.070 - 00:37:54.734, Speaker B: Seriously?
00:37:54.782 - 00:37:57.486, Speaker A: Will Smith and Paris Hilton? Yeah, Will Smith.
00:37:57.678 - 00:38:00.278, Speaker B: We're trying to get Paris Hilton on the podcast, by the way. That might happen.
00:38:00.364 - 00:38:03.874, Speaker A: How about Will Smith? He's been in the news lately.
00:38:03.922 - 00:38:09.826, Speaker B: Paris Hilton first. She's smart and she's crafty and she's got some awesome NFT opinions.
00:38:09.938 - 00:38:13.466, Speaker A: Yeah, I'd be interested in hearing Will Smith's opinions about some things, too.
00:38:13.488 - 00:38:30.094, Speaker B: You know what's interesting about this one, Ryan? $1.5 billion valuation on Boba network. Boba network is a fork off of optimism, which also raised at $1.5 million not too long ago. So like l two forks raising at the same valuations as the l two s themselves.
00:38:30.292 - 00:38:33.694, Speaker A: Can we call a narrative here. Like, this narrative couldn't be more clear to me.
00:38:33.732 - 00:38:35.918, Speaker B: What do you mean? The l two two narrative?
00:38:36.094 - 00:39:22.880, Speaker A: No, we've already called that. I'm talking about, like an alt l two narrative that's coming. So I think a lot of the rotators of the world, I'm not calling anyone out. 3 hours capital. I'm not calling anyone out. A lot of the rotators of the world will be very excited to capitalize on this narrative because we've seen on the off brand, not obvious off brand layer twos that are community backed and non vc and more pure, like, that's going to be a whole thing. And non ethereum cabal fork, an optimism fork, an arbitrum fork, some zksync technology, and create an off brand layer two that now has capital from jump capital, Alameda, 3 hours.
00:39:22.880 - 00:39:30.222, Speaker A: And then pump that thing, pump that token until the narrative is done, and then you rotate back into bitcoin and eth.
00:39:30.286 - 00:39:35.140, Speaker B: All right, I think I'll add that to the bankless pitch deck. We'll make an off brand layer two.
00:39:36.570 - 00:39:51.334, Speaker A: Good idea. All right. Lightning network. It's still there. It's still doing stuff. $30 million or, sorry, Lightning Labs just raised $70 million to bring stablecoins to bitcoin. That's the thing that they were trying to do over at Lightning Labs.
00:39:51.334 - 00:39:52.490, Speaker A: Any thoughts on this?
00:39:52.560 - 00:40:15.994, Speaker B: I didn't know that that was possible. Elizabeth Stark, who is the woman that you see on the screen, has been just relentlessly working on Lightning network. Big open source developer, big believer. Has been the CEO of Lightning Labs for Forever. Lightning Labs has been around for forever. So definitely deserves to raise a bunch of money. I do not know how stablecoins become a part of Lightning Network.
00:40:15.994 - 00:40:17.806, Speaker B: That is new information to me.
00:40:17.908 - 00:40:29.714, Speaker A: They're trying. They're trying. Maybe we will investigate that a little bit more as that matures. Actually, we see some stable coins. That's the first step. You got to see it, right? Press release is easy. Crypto data, firm coin metrics.
00:40:29.714 - 00:40:30.710, Speaker A: I love this data.
00:40:30.860 - 00:40:33.490, Speaker B: We love coin metrics. We love coin metrics.
00:40:33.570 - 00:40:36.550, Speaker A: They just raised $35 million in a funding round.
00:40:37.130 - 00:40:55.150, Speaker B: I was trying to find the valuation. They didn't mention the valuation. Yeah, so that part is hidden. But coin metrics has been around for a long time. Very useful website to get very accurate and true data about stuff. I use it all the time. If you have not yet tinkered with coin metrics, you should definitely try it out.
00:40:55.220 - 00:41:16.158, Speaker A: It's Nick Carter, startup Carter? Yeah, he was involved in this finance us. They just raised $200 million in a seed round as well. That's a $4.5 billion valuation. Not to be confused with other finance, which is like global finance, I guess. This is binance us with its own $4.5 billion valuation.
00:41:16.158 - 00:41:18.806, Speaker A: It's going the IPO route, David, at.
00:41:18.828 - 00:41:27.206, Speaker B: A technical level, there's actually no formal link between Binance us and Binance, except for that actual binance licenses out their branding to Binance us.
00:41:27.308 - 00:41:28.374, Speaker A: No way. I didn't know this.
00:41:28.412 - 00:41:31.122, Speaker B: I think there is actually no legal link between these entities.
00:41:31.266 - 00:41:31.878, Speaker A: Oh, wow.
00:41:31.964 - 00:41:32.214, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:41:32.252 - 00:41:32.514, Speaker A: Okay.
00:41:32.572 - 00:41:38.390, Speaker B: Other than like, I'm pretty sure CZ owns like a significant share of finance us, which is like a link through the man himself.
00:41:38.550 - 00:41:55.838, Speaker A: I've never used it. Never used binance us. Okay, let's talk about near. So this is, I think, the last one in our raises. A lot of raises this week. They just raised $500 million after their latest funding round. I don't know what the valuation of this is in the billions for sure.
00:41:55.838 - 00:41:58.658, Speaker A: Certainly big war chest. 500 million.
00:41:58.824 - 00:42:02.414, Speaker B: It's a live token, right? So you can just see the valuation based on the token.
00:42:02.462 - 00:42:10.710, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm sure VC's got a little discount on that and that's kind of how it works. This reminded me of the $15 billion total.
00:42:10.780 - 00:42:14.946, Speaker B: Tbl or not tbL, fully diluted valuation, 15 billion.
00:42:15.138 - 00:42:44.830, Speaker A: Remember this chart? We were talking about this with Vitalik earlier from his post. This is a chart. If you're on YouTube, you can see those major public chains launch date versus insider allocation. And it's funny, like the chart is basically showing the early chains had the lowest amount of insider allocation. Of course, bitcoin had zero. Unless you include the early insiders who are mining the thing, of course, which you might include that, but ethereum, very low insider allocation.
00:42:45.170 - 00:42:47.218, Speaker B: Just talking about the $10 million presale, right?
00:42:47.304 - 00:43:15.562, Speaker A: Yes. And then even Cardano and Tezos and eos, like fairly low insider valuation. There were other flaws with Eos, for example, but low compared to today we look at near. It's like over 60% insider valuation. And here's even more. Right, another private round with a larger valuation of insiders. I guess now the token is public, so you can kind of buy that and trade that.
00:43:15.562 - 00:43:28.750, Speaker A: But it's just interesting over time that this is consolidated to a lot of early VC raises before the tokens have launched. And that's also true of layer twos. We can't say that's not true of layer twos. Certainly a product of the SEC.
00:43:28.900 - 00:43:54.680, Speaker B: Small clarification on this one. Near protocol didn't raise 500 million. They have $500 million in cash after they raised 350,000,000 on April 6. So they raised 350. They have 500 million in cash led by Tiger Global, FTX Ventures, blockchain Ventures, Dragonfly Capital, and then previous rounds by 3 hours capital, Alameda a 16 z. What are they going to do with $500 million?
00:43:58.490 - 00:44:00.806, Speaker A: They're going to hire. Don't talk about jobs.
00:44:00.838 - 00:44:05.862, Speaker B: $500 million. I don't see near hiring on this job, sport, Brian.
00:44:06.006 - 00:44:22.334, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, look, they're definitely going to hire people. What else they do with it? It's got to go to marketing. I'm sure there's also future development. I'm not sure. I'm not sure what an l one does with all of this money. I think we will see, though, in the months and years to come, they're not going to go broke. That's for sure.
00:44:22.372 - 00:44:25.354, Speaker B: Not a $500 million bear market immune.
00:44:25.482 - 00:44:44.550, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, on the topic of jobs and hiring, which is maybe where near is going to spend some of its money. Get a job in crypto. This is our weekly reminder to you that there are jobs awaiting you in the crypto ecosystem in web3. And you can have them. You could see them. You could see more at bankless palette.com
00:44:44.550 - 00:44:48.750, Speaker A: jobs. I'm going to read out a few. Is that okay? You're sitting down. I don't know if you can dance.
00:44:48.770 - 00:44:50.154, Speaker B: Like that, but I've done it once before.
00:44:50.272 - 00:45:09.914, Speaker A: All right. Solidity architect, number one aloo marketing manager, Mesha UX designer, Prometheus Research Labs. That just sounds awesome. A community manager, the DGen Dogs club. Where else can you get a job at the Degen Dogs club? A co founder for innovative omnichain. Defi primitive. We're just talking about the omnichain.
00:45:09.914 - 00:45:27.182, Speaker A: That's a TBD thing. It's in Paris. Blockchain engineers at Masari. Software engineers. Market data Masari operations manager, Syndica senior product designer, smart Defi senior go Rust engineer, Syndica senior full stack engineer, Syndica senior software engineer, airdrop Labs. Product manager, crypto Nori Bankless. Web developer at bankless.
00:45:27.182 - 00:45:32.358, Speaker A: And a bankless editor at bankless. Still looking for those positions. We got some cool candidates. We want to see some more, too.
00:45:32.444 - 00:45:36.680, Speaker B: For those who are going to Amsterdam, this is how I'm going to be dancing at the rave that's happening.
00:45:37.210 - 00:45:38.594, Speaker A: There's a rave in Amsterdam?
00:45:38.642 - 00:45:40.246, Speaker B: There's a rave happening at Amsterdam? Yeah.
00:45:40.268 - 00:45:42.922, Speaker A: What's the story? They can't have these on us territory, right?
00:45:42.976 - 00:45:44.762, Speaker B: No, I think they just chosen not to.
00:45:44.896 - 00:45:52.842, Speaker A: Okay. I understand that Europeans get all the good things, plus their parties are better. Do you want to move to news?
00:45:52.976 - 00:45:54.398, Speaker B: Sure. Yeah, let's do it.
00:45:54.484 - 00:46:04.526, Speaker A: Ethereum news. Remember the axe bailout, David? We were contemplating. We thought maybe it would happen. There's the biggest bridge hack in history, 625,000,000 something. Who bailed them out?
00:46:04.628 - 00:46:20.146, Speaker B: Finance. Finance. But finance just didn't give Axe $150,000,000. It was a $150,000,000 funding round. So we're actually still talking about raises. Finance gave Axe the details on it. What Axe gave them are undisclosed.
00:46:20.146 - 00:46:44.142, Speaker B: There's probably some, like, Ron tokens, some AXS tokens, maybe a bunch of strange love potions. I don't know. But they got $150,000,000 raised from Finance, which is going to help plug the hole for the users that lost the money. It's not a complete bailout because they lost 620,000,000. And I haven't heard any news about the fallout for where that money has gone. I think nothing's happened with it.
00:46:44.276 - 00:46:48.000, Speaker A: You mean like the people who were missing the money?
00:46:49.010 - 00:46:51.326, Speaker B: Yeah. Where is that money gone? I don't know.
00:46:51.428 - 00:46:52.814, Speaker A: I didn't hear anything about it.
00:46:52.932 - 00:47:03.890, Speaker B: Haven't heard a thing. But anyways, they are making amends, their community, by raising this money. So anyone that lost money with Axio Infinity now has this $150,000,000 to tap into to get some of their money back.
00:47:03.960 - 00:47:31.486, Speaker A: That's cool. Thought this would happen. And certainly the big capital pools are using it as opportunity to get some equity, some more share in these crypto networks. This is interesting. Backed just inked a deal to offer bitcoin and ether buys and sells to american bank customers. So American bank is a community bank headquartered in Pennsylvania. What's interesting to me is now the banks are licensing crypto companies to sell their customers.
00:47:31.486 - 00:47:45.858, Speaker A: Crypto. Right. How far we've come, when banks going from like, oh, this is a scam, like, cryptos now they are actively trying to find ways to sell crypto to their customer. When Wells Fargo. When are you guys doing this?
00:47:45.944 - 00:48:05.346, Speaker B: Right. If they had thought more openly about Crypto in 2017, 2018, and actually started to build in the bear market like the rest of us, they wouldn't have to actually go through other people's services in order to now provide crypto. They could have just done it themselves. But no, they were close minded, david.
00:48:05.378 - 00:48:06.566, Speaker A: Not even one bank did that.
00:48:06.588 - 00:48:07.778, Speaker B: Not even one bank.
00:48:07.954 - 00:48:21.866, Speaker A: Not even one. It's all crypto native companies that are dominating the new crypto banking industry, not even any of the old legacy ones. And I'm surprised, to be honest. We haven't seen an acquisition of a legacy bank acquire a crypto native company.
00:48:21.968 - 00:48:27.294, Speaker B: Yeah, probably because crypto native companies are like, no, f you guys, we have all the goods. We're going to buy you guys in two.
00:48:27.332 - 00:48:28.238, Speaker A: Yeah, we don't need you.
00:48:28.324 - 00:48:29.198, Speaker B: We don't need you.
00:48:29.284 - 00:48:35.700, Speaker A: Well, I mean, SBF came out and said that he was like, yeah, we're going to buy Goldman one day. I don't know if that was.
00:48:38.150 - 00:48:43.460, Speaker B: SBF could buy Goldman. He would buy Goldman. I think he would do that.
00:48:44.390 - 00:48:46.878, Speaker A: All rigHt, this is what you were talking about eaRlier. What's this? TESLA.
00:48:46.894 - 00:49:37.962, Speaker B: And, yeah, okay, so MAKERDAo is pioneering into the world of real world assets. And so they have these legal structures that are formed that allow them, allows the protocol to mint Dai based off of collateral from real world assets. So Tesla is getting a $7.8 million loan from maker Dow to finance Tesla repairs facilities around the world. And this is just the first of what could be MaNY, many deals coming out of tesla like this. I think that the next iteration on these are $12 million deals and, like, a series of them. So this is Tesla getting their feet in their toes in the water with getting loans from Makerdao just because it's an advantageous place to get a loan from when it comes to Tesla's balance sheet, which that's a delicate subject.
00:49:37.962 - 00:50:07.950, Speaker B: Tesla's balance sheet is a delicate subject for Tesla. And getting a loan out of makerdao is really a great opportunity for them. And so this is actually not Makerdao's first foray into real world assets. This is them using this legal structure that they've created to allow and scale out the onboarding of real world assets. And the cool thing about this, people might be thinking, like, all right, isn't this centralized? Right? Like, this is going to be some sort of trusted, centralized entity managing this loan. And you're right. You're totally right.
00:50:07.950 - 00:50:43.210, Speaker B: The thing is, if there's a thousand of these things, there's a thousand different instances of centralized trusts managing real world assets that is itself decentralized. There isn't one trust. There wasn't one organization that's managing the real world assets for Makerdao. Each individual deal is its own centralized deal. And when you add on, like, a thousand of these things, well, then you have a thousand centralized deals. Kind of makes it decentralized. And so Makerdao is pioneering into aspects of just crypto economics and adoption that no one else is doing.
00:50:43.210 - 00:50:47.430, Speaker B: And so that's always why I get really excited about what they're up to at Makerdao.
00:50:47.510 - 00:50:57.070, Speaker A: I feel like there's way more meme potential in this than we actually saw. Like, Elon just took out a loan from a Defi protocol. It's like the meme headline, and I didn't see that anywhere. People aren't talking about this.
00:50:57.140 - 00:51:20.470, Speaker B: That's because Maker Dao takes themselves seriously and they don't play in the narrative meme wars, and that's why everyone thinks they're a boomer, but they're just heads down, grinding all the time. I tweeted this out, like last week, where of all the dows that are out there, Makerdao has an order of magnitude more number of labor hours being contributed to it that are also effective labor hours than any other dow. And it's just because they're heads down building, bruh.
00:51:21.370 - 00:51:27.698, Speaker A: Interesting. There you go. Well, you are the maker bull among us. All right, four pool.
00:51:27.794 - 00:51:30.140, Speaker B: By that sound, I think that makes one of us.
00:51:30.830 - 00:52:05.250, Speaker A: Look, man, I read the bankless Alpha report and it's neutral on Maker, so I'm neutral right now on MKR. All right, stablecoin wars. This actually leads to the stablecoin wars, though, because Dai is, of course, a dominant decentralized stablecoin on Ethereum right now. But UST and Luna is really looking to change that. They're looking to take over. They're looking to come into defi and take away market share explicitly from Dai. And how do they do that? The curve wars, that's what the four pool is.
00:52:05.250 - 00:52:12.290, Speaker A: Can you explain some of the background on what's going on, what the four pool actually is, and how it's significant to the stablecoin wars?
00:52:12.370 - 00:52:58.354, Speaker B: So the current status quo with curve is the three pool, which is a combo of DAI, USDC, and USDT. The curve wars has themed that it's appropriate to incentivize this pool. So there's a lot of liquidity between these things. So Doe Kwan has proposed the four pool, which is adding ust removing dai and then also adding fracs. And so instead of the three pool of Dai, USDC and tether, we now have terra USD, which is non native to Ethereum, although it is a decentralized stablecoin, adding fracs as well, and then also the USDC and tether stablecoins. And so this is Doe Kwan, first off, getting UsT into curve. So that is getting UsT into the stablecoin liquidity ecosystem.
00:52:58.354 - 00:53:33.402, Speaker B: Curve is basically where stablecoins get liquidity. So it's really, really mission critical for stablecoins. And not only is he submitting a proposal to inject UST into curve, at the same time he is proposing a pool without Dai. So if the curve wars decides to vote that this is where they're going to incentivize stablecoin liquidity, this would be a knock against Dai. Liquidity inside of Defi, Dai has other liquidity sources. So it's not only in curve, but losing curve does suck. And so this is terra taking an active stance.
00:53:33.402 - 00:53:36.766, Speaker B: Protocol wars. Stablecoin wars against Makerdao.
00:53:36.958 - 00:54:06.022, Speaker A: Yeah, it's interesting and working directly with fracs to do that. Right. And I think we're going to see more of these cartels that try to team up and dominate. It's just a lot of game theory going on with these adversaries as they're chomping to try to get stablecoin market share. And it's not only that, it's also not only alliances, but it's also like narratives. We're seeing this in the face. There's a lot of vitriol between these communities.
00:54:06.022 - 00:54:21.790, Speaker A: Dai versus Ust. I don't think I fully realized that that was a thing and that these were like bitcoin and ether level crypto conflicts. The communities had a lot of beef with one another until after that episode that we just did earlier this week.
00:54:21.860 - 00:54:35.090, Speaker B: Well, no, you're totally right. That wasn't a thing until this is starting it. This is formalizing the wars, right? Yeah, I was in the makerdow discord and they were using the. I don't think about you at all, Gif.
00:54:35.670 - 00:54:37.300, Speaker A: Like the John Hamm from.
00:54:39.270 - 00:55:01.874, Speaker B: Why is Tara so obsessed with maker and moving out Dai? Because Dai doesn't think about Terra at all. We'll see if that is a viable strategy. Like can makerdao just be heads down building forever and just kind of just focus on fundamentals? Which I think is admirable, but also, is it winning? Is it strategy admirable? I don't know. I don't know if it's a winning strategy.
00:55:02.022 - 00:55:04.398, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe that's why the Alpha report.
00:55:04.484 - 00:55:06.346, Speaker B: Is a neutral on Memkr.
00:55:06.458 - 00:55:17.370, Speaker A: It seems to be d on what maker does next. NFT news. Let's move to that pudgy penguins. They just tripled their floor price. I thought this project was like dying dead.
00:55:17.450 - 00:55:17.982, Speaker B: Going close.
00:55:18.036 - 00:55:21.602, Speaker A: Founder abandoned. Yeah, abandoned by the founder. What happened here?
00:55:21.736 - 00:55:47.254, Speaker B: The pudgy penguins floor was kind of more or less trending towards zero, but then zoomed up to, I think at like 2.5 ETH for the floor because the team has announced basically a roadmap of sorts, including a metaverse game, an airdropping, a token, kind of taken the board ape yachts club playbook and saying, hey, we're going to do that too. And so then as a result of that, the floor price mooned. I still have my penguins, but it's.
00:55:47.302 - 00:56:20.694, Speaker A: Interesting to me, it's like, you know, what kind of opportunities there might be in the future for investors. You know, how like private equity firms would go and buy struggling companies, replace management, turn them around, boost up the value and then sell them. That's what private equity is, basically. Tons of firms like this. I mean, you could do the same with NFT projects as well, right? You take a struggling NFT community, put in new leadership, create a compelling roadmap, buy it cheap and then flip it. I wonder if that's a little bit what's going on, but seems like opportunities for investors in the future.
00:56:20.812 - 00:56:22.120, Speaker B: Yeah, that's exactly right.
00:56:23.050 - 00:56:34.146, Speaker A: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. They are coming to an NFT collection near you. Spring 2022. Unbelievable, man. For people's childhood, ninja Turtles are back.
00:56:34.188 - 00:56:41.118, Speaker B: Did I ever expect us to be discussing teenage Mutant Ninja turtles on bankless? But like with NFTs, anything is possible.
00:56:41.284 - 00:56:46.160, Speaker A: Yeah, we used to take ourselves way more seriously. Now it's just turtles all the way down.
00:56:47.010 - 00:56:47.758, Speaker B: Nice.
00:56:47.924 - 00:57:07.266, Speaker A: Looks rare. They just created a chat button in their marketplace using Etherscan. We talked about this etherscan chat a little bit. This is Ethereum address to ethereum address messages. Almost like an AOL kind of chat feel. And now looksrara is incorporating it, which is pretty cool.
00:57:07.368 - 00:57:28.650, Speaker B: I really like that actually, because Etherscan has never people just like link to Etherscan. This is the first time I've seen Etherscan actually integrated into somebody else's front end. Really cool move by Etherscan. And I kind of want them to keep on doing stuff like this because ether scan is the one thing in crypto that ten out of ten on just what the product.
00:57:28.720 - 00:57:29.114, Speaker A: Love it.
00:57:29.152 - 00:57:34.926, Speaker B: Also, just like it's always up. We all take it for granted how awesome ether scan is.
00:57:34.948 - 00:57:35.438, Speaker A: We do.
00:57:35.524 - 00:57:44.298, Speaker B: And I'm very solid team from what I can gather. I would love to see what happens if they start to start to get a little bit more ambitious with what they can do.
00:57:44.484 - 00:58:15.398, Speaker A: Yeah, they could do a lot for sure. This is an NFT project that was really big this week. Vayner Sports, which is Gary Vee's brother. Apparently they just launched a Vayner sports pass, which is an NFT. They sold out super quickly. And that's part of the story. The other story of this is like it spiked gas fees for a period of time, fairly significantly big league, such that a lot of the transactions to purchase and mint these nfts actually failed.
00:58:15.398 - 00:58:50.850, Speaker A: And so looking at this tweet, David, a total of over 7600 ETH was spent just on failed transactions, failed and successful transactions on the Vayner Sports mint. And so that is $26 million of gas spent to try to mint this thing and to actually succeed in minting it, in some cases for a total of $8 million in NFT sales. So people spent 26 million to mint 8 million in value. Sort of weird.
00:58:51.010 - 00:59:44.406, Speaker B: Yeah. So the takeaway is that why didn't they do this on a layer two? Gary Vee has already done NFT minting on a layer two. And so let's see, there was 26 plus eight. So what is that $34 million worth of demand for these things? And Vaynermedia only collected $8 million of that. And so if people were willing to spend $34 million, of which we know that they were, because it's provable and on chain, they could have collected $34 million instead of $8 million by doing this on a layer two, like immutable or something like that, and you wouldn't have had the congestion. But instead they did it on the layer one, which we know is a bad place to mint nfts, even though people like their nfts on layer one. Question mark on that one.
00:59:44.406 - 00:59:58.006, Speaker B: Meanwhile, 4000 ether got burnt from this inside of just like not even an hour. It was like inside of 1 hour, 4000 ETH got burned. I think the largest single block of ETH burn was 150 ETH inside of one block.
00:59:58.118 - 00:59:58.490, Speaker A: Wow.
00:59:58.560 - 00:59:59.274, Speaker B: Pretty crazy.
00:59:59.392 - 01:00:04.958, Speaker A: That's a lot of money spent. A lot of money wasted, you would say, on this thank you contributions to.
01:00:04.964 - 01:00:05.962, Speaker B: The security of Ethereum.
01:00:06.026 - 01:00:21.522, Speaker A: I can't continue though. Can't continue. Got to start minting more on layer two. Let's go to bitcoin stuff, of course. Microstrategy Weekly update that they just bought more ETH, $190,000,000 worth of ETH. So Michael Saylor just continuing to dollar cost average in, we say this almost.
01:00:21.576 - 01:00:54.910, Speaker B: Every week and this is such a sazzle tweet. Anthony Suzano says sailor started buying bitcoin in August of 2020 and so far has accumulated 129,000 bitcoins worth 5.6 billion of which he can sell whenever he wants. The Ethereum network started burning ETH in August of 2021, and in that time has burned 2 million units of ether worth 6.6 billion, which can never, ever be reintroduced into the marketplace. And then I follow up saying, and Ethereum has basically infinity ammo, whereas Michael Saylor only has so much more ammo left in the tank.
01:00:55.730 - 01:01:04.330, Speaker A: We've got the infinity ammo. Michael Saylor, buyer, always buyer of ethereum, I guess. Always buying and burning eth that we.
01:01:04.340 - 01:01:09.570, Speaker B: Don'T even appreciate the protocolized version of Michael Saylor in EIP 15. Five nine.
01:01:09.640 - 01:01:18.982, Speaker A: Well, it's funny how the Michael Saylor stuff makes headlines every single time when he purchased. But the bitcoin burning is not the same.
01:01:19.116 - 01:01:24.962, Speaker B: Burning. Yeah, the ETH burning, it's quietly happening behind the scenes. Just burn, burn, burn, burn.
01:01:25.026 - 01:01:38.570, Speaker A: Silent burner. Other bitcoin news. There's a big conference going on, David and bitcoin Miami conference. Is that what's happening? The mayor of Miami just unveiled a bitcoin bull. Is that what we're looking at here?
01:01:38.640 - 01:01:59.774, Speaker B: Yeah. There is a new. Which is an allusion to the bull on Wall street. There's now a Miami bull because Miami is really taking the charge on just the crypto industry, especially the bitcoin industry. And so now there is the mechanical bowl for Miami to go along with the metal bowl that's on Wall street.
01:01:59.902 - 01:02:07.682, Speaker A: That's interesting. Are a lot of bitcoiners moving to Miami like Nick Carter moved there? Isn't Anthony Pompliano in there, too? Am I wrong about that?
01:02:07.736 - 01:02:19.450, Speaker B: No, though. Yeah. Miami has taken in a lot of those tech entrepreneurs being very pro crypto, being a bastion for crypto, especially for bitcoiners, because it's the right culture for them, I think.
01:02:19.600 - 01:02:42.926, Speaker A: Let's talk about some regulatory stuff. So the UK is getting bullish on crypto. The UK's finance minister just said, it is my ambition to make the UK a global hub for crypto asset. Pretty, pretty big words coming out of a government official. And maybe they have some proof as well. So they are minting nfTs.
01:02:42.958 - 01:02:50.322, Speaker B: David, a royal mint. This is an actual graphic out of the HM treasury. What's HM stand for?
01:02:50.456 - 01:02:51.294, Speaker A: Her Majesty's.
01:02:51.342 - 01:03:12.154, Speaker B: Her Majesty treasury. The Royal Mint NFT. The first ever minted NFT by the royalty of the UK. This decision shows the forward looking ambitions or forward looking approach we have determined to take towards crypto assets in the UK. The first royal right. All right.
01:03:12.192 - 01:03:13.002, Speaker A: That's amazing.
01:03:13.136 - 01:03:15.178, Speaker B: Never did I would ever see the.
01:03:15.184 - 01:03:18.746, Speaker A: UK government actually minting nfts. That's where we are.
01:03:18.928 - 01:03:19.986, Speaker B: Royal NFTs.
01:03:20.038 - 01:03:37.954, Speaker A: Right. Royal NFTs. Thank you. Yes. Not regular nfTs, not your average ninja turtle nfTs. These are royal. I do think that every jurisdiction is going to be fighting for crypto, like fighting for crypto legitimacy in the coming future.
01:03:37.954 - 01:04:03.050, Speaker A: And it's starting to happen because I think governments are realizing that crypto is a winning proposition, that it's going to be an engine of the future economy, and they want to be part of it. This is the tailwinds crypto has and why I think, long run, we win the regulatory battles, all of them. So we're starting to see evidence of that. Let's talk about Elon Musk. David, what's he up to?
01:04:03.200 - 01:04:23.386, Speaker B: Oh, just being Elon. Just chatting into 9% of Twitter. Oh, I got ahead of myself. Okay, so Elon Musk last week tweeted out, free speech is essential to a functioning democracy. Do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle? And then he had a poll. Yes or no? He followed up with that poll saying, the consequences of this poll will be important. Please vote carefully.
01:04:23.386 - 01:04:31.218, Speaker B: No one really knows what he meant. Anyways, I think 70 people said no to that question. So people think that Twitter does not function.
01:04:31.384 - 01:04:32.178, Speaker A: 70%.
01:04:32.264 - 01:05:17.198, Speaker B: Yeah, 70% says, Twitter does not rigorously adhere to the principles of a functioning democracy with regards to free speech. Later, we would discover that Elon Musk bought 9% of Twitter, 9% of the whole entire company, and then is getting invited onto the board of directors. This is Parag Agarwal from Twitter saying, I'm excited to share that we are appointing Elon Musk to our board. Through conversations with Elon in recent weeks, it's become clear to us that he would bring in great value to our board. He's both a passionate believer and intense critic of the service, which is exactly what we need on Twitter and in the boardroom to make us a stronger in the long term. Welcome, Elon. And then Elon responds to that and says, looking forward to working with Parag and Twitter board to make significant improvements to Twitter in the coming months.
01:05:17.198 - 01:05:24.302, Speaker B: Elon has got some opinions as to how Twitter should be, and he's buying 9% of the company in order to express those opinions.
01:05:24.446 - 01:05:39.830, Speaker A: Wow. Well, he is a Twitter super user. I'd say. Totally. He's one of the top 1% of all Twitter users. So I guess it's the Buffett adage of buy what. You know, he clearly loves this product because he's on it all of the time.
01:05:39.830 - 01:05:57.838, Speaker A: But what do you make of this? Do you think he's going to advocate for more free speech? And how does that actually happen on Twitter? I mean, Jack Dorsey always talked about turning Twitter more into a protocol and less of an application, but it never actually materialized. Do you think that's the direction Elon takes this in?
01:05:57.924 - 01:06:13.426, Speaker B: It's hard not to take a web3 framing on this, but also, at the same time, I just don't know how Elon would do that. Of all people. Elon's not yet into the world of web3. He's not yet web3 pilled. He's getting there. He's getting close. I do not know what he's up to.
01:06:13.426 - 01:06:14.130, Speaker B: Ryan.
01:06:14.790 - 01:06:31.586, Speaker A: Elon Musk on the Bankless podcast. Maybe sometime this year. David, that'd be amazing. Love to see that last thing before we get to the takes. Virgil Griffith. This is a sentencing of Virgil Griffith right now. We can talk about the sentencing in a minute, but could you do a quick recap of the story? David?
01:06:31.698 - 01:07:18.962, Speaker B: Yeah, Virgil Griffith, I believe he worked for the EF. He's been an ethereum developer for a long time, but he's also been in jail for a little over a year now. I believe he was jailed for going to North Korea and giving a presentation on crypto and blockchain. What was in his presentation was common knowledge is what Virgil Griffith is claiming and what people around him corroborate. So it's not like he was giving North Korea a secret like blockchain alpha. It's stuff that you could learn on YouTube. But the act of going into North Korea, which is not an illegal act, but then giving a presentation about blockchain tech has been deemed to be like, I'm not sure if it's treason that's the charge, but treasonous activities ish by Virgil Griffith.
01:07:19.106 - 01:07:20.550, Speaker A: Sanction evasion for sure.
01:07:20.620 - 01:07:30.010, Speaker B: Sanction evasion, yeah. And so he's been in jail waiting to have his sentencing, and here's his sentencing today. I don't know if this is official. Ryan, is this official?
01:07:30.670 - 01:07:55.890, Speaker A: I believe it is. I haven't read through the full document, though, but I think the headline is between 63 and 78 months of imprisonment in addition to a $1 million fine. And we'll include a link to the document so you can read it. It has this image, though, which I did scroll down and see, which is Virgil giving a presentation. You can see on the whiteboard. I'm sure the government kind of used this in their case. Against him.
01:07:55.890 - 01:07:58.418, Speaker A: No sanctions with a smiley face.
01:07:58.504 - 01:07:59.358, Speaker B: Uh oh.
01:07:59.544 - 01:08:02.694, Speaker A: Government kind of making their case here.
01:08:02.892 - 01:08:16.986, Speaker B: Yeah. But once again, the first thing you learn about when you learn about crypto is that you can invade sanctions. Is he getting in trouble for writing that on a. It's a bad look, Virgil. It's a bad look. But also, at the same time, there's nothing new here.
01:08:17.088 - 01:08:47.170, Speaker A: It's also true in a way, like no censorship, no know. Again, readers can read the entire report in the case of the government and draw their own conclusions here. But be very careful what you write on whiteboards, especially if you're in North Korea. Yeah, well, just maybe just don't go there is the first bit of advice, guys. We will be back with the takes of the week and of course, what we're excited about. But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
01:08:47.320 - 01:09:21.710, Speaker B: If you're trying to grow and preserve your crypto wealth, optimizing your taxes is just as lucrative as trying to find the next hidden gem.

Ethereum's layer two ecosystem is growing every day and we need bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer two life. Across is the fastest, cheapest and most secure crosschain bridge.
01:09:50.162 - 01:10:26.770, Speaker B: With across. You don't have to worry about the long wait times or high fees to get your assets to the chain of your choice. Assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously. Across bridges are powered by UMA's optimistic oracle to securely transfer tokens from layer two back to Ethereum. A token proposal is being deliberated as we speak in the across forum, where community members will decide on the token distribution. You can have your part of across the story by joining the discord and becoming a cofounder and helping to design the fair fair launch of across. If you want to bridge your assets quickly and securely, go to across to bridge your assets between Ethereum, optimism, arbitram, or Boba networks.
01:10:26.770 - 01:11:08.206, Speaker B: Arbitrum is an Ethereum layer two scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use DFI and nfTs. Over 300 projects have already deployed to arbitrum, and the DFI and NFT ecosystems are growing rapidly. Some of the coolest and newest NFT collections have chosen arbitrum as their home. All the while, DFI protocols continue to see increased usage and liquidity. Using arbitrum has never been easier, especially with the ability to deposit directly into arbitrum through all the exchanges, including binance, FTX, Huobi, and crypto.com.

Go to bridge Arbitrum IO now to start bridging over your eth and other tokens in order to experience defi nfts in the way it was always meant to be. Fast, cheap, secure and friction free.
01:11:25.210 - 01:11:48.638, Speaker A: Hey guys, we are back with the hot takes of the week. The first one from Nick. One confirmation he's a venture capitalist. Since Genesis in 2015, it's Ethereum. Genesis. Ethereum has led every bull market in 2017. Icos 2020, DFI 2021, nfts 2022 merge led every single bulb market.
01:11:48.638 - 01:11:50.810, Speaker A: That's the take. What are your thoughts?
01:11:50.890 - 01:12:08.886, Speaker B: I've been arguing on my older show, which I don't do anymore, pov crypto, which is me, and then the bitcoin maxi. He was always trying to say it's like it's the happening cycles, man. It's the happening cycles. And I'm like, what do we call the 2017 bull market? We call it the ico mania. That was Ethereum's bull market. Bitcoin went from like one.
01:12:08.908 - 01:12:10.210, Speaker A: It wasn't the happening mania.
01:12:10.290 - 01:12:37.546, Speaker B: It wasn't the happening mania, man. Bitcoin went from like $1000 to $20,000, but ether went from $30 to 1400 and then every other. The bull market for 2020 got kicked off with yield farming. We had the inflation narrative in the background. So it's not like bitcoin couldn't pull its own weight. But it was known as DFI summer, man, not inflation summer. And it's been nfts.
01:12:37.546 - 01:12:59.294, Speaker B: And now what Nick is now claiming is going to be 2022 is the merge hype. And so like I wrote in that market Monday a while ago, if bitcoiners think that bitcoin happenings can trigger bull markets, what do you think a triple happening in ethereum will do? Especially when ethereum is bigger than bitcoin ever was at any other previous happening except for the most recent one.
01:12:59.432 - 01:13:07.062, Speaker A: It's going to be good for bitcoin too, because all of these bull markets being led by ether also number go up for bitcoin. So bitcoin, you're welcome.
01:13:07.116 - 01:13:07.826, Speaker B: You're welcome. Bitcoin.
01:13:07.858 - 01:13:09.014, Speaker A: That's what we're saying. You're welcome.
01:13:09.132 - 01:13:18.234, Speaker B: Yeah. You're not secure in of yourself, but with Ethereum we'll pump your number up so you can be secure for a longer amount of time. Bring a friend.
01:13:18.352 - 01:13:19.418, Speaker A: You want to do this take?
01:13:19.504 - 01:13:33.786, Speaker B: Oh yeah, I know this guy. Ryan John Adams tweets, if you get into crypto to make life changing wealth overnight, you'll probably fail. But if you get into crypto to make life changing wealth over a decade, you'll probably succeed. Ryan why is it easier to do it over a decade than it is overnight?
01:13:33.898 - 01:13:53.686, Speaker A: You don't even have to think, man. You just buy, hold, stake. That's it. Three things you don't have to sell. You don't have to figure out what to ape into, what to trade. I do think that the problem with a lot of people in this space or the problem that they're going to have in this space is they just think too short term. Right.
01:13:53.686 - 01:14:46.722, Speaker A: I want to buy this thing because what's the next thing to do? 100 x like some token or the next NFT project? And I don't think most of the people I've met in the space that have done really well have just been people who've been in the market for a long time and bought and held. And I think it's so attractive to try to play the trading game, but most people are not going to make money that way. And thinking short term is like the way to lose in this market. So that's all it's just a reminder of if you're trying to make life changing wealth in cryptos, actually not that hard. The things you need to do are not difficult in terms of complexity. The only difficulty is you have to have the long term time horizon. And that's more a temperament discipline type of thing than it is like, actual intelligence.
01:14:46.722 - 01:14:53.914, Speaker A: It's not really that hard to buy good crypto assets and hold them for ten years. And if you do that, I think you will do.
01:14:53.952 - 01:14:54.250, Speaker B: Well.
01:14:54.320 - 01:15:00.460, Speaker A: It depends, maybe life changing wealth, it depends what that means to you, but that's certainly the way to do it.
01:15:01.390 - 01:15:28.706, Speaker B: People really get fomo in this industry, obviously, because that's what happens when you have provable scarcity. People don't get fomo over dollars because they'll just print more of them in the future. But as soon as you have, like, a supply cap with bitcoin and you have the eth burn, the deflationary of ETH, then people start to get fomo right. And then also when you get into crypto, everyone feels late. That is the first sensation that everyone feels after they start to have their aha. Moment about crypto. They're like, oh, I'm late.
01:15:28.706 - 01:15:54.218, Speaker B: What do they do? They take leverage. They go down to risky moon tokens that are short term thinking, and then they forget about how this is the largest wealth transfer event ever in human history, and they forget to be patient, and they try to catch up with the ogs by taking leverage and doing really risky stuff. Then they lose their money, and then they're even more behind. So the best thing to do is just buy, hold, and have patience and listen to bankless.
01:15:54.314 - 01:15:59.758, Speaker A: Totally agree. Okay, let's do this. Take this is from Hasu. Why don't you read it out?
01:15:59.844 - 01:16:36.266, Speaker B: Yeah. Ryan once upon a Time debated Hasu about a similar subject back, I think in 2019 or early 2020, Hazu tweets. Well, first off, there is a Twitter thread by a bitcoiner, Alex Thorne, who says bitcoin fees are at all time lows. The craziest thing? Fall 2021 was the first bull run not accompanied by a major spike in fees. How is that possible? What does that mean? Here's a thread explaining the most confounding and awesome chart in bitcoin. And then he makes a thread about explaining why bitcoin fees are going down even though when price is going up. But Hazu just says, ignore all that.
01:16:36.266 - 01:17:01.858, Speaker B: And Hazu just says, it means bitcoin is effed long term. But okay, keep brainwashing people with ridiculous positive spins. So this is less about Hazu's take. Even though I think both Ryan and I agree with this take. It's more about Hazu. Once upon a time, was taking the other side of this argument like, Ryan and Hazu had a debate on the Blockcrunch podcast, and Ryan was, of course, arguing pro ethereum. Hazu was a bitcoiner at the time.
01:17:01.858 - 01:17:11.522, Speaker B: I'll say Hazu was a moderate bitcoiner. But the difference in opinion that Hazu has now about bitcoin sustainability is just night and day from where we saw it in 2019.
01:17:11.666 - 01:17:33.642, Speaker A: Yeah. And I will give Hazu some credit for this, too. So we had that debate, and then it was kind of like later he actually did some due diligence and some research, and he came out with a paper, I don't know if this was 2019 or 2020, about basically the lack of sustainability. Here it is. Uncommon core, the paper. I remember reading this. 2019.
01:17:33.642 - 01:17:48.242, Speaker A: Yeah. So the lack of sustainability of bitcoin's block subsidy. He was still, like, bullish bitcoin at the time, but I think he recognized this issue. And I think this is Hasi reflecting, hey, three years later, this hasn't changed. Like, there's no fix.
01:17:48.296 - 01:17:49.182, Speaker B: It's getting worse.
01:17:49.246 - 01:17:50.190, Speaker A: It's getting worse.
01:17:50.270 - 01:18:00.054, Speaker B: The bitcoiner is saying the crazy thing that fall 2021 was the first run not accompanied by a major spike in fees. That is an Uhoh, moment for a bit.
01:18:00.092 - 01:18:02.306, Speaker A: Yeah. You should be like, you should be prepared.
01:18:02.418 - 01:18:04.134, Speaker B: Where's the fees coming from?
01:18:04.332 - 01:18:34.650, Speaker A: There's no block space demand. With no block space demand, you don't have security. We've talked about this forever. Just to underline this and make this clear, because some of you guys haven't delved into this, but bitcoin's issuance is going to zero over the long term. So no more blockchain subsidy. What do blockchains have to do? They have to secure their blockchain, either through issuance or transaction fees. So bitcoin is moving to zero issuance only transaction fee defense, like military budget.
01:18:34.650 - 01:19:05.146, Speaker A: So what does that mean? The military budget is going to go down unless, and this is the argument always given by bitcoiners about the fixed supply cap and why they're bullish. Unless transaction fees will rise to compensate for that. They are not rising. They are going down. Why? Because bitcoin blockspace does not have high demand. Why? Because it only does one thing, move bitcoins from one place to another. No defi, no defi, no nfts, no other sources of demand for this block space commodity and so net.
01:19:05.146 - 01:19:45.490, Speaker A: This is not sustainable. And I guess at worst, the entire chain could collapse. That's probably unlikely to happen, but what's much more likely to happen seems obvious. Will happen is other chains will succeed it and have far higher security budgets. And there is a thesis out there, of which I'm sympathetic and probably subscriber, that the highest security chain will win the network effect for this entire industry and become the money for this entire industry. So go securities, so go bitcoin value proposition and moneyness and store of value. And so what are you building the foundation on? So lots.
01:19:45.490 - 01:19:53.430, Speaker A: We've been pointing this out, other people have been pointing this out, but it doesn't invade the meme bubble, I think, of bitcoiners.
01:19:53.510 - 01:20:03.694, Speaker B: Yeah, bitcoin issuance dropping to zero. Bullish. Bitcoin fees already dropped to zero, more or less like it beat issuance in running to zero.
01:20:03.892 - 01:20:15.822, Speaker A: Yeah, I think Ethereum over the week, it's like 20 times more revenue from blockchain transaction fees. Over the last week, something like this. It was like 15 to 20 x.
01:20:15.956 - 01:20:16.958, Speaker B: 20 feels like low.
01:20:17.044 - 01:20:24.930, Speaker A: I mean, it depends on the week, right? But it's just a lot more. And there was a period of time where those two networks were neck and neck in transaction.
01:20:26.550 - 01:20:35.110, Speaker B: The majority of our time in crypto bitcoin has been in the lead up until the end of 2020 when the bull run really kind of started getting.
01:20:35.180 - 01:20:41.910, Speaker A: You know what's funny, David, is you know who kind of taught me the value of revenue from blockchain sales?
01:20:41.980 - 01:20:42.558, Speaker B: Was it hazard?
01:20:42.594 - 01:20:44.134, Speaker A: Nick Carter. It was Nick Carter.
01:20:44.182 - 01:20:46.218, Speaker B: Yeah, it was Nick Carter. Yeah, he taught me that too.
01:20:46.304 - 01:20:55.886, Speaker A: He totally emphasized that, opened my eyes to that in a big way. And, yeah, it made me more bullish on ether. Anyway.
01:20:55.988 - 01:20:59.882, Speaker B: Bitcoin has 4% the size of Ethereum's fees.
01:21:00.026 - 01:21:01.840, Speaker A: 4%. There you go, 4%.
01:21:02.930 - 01:21:05.642, Speaker B: Ethereum has 25 times higher fees than bitcoin.
01:21:05.786 - 01:21:08.258, Speaker A: There's advanced Spencer take. Why don't you read it?
01:21:08.344 - 01:21:25.282, Speaker B: 2021 narrative alt layer ones have solved blockchain scaling. ETH 2.0 is too little, too late. 2022 narrative alt layer ones haven't been able to scale. Most or all of them have structural issues. ETH 2.0 plus roll ups are the most viable way to scale a blockchain in the near term.
01:21:25.282 - 01:21:28.774, Speaker B: And he finishes with, funny how things change. L two.
01:21:28.812 - 01:21:33.662, Speaker A: Two. Do you think that's a narrative yet? I haven't seen that propagate as a narrative.
01:21:33.746 - 01:21:54.670, Speaker B: I have not seen that propagated, but I think he's calling it like, we're still pretty early into 2022. And I think also it's indicating that people are starting to understand deep protocol truisms that are in this industry and how some of the alt layer ones have violated those truisms. And therefore, that's like the structure. I think he's talking about how people are starting to wake up to this.
01:21:54.740 - 01:22:17.400, Speaker A: Well, we'll see if the market catches up to that and wakes up to that as well. This is a take from David Phelps. Incredible. To realize that web3 kind of has to be desktop only to avoid extractive fees from App Stores. We might look back and realize the success of mobile apps killed mobile apps because nobody can afford their taxes. Apple is a state. Web three is an anti state.
01:22:17.400 - 01:22:35.866, Speaker A: Think about that. It's a really interesting take. Like the Apple store, don't they take 30% of revenue of all apps? Like all apps. Right. And web3 is disintermediating. It is anti state. It is anti middleman.
01:22:35.866 - 01:22:49.838, Speaker A: It is anti intermediary. And so web3 kind of has to be desktop only. I've never thought about it like that, but I guess it's true. Or like mobile browser only. The App Store model just doesn't work. It's too closed.
01:22:49.934 - 01:22:58.760, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't think that's why web3 is desktop only, but I'm open to that argument. But I kind of think it's just because I don't want to use my ledger with my phone.
01:23:01.130 - 01:23:02.326, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely.
01:23:02.508 - 01:23:32.282, Speaker B: Okay, here's a take from Lenny Retchitsky. Sorry for butchering your last name. There are roughly 27 million software developers in the world. Only about 18,000 of them, or zero, 7% work on crypto or web3 every single month. Those 18,000 active engineers have created $2 trillion in market cap across the top 100 projects. 112,000,000 value per developer. And we have only $120,000,000 per value of each developer.
01:23:32.282 - 01:23:36.478, Speaker B: And we only have 0.7% of them. Ryan, are we early? Ryan? Is that what this means?
01:23:36.564 - 01:23:38.494, Speaker A: I think this tweet means we're early. Yeah, David.
01:23:38.542 - 01:23:39.742, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's my conclusion.
01:23:39.806 - 01:23:44.562, Speaker A: Look, all the engineers are getting all the credit. What about the educators? What did we.
01:23:44.616 - 01:23:47.122, Speaker B: Where's my $112,000,000 portion of that?
01:23:47.256 - 01:23:54.822, Speaker A: 2 trillion? Had to be educators, right? Yeah. I want to believe that a little bit. What are you excited about this week, man?
01:23:54.956 - 01:24:26.430, Speaker B: At the end of this week, Sunday, I hop on a flight to New York because Brooklyn specifically, because I'm going to be moving there at the end of May. That's the plan. So I'm just going into dabble around, get a feel for it, explore the Brooklyn crowd. Apparently the metaverse is being born and birthed in Brooklyn. That's where the epicenter of the metaverse is. Everyone who cares and is interested in web3 in the metaverse is all in Brooklyn, all in Williamsburg, apparently, specifically. So I'm going there for an Airbnb for a week while I plan my move and figure out where I want to live in Williamsburg.
01:24:26.430 - 01:24:47.846, Speaker B: And then after that, taking a flight straight to Amsterdam for Devconnect for East Amsterdam, which is going to be the nerdiest conference I think I will ever go to so far. And all the core protocol developers are there. Vitalik is going to be there. Danny Ryan is going to be there. Anthony Cesano, I haven't seen him since ETH Denver 2020. He's going to be there. It's over two years since I've seen that guy.
01:24:47.868 - 01:24:48.850, Speaker A: He got out of Australia.
01:24:48.930 - 01:24:54.810, Speaker B: He got out of Australia, yeah. So all my friends are going to be there. So I got a pretty fun two weeks ahead of me starting on Sunday.
01:24:55.950 - 01:25:09.120, Speaker A: So are you going to Brooklyn because you want to live in New York City or is this a little bit about crypto? You want to immerse yourself in crypto culture and have more kind of like in real life crypto friends around.
01:25:11.090 - 01:25:15.774, Speaker B: The latter. That one, I don't care about New York City in of the slightest, and I probably wouldn't be.
01:25:15.812 - 01:25:16.830, Speaker A: You hate the weather.
01:25:17.270 - 01:25:40.070, Speaker B: I just hate the density. Yeah, claustrophobia. But the number of friends that I have that are all in Brooklyn and Manhattan is just like growing through the roof. And so if you want, like I do want to be around web3, crypto, DFI, ethereum stuff. Twenty four seven. I love San Diego. I loved living here, but the crypto scene is just not there.
01:25:40.220 - 01:25:41.930, Speaker A: La has a crypto scene, don't they?
01:25:42.000 - 01:26:03.886, Speaker B: Yeah, but it's an NFT scene and it's the NFT scene. Know, it's the culture scene. It's the pop culture side of crypto, the nfTs. It's not the protocol side of that. I like the Defi, the DAos, the protocols, and the people that have the entrepreneurial spirit. So if you are in Brooklyn, if you're in Williamsburg, I'm going to be there for a week starting on Sunday. Come say hi.
01:26:03.908 - 01:26:04.286, Speaker A: There you go.
01:26:04.308 - 01:26:05.406, Speaker B: I don't know where I'm going to be.
01:26:05.508 - 01:26:10.210, Speaker A: Well, Brooklyn for ethereum, web3, and I guess Miami for bitcoin. That's how it's going.
01:26:10.280 - 01:26:11.842, Speaker B: That's a little bit right? That's a little bit right?
01:26:11.896 - 01:26:14.178, Speaker A: Yeah. Be good to have you on the east coast, man.
01:26:14.264 - 01:26:18.722, Speaker B: Synchronize time zone, dude, I might take the train up.
01:26:18.856 - 01:26:19.540, Speaker A: Hello.
01:26:19.910 - 01:26:25.014, Speaker B: You're going to have to. Have to deal with my ridiculous sleep schedule because up at like 630 every single morning.
01:26:25.052 - 01:26:25.238, Speaker A: I know.
01:26:25.244 - 01:26:27.094, Speaker B: You're pretty early to rise, though, right?
01:26:27.212 - 01:26:35.626, Speaker A: I'm early ish. But not that early. Dude, I'm not cranking by that time. So we're going to be. Everything about bankless is going to be.
01:26:35.648 - 01:26:37.578, Speaker B: Synced on the time schedule for the first time ever.
01:26:37.664 - 01:26:39.254, Speaker A: You're probably going to make me wake up earlier.
01:26:39.302 - 01:26:42.702, Speaker B: That's what will have to happen. All right, Ryan, what are you excited about?
01:26:42.836 - 01:26:46.160, Speaker A: I'm done. My taxes, dude, what a pain. It was just a pain.
01:26:47.570 - 01:26:49.402, Speaker B: You get the applause for that one, brother.
01:26:49.546 - 01:27:07.698, Speaker A: I guess it's taxes in crypto for anyone. You guys have done this. It's just such a nightmare. It's such a pain in the ass. Like tracking every single transaction. I can't believe some of crypto isn't actually treated like a currency, like a money, like the euro or the yen or the US dollar. Right.
01:27:07.698 - 01:27:13.234, Speaker A: Trap capital gains in and out, like your gas transactions. That's like your capital gains, long term.
01:27:13.282 - 01:27:14.546, Speaker B: Capital gains on gas fees.
01:27:14.578 - 01:27:40.670, Speaker A: Yeah. How do you manage when you put liquidity in a uniswap pool? Is that like a Tax event? What about staking in Eth? How do you recognize that? It's just so NFT. I haven't even talked about. Know. That's probably why I didn't do as much in the NFT world is because I was. Oh, every single thing is nfTs, right? No, but even buying them, if you buy NFTs with ETh, that's a tax event, bro.
01:27:40.740 - 01:27:45.242, Speaker B: But that's a normal crypto tax event where it's not any of the NFT complexity.
01:27:45.306 - 01:27:55.186, Speaker A: Yeah, but just tracking all. Anyway, I'm done and I'm so glad to be done. And I'm hopeful for a brighter future where some of this stuff can be automated. Figured out.
01:27:55.288 - 01:28:02.198, Speaker B: All of the data is on the Ethereum blockchain. The IRS needs to have a push button. Here's your number.
01:28:02.284 - 01:28:16.874, Speaker A: Well, we also need better tax laws. It's not every jurisdiction in the US where all of this stuff has to be tracked. I mean, there's some countries in Europe where crypto does not trigger a tax event. That would be amazing, too.
01:28:16.912 - 01:28:23.322, Speaker B: Anyway, well, Ryan, congratulations for making the lamest. I was excited. What I'm excited about that we've ever.
01:28:23.376 - 01:28:35.022, Speaker A: Had, how terrible you were, like, don't do this, Ryan. I'm like, I'm going to do it, because that's honestly what I'm excited about. I cannot lie on the show. Hey, I'm excited about this, though, too. Meme of the week. What do we.
01:28:35.156 - 01:28:37.214, Speaker B: You skip to the end, though? We have to start at the beginning.
01:28:37.342 - 01:28:38.642, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, go ahead.
01:28:38.776 - 01:28:42.386, Speaker B: We need the context for this. How did this come about?
01:28:42.488 - 01:28:59.426, Speaker A: Okay, here it is. We talked about it with Vitalik. So this guy tweets out. I don't actually know him. He said we're canceling each other over food takes today. Post your cancelable food take, your cancelable food cake. And he said I was already cancelled over my ice cream plus basalmic take, which is gross.
01:28:59.426 - 01:29:00.550, Speaker A: You should be canceled for that.
01:29:00.620 - 01:29:14.282, Speaker B: No, Ryan, it's so delicious. Vanilla ice cream and balsamic vinegar. Oh, no. You can get even, like, raspberry balsamic vinegar, and it's so good. Oh, dude, you don't know what you're missing. Vanilla ice cream, balsamic vinegar. I know you've got some in your house.
01:29:14.282 - 01:29:15.680, Speaker B: You gotta go try it.
01:29:16.370 - 01:29:34.210, Speaker A: All right, I might try that, but I don't know if I'm brave enough to try this. This is Vitalik's cancelable food take. I generally don't drink alcohol stuff, but mixed green tea plus red wine. 85% to 15% ratio is underrated. My man. Vitalik mixes green tea and red wine.
01:29:34.550 - 01:29:56.780, Speaker B: What's up with that? Yeah, I sure it's underrated. If it has any ounce of just, like, being good at all, people are definitely underrating it because no one thought about that combination. And so the meme for the limp, bankless listeners is that meme where somebody's dual pressing two soda streams at the same time, green tea and red wine, and then going into the same cup, and then the caption is the merge question mark.
01:29:57.870 - 01:30:00.060, Speaker A: I actually am going to try that, though.
01:30:00.430 - 01:30:25.442, Speaker B: This is now the new meme. This meme is going around crypto Twitter of just, like, this is now called a butyrin or a vB. So you can go to your local bar. If they don't know what this is, just tell them. And so that this is now the new thing. I think this is actually just what a bougie version of a four loco is. I don't know if you remember four locos, right? But they were basically, like, what high schoolers would drink if they didn't have a lot of money.
01:30:25.442 - 01:30:42.050, Speaker B: You would basically pay, like, $4 for one, and it would kind of get you wrecked because it was both caffeine and alcohol and just, like, syrup at the same time I got it. So get the caffeine from the green tea. You get the nice red wine mold. Wine flavor, I guess you're selling to.
01:30:42.060 - 01:30:54.874, Speaker A: Me, but it's only 15% red wine. And I was like, thinking about what color could this possibly make in your cup or in your glass? Right? You got the green tea look, plus red wine. That's got to make some kind of like gross looking brown.
01:30:55.002 - 01:31:00.350, Speaker B: No thing. It's got to be like because green tea can be like mostly water. I think it's closer to a rose.
01:31:01.010 - 01:31:07.426, Speaker A: Well, maybe bankless listeners, you guys can try the VB special report out a.
01:31:07.448 - 01:31:13.746, Speaker B: Hot topic at ETh Amsterdam. I think everyone at ETH Amsterdam will definitely be drinking the butyrins when we.
01:31:13.768 - 01:31:19.234, Speaker A: Do the live stream because, you know, we're live streaming the merge. When that happens, we are all going to be drinking vbs. Oh my God.
01:31:19.272 - 01:31:30.934, Speaker B: That's exactly what we're going to be doing. It's going to be like seven in the morning and we're drinking green tea. That's a great morning drink if you have to drink alcohol, I think green tea and a splash of red wine is a great way to wake up.
01:31:30.972 - 01:31:33.178, Speaker A: Okay, but you can't say that until you've tasted it.
01:31:33.264 - 01:31:36.746, Speaker B: You can't say that, dude. It's called the VB. I'm going to love it.
01:31:36.928 - 01:31:51.194, Speaker A: All right, guys, this has been the meme of the week and this has been bankless. Of course, none of this is financial advice. It's not drink advice, beverage advice either. Please do not cancel us. That was Vitalik who said this. But of course, Eth is risky. Bitcoin is risky.
01:31:51.194 - 01:32:02.978, Speaker A: You could definitely lose what you put in. All of Defi is risky. Sorry your beverage choices, but we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone. But we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
