00:00:00.170 - 00:00:26.102, Speaker A: We are looking at the chart of Salana, which started in May 2020, about below a dollar. At the top of 2021, 2022, it was $270 and now it is $8.36 down, I think 94% from all time highs. The Salana community is trying to bolster morale. The ETH community is saying it was vapor all along. The trading community tells me how bad the chart looks. Anthony, what's your take on the, on the ecosystem right now?
00:00:26.156 - 00:00:41.700, Speaker B: I just don't think the Salana architecture is long term sustainable. I don't think Salana is going to win against Ethereum and its L2 ecosystem. From a fundamentals perspective, salana had support from SBF and FTX, right? And now that they're gone, Sol is going back to basically the price that it started at.
