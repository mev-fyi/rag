00:00:00.090 - 00:00:49.090, Speaker A: When you introduce a wolf into an ecosystem as a keystone predator, the diversity and ecological health of the entire landscape goes up. And I'm always asking, how can humans be a regenerative keystone species on planet Earth? How is our presence here actually a force for regeneration instead of a force for degeneration? We're in this climate catastrophe. We've been pumping carbon from below the Earth into the atmosphere, creating the greenhouse effect, all of these other things. Carbon is really the least of our problems. In a lot of ways, this is an example of humans not behaving like a keystone species. We're behaving as a species that's tending towards simplifying and degrading and making ecosystems more fragile.
