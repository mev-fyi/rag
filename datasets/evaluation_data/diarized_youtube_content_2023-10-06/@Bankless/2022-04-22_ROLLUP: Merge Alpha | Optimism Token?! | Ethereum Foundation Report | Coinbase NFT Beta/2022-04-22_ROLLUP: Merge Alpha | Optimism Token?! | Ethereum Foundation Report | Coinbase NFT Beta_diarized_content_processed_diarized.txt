00:00:00.170 - 00:00:22.142, Speaker A: All we know is this space is going up. Crypto, bitcoin, eth, they are going up and to the right over the long term time horizon. Bankless nation. It is the third week of April. David is in Amsterdam. I'm in the US, and we are getting ready to present you with the weekly roll up. David, how you doing, man? How's Amsterdam going?
00:00:22.276 - 00:00:39.110, Speaker B: Dude, Amsterdam is absolutely majestic. Something that has complete consensus with everyone here is that Amsterdam is a great city. It's so walkable, it's so pretty. The weather is beautiful. Sun is out, but it's cold and crisp. There's canals. I went on a boat ride yesterday.
00:00:39.110 - 00:00:45.542, Speaker B: It was also 420 in Amsterdam yesterday. So a lot of. Some people got up to some shenanigans.
00:00:45.606 - 00:00:47.978, Speaker A: That's like the 420 capital of the world too, right?
00:00:48.064 - 00:00:49.740, Speaker B: That's exactly right. Yeah.
00:00:50.910 - 00:00:55.274, Speaker A: That's cool, man. But what were you there for? It was like a crypto conference, right? Devconnect.
00:00:55.322 - 00:01:14.066, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. Maybe that's relevant. Devconnect. Yeah. So this is an ethereum, the EFS. Basically what they did, really genius model is they hired or they rented out the convention center in the middle of the city, and it's now just a co working space. And so everyone who signed up can just cowork there.
00:01:14.066 - 00:01:52.270, Speaker B: So I've just been hanging out there and that's all that they did on theme with a modular structure. All the EF did was rent out this center space for us to converge upon. And then many, many other entities made other short term, day long panels or day long talks or day long events. So there's the shelling point from Kevin Owalki. I was at Oval fest from Colin Myers. There was also, what is it, trust x, where I was on a panel with some gigabrains, Danny Ryan, Preston Van Loun, dank rad. And so it's just like everyone is attending their own conference, their own day of talk.
00:01:52.340 - 00:02:04.354, Speaker A: So it's kind of like an unconference, right, where everyone sort of know creates their own events and brings their piece to the party. So is this like a mini Devcon then, would you say?
00:02:04.472 - 00:02:44.334, Speaker B: I'd say so, yeah. It's something brand new. All of the core ethereum researchers, like the client researchers, they all got into a room and pow wowed, and so actually made some progress. And that is actually the big theme, I would say, of this particular event where people are busy, people are getting work done. And so it's not like NFT NYC or it's not like ETH Denver, which is more of like a festival we are here to build. Right? And you can actually see that in some of the nightlife where people are going out to parties like 10:00 p.m. But then the parties kind of shut down between midnight and 01:00 p.m.
00:02:44.334 - 00:02:46.674, Speaker B: Because people got stuff to do the next day.
00:02:46.792 - 00:02:56.482, Speaker A: Builder culture badass. That's awesome. Well, we'll talk more about that because I want to hear if you got any updates on Ethereum research, like when merge. David, can you be the when merge guy?
00:02:56.616 - 00:03:00.202, Speaker B: But of course, I will tell you what people have been saying about the merge.
00:03:00.286 - 00:03:01.910, Speaker A: Tell us towards the end of the.
00:03:02.060 - 00:03:13.258, Speaker B: Was I actually met Justin Drake for the first time. And so I got a beer with Justin Drake and he was just like lovely to hang out with. And of course we talked about the merge. So more on that at the end of the show.
00:03:13.344 - 00:03:38.126, Speaker A: Okay, merge alpha, we'll see what Drake thinks about the merge. Of course, we got some other topics of the week because crypto can't stop, won't stop, sneak peek into the Coinbase NFT platform launch. We have the beta, we have our hands on a copy. I've given it a trial run. I want to hear what you think about it, too, David. We'll go through that. Also, North Korea apparently was the attacker of the ronan sidechain, that massive 600 million dollar plus exploit that was actually North Korea.
00:03:38.126 - 00:04:08.518, Speaker A: The US government is saying. So what does that mean? We are now nation state attacked blockchains after a fashion. Also, Arthur Hayes, Bitmex CEO founder, thinks we're headed for a bear. I think we had to talk about that in the market section, see if he's right, see what the bear case is for crypto right now. Andre Cronier also, he's a Defi developer. Of course, he had some spicy takes this week, David, about regulation in Defi. It seems to be the anti Andre move, and he wants to incorporate some regulation in Defi.
00:04:08.518 - 00:04:09.690, Speaker A: So we're going to weigh in on that.
00:04:09.760 - 00:04:21.534, Speaker B: And there were also some spicy takes about his spicy takes. A lot of people called some BS on Andre Cronier's article, very short article. So that was very hot in the Twitter sphere this week.
00:04:21.652 - 00:04:54.602, Speaker A: So we're going to talk about all of those things. One thing, talking about conferences, talking about Devconnect and a builder conference, another builder conference that you absolutely should attend, must attend, is graph day. This is happening in San Francisco. It's going to be a four day event June 2 through the fifth day. One is the talks that's where you listen, you learn, you get educated. But the remaining three days of this four day conference, it's all pure hackathon, which is amazing for builders. So if you are a builder, you want to get into the web3 space.
00:04:54.602 - 00:05:21.422, Speaker A: Like the graph protocol is basically indexing everything about the metaverse, everything about crypto. They are like a data layer for this whole universe, web3 universe that we have delved into. So it's a fantastic place to meet other builders, to actually participate in the hackathon, earn bounties for yourself and get into the space. Maybe you're looking for a career in the space. This would be the event to attend. Look at these speakers, David. It's stacked.
00:05:21.486 - 00:05:28.226, Speaker B: It's stacked. Yeah. Cammy Russo is going to be there. Reese Linmark, one of my personal heroes. Is there. Ava Balin. Yeah.
00:05:28.226 - 00:05:42.566, Speaker B: Check out the lineup and the talks, I'm sure are going to be fantastic. And, of course, if you are a hacker, they have money for you. That's what a hackathon does. And so if you want to compete for some money and you are a hacker who wants to hack on things, sign up to join the hackathon.
00:05:42.678 - 00:05:57.246, Speaker A: Go get your tickets. Now, if use the code in the bankless show notes, there is a $50 discount for you as well. All right, speaking of discounts, are we discounted on bitcoin and eth this week? Let's start with the bitcoin charts as we get to markets. What's bitcoin looking like?
00:05:57.348 - 00:06:13.266, Speaker B: We are certainly not discounted this week, Ryan. We started the week at 39,700, just below that $40,000 number, which we do not want to be below. At. And we are currently above that number at $42,640, up about 7% on the week.
00:06:13.368 - 00:06:18.054, Speaker A: Amazing. Look, man, last week I said I was bullish. I didn't exactly know why, other than.
00:06:18.092 - 00:06:20.742, Speaker B: Like, a gun claiming victory, Ryan, I'm not.
00:06:20.796 - 00:06:41.502, Speaker A: Look, man, yeah, I'm claiming victory. I was right. From last week to this week, I will never claim when I'm wrong, but when I'm right, I'm happy to claim that, David, on short term price action. But seriously, guys, don't listen to me on anything short term price related. All we know is this space is going up. Crypto, bitcoin, eth, they are going up and to the right over the long term time horizon. Just my cap.
00:06:41.556 - 00:07:01.186, Speaker B: Speaking of up and to the right, Ryan, ether started last week at $3,000. It hit a low of $2,900. We do not like that 2900 number. We want to be above that 3000 number of which we are currently clocking in at $3,150 overall, up 4.5% on the week. So bitcoin takes the week for this week. Is bitcoin this week?
00:07:01.288 - 00:07:08.278, Speaker A: Look, bitcoin outperformed eth this week. It hasn't done that for a while. And that reflects in the ETH to bitcoin ratio. That's got to be down this week.
00:07:08.364 - 00:07:14.918, Speaker B: Yeah, down about a percent and a half. Down to zero. 74. Down a little bit. Down a little bit.
00:07:15.004 - 00:07:23.786, Speaker A: Are people getting bitcoin bullish off of bitcoin? Miami, do you think, or why do you think this happened? We just can't read too much into this data.
00:07:23.888 - 00:07:32.890, Speaker B: Yeah, one part noise. Let's not read into it too much. But also one part if we are bullish like, it is traditional to let bitcoin go first. That is tradition.
00:07:32.970 - 00:07:46.242, Speaker A: After you. Let's take a look at the total crypto market cap and can compare bitcoin and eth to that. So looks like we are up on the week for total crypto market cap, but not by a ton. What's that?
00:07:46.296 - 00:07:53.090, Speaker B: Up on the up 5%, brother. 1.96 trillion last week to 2.7 trillion this week.
00:07:53.160 - 00:07:54.750, Speaker A: But bitcoin outperformed.
00:07:54.830 - 00:07:56.526, Speaker B: Total bitcoin outperformed.
00:07:56.718 - 00:07:59.234, Speaker A: It hasn't done that in old man bitcoin.
00:07:59.282 - 00:08:05.238, Speaker B: Yeah, outperformed the market by, like, 3%. And ether underperformed the market by 0.5%.
00:08:05.324 - 00:08:11.130, Speaker A: Oh, I'm proud of you. Bitcoin. Well done. Yeah, that's right. We'll see. We'll track it next week. I make no more predictions.
00:08:11.130 - 00:08:36.526, Speaker A: But one thing to watch, I think in the backdrop of this crab market, whether are we in bull territory, are we in bear territory? We're kind of somewhere in between is the DXY, which is the dollar index. And the dollar has been breaking out, man. So this is kind of weird. When we say breaking out, it's appreciating relative to other fiat coins, cryptocurrency.
00:08:36.558 - 00:08:37.614, Speaker B: Dollar strength.
00:08:37.742 - 00:09:26.802, Speaker A: Yes, dollar strength relative to other fiat, not relative to crypto, of course. And it's up, like, look at this chart, man. It's up to, like, above any level since COVID And people are, like, wondering maybe, why does the dollar go up when we are being faced with eight and a half percent inflation? Just like the dollar went up in value in the early days of COVID if you recall. And I think the reason for this largely is the dollar is still a flight to safety asset, and people are uncertain they don't know what the Fed is going to do. They don't know how that's going to affect other asset classes. And so what do they do? Temporarily, they retreat into the dollar for a while, wait for other assets to fall, and then redeploy their dollars into those assets. It's kind of like what traders do sometimes.
00:09:26.802 - 00:09:37.540, Speaker A: You and I might do this. If we're rebalancing, we might rebalance back into stablecoins out of crypto for a period of time, wait things out, and then buy lower. What are your thoughts on this?
00:09:37.910 - 00:09:51.542, Speaker B: Well, okay, so the general correlation is that as the DXY, as the dixie they call it, goes up, crypto is correlated inversely correlated. So crypto goes down. Crypto didn't go down too much. I mean, it's gone down since like January or so as the DXY has gone.
00:09:51.596 - 00:09:55.254, Speaker A: Not like Covid the other time the dollar was on a tear. Like crypto died.
00:09:55.382 - 00:10:03.118, Speaker B: Yes. What I'm seeing, Ryan, and maybe I'm just spinning it to talk my own books, but when I see the dollar going up, I just see more for it to.
00:10:03.204 - 00:10:21.282, Speaker A: So, David, not bullish on the dollar, long know, but this is kind of the big question. Arthur Hayes, the CEO of BitMex, who is big crypto trader, obviously monitors these things from a macro perspective. He made the case that a crypto correction is incoming. This is a.
00:10:21.336 - 00:10:24.126, Speaker B: He said crash, Ryan. He said crash in his article.
00:10:24.158 - 00:10:27.010, Speaker A: Did he? I'm going to go search the word crash.
00:10:27.090 - 00:10:28.706, Speaker B: Yeah, no, it was a crash.
00:10:28.738 - 00:10:29.766, Speaker A: Well, no, he said that.
00:10:29.868 - 00:10:30.182, Speaker B: No.
00:10:30.236 - 00:10:31.410, Speaker A: Yeah. Crypto crash helmet.
00:10:31.490 - 00:10:31.922, Speaker B: Helmet.
00:10:31.986 - 00:10:48.614, Speaker A: Put it on your crypto. Crash helmet. Okay. Colorful language. Love Arthur in his predictions. And basically his rationale was crypto is correlated with tech stocks. He gives all these examples of how crypto is correlated with tech stops stocks.
00:10:48.614 - 00:10:54.894, Speaker A: Lots of charts. Tech stops stocks are going down. Right. Do you see Netflix this week, by the way?
00:10:55.012 - 00:10:55.866, Speaker B: Big, oof.
00:10:55.978 - 00:11:21.286, Speaker A: Lost $50 billion. Right. Netflix subscriptions are down. So tech stocks going down as a result of the Fed policy tightening. And so what does that mean? Arthur is just putting one and one together and he's just like, well, that equals crypto is also going down. Crypto is also classified as a risk on asset, just like tech stocks. So if tech stocks are going down, of course crypto has to follow it and put on your crypto crash helmet is what he's saying here.
00:11:21.286 - 00:11:22.710, Speaker A: That's the bear case. Yeah.
00:11:22.780 - 00:11:53.678, Speaker B: It also got way more nuanced than that, though. He also talked about the central bank of Japan and the japanese equities market as, like, a canary in the coal mine as well. Some really big brain finance economy stuff that I'm not capable of reiterating. So if you want to learn more, just read the article that's in the show notes. But the summary TLDR is that he believes that bitcoin and ether are crashing to the low, low prices of $30,000 bitcoin and $2,500 ether, which. Ryan, I'm kind of confused as to.
00:11:53.684 - 00:11:56.980, Speaker A: Why he's not worried about that. Yeah, that's not a crash helmet, man.
00:11:57.350 - 00:12:01.218, Speaker B: We saw that this year, right? Yeah, that's fine.
00:12:01.304 - 00:12:03.474, Speaker A: I don't need a helmet for that. That's just like.
00:12:03.512 - 00:12:05.394, Speaker B: Okay, you need a bid for that.
00:12:05.512 - 00:12:07.214, Speaker A: Yeah. Did you say a bib?
00:12:07.342 - 00:12:08.170, Speaker B: Bib?
00:12:08.350 - 00:12:13.238, Speaker A: Okay. Like a bib. Like you're drooling or something. I don't know, but okay.
00:12:13.404 - 00:12:14.600, Speaker B: I could say that.
00:12:17.610 - 00:12:44.030, Speaker A: Interesting, I guess. Opposite case is coming out on Monday's podcast with Dan Moorhead. So Dan Moorhead does not think that crypto will remain correlated with tech stocks. And if you want to hear why, listen to him. He is the CIO, co founder of Pantera Capital. And a lot of good macro takes here. So you can see the bear case put out by Arthur and kind of the bull case, but even Arthur is not very bearish when you boil it down to pricing.
00:12:44.370 - 00:12:51.762, Speaker B: Yeah, that's just a bad week. Perhaps a really bad week. But that's not, like, blood in the streets level.
00:12:51.896 - 00:12:57.778, Speaker A: No way. That's not crash helmet level for sure. Just put on your bibs, guys. That's all you need. Optimism.
00:12:57.874 - 00:13:12.682, Speaker B: This is fun. Yeah. Okay, so this is the talk of the town right now at Devconnect, everyone is talking about optimism, and we've got six indications that optimism is interested in a token. And so this is the first one.
00:13:12.816 - 00:13:14.918, Speaker A: Or imminent, deploying a token.
00:13:15.014 - 00:13:34.754, Speaker B: Yeah, perhaps more of the latter, Ryan. Okay. There are some breadcrumbs. Being trailed, perhaps, and everyone at Devconnect is like, oh, yeah, those are big breadcrumbs. So here's the first one. On April 19, a few days ago, optimism tweets out. Optimism's story thus far by the numbers, saved $1.1
00:13:34.754 - 00:13:51.778, Speaker B: billion in gas fees for its users, onboarded 300,000 unique Ethereum addresses, secured $900 million in value, and facilitated $17.4 billion of transaction volume, and also generated $24.5 million in revenue.
00:13:51.874 - 00:13:53.170, Speaker A: That revenue is impressive.
00:13:53.250 - 00:14:08.282, Speaker B: That's a great revenue number. Yeah. $24.5 million. From the sequencing of the transactions, these are how roll ups make their money. And then they finish this off with, a new chapter is near. Let's take a minute to reflect on the path thus far.
00:14:08.282 - 00:14:17.246, Speaker B: A new chapter is near. So, Ryan, they're talking a lot about financial chapters, like money, numbers, and then they say a new chapter is near. What could a new chapter be?
00:14:17.348 - 00:14:23.440, Speaker A: That's clue number one. But you said you had six. Six, yes. What's this? What am I looking at?
00:14:25.410 - 00:14:47.670, Speaker B: This is the red dot. This is a red dot emoji. There's, like, some dot emojis with the underscore with a red dot emoji. And this is generally a meme that many communities have. And this is now what optimism tweeted out as, like, okay, here's our community. But all the other communities, Ryan, have tokens that do this. Optimism would be the first community to do this that doesn't have a token.
00:14:48.410 - 00:14:50.342, Speaker A: That's kind of playful. Okay, clue number.
00:14:50.396 - 00:14:52.198, Speaker B: Very playful, very community generation.
00:14:52.294 - 00:14:53.818, Speaker A: Wait, what is this?
00:14:53.904 - 00:15:30.360, Speaker B: I have no clue what this is, but everyone is like the optimism team. Their sense of humor is very indie and kind of surreal, I would say absurdist humor, I would say. And so for the listeners, this is a cat with its paw on a bunch of watermelon. But the watermelon are all red and they're titled ops. Are they plush toys? Yeah, maybe they're plush toys. They look like watermelon, but they're all circles, right? They're all, like, tokenish and so with op written on them. And I guess it's just kind of absurdist humor, but everyone's like, I don't know how or why this makes me think that there's a token, but it does.
00:15:30.730 - 00:15:33.350, Speaker A: Clue number three. All right, what's number four?
00:15:33.500 - 00:15:35.762, Speaker B: Okay, this one's a little bit more explicit, Ryan.
00:15:35.826 - 00:15:39.330, Speaker A: Kind of blatant coinbase in the territory of a leak.
00:15:39.410 - 00:15:54.560, Speaker B: Yeah. Coinbase shows price page for optimism, suggesting a token could be on the way. This might have been an accident by Coinbase, but they added a token page under the title of optimism. And so this is all happening all at the same time.
00:15:54.930 - 00:15:59.566, Speaker A: Thank you, Internet sleuths, for uncovering that. Is that number four?
00:15:59.748 - 00:16:09.006, Speaker B: That's number four. That's number four. And number five is that I'm at Devconnect and everyone is talking about it. And so that's the other thing explicitly.
00:16:09.038 - 00:16:10.786, Speaker A: About a token everyone's talking about.
00:16:10.808 - 00:16:31.862, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. Have you seen the hints that optimism is leaving on the table? I was listening to a panel where all the layer twos were talking about layer two stuff hosted by Anthony Cesano, saw my best friend, he was great, gave him big hug, and then he hosted a panel and I watched that. And of course, his final question is when token? As a meme. Like when token?
00:16:31.926 - 00:16:32.298, Speaker A: Ha.
00:16:32.384 - 00:16:51.022, Speaker B: You don't have to answer that. But then Ben Jones from optimism immediately grabs the mic and he goes, all information about this is viewable on our public website. There's no information on there. But the exuberance of grabing the mic to say that I thought was interesting. So that's number five, Ryan, and number six. Are we ready for number six or you want.
00:16:51.156 - 00:17:12.946, Speaker A: I'm ready, but I just want to interject one thing. So optimism, releasing a token to me, kind of kicks off layer two, summer, layer 222, that we've been saying, right? The big thing, they've got the traction, they've got the value, they're generating the revenue. The next thing layer twos need is a token to accelerate all of this. So with that, what is the 6th clue?
00:17:13.058 - 00:17:27.770, Speaker B: The 6th clue, Ryan, is just. We're just going to straight up ask them on the state of the nation on Tuesday. They're coming on Tuesday because that is when they are scheduled for. So optimism is coming on the state of the nation on Tuesday and we are just going to ask them what their plans are with the token.
00:17:28.110 - 00:17:56.946, Speaker A: Well, hopefully you were a user of optimism in the past. You probably saw them in our airdrop guide that we published on bankless back in October. And we'll see what happens. We'll see if this is imminent. It would be very interesting if they were one of the first major layer twos besides, like, Polygon and that sort of thing, to release a token. I think that's a great news for retail. Who previously hasn't had exposure to many layer two options, investing options, and there.
00:17:56.968 - 00:18:09.702, Speaker B: Is a spicy take in addition to. We'll talk about this later in the take section. But in addition to l two two coming, l two two ride is going to be spicy. You know how spicy the alt layer one wars were.
00:18:09.836 - 00:18:10.278, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:18:10.364 - 00:18:12.342, Speaker B: Layer two wars are going to be the same thing, brother.
00:18:12.406 - 00:18:14.854, Speaker A: You're talking about, like, layer twos against layer.
00:18:14.982 - 00:18:16.058, Speaker B: Yep. Yeah.
00:18:16.144 - 00:18:17.734, Speaker A: Why do the kids have to fight, David?
00:18:17.782 - 00:18:19.370, Speaker B: Kids are going to have to fight, Ryan.
00:18:20.190 - 00:18:24.618, Speaker A: Come on. I don't just. We're all on team Ethereum, are we not?
00:18:24.784 - 00:18:32.206, Speaker B: Yeah, this is true. We're all on Team Ethereum, but you got to compete for the users. There's only so many users and so much TVL to go around.
00:18:32.308 - 00:18:53.926, Speaker A: Well, I want to talk to you more about that later, but let's keep moving for now. So in other news, Ust that's the terra stablecoin just became crypto's third largest, so they just overtaken binance USD. So it's probably just tether and USDC leading. And then ust now go, stablecoin enters number third. What do you think about this?
00:18:54.108 - 00:19:12.074, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, you got to do the tip of the hat to the growth strategy of terra scalable blockchain, scalable stablecoin. When you add those two scalable things together, like, you get a bunch of scale. And so tip of the hat to UST to becoming stablecoin number three.
00:19:12.192 - 00:19:13.102, Speaker A: Don't screw it up, guys.
00:19:13.156 - 00:19:14.430, Speaker B: Please don't screw it up.
00:19:14.500 - 00:19:42.374, Speaker A: Please don't screw it up. Share of the NFT market. This is fantastic from Andrew Steinwald, who is an NFT investor. Saw this a long time coming. In fact, predicted NFT season long before on a bankless podcast, long before it came. Anyway, put together a fantastic report through his crypto fund, his NFT fund on total sales volume of nfts. And it's divided into four categories, art, collectibles, gaming, and the metaverse as a percentage of dollars.
00:19:42.374 - 00:20:02.038, Speaker A: And what's interesting about this chart, David, is you could see kind of the squilly lines, how the different categories ebb and flow. So we had a massive sort of art season at first, and these would be probably one of ones in 2020, 2022. And that has kind of tamed down as a percentage of market and what's.
00:20:02.054 - 00:20:06.726, Speaker B: Really going to be art block season, right? That's got to be some of that season. Yeah.
00:20:06.768 - 00:20:31.350, Speaker A: Now we got collectible as a big category and metaverse. Anyway, it's interesting to track these different categories of nfts over time, because even within the NFT sector, some categories of nfts can be bullish and others can be kind of bearish, and new ones are emerging all of the time. Some other broad metrics I think are pretty useful for you guys if you want a chart of what the NFT market share looks like. But second graph.
00:20:32.250 - 00:20:33.720, Speaker B: Yeah, click on that one.
00:20:34.250 - 00:20:35.974, Speaker A: I'll just blow this up here.
00:20:36.092 - 00:20:58.106, Speaker B: Okay. Look at that, man. Really, everything NFT related started kicking off, it looks like in June of 2021. And that total sales volume, the volume of NFT sales has just had a very strong floor ever since then, like huge spike in August of 2021. But ever since then, like NFT volume, it looks like it's here to stay forever.
00:20:58.218 - 00:21:06.640, Speaker A: Here it is. We're at almost 10 billion in total NFT sales volume from the beginning of this year. That's just the beginning of this year.
00:21:07.090 - 00:21:10.546, Speaker B: There's hope for your underwater NFT guys. There's still volume out there.
00:21:10.568 - 00:21:13.054, Speaker A: Thank you. You tell me turtles are still going to be a thing, David.
00:21:13.102 - 00:21:14.994, Speaker B: Turtles might still be a thing.
00:21:15.192 - 00:21:26.454, Speaker A: You know, David, we're going to talk about some more things that could be bullish for the NFT sector, in particular coinbase. They just released their NFT platform. But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:21:26.572 - 00:21:57.470, Speaker B: The era of proof of stake is upon us, and Lido is bringing proof of stake to everyone. Lido is a decentralized staking protocol that allows users to stake their proof of stake assets using Lido's distributed network of nodes. Don't choose between staking your assets or using them as collateral in Defi. With Lido, you can have both. Using Lido, you can stake any amount of your EtH to the Lido validating network and receive ST ETH in return. ST ETH can be traded, used as collateral for lending and borrowing, or leveraged on your favorite Defi protocols. All this without giving up your ETH to centralized staking services or exchanges.
00:21:57.470 - 00:22:43.630, Speaker B: Lido now supports Terra Solana, Kusama and Polygon staking. Whatever your preferred proof of stake asset is, Lido is here to take away the complexities of staking while enabling you to get liquidity on your stake. If you want to stake your eth, terra Sol or matic and get liquidity on your stake, go to lido fi to get started. That's Lido fi to get started.

00:23:59.228 - 00:24:20.878, Speaker A: Hey guys, we are back with the releases of the week. Have to start with the hottest release of the week, which is the Coinbase NFT platform just rolled out into beta. All right, so only for a subset of users. This is the Coinbase block GM. Coinbase NFT is now in beta. David, I know you've been super busy this week. Have you had a chance to take a look at this?
00:24:21.044 - 00:24:22.094, Speaker B: Absolutely not.
00:24:22.212 - 00:24:23.326, Speaker A: You have an invite, though.
00:24:23.428 - 00:24:28.594, Speaker B: I have an invite, yeah, Coinbase NFT platform invited me, but I was like, I don't have time for this.
00:24:28.712 - 00:24:56.394, Speaker A: Yeah, I saw they dm me from the Coinbase and they said, here's an invite code. And I was like, what is this, a scam? And it looks like it's legit from Coinbase. And turns out, I glad you checked. Yeah, I have an invite to the beta platform. This is kind of what it looks like. So if you guys are viewing this on YouTube, you can sort of see. And what was interesting about this, and this is from our conversation with Brian Armstrong, is how social networky it actually is, right? So look at this.
00:24:56.394 - 00:25:02.894, Speaker A: This looks like a timeline you might find on a social network. See, this timeline accounts to follow, which.
00:25:02.932 - 00:25:13.198, Speaker B: Makes sense because the NFT ecosystem moves forward in time very, very quickly. Right? Like the fads move very quickly. So it makes sense for a timeline structure to be that way.
00:25:13.284 - 00:25:15.774, Speaker A: Well, it has an account like, you can go follow Brian Armstrong.
00:25:15.822 - 00:25:18.818, Speaker B: Brian Armstrong, the new tom of the Coinbase NFT platform.
00:25:18.904 - 00:25:37.640, Speaker A: Who is he following? He's not following me yet. Brian Armstrong, please follow. But he's got a thousand followers, right? And you could see what's in his wallet. I could actually see everything in my wallet. I'm not logged in at the moment. And then of course, there's the open sea shop capability. Right? So you can actually start to buy some of these things.
00:25:37.640 - 00:25:53.982, Speaker A: I don't know, man. Look, Mark Zuckerberg talking about the metaverse, right? Last week we talked about his plan was to do a 50% commission on any NFT sale. Do you think he sees this and is like shit in his pants right now? Do you think he's concerned, got him about what Coinbase is doing?
00:25:54.036 - 00:26:01.422, Speaker B: Tax is real, then he has to. It's completely. Anyways, yes. Yes. Is your answer to that?
00:26:01.476 - 00:26:15.298, Speaker A: Yeah, it's just. Look, Coinbase is becoming more of a social media type brand with this play. And I like it. Personally, I like it. I think there's a lot of potential here. It's fairly simple right now, but I'm excited to see it expand. So this is in beta now.
00:26:15.298 - 00:26:31.706, Speaker A: It'll go generally available, I'm sure, in the kind of the weeks to come. Of course, Coinbase is attending the permissionless conference and their vps over this are going to talk more about it. So if you're attending that, you can get the scoop. But also it did something to zero X token price. David, what's that about?
00:26:31.808 - 00:27:11.910, Speaker B: Yeah, so Zero X, the Zero X network, is a relaying network for messages about trades. And so Coinbase NFT platform announced that they are using the Zero X network to facilitate trades and as a result, the Zero X token is up 30%. So congratulations to the Zero X network. The Zero X is Dow and Zero X token holders. They claim the very strong gas efficiency and also cross chain messaging for cross chain sales, which I think is. I don't know how that would work because you can't buy an Ethereum NFT on Solana, but maybe you can pay for an Ethereum NFT and get your Ethereum NfT using Solana tokens or something like that.
00:27:11.980 - 00:27:30.598, Speaker A: Yeah, they're just kind of going multi chain like, being able to view it. Yeah. But I'm not sure how the trading works, whether they're bridging from chain to chain, if that's what you're talking about. But right now, the Coinbase marketplace, NFT marketplace, is just Ethereum only. So that's where they're starting. But I'd imagine they'd expand to other chains as well. So pretty cool launch.
00:27:30.598 - 00:27:52.706, Speaker A: We'll see how this goes. Hopefully this mainstreams more people into the NFT world. Right. There's like, what 40 million or so, maybe 50 million people sign up, users. Yeah, exactly. And they had a lot of interest for this, too. Another thing that happened this week, I guess, in the releases section is the Ethereum foundation finally released their financial transparency report.
00:27:52.706 - 00:27:54.750, Speaker A: What's the significance of this, David?
00:27:54.830 - 00:28:31.038, Speaker B: Yeah, this has been long sought after, from the general Ethereum community to EF. Tell us what your bags are. The EF is a nonprofit that got spun up at the very genesis of Ethereum. It had part of that Genesis allocation of ether from the very beginning, and they've been slowly selling that ether over time to fund stuff, developer salaries, things like Devconnect and Devcon, for example. But there hasn't really been too much transparency into the actual financials of the EF. And largely the first two years, three plus years of the EF, was very chaotic. And so getting all the ducks in.
00:28:31.044 - 00:28:34.190, Speaker A: A row, it almost went underwater. Like they almost ran underwater.
00:28:34.850 - 00:29:01.026, Speaker B: Yeah, right. But things are really shaping up around the EF, and they finally released a report that describes what is actually in the EF treasury. And it's a lot of money, Ryan. I think it's over a billion dollars and $1.61 billion in ether. Excuse me, 80% of that is in ether, which is, if you are curious, that is 0.3% of the total circulating supply of ETH.
00:29:01.026 - 00:29:13.834, Speaker B: And also they hold $11 million in other cryptocurrencies, probably bitcoin, because they took the ether like Genesis sale, the presale in bitcoin. So they probably been holding some of that bitcoin for a really long time, and then probably the rest is in dollars as well.
00:29:13.952 - 00:29:29.154, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's pretty cool, right? So you said it's a lot. $1.6 billion is a lot of money, 80% in ether. But think about it from the perspective of total supply. It's tiny. It's so tiny. 0.3%
00:29:29.154 - 00:30:04.942, Speaker A: of all ether supply. Compare that to the other centralized bodies that are creating clients on some of the other alternative layer, ones that own 1015, 20%, sometimes way more, sometimes way more massive amounts. So this is actually a modest, relatively modest amount. Good, of course, to see that they're holding it in ETh. I imagine they'll stake. Like, you could basically create kind of a perpetual funding for something like the EF. If you just take a large portion, say, a billion dollars of your ETH, you stake, you generate a 4% return, and then you kind of fund the protocol for what it needs.
00:30:04.942 - 00:30:06.766, Speaker A: I wonder if that's what the plan is.
00:30:06.868 - 00:30:18.114, Speaker B: Long term. Yeah. Instead of having block rewards funding, which is extremely contentious but also very sustainable, like proof of stake yields from a billion dollars that can fund a lot of salaries for a large amount of time.
00:30:18.232 - 00:30:25.266, Speaker A: Yeah. And that's a billion dollars at today's ETH price. Right. When ETH hits ten k, when ETH gets 20k, when ETH hits 30k, as.
00:30:25.288 - 00:30:27.970, Speaker B: It'S when ETH fulfills its manifest destiny.
00:30:28.870 - 00:30:44.294, Speaker A: That'Ll be a lot more. So that's good. And look, they're spending about $48 million per year right now, so they do have a fairly high burn. There's a breakdown of that, too. Good to see some additional transparency here. It's bullish, David. Another release this week, we're still on the releases.
00:30:44.294 - 00:30:50.058, Speaker A: An NFT product from index co op. It's called JPEG. JPG, what is this?
00:30:50.144 - 00:31:35.706, Speaker B: Yeah, it's designed to provide liquid access to the top NFT collections through a single index token. And so in order to be included in this new JPEG index, a token must be a claim on or be collateralized by or provide currency for nfts. Basically, it's not an index with nfts inside of them, it's an index with ERC 20 tokens that are related to nfts. So there's fractionalized crypto punks. For example, there's the Jenny Dow, there's the Sox token for the uni socks. There's also the dog currency out of the doge ecosystem from pleaserdao and a few others as well. Basically, if you are a token that has financialized nfts in some way, this is an index for that.
00:31:35.888 - 00:32:18.680, Speaker A: Cool. I'm excited to see that grow with some other financialized ERC 20 assets as well. Also vault rolled out this week. This is like a CPI adjusted stablecoin designed by the tribe ecosystem, the creators of Faye. To me, when I read this, David, it seems sort of similar to what you're talking about with Sam, which is Frax's CPI adjusted stablecoin, which is basically like inflation is eight and a half percent per year. You can hold your money in a stablecoin dollars, but why not create something new and create some sort of stablecoin that doesn't degrade at the rate of inflation? So it keeps up with CPI. So you could hold it in this asset and not get that 8.5%
00:32:18.680 - 00:32:24.922, Speaker A: inflation rate. They do that with an on chain oracle that measures CPI. What do you think about this?
00:32:25.056 - 00:32:37.166, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm actually kind of skeptical about these whole CPI adjusted stablecoins I guess they're good for holding, but when you break the peg of the dollar, you lose the dollar standard.
00:32:37.268 - 00:32:37.534, Speaker A: Right.
00:32:37.572 - 00:32:46.914, Speaker B: And one of the reasons why stablecoins have so much liquidity is because they're all interchangeable with each other. Dai tether, USD, USDC. And there's a lot of liquidity there.
00:32:46.952 - 00:32:49.250, Speaker A: You use like the unit of account, right, right.
00:32:49.320 - 00:33:14.202, Speaker B: Breaking the unit of account loses a lot of network effects. And so can this thing be super liquid like TBD? I could totally understand if you are interested in just holding your savings in dollars, then this would be a good thing to hold it in. But then are you going to be able to yield farm with this thing as much as you can with dollars in defi? Like kind of unsure about that one. And so I'm a little bit skeptical as to the adoption of this thing.
00:33:14.336 - 00:33:50.246, Speaker A: Yeah, it's like a different standard. One thing I'll say is super cool that crypto can produce something like this because this is not available in the quote unquote tradfi real world. But yeah, I kind of agree with you. My idea about storing wealth is I'll store some in dollars, right? But then I want to store everything else in ETh. I don't want this mid in between thing that is just protecting me from CPI inflation. I'd rather just have some dollars over here and then eth over here that's providing the protection and kind of the middle part of the barbell I just don't really care too much about. But we'll see.
00:33:50.246 - 00:33:51.094, Speaker A: That's just me.
00:33:51.212 - 00:34:09.578, Speaker B: I mean, inflation was 8.5%, reported like 10% plus actual. Again, Dan Moorehead podcast going to be a great one. And so I guess if you can't yield farm more than that, then it makes sense. But you can get your yield farm returns pretty high. It's going to be a tug of war here.
00:34:09.664 - 00:34:17.694, Speaker A: Yeah, it's cool. By the way, look, you mentioned the Dan Moorhead podcast that's coming up. We just released the spring lineup for the Bankless podcast. Let me tell you.
00:34:17.732 - 00:34:19.162, Speaker B: Is this a bankless release?
00:34:19.306 - 00:34:27.326, Speaker A: This is a bankless release. We're fitting this in the releases. So read out what's coming, what's coming down the pipe for bankless Dan Moorhead.
00:34:27.358 - 00:34:41.366, Speaker B: Coming on Monday, but followed by Steve Aoki. Steve Aoki, the entrepreneur who's into NFTs, who also throws cake in the face of his fans. He's coming. We're recording him on Wednesday. Brian, I bet you didn't know that Steve AoK is known for throwing cake at people.
00:34:41.468 - 00:34:42.502, Speaker A: I didn't know that. No.
00:34:42.556 - 00:35:01.354, Speaker B: Yeah, he's known for that. Yeah. Jim O'Shaughnessy, he's coming on the podcast, followed by Raul, Paul, and then Kevin O'Leary. Mr. Wonderful, he's coming on. We're going to live stream with him getting the other half of the shark of the crypto shark tank. And then Ryan, I think this last one's so great.
00:35:01.392 - 00:35:01.782, Speaker A: Drumroll.
00:35:01.846 - 00:35:13.838, Speaker B: Mark Andreessen and Chris Dixon. Mark Andreessen comes back to. Comes to the podcast for the first time, the Andreessen of a 16 Z. And then Chris Dixon coming back to co guest with him as well. Yeah.
00:35:13.924 - 00:35:21.214, Speaker A: Awesome, man. Look, Andreessen doesn't do crypto podcasts. This might be his first one. I'm super excited to talk to him. They're stacked.
00:35:21.342 - 00:35:44.742, Speaker B: There are so few people left for the Bankless podcast, and those people are Elon Musk. Ray Dalio. And that's about in. He needs to buy his NFT first. So if you can get us access to Ray Dalio, we really want Ray Dalio. He needs to come on bankless and also Elon Musk. Elon Musk will come eventually, but Ray Dalio is the one.
00:35:44.796 - 00:35:51.114, Speaker A: We're really actually on my list. David is Elizabeth Warren. I want to have a nice talk with. With Elizabeth.
00:35:51.242 - 00:35:52.720, Speaker B: Yeah, I bet you do.
00:35:54.530 - 00:36:06.466, Speaker A: All right, let's go to raises. Man. Raises. So the sandbox, which is a metaverse platform, they just geared up for another raise. This is a $4 billion valuation. They just raised $400 million.
00:36:06.648 - 00:36:07.042, Speaker B: Crazy.
00:36:07.096 - 00:36:08.270, Speaker A: What's this next one, David?
00:36:08.350 - 00:36:24.114, Speaker B: Framework ventures, Vance Spencer. He was our first big episode on the podcast ever. The bullcase for DFI. They raised a 400 million dollar fund with a special focus on blockchain gaming. So congratulations to the team over at Framework Ventures. I've met some of your guys here at Devconnect.
00:36:24.242 - 00:36:50.366, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a really talented team. Super crypto native. An indian cryptocurrency exchange called Coin DCX just topped a $2 billion valuation, $130,000,000 funding. Interesting to see every one of these nation state geographies have their own sort of set of exchange players, and India is certainly one of them. So it's onboarding more indians to crypto, which is fantastic. What's this next one?
00:36:50.468 - 00:37:10.374, Speaker B: Yeah, EPNS, the Ethereum push notification system service, raised $10 million at a valuation of $131,000,000. This is like push notifications for anything that's happening to your wallets. In case, I don't know, you get an airdrop, you can get a ping on your phone. 100 and 130 million dollars valuation. Congratulations, guys.
00:37:10.492 - 00:37:31.302, Speaker A: That's cool. Speaking of Mr. Wonderful, coming on the podcast, live streaming, Kevin O'Leary. His backed platform called Wonderfy just acquired Coinberry for $38 million. Coinberry is a canadian cryptocurrency exchange. That's where Kevin's from, Canada. So it looks like he's wanting to get in on the canadian market there with crypto.
00:37:31.302 - 00:37:39.290, Speaker A: That's pretty cool as well. David, did you have any jobs talk this week in Amsterdam? Are people hiring?
00:37:39.450 - 00:38:00.002, Speaker B: The joke was Bartech. This is going to be also again later in the takes. But Bartech from l two beat talked about when he was going through his talk. He's like, well, I'm interested in hiring, but everyone in this room is interested in hiring and so there's nothing new information. Everyone is hiring in crypto. And so if you got the talent, you can find the jobs.
00:38:00.146 - 00:38:08.854, Speaker A: Yeah, and to find the jobs, go to bankless palette.com slash jobs and you'll be able to find them. Okay, I'm going to read some out for you.
00:38:08.972 - 00:38:23.014, Speaker B: This first one though, I'm going to read this one out. Ryan bankless Jr. Designer plus after effects skills. You might have remembered our ultrasound money. There is no floor meme. A while ago, a gif, a very long gif. There was also this football gif.
00:38:23.014 - 00:38:34.526, Speaker B: If you are good with after effects and also have junior design skills and want to be paid to make dank memes bankless, the company that you are listening to right now is hiring, so special call out for that.
00:38:34.628 - 00:38:49.686, Speaker A: We're always in the dank meme market. Also an Ethereum core developer. Wow, that's a really bold job position from Nethermind. They're an Ethereum client, a Golang engineer for Sturknet client Nethermind as well. We're still looking for a newsletter editor. I see David. He's up there.

And David is now jumping on the bed in his hotel room in order to help you get a job in crypto. That's the length this man is going to to help you get your job in crypto, which is where you need to spend your career. We're only going to keep hiring. This job list is only going to get longer.
00:39:35.736 - 00:39:42.760, Speaker B: Some people have their snow dance. When they want snow to happen, they have their snow dance. I have the. I want bankless listeners to get a job.
00:39:43.450 - 00:40:04.442, Speaker A: Join us. Join us. Let's talk about this news time. One of the big news items of the week was a metamask hack exploit. Okay, don't freak out. It's not every metamask account, of course, but this is an interesting security hole. So one metamask user just lost $655,000 worth of crypto.
00:40:04.442 - 00:40:40.242, Speaker A: A lot of these were nfts using metamask on mobile. What happened? Well, apparently if you have your settings set up to do this on your iPhone, Metamask will actually upload metamask private keys to the iCloud Apple cloud as a backup. Right. To help restore Metamask if you lose your phone or something. A backup, nice friendly backup. Well, this user had his icloud account compromised, and so some of those private keys were compromised. And so I think this is sort of a PSA, this is what? Public service announcement.
00:40:40.242 - 00:41:08.334, Speaker A: If you are using metamask on mobile, if you have an Android, if you have an iPhone in particular, and you are uploading your backups, your private keys to iCloud, don't do that anymore. Turn off that setting. Go check your phone right now. We'll include a link in the show notes where you can find the exact setting to disable under profile icloud backups. Just don't backup your private key. Keep your private keys on your phone. If you're using metamask in this setting.
00:41:08.462 - 00:41:11.730, Speaker B: Name a worst duo private keys in the Internet.
00:41:12.070 - 00:41:27.074, Speaker A: Private key. Don't put them in the cloud, guys, good private key management. Good reminder, David, there was another exploit this week. I'm wondering if you'd talk about this, and maybe we should start with the bean price chart, because that's where the exploit was, this token called bean.
00:41:27.202 - 00:41:52.590, Speaker B: It looks like it's up 100%, but it's not. It's not actually on the actual front page. It's actually down very big. Yeah. So there was an exploit to the tune of $80 million, 24,830 e plus 36 million bean token. All right, what is bean? It's a decentralized algorithmic stablecoin. I think it's got reminiscent, it reminded me of empty set dollar a while ago.
00:41:52.590 - 00:42:14.082, Speaker B: When price goes above a dollar, they create more of these tokens to bring the price back down. And then when the price goes down below, they attract new buyers by issuing credit. And very risky, very experimental. Seemed to be going well, if you like. Yeah, look at that market cap. Market cap was going up and to the right really fast, and then it went to zero because of an exploit.
00:42:14.226 - 00:42:15.062, Speaker A: Near zero.
00:42:15.196 - 00:42:44.490, Speaker B: Very near zero. Basically to zero. And so the exploit was pretty interesting, actually. It was a flash loan governance attack that enabled the attacker to drain all of the money in the treasury, I guess. So there is a bip. What I can imagine is a bean improvement proposal 18 was flash loan approved by a hacker. And once that EIP was merged on chain, I think this is how this works that enabled this exploit to happen.
00:42:44.490 - 00:42:55.266, Speaker B: And then in that same transaction, the attacker approved the governance proposal and then drained the treasury and was yanked all the funds, $80 million.
00:42:55.368 - 00:43:12.170, Speaker A: I've never seen a chart like this, David. Look at this, man. This is just pretty off a cliff, right? This is what happens when an elgo stablecoin gets hacked. You go from $100 million in market cap all the way down to like 5 million in the space of like 24 hours, like 96, 97% loss. Boom.
00:43:12.590 - 00:43:15.740, Speaker B: A $5 million market cap, Ryan, is essentially zero.
00:43:16.510 - 00:43:52.294, Speaker A: It may as well be. And this hack was interesting. I think we've been talking a lot about algorithmic stablecoins recently, and a lot of the concern about them is sort of depegging risk, right? If it's not backed, there's kind of the run on the bank, and then everyone tries to cash out. There's non loved liquidity, and the price crashes. Right? That's definitely one way an algo stablecoin could die in a hurry, but the other way is it just gets hacked. This was an economic exploit. So issues with the smart contract code essentially led to some flaws which allowed the flash loan governance attack.
00:43:52.294 - 00:44:00.514, Speaker A: And this also kills the algo stablecoin. So a lot of risks when we're talking about these types of stablecoins.
00:44:00.642 - 00:44:23.840, Speaker B: Yeah, especially when algo stablecoins are inherently faith based. Right? Anything under collateralized, its remainder collateralization is therefore faith. And this one had zero collateral, and so it was all faith. And so once the economic incentives break, and then it goes into faith, and if there's not enough faith there to back it up because it just got exploited, it just goes to zero.
00:44:24.610 - 00:44:54.742, Speaker A: The bean community is still trying to resolve, trying to come back from this. I don't know if they'll be successful or not certainly some of the other stablecoins that have just evaporated, never came back. Like, empty set dollar basis cash. They're all in the dustbin of history, so we'll have to see. Reminding you that these algo stablecoins in particular, are incredibly risky and experimental. David, we said this in the intro. North Korea was actually responsible for last month's massive side chain ronin theft.
00:44:54.742 - 00:44:58.490, Speaker A: The FBI is now confirming this. What's the story here?
00:44:58.640 - 00:45:23.090, Speaker B: Yeah, I actually don't know how we confirmed that it was North Korea, but this Lazarus group, which has been associated with North Korea, is apparently discovered to be responsible for the hack. So North Korea now owns $625,000,000 worth of eth. I tweeted out loud during that hack, like, hey, if you steal, like, $600 million from an exploit, you have to pay taxes on that. And it turns out in this case, they don't, because it's North Korea.
00:45:23.910 - 00:45:30.822, Speaker A: Wow. And they're actually cycling a lot of this through tornado cash or some of it through tornado cash to try to wipe the slate clean.
00:45:30.956 - 00:45:38.246, Speaker B: That confuses me, because what does it matter? They're in North Korea. They're not hiding from anyone.
00:45:38.428 - 00:45:51.246, Speaker A: Then they can change it. Like, they can cycle it into, I guess, another asset and sort of cash out. Because right now, the ETH that they stole is kind of blacklisted from a lot of exchanges from the rest of the world.
00:45:51.268 - 00:45:53.630, Speaker B: But the whole country is blacklisted, Ryan.
00:45:54.610 - 00:46:30.626, Speaker A: I don't know. I don't know. You know, what is interesting to me, and this was more like a multi sig attack, where, again, someone, like, validators were keeping their private keys in the cloud, which, again, do not do this, especially if you're a bridge or a side chain. So that's the way it was hacked. But it also reminds me of something we talked about a long time ago during the earlier days of crypto, is this concept of being. Having sovereign security resistance. So, like the bitcoiner concept of one day, the nation states are going to come attack our blockchain, and we have to be ready for that.
00:46:30.626 - 00:46:55.940, Speaker A: We have to be resilient against those forms of attack. We're not exactly sure how they will do this, but this is now kind of a nation state operative group attacking crypto assets and after a fashion, attacking chains. So we're at that point in history where blockchains are getting attacked by nation states. And that's why security matters, I think, more than ever, particularly at the base layer. So somewhat interesting.
00:46:56.550 - 00:46:58.740, Speaker B: Security is tight. We like security.
00:46:59.190 - 00:47:03.458, Speaker A: This is cool. Too. Maker is integrating Starknet. What's happening here?
00:47:03.544 - 00:47:13.426, Speaker B: Yeah, basically they are deploying multilateral dai, they're deploying maker dow onto Starknet natively. And so that's the news. So congratulations to maker Dow.
00:47:13.538 - 00:47:29.926, Speaker A: Ten x, improvement in gas costs. Of course, that is the big carrot that these protocols have for moving to layer two. David, let's talk about this in NFT news. So punk 6529 has just released something called Om. What is Om?
00:47:30.038 - 00:47:46.206, Speaker B: Yeah, Om. I actually don't know what Om stands for. My guess was open metaverse, but the name actually isn't. Whatever that stands for isn't out. Or maybe it just means Om. Om is a digital museum. And so 6529 has a fantastic NFT collection.
00:47:46.206 - 00:48:45.102, Speaker B: He's a collector of collectors and so he's building out this Om museum to display his NFTs in some sort of like, it's also a digital land space. And so it's kind of like, I think a hub and spoke model where there are actually ten museums out there and this is just the first one. And there are going to be, I think, sales for the remaining amount of land. People can come and check out all of the nfts in the gallery, probably with some sort of like virtual reality, but it's probably viewable on your computer as well. And so all of his first, the first district, they're calling him districts, is going to display 2000 nfts from different collections, including 6529s as well as some others, board, avi club, cryptopunks, all the art blocks. And then over time, these different districts, ten self governing cities, he describes them, will be unveiled and slowly rolled out in what is being called the Alpha mode version of this Metaverse museum?
00:48:45.246 - 00:49:01.530, Speaker A: This is pretty stunning. I love these visuals. This looks great. Do you think this will catch on? Do you think the future of NFT museums is not physical? Going to a museum in person and seeing like a digital display, but actually going into the metaverse and displaying nfts in somewhere like this?
00:49:01.680 - 00:49:26.458, Speaker B: I certainly think there's room for both, but I definitely think that the product market fit behind a digital NFT museum. I mean, it's the same thing. So many more people see my crypto punk on my Twitter avatar than they would if I displayed my crypto punk in my apartment, although people do see that because it's in the background of my weekly roll ups, but still people see that on Twitter more. And so a digital metaverse, a digital museum, is going to be much more accessible than a physical one.
00:49:26.564 - 00:49:44.006, Speaker A: Do you know, as cool as this is David. It does also feel a little skumorphic. Right. Because we're sort of replicating the museum. This is the first phase of crypto display where we're sort of replicating the museum experience, but putting that in the digital world. And I wonder how much more we'll unlock. Right.
00:49:44.006 - 00:50:01.578, Speaker A: It's kind of like the early stages of the Internet, where we would just take a physical magazine and we just upload that, basically. And then we found out no, website design is much more fluid, much more dynamic. There are way better ways to display this content than just porting the print magazine format to the digital world. I wonder if we'll see that in the future as well.
00:50:01.664 - 00:50:07.770, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's a good take. But in order to get to the Internet, Ryan, you still had to start with putting a magazine on the Internet.
00:50:07.850 - 00:50:24.786, Speaker A: You have to go through the skumorphic phase no matter what. Absolutely. That is the model. This is cool. Warner Music Group just partnered with Poap, the Poap protocol to mint shared memories as nfts. We've talked about Poap in the past. This is now a record label partnering with Poap to do that.
00:50:24.786 - 00:50:25.874, Speaker A: What do you think this means?
00:50:25.992 - 00:50:41.314, Speaker B: Yeah, I think they're just going to be integrate nfts in the same way everyone else loves nfTs, and they're huge at conferences. Ryan, I saw actually out of the Poap team, credit card sized credit cards, I guess, poap RFid chips.
00:50:41.362 - 00:50:41.526, Speaker A: Right.
00:50:41.548 - 00:50:58.366, Speaker B: And so I can hand you my credit card and you can put your phone on it, and then, boom, you can mint my NFT or my Po app. I mean. Yeah. So the cool thing is I have all these stickers. I have some of them here in this bag. This is the boomer phase of poaps, where I've been handing out these stickers and then a QR code on the back. Yeah.
00:50:58.366 - 00:51:28.514, Speaker B: And then people throw, like, then they get the QR code and they can slap a sticker somewhere. But then this one is just like a card, like you hold in your credit card wallet and you can just place it under somebody's phone and then, boom, mint a po app. And so mine is the you met David Hoffman Po app with Warner music group rapper Kevin Gates. Here's an example of how this is going to get used. Kevin Gates. Never heard of him. Is related to integrate poaps into his Casa tour, making one available to fans who attend his upcoming show at Red Rock.
00:51:28.562 - 00:51:32.380, Speaker A: Amplify. You go to a concert, you get a poap. Right.
00:51:33.390 - 00:51:36.540, Speaker B: That's perfect. I was there, I was there.
00:51:36.990 - 00:51:58.558, Speaker A: And you get these hardcore fans who. I went to ten, I went to 20. I'm basically going with this band all across the country, all across the world. I'm collecting these po apps. And then maybe on the other side of that now the creator has, like, an airdrop list. A list? Yeah. I want to see who your 1000 top fans are, the people who have the most poaps.
00:51:58.558 - 00:52:01.346, Speaker A: And so what do you do with that? Super cool.
00:52:01.448 - 00:52:02.222, Speaker B: Totally.
00:52:02.366 - 00:52:03.060, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:52:03.510 - 00:52:04.946, Speaker B: Use cases are obvious.
00:52:05.128 - 00:52:26.380, Speaker A: Yeah, they sure seem to be. And yet, at the same time, we do have these, like, top signals, maybe some 2017 vibes in the NFT world. This is an influencer shill price list. And so people aren't aware. There are a lot of NFT influencers in the space, and they actually get paid to promote things. Okay? So, like, crazy. Be aware of this.
00:52:26.380 - 00:52:44.042, Speaker A: If you want an NFT influencer to retweet your NFT retweet something, or do a shill tweet to their followers, this is the price point for that, you can get Lindsay Lohan. David, how much is Lindsay Lohan tweet going for to shill our NFT?
00:52:44.186 - 00:52:57.010, Speaker B: Lindsay Lohan tweet? A shill tweet is $25,000. A retweet is $20,000, and then you can get a package deal for two tweets plus one retweet for $35,000. Ryan.
00:52:57.090 - 00:53:25.486, Speaker A: So something else that's going on is compound the lending and borrowing protocol. One of the kickstarters of DFI summer and the yield farming movement, they might actually ditch yield farming, no longer issue tokens to those supplying liquidity to the protocol. And this comes, I think, on the back of a down bad for comp token, right? Like it's been bleeding relative to dollars, but also bleeding relative to eth, everything.
00:53:25.588 - 00:53:27.486, Speaker B: Well, as all DeFI tokens have, all.
00:53:27.508 - 00:53:50.434, Speaker A: DeFi tokens have, but particularly the ones that are giving a lot of generous yield to those that are farming them, those that are basically providing liquidity to them, because that acts as a supply drain. Right. So what are yield farming farmers doing? They're taking their tokens, they're saying, thank you very much, and they're converting that to dollars or eth or bitcoin. They're just selling it.
00:53:50.472 - 00:53:51.530, Speaker B: Market fell.
00:53:51.710 - 00:54:04.106, Speaker A: So the holders of comp in the governance are saying, hey, this is not a sustainable strategy. Let's no longer do that. And there's some governance proposals in the work to stop yield farming from the originators of the yield farming movement. What do you think?
00:54:04.208 - 00:54:22.350, Speaker B: Yeah, it's nice to see one, it's nice to see the comp governance actually doing something. Comp hasn't done anything in a long time. Like, compound has just been the way that it is, which is why people appreciate it. Right. Generally considered rock solid. But also, you guys could have done this. You guys could have seen this coming forever ago.
00:54:22.350 - 00:54:40.114, Speaker B: Comp has been yield farmed to death for it. Kick started DeFi summer, and now it's killing the thing that it started like almost two years later. Yeah, I mean, when the token price is down, bad people are like, hey, let's stop issuing.
00:54:40.242 - 00:55:16.226, Speaker A: That's natural. They should, right? This is why these tokens need to be governed and the holders need to be economically incented, and they certainly are for token value appreciation. Some other people, like Teddy from notional finance, think it's a very bad idea saying that what will happen is your liquidity will dry up and your yields will dry up and people will stop using the compound protocol. Right. Like, what would happen is if you removed comp rewards, your interest rates on DAi would move from 2.7% to like 72%. Right.
00:55:16.226 - 00:55:24.260, Speaker A: And so are you going to be able to sustain the liquidity after the token rewards dry up? That's the big question.
00:55:24.710 - 00:55:43.818, Speaker B: Well, they should be able to, because as demand goes up, yields go up as well. And so is there enough dai to borrow? It's not like compound is an exchange that needs to have liquid markets. It just needs to have ample supply. And if more dai gets demanded out of the protocol, the yields do increase. So I'm not concerned about that.
00:55:43.904 - 00:56:02.970, Speaker A: Yeah, I do think all token communities start thinking more about their economics during the bear season, right? Ethereum is no different. Bitcoin is no different. They all do this. Let's talk about this, David. So crypto, as we talked about before, is funding military defense. Look at this. This is from Ukraine, I think these are, these vests.
00:56:03.050 - 00:56:20.742, Speaker B: These are. No, they're bulletproof plates. Yeah, so they flip into a vest. So it's just kind of nice to see the evidence of all the crypto donations. We're 200 sets of ballistic plates of class four class bulletproof vests. Don't know what that means, but I'm sure someone with military experience does. Yeah.
00:56:20.742 - 00:56:22.870, Speaker B: Crypto buying bulletproof vests, cool.
00:56:22.940 - 00:56:30.694, Speaker A: Crypto funding military defense, it's kind of cool. It's also a little dystopian, maybe. I don't know how I feel about it, but, yeah, it feels like.
00:56:30.732 - 00:56:31.320, Speaker B: Guys.
00:56:31.770 - 00:56:40.366, Speaker A: Yeah. Welcome to the 2020s. This is what we're doing now, guys. We will be back with the takes of the week, but before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible. Possible.
00:56:40.468 - 00:57:37.306, Speaker B: Ave is the leading decentralized liquidity protocol and now ave V three is here. Ave V three has powerful new features to enable you to get the most out of DFI, including isolation mode, which allows for many more markets to be launched with more exotic collateral types, and also efficiency mode, which allows for higher loan to value ratios and of course, portals, allowing users to port their AAvE position across all of the networks that AAvE operates on like Polygon, phantom, avalanche, arbitrum, optimism and harmony. The beautiful thing about AAVE is that it's completely open source, decentralized and governed by its community, enabling a truly bankless future for us all. To get your first cryptocolateralized loan, get started@ave.com. That's aave.com. And also check out the Ave protocol governance forums to see what more than 100,000 Dow members are all robbing about at governance ave.com. Living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys, and that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallet.
00:57:37.306 - 00:58:09.670, Speaker B: And brand new to the Ledger lineup of hardware wallets is the Ledger Nanos Plus, a huge upgrade to the world's most popular hardware wallet. With more memory and a larger screen, the Nanos plus makes it easy to navigate and verify your transactions. And the paired Ledger live desktop app gives you increased transparency as to what is about to happen with your NFT. What you see is what you sign. The Nanos plus gives you the smoothest possible user experience while you're doing all of your crypto things. So go to the Ledger website to check out the features of the new Ledger Nanos plus and join the waitlist to get yours. And don't forget about the crypto life card.
00:58:09.670 - 00:58:44.702, Speaker B: Also powered by Ledger, the CL card is a crypto debit card that hooks right into the ledger live app, right next to all the DFI apps and services that you're already used to doing, like swapping tokens and staking. So if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet, go to ledger.com, grab a ledger, and take control over your crypto. Arbitrum is an ethereum layer, two scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use DFI and NFTs. Over 300 projects have already deployed to Arbitrum, and the DFI and NFT ecosystems are growing rapidly. Some of the coolest and newest NFT collections have chosen Arbitrum as their home. All the while, Defi protocols continue to see increased usage and liquidity.
00:58:44.702 - 00:59:23.120, Speaker B: Using arbitrum has never been easier, especially with the ability to deposit directly into arbitrum through all the exchanges, including Binance, FTX, Huobi, and crypto.com. Once inside, you'll notice arbitrum increases ethereum speed by orders of magnitude for a fraction of the cost of the average gas fee. If you're a developer who wants low gas fees and instant transactions for your users, visit Arbitrum IO slash developer to start building your dap on Arbitrum. If you're a dgen, many of your favorite dapps on Ethereum are already on arbitrum, with many moving over every day. Go to bridge arbitrum IO now to start bridging over your eth and other tokens in order to experience defi Nfts in the way it was always meant to be. Fast, cheap, secure, and friction free.
00:59:23.730 - 00:59:29.154, Speaker A: All right, guys, we are back with the takes of the week. This is one from Lee Jin. Why don't you read this out? David? Yeah.
00:59:29.192 - 00:59:40.070, Speaker B: Lee Jin, previous podcast guest about the creator economy. She says, do things that make your friends and family worried about you, which I definitely appreciate it. What do you think she means, Ryan?
00:59:40.810 - 01:00:01.718, Speaker A: I think she's meaning her parents, her friends, her family were probably saying, are you sure you want to dive into crypto to this degree? Go all in. It seems risky. We're worried about you. Is everything okay? I don't know. What kind of reaction did you get from your family when you told them about your crypto shenanigans?
01:00:01.814 - 01:00:12.960, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, I kind of added that my own take down to her take right below it, you could see it. And I go, my mom about my career choices throughout 2018 to 2020. And she was like, well, he's happy.
01:00:15.490 - 01:00:17.266, Speaker A: Such a mom thing to say.
01:00:17.448 - 01:00:17.986, Speaker B: Amazing.
01:00:18.088 - 01:00:32.626, Speaker A: What does she think now, though? It's like 2021 2022 for me. My family had no idea what I was really doing. But then Mark Cuban came on the bankless podcast, and they were like, oh, is Mark, my God, Mark Cuban?
01:00:32.738 - 01:00:33.062, Speaker B: Right?
01:00:33.116 - 01:00:45.078, Speaker A: That was the name for them that really stuck out. I'm like, mark Cuban's cool. I like Mark Cuban. But like, we had Vitalik on. Okay, that should be a big deal to you. But no, they were unimpressed by Vitalik. Really excited about Mark Cuban.
01:00:45.174 - 01:00:53.626, Speaker B: For my family, it was Hester purse. My family's definitely political and engaged. My sister works in government, so having SEC commissioner Hester purse was like, a big deal.
01:00:53.728 - 01:00:54.630, Speaker A: Legitimacy.
01:00:54.710 - 01:01:01.870, Speaker B: Legitimacy, yeah. And then also Andrew Yang, because they knew I was a big yang fan. They're like, oh, yeah, Dave's climbing all the way up there. That's pretty cool.
01:01:02.020 - 01:01:09.870, Speaker A: Do you think your family was always before, like, Hester Purse came on the podcast? Like, I don't know what David's doing. It seems a little sketchy when you got an SEC commissioner.
01:01:09.950 - 01:01:23.430, Speaker B: Yeah, I definitely explained it to them. So, like, oh, Dave's doing what he really, really likes, but it was just like a normal job back then. And now it's like, yeah, the leading podcast in the crypto industry, which is a little different of a story.
01:01:23.580 - 01:01:46.058, Speaker A: Well, he's happy, he's happy, he's happy. Big smile on his face. That's awesome, man. Andrew Cronier, we talked about this in the beginning. Somebody who's not happy, he's not happy. Basically, a line from his medium post is, cryptoculture has strangled crypto ethos. So he went through this whole blog post called the rise and fall of cryptoculture.
01:01:46.058 - 01:02:09.654, Speaker A: Crypto is dead. Long live crypto. I think the TlDR of this post is basically, we need more regulation. I now more than ever see the need, he says, or even necessity for regulation, not as a mechanism to prevent, but as a mechanism to protect. It's like a child trying to stick their finger into the electric outlet. You stop them before they can learn why they shouldn't. One day, they will understand, but not today.
01:02:09.654 - 01:02:33.438, Speaker A: Andre, the father of many D five protocols and sort of, I guess, one of the main architects behind that ship, fast break things. Yeah, that's like, his strategy. Like, I test in prod. Remember, that was the line coming out of 2020, and now is saying we need tighter controls, more regulation, more oversight of this industry. What do you think?
01:02:33.604 - 01:02:55.698, Speaker B: This is ridiculous. Dude. He was the guy that incentivized this behavior. He became Andre Cronier because he gave the apes fuel. He gave the apes things to ape into. And now he's like, you know what? This industry needs less things for the apes to do. Like, dude, you're the reason why you're making the complaints in the first.
01:02:55.698 - 01:03:21.340, Speaker B: Like, it reminds me of the quick. There was this guy, I can't remember who it was, but the bit license in New York was made by this federal regulator or something and made the bit license, which made it very, very hard to actually spin up bitcoin or crypto company in New York. And you know what he did after that, Ryan, after he made the bit license, no, he started consulting for how to get approved for the bit.
01:03:22.510 - 01:03:24.722, Speaker A: Think Andre wants to become a regulator?
01:03:24.886 - 01:03:43.620, Speaker B: Well, I don't know, but first he's like, oh, dude, all of this ape culture is terrible. But he got rich off of ape culture. He got famous off of ape culture. He's got extremely well respected by his populist following because of ape culture. And I was like, well, I don't like ape culture because there needs to be regulations. They're too apey. It's like, dude, you created this.
01:03:45.190 - 01:03:52.118, Speaker A: Yeah. Testing and pride kind of does that to you. This is another take from a critic who I think shares some your points. You want to read this out?
01:03:52.204 - 01:04:12.540, Speaker B: Yeah. It goes, a man who makes nine to ten figures building multitudes of shitcoins and projects, thanks to crypto's lack of regulation, then quits the space, and now advocates for the biggest meme of all, investor protection and regulation. Welcome to the clown. That's. And this seems to be consensus by people that I've talked to.
01:04:13.150 - 01:04:39.926, Speaker A: I would like to actually talk to Andre at some point about this take and hear how he explains. It's actually been a while since he's been on the podcast, but maybe we'll just let this blow over for a bit and see what happens. David, you had another take about. Again, this is sort of about mfers, which I think mfers are really cool. These NFTs that work off of the creative common license. So anyone can create a derivative of them. Anyone can essentially fork them and create their own version of those.
01:04:39.926 - 01:05:06.526, Speaker A: And there was an airdrop to all MF holders at 420 on 420. All right, there's these awesome crazies. They're called MFRs that were just airdropped to everyone who has an MF, you just got it automatically. And there's, like, psychedelic derivative mfs that look pretty awesome. And you had a take about this. What's your take?
01:05:06.628 - 01:05:49.686, Speaker B: Yeah, I said MFRs are the new money printer because MFRs are like the Og of the Mfer ecosystem. But there's been thousands, what seems like thousands of derivatives, right? Some airdropped, some just randomly minted, some you get to claim if you have an MFEr. Some are completely different. But it reminded me of the era of bitcoin fork and fair launches, where people would fork off bitcoin and then make their own new blockchain using the bitcoin state. And if you had bitcoin, you had all of these new tokens, because it was a fork off of the bitcoin network. So if you had bitcoins, you had tokens on this new chain. And so bitcoin was the brand for bitcoin at the time, was bitcoin gets all the upside of all these derivatives.
01:05:49.718 - 01:05:54.682, Speaker A: Because you can always bitcoin, cash, bitcoin, diamond, bitcoin, Satoshi's vision, whatever else, right?
01:05:54.736 - 01:06:13.714, Speaker B: So if you sold all of your bitcoin forks, you would just get a lot more bitcoin. Right? And so I'm seeing the same thing play out because mfers are so easy to make. Derivatives of the OG Mfers are like the OG bitcoin, right? You get all the derivatives. Like, you just get the money printer. And so that was my take. Mfers are the new money printer, but for nfts this time, that's cool.
01:06:13.752 - 01:06:21.546, Speaker A: It's openness can be a competitive advantage and a competitive strategy. Certainly that's what creative common license provides for mfRs.
01:06:21.678 - 01:06:24.840, Speaker B: Also, I have a lot of mfRs, so this is me chilling my bag here.
01:06:25.370 - 01:06:33.834, Speaker A: Well, full disclosure there, then. I only have one, David. I should probably have more, but now I have some derivatives, too, man. Should we get into it? What are you excited about this week?
01:06:33.872 - 01:07:11.014, Speaker B: Well, Ryan, we still have all the rest of the week for Devconnect. So today there's some parties, tomorrow is going to be some even more parties. And then on Sunday, there's Ravi. So I'm excited to finish up DevConnect. But one thing I noticed is that during the layer two beat, the layer two Amsterdam two day summit of sorts, you could get a very hint of what's coming down the line during l two season. And then we kicked off the first dankrad opened up about a very well informed talk about what is left in the l layer two ecosystem to really, the boxes that need to be checked. Right, very good talk.
01:07:11.014 - 01:07:35.834, Speaker B: To get up to speed with layer twos. And then followed by Bartech from layer two beat, talking about his risk framework, saying, like, okay, we have upgradable contracts. That's something that needs to be fixed. We have centralized sequencers, like, over time, that needs to decentralize. And layer two B does a really good job of showing all the weaknesses and all the different l two s that need to be patched. And he used the arbitrum twelve hour sequencer downtime. That happened, like, last September.
01:07:35.882 - 01:07:36.766, Speaker A: As an example.
01:07:36.948 - 01:08:32.078, Speaker B: As an example. And actually, we reported on this, Ryan, like, oh, yeah, in layer twos, if they go down, you can just exit through the ethereum, l one, you can just exit through the main chain and yes, that is true in theory, about layer twos in their very mature state, but that wasn't true, Ryan, about arbitrum at the time, and a lot of people didn't actually know that. And so Bartech was talking about these, and this is what he's trying to get known by the ecosystem is there's a lot of lacking of standards and definitions that we can't really talk about, like what is true and what is not true without this risk frameworks. That's what Bartech is working on right now. But it got really spicy, Ryan, because he was talking about, yeah, little did people know you couldn't actually have gotten that l one transaction through. It wouldn't have worked because there's still a lot of gaps in the armor for these layer twos. But you could hear, I was sitting, the arbitrum team, and the arbitrum, I think this was, the CEO, unconfirmed, was sitting behind me, and you could hear them rumors, like, wait a second, that's not true.
01:08:32.078 - 01:08:55.478, Speaker B: That's not true. That's wrong. And then basically, they got really frustrated, and the arbitrum CEO, I think, said, just loudly said, that's not true, and made Bartech stumble and got really spicy in the room. Some tension. Some tension in the room. Right. And so then I went to a couple of the, after that talk wrapped up, I went to a couple of the l two teams and talked about that moment because they weren't there in the room.
01:08:55.478 - 01:09:04.054, Speaker B: And then we're like, well, actually, no, it actually was true. But the point is exactly like, the reason why we can't come to consensus on what's true or not is because we need definitions.
01:09:04.102 - 01:09:05.270, Speaker A: Precise definitions.
01:09:05.350 - 01:09:05.980, Speaker B: Exactly.
01:09:06.430 - 01:09:16.698, Speaker A: Arbitrum is right under their definition, and other teams are right under their definition. But I guess the takeaway here is you're saying the kids are fighting, they're.
01:09:16.714 - 01:09:28.162, Speaker B: Trying to clamor for legitimacy, and they're trying to clamor for just, they're clamoring. People are clamoring. And we got the hints of the optimism token coming soon, and so that's going to kick off.
01:09:28.216 - 01:10:07.102, Speaker A: You know, what tokens do is they just add steroids to everything you're doing. So if you have a little hint of tribalism, just a little hint of, like, our layer two is better than yours, which is only natural, right? They're all competitive environments. Add a token to that, and your tiny campfire becomes an inferno. And suddenly you have tokenized communities who just are just meme armies, like, shitting on all sorts of different communities and battles back and forth, and we get what we already have in the alt layer one world, which is all of these communities fighting with one another, and then people going shaking their heads and being like, why is crypto so tribal? It's because the incentives make us very tribal, don't they?
01:10:07.156 - 01:10:24.402, Speaker B: That's exactly right. That's exactly right. So for better or for worse, Ryan, this is coming, and competition is always good for the end user. So I think this is really going to accelerate the development of layer two s l two. Two is just around the corner. You can taste it. And Ryan, that is what I'm excited about.
01:10:24.536 - 01:11:06.894, Speaker A: Well, my position is kind of the, I want all the kids to get along, the whole family to get along. I want us all to scale decentralization, want us all to scale Ethereum. So I am excited about all of these various experiments. I think all of the layer two teams, almost all of them are just legit, like, passionate, doing this for the right reasons. Just fantastic. But it kind of reminds me, you know, we use the nation state analogy for, like, the united roll ups of Ethereum is kind of like the US and the states are the various roll ups, and Ethereum is kind of like the federal government. It's almost like California kind of wants to get in a fight with Texas a little bit and take like, yeah, biggie versus Tupac.
01:11:06.894 - 01:11:20.962, Speaker A: I don't know, north versus south, something like this. Florida versus Texas, California, I don't know. There's something like that, and I think that's coming, too. So we will, of course, have to navigate that. But just to tie off the conversation.
01:11:21.026 - 01:11:34.730, Speaker B: Wait, before we do, though, we all know the crypto industry runs on attention, and what is going to have more attention than a bunch of layer two fighting with each other? Like, bullish fighting? Bullish question fighting.
01:11:35.710 - 01:11:37.910, Speaker A: But I don't want to fight all the time, David.
01:11:37.990 - 01:11:40.618, Speaker B: Oh, it's coming, Ryan, it's coming.
01:11:40.704 - 01:11:49.722, Speaker A: Buckle up, guys. I just kind of thought maybe some of the l two s would just, I don't know, band together. The common mission.
01:11:49.866 - 01:11:57.246, Speaker B: They are going to be bridged together by the bridges. So at the end of the day, we're all one big ecosystem. At least we're not separate layer ones, Ryan.
01:11:57.358 - 01:12:14.118, Speaker A: We're all alignment. That's the worst alignment. All right, well, just to tie up Devconnect, then, what are your big takeaways from Devconnect? And we promised a little bit of alpha, your justin Drake conversation. So what did Drake tell you when merge, David? Yeah. So give us a date.
01:12:14.204 - 01:12:54.654, Speaker B: We were getting beers, right, and we were asking Justin this, and we were joking about, all right, we're going to put all of our empty beers in front of Justin and give him the last full beer, and then we're going to take a picture of Justin. And Justin says we're going to merge tomorrow. We ended up not doing that, obviously, but he said a few months. And so the consensus has shifted amongst a very small set of people at this table to sometime to August to October. August to October is the new shelling point of time question mark. But the core devs were all locked in a room together, kind of like how you got to lock all the politicians together if you needed them to come up with something. But they're doing a ton of progress.
01:12:54.654 - 01:13:14.138, Speaker B: They're doing all these ghost forks again, this is not some sort of, like, New York main net consensus, coindesk consensus conference. Shit is getting done right now at this conference, and you can actually see it. The Bartex talk for layer two is about. Here is the checkboxes that the layer twos need to get done. We need to work on this.
01:13:14.224 - 01:13:16.090, Speaker A: That same thing. I want to watch that talk.
01:13:16.160 - 01:13:33.534, Speaker B: Yeah, you got to watch. Yeah. I also had a fantastic talk with a lot of the core teams. Danny, Ryan, Dank, Rad, Preston, Van Loon, a few others. Really good talk as well. I'll try and find that and link that in the show notes as well. Just so much information being passed around.
01:13:33.534 - 01:13:52.680, Speaker B: So we're all syncing our nodes about what the state of the industry is in so we can progress forward again. The vibes in the co working space, the shelling point where everyone goes to hang out, which is where I'm going next after this, are just fantastic. I'm meeting a ton of new people, also seeing a ton of all my friends. Oh, it's just great, man.
01:13:53.050 - 01:13:56.246, Speaker A: That's awesome. How's Cisano doing?
01:13:56.428 - 01:14:04.106, Speaker B: Oh, Cisano is doing great. He led the layer two panel and, yeah, it's great to see him. Great to hang out.
01:14:04.208 - 01:14:06.234, Speaker A: That's awesome, man. Oh, very cool.
01:14:06.432 - 01:14:10.474, Speaker B: Good stuff. Progress gets made when it's the eth people all get together.
01:14:10.512 - 01:14:26.034, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of doubters on Twitter right now saying, yeah, you're just hedging and the merge is never going to happen. Or if it does happen, it's certainly not happening in 2022. So the only way you can quiet that is to actually ship the thing, do it. So I think we're getting close.
01:14:26.152 - 01:14:32.340, Speaker B: Yeah, Defconnect is a yearly thing, so I'm looking forward to doing this again next year. Ryan, what are you excited about, my man?
01:14:33.110 - 01:14:35.154, Speaker A: We just bought bankless.com. All right?
01:14:35.192 - 01:14:36.180, Speaker B: Yes, we did.
01:14:37.030 - 01:14:54.086, Speaker A: So last week it was the trademark. This week we got bankless.com. We'd been on the hunt for this for a while, and we found the person who was selling it, did a private transaction. So that is in the process of getting transfer. That's not my story, though. Okay. That's what's exciting.
01:14:54.086 - 01:15:22.450, Speaker A: But my story is about. Sometimes I like to torture myself. We still have to have a bank account for certain things. So when you buy a domain name, you have to transmit funds to an escrow service. Right? So it's all fiat. There's this service called escrow.com. So the only way, David, for us to get money from our fiat bank account, which, again, we have to have for certain things, I can't pay for this thing with USDC or ETH, for example, is to use our bank account.
01:15:22.450 - 01:15:43.354, Speaker A: And a couple years ago, actually, before, you know how, Vitalik started Ethereum, because the joke is his warlock. And wow, got nerfed. Okay. I partially started the bankless newsletter because I was pissed because bank of America shut down my bank accounts, my business bank accounts. All right. Like, true story. It's just, like, kicked me out.
01:15:43.354 - 01:15:59.978, Speaker A: Just received a dear John letter. Within 30 days, you and all of your assets have to go. Bye bye, see you later. And why? The reason was because I had a cryptocurrency transaction, a withdrawal from Coinbase to my bank of America account. Coinbase. And that flagged me. Oh, it must be shady.
01:15:59.978 - 01:16:07.818, Speaker A: So booting. So we've had, for bankless, we've had, like, a credit union, which are generally more friendly. Like, the Cannabis industry has experienced this.
01:16:07.924 - 01:16:09.550, Speaker B: Little banks instead of a big bank.
01:16:09.630 - 01:16:27.994, Speaker A: Tiny banks, right. They know their community managers, part of the community, and they don't have these big risk assessments. Anyway, we're trying to transfer funds, wire funds. I have to show up at the credit union in person, present my id. They ask me what I'm doing with the funds. Are you buying property? Yeah, after a fashion. Digital property.
01:16:27.994 - 01:17:05.860, Speaker A: It's a domain name. And got that process through. Anyway, what happened is the wire did not get transferred that day, and apparently this got escalated through the credit union because they looked up bankless and they saw that we were a crypto podcast in the crypto industry, and there were internal meetings, and it was deemed risky. And so, yeah, you're just hearing this because you've been in Amsterdam. So I had multiple conversations with bank managers at the credit union, trying to explain what we were doing. We're a podcast. We have a subscription service.
01:17:05.860 - 01:17:26.186, Speaker A: We're extremely legitimate. And they were like, but you're issuing a token. What's your token? I'm like, oh, you're talking about an NFT. Because if you are a bankless premium member, yes, there is a poap badge that you can get. It's an NFT. Are you familiar with what NFts were? And the guy I was talking to is just hilarious, right? Because he was like, oh, I'm totally down with just. I love it.
01:17:26.186 - 01:17:45.430, Speaker A: I just have to convince these guys, these other guys, right? Like this younger bank manager, I guess, having to talk to the three to five old guys in the office and convince them that they should not kick us out of our credit union bank. They should actually profit.
01:17:45.450 - 01:17:46.878, Speaker B: Oh, we almost got unbanked.
01:17:46.974 - 01:17:59.826, Speaker A: Oh, totally, dude. They were this close, right? This close to being flagged. Okay, that story, right? We're not being super persecuted.
01:17:59.858 - 01:18:00.054, Speaker B: Whatever.
01:18:00.092 - 01:18:34.980, Speaker A: We still have crypto rails. It's just kind of an inconvenience. It's annoying, but it reflects on me that if you have a money in a bank account, you don't actually own the money, right? You want to move that money out. Imagine this is what really happened. You ask five guys in suits in some office somewhere if you can move your own damn money. Please, sir, can I move my money from one place to another, please? Will you allow me to do it? No, because you're in the crypto industry or. No, because we don't like your political perspective or whatever it is, right.
01:18:34.980 - 01:19:00.486, Speaker A: So it just drives the point home that this is why we need to go bankless, David. We need the ability to exit the existing system, and we need the freedom to be able to move our funds from one place to another. That is a civil liberty for the digital era, for the 21st century. And if you have your money in an account, you don't have those liberties. You don't actually own your money in a bank account.
01:19:00.668 - 01:19:09.050, Speaker B: You know what the cherry on top of that story is that the escrow service that we were sending the money for could have just been a smart contract.
01:19:09.870 - 01:19:21.134, Speaker A: Totally, totally like, this could have been done like that. Smart contract. And if it's an ENS domain, boom, both parties deposit done, probably for less money, too.
01:19:21.332 - 01:19:29.682, Speaker B: Inside of 10 minutes, one gas fee. Like, no. Five dudes and ties need to take time out of their day in a building. I called building with.
01:19:29.736 - 01:19:39.098, Speaker A: I talked to three branch members. I had to go in person, like, say, hello, somebody paper filled out the wire transfer information, copying it from digital to. It's just so inefficient.
01:19:39.214 - 01:19:57.206, Speaker B: People consumed gas in their car to get to that building on that day. That's taking up space that could have been housing for people. You got to go bankless, right? People talk about how much energy bitcoin is consuming. What about all the unnecessary ridiculousness of the entire banking industry that could be automated?
01:19:57.318 - 01:20:14.222, Speaker A: They also talk about how crypto ux just sucks and has, like, yeah, sure, parts of it, but no, that ux sucks. I just trying to get money from one place to another, and I can't do it without talking to, like, five different people showing up in person, presenting my id, arguing my case, almost getting kicked out of my bank account.
01:20:14.276 - 01:20:14.794, Speaker B: That sucks.
01:20:14.842 - 01:20:16.010, Speaker A: That's bad ux.
01:20:16.170 - 01:20:49.546, Speaker B: So there was one time I had to make a wire transfer that was over the limit of, like, $15,000 or something, and I was not home. I was in San Francisco at the time, and I couldn't go into a Wells Fargo branch. And so I called them and say, hey, can we just ignore this $15,000 limit? Because it had to be done, like, that day, basically. And they're like, no, we can't do that. In order to do anything above $15,000, we need to send you, like, a PGP key or something, like one of those little USB authenticators. And I'm like, okay, but I need to do this a day, so it's not going to happen fast enough. A PGP key.
01:20:49.546 - 01:21:00.314, Speaker B: They wanted to send me a PGP key so I could usb it into my computer, so I could verify my identity. That's just a boomer hardware wallet.
01:21:00.442 - 01:21:03.662, Speaker A: I don't even understand. How do they know it's you who they're sending it to?
01:21:03.716 - 01:21:19.646, Speaker B: Because they would send it to my address, and then I would have it, and they could have, like, I don't know, but it's basically a private key they're asking me for. Have a hardware wallet, except it's a PGP key, like Google Auth and a USB. It's a hardware wallet. They just want me to have a hardware wallet with extra steps.
01:21:19.678 - 01:21:21.410, Speaker A: And it's worse than physically mailed to.
01:21:21.480 - 01:21:24.338, Speaker B: Yeah. Oh, it's so broken, dude. It's so broken.
01:21:24.434 - 01:21:38.906, Speaker A: It is broken. But you got to use the banking system every once in a while to see how far we're coming and to, like, it always reestablishes the crypto vision for me. I'm like, oh, yeah, this does suck. Don't give me crap and tell me, like, tradfi is fine as is, right? Dead end.
01:21:38.928 - 01:21:44.480, Speaker B: Yeah, crypto UX definitely has room to improve, but at least you get to do it from the comfort of your own home.
01:21:45.730 - 01:21:56.846, Speaker A: Anyway, we're not kicked out of the bank account. Good news is they didn't kick us. They finally processed the wire. Maybe they listened to a bankless podcast in the process. I don't know. They definitely looked us up. So we still have our credit union.
01:21:56.846 - 01:22:00.738, Speaker A: So we're on the path to going bankless, but we still got that credit union for now.
01:22:00.824 - 01:22:01.186, Speaker B: Thank you.
01:22:01.208 - 01:22:01.970, Speaker A: Congratulations.

01:22:24.990 - 01:22:42.640, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. Okay, so this is a little bit of a deep cut, but for those that remember the constitution Dow, this is a Brooke Lampey who was on team Constitution Dao when we were submitting our bids to buy the constitution. And it goes breaking. Musk retained services of Brooke Lampey from Sotheby's to lead Twitter deal.
01:22:45.830 - 01:22:52.510, Speaker A: She was actually taking the calls. Right. And this was constitution Dow versus what's his name? Ken Griffin.
01:22:52.590 - 01:22:55.554, Speaker B: Yeah, she represented constitution Dow in the. Yeah, yeah.
01:22:55.592 - 01:23:04.438, Speaker A: And Ken Griffin ended up winning. So yeah, she's become a crypto meme. And have you been following the Musk thing, acquisition of Twitter more this week?
01:23:04.524 - 01:23:05.638, Speaker B: A little bit, but not really.
01:23:05.724 - 01:23:22.806, Speaker A: It's kind of fun. It's like there's poison pills and there's back and forth with Musk and what's he going to do? Anyway, it's a fun story, guys.
