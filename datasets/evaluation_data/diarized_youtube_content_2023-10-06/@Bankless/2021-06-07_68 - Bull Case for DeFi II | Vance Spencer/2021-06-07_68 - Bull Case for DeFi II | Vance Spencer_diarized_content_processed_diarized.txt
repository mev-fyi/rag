00:00:07.930 - 00:00:38.058, Speaker A: Welcome to Bankless, where we explore the frontier of Internet money and Internet finance. This is how to get started, how to get better, and how to front run the opportunity. I'm Ryan Sean Adams. I'm here with David Hoffman, and we're here to help you become more bankless. David, I know I say this at the front of every episode, how to front run the opportunity. It's literally what we say in the intro every single time. I feel like this episode truly is front running the opportunity.
00:00:38.058 - 00:01:14.606, Speaker A: I know that because if you listen to episode number 28 with our guest Van Spencer, that was truly a time to front run the opportunity in DFI and ETh. If you listened to him even earlier, it would have been even better. And now, here again is a fantastic episode and an opportunity for Bankless listeners, those who are about that life, the crypto natives in this space, to get ahead of the massive, monumental shift that is happening in the global money system. Super exciting, man. I love this episode.
00:01:14.798 - 00:01:54.926, Speaker B: Yeah. We are bringing Van Spencer back onto the podcast, more or less because he got things right. We had him on it nine months ago, episode 28, the Bull case for DFI. It was one of Bankless's really big, first big episodes. And Van Spencer, he held the number one spot for the most downloaded episode for, I think, the longest time in Bankless podcast history. People really like that episode, and basically because he predicted everything that he said more or less came true or is in the process of becoming true. So we're bringing him on nine months later to get an update as to how his mental models have updated, where he's shifted, where his focus is now.
00:01:54.926 - 00:02:33.510, Speaker B: Because if you talk to one person who got it right one time, he's probably going to get it right again. And overall, Vance, you can tell Van Spencer comes from a place of first principles, and he has a very thesis driven mentality about the space. And that's why he can talk a little bit about everything, right? We talked about d five, we talked about dows, we talked about l two s, we talked about enterprise blockchain and roll ups and Mev. And he's got a take for everything. And every single thing is interesting. And so we wanted to bring advance back on the podcast to give him another shot to get an episode back into the number one downloaded episode of the Bankless podcast.
00:02:33.590 - 00:02:34.294, Speaker C: That's a little harder.
00:02:34.342 - 00:03:05.218, Speaker B: It's been overtaken by Vitalik and Justin Drake and a few others, and it is a little bit harder these days, but I think he can do it. And guys, if you like Vance Spencer and you like talking about DeFi. We are also bringing Vance back on to a panel an ask me anything panel this coming Wednesday. So this podcast is coming out on Monday. Maybe you're listening to it on Monday or Tuesday. We have Vance Spencer, Spencer Noon and Santiago Santos on a DFI eating the banks panel this Wednesday at 01:00 p.m. At PST.
00:03:05.218 - 00:03:22.620, Speaker B: So mark that on your calendars, we are going to put Vance in with the other big brain DFI thinkers and just talk about what it means to be a part of DeFi. And do we really even need banks anymore these days? And so, you know, make sure you watch that when it comes time.
00:03:23.470 - 00:03:49.030, Speaker A: That's going to be on YouTube. So go to bankless YouTube and find that I think you should be able to set a reminder for that event. We'll have in the show notes and there'll be an event. I mean, look, the big monumental shift this time. Last time we had Vance on, it was all about DeFi tokenization and DeFi Summer. I feel like this time it's all about layer two. Layer two is going to be absolutely massive for crypto in this space.
00:03:49.030 - 00:04:34.706, Speaker A: And so we spent a lot of time unpacking what layer two actually means and playing that out in real time, what it means for other competing eth killer layer ones, what it means for users in the space, what it unlocks as far as new applications. So the focus is really on layer two, and trying to play that out is where you're going to find the opportunities. And Vance said some things that are kind of contrarian. When's the last time you heard someone talk about in DeFi enterprise blockchain, right? Or like, the verticalization, the fintech layer of like, these are some topics that seem controversial at the time and don't seem to fit at the time. But I remember thinking the fact that.
00:04:34.728 - 00:04:38.914, Speaker B: They'Re coming out of left field means that Vance is paying attention to them for some reason.
00:04:39.032 - 00:05:01.466, Speaker A: It's interesting because I remember thinking about that at the time when he was bullish in 2017, 2018 in particular, 2018 on chain link. Right. And at a time when all tokens were kind of dead or dying, and that turned into a really good call. Also synthetics. Anyway, listen to this podcast. Listen to this episode. Definitely a way to front run the opportunity that is coming.
00:05:01.466 - 00:05:07.870, Speaker A: We want to thank the sponsors that made this bankless episode possible before we get into it. Here they are.
00:05:07.940 - 00:05:43.526, Speaker D: Bankless is proud to be supported by Uniswap. Uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans. Uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on Ethereum, which is what Ryan and I call a money robot. No human counterparties or centralized intermediaries, just autonomous code on ethereum. Input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy. Something brand new in the Uniswap ecosystem is the Uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants. We have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again.
00:05:43.526 - 00:06:11.602, Speaker D: Daos have money and they are in need of labor. If you think that you have something to contribute to the Uniswap Dow, apply for a grant to Uniswap. Just look at the size of the Uniswap treasury. It's almost $3 billion. This mountain of capital is looking for labor. Do you have something of value to contribute to the Uniswap Dow no matter how big or small your idea is, you can apply for a Uni grant@unigrants.org and help steer Uniswap in the direction that you think it should go.
00:06:11.602 - 00:07:14.930, Speaker D: That's exactly what we did to get Uniswap to be a sponsor for bankless, and you can do the same for your project. Thank you Uniswap for sponsoring bankless Ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on Ethereum and just recently released Ave version two, which has a ton of cool new features that makes using Ave even more powerful. With Ave, you can leverage the full power of DFI money, legos, yield and composability all in one application. On Ave, there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield, and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol. If you have deposited collateral here, you can see me getting a 200 USDC loan against my portfolio of a number of different DFI tokens and ETH. I'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option, but I could choose the stable interest rate option if I wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently. One of Ave's v two features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets, trade them on uniswap, and then deposit them back into Ave.
00:07:14.930 - 00:07:27.930, Speaker D: Ave does all of this for you, all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them. Check out the power of Ave@ave.com that's aave.com.
00:07:28.080 - 00:08:02.354, Speaker A: Okay, bankless nation. We are super excited to have Vance Spencer back on the program. Vance is the co founder of Framework Ventures. Framework and Vance have been really pioneers in establishing a crypto native venture fund. That's why we had him on the first time back in August. He's got these incredible methods of discovering Alpha, particularly in DFI, and applying a really unique investment thesis. I think the thesis is getting active in protocols, actually using them, investing in crypto native founders.
00:08:02.354 - 00:08:14.806, Speaker A: We did this monster episode with Vance back in August of 2020. It's episode number 28 if you want to go back and listen to it. I recently listened to it. Well worth it holds up, guys. It's one of the episodes.
00:08:14.838 - 00:08:19.766, Speaker B: It was our number one episode for a really long time. It was like our first gangbuster episode.
00:08:19.878 - 00:08:39.218, Speaker A: And I remember saying after this episode, like, just tweeting, like, 90 minutes of listening, but you got $1 million worth of value, at least depending on what you did with the knowledge. So we've got to bring Vance back for an update. It's been nine months later. Vance, welcome back to bankless. How are you doing, sir?
00:08:39.384 - 00:08:42.194, Speaker C: Doing great. Yeah, it's been too long. Thanks for having me back.
00:08:42.312 - 00:08:46.446, Speaker A: What have you been up to, man? I know you haven't been busy at all. Just chilling.
00:08:46.638 - 00:09:16.330, Speaker C: What have I been up know? Raised the second fund for framework. Kind of saw the thesis gradually play out in the first fund. Have kind of doubled down on being super active, just being kind of on chain in all shapes and forms, and just being good stewards of the protocols that we support and just trying to push the space forward. But through the pandemic, DeFi really didn't take a break or stop at all. And so it's been nonstop for almost since we last spoke.
00:09:16.410 - 00:09:31.140, Speaker A: Are you feeling like things have accelerated even more since we last spoke? Because we were just coming off of DFI summer. We're at, like the tail end of it. We didn't know at the time, but August 2020 was sort of the tail end of what we now call DFI summer. Have things accelerated since then?
00:09:32.150 - 00:10:15.466, Speaker C: Definitely. I would say the progress in DFI and crypto is not super linear. We kind of progress to the point where we kind of bump up against either the limitations of base layers or kind of the infrastructure or the tooling or even kind of the level of developer talent in the space. But it feels like we've had kind of that expansion from DeFi summer. We had a little bit of a DeFi winter. We kind of even led the way forward with more TVL things like derivatives, things like layer twos that are now kind of coming to fruition. And it feels like we're now kind of about to realize that next step change in terms of just usability and functionality and just usefulness as these things launch like arbitram and optimism and ZK sync.
00:10:15.466 - 00:10:19.922, Speaker C: So it feels like we're about to enter another exponential period of growth for the space.
00:10:20.056 - 00:11:02.302, Speaker A: Okay, Vance, so we're going to ask you about that second exponential period of growth because at the end of the August 2020 episode, we asked for your predictions, and you're one of the few guests who's just like, yes, here are my predictions. Like, no hedging. These are the numbers. Anyway, I want to just recap for folks who haven't listened to that. But basically at the time, this is August 2020 at the time we asked, hey, Vance, during the next bull cycle, which we think we're entering into the next 24 months, what's the total locked value of DFI going to look like? At the time it was 8 billion something like that. Total locked billion. You said it was going to hit 100 to 500 billion total locked value.
00:11:02.302 - 00:11:29.618, Speaker A: And I think David and my head almost exploded when you said that. But here we are less than a year later and we're at 88 billion total locked value. So like creeping up to your bottom bound 100 billion. And you also said ETH and bitcoin might get into the trillions. Trillions, plural. ETH was at 40 billion when we recorded that. It's gotten as high as 480,000,000,000.
00:11:29.618 - 00:11:53.426, Speaker A: So a nice little ten x there. Not quite the trillions. Bitcoin did hit trillion dollar bitcoin. So we hit like 1.1 trillion or so. At the time, bitcoin was 200 billion. So we're getting close to your estimates, Vance, which seemed pretty heady, I would say seemed pretty incredible nine months ago, maybe not so incredible now.
00:11:53.426 - 00:12:19.654, Speaker A: And I say all this to, I guess maybe tee up your credibility that you're not afraid to make big, bold predictions and to invest with conviction on those predictions. But I also say this because I want you to be ready, Vance. At the end of this episode, we're going to ask you those same questions. We want more predictions, give us more predictions. So I want you to be ready for the predictions at the end. Don't give them know. Let's build the suspense.
00:12:19.654 - 00:12:23.722, Speaker A: Let's talk about some deeper topics. But be ready, sir. You're going to be ready?
00:12:23.856 - 00:12:25.162, Speaker C: I'm ready, of course.
00:12:25.296 - 00:13:02.360, Speaker A: All right. Well, let's talk first about this drawdown because recently there have been eleven days in May where we saw 60%, some odd drawdown, 70% plus in some DFI assets, 66%, I think, maybe more. Down in ETH, bitcoin has been slumping. Some people are saying this is the end of the bull run, so we might not hit those heady predictions that you were thinking of earlier. So what's your take on that? Is this the end of the bull run? Is this a pause, or are we doing something else here?
00:13:04.570 - 00:13:31.870, Speaker E: I don't think it's the end of the bull run at all. I kind of have trouble defining what a bull run is in crypto. I think there's a bull run kind of at any given time, in any place. Bitcoin has probably a ten or 20 year adoption cycle that it's going to live through, but it's already a good way through that story. Ethereum is just the beginning, and there's going to be these periods of volatility and drawdowns. But the story on a longer time frame is just that. Adoption is increasing.
00:13:31.870 - 00:14:36.782, Speaker E: Institutional financial places are able to actually use and custody this stuff, and Wall street and basically all institutional allocators are now considering this a real asset class. And so saying that the bull run over doesn't really take those things into kind of mind. And the thing that we learned kind of going out and raising for our second fund was that there's probably, we're underestimating by one to two orders of magnitude the amount of capital that's on the sidelines, that's waiting to come off and into some productive and interesting assets. And it kind of just depends on how far away are they from being convinced of your given asset or whatever you prefer to allocate to. And I think the reality is that bitcoin is amazing in times where things are really pessimistic, when the world seems to be going to shit. But not that many people own gold, that are institutional investors. The people who have gotten rich over the past 20 years have gotten rich allocating to venture funds, buying the dip on technology stocks, looking at productive assets that have a high growth rate in a large tam.
00:14:36.782 - 00:15:01.646, Speaker E: And those things just look and feel like Ethereum, and they look and feel like DeFi. And so when people say the bull runs like, I just kind of feel like they spend too much time on Twitter and not talking to people. And I'm fully aware that people don't have the privilege of talking to these large institutional allocators, but those people are very bullish, and it's just about kind of form fitting the story of Ethereum and the form fitting of the story of Defi to kind of what they want.
00:15:01.748 - 00:15:17.410, Speaker A: Would you say that people have gotten rich on wealthy, on optimism rather than pessimism historically? And do you draw that distinction between sort of the bitcoin investment thesis and maybe the Ethereum defi investment thesis? One is optimistic, the other is pessimistic.
00:15:17.990 - 00:15:44.342, Speaker E: I think it would have been very hard to analyze Ethereum through a cynical lens. Same with Defi. You just have to be optimistic when you look towards the future. And I think that's one of the principles that we have. A framework is just like being a perpetual optimist, believing in what you're doing. That is a force multiplier when you kind of extend that across multiple projects or investments or even things that you're doing generally. And so we always kind of strive to take that forward looking, optimistic approach.
00:15:44.342 - 00:16:24.200, Speaker E: But I think the converse can be said about bitcoin in a lot of ways. It's a hedge for the worst of times. It's largely a finished product that has no endogenous catalysts on the roadmap. Really, everything that's happening to bitcoin right now, in my view, and this is a little bit biased, is people waiting for exogenous catalysts, people coming off the sidelines and allocating to bitcoin. And for us, it's just a little bit difficult to kind of see something as a roadmap and a future and catalyst and pick bitcoin over that. And I think a lot of institutional allocators are realizing the same. And if you look at the BTC ratio, it's almost tripled in the past, I think six months.
00:16:24.200 - 00:16:40.266, Speaker E: And it's easy to kind of be in the space, and to think that because bitcoin is consensus within the space, other people will realize that. But not everyone else is coming in with the same set of shared values and context as those early kind of libertarian leaning people.
00:16:40.368 - 00:16:41.274, Speaker C: A lot of people want to see.
00:16:41.312 - 00:16:46.014, Speaker E: Something that looks and feels like traditional technology. And I think that's very much where.
00:16:46.052 - 00:16:46.986, Speaker C: The world is heading.
00:16:47.098 - 00:16:52.094, Speaker A: See, David, it's okay that we're optimistic. Permeables. It's fine. Vance, that's fine. Yeah.
00:16:52.132 - 00:17:49.380, Speaker B: Vance, I want to actually dig in on this subject, and this is actually something that. Not something that we had in the agenda, but it's intrinsically interesting to me and I think for the listeners as well, because we've had some back and forth with some bitcoiners lately about the whole ETH BTC debate. Right. And I can't remember who said this, but they said something along the lines of like it's really baked into your genetics. What side you fall on? Do you fall on the Ethereum defi side or do you fall on the bitcoin side? And some people just, they find resonance with one side or the other and that's where they call home. How do you see with you and how you invest at framework and the culture that you've created at framework? How does your personal disposition direct what you choose to focus on and how you choose to invest? And how do you think that becomes also true for other venture investments and speculators in this space as well?
00:17:50.310 - 00:18:18.058, Speaker E: Yeah, so framework has never invested in bitcoin and I just don't think that's in our mandate. We're a venture fund that invests in founders at the earliest stages. And that's really kind of what we'd like to do at the end of the day is invest in people. There's a lot of meat on the bone when you look at DeFi, whether it's the kind of primitives or the aggregators or just the different kind of consumer applications that people are building on top of it, and it's inspiring to.
00:18:18.064 - 00:18:19.100, Speaker C: Work with those people.
00:18:20.110 - 00:19:10.710, Speaker E: There is an ecosystem around bitcoin, albeit a lot smaller. It's concentrated around the lightning network. It's concentrated around basically different forms of hyperbitcoinization for developing countries. And I think kind of what I've been seeing is that stablecoins are really taking a lot of wind out of that sale, depending on how you think of the US dollar or bitcoin's kind of short value properties. The evidence is relatively clear in these developing countries that people are choosing stablecoins over bitcoin just because it's a little bit more functional and things trend towards utility over time. And that's kind of where we kind of seek to play. And I think any potential flipping will be bullish long term for both bitcoin and think, you know, bitcoin is burdened by the expectations of having to carry the entire space, which props to bitcoin.
00:19:10.710 - 00:19:33.490, Speaker E: It's fulfilled over time. There were times where we needed the coherent narrative of bitcoin to tie the space together through the bear market. Even though Ethereum was building, it was kind of an open question as to whether ETH would be a real project a couple of years down the road. But bitcoin really did hold the space together and now it feels like just as this number one asset, it has the burden of expectation of doing basically.
00:19:33.560 - 00:19:35.666, Speaker C: Everything, being technology, being money, being all.
00:19:35.688 - 00:19:43.958, Speaker E: These things to everyone. And if there is a flipping and ETH proves to be just this massive technology layer, bitcoin can settle into a.
00:19:43.964 - 00:19:45.746, Speaker C: Bit of a more comfortable, albeit smaller.
00:19:45.778 - 00:20:10.830, Speaker E: Tam as just being digital gold. And I think that's a perfectly amazing outcome for all the bitcoiners out there because it's still a gigantic market and there's still probably ten to 100 x upside, but it's not going to be the end all, be all, and that's totally fine. And getting past that event horizon, I think getting past the fear will be really bullish for bitcoin itself. I think the community will become a lot less striking. That'd be how I would put it, angry.
00:20:11.810 - 00:21:00.254, Speaker B: Let's get back to the conversation of market dynamics, and I want to get your take on this as well. Vance. People have speculated that as we quote unquote, go mainstream as an industry, the way that these markets are structured and the way that these markets play out is also going to change. No longer will we have four year long boom and bust cycles where the peaks are really high and the troughs are really low. There are some speculate about the nature of a super cycle where we never actually get a deep, prolonged bear market, and instead we kind of just rebound over and over and over again and stairstep our way up to the top. There's other speculations that we just have the same boom and bust cycles, but they're smaller and quicker. Where we hit blow off top sooner, we do a bounce quicker, and then we just also keep on going.
00:21:00.254 - 00:21:15.010, Speaker B: And how do you expect these market dynamics to change from what people are expecting or previously expecting, which is these four year long mega cycles versus where do you think this is going now that we've kind of hit like this mainstream adoption? How do you see these markets changing.
00:21:18.330 - 00:21:31.218, Speaker E: Generally? I have the pleasure of thinking on longer timescales just because we run ten year funds. So my perspective is basically like, we're going to invest in these things and I'll call you in a decade, I'll.
00:21:31.234 - 00:21:32.460, Speaker C: Let you know how we did.
00:21:33.070 - 00:22:19.266, Speaker E: And fortunately, with a lot of asset class, you can tell early there is liquidity. You can understand how the markets are working, if the technology is valuable. But I think over the longest time horizon, the math is just very clear on our side. There's a generational preference for digital versus physical. Largely digital assets in and of themselves are a phenomenon that is in the under 30 cohort which will become the majority population cohort in the next five years. Those types of statistics just mean that the financial gravity of these generations maturing is just on our side, and their preference will manifest in the prices of assets that they like going up. And it's both because they like them, and it's also because on a lot of them, they're fundamentally productive.
00:22:19.266 - 00:22:21.306, Speaker E: And so while I still do see.
00:22:21.328 - 00:22:22.998, Speaker C: The case for boom and bust cycles.
00:22:23.014 - 00:23:16.474, Speaker E: For things that are more store value esque, because they tend to trade around these kind of credit cycles, things that are productive, it just feels like there's really kind of no stopping the growth because it's a lot of reflexivity. There's more tbl, there's more fees, the things are more productive, they're more useful. There's more capital to bootstrap projects in the ecosystem that will really never go away once that flywheel is spinning fast enough. And I think we've now kind of reached that escape velocity. Does that mean there won't be 60 or 70% drawdowns? I don't really know. I mean, there was one two weeks ago. But I think the thing about drawdowns is when you lose money and things aren't going exactly how you planned, you can kind of dig the hole as arbitrarily deep as you want it kind of emotionally, or however, you're kind of choosing to respond to the situation.
00:23:16.474 - 00:23:47.978, Speaker E: But as long as you kind of have good assets, and you understand thesis and you're willing to wait long enough, there really is no cause for concern. And I think the amazing thing about this space, specifically defi, is that you're able to delay things like tax liabilities. You're able to borrow against your assets. The actual functionality and utility is baked into this asset class, which doesn't put a lot of the same pressure on things like traditional stocks or commodities or even bitcoin. So when in doubt, zoom out is kind of my personal mantra. And I think good advice.
00:23:48.094 - 00:24:53.820, Speaker A: It is so funny. Like, once you cross the bridge from the legacy bank system to this new DFI ecosystem, you don't tend to cross it back the other way, right? So even if you sell your crypto native assets, what are you selling to stablecoins? Am I going to sell back to my Wells Fargo bucks and earn like 0.1% in a savings account? No, of course not. So, to your point, it's staying in the DeFi economy and the crypto economy for the utility of. So part of me is optimistic on everything you just said, vance, but also part of me feels like, my God, though, it does feel like crypto investors. Maybe I'll just name retail haven't actually gotten smarter versus 2017. Maybe it's a new crop because we're still pumping doggy coins, aren't we? What's up with that? Is that a counterargument to our DFI is going mainstream? People are understanding this asset class argument, or what would you say?
00:24:56.270 - 00:25:28.818, Speaker E: I'm very much a fan of people doing what they want with their money, and I don't think ethereums get to have it both ways. Or frankly, anybody in crypto where they preach economic freedom, but only in the subset of assets or things that they like and consider valuable. That doesn't mean that I don't think that dogecoin is basically financial napalm and that a lot of these guys will get torched. But I came from a technology job where I was just speculating on these assets in my free time, and if anybody had told me that I couldn't do that, I kind of would have.
00:25:28.824 - 00:25:29.778, Speaker C: Just laughed at them.
00:25:29.864 - 00:26:09.486, Speaker E: And I think that's kind of the same response that we get from a lot of people that want to trade things like dogecoin or shiba or really whatever the coin is, is that they're just kind of expressing their own personal preference and they're using things like uniswap to do it. And so anything that gets them on board and interested is a win in my book. Do I think these things are really good long term investments? I don't, but everyone has a right to speculate. And I think generally I am on board with things like accredited investor rules and things like that. But the history of the US at least is rife with. We're really good at speculation. That is one of the core tenets of what we do economically other than just kind of labor.
00:26:09.486 - 00:26:27.880, Speaker E: And I like to see that that is back in the markets, albeit it's a little bit frothy, but it's a step in the right direction towards getting people another kind of economic leg to hold up their kind of stool. So I'm actually pretty bullish on the fact that that's happening, and it just brings more attention to crypto as well. So it's not all bad.
00:26:28.970 - 00:27:06.710, Speaker B: Vance, I want to hang on the 60% drawdown that we had recently, because I think there's some lessons that we could parse out from there. DFI kind of took it like a champ. We had cascading liquidations like left and right, arguably the spike all the way down from below $2,200 ether down to $1,700. Ether was really just liquidity just drying up as people had to get liquidated. But then buyers did step in. Stablecoins stayed relatively close to their peg. What lessons can we draw from this 60% drawdown about where DFi is in its level of maturity?
00:27:07.610 - 00:27:47.134, Speaker C: Yeah, I would give different grades to different parts of DeFi. I think base layer DeFi did really well. The gas prices increased as the volatility got worse and worse, and that primarily acted as a decelerant to the moves. Anyone with under x or y amount of eth or capital really couldn't do anything. And we run a lot of kind of market making operations to just basically keep markets in line, both across spot and derivatives exchanges in DeFi. And that allowed us to really kind of have some room to maneuver and stabilize the markets that we were in. So that was really positive.
00:27:47.182 - 00:27:48.514, Speaker E: The things that I didn't really like.
00:27:48.552 - 00:28:33.566, Speaker C: Seeing were people who had created a loan on layer one on maker Ave, withdrawn it to polygon, and were getting closer to their collateralization ratio being liquidated, and they couldn't get back over the polygon bridge. That was kind of like just something that happened that didn't really feel right. And so I think the learning there is that things like the virtual dive bridge and things like the polygon bridge just need to be just less idiosyncratic. They need to be more generalized. People need to understand them better, and they can't just go down for 3 hours in the midst of a collapse. So I think that was a negative. At the same time finance futures went down, I think FTX was down for a little bit as well.
00:28:33.566 - 00:29:06.380, Speaker C: So I think those exchanges actually fared worse than DFI. But, yeah, I mean, overall, a 70%, 60% drawdown in a period of two days is about as bad as you will get. Almost by any measure, the amount of liquidations, the total amount of capital that was liquidated in DeFi as well, you really don't get much worse than that. And to see DeFi actually thrive, actually, you know, during the incident, compared to last year, where pretty much everyone just got worked, it was definitely positive to see.
00:29:07.070 - 00:30:10.560, Speaker B: The other concern that I have is it's great that DeFi held up and everything continued to chug on as normal, especially when we have the COVID march crash that happened maybe a year and a couple of months beforehand, to really compare and contrast, like, what DeFi was like then versus what DeFi was like now. And so that's a great learning lesson. But at some point, institutions, or just people at large, don't like assets that fall 60% in a day. Doesn't really matter how fast it climbed, falling 60%. No one wants to see that. Did that event spook people and scare people away? Is this something that we have to come to terms with as an asset class, that we are just going to have these just massive periods of volatility where just the numbers next to our assets could be any different number the next day? Did we spook institutions away? Did this scare etfs away? What are your opinions about just how the world is going to be able to stomach these massive drawdowns and if it's actually headwinds to this asset class?
00:30:12.210 - 00:30:18.514, Speaker C: I think that institutions who started down this path, call it six months ago.
00:30:18.632 - 00:30:20.786, Speaker E: With the Elon purchase, or even the.
00:30:20.808 - 00:30:56.190, Speaker C: Kind of later sailor purchases. They've now gone through investment committee, they've gone to their board, they've maybe edited their mandate to allow them to invest in crypto assets. Because this is such an esoteric asset class that has implications across custody, across. Is it taxed as property or is it taxed as stock? There's so many different things. People had to do legwork to get into this asset class, and so that work has just compounded over time. And now those institutions are kind of finally on the finishing line and ready to allocate. And things like this don't really dissuade them.
00:30:56.190 - 00:31:48.158, Speaker C: If anything, it makes them more bullish. It's hard to buy an asset that's up five x six x, like bitcoin was at the very top, because just the chance it goes down is pretty high. And these are all just people working at these endowments and pension funds and institutions, and they don't want that. But buying it 50, 60% off the highs, while you may not have that same euphoria and excitement about the asset class, ods are, that's probably a better entry point. And there's something that's strange about human nature, where the more something goes up, the more confident you get, and the more euphoric you get, and the more something goes down, it's like the more you hate the asset, you're trying to fight yourself to not sell it. And you just kind of have to realize that those are things that you should generally counter trade. And at the highest levels of professional investing, those people are paid and trained to do that.
00:31:48.158 - 00:32:32.666, Speaker C: And so this does not dissuade them at all. I think the more damaging thing is potentially these ESG concerns about bitcoin. But every Fortune 500 company has gone through this ESG cycle where there's been a guy or there's too much pollution, or they poison the environment somehow and they fire the guy, they buy the carbon credits, they remake the program, and generally they spin it as a bullish catalyst. Now with improved corporate governance and environmental costs has been dropped. And that is something that even as I got off the plane in Miami two days ago, I saw someone offering carbon neutral bitcoins that I could buy. And so this thing is already happening. People are already spinning up narratives to counteract it, and it still hasn't really dissuaded anybody.
00:32:32.848 - 00:33:23.182, Speaker A: I think there's something to making the case that volatility is a feature of free markets and not a bug. And free markets, as you said, when we're talking about doggy coins, we can't dictate what people decide to value and what they decide to buy. Right? It's just sort of a feature of free markets. But I'm curious to dig more into your ESG thoughts. Right, so that is definitely a narrative that has taken hold recently, and it's primarily in kind of like bitcoiner circles, right? Obviously. And now I feel like Ethereum can't really say too much because, look, it's still on proof of work and has been for the last five years. But if the roadmap plays out how the Ethereum community anticipates in nine months or so, that could no longer be the case.
00:33:23.182 - 00:33:57.160, Speaker A: Right? Transition fully to proof of stake. What do you think that does to the narrative? Because when I've looked at mainstream headlines, I just see the. It's still a focus on bitcoin, proof of work, consumption. There's really no recognition or knowledge that something like proof of stake could be coming, at least for Ethereum. 99.9% reduction in energy cost. Do you think that narrative will be a big one for institutions, or do you think this is just like short term noise and over the long run, none of it will really matter.
00:33:58.410 - 00:35:02.118, Speaker C: I think that'll stratify the space even more than we've seen historically when the two biggest assets are in kind of diametrically opposed sides of the spectrum in terms of proof of work or proof of stake. And it'll also, and this is a little bit of a reach, I think Ethereum maps very clearly to more liberal values. ESG solved by proof of stake. Maybe staking becomes some form of UBI where we can all stake our piece of Ethereum and you're getting some sort of check of money every month or week or so. It's an open development platform that really espouses the values of transparency and auditability and composability that's open to anyone. And you look at bitcoin and the main values that it espouses to me looking at it are strong property rights and just basically a lot of historical context via this proof of work mining scheme that has expended a ton of energy, which kind of, again, maps closer to the right side of the spectrum.
00:35:02.134 - 00:35:03.358, Speaker E: And so I do see that there.
00:35:03.364 - 00:35:41.420, Speaker C: Will be kind of this ideological spread between these two assets, and that will only continue over time as bitcoin is largely a finished product and Ethereum continues to develop and can potentially be co opted by institutions, by governments, by things like that, to use in ways that they kind of may. And so I definitely think the proof of stake merge is going to be a really big thing for the space. And just being able to solve that ESG catalyst with something that's forward looking and productive rather than buying carbon credits is just an entirely different kind of view of the space for a lot of allocators as well.
00:35:42.190 - 00:36:39.740, Speaker B: Fans, our last podcast with you, I think really what landed in my head and stuck with me was this line that DeFi is just this sandbox for possibility, right? You got one DeFi app plugs right into another DeFi app. And not only that, but finally we have a place for developers to play around and tinker with in a world of finance, not just a world of software, right? Software finance. And that's really the thing that DeFi has really unlocked for the world, is it gives developers a chance to play and tinker. And when you give developers like this sandbox, naturally innovation just explodes. That was your insight and prediction back when we did our first podcast back in August of 2020. How have you seen that money Lego system play out over the next nine months? What did the developers do? What did you expect? What was a surprise to you? And how would you illustrate the, and how would you characterize the nature of DeFi money Legos in its current state and form?
00:36:41.250 - 00:36:42.000, Speaker E: So.
00:36:45.090 - 00:37:28.442, Speaker C: What did we do over the past year? I feel like the first thing we did was just a ton of creative destruction, which is really bullish. You're creating a lot of things that are all incentivized by tokens. It's kind of like war of the worlds with these different token communities. And I think we saw a lot of projects fail, get hacked, have bad outcomes. We also saw a lot of projects kind of get battle tested, grow as communities morph into different things and extend their use cases. We also saw the rise of daos, again, maker kind of pivoting away from its foundation model, which I think is really smart, and going more into a pure Dao. And now I think we're at the point where most of the major DeFi protocols, there are no bank accounts, there's no gusto website for them to set up their benefits.
00:37:28.442 - 00:38:07.640, Speaker C: If you work there, you're getting paid through a multi sig in stablecoins or native tokens. And that's kind of really a different form factor of work, similar to kind of when people invented the joint stock corporation. I think that will be something that persists over time and people continue to iterate on. And there was a ton of growth in the DeFi area in terms of just battle testing. The main things that launched that we were really excited about were derivatives and options. And I think kind of what we learned in hindsight is that these things need layer two to really work. Like, you just literally cannot have a fast enough oracle to prevent things like front running and back running.
00:38:07.640 - 00:38:49.160, Speaker C: You can't build a custom amm to kind of trade options on without layer two. And so the things that we thought would really take off on layer one were kind of just a little too expensive, the gas was too high, the oracles were too slow. And so I think those were the things that didn't work as much as we would have wanted. But overall, just the growth of the ecosystem has been absolutely insane. I think Ave has $21 billion of TVL in it, urine has seven synthetics, is creating a ton of volume, and issuing a ton of debt. And so things have been really bullish. I think collectively, we're all waiting for layer two and what that is going to hold, and I think it's just going to be more than we can expect.
00:38:51.130 - 00:39:49.130, Speaker B: One of the big themes of DFI is capital efficiency and being able to tap into the value of your assets. And that is definitely a theme that I have been particularly paying attention to. Right, like uniswap three advertises capital efficiency, capital efficiency, balancer fee two, capital efficiency. We have liquidity and their new LUSD for 0% interest with 110% collateralization ratio on your eth, capital efficiency. And naturally, Ave has kind of led the charge with being able to tap into the value of your assets, where you deposit your assets, and then you can tap into the capital efficiency of your assets. Where is the logical conclusion of a Defi ecosystem that is really competing at the highest degree to provide its users with capital efficiency. Is this a new paradigm about how people engage and interact with their assets? What does this mean over the long term?
00:39:49.870 - 00:40:49.398, Speaker C: Yeah, when Uniswap went in the v three direction, I think a lot of people were pretty surprised. There is this idea that there's going to be a curve instead of an order book, and that means that everyone is going to get to participate. And I think that dream was probably a little bit oversold relative to reality. And now you have things like sushi that are still kind of on that same curve, but all the people that can't set up these bots to do v three are now kind of in the sushi curve. And that just means that there's less fees, there's more people, there's more mouths to feed. And that's probably not the version of the future that plays out. And the version of the future that plays out, at least to me, is where there is some sort of either intermediary protocol that is basically doing the LP for people on things like v three, or we get to a point where basically the people who have some technical ability are the ones that are able to capture those fees.
00:40:49.398 - 00:42:03.406, Speaker C: And I strongly think it'll be the first one. Like there is just a market opportunity and people will come and fill that. But I think the really interesting thing about b three and just this trend of capital efficiency in the context of a bunch of different layer twos and a bunch of different exciting ecosystems, is that with a couple of hundred million dollars of capital and four to five smart people, you can go off and dominate any l two you want with something that looks like b three, you don't need to port all of your liquidity there. And so just like this idea that people can be in multiple places at multiple times is really interesting from a product standpoint, because it kind of begs the question as to if capital efficiency is going to be the new thing that drives the space forward. Where is uniswap.org routing liquidity through? Like, if there's multiple layer know, are they building more of an aggregator? Does the focus become more on a consumer product and less on these liquidity pools? Or how does that work? And so I think there's a lot of unanswered questions for me about the future of front ends in the space as it relates to kind of this theme of capital efficiency and the fragmentation of different market makers and pieces of capital across layer twos. But yeah, I think it's going to be a trend that impacts basically every market derivatives markets will need to get more efficient.
00:42:03.406 - 00:42:14.150, Speaker C: So will lending markets. And this idea that everyone's earning these fees and these amms may come under question at some point or maybe kind of routed through a second order primitive.
00:42:14.730 - 00:42:54.546, Speaker A: Vance, I think there's a whole discussion that we want to have in just a couple of minutes about layer two. Because that layer two does feel like a huge unlock for the industry. I mean, you just talked about options being only really possible in sort of a layer two scenario. And that's been a learning of yours over the last nine months. Let's talk about layer two in a minute. But before we do, want to ask your more general thoughts on this. So David and I have often said on bankless that Defi is basically we're speed running the last 1000 years of financial history, right? Like we're just speed running it right now.
00:42:54.546 - 00:43:04.290, Speaker A: We're at the point in the 18 hundreds where we have this store of value and we have these proto banks. It's all code, but then we have things like collateralized loans.
00:43:04.370 - 00:43:04.566, Speaker C: Right.
00:43:04.588 - 00:43:22.430, Speaker A: That's cool. These are some of the money legos that have been built. What I want to ask more generally, before we get to the layer two discussion, is what's kind of next? What do we need to build next? Okay, we have uniswap. We've got permissionless trading. We've got that function. That's our Nasdaq, that's our New York stock exchange. Cool.
00:43:22.430 - 00:43:39.700, Speaker A: We've got collateralized lending, some building blocks there and borrowing. That's cool. We have some other early primitives too. But what do you think DeFi really needs to build next? And what will be next? What other money legos should we be looking at now?
00:43:40.790 - 00:43:58.118, Speaker C: So I'll speak to kind of the first trend that I think is going to happen in the next couple of years is basically verticalization. Taking these liquidity pools that are on chain, taking these borrow, lend or money markets that are on chain, putting them.
00:43:58.124 - 00:44:00.342, Speaker E: In a front end that is either.
00:44:00.476 - 00:44:18.686, Speaker C: Specific to an industry or a geography, and just running that playbook. As an entrepreneur, you don't need to build the entire financial services stack that you would as a financial services startup. You can leverage a lot of the open source code and liquidity that exists on chain and just build a tailored user experience to whatever industry or geography you're in.
00:44:18.868 - 00:44:29.102, Speaker A: Can I ask a question of that? So is that sort of like what fintech has done with the traditional banking system, only this is like fintech on D. Five primitives.
00:44:29.246 - 00:45:28.706, Speaker C: Exactly right. This is a playbook that fintech started deploying in kind of like 2013, 2014, but it's still been pretty slow to roll out just because the legacy rails that are on are so slow and restrictive. But we are hyper focused on funding these different kind of vertical ideas. Because if you have a whitelisting service that can basically wrap a piece of real estate, vote it in as collateral and maker, and then start to draw a die against that, that's a business. And the business is some function of the whitelisting of the wrapping of the real estate, the governance votes that you need to pass its collateral and maker and generally kind of the entire consumer experience of getting die back in your bank account. But that's a financial service that probably worth a few billion dollars if someone builds it into a full company, taking the Defi products like a high yield savings account, like a borrow in functionality, and bringing it to a country like Chile or Argentina or Brazil, those people have pretty terrible financial services at this point. They're inclined towards bitcoin.
00:45:28.706 - 00:45:35.110, Speaker C: They already know crypto. That's another kind of mass market project that we're looking at pretty heavily.
00:45:35.610 - 00:46:04.740, Speaker A: Let's camp here for a second because that is super interesting to me. David and I have talked about this concept of the defi mullet, which is know fintech in the front and defi in the back, sort of like traditional bank in the front. But I'm curious what you think. Do you think that it will be new startups and crypto natives who start using this defi infrastructure for their quote unquote fintech? Or do you think some existing fintech players will jump in and start capturing these markets, the PayPal's and the squares of the world?
00:46:06.150 - 00:46:41.854, Speaker C: It's going to be new teams. The incumbents have a very low motivation to really kind of innovate or build anything that does not exist on their payment rails. And so that limits a lot of what they can do from a defi perspective. And so the teams that we're looking at are a couple of engineers from MongoDB and Facebook that grew up in Argentina, spent four or five years in the Bay Area, and are now playing around with Ethereum for the first time. And they're moving back to their home country because they're interested in living there. But they want to take a lot of what they've learned and played around with on the Internet back with them. And so those are the typical teams that we're looking for.
00:46:41.854 - 00:47:30.186, Speaker C: They have kind of some of the web two talent, they're engineering focused or product focused and they have the local context to be able to build and market a product. And there are hundreds and hundreds of these stories both across industry and geography, and you're just going to see this play out over and over and over again. I think the reality is we're naturally inclined to look for let's find all these new primitives and let's go fund them. And we're very much in that business, but we are really like an inch deep in terms of the actual amount of traction we've gotten with the services that we have. And just the ability to doesn't matter if it's Christmas Eve at midnight, if you have some form of crypto collateral, you can go and get a loan from Ave, from maker, from synthetics. It just is a better financial experience. And porting that is just basically instant margin for whatever startup does it.
00:47:30.288 - 00:47:53.730, Speaker A: That is awesome, that verticalization idea. So that sounds like a big theme. And I guess what that means is there are going to be all these deFi fintechs that pop up in these different verticals around the world, but it also means maybe a swelling of TVL and usage and capital for existing DeFi protocols. Is that how you see it?
00:47:53.880 - 00:48:22.954, Speaker C: Yeah. And if you look at the architecture of a lot of the major DeFi protocols right now, Aave is in many ways a company. It has full staff, it has an office. They have people leading the day to day. They are not focused on building the protocol right now. They're focused on mainstream adoption, and they've chosen the vertical of institutions. I don't know if you've seen their kind of institutional pools, but that's one example of this thesis playing out in real time.
00:48:22.954 - 00:48:39.010, Speaker C: And so oftentimes if there still is that core group of people and there is a company around the protocol, that's going to be the first people to do this thesis. But it's just such an easy way to build a startup where you don't need to build the financial services rails. And people are going to pick up on this. It's just a matter of time.
00:48:39.080 - 00:48:44.842, Speaker A: Vance, explain really quickly Ave's institutional pools for people who aren't familiar.
00:48:45.006 - 00:49:48.790, Speaker C: Yeah, so institutional pools are effectively a sidecar pool where all participants in the pool are KYC, they know each other, and they basically have been vetted to not be on an OFAC list, which is the office foreign asset control, which kind of stipulates that there are certain countries and people that are not allowed to interact with kind of the traditional banking rails. And so for people like retail, it doesn't really matter that much having those insurances, because you're trading some coin in a unisol pool and you're pretty sure you're not doing anything nefarious. But for institutions, they need that higher level of insurance just because they have a higher level of expectation from their board, their fiduciaries, people like that. So I very much see Ave leading the way in kind of the institutionalization, or at least that vertical with their financial services. But there are hundreds of those industries that would like access to these financial services, but just have no idea how to do it. And currently, their best way of thinking through it is like, should I buy Ethan Coinbase? But in reality, there's just so much more depth when they actually start using it.
00:49:48.860 - 00:49:49.822, Speaker A: Okay, so vertical.
00:49:49.906 - 00:50:02.940, Speaker B: Would you call this new version of Ave as, like, KYC Ave or permissioned Ave just because of the nature of the clientele that needs to have those assurances? Is that how you would describe this?
00:50:04.750 - 00:50:41.018, Speaker C: I would say it's probably like. I wouldn't say it's like, regulated Ave because it's self regulated. No regulators forcing them to do this. They're doing this at their own behest. I would say that this is probably like KYC light Aave. We've been looking a lot into the reg tech space and different approaches know at least some sort of KYC or some sort know regulation in the space, because I think over the long term, it's coming, and it's a good thing, and it'll probably be less painful than we all think. But my thing with regtech is that the solution can't be worse than the problem.
00:50:41.018 - 00:51:01.070, Speaker C: The solution to KYC can't be giving the government our money in a custodial smart contract that's just not going to work. And so the self regulation at the liquidity pool layer, while I understand the backlash from people on Twitter that don't like it, the bottom line is that it's just a far better way of doing this than putting our assets in a smart contract from the government.
00:51:01.220 - 00:51:15.010, Speaker A: Yeah. To me, it's like, less KYC Ave and more like the pool itself is KYC. KYC'd light. Right. The protocol and the code is still completely permissionless, uncensorable, Ethereum tech. Right. And that's not the part that's being kyc'd.
00:51:15.010 - 00:51:47.600, Speaker A: Okay, so speed running again. That was a whole segue on verticalization, which is super cool. Great insight, guys. Alpha to bankless listeners, I think, look for these opportunities. Look maybe for DeFi protocols that are speed running these verticalization opportunities. That's maybe some other insight that Vance just dropped. What else besides verticalization? What are some other future trends as we build out this defi money stack that you guys are thinking about?
00:51:50.210 - 00:52:43.754, Speaker C: Future trends? Yeah, this is going to sound cringe to a lot of people, but I think enterprise blockchain is going to be back at some point and this time it'll actually be fundamentally productive at some level. A lot of the investors in our fund are software as a service, companies that are looking for ways to integrate blockchain technology. And I think we've gotten past this goofy private blockchain proof of concept where everyone's holding hands, running a node and that's how the service runs. And I think we're now kind of more into the land of, hey, one of these SaaS companies, let's launch a roll up. Let's just use it as our native sandbox. Let's have a token. If other companies want to join, we'll kind of incentivize them to just build things in this sandbox.
00:52:43.754 - 00:53:39.700, Speaker C: And I think that you're going to need a lot of kind of developer evangelization, which is like a traditional Silicon Valley strength. But at the end of the day, there's just a lot of superpowers in crypto that even if it's earning 2% yield on your cash every year, startups have been built on far less than that. And so you will see the slow kind of enterprise blockchain movement picking up again. And I think the things that make me really bullish on that are talking to people that work at the big four consultancies that sell these technology solutions as a service to these massive Fortune 500 companies. And they look at Ethereum, they see it as incredibly neutral kind of sediment layer, and they also see it as a revenue opportunity because that's just something they can sell through to their consumers. And I think a lot of the work that people like Paul Brody are doing is really interesting and important because at some level those four consultancies are the ones that really determine what is the technology of the future. So I think those are really bullish as well.
00:53:39.700 - 00:53:43.810, Speaker C: So I think that will be a big one eventually as well.
00:53:43.960 - 00:54:14.970, Speaker B: Is that specifically enabled because of roll ups? You added roll ups in your answer. And I think people who aren't paying detailed attention to roll ups maybe are missing the power behind them and the ability for anyone to just quote, unquote, spin up your own blockchain. Like here's your blockchain, except it's also super fast and secured by Ethereum. And you don't have to worry about consensus because Ethereum takes care of that for you. Now everyone can have a roll up, right? Like Coinbase can manage it. It's accounting on a roll up. It could be public, it could be private.
00:54:14.970 - 00:54:25.490, Speaker B: Wells Fargo could be on a roll up is the reason why you are now bullish on enterprise blockchain stuff is because of specifically roll ups.
00:54:26.550 - 00:55:28.790, Speaker C: So I think the reason why I'm bullish is because roll ups give kind of like this modular way for people to interact with blockchains isn't just like you're on the base layer of Ethereum. It's public, it's super expensive, there's very little room and creative license to maneuver. I think the roll up gives them that creative license, and it gives them just a little bit more flexibility in terms of deploying a solution that's form fitted to their needs. So I think that's kind of the first thing. I think the second thing is building these developer sandboxes, whether it's like an in person accelerator, an online hackathon, whatever. Having a native incentivization layer of a token and being able to distribute this to people that are also kind of like minded, maybe in the same enterprise software cohort, that's something else that's powerful with a roll up where you can have that token incentivize usage and just testing of things. And so my good friend John, who's an investor in the fund, he runs a company called Stream, which is a data replication service, where when you're moving your data from one SQL database to another, he will replicate it and put it in the cloud and you can access it whenever.
00:55:28.790 - 00:56:02.880, Speaker C: That's probably a billion dollar business they just raised from Goldman Sachs. It's really an incredible company, but it's built on a very specific premise. At some level, these rollups will be used for either data replication, just experimentation with kind of internal transfers, or cash management, or just kind of general ideas about how to kind of streamline workflows. And so at some point, enterprises will come to blockchain and use it for things that are productive, but it's not going to be in the private blockchain concept that we're kind of used to. And that idea is still probably a few years away, but I do think it's coming at some level.
00:56:03.250 - 00:56:54.160, Speaker A: Vance, you mentioned Paul Brody, and he's at Eny, and I just saw some headlines that they just received another 100 million dollar investment in their kind of blockchain crypto business unit heavy into Ethereum. I think a lot of stuff is going unnoticed that might just start to become visible with the advent of cheaper block space on layer two. One thing I do feel like though, is you mentioned enterprises maybe marshaling and using tokens. It does feel like we need to have some more regulatory clarity, perhaps before the legal teams of large enterprises, like get comfortable with this. We had Hester purse in the podcast a couple of months ago, and she's very much like, I wish we could have sandboxes for DeFi. And we were like, Hester, we think that's great. We do.
00:56:54.160 - 00:57:12.440, Speaker A: You can you convince the SEC and Gary Gensler and those regulatory bodies to go do that? Do you think maybe now it's not so much the scaling technology, it's maybe the regulatory clarity that is, I guess like the blocker right now?
00:57:13.770 - 00:57:57.270, Speaker C: I think a lack of regulatory clarity is kind of both a feature and a bug. I think the perspective of regulators, and this is me interpreting public comments and private conversations, is basically they don't want to hamper innovation and they don't know what the space is going to become. So they don't want to put any rules in place that will inherently block a lot of the innovation that's happening in the space. At the same time, they're very concerned with things like consumer protection, which, given their mandate, is right at the top of the list. But I think they're really smart people working in these agencies, and so it's not like they hate our industry and they don't want to give us rules. I think it's more of a forward looking. We don't really want to kneecap what's happening right now.
00:57:57.270 - 00:59:15.550, Speaker C: And so they're punting a lot of things. This does put enterprises in a weirder kind of area from a regulatory standpoint. But what's the difference between custody and something like BTC on your balance sheet or other tokens? What's the difference between selling a software subscription license versus having some sort of token denominated payment mechanism like any of the crypto native startups that have today? I think these questions are less further afield than you might think. Well, do I see these enterprises, like turning their business models inside out in the next few years and adopting tokens at mass? I probably don't see that, but I do see there's going to be this slow edging towards using these blockchains for things that are fundamentally productive. Like a good example of a use case that I was talking to someone at Deloitte about is just a volume rebate, where based on the amount of orders that are coming through, a smart contract can automatically tell, adjust the pricing and then continue on with that customer at a different rate based on their volume into the future. And those are the things that as long as there's a couple of counterparties that are interacting in public on a blockchain, that have that logic programmed in that interaction, perfect for a blockchain. And I think part of that is going to be enticing the other side onto something like a roll up with some sort of token incentive.
00:59:15.550 - 00:59:50.054, Speaker C: But a lot of these companies, they're not that far away from doing things like that. I think things happen quicker than you expect. The institutions were coming for so long and it didn't seem like they were in crypto. And then all of a sudden one day they showed up Ethereum scaled like, you know, almost overnight, similar to Polygon. These things are nonlinear and they come in months. So I think there's a lot of people in the software as a service industry looking at blockchain as a revenue stream and are working towards a future where they can build applications on top of it. And it's just a matter of kind of incentivizing things.
00:59:50.054 - 00:59:54.554, Speaker C: And that's why I think things like roll ups are going to be powerful in drawing those cohorts in.
00:59:54.752 - 01:00:53.530, Speaker B: Let's turn the l two conversation towards, I think, what the average listener might be more familiar and excited with, which is how l two s are going to impact them. I've been articulating this thesis of the l two dfi summer round two that could, in theory, be right around the corner. And so, Vance, I want to get your gut take on this possible version of the future that may be coming. And we just had arbitrum launch last Friday. Optimism seems to be around the corner. Polygon is already doing absolutely fantastically. And all this new real estate is becoming made available, right, like Ethereum as the central hub is getting all these different spokes unlocking, and developers are rushing out to all this new real estate to build all these new apps, because they know that once they build all these new apps, they're going to attract all the tourists, right? Everyone's going to come and move and spend money at their defi app attraction.
01:00:53.530 - 01:01:25.382, Speaker B: And so all of a sudden there's this massive amounts of new real estate that's really valuable for defi apps to claim. And so defi apps want to. Sushiswap wants to beat Uniswap to adoption on arbitrum. And Uniswap wants to beat sushiswap as adoption on optimism. And in my mind, how are we going to get this done? To me, the answer is liquidity mining. Just because what do we know and love in this space? And we know that it works. And it works because there's this massive incentive, and we've already done this before.
01:01:25.382 - 01:02:08.074, Speaker B: We already had the OG version of DfI Summer, which was all done on the Ethereum main chain. But now it's not just incentivizing user participation and just usage of these apps on the main chain, it's getting people out into the l two s, out into arbitram, out into optimism. And not only do these dfi apps need to incentivize people, but the actual l two s also need to incentivize people to use their l two. And so we'll have, in possible version of the future, we will have all these dfi apps incentivizing their usage via traditional liquidity mining like we know and love. But they will also be boosted by the native tokens of arbitram, which is complete speculation. If they have a token, I have no idea. Same thing with optimism.
01:02:08.074 - 01:03:02.680, Speaker B: No idea if they're having a token, but it would fall in line with the nature of this industry if people like tokens and people like issuing tokens. And so not only are the liquidity mining incentives going to be juiced by sushi rewards and Uniswap releasing uniswap rewards, but optimism arbitrum. And we're already seeing this with polygon issuing tokens for their own native asset in order to distribute those hands in the hands of the users. So we have this dual liquidity mining possibility ahead of us, where both the apps and the L two s are incentivizing usage of the L two s, and we can finally have dfi summer round two layer two edition. Except this time it's actually even more awesome because there won't be any fees, or at least there will be significantly less fees, because it's on l two s. That's my perceived theory of what could happen over the next three to six to nine months. How does that land with you?
01:03:04.330 - 01:03:43.410, Speaker C: I think you're probably right. If you look at something like Maddox, which has seven or 8 billion in TBL, it's basically the size of finance smart chain. A lot of that is Maddox itself. Maddox is now the 11th most valuable cryptocurrency in the world, which is just absolutely wild to me. Not because I don't think it should be it just has been a meteoric rise. I think you'll see three or four of these same style of tokens by probably mid to late summer. And you'll see a lot of kind of the same things where a lot of the TVL in Matic is reflexive, where it's either incentivized by matic tokens, or trading matic for wrap, bitcoin or eth or other tokens that are on that chain.
01:03:43.410 - 01:04:30.690, Speaker C: You'll also see a ton of kind of these roll up native projects come into play where things like quickswap is like the DaX of Polygon, something like Slingshot is the aggregator of Polygon. You'll probably see kind of like these different tribes kind of forming a line around these different layer two ecosystems. But I think generally no problems with that thesis. I think that will generally play out. There will be ton of tokens, it'll be very euphoric, people will be on these roll ups will be awesome. But I think the main thing that's going to happen is the people who've been waiting to try stuff that's too expensive on the base layer will now go for it on layer two. And there is just so much pressure of those projects, things like fractal, things like future swap, that base layers are just too slow and too expensive.
01:04:30.690 - 01:05:14.250, Speaker C: Hundreds of dollars per trade, $40 to $50,000 to deploy contracts that just doesn't work. And so getting to this lower cost environment will just be really rich soil for experimentation. And that's probably the thing that I'm most excited about. I think the con of a lot of that, and what I've heard frequently is these things aren't interoperable and how are we going to get liquidity from one chain to the other? I think there's reasonable solutions like hop, network, or connect, that will be able to route liquidity from roll up to roll up or back to the base layer. Market makers will serve some sort of bridge kind of functionality from the base layer to roll ups as well. But I also think that it's somewhat bullish for these things not to be able to interact. Diversity is the spice of life.
01:05:14.250 - 01:05:49.542, Speaker C: Having these ecosystems that are forced to grow their own identities and their own first principles is something that is really bullish, at least for me. If you kind of zoom out and you look at bitcoin and ethereum and all the early cryptos, you could kind of make the same argument like, oh, these things are too heterogeneous. There shouldn't just be one crypto that does it all. But really kind of that variety built that maximalism which built interesting cultures over time. And I think we're going to see the same thing play out with these layer twos. And I have no idea who will win in the short term. I think there's definitely talking to developers.
01:05:49.542 - 01:06:38.234, Speaker C: There's a real difference between asking users to pay dollars for a transaction versus a fraction of a penny, which is kind of what polygon is. But I think people generally realize the security trade offs of polygon versus roll up are very real over time. And my guess as to who wins the roll up wars in two or three years is basically the person who captures and utilizes MeV to the best extent for their own ecosystem. Right now, MeV is something that is basically a societal cost of doing business on the base chain. People taking one or two or 3% of your transaction back, running front running sandwich bots. And right now, the problem with MeV is basically who gets it and who gets it are the miners. And those are kind of a fundamentally misaligned participant set.
01:06:38.234 - 01:07:28.826, Speaker C: Because I don't know how much people running heavy electricity miners have to do with what I'm doing on a daily basis. I feel like if we had a conversation, we probably wouldn't be speaking the same language. But in a roll up, what happens is that MeV is basically the business model of that roll up, and you capture it, and you basically either distribute it back to everyone who's using the roll up, or you can allocate it to a token. And that token now has a lot of value because it's accruing those cash flows. And so there is some business model dependency that comes from MEV. But I think the chain that wins long term will be the one that productionalizes and utilizes that the most to bootstrap our ecosystem. And I think drilling down into what cultural alignment with Ethereum means, it probably means some sort of high level alignment with who gets MEV and why.
01:07:28.826 - 01:07:33.918, Speaker C: And that would be probably the determining factor of who wins this roll up.
01:07:34.004 - 01:08:13.660, Speaker A: War that's so fascinating on MeV. We just had arbitram on, and we had a discussion about MEV, and they talked about their plan to try to create some sort of fair protocol distribution mechanism for the MEV. Optimism has a different approach where they're maybe auctioning it. Do you have any insights into what the best design would be? Or are you just of like, let's try all the experiments and we'll see, but certainly the winning one will have some way to marshal MeV. Into something valuable and productive like any other, I guess deep takes on MEV and the experiments that you're seeing that are about to go live in the real world.
01:08:14.350 - 01:08:15.740, Speaker C: Yeah, I think.
01:08:18.270 - 01:08:18.986, Speaker E: We just need to.
01:08:19.008 - 01:08:53.254, Speaker C: Experiment with it right now. It's just going to the wrong participant set. I think that's the biggest problem with MeV. Not only are you losing money, it's like it's going to someone who you don't really like that much. But as long as we can capture that and make it part of a roll up, I think all of these things have a reasonably strong chance of being successful over the long term. But I do like the optimism role where they're auctioning off the sequencer or the role of the sequencer. So it's kind of like a proof of stake blockchain where, say, you have x amount of the x percent of the optimism token, you have an x percent of winning that sequence role at any given time.
01:08:53.254 - 01:09:41.122, Speaker C: And that sequence role has y amount of MEV in it for kind of z amount of time that you have the role. And so that is interesting to me as just like a primitive to kind of bootstrap and use this MeV. I still kind of really biased towards the fact that the MeV should go to the native token of the roll up. Because if that native token is incurring cash flows and everyone is kind of earning those tokens in some way, shape or form from being on the roll up, it's not really like you're losing any money from any potential MEV exploit. It's more of kind of like you're redistributing this wealth towards a more common and equitable set of participants that's on the roll up, and you just assume that that has positive externalities down the road. And so that's kind of how I would like to see it productionized. But those are pretty loose thoughts.
01:09:41.266 - 01:10:14.842, Speaker A: Fascinating takes. And guys, if you're not familiar with the term MeV, go back and listen to the Bankless podcast we just did a couple of weeks ago with Phil, Diane and company. We had a whole MeV panel. MeV stands for maximum extractable value, of course. And also listen to the arbitram episode we just did. Vance, you talked about layer twos, opening up new things, and there's certainly like, somebody writes for bankless from time to time. Kid in college, he's like, I couldn't afford transactions on Ethereum.
01:10:14.842 - 01:11:04.506, Speaker A: So all of these d five protocols you guys were talking about on bankless, I just couldn't use them because they'd cost like 20, $30 and I'm playing with $100 here, right? Like I'm in college. But he was like, polygon just opened this thing wide open for me. And now I actually get to test and experiment. And so like what you're saying about a new set of DeFi users being able to be onboarded who are less kind of like OG defi whales, ethereum whales, and are like a newer set of people. Totally resonates with what we're seeing. I'm curious though, with what some of the apps. So the mental model here is if you've ever played a game like civilization, something like that, right? Like there's a tech tree, and the civilization unlocks writing and then math, and that leads to physics, and eventually you get the nuclear bomb.
01:11:04.506 - 01:11:32.940, Speaker A: And the whole goal of the civilization is to go through this tech tree and unlock these various things. We've said before on bankless, that crypto and Defi is almost like a tech tree. Now we have this big unlock, which is layer two. So we've just unlocked something new that's going to lead to all of these other technologies and applications. What are some of those, do you think? You mentioned options maybe being one, something we couldn't do on Ethereum main chain, but in layer two we can. Is that one? What are the others?
01:11:34.030 - 01:12:49.390, Speaker C: I think options, derivatives, perpetuals, those are all the kind of obvious candidates that will launch and pretty much immediately do well once these layer twos are cheap and fast enough to use. There's no kind of existential question as to are those going to be valuable businesses? It's just kind of a question of when the things that are further afield that I'm even more excited about are things like games, where in the gaming industry you have this kind of moment where you now have open source developer platforms like Unity and Unreal. You have pressure on the free to play business model, which is 80 or 90% of the revenue in that industry, kind of coming under question as it just gets more competitive. And then you have blockchain developers or gaming developers looking over at blockchain developers and they see them selling 2030, $40 million virtual land. And it's just kind of a moment where they look over the fence and how do you do that? And it's a new business model for games. Major studios really have no incentive structure to go and experiment with something like this. And so you have kind of like all these indie studios that are in the gaming world that are now looking for this alternative or new form of just business.
01:12:49.390 - 01:13:29.040, Speaker C: And so those are the people that we've spent a lot of time talking to, both in terms of like, here's little blockchain is here's how you would do this, and also developing a playbook as to like, here's how you can build a game that has all these mechanics and is more of an economy than just kind of a free to play game. And so I think a lot of those people are going to come over, and they're going to come over quick because people have been funding these startups for the past two years and they're finally ready to release things. And so I'm really bullish on games as kind of a use case that will emerge on layer two, really in the context of either immutable x or polygon itself. Anything else in that is a little bit too expensive. So that's definitely another area that we're excited about.
01:13:29.890 - 01:13:54.200, Speaker B: Vance, there are still some l two skeptics or l two holdouts out there, and I was wanting to get your take on what do you think is the most viable bear case or pessimistic case for l two s? And is there any FUD out there that you want? I hate the word fud. Not everyone likes the word fud, but are there any issues that you'd like to clear up that you have in your head?
01:13:54.890 - 01:14:33.362, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the main one that I've heard is basically like, if you have a 50 million registered user application, you need 100,000 transactions per second to port that over to a blockchain. That's just not how these companies think. And I don't think we need to get to that level of transaction throughput to make a lot of these real life use cases real on a blockchain. So an example of that is visa. Their max throughput on their network is 22,000 transactions per second. They use about 1400 at their peak. And so that's a worldwide payment network that people are transacting on.
01:14:33.362 - 01:15:27.970, Speaker C: It's not that far afield from where arbitrum is, or optimism is, which is kind of in the realm of 3000 transactions per second at the peak. And it's also not really in the scope of how people develop products, because what does putting 50 million users on chain actually mean if it's a social media app is like every time you scroll on the app, like something you're putting on, like, how does that work? And the answer is basically no. Only the highest value use cases will really interact with these blockchains, just like Netflix wouldn't use their payment processor to store their content. People aren't going to use a blockchain to store things that either belong in file storage or just don't need to be on chain. And so I think the hybrid world of using these blockchains is really where we're trying to get to with these layer twos. We're not trying to build a thing that has billions of people transacting billions of times per second. That's just not really in the context of reality of blockchain applications.
01:15:27.970 - 01:15:36.920, Speaker C: I think that's kind of the main piece of fud that I've heard. That just seems like totally out of line with like if you've ever worked at a technology company. That's just not how you build a product.
01:15:37.850 - 01:15:39.494, Speaker E: The other part that I think is.
01:15:39.532 - 01:16:20.600, Speaker C: A risk is one of these things going down. I think the cool thing about roll ups is that you kind of have this escape hatch back to Ethereum mainnet. If things really go sideways, things like polygon get me a little bit nervous, especially when I see things like bad blocks or like an almost fork that happened, I think, last week. Instilling confidence in people is a force multiplier. And if one of these things were to go down, that would probably be a very negative setback for the space. That would be sad in terms of money and users loss, but it would also highlight kind of the longer term ramifications of why you would do something like roll up versus the side chain. So it's very hard to see a bear case for layer twos right now.
01:16:20.600 - 01:16:56.186, Speaker C: I think the other one I've heard is all of these little zones won't work. But I've kind of gone over that and I think it's just a good thing that these things will be inherently separated at some level, although loosely interoperable. And I think we'll also realize that there's diminishing marginal returns to more and more composability. Like not everything needs to be on the same chain at the same time, using the same applications. Again, that's just not how these applications are worked or are built. And most of the value of composability is historical composability. It's things that are built before you using die, using the set of smart contracts.
01:16:56.186 - 01:17:03.006, Speaker C: It's not kind of like every second, every block interacting with them. So I think that's something we'll also kind of realize coming down the stretch.
01:17:03.198 - 01:17:45.920, Speaker A: So if this thesis plays out and the advancement of layer two continues to play out, what does this mean for other layer ones. Read an article recently by Kyle Simani. It was called social scalability versus technological scalability. Talked a little bit about the lack of composability with Ethereum layer two strategy, which I think you just talked about and dressed. I think the other thing it talked about was basically transaction throughput, like being transaction throughput layer one, like maximalist. What's your take on all the other layer ones if your thesis is bullish? Layer two, Ethereum, what does this mean for them?
01:17:47.090 - 01:18:43.154, Speaker C: Yeah, I think I was probably more worried about Solana a couple months ago than I am today. And I think part of that is just kind of like coming to the event horizon where you realize that this chain won't be dying or going anywhere anytime soon, and it's just kind of going to look a lot like the people who are involved in it in the next two or three years. And what do I mean by that? I think it's going to be a lot of people like jump trading and a lot of people that trade on FTX that are doing things like real time trading on Salana, and I think that'll be a perfectly fine use case and market for them. But I think Ethereum will also shift. Ethereum won't always be about retail defi that will move to layer twos, it'll move to side chains, it'll move to roll ups. The base layer of Ethereum will be used by things like CBdcs, government projects, enterprises that really need something on chain that's really secure, high chips of stores of value. That'll also be what it's used for.
01:18:43.154 - 01:19:27.966, Speaker C: And so as Solana tries to catch Ethereum, Ethereum will be changing and it'll look a lot different in the next couple of years. And Solana will probably be where Ethereum is today in two years, focusing on these really low common denominator retail use cases of speculative deFi. I really hope that Ethereum develops into something that's bigger than that. That's certainly on the roadmap with most of the large kind of enterprises that are building on it. But what does it mean for layer twos to interoperate with other layer ones? There probably will be. Solana is coming out with wormhole, they're coming out with EVM compatibility for smart contracts written in C. And so I think there will be a good amount of kind of cross pollination.
01:19:27.966 - 01:19:40.230, Speaker C: I do think composability is largely off the table with that ecosystem, but that's probably a benefit for Ethereum to be know kind of constricting that activity, focusing on Ethereum, I think that's what we kind of want in the near term.
01:19:40.650 - 01:20:14.850, Speaker A: So Chris Berninski asked this question on Twitter recently. I'm going to ask it to you, Vance, which is kind of related to what we're talking about. It's kind of a question of, is there going to be a multi chain defi or is there going to be more an ETH with layer two defi? Right? And he asked this, will eth Dfi, in quotes, get replaced by multi chain defi competitors? Or will ETH DFI become multi chain DFI as Ethereum becomes the most interconnected network? Almost like a settlement network idea, what's your take on how this all evolves?
01:20:17.030 - 01:21:03.700, Speaker C: I think that's probably right. I feel like it'll be like multi chain eth first, it'll be polygon, arbitram, optimisms. Those ecosystems are vibrant enough where something like polygon can be the size of BSC. And so I really do think the data is pointing towards a multi chain Ethereum future, whether it be uses a settlement network for other layer ones or for other layer twos. So I do think that is probably the most likely case, especially given where we are with throughput on Ethereum right now. And I think that I would say guessing with an order of magnitude, we'll get 100 x increase in throughput on the base layer at some point in the next year or two. And that'll probably be good enough with sharding with roll ups to get to the 50,000 to 100,000 transactions per second.
01:21:03.700 - 01:21:22.440, Speaker C: Like we need to kind of compete with something like Solana. So multi chain will be real. But the advantages of this high transaction throughput, those have kind of diminishing marginal returns, and I think Ethereum gets there faster than people expect.
01:21:22.970 - 01:21:49.390, Speaker A: What would all this mean for ETH as an asset or the Ethereum network? Some people ask the question of, well, if Ethereum layer two is successful, then blocks based demand will just migrate off of Ethereum and go directly to layer two. And then layer twos might increase in competition with Ethereum layer one. They're just not sure how that pans out. What's your take on how that all pans out for ETH as an asset and for Ethereum?
01:21:49.970 - 01:22:37.898, Speaker C: Yeah, I think we want a smaller share of a bigger pie. I think that's where Ethereum goes philosophically over time, extracting maximum amount of fees on the base layer is just not a sustainable business model. And so I think we want this proliferation of different security trade offs of different layer twos of different side chains to push the business forward. Knowing that ETH is used as the transaction medium of exchange or it's used as some sort of economic substrate for the entire ecosystem. And so I think that's fundamentally bullish. And where we're headed, yeah, I think the most scary part of this will be things go to layer two. People are wondering if ETH has enough fees.
01:22:37.898 - 01:23:15.722, Speaker C: There's kind of like that lag in terms of demand for block space and then maybe the fees on the base layer dip. But over time, just the demand for block space is super high. Anecdotally, like seeing things like bitcloud, where the person who built it literally had to build their own blockchain to do it. That just tells me that there's a ton of these people that are waiting to try these things that are just not able to do them right now. And so I'm very confident in the demand for block space and just Ethereum being able to capture a smaller share of that over time. But these markets will grow so quickly. If you look at Goldman's report on software as a service, cloud sales.
01:23:15.722 - 01:23:43.860, Speaker C: This year there were $80 billion of cloud services sold worldwide. This year, Ethereum has eight or $9 billion of transaction fees forecasted for this year. And so it's like these things are growing extremely quickly. And I wouldn't be as concerned with the margins given that we're already so sizable. It's just about the tam exploding, which means that we have to really fully embrace these layer twos in all ways, shapes and forms. We can't be selective about what scaling solutions we like or don't like. We just have to try things.
01:23:44.630 - 01:23:55.560, Speaker B: Vance, on a recent podcast you were on with Frank from the block, you said this line that you think that being Ethereum first is, in short, supplies these days. What did you mean by.
01:23:58.730 - 01:24:40.882, Speaker C: You know, we were very public when we started our fund. We didn't invest in Ethereum killers and we didn't invest in bitcoin. And to a lot of people that seemed like we were tying one hand behind our back as we tried to jump a motorcycle over like twelve school buses that were on fire. But basically what that meant to us is basically putting a flag on the ground and saying, these are the values that we're interested in. It's about open permissionless innovation. It's about a culture of mentorship and bringing people into the space. And that was kind of what we identified with first and foremost because that was really what got Michael and I into those space and putting those values first was harder when Ethereum was down, when competitors were hotter, when other people were investing in base players which were pumping.
01:24:40.882 - 01:25:13.406, Speaker C: But it really has given us some credence with the Ethereum developers who like what we're doing. And just being able to play those long term games is, I think, a hallmark of what we do at framework. And what that has meant is just being Ethereum first and embracing those values. And so it's paid off for us pretty well. And yeah, we have no plans to embrace kind of any other chains in the future. We're not maximalists by any stance. But I do think people will say this is a biased view, but bias becomes conviction in many different ways.
01:25:13.406 - 01:25:15.780, Speaker C: And I think this is just our path to getting there.
01:25:16.150 - 01:25:26.520, Speaker B: France, I want to get your take on the ultrasound money meme. Is it a meme for the insular Ethereum community, for the defi power users? Or is it a meme for the world?
01:25:28.090 - 01:26:17.970, Speaker C: I think right now it's probably a meme for the ETH guys and ultrasound money eth. Do I think that is the best framing of the narrative? I think it's a pretty good one, but I think probably the better one, or maybe a different one, is just Ethereum is Amazon Web services for the next web. People want that clean technology comp, and I don't think they're latching on. The thing that people don't identify with really, in crypto is like this idea of private currencies. That's just something that people haven't really interfaced with before. Putting this as something that's technology first and framing it in that kind of lens for allocators in retail, I think, is the direction that I tend to go naturally. But once you use the financial services and you understand that, oh, I can stake this, I can also borrow against it.
01:26:17.970 - 01:26:33.402, Speaker C: This is something that it can be a medium exchange, it's deflationary. That is when that meme kind of really the rubber meets the road for me. So I think you want a little bit of the hook, and then you want a little bit of go down the rabbit hole meme. And right now the ETH is money meme is a little bit of the rabbit hole for me.
01:26:33.536 - 01:26:58.546, Speaker B: Vance, where would you say institutions are at with this rabbit hole with regards to ETH? There's been a ton of excitement over the last four, six weeks about institutional allocation into ether, the asset. Where are we in that phase of cycle? Are we still at the beginning of overall institutional allocation? Maybe towards the mid where are institutions in the Ethereum rabbit hole, would you say?
01:26:58.728 - 01:27:34.762, Speaker C: I would say we're at the very beginning. The ETH BTC ratio change felt like probably myself and a couple other people being loud about this thesis, you guys included, about why Ethereum is relatively more interesting and all the things that are happening and all the catalysts that are going on. I think that initial reprice of that ratio is basically all funds in the space coming to that same conclusion. But things like the ETH Trust in Canada, things like institutions really starting to allocate off their balance sheet. Those are just starting to happen. And it's a lot easier of a conversation than telling them about bitcoin. Telling them about bitcoin.
01:27:34.762 - 01:28:13.930, Speaker C: You have to kind of set the pretense we're going into hyperinflation. The US dollar is failing. It's kind of like this ever increasing crazy set of assumptions that you need to get people to buy into. Ethereum is much more of a relaxed conversation, talking about technology, talking about the future, talking about reasons to be optimistic. You don't need to get to that same headspace that you do to pitch bitcoin, which makes the institutional conversations a lot easier when you have that and you can couple it with some sort of valuation methodology that is not based on stock to flow, that is not based on the size of a comparable asset. It's just really easy. It does make our job a lot easier.
01:28:14.430 - 01:28:20.118, Speaker A: You don't even have to have the what really is money anyway conversation that makes you look at the weirdo at.
01:28:20.144 - 01:28:22.240, Speaker C: The party we don't want to have.
01:28:23.970 - 01:29:00.722, Speaker A: They're not ready for the pill, like taking all of that at once. And this is also what Matt Hogan from Bitwise says he's been on. And they're doing more with DeFi tokens. Do you think this also carries over with DeFi tokens? I mean, his commentary is basically this, look, institutional investors, capital allocators in the space, they've seen massive transformation through software. They've seen software eating the world because they saw it eat media, they saw it ecommerce, they're seeing it eat music. Every single industry, right? And, okay, now it's coming for banks. Like, okay, we understand DeFi in a nutshell.
01:29:00.722 - 01:29:26.290, Speaker A: And what are DeFi tokens? Well, these are capital assets. What are stocks? Oh, similar to capital assets. Oh, we can actually value these things. We don't have to have this weird what is money conversation about valuation? Are you seeing the same kind of things play out with defi tokens? It's like this is actually an easier discussion with institutional investors, once they wrap their head around the narrative, than having the what is sound money conversation.
01:29:29.110 - 01:30:15.662, Speaker C: The tokens themselves are still really esoteric to allocators, but we're starting to build the myth making process of let's talk about traditional fintechs, let's comp them to defi startups, let's look at the actual financials. Once they see those things, it becomes a lot easier. I think the things that they really have question marks about are know, what is the organizational governance construct that's happening on this? What is a dow? I've never heard of this before. Generally, the revenue, the expenses, all that stuff makes sense. But the organizational concepts are a little bit esoteric, and so educating them on those is a little bit more difficult. But the fundamentals, once people realize the fundamentals of etH, which I still think has not really happened, you haven't really seen Ryan Alice put one together. Ryan Berkman's put one together.
01:30:15.662 - 01:31:12.370, Speaker C: But a good discounted cash flow that models out Ethereum while the fees are actually accruing, like post 1559. I think that will be the first time that people realize the fundamentals of Ethereum, and then that will just lead them to realize the fundamentals of other things. And so it'll be a process, but I think by the fall, people will be in a headspace where they can actually buy and allocate towards these tokens off an institutional balance sheet. I think the big question that people will probably still have is like, how persistent is this revenue? And this kind of comes back to the idea of a super cycle. Like, is maker only printing cash when we're in super cycle? But this whole super cycle meme is kind of like predicated on these four year bitcoin boom and bust cycles. If ETh flips bitcoin, that materially derisks this super cycle meme. Because if we're just building things and winning and users are onboarding, we don't need to have the super cycle meme.
01:31:12.370 - 01:31:27.990, Speaker C: There was no super cycle in mobile technology. There was no super cycle in social media. We can just kind of redefine this asset class. And that flipping would de risk that question. Know, are these persistent? Know quite significantly.
01:31:28.590 - 01:32:01.410, Speaker A: This is a thing, Vance, I'm still stunned that investors still haven't fully understood defi tokens. And so Matt, once again, he wrote this in our newsletter recently. Imagine for a moment that Uniswap was not a decentralized crypto protocol, but let's just say it was a well funded Silicon Valley startup investors would literally be falling over themselves to sing its praises. Like look at this business. It was nothing two years ago. Now it's generating 250,000,000 in revenues per month. That's like an incredible story.
01:32:01.410 - 01:32:28.394, Speaker A: And I mean, we just saw last week Hayden Adams making the Wall Street Journal for the first time. But I can't believe this story is still underground. Why have I its price to earnings ratio for May 12. With this kind of growth, it's just insane. So you still think there's a ways to go and it's mostly because investors don't understand still what DFI tokens are and they can't grok the organizational structures of these things. Is that sort of why?
01:32:28.592 - 01:32:59.858, Speaker C: Yeah, I think we're at the very top of the informational totem pole and we realize all these things. We can tell the difference between dogecoin and maker and bitcoin. They kind of lump all this stuff into one and they assume that it's only because bitcoin is up is that everything s interest. And that is true to some extent. I think if we see a flipping, if we see some other asset carry the day with a more productive narrative, we can just assume that these cash flows will go on forever. Because this is just new fintech. There is no super cycle.
01:32:59.858 - 01:33:21.600, Speaker C: And so as much as I am a believer in the super cycle, I think almost the abandonment of that meme after we have some sort of flipping will be really healthy for this space because we're not relying on the habiting to generate these cash flows. These aren'tied. To some weird esoteric bitcoin narrative. If these are just endogenous, it becomes a lot easier to tell that story.
01:33:22.370 - 01:33:49.298, Speaker B: Vance, to me, the story of 2020 was all about on chain Dows with urine. Urine Dow, sushi Dow. All these organizations that have smart contracts baked into the Ethereum protocol that is generating fees. And all of a sudden there's a group of people focusing around building out that structure on chain daos. Lately we've seen a bunch of off chain daos come about. Metafactory comes to mind. Gitcoin Dow, bankless dow.
01:33:49.298 - 01:34:02.250, Speaker B: All of a sudden we have these things that are dows because they have a token, but there's nothing on chain about them. Where do you see this trend going over the next one year and then also one decade?
01:34:04.430 - 01:34:06.534, Speaker C: You just mean kind of dows generally.
01:34:06.662 - 01:34:12.590, Speaker B: Yeah, Dows generally that aren't necessarily protocols, but are just more digital organizations.
01:34:13.090 - 01:34:13.840, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:34:16.850 - 01:34:18.606, Speaker E: So we made an investment in a.
01:34:18.628 - 01:34:46.354, Speaker C: Company called Satellite, which basically is a noncustodial discord. None of your information is stored on discord servers. It's all managed on ipfs and textile. It runs on Ethereum and Solana. It just kind of is like a better version of discord in a lot of ways. And one of their first primitives is going to be just like the ability to tokenize and dow your community very effectively. And I just think these things are just like a new organizational construct, just like the joint stock company enable a lot of innovation.
01:34:46.354 - 01:35:26.482, Speaker C: You're going to see Dows just proliferate and be some sort of function of either a gnosis, multi sig or just a general Dow framework. And those are just going to kind of explode the design space for how you interact with communities, how you manage a certain set of initiatives, how you incentivize people. And I think it's just going to be inherently bullish for just human coordination. The more you can kind of get people in a room, get them in a good mood, get them incentivized, good things tend to happen. I think that's kind of been a lot of the headline through line for a lot of the things in crypto. And I think that'll just continue to proliferate, whether it's off chain or on chain. I don't really have a perspective on which one is best.
01:35:26.482 - 01:35:37.410, Speaker C: It seems like off chain comes with a lot of risks in terms of just how do you set it up legally, how do you kind of manage things, but very bullish on both versions of the future in terms of dows.
01:35:37.490 - 01:36:01.470, Speaker A: Van so far, we've seen crypto native dows really take off. Do you think there will be other non crypto native communities that start to come on board, or non traditionally crypto native? Like, I'm thinking of what you just said of one of the next bullcases for layer two is really the gaming community. You think we'll have gaming guilds form dows, or where do you think the next generation of dows might come from outside of crypto?
01:36:03.650 - 01:37:01.970, Speaker C: The three main areas are DFI, they're games, and then they're kind of these social constructs. And social constructs are kind of like things like bitcloud or just kind of further afield. Web three ideas I generally do think that in ten years, we will probably see north of 10% of world GDP come from dows. I do think it's that big of a transformational shift. And I think a lot of the products that were built over the past two or three years were just ahead of their time, like things like Aragon, if they would have built that with a little bit different branding and a little bit more streamlined and a little bit more enterprise use case, I think they really could have pulled that off and built a big business. And I think there will be second comings of those that are more enterprise oriented and probably a bit more streamlined with the tooling that we have today. But these things are going to get adopted en masse just because you can layer in identity permissions, all the things that you would traditionally expect from an enterprise and just have a much more streamlined and effective on chain.
01:37:02.470 - 01:37:54.020, Speaker B: Vance in our first podcast we talked about a bunch of these defi native founders, Donnie Kane, and we were comparing and contrasting what does it mean to be a startup founder of a traditional startup, tech startup, C Corp startup, versus what it's like to be a Defi founder. And you said that when you are talking to these founders who have visions of issuing a token and then handing over governance to the community, you say that. You ask them, are you really about that life? And I thought that was a great line. But I also want to expand that same sort of vibe to a broader set of people rather than just defi founders, maybe just defi users. How would you illustrate or classify what it means to be about that life just as a defi user these days? What does it mean to be about the defi life?
01:37:55.190 - 01:38:37.570, Speaker C: Being your own bank is terrifying, straight up. I don't think we need to sugarcoat it for anybody that's on in crypto, but the access to financial services that you get is one to two orders of magnitude better than what you would receive in a traditional banking environment. And so for me it's about accepting those trade offs and realizing that you can get to this alternative financial services stack where you have nfts. If you want something visual, you have defi as your financial services rails. You can buy bitcoin if you're not that into the US dollar. And together this kind of comprises this very complete, very interesting alternative financial services stack, but only if you're willing to go there. And the risk is you send your money to the wrong address.
01:38:37.570 - 01:39:28.354, Speaker C: The risk is your computer gets hacked. The risk is your mom gets on your computer, hits a few keys and deletes your ethereum. There are non zero risks to using DeFi that don't exist in traditional finance. And so for me it's just kind of like know being about that life in the retail defi context is mostly about your path of getting like you usually heard about it from someone that you know or trust, or there was some asset that got you hooked and you kind of went into the breach to go explore it, and you were up late on your laptop trying to figure it out or troubleshoot issues with metamask. And that's really kind of what that means to me alongside accepting that, yeah, it's a lot scarier and it'll get easier, but you're kind of on the other side of this divide, and the grass is just much greener over here.
01:39:28.472 - 01:39:30.370, Speaker A: Why are you about that life, Vance?
01:39:34.870 - 01:40:16.270, Speaker C: I just have a very particular kind of set of skills and temperament that really kind of made this space just a natural fit for me. I was always looking for something in technology that had a lot of both optimism and a lot of edge, and this is something that really kind of satisfied both of those aspects of my personality just by being involved in. And crypto has always been just so welcoming to people like me that really kind of, that's what it's meant, for me at least, is just like the inclusive nature of open, informationless innovation. And if you think that you are made of the right stuff, you can go out and try. There's no one that's going to stop you. And that kind of gets to my point about dogecoin. I'm never going to tell anybody to not speculate on that stuff.
01:40:16.270 - 01:40:34.310, Speaker C: I think it's awesome in a lot of ways, but it's just about kind of being able to choose your own destiny, and that's certainly compared to being stuck in a web two company where your box is this big and you can only do the things that are in your role. This is pretty much infinitely interesting and inclusive, which is just very welcome.
01:40:34.460 - 01:40:38.722, Speaker A: A pioneer, a particular set of skills, Liam Neeson style.
01:40:38.866 - 01:40:42.198, Speaker B: As Levantz is saying, balancer is Defi's.
01:40:42.214 - 01:41:23.378, Speaker D: Most powerful automated market maker. Typical amms just have two tokens inside of one liquidity pool, which can lead to fractured liquidity across the many pairs. In Defi, with balancer, you can access the full power of multiple tokens inside of one single amm, which unlocks an entirely new playing field of possibility. This makes balancer an awesome building block for so many different use cases. Balancer pools can make asset indexes, but instead of paying fees to portfolio managers, Balancer lets you collect fees from traders who use your portfolio for liquidity. Additionally, balancer smart pools can be programmed to have properties that change according to predetermined rules, such as changing the swap fee based on market conditions or even liquidity. Bootstrapping pools, which can help you launch and distribute your token with day one liquidity.
01:41:23.378 - 01:42:08.318, Speaker D: At bankless, we used a liquidity bootstrapping pool to sell our bath t shirts to much success. Balancer V two brings powerful new features that makes your money work even harder for you. In V two, idle tokens are capable of generating yield in DFI without sacrificing liquidity in the pool. To top things off, Balancer is reimbursing all gas costs with ballot rewards, meaning that all your gas costs are returned to your wallet. With the balancer governance token, Balancer's mission is to become the primary source of liquidity in d five by providing the most flexible and powerful platform for asset management and decentralized exchange. Dive into the balancer pools at Pools Balancer Exchange Gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange. I've been a customer of Gemini since I first got into crypto in 2017, and it's been my main exchange of choice to make.
01:42:08.318 - 01:42:50.718, Speaker D: My crypto buys and sells. Gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide. And on Gemini, there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets, including many of the hot DFI tokens, and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid dye markets. Gemini just launched their earn program, where you can earn up to 7.4% interest on 26 various crypto assets. If you're tired of paying fees in DFI or you don't want to worry about DFI exploits, but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets, Gemini Earn is the product for you. Another product I'm stoked to get my hands on is the Gemini crypto back credit card, which gives you 3% cash back on all of your purchases, but paid to you in your preferred crypto asset.
01:42:50.718 - 01:43:13.514, Speaker D: When I get my Gemini credit card, I'm going to make sure that I get my cash back in ETH. So whenever I buy something, I get a little bit of eth bonus back to me. At the same time, you can open up a free account in under 3 minutes@gemini.com. Gobankless and if you trade more than $100 within the first 30 days after sign up, you'll be gifted a free $15 bitcoin bonus. Check them out@gemini.com.
01:43:13.632 - 01:43:38.886, Speaker A: Gobankless all right, let's use those set of skills, Vance, because we promised the listener this toward the end of this podcast, we would do some predictions at the end. Let's start where we left off. So total locked value in DFI. I think your original estimate in the next twelve months, let's say, was between 100 to 500 million. Let's start there. Would you revise.
01:43:38.938 - 01:43:40.146, Speaker B: That was nine months ago.
01:43:40.248 - 01:43:53.350, Speaker A: That was 9 billion. Sorry, I said million, but billion nine months ago. Would you revise that estimate or where do you think we will be in the next one to three years? Time for total locked value in DFI.
01:43:54.010 - 01:44:33.934, Speaker C: Yeah, so I think when I guess things, I try to guess within orders of magnitude, I find that if I get within an order of magnitude, I'm usually correct when I'm investing in it. Just point being, like, if I assume that DFI will get between 100 billion and 1 trillion and I invest in DFI, I'm just going to be right on the financial side. So that's why I try to kind of employ that methodology. And so, still have three months left. I think we'll get over 100 billion. So I think I'll probably regret on that one, but, yeah, I think you will. We're just going to see this accelerate from like 100 to 500 to a trillion.
01:44:33.934 - 01:45:15.966, Speaker C: The trillion mark will be when we are kind of just too big for regulators to no longer ignore us. Things will change. We will have some sort of KYC, there will be some sort of regulatory jurisprudence over the space, but that will be really bullish because we'll be able to interact with legacy institutions, and that will just in turn, accelerate the flywheel of more TVL. And I think we could be there probably in the next two years. Guys, everyone expects eth to go up a lot. Same with bitcoin. Most of the collateral is in those two native assets.
01:45:16.078 - 01:45:16.354, Speaker A: Okay.
01:45:16.392 - 01:45:48.230, Speaker C: We're going to have more stablecoin flows. There's $3.2 trillion of cash sitting on the sidelines right now in institutional allocators that are trying to allocate to everything from real estate to startups to crypto. Some fraction of that will come in, maybe not fully a third, like a full trillion, but I'd be willing to bet something like a fifth or a 6th comes into crypto. So I think there's good rationale for that to be the case. I think the even bigger one is just, like, things like monthly active users. Daily active users?
01:45:48.310 - 01:46:16.920, Speaker A: Yeah. Where are we now? Monthly active users? I mean, metamask is saying, like, 5 million. I don't know if that's a way to measure it. I've also seen estimates of, like, there's maybe 2 million or so active addresses on ethereum. So within an order of magnitude, we're in the single digit millions probably. Some might argue a little lower in the hundreds of thousands still, like that's where we are now, maybe with monthly active users. Where do you think we'll be in the next one to three years?
01:46:17.450 - 01:47:04.674, Speaker C: So I think Uniswap is probably close to having their first million monthly active user month. Things like Zapper are not far behind. And so I think we're going to get to the first app with 10 million monthly active users probably in the next year. The main thing and what we talked about earlier was like, what needed to stop on Ethereum was not being able to onboard people. Me having to send someone $20,000 of Ethereum just to get them trading and interested with polygon. Not only is it that things become cheaper, we can just onboard millions and millions and millions of new people. And so I think we're going to see our first 10 million monthly active user DaP at some point in the next year.
01:47:04.674 - 01:47:14.070, Speaker C: And it may be something that has this really interesting hybrid front end, which is an app and a protocol on the back end, maybe something like Dharma, but we'll get there pretty handily.
01:47:14.650 - 01:47:30.460, Speaker A: What about total locked value on layer two? Any predictions for that? I'm not actually sure where we are right now. I think you mentioned some stats around Polygon, which is like in the billions already, maybe close to double digit billions. So where are we now and where do you think we will be on layer two for total locked value?
01:47:30.990 - 01:48:17.258, Speaker C: Yeah, we're basically at 10 billion. I'm just going to round up seven or eight to ten, and I think we're going to get to probably 100 in the next year. And just the nature of Ethereum will change a lot. I think most Tbl will still be concentrated on the base layer, but there's a large cohort of people that will never interact with base layer Ethereum. So I think a lot of the retail deposits end up living on layer two on a roll up, and exchanges are just able to do withdrawals and deposits automatically. There's no need to bridge or withdraw to a layer one. So I think that will probably be 100 billion would probably be my guess as to where we are by the end of the year in terms of TBL, just on layer two, probably a little bit more.
01:48:17.424 - 01:48:48.402, Speaker A: Hundreds of billions on layer twos in a year or so. Getting total locked value in defi into the trillions in a three year time horizon. Sounds like both ETH and bitcoin are headed to trillions. And maintaining that in three years is what Vance is saying. Cool, man. Good predictions look, we are front running the opportunity here on bankless, and every time we've had you on, we've managed to front run some pretty significant opportunities. You've dropped a lot of insights for us here, Vance.
01:48:48.402 - 01:49:14.140, Speaker A: I'm curious, what is framework up to these days? Because you guys seem to be doing a lot, like growing. In addition to having these institutional conversations, you're also growing headcount. And I know you got a labs and a venture side. Tell us what you guys are doing in this space. I see you very much as a crypto native fund VC firm. So what does a crypto native VC firm look like and do at this junction in time?
01:49:14.910 - 01:50:30.870, Speaker C: Yeah, a lot of ventures is where I spend most of my time. But as things like you see someone like Sam bank and freed and Solana, you start to reason through, like, what do I need to compete with someone like that? And what we need to compete with someone like that is just an entity like labs that can trade hundreds of millions of dollars, billions of dollars per day on these markets, keep them in line, keep them healthy. And so a lot of our focus and our efforts have been towards building out a lot of kind of the active participation stuff that we do on chain, and just being kind of one of the arbiter stewards of just keeping the space safe when things are really volatile, even if it's not the highest and best use of our own capital at the moment, we're willing to take one for the team in terms of helping protocols stabilize the pegs of their stable coins, stabilize their derivatives markets. That's definitely something that we've really kind of leaned into recently. So that's been a big effort of ours. And then also just building out just the venture firm that we wish we had as founders in DeFi. All these services that you would need, recruiting, smart contract auditing, those are things which really are the first audit you can get right now for open zeppelin is in September.
01:50:30.870 - 01:50:54.320, Speaker C: So helping solve that bottleneck is a big part of what we're trying to think through right now, and we have the talent to do it. But really, I think of framework less as a venture fund and more as just of a company venture is one of many things that we do to kind of push the space forward, but we're hyper focused on just adding as much value to kind of both the on chain ecosystem and the founders that are building the know off chain as we can.
01:50:55.010 - 01:51:31.874, Speaker B: Well, bankless nation, I think you can tell why we brought Vance Spencer back onto the podcast to hear his takes. And if you are listening to this on Monday the 7th when this podcast gets released. We are having Vance on a DFI panel on Wednesday at 01:00 p.m. PST with Spencer noon and Santiago Santos from Parafi Capital. And so that is going to be live streamed on the bankless YouTube. And so we are going to put Vance and a couple of the other, in my opinion, just absolute leaders of DFI thought, on a panel together and see what happens when we put all their brains into one spot. So put that on your calendars.
01:51:31.874 - 01:51:35.482, Speaker B: That's coming Wednesday at 01:00 p.m. And I'm really looking forward to it.
01:51:35.616 - 01:51:42.122, Speaker C: Thank you guys so much. It's been amazing. Always a pleasure to be on bankless and thanks for all that you do. Really appreciate it.
01:51:42.256 - 01:52:00.882, Speaker A: Awesome, Vance, thanks again, man. It's great to keep up with you doing a lot of awesome things in this space. Bankless listeners, we've got three action items for you. First is tune into that YouTube panel on Wednesday 01:00 p.m.. PST. You'll find that on Bankless YouTube. You can probably set a reminder for yourself.
01:52:00.882 - 01:52:22.362, Speaker A: We'll try to include a link in the show notes to that episode. Also, go back in time. Listen to episode number 28 again with Vance. It was a fantastic episode. Holds up very well. Just recently listened to it. And then of course, third action item, relisten to this episode because there's a ton of gleanings I think you'll get on a second listen as well.
01:52:22.362 - 01:52:38.186, Speaker A: Of course, risks and disclaimers. You got to ask yourself if you're going crypto native. Are you about that life? That is the question that Vance posed because EtH is risky. Crypto is risky. So is Defi. You can always lose what you put in. But we are headed west.
01:52:38.186 - 01:52:44.206, Speaker A: This is the frontier. It's not for everyone. But we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
