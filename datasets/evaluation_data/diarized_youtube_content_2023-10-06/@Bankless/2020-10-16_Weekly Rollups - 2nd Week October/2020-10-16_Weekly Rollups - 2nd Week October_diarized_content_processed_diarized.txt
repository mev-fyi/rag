00:00:07.690 - 00:00:22.254, Speaker A: Bankless nation. Welcome to the first weekly roll ups round. I am Ryan Sean Adams. I'm here with David Hoffman, my host, and we are doing a weekly roll up. David, why don't you tell the folks what roll ups round are going to be?
00:00:22.372 - 00:00:49.754, Speaker B: Yeah, the crypto world is insane. It moved way too fast, and so we don't really have enough time to talk about it. And so what are we doing? We're rolling them up. We're rolling them up. We're going to bundle everything that happens into a week into a 30 minutes episode. We have five categories that we're going to spend 5 minutes on each and then a little bit at the end of what we are excited about. But we are trying to get as much information injected into your guys'brains as fast as possible.
00:00:49.754 - 00:00:54.042, Speaker B: And that's exactly what roll ups do. And so hence roll up rounds.
00:00:54.186 - 00:01:23.558, Speaker A: So if you want to catch up on the week that just happened in crypto, tune in on Fridays. That's when we're releasing this. We're actually doing a simultaneous release on both YouTube so you can catch us there. We're going to have graphics, we're going to show you graphs, that sort of thing. It will also be published on the podcast on Friday morning for you podcast listeners. So you can enjoy everything that happened in crypto for the previous week on Friday morning with your morning coffee roll up round and morning coffee sounds pretty good to me.
00:01:23.724 - 00:01:27.826, Speaker B: Absolutely. Let's get right into it. What are we rolling up first? Ryan?
00:01:27.938 - 00:01:45.518, Speaker A: All right, well, so we've got five categories, right? So we've got market. What's the market saying? We've got releases. What got released? We've got news. What's happening in the news. We've got some hot takes. And then lastly, we're going to end with what we are excited about. So first we've got market.
00:01:45.518 - 00:01:56.820, Speaker A: What is the market saying, David? We've got 5 minutes. I'm going to start the timer in 5 minutes to keep us honest here. And let's talk about the first items, which is bitcoin and EtH price.
00:01:57.190 - 00:02:25.626, Speaker B: Yeah, bitcoin is at 11,500. Ether is at $378. Kind of being relatively flat, I would say. But there are some really cool things going on behind the scenes. Namely, along with this is the bitcoin hash rate is at an all time high. And so while prices, this is the first time bitcoin has really sustained above $10,000, which is bullish in of itself. But it's been here for a while.
00:02:25.626 - 00:02:48.254, Speaker B: It's being pretty flat. But hash rate is at an all time high. And historically, something that's interesting about miners is that miners tend to be really good traders. And so when they sell bitcoin and when they don't sell bitcoin has historically been really strong signals as to what's been about to happen next. So no lack of conviction on behalf of the miners.
00:02:48.382 - 00:03:02.486, Speaker A: David, why should we care about hash rate? It's always been like a metric that's kind of close to the bottom of my list of things I personally look up. I like to look at minor revenue, that sort of thing. But hashrate matters, right? Why does it matter?
00:03:02.588 - 00:03:44.526, Speaker B: Yeah. Hash rate is like the shield around bitcoin, right? And also around ethereum during its proof of work phase, right? It's the height of the wall that any attacker has to get over, and you are, as a minor, compensated for being a part of that wall. Right. Adding a brick to the wall. And also what hash rate is a really good signal of is skin in the game bets, right? So nobody has more at stake with regards to the bitcoin price than miners do. Right? So miners are the most convicted party in bitcoin's system, right? And so paying attention to what miners are doing is really important, and what miners are doing are accumulating more mining hash power, which is why hash power is at an all time high. So miners are bullish.
00:03:44.718 - 00:04:05.882, Speaker A: So we've got bitcoin price above ten k, around 11,500. We've got eth price at $380. So they're both kind of hanging in range, but haven't had a precipitous fall lately. Pretty bullish, I would say. At least they're hanging in there. Through some of this market uncertainty. Let's talk about total locked value.
00:04:05.882 - 00:04:25.006, Speaker A: That's another metric that we like to look at, particularly in DFI. So you can look at it in two ways. The first is total locked value of us dollars. We're at 11.3 billion right now. This is like super close to our all time high total locked value in DFI protocols. What does that mean?
00:04:25.108 - 00:04:52.630, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the total was, the peak was 12.2 or something, and then DFI took a big tumble. But the fact that we are still at eleven plus, I think, is so bullish. Yield farming seems to have taken a backseat. All the liquidity mining is paused. People aren't like, cropping up farms left and right, yet the total value locked in DeFi continues to just march up a goddamn mountain. It does not seem like it's a mountain.
00:04:52.630 - 00:04:53.762, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:04:53.836 - 00:04:59.478, Speaker A: This is crazy. Like, if you zoom out and see the one year on this, it is charging up that mountain.
00:04:59.574 - 00:05:14.570, Speaker B: Yeah. And maybe I'm biased, but I think that if we can just extrapolate what that slope looks like so much further, many, many more months into the future. So I'm excited for when DFI us dollar value locked in DFI breaks 100 billion in 2021.
00:05:14.660 - 00:05:40.518, Speaker A: All right, so that's hanging in there. Even though DFI assets themselves have experienced some decline recently, some as high as 50% or more. Also, ETH locked in DFI is hanging in there, too. So there's 8.7 million eth locked in DFI. That's around, like, 78% of all of ether supply is now locked, and that's hanging pretty steady. I would say that's bullish for our thesis around economic bandwidth, wouldn't you?
00:05:40.684 - 00:06:01.310, Speaker B: Absolutely. And I'm going to be really interested to see what happens when staking goes live. I don't think it'll have much impact at the start, but for some reason, I feel like ETH staking is actually going to add more ether into DeFi because of the yields that are possible to be able to be extracted by DFI based on the fact that ether staking offers yields in the first place.
00:06:01.460 - 00:06:13.426, Speaker A: We also have tornado cash, which is doing more and more. This is a private solution for private transactions. On Ethereum, they did 2.7 million in volume last week. That's pretty good.
00:06:13.608 - 00:06:21.686, Speaker B: Right? So what we're looking at here is how many people are using tornado cash at a 24 hours level. Right?
00:06:21.788 - 00:06:27.400, Speaker A: So it was 24 hours, not 2.7 million in 24 hours. Wow. Okay.
00:06:29.050 - 00:06:58.562, Speaker B: There were 66 transactions that put 100 ether into the 100 ether batch in tornado cash, which means that you can hide in a crowd of 66 other people with 100 ether and then come out of that crowd, like, totally obfuscated. And that you can stay in that crowd for as long as you want. So, like, it's 66 people the one day, and then it's going to be 120 the next day, 180 the next day. But the crowd in tornado cache is really strong. And so this is a privacy tool.
00:06:58.616 - 00:06:58.930, Speaker A: Right.
00:06:59.000 - 00:07:07.122, Speaker B: We need a lot of ether and we need a lot of people in tornado cash as this thing that can help people enter and exit in a private manner.
00:07:07.266 - 00:07:33.718, Speaker A: David, we just hit our time for the market section. One last thing I'll throw out is in the bankless newsletter, Benjamin Cohen published a brilliant piece on when bitcoin move moon that sort of predicts the longer term of bitcoin using his predictive models and data sites. Fantastic piece. Check that out. We'll include it in the show notes today. Let's get to the next topic, what got released this week. We've got five more minutes on that.
00:07:33.718 - 00:07:35.246, Speaker A: What should we start with?
00:07:35.428 - 00:07:47.390, Speaker B: I think we should start with the protocol sync thesis, which is uniswap on Tradingview. I'm not sure this is kind of an atypical protocol sync thesis take, but I think it fits. I'm counting it. Are you counting it?
00:07:47.460 - 00:07:50.610, Speaker A: I'm counting it. But what is trading view for people who haven't used it?
00:07:50.680 - 00:08:18.230, Speaker B: Yeah, Tradingview is kind of the go to place to look at charts, right? And they have charts from all different markets, all different assets, and are definitely leading the world with crypto charts. And they integrated their first decks with Uniswap. So now you can use Uniswap or use trading view to chart things on. You know, I've noticed a ton of traders who have gotten into the defi space in the last three or four months. I'm sure they are absolutely stoked about this release.
00:08:18.310 - 00:08:50.786, Speaker A: Yeah, this is a mainstream kind of trading graphing and analytics piece of software that everyone uses. If you're trading stocks, if you're trading bonds, no matter what you're trading, it's like universally used and it's absolutely fantastic. And now they are integrating Uniswap. So if you type in Uniswap, you get to see all of the high. I think this is rated by the most liquidity of markets on uniswap. It's like, just like an exchange. Just as they would incorporate a centralized exchange, now they're incorporating Uniswap.
00:08:50.786 - 00:09:06.986, Speaker A: I'd say that's compelling evidence for the protocol sync thesis, which basically states that these incredibly neutral protocols will kind of sink to the bottom and become the basis of a lot of other things. What else should we talk about in the new releases? What else happened?
00:09:07.088 - 00:09:27.866, Speaker B: Something that's pretty cool is that wifey and balancer governance, or has been added to maker collateral or. I think there's a governance vote for this. And so if you are a wifi holder, or if you're a balancer holder, and maybe you are also an MKR holder, you should go vote in the maker governance to get your Wi fi or balancer integrated as collateral in Makerdao.
00:09:27.978 - 00:09:38.898, Speaker A: It's good to see those defi capital assets in there instead of something like USDC, which is like a centralized stablecoin. I'm glad maker is moving in that direction now. The better assets are on Ethereum.
00:09:38.994 - 00:09:39.762, Speaker B: Agreed.
00:09:39.906 - 00:09:45.670, Speaker A: All right, Danny Ryan's got something. So bounty program for eth two. What's that about?
00:09:45.820 - 00:10:12.222, Speaker B: Yeah, so this is an open invitation for people who want to try and filibuster eth two. And so if you think you can find. I don't want to. To stop e two, there is a bounty available. I believe there's a $50,000 reward for a critical bug discovery. And so there's a bunch of different things that you can try and figure out how to poke holes in Ethereum, and there's a bunch of financial rewards to do this. Right.
00:10:12.222 - 00:10:22.258, Speaker B: And so, really good to see this out and running. This is starting to generate that honeypot where it says, like, I dare you to crack east two. You can't do it. I dare you.
00:10:22.344 - 00:10:37.730, Speaker A: Hopefully we iron those things out. This is a good way to do a bug bounty. Also, this was huge, man. Metamask, the wallet. Everyone in DFI, everyone on the bankless journey uses metamask. They just exceeded 1 million users. Not just users, monthly active users.
00:10:37.730 - 00:10:44.330, Speaker A: That means there are 1 million monthly active users of DFI protocols. That's pretty huge.
00:10:44.480 - 00:11:21.986, Speaker B: That's huge. And I think this is a much better metric than the Uni airdrop. Right? So the uni airdrop happened to 150,000 wallets, which means, like, 150,000 people interacted with Uniswap. But I had more than one wallet, and so we should probably cut that number in at least by half. But this is different. This is monthly active users, and so not fewer people have multiple computers that they use metamask on, and most people just have one. And so I'm going to go ahead and call this as pretty accurate data for how often people use Ethereum or, excuse me, how many different people use Ethereum.
00:11:21.986 - 00:11:24.518, Speaker B: So fantastic numbers showing by the metamask team.
00:11:24.604 - 00:11:43.486, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. They're also rolling out a swap, which is pretty cool. Hopefully. We're going to talk more about that next week. We've got two other things, David, but we've got, like, 30 seconds, so I'm going to cover this one really quick. This is the zinc and testnet. This is e two testnet that rolled out without a hitch, which is a good sign that eth two is going to be coming.
00:11:43.486 - 00:11:55.858, Speaker A: I guess the next thing we're really waiting for is a release date from the Eth two dev team. So bullish there. Also, you wanted to talk about the block and their new metrics that they rolled out. What's cool here?
00:11:55.944 - 00:12:25.478, Speaker B: Yeah, the block just rolled out their on chain metrics page, really stepping into the world of data like chain visualizations and chain data. So they have bitcoin and ethereum. They also have, and I think they're really leading the game here. They also have stats on stable coins, stats on, on chain lending, stats on amms and dexes and volume. And so I think this is going to maybe become my go to spot to see data about Ethereum.
00:12:25.574 - 00:12:36.318, Speaker A: Yeah, I need to totally dig into this. This is fantastic. We'll include a link in the show notes. All right. We've done market, we've done releases. We're doing okay on time. We've got five more minutes, maybe four for news.
00:12:36.318 - 00:12:39.022, Speaker A: What's in the news? Where do you want to start?
00:12:39.156 - 00:13:01.606, Speaker B: I think the big thing is grayscale. Grayscale just reported their biggest quarter ever, which is a piece of news that we are coming to be used to from Grayscale, as this is the third quarter in a row that they have posted their biggest quarter ever. Right. And so they have experienced over a billion dollars of flows into their crypto. That's a really big number.
00:13:01.708 - 00:13:02.710, Speaker A: That's a big number.
00:13:02.780 - 00:13:33.706, Speaker B: The Ethereum market cap is $40 billion. And so like, one 40th of Ethereum is flowed through grayscale in just one quarter of a year. Right. I think the numbers that stood out to me is that every week, on average, $55 billion gets put into grayscale, into the bitcoin trust, and 15 and $.6 million per week gets added to the Ethereum trust every single week. That's how much people are buying of these assets using grayscale as, like, I don't know what to call them. Like an intermediary.
00:13:33.818 - 00:13:55.126, Speaker A: Yeah. I don't love grayscale because of the fees, but I do love that they are onboarding, basically the institutions people always talk about. When are the institutions coming? Well, they're here. They're doing a billion a quarter into crypto money protocols. I think that's super bullish. You can buy grayscale assets, of course, in your fidelity account. So it's connected that way.
00:13:55.126 - 00:14:04.540, Speaker A: So it's not bankless, but it's a decent way to onboard into a at least central bankless monetary system. So bullish news there.
00:14:05.150 - 00:14:06.694, Speaker B: Distinction. I like that distinction.
00:14:06.822 - 00:14:20.106, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, so let's talk about something that's maybe less bullish, which is the dog. So the Department of Justice released an 83 page crypto framework. I haven't read all 83 pages.
00:14:20.138 - 00:14:38.980, Speaker B: Have you? I don't know. I have not. And I don't intend to. However, the very front page is worth reading. And also, Jake Shavinsky put a great tweet thread together, which really distills down the whole thing. So he read it and he did the legwork for you. So we recommend that tweet thread to go understand what the hell they're talking.
00:14:39.510 - 00:14:56.906, Speaker A: And we had Jake on, I guess, a couple of weeks ago on stay of the nation. He was fantastic. Like, listen to that. Yep. And we talk about those themes, but I just want to maybe pull up one of his tweet threads here. This is kind of the takeaway. So Jake is.
00:14:56.906 - 00:15:38.278, Speaker A: He's optimistic, but he's also, I guess, understands the risk. He works in DC, understands the risk of what could be happening. And he said, sort of on the back of some of the actions of the doga. I fear we're heading into a world where withdrawing crypto from exchanges to self custody is restricted as a means of attacking privacy. That means you wouldn't be able to withdraw from your exchange without that exchange being AML Kyc identified. That would mean we'd have two separate crypto markets, one for clean coins and another for dirty self sovereign runs, the bankless coins and the clean coins that are regulator approved. That is not a world that I want to live in.
00:15:38.278 - 00:15:54.350, Speaker A: That feels very authoritarian. That could be the case if our boomer lawmakers who don't understand this stuff get their way. So that is something that Jake and crew are fighting against, but we have to be vigilant on this. Yeah. Anything else you'd say on that?
00:15:54.420 - 00:16:18.066, Speaker B: Yeah, just to put an image into people's minds, think of what they are proposing is that bitcoin ether? These assets are here, but we can still gate how people use them. Right. So imagine, like, Coinbase or PayPal. They let you buy and send bitcoin, but they only let you buy and send bitcoin to people that also have a PayPal account. Right. That's what Jake fears is, and that just ruins the whole point of crypto. Right.
00:16:18.066 - 00:16:23.074, Speaker B: And so let it be known there is a war coming that we are going to have to fight in this industry.
00:16:23.202 - 00:16:42.038, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. And I do think the D five protocols are the surest bet. We have the best hope we have of that, of this system not becoming totally banked. Hey, we've got 30 seconds for this last one. China is doing an airdrop. What's that about? They're airdropping their fiat to some of their citizens.
00:16:42.134 - 00:17:13.254, Speaker B: Yeah. Let it be known that everyone loved uniswap. When Uniswap airdropped them, their currency. So this is a really strong move by China. The first one to get out the gate with is central bank digital currency. One thing I read about in a book recently is how the west doesn't pay attention to the technology going on in China, but China absolutely pays attention to the technology going on in the west. And so we are a huge disadvantage with informational asymmetry between what we are doing versus what China is doing.
00:17:13.254 - 00:17:27.334, Speaker B: China knows what's up, and we're not watching them. China has a central bank digital currency that is going directly to its citizens phones, which, I mean, bullish for crypto, bullish for adoption, also really bullish for authoritarianism.
00:17:27.462 - 00:17:28.140, Speaker A: Right.
00:17:29.390 - 00:17:38.234, Speaker B: What I'm worried about is China using this airdrop money, or the MMT, that's inevitably coming as a tool for compliance.
00:17:38.362 - 00:18:08.210, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, so you just open up your wallet, right? They make it super easy. You press a few buttons, and you get an airdrop free money from the government, right to your account just for adopting this new digital. I wouldn't call it a cryptocurrency. It's a digital money, but it's completely centrally controlled by China. They can freeze your account. Obviously, it's the chinese currency, so the central bank controls all of that. Definitely not what we mean when we say crypto, but in a way, they're very smart for moving in this direction.
00:18:08.210 - 00:18:15.578, Speaker A: David. Okay, so we've gone through news. Those are the top news items. We have less time, but some hot takes. What's on your mind?
00:18:15.744 - 00:18:27.646, Speaker B: Yeah, what is on my mind? I think the first thing that's on my mind is what you and I are calling the tweet heard around the world. I think it's a fantastic and very illustrative tweet. Ryan, you wanted to give us the.
00:18:27.668 - 00:19:09.674, Speaker A: Sit rep with this know, pomp, like, tweeted something out. Like, Anthony Pompliano, who has a podcast, is fairly well known in the space big podcast, and he tweeted something out and basically said uncle Jeff could shut this whole thing down. This whole thing meaning ethereum, Jeff Bezos, and all Defi, if he wanted to, because he was implying that all of Defi was somehow hosted in aws. I don't engage with those types of tweets. Know, possibly Papa's doing it for engagement himself. So I generally don't respond to kind of trolling, but someone tagged me, and it was like, hey, Ryan, is this true? Right. And it felt like that individual earnestly wanted to know.
00:19:09.674 - 00:19:41.622, Speaker A: So I said, no, it's not true. In fact, it's bullshit. And then pomp kind of replied in thread and sort of challenged me on that. And he was like, hey, if the government threatened to arrest Hayden, who is the founder and primary developer of Uniswap, you don't think the government could shut it down? And then that's when Hayden popped in and he said this, and he totally ratioed on the tweet. That means he got more tweets than pump on this. It's an immutable, smart contract on ethereum. I have no ability to turn it off.
00:19:41.622 - 00:19:46.200, Speaker A: I could try tweeting, can everyone please stop trading, though? But that wouldn't, obviously.
00:19:46.970 - 00:20:14.394, Speaker B: Yeah. So people who aren't in Twitter culture to ratio someone means that your comment to their tweet outdoes them in likes. And when you are commenting below them, you are deprioritized by Twitter because it's a thread. But. So that means when you get more likes than that person, it's a big deal because your comment was so good that it ratioed that person. And pomp's tweet has 53 likes and Hayden Adams has 2300 likes.
00:20:14.442 - 00:20:16.174, Speaker A: That's brutal. I've never seen a ratio that.
00:20:16.212 - 00:20:17.374, Speaker B: Most brutal ratio of.
00:20:17.412 - 00:20:26.260, Speaker A: Not in crypto. Yeah. So, I mean, what that means is a lot of people saw Hayden's tweet and were like, yeah, that's true. And retweeted it.
00:20:26.630 - 00:20:31.558, Speaker B: Imagine this happened in the bear market in 2018. That would have never happened.
00:20:31.644 - 00:20:38.600, Speaker A: No, it was a maximalist agenda. It was lots of different lies about things and, yeah, that would have never happened.
00:20:39.690 - 00:20:40.294, Speaker B: People coming.
00:20:40.332 - 00:20:41.526, Speaker A: D five is back, baby. Yeah.
00:20:41.628 - 00:20:42.518, Speaker B: People waking up.
00:20:42.604 - 00:20:58.046, Speaker A: Exactly. People waking up. It's a good sign to me. All right, let's talk about the next thing. Speaking of waking up, I don't know how to take this. I'm super bullish by it in a way, but I'm also question mark. So we just talked about the oppressive government cracking down on things.
00:20:58.046 - 00:21:26.150, Speaker A: And this is the CFTC chair attending a conference that you just attended as well, and you just spoke at. But he said, let me basically say how impressed I am by Ethereum, full stop. This is chairman Heath, a CFTC chairman. He said this in an Ethereum investment conference hosted by Coindesk. If you play the video a bit more, he also says he's super bullish on DeFi. Actually. He actually thinks it could have the potential to disrupt finance.
00:21:26.150 - 00:21:43.626, Speaker A: So what do you make of this? Right here's CFTC. They just came out with an action against Bitmex. But a chairman saying, I am super bullish on DeFi and Ethereum is the next Internet. Bitcoin was a one trick pony. Ethereum is the next Internet. What does this mean?
00:21:43.728 - 00:22:08.466, Speaker B: Yeah, well, as a bitcoiner, that's literally the last thing you want to hear. I am cautiously optimistic, but more on the optimistic than the cautious side. I think what I'm hopeful and optimistic that Heath means when he says that he is impressed by Ethereum is, like, exactly the opposite of what Bitmex is. Right. CFTC just took down Bitmex for being a black box that trades against their customers. Right. And also violating the bank Secrecy act, which also, I guess, DeFi doesn't really solve.
00:22:08.466 - 00:22:33.478, Speaker B: But what Defi does solve is it's the opposite of a black box. It's completely transparent and it doesn't even not trade against its customers. It can't trade against its customers. So I'm hoping that Heath is seeing that value proposition in Defi saying, like, oh, where Google had its tagline, don't be evil. Defi has its tagline, can't be evil. Right. I think that's what he's referring to and why he's impressed by Ethereum.
00:22:33.574 - 00:22:52.754, Speaker A: Yeah, it is bullish. I do think we might have an ally in the CFTC. We'll see if we have an ally in Finzen, which is the group in the government that provides more regulation to anti money laundering and KYC type of things. All right, last thing.
00:22:52.792 - 00:23:01.918, Speaker B: What I'm cautious about is know Heath sees the transparency of Ethereum as a really easy tool to regulate people. That's my bearish take on.
00:23:02.024 - 00:23:16.554, Speaker A: Yeah, and that could be the case. Which is, I wonder what he'd think of tornado cash in that case. And also aztec. Dude, we should jump on that real quick. So scaling solutions are coming out like mad. There were like three that just announced last week. We don't have time to talk about them all.
00:23:16.554 - 00:23:41.818, Speaker A: In fact, I don't have time to fully grasp them all. It's going to be sort of a survival of the fittest. All of these layer two roll ups on Ethereum are going to compete. They're probably going to compete not with Ethereum, of course, but directly against the so called Eth killers and other layer one solutions. But here's the graph with a scalable state channel. Layer two on Ethereum, here is matter labs. This is curve plus Zk sync.
00:23:41.818 - 00:24:08.650, Speaker A: And here's Aztec, the one I read the most about and most excited about, which is a whole layer two scalability solution. Yeah, but also all the transactions are private. And there's some way to actually use privacy on Ethereum main chain. I haven't read the details. Need to investigate more. In fact, maybe we'll ask italic next week when we talk to him. But yeah, these layer two solutions, the scalability solutions, are coming out like crazy.
00:24:08.650 - 00:24:09.498, Speaker A: What does that mean?
00:24:09.584 - 00:24:26.286, Speaker B: Yeah, and what's also interesting is that there seems to be every single defi application has its own chosen scalability solution, which kind of makes you think, like, what's left on the main chain. I think what's left on the main chain is just like packets of settlement of settlements.
00:24:26.398 - 00:24:26.770, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:24:26.840 - 00:24:45.618, Speaker B: Right. It's no longer uniswap is like 70% of the main chain now. It's just like the settlements between these applications are what make up the main chain. So that's really interesting, and I think that's going to be a really interesting conversation that we have with Vitalik, who's coming on the podcast where we talk about a roll up centric version of Ethereum.
00:24:45.714 - 00:24:54.346, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. All right, that's takes. Let's end with this. David, what are you most excited about? What's going on in your mind? That's super exciting these days?
00:24:54.448 - 00:25:27.634, Speaker B: Well, since it is Friday when you guys are hearing this, what I am excited about is the ETH online Defi summit. We are experimenting in the world of virtual conferences, how to pace them, and I think ETH online is doing a really good job of doing. They are Fridays, so one day a week they have a slate of topics picked out, which is nice. Instead of just like bundling everything in four days, they're spreading it out over a month. So really good job. There's a bunch of cool talkers who I'm going to be attending. I'm probably just going to sit in my chair and watch it all day tomorrow.
00:25:27.634 - 00:25:30.742, Speaker B: I'm pretty excited about that. Ryan, what are you excited about?
00:25:30.876 - 00:25:38.262, Speaker A: I'm excited about the ethanline. When you click the radio button, you hear this, like, super chill music, and it's just relaxing. So you just pop up the browser and just listen to it.
00:25:38.316 - 00:25:40.794, Speaker B: Yeah, but definitely trent behind that one, I'm going to guess.
00:25:40.832 - 00:26:07.630, Speaker A: Yeah. But more seriously, I am excited about tokens. DFI tokens in general. Right? We came off of a crazy quarter last quarter, and Lucas Campbell, a bankless analyst, put out a fantastic Q three report of DFI tokens. So you got to check this out. It's published on bankless right now, 27 x increase in revenue. All right.
00:26:07.630 - 00:26:30.570, Speaker A: Okay, so we're not talking about hype, price increase, blah, blah, blah. This is revenue. So again, DFI tokens, what are they? They're future capital assets. Right. And what kind of revenue are these capital assets generating? Well, 108,000,000 last quarter. Okay, that was a 26 x increase from the previous quarter. Yeah.
00:26:30.570 - 00:26:59.714, Speaker A: Some of this was from yield, farming mania, blah blah, blah, et cetera. But that kind of growth is absolutely massive and it's going to go down next quarter, but it's not going to go down completely. We're going to have a higher low, if you will. So that means what do we have in Defi? Well, we have capital assets that are actually producing cash flows. Seems super investable if you're a wall street analyst and you're looking at this space. So check out the report. Read that.
00:26:59.714 - 00:27:11.414, Speaker A: I'm bullish on that. I'm bullish that we've created on chain capital assets and we're actually seeing them like 108,000,000 in revenue in one quarter. That's on track for half a billion annualized. It's not bad.
00:27:11.532 - 00:27:24.874, Speaker B: Ryan, I think you might have jumped the gun on is going to go down next quarter. I'm not too sure about that, but I will say that Q three 2020 looks different than all other queues. Different.
00:27:25.072 - 00:27:34.190, Speaker A: This is definitely a quarter to remember and we'll see about that. All right, David, we're at time. Anything else you want to leave with with excitement? Anything else you're excited about?
00:27:34.260 - 00:28:06.322, Speaker B: Yeah, the last thing I'm excited about is seeing what happens to the ether price as the execution risk of ethereum 2.0 starts to dwindle. Right, so we are in the very final stages of the testnet for phase zero. The Spinalda testnet is up and live, which is the mock trial for the deposit contract. And we are expecting the deposit contract to get announced any day now. And basically what has to happen between now and phase zero launching is basically nothing. It just needs to continue as planned.
00:28:06.386 - 00:28:06.614, Speaker A: Right.
00:28:06.652 - 00:28:20.938, Speaker B: So things need to not change in order for phase zero to go live. And when a lot of investors who have always been bearish about e two, saying e two is never going to come here, we're going to start tearing down that wall every now and then.
00:28:21.024 - 00:28:30.400, Speaker A: Yeah. Sentiment is going to reverse. The common motif is that e two will never ship. Well, what happens when it shifts, when it ships? We're about to find out.
00:28:31.170 - 00:28:35.098, Speaker B: That is on the horizon, David. You can almost taste the capitulation.
00:28:35.194 - 00:28:45.422, Speaker A: You can almost taste it. Absolutely. And we hope you are enjoying it. Tastes like victory. We'll see know. Let's let it. You know we're going to celebrate hard when that launches.
00:28:45.486 - 00:28:46.258, Speaker B: Oh yeah.
00:28:46.424 - 00:29:11.034, Speaker A: David, this has been awesome. Our first episode of roll ups around. We hope you are enjoying your Friday morning. We hope this caught you up on all of the market releases, news, hot takes, and what David and I are personally excited about. So once again, we will release these every Friday morning on YouTube if you like it in video form and also on the podcast for audio. Thanks for joining us. I think we've kept it time.
00:29:11.034 - 00:29:30.302, Speaker A: We've done a pretty good job. Of course, none of this is financial advice. This is the journey west. As we've said, be careful about these defi protocols and crypto in general. You could lose what you put in. This is not for everyone, but you're listening because you're on the bankless journey. Thanks for joining us and also people.
00:29:30.356 - 00:29:35.126, Speaker B: Listening on the podcast. There are plenty of visuals on the YouTube as well, so do know that.
00:29:35.268 - 00:29:38.260, Speaker A: Do note that with that, we're signing off.
