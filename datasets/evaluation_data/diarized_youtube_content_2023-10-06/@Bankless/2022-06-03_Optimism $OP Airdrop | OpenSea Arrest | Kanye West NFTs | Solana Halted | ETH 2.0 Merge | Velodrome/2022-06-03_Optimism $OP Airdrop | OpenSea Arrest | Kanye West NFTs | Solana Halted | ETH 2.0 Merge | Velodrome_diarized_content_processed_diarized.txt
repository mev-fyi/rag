00:00:00.170 - 00:00:09.114, Speaker A: Yet we persevere nonetheless through the beer market. Bankless nation.
00:00:09.162 - 00:00:12.222, Speaker B: It is the last week of May. David, what time is it?
00:00:12.276 - 00:00:34.200, Speaker A: It's the Friday bankless weekly roll up time, Ryan, where we cover the entire news in crypto, which is always an ambitious endeavor, yet we persevere nonetheless, through the beer market. No, I was going to say bear market, but then I remembered it's actually a build market and it always will be a build market. And so, yeah, we're persevering, right?
00:00:34.730 - 00:00:56.446, Speaker B: What a great intro, David. Guys, we come out with these every Friday. This is the fastest way to get your fix in crypto, get your ingestion on what's going on in the markets, the releases, the news, the price action. We cover it all here. Remember, grab your morning coffee, enjoy this with us because it comes out every Friday morning. David, we got some hot topics this week. What are we going to cover?
00:00:56.548 - 00:01:10.558, Speaker A: Yeah, some stuff happened this week, Ryan, and we're going to talk about it because that's what we do every Friday. The optimism token is live and trading, and that's what gets everyone super excited. So, of course is what we're going to talk about. Did you get your op tokens? Did you get your op tokens, Ryan?
00:01:10.654 - 00:01:12.594, Speaker B: I did as many as I could find.
00:01:12.632 - 00:01:55.630, Speaker A: I'm still scouring wallets. I still have a couple extra wallets to check. Yeah, so we got the metrics comparable to the uni airdrop in size. So we're going to compare the optimism airdrop to previous airdrops as well as some other airdrops that have come hot on the heels of optimism. So there's not only the optimism token airdrop to check, there's another one, which we're going to talk about after that. After we get done writing the highs of the optimism token, we're going to ride some lows of a former OpenC employee who got arrested for insider trading. This is the same story that came out like months and months and months ago, but this individual actually got arrested and faces up to a maximum of 20 years in jail, which is ridiculous.
00:01:55.630 - 00:01:58.558, Speaker A: Yeah. What's your quick take on that one, Ryan?
00:01:58.734 - 00:02:24.938, Speaker B: Well, you know what? I'm going to tease my take, okay. So you'll have to listen to my take midway through the roll up to hear what I think about this issue. So I'm not. No spoiling. All right, David, we're also going to talk about the merge update. Are we there yet? Everyone in the backseat of the car that Justin Drake and Vitalik are driving asking are we there yet. Guys, when are we going to get the merge? Is it coming in August? Is it coming in September? We're going to talk about that too.
00:02:24.938 - 00:02:28.102, Speaker B: Also, Kanye west doing some trademark stuff with nfts.
00:02:28.166 - 00:02:30.230, Speaker A: Kanye west has entered the chat.
00:02:30.390 - 00:02:49.934, Speaker B: Yeah, he's coming. As always, make sure you like or subscribe to this. Of course, if you're watching on YouTube, make sure you subscribe. Hit that like button if you're listening on the podcast, thank you for doing that as well. Rate and review. Don't forget to do that. Whether it's Spotify, Apple, wherever you listen to your podcasts, leave those rates, ratings and reviews.
00:02:49.934 - 00:02:58.486, Speaker B: Ideally like five know as high as you want to get bankless. But I feel know we put these on every Friday, so we deserve something. We deserve at least above four.
00:02:58.588 - 00:03:02.102, Speaker A: At least above four. There's only one option above four.
00:03:02.236 - 00:03:47.986, Speaker B: There you go. All right, guys, before we get in, wanted to tell you a little bit about our friends at Metamask. Of course, everybody uses the metamask wallet. I use this on a daily basis, right? Just used it to claim my op airdrop tokens. But did you know, David, this is a button I hadn't seen very often in Metamask just because I'm doing other things. But there is a big blue buy button in the middle of metamask where you can actually refill your wallet with ETH, with any crypto asset you so desire. It's much faster way to get crypto directly into your metamask wallet because you don't have to do the thing where you got to connect your bank account to an exchange like Coinbase and then transfer all of that back to Metamask.
00:03:47.986 - 00:04:12.470, Speaker B: That's like a three four step process, and it gets really costly. Once you go the Ach transfer, it takes days. And then you do the Coinbase exchange, and then by the time you're in metamask, you didn't even know why you wanted the EtH in the wallet in the first place. So this is a handy buy button. I'm going to click this here. You can use transact, you can use moonpay, you can use wire. I'm told this also works in mobile.
00:04:12.470 - 00:04:22.250, Speaker B: I have not used it. Look at this, David. Put in your credit card, put in your Apple Pay, put in your google pay, and just get your eth right embedded in metmask.
00:04:22.330 - 00:04:38.182, Speaker A: And I actually use this a lot when I just need some gas, especially for claiming airdrops on old wallets that I haven't touched in years. But I got to go claim an airdrop. And I need to get gas into that wallet, but I don't want to dox my wallet. So this is actually when I use this. Also use Apple Pay to get that 2% cash back on your Eth buy, which is nice.
00:04:38.236 - 00:05:02.218, Speaker B: You know what's crazy, David, is I haven't even noticed that button. Which is probably why Metamask wants us to spread awareness that the buy button exists. Super handy for wallets. Old wallets. Or you're claiming airdrops, you don't have any etH, and yet you need, like, $20 worth of ETH in order to make that claim. So one click buy in Metamask. Of course, you can navigate to metamask at bankless Cc buy.
00:05:02.218 - 00:05:11.438, Speaker B: Download the metamask app, and use that buy button next time you need some eth in your wallet. David, let's get the markets, man. What's bitcoin price telling us?
00:05:11.524 - 00:05:24.302, Speaker A: Bitcoin up just a smidge. Up 2% on the week. Started the week just below 30,000, and is ending the week just above 30,000. So 29,500, ending at 30,270. Sweet.
00:05:24.446 - 00:05:30.050, Speaker B: Up 2%. Anything above 30k, I'm feeling okay, I guess. Eth price.
00:05:30.120 - 00:05:33.398, Speaker A: Last time we said that was going.
00:05:33.404 - 00:05:47.146, Speaker B: To hold, and the last time I said it about EtH, it was above three k. I'm feeling good. I'm not feeling good. Under three k. It's definitely a b market, right? Build market below. But what are we hitting on ETH this week? We up or down?
00:05:47.328 - 00:06:06.574, Speaker A: ETH took a little bit of a hit this week. Started the week at 1950, ended the week at 1820. So sad. ETH noises this week. So down 6% versus bitcoin is up 2% on the week. Some kind of funny counting just on the timing of these things. If it was like a one day shifted, it would be a different number.
00:06:06.574 - 00:06:08.706, Speaker A: So that's how I'm coping this week.
00:06:08.888 - 00:06:12.754, Speaker B: Well, how are you coping with this ratio? What are we looking at on the week?
00:06:12.872 - 00:06:28.070, Speaker A: Yeah, so we got the 30,000 line for bitcoin, we got the 2000 line for ETH, and we got the six line for the ETH BTC ratio, which is where we are at right now. Zero. 600:33, keeping its head above water, allegedly.
00:06:28.970 - 00:06:58.126, Speaker B: Look, this is a great bear market predictor. I feel like, are we in a bear? The indicator is if the ratio is down. If it's low, we're more likely to be in a bear market. If it's high, we're more likely to be in a bull market. And look, this is off of May. We've certainly dropped quite a bit from zero point 76 range all the way down to 0.6. So I guess that tells us everything we need to know about the current market conditions.
00:06:58.158 - 00:07:09.400, Speaker A: David sad east noises total crypto market cap is flat at 1.3 trillion last week to 1.3 trillion this week. So overall, the market did nothing.
00:07:10.170 - 00:07:34.480, Speaker B: Nothing. I'll take it. I mean, a flat week is better than a down week, right? Did you know this FTX just surpassed Coinbase as the second biggest centralized crypto exchange? That just happened last month. FTX was always gunning for number two, binance, of course, in first place, but now it's binance, FTX and Coinbase in third. What are your thoughts on this? You think this will?
00:07:36.370 - 00:08:06.790, Speaker A: I mean, FTX's trajectory has always been gaining more and more and more market share, and to be honest, I kind of don't really count binance. Maybe that's just like my western United States citizen bias, but binance is not going to play nice with regulators in the long term. And so I kind of have discounted the value of binance in my head, that's definitely probably bias. But for all the regulated onshore exchanges that are us regulator approved now, FTX is number one. And so that's kind of how I count things in my head.
00:08:06.940 - 00:08:19.126, Speaker B: Yeah. You really got to hand it to SBF, right? I mean, he's built this business over the past three years. It's not very old. FTX is not very old at all. And here it's taking the number two slot from coin.
00:08:19.318 - 00:08:25.582, Speaker A: Look at that chart, like, going from July 2019. That blue line just going up. That's crazy.
00:08:25.716 - 00:08:29.658, Speaker B: Yeah. Look at this market share of legitimate volume. Spot exchange.
00:08:29.834 - 00:08:32.798, Speaker A: Definitely not the only one with this stuff.
00:08:32.964 - 00:08:35.966, Speaker B: Yeah, right. How about this next thing?
00:08:35.988 - 00:08:47.790, Speaker A: Wait, also, yeah, for the record, they only had finance us in there. They did not have actual finance in there. And so it looks like the block shares my opinion as to the illegitimacy of finance.
00:08:47.870 - 00:09:00.086, Speaker B: Let's see. The dominant player in the market is still finance by far, which is 64%, followed by FTX 10% and Coinbase 9%. Look at how dominant finance, 64%.
00:09:00.268 - 00:09:02.600, Speaker A: That has got to be wash trading, right?
00:09:03.070 - 00:09:28.002, Speaker B: Look, man, finance is a juggernaut outside of the US. It is absolutely massive. I discount some of this as maybe watch trade or something different, but not all of it. Finance is definitely a juggernaut in the space. Expanding everywhere, too. Gemini, another exchange. I guess they would come in number like, would they come in number four, number five, something to that effect.
00:09:28.136 - 00:09:31.922, Speaker A: Gemini light blue. Yeah, I think that's third.
00:09:32.056 - 00:10:02.614, Speaker B: The Winklevoss twins, Gemini. They are laying off 10% of staff right now, and the headline is, to prepare for crypto winter. Here's the quote on Gemini's blog. The crypto revolution is well underway, and its impact will continue to be profound, the Winklevoss brothers wrote. But its trajectory has been anything but gradual or predictable. These are seasoned vets who've been through a few bear markets in crypto, and they're getting ahead of this by actually cutting some of their staff. Now, what do you make of this, David?
00:10:02.742 - 00:10:32.242, Speaker A: Yeah, so Gemini is a very saturated company, right? It's been around, and so it's not like any of these newer projects that still have a ton of growth potential. So it makes more sense for its staffing to follow the whims of the market, right, just because it's already hit its saturation point. So when the bear market does come, that there does have to be cutbacks. There should be cutbacks all the time. We got to cut out the fluff of all companies. So, I mean, only 10% in comparison to 2018 has a big improvement.
00:10:32.386 - 00:10:42.886, Speaker B: Yeah, I do think we are seeing some belt tightening in specific areas. In crypto, certainly there's a ton of hiring still happening, but in other locations, we're starting to see belt tightening, newer.
00:10:42.918 - 00:10:44.966, Speaker A: Stuff hiring and newer stuff layoff.
00:10:44.998 - 00:10:45.338, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:10:45.424 - 00:10:46.060, Speaker A: Stuff.
00:10:46.590 - 00:11:10.798, Speaker B: We've got a lot more to cover, guys. Coming up next, we're going to talk about that optimism. Airdrop. It feels like that Airdrop is kicking off Airdrop summer, which is happening now. Also, the OpenSea insider trading story. Want to cover that? Does the crime fit the punishment? The big question in our mind, we're going to get to both of those stories, but before we do, we want to talk about the sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:11:10.964 - 00:11:50.266, Speaker A: Rocket pool is your friendly, decentralized, Ethereum staking protocol call. You can stake your eth with rocket Pool and get our eth in return, allowing you to stake your ETH and use it in DFI at the same time. You can get 4% on your Eth by staking it with rocket Pool, but you can get even more by running a node. Rocket pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating nodes. Running a rocket pool node is easier to set up than running a solo node, and you only need 16 e to get started. Why would you do this? You get an extra 15% staking commission on the pooled ETH, so your Apy is boosted. So if you're bullish east staking, you can increase your API and get some extra tokens by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pool network, which currently has over a thousand independent validators.
00:11:50.266 - 00:12:16.130, Speaker A: It's yield farming, but with Ethereum nodes you can get started@rocketpool.net and also join the rocket pool community in their discord. You can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat, so I'll see you there. The layer two era is upon us. Ethereum's layer two ecosystem is growing every day and we need bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer two life. Across is the fastest, cheapest and most secure crosschain bridge. With across, you don't have to worry about the long wait times or high fees to get your assets to the chain of your choice.
00:12:16.130 - 00:12:55.538, Speaker A: Assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously. Across bridges are powered by UMA's optimistic oracle to securely transfer tokens from layer two back to ethereum, a token proposal is being deliberated as we speak in the across forum, where community members will decide on the token distribution. You can have your part of across the story by joining the discord and becoming a cofounder and helping to design the fair fair launch of a crops if you want to bridge your assets quickly and securely, go to accrop to to bridge your assets between Ethereum, optimism, arbitram or Boba networks. And we're back. And also diving into optimism. Airdrop summer people got their tokens. Ryan, you're showing an address.
00:12:55.538 - 00:13:32.830, Speaker A: Banks eth got 827 optimism tokens for being a donator to Gitcoin grants on layer one and also a Dow voter. So good job, Ryan. Congrats on your tokens. So the optimism token is launched with a total supply of 4.3 billion tokens, inflating at 2% a year. And the airdrop of 215 total million tokens went to almost a quarter million addresses, 248,699 addresses. For comparison, Ryan, Uniswap was just 2000 more addresses, larger eligible addresses, larger than optimism, coming in at 251,500.
00:13:32.980 - 00:13:43.986, Speaker B: That is fantastic. That is great distribution, right? To get half a million e addresses in this thing. It's just like second in size to uniswap from a distribution perspective. Yeah.
00:13:44.008 - 00:14:25.246, Speaker A: And so people who checked their addresses a couple of weeks ago might notice that they actually got more than they were previously quoted because optimism went through the whole airdrop. Or, excuse me, the airdrop farming. They scalped the farmers. So, like, oh, they identified all the farmers, just like hot protocol did, they pruned them, and so then they redistributed what was going to be given to the farmers, to the rest of the community, which just makes sense. You got to reward the actual true humans, not the farmers. And so, as of right now, 62% of all op tokens have been claimed, with 120,000 addresses having claimed. Okay, this happened in the last day, right? In the last 24 hours from the time of recording, 120,000 addresses.
00:14:25.246 - 00:14:28.834, Speaker A: Not necessarily people, but, like, probably 100,000 people, give or take.
00:14:28.872 - 00:14:30.660, Speaker B: These are bank accounts. Yeah, definitely.
00:14:31.670 - 00:15:12.282, Speaker A: They've claimed tokens, so the participation rate is crazy. And so if we wanted to compare the claiming of optimism versus Uniswap. Uniswap has had 90% of all addresses that were eligible claimed the Uniswap airdrop. So 10% were, like, lost to history, probably. And so if optimism were to reach 90%, that would be 223,000 airdrop claimers. Right now, we are at 120,000, so we have a lot to go. But where Uniswap beat optimism by 2000 eligible addresses, optimism still has room to be the largest airdrop by how many actual people claimed the token.
00:15:12.282 - 00:15:14.670, Speaker A: So that is a good number I'm going to be watching moving forward.
00:15:14.740 - 00:15:54.906, Speaker B: Do you know what's awesome about this is not only claiming the token, you're also claiming it on optimism, you're also claiming it on a layer two. And this reminds me, you know how we always talk about going out west and settling and finding new lands and new in, in the west, in some of the new horizons in the US, they used to just give out parcels of land to individuals to settle there, right? It's like it's the frontier. No one wants to live here. It's going to be a rough life, but here's some land to make it worth your while. Here's why you should move from the east coast and settle into this new land. And that's what's happening with these layer twos. Essentially, you're getting free property if you settle.
00:15:54.906 - 00:16:15.394, Speaker B: If you move from the Ethereum, Mainnet, Manhattan, and you cross the bridge and you settle on the other side, they're giving you free voting rights, responsibility, tokens in the form of op in order to settle here and the op tokens have some value, we should note that what is op trading at right now? And what is the fully diluted market cap?
00:16:15.512 - 00:16:39.302, Speaker A: Yeah, at the time of recording, it's at $1.0.57. Yesterday, it peaked at $2.20 at the height of the mania, also dumped down below $0.60. So we're still in price discovery mode, ranging somewhere between sixty cents and two dollars and twenty cents. Currently at $1.0.57. Fully diluted valuation. If you multiply the price by the total number of four point something billion tokens.
00:16:39.302 - 00:16:59.570, Speaker A: The total supply of optimism tokens, here's a trivia fact for you, is two to the power of 32. That's the total supply. And I guess I can actually just read that out since it's on the screen. The total supply is 4.294 billion tokens coming in at a fully diluted valuation of $6.7 billion. So $6.7
00:16:59.570 - 00:17:20.826, Speaker A: billion just got just created out of thin hair. And comparing that to Maddox, I think Maddox is somewhere in the same ballpark. I think Maddox was like, actually, can you look up the Maddox tokens market cap? Yeah, Maddox market cap, $6.8 billion. Right? Excuse me. That's total luck value, $6.1 billion.
00:17:20.826 - 00:17:24.806, Speaker A: So optimism is higher than Polygon, which is nuts.
00:17:24.838 - 00:17:25.274, Speaker B: Wow.
00:17:25.392 - 00:17:37.150, Speaker A: Which is nuts, because, okay, Polygon's credit, they have done an insane amount of just like, adoption and onboarding and business development. So people are pricing in a lot of optimism into the optimism market cap.
00:17:37.220 - 00:17:48.914, Speaker B: That is true. Now, I will say there's a lot more supply, circulating supply out in the market for matic and polygon versus optimism. The circulating supply is still very small at this point.
00:17:49.032 - 00:18:03.426, Speaker A: Right. And part of that story is because there are many, many more airdrops for optimism coming. That's a part of this conversation. But yeah, this is just airdrop number one. Airdrops two and three and N are on the horizon.
00:18:03.538 - 00:18:08.610, Speaker B: It's super exciting, man. The claim process, by the way, was so easy. I did this with a couple of wallets.
00:18:08.690 - 00:18:33.374, Speaker A: You're only saying it's an easy claiming process because you didn't try and claim it literally at the same exact time as everyone else. There was an actual bunch of drama with the clogging of not the optimism network, but the RPC endpoint, which is a new place to get clogged. We'll talk about that a little bit. But optimism released an airdropped recap thread, which we'll go through because it's got some cool stats and some cool metrics. They say yesterday was an absolute whirlwind. That wasn't without the hiccups. That's reference to the RPC thing.
00:18:33.374 - 00:19:17.774, Speaker A: But to much excitement. OP was born. We'll have an extensive retro on the drop day next week, meaning, meanwhile, we want to share some stats coming out of the launch with over 50% of drop one now claimed. Let's dive in. Optimism hit a couple of major high water marks yesterday. In terms of transaction count, hourly rate peaked at twelve transactions per second, averaging about ten transactions per second, matching Ethereum, while consuming less than 5% of Ethereum's gas. So Ethereum's level of scale, which didn't even come close to completely congesting optimism while consuming less than 5% of ethereum hourly rate, peaked at twelve transactions per second, but spiked to 22 transactions per second.
00:19:17.774 - 00:19:58.038, Speaker A: So people were claiming optimism tokens at a rate of 22 transactions per second, plus doing other things like basic unisop trades. Okay, here's where they, like the drama came in. Ryan, remote procedure calls. RPCs hit an all time high of 20,000 pings per second. And so they write, simply put, these are requests to read network data, and this chart shows our free community endpoint. This includes not just the claims, but Uniswap reads bridging on hop basically anytime. If you've ever loaded up the optimism RPC endpoint into your metamask and then use the actual official optimism link, which you probably did, it's in there by default, you're using the optimism supported RPC endpoint.
00:19:58.134 - 00:20:26.142, Speaker B: And that just means a whole bunch of servers out there, whether it's hosted by Infuria Infrastructure provided or hosted by alchemy, these are servers that are for reading kind of the archival data, the history of optimism. So that's what powers all of the user interfaces. Right. And so you could set that up in metamask, and you're saying the default, the optimism default, RPC endpoint, the one that they sponsor, was having some trouble keeping up. Right, right, exactly.
00:20:26.216 - 00:21:06.978, Speaker A: And so they run their own server or endpoint to alchemy, and people were trying to. So whenever you load up your metamask into a website that is connected to the optimism data and it needs to collect optimism data to feed you, some of that data would be like, do you have an airdrop to claim is like some of the data that is relevant here, or just like pinging uniswap on optimism for what is the price of something like all these things? Read the optimism chain. That's what got clogged. And that is web two, Ryan, which is crazy. And so all the dgens who wanted to claim their optimism tokens broke web two. And so you're talking to Jing about the details on this. So we could get this right for the roll up.
00:21:06.978 - 00:21:47.498, Speaker A: And Jing gives us this funny story where she was working at the time, where the optimism team was working happens to be in the same building as alchemy. And so she ran downstairs to the alchemy offices and knocked, hammered on the door. And it's like, hi, I'm from optimism. We're releasing a token today, and we need 10,000 f cups. And then apparently, the alchemy team was like, f cups? What the hell are f cups? And then she was saying was actually FCPUs CPus. Yeah, but Carl Flores is apparently dyslexic, and so he told Jing, we need 10,000 f cups. So Jing goes running to the alchemy office and knocks on the door.
00:21:47.498 - 00:22:09.842, Speaker A: He's like, we need 100,000 f cups. We need 100,000 f cups. And alchemy is like, what the hell is going on? Anyways, as soon as alchemy figured it out, they spun up the nodes, and that was all fixed. And so people caused a bunch of drama. Be like, oh, I can't get my tokens. All the token claimers were clamoring as they do. But once the extra servers from alchemy were spun up, everything was fine, and everyone could claim their tokens.
00:22:09.906 - 00:22:36.240, Speaker B: Yeah. It's important to note, obviously, optimism did not go down. None of the smart contracts actually went down. There was the ability to claim tokens if you knew how to do it outside of the user interfaces. It was just kind of the web two infrastructure dependency of serving the data up, the archival historical data up. That's the piece that needed some additional juice and some additional servers. And if you knew a different RPC endpoint, you could still claim as well.
00:22:36.240 - 00:22:44.858, Speaker B: It sounds like. Well, that's got, as I said, a few of these, but I'm still on the hunt for more. Did you do your claiming yet, David?
00:22:44.954 - 00:22:46.706, Speaker A: I did my claiming, yes, I did.
00:22:46.808 - 00:22:47.218, Speaker B: Nice.
00:22:47.304 - 00:23:03.702, Speaker A: And also my delegating. I delegated one. I have two addresses. I claimed optimism. One I delegated to David Mihal. The other one I delegated to polynaya. Here's an anthony Cesano tweet saying, pretty cool to see optimism coming in fifth place for the amount of ETH burned on layer one today.
00:23:03.702 - 00:23:22.902, Speaker A: So this is what happens when you get a token. All of a sudden, you just get a bunch of economic activity. Optimism yesterday burned 102 ether, and so putting it ahead of USDC and uniswap v. Two. Not ahead of uniswap v. Three. So it goes openc, basic eth, transfers, uniswap v three, tether and then optimism.
00:23:22.902 - 00:23:27.290, Speaker A: The optimism layer two, burning the fifth place for the amount of eth burned.
00:23:27.370 - 00:23:29.760, Speaker B: And then in 7th place is thick friends.
00:23:31.730 - 00:23:49.846, Speaker A: My favorite NFT. I went to some dune analytics dashboards just to see some of the activity that was going on on optimism, and so I put that into a tweet. When you pull this up, Ryan, find the airdrop point on the screen where you think the airdrop happened.
00:23:49.948 - 00:23:57.238, Speaker B: Oh, my God. This is transactions per day for people on the podcast. Absolutely spiking on May 31.
00:23:57.324 - 00:23:58.446, Speaker A: All time highs.
00:23:58.578 - 00:24:16.462, Speaker B: Yeah, like tripling, quadrupling, something like this from normal and definitely all time highs. And addresses per day. Look at that rocket up. All the way up. This is transacting addresses per day or active addresses per day. That is the token effect on layer two. Yeah.
00:24:16.596 - 00:24:58.022, Speaker A: And the number of first, I think if you scroll down, I put some numbers on the first time addresses that we're transacting. Yeah. 45,001st time optimism users yesterday. And this graph is really cool. Where the black line is the orders of magnitude times cheaper optimism is, and then the transactions is the number of transactions there are. So you did see a little bit of congestion in optimism, but not to like, it didn't actually saturate the whole entire blockchain. What happens is just like, as it gets heavily, heavily used, it becomes lesser orders of magnitude more scaled than ethereum.
00:24:58.022 - 00:25:06.190, Speaker A: But again, that is before EIP 4844, that is before more optimizations come to optimism. But pretty cool.
00:25:06.260 - 00:25:17.266, Speaker B: People don't know. They still have the throttle on, basically. They still have the governors. So it's not going as fast as it will be going and as efficiently as it will be going. This is a tweet from Sassel, too. What's he saying here?
00:25:17.368 - 00:25:47.418, Speaker A: Yeah, he goes, friendly reminder. The op airdrop is going to generate a lot of fee revenue on the optimism network, with the proceeds from this fee revenue later being donated to retroactive public goods funding, turning degens into regens. This is a crypto economic future that we're all here, where we take our externalities and we funnel them into public goods. And so this is optimism, retroactive public goods funding innovation. We did a show on this called the trillion dollar layer two opportunity, part two, although part one is definitely worth listening to.
00:25:47.504 - 00:26:25.126, Speaker B: Something else people always talk about with layer twos, is this thought of it being parasitic to layer ones? So will all of the transaction fees kind of evaporate from layer ones? Will that migrate to layer twos and layer twos essentially steal the economic activity and the chain revenue for layer one. This is David Mihal kind of responding to that criticism. Optimism was responsible for 1.6% of all fee revenue paid on Ethereum yesterday. That's hundreds of thousands of dollars of eth burned in just a couple of hours. Airdrop didn't start until late in the day. Who says layer twos are parasitic to layer ones?
00:26:25.228 - 00:26:25.926, Speaker A: Who says that?
00:26:25.948 - 00:26:46.282, Speaker B: Indeed? I've never understood that argument. It's like saying the state of Texas or the state of California is parasitic to the United States. Of course it's not. These are tax paying states. They're contributing to the GDP of the ethereum economy. That's what a layer two essentially is. It's part of the United Rollups of Ethereum.
00:26:46.282 - 00:26:58.562, Speaker B: So it's definitely not parasitic. We're starting to see that reflected with optimism, as you said, being number five on the burn leaderboard, the taxpayer leaderboard, if you will, happening just this week.
00:26:58.696 - 00:27:37.354, Speaker A: And speaking of network effects, or token effects. Excuse me. This is Coinbase announcing that Coinbase will add support for optimism on the optimism network only. And so op is trading on Coinbase, but in order to, if you want to trade your op on Coinbase, you have to send your optimism tokens on the optimism network to Coinbase, meaning Coinbase now supports the optimism network. So I think we can see further integrations with optimism over time, especially now that the tokens there and all the economic activity there, I expect USDC DAi other asset deposits straight onto the optimism network. So we've been clamoring that for that for a while. Coinbase finally delivered.
00:27:37.354 - 00:28:15.014, Speaker A: And a part of this whole saga, part of this whole story comes with this very controversial governance post that's titled the Optimism Governance post, titled users who sold the initial Ob airdrop should become ineligible for all future airdrops. And so the zero john on the optimism forum post saying, I've seen a lot of wallets claim the OP airdrop and then swap it straight to uniswap. These accounts are not playing a constructive role in optimism governance. And so he makes a claim that people that just claimed and then dumped their op tokens should be ineligible for future op tokens. Controversial posts. There was a bunch of replies.
00:28:15.062 - 00:28:19.126, Speaker B: He actually named some addresses here. None of these are your addresses, are they, David?
00:28:19.238 - 00:28:24.154, Speaker A: No, I did not claim 32,000 op airdrop tokens.
00:28:24.202 - 00:28:37.650, Speaker B: I also did not sell. I mean, there's some airdrops that I sell automatically. This, to me, is definitely a keeper. I mean, optimism has a bright future ahead of itself, but why was this so controversial? So what was the back and forth?
00:28:38.870 - 00:28:59.830, Speaker A: It's a conversation about how do people get rewarded? Because we're rewarding people for their behavior and their activity and their engagement on the optimism layer, too. And so if you reward people, but you also restrict them from selling, are you really rewarding them? Because if you reward people, they need to put food on the table at some point, right? They got to pay rent.
00:28:59.990 - 00:29:07.146, Speaker B: They're not restricting from selling. They're just saying, next time around you could sell, but next time around you.
00:29:07.168 - 00:29:11.820, Speaker A: Won'T get the statement that says you can't sell because then we won't reward you in the future.
00:29:12.910 - 00:29:31.522, Speaker B: I don't hate it, honestly. It's like, what are you trying to incent towards? You're trying to incent towards the settlers of the community, those that will stick around and actually govern and actually contribute. You're not trying to incent to the people who are, like, just dumping. And so I don't know. I definitely see the argument for this as well.
00:29:31.576 - 00:29:42.034, Speaker A: But what if they are taking the optimism token, selling it for USDC, and then they keep the USDC on? Like, then we're still having USDC liquidity on optimism. So that's still useful.
00:29:42.162 - 00:30:34.790, Speaker B: I think that's something, but it's less useful than holding the op token, actually contributing towards governance. And so there are degrees of utility to the network and what you want to reward. And I'm not saying maybe this is advocating a complete blacklisting of these accounts or something like that. I don't know that I'd go that far. But it is an interesting thought process to say, hey, if you did sell versus if you kept the people who kept the people who are actually settling in, this land should be rewarded more next time, and there should be some disincentive towards just trying to flip your tokens on day one. I understand both sides of the argument, I guess, but I'm probably more in favor of, like, let's try to incent the network towards governors and towards settlers and away from the traders and liquidity locusts and that sort of thing. So I can definitely understand this governance post.
00:30:34.790 - 00:30:44.614, Speaker B: Our friend Kobe did not, or at least I don't think he did. He responded with a governance post of his own. I think this is like a satire, maybe some tongue cheek.
00:30:44.662 - 00:30:45.942, Speaker A: This is definitely satire.
00:30:46.006 - 00:30:47.580, Speaker B: Okay, what was he saying here?
00:30:48.110 - 00:31:22.520, Speaker A: Kobe goes, I recently saw this proposal on the optimism forum that we should be restricting airdrops to people that sell. And so he goes and takes it even further, right? He goes, however, I'm unable to support this proposal in its current form. My lack of support for this proposal is not because I disagree with it, with the sentiment. On the contrary, it's because this proposal does not go too far enough. So he has created some extensions to the proposal. He goes, in addition to canceling the airdrops of op sellers, we should also consider a wider net of eligibility for airdrop slashing. And so he talks about the ways to do that.
00:31:22.520 - 00:32:04.462, Speaker A: I propose that we, the optimism collective, cancel the future airdrops for anyone that has sold any token in the last six months. These people have a pattern of undesirable behavior, and we can consider them potential future sellers. I think I speak for everyone when I say, do we really want people that might one day sell in the governance group? No, we don't. So he says, increase the severity of the punishment. Is canceling a future airdrop good enough? I propose that the punishment for disrespecting optimism's governance price should be significantly harsher in order to dissuade future bad actors. Two ideas we have is we issue a debt token to the sellers and instruct local debt collecting agencies to collect the debt from these people. Bonus is added revenue to optimism.
00:32:04.462 - 00:32:28.278, Speaker A: And part b, we consider physical violence against the sellers. Nobody will take us seriously unless we are willing to fight for what we believe in. There's precedent here. Most governance groups have an active army, for example, the US government. I think this is a good area to get creative. So I request my fellow optimism collective governance groups colleagues to also suggest preferred punishment ideas. Also, cancel the airdrops of everyone that bought op since the airdrop.
00:32:28.278 - 00:32:46.130, Speaker A: Everyone that has bought the airdrop has also sinned because they have interacted with the sellers. This is bad enough. The op tokens they hold are tainted sold tokens. Basically, Kobe is just making a farce out of the governance post saying people are allowed to sell their tokens and not get punished for selling.
00:32:46.550 - 00:33:16.326, Speaker B: Yeah, and then I also think the governance community is allowed to respond to that and be like, but we want to incent holders and settlers. And so I kind of see both sides of it. I do think Kobe's point is taken though, right? Like, there's obviously a way to take this way too far and be super punitive on people who are just like, I mean, it's worth $6.8 billion, guys. That's a lot of money. And maybe you want to cash out some amount of that. I see both sides.
00:33:16.326 - 00:33:37.042, Speaker B: I don't know how this has progressed in the community. But it's definitely turned up some interesting debate back and forth on all of the future airdrops, because that's really what governance is determining now. The existing token holders get to figure out what criteria future airdrops should be, how they should be awarded, and who should get them.
00:33:37.176 - 00:33:48.258, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the interesting thing here, this is how Kobe actually engages in governance. I know it's satire, but this is a legitimate governance post that Kobe is making a very legitimate point on.
00:33:48.344 - 00:33:48.798, Speaker B: Right.
00:33:48.904 - 00:33:55.078, Speaker A: And it's creating a lot of discussion. So the way that Kobe chooses to engage in governance is pretty interesting.
00:33:55.164 - 00:34:13.606, Speaker B: It's pretty clever. It's pretty cool. Well, I mean, what's exciting about this, though, David, is this is the kickoff to maybe airdrop Summer. Layer two summer. Right. It's like, I think there's going to be a ton of these sorts of airdrops in the future, and it's not just layer twos. It's also applications on top of the layer twos.
00:34:13.798 - 00:34:15.194, Speaker A: Is that where we're going next, Ryan?
00:34:15.242 - 00:34:32.754, Speaker B: I think that's where we're going next. I want you to actually tell me about this, David, because you put it in our agenda to discuss velodrome finance. Velo. Airdrop is live. What is Velodrome finance? What is that airdrop? Should I actually claim it? And where can I do that, sir? Yeah.
00:34:32.792 - 00:35:07.098, Speaker A: So, Velodrome is a liquidity protocol native to optimism that airdropped their token in following of the optimism token. And so they literally start their post saying it's optimism. Airdrop season, baby. This time, Velodrome Finance, an AMm inspired by solidly finance, is launching its protocol with an airdrop of Velo tokens. So what is Velodrome finance? It is actually a project that got spawned on Phantom. This is an old Andre inspired project. It had, like, a bad start on Phantom, but the team has fixed their problems and then taken the project to optimism.
00:35:07.098 - 00:36:04.190, Speaker A: It's basically like a curve, except it's not fixed to, like, for, like, assets, and so it's more like uniswap, where you can trade ether for USDC or volatile pairs. Curve is also working on this, I think, in Curve V three. And so it's like curve in the sense that it has that custom curve, amm curve, but it also has, like, ve tokens. So there is ve velo. And so they gave out their velo tokens to a bunch of people that did various different things, one of them being people that are, repeat, optimism users, people that have curve wallets that have staked curve for the maximum amount of time, 1450 days, convex protocol lockers, VLCVX, treasured Dow, Genesis mind magic stakers, Platypus protocol stakers, redacted cartel participants, and eminence finance wallets. And who got affected with EmN. There's a backstory there.
00:36:04.190 - 00:36:35.990, Speaker A: Anyways, the whole point is that right on the hot of the heels of the optimism, Airdrop is the velo airdrop for this application. Brand new application coming to optimism. And so the takeaway is that it's Airdrop season. So stop being depressed about the market, pick your head up and go start exploring. Because there's so many airdrops left. Not only optimism airdrop number two, number three, number n, but there's also the application tokens. And so if you want some of these airdrops, you got to go be on the optimism land because that's where the surface area is for all the airdrops.
00:36:36.070 - 00:36:58.930, Speaker B: Guys, crypto pays you to learn about crypto. Crypto is literally paying you to go bankless. All right, that's what's happening. That first criteria for the Velo airdrop you listed addresses qualified as repeat optimism users. Are you a repeat optimism user? That has some criteria. That's how you qualify for these airdrops. Really cool to see.
00:36:58.930 - 00:37:20.970, Speaker B: And I think this is a great way to kick off. June, David, is to have this airdrop happening. David Mihal also rolled out a really interesting site where we can start to see all of the taxes paid by the layer two community. This is layer two fees, info. And the question, not IRS taxes. Exactly.
00:37:21.040 - 00:37:22.250, Speaker A: L one security payment.
00:37:22.320 - 00:37:46.130, Speaker B: L one security taxes. I should clarify. I'm talking bankless speak here. How much are roll ups paying for Ethereum security? And this goes through the one day security costs in one day. So I guess that would be the last 24 hours time period. At the time of recording, optimism paid almost $200,000 for Ethereum security cost. Arbitrum paid 80,000.
00:37:46.130 - 00:38:11.666, Speaker B: Zksync 11,000. A total of 313,000 was paid for Ethereum security. Again, what do blockchains like Ethereum sell? They sell blockspace. The new purchasers of blockspace are not actually going to be users on the Ethereum main chain. They're going to be layer twos. Here they are ramping up their block space purchasing. And that is how we are scaling the Ethereum economy.
00:38:11.666 - 00:38:14.138, Speaker B: It's really exciting to see all this come together.
00:38:14.304 - 00:38:26.042, Speaker A: Yeah. And if you scroll down, Ryan, you can see the chart. And if you go to percent of total l one fees you can see we just recently hit an all time high. That's l two percentage percent of total l one fees. Bam.
00:38:26.106 - 00:38:27.118, Speaker B: Right at the very end.
00:38:27.204 - 00:38:45.650, Speaker A: 3.2%, 3.1% at the peak. That is an all time high for Layer twos consuming layer one block space. And that number is up only, just like layer one. Gas is up only because you're going to be competing. If you're still on layer one, you're competing with layer twos for block space and you're going to lose that fight.
00:38:45.650 - 00:38:48.818, Speaker A: So you might as well just capitulate and migrate to a layer two.
00:38:48.904 - 00:39:24.954, Speaker B: The other thing is the alternative layer ones are actually competing against these layer twos as well. And the killer advantage that layer twos have in addition to security is they don't actually have to mint their token to pay these fees. They essentially get Ethereum's defense budget for free as part of it. And so if you want to go dip into the economic case for layer twos and the significance, the impact that has on ether and the ethereum economy, go listen to that episode David referenced earlier. That's the trillion dollar case for layer twos. Is that what it's called, David?
00:39:25.002 - 00:39:28.846, Speaker A: Something close to that trillion dollar opportunity on layer twos.
00:39:28.878 - 00:39:29.186, Speaker B: There you go.
00:39:29.208 - 00:39:30.100, Speaker A: Something like that.
00:39:30.710 - 00:39:55.642, Speaker B: It's got trillion in the name. David, let's talk about this next thing. What is going on with this former Opensea employee? I know we mentioned it in a roll up, this was months ago and the employee at the time got fired. Opensea put out a statement. It was some sort of an employee by the name of Nate Chastain, who I believe was a senior product manager at OpenSea. He was caught front running. He was caught front running.
00:39:55.642 - 00:40:19.614, Speaker B: And this was a twitter post. And now this has made all of its way to the US attorney's office in the southern district of New York. And they've put out, I guess you call this a press release. It's labeled under press releases, but it's an indictment announcement that this Nate Chastain has been indicted and he is facing charges. What do you make of this, David?
00:40:19.742 - 00:40:51.110, Speaker A: Yeah, so just to recap the story, Nate Chastain, he had information about which nfts were about to be featured on the front page of OpenSea. And so he would go buy these nfts before they were featured on the front page of OpeNC. And then the price would like jump two x, four x, five x, and then he would sell them. So he used that insider information to know which nfts are about to be displayed on the front page, and then he would front run retail. That would just buy the shiny thing on the front page. He collected $67,000 for this activity.
00:40:51.190 - 00:40:51.722, Speaker B: Wow.
00:40:51.856 - 00:40:55.630, Speaker A: And people found out because they just saw him.
00:40:55.700 - 00:40:57.134, Speaker B: The ledger is transparent, guys.
00:40:57.252 - 00:41:31.366, Speaker A: Well, and he was kind of dumb about it and sent it to a wallet that owned his own crypto punk. It might as well be called, like, natechastain eth. And so people found out just by watching the blockchain. So kind of a dumb move. But also, what he is being charged with is, I would call egregious, in relation to $67,000 of insider trading. And so he hasn't been charged with this. He hasn't been sentenced to this, but one count of wire fraud and one count of money laundering, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.
00:41:31.366 - 00:41:52.730, Speaker A: So if he gets the worst of it, it's like 40 years in prison. The worst possible. I can't imagine that he would get the worst of it. But this is what crypto, Twitter, and just everyone has really been alarmed about. Serious. That it's a super serious. Like, the guy has to actually hire a lawyer to not go to jail for $67,000 of front running retail.
00:41:52.730 - 00:42:00.222, Speaker A: And again, he shouldn't have done that. That was a stupid thing to do. Also dishonorable and super guilty.
00:42:00.286 - 00:42:01.250, Speaker B: Unethical.
00:42:01.590 - 00:42:05.202, Speaker A: 40 years of jail time, though, it seems like.
00:42:05.336 - 00:42:33.002, Speaker B: I don't know. I mean, definitely a crime. But now you have to ask yourself, does the crime fit the punishment? Of course, we don't know what the final punishment will be, but just the fact that the maximum sentence is 40 years, potentially in prison for doing this. All sorts of people in crypto front run other people all of the time based on insider information. It just happened that Nate was actually caught doing it from a Twitter thread. That's how bizarre this is.
00:42:33.056 - 00:42:46.946, Speaker A: This just feels like he's getting Ross Ulbricht again. He hasn't been charged, and so he might just, like, not. This might actually turn into a nothing burger. But everyone's being very alarmist as to what this could turn into, where they could make an example out of Nate Chastain and say, that's what they're trying to do.
00:42:46.968 - 00:42:54.014, Speaker B: Right? Make an example. Perhaps what they're trying to say is, hopefully, which is good, which is insider trading is not okay in crypto.
00:42:54.062 - 00:43:22.986, Speaker A: Right. The fact that he was put into handcuffs and arrested for $60,000 of front running is a little egregious. There's way better ways to solve this. Grievance. And so what I'm worried about is that he actually does go to jail for a really long time, kind of like how Charlie Trem did. Charlie Trem, he was faced with a lifetime in prison, so he took a plea deal and spent like three years in jail or something. Ross Ulbricht was not able to get out of like a double life sentence.
00:43:22.986 - 00:43:36.082, Speaker A: So he is still in jail. And so this is like the red flag that people are worried about is like, do they just make a case out of this individual as a warning shot to the rest of the crypto industry? Tough, like, get your shit in order.
00:43:36.136 - 00:43:39.870, Speaker B: Excuse me. Do you think everyone at centralized exchanges right now is just like sweating bullets?
00:43:39.950 - 00:43:40.580, Speaker A: Probably.
00:43:41.990 - 00:44:26.430, Speaker B: They're going to have to button things up for sure, and compliance is going to be a big issue. The thing I love about Defi, at least when you get into kind of the permissionless levers of defi, is because no one decides, no one is a gatekeeper on what asset gets listed on something like uniswap. Anyone can list an asset at any time. There is actually no such thing as front run information about which asset is going to be listed because anyone at any time has the ability to spin up an asset. That to me, is the world that we are trying to get to. A completely permissionless world where there is no insider information. Everyone knows at the exact same time, because there are no gatekeepers.
00:44:26.430 - 00:44:34.302, Speaker B: Openc is not that, of course, because they're kind of a, call them a web two five type of company, centralized.
00:44:34.366 - 00:44:36.402, Speaker A: Front end with a decentralized back end.
00:44:36.536 - 00:45:11.246, Speaker B: Exactly. And so there is actually insider information as far as what NFTs might hit the front page with, a coinbase or an FTX. It's also which assets are we going to list? That's information that can be traded on. And in those cases, David, it does make sense to have regulators take a peek and enforce this sort of thing. Now, again here, 40 years is absolutely crazy for this kind of event, but we'll have to see. And we'll be following the case on bankless. Here's a hilarious meme, though, that I think sums things up.
00:45:11.246 - 00:45:12.382, Speaker B: What is this? David? Yeah.
00:45:12.436 - 00:45:36.822, Speaker A: Doge Toshi tweets out crypto, Twitter vcs right now. Excuse me, crypto vcs right now. And this is a scene from Kevin from the office. I actually don't remember the scene, but Kevin is saying, I had Nate explain to me three times what he got arrested for, because it sounds an awful lot like what I do here every day. So pretty big knock on vcs in crypto. And of course not all vcs are bad. Some vcs are very bad.
00:45:36.822 - 00:45:45.434, Speaker A: But yeah, using privileged information that the rest of the market doesn't have to front run opportunity, isn't that the line?
00:45:45.472 - 00:45:46.826, Speaker B: We say we use the word front.
00:45:46.848 - 00:45:53.920, Speaker A: Run opportunity, but we're talking about buying ether before the tradfi does. So that's not insider information.
00:45:55.410 - 00:46:43.422, Speaker B: I think this meme though does sum up what is actual front running? What is actual insider training, what does that actually mean in crypto? And I think a lot of that has to be defined. But certainly where there are centralized vectors, where there are permissioned gatekeeping, that sort of thing has the potential to expose front running as we've seen in kind of equities market. But the more diffuse we can make this information, the more transparent, the more on chain, the less ability anyone has to kind of front run or do insider trading because we can all be there. No one has informational advantage. There's no informational arbitrage. Everyone gets access to it at the same time if you are watching the chain. So that is the world we are looking to get to.
00:46:43.422 - 00:46:48.238, Speaker B: But it does call into question what front running actually is and what Insider trading actually.
00:46:48.404 - 00:47:09.746, Speaker A: Yeah, that's right. Wish the best for Nate Chastain. Even though he did commit a crime. I hope he doesn't go to jail. I hope he just has to pay a fine. The thing is, on the blockchain, he could literally just pay the people back. There is verifiable people as who he sold those nfts to at the marked up price and he can just pay them money.
00:47:09.746 - 00:47:37.518, Speaker A: That makes much more sense than going to jail. Anyways, that wraps up that, guys, we got so much more left to talk about. We've already gone on for so long. Coming up next in the second half of the show, Nate, Kanye west enters the chat. So we'll talk about what Kanye west is doing with Yeezus eth and also the fight over the apes. Ethereum layer twos going head to head with alternative layer ones as to where the apes need to migrate to because they've determined that they need to migrate off of the ethereum layer one. As we've said, migrate off of the Ethereum layer one.
00:47:37.518 - 00:48:14.934, Speaker A: All of that stuff and more coming up right after we get to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible. Arbitrum is an ethereum layer two scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use DFI and NFTs. Over 300 projects have already deployed to arbitrum and the DFI and NFT ecosystems are growing rapidly. Some of the coolest and newest NFT collections have chosen arbitrum as their home. All the while, DFI protocols continue to see increased usage and liquidity. Using arbitram has never been easier, especially with the ability to deposit directly into arbitram through all the exchanges, including Binance, FTX, Huobi, and crypto.com. Once inside, you'll notice arbitram increases ethereum speed by orders of magnitude for a fraction of the cost of the average gas fee.
00:48:14.934 - 00:49:20.958, Speaker A: If you're a developer who wants low gas fees and instant transactions for your users, visit Arbitrum IO slash developer to start building your DaP on Arbitrum if you're a dgen, many of your favorite dapps on Ethereum are already on Arbitrum, with many moving over every day. Go to bridge arbitrum IO now to start bridging over your eth and other tokens in order to experience DFI nfts in the way it was always meant to be. Fast, cheap, secure, and friction free. Ave is the leading decentralized liquidity protocol, and now Ave V three is here. Ave V three has powerful new features to enable you to get the most out of DFI, including isolation mode, which allows for many more markets to be launched with more exotic collateral types, and also efficiency mode, which allows for higher loan to value ratios and of course, portals, allowing users to port their Ave position across all of the networks that Ave operates on like Polygon, Phantom, avalanche, arbitrum optimism and harmony the beautiful thing about AAve is that it's completely open source, decentralized, and governed by its community, enabling a truly bankless future for us all. To get your first cryptocuralized loan, get started@ave.com. That's aave.com.
00:49:20.958 - 00:49:30.962, Speaker A: And also check out the Ave protocol governance forums to see what more than 100,000 Dow members are all robbing about at governance ave.com all right, guys, we're back.
00:49:31.016 - 00:49:49.142, Speaker B: Want to start with some merge updates? This, of course, is the Ethereum merge, the biggest event we expect of this year. Robston was just announced. David, what are we looking at here? What is the announcement? This is an Ethereum merge testnet, and it looks like that is moving along. What was the milestone that was hit this week?
00:49:49.196 - 00:50:32.018, Speaker A: Yeah, so we have a bunch of testnets around the Ethereum ecosystem. There's Robson, there's gorely, there's a few others whose name escaped me at the moment, and each one of those is going to go from proof of work to proof of stake as Ethereum in the future will. And each one of those is going to have its own merge, its own practice merge. So Robson is getting merged the eigth of June. Then there's going to be like, if everything goes well, two to three weeks for the next one, which is going to be Gorley I believe, and then two to three, maybe more weeks for the next one which is Seplo. Yeah, I didn't even know that that was a testnet. Covid is also coming up June eigth, the first major Ethereum testnet merges and then we have a few more testnets after that and then we actually merge.
00:50:32.018 - 00:50:53.600, Speaker A: It's in a race right now to beat out the ice age coming in late August. And so there is conversation about how if we do get to late August, we are going to have to hard fork without the merge to cover to get the transaction fees from the ice age back down to 12 seconds because 20 seconds might become untenable. It's actually like almost having the total block space supply of Ethereum at that point.
00:50:57.170 - 00:51:38.822, Speaker B: I think the big question is are we still going to do August? Is that still in the cards? And I'm going to say from last week to this week, I think the probability of hitting August has decreased, at least in my mind. Maybe like last week I was thinking, okay, 80% ish. Now it's probably down to like 50%. And I'm thinking more of a September, October, November kind of time horizon because they're still having some issues with shadow forks. We'd hope that that would be done right by now. But there's still some additional testing that needs to be done. So I wouldn't be surprised if it slipped into September, October, maybe November.
00:51:38.822 - 00:51:40.146, Speaker B: What's your take here, David?
00:51:40.198 - 00:51:56.062, Speaker A: Yeah, that sounds about right. Each merge represents a variable and so variables stacked on variables. Still feeling good about September at least, but we keep on kicking it out now, don't we?
00:51:56.116 - 00:51:57.326, Speaker B: Are we there yet? Are we there yet?
00:51:57.348 - 00:52:11.838, Speaker A: Vitalik, are we there yet? Vitalik, please. Anyways, that's that, not too much. More details on that as each test night gets merged. We'll have more and more details as things go along. All right, Pooley, update. Pooley. Yeah, this is the latent.
00:52:11.838 - 00:52:38.846, Speaker A: Qsack is getting sued because of the whole like $5 into pool together turning into a quarter billion dollar lawsuit. Chris Dixon from a 16 C goes, we just bought a 75 eTh. Pooley judge to support Layton Cusack and Pool together again. This is an attack on pool together. But it's actually an attack on DFI, which means that it's an attack on you personally if you have not minted a pool together. Pooley, to help support pool together against their egregious, frivolous lawsuit. Please do that.
00:52:38.846 - 00:52:44.234, Speaker A: There's a link in the show notes. A 16 Z is the only crypto vc to have minted a pooley.
00:52:44.282 - 00:52:46.834, Speaker B: Look, man, I think they deserve a hand clap for that.
00:52:46.872 - 00:52:50.754, Speaker A: And they do. I'm so sorry, Chris. I don't have my soundboard. I trigger the applause button.
00:52:50.792 - 00:53:05.458, Speaker B: But good job. A 16 Z. I hope some other vcs step up and do this. This is definitely how we support this industry and support DFI. And so far, David, looks like they've pulled together. NFTs have raised close to 500 eth.
00:53:05.554 - 00:53:10.058, Speaker A: Yes. That number is actually old. They've raised like 580 ETH, I believe.
00:53:10.224 - 00:53:17.980, Speaker B: Fantastic. Yeah. So they said the goal is to raise about $1.5 million of ETH. And it looks like they're doing that.
00:53:19.310 - 00:53:33.934, Speaker A: They still got a lot, a lot more to go. They have raised 515 ETH at $937, $37,000. They're looking for $140,000. So they have like almost $500,000 left to go. So we still need help. Still need to help.
00:53:34.132 - 00:53:39.490, Speaker B: You're thinking that ETH is still going to be below 2000. So I'm calculating that ETH is going to be 3000.
00:53:39.560 - 00:53:40.386, Speaker A: I'm not.
00:53:40.568 - 00:54:08.134, Speaker B: You just make the difference. That's all we have to do. We've already raced it, guys. All right. Kanye west getting into nfTs, at least he's filing trademarks for nfts. And I think this is kind of interesting because the last I heard from Kanye west and nfTs, he was actually pretty cold on it. I think he put out a Instagram message, just like a handwritten message saying something, knocking nfts.
00:54:08.134 - 00:54:21.070, Speaker B: My focus is on building real world products in the real world. And about nfts, he said, ask me later. So he's previously been pretty cold on nfts, although he deleted this Instagram post.
00:54:21.220 - 00:54:23.950, Speaker A: And now it looks like earlier this morning. Click on that link.
00:54:24.100 - 00:54:27.474, Speaker B: Yeah, it's deleted. Oh, yeah, he did delete that.
00:54:27.512 - 00:54:27.982, Speaker A: That's weird.
00:54:28.046 - 00:54:35.958, Speaker B: Yeah, he deleted it. So a little cold on nfts saying, hey, no, I'm going to focus Yeezy stuff on the real world. But now filing a whole bunch of.
00:54:36.044 - 00:54:43.000, Speaker A: Trademarks, it looks like not only that, but he also bought yeezus eth. Ryan, he bought yeezys eth for four.
00:54:44.810 - 00:54:46.070, Speaker B: Eth, that's it.
00:54:46.220 - 00:54:49.046, Speaker A: Yeah, right. Well, four eth, that's a lot of.
00:54:49.228 - 00:54:54.714, Speaker B: I mean, but it's yeezys eth. I mean, what's it worth to kanye? It's got to be worth more than four eth to this guy.
00:54:54.752 - 00:55:10.560, Speaker A: Well, yeah, but the guy who, oh, excuse me, five eth, I mean, the seller probably didn't know he was selling it to Kanye west. Actually undetermined as to whether this is Kanye west. Oh, yeah. Okay. We actually don't know that. So yeezus eth got purchased for five.
00:55:11.730 - 00:55:15.650, Speaker B: Don't know. We don't know whether Kanye west has it or not. Maybe he doesn't.
00:55:15.990 - 00:55:21.890, Speaker A: When Zachary Dash makes a funny tweet retweeting this news, he goes, web3sis.
00:55:23.110 - 00:55:52.506, Speaker B: Look, man, I think nfts are just prime for somebody like Kanye west. It's very much all about kind of the brand. And so I fully expect Kanye to enter the metaverse as with all of the other luxury brands out there. So only a matter of time. So, David, update me on this. There's a lot of talk these days about liquid staking derivatives, lsd, I guess. And this is coming from some concern, some fear that Lido actually has a large distribution of all of eth stake.
00:55:52.506 - 00:56:09.140, Speaker B: It's over 30%, I believe, at this point in time. And so this is Danny Ryan writing an entire post on why liquid staking derivatives cannot safely exceed consensus thresholds. What is the discussion going on in the Ethereum sphere about this?
00:56:09.590 - 00:56:52.858, Speaker A: Basically, if a staking derivative token, which we assume all future staked eths will likely be a part of a stake to eth derivative token, that's Lido's staked eth, that's locket pools, are eths and all the future ones that are coming. If there is just too much centralization inside of one single token. And the way that that can emerge is like, instead of you, maybe you have dollars, but you want to have upside to staked EtH. Instead of buying those dollars to buy eth to go stake that eth, you can just go to uniswap and buy our eth on uniswap or staked eth on uniswap. And you're probably going to buy the most liquid one because that's what you want, the one with the most integrations in Aave. You want to have financialization around your staked eats, and so you just buy the most liquid one. And that has like, positive feedback.
00:56:52.858 - 00:57:48.130, Speaker A: Yeah, positive feedback loops. If the more and more stake you have, the more and more mev you can get, and so the yields will be higher on the one with a monopoly. And so Danny Ryan writes this post, risks of LSD liquid staking derivatives, and he just makes a claim that if a liquid staking derivative protocol exceeds critical consensus thresholds, which are at one third, one half and two thirds, crossing each threshold enables powers to that organization, be it lido or rocket pool, or whichever organization gets too successful, it kind of gives them control over Ethereum. And so he makes a post illustrating all the risks here. And basically we cannot allow any liquid staking derivative token to get larger than one third. And Lido right now is at like 32%. I did an episode with Superfiz from the rocket pool Eth finance community that's coming out on Tuesday if you want to hear more about this.
00:57:48.130 - 00:58:22.910, Speaker A: I'm not necessarily worried in the long term. There's yet to be a problem that the Ethereum community hasn't solved, although it does need direct attention. So I wrote a tweet right before we did this. Lots of clamoring about lido staked EtH dominance lately. Staking as a service apps are there's a few staking as a service apps that are yet to come to market. Swell network Obel alluvial, which got announced at permissionless plus rocket pool, I think is about to see a lot of inbound eth still very early in the competition landscape for staking derivatives. However, we do need to ensure that a monopoly of staked ETh derivative tokens does not emerge.
00:58:23.330 - 00:59:20.110, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree with that. I think there's a lot of more competitors that are about to enter the game for also, like once withdrawals happen that'll totally describe as shake up the snow globe and things will settle down after that. I do think the answer to Lido having too much stake is actually for competitors to emerge. And also I think there's some interesting answers in the form of things like oval network that allow the sharing of staked private keys and can add some additional resilience and additional decentralization a bit earlier in the stack, more closer to the client level, closer to the protocol level, and that cryptography has not yet emerged. But I think, David, we'll probably be doing some stuff with Obel in the future where we talk about this technology called shared secret validator technology, SSV, which is super important and yet to really emerge. I think it'll help some of this. So it's still very early.
00:59:20.110 - 00:59:39.158, Speaker B: There's lots of clamoring. I am concerned about it, but I'm not at the stage where I think this is a long term existential risk. I do think as a community technologies, the cryptography, that's going to emerge and we'll have to just let these things settle before we hit the panic button too hard on this.
00:59:39.244 - 01:00:17.154, Speaker A: Yeah, I definitely agree. The Ethereum immune system is definitely showing up to tackle this problem head on. SSV also, I think it's been rebranded as DVT distributed validator technology is definitely very promising to help democratize some of the monopoly power that a monopoly staked Ethereum token might have. Anyways, moving on to the fight over the apes. So we have two competing blockchains submitting proposals to the apecoin Dao to have the ape ecosystem be onboarded to a particular blockchain board apes. You're talking board apes. Yeah.
01:00:17.154 - 01:00:41.082, Speaker A: So the other side mint of the virtual land clogged Ethereum, they also had a very unoptimized NFT contract, a bunch of failed transactions. So on the heels of that avalanche comes to the apecoin DaO and submits their proposal for the other side metaverse to become an avalanche subnet. And so they make the proposal, do all their incentives. Here's all the things that we can give you.
01:00:41.216 - 01:00:45.146, Speaker B: An avalanche subnet is kind of like an avalanche side chain, as I understand it.
01:00:45.248 - 01:01:28.338, Speaker A: Yeah, the avalanche ecosystem says these are competitors to layer twos, but that triggers the Ethereum community because they're just fundamentally different constructions with weaker split security. And so where Ethereum layer twos share Ethereum security, avalanche subnets split avalanche security. And for the security maximalists and decentralization maximalists out there, we don't really like that. But avalanche anyways, they come and say, hey, make your ape ecosystem your ape dow an avalanche subnet. And so that's one blockchain competing for the ape ecosystem and the other is immutable. Immutable X has also submitted a proposal to Apecoin's Dow trusted layer two scaling partner. And so we got two blockchains fighting for the apecoin.
01:01:28.338 - 01:02:04.580, Speaker A: And the links in the show notes will be in the forum posts. So if you want to see this firsthand about the reactions to this, you can go into the comments and scroll down. The brief time I scrolled down and read the comments, the immutable proposals were very, very overwhelmingly positive. And then the avalanche were extremely constricted and controversial, kind of what you would expect if you're a decentralization maxi. So I like what I see, because again, immutable is a DK roll up on top of Ethereum doesn't compromise on security. Avalanche kind of compromised on security ecosystem. That's why I kind of resist that.
01:02:05.350 - 01:02:13.794, Speaker B: Ethereum has never done marketing well or like business development very well. It can. It's a protocol, like how does TCPIP do marketing or business development?
01:02:13.842 - 01:02:14.006, Speaker A: Right.
01:02:14.028 - 01:02:51.886, Speaker B: And Ethereum is much more in the vein of TCPIP versus like a company. It's something that alternative layer ones have done very well. They do good outreach, good partnerships, good business development. And so that's why you're seeing avalanche in these governance forms, like fighting for market share. But it's funny because layer twos do not have that restriction. So many of these layer twos are becoming Ethereum's marketing and business development arm and onboarding arm, essentially. So it is back to something we were saying that people didn't believe so much last year, is that many of the alternative layer ones are going to find themselves not competing with Ethereum directly.
01:02:51.886 - 01:03:04.482, Speaker B: They're going to find themselves competing with layer twos. And here's an example of that. Avalanche and immutable competing for the board apes in these governance forum posts.
01:03:04.626 - 01:03:38.946, Speaker A: And you can see in the forum post, like Avalanche has like, hey, we have this $290,000,000 incentive program. Immutable is like, yeah, we raised $200 million. We also have our incentive program. And so this is the Ethereum application layer fighting for the best interest of the Ethereum protocol, which I think is just fantastic. Hal press, he tweets out both Avax and avalanche and immutable have made proposals to move apecoin to their chain. Community response could not have been more different. This is the comments I was talking about strongly against the avalanche and pro the Ethereum layer two.
01:03:38.946 - 01:03:50.310, Speaker A: Interesting that users would rather have assets backed on Ethereum layer two than an Alt EVM chain. Again, if you are curious to see the response for yourself, you can go to the link in the show notes and review the comments.
01:03:51.050 - 01:03:53.526, Speaker B: We got. More, David, what are we looking at here?
01:03:53.548 - 01:04:16.078, Speaker A: More alt layer one things this is the Twitter account Solana status block production on the Solana mainnet beta has halted validator operations should prepare for a restart in mv. Validators on Discord. So Salana down once again. Closed for business hours. Take from frogmonkey goes. Validators check. Discord is the most janky ass web3 shit I've read all day.
01:04:16.078 - 01:04:37.938, Speaker A: What happens when discord goes down too? Law. And so yeah, it's consensus by Discord Channel, not the best version of consensus. And so I tweeted this out. I was like, if people are starting to make memes about Salana being down, it's starting to get pretty bad. And so here's the Solana is down starter pack. Solana main net beta intermittent issues. Validators, please come to the discord.
01:04:37.938 - 01:04:59.194, Speaker A: It was a simple software bug that in no way reflects badly on our design choices. Not down blocks, just delayed indefinitely. Engineers are investigating. Update your nodes now. Nakamoto coefficient. If you're not following the Solana leaders on crypto Twitter, you might not get some of these jokes. But, yeah, memes about Solana being down is not exactly what you want to see.
01:04:59.194 - 01:04:59.594, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:04:59.632 - 01:05:32.418, Speaker B: And look, I think that there's some necessary accountability. I mean, Solana is saying it's a layer one. It's also saying it's in beta. But it's like a many billions of dollar beta, right. With a lot of applications depending on. And the one thing that layer one chains are supposed to do is stay up, maintain censorship resistance, and maintain uptime. And if it's not doing these things, then I do think the crypto community is right to sort of call it out and raise attention, raise awareness.
01:05:32.418 - 01:05:49.226, Speaker B: I mean, a lot of people didn't do that with the terra ecosystem and kind of look what happened, right? Really cost the space over the long run. So we're going to continue to talk about these things because we think they're important. But David, another thing we're going to continue to talk about every single week is a job.
01:05:49.328 - 01:05:49.962, Speaker A: Get a job.
01:05:50.016 - 01:06:04.702, Speaker B: We want you to get a job in crypto. Absolutely. There's companies that are hiring even at a faster clip. There has been no decrease in the amount of jobs on our job boards. I'm going to read a few out to you. A tech lead at Swell network.
01:06:04.766 - 01:06:07.074, Speaker A: David, that's staking as a service company.
01:06:07.192 - 01:06:25.026, Speaker B: That's what I thought. A tech competitor, network solidity. Developer at unlocked. Senior product designer at streams. A business development lead, Goldfinch marketing manager, Wanderverse. So many of these positions were non technical already. David, an associate, business operations chainlink Labs, a developer evangelist at Argent.
01:06:25.026 - 01:06:44.442, Speaker B: There's so many more. Go sign up to receive these jobs in your inbox. Thebankless palette.com slash jobs. Also, if you haven't done this, do this, go submit your resume, make these projects come to you for the talent. We have a talent collective where you can go do that. A lot of energy in the bankless talent community these days.
01:06:44.442 - 01:06:47.646, Speaker B: David, I think there was like a Twitter spaces earlier this week about this. Yeah.
01:06:47.668 - 01:06:59.794, Speaker A: Do you know how many people went to the talent collective team at bankless. Joni and Michael hosted a Twitter space with some other companies in the space. All about just like kind of a job workshop, like how to get a job in web3, how to stand.
01:06:59.832 - 01:07:03.902, Speaker B: These were like employers part of the Twitter spaces.
01:07:03.966 - 01:07:08.326, Speaker A: And so, you know how many people came up to that Twitter space, Ryan? Like, how many people showed up?
01:07:08.428 - 01:07:10.086, Speaker B: How many? Tell me.
01:07:10.108 - 01:07:15.494, Speaker A: 1500 showed up. What Twitter space? I shit you not, dude. Like 1500 people.
01:07:15.532 - 01:07:15.990, Speaker B: So there.
01:07:16.060 - 01:07:20.582, Speaker A: 1500 people who showed up for basically what is like a virtual career day.
01:07:20.636 - 01:07:21.690, Speaker B: A Twitter job fair.
01:07:21.760 - 01:07:25.914, Speaker A: A Twitter job fair, yeah. And so again, the job market is hot.
01:07:26.032 - 01:07:26.506, Speaker B: Like that.
01:07:26.528 - 01:07:40.350, Speaker A: Tech lead out of swell network, $100 to $200,000 a year. That's a nice paycheck. And so, yeah, I know Gemini is laying off people, but again, the newer people, the newer projects are hiring, and they're hiring bigly.
01:07:40.850 - 01:07:55.554, Speaker B: Absolutely. So make sure you get in on this if you're interested in working in web3. And why wouldn't you be, David? A few releases we got to cover. Number one, did you see this? The bankless dow. Good old bankless dow. They just released the global tax guide. All right.
01:07:55.554 - 01:07:58.766, Speaker B: I love that they did this. This is enthusiasm.
01:07:58.798 - 01:08:00.674, Speaker A: And Ryan, I'm so excited, man.
01:08:00.712 - 01:08:03.800, Speaker B: Is this the most. Why didn't we lead with this in the roll up? I'm sure.
01:08:04.970 - 01:08:08.786, Speaker A: Triple views of the week, right ahead of the optimism. Airdrop.
01:08:08.818 - 01:08:10.046, Speaker B: Yeah, forget about the airdrop.
01:08:10.098 - 01:08:10.346, Speaker A: All right?
01:08:10.368 - 01:08:27.898, Speaker B: The global tax guide from bankless Dow is here. This is the most up to date information from the US, the UK, Portugal, Spain, Australia, Poland, Russia, Brazil, Germany, a whole bunch of other jurisdictions. So it's international again, something that bankless hq could have never written. Did you see this? You know how to get this guide?
01:08:27.994 - 01:08:33.246, Speaker A: Yeah, you mint. It's kicking ass right now.
01:08:33.268 - 01:08:34.142, Speaker B: Look at this, man.
01:08:34.276 - 01:08:36.978, Speaker A: Yeah, of course, they also have some art to go with it.
01:08:37.064 - 01:08:42.242, Speaker B: Irs filings that, like, scribbled over. Man, I want to make this bigger and actually see this.
01:08:42.296 - 01:08:43.300, Speaker A: You're going to have to.
01:08:43.910 - 01:08:56.182, Speaker B: Some of these are hilarious. Anyway, go check out the global tax guide. If you are, I don't know, thinking about taxes, wondering where you should go.
01:08:56.236 - 01:09:02.810, Speaker A: Actually, if you're thinking about taxes, you might not need to mint the tax guide. If you are not thinking about taxes, you might need to go mint.
01:09:03.310 - 01:09:07.580, Speaker B: That's so true. You probably need this or at least get your CPA on this or something.
01:09:08.350 - 01:09:09.734, Speaker A: Present for your CPA.
01:09:09.862 - 01:09:28.194, Speaker B: Another man. Every single week we've had more wallets to announce. And this is a wallet from Xerion. Xerion, of course, is a fantastic defi aggregator. It's kind of like a mission control center for all of your defi wallets. And they've just released a mobile wallet. I don't know all the details, but I think this thing.
01:09:28.232 - 01:09:29.438, Speaker A: I've got the details, Ryan.
01:09:29.534 - 01:09:35.506, Speaker B: It's noncustodial, right? So that's good. So it's still bankless. But what else does this puppy do?
01:09:35.608 - 01:09:56.614, Speaker A: Oh, God, here it goes. I'm going to run through this smart trade routing through every major decentralized exchange. Multi chain support for ten networks, including Salana. When it's up, polygon, avalanche, arbitrum, binary, smart chain, optimism, gnosis chain, others, DaP compatibility with wallet connect. You'll love to see it signed transactions on any web3 app with your phone. Fiat on ramps. We love fiat on ramps.
01:09:56.614 - 01:10:16.720, Speaker A: Multi seed phrase management so you can have multiple seed phrases. And so we also love that. And also Xeroon DNA, which is an NFT generative NFT that evolves with you as you use web3. So I'm getting something like tamagotchi pet or something, a tamagotchi nft that grows up with you as your d five.
01:10:17.190 - 01:10:21.378, Speaker B: Gen activity across your wallets. It kind of adapts and molds to you.
01:10:21.464 - 01:10:31.366, Speaker A: And of course, like Ryan said at the beginning, non custodial, aka bankless. Do you think we can just stop getting people to use the word non custodial and start using the word bankless? Do you think we'll be that we.
01:10:31.388 - 01:10:47.738, Speaker B: Release the bankless wallet? That'd be amazing. I think you guys should do this. Ariane. The other thing is, this is all mobile first, which is fantastic because we need some more mobile wallets rather than just browser extensions. Here's another release this week is Volts protocol. What are these guys doing?
01:10:47.824 - 01:10:55.086, Speaker A: Yeah, volts protocol, interest rate swap mechanism, which is apparently like a bajillion dollar total addressable market.
01:10:55.268 - 01:10:57.310, Speaker B: Bajillions of. Bajillions. Bajillions.
01:10:58.370 - 01:11:22.102, Speaker A: And we're not joking. 300. The actual numbers, $372,000,000,000,000 in the world is interest rate swaps. Because this has to do with bond markets, right? Bond market yields and people can control and hedge their interest rates, blah, blah, blah. Anyways, volts protocol live on main net alpha. Launch a cap of $1 million per pool. So it might actually already be full.
01:11:22.102 - 01:11:45.374, Speaker A: But you can trade rates with leverage, so you can trade interest rate deviations with leverage and earn market neutral yield and also build the future of finance, they tweet. And so this is also the Dow that lobbied Uniswap governance to allow them to use Uniswap v. Three. The Uniswap v. Three license. Uniswap v. Three license is controlled by the Uniswap dow for like three years or something.
01:11:45.374 - 01:11:52.654, Speaker A: So volts gave the uniswap Dow something like 1% of tokens to be able to use Uniswap V three code inside of the Dow. So pretty cool.
01:11:52.772 - 01:12:30.060, Speaker B: This kind of stuff is going to be great for something we talked about last week, which was like, determining what the ETH staking yield curve is going to be in the future, right? That's why interest rate swaps are such a large market in the traditional space, like $370,000,000,000,000, just the most massive derivatives market in existence. And now, as we've said so many times, David, we are speed running the history of finance now. I don't know, were the 1950s, 1960s at least, getting these interest rate swap derivative markets up and going on DFI? I think this is going to be an absolutely massive sector, and it's just getting started.
01:12:30.430 - 01:12:52.580, Speaker A: The part of the story is the financialization of ether the asset, and all the other yield on Ethereum, but the one that we really like is ether the asset. So that is becoming more and more financialized. Volts protocol is doing it. I'm talking with Simon, founder of Volts Protocol, to come on an alpha leak episode so we can explain this thing in depth because this is like beyond my brain for comprehension. So that episode will come out sometime soon.
01:12:53.110 - 01:13:23.622, Speaker B: DeFi Saver as well. They've just announced they are live on arbitrum and optimism. So they are alive on both the optimistic rollups. If you haven't used DeFi Saver, it's just a way not to get liquidated. It's kind of like it wraps up your loan, whether it's an ave loan or whether it's a maker loan, and it makes sure that you don't get liquidated. And the DFI Saver team was really key. Do you remember in March 2020 and all of those cdps and ETH dropped to like $80? So many people were getting liquidated.
01:13:23.622 - 01:13:51.110, Speaker B: DFI Saver saved countless millions of dollars, countless liquidations from many of its community, and they've just been continuing to build. So I really love what this team is doing. It's a really useful product. If you haven't checked it out, go to DFI Saver and see what they're up to. Or just with those new optimism tokens and the new explorationary doing on layer twos, you can go see it on optimism and arbitram as well. David, what else we got, man?
01:13:51.180 - 01:14:15.162, Speaker A: We got protocol fees from immutable. So protocol fees are live. Of course. Every single blockchain needs to charge fees. If they don't, something is up. So as a result, immutable has announced that their protocol fees are live and they tweet out, this is the final step before launching IMX staking and will allow the next generation of web3 games to reach planet scale with cheap, reliable, and incentive aligned pricing. Link in the show notes.
01:14:15.162 - 01:14:26.740, Speaker A: But if you're into the whole immutable ecosystem, the IMX staking is what you're excited about. And so with protocol fees, when you actually stake your IMX, you actually get the fees. That is the idea there.
01:14:27.350 - 01:14:59.340, Speaker B: That's awesome. On the regulatory front, there's some things happening. So Senator Cynthia Lumis, she has just released a full draft, a very early preliminary draft of a landmark crypto bill. And of course, in the past has been, she's a senator who's been very crypto friendly, so it's good that this is coming from her. An early draft was sort of leaked and the bloc did a report on that. And you can look at the 70 page draft if you want. Lumis has.
01:14:59.340 - 01:15:23.314, Speaker B: Yeah, but Lumis has said it's not the full draft. Right. It's just something preliminary. It's changing a lot. And so the real announcement is going to come on June 7. So it's coming right up. But I think one of the things that I hope it does, and it seems like it's going to do, I've not read all 70 pages, David, is add some clarity as to where the CFTC starts and stops and what jurisdiction the SEC has.
01:15:23.314 - 01:16:08.162, Speaker B: And that's really what we have wanted from our legislators all along in the US and in other jurisdictions, is just give us some clarity. Okay. We don't actually know what the laws in the country are pertaining to crypto, whether it's tax clarity or whether it's commodities and securities clarity. That's what we're looking for. So hopefully this injects some of that, and hopefully it's not something that would squelch, but it's something that would foster innovation in the US if this sort of thing passes. So, TBD, wait for the 7th, wait until after, until this gains some more steam. And then, of course, it has to actually get through the Senate, which is maybe the hard part in the Senate and the House before it actually becomes a law and Biden's signature and all of these things.
01:16:08.162 - 01:16:11.474, Speaker B: So we're a long ways out, but something is happening.
01:16:11.592 - 01:16:29.782, Speaker A: Yeah, we are fighting the fight. And so thank you, Cynthia llamas, for making sure that fight gets fought in Capitol Hill. All right, one big raise of the week. And it is indeed a big one. Finance labs closes 500 million dollar fund to focus on web3 and blockchain adoption. Pretty run of the mill headline. $500 million.
01:16:29.782 - 01:16:34.730, Speaker A: That is a large number. So finance labs funding, more shenanigans. I love to see it.
01:16:34.800 - 01:16:55.374, Speaker B: Cool. Guys, there's a lot more we want to cover. First of all, questions from the nation, our new favorite segment that we end with. There's at least two questions that we've heard from the bankless community that David and I will attempt to answer. And then some hot takes from crypto, Twitter, as usual, including this take. No one actually understands the ethereum merge. I kind of agree with that.
01:16:55.374 - 01:17:01.010, Speaker B: But we'll dig into all of that when we get back. Before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
01:17:01.160 - 01:17:26.954, Speaker A: Makerdao is the OG Defi protocol. The Makerdao produces Dai, the industry's most battle tested and resilient stablecoin using Maker, you don't need to sell your collateral if you need liquidity. Instead, you can spin up a maker vault and use your collateral to mint Dai directly. With Maker, the power to mint new money is in your hands. The Maker protocol is extremely hardened and operated by one of the most experienced daos in existence. They've been here since the beginning. They've seen it all.
01:17:26.954 - 01:18:05.314, Speaker A: And so you can mint Dai with the assurance that your collateral is safe. Soon, Maker will be present on all chains and l two s so minting Dai can take place on Oasis app, Xerion, Zapper, or any other d five protocol that you use. Follow Maker on Twitter at makerdao and learn from the oldest and most resilient dow in existence. The Brave browser is the user first browser for the web3 Internet with over 50 million monthly active users. Control your digital footprint with built in privacy and ad blocking. Inside the brave browser, you'll find the brave wallet, the first secure crypto wallet built natively inside of a web3 crypto browser. Web three is freedom from big tech and Wall street, more control and better privacy.
01:18:05.314 - 01:18:37.266, Speaker A: But there's a weak point in web3, your crypto wallet. The brave wallet is different. Bravewall is built natively inside the brave browser, no extension required, which gives the brave wallet, an extra level of security versus other wallets. With the brave wallet, you can buy, store, send, and swap your crypto assets, and it can even manage your nfts and connect to other wallets and defi apps, all from the security of the best privacy browser on the market. Whether you're new to crypto or a seasoned pro, it's time to switch to the brave wallet. Download Brave@brave.com bankless and click the wallet icon to get started.
01:18:37.266 - 01:19:17.186, Speaker A: And we're back. Questions of the week if you want to get your question into the questions of the week, every Wednesday a tweet goes out of bankless asking, do you want to get your question of the week into the question of the week? So that is what you respond to. We prioritize questions with the most likes, also the slightly ones that are also the most interesting. And so this is that segment. Questions from the nation. Frogmonkey asks, will an eventually l two l three world reduce demand for main net block space? What does this mean for demand for ETH and supply? And also EIP 1559? And so I've answered this question in the form of another tweet that I found. And this actually came out of the bitcoin block size debate in 2016.
01:19:17.186 - 01:19:53.370, Speaker A: And so this is a tweet of like, I think Texas highways or maybe China or something, and it is like a 20 lane highway going in both directions. Just lanes on lanes on lanes, and they are all congested. And the concept here is something called induced demand, where if you increase the sizes of lanes, you will increase just the usage of those lanes. So you don't actually scale anything. You're not solving traffic by making more lanes, you're just making more usage of those lanes, so people just will drive more cars. And so this concept of induced demand was at the very center of the block size debates of bitcoin. In 2016.
01:19:53.370 - 01:20:54.414, Speaker A: Before bitcoin, the bitcoin block size wars forked bitcoin into bitcoin with small block sizes, aka small lanes, and bitcoin cash with big block sizes, aka many, many lanes. We all know what happened to the bitcoin cash versus bitcoin. It was like been down only ever since. And so this is also at the heart of Ethereum scaling strategy. Rather than scaling Ethereum, at the layer one, we're going to make instead of more lanes, more highways, more highways going in different directions to route demand elsewhere around the layer one. So instead of inducing more demand at the layer one, we just create layer twos, which keeps the layer one safe and secure. And so, frog, to answer your question, what does Ethereum like burning rate do in a layer two, layer three world? And demand for ETH, I expect, and especially as we were talking about earlier, as layer twos become bigger and bigger and bigger, they're actually going to bully people out of the layer one because they're going to price them out of the layer one.
01:20:54.414 - 01:21:52.954, Speaker A: So it's the layer twos that are going to be these big massive buses, these convoys of buses on the very, very low lane highway of the Ethereum layer one. But it's going to be transporting a lot of people because it's like buses or trains rather than individual cars. The adoption of layer twos is going to, in the same way that we saw immutable x fighting for the borde to ape ecosystem, all these layer twos will create demand that ethereum layer one will never have been able to do, like highways going into new cities that ethereum layer one wouldn't have been able to build and attract more demand. And so I see layer twos, layer threes as Ethereum increasing its surface area for the ultimate demand of that very small constrained block space at the layer one. And so they are not parasitic. They actually are net generative because they enable new economic activity, new places to go. For the Ethereum layer one via routing to layer twos and layer threes.
01:21:52.954 - 01:21:54.618, Speaker A: Anything you want to add to that, Ryan?
01:21:54.714 - 01:22:39.342, Speaker B: Yeah, I would just say we're never going to have enough block space, is the thing. In the same way, your computer will never have enough storage, enough memory, enough processing power, because as soon as you get more storage, more memory, more processing power, you will have applications that start to consume more of those things. Chrome, it's very much like. Yeah, like Chrome, like chrome tabs. I got a new laptop and all it means is so I could have more chrome tabs, and all it means is the apps on my laptop in the future are going to continue to consume more system resources. Very similar to bandwidth too, right? Think of layer twos as like, adding bandwidth to trustless transaction space, trustless block space. That's really what we're doing.
01:22:39.342 - 01:23:08.898, Speaker B: And will the world ever have enough bandwidth? No, because we'll just create more applications that use more bandwidth and we'll continue to use it all. I think that's similar to what's going on here. All right, here's the next question, David. What do you think is one of the most useful use cases of Ethereum that we have not yet deeply discovered, but that will be very big in the next ten years. So most useful use case of Ethereum not discovered. That will be very big within ten years. What do you think, David?
01:23:08.994 - 01:23:51.078, Speaker A: Yeah, so the funny thing is, while we were prepping this agenda, Ryan and I came up with our answers independently, and they were the same answer, which is how you know that we're onto something. Identity, verifiable credentials, off chain identity, decentralized identity. How do we get. This is like non financial use cases of Ethereum. How do we get a self sovereign identity system built into our crypto systems that can attest to who we are and what we do as humans in ways that is also private and secure? Tomorrow I'm actually recording with Vitalik Buterin and Evan McMullen because we have a debate on our hands. And this is actually Ryan. The first time I've actually disagreed with Vitalik about something, and I actually feel like I have the evidence to back it up.
01:23:51.078 - 01:23:54.198, Speaker A: We're going to see how well I do. I don't know how that's going to.
01:23:54.204 - 01:23:54.978, Speaker B: Go for you, David.
01:23:55.074 - 01:24:41.234, Speaker A: I'm not the one debating. However, I also don't know if this is going to be a debate. We are literally going to just figure out what you do with a soul bound NFT versus an off chain verifiable credential. And so the answer to the question identity and decentralized verifiable credentials, rather than just like Harvard giving you your credential of you graduated as a piece of paper, we can have Vitalik says a soul bound NFT, or Evan McMullen says an off chain verifiable credential. How this emerges is TBD, but there's consensus on this is the next big thing in Ethereum is decentralized identity, credible attestations as to who you are. Kind of like your DGEN score. Just like, yeah, you have done the things and therefore you have this.
01:24:41.234 - 01:25:17.874, Speaker A: Like a DGEn score is like a new web3 version of a credit score, right? Like you did all the DjEn stuff on Ethereum. People have hired other people. Funds have hired people based on their DGEN score because it's an attestation of their experiences and who they are and how well informed they are. And so, like bankless DAo issuing a credential, as you have been an active governance voter like compound, saying you've kept your eth in here for over two years, here's that credential. We can have a more illustrative expression of our identity with these types of credentials that can unlock use cases that we can't even dream of at the moment.
01:25:17.992 - 01:25:42.678, Speaker B: Yeah, I think if you zoom out and think about what crypto does, these are just basically trust computers, trust machines. Right. And so what sort of applications require trust? Well, number one, we did the money thing. That's super important, right. Money requires some level of decentralization, a trust computer, in order to create on the Internet. So we've done that. We've also done banking and kind of finance.
01:25:42.678 - 01:26:22.690, Speaker B: We've also done property. The next major thing that requires a trust machine, a trust computer, is identity. And that's the thing that we have yet to solve. Has not been a breakout use case at all for crypto yet, but we're starting to see that germinate and that is going to be massively impactful, probably, as the poster asks, a very big thing within the next ten years that is not yet deeply discovered. I definitely put a lot of money on identity being a breakout transformational use case. I don't know where the investment opportunities are in that, by the way. I think they're going to emerge.
01:26:22.690 - 01:26:39.482, Speaker B: But as far as transformational application that blockchain is uniquely positioned to give us, that's like a thing that is going to be absolutely huge. And if you think about it, it's like, where do we get our identity today? Is passports, the nation state issues. Right.
01:26:39.536 - 01:26:42.122, Speaker A: We are given it by the government to us.
01:26:42.176 - 01:26:42.538, Speaker B: Exactly.
01:26:42.624 - 01:26:44.122, Speaker A: They tell us what our identity is.
01:26:44.176 - 01:26:51.854, Speaker B: Exactly. So we have to change that. And this is going to be very important for our digital freedom going into, as we continue in the 21st century, man.
01:26:51.892 - 01:27:06.130, Speaker A: Also, I will say that there are going to be like DFI yield farming, for example, was a blowout use case in 2020. No one saw that coming. So in addition to identity, there's going to be like 17 other massive use cases that no one's going to see coming to. We just don't know what those are.
01:27:06.200 - 01:27:13.766, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. TBD. All right, let's get to some takes for the week. This is a take from FUBAR. Do you want to read this?
01:27:13.868 - 01:27:34.778, Speaker A: Yeah. FUBAR says, quote, the merge is already priced in the market. Must be discounting execution risk. And then he more seriously follows up with my friend, the market doesn't even know the difference between Robson, which is an Ethereum testnet and Mainet. So that got a bunch of likes. This is after this market meditations Twitter account goes breaking. Ethereum merge scheduled for June eigth.
01:27:34.778 - 01:27:39.002, Speaker A: No, that's the Robson testnet merge market meditations.
01:27:39.146 - 01:27:41.662, Speaker B: I subscribe to that. What are they doing?
01:27:41.796 - 01:28:00.726, Speaker A: Mark Bailen follows up and says, laughed at this for a solid minute at the tweet and kept scrolling. But holy crap, you're actually right. This bear market is going to be a lot of fun. Yeah. The degree that people don't know what the actual true details of the merge are. Hope. I hope vacless listeners know because we've been hounding it for a very long time now.
01:28:00.726 - 01:28:10.054, Speaker A: People that listen to Anthony Cesano on the daily way, they definitely know beyond that. Ryan, I'm not yet convinced that many people know and understand what the magnitude of the merge actually.
01:28:10.092 - 01:28:15.558, Speaker B: I agree. Well, it's bullish if you're front running the opportunity, aren't you? Not in the Nate chastity.
01:28:15.654 - 01:28:18.826, Speaker A: In the good way, in the way you won't get arrested, in a way.
01:28:18.848 - 01:28:52.306, Speaker B: Where you're not going to get arrested. This is what investors should be doing, is front running this informational arbitrage that they have by educating themselves. David, here's a tweet from Kevin Owaki. I feel like he's laying out a new mental model for us. This is the Dow human actor trilemma, and what we're seeing is, of course, one of these famous triangles with a trilemma here. And I want you to explain this to us, but you have to choose two of three. Either shared action, shared context, or shared consent.
01:28:52.306 - 01:29:04.554, Speaker B: So all of these things are shared, but I can either choose shared action, shared context, or shared consent, and I only get to pick two of these three. What is he talking about? Right.
01:29:04.592 - 01:30:01.658, Speaker A: He's talking about daos and their difficulty of scale. And this is really the big Dao problem. Kevin Owaki, big Dao thinker, kind of knows what he's talking about, definitely from experience as well. And so if you have shared consent, as in everyone in the community agrees that this is the right thing to do, and you also have shared context as to why you are doing it, you are likely going to be missing shared action, which is going to be what he calls legitimate inaction, as in the choices that are being made are legitimate, but the direction that they're going in are illegitimate, as in, like, we got that wrong. And then you can combine shared action, as in, all the Dow is working towards a shared goal and also shared context as the reasoning why we are working towards that goal. So if you have those things, you have illegitimate action because you forgot to have shared consent, as in people made choices without the rest of the Dao. So then the risks for that are like what he calls consent debt, as in some parts of the Dow don't feel heard.
01:30:01.658 - 01:30:30.570, Speaker A: People will fork off the Dow and make their own dao. And then you can combine shared consent with shared action. And so everyone in the DAO agrees. Everyone in the DAO agrees where to go, but they are missing shared context, and so you have misdirected action, as in, the DAO agrees that they need to go somewhere, but they forgot to figure out the right direction to go towards. And he goes. Shared context takes time, full context, harder in complex systems. And so this is like the trilemma of Tao's.
01:30:30.570 - 01:30:36.694, Speaker A: It's really hard to get all three. It's not impossible, but getting all of these is very, very difficult.
01:30:36.732 - 01:30:52.970, Speaker B: Yeah, this seems like a problem because we either get misdirected action, which is kind of bad in our decision making, or we get legitimate inaction, which is bad because you're not actually doing anything, or you get illegitimate action, which is bad because a whole bunch of the community doesn't actually agree.
01:30:53.040 - 01:30:55.934, Speaker A: Yeah, you are doing something, but people forgot to agree on it.
01:30:55.972 - 01:31:00.522, Speaker B: Okay, well, I always hate presenting a problem without a solution. Does this thing have a solution?
01:31:00.586 - 01:31:06.020, Speaker A: Right now, I think the solution is to follow Kevin Owalki on Twitter and wait for him to figure it out.
01:31:07.510 - 01:31:23.942, Speaker B: We're experimenting with dows, right? We're trying to figure out how to solve the trilemmas as we're solving other trilemmas in crypto. But I bet you solve it with technology. Yeah, well, I don't know. I mean, can you solve governance with technology? Yeah.
01:31:23.996 - 01:31:32.140, Speaker A: You can share information better with technology. Yeah. This is like the crypto way. It's like, if we have a problem, we'll just write code until we fix it.
01:31:32.590 - 01:31:40.710, Speaker B: I do think, you know, the point that we made on the Mark Andreessen Chris Dixon podcast of Crypto, speed running not only finance, but it's also speed running human governance.
01:31:40.790 - 01:31:41.414, Speaker A: Right, totally.
01:31:41.462 - 01:32:32.122, Speaker B: I think some of the things I've been doing is looking back in history with that book recommendation list that Mark Andreessen recommended. I've been starting to go through that, and one of the books on his list is a conflict of visions. And it goes through the history of all of these great philosophers and political thinkers in the past, the godwins of the world and the Hobbes and the Rousseau's. And I've been probably underexposed to many of these thinkers, but it's so striking to hear them articulate, like, they're contemplating the best structure for a free nation state. Right. And at the very early stages of the nation state. Now here we are at the very early stages of the crypto digital nation and wrestling with many of these same problems, only with a slightly different context.
01:32:32.122 - 01:32:47.010, Speaker B: So sometimes it's helpful to actually go backward in time and hear the original form post of the original form posts and arguments of the philosophers, because, yeah, there can be some answers there as well. And I wonder if we might find some.
01:32:47.160 - 01:32:51.234, Speaker A: Yeah, we've been here before. Humanity has done this before.
01:32:51.352 - 01:32:51.854, Speaker B: Totally.
01:32:51.902 - 01:33:03.302, Speaker A: All right, last tweet of the week, Anthony says on it goes ethereum. Evm. Evm. Evm. Evm. Evm. And he is tweeting out the daily transaction fees on one of David Mihal's crypto fees site.
01:33:03.302 - 01:33:23.998, Speaker A: And it goes, ethereum, actually, ethereum, binance, smart chain, optimism, arbitramone, one, avalanche polygon, which correlates to actually ethereum. Then EVM chain. EVM chain. It's all evms, all the way down. So I know people might call me an Ethereum Maxi, but if you're going to do that, get it right and call me an EVM Maxi, because that's the actual epicenter of the crypto world.
01:33:24.084 - 01:33:25.738, Speaker B: Oh, really? You're an EVM maxi?
01:33:25.834 - 01:33:26.286, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:33:26.388 - 01:33:27.342, Speaker B: Is that what you are?
01:33:27.476 - 01:33:27.946, Speaker A: Evm?
01:33:27.978 - 01:33:29.402, Speaker B: Neither, sir. Neither.
01:33:29.466 - 01:33:30.986, Speaker A: You're a decentralization maxi.
01:33:31.018 - 01:33:32.394, Speaker B: Yeah, that's me. What are you bullish on, David?
01:33:32.442 - 01:33:52.166, Speaker A: Same. I am bullish. Well, first off, I'm very, very bullish on Brooklyn because I'm going there. I'm in this space between apartments, hence why there's a space background this week. But I go out to Brooklyn. But overall, what I'm bullish on is just like the sheer amount of surface area that is coming onto Ethereum. We got the optimism layer two, plus its token now.
01:33:52.166 - 01:34:25.520, Speaker A: So now it's real. We have connects and hop bridging between arbitram and optimism and all the other layer twos. We have the ZK roll ups of immutable, which is a layer two, but then there's layer threes on top of that. And so GameStop is getting built on a layer three on immutable. And so all these things are going to create an insane amount of surface area, which is perfect for what we need in a build market, which is surface area to build on. And kind of like we were talking about, like avalanche versus immutable. Just surface area is onboarding surface area.
01:34:25.520 - 01:34:49.702, Speaker A: Also, at the same time, we have so many protocols going live. We had vaults go live this week. We have all these other applications go live this week. The amount of things that are going live over the next twelve months is absolutely insane. And I know these because I'm talking to some of these founders. And so the reason what I'm bullish on, what I'm bullish on, it's the build market. Again, it's the build market.
01:34:49.702 - 01:34:54.298, Speaker A: But no, the beautiful thing about all these protocols going live is, like, we have shit to talk about.
01:34:54.464 - 01:34:55.178, Speaker B: Oh, yeah.
01:34:55.264 - 01:35:01.020, Speaker A: So I'm bullish on bankless podcasts because there's so much left to talk about over the next year.
01:35:02.670 - 01:35:23.170, Speaker B: Weren't we always talking about, like, hey, when the next bear market comes, we'll go take a vacation? I don't think that's going to be possible. It's not like a bear market where it's quiet, like in 2018, where people are just debating back and forth and there was some building. It's like, there's so much to talk about because so much it's getting built. It's different this time. This time it's different. Okay.
01:35:23.240 - 01:35:44.826, Speaker A: Different. There's a tweet that did make it into the takes. I think it was from Vance Spencer, where you're not supposed to count your net worth. From my net worth from the peak of the 2017 bubble to the peak of the 2022 bubble is one number. But he tweeted out, the actual thing that you should count is, like, your net worth from the bottom of the bear market to the bottom of this bear market.
01:35:44.928 - 01:35:45.578, Speaker B: Oh, cool.
01:35:45.664 - 01:35:58.894, Speaker A: Yeah. Right? Like, interesting, interesting perception, right? And when my net worth hit zero, so I am up an infinity amount of percentages since the 2017. Anyway, some perspective there. But, yeah, this bear market, different this time.
01:35:59.012 - 01:36:00.862, Speaker B: I think that's a good take. Definitely.
01:36:00.996 - 01:36:02.878, Speaker A: Yeah. Ryan, what are you bullish on?
01:36:03.044 - 01:36:10.930, Speaker B: I got to say, optimism, what a fantastic airdrop. Right? It's like, second largest in history in terms of almost the first largest in history.
01:36:11.000 - 01:36:12.046, Speaker A: Potentially. First largest.
01:36:12.078 - 01:36:49.118, Speaker B: Yeah, potentially. And this does something that uniswap didn't do, which is it incensed the migration to layer two, which means it's incenting more building, incenting more public goods, incenting less congestion on Ethereum main nets, like, actually solving the scalability problem that we've all wanted solved for a long time. And it's here and it's working. And, man, I've just been using optimism and arbitram two and other layer twos, and they just work really well. It's just like, I'm blown away by how well all of this stuff works at this point in time. And again back to this time. It's different.
01:36:49.118 - 01:37:38.926, Speaker B: Last time during the B market, all we had were vague promises of scalability. Okay. Like there's this thing called state channels and the radio network and plasma and all of the. And then sharding might be on the horizon, but it was so distant. It was a lot of vapor, to be honest. This time we actually have it. So I'm excited about that, David, and I'm excited about airdrop opportunities, because I would far rather communities start to give away this land right now during the bear market, when it's a bunch of settlers, not a bunch of liquidity locusts that are jumping from chain to chain, like when it's relatively quiet and when the true community has stuck behind to actually start building on these things and settling on these.
01:37:38.926 - 01:38:01.906, Speaker B: Layer two. So I'm actually glad that all of these airdrops are happening now, because it's happening to, I guess I would say, the true community and not the speculators and the traders of the world. So optimism is here. Airdrops are here. Layer two. Summer. Even though it's happening during a bear market, it's better that still summertime.
01:38:01.906 - 01:38:02.950, Speaker B: That's what I'm excited about.
01:38:03.020 - 01:38:04.674, Speaker A: Yeah, it is still summertime.
01:38:04.802 - 01:38:08.998, Speaker B: That's right. So that's it, man. You want to hop to the meme of the week?
01:38:09.084 - 01:38:10.678, Speaker A: Meme of the week? Let's do it.
01:38:10.844 - 01:38:16.186, Speaker B: All right, what are we looking at here? This is your meme. I thought this was hilarious, but maybe for different reasons than you did.
01:38:16.288 - 01:38:35.486, Speaker A: Yeah. This is like a CNBC poll, like on Twitter, and it goes, is inflation infecting your family? So Americans were pulled. Is inflation affecting your family? And 122% of Americans said no. And 195% of Americans said yes. I thought that was pretty funny.
01:38:35.518 - 01:38:36.930, Speaker B: This is on CNBC.
01:38:37.750 - 01:38:41.070, Speaker A: No, I'm pretty sure this is Photoshop. I'm pretty sure this is edited.
01:38:41.230 - 01:38:55.366, Speaker B: Okay, so this didn't actually happen. All right. The reason I think this is so funny is because it's just like, hasn't the world gotten so asinine where you look at this and you can actually, this could be a poll that somebody runs, I don't know, the 2020.
01:38:55.548 - 01:39:00.502, Speaker A: This was like, oh, you actually didn't realize it was fake because the don't know.
01:39:00.556 - 01:39:27.646, Speaker B: Or it could be fake. The question of the, whether it's fake or not, does it matter? Does it even matter? There's just such an absurdist undertone to the existing structures and institutions are kind of eroding and becoming untrustworthy. So this question, almost like the answer to this question, almost makes sense. Maybe I'm overanalyzing the meme David, but that's the way it hit me.
01:39:27.748 - 01:39:28.400, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:39:31.270 - 01:39:35.042, Speaker B: That'S all we got, man. Hey, next time are you going to be in your new place when you do this roll up?
01:39:35.176 - 01:39:45.794, Speaker A: Maybe I need to figure out. I won't have a desk there yet, but I could go buy a desk and then put it there. So TBD. TBD if there's a nice big brick background.
01:39:45.922 - 01:39:49.670, Speaker B: So if you don't have a desk though, you'd like do it in a studio somewhere. Did you find that?
01:39:49.740 - 01:40:00.166, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm subletting a friend's room, sublighting an apartment because that's where our bed is. Still don't have a bed, but I still have my apartment. So I'm going to put my shit in the apartment and we'll go from there. So TBD.
01:40:00.198 - 01:40:07.374, Speaker B: Awesome, man. All right, so next week, guys, the first roll up. David, broadcast from New York City from Brooklyn. That'll be hitting you next week.
01:40:07.412 - 01:40:07.822, Speaker A: Of course.
01:40:07.876 - 01:40:21.778, Speaker B: As always, guys, none of this has been financial advice. ETH is risky, crypto is risky. You could definitely lose what you put in, but we are headed west.
