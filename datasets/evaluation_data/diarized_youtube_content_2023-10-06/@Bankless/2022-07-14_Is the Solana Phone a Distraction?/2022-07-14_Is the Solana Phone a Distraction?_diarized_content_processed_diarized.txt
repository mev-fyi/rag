00:00:00.170 - 00:00:13.722, Speaker B: Some people are saying, like, Anitoli Raj, look, building a scalable blockchain is freaking hard enough, and, like, there's a lot of work to do. Is this a distraction or why not have a separate team do this? Why are you guys personally involved?
00:00:13.786 - 00:00:54.380, Speaker A: For the same reason that you can't add more engineers and accelerate the merge. We need experts that are deep working on hard problems, and a lot of those hard problems are solved by only one engineer that just give and time and space to do it. And there's a really strong core team of system engineers that are constantly iterating on the chain and making it better and cheaper and faster and more reliable. People think it's a distraction, but part of the reason why this idea came to fruition is that I talked to devs and I constantly ask him, what are the problems you're dealing with? What are the challenges? And half of the conversations ended up mobile. We can't do what we want. And when that problem gets repeated to me over and over, I start pacing around the room trying to figure out how do I fix it.
