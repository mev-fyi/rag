00:00:00.410 - 00:00:18.382, Speaker A: Man, what would it be like if society, like, totally broke down and we lost electricity, lost Internet? Like, how long could I last? And that in that sort of a situation, the truth is, like, not very damn long. Good morning, bankless nation. David, what time is it?
00:00:18.436 - 00:00:29.750, Speaker B: Oh, Ryan. It's the Friday weekly roll up time where we roll up the entire week in crypto, which is always an ambitious endeavor, yet we do it anyway ways nonetheless, because it's always the best show of the week, at least in my opinion.
00:00:31.130 - 00:00:35.654, Speaker A: Happy new year, man. This is our first show of 2022. How are you feeling about this year so far?
00:00:35.772 - 00:00:52.640, Speaker B: God, already a very bumpy, wild week for the first week of 2022. I'm kind of thinking that 2022 is going to be way crazier, and I think we're crazier all around.
00:00:54.770 - 00:00:56.094, Speaker A: It started off that way.
00:00:56.132 - 00:00:56.718, Speaker B: Okay.
00:00:56.884 - 00:01:11.746, Speaker A: Market volatility. By the way, man, my power was off for like two days. Okay. 48 hours, right? The AI was down here. Yeah, totally down, man. Everything about me was down. There was that.
00:01:11.746 - 00:01:32.998, Speaker A: And then yesterday, my Internet turned off again. Midday. I ran downstairs to go check my router. I slipped and fell on my staircase and fell straight on my back. Got the wind knocked out of me. And then I remember just like, in between my breaths being like, oh, my God, is this what 2022 is going to be like flat on my back, not able to breathe?
00:01:33.094 - 00:01:36.534, Speaker B: Yeah. It has felt like that in so many different respects.
00:01:36.662 - 00:01:40.026, Speaker A: Yeah. Or maybe this is the worst week of 2022 and it's all up.
00:01:40.048 - 00:01:41.594, Speaker B: Only up only from here. Only.
00:01:41.632 - 00:01:50.174, Speaker A: I don't know. We'll see. But, guys, we are going to get into it. A few things on the agenda for today. We got to talk about the Fed meeting. Okay. Jerome Powell strikes again.
00:01:50.174 - 00:02:07.998, Speaker A: This time it's hitting crypto markets. We'll talk about that. That is the reason the markets are down in the dumps. Also openc. Lots of stuff to talk about at OpenC. A 13 billion valuation, but like one token. Right? Also, there's some drama about OpenC maybe freezing nfts.
00:02:07.998 - 00:02:30.106, Speaker A: We're going to dig into that. And OpenC also had a comeback month in December. We'll talk about that a little bit, too. So tons of stuff to discuss today on the roll up. David, before we get in, we got to talk a little bit about our friends at on Juno. They wanted us to get the word out about these magical checking accounts, these checking accounts for crypto natives. You got to check this out.
00:02:30.106 - 00:02:44.154, Speaker A: So, David, I know you're like me, right? So you have your Coinbase accounts, you have your Ethereum address. We do all your bankless things, but you still got your old fashioned Wells Fargo account. We're not fully bankless.
00:02:44.202 - 00:02:44.414, Speaker B: Right.
00:02:44.452 - 00:03:06.374, Speaker A: And so you have to maintain a traditional bank account if you want to do things in the real world. But the problem with your traditional bank account is it sucks. It sucks, in particular for crypto natives. Like, there's no way in Wells Fargo for me to purchase ethereum, or there's no way for me to receive a paycheck in bitcoin or eth or get.
00:03:06.412 - 00:03:07.958, Speaker B: Any yield at all.
00:03:08.124 - 00:03:38.690, Speaker A: Yeah, it's totally disconnected. So on Juno is this cool, I guess, neo bank that is very much connected to the crypto world. It's a bank account, a checking account for crypto natives, and there's lots of cool things you can do with it. The first is you could start to receive your paychecks in crypto, which that's a huge unlock. So you can earn paycheck with your paycheck in crypto. You can also save, get 4% yields using USDC. You can also invest.
00:03:38.690 - 00:04:00.106, Speaker A: You can buy crypto at zero fees. This is my account. I recently created one. And look, I mean, it has a portfolio tab here you can check out. You also get a card with this too, like a virtual card with a debit card. So it's like this crypto native bank account that straddles both worlds. I think it's going to be a nice hybrid solution for me moving forward.
00:04:00.106 - 00:04:09.782, Speaker A: There's some good news, too, for bankless listeners. I think there's a $50 incentive to open up an on Juno account. You want to talk about that, David?
00:04:09.846 - 00:04:23.760, Speaker B: Yeah, $50 if you use the code bankless to sign up with on Juno in your preferred crypto asset. And overall, the UI on Juno is just exactly the UI I wish I had with my Wells Fargo account.
00:04:24.130 - 00:04:39.274, Speaker A: Yeah, so Pretty awesome. Guys, go create that account. You guys could get started. There's a link in the show notes to that. And remember to use the code bankless to get that $50 off. Also, David, another PSA. The Ethereum research team is doing an AMA on Reddit tomorrow.
00:04:39.274 - 00:04:45.638, Speaker A: I love those amas, man. There's so much learning that's dropped. Where's that going to be? Is there a link in the show notes or something?
00:04:45.724 - 00:05:15.054, Speaker B: Yeah, people will have to go to the r ethereum subreddit in order to get that done. There's not a link yet, I do not believe, but it is happening at 01:00 p.m. UTC time. Which I believe is, I think it's probably just going to be going on all day today, the day of the listeners listening to this. If you are listening to this on Friday. But yeah, this will be in the r ethereum, Reddit, I believe people are already asking questions. So in our ethereum, yeah, there is already a link.
00:05:15.054 - 00:05:33.570, Speaker B: We will have a link in the show notes, and people already are asking questions there. So we'll probably also pick out some of these responses, questions and responses, and cover some of the best ones in the roll up next week, probably. But if you want to get your question asked or just read all of them, go ahead and go to the link in the show notes to check out the AMA.
00:05:33.730 - 00:05:48.666, Speaker A: All right, let's get to markets. David, bitcoin, bitcoin time, the tumble, the sad music is playing. Bitcoin falls below 43k. It's even lower at the time of recording. Leads to 800 million in crypto liquidations. This is the headline, what's going on in bitcoin world.
00:05:48.768 - 00:06:18.510, Speaker B: Yeah, we had one of those big oof candles where we fell from the high, high price of $46,000 down to 42 and a half, $1,000 currently at $43,000 overall, down 7.5% on the week. I'm not a trader, we're not traders here, but there was a trend line that bitcoin broke through. You can see it here on the YouTube here as well. We were really hoping to not break below $46,000 yet we did it anyways. So here we are. Traders are fearful.
00:06:18.510 - 00:06:20.934, Speaker B: State of fear in the crypto markets right now.
00:06:21.052 - 00:06:28.150, Speaker A: Flat on your back in 2022. And how about eth? What's going on with ETH price? It looks like it went the way of bitcoin as well.
00:06:28.220 - 00:06:42.934, Speaker B: Yeah, same deal started the week at $3,800, fell down to the low price of $3,330, has currently climbed and reclaimed $3,400, but overall, down 7% on the week. So an oof week in the crypto markets.
00:06:43.062 - 00:06:51.822, Speaker A: Let's go through a few other metrics, and let's just talk about what this means after that. But let's take a look at the ratio. So the ETh to bitcoin ratio, what's that looking like right now?
00:06:51.876 - 00:07:04.818, Speaker B: Yeah, last week started the week at zero eight. We are at zero 79. So fell down below that eight meme line. Nothing really much to report there. Overall, still looking okay. Still looking pretty good.
00:07:04.984 - 00:07:13.158, Speaker A: We'll have to monitor it. How about the bed index? So that's a third DFI a third bitcoin and a third ETh. What are we looking at on the week?
00:07:13.244 - 00:07:26.170, Speaker B: Started the week at $144, currently at $127, down 10.5% on the week, which means that the DPI tokens took an even bigger hit than bitcoin and ether.
00:07:26.750 - 00:07:51.038, Speaker A: Okay, so what's going on, man? What's happening in 2022? Should we talk about some of the Fed minutes? Because I think this is. You can't always attribute crypto market movements or even general markets. You usually cannot stories. You usually cannot. But in this case, I think you definitely can. So Jerome Powell and the Fed had a meeting. They talked about shrinking the balance sheet.
00:07:51.038 - 00:08:14.778, Speaker A: They talked about getting a bit more hawkish, including reiterating that they intended to raise the rates this year. I think the shrinking the balance sheet statement was the one that caught the market most off guard. And stocks tumbled. Crypto tumbled along with it all. The risk on assets really went down as a result of this. Do you think this was the primary catalyst for the wreckage that we saw over the last couple of days?
00:08:14.864 - 00:08:35.810, Speaker B: I think the timing is pretty hard to ignore. It happened right at the release of the minutes. It happened at the same time as traditional equities. Markets also took a tumble. So this happened across the board. This was correlated in all assets ever. And so just because of the nature of the money printer, all assets are kind of risk on assets at this moment.
00:08:35.810 - 00:09:09.222, Speaker B: And so when the Fed says they're going to be raising interest rates, all assets take a tumble. So I think it's a pretty clear connection. There are other possible explanations. We're going to get into this later in the show. Kazakhstan had a massive power outage which caused bitcoin to lose, I think, 13% of its hash power, which is pretty significant. And that can stoke some selling pressure from miners. If 13% of hash power disappears, miners can go risk off themselves, and that can also create downward pressures for the whole rest of the market if bitcoin gets sold off en masse.
00:09:09.222 - 00:09:24.142, Speaker B: So it could be other things as well. But I think this one is definitely the hawkishness from the Fed. The possibility of raising interest rates beyond what the market expected. It's got to be in the lead for the biggest reason why the markets took the tumble that they did.
00:09:24.276 - 00:09:41.970, Speaker A: It's interesting. I think this is going to be a story to track all year, David. So talk about a theme of 2022. It's going to be, what is the Fed doing? Right. It's like last year, what were they doing? They were continuing to print money it was kind stasis. But this year there's some inflation pressures. The type of inflation the Fed cares about is CPI.
00:09:41.970 - 00:10:19.378, Speaker A: That's what everyone notices. That's what politicians notice. And it's been 7% here recently in the US. It's like 5% in the euro. The ECB I read recently. So it's like inflation fears are causing central bankers to take a more hawkish stance. But they can only do that so much because when the markets tumble like this in this way, that's also bad for the optics and also kind of against the principles that the Fed has of making sure that the economy continues to function.
00:10:19.378 - 00:10:30.870, Speaker A: So it's kind of a rock and a hard place. And I think that'll be a major theme for 2022, is like, how does the Fed navigate this? How do they string that line through the eye of the needle?
00:10:31.370 - 00:10:48.794, Speaker B: 100%? It's going to be, yeah, you're totally right. Watching them thread that needle is going to be. I kind of think it's an impossible needle to thread. And so seeing how they do it is always going to be interesting, no matter what, because it kind of maybe can't be done. So the fallout from that is going to be interesting.
00:10:48.992 - 00:11:08.706, Speaker A: Absolutely. All right, let's talk about this. Something that was up now, everything else was down, is metamask users. Active users been up. So 21 million monthly active users since April. And what's interesting about this from Lee Jin, so she's coming on the podcast as well. We're going to talk about a number of things.
00:11:08.706 - 00:11:33.226, Speaker A: Maybe we could bring this up. If you compare this to monthly active users of Facebook, it's close to 1%. It's 0.7%. Right now, metamask has, versus Facebook, it's about 6% of Twitter's monthly active users. And it's about the rate of the number of Internet users in 1996. Feels about right. What year is crypto in? Maybe it's 1996.
00:11:33.328 - 00:11:40.090, Speaker B: Well, hang on. We got a control for population inflation, and so it's actually got to be like 94 93.
00:11:40.240 - 00:12:00.846, Speaker A: Okay, 94 93. And this is like, monthly active users is only one measure, of course, of the usage of this thing. I think because this is an Internet of value also market cap and the value and the fact that we're at $2 trillion is another fantastic measure of this whole thing. But what do you make of this monthly active users on metamask?
00:12:00.958 - 00:12:23.734, Speaker B: Monthly active metamask, it's a great signal because everyone uses metamask except for the salana ecosystem. Even if you're getting onboarded to polygon. If you're getting onboarded to avalanche, you're using metamask. Pick your l two. You're using metamask. And so it's a pretty high signal of just very general rate of adoption, granted. Like, I have two computers, and so I have metamask on there twice.
00:12:23.734 - 00:12:30.090, Speaker B: I also have metamask on my phone. Do I count as three? Probably, but it's directionally always a pretty good signal.
00:12:30.510 - 00:12:58.294, Speaker A: It's kind of like the netscape of the Internet, if you will. That's really what metamask is in a lot of ways. Let's talk about this, too, David. There's this fantastic report from Electric Capital, and they do this every year. I feel like it gets better every year, more detailed in a lot of ways. And what they try to do is they go through the developer metrics from each of the ecosystems and track that over time. And so there are a few highlights from this that maybe we want to get into.
00:12:58.294 - 00:13:32.446, Speaker A: I'll start with the first one that I saw, and that is this. Web three developers are at all time highs right now. Okay, 18,400 developers, that's up. It's almost double from the start of 2021. So we kind of doubled the amount of developers in the web3 ecosystem in 2021, which is pretty crazy. David, why don't you talk about this one? Because this is super interesting. Why do the developers come in here? Is it like, because they're excited? Why is it.
00:13:32.548 - 00:13:58.998, Speaker B: Well, I think the line, show me the incentives and I'll show you the outcome is really rings true here. When price goes up, when number goes up, it attracts everything. Everything always gets attracted to capital, and that includes developers. And so when price goes up, developers also goes up. The interesting thing here is that, and this is why we always know in crypto. Crypto is a one way street. People don't come into crypto, and then they're like, nah, I'm going to leave now.
00:13:58.998 - 00:14:17.258, Speaker B: When you come into crypto, you tend to stay. And so when prices go down, developers stay flat. And so bad prices means that we just don't get any new developers. We don't lose any developers. We just don't get any new ones. And so when price goes up, we get new developers. When price goes down, we don't lose any developers.
00:14:17.258 - 00:14:36.386, Speaker B: And so this is kind of why crypto is always a waiting game. Like, you can zoom in on the markets and be like, oh, it's up 5%. Oh, it's up down percent, down 5%. But it's just a waiting game. You can just wait out the markets until the developers build out crypto into the vision of the future that we have for it, and then prices will be up. It's just how it works. You can just wait it out.
00:14:36.386 - 00:14:38.366, Speaker B: The developers aren't going anywhere.
00:14:38.558 - 00:15:05.562, Speaker A: Yeah, I totally agree. And it's really interesting how that floor gets painted at the peak of the last cycle becomes kind of the floor for the next cycle. Chris Dixon in our podcast with him, he's like, I don't pay attention to prices so much. I'm sure he does a little bit, but he's like, I pay attention to the talent inflows in the space, and that's what I track. And this is an interesting way to track that. It's interesting, too, if you chart it by ecosystem as well. So you can compare some of the layer one ecosystems.
00:15:05.562 - 00:15:37.366, Speaker A: Ethereum, Polkadot, Cosmos, salana, bitcoin. Those are the five largest ethereum really far and away in the lead in terms of its mindshare and developer count. And this is not just protocol development, but this is the entire ecosystem. Now, keep in mind, layer development, application, layer two. These metrics aren't, like, foolproof. So they're tracking GitHub, they're tracking open source projects primarily. They're directionally correct, but the data doesn't always reflect the entire truth here.
00:15:37.366 - 00:16:04.846, Speaker A: But Ethereum definitely cemented in the number one slot. Number two is actually Polkadot, according to this, which I found surprising. Then you've got bitcoin, Cosmos, and Solana right behind it. Here's another graph of the same thing. This is if you compare the developer ecosystems from day zero, and you do sort of an apples to apples comparison of where they are, and you kind of track the numbers here. What are some of your takeaways from this?
00:16:04.948 - 00:16:29.186, Speaker B: Yeah, actually, if you go up to the very first graph, I really want to pay attention to, especially on graphs like this, the very first graph, the area under the curve is really, really important. And so we have this blue line here of all of the developers. And it just now, just recently, hit new highs. Right. But it's so recent. It's the area under the curve. This is extremely rough science.
00:16:29.186 - 00:17:10.438, Speaker B: It's the area under the curve that is the rate of development. Because so many new web3 developers just came in, they haven't built anything yet. But now that this area under the curve is so large that every single day means so much more in terms of development than it did in July of 2017, for example. I mean, look at how much area under the curve there is in July of 2017 versus how much area there is under the curve in July of 2021. We are making like, as an industry, we are developing like three to four times faster than we were in July of 2017. And that's just what happens when developers come into the ecosystem. And so while there's a lot of developers here right now, they just onboarded them.
00:17:10.438 - 00:17:28.918, Speaker B: A lot of them are just experiencing their first apps, like building their first stuff. And so it's going to take six months for the area under the curve here to actually build out in order into the thing where we actually get a bunch of new, cool new stuff. But the point is we are accelerating development here, which is just super bullish.
00:17:29.094 - 00:17:51.250, Speaker A: Totally. It's all happening faster. It's interesting. Here again, this is chart Ethereum, of course, far in the lead with 4000 monthly active developers. You see kind of bitcoin down at the bottom, and bitcoin just hasn't really grown that much. And that sort of makes sense in developer count. That sort of makes sense for the type of network that bitcoin is.
00:17:51.250 - 00:18:22.522, Speaker A: But some of these other networks are growing just as fast, if not faster, than Ethereum in its early days. And I think some of them benefit from the infrastructure that Ethereum has really built out already. So that's interesting to see as well. Yeah, let's talk about this too, David. So NFT market, it feels like nfts are back. All right, so after a lull maybe for the last couple of months, kind of a minor bear market ish, correction. Signs of life.
00:18:22.522 - 00:18:30.030, Speaker A: Yeah, they're showing some signs of life, and this doesn't necessarily mean they'll return to all time highs or not. But what do you think this means?
00:18:30.180 - 00:19:04.940, Speaker B: Yeah, well, we had openc, just an NFT volume at large just grew so fast, so quickly, it's totally expected to see a retracement. And that's what we saw. We saw about four months of decreasing volumes. But December and also the first week of 2022 saw a resurgence in volume away from the decreasing downtrend that we saw in the last four or five months. So board of ape yacht clubs have really performed well both in terms of floor price and also volume. And also just like celebrity adoption, so many celebrities have board apes now and then there were some other winners as well. Doodles are on the mind.
00:19:04.940 - 00:19:12.800, Speaker B: X copies have gotten a ton of volume. So yeah, there's always a bull market somewhere. It's just a matter of finding out where it is.
00:19:13.330 - 00:19:43.346, Speaker A: This is some NFT stats for 2021 just a year in review, this was put out by Andrew Chang. I believe in the one confirmation team. Andrew Chang that is some interesting stats of note. This is from Metaversal newsletter. Ethereum is still king. So 90% plus of all NFT volume was on Ethereum this year. And that includes also kind of axio infinity, its ecosystem that as a side chain.
00:19:43.346 - 00:20:19.746, Speaker A: There were total market cap of nfts past 31 billion in 2021. 31 billion, which is crazy, but it's percent just adding up all the NFT, I guess. Yeah, some of them maybe on openC. I'm not sure you could dig into the data here, but it's interesting. This is only 1.3% of crypto's total market cap, right? So remember all of the predictions that nfts were eventually going to be larger than crypto? If that's the case, got a long way to go. Yeah, there's a lot of upside here.
00:20:19.746 - 00:20:44.842, Speaker A: If that's the case. Active NFT users on Ethereum hit 2 million. It's pretty crazy. Trading volume on nfts past 20 billion in 2021. Some pretty big stats here. And then it goes through different segments of the NFT market, like crypto, art, gaming, marketplaces, collectibles, and then some highlights and other things. Yeah.
00:20:44.842 - 00:20:50.842, Speaker A: What are your thoughts on the year of 2021 that nfts had? Do you think we're going to repeat something like that this year?
00:20:50.896 - 00:21:37.100, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm reminded of a tweet thread that Cain Warwick put out forever ago about the difference between technologies that fundamentally change the world but then are just not very loud technologies. And I think that's DFI very just paradigm shift in what it means to do finance. NFT is also a paradigm shift. But when it's only a $32 billion market cap versus how much exposure and social and cultural acknowledgment there are around punching above its weight class, it's making bigger cultural impact than DFI is at like one, one thousandths of the market cap. Like absolutely insane. And it kind of just shows how small the NFT industry actually is. 31 $2 billion.
00:21:37.100 - 00:21:43.658, Speaker B: It's more money than I have, certainly, but it's not a lot of money in the grand scheme of things.
00:21:43.824 - 00:21:51.486, Speaker A: Yeah, it's still small. So I guess one takeaway is nfts are early. But what do you think, though? Do you think they're going to have a crazy year in 2022?
00:21:51.668 - 00:22:06.934, Speaker B: Oh, I think they have to, yeah. I mean, crazy is such an open word. Do I think prices are going to go up in 2022 for some I think 2022 will be another crazy year in the world of NFTs, and it's going to be crazy in a way that we can expect right now.
00:22:07.052 - 00:22:22.294, Speaker A: That's it. That's the key. It was crazy in 2021 in a way we couldn't expect, and it's going to be crazy in 2022 in a way we can't expect either. So I expect to be surprised. And that is crypto for you. There's also another almost companion report. It's a separate report, but I call it companion report chain analysis.
00:22:22.294 - 00:23:10.498, Speaker A: Put this NFT report together and it took a different lens on things. It was basically like, who's winning? Who won in 2021? So of that 30 billion or so in value, who made the money? A few takeaways, at least from my mind, were opeNC data actually suggests it's really difficult to achieve outsized returns without being whitelisted on OpenC. So you kind of had to be on openc in order to get these returns. Another takeaway was, if you want to flip nfts, don't buy the cheap stuff, buy the blue chips. This is interesting. The top 500 NFT collections account for 94% of all the flips. The top 100 accounts for 50% of the flips on openc.
00:23:10.498 - 00:23:20.602, Speaker A: So if you're kind of scouring the bottom tier of the market, just buying the cheap stuff, that's actually not the way, according to this report, that you're making real money on nfts. And most people.
00:23:20.656 - 00:24:03.740, Speaker B: This next chart lose. This next chart, I think is really insightful, and everyone should listen up about this. This tweet says you're probably not making money flipping nfts. 20% of user addresses on OpeNc account for 80% of secondary NFT sales, while just 5% of all addresses account for 80% of profits made on secondary sales. And so, yeah, this reminds me of Hazu made this comment, I think, in a podcast a while ago where there was this big, big boom in online poker for a while and everyone and their mother started playing online poker. And then the really good poker players just milked all the noobs for all of their money.
00:24:04.270 - 00:24:05.514, Speaker A: They made a living on it.
00:24:05.552 - 00:24:58.794, Speaker B: They made a living on it. They got extremely wealthy, and then all of the retail poker players put their tail between their legs and went elsewhere and did something else with their lives because they got worked. And then the world of online poker just hit like a quote unquote bear market because there weren't any players left, because all the good ones took all the money from the bad ones. I definitely kind of think that's what's going on with NFT flipping. And that's definitely why the best advice you can ever get about nfts is you only buy something that you like rather than trying to get rich on it. Because if you're trying to flip nfts, you got to know what you're doing. And one of these charts illustrates that in order to optimize for the best flipping potential, it says a couple of tweets down says arguably the most important stat in the entire report for NFT flippers is that the top 5% of NFT flippers on average is paying 2.2
00:24:58.794 - 00:25:09.374, Speaker B: e more for their NFT. So they're not buying floor nfts. They are sifting through, trying to find the rare ones, doing their homework, doing their due diligence, and then flipping that.
00:25:09.412 - 00:25:10.890, Speaker A: And so they're paying premium.
00:25:10.970 - 00:25:20.482, Speaker B: They're paying the premium. They're targeting their selections, they're doing their homework. And if you're just buying a floor hoping to flip it, you might get worked. You might get worked.
00:25:20.536 - 00:25:45.174, Speaker A: You might get worked. I think the takeaway here, and by the way, in my opinion, this goes for all trading, not just NFT. Trading, is 95% of you listening to this should not be trading. Yes, trading and flipping are the same money. Exactly 95% of you probably shouldn't be doing that. And that goes for nfts too. According to the stats, guys, we will be right back with some of the releases and raises and the rest of the roll ups.
00:25:45.174 - 00:25:48.714, Speaker A: But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:25:48.912 - 00:26:24.946, Speaker B: Arbitrum is an Ethereum scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use DFI and NFTs. Over 250 projects have already deployed on Arbitrum, and Arbitrum's DFI and NFT ecosystems are growing rapidly. Arbitrum increases Ethereum speed by orders of magnitude for a fraction of the cost of the average gas fee. When interacting with Arbitrum, you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into Ethereum's level of decentralization and security. If you're a developer who wants low gas fees and instant transactions for your users, visit developer offchainlabs.com to get started. Building your application on Arbitrum if you're a user, keep an eye out for your favorite defi apps or NFT projects.
00:26:24.946 - 00:27:17.190, Speaker B: Building on Arbitrum many of your favorite apps are already live, with many more coming over soon. You can find these apps at Portal Arbitrum one and you can bridge your assets over to arbitrum using bridge arbitrum IO in order to experience defi and NFTs the way it was always meant to be, fast, cheap and friction free. When you shop for plane tickets, you probably use kayak, Expedia or Google to compare ticket prices. So why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto? When you make your trades, you want to make sure you're getting the best possible price on your trade, and that's why you should be using matcha. Matcha has smart order routing that splits your trade across all the various liquidity sources in Ethereum and is also operational on polygon, avalanche, binance, smart chain and other chains. Trading on matcha is super easy because it pools the liquidity for me in a single easy to use platform and allows me to make limit on chain orders. So you can set and forget your defi trades and they will go through automatically while you're away.
00:27:17.190 - 00:28:05.154, Speaker B: So when you're making a trade, head over to matcha XYZ slash bankless and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets. Bankless is proud to be sponsored by Uniswap Uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure. Instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans, Uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on Ethereum that lets you trade any token at the current market price. No human counterparties or centralized intermediaries, just autonomous code on Ethereum. Input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy. The Uniswap grants program is accepting applications for grants. Do you have something of value that you think you want to contribute to the Uniswap ecosystem? No matter how big or small your idea is, you can apply for a unique grant@uniswapgrants.org
00:28:05.154 - 00:28:10.466, Speaker B: and help steer uniswap in the direction that you think it should go. Thank you, Uniswap, for sponsoring bankless.
00:28:10.578 - 00:28:16.826, Speaker A: All right guys, we are back with the releases of the week. The first is this. Maybe some alfie here from Zapper. What are we looking at?
00:28:16.928 - 00:28:36.000, Speaker B: Yeah, Zapper is introducing what looks like notifications for nfts. So if you do decide to flip NFTs, you might want to use Zapper because you can get notified about when your friends buy nft stuff you can actually see. My profile picture will come up there. There I am. My notification is that I bought a punchy penguin there's a bunch of drama with the penguins right now.
00:28:36.850 - 00:28:38.370, Speaker A: Me in this. What did I do?
00:28:38.440 - 00:28:42.606, Speaker B: Yeah, what did you do? No, it's not real. It's just all the crypto twitter.
00:28:42.638 - 00:28:43.602, Speaker A: What are they saying I did?
00:28:43.656 - 00:28:45.026, Speaker B: Yeah. What NFT did you buy?
00:28:45.048 - 00:28:46.194, Speaker A: Oh, I received a Po app.
00:28:46.232 - 00:28:55.282, Speaker B: Oh, you received a bankless dow po app. Lovely. Yeah. So you can just follow, get push notifications for what you and your friends are up to with regards to nfts through Zapper.
00:28:55.426 - 00:28:56.262, Speaker A: What did you do?
00:28:56.316 - 00:28:58.354, Speaker B: Kind of cool. I bought a punchy penguin, allegedly.
00:28:58.402 - 00:29:07.494, Speaker A: Oh, you bought a punchy Bagguan. That's your punch baggon. All right, cool. Yeah, that's great. I love that functionality. It's more functionality from Ave too. Looks like they're building a mobile wallet.
00:29:07.494 - 00:29:12.502, Speaker A: That, coming from Stannie is the tweet. What do you think their mobile wallet might contain, David?
00:29:12.646 - 00:29:31.086, Speaker B: Well, got to contain borrowing and lending. It's also got to be on layer two. So hint more on this later in the show because there's no way that people are going to be like the only people that are willing to pay l one gas prices are also going to be the desktop power users. So any mobile wallet, I think, has got to be an l two wallet.
00:29:31.278 - 00:29:41.990, Speaker A: So argent just deployed on ZK sync, right? Ave, do you think they'll do Zk sync? Do you think they'll do an optimistic roll up? Do you think they'll do starkware, something like this?
00:29:42.060 - 00:29:46.982, Speaker B: Well, I think we have an announcement later in the show, Ryan, to talk about. So we'll really then. Yeah, I don't even remember.
00:29:47.036 - 00:29:59.542, Speaker A: Okay, we'll get to that soon, guys. To be continued in the back half of the show. Let's talk about this too. This is big release Bitco. They're now supporting index co op. Cool assets.
00:29:59.606 - 00:29:59.946, Speaker B: Very cool.
00:29:59.968 - 00:30:25.362, Speaker A: So this is the MVI data, the bed index as well, in bitco. Bitco, of course, is a qualified custodian, so it's kind of like fireblocks. This is where the institutions store their money. So this is a gateway for institutions to buy index co op products. And of course, these are all indices of other assets. Kind of think of them as Defi's answer to etfs. Really cool that Bitco is doing this now.
00:30:25.362 - 00:30:30.866, Speaker A: And that was just announced. You can learn more with the link in the show notes. Any thoughts on that big DFI mullet?
00:30:30.898 - 00:30:38.326, Speaker B: Yeah, centralized custody provider in the front, a bunch of DFI tokens from a DFI dow in the back. Pretty cool.
00:30:38.428 - 00:30:51.338, Speaker A: Big greasy DFI mullet. That's what we got going on. Multidimensional EIP 15 five nine. That's the title of this eth research post. David, I haven't gone through this yet, but you have. What can you tell us about this?
00:30:51.424 - 00:31:30.978, Speaker B: Yeah, this is a research post out of Vitalik Buterin himself, talking about how we can use an EIP 1559 type mechanism to control for other network resources, mainly how we compute gas. So right now there are hard coded values for all the different types of functions that go into gas computation. So are you multiplying a number? Are you dividing a number? What are you doing to a number? And all these have arbitrary values, and that's how we manage the resources of the ecosystem. When we were talking about increasing the gas costs of call data that we're talking about this number, and they change.
00:31:31.004 - 00:31:36.902, Speaker A: In hard forks, right? Basically manually, rough consensus, we should change this thing. And then they get updated and changed.
00:31:36.966 - 00:32:01.970, Speaker B: Developers are like, hey, this resource needs to get up regulated or down regulated, so let's increase or decrease the price, because we think that some resource is, this is a risk, or this resource is underpriced, et cetera. So it's manual changes. Vitalic butyrin is talking about taking every single thing that goes into the calculation for how gas is calculated and giving like a control theory type mechanism to manage it, right?
00:32:02.040 - 00:32:03.538, Speaker A: No way, that is awesome.
00:32:03.624 - 00:32:03.922, Speaker B: Right?
00:32:03.976 - 00:32:05.858, Speaker A: Algo manage rather than people manage.
00:32:05.944 - 00:32:48.850, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. So if resources are underutilized, they will become cheaper. If resources are overutilized, they will become more expensive. And this goes back to one of the first big statements that I heard out of any developer in Ethereum, came out of mean Soleimani's mouth when he talked about, no, magic numbers belong in blockchain design. And what's a magic number? A magic number is a number that's just arbitrarily determined by humans, because human, we're trying to get away from human controlled governance. And so we need to have these control theory, these equilibrium numbers that converge on an equilibrium organically, naturally, in order to have a sustainable long term equilibrium.
00:32:49.350 - 00:33:11.722, Speaker A: Because what you're trying to do is you're trying to remove the dials from human intervention. The start of this podcast, maybe the start of the year, was a magic number that Jerome Powell is talking about. He's got maybe two magic numbers. One is the interest rate, and the other is how much is on the fed balance sheet, how much are they? And they dial those up manually. There's like twelve people in a room who make these big decisions, right?
00:33:11.776 - 00:33:37.022, Speaker B: Totally. And so this is exactly in the crypto economic ethos where we are trying to use crypto economics to manage our public goods resources. And so pretty interesting in depth blog post. There's a lot of Vitalik language in here, but overall the comments from the other developers are like, hey, this is really cool. Big engineering lift. Kind of scary. Kind of scary engineering lift.
00:33:37.022 - 00:33:43.122, Speaker B: And so we will see how well this gets received by the rest of the Ethereum researchers over time.
00:33:43.256 - 00:33:59.890, Speaker A: It could be a long term goal. It's really cool that's being thought of right now. Let's talk about this from a raises perspective. Moving on to raises. Openc is raising $300 million. They've just announced that and that's at a valuation of 13.3 billion.
00:33:59.970 - 00:34:00.322, Speaker B: Wow.
00:34:00.396 - 00:34:11.690, Speaker A: Okay. 13 x unicorn. Now, they just became a unicorn last year and now they're like a unicorn with 13 horns. That's crazy, man. I guess it's not a unicorn then. If it has 13 horns.
00:34:13.410 - 00:34:14.746, Speaker B: That'S a mutant.
00:34:14.938 - 00:34:21.598, Speaker A: Okay, but so what's going on with Openc? Is this just the valuation? What do you think here, dude, you.
00:34:21.604 - 00:34:28.850, Speaker B: Might as well just call right now. You might as well just call openc. Like the NFT store. It's the NFT store of crypto.
00:34:29.590 - 00:34:33.298, Speaker A: It's the Apple store of crypto, I guess.
00:34:33.384 - 00:34:48.998, Speaker B: Right. It's managed to strike a very interesting balance between a centralized web two company and a decentralized web3 protocol that I think positions it pretty well. And they've captured basically all the volume in 2021.
00:34:49.164 - 00:34:52.154, Speaker A: Is it like an NFT bank? Is that what you'd say?
00:34:52.272 - 00:35:05.614, Speaker B: No, I would say consider Coinbase's future NFT platform to be an NFT bank because this is still self custody, right? OpeNC is still self custody, but you still need to ask permission to sell stuff on OpenC. So we're going to get more into this in the show.
00:35:05.652 - 00:35:10.174, Speaker A: But this valuation is based on, though, is like OpenC is literally printing money right now.
00:35:10.212 - 00:35:20.814, Speaker B: Yes. Right. 90 person team. The amount of revenue that they have, they are so incredibly lightweight for just the amount of ether just flowing into their coffers.
00:35:20.942 - 00:35:37.506, Speaker A: Totally. There's some rumors floating around too. I don't know how substantiated is. Neither David nor myself have any insider knowledge about this. But there's some talk that OpenC maybe plans to buy a wallet, like a Dharma labs wallet that could be in the works. I'm not sure. We'll have to see how that develops.
00:35:37.506 - 00:35:51.650, Speaker A: But what do you do with $300 million? You're not going to hire that many people are you. You have to make some acquisitions at least and execute on a growth strategy, I would think. You think we're going to see Super bowl ads for NFTs, David?
00:35:51.750 - 00:35:56.926, Speaker B: Oh, gosh. I mean, I kind of think all ads are going to start to become crypto ads in the future.
00:35:57.108 - 00:36:04.574, Speaker A: Okay, so I saw the new Spider man, right? And there was the first crypto ad played as a trailer.
00:36:04.622 - 00:36:04.834, Speaker B: Wow.
00:36:04.872 - 00:36:06.242, Speaker A: It was a crypto.com ad.
00:36:06.296 - 00:36:12.420, Speaker B: Yes. I saw it on when I was watching Dune. Yeah.
00:36:13.110 - 00:36:22.120, Speaker A: So, yeah, first time, it's starting to invade. It's starting to feel normal. And I think we'll see more of this. I mean, they're going to spend that $300 million on something.
00:36:23.370 - 00:36:27.078, Speaker B: Openc Super bowl ad would be hot, super hobby. Pretty awesome.
00:36:27.164 - 00:36:51.082, Speaker A: It's a lot of fodder there for graphics and such. But speaking of massive raises, of course all of that money is going somewhere. It's going to jobs as well. These crypto companies, crypto protocols, are looking for talented people. You can check out what jobs are available on the bankless job boards in crypto 2022. Could be, should be the year you get a job in crypto. Make the leap.
00:36:51.146 - 00:36:55.514, Speaker B: Make that your new year's resolution. Resolve to get a job in crypto.
00:36:55.642 - 00:37:04.734, Speaker A: Yeah. At least by the end of the year. You got twelve months. Clock is ticking. Here are some jobs. Senior full stack engineer syndicate. A senior software engineer from Gilded.
00:37:04.734 - 00:37:40.202, Speaker A: A founding full stack engineer from Utopia Labs. Senior iOS engineer, smart DFI community ecosystem lead, DyDX, crypto research analyst and NFT specialist from Bitwise, smart contracts research analyst, Bitwise again. And a governance specialist from Bitwise, a blockchain developer. You got to be specialized in rust at solidics, a senior blockchain engineering manager as well. There's a ton more on the bankless job boards. Go check that out. Also subscribe so you get these sent directly to your inbox and make 2022 the year you get a job in crypto.
00:37:40.346 - 00:37:45.070, Speaker B: Absolutely. It's the best. Ready for? Just ready to get a job in? Certainly, yeah. Let's get into news.
00:37:45.140 - 00:38:03.874, Speaker A: Totally. Yeah. It's always exciting news. Let's start here. So the podcast that we did with Vitalik, and we put that out on Monday, that made some news this week in crypto cycles, particularly this headline. Here's an article from Cointelegraph. We are 50% of the way there, says Vitalik on Ethereum development.
00:38:03.874 - 00:38:16.170, Speaker A: He said that in a two hour bankless podcast episode. And that was a fantastic episode, man. This is all about Ethereum's roadmap 50% of the way there. What are your thoughts on this?
00:38:16.240 - 00:38:22.090, Speaker B: Yeah, Vitalik Butyrin once again reclaiming the number one most download episode in 24 hours.
00:38:22.240 - 00:38:22.714, Speaker A: Oh, really?
00:38:22.752 - 00:38:47.742, Speaker B: He's had that title before, but he lost it a number of times to others. Chris Dixon was the previous holder, but now it's Vitalik Buterin once again. Yes. It really did a great job illustrating the rest of the Ethereum roadmap. And we talked about this in the debrief, which was one of the few debriefs that we actually gave out for free subscribers. We do a 30 minutes debrief. For those that don't know, we do a 30 minutes debrief.
00:38:47.742 - 00:39:34.194, Speaker B: Every single podcast goes out to the premium subscribers RSS feed. But because this podcast was so good, and I thought the debrief was particularly helpful, we decided to release it for free. And we were talking about how the clarity behind the Ethereum roadmap is something that we've never had before, that we have now. We can actually clearly see through what we call the crypto fog of war, the unknown r and ds of cryptography and consensus and all that stuff. For the first time, we actually have a very distant vision of the future, which we had something we've not had before in Ethereum. So that's what I've really enjoyed out of this podcast. We also talked about the rise of the alternative layer ones and what Vitalik's take is on that, because he thinks that all crypto systems will ultimately converge upon the same future.
00:39:34.194 - 00:39:50.626, Speaker B: So regardless of what point on the blockchain scalability trilemma that your blockchain has decided to compromise on, it doesn't matter, because we're all headed to the same state anyways. And so we unpack what that means and why that's true. So just really educational episode.
00:39:50.818 - 00:40:07.930, Speaker A: Yeah, I listened to it again this morning, actually. David. Well, actually, my first time this morning, and it just held up. It's exciting. I want to bring it back on the podcast. More questions, sir? Let's talk about this too. Ave, they have just released Ave Arc.
00:40:07.930 - 00:40:21.470, Speaker A: We talked about that before. That's kind of their institutional product. They whitelisted it. It's been whitelisted now with fireblocks, which is kind of like a bitco, a institutional custodian. What's the story behind this product? David?
00:40:21.550 - 00:41:41.626, Speaker B: Yeah, we just now have a kind of a siloed quarantine version of AAve, specifically for KYC institutions. And so I think a lot of listeners and Stani actually addresses this here in the article, people ask like, well, is that just antithetical to what DeFi is? And Stani just goes, well, yeah, it is totally antithetical, but it's what we can do now in order to get retail and institutions closer to the same place. So it's necessary evil, but I have a different take, and I think this is actually the better take. And my take is that in the current financial world, we have all the retails that are retail individuals, the normal people that just have their banking accounts where they're getting 1% APY, and those people are quarantined away from actual finance. But in DFI, it's the inverse, because DFI has no limitations on the basic ethereum address. It's the regulations of the nation state that are forcing or compelling people like Ave and compound to create a siloed version of DeFi. And so where in the traditional finance world, the individual is cut out? In DeFi, it's the institution that's cut out because they have this gated, neutered, siloed version of DeFI when the rest of us get to go and do anything that we want.
00:41:41.626 - 00:42:00.130, Speaker B: And so it's actually completely the inverse. And so this is actually retail taking the big w here, because Ave and compound and fireblocks have to build out all this special stuff in order to allow for big institutions to become compliant. And so, yeah, it's the institutions that are taking the l this time.
00:42:00.280 - 00:42:46.322, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's a great take. And I do think Istani believes that too, right? So he says, at the end, I think DeFi will forever be permissionless and accessible to everyone as long as these networks like Ethereum are decentralized, right? And so what he's basically saying is the AAve arc product was built on top of AAvE. It doesn't take anything away from the permissionless protocol that exists already with AAVE. So DeFi users who aren't institutions continue to use Aave the way they always have. But I think you're totally right in that. In the traditional financial system, there's, like, first class citizens, and second class citizens and retail are definitely second class citizens. The first class citizens are the bankers, the institutions, those in power.
00:42:46.322 - 00:43:25.114, Speaker A: And you're totally right that DeFi completely inverts that, and institutions become the second class citizens. We have better, more permissionless access if we're just using AAve with our metamask wallet and our ethereum address than through this permissioned pool via fireblocks. But all that to say, this liquidity is going to be good for the ecosystem. One of my observations coming to this 2022, David, is I don't think crypto has yet seen what institutional fomo actually looks like. Okay. The first decade of crypto was. I mean, institutions came toward the end of that, but it was primarily retail driven.
00:43:25.114 - 00:43:32.222, Speaker A: Right. The institutions were still stuck on. Yeah. Oh, crypto, that drug dealer money. Yeah. It's like terrorist money. Okay, we're not touching that stuff.
00:43:32.222 - 00:43:55.762, Speaker A: We haven't yet seen institutions fomo into this asset class. And I think over the next decade we will in all areas. I'm talking, like web two, companies coming to web3. I'm talking about institutional banks coming to defi. That is totally going to happen. And we're just starting. Like, we haven't seen the FOMo yet, and I think it's going to be a big space to watch over the next decade.
00:43:55.762 - 00:44:08.138, Speaker A: I'm not sure how much happens this year versus in future years, but it's definitely a massive trend that I see. All right, let's talk about this. Oh, okay. Was this what you're referring to earlier? What's the headline here?
00:44:08.224 - 00:44:49.942, Speaker B: Yeah, so Ave is trying to deploy on Starknet, and so this is a proposal in the AaVE governance forums about deploying Aave on Starknet. So a proposal for progressive bootstrapping of the AaVE ecosystem over Starknet, Starkway's permissionless and decentralized ZK rollup. And so with this would pair nicely with an Aave mobile app, because starknet, it's even cheaper than an optimistic roll up. It's super, super cheap, like less than a penny. And so less than a penny type transactions that are also instantaneous are kind of what it takes to satisfy people that are used to web two. And so without sacrificing decentralization, it's an important point. That makes sense.
00:44:49.942 - 00:44:55.434, Speaker B: I think these things have to come in tandem. If Ave wants a mobile wallet, it's got to be on something like a ZK roll up.
00:44:55.632 - 00:45:17.966, Speaker A: So maybe we're putting some pieces together and we're seeing this take shape. An Ave mobile wallet on Starknet, question mark. Maybe that happens. We'll see what's happening with polygon, though. So some issues, some hiccups along the way with Polygon. There's this game called Sunflower throwing a wrench in Polygon's gears. That is the title here of the article.
00:45:17.966 - 00:45:18.786, Speaker A: What's happening?
00:45:18.888 - 00:45:52.742, Speaker B: I think Polygon is having its cryptokitties moment where it had its first big, successful game. And because of the just transactional capacity of this game. This game just involved a lot of transactions. It really just crippled the polygon network. So polygon gas prices spiked to 410 gWe. That's not guay in ether terms, that's gwe in matic terms, but still pretty high in terms of gas consumption. But this is kind of what happens when you allow a network to have really cheap transactions.
00:45:52.742 - 00:46:17.150, Speaker B: People fill them. And so this has actually already been a problem for Polygon. Previously. They've already started to tackle some of this stuff. They raised the guay limit from zero to 30 previously to start to mitigate some of the spam transactions. And so that eliminated some of the transactions that were just trying to get a penny of mev out. But now, when there's a game, people are playing this game like, oh, they'll pay like, five cents a transaction, ten cents a transaction.
00:46:17.150 - 00:46:39.500, Speaker B: And apparently that was still enough to completely congest the polygon network. And so this is kind of what happens when you have a chain that has really cheap transactions. If you optimize for cheap transactions, guess what? You get a lot of transactions. That's what happens. So this is something that not just polygon, but all chains that have cheap transactions have to deal with.
00:46:40.190 - 00:47:13.138, Speaker A: And I am less worried about it at the layer two than I would be at the layer one. And what's interesting here is the same sort of thing seems to be playing out and has played out multiple times with Solana. So this is just. I don't know if this is the second time this has happened this week, but the Solana network is also experiencing degraded performance due to high transaction throughput. And this is because, as I've understood in the past, there have been a lot of DDoS attacks. Right. A lot of spam type transactions that have brought the Solana network to its knees.
00:47:13.138 - 00:47:27.494, Speaker A: And even more than that actually caused it to go offline for periods of mean. Are these two things related? Is this basically the same effect? You got cheap transactions, you get lots of spams, you get open security vectors for DoS attacks.
00:47:27.622 - 00:47:52.740, Speaker B: Yeah, there's a pretty direct relationship. When you have fast chains, you compromise on stability. And so slow chains are stable chains, fast chains are unstable chains. And so this is why you were talking about the difference between an l one that's fast versus an l two that's fast, because if your l two is unstable, you can go back to the l one. But if your l one is unstable, you don't got anywhere to go.
00:47:53.910 - 00:48:12.550, Speaker A: It's interesting that Paulina wrote an article about this recently about the transaction quality trilemma. What is this trilemma that we're seeing? Because I think we're observing it both in Polygon and also Solana and every other network that has very low gas fees.
00:48:12.630 - 00:48:54.962, Speaker B: Yeah, so crypto loves its trilemmas. So Paulinaya's transaction quality trilemma puts the trilemma between spam, censorship resistance, and low fees. You can only have two, because if you have low fees, but you don't have censorship resistance, well, then people are just going to spam your network in order to get rid of spam. You can censor the spam transactions and keep your low fees. But then you lost censorship resistance, like, now you're a censored chain, et cetera. And so Paul and I unpack some of the tradeoffs here, and some of the tradeoffs aren't so bad. They talk about how immutable X has used censorship to keep spam off of the chain while still keeping low fees.
00:48:54.962 - 00:50:01.850, Speaker B: And so they have a centralized block producer, and they just filter out all the spam transactions in order to keep all of the real transactions good. And I think this is an okay trade off. Right? I know we like censorship resistance, but again, everything about these things are more important on the layer one. And when immutable correctly censors the bad transactions, however, society deems bad to be bad and continues to allow the good transactions. However, society enables, considers good to be good, well, then, that is, in my mind, a successful l two, because the l two is serving the desires and the needs of the people, while also preserving low fees. And fees on immutable X are like, they're free because they are so incredibly low that the block producers, they just eat the costs. And he also talks about how the ability to exit out of a layer two is also really important, because if you think that immutable x is doing a bad job of censoring transactions, and perhaps they're censoring your transactions but letting in other bad transactions, well, then you don't like that, so you leave.
00:50:01.850 - 00:50:16.242, Speaker B: And the ability to exit out of an l two, a permissionless exit out of an l two is a check on the centralization that enables the censoring of spam transactions. Really good article, really good education. We won't unpack it too much more here, but there's a link in the show notes if you want to learn more.
00:50:16.376 - 00:51:10.222, Speaker A: And you know what I think all this means is that it's such a false choice to say that a layer one long term will have cheap transaction fees because it can't not well being a settlement layer. Right. And if it does have very cheap transaction fees, in the short run, those will just get spammed out of existent. What's interesting about spam is that spam actually accrues a cost to the entire network because people have to, nodes in the network have to maintain that state forever after, basically. So there is this cost imposed that's distributed over all of the nodes for this spam too. And that's not good. So layer ones, long term, they have to have expensive, relatively expensive block fees, right? It's like layer twos, they can be much cheaper when it comes to gas fees.
00:51:10.222 - 00:51:22.646, Speaker A: But layer ones, I don't see a way out of long term layer one settlement transaction fees going up. I think that's a reality that too few are accepting right now in this market, 100%.
00:51:22.748 - 00:51:38.166, Speaker B: And also consider this, right, say like Salana avalanche polygon, all of these low transaction fees, high throughput chains, if they continue to allow for spam, well, the spam just increases the fees until they're expensive.
00:51:38.278 - 00:51:38.650, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:51:38.720 - 00:51:46.800, Speaker B: And so it just raises the watermark because the spam is there. And so it ultimately converges upon the same reality at the end of the day.
00:51:47.410 - 00:51:51.520, Speaker A: There you go. Here's the take. Maybe to finish this off from Dan Ellis. Why don't you read it out?
00:51:52.130 - 00:52:16.680, Speaker B: Dan Elliser says, perfect example of why monolithic l ones with low fees are not sustainable long term. If you make global state and computation free, people will do stupid shit until it breaks or the price increases enough to make them stop. There is no TPs high enough for this because again, if you just increase the TPs of your chain, then people are just going to use more of it.
00:52:17.210 - 00:52:29.014, Speaker A: Exactly. Well said, dan. That about sums it up. Let's talk NFT world. So you got a story for us, David? What's a story? This is again related to OpenSea. I feel like this is our OpenseA roll up episode, David.
00:52:29.062 - 00:53:07.158, Speaker B: All right, so this is a story of a guy that unfortunately bought an NFT that was previously stolen. So an NFT was stolen from some other guy's wallet. And then this dealer, the hacker who managed to exploit, I don't know, with a seed phrase attack, put the NFT up for sale on OpenC. And then some individual bought that stolen NFT for 1.5 ether. And then it was reported that that NFT was stolen and then the NFT was frozen by openc inside the new owner's wallet. So the new owner had no idea that it was stolen just bought an NFT, doing normal NFT, buying stuff.
00:53:07.158 - 00:53:17.418, Speaker B: Buys this new NFT, this illicit, previously stolen NFT, and then OpenSea freezes it because apparently it's Opensea's policy to freeze all stolen nfts no matter what.
00:53:17.584 - 00:53:45.186, Speaker A: Okay, let me just pause and recap. Buys, okay, so person steals an NFT, he steals it, then sells it, trying to sell it on OpenSea, some person buys it, right. So this is like the dude selling open his trench coat and selling like fake Rolexes, right? Like stolen Rolexes. Okay. And sells the NFT to this buyer. And now the buyer has it. And then what happens to the buyer? Clarify that for me.
00:53:45.186 - 00:53:53.142, Speaker A: So the buyer's got this new NFT, this Rolex doesn't know it's hot, it's been stolen. It gets frozen, did you say?
00:53:53.196 - 00:54:11.178, Speaker B: Yeah. So Opensea froze the NFT because it was stolen. And apparently that is their policy, that they freeze nfts that are stolen. I think it's a legal restraint that they have. They have to freeze these things if they are stolen just to stay squeaky clean on compliance and legal and.
00:54:11.184 - 00:54:17.262, Speaker A: What do you mean frozen? I thought these things were on Ethereum. Right. They cannot be frozen. Right. If it's an ERC 721.
00:54:17.316 - 00:54:42.946, Speaker B: Right. So they are frozen on OpeNC, not on Ethereum. Because you're totally right, can't freeze anything on ethereum. But OpeNC can choose to not accept any ethereum assets through their know, you can still take your NFT out and sell it on any other platform. But then the argument is like, well, all the liquidity is on. So like, if you don't let me sell on OpenSea, well, I can't access any of the liquidity.
00:54:43.058 - 00:54:55.098, Speaker A: So they basically blacklist it and they just freeze it on the OpenSea platform. And that's kind of enough to make it worthless or close to worthless right now because Opensea is the very least. Okay.
00:54:55.184 - 00:55:29.110, Speaker B: Yeah. And even though they know that the current owner of the NFT didn't do anything bad, they still have to freeze it because it's stolen. And so this kind of just an unfortunate outcome where the guy who had his NFT stolen takes the l. The guy that bought the NFT takes the l. Opensea takes the l because they don't want to do this anyways. And the scammer, the victim, the hacker exploiter, takes the w by getting into 1.5 free ether by selling this.
00:55:29.260 - 00:55:54.810, Speaker A: It seems like a bad incentive set up because rewarding thieves and thieves getting away with it. And basically the third party buyers who purchase these things, they're the ones taking the hit. That seems like a bad precedent to set in general, because what you might do is entice more thieves and more stolen nfts. But what are the lessons learned here? What are the takeaways from your perspective?
00:55:54.970 - 00:56:28.678, Speaker B: Because people think like, oh, web3 nfts, I'll go to OpeNC, this web3 platform, and buy my nfts and then realize that OpeNC is not actually fully web3. It's also not fully web two. It's somewhere in the middle, right? Because it's noncustodial. You own your nfts, you can upload your nfts into OpeNC, but also in order to sell your nfts, it's permission like that. You have to ask OpeNC for permission. I mean, they give you permission by default, but then they could revoke it because they have that power. So, like OpenC kind of Web 2.5.
00:56:28.678 - 00:57:12.486, Speaker B: So OpeNC is going to find themselves, I think, in an interesting spot in 2022. We definitely need alternatives to OpeNC. There's no reason why we can have to have all of the NFT markets, all the NFT volume consolidated onto just one exchange. And OpeNC is going to face a lot of competition. I think, in 2022, we have on the more centralized end of the spectrum, a completely custodial coinbase NFT marketplace coming online. And then there's just the massive fight for a completely decentralized web3 Dow focused NFT platform. And so I think we're going to go the full gamut of the full centralized, full custodial to the fully decentralized, fully noncustodial and then have OpeNC in the middle.
00:57:12.486 - 00:57:19.606, Speaker B: But people, I think, are just learning the limitations of a semi centralized system like Opensea and kind of being bummed about it.
00:57:19.788 - 00:57:42.798, Speaker A: Bring it on. Let a thousand flowers bloom. Right. We're seeing some of the cracks in centralization, and I'm sure either Opensea or some competitor will try to bridge those cracks. What's going on with board apes, though? They just crossed the 1 billion mark in total sales, totally crushing it coming to the year pretty strong. That's one headline here. But there's also been some freezing of board apes as well.
00:57:42.798 - 00:57:46.810, Speaker A: Again, is this a case of stolen board apes similar to the story that you just told?
00:57:46.900 - 00:57:56.760, Speaker B: Stolen board apes? Yeah. So if you've been on crypto Twitter, especially on NFT Twitter, you definitely have noticed the memes about how board ape owners tend to get their board apes stolen from them.
00:57:58.090 - 00:58:15.570, Speaker A: Okay, so how does this happen, by the way? This is not like somebody physically meeting someone in person and wrench attacking them and taking their nfts, right? This is all happening in discord channels and Twitter dms and people social ending up their private tax.
00:58:15.660 - 00:58:27.258, Speaker B: Yeah. People are like, hey, are you having trouble with your wallet? Submit your private key here and I can help you with it. And then they do that and then they get their board ape stolen. Or like, they totally. They get somebody to like, hey, they're.
00:58:27.274 - 00:58:27.994, Speaker A: Just new to crypto.
00:58:28.042 - 00:58:49.894, Speaker B: They're new to crypto. They don't know. Right? They think people are helping them and then they don't like. And then there were these very ironic kind of unfortunate tweets from very early board ape holders saying, like, hey, I just had my board ape removed from my wallet. How do I contact Ethereum customer support to get it back? Stuff like that. They just don't know. They just don't know.
00:58:49.894 - 00:59:02.250, Speaker B: And so it's become a meme that there was a meme that I saw. I was like, name a better duo board ape yacht club holders and giving away their private keys towards. It's happened like, a number of times.
00:59:02.320 - 00:59:02.854, Speaker A: Very sad.
00:59:02.902 - 00:59:03.066, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:59:03.088 - 00:59:04.170, Speaker A: So what happened in this case?
00:59:04.240 - 00:59:35.300, Speaker B: Yeah, so $2.2 million worth of board apes had to get frozen by Openc based off of the same things that we were just talking about. Like scammers managed to get their hands on board apes. Openc is like, okay, well, we're not going to let you sell your stolen apes on our platforms. And, yeah, unfortunately, Opensea doesn't have the power. Unfortunately. And also, fortunately, depending on how you look at it, Opensea doesn't have the power to give those board apes back, but they can at least just restrict the sellers from selling them on their platform.
00:59:36.150 - 00:59:39.230, Speaker A: What's this? This is maybe not a related headline.
00:59:39.310 - 00:59:41.194, Speaker B: Yeah, this is completely unrelated to OpenSea.
00:59:41.262 - 00:59:43.634, Speaker A: Unrelated but related to board apes.
00:59:43.682 - 00:59:48.054, Speaker B: I think this headline is absolutely hilarious. And I read it then, yeah, two.
00:59:48.092 - 00:59:54.810, Speaker A: NFT copycats are fighting over which one is the real fake board ape yacht club. What? The real.
00:59:54.960 - 01:00:15.690, Speaker B: Right? Yeah. So, so there are these funks out there, which are just crypto punks, but mirror images of each other. And now somebody has made the board ape yacht club version of those. So mirror images of board apes, except there's two of them and so both of them are board ape clones. And they're like, no, we're the real clone. Like, we're the real fake board apes.
01:00:15.770 - 01:00:16.734, Speaker A: Which is just, well, don't they?
01:00:16.772 - 01:00:17.562, Speaker B: Hilarious.
01:00:17.706 - 01:00:36.982, Speaker A: Okay, but so don't they? When it's talking? I haven't read anything past the headline, of course. Right. But aren't they fighting for this in the public square? Aren't they fighting for social consensus of what the true fake board ape really is? Or is this getting into legal territory or something like this?
01:00:37.036 - 01:01:09.410, Speaker B: I think this is getting into legal territory, yeah. Because I think board Apes Gob club has copyright rights over their board apes. And so when someone yoinks all of their jpegs and does a mirror image of them and then makes a new NFT set, that is a copyright infringement. And I don't think that really the board apes team can really do anything. There's not much power they have, but the NFT marketplaces have to answer to copyright and so they have to tussle with this, which is even more insane.
01:01:10.790 - 01:01:13.630, Speaker A: Okay, what's going on here then? There's a rarible.
01:01:13.710 - 01:01:22.118, Speaker B: Rarible? Yeah. So, like, this is the fake board apes page on rarible, and it's banned. It says this user or item has been temporarily blocked from public access.
01:01:22.204 - 01:01:28.326, Speaker A: This is rarible doing it, too. Rarible is also a hybrid web two five type company.
01:01:28.428 - 01:01:28.886, Speaker B: Exactly.
01:01:28.988 - 01:01:34.326, Speaker A: Web two and web3. So what's going on here with his Djen Spartan tweet?
01:01:34.358 - 01:02:00.958, Speaker B: Yeah, djen Spartan. If you guys don't know who Djen Spartan is, he's just kind of a djen, a dgen who's also a lone ranger, kind of chad type crypto Twitter character. And he goes, I minted five fake apes. I sold three, booked back my entire capital plus 100% profit. I kept two because I am my ape and my ape is me. He's kind of just making fun of board apes. And I give it an 80% chance that rarible shuts down the fake apes yacht club.
01:02:00.958 - 01:02:12.466, Speaker B: I don't know what ph Ayc stands for. Market pie tomorrow, 95% by the end of the week. And yes, indeed, rarible did indeed shut down the fake board apes NFT craziness.
01:02:12.658 - 01:02:15.938, Speaker A: Eminem sporting a again meme.
01:02:16.034 - 01:02:23.180, Speaker B: Unrelated but related Eminem. Marshall Mathers has got a pretty sick board. Yeah. That's awesome.
01:02:23.870 - 01:02:26.154, Speaker A: That's the slim shady cap right there. That's the hat.
01:02:26.192 - 01:02:26.810, Speaker B: Shady cap.
01:02:26.880 - 01:02:28.474, Speaker A: Is that custom or did the ape come with that?
01:02:28.512 - 01:02:31.350, Speaker B: Nope, that's normal ape.
01:02:31.510 - 01:02:50.690, Speaker A: Wow, that's cool. That's a big move. Good for board apes. Getting celebrities in there. He also on that train again. We don't know whether it's Eminem or whether it's, like, one of the, you know, the people behind Marshall Mathers. But Eminem eth was just purchased.
01:02:50.690 - 01:02:55.442, Speaker A: Are we assuming by Eminem this was purchased or do we know about this?
01:02:55.496 - 01:03:01.046, Speaker B: I don't think we know for sure, but I mean, it's at the same time that he got by his board ape, so it would make sense.
01:03:01.068 - 01:03:36.050, Speaker A: 56K yeah, 15 e for that purchase eth names. I feel like as the original NFTs or one of the original NFTs, celebrities are starting to sport those more and more. Right. And I think it's going to be interesting for a lot of the people who've been sitting on nice eth names when that tidal wave hits. Let's talk about this. Samsung is introducing an NFT platform with its new smart tvs. So what is this? You get to display NFTs on your Samsung TV? Does this only come with some tvs? What are they doing here?
01:03:36.120 - 01:03:59.158, Speaker B: Yeah, so there are certain Samsung products that are designed for art. There's a Samsung frame tv, and that's the tv that I got to display my nfts that I got from Nate Mohler. Shout out. And so yeah, Samsung's leaning into nfts. What it actually means to actually have an NFT platform integrated into a tv, I don't know. But is it kind of like, you.
01:03:59.164 - 01:04:13.866, Speaker A: Know how smart, like, Samsung has smart tv type functionalities? Other tvs have this where they'll embed apps like a Netflix or something inside of it. Are they embedding like an open sea and NFT marketplace, some sort of TBD displayer inside of TBD?
01:04:13.978 - 01:04:22.014, Speaker B: I don't think we know. But we do know that Samsung is leaning into nfts and just crypto at large, so more in the future.
01:04:22.212 - 01:04:38.290, Speaker A: Related Samsung is entering the metaverse, entering its flagship store, eight three seven store in Decentraland. So yeah, big consumer electronics companies coming to the metaverse too. Coming to crypto by way of nfts, not DFI.
01:04:38.790 - 01:04:52.922, Speaker B: Yeah. It says the virtual Samsung eight three seven store will be open and decentralized, indeed decentralized for a limited time. What do you think you can do there? Do you go there to buy a tv? Because how does that work? I don't know.
01:04:52.976 - 01:05:41.530, Speaker A: I don't know. It feels like they're just experimenting with it. But what's interesting to hear is you remember there was a lot of talk about Samsung back a couple of years ago, maybe creating a crypto wallet to roll out on all of the Samsung phones. Not much really happens with that. Right? I didn't hear much about that, but now they're coming back with of, again the conversation we've been having so much recently about nfts creating additional surface area to onboard people into crypto, and that includes companies into crypto as well. It's kind of doing what DeFi could not. Let's talk a little bit about bitcoin though, David, some news from Congress that they are preparing an oversight hearing committee on bitcoin mining's environmental impact.
01:05:41.530 - 01:06:32.970, Speaker A: I feel like, David, bitcoin is taking a full frontal assault from a proof of work perspective. Right. Basically every other layer, one crypto network is migrating or has started with proof of stake, and it's going to be basically bitcoin versus the world in terms of justifying why proof of work mining is actually worth it. And I mean, you and I might agree and might say, yes, it's worth it, right? But bitcoiners don't have to convince us. They have to convince Congress and the rest of society that the money spent on what society sees as environmental waste is well spent funds. And this looks like it's kind of a committee in Congress that will shed some more light on this and probably amplify the topic. What are your thoughts here?
01:06:33.040 - 01:07:05.940, Speaker B: Yeah, this is going to be a big litmus test for so many different things. First off, the bitcoiner narrative is that bitcoin is good for the environment because it creates more energy and specifically leans in towards green energy. So the more energy that proof of work consumes for bitcoin, the faster we can have a green society. A lot of people do not buy that argument. I kind of am compelled by it. But also, at the same time, I think there's a very strong argument to say that, well, it's even more green just to consume less energy than to consume more of it. But that's a different story.
01:07:05.940 - 01:07:39.760, Speaker B: What I'm interested in hearing about the fallout of this is so Congress is supposed to do their research. So when they do do their research and they sift through the fud of know, sometimes just blatantly misinformation about the negative externalities of bitcoin mining, they do exist, but sometimes they're just way overblown. What is Congress's opinion about bitcoin mining after they actually do homework? What is on the other side of that? Do they actually find that bitcoin does incentivize green energy production? To what degree do they find that that's true?
01:07:40.770 - 01:07:50.754, Speaker A: Do you think they're actually going to do their homework though, David? Or do you think they're just what I was going to get another committee for, score some political points, which totally, the entire purpose of this committee is. Right.
01:07:50.952 - 01:08:01.640, Speaker B: It's popular to hate on bitcoin. And so I can totally see an outcome as like, oh, we did our homework. Bitcoin energy mining, bad. It's bad. That's our reports. It's bad.
01:08:02.570 - 01:08:03.846, Speaker A: We should do something about it.
01:08:03.868 - 01:08:10.550, Speaker B: And we should do something about it. Yeah. And then Congress, everyone in Congress, like, oh, yeah, totally. It's bad. We should do something about it. I could totally see that happening.
01:08:10.700 - 01:08:40.318, Speaker A: Well, one thing I'm glad about right now is, and this wasn't the case going into 2021, but it is the case going into 2022, which is, I think, mainstream. And even in Congress, the world of crypto is now larger than bitcoin. There was a time where crypto and bitcoin was kind of synonymous for a lot of people. Like bitcoin kind of eclipsed the rest of crypto. That's no longer the case. I think even going into 2022, we used to say bitcoin is the gateway drug. Teaching people digital scarcity is the gateway drug to crypto.
01:08:40.318 - 01:09:12.414, Speaker A: I don't know if that's true anymore. I think things like nfts are becoming the gateway drug. Right. And again, that's just teaching people digital scarcity as well. Digital scarcity of a JPEG, which is interesting, that leads them down possibly a path to start to understand some of the other crypto money type topics. But that is a sea change, and I'm glad that's the case, or else the rest of crypto would also be lumped into this argument. Not that I'm not sympathetic about the counterarguments that the crypto and the bitcoin community would have to support proof of work.
01:09:12.414 - 01:09:17.566, Speaker A: I am. I just am glad that's a fight that not all of crypto has to.
01:09:17.668 - 01:09:20.926, Speaker B: Yep, yep. Having options is important.
01:09:21.108 - 01:09:57.660, Speaker A: Let's talk about this. You alluded to it earlier in the show, Kazakhstan Internet shutdown. Okay, so there was like, I believe the, I haven't followed this very closely, but the government in Kazakhstan has just basically walked away. There's lots of protests, concerned about the prices, gas prices, the prices of everything. It's kind of a revolt, a minor revolution, I guess I would say. The protests in the street and the government completely walked away. And this has caused downstream effects with, there's apparently a bunch of bitcoin mining in Kazakhstan right now.
01:09:57.660 - 01:10:04.926, Speaker A: They shut down the Internet. So the Internet's been shut down. And now hash rate bitcoin, hash rate has fallen. What's the story here?
01:10:05.028 - 01:10:26.100, Speaker B: 18% bitcoin hash rate fallen. That's a lot. I didn't know Kazakhstan had so much bitcoin mining capacity inside of it. And it kind of just makes sense. Kazakhstan is like right next to China. And so when China pushed out its bitcoin miners, it went all over the world. But a lot of them just went to Kazakhstan, just went right next.
01:10:26.100 - 01:11:14.142, Speaker B: Now, now they're probably going to be moving out of Kazakhstan if this continues. And this actually just might be kind of like another microcosm of China. It's just like, well, we're just pushing out bitcoin mining hash power further and further. Probably west, probably into Europe, probably into America, where bitcoin mining is just more dependable, more stable, and inside of less volatile foundations. And so it might be a long term good just for the narrative of getting more and more hash power domiciled in countries that regulators with power like this is also kind of some sort of speculation going on with this decreasing bitcoin price. Because guess who has a lot of bitcoins? Miners do. They are the kind of the source of bitcoins.
01:11:14.142 - 01:11:44.570, Speaker B: And so if they have elected the big, big drop in May, when ether went from 4300 down to 1800, and I don't know what the bitcoin price does because I didn't pay attention to it as much. That was on the heels of China pushing out bitcoin miners. And so we just saw another big oof candle. Big oof candle. I'm going to just keep on saying that until it becomes in the dictionary or something. Big oof candle. Followed by the news of a bunch of hashing power that got axed.
01:11:44.570 - 01:12:00.420, Speaker B: And so miners, they are very conservative with their risks. Miners are generally pretty risk averse. And so maybe they sold a bunch of bitcoin to fund an actual migration of hash power or just cover their costs or whatever. I think that's a pretty reasonable thing to speculate on.
01:12:01.270 - 01:12:39.050, Speaker A: That could be what's going on for sure. It's definitely interesting news. Also, as we look west, let's talk about some of the regulation coming in the US market. So the CFTC just fined polymarket $1.4 million and asked it to wind down some of its prediction markets. The story is after a CFTC investigation found that polymarket was offering illicit option contracts in the US. It's a very interesting story here because question is, is this the beginning of other CFTC types of enforcement actions in us markets? What happened here? And what's kind of your takeaway.
01:12:39.130 - 01:13:07.506, Speaker B: Yeah, my big takeaway is that this is the perils of a Web 2.5 company, a company that didn't make it all the way towards fully decentralized. This is what they have to deal with. I think Polymarket has definitely been able to have a ton of success based off of the trade offs that they've made on the centralization to decentralization spectrum. But when you have any amount of centralization, you get the ire of nation state regulators. This $1.4 million fine, extremely reasonable.
01:13:07.506 - 01:13:51.110, Speaker B: This whole thing in my mind is reasonable. This is the CFTC doing normal CFTC stuff. This isn't the SEC being just hard handed and kind of just overall a dick to our industry. And I think polymarket more or less perhaps saw this coming. They already had pretty decent limitations on their markets. And now I think what's as a result of this is that they are just going to probably do something like DYDX, which is not allow us IP addresses, not allow us people to participate in polymarket and just kind of move offshore and be serving customers that aren't inside the United States. So, you know who loses? Us people.
01:13:51.110 - 01:14:00.306, Speaker B: In us people. Us users. We don't get to use polymarket because of the CFTC, because of nation state regulators. So is what it is.
01:14:00.348 - 01:14:40.374, Speaker A: Yeah, it's kind of painful. I think it also, I do agree with you this is not necessarily the CFTC being heavy handed in terms of their touch. It doesn't appear like that is the case to me as the SEC has been in the past. But it's also like there's a problem with our regulations in the US from a commodities perspective. And Brian Quintens, who is a former CFTC commissioner, actually came to the podcast and said this. If you ultimately want change, that has to happen in Congress. The legislative body has to change some of the rules about what consumers, retail consumers can have access to in the US.
01:14:40.374 - 01:15:29.814, Speaker A: I mean, at some level the CFTC is unfortunately kind of trying to enforce the rules on the books. But the question is, what happens if the rules on the books don't make sense anymore? What if they're wrong? What if they're old? What if they no longer apply? And I think that's definitely the case for polymarket. These are like prediction markets, right? So what are the chances that democrats lose the next election cycle, that Biden gets reelected? All of these sorts of things, things that consumers should have access to. And it's a shame. What harm can that really mean? Like we're trading nfts in the same mean we're trading all of these different things. It's just that the letter of the law says a certain thing and this causes a stifling of the market in the US. And what's going to happen for polymarket is going to be just fine.
01:15:29.814 - 01:16:02.314, Speaker A: I think they'll continue operating. They might have to geofence, as you said, they'll probably move some of their operations outside of the US and move it internationally. And who loses? To your point, David, the US loses. Right. So it's a shame that this is happening, but if we want change, that's why in the US we have to be involved in our political system as well, or we'll see more of this in the future. David, speaking of things that we're seeing more of, tether just froze $1 million worth of USDT. I think that's just a PSA, like a reminder that Tether can freeze USDT.
01:16:02.362 - 01:16:16.646, Speaker B: That's the full story. We don't know why or who it is, but there's a million dollars in an Ethereum address. I think it's on Ethereum that got frozen. And so that's what happens. Don't do illegal things with Tether. Don't do illegal things. Don't do illegal things.
01:16:16.646 - 01:16:20.600, Speaker B: But if you want to get away with illegal things, don't use.
01:16:22.970 - 01:16:36.842, Speaker A: Then. And then tether is not a censorship resistant stablecoin. Right. That's also the takeaway. Some people treat it as if it is. Neither is China's digital wand. And that wallet goes live on the App Store.
01:16:36.842 - 01:16:49.582, Speaker A: It's going live in App Stores in China in pilot mode now. And what's interesting to me is all of this development has gone on with the digital one, and the US has basically done nothing. They have this entire time.
01:16:49.636 - 01:16:50.606, Speaker B: They have no, yeah.
01:16:50.708 - 01:17:00.754, Speaker A: We've watched it from the last three or four years being like, oh, China's doing this, it's coming. They're investing in blockchain. And the Fed's like, yeah, we'll believe it when we see it. We don't have to do anything.
01:17:00.872 - 01:17:02.418, Speaker B: We'll have a meeting to discuss.
01:17:02.584 - 01:17:13.714, Speaker A: We'll have a meeting to discuss the implications. We'll create a paper and we'll have a congressional hearing maybe in the future. Right? And then China is just like building it and now they're in pilot mode.
01:17:13.762 - 01:17:19.938, Speaker B: It's like the difference between peer review and actually doing it in live production. Totally.
01:17:20.114 - 01:17:56.178, Speaker A: Or like the difference between a startup and a large corporation who just talks about doing things right and the startup's just hustling and building it out, right? And I do think that the US is going to get caught very flat footed on this China digital wallet thing and digital blockchain thing. And another thing that's going to cost the US anyway. That's the take here. We've done a lot on China, by the way. We did that episode with Richard Turin called Cashless. If you want to hear about the China digital currency story, go tune into that episode as well. Guys, we will be back with the takes of the week, but before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.

01:20:13.924 - 01:20:20.910, Speaker A: All right, guys, we're back with the takes of the week. Here's Jay with a really interesting take on protocol mafias. What's the prediction here, david?
01:20:20.990 - 01:21:02.206, Speaker B: Yeah, jay of Rari capital, which we just did a show on state of the nation with Rari capital and Faye tribe. Joey and jay, about the merger between Faye and Rari capital. There's a lot of synergies. These teams have been working together, and so they have decided to merge. So the two tokens, the RGt token for rari and the tribe token for Faye, are merging into the same token, which is going to be tribe. And so Jay continues this thought and extrapolates it to the rest of Dfi and talks about one of his predictions for 2022 is that protocol mafias are coming to life. And he thinks that there are already some different DFI apps that kind of have banded together.
01:21:02.206 - 01:21:35.690, Speaker B: So you have the magic Internet money spell ice is one mafia, one group of people. We also have the frac, stablecoin, olympus, and sushi tribe, excuse me, mafia. And then now we have the tribe, which is also already part of Rari. So three tribes, three mafias, if you will. And I think there's a lot of redundant, overlapping apps in Defi. And so Jay is just predicting that these are going to consolidate and merge into the same organization. We can be more powerful together.
01:21:35.690 - 01:21:55.566, Speaker B: There's a bunch of competition out there. Defi is kind of ruthless these days. And so Jay is just basically just predicting that this ruthlessness naturally collapses into mergers. And we have seen this before. This is what happens in normal businesses. Businesses merge when it makes sense, and daos should be considered the same. And so this is a big prediction that I'm kind of on board with.
01:21:55.566 - 01:22:04.962, Speaker B: If you want to hear more about this, we talked about this concept in our state of the nation. That show came out on Tuesday or Wednesday, depending on YouTube or the podcast. You can check that out as well.
01:22:05.096 - 01:22:17.474, Speaker A: That's a really good prediction. I think he's right on with that. We'll have to see what happens in 2022. It might be the year of mergers. DFI mergers. Here's a take from bellaji. Lawyer fees are the equivalent of gas costs for traditional finance.
01:22:17.474 - 01:22:26.266, Speaker A: Every contract update requires transaction fees from jds. Lawyer fees being like gas costs. What do you think of this?
01:22:26.368 - 01:23:08.794, Speaker B: Yeah, and there was another tweet as well that talked about layer twos, where layer twos are like the paralegals. Layer twos prep everything and then they bundle it all up and they settle that transactions down to the l one, which are the actual lawyers that actually execute the transactions. And this has always been, in my mind, the correct framing for what a blockchain is. A blockchain is just a system of courts, courts and appeals. But instead of subjective judges, we have the EVM. And so if you have a contract that your lawyer drafted up and you want to change it, you got to pay the gas cost to make the contract update. And this is why I know fees on Ethereum are high.
01:23:08.794 - 01:23:55.160, Speaker B: But in stark contrast, the $500 transaction fee on Ethereum is orders of magnitude than the 5000 bajillion dollars that you would have paid a lawyer to do the same. And then if that ended up going to court, you're paying ten times even more than that. Right. And so, yes, gas costs on Ethereum are high, gas costs on other chains are low. But the point is that we are disintermediating an entire industry of extremely expensive lawyers and litigation and court. We have to remember what we are actually improving upon. And it's about the court system, the court of Appeals, which is extremely slow, extremely laborious, and way slower than ethereum, by the way.
01:23:56.890 - 01:24:36.962, Speaker A: I totally vibe with this take. I have maybe like a subtle change. I feel like coders are the actual lawyers in this case, right? So you still have to pay coders to create the contracts, the smart contracts. And the transaction fees are actually like taxes. That whole court apparatus that you're talking about, that is maintained by federal and state taxes, for example, in the US. Right? And that is the court system. And I totally agree with the takes of like, we're automating a ton of that away and it's becoming much more efficient.
01:24:36.962 - 01:25:13.550, Speaker A: In fact, what are the costs to maintain the US legal system from circuit courts all the way to the supreme courts on up. Right? Well, it's like military budget. The entire government infrastructure bureaucracy is required to maintain that system. And we're not only automating the lawyers out of the mix, we're also automating the entire government system out of the mix. And how much more efficient is that? So I'd even take it a step further than bloggy's tweet, but, yeah, he's right on. That's essentially what we're doing. Smart contracts are the new legal system.
01:25:13.550 - 01:25:44.826, Speaker A: Code is law in a way. Let's go to the next take here, David. So this is a take from Suzu. Maybe I'll read this originally, and then you can read the reply, which is the meat of it. So Suzu says, I'm bullish on nearly all quality l ones, but if you think that saluna Avex, that's salana, Luna, and avalanche together, are boomer coins. If you think they're boomer coins, you literally have the memory of the goldfish. And here's this reply, which is the real take here we want to get into.
01:25:44.826 - 01:25:59.918, Speaker A: That's all. The current market is goldfish running from one side of the tank to the other as crypto influencers furiously tapping the tank to attract them to the other side with their bags to dump. Well, that's a bleak outlook on the market as it stands today. You think that's right?
01:26:00.004 - 01:26:27.158, Speaker B: Yeah, I saw this reply get passed around in numerous different circles where everyone's like, oh, yeah, this is a really good analogy. So all the influencers are like, hey, pay attention to my bags. Hey, pay attention to my bags. Tap, tap, tap, pay attention to my bags. And we saw this in Kobe's fantastic substac about how crypto is a fight for attention. If you can't get attention on your bags, your bags will not pump. I'm just going to self shill us here.
01:26:27.158 - 01:26:52.938, Speaker B: This is why some influencers that have not changed their tune for forever are perhaps worth listening to when they are only saying the same things year in, year out, about the same principles. Maybe those guys are people that they're not tapping different spots in the tank. They're saying, hey, this is worth listening to. And it was worth listening to last year, and it'll still be worth listening to next year. So just going to throw that out there?
01:26:53.124 - 01:27:44.490, Speaker A: Look, man, I think fundamentals last fundamentals are stronger than the market's short term attention cycles as like, that's why we talk about them so much on bankless is because if you're narrative investing, you care a lot about what Kobe was saying in his substac, about the tension and whether the attention's on this narrative or whether this narrative. But if you don't care about narratives, if you're not narrative chasing, if you're investing in fundamentals, then all that kind of becomes noise, and you can make longer term plays. And back to what we said at the very beginning, right? It's like 95% of you shouldn't be trading anyway. 95% of you shouldn't be following the influencers like a goldfish because you're going to get wrecked on the other side of that. That's why we emphasize fundamentals.
01:27:44.570 - 01:27:57.510, Speaker B: The game is to find the spot on the goldfish tank that you think all the taps will converge to over the very, very long term and just wait there until all the taps start to show up. And hopefully you place your bets.
01:27:58.010 - 01:28:45.730, Speaker A: Exactly. Exactly. All right, let's go on. This is a related take, actually, from Anthony Cesano. You either die a degen or live long enough to see yourself become a crypto boomer is the take. I think he wrote a blog post about this, and the take in the blog post is basically like, everyone starts as a degen, right? When you get into crypto, you're kind of just here to make money, right? I don't know if that's true for everyone, but generally a lot of people get into crypto for number go up, and then when the number does go up, you kind of lose touch with everything else, and you no longer care about the early d gen style games. But in these DGen games, that's where a lot of the innovation is actually happening.
01:28:45.730 - 01:28:50.898, Speaker A: So you kind of grow out of touch and become like a crypto boomer, according to Anthony.
01:28:51.074 - 01:28:51.606, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:28:51.708 - 01:28:52.966, Speaker A: What's your thought on this take?
01:28:53.068 - 01:29:20.922, Speaker B: Yeah, there's just always generations about crypto, and when people are coming in, they are looking for. They're coming in with their limited amounts of capital wherever they came from, and they are trying to get that ten x. That's what people know the crypto world to offer. Ten x's, 100 x's. And you're not going to find a ten x, 100 x in the high caps. You're not going to get your 100 x with bitcoin or ethereum anytime soon. It's going to take a real long time to get 100 x on ether.
01:29:20.922 - 01:30:10.026, Speaker B: It'll happen, but it'll happen over decades. And so if you want that 100 X, you got to go down the dGen rabbit hole and start doing your investigations, doing a super insane amount of research, like following all the discourse, doing all that stuff. And you are living on the periphery, you are living on the edges. And once you actually survive that part of your crypto cycle, then you kind of graduate into something a little bit more stable. You kind of have developed what you are familiar with. You've gotten your feet under you, and then the crypto world moves on and starts to innovate in different directions than what you're used to. And either you can choose to follow that innovation, which is what Sazzle is saying, you either die a dgen, as in you stay a dgen forever, and you're just following the narrative trades over and over and over again, or you just kind of call it quits and settle.
01:30:10.026 - 01:30:20.770, Speaker B: It's, you know, I'm actually familiar with this part of crypto, and I'm going to stay right here. And so that's what Anthony's calling a crypto boomer. And so this juxtaposition, I think, is pretty compelling.
01:30:21.110 - 01:31:08.606, Speaker A: Yeah. Do you think that's totally right. Like, do you think you either have to be a degen or you become a crypto boomer? And those are the only two choices. I feel like there's another choice here, which is like, I don't know, it's kind of the buy what you use sort of Warren Buffett, like, evaluate this based on its fundamentals, wait for narratives to prove themselves with some raw fundamentals and then invest in them, but be open to new narratives. I feel like a total crypto boomer would just be like, yep, I bought my thing and this is how it is, and I'm never going to change my thesis or my opinion. It's always this one particular. But, like, I think there's some space in between being a full degen and being a crypto boomer.
01:31:08.606 - 01:31:09.522, Speaker A: What are your thoughts on that?
01:31:09.576 - 01:31:27.414, Speaker B: I think it's funny that you referenced Warren Buffett in your explanation as what's not a crypto boomer. It's like, oh, yeah, Warren Buffett long term behavior. No, like, it's the juxtaposition between the dgens and the non dgens. Like, if you're not a dgen, you're therefore a crypto. Although I do accept your.
01:31:27.612 - 01:31:32.390, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I do think there's some nuance there, but I totally understand the point he's making.
01:31:32.460 - 01:31:56.474, Speaker B: So here's a take out of Reddit, and this take is really just the headline. And this is coming off the heels of all of the gamers rejecting nfts in their games. And the take here is that NFTs won't ruin computer games. Greedy game companies will ruin computer games using nfts. I think that's a really good take. Technology is just neutral. It's really about the incentives of the game developers that can choose to actually have helpful or harmful nfts in the games.
01:31:56.474 - 01:32:05.678, Speaker B: And so that's kind of what I would ask the gamers that don't like nfts to consider, is that, well, maybe it's actually the studio that you don't like, not nfts.
01:32:05.854 - 01:32:11.206, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's totally the case. Nfts are neutral technology. Why don't you take this take?
01:32:11.308 - 01:32:42.990, Speaker B: Yeah. This cut from altcoin psycho Twitter account. He says so many poorly designed unlocks are all happening this year. In 2022, a lot of popular alts will likely get hammered. Unlocks is referring to angel investors, seed investors getting their tokens and then their vesting periods ending so that they can finally sell their tokens. He continues, 2022 will be the year that humbles everyone who said fully diluted value or tokenomics are a meme ta. Technical analysis won't save you from a shitty emission curve crushing your project.
01:32:42.990 - 01:32:57.258, Speaker B: So basically he's saying that, like, yo, beware of the tokenomics or, excuse me, beware of the vesting schedules. Because when vcs have their tokens unlocked, they need to cash in and lock in some profits. And they got in on those tokens cheaper than you did, so you got to beware.
01:32:57.374 - 01:32:59.254, Speaker A: All right, David, so what are you excited about this week?
01:32:59.292 - 01:33:27.214, Speaker B: Then tomorrow we record with Kobe with crypto Cobain, and so I think that's going to be pretty interesting. There's been some Twitter spats friendly ish Twitter spats between us and Kobe beforehand before this, but he was amical enough to come on the show, and so we were recording with him tomorrow, and that episode comes out on Monday. I've already shared the agenda with him, and he was like, oh, it's pretty good. And there are some hot questions in there. So it's going to be a fun show.
01:33:27.412 - 01:33:45.602, Speaker A: I actually think there's a lot of shared values between bankless and Kobe, but Kobe definitely takes more of the. I'm a narrative investor. I'm a trader side of the spectrum where we take the more fundamentals, long term approach. So I don't think we disagree on as think our dispositions are definitely different.
01:33:45.656 - 01:33:51.602, Speaker B: Yeah, our styles are very different, and maybe that's where and why we butt heads. But overall, I'm looking forward to the conversation.
01:33:51.746 - 01:33:54.870, Speaker A: Yeah, I do have a lot of respect for him, too, so that'll be fun.
01:33:55.020 - 01:33:56.600, Speaker B: Ryan, what are you excited about?
01:33:56.970 - 01:34:01.962, Speaker A: Dude, I'm just excited to have my electricity back and my Internet back. It was a mess.
01:34:02.096 - 01:34:04.778, Speaker B: You mean a few hours, be back online?
01:34:04.944 - 01:34:37.910, Speaker A: Yeah, totally. Yes, that's what I mean. But also, just, like, I realize this is a first world problem, right? Being without the Internet for 48 hours. Okay, well, you'll survive, Ryan. And that's totally true. But it also always makes me think, man, what would it be like if society totally broke down and we lost electricity, lost Internet? How long could I last in that sort of a situation? The truth is not very damn long. And I thought about other things, too, from a crypto perspective.
01:34:37.910 - 01:35:00.970, Speaker A: Crypto really doesn't work when the electricity is off, of course. But the interesting thing about that is neither do gold etfs, right? Neither does your bank account. Nothing works. I know that's been an early critique over things like crypto is like, well, what happens if the Internet powers down or electricity turns off? You don't have crypto. Well, the truth is, you really don't have anything when those two things happen.
01:35:01.040 - 01:35:12.574, Speaker B: And, in fact, if the Internet turns off, parts of the Internet can turn off and completely cripple the banking system. And if only parts of the Internet turns off, bitcoin and ethereum still are online.
01:35:12.772 - 01:35:37.586, Speaker A: Exactly. Next time there's some Internet connectivity established, you can kind of do. So I sort of asked myself, like, what would I do if this was sort of a persistent scenario? If this was a real disaster and this spanned, like, weeks or months or something like this, what would I want to hold? And it's not going to be gold etfs, right? Because what use are those? It's like family, it's friends and it's food. That's what you're doing in a real crisis.
01:35:37.618 - 01:35:38.730, Speaker B: In a nice house. Yeah.
01:35:38.800 - 01:36:00.734, Speaker A: Shelter. Right? In a nice house, ideally. So I guess it just impressed upon me that society is built on. Crypto is built on many different technologies, but all of society is also built on top of these technologies. And I think crypto is much more resilient than it first appears. It's at least resilient as just about everything else in society, right.
01:36:00.852 - 01:36:07.778, Speaker B: Well, it's supposed to be the most resilient thing on the Internet after SMTIP or whatever.
01:36:07.944 - 01:36:20.600, Speaker A: Yeah. After the TCP IP core, Internet protocols, there's crypto, and that will persist. So, anyway, I'm fine. Internet's back up I'm connected. Electricity is here.
01:36:21.130 - 01:36:22.470, Speaker B: AI back online.
01:36:22.620 - 01:36:29.574, Speaker A: Yeah, AI back online. But it's good to go through that experience, I think, once in a while, right? It makes you think about things like this.
01:36:29.772 - 01:36:30.422, Speaker B: Absolutely.
01:36:30.556 - 01:36:31.686, Speaker A: You ready for meme of the week, man?
01:36:31.708 - 01:36:37.146, Speaker B: Meme of the week? Yeah, absolutely. This is my meme this week, which I'm very, very stoked that I had.
01:36:37.168 - 01:36:46.126, Speaker A: A special meme first, though. This is a meme that we talked about in the last show, and this was a Jack Dorsey anti web3 meme. Maybe we should talk about that one first. Yeah.
01:36:46.148 - 01:36:57.822, Speaker B: So I wrote in market Monday this week what Jack doesn't get about web3, which I tried to summarize all the arguments that I could about why Jack is just basically, completely backwards about web3 incentives. Jack?
01:36:57.886 - 01:37:03.170, Speaker A: Jack Dorsey, the co founder of Twitter and also CEO of Square.
01:37:03.240 - 01:37:34.202, Speaker B: Yeah. Jack thinks that Web three is just this Silicon Valley VC marketing term because it's really, really hot and they can make a lot of money off of it. And so all these web3 companies are just pouring capital into Silicon Valley vcs because all these vcs are giving them all their money, leaving very, very little for retail. So Web three is a VC led endeavor is what Jack's critique of. And in my opinion, it's the exact opposite. And I know it's not perfect, but like a, let's think about web two. And here's where the meme comes in.
01:37:34.202 - 01:38:22.854, Speaker B: So it's the same meme that I need to explain, the first meme for the listeners. So the meme is that there's this water pipe, and it's coming out of ethereum, and the water pipe is labeled web3. And this water pipe is just flowing water into the mouths of very fat and happy Silicon Valley VCs, while this extremely famished retail individual is just opening his mouth for these mere droplets that are just accidentally leaking out of the pipe. And so that's Jack's claim on web3 is retail is just left in the sidelines. And so again, I think this is completely backwards from reality. So I made this alternative version of the meme where instead of small little droplets being dropped off and going into the mouths of retail, it's actually just hearts and likes coming out of the web two pipe. And so the web two pipe is flowing money into Silicon Valley VCs.
01:38:22.854 - 01:38:33.710, Speaker B: As Jack says, it was for web3. But instead of retail getting droplets in web two world, you just get hearts and likes. Like, here's what you get out of web two. You get a like, I get to like your thing.
01:38:33.780 - 01:38:35.822, Speaker A: Dopamine hits. Dopamine hits. Yeah.
01:38:35.876 - 01:39:08.422, Speaker B: So no money. And Jack completely ignores, and I write about this in the article, Jack completely ignores how airdrops are a fundamental component of web3. And people have gotten over a million dollars worth of airdrops from web3 endeavors. And how. Also, I make the claim that Jack says that web3 will never be able to escape vc incentives. I make the claim that web3 platforms that put more and more capital into the hands of retail do better think about Ens and how beloved Ens is. Zero vcs, all retail.
01:39:08.422 - 01:39:14.650, Speaker B: And so I think that Jack just has this completely backwards. And so this is the new meme that I think is far more accurate of reality.
01:39:14.810 - 01:39:40.962, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a good take. Look, so Silicon Valley VCs got very fat and happy off of web two. But I think the true genius of this meme is like, what did retail get out of the whole web two movement, right? Like likes and hearts and their attention kind of stolen, right? And like dopamine addictions, that's kind of where we are in the cycle. Certainly didn't get any equity, didn't get any token drops. So that's the meme of the week.
01:39:41.016 - 01:39:42.502, Speaker B: That is the meme of the week.
01:39:42.636 - 01:39:52.706, Speaker A: All right, guys, this has been the first roll up of 2022. Welcome to 2022. We're glad that you're with us, as always. None of this has been financial advice. Eth is risky. DFI is risky. So is bitcoin.
