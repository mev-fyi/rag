00:00:09.500 - 00:00:35.784, Speaker A: Hey, bankless nation. Welcome to another episode of State of the Nation, where we do a deep dive on a specific topic relevant in crypto. Hey, guys, are you ready for the web3 phone wars? Because I think that is just kicking off, David. That is our subject today. Last roll up, we had a take on the Salana phone. I feel like, Dave, we didn't exactly nail that take. All right? We didn't get a complete take there.
00:00:35.784 - 00:00:50.636, Speaker A: And we want to rectify that today. We want to do a deep dive with a more nuanced take on what Solana is launching. So we have Anatoli and Raj, the co founders of Solana, to tell us more about the Solana phone. David, what are we going to cover today?
00:00:50.738 - 00:01:28.584, Speaker B: Yeah, so there's, interestingly, in the last two weeks, three phone announcements all happened. Solana is definitely the biggest phone announcement with the most amount of just effort and energy put behind it. So, of course, we got to bring the Salana team on to talk about it. But overall, the thing that we were missing when we were talking about it on the weekly roll up, Ryan, is obviously, we use crypto on our computers. Your phone is also a computer. But what does a phone first ecosystem really unlock? The web3 crypto world? What does that really bring? And that is the question that I don't think we knew what the answer was on the weekly roll up. And that's the question I think we are trying to answer here.
00:01:28.584 - 00:01:43.596, Speaker B: What does a mobile first, mobile specific web3 ecosystem really bring to the table, not just for Salana, but for the entire crypto industry? And why is everyone seemingly having their mobile play at this present moment? So, things to unpack here, and I.
00:01:43.618 - 00:02:12.900, Speaker A: Still have some questions, David, and I still have a little bit of skepticism. But I'm hopeful by the end of this episode, we might be able to update our take on what the Solana phone actually is, where it adds value to the ecosystem and what it is about. So that is the subject today. Also, David. Got to tell them about our friends and sponsors over at Juno. So, David, Juno has this fantastic crypto native bank, is what I would call it. What's special about a Juno account?
00:02:13.050 - 00:02:29.916, Speaker B: So it has all of the powers of crypto built right into it. So you get your normal features that you'd expect, like yield on your USDC or your bitcoin or your ether. But I'm pretty sure this is the only checking account in the world that goes straight from your checking account straight into crypto, but not just got to.
00:02:29.938 - 00:02:30.764, Speaker A: Be the only one, right?
00:02:30.802 - 00:03:02.244, Speaker B: On L2s, you go from your bank account to optimism, arbitrum, polygon, and then they also have ZK sync and Starquare coming soon as well. It's the only bank account in the world that does that. You get your direct deposit into this account, and then you get zero fees to swap that direct deposit fiat into the crypto assets that you know and love. And you can also automate that too. So checking count to L2s, that's crazy yield on your crypto assets. We like that. But then also getting your direct deposit in crypto Juno, it's the crypto first bank account for the digital age.
00:03:02.362 - 00:03:08.228, Speaker A: They got a deal going on too, right? So look at the top. It says, welcome, bankless listeners. There's a little deal. Tell us about that, David.
00:03:08.324 - 00:03:19.548, Speaker B: Yeah, so if you deposit money from your direct deposit, you get $100 from Juno, and if you deposit crypto on the crypto side of things, you get $10. They are paying you to be a customer.
00:03:19.714 - 00:03:38.272, Speaker A: Yeah. As long as you got to have a bank account, you have real life fiat bills. You need one of these. It is a step to go bankless, and it's an upgrade from your Wells Fargo account, I can tell you that much. David. Got to ask you the question we start every single state of the nation with, which is, what is the state of the nation today, sir?
00:03:38.326 - 00:03:43.692, Speaker B: You know that Batman movie with Bane, where there's that meme where he goes, we're going mobile.
00:03:43.836 - 00:03:45.184, Speaker A: That is the the of state nation.
00:03:45.232 - 00:03:46.292, Speaker B: Ryan, we are going.
00:03:46.426 - 00:03:51.348, Speaker A: Oh, my God, that's a deep cut right there. I barely remember that clip. Okay.
00:03:51.434 - 00:04:13.724, Speaker B: Yeah. Anyways, everyone's going mobile. Solana is looking like it's leading the charge into the mobile first ecosystem. So we're going to explore what does it mean to go mobile as a crypto industry? Because it's not just putting your crypto apps on your phone. It's much more than that. And I think Anatolian and Roger have some of the answers there as to what web3 mobile really looks like.
00:04:13.842 - 00:04:28.640, Speaker A: Look, this is a big project to sink your teeth into during the build market, which is what we're in. So we'll get the full scoop in just a minute. We will be right back with Anatolian Raj from Salana. But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:04:28.790 - 00:05:01.804, Speaker B: Rocket pool is your decentralized Ethereum staking protocol. You can stake your Eth in rocket pool and get our Eth in return, allowing you to stake your Eth and use it in DFI. At the same time, you can get 4% on your eth by staking it with rocket pool, but you can get even more by running a node. Rocket pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating Ethereum nodes. Setting up your rocket pool node is easier than running a node solo, and you only need 16 eth to get started. You get an extra 15% staking commission on the pooled eth that uses your node to stake. You also get RPL token rewards on top.
00:05:01.804 - 00:05:37.592, Speaker B: So if you're bullish e staking, you can boost your yield by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pool network, which currently has over 1000 independent node operators. It's yield farming, but with Ethereum nodes you can get started@rocketpool.net and you can also join the rocket pool community in their discord. You can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat, so I'll see you there. Arbitrum is an Ethereum L2 scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use DFI and NFTs. Some of the coolest new NFT collections have chosen arbitrum as their home, while DFI protocols continue to see increased liquidity and usage. You can now bridge straight into arbitrum from more than ten different exchanges, including finance, FTX, Huobi, and crypto.com.
00:05:37.592 - 00:06:27.044, Speaker B: Once on Arbitrum, you'll enjoy fast transactions with cheap fees, allowing you to explore new frontiers of the crypto universe. New to Arbitrum for a limited time, you can get arbitram NFTs, designed by the famous artists Ratwell and Sugoy for joining the Arbitrum Odyssey. The Odyssey is an eight week long event where you complete onchain activities and receive a free NFT as a reward. Find out more by visiting the discord at Discord GG Arbitrum. You can also bridge your assets to arbitrum at Bridge Arbitrum IO and access all of Arbitrum's apps at Portal Arbitrum one in order to experience DeFi and NFTs the way it was always meant to be, fast, cheap, secure, and fiction free. Makerdao is the OG Defi protocol, the first defi protocol to ever exist, even before we called it Defi, Makerdao produces Dai, the industry's most battle tested and resilient stablecoin using Maker. You don't need to sell your collateral if you need liquidity.
00:06:27.044 - 00:07:00.960, Speaker B: Instead, you can spin up a maker vault and use your collateral to mint Dai directly with Maker the power to mint new money is in your hands. And there's something new in the Makerdao ecosystem. Every time a new Makerdao is opened, the owner can claim a poap, which contributes funds to one tree planted, an organization with ongoing global reforestation efforts, creating a world where digital participation and the health of our environment can live side by side. Soon, Maker will be present on all chains and L2s, bringing the biggest and best DFI credit facility to everywhere there is DFI. So follow Maker on Twitter at makerdao and learn from the oldest and most resilient Dow in existence.
00:07:01.700 - 00:07:27.880, Speaker A: Hey, guys. Welcome back. We are here with the co founders of Solana. We've got Anatoli, who's the co founder of Solana and also the co founder of Solana Labs. So the protocol and the labs company. We also have Raj, who's the co founder of Solana, the COo of Solana Labs, and a board member of the Solana foundation. We're going to talk a little bit about all of those organizations so you get some context, but the main Topic of discussion is the Solana mobile phone.
00:07:27.880 - 00:07:30.396, Speaker A: Raj, Anatoli, how are you guys doing?
00:07:30.578 - 00:07:31.308, Speaker C: Great.
00:07:31.474 - 00:07:33.230, Speaker D: Yeah, great. How are you guys?
00:07:33.760 - 00:08:01.270, Speaker A: We're doing know this is a time for reflection. It's a time where we get to concentrate and there's not as much noise in the space. But let's start there before we get into the phone conversation. How are you guys doing in the bear market? What has changed? What has stayed the same? What are the vibes like over in the salana ecosystem and what you guys are building right now? Anatoly, why don't you start?
00:08:01.640 - 00:08:28.236, Speaker C: Well, I think the bull market was the exception for us. We started in the 2018 bear market, so we were kind of used to the slog of it. This feels normal to me, actually. We got to work. We got to hustle and make connections, talk to a lot of people, build, so it kind of feels more natural. So I feel like you guys calling it the build market. That's a good analogy.
00:08:28.236 - 00:08:29.744, Speaker C: Good way to put it.
00:08:29.942 - 00:08:32.012, Speaker A: Raj, you feel the same? How are you feeling?
00:08:32.076 - 00:09:29.250, Speaker D: Yeah, totally. I mean, I think if I got better at monitoring the velocity of email and telegram, I might be able to find and calculate some kind of leading indicator of a market collapse. But it's just amazing. I mean, I think the noise really cuts down by a factor of ten, and it becomes so much more clear what the important and durable problems are to solve that are going to push the space forward for another ten years. Yeah, I think during the big run up, it felt like it grew to sort of a fever pitch, and you see these wild dreams about what might be possible and what people want to build. And I think when clearer minds prevail and the markets cool down, it just becomes a lot clearer what's actually worth building.
00:09:29.780 - 00:09:54.410, Speaker B: Yeah, I absolutely resonate with that. I don't know how many cycles you guys have been into. Maybe answer that question next. But this was my second go around, and at the peak of this bull market, I knew things were crazy, I knew things were weird, but sometimes they were like, damn it, I fell for it again. It still got me. How many cycles have you guys gone through?
00:09:54.860 - 00:09:59.708, Speaker C: This would have been the second bull run that I was hyper aware of what was happening.
00:09:59.874 - 00:10:00.910, Speaker D: Yeah, same.
00:10:01.360 - 00:10:19.920, Speaker B: So during this bear market, now that we have our sober caps on, just explain to me what's just the vision for what Solana wants to get done in the bear market. Obviously, this mobile thing, which is going to be the focus of this conversation, but just like generally in the whole Solana ecosystem, what are you guys focused on during the bear?
00:10:20.340 - 00:11:06.332, Speaker C: It's still the same thing. So I think how to get crypto adoption, how to get crypto to a billion people, those are like the big dreams. And it's really hard for us to know which apps or what use cases are going to drive it. So the only way we can do that is to get devs to build them. Get 1000 people throwing darts against the board, and one of them is going to hit a bullseye. So we're really focused on developer tooling, developer adoption, like, everything, and that ultimately boils down to even low level network performance, because the faster the network is, the cheaper it is, the more devs use cases they can launch and build and hopefully get the next bull market started. You think back to, like, defi summer.
00:11:06.332 - 00:11:21.990, Speaker C: That was four companies really, right? That was it. So out of the thousand devs that took a thousand shots on gold, four of them did it right, and that kicked everything off. So we need the next four or five whatever entrepreneurs to figure that out.
00:11:23.660 - 00:11:46.216, Speaker A: Does anything change when token price is down big? Right? So eth price is down 80%, bitcoin is way down, Salana is down like 87%. Are there things you can't do when token price is down, or is price kind of just background noise? It doesn't really matter. It doesn't affect your roadmap plans.
00:11:46.408 - 00:12:18.650, Speaker C: We never grew to a large company, so labs is 75 people, so it's not like we got to cut personnel and stuff. Like that. That's been like, I think we only hired people when there was a fire or I was so overloaded or that we could hand off a task that I'm like, okay, you go do this, and then I go do the next thing. And that has kept us, I think, at a size that price isn't as important as, do, I think maybe other companies.
00:12:19.500 - 00:12:45.330, Speaker D: Yeah. I think either you over levered and you're an investor, you're a hedge fund, or you were providing an unsustainable product that really needed growth, needed a market run up to keep going, and you blow up. Or the lighter version is you just scaled up a little bit too much. You have to do layoffs. But both of those are pretty painful. And luckily, we haven't had to do either.
00:12:46.180 - 00:13:37.984, Speaker A: One comment while you're talking, Anatoly, about kind of defi Summer, it was just four companies. One thing I've been thinking of is actually how resilient DeFI has been over the past couple of months, particularly when you contrast it to CFI, and how actually, if you think about this from a fundamentals is what's just happened in crypto, how all of the CFI, all the trusted proxies, kind of broke down, yet DFI survived is more fundamentally bullish for DFI than DFI summer 2020. In my mind, that is true. And so if you're a fundamentals investor, if you're a builder and you just watched all of the collapse of CFI around you, and DFI is still standing, fundamentally, that is incredibly bullish, even though price doesn't reflect it. Right. So just an observation I have.
00:13:38.022 - 00:14:27.200, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't know if 100% agree with you. When Maker survived a 2020 crash, when everything dropped in one day by like 50% and Maker survived it, I was like, okay. Despite people shitting on it and complaining about it was a stressful time for them, but the fact that it basically survived, I was like, okay, this is a thing that can handle a double black swan that was built on this kind of toy. It was like a toy computer right prior to that, but all of a sudden, it's one that can handle this crazy financial collapse. And I thought that really, to me, showed the resilience of DeFi, and that was before, I think, DeFI really broke out into the mainstream.
00:14:28.660 - 00:15:02.120, Speaker B: Okay, so I want to turn this conversation to the phone conversation. And so I want to read a quote that thankfully somebody put from our own weekly roll up into the YouTube chat here. So I said, we said on the roll up, bankless says that a blockchain having its own phone feels like a big distraction and, quote, feels weird questioning why Solana entered the hardware game when blockchains are software. So I'll open up the question to you guys. Why does web3, or even a specific blockchain ecosystem need a phone? What does that do for that ecosystem?
00:15:02.280 - 00:15:32.440, Speaker C: So labs is a company. It's not the protocol, right? The protocol is a bunch of math, a bunch of code. It's run by a bunch of validators and labs. The company builds products. One of those products is a phone and it's a web3 phone. It is primarily like, we're focused on the Salana part, but the stack, the sms stack, it's open source. So if there's devs, I want to add ethereum support, bitcoin support, send prs, we'll integrate them, we'll get them audited, and we'll make it happen.
00:15:32.440 - 00:16:18.036, Speaker C: And the goal for this product is to build an awesome experience, a delightful experience for signing, for self custody, for those integrations between applications like native applications and digital items, nfts and all the stuff you want to do with web3, just make it really as amazing as using Apple Pay. Every time I use Apple Pay, I'm like, I don't want to enter another credit card ever again. Right? This doesn't suck. I want the same experience for crypto. We don't have that. You kind of need a couple pieces for that to work. The main piece is taking the seed phrase and sticking it inside the secure element on the phone.
00:16:18.036 - 00:16:41.480, Speaker C: It's not a new piece of hardware. I was at Qualcomm like seven years ago. There were secure elements on every device that ever shipped. There's a trust zone on every device that ever shipped. Just adding those APIs so you can do bip 39 key recovery. It's pretty simple, like having the trust zone be able to sign and give the user a trusted display. So the wallet can't lie to you what you're signing.
00:16:41.480 - 00:17:09.136, Speaker C: The wallet never sees your seed phrase. That means that Phantom now can ship an application. The user doesn't have to trust Phantom to not screw up their seed phrase. And that thing can be brought up and tapped to pay when you go pay for your coffee or when magic Eden wants you to pay for an NFT or something like that. So that piece of hardware allows devs to innovate. And that innovation is what I hope will bring product market fit. Get to those billion users.
00:17:09.136 - 00:17:29.710, Speaker C: You need devs to throw darts at the ball, at the target right now, they've all been doing this on desktop. Mobile is such a prevalent thing, especially outside of the US. In Europe, most people just have a phone as their primary computer. Actually, most of them an Android phone.
00:17:30.800 - 00:17:41.280, Speaker B: Okay, so you said that all of the devices that shipped out of Qualcomm, and I'm assuming every single mobile device out there has that secure element, like 99% at least the hardware is there.
00:17:41.350 - 00:17:42.480, Speaker C: The software is not.
00:17:42.550 - 00:18:08.040, Speaker B: Right? Okay, so I think that leads us into there's two parts of this conversation. There's the hardware of the Salana phone, the saga phone, and then there's the software, the SMS stack. Would you say one of these things is more important than the other? And if you're telling me that every bit of hardware has more or less the same parts, the same components, I'm guessing it's the SMS, the Solana mobile stack part of it.
00:18:08.190 - 00:18:09.124, Speaker C: Over the long term.
00:18:09.172 - 00:18:09.940, Speaker B: Over the long term?
00:18:10.020 - 00:18:42.580, Speaker C: Long term. Over the long term. I hope that what we're doing just gets co opted by Google and Apple and they're like, yeah, this should exist. And they just ship it. And then all of a sudden we crack them open and web3 mobile native is there and everyone's happy. I think what you imagine post crypto adoption, you imagine your phone doing native signing, right? Native applications, like all that stuff being integrated, being shipped by every major manufacturer. That's going to happen, but somebody has to do it first.
00:18:42.580 - 00:19:21.010, Speaker C: And the device, this flagship device, it's built by an amazing team. If it wasn't for Jason, this would have never happened. He's the founder of awesome. He was the lead architect of iPad pro. He built like James Cameron submarine door, did like crazy projects for Johnny Eve that he can't talk about and was the first or second hired essential. And the device and his ability to ship hardware is what allowed this idea to actually go. From me dreaming about the day that we're going to have native crypto experiences on mobile, and they're like, okay, let's go do this.
00:19:23.860 - 00:20:01.756, Speaker D: One important thing there is once you guys hold the device, you'll see it stands alone as a flagship quality Android phone, and it's kind of undercutting the market on price. So worst case, this is just a really awesome Android phone for Android users. But yeah, as you can see from the site, and if you watch the announcement, I think the video is there on solanamobile.com too. Maybe we don't need to watch it now because it's like an hour and a half. You know, the first announcement was. Maybe it's worth mentioning for folks who don't know.
00:20:01.756 - 00:20:40.392, Speaker D: But Solana Mobile Stack is a few different features. It's seed fault that uses the secure element for a custody protocol. It allows instant signing of transactions, but it partitions the private keys from wallets and apps and the rest of the Android operating system. So it's something like cold storage on your phone. And then there's the mobile wallet adapter, which lets you sign transactions basically across all mobile web. So you're not dealing with these web views in applications and copying and pasting links between apps to access mints and things like that. And then there's the DAP store, Solana DAP store.
00:20:40.392 - 00:20:55.260, Speaker D: That is basically no fees, no restrictions on nfts or tokens. And it's just a free playground for all the apps that people have already been using on Salana to just launch in a mobile native way.
00:20:55.410 - 00:21:56.130, Speaker C: And that needs to happen because the digital items like NFTs are owned by the users, right? They're not owned by the content creator. And this is something that just doesn't work with web. Two mobile apps like Google and Apple expect the application that is the mobile app to be the creator that owns that content to be able to take 20% of the value of that content and send it to Google. But like magic, Eden can't add $2,000 in a $10,000 NFT sale on a mobile app because that would kill them, right? It just doesn't work when you get to true digital content, the way that the business models for the big App Stores just don't work. And they'll change eventually, but the only way they'll change is that somebody pokes that bear a little bit. So that's our hope, is that we're the ones that poke them hard enough and they're like, okay, fine, we better change our models. And that frees up mobile for everyone.
00:21:56.820 - 00:22:38.624, Speaker D: I think a couple of things that happened here, too. The first 250,000 users for Salana came through DGen Ape Academy, just these 3d apes. And it was a total shock. We didn't know that was where usage was going to come from. And that was a result of metaplex launching and basically breaking the nifty gateway model of these constrained launches. And no on chain royalty splits and iterated really rapidly through like 100,000 projects into this really strong product market fit for pfps. And then step in, we didn't know step in was going to happen, right? And get to 2 million users that quickly.
00:22:38.624 - 00:23:38.464, Speaker D: And I think if you speak to app developers today, they have no idea how to get something like that through the App Stores. It's so opaque of an approval process. And even if they get through it so long, and then if something gets approved, they're really afraid to iterate on it and change it because it might then get banned. And in my mind, as soon as stepping happened, there should be ten step ins and we should be rapidly saturating everyone who has a key pair on Salana, Ethereum, everywhere with these applications that get product market fit and learn to grow in that way. So we can then figure out how to make them really sustainable and deliver more value through those models. So when we talked to app developers, there was just this very clear, big mental block. Like, we're not even really thinking about a world where we can do anything in the App Store and every user has the ability to sign transactions across the whole operating system.
00:23:38.464 - 00:24:32.532, Speaker D: That's just not like the way we've been operating and with users, it's just very clear pain points. Today, I think crypto is in a very different place than three years ago, because now we can say, look, Salana's got at times 22 million monthly active addresses, 6 million weeklies, and there's millions of people trying to get these nfts. And we hear all the time, like, we see people carrying their laptops through conferences or leaving a party or skipping a party because there's some hot mint happening, or an NFT starts mooning and they're like, I got to go delist it. I literally have to go home. People are leaving. This has become important enough for at least a few hundred thousand people, maybe a few million, that they're leaving their everyday life. I'm sure you guys feel this and experience this.
00:24:32.532 - 00:24:47.080, Speaker D: You can't really live your normal life anymore because we have to access our crypto assets. We found something that is a foundational use case, an asset class, and we're basically tethered to these dells.
00:24:47.580 - 00:25:11.168, Speaker B: So the gist I've gotten is that the mobile stack, the software side of this whole endeavor, is the bigger of the two stories. But the software stack can't fully express itself on the legacy hardware that currently exists in the world today. You can't take the Solana mobile stack and put it on like Apple phone or any other proprietary phone.
00:25:11.254 - 00:25:52.684, Speaker C: You need an OEM's permission to do that because you need an OEM to modify the trusted like us as developers can't get that code through the App Store. So we need to work with Oems and that means working with somebody like saga and having a flagship device and having a founder that gets it, that gets web3, gets the privacy elements of it, and wants to build a thing that represents that. Like, the physical example of that, I think is what can set the example for everyone else in the world eventually. I'd love to have HTC, Samsung, whoever, take sms and integrate. It's just a bunch of open source code, right?
00:25:52.722 - 00:26:16.020, Speaker B: So Solana is not playing in the game of Apple. Or who are the other, like HTC? You guys aren't trying to be Solana labs, like, insanely profitable by selling this bits of hardware. You're using the hardware as like a Trojan horse to get the Solana mobile stack integrated into the greater mobile ecosystem that is beyond your control. Is that right?
00:26:16.170 - 00:27:12.192, Speaker C: I hope we sell a shitload of phones, and I hope saga and awesome are extremely profitable. I mean, that would be great. The thing is that the thesis here is that 50,000 web3 early adopters that have this device, that are active users without any restrictions in the App Store for them, is a better distribution channel for devs than the big App Stores are today with millions of users. That's the big thesis, is that if we can get the right 50,000 people to have these devices, devs are going to build apps and that's going to grow and start growing maybe to 100, 200,000. At some point, Google and Apple will figure it out and be like, okay, we need to have a real web3 model and business model that works with web3. We need all these features. We want signing to be secure for users, and they will shift.
00:27:12.192 - 00:27:26.970, Speaker C: Right, but I don't have this belief that you are going to take down Google and Apple. That's ludicrous, right? A little bit. But crypto believes that they're going to take down the $20 trillion financial system.
00:27:27.680 - 00:27:31.150, Speaker B: We're not going to take it down. We're just going to make a better one.
00:27:32.080 - 00:27:35.420, Speaker C: We want them to change. Right? You want the world to change. Ultimately.
00:27:37.360 - 00:27:39.044, Speaker D: It'S a pretty roundup rebuild.
00:27:39.112 - 00:27:39.584, Speaker B: Right?
00:27:39.702 - 00:28:05.248, Speaker D: We call it web3 for a reason. It's supposed to be fairly foundational. And I think you guys, I'm sure, are as frustrated as we are about this. But all these cycles we've been through, and you hear these partnership announcements and XYZ, big company says, all right, we're doing it. We're doing the crypto thing. We're jumping into web3, and a whole cycle goes by. As soon as the market cools down, they get cold feet.
00:28:05.248 - 00:29:00.068, Speaker D: They lay off whoever they hired to work on it. You got new people come in for the next cycle, try and pick it up, and it just never goes anywhere. There's no durability because unless they see organic grassroots applications that create a credible threat to their core business model, they don't really move. That mean we've seen this like, Goldman Sachs called everything rat poison until the very last possible minute, until there's billions of dollars, leaving all of their most profitable accounts to go into this new DFI thing. Then they say, okay, we're hiring a 30 person team. And who knows? Now with the market downturn, are they still persisting? Are they going to be innovating and pushing things forward? In our experience, it just doesn't happen. So you have to have products that are fully owned and controlled by the crypto industry and that durably, relentlessly push against these problems for users.
00:29:00.164 - 00:29:30.736, Speaker A: Okay, so these are things I think that the Solana community and you guys have clarified for David and myself, because I think the first blush when you see this, the question is like, oh, is Solana trying to get into the hardware game? And do they have the audacity to compete against Apple and Samsung? And what started to make more sense to me as I learned more about this is that's not the purpose, right? David's other nutritional podcast that he's going to start someday. He always says to me that you.
00:29:30.758 - 00:29:31.810, Speaker B: Weren'T supposed to tell.
00:29:34.040 - 00:30:07.550, Speaker A: That's still top secret. He always says to me, carbs are just a delivery mechanism for delivering real food to the body. Okay, so this hardware phone is just a delivery mechanism for SMS, which is the Solana mobile stack and distributing that. And hopefully you get some hardcore fans who want a full stack type phone and buy the hardware. But the goal is to kind of saturate the software stack out there. And so that starts to make more sense to me. You guys are not trying to compete against Apple or Google, but can you build out? And so one other thing.
00:30:07.550 - 00:31:06.316, Speaker A: I think people mistook David and I's take on the roll up. We're actually bullish on the potential of a web3 phone because I think we see what you see, which is like, we can't be beholden to Apple and the Google Store to whitelist metamask. What happens if they just delist our metamask and phantom wallets? What do we do then? And so we need to have a way to route around them. And also, what happens if they disallow all of our, if they call everything that we're doing with all of our crypto economics in app purchases, and they want to cut out of that, and it breaks our terms of service. Sorry, guys. So we absolutely need a way to route around that. But I want to ask you, it's like, are some of the features that come in the hardware side of things? They're already available on our Apple phones and our Samsung phones.
00:31:06.316 - 00:31:12.628, Speaker A: So the seed vault piece. Right? Help me understand. Like, we all have these.
00:31:12.794 - 00:31:41.096, Speaker C: Yeah, you have your board or whatever. It depends how the integration work. There's a separate piece of hardware from your main cpu that is the secure element. And that thing has various features and does various services, but it can hold your secrets. And you have a trust zone component on the chip. It's slightly different on an Apple device, but I'm more familiar with the Qualcomm ones. That thing runs on a chip.
00:31:41.096 - 00:32:15.192, Speaker C: It runs in a special context that the high level OS, Android and all the applications, they can never read the memory there. So that trust zone can decode the seed phrase, get your key generated, and then sign transactions. And they can also take over part of the display or any part of the display, and they can show you a trusted set of things that you're signing. Like the numbers. Like, hey, you're signing this transaction and you're actually signing $100 transfer. And the user can then confirm that. Okay, the wallet didn't lie to me.
00:32:15.192 - 00:32:45.852, Speaker C: I'm actually signing $100 transfer. So all that hardware pieces and all that stuff exists in every phone. It exists in every Qualcomm chip. There's Apple versions of this. And they use these systems for various applications already, like, to decode your thumbprint or whatever, or your face id, but they don't use them for crypto. They don't use them for signing. And I think part of the reason is that there is no crypto adoption.
00:32:45.852 - 00:33:07.450, Speaker C: Actual number of users that sign transactions on a monthly basis, all in aggregate altogether. And all the chains is still pretty, like, I don't know, what do you guys estimate? Like, if you combined all the chains, Salana, even binance, smart chain together, how many humans actually sign stuff? 10 million?
00:33:09.660 - 00:33:12.024, Speaker A: I think it's probably five to 10 million.
00:33:12.142 - 00:33:25.550, Speaker C: Right? And that's not enough for Google and Apple to be like, okay, we got to make changes to the os and make changes to the webster policies when their user numbers are in, like billions, right?
00:33:28.020 - 00:34:03.124, Speaker A: So there's so much more we could get out of these secure enclaves. The hardware piece that we can't, because Google and Apple and other manufacturers aren't giving us the software that would allow us to tap into these things. And that's what Solana mobile stack is trying to do. Okay, and then the mobile wallet adapter, that's open source as well, I believe. So what is that? And also, I'm curious, the context is, is this only for running Solana, or could other blockchains also run on open source?
00:34:03.252 - 00:34:33.056, Speaker C: It's open source, people can send us code, we'll integrate it, we'll get it audited, and we'll make sure it lands. So in that sense, it's true open source. We're doing all the development out front, and we want contributors, but obviously we know Solana best. So everything we're doing is Solana. First, it would be ridiculous for us to try to build an awesome Ethereum integration because we don't know shit about Ethereum. So I don't even want to try. But it is truly open source.
00:34:33.056 - 00:35:03.260, Speaker C: I'm an open source maxi the wallet adapter. When an application has a connect button and you see ten different wallets, and then another application has a different set of wallets, right, that's an application specific connect button. We just want that to go away and for the application to assume the OS has figured out what wallet the user prefers and just be connected automatically, that's os native.
00:35:04.400 - 00:35:06.380, Speaker A: Much easier user experience.
00:35:06.530 - 00:35:29.990, Speaker C: Small piece of code that. Again, we don't have like a 30 person team working on it right now. It's like five engineers, right? So this doesn't take a shit ton of resources to build, but these are small pieces that I feel like should be in every phone and will be in five years when the world has changed and we are in crypto utopia. But right now we need to build them.
00:35:30.360 - 00:36:08.592, Speaker B: Just to clarify, what I think this looks like for the end user is that say, for example, if I opened up my phone right now, I would have my metamask wallet, I would have my other wallet, wallet number three, wallet number four. And each one of these is its own seed phrase. Each one of these is its own private key. But we could change that game. And then, so if I go and I go up to open to my desktop and I go to Uniswap, Uniswap is like, okay, do you have a metamask? Do you have wallet connect? Do you have. And there's like 30 different wallet options. And so with this integration straight into the hardware, there's just like, show me your phone.
00:36:08.592 - 00:36:13.456, Speaker B: I know that's where your private keys are. Just show me that one. And we're good to go. Is that kind of the vision here, Anatoly?
00:36:13.488 - 00:36:14.660, Speaker C: Basically, yep.
00:36:15.480 - 00:36:31.556, Speaker A: And then. Okay, so the last piece here. So we talked about the seed vault, the mobile wallet adapter and so the Solana Dap store. So is there a business model for, like, is there any kind of take rate that the Solana App Store, and then what's like the listing?
00:36:31.748 - 00:36:34.984, Speaker C: So the listing policy is a really hard part.
00:36:35.102 - 00:36:35.768, Speaker A: Okay.
00:36:35.934 - 00:37:13.450, Speaker C: Right now, it's basically going to be like our internal team trying to review it until that can't scale. And the hope is that the saga pass and the ability for us to use the kind of models that we see that work in dows and being able to create moderators and things like that and make that workable, that we can scale that to start doing moderation and creating basically lists. Right. You should be able to subscribe to your monkey, Dow's favorite App Store list, and they're the ones providing the moderation. But that is a gnarly problem. That's going to take a lot of work.
00:37:14.060 - 00:37:16.712, Speaker A: It's gnarly because it's a governance problem, of course. Right?
00:37:16.766 - 00:38:02.810, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. The model for fees and stuff on the App Store, I think, can be something simple in the future. Right now there's no fees, but if you're trying to build something and there's no credible business model at all ever, it's probably not going to work. Right. In the long term, I think the way that this should work is basically some small percentage, sub 1%, like, I don't know, 20 basis point fees in every transaction. Something that I feel like is totally fine because it's paying for the development of the product, but it's not crushing the whole business models for all the applications running on it.
00:38:03.340 - 00:38:27.584, Speaker A: And to be clear, so if somebody had the saga phone or some other Android phone with the Solana mobile operating system installed on it, you'd have the Solana DaP store, and then you'd also have the Google App Store as well. So you download all your other Google apps through that. And then the Salana App Store is for kind of the web. Three things.
00:38:27.782 - 00:38:48.070, Speaker C: Yep. So it's fully Google mobile service enabled. All your Google stuff is there. Awesome has some kind of lockdown modes where you can basically kill services. So you can, if you want to, as a user, shut down Google or other services. And that's a pretty cool feature that the awesome team built.
00:38:48.920 - 00:39:12.270, Speaker D: It's worth mentioning also that it's not just dapps that can launch in the Solana DAP store. Any application that wants to launch in a no fee environment can launch in that App Store. So we've already seen a lot of the games that are leaning into web3 looking at this as a pretty attractive mobile play, independent of their desire to have digital assets within the game.
00:39:13.200 - 00:39:45.290, Speaker B: I do think it's important to understand from a development standpoint or an innovation standpoint that like 30% take rate that Apple charges on the iOS App Store. That's like good tax in which it's a stunt on innovation and progress. And especially in the web3 world, when so much of the back ends of so many apps is a blockchain. Openc is not going to have an iOS app because they're not going to give Apple 30% of the volume going through open. That's not going to happen. Right.
00:39:45.980 - 00:39:58.620, Speaker C: It's physically impossible for them to do that totally. They would go bankrupt. Right. Or the users are never going to pay 30% markup on any digital purchases, just not going to work 100%.
00:39:58.690 - 00:40:32.250, Speaker B: And so not only has the whole rest of the world been deprived of a zero fee environment to fully innovate and express the world of just like mobile apps, because Apple keeps on taking it all, the web3 world never really had that opportunity, but also needs it even more because it's inherently about money and transactions and trading and swapping and all these things. So we've never actually really seen a blossoming mobile developer ecosystem. So it's kind of like, no wonder why there hasn't been a blossom developer ecosystem that's gone mobile. Hopefully before this.
00:40:34.140 - 00:40:44.280, Speaker C: It's really, really hard to build a phone. I worked on every phone that failed that you've ever heard of. Like the webOS devices, the BlackBerry QNX ones.
00:40:44.430 - 00:40:45.888, Speaker A: You're talking before iPhones.
00:40:46.004 - 00:41:21.316, Speaker C: Yeah. Metrophone, the Amazon fire. Do you remember that thing? I do. So I was like one of the engineers trying to get those things to work and it's really tough. And I think the real opportunity we have is that maybe the crypto users are actually the most lucrative users in the world right now. Because look at open sea's volumes, look at Magic Eden's volumes. The number of users that they have is much, much smaller than any app in the iOS store that's in the top ten.
00:41:21.316 - 00:41:27.610, Speaker C: But they're generating a ton of real profit and a ton of real revenue. So that's the opportunity.
00:41:28.140 - 00:42:17.832, Speaker A: One more question for you guys, then when we got a cup for sponsors, we have a whole lot more to cover, including the phone wars and some of the competitors that are entering and second order effects and how this thing was funded and everything else. But what about this criticism? This is not a criticism or a critique we raised on the roll up, but some people are saying like, hey, anatoli, Raj, look, building a scalable blockchain is freaking hard, okay? And like, there's a lot of work to do. Okay. Solana has had some outages. Of course, everyone knows Ethereum has not scaled yet, still hasn't done its merge. We have a lot of work to do. Is this a distraction or why not have a separate team do this? Why are you guys personally involved? What would you say to that critique or question?
00:42:17.966 - 00:43:29.820, Speaker C: So for the same reason that you can't add more engineers and accelerate the merge, you need experts that are deep working on hard problems. And a lot of those hard problems are solved by only one engineer that just given time and space to do it. And there's a really strong core team of system engineers that are constantly iterating on the chain and making it better and cheaper and faster and more reliable. If they need hires, they will get hires, right? Like I said before, there's like five engineers at labs that are separate team, a new team that we spun up. My Qualcomm background gives me a really strong network of pulling from the mobile world, and that team is building this, and it's a separate product. And our focus on this is people think it's a distraction. But part of the reason why this idea came to fruition, in large part is that I talked to devs and I constantly ask him, what are the problems you're dealing with? What are the challenges? And half of the conversations ended up mobile.
00:43:29.820 - 00:43:55.400, Speaker C: We can't do what we want. We have to go through these weird interfaces and jump through webviews with Phantom. And when that problem gets repeated to me over and over, I start pacing around the room trying to figure out how do I fix it. So this idea of launching sms on the phone really comes from just talking to devs and us telling us this is a problem and we don't know how to fix it.
00:43:55.550 - 00:44:34.480, Speaker A: One last thing I'll say in support of that, and then we got to cut, though, is some people think that scalability just means transactions per second. But I think when you define scalability as we want to bring a billion people into crypto, then you also have to take other things into account. You have to think about privacy. You have to look at user experience. You have to look at the fact that it is still mission impossible to go bankless unless you have a desktop machine, you can't go solely bankless on a mobile device right now. It's just not possible. And so that is also another definition of scalability.
00:44:34.480 - 00:44:36.020, Speaker A: If you kind of broaden.
00:44:39.320 - 00:44:42.180, Speaker C: That, you guys are going to try to destroy.
00:44:45.100 - 00:44:48.344, Speaker A: For the second half, which David's about to go there.
00:44:48.462 - 00:44:52.216, Speaker C: Softening me up, I guess in the.
00:44:52.238 - 00:45:37.720, Speaker B: Second half of the show, Ryan already listed off a few of the topics, but also there's this like Jason Keats guy who I didn't know who he was before I started researching all about this. So I want to ask you guys about that and then all the things that Ryan mentioned about five minutes ago. So we're going to get into all those topics and more right after get to some of these fantastic sponsors to make the show possible. There is a brand new staking feature in the Ledger Live app today. We all like staking the assets that we're bullish on and now you can stake seven different coins inside the Ledger live app. Cosmos, Polkadot, Tron, Algorand, Pezos, Solana and of course Ethereum. With Ledger Live, you can take money from your bank account, buy your most bullish crypto asset and stake that asset to its network all inside the Ledger Live app, through a partnership with figment Ledger also lets you choose which validator you want to stake your assets with.
00:45:37.720 - 00:46:04.684, Speaker B: And Ledger is running its own validating nodes, offering a convenient way to participate in network validation. And it even comes with slashing insurance. Ledger Live is truly becoming the battle station for the bankless world. So go download Ledger live. If you have a ledger already, you probably already have it and get started securely staking your crypto assets. The Brave browser is the user first browser for the web3 Internet with over 60 million monthly active users. And inside the Brave browser, you'll find the Brave wallet, the secure, multitrain crypto wallet built right into the browser.
00:46:04.684 - 00:46:36.324, Speaker B: Web three is freedom from big Tech and Wall street, more control and better privacy. But there's a weak point in web3. Your crypto wallet and most crypto wallets are browser extensions which can easily be spoofed. But the brave wallet is different, no extensions are required, which gives brave browser an extra level of security versus other wallets. Brave Wallet is your secure passport for the possibilities of web3 and supports multiple chains including Ethereum and Salana. You can even buy crypto directly inside the wallet with ramp. And of course you can store, send and swap your crypto assets, manage your nfts, and connect to other wallets and DFI apps.
00:46:36.324 - 00:46:58.444, Speaker B: So whether you're new to crypto or you're a seasoned pro. It's time to ditch those risky extensions, and it's time to switch to the brave wallet. Download Brave@brave.com bankless and click the wallet icon to get started. The L2 era is upon us. Ethereum's L2 ecosystem is growing every day, and we need L2 bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a L2 life. Across is the fastest, cheapest, and most secure crosschain bridge.
00:46:58.444 - 00:47:36.700, Speaker B: With across. You don't have to worry about high fees or long wait times. Assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously. Across its bridges are powered by UMA's optimistic oracle to securely transfer tokens between L2 s and Ethereum across its critical ecosystem infrastructure and across v two has just launched. Their new version focuses on higher capital efficiency, L2 to L2 transfers, and a brand new chain with Polygon, all while prioritizing high security and low fees. You can be a part of across's story by joining their discord and using across for all of your L2 transferring needs. So go to across to quickly and securely bridge your assets between Ethereum, optimism, Polygon, Arbitrum, or Boba networks.
00:47:36.700 - 00:47:59.910, Speaker B: All right, bankless nation, we are back with the co founders of Salana. And as I was going through the process of putting this whole agenda together, I came across this name, Jason Keats, who everyone seems to speak really, really highly of, but I had no idea who this individual was. Anatolia, you want to walk us through who Jason Keats is, how he's working with you guys on this saga phone, and what's his deal?
00:48:00.680 - 00:48:08.072, Speaker D: Before you launch into that real quick, I can plug. Totally. Just did an interview with Jason on the Solana podcast, so everyone should go check that one out.
00:48:08.206 - 00:49:00.888, Speaker C: But I'll summarize it. So he's an astrophysicist. They got into hardware because he started building stuff for his professor for telescopes, and he was like, I like this more, and started. That's where his kind of career started. And he ended up starting a motorcycle company, then working on solar panels, then joining Apple and leading the lead architect for iPad Pro. The first one, when they went from iPad to iPad Pro, he was like the guy that did it and was the first or second employee at Essential, which is Andy Rubin's company, like the founder of the Android and this project. Awesome was his baby is like, I can build a better phone than anyone else, and I have the best people to do that.
00:49:00.888 - 00:49:49.610, Speaker C: And so they decided to build this thing. And they got from nothing to evt one like a working device fully built in like six months, which is pretty insane. And that's the point where I met him and I started talking to him about trying to red pill him into web3 and mobile and my vision for it. And you never know these conversations, right? You meet 1000 people that are not in crypto and you talk to them and all of a sudden just everything clicked for him and he was like, okay, let's do this. Let's make a device that's like web3 first, but an awesome device, like a flagship, top of the line Android device that can be head to head, be competitive with the best out of Samsung or Apple, even.
00:49:50.780 - 00:50:03.916, Speaker A: Awesome. Anatoly. And it's Osom. Okay, I was not following that pronunciation. I thought you were saying awe S-O-M like awesome. But this is awesome. Is it? Right?
00:50:04.018 - 00:50:04.476, Speaker C: Yes.
00:50:04.578 - 00:50:14.224, Speaker A: And this is what the saga phone essentially is. It's a creation, hardware creation that awesome and Jason made.
00:50:14.422 - 00:50:15.170, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:50:15.940 - 00:50:45.460, Speaker D: It's worth mentioning that I think if this was five years ago, ten years ago, it probably would take five or ten times as many people as the awesome team has. It's a pretty small team, and also they're super high powered, they're very nimble, they move super fast, they bring things to market really quickly. And I think when Tolly meets somebody like that, often, that speaks a lot. And things move really quickly in a partnership.
00:50:45.620 - 00:50:56.876, Speaker B: And Anatoly, you've got the hardware with you right now, right? I know we're going to try and communicate what the device is like through Internet, which is going to be hard, but what's it like? Can you describe it?
00:50:56.978 - 00:51:21.896, Speaker C: Okay, so it's got a 120 FPS screen. It's like bright and beautiful. Just looks great. And it's got a metal case, so it feels really good and high end. I like it more than the glass devices that you see out of Apple and stuff. Beyond that, it's like just a really good Android phone. I don't know how else to describe it.
00:51:21.896 - 00:51:30.090, Speaker C: When people get this device, they're going to be like, this has the feel of what a premium Android device should feel like.
00:51:30.700 - 00:51:31.304, Speaker B: Cool.
00:51:31.422 - 00:52:09.092, Speaker A: Very cool. Anatoly, we want to also talk about some other competitors who have kind of thrown their hat in the ring here. And part of the theme is it felt like Solana launched something, and then all of a sudden this ethos device, maybe it's not a device. A software, mobile software for Ethereum is on the scene. And Polygon as well, announced a partnership with HTC. Is this all, like, just coincidence that everyone had the same good idea and they're all trying to implement it at once? Or like, what's going on with the timing of all of this?
00:52:09.146 - 00:52:44.352, Speaker C: I'm going to say we kicked it off, but I don't know. I think generally there's enough really smart people in crypto now that they're all working on all the good ideas and maybe the first one to go lurches everyone else forward. And we made a big splash and announcement that I think kind of maybe drove some of those decisions to like, okay, we actually have to move a little faster and get shit out. But I doubt we were the only ones thinking about how we crack mobile open for crypto. But I'll take the credit for it. Sure.
00:52:44.406 - 00:52:50.864, Speaker A: What do you think about these other approaches? Are they similar, like ethos? We haven't gone into detail on it, but I don't know if you've looked.
00:52:50.902 - 00:53:55.644, Speaker C: At it, I would have to dig into it. I think from what I'm seeing on the website, I think it's probably similar ideas to sms, but I don't know how deep they go in terms of the integration. And also what is the integration on this device? Are they doing the secure, trusted element work and all these other UX improvements? The difference between Apple computers and the non Apple computers in the 80s, there was like a vision behind them to integrate them in a very specific way. And I hope that we have that vision right between myself and Jason, that we optimize this device from the fact how fast the thumbprint decides that you sign the transaction and all these things. We really want to iterate and make it like an experience that people enjoy. And then when they use something else, you're, ah, this sucks, right? You want to get used to the good thing and make it really good. So I hope that's what we can achieve.
00:53:55.644 - 00:53:57.608, Speaker C: Me and Jason working together.
00:53:57.774 - 00:54:22.770, Speaker A: I just want to make the point to bankless listeners that more competitors entering this space. Good. It's good for you as a user. Okay. Because all of these software companies are now fighting to make the best possible crypto web3 mobile user experience. And they're fighting for you, for your usage so that you use their software and their phone. And that means we all get better together.
00:54:24.180 - 00:54:40.740, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. I've always been a fan of competition. It's actually really sad to be building something alone because you don't get to bounce off and see ideas that other people form and adopt them. And things move much, much faster when you have competitors.
00:54:41.560 - 00:54:47.610, Speaker B: So I'm curious, how much did this all cost, and how is that paid for?
00:54:50.380 - 00:55:41.050, Speaker C: I don't know if we can talk about numbers, but this wasn't, like, a huge financial risk. In terms of Solana, it's five engineers. We have a partnership and some financial terms with awesome. But nothing that's like the cost of launching a phone today is much, much lower than five years ago because you are sitting on a ridiculously optimized supply chain for building these devices for a dozen different companies and using Android, which is a very mature OS, very mature ux. And that's, like, the huge difference these days. When Facebook tried to build their phone, they wanted to build everything from scratch. Their own os from the ground up, their own application store, similar with windows, and that's a 300 engineer kind of thing.
00:55:41.050 - 00:55:44.090, Speaker C: There's no way we could have pulled that off.
00:55:44.780 - 00:56:20.292, Speaker D: Jason also has a ton of pretty long standing supplier relationships that he's been able to pull strings for. And that's why the phone has the latest Qualcomm chip. It may be maybe the first phone that hits the market with the latest Qualcomm chip. So Jason's really super efficient. He's got great relationships to leverage, and I think the suppliers also kind of see the path here. I mean, there hasn't been a more credible force in tech to launch a new mobile platform and suite of hardware products than crypto and web3. And they know that.
00:56:20.292 - 00:56:30.970, Speaker D: So I think everyone's watching. If this is successful, they're prepared to back more products, lower end products, more hardware, peripherals, whatever the market will support.
00:56:31.500 - 00:56:54.592, Speaker A: Okay, so this is all great, guys, and thank you for walking us through this. I think hopefully bankless listeners learned a lot. Certainly we did as well. I probably have one last question, or, like, critique. I told you the second half was going to get a bit more tough. Like, okay, so here's. I think what you've clarified for me is Solana is not trying to get in the hardware game.
00:56:54.592 - 00:57:37.492, Speaker A: Totally get it. That makes a lot more sense to me. The value proposition here is the SMS product itself. I was always bullish on the idea of a web3 software product for mobile, because, again, you can't go bankless unless you have a desktop machine, and that is clearly not the future. All right, so all of that is making sense with what you guys are doing, this strategy. What my question is, and this is still a clarification point to you, that I'm learning a bit more about the Solana ecosystem, is the Ethereum foundations. Their approach to this, in the spirit of decentralization, is addition through subtraction.
00:57:37.492 - 00:58:05.892, Speaker A: Right. So their idea, the Ethereum foundation, is that they slowly want to ossify the protocol and then go away. All right. I think I was initially under the impression that the Solana phone was being developed and funded by the Solana foundation. Okay. I learned that is not the case. There is this entity called Solana Labs, which is kind of a commercial entity building commercial products for the Solana ecosystem.
00:58:05.892 - 00:58:20.952, Speaker A: And that helps. That is interesting to me. So if you put your Ethereum hat on, right? You'd say, like, almost Salana labs is kind of a little bit like consensus, which they built infuria, they built metamask, they built all of these products to support the Ethereum.
00:58:21.016 - 00:58:22.956, Speaker B: Probably tried a phone at some point in time.
00:58:23.138 - 00:58:25.852, Speaker C: They probably have 20 times smaller, though.
00:58:25.986 - 00:58:52.164, Speaker A: Okay. And if Ruben's listening, he's probably like, oh, phone, good idea. I'm on that. I'm working on that. Okay, so I get that difference. Now, one of my hangups is we are looking for a more decentralized future here, which means, ultimately, we don't want any centralized development team to control the fate of a blockchain or the ecosystem or to have undue presence. Right.
00:58:52.164 - 00:59:23.440, Speaker A: And so you have the Solana foundation, which is separate. You have Solana Labs, which is the commercial entity. But there seems to be, like, I don't know how the funding works. Maybe you could clarify that if Solana Labs is funded by Sol tokens. But you guys are involved in both Solana Labs and the Solana foundation and the Solana protocol itself. It just seems to be, there's kind of a centralization aspect that's different than the Ethereum ecosystem. So help me understand this element of it.
00:59:23.440 - 00:59:36.950, Speaker A: And do you actually think that this is a concern, or am I kind of overplaying it? Am I like, oh, well, it looks like this in Ethereum, and why isn't it exactly like that in Solana? And maybe there's a case of that, too. Help me understand.
00:59:40.200 - 01:00:00.700, Speaker C: I think it's good to be concerned about it, because I think ultimately, I don't want centralization. And the foundation has a totally different goal, different board, different people on it, and they're driving towards decentralization. And, like, billion users with self custody, that's kind of their stick.
01:00:01.280 - 01:00:05.180, Speaker D: Anatole is not even involved with the foundation anymore, so he doesn't.
01:00:06.160 - 01:01:27.908, Speaker C: I got to step down from it because Leo from Certus is an amazing engineer that's able to take my role as the person that knows the network inside out at the foundation, and I can hand it off to an amazing community member. I don't know if you guys know Certus one or Leo at all, but an awesome. So, like, labs is able to build products, and labs has a bunch of money to do that, and a bunch of engineers to do that. And it tries to build products that generally are not competing with ecosystem projects. So we don't want to build like a magic Eden or a phantom, because we see that there's amazing, really rock star teams that have funding and are executing with a vision and just kicking ass, but stuff like the phone, there's no team in the ecosystem that's able to do it. And this is where we see an opportunity to, okay, maybe we do something here and it pushes the domino in the ecosystem and unlocks it. And metaplax, the thing that started the NFT craze on Solana, that was incubated by a couple engineers out of Solana and a product manager, and that got spun out as a separate, like, that's been kind of how labs operates in terms of like, it's worth mentioning.
01:01:27.924 - 01:02:09.620, Speaker D: By the way, you mentioned consensus, and they built infura, they built metamask, they built truffle. And on Solana we have quicknote and Genesis go, and all these RPC node providers, we have Phantom. Anatoly mentioned Magic Eden, there's anchor. All these already got built independently by ecosystem projects that often, if we tried to even invest in them, there wasn't room. By the time they got off the ground, they got product market fit really quickly. So a lot of that based stuff, you could argue, happened in a much more decentralized way. It didn't happen from a founder or an organization related to the creation of Solana, the network.
01:02:10.120 - 01:03:20.124, Speaker C: I think there is a difference here, though, with Ethereum, where I don't know if Solana will ossify, I think it'll become more like Linux, where there is a wider group of people that are developing the protocol at different companies that are contributing to it, and the features track the demands that people have on the hardware as the hardware changes. Because the way that Solana works is so tied to how hardware develops, like network cards and cpus and all the stuff that we optimize for to take advantage of that, that changes every two years, right? That slightly changes. And the protocol has to, like, the runtime has to change, the implementations have to change. They do so in a way that doesn't break applications, but that means that the code has to be updated and people have to do that. And as the network has matured, we now have like Jira which is building Mav clients. They're contributing to the core code because they have a dependency on the core code to do a certain thing. Like mango guys started contributing to the core code because they were seeing performance bottlenecks in their application that they were able to fix.
01:03:20.124 - 01:03:47.430, Speaker C: And this is more like Linux where Intel, red Hat, all sorts of different companies. You can say that Red Hat was like labs, right? They had the most developers at one point working on know the most core devs. But at some point it really became a really small part of Linux as a whole. Like I'd say at this point, probably Google Android guys contribute more lines of code to Linux than anyone else.
01:03:48.680 - 01:04:35.828, Speaker A: Thank you guys. That's helpful, I guess. Last question for you, not on the phone topic, but just since we're on the topic of differences between kind of the Ethereum ecosystem and Solana, can you guys just provide an update on scaling and kind of uptime and what the plan is there? Because I feel like David and myself and bankless listeners have our heads wrapped around the modular blockchain scalability approach. Settlement with roll ups and l two s and high settlement assurances. And ideally like maximum decentralization. But Salana, I think has historically taken a different approach. I want to hear what the approach to Salana scaling is right now, how you guys are thinking about this.
01:04:35.828 - 01:04:36.356, Speaker A: Sure.
01:04:36.458 - 01:05:26.128, Speaker C: So this goes back to the heart of, I think, what decentralization means to us, right? Like to the Solana community, how we define it. And this comes down to what are these networks supposed to provide? And from my understanding is that data availability and extreme security of that data is what these networks are supposed to provide. And like Yellowstone blows up, the network is supposed to maintain that state in a provable way. And that doesn't actually mean uptime. You need at least one copy of the state to survive. So you can say like, hey look, I got the copy of the Ledger Yellowstone blew up, Russia launched nukes, but I still got my one copy in an island somewhere. And I can prove it to you because I have all the cryptographic signatures from all the validators.
01:05:26.128 - 01:06:21.780, Speaker C: This is the copy and it repopulates the network. And that obviously means in that scenario uptime is down and you're somehow getting all the validators together and re hypothecating the network and rebooting it. But that process is part of running these systems because you're depending on somebody somewhere keep the copy of the state and being able to recover it no matter what. Now, what that means is that we need to maximize the number of independent, truly independent people that run these nodes for some reason, and maintain those in a secure environment. And that includes people that run validators because they want tokens. It includes circle, binance, tether with all the exchanges, also like DaO communities, because they want to run a node for fun. But also apps with RPCs.
01:06:21.780 - 01:07:15.588, Speaker C: Half of the full nodes on the network right now are because there's so much demand for RPC providers, because they're serving users for all the apps that are on Solana. And all those copies of the state are valid copies of the state. Any one of those can recover. So scalability ties into this because we can't have a network that limits the number of full nodes, right? We have to design it in such a way that maximizes the number of people that can join the network, that can connect to it, and therefore maintain that copy in a real time, secure way. Like when the block is finalized, it's finalized everywhere globally, in the entire world. So that means it's got to process a shit ton of signatures per second, because every vote from a validator is a signature. It's got to handle a lot of network bandwidth, because every vote takes network bandwidth.
01:07:15.588 - 01:08:06.760, Speaker C: And this is kind of how we're thinking about it. We need to optimize it and allow validators to deploy hardware that allows them to scale it in an unbounded way. So scalability to us means that if there's a bottleneck, the validators can just add cores and that bottleneck goes away. It doesn't require us to make protocol changes or launch l two s or anything like that. Not that that's a different solution, different approach, right? Like, not knocking it in any way, but having the power of scalability given to the validators. And the only thing that they need to do is go order some shit on Amazon and deploy better hardware, means that we're kind of done right. Like the network is scalable to whatever know organized sand allows.
01:08:07.740 - 01:08:15.460, Speaker A: David, I think I did the thing again where I just opened up the door to an entirely different podcast at the end of this podcast.
01:08:15.620 - 01:08:17.528, Speaker B: That's what I'm currently wrapping my head around.
01:08:17.614 - 01:08:23.596, Speaker A: Yeah, I know, because David's gearing up to ask more questions. You know what I think we should.
01:08:23.618 - 01:08:32.096, Speaker C: Do the, is that the cost of the hardware seems to be a violation of an Ethereum ethos, which is.
01:08:32.118 - 01:08:32.690, Speaker A: Right.
01:08:34.500 - 01:09:05.112, Speaker B: You said similar words that we say in the Ethereum camp where, yeah, we want everyone to participate in network validation. Everyone should permissionlessly join the network as they so choose. But we're both using these things. But there's still a difference in what those things actually translates into. One is like, in the Ethereum camp, like a $500 to $750 laptop. And in Salana, in the Salana world, it's like, well, do you have the means? And are you connected to Amazon prime? And are you willing to spend an extra, like two to. I don't know what the.
01:09:05.166 - 01:09:20.188, Speaker A: And I think Anatoly would probably say that doesn't even matter. That's an inconsequential cost in the scheme of. When you're talking about 32 eth and we go on, we'd have a. So I feel like we've just opened the door to a. To be continued because we all love each other.
01:09:20.274 - 01:09:21.696, Speaker B: At the end of the day, we.
01:09:21.718 - 01:09:24.480, Speaker A: Want to bring you guys back and talk about that probably.
01:09:24.550 - 01:09:40.288, Speaker B: I think there are some crypto developers out there, some Ethereum researchers who would see that, okay, somebody's got to save this state. And if somebody has one saved state, then we're good to go. I'm not smart enough to make the argument myself, but I think that would offend a lot of core Ethereum developers.
01:09:40.384 - 01:09:50.840, Speaker A: Yeah, we should have you guys back and we shouldn't do this now, David, we should have these guys back and have that conversation maybe in debate type Dunkrad on here.
01:09:50.910 - 01:09:52.344, Speaker C: I love him. Awesome.
01:09:52.462 - 01:09:54.712, Speaker A: All right. This is an invitation for a future.
01:09:54.766 - 01:09:56.596, Speaker B: But to be clear, we have covered.
01:09:56.708 - 01:10:11.136, Speaker A: Out the web3 mobile phone. That has been the scope of today's conversation. Anatoli, Raj, thank you so much for coming to bankless and telling us more about that. Yeah, we appreciate it. Keep building during the build market. That's what we're here to do. Thank you.
01:10:11.238 - 01:10:11.872, Speaker D: Thanks, guys.
01:10:11.926 - 01:10:12.656, Speaker C: Thank you, guys.
01:10:12.758 - 01:10:13.532, Speaker D: Take care, Chris.
01:10:13.596 - 01:10:19.980, Speaker A: And disclaimers, of course, all of crypto is risky. You could definitely lose what you put in. But we are headed west. This is the frontier.
