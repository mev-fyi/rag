00:00:00.000 - 00:00:03.310, Speaker B: What does Vitalik do after the conference day is over and the sun goes down?
00:00:03.380 - 00:00:17.774, Speaker A: Generally have been trying to have fairly quiet dinners and go to sleep fairly early. Yeah. I don't know. I'm realizing I'm definitely not a fan of the late night stuff, possibly because I'm just totally out of energy from talking to people that I don't want to do anymore of that. Yeah.
00:00:17.972 - 00:00:21.406, Speaker B: Is it draining to be at a conference where everyone is hounding you?
00:00:21.508 - 00:00:22.014, Speaker A: Absolutely.
00:00:22.132 - 00:00:24.782, Speaker B: Yeah. How have you managed this? Have you learned to.
00:00:24.836 - 00:00:38.500, Speaker A: Drive, like, all this realistically? Just, like, try to be aware of when I have the energy for this stuff and when I don't hide. I don't know. It's probably better to hide than to just go out anyway and have some risk of accidentally being mean to someone. Definitely.
