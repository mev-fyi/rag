00:00:06.570 - 00:00:15.966, Speaker A: Welcome to Bankless, where we explore the frontier of Internet money and Internet finance. This is how to get started, how to get better, and how to front run the opportunity.
00:00:16.148 - 00:00:16.826, Speaker B: I'm Ryan.
00:00:16.858 - 00:00:28.102, Speaker A: Sean Adams. I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless. David, we have Vitalik on once again. What topics do we cover?
00:00:28.236 - 00:00:42.618, Speaker C: Yeah, we cover three of his most recent blogs on his Vitalik, CA blog. These are all fantastic reads, and in order to help amplify Vitalik's message and try and get out what he's trying to get out, we go through each of these blog pieces together.
00:00:42.704 - 00:00:44.858, Speaker D: We start with his recap of 2020.
00:00:44.864 - 00:01:02.558, Speaker C: And his forward looking kind of his forward looking predictions into 2021. That blog was particularly interesting. That's how we start the conversation. We move into his blog post called an incomplete guide to roll ups, and he kind of helped us unpack what it is to be a roll up.
00:01:02.644 - 00:01:04.734, Speaker D: How we as an Ethereum l two.
00:01:04.772 - 00:01:11.986, Speaker C: Scaling community landed on roll ups as a construction and why they are so powerful. And then we also get into the.
00:01:12.008 - 00:01:13.774, Speaker D: Topic of social recovery wallet.
00:01:13.822 - 00:01:16.178, Speaker C: So these are all relatively three different.
00:01:16.344 - 00:01:17.814, Speaker D: Topics, but I would say they are.
00:01:17.852 - 00:01:43.606, Speaker C: All forward looking topics that Vitalik sees as kind of like the logical conclusion of a lot of different forces, perhaps, maybe a lot of them social, a lot of them political in his first blog post that we get into. But then the second two are more technological and about the way that Ethereum, the landscape is going to manifest and mature over time. So again, a wide ranging conversation, but still with a lot of awesome through lines.
00:01:43.718 - 00:02:07.480, Speaker A: Absolutely. If you're listening on the podcast, of course we have this on YouTube as well, where we actually go through the articles visually. If you're watching this on YouTube, you can check it out on the podcast and get it directly into your ears. Make it more portable that way. David, we should just get right into the interview. But before we do, guys, we want to talk about the sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:02:08.250 - 00:03:10.490, Speaker D: Ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on Ethereum and just recently released Ave version two, which has a ton of cool new features that makes using Ave even more powerful. With Ave, you can leverage the full power of DFI money, legos, yield and composability all in one application. On Ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield, and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol. If you have deposited collateral here, you can see me getting a 200 USDC loan against my portfolio of a number of different DFI tokens and ETH. I'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option, but I could choose the stable interest rate option if I wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently. One of Ave's v two features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets, trade them on Uniswap, and then deposit them back into Ave. Ave does all of this for you, all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them.
00:03:10.490 - 00:03:55.414, Speaker D: Check out the power of aave@aave.com that's aave.com. If you are looking for a product that connects your fiat bank account with Defi tokens and products, you need to download the Dharma mobile app. Dharma is a non custodial smart contract wallet and comes with a bridge that connects you right into your bank account. Dharma is the fastest and most efficient wallet between your fiat in your bank account and any token on Uniswap or even any vault in yearn. With Dharma, you can get over $25,000 per week into the DFI universe, and you can do it noncustodially. If you or anyone you know is hot on DFI and you're trying to get your money into a Defi investment, Dharma is the place to go.
00:03:55.414 - 00:04:17.754, Speaker D: Signing up and going through KYC is an absolute breeze. It took me just under 3 minutes, and after signing into my bank account via plaid, I am now just one transaction away from any token that Uniswap has to offer. Go to ww Dharma IO. That's D-H-A-R-M-A IO. Download the Dharma app and get yourself unbanked.
00:04:17.802 - 00:04:59.210, Speaker A: Today, this is all around the subject of social recovery wallets. So we were talking about scalability, I suppose, with roll ups and a typical ethereum user feels that pain when they pay for a $20 uniswap transaction. Right? Another pain point that Ethereum users feel is around securing your private keys. And this is definitely a hindrance to mainstream adoption. I think a lot of crypto ends up in exchanges just because people are uncertain. They don't feel like they have the tools or the competency to secure their own crypto.
00:04:59.710 - 00:05:06.414, Speaker C: And of course is like a rite of passage coming into this industry, which is definitely something that we should have a band aid for.
00:05:06.612 - 00:05:50.746, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. And of course, not your keys, not your crypto, as our friend Andreas says. And certainly if you want to become bankless and go bankless, you can't keep your private keys inside of a crypto exchange. So right now, best practice is we have things like metamask, which is an extension of the driver. If you want to be a bit more secure, you can use a hardware wallet. But, Vitalik, you're presenting kind of this maybe this third way, this idea of a social recovery wallet. So could you give us a quick synopsis on what a social recovery wallet is and why it's important? Where do you want to start with this one?
00:05:50.928 - 00:06:21.218, Speaker B: Sure. And I guess we can just start off with what the thing is. So if you scroll down to control f social recovery is better, then there's a diagram a bit further down it. There we go. Yeah. So basically, the idea is that a social recovery wallet is a smart contract wallet. So if you use a social recovery wallet, your account is a smart contract, and your assets would be in that smart contract.
00:06:21.218 - 00:07:14.390, Speaker B: And the smart contract has these rules that say that there is a signing key and that signing key can be used to approve transactions. And then you have this concept of guardians, right? And the idea is that there's a set of some number of guardians, at least three, I recommend even going up to five or seven if you know enough crypto people. And of these guardians, a majority of them can cooperate to change the signing key of an account if you lose your signing key. So the goal of this is basically just account recovery, right. And account recovery is just something that everyone ends up needing from time to time, and it's something that lots of services really don't do well. Right. So if you lose your Google or account, then you have to go through customer service, and often it's even just very hard to recover your account.
00:07:14.390 - 00:08:13.094, Speaker B: And I've known people who are just never able to do that. And in the case of crypto, of course, if you just use a regular wallet, well, if you lose your password, you're screwed. And there's just so many examples of people who just lose access to their account and they end up being completely screwed, whether they lose it because they forget a password or because they lose their computer and they just never had a backup anywhere, or because they reinstall their operating system and they forget to copy over the files that happen to contain some of their keys. There's just this kind of whole set of reasons. Their funds are on a paper wallet, but they forget the piece of paper. Their funds are on a hardware wallet, and something happens to that hardware wallet. There's just lots of reasons why you can lose your funds.
00:08:13.094 - 00:08:30.320, Speaker B: And so social recovery basically says, well, you can specify some set of guardians. And this could be institutions, this could be your friends or family. This could even be just other devices owned by yourself. And the majority of these guardians has the ability to basically reset your key.
00:08:31.090 - 00:08:33.706, Speaker A: So this is a pretty simple idea, quite honestly.
00:08:33.738 - 00:08:33.934, Speaker B: Right.
00:08:33.972 - 00:09:04.502, Speaker A: So problem that we're solving is custody of private keys is hard, and people can lose them. And if they lose them, it's a disaster. You lose your entire crypto. So solution is twofold. You have a smart contract based wallet, and then you have this squishy meat space idea of guardians. And people who have a Google account are probably used to this. There's a setting in your Gmail account where you can set your spouse or a friend's email address to recover your password.
00:09:04.566 - 00:09:04.794, Speaker B: Right.
00:09:04.832 - 00:09:17.646, Speaker A: This is a similar idea, only you're delegating that guardianship, possibly to some other private keys. And this could be friends and family, this could be other devices, that sort of thing.
00:09:17.748 - 00:09:20.890, Speaker D: This feels very squishy, though, really importantly.
00:09:20.970 - 00:09:28.094, Speaker B: Not one of one. It's m of N. Right. So that's a huge difference between, say, gmail's recovery email feature, right?
00:09:28.132 - 00:09:37.810, Speaker A: So it would be a set of guardians that would then when they come together, their powers combined, they can restore your wallet.
00:09:37.970 - 00:10:30.760, Speaker B: So interestingly enough, WeChat already does this, right? If you just wants to log on to your account and you don't have a password or you don't have some other authentication, then you can create the account. And then what it does is it basically requires you to, it gives you some contacts. I believe it's something like that. It just automatically chooses some contacts that you frequently interact with, and it sends them a confirmation code, and they have to give you the confirmation code, or you have to give them the confirmation code and they have to type it in a chat with you. I forget it's one of those two. And so basically, if you can multiple of your frequent contacts type in these confirmation codes, then you can access your account.
00:10:32.490 - 00:10:45.530, Speaker A: So two things I'd be worried about with this Vitalik. Right. The first is, okay, you said you're essentially putting your private keys inside of a smart contract wallet, right. And there have been smart contract.
00:10:46.910 - 00:10:56.234, Speaker B: Right. So this is basically saying instead of your private keys, controlling funds. The smart contract is controlling funds.
00:10:56.362 - 00:10:57.040, Speaker A: Right.
00:10:57.490 - 00:11:00.666, Speaker B: Ability to replace your private keys if you lose your private keys.
00:11:00.698 - 00:11:35.594, Speaker A: I see, right. And that's an important distinction. However, there could be a bug in a smart contract wallet. There could be an issue with that smart contract wallet. It introduces some additional code complexity in the process. So that's the first question I'd have for you, how can we get comfortable around that? The second is it does, at first glance, feel kind of squishy to start trusting, meet space social relationships with this sort of thing. Like people are probably thinking as they're hearing you talk.
00:11:35.594 - 00:11:50.830, Speaker A: Okay, who are the five to seven people in my life that I would actually trust with something like this? And how much do I actually trust those relationships? Can you talk about both of those, I guess, security vectors?
00:11:52.310 - 00:12:22.102, Speaker B: Right. So good. Important question. So I think as far as security of smart contract wallets goes, one important thing to keep in mind is that I think that the security of the code needed to implement this recovery mechanism is very small. Right. It's maybe even just something like ten lines of code. And the reason is that you can already abstract out the multisig part into a separate mechanism.
00:12:22.102 - 00:13:12.060, Speaker B: Right. And we've already had multisig wallets that work for years. There's the multisig wallet that stores the $600 million, or whatever it is, of the ethereum foundation's money. There's the more recent gnosis safe wallet that stores lots of projects money, and it's been formally verified and audited many times, so that's been increasingly trusted by the community. And so the majority of the code is something that you can just delegate to a multi sig wallet, and that's already been tested. And then the rest of it, it is something that would need to be written, and it is something that would need to be audited and verified. But it is a relatively small kind of 30 line of code job, relatively speaking, and not some really complicated thing.
00:13:12.060 - 00:13:45.070, Speaker B: So that's one thing to answer. The other thing to keep in mind is that I'll talk about this a bit further down. But realistically, all of this stuff is going to happen inside of roll ups, and I can even expect roll up projects to just incorporate some form of multisig or social recovery wallet just natively, and I think they should do that. I think the move to roll ups is a great time to start moving people onto these more secure paradigms.
00:13:45.230 - 00:14:28.430, Speaker D: Gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange. I've been a customer of Gemini since I first got back into crypto back in 2017, and it has been my main exchange of choice to make. My crypto buys and sells. Gemini is available in all 50 states, in over 50 countries worldwide. And on Gemini, there are markets for over 30 various crypto assets, including many of the hot DFI tokens like Wifi, Ave, Uni, and also, they are one of the few exchanges that has liquid dye markets. Having both the option of logging into the Gemini.com website or instead opening the Gemini mobile app has allowed me to be able to access any and all exchange and on or off ramp services that I've needed to on a moment's notice.
00:14:28.430 - 00:15:18.782, Speaker D: With instant deposits and fast withdrawals, I'm able to make my money do the things I want it to, when I want it to. You can buy crypto safely and securely on Gemini with the peace of mind of knowing that your investments are insured and protected. With industryleading cybersecurity, you can open up a free account in under 3 minutes@gemini.com. Gobankless and if you trade more than $100 within the first 30 days after sign up, you'll be gifted a free $15 bonus. Check them out Gemini.com gobankless if you want to live a bankless life, you need to get a monolith Defi Visa card. Monolith is a one two punch of both an Ethereum smart contract wallet and an accompanying Visa card that lets you spend the money that you have in your Ethereum wallet everywhere where Visa is accepted.
00:15:18.782 - 00:16:09.540, Speaker D: When you swipe your monolith Visa card at the grocery store or at a restaurant, it actually makes a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain that spends some of the money you hold in your monolith wallet. It's insanely cool, and it's one of the best tools out there for living a bankless but still normal life. Monolith also offers on ramp services for getting your fiat money into the world of defi, so it's trivial to top up your monolith card if you ever need to, and your deposited money goes straight into your non custodial wallet. So your money is never held by a centralized intermediary. Because monolith is native ethereum infrastructure, the money you hold in your monolith wallet still has the power of defi behind it. Swapping assets on uniswap or earning yield in defi is at your fingertips. Go to monolith XYZ and sign up to get your monolith visa card today.
00:16:09.990 - 00:17:58.120, Speaker B: And then in terms of the question of do you trust your social relations, I have a paragraph a bit further down, right, where I basically say that there's this really nice security thing that you can do, which is that your guardians, number one, they don't have to be publicly known, and number two, they don't even need to know each other's identities, right? So like you for example, could use as your guardians, your mom, if you work for a company, your boss, then some institution, some friend from high school, and you want to use guardians from different social circles that you have, right? You want to have guardians that ideally do not even know each, or at the very least don't closely talk to each other. And basically the reason why this can be accomplished, right, is because either you don't need to publish guardians addresses on chain until you actually do a recovery, or even more securely, you can just have each guardian generate a new single purpose address that they would use for each wallet that they're guarding. I mentioned it's recommended to choose a diverse collection of guardians from different social circles. One institutional guardian would be nice, though there are privacy reasons why you might not want to do that either. And this basically would just make it very hard for these different guardians to collude, right? So for like for you, Orion, if you become a guardian for David, then how the hell would you even start figuring out who of David's other contacts you're going to collude with to steal all this money?
00:17:59.530 - 00:18:04.070, Speaker A: That's a good question. I'm thinking about that now. Vitalik, who indeed?
00:18:05.050 - 00:18:21.180, Speaker B: Question one, do you even know? And question two, once you start poking around and asking what's the probability that you're going to get up to four or seven before one of these people rats you out to David, and David just switches over his guardians to someone else and cuts off contact with you?
00:18:21.730 - 00:18:38.338, Speaker A: Yeah, that's probably pretty accurate. And considering David and I have never met in real life, though we have spent hours upon hours in digital life together, means I don't actually know some of his IRL relationships and friends and family.
00:18:38.424 - 00:18:40.100, Speaker C: And it's going to stay that way.
00:18:43.830 - 00:18:49.714, Speaker A: Yeah. So, Vitalik, do you think this kind of solves private key management? Or this could solve private key management?
00:18:49.762 - 00:19:02.714, Speaker B: Basically, I think it's the best solution that we have right now. I think it would be great for the ecosystem if we can make a kind of strong push toward implementing this kind of technology.
00:19:02.912 - 00:19:45.590, Speaker A: And we do have some of this today with Argent is one definitely bankless listeners will be familiar with loop ring you mentioned is another. So there are attempts with it right now. And you mentioned, I think earlier in our discussion that you tried to do a recovery with Argent just to sort of test that out. And it was pretty expensive. There's like a $50 gas fee associated with it. So maybe we could just tie this off with what you're talking about earlier, is migration to L2 and roll ups can kind of solve the remaining challenges. So you said some roll up solutions might even be able to have to ship basically a social recovery wallet right out of the box, which be super cool.
00:19:45.590 - 00:20:02.510, Speaker A: It sounds like roll ups have the capacity to innovate faster and try new things that the main chain really doesn't have that capability. But what did you have in mind about this intersection of synergy between L2 and social recovery wallets?
00:20:03.330 - 00:20:24.066, Speaker B: Yes. So there's, I think, a couple of problems that roll ups solve at the same time. So one of them is that ethereum has this very subtle technical weakness, which is the fact that only externally owned accounts can initiate transactions. And that was just.
00:20:24.168 - 00:20:27.650, Speaker C: Sorry, could you define externally owned accounts for our listeners?
00:20:28.150 - 00:20:35.618, Speaker B: Yes. It is an account which is controlled by a private key. If an account that's not an externally owned account is a smart contract.
00:20:35.714 - 00:20:42.310, Speaker C: So there's only two types of accounts. There's accounts, the addresses with private keys, and then there are addresses that are smart contracts.
00:20:42.470 - 00:20:56.474, Speaker B: Correct. Cool. And only eoas can initiate transactions. There's no ways to initiate a transaction from a smart contract. So this creates problems. Right. And actually, no.
00:20:56.474 - 00:20:58.830, Speaker B: Have either of you used the tornado cache before?
00:20:58.980 - 00:21:00.366, Speaker C: I have, yes.
00:21:00.548 - 00:21:47.050, Speaker B: Okay, so you remember how when you do a withdrawal from tornado cash, you have to select a relayer and you're not signing a transaction, you're like, signing a message, or actually, I think you're not even signing the message. You're just, like, providing the note and someone else sends the transaction. Right. So the reason why that happens is because what's happening in a tornado cash flow straw is that you're trying to withdraw money in zero knowledge to a completely new address. And so you do not already have funds in that address. So you have no way of paying the transaction fees from an EOA, and the money you're trying to withdraw is coming from a contract. And so the transaction has to start from some Eoa, and that EOa has to be provided by a third party.
00:21:47.050 - 00:22:14.694, Speaker B: And the relayer is that third party. They just do this as a service in exchange for a fee. Now, this is inefficient, and it added significant complexity to tornado cash, and it also adds significant complexity to smart contract wallets. I think it might be the biggest ux barrier that smart contract wallets have, and a big reason we don't have more of them is argent. They basically run their own relayer. Right, and loop ring. Well, they're a roll up of.
00:22:14.694 - 00:23:01.080, Speaker B: So they're kind of part of the solution here. And I'm definitely hoping that Argent is going to start doing things with roll up soon. But if you have any of these wallets, that's a smart contract that's not on L2, then either you need a relayer or you need this kind of somewhat bulky scheme where you need an account that has most of your assets and then an account that has the rest of your assets to pay fees. And that account has to have quite a bit of eth just in case transaction fees get very high. And so it just gets annoying. So there's two ways of solving this problem. One of them is a kind of decentralized general purpose relayer network, and the gas station network is doing a great job of this.
00:23:01.080 - 00:23:50.966, Speaker B: But the other thing is that you can just move to roll ups, and roll ups can just have better support for just allowing transactions to start from smart contracts directly. So that's the first problem. And then the second problem is the high transaction fees. Right. You can't have roll up recoveries cost $50, but in a lawyer two system, if everything is done inside of a lawyer two recoveries could potentially only cost a few cents. In general, I think the move to L2 is this great opportunity to just do lots of things in a way that's just much better than what we've been doing before. Smart contracts by default are a great example of this optimism, have already kind of taken some steps in this direction, which is nice.
00:23:50.966 - 00:24:11.740, Speaker B: I think every account in optimism is by default a simple smart contract wallet that the user, if they want to, can replace with a different one. Yeah, there's an excellent synergy between lawyer twos and better security.
00:24:13.650 - 00:24:14.734, Speaker C: Sorry, go ahead.
00:24:14.852 - 00:24:22.270, Speaker B: I just wanted to say I do also want to at some point circle back to kind of the relationship between social recovery and crypto values.
00:24:23.490 - 00:24:38.310, Speaker C: Maybe that's where we can tie this conversation off. But before we get there, I do want to ask, does that mean that you believe that the trend for the average individual who engages with Ethereum is going to move towards L2 smart contract wallets?
00:24:39.210 - 00:24:39.960, Speaker B: Yes.
00:24:40.490 - 00:24:59.738, Speaker C: Interesting. And people will just perhaps be able to execute l one transactions from their L2 smart contract wallet by proxy. So they'll make a transaction with their smart contract wallet. And if they want something to happen on chain on the ethereum l one, it can be initiated from that point. Interesting.
00:24:59.824 - 00:25:43.340, Speaker B: Right. Well, so we have to distinguish between layer one smart contract wallets that are on layer one versus smart contract wallets that are inside roll ups. Right. So I think smart contract wallets are better either way, but they're definitely much better inside roll ups. And I definitely expect more and more of people to be kind of, over time, to move toward being inside roll ups natively. So just being able to do lots of things and just do all of the ethereuming that they want to do just by floating between optimism and arbitram and Zksync and loop ring. And I think we're going to have better and better techniques for moving between those systems without having to hop onto the main chain first.
00:25:43.340 - 00:25:52.302, Speaker B: And that will also reduce transaction fees massively, which will give an opportunity for this social recovery stuff to happen better.
00:25:52.436 - 00:26:03.760, Speaker A: David, our kids may not even use the main chain. That's what Vitalik is saying, right? Like they might live their whole dfi ethereum life on a L2 chain completely.
00:26:05.410 - 00:26:48.880, Speaker C: Well, that kind of begs the question, say I have a smart contract wallet on the l two, and I'm there because of just all the Ux benefits that it provides me. And I want to swap tokens for one token for another because of whatever reasons that people do that. And the uniswap l one is perhaps not necessary, because on loop ring there is another amm that because perhaps I'm on the loop ring and l two, I just use that exchange feature there instead. So then at that point, if all the economic activity is kind of put into l two s, what does the l one do? What kind of economic activity would you expect to see on the main ethereum l one, if that becomes the case?
00:26:49.730 - 00:27:23.558, Speaker B: In the short to medium term, I expect high value users to stay on l one just because they can afford to pay the fees. And the fees are a lower cost than the risk that people perceive of l two is breaking. But in the longer term, the risk of l two is breaking is going to subside. And in which case, l ones are mainly going to consist of L2s publishing these batches and proofs, and users moving between roll ups in some cases.
00:27:23.734 - 00:28:22.438, Speaker C: That's extremely interesting. That kind of makes my head turn to the whole scaling metaphor of Xbox games, where people, or Xbox games when the Xbox first came out, were like kind of, the graphics were rudimentary, very basic. But then Xbox games towards the end of the Xbox lifecycle, and I'm specifically talking about the Xbox 360 here, like the big Xbox that took off the most amount of time, games towards the end of the Xbox 360 lifestyle were far more efficient, far more graphically beautiful and complex and rich. But yet it was the same hardware. It was the same hardware all through and through. And that seems to be kind of how what you are alluding to with the Ethereum l one, over time, is that we are actually just making better use of the same computational capacity that Ethereum offers. Is that kind of where you're getting at? And then my other question is Ethereum, of course, is a place of legos.
00:28:22.438 - 00:28:41.810, Speaker C: We have different things, different applications that we can plug into each other. What we're talking about here is the Lego between a smart contract wall and an l, two, talking about the efficiencies and Ux benefits that we get there. What about the Lego of decentralized identity? How does the combination of decentralized identity and smart contract wallets, how do those things interact?
00:28:43.670 - 00:29:30.702, Speaker B: I guess, good question. I've talked about identity in a lot of different contexts. I guess the question is there's different kinds of identity, right? Like there's identity of you just authenticating yourself as being the same actor who did some other interaction previously, which is just like maintaining a persistent account. There's identity as in proving things about who you are in the real world. There is identity as in kind of the unique human problem, creating accounts that each person can only have one of. And they are kind of different primitives that have somewhat different properties. So I view social recovery wallets as being a big step forward for the first kind of identity.
00:29:30.702 - 00:31:06.766, Speaker B: This kind of maintaining some kind of persistent thing that you can represent yourself as to services and other people. And as I mentioned before, this is something that could potentially end up kind of going, even being used for just centralized web two services, right? Like right now, if you log into many services, a lot of the time you're logging in with Google or you're logging in with Twitter or logging in with Facebook, and you're basically using an identity that's controlled by Google or Twitter or Facebook as the mechanism by which you interact with all of these services. But here, the thing that I think could eventually happen is people using blockchain social recovery wallets or wallets with some kind of other recovery mechanism of their choice as that identity. Ultimately, if we can create something that's as secure in terms of antitheft and anti loss properties as centralized services provide, which I think we can, because I think people overrate how good these centralized services are anyway, then we can create something that makes sense for even people to use to just interact with all of these other things too, I guess. Yes, this stuff is a strong path towards solving at least one of the problems that we put in the identity bucket, as always.
00:31:06.868 - 00:31:18.114, Speaker A: Want to end with this none of this was financial advice. Of course. Eth is risky. So is defi, so is crypto. You could lose what you put it in. But we are headed west. This is the frontier.
00:31:18.114 - 00:31:23.890, Speaker A: It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot. Bye.
