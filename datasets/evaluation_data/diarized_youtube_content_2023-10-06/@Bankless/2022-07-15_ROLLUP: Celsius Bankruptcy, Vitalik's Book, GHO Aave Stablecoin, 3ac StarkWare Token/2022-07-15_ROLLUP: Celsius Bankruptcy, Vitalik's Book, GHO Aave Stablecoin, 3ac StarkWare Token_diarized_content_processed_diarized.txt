00:00:00.090 - 00:00:11.486, Speaker A: Like we need local, at home, decentralized, sustainable agriculture, food production, which Ryan is. Veggies and meat. Veggies and meat. I have opinions on this thing.
00:00:11.508 - 00:00:28.194, Speaker B: All right, David, doing a nutrition podcast is just about the most bear market thing I can think of right now. Hey, bankless nation, it is time for the weekly roll up. Happy third week of July. I hope you have your morning coffee. David, you drinking a morning coffee?
00:00:28.242 - 00:00:31.878, Speaker A: Oh, two every single day. Yeah, absolutely. We never miss it.
00:00:31.964 - 00:00:33.094, Speaker B: No carbs in coffee, right?
00:00:33.132 - 00:00:41.046, Speaker A: Oh, absolutely. No black coffee. As soon as you put anything into coffee, sugar, milk, anything, it becomes a beverage. It's no longer coffee.
00:00:41.158 - 00:00:55.150, Speaker B: Wow, dude, these takes. Yeah, anti carb maximalism here. I don't know if we're going to stand for it. We're not talking nutrition today, though. I know you want to start another podcast, but the topics of the week are crypto. David, what are we going to cover on the roll up today?
00:00:55.220 - 00:01:16.082, Speaker A: Celsius files for bankruptcy after paying off its defi loans. Important, very important order of operations there. So we're going to cover that Suzu of three arrows capital leaks, the starknet token. And then the next day, Starknet announces a token. Go figure. Thanks, dude. We're going to cover all of that.
00:01:16.082 - 00:01:27.666, Speaker A: Both like why he leaked the Starknet token and all the starknet token details. Also, Vitalik writing a book coming out on Amazon called proof of stake. Do you have it pre ordered, Ryan?
00:01:27.858 - 00:01:29.782, Speaker B: I did pre order that, yeah, just last week.
00:01:29.836 - 00:01:35.738, Speaker A: And then Ave doing a stablecoin gho for goats. The go stablecoin. Cool.
00:01:35.904 - 00:01:56.734, Speaker B: A lot happening in crypto. Of course we're going to talk about markets in just a second. Of course, if you like the roll up, if you like the bankless podcast, if you appreciate what we are doing here, if you want to spread the word, make sure you like and subscribe, give us a review. If you are viewing this pod, listening to this podcast in your podcast player too, Spotify Apple, if you will. This comes out every Friday, of course.
00:01:56.772 - 00:02:00.530, Speaker A: Also something new on Spotify. We actually have video on Spotify now. Right?
00:02:00.600 - 00:02:01.474, Speaker B: I was just going to say that.
00:02:01.512 - 00:02:07.890, Speaker A: Yeah. So if you are on Spotify and you also want to see mine and Ryan's faces, that option is available to you.
00:02:08.040 - 00:02:20.022, Speaker B: Yeah, it's great. I actually started seeing that on the Lex Friedman podcast the first time on Spotify. I saw Spotify video and I kind of like it. It gives us another avenue for distribution of the video beyond YouTube so we get some redundancy there.
00:02:20.156 - 00:02:31.770, Speaker A: YouTube is the only place that we have our video. Well, not anymore because of Spotify, but it's kind of crazy to think about, like, oh, well, we put out the podcast everywhere, but YouTube's the only place that gets the video.
00:02:31.920 - 00:02:34.574, Speaker B: And do you remember that one time YouTube kicked our channel off?
00:02:34.612 - 00:02:38.170, Speaker A: Yeah. Do you remember that one time the YouTube CEO apologized for kicking us off YouTube?
00:02:38.330 - 00:02:57.390, Speaker B: That was pretty cool. Can't believe that happened. That was this year, right? One thing you need to do, though, is go check out Juno. Juno is sponsoring this message. I really like what Juno is doing. This is a crypto native bank account. Of course I have a bank account, David.
00:02:57.390 - 00:03:03.234, Speaker B: Like, full confession. I know you do too. We have fiat bills that we have to pay, but my bank account is crappy.
00:03:03.282 - 00:03:04.246, Speaker A: Sadly, not that I would pay.
00:03:04.268 - 00:03:22.314, Speaker B: Yeah, sadly, maybe someday. But my bank account, I bank at Wells Fargo. Like, true story. It sucks. I can't do anything in crypto inside of my fiat bank account. And that is why if you have a bank account, you also need a crypto native bank account. What features does Juno bring to the table, David?
00:03:22.362 - 00:03:57.826, Speaker A: Yeah, so your Juno checking account can turn into your token on Polygon in, like, one click, five minutes or less. And so my also bank at Wells Fargo. That's why we pick on Wells Fargo all the time. It goes from Wells Fargo to my Gemini to swap to ether to then into my crypto wallet. On Juno, it goes from your checking account to ether on your preferred layer two of choice, polygon, optimism, arbitrum, Zksync, and Starkware. Coming soon in one click. Right? And so we're just cutting out 30 minutes and 17 button presses, and you probably have to reset your password anyways.
00:03:57.826 - 00:04:13.046, Speaker A: And so that's super awesome. Like, checking account to layer two. Crazy. 6% on your USDC if you want that. That's an opt in thing. 3% on bitcoin and ether. But then also, if you sign up, if you get a direct deposit, which also can be turned into crypto.
00:04:13.046 - 00:04:40.898, Speaker A: So you go from your employer paycheck to crypto to a layer two, all inside of one app, which is awesome. But direct deposit gets turned into crypto. And if you sign up and get your direct deposit, they will pay you $100. And if you deposit crypto on the crypto side, they'll pay you $10. So there is a link in the show notes to sign up for Anjuno. This is the new era of banks. We're going to have banks for a while, sadly, but we do want the good ones to have cool crypto native features that allows you to leave your bank easier.
00:04:40.994 - 00:04:50.982, Speaker B: If you so choose another step to going bankless, click the link in the show notes. That's bankless. Cc Juno to find that out. David, let's get to markets. What's bitcoin doing this week, my friend?
00:04:51.036 - 00:05:00.218, Speaker A: Yeah, bitcoin. A little bit down on the week. Started the week at $20,400. Oh, it's gone up since I wrote down these prices. Crazy. Okay, so crypto markets, they move.
00:05:00.304 - 00:05:01.194, Speaker B: Not that much, though.
00:05:01.232 - 00:05:11.070, Speaker A: Not that much. Don't get too excited. So down from 20,400 up to. Down to 20,150. So, like down 1% ish, one and a half percent.
00:05:11.220 - 00:05:12.282, Speaker B: And how about eth?
00:05:12.346 - 00:05:27.742, Speaker A: Ether started the week at 1185, currently at 1115. So down about. What is that? I have to redo these numbers because when I wrote these numbers, it was 1080, not 1115. So, like rough 6%, down 6%. Call it quick math.
00:05:27.806 - 00:05:34.742, Speaker B: Yeah. As of now. As of now, when you listen to this on Friday morning, it'll be completely different. So none of what David said, actually.
00:05:34.796 - 00:05:36.118, Speaker A: Why do we even do this?
00:05:36.284 - 00:05:37.270, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:05:37.420 - 00:05:38.710, Speaker A: Why do we even tell you price?
00:05:38.780 - 00:05:57.706, Speaker B: You know, it's just going to change. But we're looking at trends over time, David, and the trend is down bad. But there was also some interesting inflation news, and crypto is not responding as negatively to that recent inflation news as it could have. So maybe there's a silver lining there. We'll get to some of that later. But what about the ratio, David?
00:05:57.738 - 00:06:02.826, Speaker A: Ratio flat on the week 55, it's.
00:06:02.858 - 00:06:12.322, Speaker B: Not telling us anything. It's telling us everything. Market doesn't know what to do right now. Global cryptocurrency, total market cap, we are under a trillion dollars. What are we headed at today?
00:06:12.376 - 00:06:19.586, Speaker A: Yeah, last week we were up to 976,000,000,000. This week we're down to 929,000,000,000.
00:06:19.778 - 00:06:38.186, Speaker B: The good news is we get to celebrate that 1 trillion yet again and probably get back down again. Repeat, what is the point of looking at any of these prices? How about Ethereum? Gas prices not doing too bad there. I mean, they're down as well. So if you're trying to get a transaction through, it's a good time to do that.
00:06:38.208 - 00:06:43.440, Speaker A: D five. What are we looking at cheap right now? I think the average gray price in last week was like 20 something.
00:06:44.770 - 00:06:47.406, Speaker B: You doing anything new on Ethereum is.
00:06:47.428 - 00:07:01.170, Speaker A: Like all the cheap, all the cheap gas transactions. I'm not doing too much? No, that's reflected in the usage charts. Like, the usage charts are generally down. Except I was looking at the usage charts. You know, the usage chart that's actually up in terms of usage and volume.
00:07:01.910 - 00:07:25.722, Speaker B: USDC, stablecoins, I was going to say the transactions I actually did on Ethereum this week were all like withdrawals and deposits and like stablecoin stuff. I was like, oh, it's nice. I only have to pay like a dollar for that. Usually it's like five, something like this. All right, well, let's talk about the big macro story, which continues to be inflation. David, new numbers came in this week and they were the worst in 41 years.
00:07:25.776 - 00:07:27.450, Speaker A: They were higher us last month.
00:07:27.600 - 00:07:46.738, Speaker B: Yeah, us inflation just hit a four decade high of 9.1%. That is the headline in the Wall Street Journal. We should break this down a little bit. But first, here's the chart. Look how bad it is. 9.1% inflation just shooting up like a rocket in 2022.
00:07:46.738 - 00:07:53.454, Speaker B: And then from a category perspective, what are the big contributing categories? David?
00:07:53.502 - 00:08:12.938, Speaker A: Yeah, energy is obviously the big one. So the biggest ones are fuel oil. In the last year has doubled. Gasoline has gone up 60%. Gas utilities up 38%, electricity up 14%. So those are the biggest ones, and they're all energy related. The next one after that is food, like groceries, up 12%, which is also a proxy of energy.
00:08:12.938 - 00:08:42.290, Speaker A: And then new cars is like the first non food, non energy one, which is up 12%. Overall CPI up 9.1%. I heard this really awesome illustration for energy. Why do people pay attention to energy so much? In the global macro? Space, energy is like nature's interest rate is the cost of doing things. If you need to move yourself any further than where you can walk, you have to consume energy. Elevators take energy. Escalators take energy.
00:08:42.290 - 00:09:01.346, Speaker A: Cars, energy trains, energy. Buses, planes, those things also move all of the things that people need, like food. And so when energy prices goes up, the cost of existing also goes up, which makes the world a harder place to exist in as it goes in. So this is why everyone's concerned.
00:09:01.538 - 00:09:04.354, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like a transaction fee for real life, right?
00:09:04.412 - 00:09:04.826, Speaker A: Yes.
00:09:04.928 - 00:09:29.150, Speaker B: I guess that's why they call it gas. On Ethereum, it is really the analog. If you want to do anything in the metaverse on Ethereum, you have to pay gas. You want to do anything in real life, it's going to come at you through the price of energy and fuel costs. David, we are also looking at the DXY, which is this is basically us dollars, the ratio of us dollars to primarily the yen, japanese yen, and the euro?
00:09:29.310 - 00:09:31.922, Speaker A: Yeah, I think both of those. The euro is a dominant one, but.
00:09:31.976 - 00:09:33.182, Speaker B: It'S a bad dominant currencies.
00:09:33.246 - 00:09:35.710, Speaker A: I think the euro is the biggest one, followed by the yen.
00:09:35.790 - 00:09:37.762, Speaker B: And what's the story with the DXY? What's it doing?
00:09:37.816 - 00:10:22.510, Speaker A: Yeah, we are hitting also a very long time high, all time high for a while. I think the last time it was this high was something like 2001 or 2002 or something. 109 is the index for record. Let's see, the most recent high was like 102 back in 2017, also when they were raising interest rates most recently. But then Covid hit and it dumps. When the dollar is high, everything else is low by comparison. And so when you see this dollar index and you're seeing that go through the moon, all assets have suffered because that's the dollar going up versus, well, not all assets is this basket of currencies, but, like, strength in the dollar, right? Everyone's going to France for ECC in a little bit, myself included.
00:10:22.510 - 00:10:27.474, Speaker A: And all of a sudden, my fiat dollars are going to buy me some extra breakfast.
00:10:27.602 - 00:10:30.470, Speaker B: Did you see, David? Euros in the dollar are at parity.
00:10:31.210 - 00:10:43.610, Speaker A: Down below parity. It's like 90 below parity. €1 is $1.99. Wait, 1.1 cent is now €1? No, wait, the inverse. Damn it. I'm so bad at math.
00:10:43.610 - 00:10:47.126, Speaker A: Anyways, the dollar is stronger than the euro.
00:10:47.318 - 00:10:59.322, Speaker B: Yes. So earlier in the week, I made the joke that circle is just releasing a new stablecoin, the euro stablecoin. It's called USDC. Kind of funny.
00:10:59.386 - 00:11:01.566, Speaker A: Kind of funny, but also like, I.
00:11:01.588 - 00:11:27.734, Speaker B: Mean, if you're a european holding euros, not that funny. And I don't know how long this is going to persist for, but our episode coming out with Luke Groman is fantastic for answering this question about dollar strength and why it is strong. Doing a lot of macro content. Recently, I've really been enjoying and learning a lot. But how did the market react? Yes, so do I. How did the market react to all of this? You've got a meme for us.
00:11:27.772 - 00:11:38.246, Speaker A: Yeah, I thought this was a great tweet. So, Northman Trader, good Twitter account says today markets sold off on a hot CPI frame, right? Because if CPI is high, that means, like, oh, no, like, the Fed's going to raise interest rates.
00:11:38.278 - 00:11:38.534, Speaker B: Scary.
00:11:38.582 - 00:12:03.490, Speaker A: That means risk on assets going to get plummeted even more. So. Northman trader says today markets sold off on a hot CPI print as it implies more aggressive rate hikes by the Fed. But then stocks rallied, realizing that this would result in a recession sooner, implying rate cuts earlier than expected before dropping again, realizing that a recession would come first. Basically like, hello, volatility, hello, uncertainty. We don't know what happens next. And just like, people are confused.
00:12:04.790 - 00:12:07.246, Speaker B: Hello, this face. This is the face that investors should.
00:12:07.288 - 00:12:11.414, Speaker A: Podcast listeners don't have to look at that face of that dog, but you should.
00:12:11.532 - 00:12:45.802, Speaker B: This is why you should watch on Spotify right now. You know, a question I've said that I've had in the roll up for the last couple of weeks about macro markets. Well, I feel like I finally got my answer. The question was, I was mystified why some people in macro are saying the Fed should just raise rates to four to 5%, like, we need that immediately. And other people are saying, no, if the fed raises to four to 5%, it breaks everything. The US goes insolvent, can no longer pay its interest payments. I was trying to understand why there's a difference of opinion.
00:12:45.802 - 00:13:28.814, Speaker B: And here's one thing I concluded in our episode with Lyn Alden, our episode with Luke Groman, that things are different. They're much different than the 1970s and Paul Volcker, where we could just increase interest rates. And the big difference is we are at the end of a long term debt cycle. We have a massive amount of debt now in the modern nations, modern economy, the US, Europe, Japan, China, all around the world. And so I tweet this out, we're at the end of a long term debt cycle, and the only way to deleverage is to hold interest rates below inflation for most of this decade. Inflation is not politically tenable. So Powell must play the idiot by pretending to fix inflation while simultaneously pursuing it.
00:13:28.814 - 00:13:31.546, Speaker B: That actually might explain some of the actions of Powell.
00:13:31.578 - 00:13:35.520, Speaker A: Right. I thought that was a really good and very nuanced well done.
00:13:36.210 - 00:14:17.886, Speaker B: This is kind of what I gleaned from our Luke Robman episode is just kind of, everyone's like, what the hell? Does Powell not know what he's doing? Maybe he knows what he's doing. Maybe he has to play the role of an actor, play the role of an idiot. Because the only way out of this, when you have wartime debt, debt levels, then you kind of get wartime inflation on the other side of this. And this is, to Lynn Alden's point, very much like the way the 1940s played out, where for that entire decade, you had about 6% inflation while interest rates were at 0%. So the delta was 6%. In some years you had 19%. That is basically the way out of this.
00:14:17.988 - 00:14:55.046, Speaker A: And Lynn Alden said this, too. She said, what does the Fed know versus what does the Fed know and not aren't telling us? So this is just a game of game theory. It's just like, all right, what are we going to portray to the markets that we're going to do? And what do the markets think that we're going to do? And so it's a game of game theory between the markets and the Fed. And so how smart is the Fed? And if they're just playing dumb, like, oh, yeah, we're going to raise interest rates as long as CPI goes higher, and then the CPI goes higher and the market just crashes on the CPI. High CPI. Print the game theory worked in favor of the Fed like it did the thing that they wanted to do without actually raising interest rates.
00:14:55.238 - 00:14:58.540, Speaker B: Yeah. And they know the only way out is through high.
00:15:00.030 - 00:15:02.170, Speaker A: We don't actually know what they know. Ryan.
00:15:02.670 - 00:15:07.790, Speaker B: The other alternative is this, or Jerem Powell is an actual idiot and we're all screwed.
00:15:08.210 - 00:15:11.278, Speaker A: I don't know. Uncertain, which is true.
00:15:11.364 - 00:15:14.590, Speaker B: I guess we get to find out. Man, the 2020s are fun.
00:15:14.660 - 00:15:46.490, Speaker A: This is great game theory with all of our economic lives. Demetri Kofinius that we've had on the podcast before, I also thought that gave a really useful take. He says, I've been saying this for months. The Federal reserve exists within a political system, and that system is currently fighting a proxy war with Russia and increasingly China. Policymakers are aware of that. A rising dollar creates leverage in that war. When you are a nation state with a currency and that currency is strong, you have more ammo to shoot with, as in when you print money and that money is stronger, you can do more things with that money.
00:15:46.490 - 00:16:04.206, Speaker A: And so I thought this was a really good take. Like, we need a high dollar so that we can fight our actual kinetic war with Russia as a proxy and then our economic war with China. So a rising dollar is like in the is interest of the incumbent political establishment of the United States.
00:16:04.308 - 00:16:13.166, Speaker B: Do you know, David, I just realized we need to do an episode on this macro episode, the weaponization of the dollar. I want to dive into this in more depth.
00:16:13.198 - 00:16:21.186, Speaker A: I mean, I was just thinking, I have Dimitri back on. I'm sure he says he's going to do this, so maybe we'll let him do this and then we'll just invite him on and he can tell us what he learned.
00:16:21.298 - 00:16:43.482, Speaker B: He does the hard work and then we snatch it correctly. Thanks, Dimitri. Love you, man. What else, David, as we're talking about inflation, just run some of the math here on gains. If you're thinking about your portfolio, where to store your value. Of course, if you have it in a savings account, a dollar in a savings account, it goes down 9% every year. Terrible place to hold value.
00:16:43.482 - 00:17:16.310, Speaker B: So what do you do? Do you invest it? Well, everything's going down, so you got to be careful. The asset class. But Ryan Peterson makes this point with a 9.1% inflation, if your portfolio makes less than 12% per year, the IRS takes 100% of your real dollar returns. The tax optimizer is here to remind you there's still taxes, too. And so even a 12% return, you're actually making zero in terms of real returns. Nominal returns maybe, but zero in terms of real returns because you got to pay 30% of that at least to the IRS.
00:17:16.650 - 00:17:20.280, Speaker A: Where does anyone make money less than 12% this year? I'll tell you that.
00:17:20.650 - 00:17:26.294, Speaker B: Yeah, it's probably in the negative. Well, that means you don't have to pay any taxes, David, there's your silver lining.
00:17:26.422 - 00:17:46.426, Speaker A: You can't pay tax if you aren't making money. Here's Arthur Hayes, and he says, must watch the JPY and the euro, the japanese yen and the euro. Expect an intervention to weaken if the USD. To weaken the USD. If Japan is greater than 150 and the euro is greater than $0.90 on the dollar, intervention means. Fred, money printing.
00:17:46.426 - 00:17:57.090, Speaker A: Printing money means bitcoin number go up. The situation is fluid. So this is what I'm seeing. More and more is more, and people are seeing like there's a path forward that seems not implausible, where the money printer gets turned on again.
00:17:57.240 - 00:18:22.758, Speaker B: Yeah, I think, and this is also to pump our Luke Groman episode on Monday. Go listen to that episode. What he talks about is basically a very likely way forward, is that the Fed is going to start having to bail out Japan and Europe. Its allies do that in various ways by probably purchasing bonds. And so watch out for that. And I guess that's good for crypto. I don't know what it means for the rest of the world, but it's good for a scarce commodity asset.
00:18:22.854 - 00:18:36.430, Speaker A: The take here is that in times like these, the economy is now under the whim of politics. The economy used to be a free market. It's no longer a free market. It's going to do the thing that the political institutions want it to do.
00:18:36.580 - 00:18:47.426, Speaker B: Yeah, which is exactly why we need to do more on geopolitics here, David, to understand this. All right, what's happening in the crypto world? Getting out of the inflation conversation. This is a stat about miners new.
00:18:47.448 - 00:19:09.958, Speaker A: All time high set by miners selling bitcoin. A net of 88,000 bitcoins were sent to exchanges from miners, a new all time high. So I guess that doesn't mean actually sold. Miners sent it to an exchange, but miners don't. The implication, miners don't buy bitcoin. They mint bitcoin. And so a net outflow from miners to exchanges was hit at an all time high yesterday.
00:19:10.134 - 00:19:12.294, Speaker B: Why do you think this is happening? Are they just trying to cover costs?
00:19:12.342 - 00:19:20.826, Speaker A: Yeah, they got to protect themselves from further downside, because if bitcoin goes down, like another 50%, a bunch of miners go underwater. So they also have to hunker down for the winter.
00:19:20.938 - 00:19:33.726, Speaker B: Like, miners are a massively resource intensive kind of industry, right? It's like all the energy costs, but also all the hardware costs. What is this take about? Treasury value of defi protocols.
00:19:33.758 - 00:19:53.866, Speaker A: Yeah. So Hazu had a really good take on this a while ago where treasuries that count their own native token as their treasury. You shouldn't be doing that because you can mint your token as much as you want anyway. So it doesn't really count, but for some reason we do it. So anyways, the treasury of Ave at the peak was $1.8 billion. Today it is $101,000,000.
00:19:53.866 - 00:20:02.074, Speaker A: Uniswap at the peak, $4.8 billion. Now it's $1.3 billion. Index peak $105,000,000. Now it's $4 million.
00:20:02.192 - 00:20:03.260, Speaker B: 4 million.
00:20:03.870 - 00:20:21.700, Speaker A: So, like, these treasuries, which are held largely held in the native tokens, but other defi tokens as well are all down bad. And so hazard was ringing the alarm about this. It's like, you guys need to diversify your treasuries at the peak, not at the bottom, or else you'll be in trouble. And no one really seemed to do that.
00:20:22.710 - 00:20:36.902, Speaker B: I think very few took his advice. But that's a great point. It's like if you look at Apple's balance sheet and you're like, how much cash on hand do you have? Apple? They're not going to count all of the apple shares that they could potentially mint or they might have in reserve somewhere, they're going to tell you, I have actual money.
00:20:36.956 - 00:20:38.578, Speaker A: Infinity money. Treasury?
00:20:38.754 - 00:20:59.982, Speaker B: Yeah. How much bitcoin do you have? How much eth do you have? How much stablecoins do you have? That is your treasury if you're a dao. And I think we're learning that lesson. Real money. David, what is this? This is kind of the lido liquid staking balance as compared to all of the other liquid eth staking tokens out there. And what are we seeing here?
00:21:00.036 - 00:21:20.374, Speaker A: Yeah, so the concern of Lido centralization has been pretty big for a while. And you can see it's showing up here in the numbers 4.1 million. Ether is staked with lido. Which of the liquid staking services the people that have a liquid staking derivative like lido has staked ETH. Rocket pool has our ETH. Lido's got 90.6%
00:21:20.374 - 00:21:42.910, Speaker A: of that share. And so the centralization of Lido is like an increasingly large concern. Some people call it the biggest systemic risk to Ethereum since the dow itself, just because network effects beget network effects. Staked ETH is super liquid. It has the most integrations. Staked ETH is the most useful of staking derivatives. So there's a lot of centralization power that a lot of people are worried about.
00:21:43.060 - 00:22:13.106, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess my take on this is, yes, I'm concerned, but it's not like code red. Well, yellow, orange, I'm concerned, but I also think it's still very early. My other take here is something we've been saying a lot, is the key to changing this is better competition, really. We can't put other limitations on Lido. Home staking has to get better. Other liquid staking providers have to get way better. And then lastly, I'll say, I don't think any of this is permanent.
00:22:13.106 - 00:22:41.258, Speaker B: I mean, we don't even have withdrawals yet. So it's still too early to see. But it is something to pay attention to and it's important. I do think it's become very obvious. And David, I feel like this was obvious two years ago or three years ago when we read that piece from Dan Elitzer on superfluid collateral, that the killer app is liquid eth staking. Once you stake your eth, there's an asset that's produced on the other side of that. People want to do things with that asset in DeFi, that is the marvel of tokenization.
00:22:41.258 - 00:22:51.458, Speaker B: So that is a killer app. And all the competitors need to figure out how to compete with Lido on that level in order to eat some of the market share and take that away from them. David, what do we have next?
00:22:51.544 - 00:23:24.634, Speaker A: Coming up next, the big stories of the week. Of course, Celsius files for chapter eleven bankruptcy, three years, capital leaks, the starknet token. Starknet then later launches their token, not launches their token, announces their token. So we're going to get into all those details and of course the rest of the news right after we get through some of these fantastic sponsors that help you go bankless. Rocket pool is your friendly, decentralized Ethereum staking protocol. You can stake your eth with rocket pool and get our Eth in return, allowing you to stake your Eth and use it in DFI at the same time. You you can get 4% on your eth by staking it with rocket Pool, but you can get even more by running a node.
00:23:24.634 - 00:24:08.342, Speaker A: Rocket pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating nodes. Running a rocket pool node is easier to set up than running a solo node, and you only need 16 e to get started. Why would you do this? You get an extra 15% staking commission on the pooled ETH, so your Apy is boosted. So if you're bullish e staking, you can increase your API and get some extra tokens by adding your node to a decentralized rocket pool network, which currently has over a thousand independent validators. It's yield farming, but with Ethereum nodes you can get started@rocketpool.net and also join the Rocketpool community in their discord. You can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat, so I'll see you there Makerdao is the OG DeFi protocol, the first DeFi protocol to ever exist, even before we called it DeFi, Makerdao produces Dai, the industry's most battle tested and resilient stablecoin.
00:24:08.342 - 00:24:44.706, Speaker A: Using Maker, you don't need to sell your collateral if you need liquidity. Instead, you can spin up a maker vault and use your collateral to mint Dai directly. With Maker, the power to mint new money is in your hands, and there's something new in the Makerdao ecosystem. Every time a new Makerdao is opened, the owner can claim a poap, which contributes funds to one tree planted, an organization with ongoing global reforestation efforts, creating a world where digital participation and the health of our environment can live side by side. Soon, Maker will be present on all chains and layer twos, bringing the biggest and best DFI credit facility to everywhere there is DFI. So follow Maker on Twitter at makerdao and learn from the oldest and most resilient dow in existence.
00:24:44.818 - 00:25:07.902, Speaker B: All right guys, we are back talking about Celsius. They have finally filed for chapter eleven bankruptcy. I know we've been talking about CFI lenders a lot and we can't seem to get away from them because new news develops every single week. What is this? David is this kind of the nail in the coffin? Celsius is finally saying, we can't find an acquirer. There's no other way out. So legally we have to go bankrupt, right?
00:25:07.956 - 00:25:56.880, Speaker A: Yeah. Remember a number of people, I think Nexo took a look at, or maybe it was FTX took a look at Celsius's balance sheets. Yeah, probably both of them and interested in acquiring the thing. And then they were so like, as a result of that, the only option left you have is bankruptcy. So reading from the article here, today's filing follows the difficult but necessary decision by Celsius last month to pause withdrawal swaps and transfers on its platform to stabilize its business and protect its customers. Without a pause, the acceleration of withdrawals would have allowed certain customers, those who were first to act, to be paid in full, while leaving others to wait for Celsius to harvest value from illiquid or longer term asset deployment activities while they receive a recovery. Celsius says it has $160,000,000 cash on hand, enough to support certain operations during the restructuring process.
00:25:56.880 - 00:26:35.290, Speaker A: After paying off all of their DFI loans in compound, Celsius announced that they had filed for chapter eleven bankruptcy early Thursday morning after paying off their DFI loans. So the users of this centralized app all have to sit on their hands while they wait for the dust to settle. And they're probably going to take a haircut. Including you, Ryan. All of the users compound or Aave or makerdao or all the deFi apps that Celsius used are being paid back in full because of the protections of the deFi app protocol itself. That is my takeaway. What are your thoughts?
00:26:36.030 - 00:26:52.590, Speaker B: I think that is the takeaway and that's what we've seen this week. Before they actually formally announced chapter eleven, they paid off more than 800 million in debt to DFI apps, which is really cool. And they even unlocked their st eth. They paid off their debt to ave as well.
00:26:52.660 - 00:26:54.494, Speaker A: DFI apps paid in full.
00:26:54.612 - 00:27:11.046, Speaker B: Look, man, the take is this. I tweeted this out. Notice that DFI loans are the only ones insolvent CFI companies are paying back right now. The code is forcing them to pay back their loans. Not laws, not attorneys, not courts code. And it's almost like DeFi works better.
00:27:11.068 - 00:27:14.200, Speaker A: David weird. Why are we even here?
00:27:15.050 - 00:27:48.990, Speaker B: They had no alternative. They didn't have to go to court because they couldn't go to court because the rules of the collateral are written in code. Basically. Unless you pay me back. Yes, unless you pay back Ave, they're going to take all of your collateral and it's worth it to you to pay off. It's incredible to me how well DeFi lending worked through this process, and I can't say enough. This is the bright spot of everything that's gone on over the last two to three months, and certainly everything that's gone on with centralized lending protocols.
00:27:49.070 - 00:28:15.882, Speaker A: Right? There's also another part of this story. There's this account, Zero XB one, that's famously part of the Celsius story. No one really knew who this account was. They just knew that they were doing stuff in DFI, making a ton of money and associated with Celsius. And now this account tweeted out and revealed who they are. So this account says, hi, I'm Jason Stone. From August 2020 to April 2021, I led a group of talented individuals who managed the Zero X at B one address.
00:28:15.882 - 00:29:03.414, Speaker A: After discussions with Celsius in mid 2020, Celsius began an acquisition of Keyfi, a company that this individual had founded. And thereafter Keyfi pivoted to staking and deploying DFI strategies for Celsius. In August of 20200, XB one was created, and with other addresses, Celsius would send customer deposits to us to manage. Shortly after, Celsius shared private keys to the address with us over the ensuing months, transferred hundreds of millions of dollars of customer deposits for us to invest. By the time Celsius and Keyfi parted ways, we were managing nearly 2 billion of assets. Celsius risk management platform monitored our investment strategies and performance using hedge guard and Dbank. So basically, Zero XB one would go and, like yield farm do strategies, make a bunch of money, and then Celsius would see what they're up to with these apps.
00:29:03.542 - 00:29:05.498, Speaker B: With 2 billion in 2 billion, by.
00:29:05.504 - 00:29:39.474, Speaker A: The way, depositor assets, Celsius promised the Xerox B one team members that they assured us that as a part of this monitoring, their trading teams were adequately hedging any potential impermanent loss from our activities. In liquidity pools. They assured me that they had risk management and hedging in place to account for fluctuations in token prices. But in late 2021, we discovered Celsius had lied to us. They had not been hedging our activities, nor had they been hedging the fluctuations in crypto asset prices. The entire company's portfolio had naked exposure to the market. So if you're taking customer deposits, you're not supposed to take those.
00:29:39.474 - 00:30:06.510, Speaker A: Like, if they're USD deposits, right? You're not supposed to take those USD deposits, and then buy ether with it in the hopes that ether goes up. That's opinionated. What you're supposed to be doing is you're supposed to doing delta neutral stuff, that it doesn't matter what the prices of things do. You still get yield either way. They were taking opinionated stances on the market with customers deposits, which puts them in a position of potentially not making that money back. So Xerox v one continues. After seeing these and other major problems in how the company operated, we informed Celsius that we wished to terminate our relationship.
00:30:06.510 - 00:30:46.742, Speaker A: That was in March 2021. We told Celsius that we would work with them to unwind our various positions over the following months. By April of 2021, however, because bullish part of that year, the value of assets under management had increased by another $800 million. But when we unwound the DFI positions, Celsius suffered impermanent loss. At first, they believed the impermanent loss was evidence of keyfi stealing and accused me of being a thief. They later to accept the impermanent loss for what it was, but claimed I was responsible for it, then completely ignored the fact that they had full visibility into all trading strategies deployed by Kefi and promised to hedge that exact risk. I have tried for over a year to quietly settle this dispute with Celsius.
00:30:46.742 - 00:31:05.460, Speaker A: Pursuant to the contracts Celsius signed with Kefi, they owe Keefi a significant sum of money. We have been more than reasonable in attempting to resolve this with them. Basically, it continues to say that they are suing Celsius, trying to get some money. But yes, that's what Celsius did with your money.
00:31:05.990 - 00:31:23.426, Speaker B: It's crazy how irresponsible that was. Just that story of, like, they found someone who could manage money in D five protocols fairly well, gave them $2 billion when that fund and that individual said, this stuff I'm doing is kind of risky. Are you sure about this? They're like, no, we're hedging the risk.
00:31:23.458 - 00:31:32.362, Speaker A: In other areas of the business, which is totally fine. If they were doing that, that would have been, like a risky but okay business. Maybe they weren't doing that, maybe.
00:31:32.416 - 00:32:12.440, Speaker B: And then come to find out they weren't even doing it. So it's just all of the shady stuff behind the scenes. And it's so interesting because the user experience you have as a retail user is like, deposit your funds here, get 8% back, and the money comes in each month, and you're like, oh, this sounds great. Well, on the backside of this, not going to say it was running like a Ponzi scheme. But risk management was woefully inadequate. It was absent, absent, completely absent. The question, I think, for people, including myself, who've deposited money into Celsius, is, are we ever going to get our money back? David, what do you think? The answer to that question is?
00:32:13.130 - 00:32:19.846, Speaker A: Yeah, not all of it. I think you will get in the ballpark of a 50% haircut you'll get.
00:32:19.868 - 00:32:20.246, Speaker B: You think so?
00:32:20.268 - 00:32:21.622, Speaker A: That's percent of your money back.
00:32:21.676 - 00:32:35.086, Speaker B: I asked this question from Twitter, and the truth is, no one knows. It's going to chapter eleven. And a bunch of the people were like, yeah, no way, sorry. Kiss it goodbye. Some people are being snarky. Yeah, you're definitely going to get it all, Ryan. You will get something back.
00:32:35.086 - 00:32:48.866, Speaker B: You're just forced holding or some of the answers. So it seems like the sentiment is this is kind of a mount gox type situation, and it's not looking good for getting your funds back. Maybe some portion of it at an.
00:32:48.888 - 00:32:50.738, Speaker A: Unknown amount of time, years down the line.
00:32:50.824 - 00:32:51.314, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:32:51.432 - 00:32:53.010, Speaker A: After really unfortunate.
00:32:53.590 - 00:32:58.366, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. David, what do we got next? Starkware token. What is this?
00:32:58.408 - 00:33:26.094, Speaker A: Well, no, this is, first off, we got to start with three zeros capital. So, like, Suzu breaks his silence on Twitter, and so he tweets out. Sadly, our good faith to cooperate with liquidators was met with baiting. Hopefully they did exercise good faith with regard to starware token warrants. Basically, the lawyers never exercise starquare token warrants. This is like legal stuff that I'm not totally familiar with, but you have to do a thing in order to get the tokens. After you invest in starware, you got to do a thing.
00:33:26.094 - 00:33:36.702, Speaker A: But the lawyers didn't do that thing. And maybe you know more about why they would have not have done this, either out of negligence or probably negligence.
00:33:36.766 - 00:33:40.802, Speaker B: They probably just missed. It's kind of a technicality, and they didn't check the box.
00:33:40.856 - 00:34:12.560, Speaker A: Right, right. Anyways, this was released to Twitter, which was like the first news of a starkware token, even though everything's going to have a token. So you know, everything's going to have a token. But this is like the first formal indication that we've seen of Starkware having a token. The other interesting, Suzu's first tweet, and like forever, first tweet sends, because he's been on the land, first tweet sends. That one that you can see right there. It sends June 14 saying, we are in process of communicating with all relevant parties and intend to pay them fully back in full.
00:34:12.560 - 00:34:36.494, Speaker A: Also not necessarily true, evidenced by the fact that no one knows, Ryan, where three Arrows capital founders are. So where in the world are the three Arrows capital founders? People kind of assume Dubai, but no one actually knows Dubai being a convenient place to not have an extradition treaty with basically the rest of the world. But Suzu, three arrows capital.
00:34:36.542 - 00:35:11.930, Speaker B: Kyle Davies missing yeah, so I guess things like this. On Friday, lawyers for three Arrows capital creditors, the people who want their money back, claimed that Suzu and Davies have not yet begun to cooperate in any meaningful manner, adding that the two kept their camera and audio off at an initial zoom meeting. So you have the Zoom meeting and they're keeping their camera and audio off like it's kind of a classroom during COVID and it's virtual school or something. They're just not like locking in. So who knows where these guys are and what's going to happen next. But that, I guess, is the big alpha that we now have. Wear token.
00:35:12.010 - 00:35:31.826, Speaker A: Suzu is selling his house in Singapore, but he's looking for a buyer to wire him money to his Dubai bank account, which you can't see his money in a Dubai bank account. That's kind of the whole point. So he's got like this $40 million home that he's trying to liquidate. I don't know if he's liquidated, why isn't he using crypto?
00:35:31.858 - 00:35:33.638, Speaker B: It's not very crypto native of him.
00:35:33.804 - 00:35:44.730, Speaker A: You buy banking system maybe. Well, yeah. Anyways, here's a picture of the three Arrows capital office in Singapore with some uncollected mail. There it is.
00:35:44.800 - 00:35:54.458, Speaker B: Doesn't look very good. This is what it looks like when a major hedge fund completely folds. NFT collection. We talked about that last week. This still has to be liquidated.
00:35:54.554 - 00:36:08.734, Speaker A: Yeah. So this is the starry night throws capitalist like NFT fund, which I mean, they bought the top of the NFT mania. Absolutely. But good taste. Good taste. People think that this is a really good collection. Those are kid punks.
00:36:08.862 - 00:36:10.130, Speaker B: Oh, kid punks.
00:36:10.550 - 00:36:22.854, Speaker A: I don't know about that one. That one's not necessarily good taste. But yeah, there's a bunch of really cool stuff in here which it's all going to be liquidated. So if you are an NFT collector with a bunch of cash on hand, you might have a field day soon.
00:36:22.972 - 00:36:27.570, Speaker B: Yeah. Do they still exist? NFT collectors with cash on hand, David?
00:36:27.730 - 00:36:29.720, Speaker A: Oh, with cash on hand. I don't know about that.
00:36:30.730 - 00:36:40.186, Speaker B: All right. Starkware tokens. So what is the news then? It was like pre released by 3 hours capital and then more formally released by Starkware just days later.
00:36:40.288 - 00:37:04.514, Speaker A: Yeah, one day later. Yeah, exactly. So Starkware tweets out, Starknet Alpha was launched on the Ethereum main net November 2021. Now it's a time to advance its decentralization as demanded of an l two on Ethereum. Here is our decentralization proposal, introducing the Starknet token and the Starknet foundation. Pretty much like Playbook for decentralizing your layer two. And so they released three blog posts, part one, part two, part three.
00:37:04.514 - 00:37:33.710, Speaker A: We're only going to read out parts of one and three. But the key points of blog post number one says Starknet's decentralization involves a native token and a new foundation. Again, part of the course, the Starknet token is used for governance and as the network's payment and staking asset. So that's actually not a crazy choice. But demanding your own token to be the payment token for that particular layer two, that's an interesting choice to consider. That's like arbitram optimism. They don't do that.
00:37:33.710 - 00:38:04.182, Speaker A: They take ether as the gas for the layer two rather than the network's native token. So the take here is that, well, if this darkware's token is the new gas for the Starkware layer two, they're really more aligned with the Starkware layer two than they are with the Ethereum layer one. So it started to make its own self sovereign ecosystem. So there's that. 10 billion tokens have been minted and their allocation has begun. The Starkware foundation, now being set up, will have a mission to maintain Starknet as a public good. We do like that public good word.
00:38:04.182 - 00:38:25.294, Speaker A: So here are the details. 10 billion tokens. We'll pull up a pie chart here in a second. 17% going to Starkware investors, 3 hours capital, which that's going to get liquidated and distributed, which, I mean, I'm kind of fan of that because of decentralization. They had like a lot of it. And then 32.9% of two core contributors, that is the Starquare team.
00:38:25.294 - 00:38:49.558, Speaker A: If you add those two numbers up, I believe you get 49.9%. And then on the other side of things, 12% to grants, 10% to the foundation, 8.1% is unallocated to be determined, 2% donations, 9% community rebates, and 9% community provisions. So you have 49.9% on one side. That's like decentralized team and investors. And you have 50.1%
00:38:49.558 - 00:38:57.986, Speaker A: on the other side, which is various forms of the community, the foundation, like long term software development. Ryan, what's your take on this distribution?
00:38:58.098 - 00:39:07.574, Speaker B: Yeah, it's not bad. I mean, it seems kind of par for the course. 50% is maybe a bit on the high side from an investor and kind of core contributor perspective.
00:39:07.622 - 00:39:09.194, Speaker A: 49.9 perspective, actually.
00:39:09.312 - 00:39:27.514, Speaker B: Sorry. Yes. Not quite 50%, but I don't know, some of its semantics. 10% here, 10% there. I'm not really sure. The big question to me is how are they actually going to distribute the tokens to their users in the community? How does that work? Do we have any details on that or a timeline here?
00:39:27.652 - 00:39:29.854, Speaker A: I don't think we do, no. Very limited timeline.
00:39:29.902 - 00:39:44.360, Speaker B: This is still an announcement to launch a token. And you kind of wonder if they just did it a day after the Suzu news came out and they kind of rushed it as a result. And so that might be part of the reason they don't have dates. Not sure.
00:39:44.730 - 00:39:52.154, Speaker A: They had three blog posts and it came out 24 hours after the Suzu announcement. That would be. I think they had this ready to fire.
00:39:52.272 - 00:39:59.930, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe that's what's going on in Starkware world. How many more player twos are we waiting for now?
00:40:00.000 - 00:40:02.042, Speaker A: ZK's token, ZK sync.
00:40:02.186 - 00:40:04.030, Speaker B: There are a couple of others in the works too.
00:40:04.100 - 00:40:23.458, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, there's a ton released their token. Aztec has a token. There's scroll that's still in development. There's a ton of layer twos left, but these are between Starkware. Between Starkware, ZK sync, optimism, and arbitram. Arbitrum also needs to release a token. Those are like the big ones, I'd say.
00:40:23.544 - 00:40:37.602, Speaker B: That's right. And they're probably all going to release their token during the bear market. So I guess we will see what happens there, guys. Coming up next, the story of Vitalik writing a book. I just found this out last week. What is he writing? We'll talk a little bit about that. Also aave launching a stablecoin.
00:40:37.602 - 00:40:48.474, Speaker B: Is this going to be a Dai competitor? Are they doing something else? And then finally Disney and Polygon are teaming up. We'll talk a little bit about that. Before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.

00:42:28.454 - 00:42:34.720, Speaker B: All right, guys, we're back. David, did you know that Vitalik is writing a book? Like I know you know now, but did you know before last week?
00:42:36.210 - 00:42:37.934, Speaker A: No, I knew it this week.
00:42:38.052 - 00:42:50.114, Speaker B: You knew it. This. Found it. Okay, so I just learned this last week, and I was like surprised because I follow what that man does. Like, I read this research post, all right? I stalk Vitalik Buterin in a way.
00:42:50.152 - 00:42:51.298, Speaker A: Notifications are on.
00:42:51.384 - 00:43:15.798, Speaker B: Yeah, notifications are on and dialed up, but yeah. Just learned he's coming out with a book. This book is set to release on September 13. I believe it is now for sale on Amazon. It's called proof of stake, the Making of Ethereum, and the philosophy of blockchains. So he's co writing this. It's not just Vitalik, but there's another author, Nathan Schneider, who I think editor.
00:43:15.798 - 00:43:43.330, Speaker B: There's an editor. Okay, he's an academic of some sort, and he actually jumped in the thread and was commenting. I was asking questions back and forth. I'm anxious to read this. The author or the editor says it's about giving crypto and blockchains a philosophical underpinning and kind of separating it from the scams. Like it is a good thing for the world if you're a serious person, an individual. And here's why.
00:43:43.330 - 00:43:51.926, Speaker B: Vitalik is making the case to a different crowd than probably the crowd that listens to bankless or that is the attempt. It seems like that's what the editor is saying anyway.
00:43:52.108 - 00:44:04.602, Speaker A: Beautiful. I cannot wait to read that. Exactly the type of content that I'm looking for. I heard a funny joke somewhere that was like, I'm starting to think this whole Ethereum merge thing is really just a point to sell Vitalik's book.
00:44:04.736 - 00:44:10.138, Speaker B: Oh well, the dates. Okay, let me say September 13. Is that also going to be the.
00:44:10.144 - 00:44:14.750, Speaker A: Release date of the merge? It's a reasonable merge date. It's not crazy, right?
00:44:14.820 - 00:44:17.262, Speaker B: I'm just saying it's not crazy how.
00:44:17.316 - 00:44:22.830, Speaker A: Hyper trying to sell his books, the bitcoiners are, right? I knew he's a scammer.
00:44:23.570 - 00:44:36.594, Speaker B: It was all about this book, the reason for starting Ethereum. Just a long con. Vitalik, good job, man. All right, Ave, they're doing a stablecoin. I'm pretty excited about it. What are we talking about? Ave bucks? Is that what it is? Ave bucks?
00:44:36.642 - 00:45:16.420, Speaker A: Yeah. No, Ave bucks. Stablecoin fears with a proposed new token so Ave companies, the centralized team that stewards the Ave protocol, propose a new dollar peg stablecoin to the protocol's Dow on July 7. The G-H-O for Ghost. That's the Ave like icon like mascot, will be minted by borrowing against assets locked as collateral on Ave. Borrowers will still earn yield on their deposited assets while also racking up interest on their borrowed gho. According to Aave company's proposal, interest payments will go directly to the Dow treasury, of course, and can be considered revenue, a welcome word in the bear market.
00:45:16.420 - 00:45:45.018, Speaker A: This is the power of defi that Gho allows for more liquidity for decentralized stablecoins in the market, more fees for AAve, more volume and fees for curve, more stability for other stablecoins, and more attractiveness of defi in general compared to CFI, wrote Mark Zeller, who works at Aave. So basically it's like makerdao but with a money market attached. So if you slammed like makerdao and compound together, boom, you would have the Aave stablecoin, which is great.
00:45:45.104 - 00:45:59.354, Speaker B: That's awesome. Makes a lot of sense. It's all collateral backed. It's collateralized. This is not like the terra Luna fiasco at all. So it's using the strengths of the maker model and the strengths of Ave, which is the money market piece. So is the thing going to be called ghost? Ghost?
00:45:59.402 - 00:46:03.150, Speaker A: Yeah, it's going to be the go stable. It's going to be called go, yeah.
00:46:03.220 - 00:46:03.920, Speaker B: All right.
00:46:04.710 - 00:46:53.306, Speaker A: I am not the arbiter of the pronunciations. I think it's worth exploring and unpacking the differences of makerdao die versus Aave go. So Makerdao, extremely risk adverse, extremely hardened, going after real world assets, and, like, real world integrations, where Aave is a little bit more defi crypto native, going after maybe a little bit more of the long tail of risk. Not totally, not totally down the long tail, but opening up more total assets to mint go than you can put into Makerdao to mint dai. So we're starting to see some Separation makerdao, like, real world assets, extremely risk adverse, extremely conservative. Ave, not totally super conservative, still very risk adverse. Ave has never been hacked in any way, but also accepting a little bit more liberal on the long tail of crypto native tokens.
00:46:53.306 - 00:47:00.098, Speaker A: So you can start to see some divisions in, like, the decentralized stablecoin. I'm actually just so happy we have a second decentralized stablecoin. I think that's so great.
00:47:00.184 - 00:47:06.934, Speaker B: It's so great. Missed opportunity to call it Ave bucks. Maybe that's still on the table, guys. But if you're hearing me, not a bad name.
00:47:07.052 - 00:47:09.110, Speaker A: But you know what's cool, Ryan?
00:47:10.490 - 00:47:11.698, Speaker B: We could call it Ave bucks.
00:47:11.714 - 00:47:16.598, Speaker A: We start that, say you're leaking the bankless stablecoin strategy of bankless bucks that we have.
00:47:16.684 - 00:47:21.542, Speaker B: Is that coming? Bankless bucks. What is going to be the collateral that backs that, David?
00:47:21.686 - 00:47:23.686, Speaker A: Oh, well, TVD.
00:47:23.878 - 00:47:50.466, Speaker B: Okay. All right. David's making stablecoins on the fly. But do you know what's funny to me is, as you were describing how much things have changed for me, I used to think of Aave as, oh, that's pretty. Oh, I prefer makerdao. If I'm taking margin out or taking a loan out on my eth, I'll do maker dow rather than Aave. Ave just seems so blue chip and so risk off now.
00:47:50.466 - 00:48:01.874, Speaker B: And I think part of that is like, they've done a great job and Lindy effect. They've been here for a couple of years, and it's worked very well, the other part of that is the Overton window has completely shifted.
00:48:01.922 - 00:48:02.182, Speaker A: Right?
00:48:02.236 - 00:48:32.510, Speaker B: So now we went in this bull cycle way out on the risk spectrum, we saw things like Luna and UsT and that whole implosion, all these algorithmic stablecoins and what's happened with CFI lending, right, the safe places like blockfi and Celsius to deposit your funds have completely exploded. Now I'm like, Aave, it just seems so safe, it seems so blue chip, it seems so grammar ready. And that's totally changed for me in the last couple of years.
00:48:32.580 - 00:48:55.266, Speaker A: Totally. All the things that are still alive right now. I mean, we still have to make it to the other side of the bull market. But it seems like the most of the downside volatility has happened already. So if it's going to break at a protocol level, it would have broken by now. So all the stablecoins that exist today, I feel like you can definitely start to endorse these things pretty well. You could have always endorsed Dai, like Ave the stablecoin.
00:48:55.266 - 00:49:09.354, Speaker A: I don't think it really adds any new risk to the Aave protocol. It's a new product, not necessarily a new risk vector, I'd say. And then also fracs killed it. This bear market. In a good way. In a good way. Like, killed it.
00:49:09.472 - 00:49:11.802, Speaker B: To the upside, they're doing well. He didn't die.
00:49:11.866 - 00:49:29.682, Speaker A: Yeah, ust goodbye Wonderland mim. I'm pretty sure that's gone for the most part. It is. Anyways, I wouldn't trust it personally, but now we have, like, three really awesome decentralized stablecoins optimizing for three different things. So bear market, build market.
00:49:29.816 - 00:50:01.978, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. It's absolutely great. Big week for Maddox as well, this week in Polygon. So the first bit of news is Robinhood just started allowing deposits and withdrawal support for Maddox and for Polygon. So that's another Fiat bridge, Fiat Gateway and Robinhood, of course, I don't know, 2020, 5 million users, something like this now have a way to get directly onto Polygon. Also, some breaking news from Polygon. They are excited to be the only blockchain chosen to be part of the Disney accelerator program.
00:50:01.978 - 00:50:02.902, Speaker B: What is this, David?
00:50:02.966 - 00:50:32.038, Speaker A: Yeah, so six companies selected to be a part of the Disney's 2022 accelerator program. I didn't know this existed, but now I do. Is a business and development program designed to spur the growth of innovative companies around the world. This program, which starts in a week, so, like, next week, is looking to develop technologies with augmented reality, non fungible tokens and artificial intelligence. I mean, you can kind of just guess and see. Imagine for yourself how those things fit into a Disney product. Right? Like, I don't think it takes that much imagination to put those things together.
00:50:32.038 - 00:50:47.594, Speaker A: During the course of the program, each participating company will receive guidance from Disney's senior leadership team, as well as a dedicated executive mentor. And like Ryan said, polygon is the only blockchain native platform selected in a six company. Cool. Cool.
00:50:47.632 - 00:51:05.082, Speaker B: Yeah, good for them. Good business development of know. Always waiting for Disney's the giant of ip in the world to start doing things with the Marvel universe, the Star wars universe, or like, mickey Mouse and friends in NFTs. And maybe this is a way to explore that as well. A bit more, David.
00:51:05.146 - 00:51:06.240, Speaker A: Oh, this is really.
00:51:07.010 - 00:51:08.114, Speaker B: This is what's happening.
00:51:08.232 - 00:51:35.974, Speaker A: This is the EnS markets. EnS markets, I always like to say there's always a bull market somewhere. Even in the midst of this bear market, somebody's still making money. And right now it is the EnS domain name holders and specifically certain clubs of holders. These clubs have come out of the ether. So you had, like, the nine nine nine club, which is anyone who owns numbers through nine nine nine e. You are in the nine nine nine club.
00:51:35.974 - 00:51:51.738, Speaker A: Then there's also the ten K club, which add another digit. I'm in the ten K club. Thank you. What number do you have? I actually don't know. It starts with I think. I don't know. But then there's also other clubs, right? There's like, arabic number clubs.
00:51:51.738 - 00:52:32.378, Speaker A: A bunch of clubs are being established, and it's basically like this bottom up non ERC 20 token dow, right? So it's like, these are these clubs. And so there's this tweet thread that has a bunch of these metrics that I'll read out here. With a current floor price of 25 eTh, the nine nine nine club has quickly become the most expensive of all the Ens clubs and now is considered an icon of EnS domains. To look into the nine nine club, we've pulled addresses of all 506 different holders of the 1009 nine Ens names. The first thing we notice is the lowest amount of paper hands that we've ever seen, 2.4%. I'm pretty sure what that means is only 2.4% of total holders has sold.
00:52:32.378 - 00:53:09.106, Speaker A: I think that's like four or five, six people. This is the highest of the category classified by this particular algorithm. And 168 of these holders of the 506 have their ENS domain as their primary ENS name record. And so their numbers actually registered to their Ethereum address. So 33% of these holders are using these digits as their EnS identity. And so next up is a ten K club, which is like 1000 through 9999 ETH, a larger amount of supply, and a 1.6 ETH floor.
00:53:09.106 - 00:53:46.430, Speaker A: The ten K club has an unsurprisingly higher ratio of paper hands. But to put things in perspective, the ratio is still higher than things like azukis or doodles. The ten K club is made up of 4368 wallets. 218 of them also own a nine nine nine club ens. That means almost half of the nine nine club also owns a four digit Ens name. This time, 668 holders have defined their address as an ENS primary domain ratio is lower than the nine m club, but the network effect is still greater with four times as many people flexing their four digit numbers. And this is just the numbers club.
00:53:46.430 - 00:53:53.218, Speaker A: Like I said, there are other clubs, EnS clubs in the EnS game. You can check them out at EnS vision.
00:53:53.394 - 00:53:56.934, Speaker B: What is with this? Why is this happening? So, first of all, let me say.
00:53:57.052 - 00:53:59.206, Speaker A: Humans like tribes, Ryan, okay, but first.
00:53:59.228 - 00:54:28.034, Speaker B: Of, like, dot eths are, I think, the perfect bear market NFT to start trading. I don't know, it just feels so essential. So, you know, it's close to the metal, so foundational. So I get that aspect of it after fashion. But why now? EnS has been around forever. Why are we suddenly now in July of 2022 and also June and may, why are we now getting this degen bull market on ens? Can you explain this to me?
00:54:28.072 - 00:55:10.782, Speaker A: Yeah, I actually do have an answer for that. Well, some part is just like ghosts in the machine, people just like to trade things. But also, I'll say that a lot of new NFT speculators that came in bought ether at higher prices, much higher prices than they are now. And so, like Ens names are a great tax lost harvesting NFT to purchase after you bought your 4000k ether, and now it's down to $1,000. So you can buy an Ens name, because if you're buying an Ens name, you're still longing Ethereum mostly. So you get to tax loss, harvest all that ether that you bought. But, and you can also buy an NFT that you know is not going anywhere, unlike all the other JPeg NFTs that are opinionated, like, do you like the cats? Do you like the punks? Do you like the.
00:55:10.782 - 00:55:33.126, Speaker A: Like, it doesn't matter. Everyone plays the game like you, Ryan, have an EnS name. I've got an ens name. We're considered like, defi people more than we are NFT people. But even us have ens names, right? And so that I think. And also, just like, there's historical relevancy, like, the DNS world has made people bajillions of dollars, and so we're just repeating history again.
00:55:33.228 - 00:55:45.050, Speaker B: I get it, I get it. I get all these arguments and nice pro tax tip, by the way, David. I'm proud of that one. That was good. That was good. Tax loss harvesting is awesome, okay? But all of that stuff was true before.
00:55:45.120 - 00:55:50.006, Speaker A: Now people have, like, jpegs just leave a bad taste in people's mouths.
00:55:50.038 - 00:55:56.830, Speaker B: Now that might be it. So people are like, anti image, anti jpEg. And they're like, I want something real.
00:55:56.900 - 00:55:59.902, Speaker A: Yeah, give me something. It's a proxy for Ethereum, okay?
00:55:59.956 - 00:56:15.854, Speaker B: And eths are like, it's a proxy for Ethereum. But it's also like, it's tangible, it's real, it has utility. What can you do with a. You can. It's. It's a human readable name for any ethereum address or any, I guess, address in general on the Internet. And that has utility.
00:56:15.854 - 00:56:17.970, Speaker B: And maybe that's where the market's going for nfts.
00:56:18.050 - 00:56:39.510, Speaker A: Yeah. I think crypto punks are cool, but that's not a universally held opinion. Right? Like, some people think crypto punks are cringe, even though those people are wrong. But if you are walking to a club, a metaverse club, and you have Eth as your name, everyone thinks you're cool. Really. It's a universal signal.
00:56:39.590 - 00:56:44.670, Speaker B: I think that's it, man. I think the explanation is exactly what you said. Jpegs are out. Jpegs are out.
00:56:44.820 - 00:56:47.374, Speaker A: Jpegs are universally out. But again, they're more.
00:56:47.412 - 00:57:07.442, Speaker B: You know what I mean? I've read so many takes this week about just in mainstream media about NFTs being a scam. And it's endless, man. Jpegs are just not. Jpegs aren't appearing on Jimmy Kimmel these days, that's for damn sure. Right? It's like totally out of mainstream culture, except Bill Murray being countercultural. He went and he bought a cool cat.
00:57:07.496 - 00:57:13.154, Speaker A: This cat. That's cat Bill Murray. That's the cool cat that I would expect Bill Murray to purchase.
00:57:13.202 - 00:57:14.726, Speaker B: Do you know he's buying the dip here?
00:57:14.828 - 00:57:39.754, Speaker A: Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Good for him. One more thing on the ens names before we move on. I think this needs to be seconded, but I think this whole thing got started when people noticed a bunch of people in arab countries buying number, ens names and the license plate. Low digit license plates in places like the United Arab Emirates are similarly status symbols.
00:57:39.754 - 00:57:53.218, Speaker A: So people will pay big numbers for low digit license plate numbers. And so ens, it's like even bigger market. And so I think this got triggered in the east and now the west is like, oh, we also want to play this game, and now the game's on.
00:57:53.384 - 00:57:55.502, Speaker B: Have you ever had a personal license plate, David?
00:57:55.566 - 00:57:59.574, Speaker A: No, that's bankless. Bankless is, sadly, eight letters. I actually did.
00:57:59.612 - 00:58:04.594, Speaker B: No. B-N-K-L-E-S-S. We could do that. I could get mine in Virginia.
00:58:04.722 - 00:58:05.990, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay.
00:58:06.140 - 00:58:08.230, Speaker B: I'm not into it. You don't have a car?
00:58:08.300 - 00:58:09.266, Speaker A: I don't have a car anymore.
00:58:09.298 - 00:58:13.142, Speaker B: You're out. Okay. I have a minivan. A confession.
00:58:13.206 - 00:58:14.054, Speaker A: Do you have a minivan?
00:58:14.102 - 00:58:20.060, Speaker B: Not putting that kids and everything. I will take a picture of my minivan and show it to you.
00:58:21.010 - 00:58:25.854, Speaker A: I don't think. Well, don't put your license plate online, though.
00:58:26.052 - 00:58:35.674, Speaker B: Yeah. Good call. Thank you. Thank you. Opsec lesson for you as well. GameStop finally launched their NFT marketplace as well. What is this thing looking like? David?
00:58:35.722 - 00:58:57.286, Speaker A: Yeah, this is Matt Feinstone. Used to be at loop ring, now at GameStop, and he goes GM, everyone. GameStop NFT is live in beta, noncustodial Ethereum, layer two marketplace, where the community can truly own the digital assets that they love. You can check it out at NFT, gamestop.com. And so now this is the verge. GameStop's NFT marketplace has arrived just in time for a crypto market crash. God, they just can't let us.
00:58:57.286 - 00:58:58.198, Speaker A: Give us a break.
00:58:58.364 - 00:59:00.970, Speaker B: Can't let it be fun. Come on, Verge. Yeah.
00:59:01.120 - 00:59:28.094, Speaker A: Anyways, buy, sell, create nfts on the GameStop NFT marketplace. Over 200 collections are on there with more than 53,000 nfts listed. And you can connect the newly launched GameStop wallet, which we talked about a few weeks ago, to your digital assets. You can also use options like wallet, Connect, and Metamask. Right now, not everyone can create an NFT. Only certain creators can apply, but I'm sure they're going to open up in the future. But also, of course, GameStop.
00:59:28.094 - 00:59:57.158, Speaker A: It's got the word game in the name. Ryan, they're a gaming company. They have bigger plans than address a marketplace down the line. They said in a press release that it plans to expand functionality into areas like web three gaming on the NFT marketplace. GameStop is already teasing support for immutable x a platform on Ethereum that's used by some NFT games is coming soon. Also, previously we've talked about the 100 million dollar grant program between GameStop and immutables that help build out the world of web three gaming. So you could just imagine, it's like, oh, I'm playing my game.
00:59:57.158 - 01:00:06.670, Speaker A: I found my super awesome law long sword of flame. It's worth $10,000. I'm going to take it to the GameStop marketplace and sell it. You could totally see that world at least.
01:00:06.740 - 01:00:14.720, Speaker B: This is pretty cool. I like it. What is this built on? So I know it's a layer two. Do you know what the marketplace is built on? Is it immutable? Is it loop ring? Is it some combo of both?
01:00:15.170 - 01:00:20.002, Speaker A: That is a good question. I do not know. It's one of those two things. It's one of those two things.
01:00:20.056 - 01:00:21.554, Speaker B: Immutable x coming soon.
01:00:21.672 - 01:00:29.186, Speaker A: Yeah, well, that's what I talked about. They're teasing it. So what is it currently based on? I bet you if it's not both now, it will be later.
01:00:29.288 - 01:00:43.402, Speaker B: That's a question for Matt. We'll go find out guys and let you know. But it is on layer two and that's pretty cool. I would guess it's either immutable or loop ring or some combo of both. David, let's get to some bitcoin stuff. I guess this isn't bitcoin stuff. It's maybe bitcoin tribe stuff.
01:00:43.402 - 01:01:07.454, Speaker B: Michael Saylor this week quoted as saying ethereum is obviously a security. Obviously, David, I think Ethereum is a security. He says, I think it's pretty obvious. It was issued by an ICO. There's a management team, there was a pre mine, there was a hard fork, there's continual hard forks, there's a difficulty bomb that keeps pushing back. And then he says, I think all proof of stake networks are securities, all of them, and they're all very risky. It's above my pay grade.
01:01:07.454 - 01:01:12.210, Speaker B: The regulators will decide whether or not they will allow them to continue or not.
01:01:12.280 - 01:01:13.954, Speaker A: It's the only good take he had.
01:01:14.072 - 01:01:38.474, Speaker B: The regulators will allow. I don't know that the regulators get to decide whether the networks continue, but I guess they get to establish some sort of stamp of legitimacy on them. David, do you think that this is just some insecurity here about ETH being a security or ETH not being a security? Do you think that bitcoin maximalists, let me say, are threatened by always?
01:01:38.512 - 01:01:39.402, Speaker A: They always have been.
01:01:39.456 - 01:02:21.794, Speaker B: The CFTC has clearly stated multiple times that ether is a commodity. We've had senior members of the SEC say that as well. Ether is a commodity along with bitcoin group it in here. We've had a long period of time since the initial ICO, the continuing acceptance, more decentralization of Ethereum. Over the years, there haven't been strong indications that any senior officials in the US actually are targeting Ethereum as a security. So regardless of whether you think it's a security or not, under the definition of a security, it doesn't seem to be. That's the direction the regulators are trying to proceed and pursue.
01:02:21.794 - 01:02:22.810, Speaker B: What do you think about this?
01:02:22.880 - 01:02:54.180, Speaker A: Yeah, this is the classic old man yells at cloud meme bitcoiners. For people that have been on crypto Twitter for longer than this bull market. This is like just a classic talking point of bitcoin maxis about Ethereum. Like, oh, there was a pre mine, oh, Vitalik controls everything. Meanwhile, Vitalik holds the record for the most ignored and unemmerged EIP addresses, or eips to Ethereum. Fun fact, no control over the monetary supply, blah, blah, blah. Like all these talking points, ETH is a security.
01:02:54.180 - 01:03:09.334, Speaker A: Vitalik's a scammer. Anyone who thinks that Vitalik's a scammer, that's a legitimate take that people have on crypto Twitter. Vitalik is a scammer. He's building a scam. He's the biggest scammer of all time. That's just ridiculous. And so this whole ether is a security thing.
01:03:09.334 - 01:03:22.222, Speaker A: It's really just like there's this very strong do not break ranks culture in bitcoin, in the bitcoin camp. And this is like one of those talking points that they say, no, only buy bitcoin because everything else is a security.
01:03:22.356 - 01:03:34.014, Speaker B: It has got to be the least cypherpunk take I've ever heard from bitcoin maximalists, which is like, hey, nation state, come help make ether a security, please.
01:03:34.132 - 01:03:36.926, Speaker A: Because, you know, it's just in the interest of their bags.
01:03:37.118 - 01:04:03.850, Speaker B: I don't understand. I mean, I would think that hardcore bitcoiners, hardcore bitcoin maximalists, don't. They skew libertarian. Aren't we trying to get away from kind of like nation state control of our monetary system and that the entire point, so let assets compete. Why not let assets compete? I don't understand the appeal to Papa Gensler to come take a look at Ethereum and get them in trouble.
01:04:05.070 - 01:04:18.378, Speaker A: It's libertarianism when it's about bitcoin, but if it's about anything else, it's their super status like the bitcoin maximalist is like a state. And if you go against the will of the state, they come at you with their cyber Hornet army.
01:04:18.474 - 01:04:22.558, Speaker B: Are you a bitcoin maximalist? Come at David and I and tell us why we're wrong.
01:04:22.644 - 01:04:23.840, Speaker A: I've heard it all.
01:04:24.210 - 01:04:26.906, Speaker B: Do you think bitcoin maximalists listen to bakeless anymore, David?
01:04:27.018 - 01:04:45.590, Speaker A: Probably not. Probably? Well, no, because you're not allowed to consume anything. That's like. It's literally like one of these extremist religions. Like, you are not allowed to receive education outside of the bitcoin state. You are not allowed to flirt with the enemy. You are not allowed to go on other people's podcasts.
01:04:45.590 - 01:04:59.782, Speaker A: You have to stay inside of the bitcoin cult. And if you go outside of the cult, you'll be exiled. Like, look what happened to Nick Carter. The same. Just extreme tribalism exists beyond bitcoin maximalism, and it's a part of bitcoin maximalism.
01:04:59.846 - 01:05:20.386, Speaker B: You're a bitcoin maximalist. Don't you dare flirt with bankless. Turn this episode off right now. Do not dare. Even Dan held and some prominent bitcoiners actually rejected the take of Ethereum being a security and agreed with our takes here. Anyway, let's get to some releases. Some good news here.
01:05:20.386 - 01:05:22.270, Speaker B: What is this? Pseudo amm.
01:05:22.430 - 01:05:44.246, Speaker A: Pseudo amm from pseudoswap. This is NFT liquidity infrastructure. So some quick tidbits about what this actually is. It's an Amm for nfts, but you got to get a little bit more creative because it's not that simple. But three things you can really do. You can create pools that gradually buy or sell nfts along price curves. You can provide liquidity to pools to buy and sell those nfts to earn fees.
01:05:44.246 - 01:06:02.894, Speaker A: And you can directly list all of your nfts at fixed prices. Liquidity providers have full control over their pool's pricing. They can address it at any time. There's endless possibilities for new pricing models. Basically, there is more infrastructure for liquidity on nfts. Like NFT financialization really needs to improve. There's so much left to do.
01:06:03.012 - 01:06:04.410, Speaker B: Are you bullish on this category?
01:06:04.490 - 01:06:20.450, Speaker A: Oh, big NFT defi integration. Like, nfts are super illiquid and they need to be more illiquid to it in order to be more adopted and just useful. And so we have things like collateralized NFT infrastructure. Like this is also another one. Just like things that provide liquidity to nfts. I'm pretty bullish on.
01:06:20.600 - 01:06:39.158, Speaker B: Yeah, I think this is alpha, guys. I think a lot of NFT Phi building is going to happen during the bear market and you're going to see the fruits of that in the next bull cycle. Also, this lens tube, what is this? An open source web three video sharing social media platform built on top of lens protocol and live on polygon.
01:06:39.254 - 01:07:07.742, Speaker A: Yeah, so there's two protocols in the back end here. One is live peer, which has been around for a while, just like decentralized video transcoding and streaming, and then rweave for the data. So the data is all on rweave. Live peer does all the video transcoding and then lens tube is the front end. So they're connecting all the dots for you. Here's my friend Gabriel Haynes, crypto, Twitter will recognize him. So, yeah, there's now a more decentralized alternative for YouTube.
01:07:07.886 - 01:07:24.566, Speaker B: David, we got to do this. Look at Gabriel. He's got some subscribers here. We got to set up our lens tube account on bankless. Guys, some big raises this week. The first lightspeed raised $7 billion across four funds and launched a new crypto native team. That is absolutely colossal.
01:07:24.566 - 01:07:28.586, Speaker B: Raise $7 billion during $7 billion these.
01:07:28.608 - 01:07:30.742, Speaker A: Days, apparently lightspeed, apparently.
01:07:30.806 - 01:08:03.986, Speaker B: Now they do. Also, multicoin capital launched $430,000,000 venture fund. I think the theme here is it's a good time to deploy capital in the bear market. I think smart funds have raised or gotten the commitments to raise in the bull market or using their reputation in order to keep raising and are planning to deploy a lot during the bear market. This is why this feels much different than 2018, David, when no one was like, you wouldn't see any of this level of raises, everything completely dried up. Now people are still investing.
01:08:04.098 - 01:08:30.782, Speaker A: Yeah, I think vcs are just like licking their lips. The time this power has shifted back into the camp of vcs, where in 2021, the power was in the hands of founders and builders. Like, if you had a product, you could raise infinite amount of money at an infinite valuation, and vcs were having to push out other vcs to get into deals. Now it's the inverse. Now the vcs are like, ha, power is back in our side. Now we've got all the money and you've got none of it.
01:08:30.836 - 01:08:31.470, Speaker B: Set the terms.
01:08:31.540 - 01:08:37.694, Speaker A: Yeah, we set the terms. So, yeah, financialized, capitalized vcs are in a good spot.
01:08:37.822 - 01:08:53.602, Speaker B: That's good because private valuations were getting nutty. Absolutely insane compared to public as well. This is Lifi. They just raised 5.5 million in a strategic ecosystem round this is a bridging aggregator technology. Pretty cool, David.
01:08:53.666 - 01:09:24.686, Speaker A: Not just a bridge aggregator, a bridge and Dex aggregator. Aggregator. It gets you from chain a to chain b, while simultaneously getting you from asset one to asset two at the same time. I mean, you can just imagine in a blossoming of blockchains, both alternative layer ones and many, many layer twos, and also assets, you can just teleport from chain to chain while also swapping assets at the same time. And it just routes your order through in the best possible way to make sure you preserve all your capital while.
01:09:24.708 - 01:09:28.078, Speaker B: You go through that chain. Teleportation, that's better than chain bridging.
01:09:28.094 - 01:09:30.222, Speaker A: David. And asset teleportation.
01:09:30.366 - 01:09:49.682, Speaker B: David and I are investors in this one, too. Just a small portion. Angel investors. Also, Chris Dixon, he just funded Farcaster. And what's cool about this is I don't use Farcaster, but it seems kind of cool. And I could imagine myself using this years ago. This is basically like RSS plus.
01:09:49.682 - 01:10:40.910, Speaker B: And I remember one of Chris's initial theses, like ten years ago in a 16 z, more broadly, was that RSS would kind of take off as an open protocol. Right? And that world didn't really happen. Instead, we got kind of the social media closed ecosystems of Twitter and Facebook and other social networks and even the substacs of the world. I think his thesis is the reason it didn't work is because RSS, as a protocol, did not have value capture, did not have a token, did not have money, did not have payments. And now I think this is another attempt at that, to revitalize this protocol, which is RSS, and to add a business layer on top of it. I haven't looked at the details, but I recall that being one of Chris's talking points. And theses.
01:10:40.910 - 01:10:41.610, Speaker B: Cool.
01:10:41.760 - 01:10:49.546, Speaker A: I'm a big fan. Yeah. This is web three, reinvigorating web one. And there are a lot of cool things about web one, not that I.
01:10:49.568 - 01:11:11.490, Speaker B: Was there for it, totally. Gnosis safe. They just raised $100 million, led by one k x. Gnosis is just a great tool for storing funds in a multi sig type way. $100 million, apparently. I bet they raised some of that during the bull run and are announcing it now. Any takes on this?
01:11:11.640 - 01:11:28.758, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, everyone uses this product, right? Everyone has. Not everyone. A lot of people have multi sigs. I have a personal multi sig that I use Ryan, and I have the bankless multi sig. Like, basically every single Dow's treasury is inside of the Gnosis multi Sig. They're also rebranding it. This is also a rebrand to safe.
01:11:28.758 - 01:11:53.578, Speaker A: So take off the gnosis and just add safe. And so basically of all contracts in Ethereum, here's a good bit of trivia. Gnosis safe, now called safe, has stored and secured the most value across Ethereum over time. So it has the biggest TVL of assets locked. That's because of just how simple stupid the contracts are. And it's just like a basic multi.
01:11:53.594 - 01:12:03.458, Speaker B: Sig and it's just battle tested, man. Yeah, right. Like there's $40 billion in there. I didn't know nfts were in here too. 13% of all crypto punks are in safe right now. Pretty cool.
01:12:03.544 - 01:12:04.802, Speaker A: I need to put mine in there.
01:12:04.936 - 01:12:39.850, Speaker B: Good to see them continuing to invest there. And of course with all of this investment money, that means there are jobs available for you. What do we tell you every single week? Get a job in crypto if you can. And I'm here to tell you you can because there are some companies that are hiring. There is a jobs board that is ready to feed you those jobs. Let me read a few smart contract software engineer steakfish backend full stack software engineer steakfish blockchain marketer Steakfish Front end engineer software engineer Steakfish DevOps engineer steakfish they want a lot of engineering talent. Looks like alliance Dow looking for a CTO.
01:12:39.850 - 01:12:53.326, Speaker B: Also a software engineer. Also a senior software engineer, also an executive assistant. Otterspace wants a solidity engineer uniswaps is hiring. Are you generous? Is hiring. Chainlink is hiring. Argent is hiring. Tally is hiring.
01:12:53.326 - 01:13:04.600, Speaker B: I could go on, but I won't. You can see all of these job positions. Thebankless palette.com slash jobs. Go check those out. All right, David, what are we on to next? My friend?
01:13:05.450 - 01:13:33.390, Speaker A: Sponsors. Ron's a sponsors taking a quick break to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible. But then we're going to come back and talk about questions from the nation takes of the week and what David and Ryan are bullish on and of course, the meme of the week. The layer two era is upon us. Ethereum's layer two ecosystem is growing every day and we need layer two bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer two life. Across is the fastest, cheapest and most secure crosschain bridge. With across you don't have to worry about high fees or long wait times.
01:13:33.390 - 01:14:22.170, Speaker A: Assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously. Across its bridges are powered by UmA's optimistic oracle to securely transfer tokens between layer two s and Ethereum across its critical ecosystem infrastructure and across v two has just launched. Their new version focuses on higher capital efficiency, layer two to layer two transfers and a brand new chain with Polygon, all while prioritizing high security and low fees. You can be a part of across's story by joining their discord and using across for all of your layer two transferring needs. So go to across to quickly and securely bridge your assets between Ethereum, optimism, Polygon, arbitram or Boba networks, the Brave browser is the user first browser for the web three Internet with over 60 million monthly active users. And inside the brave browser you'll find the brave wallet, the secure, multitrain crypto wallet built right into the browser. Web three is freedom from big Tech and Wall street, more control and better privacy.
01:14:22.170 - 01:14:49.794, Speaker A: But there's a weak point in web three. Your crypto wallet and most crypto wallets are browser extensions which can easily be spoofed. But the brave wallet is different. No extensions are required, which gives brave browser an extra level of security versus other wallets. Brave Wallet is your secure passport for the possibilities of web three and supports multiple chains including Ethereum and Salana. You can even buy crypto directly inside the wallet with ramp. And of course you can store, send and swap your crypto assets, manage your nfts and connect to other wallets and DFI apps.
01:14:49.794 - 01:14:59.770, Speaker A: So whether you're new to crypto or you're a seasoned pro, it's time to ditch those risky extensions and it's time to switch to the brave wallet. Download Brave@brave.com slash bankless and click the wallet icon to get started.
01:14:59.840 - 01:15:31.090, Speaker B: Alright guys, we are back. If you have a question for David and I on the weekly roll up, we will answer your question. The way to do that is look for this tweet coming to the bankless HQ Twitter account. Ask you questions here's the first question I'm going to ask you. I think it's the difference between proof of stake and proof of work. This is from I overcomplicated your name, Jeremy. I haven't heard a POS that's proof of stake proponent.
01:15:31.090 - 01:15:56.082, Speaker B: Address this point from proof of work, people. Very well. Proof of stake leads to the rich getting richer within that system. Drake's answer to Alden was surprisingly unsatisfactory. That's Justin Drake in a bankless podcast episode he's referring to. Is this just a trade off that is lived with due to other benefits proof of stake brings? So what of this idea that proof of stake is just the rich getting richer David?
01:15:56.166 - 01:16:20.658, Speaker A: Yeah. Also on the topic of talking points that bitcoin maximalists talk about all the time, this is one of those things like, proof of stake is just like the rich get richer paradigm. They also call it like, this is a fiat paradigm. It's like the people with a bigger stake have the bigger say. That's all totally, completely wrong. It's like such a swing and a miss. And so I'll do my best to summarize it here to the question of which one has higher returns on capital.
01:16:20.658 - 01:16:46.122, Speaker A: The cool thing about proof of stake is we know exactly how big the returns on capital are. Right now, I think the stake rate is 4.2%. Post merge, it'll jump up to seven and then it'll come back down. It'll be some sort of equilibrium between like 5%, five, 6%, four to 6%. We don't really know until it happens. But like four to 6% ballpark year over year returns on ether. So that is how much capital begets capital in the world of proof of stake.
01:16:46.122 - 01:17:38.778, Speaker A: In proof of work, people don't associate with capital begetting capital, because there's this work word and you have to do work in order to mine the blockchain, but you're not really doing work, you're just racing to consume as much electricity as possible. The cool thing about proof of stake is that it cuts out so many middlemen that preserve the ability for individuals to actually participate in this game. In the world of proof of stake, there are so many middlemen that separate $1 from turning into one dollars worth of security. And this is really the thing you need to optimize for, is if you have $1 of capital, how do you produce $1 worth of security? And proof of stake is going to direct coupling those things directly. Proof of work has so many middlemen that separate $1 worth of capital from $1 of security. So you have like the mining facility, you have to buy all of the hardware. You have to house the hardware in a big facility.
01:17:38.778 - 01:18:11.546, Speaker A: You have to cool the facility. You need a ton of electricity. So like a lot of bitcoin mining facilities build their own power plant. At this point, you need to have supply chains with ASIC manufacturers that starts to be having political connections. Do you have actual political connections to the manufacturers? So you need to invest in all of these things that aren't hash rate. And everything that you have to invest in is a place where economies of scale can be expressed. So the difference is, if you put in $1,000 into ether and you get 6% on your ether year over year.
01:18:11.546 - 01:19:11.850, Speaker A: Or if you put in a billion dollars or a million dollars, like pick your number of digits, everyone gets the exact same amount of interest rate on their ether year over year in proof of work. If you cannot start a proof of work farm with $1,000 or $10,000 or $100,000, you will be completely uncompetitive. So in order to play the game of proof of work like mining, you have to invest tens of millions of dollars into a proof of work mining operation to be viable, because the economies of scale are so incredibly large. And the crazy thing is, if you put in $10 million, you will get some amount of hash rate. But if you put in $100 million, you are going to get far more than ten times the amount of hash rate because it favors capital. And so the returns on proof of work, on capital investments into proof of work mining, are far greater than 6%. It's something like 50 to 100% to 150%, depending on how professional your mining operation is.
01:19:11.850 - 01:19:50.194, Speaker A: So compare the proof of the six to 7% yield on proof of stake to the 50% to 150% yield on a bitcoin proof of work mining operation. That is the rich get richer model. And so the only reason why people think that it's proof of stake is because it's actually formally a part of the actual system. It's like, yes, you get compound interest. And people are like, oh, compound interest, that's the rich get richer. No, I'm sorry, who is cutting 100 million? Are you cutting $100 million or $10 million? Ppm private place memorandum for your bitcoin mining operation? No, you're not only the Richard doing that end rant.
01:19:50.322 - 01:19:59.750, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree with all of that. And here's, I guess, one way to think of it. So first of all, it's important to acknowledge both systems are the rich get richer.
01:19:59.830 - 01:20:00.460, Speaker A: Right?
01:20:00.830 - 01:20:14.800, Speaker B: A capital system is the rich get richer. But proof of work is like ten times worse than proof of stake. I would say larger than that, maybe larger. But like proof of stake is actually an improvement on the rich get richer. It's not as bad.
01:20:15.170 - 01:20:25.666, Speaker A: It's literally the minimization of rich get richer. Because again, if you have 32 ETh or 3200 ETh or 32,000 ETh, you get the same amount of yield no matter what.
01:20:25.768 - 01:20:55.130, Speaker B: It's kind of like the rich get richer in the same way that investing in an ideal world, treasuries or sovereign bonds are the rich get richer. It's sort of like that that's one important part. And then the other important part to understand is proof of work is just proof of stake with extra steps. Right? And so here's what we mean. Here's what you're saying here is like, in both cases it requires capital. Okay, and what are these ASIC machines that you're using? They're tokens.
01:20:55.210 - 01:20:57.658, Speaker A: They're forced alignment to the protocol.
01:20:57.754 - 01:21:21.302, Speaker B: Yes, except these tokens are much harder to get. And I'm talking about the ASICs. You wouldn't think of them as, you think of them as hardware, computer hardware in the real world. They're like tokens. They're units of capital to charge. And so if you think of them as physical tokens, essentially the difference between buying an ASIC and putting it in a massive data center like the supply chain, you have to have connections like.
01:21:21.356 - 01:21:23.846, Speaker A: Energy manufacturing, you have to be a.
01:21:23.868 - 01:21:46.206, Speaker B: Company and a very sophisticated company with business development team, with location, with physical space in order to do that, versus with Ethereum and any staking network you can buy your token on freaking Uniswap, that's your unit of capital. How much more accessible is that? I think that is another important difference to understand.
01:21:46.308 - 01:22:13.510, Speaker A: And so I think the counterargument will be like, oh yeah, bitcoin miners, they have to expend all of this extra money. You have to expend your rewards to buy the ASICs. You have to expend your rewards to pay for the mining operations. You have to expend the rewards to pay for energy. That is risk, and that is baked into the returns. And so actually, the more risk that there is, the more expenses there are. The only reason why people are going to do that are because the returns are literally higher as a result of that risk.
01:22:14.330 - 01:22:17.574, Speaker B: Yeah, totally. Well, I think we've talked about that.
01:22:17.612 - 01:22:29.798, Speaker A: For, we get excited talking about that. I wrote an article covering this called four misconceptions between proof of work, proof of stake. That in my mind, I think is the clearest articulation into these arguments. So if you want to explore that more, go read that article.
01:22:29.974 - 01:22:44.302, Speaker B: I'm going to make a big mistake and ask you another question that you're probably equally passionate about, which is my question for you, David. What does David have against carbs? Ryan, Sean Adams asked this question for the roll up. What do you have against carbs, man?
01:22:44.436 - 01:23:04.418, Speaker A: Okay, so people not on crypto Twitter, I just randomly decided to pick up this anti carb campaign and it actually caught a lot of my followers by surprise. Like, oh, david read like a magazine on keto, and now he's like a keto maximalist. People don't actually know that. I actually studied this in college and consulted on it for a couple of years after school, so I have this in my background.
01:23:04.514 - 01:23:06.070, Speaker B: You're really against carbs?
01:23:06.490 - 01:23:06.806, Speaker A: No.
01:23:06.828 - 01:23:07.014, Speaker B: Okay.
01:23:07.052 - 01:23:08.414, Speaker A: No, that's mostly a meme.
01:23:08.482 - 01:23:09.002, Speaker B: Okay.
01:23:09.136 - 01:23:58.662, Speaker A: The typical american diet is something like 70% carbs, 20% fats, and 10% proteins. When the optimum balanced diet is something like 50% to 60% fats, like 20%, 40 to 50% to 60% fats, like 20 ish percent protein, and, like, 20% carbs, that is actually a true balanced diet, like, heavily weighted in fats and not nearly as much weighted in carbs. The crazy thing is, in the same way that the government controls the price of the dollar, they're also controlling the price of corn. The reason why there's literally high fructose corn syrup in everything is because corn making high fructose corn syrup is basically free. And there's nothing worse for you than goddamn high fructose corn syrup. It's literally everywhere. It's complete.
01:23:58.662 - 01:24:21.760, Speaker A: So it's sugar. It's a big filler, and it's also highly addictive. You know what's a great business model, Ryan? Carbs. Everyone's addicted to them. They show know carbs show up in the brain. They fire the brain, the parts of the areas of the brain that the same place that cocaine and heroin do, and just as much sugar does, like, absolutely crazy. So it's a crazy business model.
01:24:21.760 - 01:24:31.790, Speaker A: We're suing that one family for getting everyone addicted to painkillers. The big food industry is doing the same thing with carbs. You're just addicted to carbs.
01:24:31.950 - 01:24:34.302, Speaker B: Carbs are the opioids that no one notices. David.
01:24:34.366 - 01:24:35.154, Speaker A: That's exactly right.
01:24:35.192 - 01:24:49.800, Speaker B: Dude, I don't want to get you started on this, okay? Because it's a long. I can tell you've got a lot to say. Bankless nation. Who would enjoy an episode on bankless? Maybe some side stream or something with David on nutrition? Because I would actually like to school up with you.
01:24:50.330 - 01:24:51.546, Speaker A: I've already got it in the works.
01:24:51.648 - 01:24:52.282, Speaker B: It's already happening.
01:24:52.336 - 01:25:26.306, Speaker A: Yeah. So there's this guy who I listen to, Anthony Gustain. He would do the Perfect Keto podcast, which is now rebranded into something else anyways, the way that this is not just like David going rogue and doing a nutrition podcast. The world of agriculture and sustainable agriculture is very much tied to decentralization, whereas we have highly centralized production of corn and factory farmed meats, which are terrible, both for your health and for the animal. And everything is super centralized. We can't live on this planet that way. It can't work that way.
01:25:26.306 - 01:26:04.046, Speaker A: We're going to kill the planet. What does make us work on this planet is sustainable agriculture, which is inherently tied into the concept of decentralization, like robust, antifragile, fragile harmony with nature. Farms that are distributed all across the world in a very decentralized manner, that is in harmony with nature, that is robust, that is longevity, especially as global supply chains break down and we can't cooperate with Europe or China or anything. We need local, at home, decentralized, sustainable agriculture, food production, which Ryan is. Veggies and meat. Veggies and meat. I have opinions on this thing.
01:26:04.068 - 01:26:09.154, Speaker B: All right, David, doing a nutrition podcast is just about the most bear market thing I could think of.
01:26:09.192 - 01:26:12.242, Speaker A: Right. Personally, end the bear market with.
01:26:12.296 - 01:26:28.326, Speaker B: I am somehow intrigued by it, and I want to learn more. Last thing here is there was some talk of David doing a dance. So Anthony Sassano, he was supposed to do a dance at a certain point when eth hit a price point and think that price point was hit, what was that? Was that like 1000?
01:26:28.428 - 01:26:34.986, Speaker A: I think it was all time high by the end of 2020. And we hit that 2020, and we hit.
01:26:35.008 - 01:26:38.010, Speaker B: And he didn't pay his debt. He didn't do the dance.
01:26:38.750 - 01:26:39.686, Speaker A: Twitter. A dance.
01:26:39.798 - 01:26:48.794, Speaker B: This is David Hoffman, my co host here. Okay? Not just a Nutrition podcast, not just a crypto expert, but apparently you know how to do the Napoleon dynamite dance.
01:26:48.922 - 01:26:50.400, Speaker A: You're not doing it here.
01:26:50.770 - 01:27:12.466, Speaker B: You have to learn first. David says this. If eth hits all time high by end of 2023, not 2022, 2020, 318 months. Here, I'll do the Napoleon dynamite dance to clear Anthony Cesano's debts to crypto Twitter. Crypto Twitter must agree to these terms. I wholeheartedly agree, sir. That's getting a retweet.
01:27:12.466 - 01:27:17.270, Speaker B: I agree to these terms. I'm writing it down. This means you are doing this. David.
01:27:20.010 - 01:27:39.310, Speaker A: Anthony has said that he's okay with this, but also, this is a debt to crypto Twitter. So Anthony owes this to crypto Twitter. I'm saying I will pay back Anthony's debts, but crypto Twitter has to agree. I don't really know how to get consensus by crypto Twitter. So maybe you do what Ryan did and go to this tweet and say, like, I agree to these terms, or I do not agree to these terms.
01:27:39.380 - 01:27:41.370, Speaker B: Consensus. Everyone wants this, David.
01:27:41.450 - 01:27:43.998, Speaker A: I've only heard of, like, three people that have said that they agree.
01:27:44.084 - 01:27:48.974, Speaker B: Okay, what's the threshold for crypto twittering? Twitter agreeing to these terms?
01:27:49.092 - 01:27:50.202, Speaker A: 50 comments.
01:27:50.346 - 01:27:51.210, Speaker B: 50 comments.
01:27:51.290 - 01:27:55.442, Speaker A: 50 comments saying I agree. And it has to be like a 90 to ten ratio of yes, the nose.
01:27:55.506 - 01:28:04.886, Speaker B: All right, guys, I'm going to tweet this out. 50 comments. You heard it on the roll up, so make sure we want to see David do this dance. We'll broadcast this on the roll up clip as well. All right.
01:28:04.988 - 01:28:08.600, Speaker A: It's a good thing that ether is not going to hit an all time high by 2023.
01:28:09.130 - 01:28:40.290, Speaker B: Really? That's also the most bear market thing I've heard David say spicy Vitalik is the best. Vitalik. All right, what is he saying here? He's pushing back on the whole ethereum is a security talk that was going around here. I'll read his first tweet and then you read a second. It's amazing how some proof of work proponents just keep repeating the unmitigated bare faced lie that proof of stake includes voting on protocol parameters. That's one of the arguments for why ethereum should be a security. You can use eth to vote and you actually can't.
01:28:40.290 - 01:29:05.814, Speaker B: False. It doesn't, just like proof of work doesn't. And this so often just goes unchallenged. Nodes reject invalid blocks in proof of stake and in proof of work, it's not hard. And he follows this up because he is, quote tweeting someone who says the fact that you can vote on something to change its properties is proof that it's a security. Love bitcoin. Vitalik says a small grammar nuance in English when talking about things like proof of stake.
01:29:05.814 - 01:29:15.246, Speaker B: We don't say it's a security, we say it's secure. I know these suffixes are hard though, so I forgive the spicy take which.
01:29:15.268 - 01:29:51.638, Speaker A: Is saying like, hey, you bitcoiners who think that ether is a security because of proof of stake, no, it's extra secure, unlike the proof of work hard cap model, which is destined to run out of security budget. This was what I was going back earlier, where people think that people associate proof of stake with governance because your stake determines the next block. But no, your 32 ether is an ASIC. What determines the rules and the update to the rules are people that download and update their nodes. Just like in bitcoin is running node operators. You do not need to stake to update your nodes or determine the future direction of the blockchain. Node operators do this, you don't have.
01:29:51.644 - 01:29:59.340, Speaker B: To have money, you don't have to have any. Well, all you have to do is be able to run a node on a machine, and then you are essentially validating. Yes.
01:29:59.790 - 01:30:11.754, Speaker A: So here's the last take that we'll give. I think that's the last take. No, we got one more. This is me, and I say how to become a millionaire. This is it. This is going to work. Everyone who's listening to this, who follows this, can become a millionaire.
01:30:11.754 - 01:30:40.050, Speaker A: Hopefully 50% chance. Number one, stick around and pay attention during the bear market. Number two, that's it. That's all you do. That's all you do. So, yeah, I mean, the whole idea is that alpha is generated in the bear market. The people that stuck around during the 2018 to 2020 bear market, they got to participate in DFI summer, which was like, I don't know about you, Ryan, but DFI Summer was way more lucrative than 2021.
01:30:40.050 - 01:31:05.870, Speaker A: There was just, like, money being printed everywhere. It was super fun. The vibes were really good. And then also people who were participated in DFI summer, they knew the bull market was on, like, a whole twelve months before. Other people that had left during the bear market or people who didn't know about crypto. So we knew that the 2021 bull market was going to happen in April of 2020. And so we had, like, six months, nine months to front run everyone else.
01:31:06.020 - 01:31:17.566, Speaker B: Yeah, totally. You got to stick around in order to do that. I have a third way to become a millionaire, though. David, listen to me. 10% inflation for the next decade. Everyone gets to be a millionaire. Like the US dollar is eroding.
01:31:17.566 - 01:31:30.330, Speaker B: That fast. Exactly. Nice. All right, final take for you. This is a whole letter from Pantera. We can't read the letter in this take, of course, but I think the synopsis is the title. Defi worked great.
01:31:30.330 - 01:31:58.674, Speaker B: All of CFI was failing all around us. Defi worked great. Dan from Pantera Capital pushes back against the idea that has become a narrative somehow that Celsius and Blockfi, all of these were like Defi. And here's an article he's pointing to. Defi has an existential problem. No, Defi worked incredibly well during this downturn, and he pushes back on all of that. So I'll leave that for your homework while I ask David the question we end these episodes with.
01:31:58.674 - 01:32:00.580, Speaker B: What are you bullish on this week, my friend?
01:32:02.150 - 01:32:04.340, Speaker A: Am I allowed to leak some?
01:32:05.030 - 01:32:06.130, Speaker B: Certainly, yeah.
01:32:06.200 - 01:32:06.434, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:32:06.472 - 01:32:09.190, Speaker B: You mean the alpha. Is it something I've heard?
01:32:09.340 - 01:32:10.342, Speaker A: Yeah. You know all about?
01:32:10.396 - 01:32:12.374, Speaker B: I know about this leak away.
01:32:12.412 - 01:32:34.190, Speaker A: Then, for the first time ever, there is more being built at bankless behind the scenes than out in public. Like, usually almost everything we do is completely in public. Like, 95% of bankless is out in public. Just like the discord and coordination. The 5% of coordination, that's, like, in private. For the first time ever, there's, like, more stuff being built in private that we've got in secret than it was in public.
01:32:34.340 - 01:32:35.438, Speaker B: I feel teased, sir. Yeah.
01:32:35.444 - 01:32:35.898, Speaker A: Do you feel teased?
01:32:35.914 - 01:32:36.622, Speaker B: Are you teasing me?
01:32:36.676 - 01:32:37.742, Speaker A: I'm teasing you.
01:32:37.876 - 01:32:45.326, Speaker B: You're teasing the victim. Is it working? Well, I know what's going on, so it's not working on me, but, yeah, that would pique my interest.
01:32:45.428 - 01:32:46.030, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:32:46.180 - 01:32:47.822, Speaker B: When am I going to find out more, David?
01:32:47.966 - 01:33:04.934, Speaker A: Well, there's. Well, there's a number of different things. There's this one thing that is happening, and then there's this other thing that's happening, and then there's the third thing, which is a bankless studio, which most people know about, but they don't know to the degree of how awesome it's going to be. So there's, there. I teased one of the three things.
01:33:05.052 - 01:33:08.610, Speaker B: There you go. We got some stuff coming. Is what David's saying in the pipeline.
01:33:08.690 - 01:33:10.300, Speaker A: Yeah. Ryan, what are you excited about?
01:33:10.910 - 01:33:12.934, Speaker B: I'm excited about the universe, David.
01:33:12.982 - 01:33:13.338, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:33:13.424 - 01:33:33.354, Speaker B: And I mean this literally this time. So you can't talk about my deep thoughts are weird. The James Webb telescope. Okay. This has been a project that's been, like, over a decade long, and it launched last December. I've been following this. This is the only thing I might be more excited about than the ethereum merge.
01:33:33.354 - 01:33:34.730, Speaker B: It might be. Probably not.
01:33:34.820 - 01:33:37.540, Speaker A: I've got nutrition. You've got deep space.
01:33:37.910 - 01:33:57.094, Speaker B: Deep freaking space. Yes. And the James Webb telescope. And so you guys probably saw this. The pictures were all over the place. Pictures came back from the first pictures from the James Webb telescope, and they are absolutely phenomenal. Okay, we're looking at here is like some of these stars, David, are just 500 million years old.
01:33:57.094 - 01:34:15.530, Speaker B: Okay. We are looking back deeper in space than we ever have. That's like 95% through the timeline of the universe. That's how far back we are looking here. And it just blows my mind. There's tons of stuff you can find. R space is full of these images if you want to get super geeky.
01:34:15.530 - 01:34:55.818, Speaker B: But I think I have a crypto take here, too, which is like, this is a 2022 thing that I think the world needed and I think we needed because, first of all, what is the James Webb telescope? Well, it's a public good. This is open source knowledge that we can now share across the Internet. It's kind of like some of the things that we're building in crypto, and that's amazing in and of itself. It's also a massive engineering undertaking that has taken over a decade. This project was far more complicated than anything humanity has ever launched into space. Just the level of detail and planning and everything had to go right in order for the mirrors to unfold. It's just an incredible story.
01:34:55.818 - 01:35:27.700, Speaker B: And that we were able to do this as a species is absolutely phenomenal. We have a giant eyeball apparatus in space now, and that's cool also. This is like scientific discovery. And as we know, it's like science, technology. That is the way we actually progress, right? These inflation cycles, these monetary policy things. That's not actually doing anything for progressing and improving humanity and quality of life for humans in the short run. The way we improve quality of life is through technology.
01:35:27.700 - 01:35:51.242, Speaker B: That's the thing that always works, and we need science in order to do that. And then this gives me, like, a new perspective. It gives people a new perspective on the universe. And it's a time where there's wars happening, there's conflict everywhere. No one can get it along. And this is something that we coordinated on to launch into space. I don't know, it's just a breath of fresh air in the feel like we really needed that.
01:35:51.242 - 01:35:53.594, Speaker B: That's my take on the telescope and why it's important.
01:35:53.712 - 01:36:17.170, Speaker A: I love it. One thing I've been thinking about a lot lately is that while there's so much short term bearishness and because of the recession that is about to happen to us and all of our assets are down bad, everyone's focused on the next one to two years. Like, how do I make sure I get to one of these two years? And then there's even greater stuff like that. Like global geopolitical things are totally going to shift. The world's going to look super different. The dollar is about to collapse. Like all the short term.
01:36:17.170 - 01:36:45.630, Speaker A: Short term in the grand scheme of things, like bearish stuff that damn, we're going to have to the whole fourth turning thing, there's this big world transition that we're about to go through. But on the other side of that, there's like this space race that's about to trigger. There's like, this metaverse that's about to develop. There's like, biohacking and gene editing that is on the cusp of exploding. There are so many cool things ahead of us, and they're all positioned to be the thing that pulls us out of this, just like crazy, terrible global reshuffling that we're about to go through.
01:36:45.780 - 01:36:52.926, Speaker B: Yeah, I totally agree. I mean, bullish humanity over the long run. Always, right? Bullish humanity. Meme of the week.
01:36:52.948 - 01:37:28.102, Speaker A: David, what do we mean this week? Yeah, this is Mike three at enjoyor. On Twitter says bass carbon working on a dank playlist. And the playlist is titled Three Arrows Capital Three, AC. And it's song one, can I borrow a dollar? Song two, I need some money, song three, give me your money song four, money, that's what I want, Chuck Brown. Song five, we need some money, song six, can I borrow a dollar again? Song seven, spare some change? Eight, can I borrow a dollar? Nine, can I get some money? Yeah, three arrows capital is down bad. Oh, it keeps on going. It keeps on going.
01:37:28.102 - 01:37:31.520, Speaker A: I need money, can I borrow a dollar? I need money again I need money, give me money, money.
01:37:32.610 - 01:37:47.786, Speaker B: Oops, oops. That's it. That's capital playlist. If you're into that kind of listening, then we'll include a link where you can find that on Spotify. Guys, as always, none of this has been financial advice. Crypto is risky. ETH is risky.
01:37:47.786 - 01:37:55.954, Speaker B: So is bitcoin. You could definitely lose what you put in. But we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone. But we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
