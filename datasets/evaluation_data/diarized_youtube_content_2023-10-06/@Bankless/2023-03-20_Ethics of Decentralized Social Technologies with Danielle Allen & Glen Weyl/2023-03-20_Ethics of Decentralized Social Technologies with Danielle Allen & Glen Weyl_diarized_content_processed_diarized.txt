00:00:05.850 - 00:00:15.066, Speaker A: What up, coordination? Today on the pod, I've got Danielle Allen and Glenn Weil. We're two of the co authors on a new paper entitled Ethics of Decentralized.
00:00:15.258 - 00:00:15.886, Speaker B: Excuse me?
00:00:15.908 - 00:01:02.266, Speaker A: Decentralized Social Technologies lessons from Web Three. The Fediverse and beyond. Glenn and Danielle have co authored the paper with Eli Frankel, Wujin Lim Did Siddharth, and Josh Simmons. Hopefully I pronounced everyone's names correctly. Danielle is a professor of political philosophy, ethics and public policy at Harvard University. Glenn is research lead at Microsoft Research and the special project of the Plural Social Technology collaboratory, the founder of Radical Exchange and the Plurality Institute, and the author of the book Radical Markets. Glenn, Danielle and their co authors are contributors to the Getting Plurality Research Network at Harvard's Edmund and Lily Safra Center for Ethics that is being launched today in collaboration and support from Glenn's project at Microsoft.
00:01:02.266 - 00:01:55.630, Speaker A: So as they co author this paper, they are treating it as a founding document for that project. I wanted to have them on the podcast because Glenn's work has been an inspiration for me. Back when I founded Gitcoin, it was built on top of quadratic funding, which is something that Zoe Hitzig and Vitalik Butter and Glenn invented together. And I also just wanted to have Danielle and Glenn on the Pod as I think their paper will be foundational for the Web Three transition to a more regenerative and ethical economy as it grows and matures. So this podcast is all about ethics of decentralized social technologies. We talk about web three's constitutional moment. Basically, constitutional moments are moments that lead to the transformation of a social platform, e g like the US constitution being built on a social platform structured by the economics, demographics, and technological facts of the late 18th century.
00:01:55.630 - 00:02:42.474, Speaker A: So this is a similar constitutional moment, we think, for Web three prudent vigilance, which is basically being explicit about goals and offering justifications as we build projects, having governance structures to oversee the design and evaluation of experiments. And then we also talk about just the values that Glenn and Danielle and their co authors have brought from traditional political philosophy around human flourishing. Things like non domination, things like individual community, self determination, egalitarian. Pluralism, coordination, capacity, collective ownership, and regenerative economies. So I really just enjoy every conversation I have with Glenn and Danielle. They're such rich, deep thinkers. And I think that this paper can be a foundational part of the plural and regenerative Web Three movement.
00:02:42.474 - 00:02:55.246, Speaker A: So that's why I was really excited to have them on the Pod, and I think that's why you're really going to enjoy this episode. So, coordination, please enjoy this podcast episode on ethics of decentralized social technologies with Glenn and Danielle.
00:02:55.358 - 00:03:47.342, Speaker C: Working in Web Three is awesome, but working outside of the typical W two employee structure is a deal breaker for so many. Opolis is helping the self sovereign worker focus on what they do best their work. Tax time is coming up opolis helps professionalize your business by helping you form an entity, generate proof of employment through Pay subs and receive a W two at the end of the tax year.

As the market cap of Glow goes up, extreme poverty goes down. Glow is a dollar backed nonprofit stablecoin that creates basic income for people living in extreme poverty. Glow is basically the same business model as USDC, with yield generating treasuries on one side and a stablecoin on ethereum on the other. But instead of being a for profit company, glow is a nonprofit that donates 100% of all yields from the Glow Reserve to Give Directly's basic Income Program.
00:04:26.798 - 00:04:47.990, Speaker C: Give Directly is a charity that gives people money, no strings attached to people living in poverty, and is a charity that Vitalik has previously donated to and supported in the past. With Glow, you can reduce poverty just by holding a stablecoin. Glow is launching in early 2023 and you can join the waitlist@glowdollar.org. Greenpill. That's GL odollar.org greenpill.
00:04:50.010 - 00:04:51.980, Speaker A: Hey, Glenn. Hey, Danielle. How you doing?
00:04:52.590 - 00:04:55.020, Speaker D: Hi, Kevin. Good to be with you.
00:04:55.550 - 00:05:09.130, Speaker A: So glad to have you. So really excited about this new paper that you released. Can you tell me about the Plural Technology Collaboratory and what led you and your co authors to write this paper on ethics of decentralized social tech? Go ahead, Glenn.
00:05:09.210 - 00:06:43.290, Speaker B: So, the Plural Technology Collaboratory is a new special project at Microsoft Research, bringing together people throughout Microsoft Research, throughout the rest of Microsoft, and a number of partners, including Danielle's Group at Harvard, folks at MIT, at Berkeley on Ventures, and others. And what we're really trying to focus on has shifted a little bit. So when we started, we were originally the decentralized social technology Collaboratory, and our mission was to deal with the social legitimacy issues that got in the way of many folks adopting Web Three technology. Recently, we've rebranded Plural Technology Collaboratory and we're responding to the moment with generative foundation models. These large AI models like Chat GBT that a lot of people have been interacting with, which we believe are going to create an environment where a lot of the challenges that people in Web Three face are faced by the broader society. And we're trying to scale up some of the insights from the Web Three community to meet those challenges. And one way that we're doing that is we're trying to involve folks like Danielle and her colleagues at Harvard and elsewhere who bring that depth of philosophical and social insight that we need to confront these enormous challenges.
00:06:43.290 - 00:06:53.614, Speaker B: And I'll let Danielle speak to that, and then maybe she can speak to what interested in her in working with us on this paper. Great, thanks.
00:06:53.732 - 00:07:54.420, Speaker D: Yes. So we are launching we have just launched a new research network at the Edmund and Lily Safford Center for Ethics. The network is called Getting Plurality, and that stands for governance of emerging technology and technology for next generation governance through plurality. So we share Glenn's sense that a plural approach, plural technologies, a focus on plurality is really important for changing the direction of technology development and ensuring that we can build and use technologies that are supportive of democracy and other human goods. So we've pulled together a real multidisciplinary network. A core group of us have been working over the last nine months on this paper that we're also releasing today, the Decentralized Social technologies paper, the Ethics for DSTs. So we're really excited about this, and it really takes people from all disciplines philosophy, political science, economics, as well as technologists to face the hard questions we've got right now.
00:07:54.870 - 00:08:27.406, Speaker B: Kevin, would it be useful for me to say a little bit about what plurality is and where that catchphrase comes from? Yes, please do. I think that yeah, go ahead. So I'm writing a book right now with Audrey Tong. It's a Git based open collaboration that I hope many of people in the community will participate in. And it's called plurality. That's a term that Audrey uses to represent her vision for the future of technology. Audrey is the digital Minister of Taiwan, and there's a lot to say about it.
00:08:27.406 - 00:09:32.690, Speaker B: You and I have gone back and forth about it for a long time. But I think a simple way to think about it is that there's kind of two dominant visions for the future of technology today. One is very sort of individualistic. It's about money and markets, and it's very dominant in the crypto world. There's a second vision that's about powerful AI systems replacing the need for an economy, replacing the need for work, et cetera. And what we believe is that there's a better third vision that emphasizes social diversity, a diverse range of commons cooperation across social differences, but also that supports and maintains and actually proliferates those social differences rather than just sort of washing them away into a global system. So anyways, there's a lot to be said about that, but that's the basic frame that both the effort at Microsoft and the effort that Danielle is highlighting at Harvard is trying to adopt.
00:09:32.690 - 00:09:36.974, Speaker B: Amazing. Anything to add there, Danielle?
00:09:37.022 - 00:09:37.538, Speaker A: Go ahead.
00:09:37.624 - 00:09:37.922, Speaker B: Thanks.
00:09:37.976 - 00:10:01.018, Speaker D: Yeah, I would just add one thing. That was a great description, Glenn. The other piece that I always like to include is the point that human intelligence is plural. There are plural intelligences. And so the amplitude of human intelligence really requires recognizing that plurality and building from it and in support of that plurality, not undermining it, eroding it, homogenizing it, and so forth.
00:10:01.114 - 00:10:33.190, Speaker B: And even human is perhaps just one part of it. These machines as well, we should think of as diverse as containing many different systems at many different scales, not as sort of homogeneous black boxes that bring down some quantity called power or intelligence to be used for any purpose. And that's something that we should desire and seek to proliferate as we build technology, whether it be in human systems or beyond.
00:10:33.690 - 00:10:45.260, Speaker A: So I really encourage everyone to go read the paper, but I'm wondering if we could tee off the episode with a short summary or TLDR of the paper. How is it organized and what were the main messages you wanted to get across?
00:10:46.350 - 00:11:38.858, Speaker D: Sure, maybe I'll jump in and then Glenn can add as well as he sees fit. So the first and most important point is to say that recent technological developments do rise to the level of a constitutional moment. There's been a lot of controversy over how important are decentralized social technologies, how important are generative foundation models? And the paper is mostly focused on DSOC, so blockchain feta verse a little bit. Blockchain is the sort of main example, but the takeaway is, yes, it is a constitutional moment. The kinds of things these new technologies can do go to foundational elements of how society is structured. They affect core elements of how property operates, core elements of how identity operates, and the like. And changes at that level will have fundamental impacts over time.
00:11:38.858 - 00:12:13.266, Speaker D: We may not have seen those fundamental impacts yet. This is not to say that cryptocurrency as such is the fundamental impact, but the underlying technologies are transformative at a sort of deep constitutive level. So that's .1. And so then .2 is what's an ethics for developing such technologies when the impacts are so substantial. We draw on some preexisting examples from bioethics, sort of explore the landscape of how people have built different frameworks, precautionary principle and the like. And we land on a recommendation for what we call prudent vigilance.
00:12:13.266 - 00:13:23.510, Speaker D: Prudent vigilance is a framework where you expect experimentalism. You're not trying to block it, you're not trying to make sure that you know in advance that no harm will come, but you are building in processes to look for near term and long term downstream consequences, harms and so forth, and building in processes and practices as part of the technology development to mitigate those risks. And then, of course, there's also the question of can we take new technologies with constitutive power and not just avoid the harms that they cause, but also in fact, deploy them to positive ends. So in some sense, the really important part of the paper finally is a picture of human flourishing and a vision for what we call either plural or plurality based or power sharing liberalism. It is exactly the directions that we articulate with the plurality concept to start and the question is how can technology be used in this direction? Then the question of are there key technonormative concepts that are pertinent here, whether it's trustlessness, for example, or any of the others? And how do they map on to the values that we should want to bring to using technologies in this space? I'm sure Glenn has lots to add, so let me pass it over to Glenn.
00:13:23.590 - 00:14:36.530, Speaker B: I would just elaborate on Danielle's points which I actually think were really the right ones. One thing I would say is there's sort of a pull element which Danielle emphasized, like what is it that decentralized social technologies are empowering us to do? There's also a push element which is that I increasingly believe that with the rise of powerful AI systems, many of the legacy systems that Web Three has proposed itself as potential alternative to are simply just not going to be sustainable. I think a lot of the authentication that we've relied on, whether it be CAPTCHAs or talking to a loved one, is going to be very easily replicable. And so people are going to have to increasingly rely on these more sophisticated approaches, whether or not they prefer them, because other forms of digital authentication are going to evaporate. And so I think these technologies are going to be put in center stage one way or the other. So it's important that we find what can be valuable about them. The second thing I'd say is just to make an analogy to Danielle's idea of Prudent vigilance for the context that's probably more familiar to your listeners.
00:14:36.530 - 00:15:33.030, Speaker B: I think of it as a little bit being the ethics equivalent of the Lean Startup methodology. So in the Lean Startup methodology, you neither have a plan that you're going to execute based on a careful analysis of every contingency, nor do you have just like you're sticking to the way that things have always been done. Both of those are inimical to this Lean Startup methodology. And within ethics those roughly correspond to what's called utilitarianism and deontology. Utilitarianism is about like calculating everything out and making the best plan. And deontology is all about following the rules. Prudent vigilance or Lean Startup methodology, is about deliberately experimenting with something, trying to get as much information from that experiment as you can, and being ready to quickly pivot away from mistakes and towards potential.
00:15:33.030 - 00:16:03.870, Speaker B: And that's not a framework that's I think been translated fully to the ethics world. And I think one thing that is exciting, beyond the applications here, which Danielle got at nicely, is there's also an insight for ethical theory here, which is about how to take some of the lessons that have been learned. In the technology world and bring them to how we approach ethics in a context that requires that, where there's this constant change in the environment partly driven by our own actions.
00:16:04.530 - 00:16:49.120, Speaker A: What stands out for me, Glenn, as I hear you talk about this prudent vigilance in this constitutional moment, is just all the foundational impacts of Web Three decentralized social technologies that you identified in the paper, you and your co authors identified in the paper. And they're pretty foundational parts of society. Titling and validation, notaries public identification systems, fund transfers, media social media governance and voting rewarding, digital labor property relationships, dispute resolution. So it feels like the stakes are pretty high here to get this right. Can you say more about what you would like to see in the Web Three ecosystem based off of what you've unveiled in this paper?
00:16:49.810 - 00:18:29.134, Speaker B: So to me, the real challenge in the coming years for the Web Three ecosystem is going to be how to very rapidly be able to mainstream things at much lower cost and much greater accessibility and much greater sort. Of integration with mainstream values than has been achieved to date, and how to do that very quickly without necessarily a ton of money backing it up. And it's going to be a very interesting moment. So to take an example from what you gave, suppose that Generative AI advances very rapidly and this has widescale impacts on creators and people standard means of earning livelihood, just sort of evaporates very quickly for a large segment of the population. Obviously, there's been a lot of exploring using things like NFTs alternatives to that. That was kind of an interesting sideshow. But there's a chance that that might become one of the primary possible sources of income for a significant chunk of people, and I don't think the system is really prepared for that.
00:18:29.134 - 00:19:04.700, Speaker B: I don't think NFTs have stabilized or come to a point that's socially legitimate or that is sort of consistent with the rest of society in a way that allows them to become a foundation for that many people's income, but they might have to. So that's going to be, I think, a huge demand and it's going to require the cooperation of lots of different parts of society, including governments, that have generally taken either a sort of reactive or a standoffish position with regards to this space.
00:19:06.910 - 00:19:59.770, Speaker D: I think I would double click on Glenn's comment about the need for integration with some sense mainstream norms, values and expectations in various ways. For me, this is particularly true around the concept of governance. So I think Web Three technologies do provide innovative governance resources and tools, but at the same time, there's lots of sort of old fashioned kind of governance protocols that would have been relevant, for example, to the Sam Bankman Freed collapse. They lacked basic governance things that people actually have known how to do for centuries. So I see the sort of fusion of some of the sort of old school thinking about governance with enablement through web Three technologies as really promising. And I hope that there's a sort of openness to that kind of project of integration.
00:20:02.910 - 00:20:51.080, Speaker B: Glenn, anything to add there? Yeah, I mean, governance there's a lot to say about governance. Governance is going to be a fascinating challenge. I've been working on some very out there governance stuff for a while, and often pointing to Taiwan's example as one that's really impressive. But I've increasingly come to think that even stuff that's well beyond what's going on in Taiwan may be relatively short term necessary just to deal with some of these challenges that I was going to be really an interesting there's a challenge in that.
00:20:52.350 - 00:21:42.578, Speaker D: To date, so much of the energy has been directed towards defining how the various web three technologies can be used to generate value in an often frothy way, right? And instead of asking the question of which collective action problems or social organization sort of roadblocks or obstacles could these technologies resolve? And the truth of the matter is that there ought to be sort of value along those pathways as well and reward for pursuing them. But the structure of activity hasn't really directed energy in that way. So that's sort of the question for me is how to get people sort of directed towards seeing the potential for positive social impact and exploring points of application where that could be realized.
00:21:42.674 - 00:22:37.900, Speaker B: I mean, people always say that fear and greed are the two great motivators. And I think one interesting thing that may happen in the coming years is the emphasis here may move from greed to fear a little bit. Like if a lot of traditional governance and verification systems begin to fail and the possibilities in this space become fallbacks, things may become very real for people very quickly, for good and for ill. And people may be looking for ways to make things work. That kind of happened to some extent with the Twitter going south under Elon's management, but we might see that at much broader scales for some of these other things. And it might be generative or it might be just as problematic. I'm not sure we'll have to see.
00:22:40.190 - 00:23:33.290, Speaker A: I think regardless, it's in web three's best interest to route capital and talent to decentralized social technologies or web Three projects that can bring the most positive impact in the world. This is one of the things I talk about a lot in my work, is how do we rotate capital and talent from the degen projects to the regen projects? How do we make the market reward ethics? Because I think that once the market's rewarding the type of ethics that you talk about in this paper, then you'll just see a flow of innovation into projects that follow these guidelines and so how do we rotate capital and talent into these type of projects? Because the market learns its lesson after FTX and and after some of the hacks and Ponzi schemes that were part of the last web cycle. What would have to be true for the next cycle of capital and talent to roll into projects that are part of your vision? Maybe I'll go to you first, Danielle.
00:23:33.790 - 00:24:28.070, Speaker D: Yeah, that's a great question. I think that's one we're trying to answer. So one of our projects, this I could kind of put a call out to your listeners honestly, is we're now really trying to identify use cases where people are wrestling with the question of how to structure experimentation and the like. And we are going to be identifying some use cases to dig into, to try to give guidance in that regard. I mean, we're doing some work at the moment on Dows, for instance, because that does seem like there's a lot of sort of promising governance potential there. So we ourselves try to spot the places in the universe where we see pro social benefits flowing and then sort of try to lift them up and elevate them, bring research attention to them, bring sort of validation from the research community about where value is, hoping to some extent to shift the value framework that way. And obviously that can't do it in itself, but it can make a contribution to it.
00:24:28.070 - 00:24:42.978, Speaker D: So that's a big part of it. But I do think identifying the right kinds of problems to solve where there is value on the other side of a solution, even if it is sort of structured somewhat differently than the speculative market structured, value is a part of the know.
00:24:43.064 - 00:25:50.840, Speaker B: The thing that was sort of implicit in Daniel's answer that I would emphasize really comes back to the pluralism point. I think that you get beneficial social change from the intersection of various dysfunctional sectors. So like, the academy has a lot of limitations, governments have a lot of limitations, civil society has a lot of limitations. The market, especially the quite anarchic market in crypto, has a lot of limitations. But out of them together might come something really interesting. So I think one major goal we have with this paper is to welcome into the conversation people from Danielle's academic world and maybe eventually people from politics, to not just talk about what's happening in the space or be pro or anti, but to actually help shape it and to help promote directions for it. And I think that's what we've seen in Taiwan and we've seen for years government investment in fundamental research in all sorts of areas, not so much in this area.
00:25:50.840 - 00:26:16.990, Speaker B: And I'd love if our efforts can help bring some of those other sectors into proactive participation in helping to shape this space. Because I think if the logic of the market is the only logic here, we won't get to good outcomes there have to be a lot of different logics at play that sort of like intertwine with each other to get good outcomes.
00:26:20.290 - 00:26:56.794, Speaker D: Plurality. But also that's what I meant by sort of structure of value that mean Glenn's way of putting it was better that market logics deliver one kind of structure of value, but that's not the only structure of value available to us. And it is true that the kind of intersection of public sector civil society of the market can generate opportunities where there's another sort of pathway to value. It's structured differently than the market would structure it, but it exists. And so being really clear in sort of problem identification, so that we're seeing those problems where solutions of that kind would make a huge difference, is sort of, I think, a really important job.
00:26:56.832 - 00:27:42.530, Speaker B: And I think it's important for people to keep in mind that that's how we got, to the extent we got it at all, decentralization. In web one, it was not primarily driven by hackers who were anti establishment, it was driven by government bureaucrats who were worried about disruption of centralized systems and them working with academics who had been trained in various social thinking and then that eventually offering commercial opportunities to scale it. So it was very much A multi sectoral collaboration. And I think if we want sustainable decentralization, it's critical that we do that again today and rather than just using one way of approaching the problem. Anything to add, danielle?
00:27:42.950 - 00:28:18.990, Speaker D: Well, sometimes I say to people, we get sort of stuck in this kind of false dichotomy between subsidize and privatize, as if those are the only two logics for achieving any major scale transformation. But there's a third logic which I like just reorganize, which is exactly this matter of taking different sort of institutional configurations, realigning them, reorganizing them with each other, so that different kinds of human coordination are possible. And then, boom, huge amounts of value flows from that, provided that the thing you're realigning to achieve is socially useful and valuable.
00:28:19.410 - 00:28:48.060, Speaker A: I'm wondering if you all can tell us about some of the values that you put forth in the paper. Specifically, I'm looking at the human flourishing section, where we talk about things like nondomination individual and community, self determination, egalitarian, pluralism, coordination, capacity, collective ownership. For me, these are new sort of phrases and buzzwords in web three, we talk a lot about decentralization and sometimes public goods. But why these values? Why were these So important to you in writing the paper?
00:28:48.910 - 00:29:16.414, Speaker D: Sure. So I'll jump in on that one for starters. So, over the millennia, political philosophers have put forward any number of different theories of human well being or human flourishing. So this framework represents in some sense, the leading edge. There are a number of different philosophers you can point to around the world. Philip pettit, based mainly in australia. Marcia sen, connected to india, the UK.
00:29:16.414 - 00:30:08.778, Speaker D: And the US. Elizabeth anderson at the University of Michigan myself, all of whom have really dug into the concept of human freedom and human well being and made the case that the richest concept is one that centers an idea of nondomination. So it's a contrast between the idea that freedom is just freedom from interference. The government should always just leave you alone. Anything the government does is interference versus a concept where the thing to have wit is domination. So arbitrary decision making, for example, illegitimate decision making. But that in fact, what we all need is sort of empowerment in both our private and our public lives as co creators of the norms and constraints that shape the conditions for our action and then that the creation of those constraints always be nondominating, hence the need for legitimacy and so forth.
00:30:08.778 - 00:31:05.822, Speaker D: A legitimacy requirements, at any rate. So there's that sort of big body of work in the world of philosophy that is articulating this view for where the path of human flourishing is. It is also supportive of a pluralist view. The idea is not that human flourishing looks exactly the same for every human being. It's rather that if we are again empowered in our private lives and in our public lives as co creators of norms and constraints, then we can all find our paths to flourishing and we can also find the way of aligning our different paths of flourishing with one another for sort of broadly positive social cooperation. So the other concepts sort of flow out of that core idea the commitment to egalitarian, pluralism, decentralization, coordination, capacity and the like. And so then one of the things we were really trying to do in the paper was to see where in the normative discourse in the Web Three or decentralized social technology space, we could see those concepts operating and they don't always fit perfectly.
00:31:05.822 - 00:31:34.960, Speaker D: So I want to be clear. It's not like there's a kind of one to one mapping between the philosophical concepts and the techno normative concepts, but we did see people sort of pursuing sort of normative aspirations in the Web Three space or the DSOC space that seemed to have some family resemblance to concepts in this picture of human flourishing. And so we wanted to push on that and figure out what more could be said. Could we tighten up the normative thinking in the tech space?
00:31:37.650 - 00:32:14.250, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I guess the short way I'd put it, Kevin, is that there's a bunch of stuff that people talk about effectively normatively within the Web Three community. In fact, it's obsessed with various slogans like this. And then there's like thousands of years of political philosophy and the language is almost unrelated. So that seems kind of weird. And so what we're trying to do is find where we can build bridges, find where there's tensions. And also, maybe we didn't emphasize this as much, but I think one of the most interesting things is where can. Problems and tensions on the ground within the Web Three community.
00:32:14.250 - 00:32:53.590, Speaker B: Trying to live out those values reflect limits of the philosophical concepts like, for example, nondomination has, I think, a lot of relationship to this notion of trustlessness. It means that there's nobody who can take away from you something or nobody who can constrain you in certain ways. But of course, trustlessness has had a lot of issues in practice, and I think not all of them are issues for nondomination, but they show some of the tensions that come out trying to make various visions of nondominant. So it's in that back and forth that I think both philosophy and the Web Three community have a lot to gain.
00:32:56.650 - 00:33:45.746, Speaker D: It was a super productive set of conversations, I will say. I mean, just to Glenn's point, and you could obviously hear in our answers, right, that I come from one very specific intellectual place and sort of background place and had a lot of learning to do. So the bridge building was an important part of this work. But as Glenn said, there is real sort of normative vocabulary, real questions about ethics. People are sort of probing and pushing, trying to understand. People are trying to think about regenerative economies, for instance. And so we really wanted to provide some anchors for that and give people the chance to connect to on both sides, academic and tech side, sort of connect to a conversation so people could see more what the stakes are of the ethical terms they're pursuing.
00:33:45.938 - 00:33:47.442, Speaker A: Anything else you want to add, Glenn?
00:33:47.506 - 00:34:16.500, Speaker B: Yeah, to me, that's all, again, just part and parcel of this thing of bringing different logics to bear on the same problems, letting people learn from each other rather than learn everything completely separately and trying to find this cooperation across these different communities. Even if it's not complete, even if we're not going to make them the same discussions, at least we can help people see what the parallels are so that people can read those philosophical discussions and maybe gain something from them.
00:34:20.790 - 00:34:47.066, Speaker A: As we discuss the paper, I find myself drawn to this line that I saw in the paper. Many of the utopian and dystopian promises of decentralized social texts are hypothetical and they're just projections about futures that the underlying technologies might support. And I just thought that that was kind of just very profound that we're projecting out into the future what these technologies might support. And so that sort of leads to.
00:34:47.088 - 00:34:52.954, Speaker B: My question, if you all are maximally successful, what does web three look like.
00:34:52.992 - 00:35:05.540, Speaker A: In five or ten years? I think last question. I went to you, Danielle, so maybe I'll go to you, Glenn, first on this one. So if you're maximally successful, if this paper is maximally impactful, what does web three look like in five or ten years?
00:35:07.110 - 00:36:09.410, Speaker B: I hope web three is no longer a subculture. I hope that the learnings from it have suffused the broader culture. And on the other hand, the problems with it have been sort of ironed out and made consistent with broader social values. I hope that a lot of the ideas that have been popularized through the Web Three World are parts of mainstream systems. I hope we have sort of web of trust pluralistic verification all over the place. I hope we have a bunch of creative new ways of governance and decision making being used by governments, but also by new types of organizations. I hope we have lots of experiments with lots of new property regimes going on harnessing these technologies.
00:36:09.410 - 00:36:29.050, Speaker B: And I hope a large chunk of it, though not all of it, is not for profit businesses. There's lots of government support, there's lots of philanthropic support. There's lots of partnerships between private organizations and various kinds of charitable and public sector organizations.
00:36:31.970 - 00:37:05.110, Speaker D: Yeah, no, I would second all of that. And I guess the way I would put it is I hope that in five years time, the Use case that the general public thinks of when they hear about Blockchain isn't cryptocurrency, actually, that so many other Use cases have suffused the space that people realize it's a technological enablement that can solve problems across domains again, governance problems, verification problems, et cetera.
00:37:10.350 - 00:37:11.100, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:37:11.470 - 00:37:20.080, Speaker A: Well, as we're sort of getting towards the bottom of the hour, I'm wondering if there's anything that I didn't ask that y'all want to say. Maybe Danielle will go to you first on this one.
00:37:20.930 - 00:38:09.920, Speaker D: Well, I mean, for me, I am really interested in the question of what case studies feel the most pressing for people. And so I would really love, again, to kind of put out a call and people can find us online at the Getting Plurality network if you Google that, and there'll be a kind of point of contact. And if people, if listeners have cases where they're sort of wrestling with questions of ethics as they're trying to figure out how to deploy some element of decentralized social technology, we'd love to hear from people because we are really wanting to be responsive to the decisions people are actually facing. And I think we still have a lot of work to do, honestly, to be effective in offering practices, protocols and the like for people to be able to use the kind of ethics guardrails that we've tried to sketch out in the paper.
00:38:13.460 - 00:38:20.656, Speaker A: Thanks, Danielle. We'll have a link to that in the show Notes the Getting Plurality Network, and people can reach out if they have ethical questions as they build Dowels.
00:38:20.688 - 00:38:21.700, Speaker B: And Web Three tech.
00:38:21.850 - 00:38:22.548, Speaker D: Exactly.
00:38:22.714 - 00:38:25.812, Speaker A: Glenn, same question to you. Is there anything I didn't ask that you want to say?
00:38:25.866 - 00:39:00.060, Speaker B: Well, I'd love to welcome people's participation. You can check it out@plurality.net in the book that I'm writing with Audrey. It's an open, get based collaboration. We'll be using a lot of the innovative governance approaches that we describe in the book and that you and I have talked about for so long that you talk about in Green Pilled as part of the book project. And we'd like to help have people use those tools to co create their vision of the future of them. So that's my call for participation.
00:39:00.060 - 00:39:00.688, Speaker B: Amazing.
00:39:00.774 - 00:39:35.352, Speaker A: And I would also ask that the listeners read the paper. I read it over the last couple of days. It's really quite inspiring to hear how you envision web three technologies and the ethics of decentralized social, especially knowing just how deeply connected in the space you all are. My work at Gitcoin was built foundationally on top of quadratic funding, and the Decentralized Society paper that Glenn and Vitalik and Pooja put out was really glenn.
00:39:35.416 - 00:39:43.568, Speaker B: Congratulations on your exciting fundraising effort recently around that paper.
00:39:43.654 - 00:40:11.880, Speaker A: That's right, yeah. For the audience's benefit. It wasn't my fundraising effort. Gitcoin had Glenn and Vitalik and Zoe sign the QF paper. And I also wrote an article and signed a paper and that was dropped as an NFT called Gitcoin Presents. And I think it raised like 800K for the Gitcoin matching pool and for the plurality institute. So thank you again for your support of that, Glenn.
00:40:12.540 - 00:40:13.560, Speaker D: Fantastic.
00:40:14.940 - 00:40:28.188, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I think I was meandering there, but what I wanted to say is that y'all have both been such an inspiration for me, and your work has been foundational for some of the stuff that I've worked on. And so if I can pay it forward and we can build this movement of plurality forward, that seems like a.
00:40:28.194 - 00:40:29.870, Speaker B: Really exciting outcome for me.
00:40:30.480 - 00:40:33.950, Speaker D: Fantastic. Thank you, Kevin. Really appreciate your work.
00:40:34.480 - 00:40:45.120, Speaker A: All right, so call to action for the listener. Check out the getting plurality network, check out plurality net and read the paper. There will be links in the show notes for each of those. Thanks so much for joining me, Danielle and Glenn.
00:40:45.460 - 00:40:46.220, Speaker D: Thanks, Kevin.
