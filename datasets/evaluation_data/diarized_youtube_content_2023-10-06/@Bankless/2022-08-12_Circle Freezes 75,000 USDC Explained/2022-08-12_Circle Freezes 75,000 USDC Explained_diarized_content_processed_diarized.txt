00:00:00.170 - 00:00:40.134, Speaker A: Circle, the issuer of USDC has immediately frozen the $75,000 of USDC that's sitting inside of tornado cash. Anyone who's deposited this USDC into tornado cash with the hopes of withdrawing it later to a clean address, has now had their USDC frozen. So why did Circle do this? Why did they freeze the USDC inside of Tornado cash? Because they have to. They are a regulated us entity and violating OFAC is a BFD. Circle is huge supporters of DFI and this entire industry, and they are a big advocate for crypto on Capitol Hill. But you got to pick your battles and going up against OFAC over $75,000 is not the right battle to pick. This is ultimately how the technology sector becomes an extension of the state.
00:00:40.134 - 00:00:44.850, Speaker A: USDC could either comply with the government or shut down its business. It's a pretty obvious trade.
