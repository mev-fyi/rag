00:00:03.610 - 00:00:20.154, Speaker A: Welcome to Bankless, where we explore the frontier of Internet money and Internet finance. This is how to get started, how to get better, how to front run the opportunity. This is Ryan. Sean Adams. I'm here with David Hoffman, and we're here to help you become more bankless. Guys, exciting episode for you. This is the sequel.
00:00:20.154 - 00:01:30.498, Speaker A: This is part two of what's next with Vitalik Buterin. We ask what's next for a ethereum? In today's part two episode, we talk more broadly, what's next for the world? What's next for AI and the intersection of crypto? This is the social and philosophical side of Ethereum. We get into the question of what have we created here? What is ethereum holistically? Is it like a country, a network state, as Bellaji might say, or is it a Dao? If it's a Dao, how should Daos be governed? Should we use a corporate governance structure? Should we take the learnings from philosophy and political science and apply those things to daos? And then we end with the biggest question of all. I have never heard Vitalik comment on artificial intelligence and his thoughts, but he gives us those thoughts today. Is AI coming to destroy humanity? We ask him that question, will there be a peaceful coexistence? And what is the intersection between crypto and artificial intelligence? Crypto, of course, being a decentralized technology, AI being one that centralizes. Are we in for the cage match of the decade of the next century? Maybe that's ahead. Vitalik as well thinks AI could be coming sooner than he previously.
00:01:30.498 - 00:01:47.454, Speaker A: I think this is after a trip to Silicon Valley and talking to some experts, so a lot of content to unpack. Of course, this is a second part of a two part conversation with Vitalik. If you want last week's part one, go back on the RSS feed and you can download that. You should see that, guys.
00:01:47.492 - 00:01:54.078, Speaker B: Of course, we're just going to get right to the conversation with Vitalik Buterin. But first, a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible.
00:01:54.164 - 00:02:53.166, Speaker C: If you've been listening to bankless, you know that we're fans of the modular blockchain thesis, the idea that blockchains will separate execution from data availability and consensus, allowing all three to become the best versions of themselves. And Fuel has built the fastest modular execution layer in the industry. By supporting parallel transaction execution, Fuel unlocks significantly faster throughput for the Webfree world. Fuel also goes beyond the limitations of the EVM with its own fuel, VM, which is more efficient and optimized opening up the design space for developers. And lastly, Fuel brings a powerful developer experience with its own domain specific language, sway and a supportive tool chain called fork. With Fuel, you can have the benefits of smart contract languages like validity, while adopting the improvements made by the rust tooling ecosystem, letting the fuel development environment go beyond the limitations of the EVM. If you want to learn more, there's a link in the show notes to see how you can get involved with a fuel network in all of my years in crypto, I have never been hacked, scammed or lost money to a thief, and a lot of that credit goes to my ledger hardware wallet.

00:04:18.042 - 00:05:34.310, Speaker A: Well, as we move from kind of the technical layer, I want to talk about maybe a bit more the social layer and moving from engineering to some of the softer sciences like philosophy and maybe political science here. And I think one question that we're left with Ethereum is okay, what is this thing that we have built so far? There is this notion, and I know you're familiar with it, of the network stake, the network state, rather, and this is a concept most recently put forward by Balaji. He was on the podcast as well, recently, and we asked Bology, who's been a time in crypto, of course, from the very beginnings, do you think that the network state is kind of the main thing that the crypto project is focused on? And his answer was, yes, absolutely. That's what we are doing. Money is just a subset of the network state. I'm curious your perspective on this, Vitalik, and I know you have thoughts, but let's talk about Ethereum first. Do you think Ethereum is an example of a Belagian network state or a network state of some other conceptual framework?
00:05:34.650 - 00:06:44.800, Speaker D: I would say no. I think Ethereum has a very important role to play in network states. But I would say Ethereum is a bit of a higher layer thing. And the reason why I would say that is that at this point, the Ethereum community has grown very big, very diverse, very pluralist in a lot of ways. And one of the things that that means that it sacrifices is definitely an assumption of alignment on a lot of issues that people really care about, especially on non crypto related topics. Right. I think if you look at even bitcoin ten years ago, or even Ethereum eight years ago, and you asked a question of what do you think the right federal minimum wage is? Or what's your view on how health care should be provided, or what's your perspective on immigration, or who's right in some geopolitical situation.
00:06:44.800 - 00:07:59.970, Speaker D: Ten years ago, you would have gotten a lot more alignment. And I think these days you're going to get less alignment on those kinds of issues. And I think that's an inevitable part of the ecosystem growing, and it's also a healthy thing. Right? Like Glenn loves to use the phrase facilitating cooperation across difference. And to me, facilitating cooperation across difference is definitely part of what both blockchains and a lot of the equipment on blockchains is going to be about. One probably just very concrete example just to kind of dive very briefly into the weeds before we dive back out of what I'm talking about is the whole Ens Brantley situation, right? Like that was something where people within the ethereum ecosystem who are passionate ethereums and who have eth names, they did have very different perspectives on that situation that they cared deeply about. And I think it's a testament to the Ethereum ecosystem and even to EnS itself, that we were able to navigate that and even navigate pretty close to a 50 50 split, I think, in the ENS Dow's decision of whether or not Brantley should be fired.
00:07:59.970 - 00:08:06.870, Speaker D: Right. Without that really turning into like a big schism that breaks ethereum altogether.
00:08:07.550 - 00:08:27.680, Speaker A: To refresh people with the Brantley situation, Brantley had some controversial comments. What was it at the time that a subset of the Ethereum community disagreed vehemently with? And, yeah. Any other light on that for folks that weren't familiar with the current event as it happened in Ethereum world?
00:08:28.050 - 00:08:50.722, Speaker D: Yeah, he basically has kind of traditional religious views on topics like meno homosexuality, and those kinds of topics that are definitely extremely out of step with, especially people who have a more left leaning ethos.
00:08:50.866 - 00:08:53.026, Speaker A: And what was the outcome?
00:08:53.218 - 00:09:23.520, Speaker D: So the outcome was that there were a lot of calls to basically fire Brantley or cancel him for various meanings of that term. And I think he did end up getting pushed out of true names Ltd. The company. But there was a vote to try to push him out of the Ens Dao. And I think that vote ended up, you know, Brantley is part of Ethereum land, and there are people in some kind of sub islands of Ethereum who do not really interact with him or wants to interact with him. And then there are some people who.
00:09:26.690 - 00:09:53.180, Speaker B: He did, you're right, in that he did not get kicked out of the Dow or he did not lose a lot of his delegation, but he did kind of be removed socially. He had much less presence on Twitter. People listened to him a lot less. And so while the formal Dao did not remove his power, he did kind of socially take a few, knock down a few rungs, if you will. So there was some sort of hybrid outcome to.
00:09:56.830 - 00:10:56.238, Speaker D: Mean the, the crypto space, I think, obviously continues to intersect with geopolitics more and more. The other big example of that was obviously the whole Ukraine situation this year. And there, I think, I personally am not aware of Ethereum community, actually. No. Maybe within the Aragon team, which is russian, there's definitely more people who have takes that vehemently disagree with my position, and I guess your position on that issue, and there has been some even Twitter drama on that. But more and more of these do crop up, and more and more of these will crop up. But I guess my view there is that I have views on each one of these issues, and we have views on each one of these issues.
00:10:56.238 - 00:11:08.818, Speaker D: And I don't think that our role as participants in the Ethereum ecosystem should cause us to shy away from expressing our views on some of those topics, because those topics are very important.
00:11:08.904 - 00:11:51.230, Speaker A: I think some of what you're saying, Vitalik, is that Ethereum is almost like too credibly neutral to become a blodian network state. Like it doesn't have strong enough opinions. It's kind of like asking the Internet to become a network state. Well, what is the Internet? It's a whole bunch of tribes coming together to interact. But maybe so if Ethereum itself is not a network state and can't become one, it doesn't have a social fabric that has enough coherence, I suppose, around a particular set of values other than being decentralized and being credibly neutral itself, then is ethereum a substrate for spawning other network states on top of.
00:11:51.380 - 00:13:03.110, Speaker D: I think absolutely. And I think Ethereum, it absolutely is still both a substrate and a home for a lot of different subcommunities that do have these much more detailed and opinionated visions of the kind of world that they want to see. And I do think that Ethereum to some extent does sort of structurally have some opinions in the sense of if you're a person that really does believe in the World Economic forum vision of a cashless society, then there's just much less for you that Ethereum can offer. Right? So I do think that there is some extent to which Ethereum as a thing has values baked into it, and there are values that are shared by, that are much more shared by the Ethereum community than by the world as a whole. Right. But I think the right level to try to make some of these more opinionated visions come to life is by sub communities that are close to Ethereum and that are even proud of their alignment with Ethereum. But they do sort of recognize their distinction from Ethereum itself.
00:13:03.110 - 00:14:37.766, Speaker D: So that do sort of both give permission for people to still be ethereums, but at the same time not liking their vision, and also by doing so kind of give themselves the freedom to really have these stronger moral commitments without fear of kind of offending people by speaking for Ethereum as a whole. Right? So I would love to see multiple Ethereum network states. I think within the network state concept, there is a lot of room for some kind of concept of kind of coordinating layers between network states in general. Right? Like I do think that once there are multiple network states, they are going to have some common interests that just have to do with the fact that they're all network states. I think there might even be value in co locating some of them beside each other, for example, so that they can interact with each other, but without literally being part of the exact same at turf and sort of the high levels of alignment that come out of something like that. And I think Ethereum can be part of the alignment layer, but there is probably also room for other kinds of alignment layers between different network states as well. So it'll be interesting.
00:14:37.766 - 00:15:02.494, Speaker D: I think we'll see how that whole vision is going to evolve. I think just basically saying that network states are something that should be free to be more opinionated is something that's probably even going to just create a better world, because we'll get more interesting visions that will try to use the concepts to be able to do more.
00:15:02.692 - 00:16:28.290, Speaker B: When we talk about the World Economic Forum and Ethereum, we're comparing the value systems of these two polls, right? But I think it's fair to say that the World Economic Forum is very opinionated and it's very political, and Ethereum is designed to be this credibly neutral platform. And I think perhaps it's a fair take to say that the reason why we can't really find much room on Ethereum for the World Economic Forum is due to that difference, right? Like, we can't really find a way to include the WEF's values on our credibly neutral social settlement layer. There's just like not room for them to appear. And so when we talk about other network states or other political systems that do find good ways to inhabit space on Ethereum, and maybe there's more than one, maybe there's a number of them, that's true. They are able to do that because they are more aligned with the values found in Ethereum, or they fit inside of it a little bit better. And so Ethereum, as a system of supporting many, many network states, does come to actually proliferate its values upon the world by supporting many, many other network states that fit on top of Ethereum, that fit well inside of Ethereum's structure. And so Ethereum kind of becomes like the meta structure that allows for many, many network states to proliferate.
00:16:28.290 - 00:16:57.358, Speaker B: And I think what you were saying with co locating network states, maybe both in physical territory, but also two network states that are just very similar, are also going to be able to cooperate with each other, work well together, and grow stronger because of that cooperation. And so I'm wondering if you see this kind of trajectory for things and network states being built on Ethereum, where if we're going to get a proliferation of many many network states, some of.
00:16:57.364 - 00:16:58.018, Speaker C: Them are going to be able to.
00:16:58.024 - 00:17:13.320, Speaker B: Fit better than others, and the ones that fit better than others are able to adapt with each other better than others. And then this is kind of the snowball that carries us into this Bellagian network state future that I think he is very hopeful for. Is that a fair take for the future?
00:17:13.770 - 00:18:22.218, Speaker D: I'd say so, yeah. It's definitely true that some ideologies fit better into both Ethereum and the network state world than mean. The World Economic Forum is an interesting case, right? Because there's the World Economic Forum as an actual thing, and then there's the World Economic Forum as the thing that Twitter trolls mythologize it into. I always get the feeling that I haven't been to the forum myself, but talks to people who have participated in it. And there are very diverse people, and there's definitely people that just want to create infrastructure for schools in developing countries. It is a forum, and ultimately a forum like Internet forums are places where discussion happens, but at the same time, forums like our bitcoin forum, they do, tends to skew toward particular ideologies as well. So there's always a balance between those two tendencies.
00:18:22.218 - 00:19:09.670, Speaker D: And I think there's definitely some aspect, the concept of globalism. Right. That's an interesting one. I don't know if you saw, there was that Twitter poll I made where I basically asked people how they identify me, and one of the questions was, am I a globalist, and do you like globalism? And there were people who said they like globalism, and I'm a globalist, and there's people who say they don't like globalism and I'm not a globalist. And this is because there's actually two different meanings of the term globalism. One is this sort know, cosmopolitan vibe of, like, someone has the same moral value, whether they're from the United States or Canada or Uganda. And I'm going to be open to treating any of those people as my brother.
00:19:09.670 - 00:20:14.690, Speaker D: And then there's globalism as in one world government. And I'm obviously a fan of the first and not a fan of the second. And I think a lot of people are fans of the first and not fans of the second, but they still, they just disagree on the semantic question of which one of those two the word globalist belongs to. And even within the world of the World Economic Forum, I think there's definitely people who are very ideologically inclined toward the second. But then there's, I think, also people who are much more inclined toward the first and don't care about the second. And I think as a kind of global, you could call it sort of alternative liberal. With you using the word liberal in the lowercase sense, movement, there's an opportunity to try to really split those two and to basically show people that some notion of global brotherhood doesn't actually require global political centralization.
00:20:18.150 - 00:20:51.920, Speaker A: I think these are all fascinating things. And obviously, the social science side of this crypto movement is maybe in some ways more interesting than the technology side. But you're talking about the semantics of words like globalism and how that's changed. I also think the semantics behind words in crypto have changed. So take the word dow. That used to mean something different than what it means today. And I would even say a year ago it meant something different than it does today.
00:20:51.920 - 00:21:58.260, Speaker A: You wrote a post which I read yesterday I was quite fascinated with, and the title of that post was dows are not corporations. And I think you were responding to a new kind of concept, or I guess, thing that's been in vogue recently, which is the idea that all dows that we have on Ethereum and other crypto networks should get their shit together a bit more, should get a bit more organized, should nail down a structure, and should start to resemble more corporate governance. I think you push back on that claim and you think that some dows maybe are fit for corporate governance, but others should be more public, should be more inspired by the political scientists and the political science that we have. And maybe that's the lens of Ethereum. We'll start there back to what is this thing called Ethereum? Is Ethereum a dow? And what actually are dows? Should they be managed corporately, or are there new governance systems that we're unlocking here?
00:22:00.550 - 00:22:45.006, Speaker D: It's a good question. I think we haven't really even fully defined the term dao as some of the examples in that post go into. Right. There's this sort of vague notion among a lot of people that a dow still should be this kind of logically centralized singleton where money goes into one place and there's a global vote on every funding decision. And that's clearly just a bad model. And it's a model that probably doesn't even give people what they want out of dows. And then there's this alternative architecture that's kind of inspired by what Ukraine Dow is doing, where you have the core that makes these decisions, but then you have pods, and pods have a much higher level of autonomy.
00:22:45.006 - 00:23:27.390, Speaker D: And that seems like something that actually gives people more of what they want out of, like, obviously, Ukraine. Dow is not the only one. There's also Vita Dao, which is doing life extension research. There's all of the various daos that are trying to run long term pieces of infrastructure. So reflexor for Rye, maker for Makerdao Claros, then optimism, retrofunding, and all of these things. So I hope that we're going to learn a lot from these examples. I hope that a couple of years from now we're going to have some much better models of what a good dow looks like.
00:23:27.390 - 00:23:55.880, Speaker D: And once we learn from them, then would the Ethereum foundation be able to become a Dow based on that kind of model? We'll see. I guess that was one of those things that's also been a dream from close to the beginning. And then optimism, obviously, very dow controlled, like what other dows we're going to see within the Ethereum ecosystem. And we'll see. It'll be interesting.
00:23:56.650 - 00:24:26.334, Speaker A: Why don't dows just all operate with a corporate governance structure? I mean, there is the argument, Vitalik, that we have baked out corporate governance over the last 200 years. We've made it pretty efficient. There's a CEO, there's an executive team, there's a board of advisors. There are these governors that keep them in check. These are called shareholders. And it works pretty well. Like all of the products that we experience in our modern world were brought to you by corporation.
00:24:26.334 - 00:24:39.960, Speaker A: Right. Somebody on the s and P 500 went and created this. And so these joint stock ownership companies at the corporate structure works pretty well. Isn't a Dow just trying to mirror that, or is there something different here?
00:24:40.650 - 00:25:06.654, Speaker D: That's a good question. I think there's two arguments that I have against that line of thinking. Right. Actually, three arguments in the post. One of them is that some things require censorship resistance, and corporations are not good at censorship resistance. Another one is that corporations are good at building products, but they're less good at providing infrastructure. Right.
00:25:06.654 - 00:25:50.382, Speaker D: So, like, for example, social media companies have completely failed at satisfying people's desire for some notion that the content decisions that they're making are fair. Right. And that's the sort of thing that dows might actually be better at than traditional forms of corporate governance. And then a third one is the fact that, well, actually corporations are designed around the idea that they're second order organizations and they can appeal to first order courts when something goes wrong. Right. You could 51% attack a company. Right.
00:25:50.382 - 00:26:30.730, Speaker D: And potentially 51% of the shareholders could try to vote to kick out the other 49% but that is explicitly illegal. And the mechanism that enforces that is itself ultimately the government that enforces shareholder laws. Right? So if we're going to build a Dow, then the Dow has to include all of that functionality that's normally provided by nation states by itself. And corporate governance is not good at doing that. But political science, that's exactly the sort of stuff that it studies.
00:26:31.230 - 00:27:03.620, Speaker A: Yeah, it's definitely fascinating to see how that evolves. Maybe let's switch back to Ethereum for a minute and kind of the end game, I guess, using as simple words as possible. Vitalik, how would you describe Ethereum's end state like at the end of this long roadmap? The theme of this episode, I think, has been what's next? At the end of all of these things that we've talked about so far, of what's next, what does Ethereum look like and what does it deliver for the world?
00:27:05.850 - 00:28:58.490, Speaker D: I think, well, Ethereum's ethos from the beginning, right, I think has been to insist on a few particular values, but otherwise not have its own picture of what specific things it brings to the world, but leave that up to the ecosystem and lots of different groups to create their own vision. And I think just having a well functioning global cryptocurrency is a huge amount of value by itself. It's especially valuable to people outside of the first world and in places like Latin America, Africa, Eastern Europe and Central Asia and other places that have a harder time with the existing financial system. Ethereum being the substrate for daos and mechanisms that do other things. So identity is one of the biggest examples, like can we create some kind of more decentralized model of identity and really start with what some of the tools that the Ethereum ecosystem has already, whether it's accounts and hopefully soon social recovery wallets and ens and things like popes, and try to really optimize that and do what we can to build it into something that's really good at providing what people want out of an identity system. Being a base layer for dows in general network states are, we just talked about those for ten or 15 minutes. But what would it actually mean for Ethereum to be a base layer for things like that? Things like proof of humanity have always been one of my favorite applications.
00:28:58.490 - 00:29:32.738, Speaker D: Other kinds of censorship resistant applications, other kinds of credibly neutral and decentralized applications like could we actually do the whole blockchain based social media thing and try to create social media platforms that are more credibly neutral and fair in some way? I don't think there is one vision for what Ethereum could do. I think there's many different visions, and I think once Ethereum manages to solve its scaling problems, it's going to be in a much better place to help be the substrate that allows all of those visions to happen.
00:29:32.824 - 00:30:21.170, Speaker C: Arbitram one is pioneering the world of secure Ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the web three landscape.

Assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously.
00:31:39.094 - 00:32:11.170, Speaker C: Across's bridges are powered by UMA's optimistic oracle to securely transfer tokens between layer two s and Ethereum across its critical ecosystem infrastructure and across v two has just launched. Their new version focuses on higher capital efficiency, layer two to layer two transfers, and a brand new chain with Polygon, all while prioritizing high security and low fees. You can be a part of across its story by joining their discord and using across for all of your layer two transferring needs. So go to across to quickly and securely bridge your assets between Ethereum, optimism, polygon, arbitram, or Boba networks.
00:32:11.330 - 00:32:38.298, Speaker A: I love that part of the answer to the question of what's next for Ethereum is like question mark. We don't actually know what's on the other side. It's like a choose your own adventure. Vitalik before we close this out, finally, Danny Ryan came on the podcast earlier this week and he told us that you had some thoughts on AI artificial intelligence that is Vitalik. Do you have any hot takes on, like, are you worried about, since we're.
00:32:38.314 - 00:32:40.526, Speaker B: On the topic of weapon, are you.
00:32:40.548 - 00:32:49.282, Speaker A: Worried about AI in society? Are AI's next essential threat to humanity? Do you see any intersection with crypto? Give us any hot takes?
00:32:49.336 - 00:33:01.494, Speaker B: Yeah, what I really want to know actually out of this is ais are not going to have bank accounts, but ais can totally manage private keys. And so what intersection does this?
00:33:01.532 - 00:33:07.110, Speaker A: Did we just create a substrate for ais to gain control over the human race? And it's over now?
00:33:07.260 - 00:33:50.150, Speaker D: Yeah. So when I was visiting the Bay area as part of my trip to SPC, I also visited and talked to a bunch of various AI people, like people from anthropic and OpenAI and some of the big AI firms, and just general AI boosters in the space. And I was surprised by the fast timelines that a lot of them have, right, like going in. I think my timelines were more that we're going to get something like the singularity by sometime around 2075. And when I gave this a number to people, they're like, oh, wow, you're crazy. How can you possibly think AI is going to be that slow?
00:33:50.810 - 00:33:51.560, Speaker A: Wow.
00:33:52.170 - 00:35:42.522, Speaker D: A lot of them are literally expecting human level AI before the end of this decade. And the singularity, these are obviously inside views, and my default instinct is to be skeptical. But I think it's important to ask the question of, well, what if they're right. And what if, over the next decade or two, AI basically ends up eating the world? And then the question that we have to think about is, what is the role that crypto has to play in an AI dominated world? Right? Are structures that kind of insist on the idea that humans are the only kind of significant actor in the space? Are those going to survive an AI transition? What would an AI even look like? Could crypto be part of somehow democratically governing the ais that come out? Would crypto be something that could help coordinate some alternative AI project so that the whole AI transition doesn't lead to just massive centralization in one or two companies? I don't know, but I think it's important for anyone to be thinking about the future of crypto as a space to also have the question in mind of how does AI play into this? And what would a merger of? Well, no merger, but what would the interplay between crypto and AI look like? I don't yet perfectly know the answer to this question, but I just think it's a really important question that we need to be very serious and thinking about.
00:35:42.656 - 00:36:01.280, Speaker A: Do you have any thoughts on AI ethics and making sure that we know human oriented ethics into ais very early so that we don't get an advanced general intelligence that kind of runs away from us? I mean, Nick Bolstrom has talked about this in his books, Elon Musk and others, wondering if you've looked at that angle of things.
00:36:02.050 - 00:37:23.398, Speaker D: It's a very good question. So, actually, the people in the Bay area that have fast timelines, they're also more optimistic about AI safety and AI alignment than they have been before. The way to explain the reason why is because a lot of the very doom and gloomy AI alignment theory, it basically implicitly assumed that ais would be grown by essentially playing real time strategy games against each other. If you think of how something like Alphazero was grown, right, it's able to learn to play a game by playing against itself billions of times, and then it just becomes really good at go, and you just take that model and you translate it to optimizing it, manipulating the natural world as a whole. And with that kind of a growth path, it's easy to see why that AI would be totally just unaware of and not able to be aligned with human values, right? Because the AI grew and developed its patterns of thinking without any interaction with humans. The AI's path to becoming intelligent would not even be the same path that humans took. Where there's this complicated interplay of cooperation and competition.
00:37:23.398 - 00:38:48.198, Speaker D: And there's even a big argument to be made that human intelligence basically evolved as a result of humans having to play political games against each other, right? And ais would just be in a completely different concept. They would be born and raised in a completely different way, right? And so maybe the whole would the AI just turn the universe into paperclips to be able to calculate a little faster thing here is like a really excellent question to ask. But the ais that we're seeing today, they're ais that are grown by basically learning patterns of human behavior and basically repeatedly attempting to pattern match the situation that they're in to the human behavior that's been repeated the greatest number of times in a context that's similar to that pattern. And so the ais that emerge out of that kind of learning process just are going to be ais that are sort of more naturally human by default. It also means that we're going to have slower takeoff because there is a natural divide between being able to get to human level intelligence and surpassing it. Because human level intelligence, you can get to human level intelligence if you're just a really good pattern matching engine that learns from all the humans. But moving beyond human level intelligence requires you to actually come up with things yourself.
00:38:48.198 - 00:39:38.930, Speaker D: So it's still a step higher, basically, right? So we have more time. The ais are more likely to be human like. We're more likely to see multiple ais instead of one single AI dominating everything. So all of those things paint a more optimistic picture. And also the work that's been happening in AI alignment now it's less theoretical and it's more practical. It's trying to say, how do we take the ais that we're building today, and how do we try to make them be as aligned as possible? And that's a path that seems to be slowly starting to make more headway. Obviously, we still have very big problems, I think very big problems from the risk of the ais that take over being unaligned.
00:39:38.930 - 00:41:00.526, Speaker D: And I would say also a political centralization risk from bad versions of AI alignment theory being used to justify an idea that AI risk means that ais have to be in a lab where only a couple of large corporations run by sort of self appointed ethical high priests should be the only ones that have access to the capabilities. And if people who build the most powerful ais end up having that kind of mindset, then what would that mean for the political structure of the world? That's kind of like a secondary AI risk. That I think is also worth thinking about, especially in the near term. Right. Because the eyes that we have today, they're more than a decade away from paperclipping risk. But if we enter a world where the US and chinese governments can make deepfakes but no one else can, then in some ways that's worse than a world where everyone can make deepfakes because it just sort of unbalances the balance of power toward two particular organizations. So I think that stuff is also stuff that's probably worth thinking about.
00:41:00.526 - 00:41:07.106, Speaker D: And it's definitely been more on my minds than it has been six months ago, but we'll see. That's interesting. Yeah.
00:41:07.128 - 00:41:26.854, Speaker A: And I'm wondering if you vibe at all with Peter Thiel's take where AI is kind of a centralizing technology, whereas crypto is a technology of decentralization and almost like a defense, a bulwark against the centralizing functions of AI. Does anything in that idea resonate with you?
00:41:27.052 - 00:41:49.486, Speaker D: I mean, that's an idea that I've repeated myself multiple times. Right? I think the question is, how do we take that from sort of the world of theory and the world of abstractly thinking about AI and crypto as sort of ideologies for the world, and into the question of like, well, what concretely can crypto do to try to mitigate the chance that AI leads to.
00:41:49.508 - 00:41:53.206, Speaker A: Centralizing everything which is faster or further.
00:41:53.258 - 00:41:56.530, Speaker B: Along in its roadmap, Ethereum or generalized AI?
00:41:57.910 - 00:42:14.726, Speaker D: That's a good question. It depends on how far you want to go. I do still expect that we are going to get Ethereum fully finishing its vision before we'll get to a human level AI, but even close to human level AI, that's going to start to make our world look very different.
00:42:14.908 - 00:42:22.610, Speaker A: This is fantastic. Bear market content for us on the AI side of things. I think actually we want to explore this a bit further.
00:42:22.770 - 00:42:23.814, Speaker B: Ryan's taking notes.
00:42:23.862 - 00:42:30.940, Speaker A: Yeah, taking notes. I'm curious, from your perspective, is there anyone in the AI field that we should be talking to on bankless as we're looking at this.
00:42:34.610 - 00:42:38.398, Speaker D: I will think about this, and if I find names, I will send them to you.
00:42:38.484 - 00:42:39.210, Speaker A: Fantastic.
00:42:39.290 - 00:42:39.726, Speaker D: Beautiful.
00:42:39.828 - 00:42:57.262, Speaker A: Vitalik, it has been a pleasure talking to you about what is next for Ethereum. We didn't say it at the outset, but congratulations to you, to us, to the entire Ethereum community for this major milestone and getting to this point, congratulations to you too.
00:42:57.336 - 00:42:59.270, Speaker D: It's all been a great journey.
00:42:59.930 - 00:43:20.060, Speaker A: Bankless nation, we've got some action items for you, lots in the show notes today. Number one is proof of stake, which is the book that Vitalik has come out with. This is, I think, Vitalika, correct me if I'm wrong, but a lot of your blog posts only in book form, which makes it more accessible for people. Is that correct?
00:43:20.670 - 00:43:21.420, Speaker D: Yes.
00:43:21.870 - 00:43:43.230, Speaker A: Also some links to the post that we talked about today, the path to single slot finality. Dows are not corporations on Vitalik's website. And what does Vitalik think about network states? We'll also include a link to the MeV boost website where you can see all of the builders and relayers in production. As always, got to end with risks and disclaimers.
00:43:43.390 - 00:43:59.554, Speaker D: Crypto is risky. Luna is risky. Luna is extremely risky. But to be honest, Ethereum is risky too. You could lose what you put in, but we're headed west. This is the frontier. Technically it's the London hard fork, but it's still the frontier.
00:43:59.554 - 00:44:05.338, Speaker D: It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
