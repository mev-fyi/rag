00:00:00.200 - 00:00:17.761, Speaker A: Bankless Nation. This is a special episode from us because we are witnessing something historic right now in crypto. We are witnessing the largest event, I think, in crypto history. This is the collapse of an entire stablecoin. David, where are we going in this episode?
00:00:17.873 - 00:01:04.545, Speaker B: Yeah, so what's going on is there was about $50 billion of total capital destruction out of the Luna ecosystem. The collapse of the largest algorithmic stablecoin ever. The largest collapse of a stablecoin ever. And so we are basically watching this unfold as we speak. I don't think there's ever been a crypto event, a bad event this large in crypto history, I would say. And so we're going to run through, going to speed, run through what happened, the timeline of events that have unfold to where we are now as we are currently dealing with this. For the people new to this channel who don't know about the Terra Luna ecosystem will also explain at a high level how the whole thing works and how it came to a point where $50 billion was lost between the two tokens.
00:01:04.545 - 00:01:43.561, Speaker B: A lot of people have lost a lot of money as a result of this. Many were using the stablecoin out of the Terra ecosystem as a safe haven for assets going into the bear market. Ever since January, crypto assets have been going down, down, down. So people have been using the stablecoin as a flight to safety, and they've been getting yield using the stablecoin yields in this application called Anchor, which holds a very, very prominent role in this whole entire story. In addition, using us, the stablecoin out of Terra, as just a place to get yield, there were also a significant amount of funds that were getting, gaining leverage, getting leverage yield on this. Many were overexposed. Many have lost a significant amount of their net worth.
00:01:43.561 - 00:01:58.385, Speaker B: Some have lost it all. Ryan. And there are even reports of suicides out of the terror community, both in this terror subreddit and on the Terra Twitter. So this is a time to reflect as to how the hell we got here as an industry.
00:01:58.885 - 00:02:24.141, Speaker A: And that's what you could tell in our voices. We're not quite super chipper as usual, and bullish because this is a serious set of events. And I think, you know, many in the crypto community have predicted that this could happen, this would happen. I'd refer bankless listeners to a previous episode that we did not less than six weeks ago on whether Terra Luna was a ticking time bomb or not. It turns out it was a ticking time bomb.
00:02:24.213 - 00:02:25.441, Speaker B: Question is certainly answered.
00:02:25.573 - 00:02:56.905, Speaker A: And it exploded. And yet for those who have been right about Tara, this is certainly not the time to gloat. I think this is the time to reflect. And so that's the tone through which David and I are going to approach this episode. We're going to tell you exactly what happened, and we're going to reflect on the events and the implications and outcomes of those events in hopes that we don't have to repeat this. And so if you were someone who is affected by Tara, you lost a lot of money. Uh, it's terrible.
00:02:56.905 - 00:03:14.545, Speaker A: I'm sorry. It's happened to many people in crypto before. You will recover. You will come back. I have been smacked down by the markets many times in my history in crypto, and this is not the end of the world. This is recoverable. I think the crypto community will come back stronger from this.
00:03:14.545 - 00:03:30.253, Speaker A: Crypto as an asset class will come back stronger for this. There are some learning lessons that I hope you take with you and teach to the next generation who are new in this space and want to go down a path and take risks as the. The Luna Terra ecosystem has taken risks.
00:03:30.389 - 00:03:57.221, Speaker B: Yeah. Just to add on to that, I also got smacked down during my first cycle in the crypto markets. And there seems to be a lot of new people who came into crypto looking for the cool new thing and they found the very loud community of the terra ecosystem. And so this is going to be the first experience, the first, like, round of pain that a lot of first cyclers have as they come into the crypto industry. Usually it's not this acute. Usually it's not. Or this sharp or this sharp.
00:03:57.333 - 00:03:59.785, Speaker A: Believe how fast it happened, Right?
00:03:59.825 - 00:04:29.933, Speaker B: Yeah. So, I mean, when I lost all my Net Worth in 2018, it was just a slow decline from the top down to the bottom, but it was not a collapse like this.

There's two tokens in the Terra ecosystem. There's the Luna token and that's the native asset of the layer 1 blockchain ether to Ethereum, Bitcoin is to Bitcoin, Luna is to Luna.
00:07:01.155 - 00:07:02.343, Speaker B: Luna Terra.
00:07:02.399 - 00:07:05.191, Speaker A: Terra is the chain and Luna is the asset of the chain.
00:07:05.263 - 00:07:40.617, Speaker B: Right. And so people stake Luna to process the blockchain. But what's unique the Luna Terra ecosystem is that it's a two token model. So there's a native stablecoin called US T which is pegged to the dollar that is a part of the consensus protocol of the blockchain because it's, it's tied to Luna. And so there it's an algorithmic stablecoin which means it's a stablecoin that it maintains its pegged to a dollar via incentives. But there is no hard collateral backing the actual US there's only redemptions for, for Terra, for Luna. Excuse me.
00:07:40.617 - 00:08:21.919, Speaker B: So users can swap the luna token for UST and vice versa at a guaranteed price of $1 regardless of the market price of either token at any time. So there's the market price of US that trades on centralized exchanges like Binance or on decentralized exchanges like Curve. Both of these things become relevant later in the story. And that price can fluctuate. But as a part of the protocol built into the protocol, you can swap one to one $1 for $1 of UST to Luna, the token. And this is how it maintains the peg because you can arbitrage the opportunity between the price in the secondary market with the actual redemption price of UST to Luna. It maintains its peg.
00:08:21.919 - 00:08:51.697, Speaker B: Now we have this is called an algorithmic stablecoin. I also like to call these reflexive stablecoins because it requires this peg mechanism to actually work. Unlike many of the other stablecoins that we find out in the ecosystem. US DC and Tether for example, are one to one redemptions for actual dollars in a bank. So they are not prone to these reflexive moves. And then there's also dai, which is more decentralized, which has actual hard collateral backing it. UST does not have hard collateral backing it.
00:08:51.697 - 00:09:13.015, Speaker B: And that is ultimately what came to cause the collapse of the stablecoin. We've seen algorithmic stablecoin experiments on Ethereum many, many times before. None of them have worked. But this was an algorithmic stablecoin experiment as a layer 1 blockchain which is unique and novel and seemed to actually propel it into success up until it finally collapsed. Ryan, any comments on that?
00:09:13.135 - 00:09:43.755, Speaker A: Yeah, Do Kwon is a name that you'll hear. He was the founder of Luna and definitely spokesperson, almost operating as kind of the Jerome Powell of the Luna Terra, UST ecosystem. And it's also this, this was news as of today. Not his first time doing an algorithmic stablecoin. We'll get to more of that later. But David, I just to set the mental model for this a little bit. I don't know if you've ever read anything by Nassim Taleb, but he has this analogy he uses about tail risk events.
00:09:43.755 - 00:10:11.695, Speaker A: And this is something that Vitalik said on our last podcast about stablecoins that are algorithmic and reflexive in the way that UST and Luna was. And that's they can be going along swimmingly somewhat like the turkey. Right. So imagine a turkey, he's getting fed every day by the farmer. Wow, isn't the a wonderful life? Someone comes and feeds me every day. I don't have to go hunt for my food. Fat and happy hanging out with other turkeys.
00:10:11.695 - 00:10:37.865, Speaker A: Life's good one day, life's good the next day. Life just keeps getting better and better and better. And this is a chart of the life of a turkey from 1 to 1000 days. Of course, turkey is humming along fine until there is this surprise event the turkey didn't realize was actually going to be eaten. Okay. And so all at once, his world collapse collapses around him. I know that's kind of a graphic way to describe what happened.
00:10:37.865 - 00:11:03.855, Speaker A: But what's. Interestingly, what. Interestingly enough, this is how the Terra chart looks. Yeah, it's pretty similar to the life of a turkey in that it was going very well, it kept very stable from, you know, a dollar price just oscillating by like a few tenths of a of a cent along that price until bam, tail risk event. It was hit and got knocked off its peg in a big way. David, do you want to take us through the timeline of events here?
00:11:03.935 - 00:11:36.485, Speaker B: Yeah. So in order to get started, we have to explain the anchor protocol because that is the thing that a lot of absorbed a lot of US T supply. So Terra has had insane growth over the last six months. And people have been using Terra to get UST into anchor protocol to get an astounding 20% yield. And that's where this whole thing really starts. These are the months leading into 2022 and also from January to where we are. Up till about a week ago, the anchor protocol on Terra received a bunch of inbound deposits.
00:11:36.485 - 00:12:14.885, Speaker B: And so we just saw a grow in total value locked from roughly like 3 to 4 billion dollars in January to up to, I think at the very peak, $14 billion in deposits where it was a Week ago. And again it came from a bunch of subsidized yields. And so this was Terra's growth strateg. This was marketing for Terra. This was juicing up the yields to attract deposits. And so the actual yield, the true yield coming from the cost of borrowing was something like 8 to 10%, which was also pretty good. But then that number was subsidized by just the Terra project of just juicing up the yields in order to attract growth.
00:12:14.885 - 00:12:54.593, Speaker B: And so people were depositing us into the anchor protocol to get these yields. And the anchor protocol did amazing things for the, for the adoption of Terra. Late March was when we see the Terra project buy a bunch of bitcoin to help backstop the US T peg. So this is something that like, like nation states participate in this when they put foreign assets on their Fed, like on their federal bank account, when in order to defend the price of their, their currency. Right. And so this is a very similar thing. The Luna Foundation Guard, which is what the LFG is purchased almost 25,000 bitcoins for a total balance of $1.1
00:12:54.593 - 00:13:06.771, Speaker B: billion. And this happened on March 26th. And so this is them starting to shore up their own assets and put ammo into their, into their quiver so that if they ever did have to defend the peg, they would have a bunch of ammo to do it.
00:13:06.883 - 00:13:12.667, Speaker A: You want a hard asset to defend the peg, similar to how a nation state might buy gold and keep gold in their reserves.
00:13:12.771 - 00:13:35.791, Speaker B: Right, exactly. This also drew criticisms and qualms from others. Myself and I think, Ryan, you would join me in that. We like our protoc calls to not need foreign assets to be self sustainable. And so this is in my mind an admission that, you know, that needs external help to defend the peg. For crypto L1 blockchains, we like these things to not need external dependencies to operate on.
00:13:35.863 - 00:13:42.215, Speaker A: So this started because these were held in a, in a multisig, in a custody. It's just off chain, it's not even on chain.
00:13:42.295 - 00:14:15.075, Speaker B: Right. But like that, that is just the culture of the Terra project that was cool with them. And so they grew a balance sheet of over $1.1 billion starting on March 6th. And so they were selling UST to buy Bitcoin to add to the LFG, the Luna Foundation Guard Reserve during the same time, this is when the attack starts. Somebody we don't really know who, there is a bunch of speculation at the same time is borrowed 100,000 bitcoins, which is a lot of bitcoin. So this is a very well capitalized player.
00:14:15.075 - 00:15:00.385, Speaker B: There's, there's speculation all over the place. No, not real, any clarity here, but they borrow 100,000 bitcoins and are selling into the Luna foundation guards purchasing of bitcoins to fund what will ultimately become the attack on Terra that brought it down. And so some entity borrows 100,000 bitcoin, sells it into the market and that this begins on March 27th. And so the somebody, some entity has a very well capitalized war chest which will ultimately come to bring down the whole entire system. We don't know, we can't see this happening in the moment, but we just know that this is true in hindsight. And so as a result, and there's also the story of the curve pools on Ethereum. And so the curve pool is where a lot of stable coins on Ethereum get a lot of liquidity.
00:15:00.385 - 00:15:40.217, Speaker B: And there is UST on Ethereum cross cross bridged from the Terra ecosystem to the Ethereum ecosystem. And Do Kwon and the Terra ecosystem has been promoting this four pool where four different stable coins have liquidity, adding Terra UST to the mix. And so there, there's a current paradigm of the three pool. And they were about to migrate to the four pool based on curve governance. This is a topic for another day. But they had to, people had to withdraw liquidity out of the three pool to put it into the four pool. And during that window of time when, when liquidity out of the three pool was being pulled, that is when the, this attack happened.
00:15:40.217 - 00:16:18.401, Speaker B: They're calling this an attack because the liquidity was removed from the three pool. The peg for UST was susceptible. And so the attacker, who had almost a billion dollars worth of UST which they amassed from selling bitcoin for ust, started selling UST into the curve pools. And what that does is that lowers the price of UST because they're selling it. And that puts other stablecoins into the hands of the buyers. Stablecoins like USDC or DAI or FRAX or other stablecoins. And so this starts to offset the peg.
00:16:18.401 - 00:16:54.965, Speaker B: And this started happening on March or on May 7th. And you can see, you can see this very early blip of Red on March 7th where they start to sell UST into the curve pool to start to destabilize the peg. This is when the Luna foundation guard has to begin selling the BTC that they purchased in order to defend the peg. But bitcoin, when they bought Bitcoin it was roughly at $42,000. And then they started to have to sell bitcoin at roughly $34,000 because the market had moved downwards in that time. So the value of their reserves had gone down and then they're forced to sell it.
00:16:55.665 - 00:17:16.301, Speaker A: Yeah, you can see the wobble. And that's what systems like this tend to do. It starts with a wobble. So picture a bike going down a hill and it's going too fast. Maybe this was me as a kid and I had a total wipeout out. I was on a tiny BMX bike and the first sign that you're going too fast, you start to wobble. Right.
00:17:16.301 - 00:17:32.517, Speaker A: And so your tires are moving back and forth and then it moves into the wobbling increases, more wobble here. And then catastrophic failure and complete wipeout. What's, what's also interesting is what you just described. The attacker. It's, it's also a known attack. I mean this has happened to currencies in the past.
00:17:32.581 - 00:17:33.821, Speaker B: This is a George Soros attack.
00:17:33.893 - 00:17:54.273, Speaker A: A Soros attack? Yeah. George Soros, in the early 1990s or late 1980s, I can't recall, use this type of an attack to destabilize the British pound when the central bankers in the UK were using the pound and trying to peg it. So this is a very well known attack for these sorts of pegged monetary instruments.
00:17:54.409 - 00:18:31.227, Speaker B: Getting back into the attack, the attacker, who amassed over $1 billion, a billion US T. Because if they have a bunch of US T, that means they have a bunch of US T to sell, which means somebody needs to absorb what will ultimately become 1 billion US token sell pressure. And so during this initial, the first phase of this attack, they sell 350 million USD into the curve pool. And that is what causes the initial destabilization. And this is where a lot of people start to pay attention here. And there are many different participants in the Luna Terra ecosystem. Many of them are funds and then many of them are retail.
00:18:31.227 - 00:19:08.987, Speaker B: So the funds understand that they are playing a game of chicken because these Terra anchor yields are just not sustainable. They know that this is kind of a game of chicken and it's really going to be a game of who can sell when the time comes up. And so when the peg goes down to about 97 and a half cents during this first sell off of a 350 million USD, this I think is when a lot of funds started to clue in, is like, hey, something's happening here. So we got to pay extra close attention. Meanwhile, retail, they don't pay attention to stuff like this. They're not as Sophisticated. They don't know how to do the research, they don't know how to look on chain and they're busy doing their normal day jobs.
00:19:08.987 - 00:19:22.175, Speaker B: And so the funds are keeping a very close eye on the peg, watching other funds and other market makers and how much assets they have starting to do. The Mexican standoff, it's just like, all right, who's selling, who's selling what?
00:19:22.555 - 00:19:24.713, Speaker A: And you gotta shoot first and shoot fast.
00:19:24.769 - 00:20:13.331, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. That's exactly right. And so this is when at this point in time around May 6th or 5th or 6th or 7th, the attacker who has 650 remaining UST tokens which they got from their, their borrow, which some entity let them borrow this again, we don't know the details on this, they go to and take that 650 million USC tokens to Binance and they start aggressively selling on Binance between lots of 300,000 to 3 million USD at a time. Some people, some entities are defending the peg while this attacker is selling into the peg. So somebody is defending the peg at 0.98 cents, preventing the price from going down. But at some point that defender either just capitulates or they just pull their liquidity or they ran out of money and it breaks through the 98 cents.
00:20:13.443 - 00:20:28.361, Speaker A: This is the Binance order book. Is this what happened shortly after? And so David, you and I were actually recording a podcast with Raoul Paul when the wobbles started to intensify in this thing and we were observing in real time, you can actually get Raul's real time reaction.
00:20:28.433 - 00:20:40.565, Speaker B: Raoul, when you hopped into this recording room, UST price was at 98 cents being defended. Do you know what it is right now? It's at 92 cents. Yeah.
00:20:41.095 - 00:20:48.879, Speaker A: And then later that day the Binance order book was actually empty. What does that mean? Has he says he's never seen that before?
00:20:49.007 - 00:21:24.797, Speaker B: Yeah, so this was actually a front end glitch out of Binance because they were not prepared for to place bids below 70 cents. It's unheard of that a stablecoin would be sold at 70 cents. So this is the actual Binance actually had to enable sub 70 cent bids in order to allow the market to clear. And so this is this, it just got so low, it got wiped out that there was no bids because the front end wouldn't allow for it. Moments after the screenshot was taken, they did open up sub 70 cent bids on USD and then the price immediately fell below 60 cents. But part of this starts to create the reflexivity. This was not actually the attacker.
00:21:24.797 - 00:22:09.223, Speaker B: All of the way, as soon as the attacker broke down below the person or the entity that was defending the 0.98 cent price, this is when deposits out of anchor started to clear. So these are the funds saying, yo, somebody, somebody is selling all of their US we also have to start selling our USD because there's not enough liquidity to let us all out of the door. And so this is what happens where the attacker starts to sell us. They create and instigate other selling. And so it starts to turn into a negative feedback loop. And that's where it starts to not just be this attacker who's intentionally de pegging the price, but everyone else is willing to take the 235 cent lock loss in order just to have and shore up their profits that they've made from the yield for the last few months.
00:22:09.223 - 00:23:01.001, Speaker B: And so this, this, this feedback loop of reflexivity, this is where we why I call algorithmic stablecoins reflexive stablecoins. There's not enough liquidity for everyone, so everyone needs to sell first. And this creates basically a run on the bank. And that is what just plummeted the US tea price down to 70 cents and then even below as once they, once they opened up the orders as the US T peg fell down to 60 cents, the Luna foundation guard is having to sell their bitcoins to buy and maintain the peg as much as possible to the best of their ability. They just don't have enough ammo in the, in the reserves to keep it up. And so they are, they had to buy Bitcoin at $47,000 to sell it at $34,000 and below just to defend the peg. But the problem, Ryan, is that as they are selling Bitcoin at $34,000, they're pushing the whole entire market down.
00:23:01.001 - 00:23:37.269, Speaker B: And so the market was already going down anyways because of the interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. And so people with bitcoin positions were getting liquidated. People with ether positions were getting liquidated. This was a global market liquidation event which happens in crypto, but it was just made worse by the Luna foundation because they had to sell into the lower price. And so they sold, they bought bitcoin at the high price of 47. The value of that goes down to 34 when they have to begin selling it. And so it causes a global liquidation event for all of the markets, which just causes even more fear in the markets and especially for us and Luna holders.
00:23:37.269 - 00:24:08.297, Speaker B: And we haven't even talked about the Luna price yet, but this is basically the Problem with external collateral. Viscantis tweets out reflexivity, speculation and credit three strong but dangerous resources you can harness if you are willing to pay the price. In all three cases, it can help you bootstrap by borrowing energy from the future. But you will need to pay it back later with interest, especially with an algorithmic. Stablecoin doesn't always have the ammo to pay it back. And if it doesn't, you have a reflexivity to the downside. Do Kwon tweets out the deploying more capital.
00:24:08.297 - 00:24:34.425, Speaker B: Steady lads. And this is why Ryan earlier called him the Jerome Powell of Terra because he has to instill confidence in the peg. This is a faith based peg. This is when there's not enough liquidity for everyone. People just have to have faith that not everyone else is going to sell. And so when do Kwon tweets out deploying more capital, he's saying hey, we have enough capital, don't worry about it. And so Luna goes and empties the last of their bitcoin reserve wallet, the last $1.4
00:24:34.425 - 00:25:07.359, Speaker B: billion as they have to shore up the peg. But again it's just not enough. So Here is the US price and this is May 8th when the first first attack came with a $35 million sold into the curve pool. Price goes is that $1 falls down to 97 cents but then gets bought back up because this is just the first wave and there's plenty of ammo left. But then it starts to hover around 99.5 cents. And this is where the funds start to be like yo, what's going on? And then as time progresses we'll go to, we'll go to the next chart.
00:25:07.359 - 00:25:40.949, Speaker B: You can see the scale here. So that, that red square is what we were looking at previously. And so you can see how much worse it gets when, when there starts to be this panic as the attackers start starts to sell a bunch of US T price goes all the way down to 0.64 cents where it should be a dollar, it goes down to 64 cents. But then it gets bought back up by the remaining Luna Foundation Guard reserve ammo. And then, and so then gets bought back up to 90 cents. But then here again that square and the square on the left is what it was that what we were just looking at.
00:25:40.949 - 00:26:27.565, Speaker B: And then this is the most recent snapshot that I took just before recording this where things drop all the way down to 34 cents. Here's the price of Luna and this is also a contributing factor to the fear Going through the whole entire ecosystem where on May 4th the price of Luna was $87, it starts to also sell off because people are getting scared and so they want to reduce their exposure to the whole Luna ecosystem. Also there are many, many redemptions for UST for Luna causing and because people want to get out of UST because it's losing the peg. And so they're, they're selling USD for Luna. Luna is getting minted because that's part of the algorithmic stablecoin. And then that is getting sold. And so that goes from $87 on the fourth down to something like $65 on the seventh.
00:26:27.565 - 00:27:07.221, Speaker B: And then on the, by the ninth it's down to like $52. And then today the tenth it hit a low of one and a half dollars. And so this is a total collapse of the value of the Luna token, which is the last line of defense for backstopping the value of us. And this is when the total market cap of us Ryan, starts to actually pass the total market cap of Luna, which is bad. You don't like that because this is the Terra token is the thing that ultimately comes to be the final collateral of the U.S. t. And when there's more outstanding liabilities than there are assets, then only some people can make it out alive.
00:27:07.221 - 00:27:18.783, Speaker B: And so this is how we end up where we are today, where Luna is down 99% over a one week period of time and there is billions of dollars of outstanding UST that have no actual market value.
00:27:18.919 - 00:27:52.499, Speaker A: Yeah. So guys, what we just witnessed is a textbook downward spiral of an algorithmic stablecoin. Basically textbook. And the surprising thing is how quickly it happened. But once it started happening, I mean this is a three day period of time, we witnessed the wobble and then we witnessed the total collapse of both Luna and ust. There were attempts to defend it, there were attempts to try to resurrect it. Do Kwon and others tried to re inject confidence in the market, was unable to handle the downward pressure forces.
00:27:52.499 - 00:28:34.639, Speaker A: And having something like Bitcoin on the reserve to try to protect this is not actually something you want to hold during a downward spiral event because that's a very correlated asset to the rest of the crypto market. If anything, you'd want a completely decorated asset to the market that would hold steady in this kind of downward pressure spiral. So David, that is the total collapse in a three day period of time. I think all of crypto was not surprised necessarily that this happened, but certainly all in crypto were surprised that it happened this quickly. And like this, I guess emphatically, I mean, like I said, this is absolute textbook. David, do you want to talk about the fallout from this? Because now we have to deal with the fallout.
00:28:34.727 - 00:29:05.027, Speaker B: Yeah, right. And just to recap the numbers, Luna, The Luna, the L1 asset went from $41 billion down to $1 billion market cap, so lost $40 billion of capital. USC goes from $18.7 billion to $5.2 billion, probably lower at the time of recording. And so, like I said, there's over $50 billion, almost $50 billion for the crypto OGs that have been around since last cycle. We had this Ponzi scheme, this actual Ponzi scheme, where everyone knew it was a Ponzi scheme.
00:29:05.027 - 00:29:25.423, Speaker B: Other people were calling Terra a Ponzi scheme, but other people were saying no. So it was up for debate and, like, people kind of were capitulating and letting the Luna ecosystem kind of just like, ride without really giving it too much, too much flack. Now, in hindsight, now everyone's calling it a Ponzi scheme. In hindsight, Big Connect was not that. Big Connect was a Ponzi scheme through and through. Everyone knew it. It was $3.5
00:29:25.423 - 00:29:54.793, Speaker B: billion at the top when it fell down to zero. This is so much larger than that. And so I took some time and I photoshopped to superimpose the value of the BitConnect market cap on top of the value of the Luna market cap. And so you can see just how much larger this is. And this and the blue line being Luna, of course, does not include the value of UST, which also lost. You can add on another like $12 billion on top of of that. So the massive amount of just capital destruction that has just happened is unfathomable.
00:29:54.793 - 00:29:58.113, Speaker B: I've never seen it. No one has ever seen anything like it in the crypto space.
00:29:58.249 - 00:30:13.185, Speaker A: Nick, billion dollars. And this is all targeted on Luna holders primarily. It seeped out into other areas of the crypto ecosystem. But it was amazing how resilient actually Bitcoin and Ether have been to the prices. It certainly seeped out into other alternative layer ones.
00:30:13.305 - 00:30:53.839, Speaker B: Arbitrum is an Ethereum layer 2 scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use divide and NFT. Over 300 projects have already deployed to Arbitrum, and the DEFI and NFT ecosystems are growing rapidly. Some of the coolest and newest NFT collections have chosen Arbitrum as their home. All the while, DEFI protocols continue to see increased usage and liquidity. Using Arbitrum has never been easier, especially with the ability to deposit directly into Arbitrum through all the exchanges including Binance, FTX, Huobi and Crypto.com. once inside, you'll notice Arbitrum increases Ethereum speed by orders of magnitude for a fraction fraction of the cost of the average gas fee. If you're a developer who wants low gas fees and instant transactions for your users, visit Arbitrum IO Developer to start building your DAPP on Arbitrum.
00:30:53.839 - 00:31:30.857, Speaker B: If you're a degen, many of your favorite dapps on Ethereum are already on Arbitrum, with many moving over every day. Go to bridge.arbitrumio now to start bridging over your eth and other tokens in order to experience defi nfts in the way it was always meant to be fast, cheap, secure and friction free. The layer 2 era is upon us. Ethereum's layer 2 ecosystem is growing every day and we need bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a Layer two life. Across is the fastest, cheapest and most secure cross chain bridge with across, you don't have to worry about the long wait times or high fees to get your assets to the chain of your choice. Assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously.
00:31:30.857 - 00:32:15.105, Speaker B: Across bridges are powered by UMA's optimistic oracle to securely transfer tokens from Layer back to Ethereum. A token proposal is being deliberated as we speak in the across forum where community members will decide on the token distribution. You can have your part of acrost's story by joining the discord and becoming a co founder and helping to design the Fair Fair launch of acrost. If you want to bridge your assets quickly and securely, go to acros to to bridge your assets between Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum or Boba Networks. MakerDAO is the OG DeFi protocol. The MakerDAO produces Daisy, the industry's most battle tested and resilient stablecoin Using Maker, you don't need to sell your collateral if you need liquidity. Instead you can spin up a Maker vault and use your collateral to mint DAI directly.
00:32:15.105 - 00:32:43.355, Speaker B: With Maker, the power to mint new money is in your hands. The Maker protocol is extremely hardened and operated by one of the most experienced daos in existence. They've been here since the beginning. They've seen it all and so you can mint DAI with the assurance that your collateral is safe. Soon Maker will be present on all chains and L2s so minting Dai can take place on Oasis app Xerion Zapper or any other defi protocol that you use. Follow Maker on Twitter @makerdao and learn from the oldest and most resilient dao in existence.
00:32:44.295 - 00:32:51.095, Speaker A: This is the sort of thing that starts to get regulators attention and those in government's attention. What does he say here?
00:32:51.175 - 00:33:38.301, Speaker B: Yeah, he said, he says 40, 40 billion. This is an old tweet. It's now 50, almost totally destroyed in the space of a month in the sheer, in terms of sheer magnitude is probably the most significant collapse in the history of the crypto space. And then not even 12 hours later, we see Janet Yellen talking about it on the Capitol in the U.S. capitol, about the UST, the destruction of capital and the need for regulation. And so this has already caught the attention of regulators and to start to pay attention to the cryptocurrency ecosystem. And this was our fear, our explicit fear on Bankless about like, if this thing gets too big and it does collapse, it's going to bring the arm of the regulators down for the whole entire crypto ecosystem because they are not educated enough to understand the difference between us T, DAI tether or other cryptocurrencies.
00:33:38.301 - 00:33:43.485, Speaker B: They're just going to lump them all together. So this is just a black, black cloud over the ecosystem at the moment.
00:33:43.565 - 00:34:31.783, Speaker A: Terra USD experienced a run and had declined in value. And. Well, so I think that simply illustrates that this is a rapidly growing product and that there are risks to financial stability and we need a framework. When you're faced with what we saw just happen, basically the shit show that just happened, I mean, who's going to stand up and say, no, actually there's some innovation here. It's hard, it's very difficult to make the case. This is why we said a couple of Bankless episodes ago to those who are saying, hey, don't worry about Terra, it's fine, don't be a decentralization maximalist, an ethereum maximalist or whatever. It's just we're hopeful, Do Kwon, don't screw it up.
00:34:31.783 - 00:34:41.655, Speaker A: Well, this is really screwing it up for a lot of people. And I think one of the most significant worries coming out of this is the regulatory backlash that we might face as an industry.
00:34:41.815 - 00:35:32.259, Speaker B: Yeah, that's exactly right. And while a lot of this loss was contained inside of the Luna ecosystem, it has definitely spilled out into funds. A lot of funds are going bankrupt at the moment that are based on Luna and the funds that are having positions both inside and outside of Luna are going to have to sell Bitcoin and Ether and other other assets to account for their losses. And so the losses of the Luna ecosystem do spill over into the rest of the space. There's, there's a big question as to like whether or not this was a black swan event or whether or not this was a coordinated attack. The Terra ecosystem is definitely leaning into this was a multilevel economic hitman attack. And while it does appear that there is one like well capitalized entity that maneuvered this trade or this attack, it really doesn't matter.
00:35:32.259 - 00:36:10.447, Speaker B: It's a semantics difference as to whether it's a trade or an attack. Right. It's an attack if you're in a victim, but it's really just a trade because people saw an opportunity to make a billion dollars. And so I haven't said this yet, but the entity that borrowed $100,000 of Bitcoin, sold it into the market, bought a bunch of US tea to kill the peg. They made out with roughly $900 million of profit from us. And so this was a rational actor who saw an opportunity in the market to walk away with $900 million while also causing the collapse of the whole entire ecosystem. It's beside the point as to whether it's a coordinated attack or a trade.
00:36:10.447 - 00:36:43.391, Speaker B: All that matters is that if it can be attacked, it will be attacked. And Luna had this weakness from day one. Many people called it out. Many people were aggressively silenced by the Luna ecosystem, by the, what we call the lunatics who were silencing discontent. They were swarming our YouTube channel, they were swarming us on Twitter. And anyone that expressed any amount of bearishness were just harassed by this community as being eth maxis or whatever. And so there's definitely some part of the Luna ecosystem that probably in the back of their mind saw this weakness but didn't want to account for it.
00:36:43.391 - 00:36:49.415, Speaker B: So they just harass others who pointed it out. And so this is, this is behavior that we've seen in crypto Twitter before.
00:36:49.875 - 00:37:43.363, Speaker A: I think we've seen it in other communities before that have faced a similar outcome. Vitalik even had words about this when we recorded with him about three or four weeks ago. This is a clip from Vitalik. Probably, you know, Dai Rye, maybe USDC are like the only three stablecoins that we really need at the same time. Like, you know, I do see the value in ongoing innovation and like there's definitely no projects that are getting under recognized, but there's also these other projects that are just doing kind of insanely risky, under collateralized, barely collateralized sort of stuff. And that are trying to market themselves on how optimal they are without really caring about how fat their fat tails are. The biggest fallacy that people have in terms of judging stable coins, for example, is that I feel like the way that a lot of especially newbies judge a stablecoin is they're like, if a stablecoin's price stays between between 0.99
00:37:43.363 - 00:37:58.491, Speaker A: and 1.01, then it's good. And like, that mindset is very wrong. Right? Because whether a stable coin, like jumps up and down by 2% or 0.2% isn't a function of how good the stablecoin is. It's a function of how good the market maker is. And anyone can hire a good market maker for a short period of time.
00:37:58.643 - 00:38:24.067, Speaker B: Somebody else that saw it coming, who I deeply respect in the space is Hazu. And Hazu says USC is worse than bitconnect. At least bitconnect didn't masquerade as a stablecoin. When your Ponzi targets people's savings, not their investment portfolio, there is a special place in hell reserved for you. Half of crypto, Twitter influencers, VCs and trading firms are complicit. He follows up with another tweet saying, if you supported UST in the past, you don't get to look away now. And this is, this is the dark part of the story.
00:38:24.067 - 00:39:08.993, Speaker B: And so we're going to the Luna Terra subreddit where you can see the national number for the suicide hotline pinned. And this was a very common thing in 2018. And then there are other stories where people have said that they have lost all of their savings. Some people are reporting stories where their colleague has committed suicide. There's many, many people saying that they've lost all of their savings, their friends savings, their family savings. So this went straight to the heart of retail who were just not informed enough to be able to gauge these risks and were of course, the last ones holding the bag because the funds, who are professional, were the first ones out the door because they're good at this stuff. So this whole thing, like $50 billion of capital just absolutely destroyed.
00:39:08.993 - 00:39:14.865, Speaker B: People take their lives for that amount. We saw people take their lives in 2018, and we're doing it all over again.
00:39:15.405 - 00:39:53.525, Speaker A: That's the other thing where regulators begin to take notice is when this starts to affect and happen to retail, regular, everyday people, right? When it's cloistered off to a small experimental group in crypto, a bunch of defi degens and something blows up as it has previously, who cares? We already had caution tape over that thing. Retail wasn't getting involved. The insidious thing about this collapse is that the Terra ecosystem ust was actually targeting retail. Put your money in this account. Let's integrate it with top CDFI apps. You could create an app and use anchor as a protocol to receive 20%. It's hidden under the covers.
00:39:53.525 - 00:40:01.407, Speaker A: I think that's going to be a lasting blemish on the industry as well and get regulators attention.
00:40:01.601 - 00:40:33.125, Speaker B: Definitely. Somebody that has now received a lot of the ire of the community is Do Kwon, the leader behind the terror ecosystem. And Do Kwon people were pointing out how confident and cocky Do Kwon behaviors Twitter was. He was one of the people that I would say was the main culprit behind instigating this very toxic culture out of the Luna ecosystem. Here he is taking a $200 million bet about the price of the asset Luna in one year time. I mean sorry but found L1 founders do not do this. Not, not good ones by any means.
00:40:33.125 - 00:40:53.685, Speaker B: Don't make bets on Twitter about the price of their asset. Of course he also has this famous comment by my hand, die will die die the stablecoin because he had, he had it out for the Makerdao community when some of them started talking negatively about Basis Cash, which we will later find out, Do Kwon was a part of.
00:40:54.535 - 00:40:55.183, Speaker A: Spoiler.
00:40:55.279 - 00:41:20.423, Speaker B: Spoiler, yeah. And so Do Kwan of famously tweets out by my hand Dai will die. I actually respond my money is on Dai simply because Makerdao is the most just like trusted and just like well secured stablecoin there is in crypto Twitter. And I was absolutely just harassed by Do Kwon himself. So Do Kwon gives this oh really like meme and then follows up with saying only an eth maxi would bet on something that he's already lost. Giving the bicycle helmet. No brain.
00:41:20.423 - 00:41:25.505, Speaker B: No brain. Like this is not the behavior of a responsible founder.
00:41:25.885 - 00:41:34.013, Speaker A: Very popular tweets too. It's like this community would swarm and basically overwhelm ratio you on Twitter on some of these comments.
00:41:34.149 - 00:42:20.179, Speaker B: And so we call this now toxic insecurity where they know that their ecosystem doesn't really have all their weaknesses covered and so they just make sure that no one talks negatively about their ecosystem on Twitter. And so this is actually where we discover as of today, as of the time of recording, Do Kwon was also behind the earlier failed algo Stablecoin called Basis Cash, which also imploded, but it imploded much earlier in its life cycle. And caused much less harm in the ecosystem. So there was an anonymous founder called Rick and Morty and who actually turns out that was Do Kwon and other employees of Terraform Labs. So after Bait Basis Cash exploded, I guess they just rotated into doing the same thing, but as a layer one, which is crazy.
00:42:20.307 - 00:42:55.757, Speaker A: Funny story. So I didn't personally lose anything in the UST Luna ecosystem because it had so many red flags. When Basis Cash started, I was introduced to a Rick Sanchez on Telegram by a VC venture capitalist that I very much respect. And Rick Sanchez in Telegram, the pseudo anonymous founder went on to describe what Basis Cash was. Tried to get me very excited about it. I ended up putting a little bit of money in, like a very small amount because there's some possibility that an Algo stablecoin would be successful. But I knew it's like fraught with massive amounts of risk.
00:42:55.757 - 00:43:29.445, Speaker A: And then later the founders of that project completely abandoned it after it crashed. I ended up losing the little amount that I put in. It was a learning lesson at that time. Again, not my first one, by the way. I've seen a few of these Algo stablecoins try to make something. But the way I think that Do Kwon abandoned that project, right, speaks very much to what he intends to do or his intents for the Luna Terra ecosystem. At least it's a data point that people should factor in if he was willing to abandon that project.
00:43:29.445 - 00:43:34.081, Speaker A: Like, what are his intents behind Luna and Terra? It calls all of that into question.
00:43:34.193 - 00:44:04.815, Speaker B: Let me ask you a question real quick. Does evil exist? And if so, can one detect and measure it? But we didn't have that information because we didn't know that he was behind Bait Basis Cash until literally today. And so all of this stuff is coming out. Tim Copeland tweets tweets out. We're also watching some people who have previously promoted UST on Twitter delete their tweets because of obvious reasons. And so, like, the thing is, like, we've seen this before. We've seen Algo stablecoins come and go.
00:44:04.815 - 00:44:24.471, Speaker B: It should be no surprise that this Algo stablecoin blew up. Once again, Viscantis tweets who tweets out some really good advice for those. For those. This is a message for those who are. Who feel lost as a result of this, who lost a bunch of money. Viscantis gave out this tweet saying, I don't know who needs to hear this, but losing all of your money is not the end of the world. Even losing more than you Have.
00:44:24.471 - 00:44:45.931, Speaker B: Don't do anything stupid. I've never shared this, but once I was down negative $150,000 of net worth because of a very stupid mistake that I made. I was. That was a huge pile of money for me back then. And the day it happened and the subsequent two weeks afterwards were very crushing. It was hard for me to do even basic things like leave my bed and shower. I was too proud to even tell my friends about it.
00:44:45.931 - 00:45:08.635, Speaker B: So I suffered in silence. Don't do this. It's better to let it out and share. If you don't feel like sharing with a friend or any, you can't afford it. Therapy is a good thing to consider as somebody with a background in psychology, with my mom as a therapist. Therapy is tight. Like if this is hurting you psychologically and you feel like this is bottled up, I definitely would encourage you to just talk to anyone.
00:45:09.135 - 00:45:41.115, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. Feeling for the community out there and I think simultaneously it's okay to feel for the community of retail investors who didn't know any better, maybe were kind of duped into this. Sucked into them. This. It's their first time around. Listen, as we said in the intro, all of us have lost money on stupid things in crypto simultaneously. To hold that idea in your head with the idea that, hey, there were also a lot of VCs and influencers and investors and even founders who should have known better.
00:45:41.115 - 00:46:10.261, Speaker A: They should have known better. And that is not a good look for this space. So the question is, where do we go from here individually, where do you go from here? If you've been wrecked by this, our hearts go out to you. I think this great advice from Visc Antis on this. Maybe some therapy. Take a pause, go for a jog, spend time with those you love. I think for an industry, the question is how do we move on from this? And here's somewhat a cynical take.
00:46:10.261 - 00:46:13.189, Speaker A: I hope this doesn't turn out, but do you want to read this from Mike McDonald?
00:46:13.237 - 00:46:32.899, Speaker B: David yeah, the sad part is the reason why this tweet did so well is because we've seen this before. Mike McDonald gives his take as to what is about to happen. He goes the best part about this whole thing being facetious here. Doe will disappear. He's probably made life changing money. You have lost all of yours. You will also likely fall for the next grifter who employs the same tricks.
00:46:32.899 - 00:47:14.081, Speaker B: He will rebrand to something else and his next project will result in him profiting again, hopefully off of you. Again, very cynical take. But this is also what we saw out of the Wonderland fiasco. And so like 0x Sifu, who turned out to be the Quadringa Exchange scammer, just was just cycled into the next scam. There are just some people out there who are just these serial UN entrepreneurs slash scammers out there who just can't stop doing this stuff. And so hopefully if you have been burned by this, this is your last time and you would look towards other alternatives rather than these very, very attractive juicy returns on steroids ecosystems that ultimately collapse.
00:47:14.233 - 00:47:51.393, Speaker A: Yeah, the message is if this happened to you, don't let it happen to you again and try to warn the next person. We've been very critical of ecosystems like Danny Siesta from Wonderland. We got attacked from that earlier this year. It turned out not six weeks later that Danny was into some very shady things and so was his co founder and that community just kind of disappeared in a puff. We saw similar sentiments and there was a similar feel and similar vibe coming out of the Luna ecosystem and Terra ecosystem almost identified. Yeah, we put together a bull case, bear case podcast. Gave the bull case a fair shake.
00:47:51.393 - 00:48:04.041, Speaker A: Gave the bear case a fair shake. A very fair podcast. I think even the attendees thought so. And we're absolutely grilled by the lunatic community for that podcast.
00:48:04.153 - 00:48:08.033, Speaker B: That's their name by the way. That's not our name for them. They are self called the lunatics.
00:48:08.089 - 00:48:29.535, Speaker A: Yes, yes. We're not calling them lunatics. They call themselves lunatics. And so the moment where any critique or any questioning of an ecosystem or a mechanism is met with that's fud that you know, like you're just a bunch of shills. You're maximalists. You have nothing to contribute here. Rather than reasoned responses.
00:48:29.535 - 00:48:32.151, Speaker A: That's when you should get worried. Those are some warning signs.
00:48:32.263 - 00:48:57.753, Speaker B: Well, we were absolutely grilled by the Luna ecosystem and also by the Wonderland ecosystem. I do appreciate like sometimes it hurts getting grilled by those people, but ultimately there are, there are people that come out and say thank you. Here's smart programmer saying. I would like to thank myself, Ryan Sazzle Anthony Suzanne for educating us about Luna and ust. I had my money in that shit. Thanks to them I was out without getting wrecked. Feels bad for the fallen ones.
00:48:57.753 - 00:49:14.151, Speaker B: The next tweet is swag to miss a friend of ours who tweets out where are the Luna moon boys now? Who enjoyed cheating on the bankless episode when they were. When they weren't going through the existential risk. Where are you at now? And then Sazzle Anthony Suzanne says Silent, just like the frog nation that came before them.
00:49:14.263 - 00:49:46.545, Speaker A: Guys. So we've taken you through the entire life cycle of the Terra ust ecosystem and up to date now, things could happen in the future. The ecosystem could repair, could start to rebuild. If they do, hopefully they incorporate a better mechanism design. But I also hope this is a learning lesson for everyone in crypto. First of all, the risks of these things, sometimes they are not well understood. But a lot of the principles that we talk about on bankless, principles of decentralization, for instance, and security are important.
00:49:46.545 - 00:50:14.627, Speaker A: And I think this demonstrates why these fundamentals are important. Sometimes people who say stuff like this, they sound like boomers in the space. They sound like they're just old people, you know, virtue signaling, repeating common tropes. But I think this is the reason we say them, and we say them so often, say them so emphatically, is because we don't. We want to build this industry for the long term. We want to build it responsibly. We don't want to take shortcuts.
00:50:14.627 - 00:50:38.959, Speaker A: And I hope the lesson for everyone in crypto, whether you're a builder, whether you're an investor, whether you're a user of these systems, is don't take shortcuts. Let's build this thing right. Let's build this thing from first principles, decentralized all of the way. Let's not mix up fintech risk in this. Let's not become another set of bankers. Let's not create a system just like the old system that we left. We don't have to.
00:50:38.959 - 00:50:42.063, Speaker A: The future is ours. What would you say in closing, David?
00:50:42.239 - 00:51:14.969, Speaker B: Yeah, many, many people. For both inside the Terra ecosystem and outside of it, their net worth is approaching zero as the crypto markets come down. This is normal for first cyclers. My net worth basically hit zero in 2018 and then again in 2019 and then again in 2020 as we got liquidated in the March Covid dump. But, like, there's plenty of paths forward. The magnitude of the crypto revolution is still ahead of us. And so it's still the best opportunity there is in the world.
00:51:14.969 - 00:51:36.515, Speaker B: And so it hurts. Emotions are down bad. Depressed markets create depressed humans. But it's no time to just like, eject and abscond from the industry. And so there's still plenty of opportunity. This is a learning lesson that if you learn this now, hopefully you don't have to learn it later. And so there's still a bright future ahead.
