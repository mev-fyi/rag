00:00:07.050 - 00:00:12.926, Speaker A: Hey, bankless nation, welcome to another state of the nation episode. David, how are you doing today?
00:00:13.108 - 00:00:24.094, Speaker B: Absolutely fantastic. Things are heating up in the crypto ecosystem in the bankless universe. So once again, it is a fun time to be in this industry. Yeah.
00:00:24.132 - 00:00:56.826, Speaker A: Okay, so we are going to talk about tokens today, specifically ten of the top tokens in the DFI pulse index. And we brought on somebody who's actually in jail right now, Twitter jail, I should clarify. Twitter jail. Anthony Cesano is you monked himself from Twitter. Sort of a vow of silence until ETH goes over 1420. But we brought on Anthony to talk all about these tokens. Can you tell us what discussion we're about to have? David?
00:00:56.938 - 00:01:39.254, Speaker B: Yeah, so this was my idea to bring Anthony on, and it was a little bit of a claim about how we are about to enter alt season or DFI season. DFI summer 2.0. I think that's ahead of us. And so we wanted to get Anthony on the podcast to go through the tokens in the DPI index. Anthony is an advisor at Set protocol, which is the company that is part of the index co op, which produces indices, the first of which is the DPI indices in partnership with DFI Pulse. And there are ten tokens in the DPI. And so we want to go through every single one for all the new listeners out there who are looking for ways to understand tokens.
00:01:39.254 - 00:02:13.766, Speaker B: Right? Tokens are fun. They go up really high, they go down really low, but they're also really hard to understand. And so I think having a conversation with the three of us to understand how we all think of these things, how we see value being captured by tokens in different ways, and how we analyze these things, I think will be really useful for people coming into the space who are excited about investments but don't know what to do. I think this is going to be a conversation to tap into our brains and see how we model out what we see as valuable versus not valuable in this space.
00:02:13.868 - 00:02:43.214, Speaker A: Absolutely. So we talk about Aave, we talk about uni, the uni token, we talk about balancer, a bunch of the top defi tokens that you know, and really talk about the kind of the value proposition and accrual mechanisms behind them. We brought Anthony on because what else is he doing, right? He's off Twitter. Lots of time on his hands. David, what else is new in the bankless ecosystem? We have a fantastic podcast that just came out yesterday, on Monday with Lynn Alden. Can you give a sneak peek on that? Yeah.
00:02:43.252 - 00:03:19.078, Speaker B: Lyn Alden is the rising star of just macro commentary, especially as it relates to bitcoin. She's a big bitcoin enthusiast, but she's first and foremost a macro expert. I got so much value out of that podcast. My biggest takeaway was talking about the primacy of the US dollar and how that relates to us manufacturing. It turns out as there is global demand for dollars. In order to serve that demand, we need to export dollars as a country, and so we've exported our dollars. And what does that mean? When you export dollars, you import goods.
00:03:19.078 - 00:03:45.378, Speaker B: But that means we are emphasizing the manufacturing of other countries instead of our own country, which I think is part of that social unrest that we've seen in the last few years. That social unrest is a result of economic forces and the lack of jobs that we have in America. And I think that is kind of the story of 2020, is that the social unrest could be connected to the primacy of the US dollar. I thought that was absolutely crazy connection. Absolutely.
00:03:45.464 - 00:03:55.350, Speaker A: A fantastic podcast. And we just recorded another podcast that is going to come out next week that you've got to check out. Our first podcast with Drake.
00:03:55.930 - 00:03:57.366, Speaker B: Drake. Yes.
00:03:57.468 - 00:04:00.282, Speaker A: Well, should we clarify which Drake we're talking about?
00:04:00.416 - 00:04:24.302, Speaker B: Yeah, we are talking about Justin Drake, a lead researcher at the Ethereum Foundation. Justin Drake is all about cryptography. He's a cryptographer. And while we were doing our bullcase for Ethereum, bullcase for ETH, he wanted to get in on that because he had a really strong bullcase for cryptography. So that's what that conversation was all about. Ryan, what were some of your favorite takeaways?
00:04:24.366 - 00:05:13.710, Speaker A: Oh, dude. I think it was amazing to view sort of how early we are in the evolution of Ethereum and bitcoin and how far we have yet to go. It's really like we're in the stone age of this new era of compute, and I think Justin really made that clear. A lot of the challenges that we see today around centralization, like metamask or private key management, cryptography really is the answer to some of these challenges and problems. So it's a super unique episode. I don't think I've heard any crypto podcast episode with this kind of content, so make sure you tune into that and catch that. And David, because it's state of the nation, let's begin this by asking you the question I always ask.
00:05:13.710 - 00:05:15.870, Speaker A: What is the state of the nation today?
00:05:16.020 - 00:05:40.326, Speaker B: Yeah, I teased it a little bit at the beginning of this intro. The state of the nation is heating up. I put out a funny tweet that. I thought it was funny that on a three minute long popcorn bag, microwave popcorn bag timer, it feels like we're at second 45. We saw MKR Pop off go from. We just saw dot do something crazy. Things are popping off.
00:05:40.428 - 00:05:50.042, Speaker A: All right, wait, so you're saying some of those kernels in the bag, like a few of them have popped, but you still got the rest of the bag? Just only very early stages of the popping process.
00:05:50.176 - 00:06:07.042, Speaker B: Yes, that's very right. Very early stages in the popping process. And when that comes to a head, I think that's what quote unquote alt season is, or DFI Summer 2.0. This time it's DFI winter because it's literally winter. It's January. But DFI summer 2.0, I think that's ahead of us.
00:06:07.042 - 00:06:17.570, Speaker B: And again, that's why we brought Anthony Cesano on to talk about some of the best tokens in the ecosystem to use for mental models about how to understand and evaluate tokens.
00:06:18.390 - 00:06:27.570, Speaker A: And you have to be careful. Just like a popcorn bag, when you take that popcorn bag out of the microwave, you don't burn your fingers on the water vapor. Maybe I'm taking the analogy too far, David.
00:06:27.650 - 00:06:35.018, Speaker B: No, that's perfect. There's plenty of ways to get hurt by microwave popcorn. So long as you follow the instructions and play it safe, you should be good.
00:06:35.104 - 00:06:38.650, Speaker A: All right, David, let's get to the sponsors that made state of the nation possible.
00:06:38.720 - 00:07:29.210, Speaker B: Today, Gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange. I've been a customer of Gemini since I first got back into crypto back in 2017, and it has been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells. Gemini is available in all 50 states, in over 50 countries worldwide. And on Gemini, there are markets for over 30 various crypto assets, including many of the hot dFI tokens like Wifi, Ave, uni, and also they are one of the few exchanges that has liquid dai markets.

00:09:05.230 - 00:09:21.742, Speaker A: Okay, bankless nation. We're super excited to do this special state of the nation with Anthony Cisano of Ethub of Tokenset. Anthony the self jailed. How are you doing in there, Anthony? How's it going? You've been weaned off there for a while.
00:09:21.796 - 00:09:22.014, Speaker C: Actually.
00:09:22.052 - 00:09:24.450, Speaker A: Went cold turkey. How are you holding up?
00:09:24.520 - 00:09:34.302, Speaker C: Yeah, I went cold turkey. Can't post tweets. Haven't posted a tweet since January eigth. I'm okay. I am enjoying the memes. Of course. They're quite funny.
00:09:34.302 - 00:09:56.342, Speaker C: That's keeping me going. It's kind of funny how I didn't expect that to happen. I was like, wow, I'm actually getting people talking about me more within me, not even tweeting. So this is just a bit weird, but definitely feeling withdrawals because as you said, I did it cold turkey. I went from, like, tweeting a lot to nothing. And it definitely is. Like, I do realize now that I had kind of an addiction to tweeting.
00:09:56.342 - 00:09:58.460, Speaker C: So maybe it's a good thing to take a break.
00:10:00.270 - 00:10:01.546, Speaker A: Go ahead, David. Yeah.
00:10:01.648 - 00:10:27.570, Speaker D: For those that don't know, Anthony has decided to take a self imposed hiatus until ether breaks its previous all time high of $1,420. I think that's actually a pretty genius marketing move, Twitter marketing move, because, Anthony, you've made yourself synonymous with the ETH all time high. And so now when the eth breaks all time high, it's also going to be known as the time Anthony finally returns back to Twitter. I think that's a pretty genius.
00:10:28.470 - 00:10:28.930, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:10:29.000 - 00:10:50.634, Speaker C: Yeah. And the funny thing is, I didn't plan it to play out like that at all. I was actually in the car, my fiance was driving, and I'm like, what if I just put out this tweet eats at 1300. We're going to get to all time high. I know we're going to get there. So I put it out and then we kind of like, ranged a little bit, went up a little bit, and then we crashed, like 30% or whatever it was. And I'm like, that didn't.
00:10:50.682 - 00:10:52.062, Speaker D: How long did you think this didn't go?
00:10:52.116 - 00:10:53.166, Speaker B: How long did you think this is.
00:10:53.188 - 00:10:55.006, Speaker D: Going to be a window for?
00:10:55.188 - 00:11:13.410, Speaker C: A couple of days? I was so bullish. We were so close. But I think this is karma, right? I mean, some people are saying, oh, the whales are conspiring against him. They're pushing the price down to maximum pain. But who knows?
00:11:13.990 - 00:11:20.374, Speaker A: I am loving the memes that are coming out of this. This is one from DC investor, like, visualizing what Anthony is doing right now.
00:11:20.572 - 00:11:26.600, Speaker C: That is legit me, when I see the price going up, I'm just like, yes, soon. Soon.
00:11:27.050 - 00:11:31.690, Speaker A: Here's another one I put out, which is a DMS I received from Anthony.
00:11:33.550 - 00:11:37.510, Speaker C: I found it funny how many people didn't get that this was a joke.
00:11:37.590 - 00:11:38.540, Speaker A: Yeah, I know.
00:11:39.070 - 00:11:40.422, Speaker C: That was pretty funny.
00:11:40.566 - 00:11:47.920, Speaker A: It's really amazing. And people are asking how we're going to welcome you back. And DC, of course, says, let's report his account as soon as he comes back.
00:11:49.090 - 00:11:49.994, Speaker C: That was a winner.
00:11:50.042 - 00:12:01.700, Speaker A: Having a lot of fun with this. What's your prediction? So we are recording this on January the 15th. This is Friday, right? It comes out on a Tuesday of next week. Do you think you're going to be out of Twitter jail by then?
00:12:02.470 - 00:12:18.120, Speaker C: I hope so. I have high hopes for this weekend just based on my general kind of bullishness here, the sentiment. We're very close still. We're at 1200, around 1200 at time of recording. So. Yeah, I hope so. I think so.
00:12:18.120 - 00:12:28.586, Speaker C: But I mean, I said that last time when I tweeted this. I don't know how much my kind of sentiment and my feeling is kind of worth right now.
00:12:28.768 - 00:12:37.178, Speaker A: Yeah, well, we are pulling for you, my friend. And of course, we are just as excited to see Eth hit all time high and to see you get out of Twitter jail.

00:15:04.208 - 00:16:11.138, Speaker A: Wanted to talk about today, and this is kind of a topic as we're entering the bull market that I think is on a lot of listeners minds right now, is how to prepare from an asset from a portfolio perspective. So I got a text just this week from a friend of mine who's, like dabbling in DeFi and dabbling in crypto, of course. And he's wondering in this bull cycle, should he start to rotate some of his eth, maybe some of his bitcoin as well into DFI, and maybe let's start there, right? Because some people believe, of course, that bitcoin is going to eat everything. Bitcoin dominance is going to stay in the 70% type range, and it will get the majority of upside and accrual in this bear market. Right? Others believe that bitcoin might have a four to eight x, while ETH has a five to ten x, while DFI outperforms both like a ten to 20 x, possibly. Right. That's more along the lines of what I think could happen.
00:16:11.138 - 00:16:25.110, Speaker A: But what do you think could happen, Anthony? What's kind of your perspective? Do you think bitcoin goes higher, ETh goes even higher, has more upside, and Defi has more upside than both of those asset categories.
00:16:25.610 - 00:17:27.514, Speaker C: Yeah, that's my general play for sure. Just based on, I guess a lot of it is based on market cap, for sure. It's much harder to move bitcoin and ETH as opposed to Defi. But at the same time, I think Defi is a very broad category, right, where there's a lot of tokens that fall into that bucket. So if you're talking about these tokens that maybe have a really tiny market cap that can be very easily pumped or whatever, and they kind of outperform, that's just because they're very small. Right. So I guess when we're talking about Defi, what I like to think about is the Defi pulse index, which is an index of the top DeFi tokens that we have, that we created at set protocol to let you track and get exposure to Defi and that's kind of what I mean when I think about d five and when I'm talking about it to newer people, because a lot of these newer people, taking on the risk of buying the really low cap coins is not a great way for them to start in this space because they're so volatile, they can fall 50% on the day, go up 50% on the day.
00:17:27.514 - 00:17:27.850, Speaker C: Right.
00:17:27.920 - 00:17:29.500, Speaker D: And there's so many of them.
00:17:31.230 - 00:17:57.240, Speaker C: It'S just paralysis of trying to choose which ones to put your money into. And if you're not used to the volatility, you can very easily just get kind of wrecked trying to trade in and out of them. So I know we're going to talk about the DeFi pulse index in depth more, but that general kind know, BTC being outperformed by ETH and ETH being outperformed by DeFi during a bull cycle is definitely something I subscribe to.
00:17:57.690 - 00:18:46.658, Speaker D: So some listeners who have been through market cycles before might think of the term alt season, which is a little bit what we're talking about here. There seems to be a general rotation, and this is a rule of thumb, and there's totally examples of when this is invalidated. But the rule of thumb is that BTC pumps and then ether pumps and then all the other tokens pump. And so we're kind of getting prepared for perhaps that third leg of the rotation if it does indeed play out. And so looking at Coingecko, it's my belief, and I'm pretty sure Ryan's and your belief as well, that DeFi is the underserved category, right. It's below what it should be. And if you look at the market cap of all coins, excluding DFI, the market cap is over a trillion dollars.
00:18:46.658 - 00:19:22.320, Speaker D: Ryan, if you go down to that purple line in the graph below. Yeah, over a trillion dollars, whereas that blue line is just at $30 billion. So there's a huge discrepancy here. And we believe, according to the protocol sync thesis, that a lot of these protocol tokens represent upside potential to DeFi and are ready to close that gap. That's where my head is out. How do you think about that bitcoin ether, altcoins alt season cycle? And then how do you integrate specifically the DeFi tokens inside of that category as well?
00:19:23.250 - 00:19:52.854, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the thing about the alt season, it also kind of includes all the other coins and stuff out there, right? It doesn't just cover DFI, but obviously DFI falls into that from a market perspective. And you were just showing that coin gecko kind of stats there. And 30 billion being the DFI market cap, they actually include chain link in that and chain link to me, and maybe I'll anger some people by saying this to me. It's not a DFI token, it's a middleware protocol. Right. It's something like the graph. It falls into a different category.
00:19:52.854 - 00:20:11.934, Speaker C: So you can take out chain link out of that, right, and lower the DFI market cap even more. It probably lowers it to about 20 billion. So, yeah, I mean, as you pointed out, the total cap is over a trillion. Most of that is bitcoin. I think 70% of that is bitcoin almost, which is a huge amount. Right. But I don't think it's going to stay like that during this bull market.
00:20:11.934 - 00:20:51.334, Speaker C: I think, as you said, there's this rotation that goes on, people coming to bitcoin, especially newer people, and then bitcoin kind of stagnates. And then these newer people think, okay, bitcoin is going sideways. What else can I rotate into? Or can I speculate on? And especially traders, right? Traders definitely do this. They want volatility. They don't want sideways. So if they're sideways in bitcoin, they'll go to eth, then they'll go down the list. And obviously as the kind of more new money floods in and volatility heats up, then the lower cap coins which defi falls into obviously can go up a lot faster and a lot easier than the large cap coins.
00:20:51.334 - 00:21:17.160, Speaker C: So, yeah, I mean, as you said, there's plenty of evidence of this happening during bull markets. In bear markets, it doesn't really happen. People fly to safety, which is obviously cash first and then bitcoin to a certain extent. I think last cycle we didn't really see people flowing to eth for safety. Maybe this cycle we do, but yeah, it's hard to tell there. So, yeah, definitely that rotation you can see play out on the charts. It's pretty obvious.
00:21:17.160 - 00:21:19.974, Speaker C: But only in bull markets, I think.
00:21:20.172 - 00:21:59.026, Speaker A: So this is kind of the bankless portfolios, as we call it, Anthony, that we're basically describing here, which know a generous helping of crypto monies like. Right. And like bitcoin. So you have that in your portfolio and then also you want exposure to this neo banking layer, this defi layer. So if you want to drop dead simple like bankless portfolio, it's basically ether. Bitcoin and deFi, like the DPI, the DeFI pulse index. And that kind of gets you what you need to be positioned for this bull market.
00:21:59.026 - 00:22:36.186, Speaker A: At least that's kind of what we think. And if the thesis plays out that we get this cycle of bitcoin, ETH and DeFI, then you have exposure to all of those assets as they cycle into one another and out of one another. The great thing about DPI is you can just put some money in and set it and forget it. It's just an index of all of these top ten DFI protocols. But it doesn't do one thing, Anthony, and that's this. It doesn't give you exposure to the micro caps. So essentially, when you're buying the DPI, you're buying more.
00:22:36.186 - 00:23:01.960, Speaker A: So the blue chip D, five tokens, but you don't have exposure to this micro cap. And if we think DFI is going to do something like a ten to 20 x, part of the question is, does that ten to 20 x happen in the large blue chip assets, or does it happen with these micro cap DFI assets at the very bottom? And do you lose out if you don't have exposure to those micro caps? Any thought on that?
00:23:02.650 - 00:23:39.278, Speaker C: Yeah, I think with the DeFi pulse index, you're buying safety, right? You're buying less volatility on both sides. The upside and the downside, because they are, as you said, more blue chip assets. They're supported by more exchanges. A lot of them are on coinbase, for example. A lot of them are part of projects that have extreme product market fit, like Uniswap, like yearn and things like that. So that's kind of the trade off there. Whereas if you are investing in the smaller caps, right, you have a bunch of different things you have to the small cap DFI, you have a bunch of different things you have to take into consideration.
00:23:39.278 - 00:24:08.842, Speaker C: Your risk tolerance needs to go way up, right. You need to be able to stomach those 50% in a day drops. And as a new investor, I don't think many people can do that. I remember when I first got into it, I couldn't do it. It's something you have to learn and go through, and then you try to swing trade it, right, and you get kind of like wrecked, because a lot of us have to deal with taxes, too. So swing trading with taxes and everything and all this sort of stuff. It's so hard to speculate on the smaller ones.
00:24:08.842 - 00:25:03.846, Speaker C: So that's why I think DPI is perfect, even for seasoned people in crypto, because they can kind of hedge their risk with DPI, like they do with BTC and ETH, and then use a small part of their stack to go speculate on smaller cap things. But yeah, it's all just the kind of like, how much risk do you want to take if you want to be exposed to deFi, but don't want to take on a ton of risk, don't want to have to worry about rebalancing out of everything. There's an argument to be made that an index product built on our infrastructure, et cetera, is tax advantaged as well. But obviously, talk to your own tax kind of accountant for that. But there's that argument there. If you just want, like, passive diversified low risk exposure, then the DeFi pulse index is basically for you. But you can always buy some of the DeFI pulse index and then use some of the money you have left over to go speculate on the smaller cap ones.
00:25:03.846 - 00:25:09.450, Speaker C: But you do need to realize that your risk tolerance has to be much higher than it does for the DPI.
00:25:09.530 - 00:25:22.260, Speaker A: It's almost just like in the stock investing world, people will invest in indices and s and p 500, and then they'll also maybe have some money set aside to play with penny stocks and really, like small micro. That's kind of what we're talking about here.
00:25:22.710 - 00:25:54.126, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. And I think if you look at the DPI and the performance of it and how it handled the DFI kind of bear market, so it actually launched it, I think, at the top of DFI summer. So it was a bit of a bad time to launch it, but it's rebounded quite well. I think it went from $100. It started at. It dropped down to maybe $60 or something like that, which is still a pretty brutal drop. But that's crypto, right? You're going to get that volatility, and that was like DFI coming off of a really heated market.
00:25:54.126 - 00:26:27.826, Speaker C: So I think that would be the worst amount of volatility you'd see there, besides maybe the end of a bull market or a macro bull market. So, yeah, you can see here that it just dropped pretty far down. It probably went under 60, actually. Yeah, 59, something like that, which you can see 50, and then now it's gone up to over 200. Right. So it's not like you're only getting like 10% out of this. If you bought around the bottom at around like $60, you've gotten quite a nice gain over a three x since November.
00:26:27.826 - 00:26:42.906, Speaker C: So you are trading, you could have gotten a ten x on something else. Right. But the thing is, could you have picked that something else? Would you have stayed in that position? Could you have prevented yourself from getting wrecked during the drawdowns. Most people can't. And that's why also, like, there's smart.
00:26:42.938 - 00:26:51.520, Speaker A: Contract risk, there's rug pool risk, there's team risk. There's all of these risks at the small new project microcap level that you have to take into account.
00:26:52.130 - 00:27:26.810, Speaker C: Yeah. And those risks are actually commonly understated, I think, because people love to get kind of like, I guess, high on the pumps and everything. But if you want to look at the perfect example, look at what happened to cover, right, the COVID token that pumped up quite highly, and it was a very popular kind of low cap defi token. And then they had a bug in their contract which let infinite amounts of tokens be entered. And a lot of people got kind of wrecked on that. And if I. Pulse index is very strict about what tokens it includes, you'll notice that it's all high quality projects and high quality tokens.
00:27:26.810 - 00:27:41.566, Speaker C: It's not necessarily excluding smaller cap tokens because they're smaller caps. It's just because they don't meet the criteria that was outlined by Defi pulse, and that's to protect people as well, right, from this kind of thing. Know, bugs and stuff like that.
00:27:41.668 - 00:27:46.160, Speaker A: Dear Lord, that cover chart looks brutal. What is.
00:27:48.050 - 00:27:48.618, Speaker C: Bro?
00:27:48.724 - 00:28:30.142, Speaker D: So that actually leads us into the conversation that we wanted to bring you on to have Anthony. We want to use all of the tokens in the DPI and go through each individual one and use each one as an example for listeners to understand how you and how we think about these assets on an individual basis. Using the assets inside the DPI, and like you've said, the assets inside the DPI we would consider to be the safer assets. That's why they are in there in the first place. They're more justifiable, they have more usage, they have stronger value capture, and the market tends to value them more for that reason. Things like synthetix, Ave, uniswap maker, Wyron compound, these things tend to be the.
00:28:30.196 - 00:28:31.210, Speaker C: D five blue chips.
00:28:31.290 - 00:29:14.910, Speaker D: They're not going to like 100 x, but they are still going to track d five very strongly, and it's less likely for them to get rug pulled. And it's easier for new people to understand why these things have value. And I think if we go through each one and explain our mental models with them, it's going to be easier for listeners to understand how we think about these assets and be able to extend that to do their own research about. People like to speculate, people like to gamble in low cap defi tokens. We know that's going to happen. And we want to equip people with learning how we think about our mental models using some of the best examples in the DeFI pulse token index so that they can be equipped for that. So I think we should get started.
00:29:14.910 - 00:29:30.980, Speaker D: Let's go down the list of all the tokens in the DeFI pulse index. Let's start with synthetix as the token that has the highest weight. Anthony, can you explain to our listeners what synthetix network is and what the SNX token does?
00:29:32.070 - 00:30:06.126, Speaker C: Yeah, so basically, as the name says, synthetics is a synthetic asset. Know it does a bunch of different things. You can get exposure to a bunch of different synthetic assets on there, whether they be crypto assets or other assets like gold. They have currencies on there as well, like SUSD, Sald, things like that. And the SNX token is kind of at the heart of that. So what the SNX token does is it acts as collateral for the system. So people will stake their SNX as collateral and they'll be able to generate synthetic assets against that.
00:30:06.126 - 00:30:40.414, Speaker C: So a lot of people do is they generate SUSD. So the synthetic USD against that because it's the safest play. And then you might be able to do yield farming with that Susd or use it as like a stablecoin within defi sort of thing and all that sort of stuff. The SNX token also gives you governance rights as well over the platform. They have a whole governance system that they're currently building out. So I'm not sure how much governance rights you get just yet on the platform. I don't think there's any binding on chain governance yet for synthetics.
00:30:40.414 - 00:31:38.540, Speaker C: And also it captures fees too. So the SNX token, when you stake it, you actually get paid SNX tokens as a reward for that each week. But on top of that, you also get some of the fee revenue that's generated by the synthetics exchange. That's still quite small compared to kind of its market cap, because synthetics has a very high market cap. And I think as a top level thing here, actually, because we're going to be diving into all these assets. One thing that actually strikes true for a lot of them is that a lot of them have really, the top ones have really powerful narratives, really powerful communities, because a lot of these trade like growth stocks where you are basically bidding this up so high, or the market's bidding this up so high because they believe the growth potential is extreme, right? So yeah, that's kind of like the TLDR on SNX there. It's one of the best performing DFI tokens of the last couple of years as well.
00:31:39.070 - 00:32:19.862, Speaker A: So we're looking at a market cap of over 2 billion and just a massive run up over the last few months here. In terms of total locked value, it has 1.7 billion locked. So another metric we can look at, guys, is the price to sales ratio on token terminal. And synthetics right now is about 58. So if you look at PE ratios in stocks, things like Netflix are trading 80, Amazon 120 or so. So this is possibly undervalued relative to those things, but you're paying a bit more for synthetics than you're paying for some of these other assets on the charts.
00:32:19.862 - 00:32:21.340, Speaker A: Any thoughts on that?
00:32:22.430 - 00:33:05.766, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, as I said, these things trade like growth stocks, right? They will go up very quickly because of a narrative or a story. And this isn't just synthetics. You can see here how many of them trade like that right curve, are there? And that's because people are betting that these things are going to grow much, much larger. And I don't think that's a bad bet to make at this point in time, considering how early we still are in defi and all that sort of stuff. But at the same time, it lends itself to extreme volatility that I was just talking about. It's funny, like avair, during the DFI kind of mini bear market we had after the DFI summer, it actually dropped down to about $30. And at the time, I think less than that, maybe like 27 or something.
00:33:05.766 - 00:33:38.062, Speaker C: At the time I was thinking, this is insane, right? Ave's growth in just one year has been incredible, and it's going to keep growing. They're launching v two. They got all this stuff coming, and that's what you're betting on, right? And I'm sure even at $27, the multiplier might have been quite high still. But the market doesn't trade these things like that yet. It trades them based on future potential. Just like how Tesla is worth so much, right? Even though their revenue is nowhere near justifying their market cap. But people are saying, well, I think Tesla is going to change the world.
00:33:38.062 - 00:33:46.206, Speaker C: They're going to be huge. They're going to be everywhere. So I want to buy it now. So, yeah, a lot of these things trade like that. And that's why we get the extreme volatility.
00:33:46.398 - 00:34:36.580, Speaker B: I think one of the factors that is factoring into the SNX price that you might not find from metrics or on train metrics is the fact that it's likely that synthetics is going to be the first major DFI protocol to incorporate optimistic roll ups and really be the first DFI protocol that is able to scale into the l two. I think there's a decent amount of the justification of synthetics price based off of there being the first major DAP to scale speculation based off that. And that's something that you just won't find unless you are really paying attention to all of these assets and all of the ongoing things inside of Ethereum. And so you can't just look at the charts and know that. So using that as a mental model and incorporating that into other things that are also looking to scale, I think is a pretty useful thing to do.
00:34:37.270 - 00:35:00.362, Speaker C: Yeah. And on that note as well, I think with synthetix, it's also a unique case. In know. As I mentioned, SNX is used as collateral within the system, which means that most of the SNX is actually sitting in the synthetic system, not on exchanges. So you have a low float of SNX tokens that people can actually purchase. You unironically have a sell side liquidity crisis at times if there's a lot of demand for SNX. Right.
00:35:00.362 - 00:35:16.578, Speaker C: So that also plays into it. So this is why these kind of assets have all these little intricacies that you need to be aware of if you want to trade them well, right? Or if you want to invest in them well. And I guess that's why DeFI pulse index makes this really easy, because you don't have to do all of that.
00:35:16.664 - 00:36:08.194, Speaker B: If you are looking for a product that connects your fiat bank account with DeFI tokens and products, you need to download the Dharma mobile app. Dharma is a non custodial smart contract wallet and comes with a bridge that connects you right into your bank account. Dharma is the fastest and most efficient wallet between your fiat in your bank account and any token on Uniswap, or even any vault in yearn with Dharma, you can get over $25,000 per week into the DFI universe. And you can do it noncustodially. If you or anyone you know is hot on DFI and you're trying to get your money into a DFI Investment, Dharma is the place to go. Signing up and going through KYC is an absolute breeze. It took me just under 3 minutes, and after signing into my bank account via Plaid, I am now just one transaction away from any token that Uniswap has to offer.
00:36:08.194 - 00:36:19.160, Speaker B: Go to www Dharma IO. That's D-H-A-R-M-A IO. Download the Dharma app and get yourself unbanked today.
00:36:20.250 - 00:36:38.890, Speaker A: All right, let's talk about the next asset in the DPi, and that is Ave. It was formerly called Lend. The token had an absolutely incredible year. Even in the DPI, it's up like 300% or so. But last year, didn't it do something like 6000% in terms of growth?
00:36:39.870 - 00:36:41.338, Speaker C: Yeah, it was crazy going on with.
00:36:41.344 - 00:36:49.840, Speaker A: Ave. Can it repeat not 6000% level growth, but can it repeat some of the growth that it had in 2020?
00:36:51.010 - 00:37:18.006, Speaker C: It's funny because a lot of people think that Ave has been live for quite a while. But if you look back Ave's platform, so its money market only launched in January of 2020. So they were actually building it out for years. And as you said, it was known as the lend token. Back then. It had a much smaller market cap, I think in 2019 and early 2019, it had a market cap of $5 million or something like that. Now it's over $2 billion, I think last time I checked, or something crazy like that.
00:37:18.006 - 00:37:45.902, Speaker C: And yeah, it's only been live for a year. They just launched their v two. So there's all this kind of speculation, as I mentioned before, on the fact that they're going to keep growing and they have been growing. They're growing like crazy. And so everyone just loves the arbit token. But it's funny because that token actually launched in 2017 as part of an ICO, and it went up right during the 2017 mania. Then it came down and it stayed down, like really kind of brutalized for a while.
00:37:45.902 - 00:38:01.958, Speaker C: And some people made life changing money on this because they scooped it up when it was low because they followed the project. This is another thing. If you follow the project closely and you kind of get to know the team, you get to know what they're building during bear markets. It's like a perfect time because you get to.
00:38:02.044 - 00:38:08.754, Speaker A: It was the time they said Ethereum was dead. They said every project that raised via ICO was basically an exit scam.
00:38:08.802 - 00:38:08.966, Speaker C: Right.
00:38:08.988 - 00:38:14.300, Speaker A: And here's Aave continuing to build and continuing to ship. And that's why they were so undervalued during the bear market.
00:38:14.830 - 00:38:47.714, Speaker C: Yeah. And SNX was actually in the same spot. So those two are something that I commonly use as an example of ignoring the this is dead. This is that kind of Fud in bear markets and just making sure that you understand what's actually not dead, what kind of Runway these teams still have to build out these products and kind of like the product market fit the potential product market fit. But yeah, Ave is just like one of the best stories. They went from zero to billions in their protocol in just a year. Absolutely incredible story.
00:38:47.832 - 00:39:04.486, Speaker A: And they are number two on the d five pulse leaderboard in terms of total value locked. They've got 3 billion assets under management right now on token terminal. They are generating 56 million in revenue on an annualized basis, which is pretty impressive.
00:39:04.518 - 00:39:07.754, Speaker C: With the price of sales, I think it's 53 million. Sorry.
00:39:07.872 - 00:39:23.150, Speaker A: Oh God. I'm looking at synthetics again, 53 million. So a price to sales ratio of 48. So pretty impressive asset. So what's kind of your consensus on this then, Anthony? Are you bullish, bearish neutral?
00:39:23.570 - 00:39:48.866, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, it's pretty obvious that I'm very bullish on it going forward. I think money know, lending, borrowing is the greatest product market fit in DeFi outside of amms. So yeah, definitely very bullish on Arber going forward. And I actually want to note one thing about their growth that I think makes it even more impressive. They didn't do any liquidity mining. All that growth was unsubsidized. That was natural growth.
00:39:48.866 - 00:40:00.794, Speaker C: And a lot of Defi protocols don't have that. So that just lends itself to another kind of really bullish aspect of AAVE, is that their product is just so good that you don't even need to subsidize the growth.
00:40:00.922 - 00:40:09.790, Speaker A: Wow, that's a really interesting point. Okay, let's go to our next asset on the list, which is Uniswap. So tell us about Uniswap.
00:40:10.930 - 00:40:55.866, Speaker C: Yeah, so I guess Uni, the Uniswap token, was launched last year to much fanfare, but I'll quickly just give an overview of Uniswap and why it was revolutionary, I think. So Uniswap launched, or at least I think the idea for Uniswap had been around for a very long time. Vitalik actually wrote a blog post on the design for Uniswap very early on. And then Hayden Adams, the founder of Uniswap, took that blog post and kind of ran with it and built a product around it. Launched it in 2018, I'm pretty sure, and then launched a v two later on. And then in 2020, they launched their token. So Unisop is an automated market making kind of a trading platform or swap exchange.
00:40:55.866 - 00:41:36.010, Speaker C: It basically lets anyone be a liquidity provider. So if you have a bunch of kind of tokens like you have ETH and you want to kind of liquidity provide eth against USD, you can do that, no one could stop you. It's fully permissionless, fully decentralized, and then you can earn kind of exchange fees. So from there, Uni launched the token and it got airdropped to every user of Uniswap. 400 uni tokens, which right now is worth a lot more than it was back then. I think uni is at what, $7, I just saw. So worth a nice amount of money then, but at the time it was still worth, I think, about $1,000 when it first, like on day one.
00:41:36.010 - 00:42:04.030, Speaker C: So that was like a very nice airdrop for every Uniswap user. So even if you had actually failed a transaction on Uniswap for one reason or another, you still got Uni tokens because you had interacted with the protocol. So yeah, you had that launch. And the uni token right now is just a governance token. It doesn't do anything else except governance. In the future, the hope is that it'll capture fees from the network. And Unisop is generating an insane amount of fees for the liquidity providers.
00:42:04.030 - 00:42:32.938, Speaker C: But there has to be a split between liquidity providers and the uni token holders. So the proposed split is that, well, currently 0.3% of all volume that goes to the liquidity providers, right. Based on what they're providing liquidity for and their share of it. And then the proposal is that we should do zero point 25% for the liquidity providers, 0.5% for the token holders. Now that hasn't been switched on yet.
00:42:32.938 - 00:42:50.130, Speaker C: It's been kind of said that it's going to get switched on when they release v three of their protocol. But yeah, I mean, Uni is a funny token here. I think you can see there it's not trading at anywhere near as large of a premium as the other things are, because UnisoP actually does generate a lot of revenue.
00:42:50.710 - 00:43:15.558, Speaker A: Yeah. So 7.2 billion market cap, and 604,000,000 annualized revenue generated by Uniswap. It is an absolute cash cow. Now, to your point, Anthony, whether uni token holders actually get a portion of that yet hasn't been decided. But if that is turned on, then a large portion of this cash starts to flow to uni holders, which is pretty incredible.
00:43:15.734 - 00:43:21.766, Speaker B: It's also worth talking about that not every token has the same value capture mechanisms.
00:43:21.798 - 00:43:21.946, Speaker C: Right?
00:43:21.968 - 00:44:08.554, Speaker B: So what Anthony was talking about with that 0.3% fee collected by the Uniswap protocol right now, all of that is going to liquidity providers. So token holders actually get 0% of that fee, and token holders will never get 100% of that fee because it needs to incentivize deposits. And so when we talk about these tokens, snx ave uni, it's important to know that each one captures value differently. And we are just beginning to figure out how to analyze these things and understand that maybe synthetics has a value capture mechanism that is stronger or weaker than Uniswap, and therefore the fees, even maybe one protocol, has two to ten x. The fees of another protocol, maybe a different protocol, can capture the fees two.
00:44:08.592 - 00:44:09.322, Speaker C: To ten x better.
00:44:09.376 - 00:44:44.520, Speaker B: So these are all really important conversations to have. Anthony, how do you think about both the ability of the team, the Uniswap team, to innovate? I'm pretty bullish on the Uniswap team because they, like synthetics, are really exploring the fold of l two capabilities layer. Two capabilities, really leveraging the power of cryptography, which makes me really excited about Uniswap. And then there's also the conversation about Coinbase as well. Maybe you can talk about how you speculate into the future version of Uniswap and how you incorporate some of these things into your model about.
00:44:45.450 - 00:45:27.846, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. I mean, Uniswap is a community darling, right, within Ethereum, it is the quintessential Defi project that everyone talks about, that everyone loves. Everyone loves to, you know, pretty much everyone in Ethereum and in Defi will have used Uniswap at least once. So that in and of itself, is a very bullish case for Uniswap. But then when you dig deeper into, as you were just saying, how is the token going to capture value right outside of the governance? It's going to get a small portion of the fees. Okay, so are those fees going to keep getting larger and larger? I believe they will. But are they going to get to a point where Uni's market cap can go to the hundreds of billions of dollars, right.
00:45:27.846 - 00:45:53.930, Speaker C: Because its volume that it's generating is actually rivaling its centralized counterparts. And you look at Coinbase, they're going to IPO this year. It said that they're going to reach 100 billion dollar plus market cap on that. Now, Coinbase obviously makes revenue from other areas as well, not just exchange fees. They have a custody business, have OTC stuff that they do. They have a bunch of other things that they do. But most of their revenue, I believe, still comes from exchange fees.
00:45:53.930 - 00:46:18.306, Speaker C: So if we take that as an example, you could say that uni deserves to trade at the same valuation. Right? At a surface level narrative. And that's the narrative that gets perpetuated throughout crypto, Twitter and all that sort of stuff, because it's a very easy narrative to cling on to. But then you have to dig into the intricacies. Are Coinbase equity holders going to get dividends? Right? I don't know. I haven't read the prospectus. I don't know if they're going to give dividends out.
00:46:18.306 - 00:46:56.850, Speaker C: What's the share? Right. What's the price to sales ratio? All that sort of stuff. And then it becomes, it's not a one to one comparable anymore. You need to kind of go into the depths of each of them and kind of work out there. And as I've said, these things are growth kind of assets. I think narrative powers more than the fundamentals for the time being in crypto and defi, because it's so new. And that very powerful narrative of uniswap doing more volume than coinbase on some days, and centralized exchanges in general, I think the asset will continue to appreciate just because of that, even though it doesn't do anything except governance at the moment.
00:46:56.850 - 00:47:29.194, Speaker C: And it's already worth $7 billion on a fully diluted basis just for governance rights. On token terminal, it shows the price to sales ratio is very low. But as you said, uni token holders don't have access to any of that. So really the price to sales ratio is infinite because don't have a claim to the fees yet. So in that respect, it is just valued based on a narrative and a story and a little bit of governance value. Yeah.
00:47:29.232 - 00:47:41.614, Speaker A: And at some level, so are some stocks. Know, Amazon for a long time had no profits. Right. Bezos just kicked that back into the business. I want to ask another question on uni while we're at it. It's kind of the bear case for uni. Right.
00:47:41.614 - 00:48:03.846, Speaker A: So we don't know how all of this will play out yet. There is a bear case that says, hey, liquidity is actually fickle. And because protocols like Uniswap can be forked so easily, we could just fork and create a Uniswap clone, like a sushi, maybe, and start vampire attacking Uniswap, absorb the liquidity from that project.
00:48:03.948 - 00:48:04.214, Speaker C: Right?
00:48:04.252 - 00:48:47.300, Speaker A: So what's interesting about that counter narrative or counter thesis is if you're buying something like the DPI, you don't even have to worry about it, because what will happen is a sushi will just be indexed by the DPI as its market cap grows and its governance kind of votes to include it in the index. You don't even have to worry about that sort of thing. But if you are buying uni, the token on its own, and not as part of an index that kind of rotates through the top defi assets, then you do have to worry about something like that. What do you make of that kind of bear case? That liquidity is fickle, that uniswap does not have a high moat or strong.
00:48:47.770 - 00:49:07.030, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, sushiswap has obviously done very well over the last few months. They have gotten a lot of liquidity. They are subsidizing. I just want to make note of that. They're subsidizing with the sushi token. So a lot of that liquidity is floating because of that. But people like to say that liquidity isn't loyal, and that's true to an extent.
00:49:07.030 - 00:49:48.914, Speaker C: But I do think there are a handful of, more than a handful, like a pretty decent amount of liquidity that is loyal. Because Uniswap had their liquidity mining incentives and for a little while, where they were giving out uni tokens for providing liquidity on four different pairs, that lasted I think six weeks or something like that, they got like, I think $2 billion, some crazy amount of liquidity. And that left as fast as it came. But there was still like over a billion dollars left in uniswap. And that's kept growing without the liquidity mining incentives. So to me, that's just sticky liquidity, loyal liquidity, that's there for different reasons. Uniswap can be considered a more secure protocol than sushiswap.
00:49:48.914 - 00:50:14.666, Speaker C: Right. People trust the Uniswap protocol more. There's more volume being generated on Uniswap. So the fees that you're generating as a liquidity provider are better than sushiswap. The brand awareness is better, right. The interface might be better, the way people interact with it, all that sort of stuff. So it's hard to know where this is all going to land because some people say, because liquidity is not loyal, it's just going to be fragmented across different pools.
00:50:14.666 - 00:50:55.098, Speaker C: Whoever's paying the most for it, blah, blah, blah. Then the aggregators are going to win. Something like a one inch, right, is going to win because that's just going to be the user facing interface. And then one inch is just going to plug into whatever has got the best price for the user, which I can see happening actually in the end state, not just one inch. I can actually see centralized exchanges doing this where they tap into the Defi liquidity pools and just act as an aggregator as well. We saw shapeshift recently announced that they're actually going to be using these DeFi protocols in that mean, and as you mentioned, because it's so hard to tell the future here, having something like the, you know, sushiswap will get added eventually to it once it meets the criteria.
00:50:55.194 - 00:51:03.006, Speaker A: Or even one inch would get, if the aggregator layer becomes kind of the fat layer here, the fat value, then one inch would be added to the.
00:51:03.188 - 00:51:50.878, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly, exactly. So these are just things you don't have to worry about. If you have the DPI, you just get broad kind of exposure to a bunch of different categories within DeFi as well, right? You get the AMM category, you get synthetic category, you get money markets. And then you can just rest easy knowing that that's just going to keep going up because a lot of these tokens are just going to keep going up and you don't have to pick and choose. So that's a very powerful thing. And that's why index products are so popular in the traditional system. No one wants to research 500 different companies in their S and P 500, right? They're happy cruising on what, 8% to 12% annualized on average with some of their capital and they know that it's safe, they know that they have exposure to the economy, they're not getting inflated away and their money is actually going to grow.
00:51:50.878 - 00:52:05.138, Speaker C: So that's the end state for DeFi investing, I think. Because there's no way an everyday investor can keep up with everything and there's no way even I can keep up with everything and all of us, right? Definitely.
00:52:05.224 - 00:52:08.450, Speaker A: So let's finish up uni with bullish. Bearish, neutral?
00:52:09.290 - 00:52:44.566, Speaker C: Yeah, I think neutral for uni, even though I think it's going to go up. I think the bullish case is there from a narrative point of view. But for me, it's kind of hard to kind of give a really bullish investment case in terms of future growth. I mean, I still think it's going to grow. I know it's weird to say this, but for me, I'd rather put my money into something else that maybe I feel more comfortable investing in and maybe it's got more upside potential as an active investor within this space. But I do own it as part of DPI that I own. So I mean I've already got exposure.
00:52:44.566 - 00:52:48.770, Speaker C: So yeah, definitely. I'd say neutral to bullish. Let's say that.
00:52:48.840 - 00:53:18.170, Speaker B: All right, so let's turn the conversation to MKR and maker, one of the oldest assets in the DeFi ecosystem, which also had an extremely explosive week. Listeners will know that MKR is the token behind Maker, which is the system behind the DAi stablecoin, which is really the only decentralized, trustless stablecoin with the level of liquidity that we would expect in the DeFi ecosystem. Anthony, how do you think about Maker and MKR?
00:53:18.830 - 00:54:06.906, Speaker C: MKR has been the most brutalized DeFi asset ever. I think it did not really move during DeFi summer, which people were like, why isn't it moving? Right, DFI is moving, why is this thing not going up? And the sentiment on MKR was very bad until one day it decided, I'm just going to pump really hard and go three x in like a week. So the thing about MKR is that I think the maker platform has kept growing very rapidly. It's still number one, right? DAi supply is at all time high. There is a lot of ETH in there, 3.5 million ETH in the maker platform backing the DAI, and there's a lot of USDC, WBTC, all this sort of stuff. So you can see here $4.2
00:54:06.906 - 00:54:10.186, Speaker C: billion worth of collateral in maker, and then.
00:54:10.208 - 00:54:13.310, Speaker B: There'S also 1.4 billion die out there.
00:54:13.460 - 00:54:45.314, Speaker C: Exactly. And that's kept growing all throughout the time that MKR has just stayed flat. Right, flat against USD and kind of falling very rapidly against ETH. So because of that, the sentiment was really bad, right? You saw it on crypto Twitter, if you're on there, people were ragging on it saying it doesn't have a good value capture mechanism, blah, blah, blah. But then obviously it woke up this week and now people are suddenly bullish on it. I don't know, that's how the markets work. But the way MKR generates fundamental value is in basically two ways, right? It's a governance token.
00:54:45.314 - 00:55:41.970, Speaker C: First and foremost, it governs the maker platform, and then on top of that, all the positions on maker accrue stability fees. So basically this is the revenue that the maker platform generates, and those stability fees are basically used to buy and burn the MKR token. So the real bullcase for MKR is that there's so much fees being generated by the platform that there's always buy pressure for the MKR token, so that eventually it's so scarce that naturally the price just appreciates because there's always demand there. Now there's arguments two and four, kind of for and against. Sorry, this value accrual mechanism, people say burning isn't the best use of kind of mechanism for a token to accrue value. You should do staking and let people accrue fees themselves directly accrue fees and die or something like that. And I get that model.
00:55:41.970 - 00:56:21.314, Speaker C: I do get the burn model as well. I know, David, you've written a lot about this in the past as some of your earlier writings, which like really resonated with, and that thesis didn't really play out till recently. And now people are, well, you know, make is growing, it grew a lot, right? It's at all time highs across all its metrics. Well, maybe MMKR should be worth something. So I actually think MKR is a special case in where its fundamental value was growing and its token price should have gone up, but the sentiment was so bad on it that it actually trumped all that. Its narrative, its story was not good enough because crypto runs on these narratives. So now that it's gone up again, the story kind of flips.
00:56:21.314 - 00:56:50.414, Speaker C: People start asking questions, they're like, oh, wow, how did I see this coming? Hindsight 2020 and all that. So that's why MKAL has been a very difficult token to invest in previously, and it still is difficult to invest in. It's whether you buy that, it's going to keep going up still. And it wasn't just like a once off thing, but personally, I can see it keep going up because the maker system is not going anywhere, DAI is not going anywhere. There's obviously demand for it. I mean, I use maker and all that sort of stuff. A lot of people I know use it.
00:56:50.414 - 00:56:52.286, Speaker C: So yeah, that's like, I guess the.
00:56:52.308 - 00:58:00.786, Speaker B: TLDR on Maker 1.4 billion die is nothing to ignore. Maker is a really interesting protocol because it's got this dual token model, so users can think of die as the product of the maker protocol and the MKR token as like the pseudo equity, the capital asset, the one that collects fees, and then it deflates in supply, right? And so that 1.4 billion die out there is accruing fees somewhere depending on the collateral inside of maker, Dow, whether it's ether, USDC, whoever minted that DAI is paying fees in the same way that if you are borrowing from compound or you're borrowing from AAVE, you are also paying fees. The difference with maker versus AavE or compound is that the interest rates that you pay on AAVE or compound fluctuate according to the market rate maker. Those interest rates, or what we call the stability fees, change as a result of the governance of MKR holders. And the MKR holders will make a very human led decision rather than a robot led decision like Ave or compound, a human led decision to increase or lower the stability fees to help adjust.
00:58:00.818 - 00:58:01.810, Speaker C: The price of DAI.
00:58:01.890 - 00:58:37.042, Speaker B: Not unlike how our central bank will issue more currency to keep the price of the dollar down or raise interest rates to keep the price of the dollar up. Very similar mechanism. Yet when the fees are collected by the protocol, those fees go into burning the MKR token. And so when we see the supply of DAI just marching upwards basically nonstop since the genesis of the protocol into $1.4 billion worth of DAI, that's $1.4 billion that the Maker Dow protocol is able to collect fees on. Right now, the average fee, I think, is roughly 2%.
00:58:37.042 - 00:58:49.394, Speaker B: It's been as high as 19 and a half percent in previous times. So if you're bullish on MKR, you're bullish on more die supply as well as increasing stability fee interest rates.
00:58:49.442 - 00:58:49.654, Speaker C: Right?
00:58:49.692 - 00:58:52.760, Speaker B: So more fees paid per die over time.
00:58:53.210 - 00:59:05.142, Speaker A: So all this, David, you sound maybe that you're a bit bullish on MKR right now. I'm not sure, but let's ask the question. So, bullish, bearish, neutral guys on MKR.
00:59:05.286 - 00:59:07.820, Speaker B: Anthony, you want to go first? Yeah.
00:59:08.590 - 00:59:39.546, Speaker C: Again, I think neutral here because, as I said, it's been very hard to trade MKR and invest in it, because if you invest in it over the last two years, you had been kind of sideways and underwater against ETH up until recently. And still, depending on where you bought it, I mean, it hasn't recovered that much against ETH. I think it peaked at like five Eth per mkr. It's at like 1.3. Last time I checked, it was down at like 0.7 at one point. So if you had bought a long time ago, you're probably still not up against ETH.
00:59:39.546 - 00:59:53.606, Speaker C: So I think the sentiment is still not great on it. I can understand the fundamental value, and I think Dai is going to do a lot of things so neutral in that. I don't think I'll be buying it, but I do think that it can go up given the right conditions.
00:59:53.798 - 01:00:19.234, Speaker B: So, yeah, I think the fundamentals behind maker are absolutely astounding. I do agree with Anthony. I think it's kind of a tortoise V. Hare kind of scenario where Maker is the tortoise. It's going to be slow, it's going to be boring. DeFi tokens are going to pop off like rockets. People are going to feel fomo, and I don't think people are going to feel fomo about MKR just because of how old and mature the asset is.
01:00:19.234 - 01:01:24.898, Speaker B: I think it's going to be a slower mover, but the fundamentals there are so strong, are so strong, and some people are going to tap into that. So net time MKR was like my first love as a token outside of ether, so I'm happy to see it come back into the fold of conversation. I'm long term bullish Ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on Ethereum and just recently released Ave version two, which has a ton of cool new features that makes using Ave even more powerful. With Ave you can leverage the full power of DFI money, legos, yield and composability all in one application. On Ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield, and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol. If you have deposited collateral here, you can see me getting a 200 USDC loan against my portfolio of a number of different DFI tokens and ETH. I'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option, but I could choose the stable interest rate option if I wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently.
01:01:24.898 - 01:01:46.602, Speaker B: One of Ave's V two features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets, trade them on uniswap, and then deposit them back into Ave. Ave does all of this for you, all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them. Check out the power of aave@ave.com that's aave.com.
01:01:46.656 - 01:02:02.690, Speaker A: Alright, let's go to the next so you mentioned if MKR is the tortoise, then wire and Wi Fi has got to be the hair. It's had an absolutely crazy year. Anthony, your thoughts on the urine protocol and Wi Fi?
01:02:03.350 - 01:02:07.330, Speaker C: Yeah, Wi Fi is the craziest token to ever launch, I think.
01:02:07.400 - 01:02:07.730, Speaker A: Yet.
01:02:07.800 - 01:02:38.960, Speaker C: Maybe there's crazier think, you know, for those who were around when the token went live, you will know what I mean. But first I'll explain what the protocol is. So what yearn is, and I guess what it has been up until this point, is a yield farming aggregator. So it basically lets you pull capital with a bunch of other people into what's called a vault. And this vault will chase the best yield farming opportunities for you. It will let you save on gas because it will do the trading for you. Automated all that good stuff.
01:02:38.960 - 01:03:24.846, Speaker C: So that was very popular during defi summer of course, right? Because the yields were very high because there was all these farms popping up and tokens were going up and the apys were through the roof. But it's less popular when there's not like a defi bull market, which there isn't really one at the moment. Right. It's still very much, I think, sideways movement with some going up here and there, but it's nothing like we saw in DeFi Summer. Then with yearn, also launched the Wifi token, which was the first, quote unquote fair launched token in kind of DFI, where Andre, the founder, put out the token. He said there's only going to be 30,000. You can yield farm for two weeks or around two weeks.
01:03:24.846 - 01:04:05.482, Speaker C: There's no pre mined, there's no vc allocation. Everyone gets a fair shot at farming it by putting capital into these contracts, and that's how it was distributed. And because of that, it had an extremely strong narrative and meme for DFI summer. It went nuts, right? It started at $0, essentially because there wasn't any initial sale, went up to, I think, $45,000 all time high. It went on Coinbase really quickly. All these kinds of things happened, and the yearn protocol was growing rapidly because of the fact that yield farming was taking off. So you had this incredibly powerful narrative, and the token went up extremely fast, within a month or two.
01:04:05.482 - 01:04:22.480, Speaker C: Now, of course, you had the comedown right. After that, Wifi fell harder than most DFI tokens. It went from 45,000 to 7000 in a month. Everyone thought it was dead. Game over, things have finished. Then it went back up, and now it's hovering around 30,000. Right? Nothing's ever dead here.
01:04:22.480 - 01:05:03.486, Speaker C: A lot of the things that are actually dead are still not dead in terms of coins. But anyway, they kept building, and they've kept building up until this point. They have a lot of stuff going out, they have a lot of products in the pipeline. But unfortunately, the token kind of feels like a second rate citizen in the protocol at this point. I think at the moment the community is struggling with how this token is going to accrue value going forward. It originally started as a governance token, and you could put your tokens into the governance contract and accrue fees from the protocol. And that was actually paying a lot during DeFi summer, of course, but now it doesn't pay much.
01:05:03.486 - 01:05:46.410, Speaker C: And they've proposed to turn that kind of governance off and do a new model, which is going to be called a buyback, and make where they buy back wifi from the market, they being the developers, and use that to pay salaries and things. Like that and there's no fee capture, but there is governance. So it's kind of like this limbo state now, this token where I think it's worth as much as it's worth still because of its powerful narrative. I think the products are still sound and I think they've got good products coming out in the future. But yeah, this token is probably the hardest to value in Defi right now just because it could change. Right. It could be something else next month.
01:05:46.410 - 01:05:50.666, Speaker C: We don't know. So it's very hard to project what's going to happen here.
01:05:50.768 - 01:06:10.900, Speaker B: Yeah, young assets are very hard to value because it's so easy for something to change. Anthony, what would you say to the critique that YFI was just a flash in the pan, just like it's a one time, once and done kind of move. It had its big claim to fame and now it's kind of just drifting off into the ether. What would you say to somebody like that?
01:06:11.910 - 01:06:54.594, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I can kind of sympathize with that argument to some extent where, as I said, the token seems to be in limbo right now. The community and the developers don't really seem to know where they want the token to go, like what they want it to do. So, I mean, there is critique there to be made, but that's like assuming that they're not going to figure this out, right? So the more positive case is that they figure it out. They figure out good value accrual mechanisms for this token. They keep building good products that generate revenue and all this sort of stuff, and everyone's happy. But that is just like a very big risk, right? Buying the token right now, I think you'd be buying it more for the narrative, the meme, the story. Right.
01:06:54.594 - 01:07:01.300, Speaker C: The Andre narrative too. He played a huge part in it. His whole Persona played a huge part in it.
01:07:02.150 - 01:07:09.810, Speaker A: It's a massive ecosystem and a massive community. But why did they turn off the value accrual fee.
01:07:11.750 - 01:07:54.770, Speaker C: Mean in the proposal? They said that it's going to be temporary. The justification was given that it wasn't generating much value anymore. I think it was generating maybe 1.5% a year or something like that in terms of APY for Wifi stakers. So they would rather basically use the fees generated by the yearn vaults or the urine platform to buy Wifi from the market and then use that to fund developers developing the core developers, essentially. Now, obviously, you know, you might think, well, I mean, that's not really a value accrual mechanism because that Wi Fi is inevitably going to be paid out and sold right on the open market. Because if you're paying developers with these tokens, they might cash it out.
01:07:54.770 - 01:08:16.554, Speaker C: So eventually it finds its way back to the market anyway. It's not like a make a buyback and burn. Right? Right. It's a buyback and spend, essentially. So people are like, okay, well then how is that bullish for the token? Right? How does that generate value? But then other people say, well, the more developers we fund, the more we pay them, the better products they're going to build. And I agree with that. Right.
01:08:16.554 - 01:08:39.438, Speaker C: You obviously need to pay know people need to make money and then know as the product matures more, it kind of can accrue. I mean, to use David's kind of metaphor here, it's like urine started as like a hair and now it's gone and become a tortoise. Right. And it's planning to play the long game now rather than that short term game it played because that wasn't sustainable.
01:08:39.614 - 01:08:43.470, Speaker A: So what does that make you? Bullish, bearish, neutral on Wifi.
01:08:43.630 - 01:09:10.358, Speaker C: I still hold wifi. I'm definitely still bullish on it. But I wouldn't say I'm bullish on it for fundamental kind of fee revenue reasons or value capture reasons. I'm bullish on it because the story is very powerful. The builders are great. They have a great ecosystem that they're developing with the. They call it the ycosystem, where they've got a bunch of projects that they've partnered with, like Sushiswap cream, cover all these different projects.
01:09:10.358 - 01:09:21.600, Speaker C: So I'm bullish on that because that's like a first for DeFi. But yeah, I wouldn't say I'm holding it expecting to generate dividends, if you want to call it that anytime soon.
01:09:22.690 - 01:09:28.850, Speaker B: All right, shall we move on to compound? Compound is a very interesting protocol. Anthony, tell us your thoughts about compound.
01:09:29.350 - 01:09:45.654, Speaker C: Yeah, so compound is a money market protocol similar to Ave in that you can lend and borrow assets on there. It's number three, as you can see on d five. Pulse here. $2.7 billion lock or $2.8 billion in there right now. Compound is great.
01:09:45.654 - 01:10:03.166, Speaker C: They've been around for a while. They've been around longer than Ave. I think they are definitely the tortoise. If Ave is the hair, and I wouldn't even say that Ave is the hair, it doesn't move that quickly. But the main difference is that compound moves slower with adding assets, changing system parameters. It plays it safer. Right.
01:10:03.166 - 01:10:52.390, Speaker C: Whereas Ave will play a little bit more fast and loose, where they'll list additional assets that may be considered riskier than what compound will do. But compound is probably safer than ave for that reason. I don't know on a fundamental level or a smart contract level, but maybe more people trust compound because of that. Maybe the rates are better, more efficient on there because of that, too. It's worth noting that compound currently still has liquidity mining, I think, where you can earn the comp token for lending and borrowing on there. And it's also worth noting that compound is what kicked off DFI summer, because in June of 2020, they launched their liquidity mining program, which turned into what's known as yield farming. They were kind of the thing that the protocol that popularized it, and that was just the very beginning.
01:10:52.390 - 01:11:34.570, Speaker C: And the comp token launched, and obviously it went up a lot from all the hype initially, and then it came down and it's gone back up during this kind of like bull market we've seen recently. So the comp token itself is governance, of course. I mean, most of these things are governance tokens. I don't know if they have fee capture on yet for the comp token. I don't believe they do last time I checked. So, yeah, same situation as uni. I think you could say that compound is like uniswap in terms of that kind of like moving slower, playing it safer, not taking all these risks, whereas sushiswap moves a lot faster and takes more risk.
01:11:34.570 - 01:11:58.854, Speaker C: And then I think Ave does as well. But I actually think sushi swap. Sorry, I actually think like something like cream, which we're not going to talk about, I don't think, because it's not part of the Defi pulse index, but they move even faster. So, yeah, I mean, compound is going to be around for a while. It's here to stay. It's not going anywhere. But the main difference, because people might say, okay, well, we have Ave, we have compound, we have cream, we have all these money markets.
01:11:58.854 - 01:12:33.886, Speaker C: What are the main differences? It really is that kind of like how fast they move to add new assets is a big part of that, because that plays into the governance culture of how fast they want to do things and how much risk they want to take and how much risk they want to introduce to the so. And that's the same with maker as an example here, MKR governance moves very slowly. Right. That's been a critique, but as you said, david, some are playing the tortoise game, some are playing the hair game, and I think compound is definitely playing the tortoise game, but long term, I think it's a winning model for sure.
01:12:33.988 - 01:13:25.790, Speaker A: It's funny that that's a critique, too, because it definitely does add to the robustness of the DeFi ecosystem. That you have some protocols that are very conservative and slower and playing kind of the tortoise game and others that just move fast, maybe move fast and break things at the far end of the spectrum. But when you look across all of this, you get the speed advantage, and then you also get kind of the conservative, low risk advantage. And all of these projects together just make defi a whole lot stronger because we have different options. I'm glad there isn't only just a compound, but there's also Aave and cream, and that there's not only just a uniswap, but there's also a sushi. It makes for a much stronger ecosystem.
01:13:26.210 - 01:14:28.850, Speaker B: I would definitely categorize compound and uniswap in similar categories because both of those teams are really pushing the limits of crypto economics. Right. Both of them are experimenting with l two s. Both of them are doing brand new things that no other protocols are doing. And I think that's kind of where the theorized upside behind something like compound or Uniswap comes from, is they integrate with something like optimistic roll ups or some sort of l two. Compound is experimenting with its own application chain, and that is something that we are not seeing out of ave or cream and we're not seeing out of sushi swap, where Ave and sushi swap are more focused on native DFI money, Lego integrations, and really pushing the fold with how integrations with other protocols can work. Whereas Uniswap and compound are kind of just working on themselves and working on how can we maximize the value capture using l two and using some of these very early nascent crypto economic primitives that I don't think anyone else is really equipped to work with.
01:14:28.850 - 01:14:39.842, Speaker B: So, like Ryan said, really happy to see similar protocols go in two different directions because there's so much left in untapped potential in defi. Somebody needs to go in all directions.
01:14:39.986 - 01:14:44.920, Speaker A: All right, so let's ask the question. Anthony bullish. Bearish. Neutral on comp.
01:14:45.770 - 01:15:03.520, Speaker C: Neutral on comp, I guess. Yeah, neutral on comp. Neutral. Bullish. Maybe I haven't kept up too much with all of the work that they're doing. I know high level what they're doing, and I kind of was bearish and still am bearish on their application chain that they want to build. I don't really see the point of it.
01:15:03.520 - 01:15:34.514, Speaker C: Until recently, actually, we saw that the OCC in the US said that federally chartered banks could use blockchains as settlement layers, public blockchains as settlement layers. So maybe the comp chain kind of fits into that. And the banks are more comfortable using something like a comp chain rather than ethereum. Maybe there's a case there. But, yeah, I'm definitely neutral. I still think they're going to grow. I just think that kind of comp chain thing gave me pause.
01:15:34.514 - 01:15:38.360, Speaker C: But other than that, yeah, definitely still think it's great.
01:15:40.010 - 01:15:51.740, Speaker B: All right, let's get into loopering. Loopering, I feel like is the most unique asset so far in the sense that it just pertains to an l two network. Anthony, can you go ahead and get into loop ring for us?
01:15:52.270 - 01:16:16.500, Speaker C: Yeah. Loop ring has been leading the l two charge for a little while now. So they have two different exchanges on layer two. They have an amm exchange or something like a uniswap, like exchange on layer two. And they also have an order book based exchange. So something like a traditional, kind of centralized exchange order book model. And they've seen some incredible growth recently on their layer two.
01:16:16.500 - 01:16:44.486, Speaker C: They have over $100 million locked in there. Now they're doing liquidity mining on there to get people to migrate across. And they're really leading the charge here. They're using zero knowledge roll ups or ZK roll ups, which is a different technology to what some of the others, like synthetics and Unisop, are going to use. They're going to use optimistic roll ups from optimism. And Loop ring have built their own ZK roll ups as well. I don't think they're actually using any other companies, so that's even more impressive.
01:16:44.486 - 01:16:47.966, Speaker C: But yeah, they've seen some incredible growth you can see on the chart there. Yeah.
01:16:47.988 - 01:16:56.354, Speaker A: Anthony, what happened here? So what happened on January 1? Because we see total locked value just shoot right up massively. And also token price.
01:16:56.552 - 01:17:34.206, Speaker C: Yeah, token price would play into that a little bit because they have LRC on their exchange that you can use. But also they did a liquidity mining program which had people put their tokens on l two and to earn their LRC rewards on there. So I think that's needed. Liquidity mining programs are really great for incentivizing that early liquidity, and we need that for layer two. So I think loop ring deeply understands this and that's why they've done it. And they haven't done it in a super speculative way where you're earning like 1000 APY or whatever, or none of that. They've done it in a proper sustainable way, which I'm really impressed by.
01:17:34.206 - 01:17:58.758, Speaker C: And yeah, they've just made the great layer to exchange and one of the first that actually has traction because uniswap is coming with it, but we don't know when. I'm sure sushiswap is looking into this. I'm sure other projects like Zero X maybe are looking into it and stuff like that. But yeah, I think that they've just had lots of success being first movers here and being innovators. So I applaud them on that.
01:17:58.844 - 01:18:04.120, Speaker B: So what's the value capture mechanism for the LRC token? And this is something I'm not familiar with.
01:18:04.970 - 01:18:35.242, Speaker C: I wouldn't say I'm an expert on the LRC token itself. I'm going to assume that it will have governance rights and that it will have a fee capture on both layer one and layer two if they have a layer one exchange as well. But yeah, I think the token itself is probably in kind of like early stages where they probably haven't figured out the value capture mechanisms yet or implemented it at least, because I imagine that they're very focused on growing the liquidity on their layer two exchange first before worrying about the token.
01:18:35.386 - 01:19:02.940, Speaker A: This is something else that's really nice about buying an index because loop ring is just the first. I mean, I know we've all talked about before, and you've written about this, Anthony, that there's going to be kind of a layer two war for liquidity and for users. Right? And this is the only layer two token in here. It probably won't be the last. So with an index, you don't have to pick the winners. They float up inside the index, which is kind of nice.
01:19:03.630 - 01:19:34.914, Speaker C: Exactly. And I think LRC, the token wasn't one that was talked about as part of the mainstream consciousness of Defi tokens, but it went up a lot because people were sleeping on it. Right. So as you said, with the Defi pulse index, you don't have to even pay attention to any of this. It's already in there. You already caught that upside, which is just, I mean, it's great because there's nothing worse than going on coingecko and looking at something that went up a lot and being like, wow, why didn't I buy that? Right? And then, yeah, that's why the index products are really beautiful, I think, for sure.
01:19:35.112 - 01:19:44.710, Speaker B: All right, so let's move to Ren. Ren is, I think, the most unique asset in this category because it's a cross chain token. Anthony, what can you tell us about Ren?
01:19:45.290 - 01:20:14.250, Speaker C: Yeah, so Ren, I guess it used to be called Republic protocol. It's quite an old asset. I think they launched in either 2017 or 2018, their asset. But basically what their platform does, it's a cross chain kind of bridge. They have Ren BTC, which is like tokenized bitcoin on Ethereum. They claim it to be fully decentralized. I think that claim was actually debunked recently where there was centralization vectors.
01:20:14.250 - 01:20:48.454, Speaker C: But basically they have like a network of nodes that they call dark nodes. I think that let you do these kind of cross chain transactions in terms of the token itself. I think on the dark nodes you have to stake these tokens. I'm pretty sure that the token also gives you kind of fee capture because to use the bridge, it generates fees. And obviously that goes to the node runners and things like that. And I believe it's probably a governance token as well. I mean, I'm just assuming that all of these things have some sort of governance built in, because if you want your protocol to be more decentralized, you don't want to be the admin key holder.
01:20:48.454 - 01:21:21.282, Speaker C: You need to offer incentives to do governance. But yeah, they've seen some really great growth because of Ren BTC over the past few months. We have so much tokenized BTC on Ethereum now, the largest obviously being wrapped bitcoin, which is centralized. Ren BTC aims to be a decentralized version, but they're also competing against something like TBTC. But Ren, I guess, goes beyond just BTC. They're trying to tokenize a bunch of assets from kind of different protocols. But it also speaks to what's the demand for this bridging.
01:21:21.282 - 01:21:42.174, Speaker C: Right. There's also rune as well thoughtchain, which is a very popular thing, especially on crypto Twitter, that is competing in that area. So yeah, the growth has been great, but it's kind of like hard to value this thing when there's so much competition and we're so early in the cross chain kind of thing right now.
01:21:42.292 - 01:22:31.754, Speaker B: Yeah, the investment thesis behind Ren really depends on there being like a polychain ecosystem that really has many assets that for some reason need to be transferred between blockchains. Right now, the only multi chain ecosystem I can really see is between bitcoin and ethereum. So I think the long term case for Ren would really need to know many, many chains with many, many valuable assets. So you would need to believe in that. It's also worth noting that while Ren is a token that provides crypto economic assurances to transfer tokens between chains, the team has a backdoor in the same way that the compound team had a backdoor to compound before they plugged it up with a comp token. The ren team currently has a backdoor, so it is not trustless. The goal is to make it more trustless with the Ren token, but that is not there yet.
01:22:31.754 - 01:22:42.480, Speaker B: So that is something that is worth noting, especially when we come and start talking about how to evaluate tokens. Whether or not the team has a backdoor is definitely something that people should include in their research.
01:22:43.410 - 01:22:46.000, Speaker A: Bullish, bearish, neutral guys on red.
01:22:46.610 - 01:22:48.030, Speaker B: I'm going to go neutral.
01:22:48.550 - 01:23:19.622, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm going to go with neutral because I don't know enough to be bullish or bearish about it. Yeah. But just to David's point quickly, I think a lot of the stuff we've spoken about today, I think not just those, but like a lot of other DeFi protocols have these admin keys or backdoors and stuff like that because they're young. Right. A lot of the Defi pulse index don't, like, maker doesn't because they have their on chain governance. Right. But synthetic still does, even though synthetic is the largest kind of token in that index.
01:23:19.622 - 01:23:36.690, Speaker C: Right. If that's something that concerns you, if you think that for some reason the team's going to do something that's going to jeopardize the protocol with their admin key, then that's something to keep in mind. I wouldn't say it's like a major risk for the top DeFi protocols, but it is a risk.
01:23:37.270 - 01:23:47.430, Speaker B: All right, let's turn to Kyber network. Kyber, another very old asset in the DeFi ecosystem. Anthony, what can you tell us about Kyber and the KNC token?
01:23:48.170 - 01:24:15.786, Speaker C: Yeah, so Kyber was very popular last year. I think there was like a very strong narrative around it, but I haven't heard much about it lately. But basically from memory, and maybe I'm misremembering here, I haven't looked at it in a little while, but from memory, they do a buy and burn model as well, where KNC is burnt. They also have a staking model where you can stake KNC and earn fees that are generated by their exchange in ETH. So it's actually paid out in ETH, not in KNC.
01:24:15.898 - 01:24:18.698, Speaker B: One of the few tokens that pays out ETH dividends.
01:24:18.874 - 01:24:37.586, Speaker C: Yeah. So I thought that was very think. And just for kind of context here, Kyber network is basically an exchange aggregator. They have liquidity pools that they pull from and they give you the price. And that space is obviously pretty crowded. Now. You have one inch, you have Dex AG, you have paraswap.
01:24:37.586 - 01:25:29.758, Speaker C: There's a bunch of know, and I saw a post recently from Kyber's CEO. I think they're trying to, I guess, reevaluate what their protocol is and where it sits within Defi from a strategic point of view, because, yeah, over the last few months, they've kind of like sat wouldn't, I wouldn't say they're getting out competed, but the other things have grown more than them, the other aggregators and stuff like that. So investing in KNC right now is probably pretty risky because you're betting that the team will figure out where to go next. You're basically betting on the team. You're not betting on the protocol anymore or the growth of it. You're betting on the team being able to plug whatever kind of hole has been pushing KNC down more than maybe it should be. But yeah, I think that's kind of the gist of it.
01:25:29.758 - 01:25:55.646, Speaker C: I hope to see them kind of like come back from, I guess maybe the little hole that they're in right now because they're a great team. They've been kicking away since 2017 as well. They're one of the first D five protocols. But such is life with being the first is that you build during the bear market. You do all the hard work and then someone comes and forks you and does it better because they have all the stuff to work from. So this is the risk of building in d five for these teams. I think.
01:25:55.748 - 01:26:42.394, Speaker B: I think one of the bullcases for Kyber, for KNC is that with Uniswap, providing liquidity to uniswap is very capital intensive, and providing capital to Kyber is less intensive. You can get more liquidity from less total capital when you provide it to Kyber. And so if Kyber can collect comparable amount of fees, you can keep that capital allocation low while still collecting a decent healthy amount of fees. That's my understanding. For the bullcase, for the KNC token, it does have a competitive advantages and disadvantages to other things. And so just that uniqueness, I think, gives it a lot of sticking power. But it really takes a little bit more of deep diving into research and value accrual to really be able to place this token in relation to other market making tokens.
01:26:42.522 - 01:26:43.434, Speaker A: Bullish. Bearish.
01:26:43.482 - 01:26:48.138, Speaker B: Neutral, neutral, neutral, neutral.
01:26:48.234 - 01:26:50.830, Speaker A: All right, well, we made it to the last one.
01:26:50.980 - 01:26:58.930, Speaker B: Balancer balancer. I really like balancer as a project. Let's get Anthony's opinion on balancer and the bal token.
01:26:59.430 - 01:27:13.542, Speaker C: Yes. So I mean I'm the same as you. I really like balancer as a project. I think they are doing innovative stuff. But the major issue with balancer, I think. And the reason why they maybe haven't seen more. I don't know what their volume is right now.
01:27:13.542 - 01:27:45.662, Speaker C: I think their volume isn't like as high as you would want it to be for the amount of liquidity that they have in there. Because they're actually subsidizing a lot of that liquidity. With liquidity mining rewards paid out in the BaL token. But their problem is that their interface is shocking, right? The balancer exchange interface is not friendly to noobs the last time I checked it. I don't even know if they've updated it at this point. It's just very difficult for noobs to navigate. It's very difficult for even, not even just noobs, people in general, even in defi to navigate.
01:27:45.662 - 01:28:19.046, Speaker C: So I think that's let them down a little bit. They're obviously competing in the Amm space with Uniswap and sushiswap and all the other ones. Balancer lets you do some things like adjustable fees lets you have up to eight tokens in a actually. And this is what I originally thought about balancer. I kind of thought that the adjustable fees thing was actually something that shouldn't have been implemented. Because the only reason people provide liquidity without the incentives is to generate fees. Or at least that's one of the major reasons.
01:28:19.046 - 01:29:00.410, Speaker C: Now if you have a protocol where you can adjust fees and there's all this stuff happens, and then anyone can spin up these pools with different fees, you fragment the liquidity, right? And with Uniswap it's just a flat fee, it's 0.3%. So everyone is just paying the same, no matter if you spin up the same pool or whatever. Whereas on balancer you can do different weightings and different fees. And it complicates things, I think, to the point where it's just too complex for most people to grasp the volume. Because it's going a lot through aggregators. I think aggregators usually choose other exchanges like Uniswap and sushi swap and things before they choose balancer. Because it's just better.
01:29:00.410 - 01:29:26.254, Speaker C: The prices are just better. Because the weightings aren't always 50 50, they're not custom. The fees are always flat, right at 0.3% so that's why I think Balancer hasn't seen more success here. But I think that the fact that they've got the up to eight tokens in the pools and stuff like that, and the adjustable rates and fees is innovative. I just don't know if there's product market fit for that. I don't know if that's going to be a long term successful model.
01:29:26.254 - 01:29:49.890, Speaker C: And it's also something that Uniswap can just put in if it wanted to. Right? It's not like they could literally just change a few lines of code probably, and do that. I don't know, maybe not. But it's not something that they can look at and be like, oh, we can't do that because balancer did it. I just explained to you that it's all open source, so anyone can do this. Yeah, maybe you have a more bullish case than I do. I wouldn't say I'm bearish.
01:29:49.890 - 01:29:55.430, Speaker C: I just think that we need to see some more action happening on the balancer side of things.
01:29:55.580 - 01:30:26.146, Speaker B: Yeah, I do think that balancer might be the thing that captures the long tail of amm value. Things like currencies, like the ETH, USDC, WBTC, USDC. I think those are much more appropriate to Uniswap. However, there are things that balancer can do that no other protocol can do. And what balancer really is, is a much, much more flexible uniswap. And there's a lot of value in that as well. The t shirts that Ryan and I sold through bankless, we would not have been able to do that through Uniswap.
01:30:26.146 - 01:30:50.262, Speaker B: We needed that flexibility. That balancer offers that differential weighting where Uniswap locks you into 50 50. But balancer can make a pool that's 90, 1080, 20, or adjustable. So it can start 90 ten and then finish 1090. Then you can adjust fees based off of some sort of logic. So not only can you change the fees, but you can also change how you change the fees.
01:30:50.326 - 01:30:50.554, Speaker C: Right?
01:30:50.592 - 01:31:35.158, Speaker B: So everything gets really modular and flexible. And I think maybe one of the reasons why Balancer is kind of lagged behind in growth is that they are trying to go in all directions all at the same time. There's so much left to do before balancer can really consider itself done. And I don't think we know what the version of Balancer is going to be when it's finished doing all of the things that it needs to build itself out on. One of the things that really gets me excited about something like balancer is that the adjustable fees can reflect the changing market environment. And a great way to view this is like surge pricing with your Uber, right? If there is high demand for your Uber, Uber will charge you more. And balancer can do the same thing with volume on some of the balancer pools.
01:31:35.158 - 01:31:51.166, Speaker B: So if there's more volume going through a balancer pool, balancer can increase the fees for that pool in that specific moment to adjust to market demands. That flexibility is really powerful. I just don't think people have learned how to leverage some of these powers that balancer is giving to the world.
01:31:51.268 - 01:32:11.814, Speaker A: I almost think it's a little bit like the Apple versus Android, where it's like uniswap is like. It provides the easy button. Apple just. There's not a lot of options. You know exactly what to, you know, Android, there's infinite customizability on top of this thing. And Balancer has all of those properties. But the trade off there is.
01:32:11.814 - 01:32:16.040, Speaker A: It's a bit more complicated to use and to grok and to understand.
01:32:16.890 - 01:32:35.406, Speaker C: Yeah, that's kind of. I guess what I was alluding to is that modularity might actually be the thing that prevents balancer's growth. Because I think liquidity providing, because it's on uniswap and stuff, because it's so simple. Right. You know, that it's 50 50.3% fee. That's it.
01:32:35.406 - 01:33:07.942, Speaker C: That's all you have to think about. Now, with Balancer, there's a lot of other things you have to consider now as just a simple liquidity provider, as someone who just wants to put liquidity in and forget about it. Right. Obviously, Uniswap is probably going to appeal a lot more to you. Now, the question is, are there more of those people, or are there more people who care about the modularity, the customization? Right. And I actually think that it's the former, because using your analogy, Ryan, Android phones pretty much look like Apple phones now. It used to be all about customization, customizing literally everything you do on it.
01:33:07.942 - 01:33:51.202, Speaker C: But most people's Android phones are a Samsung, and they all look the same to me whenever I look at someone's Android. No one really cares about customizing their phone that much. So it's all about how much kind of, I guess, people care about what. And not to say that balancer can't succeed or anything, and not to say that maybe there is a lot of people that do care about that, or not just people, but liquidity, but yeah, that modularity is letting them down right now. I think because people just, it's too complex. There's no, I guess, like a shelling point, right, to go to. There's people just doing a million different things and a million different experiments, but we need to get to that point where they all converge and people learn the best practices of how to use balancer.
01:33:51.202 - 01:33:53.206, Speaker C: And I just don't think we're there at that point.
01:33:53.308 - 01:33:56.870, Speaker A: All right, bullish. Bearish. Neutral. Let's start with Anthony.
01:33:57.370 - 01:34:04.970, Speaker C: Definitely neutral because I can see the value. I just need to see it play out for me to be convinced.
01:34:05.470 - 01:34:28.002, Speaker B: I'm long term bullish. And I think when bigger players, bigger funds start to get into Ethereum, Balancer offers really compelling tools for funds to manage their own assets. I think we're going to have to wait for them to really come into the ecosystem and mature and figure out how to play in DFI. But once those types of people get in, balancers offers really compelling infrastructure to them.
01:34:28.136 - 01:34:45.910, Speaker A: Guys, we went through the DPI ten. That was fantastic. Anthony, thank you for your insight so much. Maybe just could you spend a minute talking about a couple of honorable mentions, maybe some assets that you think could jump into the DPI index in the next couple of quarters?
01:34:46.810 - 01:35:24.958, Speaker C: Yeah, I spoke about how there's a certain criteria that tokens have to meet to be included in the DPI. One of the strictest criteria is that it needs to be live for six months, the project, so six months or more and then it's eligible. But there's a bunch of other criteria, but that is the one that prevents most of the tokens from coming in. And that was put forward by DefI Pulse, the creators of the index. So I guess honorable mentions and ones that I think will go in soon because they're coming of age, so to speak. Sushiswap? Definitely that token and that project has had a renaissance over the last two to three months. It has become a community darling.
01:35:24.958 - 01:35:38.006, Speaker C: They're doing a lot of innovative things, and as I said, their project is coming up on six months, so they'll be eligible for inclusion. I don't see a reason why that won't get included. So definitely think that's going in when it can.
01:35:38.188 - 01:35:44.906, Speaker B: What about curve? If curve got a ton of value locked, how come curve hasn't made it into the d five pulse index yet?
01:35:45.088 - 01:36:28.394, Speaker C: From memory, I think it was because when their token launched, one of the criteria is that more than 5% of the token has to be in circulation, and their token launched with basically zero in circulation and has been increasing since then. I think at this point, it is eligible. I have to double check, but I think it is eligible, which means that it can be included during the next rebalance. But that's up to DFI pulse, who are the managers of this index, along with the index co op, which is a dow that actually manages these index products as well. We've never done something where we've included two tokens in the same rebalance. Rebalances happen monthly, so I don't think there's anything preventing us from doing that. But, yeah, curve should be eligible at this point.
01:36:28.394 - 01:36:56.658, Speaker C: You can actually go to pulse ink. That's where the methodology is. If people want to see what the criteria is for every inc. Yeah, you can scroll down and it'll show you the methodology, I think, down the bottom. Yeah. So there's the basically methodology there of why tokens aren't included or which ones can get included. There we go.
01:36:56.658 - 01:37:04.126, Speaker C: It's 7.5% of its supply, not 5%. So I think curve is at that point. So, yeah, it's probably eligible.
01:37:04.318 - 01:37:39.374, Speaker B: Well, you guys, this has been a walk through the tokens in the DPI as well as a few others. There are so many more tokens listed on DefI pulse that are worth paying attention to. The purpose of this episode was really to kind of go through the big ones so you could learn how Anthony thinks, how we think about some of these tokens and use some of these analytical tools and analytical mental models to do your own research. Right. This is how we do research. This is how we think about these things. So if you start to use that as your mental models, you will be better equipped to do your own research.
01:37:39.374 - 01:38:14.122, Speaker B: I think that DFI summer is coming. It'll be dFi winter this time because it's January, but dFI summer 2.0, I think that's here. Hopefully this episode will provide the listeners with really good mental models for how to understand what might be a really awesome time. I put out a tweet not too long ago that if you listen closely, you can hear the sound of DFI tokens popping off. And I kind of think that we're in second 45 of the three minute microwave popcorn bag where things you start to hear like a single pop, a second pop, but things are starting to heat up. That's where I think we are.
01:38:14.122 - 01:38:17.546, Speaker B: And I hope this episode kind of leads into that market.
01:38:17.728 - 01:38:26.800, Speaker A: Anthony, thank you so much for joining us. We hope by the time listeners hear this, you are out of Twitter jail, sir. And ETH has exceeded 1420, its all time high.
01:38:27.330 - 01:38:39.982, Speaker C: Yeah, always a pleasure, gents. Thank you for having me on again. I hope that this helps a lot of people listening to it to better analyze different DFI tokens. And, yeah, definitely hope that ETH is at all time high, sooner rather than later.
01:38:40.116 - 01:38:49.826, Speaker A: All right, fingers crossed, guys. Risks and disclaimers. Of course, none of this was financial. Financial advice. You need to do your own research. Defi is risky. So is ETH.
01:38:49.826 - 01:39:00.500, Speaker A: So is crypto. You could lose what you put in. But we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone. But we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
