00:00:00.170 - 00:00:21.294, Speaker A: Welcome to another episode of State of the Nation. We've got our ten predictions for 2023. David prepared this list. I'm just along for the ride. And just to give you some insights into kind of the the world of live streaming, we just barely got this live stream up. David right, you had a software update, and it kind of wrecked your live stream setup, but down to the wire. We made it here for you guys.
00:00:21.412 - 00:00:49.238, Speaker B: Yeah, just a few minutes late, but yeah, made a made a software update to OBS. Absolutely broke everything and then fixed it right at the last minute. Yet here we are. The stream must go on, and there's a lot of things to talk about for 2023, and that is what we are going to be covering today on the episode. We've got ten subjects, ten things we want to cover. The big categories that you all know and love. Bitcoin, ethereum, alt, layer ones, layer twos, prices, NFTs, regulation.
00:00:49.238 - 00:01:18.402, Speaker B: We got ten categories. A couple of ones I haven't mentioned yet that we just want to give our predictions for what they look like moving forward into 2023. Some of them will have more clear predictions than others, but I think we can look forward at the year ahead. Pull back some lessons that Ryan and I experienced going through the 2018 to 2020 bear market and apply them to the current state of crypto as it stands today. So we're going to go and run through all of these major categories of crypto just to see what lies ahead for us in 2023.
00:01:18.536 - 00:01:46.334, Speaker A: This is going to be raw thoughts, guys. It's going to come at you quick, so I hope you're ready before we get in. Got to talk about our friends and sponsors over at Osmosis. Osmosis is an app chain in the Cosmos ecosystem. The starter way to think about Osmosis is it's kind of the uniswap of Cosmos, the Cosmos Ecosystem. It's its own independent app chain, of course, but it allows you to trade Cosmos Ecosystem assets, swap one for another. But it's not just that.
00:01:46.334 - 00:02:15.814, Speaker A: There's also the ability to look at all of the assets in your portfolio. Has a wallet type feature, has the ability to stake. Also the ability to vote. So it mixes some other DeFi hub type tools into the system. And if you're coming from the world of ethereum, I think you'll notice a pretty easy user experience in that there is not MetaMask, but a wallet called Kepler, which is MetaMask like that. You can download and use it to get started. I recently did this.
00:02:15.814 - 00:02:27.434, Speaker A: David pretty impressed with Osmosis and the Cosmos ecosystem and what these guys are brewing up. So just a fun little adventure for 2023. I want to do more of these as we get into this year.
00:02:27.552 - 00:03:07.970, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm consistently learning that the crypto's best UX actually is not inside of the ethereum ecosystem. From what I've learned about the solana ecosystem. And now also the Cosmos Osmosis, Kepler wallet and all that stuff. Other people have better UX than what I've experienced with MetaMask and ledger, let me tell. So just to really drive this point home, osmosis is an app chain in the Cosmos ecosystem. There's also the Cosmos Hub, which is another app chain. So that is a different way of operating that if you are only used to the ethereum ecosystem that you'll have to learn about and how to navigate different app chains.
00:03:07.970 - 00:03:53.606, Speaker B: Not unlike layer twos on Ethereum, but something to get used to as well. Ryan, we have so much to cover in this episode. We're going to start with Bitcoin, and I actually had to ask my Bitcoin friends about what is ahead in the world of bitcoin, because I don't necessarily feel like I am equipped to answer that question. And so I've pulled in some extra help to talk about bitcoin, but then we're going to go into the broader subjects that the Bankless nation knows and loves alt, layer ones, ethereum, layer twos, et cetera. So all of that and more is coming up right after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible. Kraken has been a leader in the crypto industry for the last twelve years.

00:05:58.090 - 00:06:18.386, Speaker A: All right. Hope you guys enjoyed hearing about Kraken, our strategic sponsor in the exchange category for 2023. It's our recommended exchange going into this year. David we've got the ten predictions for 2023. I'm going to read out all of the categories we're going to cover really quick and then we'll hit them one by one. Number one, we're going to talk bitcoin number two, Ethereum. Then Prices.
00:06:18.386 - 00:06:40.074, Speaker A: Number four, Alt. Layer ones, layer twos, of course, then NFTs Dows CFI, that is centralized exchanges. Number nine, the CFTC and the SEC standoff. And number ten, some of our thematic predictions for 2023. Editor's Choice, Ryan's and David's. Thematic predictions. I'm going to have to think of mine before we get to the end here, I think.
00:06:40.074 - 00:07:12.870, Speaker A: David and we are along for the ride, sir, why don't you kick us off with we got to start with old Granddaddy Bitcoin, who started this whole crypto movement. Hats off to you, bitcoin. Without you, we wouldn't be here. What are the predictions for bitcoin in 2023? What's in store for us? David and we're looking right now at a bitcoin Havening clock. I'm going to read this out. 441 days, 22 hours, 51 minutes and 50 50 seconds till the next bitcoin havening. What does this mean?
00:07:12.940 - 00:08:03.318, Speaker B: Well, okay, so people will notice that is more than one year away, 441 days. But if we pay attention to the last time a bitcoin happening happened, there is this chant that gets chanted and it starts to start slowly and then it starts to bubble up and then it just becomes dominant throughout, like crypto Twitter, or at least bitcoin Twitter at the time, which is the happening is not priced in. And so my big prediction is around Q three, Q four of 2023 of this year. We are going to start to hear the happening is not priced in. The Havening is not priced in because the 2024 Havening date is scheduled around March. It's probably going to creep up earlier than March because that's kind of what happenings. Do they tend to accelerate? People think it's every four years, but it's actually quicker than four years because hash rate for bitcoin is up only.
00:08:03.318 - 00:08:14.390, Speaker B: But I think that is something to expect towards the end of this year, as you are going to start to hear the words that happening is not priced in. You remember this time four years ago, Ryan, when that was this dominant?
00:08:14.470 - 00:08:25.120, Speaker A: I do, and I'm curious, okay, so how many havings have you been here for? You remember the 2021? And that was certainly dominant. That was the chat leading a chant leading up to this. Do you remember the 2016 one?
00:08:26.130 - 00:08:28.670, Speaker B: I was not here for the 2016 happening.
00:08:28.740 - 00:08:52.310, Speaker A: I was partway here. I wasn't all the way here, but I was partway here. This was kind of early days of ethereum. And then prior to that, David, it goes dark for me. I guess the one prior to that must have been in 2020. Twelve or something at that point in time. But for folks that aren't familiar, this is when the supply issuance of bitcoin gets cut in half.
00:08:52.310 - 00:09:10.182, Speaker A: Hence the happening. And traditionally, David, as you've been saying, that has been very bullish bitcoin price, at least the narrative of bitcoin price, because what is bitcoin celebrated for? What is it known for? What is the one use case and thing that it does? It has 21 million bitcoin million units.
00:09:10.246 - 00:09:11.002, Speaker B: Yes, right.
00:09:11.056 - 00:09:45.606, Speaker A: And that there will only ever be 21 million. And so that is at least the promise of the bitcoin network. And that's what's coded in the algorithm. Of course, that is all at the end of the day, bankless would say socially enforced at some level, but we are approaching less and less issuance per year. It gets cut in half every four years. Now, in 2020, it felt like a lonely thing to say, but I know some of us were saying, okay, bitcoin community, the happening is coming up. We're excited about that algorithmic supply issuance, yay, not central bank backed, that's great.
00:09:45.606 - 00:10:51.238, Speaker A: Take the humans out of the money, that's wonderful. But also keep in mind, bitcoin community, that when you have in your issuance, you also have in your security budget. And the security budget happens to be a very important thing for your blockchain, because that is how a blockchain actually defends itself and provides settlement assurances. Security budget comes from primarily issuance in bitcoin, it's like 95% to 99% issuance, and a small fraction is transaction fees. That is how you pay the military to provide the defense service around bitcoin, the military for bitcoin, the analogy being miners proof of work. Miners. So while you're excited about getting closer to 21 million and cutting off your issuance and less supply available in the market now, I start to wonder if the 2024 happening, the community starts to wake up and realize, oh, our security budget is going down a lot, and can we really afford this? Do you think that'll be a new conversation and a new dynamic that we didn't see in the last decade?
00:10:51.334 - 00:11:33.946, Speaker B: It's going to be interesting because that is where you mean the last happening. That is where we saw some of these hardcore bitcoiners start to consider that angle, Hazu being one of the big ones. That was previously a very hardcore bitcoiner that started to come around to the idea of a security budget happening. I do not think that this happening is the happening that triggers a weakness in bitcoin security. I think we have still see FOMO yeah, I still think there's bitcoin's lack of security is a number of happenings away. And so I think just to play it forward how it happened last time, bitcoiners start chanting that happening is not priced in ethereum. People are like your guys'security budgets cut in half.
00:11:33.946 - 00:12:07.170, Speaker B: I think it's fundamentally bullish either way for the same reason that we are bullish on the supply of ether and ultrasound money. It's the same reason to be bullish about bitcoin. But I don't want to hang on the happening too much because, again, this is actually in 2024 and so not happening this year. It's just like you're going to start to see this rumbling. And so I asked my bitcoiner friend, CK, my podcast co host, before you, Ryan, what to watch out for in the world of your ex. My ex podcast co Host yeah, and what to watch out for in bitcoin in 2023. And his answers were bitcoin mining and this thing called Noster.
00:12:07.170 - 00:13:07.974, Speaker B: We'll take those one by one. But I think the things to watch out for, for bitcoin when it comes to bitcoin mining is the consolidation of bitcoin miners into either more central large entities or into newer entities that are also energy production, energy producers. And so if you look around, actually, I was doing a little bit of research before the show. If you look around, a lot of energy producers across various countries are also becoming bitcoin miners. And now that could actually, if you believe the bitcoin proof of work thesis, lead to integration of bitcoin into the real world power supply and the decentralized power grid and actually lead to the decentralization of bitcoin mining. If that is the trend, the other trend it could be is that a lot of these weaknesses in the current mining ecosystem, a lot of bankruptcies for the big, big bitcoin miners, lead to further consolidation centralization. That is something to watch out for.
00:13:07.974 - 00:13:42.482, Speaker B: That is a theme to watch out for. The other thing to watch out for is Noster, which is something that Eric Wall is predicting, just does not gain any traction. But this is the social media for the bitcoin world, for bitcoiners social media by bitcoiners, for bitcoiners. This is something I'm not very familiar with, but this is gaining a ton of attention in the bitcoin world and it is basically an implementation of sort of decentralized social media, but using bitcoin as the settlement layer for data. And so this is something that is gaining steam in the bitcoin world, really.
00:13:42.616 - 00:13:52.190, Speaker A: I wonder how this works. How are they doing that without bitcoin being kind of an expressive base layer in the know?
00:13:52.280 - 00:14:09.082, Speaker B: I don't know, but it's got a bunch of apps. And this is something to probably to explore if you are look, chess settlement assurances with chess, as in like I make my piece and I don't know why you want to put that data on the blockchain, but this is something that is being pioneered out of the bitcoin world.
00:14:09.216 - 00:14:39.378, Speaker A: It's really interesting that mining is a thing that hardcore bitcoiners are really excited about. To me, that's just not an area of interest for me personally. What I see is a lot of did you see someone tweeted out I think this was Evan Van Ness, that just before the end of the year, last year, over 50% for the last week of blocks or something of all bitcoin blocks, have been produced by one of two centralized miners.
00:14:39.474 - 00:14:41.346, Speaker B: Mining pools or mining pools.
00:14:41.378 - 00:15:05.680, Speaker A: Mining pools, yeah, mining pools. So this kind of centralization is I don't know, I guess there's this utopia where all of the major energy companies around the world become producers of bitcoin miners. But we're not really seeing that. All we're seeing is kind of the shake out of the bear market and just more consolidation in.
00:15:06.290 - 00:15:44.650, Speaker B: I don't know if I'm seeing that. Why I'm putting that as a conversation in this agenda is that is something to pay attention to. In 2023 is where the diffusion of mining power lies. At the end of there's just some bankruptcies that needs to happen asics are going to get distributed. But I will say that mining pools, I would say, are not a pretty weak form of centralization. In the same way that I can either run my ethereum staking node through rocket pool if I choose to, or run it solo, mining pools don't have ownership over the ASIC units. And so that's actually a weaker form of centralization.
00:15:45.550 - 00:15:55.038, Speaker A: I get that distinction overall. What's your take on bitcoin? So there's some excitement for the happening. Are you bullish bitcoin in 2023?
00:15:55.124 - 00:16:14.222, Speaker B: Well, I had to ask my friend about what the 2023 has in store for bitcoin because it's bitcoin not on your radar. Well, it's not on my radar, but also there's no roadmap. That's the point. And so there's designed to be not much on the roadmap for bitcoin. That's part actually a feature that the bitcoiners enjoy about bitcoin.
00:16:14.366 - 00:16:26.210, Speaker A: I do think it's down too much and is due to go up maybe in 2023. So we'll talk about that a little bit. What do we got next? We got ethereum, I think we're talking about so what's the prediction for ethereum?
00:16:26.290 - 00:16:58.542, Speaker B: Ethereum? Yeah. And I got this fantastic thread out of Proto Lambda and I've lost the particular tweet but it's about how many hard forks will Ethereum see this year? And Proto Lambda says we may see three Ethereum hard forks this year. I checked this take with Tim Baco and he was like, probably just two. And so, again, rough consensus out of the Ethereum land, but the two is a lot. Two is a lot. Two is a lot. And what are those two hard forks? Shanghai and Cancun are the next two hard forks.
00:16:58.542 - 00:17:17.538, Speaker B: These are the execution layer hard forks. Shanghai, of course, might as well be called the withdrawals hard fork. That is slated for probably March of this year, Pessimistically April. And then cancun would be EIP 4844 or Proto Dank Sharding. Also partly named after Proto Lambda.
00:17:17.554 - 00:17:17.734, Speaker A: Here.
00:17:17.772 - 00:17:38.286, Speaker B: Who's got this tweet? But that is what is in store with Ethereum hard forks this year. Probably almost certainly two hard forks Shanghai, to enable withdrawals in March April of 2023, and then Cancun later in the year to enable 4844. And those are going to be the two major Ethereum protocol upgrades for this year.
00:17:38.388 - 00:17:49.214, Speaker A: I heard people are talking about Cancun in Q Three as a possibility. And if EIP 4844 gets shipped in Q Three, that would be hugely bullish, very accelerated.
00:17:49.262 - 00:17:49.522, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:17:49.576 - 00:18:00.962, Speaker A: Can you remind people what 4844 is? So you said it's Proto Dank Sharding, but what is the net effect of this for the Ethereum ecosystem and for crypto?
00:18:01.026 - 00:18:37.590, Speaker B: Yeah, certainly it gives roll ups a first class status on Ethereum. So it really is changing the way Ethereum architecture is to really enable layer twos to take off the brakes and be unconstrained. Because what do roll ups do? They post data down to the Ethereum layer 14844. Gives a little sandbox of data on the beacon chain for roll ups to post data to, and to really allow roll ups to use the beacon chain for data availability, which allows them to have orders of magnitude increase in speed and cheaper transactions.
00:18:37.690 - 00:18:41.486, Speaker A: Don't you think then Cancun is like the alt layer one killer.
00:18:41.678 - 00:18:44.242, Speaker B: Yeah, that's always been the case. Yeah.
00:18:44.296 - 00:19:22.218, Speaker A: I guess what I'm just saying is we expect another bull market to come and ETH main net gas fees to increase. But now, instead of the transaction volume going to alternative layer ones, it is so cheap for that transaction volume. It's almost like close to zero cost for that transaction volume to go to layer twos. And they will be much more mature by the next bull cycle comes around. If I was an alternative layer one, I'd be a little bit worried about 4844 and Cancun and I'd be looking at my strategy and maybe thinking about how I might become a roll up and get my security from Ethereum because it's way cheaper.
00:19:22.314 - 00:20:02.410, Speaker B: Certainly. Moving on in Proto's predictions, he of course predicts that four, eight, four or four prototype Sharding will ship on Ethereum main net. So we've covered this, but he also says the line between chains will start to blur due to Eigen layer suave and large layer one stakers offering different sequencing as a surface solutions. And so this is a pretty 401 Ethereum level take. But Eigen layer is something that more and more people are clamoring about. A really quick TLDR on what Eigen layer is. It's generalized security for other computational resources using staked Ether.
00:20:02.410 - 00:20:46.140, Speaker B: So if you are staking your Ether, you can sign up for additional slashing assumptions, slashing conditions to secure something else such as an Oracle. And so you say you're a solo staker with 32 Ether. You're already signed up for the slashing conditions of validating incorrect blocks, but you can sign up for an additional slashing assumption for something else as in an Oracle layer or a data availability layer. And this is something eigen layer has captured a bunch of nerds attentions and people are talking about this more and more and more. So one of my predictions for 2023 is Eigen layer starts to be talked about even more probably throughout all of the entire year as we kind of reason about what this thing can do.
00:20:46.510 - 00:20:49.510, Speaker A: Do you know a date for Eigen layer when that ships?
00:20:49.590 - 00:21:05.886, Speaker B: When that ships main net? No, I do not. So this is not an Ethereum protocol. This is not like part of the all core devs call. This won't be an EIP. This is a startup that is working on this problem that is separate from any sort of core development from Ethereum.
00:21:05.998 - 00:21:11.970, Speaker A: Yeah, it's just leveraging the economic security of ETH the asset to economically secure more things.
00:21:12.040 - 00:21:13.906, Speaker B: More things hugely bullish for ETH the.
00:21:13.928 - 00:21:28.360, Speaker A: Asset, in my opinion. It's also just man, it adds another dimension to the whole game here and the economics behind it. And I'm both excited and simultaneously a little terrified of the downstream effects of this. But that's super cool.
00:21:28.730 - 00:21:56.962, Speaker B: And if I'm going to put on my ETH maxi hat again, I would be even like anytime, any reason you need to have a specialized chain that's not Ethereum, any other alt layer, one Eigen layer kind of is like, well, I can turn that into a commodity and I can just use E Staking. This is remember that take on the weekly roll up that we gave a while ago? I can't remember who I think Jimmy Rasua or something. He said Eigen layer will enable halal alt layer ones for oh, I get that.
00:21:57.016 - 00:22:31.770, Speaker A: And what I'm kind of worried about is just the stacking risks that we don't realize that get hidden in some ETH that you stake somewhere. And I'm worried about some big slashing events for people who don't anticipate the risk they're looking at. What this means is there'll be all sorts of ways to earn yield on your ETH besides just Staking and hey, do you want this 5% for going over here and using? Yeah, I'll take that. Sign up for 5%. Sounds great. But you don't realize in the background that there's also the stacking risk associated with that and something bad happens, David, as you know, it will give enough time, and then boom.
00:22:32.130 - 00:22:43.454, Speaker B: Have you ever played Skyrim and loaded up 2030 mods and they all start to conflict with each other? That feels like skyrim. That feels like what Eigen layer could do.
00:22:43.652 - 00:22:45.854, Speaker A: Exactly. What else we got here?
00:22:45.892 - 00:22:55.298, Speaker B: All right, moving last in our predictions on the ethereum ecosystem, I think I just want to raise the question, ryan, what do you think about this supply of ether throughout 2020?
00:22:55.384 - 00:22:58.386, Speaker A: Looking so freaking good, isn't it? Look at this, man.
00:22:58.488 - 00:23:12.522, Speaker B: Well, do you think it'll be deflationary or not deflationary? Because if you look at the chart right here, I don't really know. By the way, we were at 3000 ether a few hours ago, and we burned a bunch in the last. But what is this chart telling you?
00:23:12.576 - 00:23:30.686, Speaker A: First of all, let me just say this. Let me just say this. This is kind of a vanity guess, right? Whether you say it's inflationary or deflationary. First. I'll say, who the f cares? Click that button there. Simulate POW. Look at what it would have been had we had proof of work.
00:23:30.788 - 00:23:37.006, Speaker B: 1.4 million ether issued in the last 117 days if we were on proof.
00:23:37.038 - 00:23:40.866, Speaker A: Of work versus how much is it on simulated 2900?
00:23:40.968 - 00:23:42.766, Speaker B: See, who cares?
00:23:42.958 - 00:23:45.650, Speaker A: Over a million less ETH issued.
00:23:46.070 - 00:23:53.254, Speaker B: A million 400. Don't forget that extra 401.4 million of.
00:23:53.292 - 00:24:01.740, Speaker A: ETH that would have been issued was not issued. That is the bottom line here. Whether this thing is vanity metric, inflationary or deflationary doesn't even matter.
00:24:02.350 - 00:24:07.366, Speaker B: That is $1.8 billion that we have not issued.
00:24:07.478 - 00:24:32.130, Speaker A: It's so bullish. It's so stupid bullish, I don't even know. Okay, here's another thing I feel like is going back to the happening is like, man, ultrasound money totally takes the happening's thunder, doesn't it? Yeah. I mean, I find it really hard to get excited about a happening when ultrasound money exists anyway. I'll take that kind of the vanity metric. I still kind of bet that we end the year. Deflationary is my call.
00:24:32.130 - 00:24:39.574, Speaker A: I think block space demand increases even post EIP 4844. I think we're still deflationary on the year, if I had to call it.
00:24:39.612 - 00:25:10.426, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's right. And that's because I tweeted this out. That ether it's easier to burn ether than it is to issue it. As in, when there's demand for ethereum, we burn ether way faster than we issue ether. There's a cap on how fast we can issue ether. There is absolutely no cap on how fast we can burn ether. And so just because growth is constrained and contraction of supply is unconstrained, I think it's rational to say that we will burn ether.
00:25:10.426 - 00:25:20.066, Speaker B: We will be deflationary as in 2023. And this is also what Protolamba says. So he agrees with us that we'll be net deflationary in the second half of 2023.
00:25:20.168 - 00:25:27.502, Speaker A: Good. He's smart. He knows what he's talking about. That's great. All right, that's number two, bitcoin ETH. Number three is prices and price predictions. David?
00:25:27.566 - 00:25:51.846, Speaker B: Price predictions. Price predictions. And I don't really want to make specific price predictions because you and I are not necessarily our skill set, nor is it anyone's really skill set. No one really knows. But I do think we should take our time and reflect on what prices did during 2018 to 2020. And so we've got our price service provider Kraken up on the screen here, and if we zoom all the way back out, let's see if I can drag. No, I cannot drag.
00:25:51.846 - 00:26:00.110, Speaker B: I might have to go to Trading View. But do you remember the bitcoin price action between 2018 and 2020? Because it threw everyone for a tizzy.
00:26:00.530 - 00:26:04.082, Speaker A: Bitcoin pricing action between 20 wait, what did you say?
00:26:04.136 - 00:26:04.970, Speaker B: 2018 and 2020.
00:26:04.980 - 00:26:23.506, Speaker A: 2018 and 2020. I remember a successive down. Zoom in on this. This is exactly what I remember. Some chop and you saw at kind of the bottom. This is in 2018. This happened, I don't know, three times, it looks like, from the chart.
00:26:23.506 - 00:26:31.482, Speaker A: Something like this is we had a big massive leg down. And you catch your breath and you're like, oh, my God, I'm glad that's over.
00:26:31.536 - 00:26:31.898, Speaker B: Right?
00:26:31.984 - 00:26:42.202, Speaker A: And then we rise up, there's some hope, we get some green candles for a couple of weeks, maybe a month, maybe two goes by, and then boom, you get hit with the next leg. Is that what you're talking about?
00:26:42.256 - 00:27:03.378, Speaker B: A little bit, yeah. So at the top of the 2018 market, bitcoin is $20,000. And then it went down 83%, which, I mean, it was about roughly where we are now. We're not down. Bitcoin is not down that much. But then from the bottom, it goes up three X. It goes from 3000 to like, $14,000 in the middle of 2019.
00:27:03.378 - 00:27:22.070, Speaker B: And then what does it do after that? It goes down another 70%. And so me saying bitcoin went from three to 14 down to $4,000. Think about that. In today's terms, it's something like, where is it now? Like 15,000, back up to $40,000, back.
00:27:22.140 - 00:27:23.670, Speaker A: Down to down to 20.
00:27:23.740 - 00:27:48.370, Speaker B: $18,000. Yeah. And Ether did the same exact thing, right, except more, except worse. Right. And so here is the top of the 2017 market down 94%. And so then it bottoms out at around like, $80, and then it goes up to $380. So people who bought those $80 ETH made like a three and a half X inside of a year.
00:27:48.370 - 00:28:11.306, Speaker B: And then what does it do after that? It goes down 75 more percent again. Right. And then that's when DFI summer started. So we don't really have any specific predictions. I'm going to go ahead and say I don't think you have a specific price prediction, Ryan, but I'm going to say people should be cognizant of how fast these markets can whip around or how much they can whip. Around inside of a year.
00:28:11.408 - 00:28:19.546, Speaker A: So from a timeline perspective, we're kind of mid 2018 or so as far as like, length of the bear market, aren't we?
00:28:19.648 - 00:28:33.598, Speaker B: I would say it's almost lining up pretty perfectly because the top of the 2018 bull market was like January of 2017. December months off, I guess. Yes, a few months off. So if we want to I just closed the tab, but if we want.
00:28:33.604 - 00:28:37.930, Speaker A: To, like, that's a rough analogy though, right? So 2022 is like 2018.
00:28:38.010 - 00:28:38.350, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:28:38.420 - 00:28:40.286, Speaker A: So then 2023 should be I think.
00:28:40.308 - 00:28:46.118, Speaker B: We'Re like right here's. Ether price. I think we are like right here in 2018 terms, you're saying is I.
00:28:46.124 - 00:29:08.300, Speaker A: Think you're trying to draw lessons from the previous runs and you're saying, hey, expect run ups and then major dips, major crashes to kind of test your conviction. This will probably happen in 2023 and partially into 2024. But is it a fallacy to think that every bear market plays out the same way?
00:29:09.230 - 00:29:40.642, Speaker B: I remember going through the last bear market and everyone was like, oh, next cycle, next cycle, next cycle. And I was like, everyone's saying the next cycle. Doesn't that mean if everyone's saying it, it's not going to come? And then it totally came. And so I think that you just assume that it's going to play out exactly how people expect it to with another cycle. And really, I think what people should watch out for is like, Bitcoin might have a run up to $40,000. Ether might have a run up to $3,000. People are going to get really bullish.
00:29:40.642 - 00:29:53.820, Speaker B: People say the bear market or the bull market's on and the bull market is not going to be on and it's going to buck people off and people are going to try and trade it and they're going to, on net lose money as they try and trade that thing.
00:29:54.510 - 00:30:16.278, Speaker A: This is why I was never a full believer in the super cycle, David. I'm still a believer and I think this is proven out. Like, if you kind of zoom out, right, is crypto markets play out in fractals. So this is the next kind of fractal. We're just at higher numbers on the highs and higher numbers on the low, but it's just going to play out. And that's kind of repeated every cycle. And now the cycles might lengthen.
00:30:16.278 - 00:30:57.998, Speaker A: There might be kind of different timelines involved, but I'm fully anticipating, and I think the base guess is probably the right guess, which is just playing for another fractal. It's going to happen in the way it has in similar bear markets now. People always interject, but what about macro? Macro is completely different. I don't know if you have a take on that, but I guess my take is I don't actually think macro is going to affect the crypto cycles in the way people think it will. I think just the fractal will play out. How it's going to play out maybe it could be kind of elongated or dampened or something like that by macro, but I just think it's all in the charts. It's already destined, it's already pre planned that it's going to play out this way.
00:30:58.084 - 00:31:08.846, Speaker B: I think that's right. I think macro, like, if the Fed had this immaculate pivot, it would nudge crypto prices in a particular direction, as in the Fed's, like, all right, we're going to ease up on interest rates.
00:31:08.878 - 00:31:09.650, Speaker A: Easy money again.
00:31:09.720 - 00:31:33.690, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that'll be bullish. I think that'll be a plus 20% day. A plus 50% day. I don't think it will create a bull market. Crypto needs to create a bull market under its own steam, and that takes time, that takes building, that takes innovation. And so, sure, we could be, like, nudged by macro in particular directions, but crypto is going to come out of this bear market under its own steam, not just because something else happened to us.
00:31:33.840 - 00:32:11.330, Speaker A: So we think that's bitcoin, ether, the same thing. Now you have a take where you think ETH is going to lead bitcoin always, and I guess maybe that's a play on kind of the ratio, too. Is that what you're showing, the bitcoin ratio? And I know you have said previously that ETH has led the last bull markets. I think I know what you mean by that, which is like ETH use cases, if not the asset price, but ETH use cases certainly have led the previous bull markets. And do you think that will remain true, or do you think it's kind of true in a different way for the next bull cycle? What do you think happens to ETH?
00:32:11.410 - 00:32:53.058, Speaker B: Yeah, I think ether, the price of ether has not led bull markets. I think it's gone perhaps it's followed bitcoin, perhaps it's gone in tandem with bitcoin, but every time there's a bull market, it's because of something on the Ethereum app layer that's been true as long as Ethereum has been in existence. ICOs first ICOs in 2017, DFI summer in 2020. Well, bitcoin and Ether did absolutely nothing while we had this amazing bull market in the DFI space, which ran into a bull market in NFTs and then Ether and bitcoin rocketed. And so there was a bull market on the Ethereum app layer for a full year before bitcoin and ether prices reacted. I expect that to play out again.
00:32:53.224 - 00:32:57.830, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I agree with you. Do you have any predictions on the ETH bitcoin ratio?
00:32:58.250 - 00:33:16.554, Speaker B: I think it is going to do something like that go up? Yeah, it's going to go up. I am not a charter, I don't have a crystal ball, but I am positioned to benefit from an increase ratio in ETH, BTC, which is why the current price action is exciting to me.
00:33:16.592 - 00:33:25.018, Speaker A: And remind me, where's the flipping? Where are we now? And where's the flipping? So right now we're at zero point 76.
00:33:25.104 - 00:33:31.600, Speaker B: Yes, zero 77. And then the flipping is about here. We need to get here at about.
00:33:32.770 - 00:33:43.874, Speaker A: ETH price just needs to double. So if ETH price hits, what, 3000 or something while Bitcoin stays stagnant at this price, then we flipping, is that right?
00:33:43.912 - 00:33:52.226, Speaker B: Yeah. We need to hit zero point 15. If Bitcoin stays exactly the same price, we need Ether to be $2,700, and we will flip Bitcoin.
00:33:52.338 - 00:33:53.782, Speaker A: That doesn't seem that far away.
00:33:53.836 - 00:33:54.920, Speaker B: Doesn't seem that far.
00:33:55.690 - 00:34:07.482, Speaker A: I'm still not calling it for 2023, but it feels like it approaches. All right, alt layer ones. That's the next category. David, what are the predictions for alternative layer ones?
00:34:07.536 - 00:34:32.834, Speaker B: Alt layer ones? And so I've got CoinGecko pulled up with smart contracting platforms. We Got BNB cardano solana Polkadot tron Avalanche And then I think that's all of them. There's some other ones as well, but I think I just want to get your broad. Take, Ryan, on the landscape of what it's like to be an alt layer one right now. Where do you think the alt layer one ecosystem is in its current form?
00:34:33.032 - 00:35:12.046, Speaker A: Well, I think it had a narrative run up on the idea and on the entire narrative that ETH gas fees, ETH transaction fees were too damn high. And that was the value proposition of kind of ETH killers. Very few of them, if any, developed their own independent set of tools. Many of them were EVM based, and so they kind of just glommed onto the existing Ethereum tools. I think Solana is maybe somewhat of an exception. They have a different developer community. They have some unique tools like Phantom, so there's some life there.
00:35:12.046 - 00:35:50.314, Speaker A: Cosmos also a little bit different. Cardano really hasn't done anything. It's just been a lot of talk. There's, like, nothing really not much you can do on Cardano at this point. So I think back to EIP 4844 being sort of the alternative layer one killer is if you lose the value proposition of being a cheaper version of Ethereum, what then do you have? And I think they're in a precarious position, though I do think many of them will come through this perhaps a little bit stronger. Many of them, not many of them. Some of them.
00:35:50.314 - 00:35:51.370, Speaker A: A few of them.
00:35:51.520 - 00:35:54.822, Speaker B: I think one or two will come through them.
00:35:54.896 - 00:36:07.006, Speaker A: It's like if you're talking about Cosmos as an entire ecosystem, there are many different app chains and count that as one that might be one. I think Solana might pull through this. Nothing's really happened with Dot. David.
00:36:07.118 - 00:36:24.534, Speaker B: Dude. I know, man. Okay, so we have BNB, and so you say, what is the place of the alt layer one in the face of EIP 4844? I think that's definitely something to consider. But also, what's the place of an alt layer one when Binance Smart chain exists at the same time?
00:36:24.572 - 00:36:24.902, Speaker A: I know.
00:36:24.956 - 00:36:27.858, Speaker B: Which is a gargantuan of a chain.
00:36:27.954 - 00:36:33.498, Speaker A: And I think you can't really call BNB chain an alt layer one. It's something else.
00:36:33.584 - 00:36:40.566, Speaker B: But if you're going to compromise on decentralization and security as well, you may just use Binance smart chain.
00:36:40.678 - 00:36:52.080, Speaker A: Yeah, I know. It's this place in the middle. It's kind of the idea that the middle cannot hold. And that's what some of these chains are doing and trying to do. So I'm not bullish on them.
00:36:52.770 - 00:37:04.066, Speaker B: So, looking at some market caps, finance smart chain is coming in at $45 billion. Cardano is coming in at $11 billion, salon is at six, polka dots at six, tron is at five. Can you show that?
00:37:04.088 - 00:37:05.540, Speaker A: Can you scroll to the red a little bit?
00:37:05.910 - 00:37:06.660, Speaker B: Yes.
00:37:07.510 - 00:37:07.970, Speaker A: Okay.
00:37:08.040 - 00:37:24.966, Speaker B: Tron is at $5 billion, avalanche at 3.8, cosmos at 3.2. Ryan, you've been saying Cosmos while we were talking about alt layer. Once Coin Gecko doesn't actually put Cosmos in the smart contract platform category.
00:37:24.998 - 00:37:33.040, Speaker A: No, I get it. Doesn't have smart contracts on Cosmos, the app chain, you have to go to, like Osmosis. Yeah.
00:37:34.770 - 00:37:45.246, Speaker B: Cosmos at $3.2 billion, where finance smart chain is at 45, cardano is at eleven and Salon is at six. Makes me really bullish on Cosmos.
00:37:45.358 - 00:37:47.666, Speaker A: It's different, though, Dave, which is why.
00:37:47.688 - 00:37:49.474, Speaker B: I'm bullish, because it's different.
00:37:49.592 - 00:38:00.674, Speaker A: But here's why it's different, in my opinion, is just because you can be bullish on the Cosmos ecosystem without necessarily being bullish on atoms, the asset of Cosmos.
00:38:00.722 - 00:38:01.174, Speaker B: Yes.
00:38:01.292 - 00:38:02.502, Speaker A: Two totally different things.
00:38:02.556 - 00:38:03.746, Speaker B: I am bullish on cosmos.
00:38:03.778 - 00:38:41.890, Speaker A: The it's if people get that confused, then they'll run into a bad time. I think investing in Cosmos, which is very different than investing in even Binance, which if the Binance ecosystem grows or the BNB ecosystem grows, then value should occur to BNB because that is the kind of the unit of account, it is the ether of BNB chain. But cosmos is mean. That should scale with the amount of app chains that are using the Cosmos hub. And they don't even have to use the Cosmos hub, David. They can use their own mesh security. They don't have to use Cosmos at all.
00:38:41.890 - 00:38:46.478, Speaker A: And so it's kind of an apple. I think it's an apples to oranges sort of comparison.
00:38:46.574 - 00:38:52.886, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's a pretty fair take. We will see. I do not think there's a lot of alt layer ones out there.
00:38:52.988 - 00:38:53.542, Speaker A: Like again.
00:38:53.596 - 00:39:00.522, Speaker B: Cardano, solana polkadot. Tron. Avalanche. Cosmos finance. Smart chain. How many can actually make it through this bear market?
00:39:00.656 - 00:39:23.802, Speaker A: I think if you have a cult leader, you're much better situated. That's why it's ironically, Cardano is not going to die. Ada is not going to die. Because use cases. Yeah, I hate that. That's probably right, don't you think? I'm like, actually, relative to some of these others. I'm bullish on that on Ada.
00:39:23.802 - 00:39:24.238, Speaker A: Right.
00:39:24.324 - 00:39:26.078, Speaker B: Just because of the cult of Charles.
00:39:26.254 - 00:40:07.760, Speaker A: Yeah. And look, we said it before, we said this all the time in the last bear market, is if you have any doubts about if you're questioning, if you're wondering which chain you should invest in try to use stuff on the like like, does it work? Can you do DeFi things? Can you do cool things on it? Is it a step change from something that you might find in established ecosystem like Ethereum? If it is, that's bullish. So many people watch the YouTube and they don't actually do the work to run the software and to actually use the applications. It's as simple as that. Until there's applications on some of these chains that I can actively use, I'm just not.
00:40:10.610 - 00:40:17.518, Speaker B: How do you I don't know how to measure cardano block space demand, and that's probably an indication. All right, should we move on to layer twos?
00:40:17.614 - 00:40:18.354, Speaker A: Yeah, let's do it.
00:40:18.392 - 00:40:43.990, Speaker B: All right. Layer twos. Of course. Layer two beat. Right now I declare that layer twos are in a bull market of activity. And one of the few areas of growth that's happened in the last year, which was a terrible year, was layer twos. Ryan, the best asset to hold last year was, if you didn't know this token called GMX, which is an application on Arbitrum.
00:40:43.990 - 00:40:47.526, Speaker B: And here's the price chart for GMX.
00:40:47.718 - 00:40:49.706, Speaker A: Look at that. How does it go?
00:40:49.728 - 00:41:02.798, Speaker B: It's going up. It went up in 2022. That is one of, like, three tokens that went up in 2022. Tokens? No, three tokens. That's it.
00:41:02.884 - 00:41:03.454, Speaker A: Oh, my God.
00:41:03.492 - 00:41:03.982, Speaker B: That's it.
00:41:04.036 - 00:41:06.410, Speaker A: Besides, stablecoins stayed flat, hopefully.
00:41:06.490 - 00:41:19.240, Speaker B: Stablecoins stay flat. Yeah. So that was on Arbitrum. Arbitrum. The Arbitrum ecosystem is just running circles around almost everyone else. Arbitrum's got 2.3 trillion or trillion billion in total locked value.
00:41:19.240 - 00:41:26.022, Speaker B: This was a 2022 bear market and total TVL on Arbitrum stayed about the same.
00:41:26.156 - 00:41:38.460, Speaker A: Yeah, I love the Arbitrum optimism rivalry because I think they both red versus blue. Yeah. They make each other better. And I just love that they're both there and they're both fully like. I can honestly say I support them both.
00:41:40.590 - 00:41:54.094, Speaker B: Look at this. Here is a half a million dollars on optimism in January of a year ago. And now we are at 1.27 billion. We had growth in layer twos last year.
00:41:54.132 - 00:41:59.378, Speaker A: Hit activity. Can we hit activity on some of these? Does that story this is transactions, right?
00:41:59.464 - 00:42:00.482, Speaker B: Transactions, yeah.
00:42:00.536 - 00:42:20.262, Speaker A: Total locked value, which is a metric, an important metric. Not the only metric, but it's kind of a vanity metric. And then you have activity. Activity is transactions. And transactions are just like up a whole bunch. If you go to the top go to the top here of L two B and hit activity on the right and see aggregate activity. And I love that line there.
00:42:20.262 - 00:42:23.226, Speaker A: That line in blue, I think, is Ethereum main net activity, isn't it?
00:42:23.248 - 00:42:24.122, Speaker B: Correct. Yes.
00:42:24.256 - 00:42:33.642, Speaker A: And we're above, where now we've been consistently above since October. Ish Ethereum main net activity on layer twos. That has been a flipping in the Ethereum ecosystem.
00:42:33.706 - 00:42:52.830, Speaker B: Yeah. And the scaling factor, 2.48, that's the highest I've ever seen it. Scaling factor is how many times. Layer twos on Ethereum are transacting one ethereum's worth of transactions on the aggregate layer two. So there are 2.48 times the amount of transactions of the ethereum layer one happening on layer twos.
00:42:52.830 - 00:42:59.480, Speaker B: My prediction, Ryan, I put this in the newsletter, is that this number hits five. And I think that's a pretty safe prediction for 2022.
00:43:00.570 - 00:43:10.454, Speaker A: I think it's conservative. But what happens if I guess these are used transactions, right? It's not total capacity, is it? It's not total available capacity.
00:43:10.502 - 00:43:25.774, Speaker B: So capacity is way capacity might be like ten or something. The scaling capacity, we actually don't really know the upper bounds to layer twos. The scaling capacity could be like a ten x, and when we hit 4844, it's going to be something like 100 x.
00:43:25.972 - 00:43:39.554, Speaker A: So we've been bullish layer twos relative to alt layer ones for a long time, and for a good portion of 2021, and for a good portion of 2022, that has been the wrong bet.
00:43:39.672 - 00:43:43.170, Speaker B: In 2021. That was the wrong bet for that one year.
00:43:43.320 - 00:44:11.338, Speaker A: Yes. And then into the first three months of 2022 was kind of the wrong bet. But again, Bankless Thesis operates on longer term horizons. Right. In crypto, you either invest in the trade level that is like kind of daily to weekly sort of thing, or you invest in the narrative level, the timeline there is like every few weeks or months. Or you invest in Thesis and fundamentals, your timeline, there could be years. I think that we've been right on that call.
00:44:11.424 - 00:44:17.280, Speaker B: I think so it was the time frame that was at odds with people, right.
00:44:18.050 - 00:44:23.662, Speaker A: People were stuck in a narrative timeline that lasted months rather than the Thesis timeline, which is like years plus.
00:44:23.716 - 00:44:23.886, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:44:23.908 - 00:44:31.566, Speaker A: That's why people say this. Investors say this all the time, but a lot of arguments on crypto Twitter are just time frame arguments.
00:44:31.598 - 00:44:33.474, Speaker B: Time frame arguments? Yeah. Semantics. Yeah.
00:44:33.512 - 00:44:45.350, Speaker A: People arguing past each other because the time frame is wrong. And we've consistently say bullish layer twos relative to alternative layer ones. And you could be laughed at for saying that in 2021, couldn't you?
00:44:45.420 - 00:45:10.014, Speaker B: Right. Well, now it is the inverse. So I've got the optimism chart up on the screen and this optimism, the Op token launched in June, so we have seven months of data. But do you see the bear market in that chart? No. You don't really see the FTX contagion, you don't really see Ciros Capital getting liquidated. This does not look like a bear market chart. And Optimism just dropped their token with a $5.5
00:45:10.014 - 00:45:24.180, Speaker B: billion valuation fully diluted. Arbitrum hasn't even dropped their token yet, and so it still got that in the hopper. And all these other layer two tokens are doing really well.
00:45:24.630 - 00:45:26.950, Speaker A: So what's the prediction? Bullish layer twos?
00:45:28.170 - 00:45:35.830, Speaker B: The bull market will continue to be hosted by layer twos, as it has been for the past like, six plus months.
00:45:35.980 - 00:45:39.026, Speaker A: These ecosystems are very much alive.
00:45:39.138 - 00:45:39.606, Speaker B: Yes.
00:45:39.708 - 00:45:41.910, Speaker A: The most alive thing in crypto, in my opinion.
00:45:41.990 - 00:45:44.394, Speaker B: 100%. I'm trying to click these things, but.
00:45:44.432 - 00:45:46.762, Speaker A: Oh, that's because what else do I have here?
00:45:46.896 - 00:46:03.634, Speaker B: Oh, StarkNet also doesn't have its token released. And so there's still a bunch of hype and attention. And finding attention in bear markets is really hard. And we have Arbitrum and we have StarkNet, and these communities are extremely strong, and there's not even a token out there for them yet.
00:46:03.752 - 00:46:05.026, Speaker A: ZK sync as well.
00:46:05.048 - 00:46:06.002, Speaker B: ZK sync as well.
00:46:06.056 - 00:46:11.138, Speaker A: ZKE EVMs scroll making a significant progress. Working on a testnet right now.
00:46:11.304 - 00:46:35.222, Speaker B: So here's one of Eric Wall's predictions, is that Ethereum layer two, TVL, reaches above $10 billion. Where are we right now? We are at five four, five, no less than that. I'm pretty sure three. So he's expecting a little bit more than a doubling of TVL conservative.
00:46:35.366 - 00:46:37.674, Speaker A: Yeah, I call for 25.
00:46:37.872 - 00:46:40.246, Speaker B: 25 is extremely bullish.
00:46:40.358 - 00:46:43.834, Speaker A: Yeah. And that may bleed into next year, let me just say that.
00:46:43.872 - 00:46:49.182, Speaker B: But definitely by the end of 2024, I would say that 25 is good.
00:46:49.316 - 00:46:50.190, Speaker A: Yeah, cool.
00:46:50.260 - 00:47:25.094, Speaker B: All right, Bankless Nation, we got some other conversations that we're going to talk about. I've got some opinions as to where NFTs are going in 2023. Brian's going to have to ask me. But we also have to talk about what is the state of CFI in 2023. Because for better or for worse, CFI is a fundamental part of how crypto is going to be. And then also we got to talk about regulation because a lot of things are going to be happening in 2023 as it relates to this SEC and the CFTC, there are some specific cases that we're going to call attention to that are cases to watch. And then Ryan, I had Dows in the original agenda, but I actually replaced that with Bankless.
00:47:25.094 - 00:48:10.182, Speaker B: So what's coming for Bankless in 2023? Because we've got some plans and then what Ryan and David are bullish on. So all of this and more right after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make this episode possible. Uniswap is the largest on chain marketplace for self custody digital assets. Uniswap is, of course, a decentralized exchange, but you know this because you've been listening to Bankless. But did you know that the Uniswap web app has a shiny new Fiat onramp? Now, you could go directly from Fiat in your bank to Tokens in DFI inside of Uniswap. Not only that, but polygon, Arbitrum and optimism layer twos are supported right out of the gate, but that's just DFI. Uniswap is also an NFT aggregator, letting you find more listings for the best prices across the NFT world.
00:48:10.182 - 00:48:53.030, Speaker B: With Uniswap, you can sweep floors on multiple NFTs, and Uniswap's universal router will optimize your gas fees for you. Uniswap is making it as easy as possible to go from bank account to bankless assets across Ethereum. And we couldn't be more thankful for having them as a sponsor so go to app Uniswap.org today to buy, sell, or swap tokens and NFTs. Arbitrum One is pioneering the world of secure Ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the Web Three landscape. Hundreds of projects have already deployed on Arbitrum One, producing flourishing DFI and NFT ecosystems. With a recent addition of arbitram nova gaming and social DApps like Reddit are also now calling arbitram home.
00:48:53.030 - 00:49:33.234, Speaker B: Both Arbitrum One and Nova leverage the security and decentralization of Ethereum and provide a builder experience that's intuitive, familiar and fully EVM compatible. On Arbitrum, both builders and users will experience faster transaction speeds with significantly lower gas fees. With arbitrum's recent migration to Arbitrum Nitro, it's also now ten times faster than before. Visit Arbitrum IO, where you can join the community, dive into the developer docs, bridge your assets, and start building your first DAP with Arbitrum experience web Three development the way it was meant to be secure, fast, cheap, and friction free. How many total airdrops have you gotten? This last bull market had a ton of them. Did you get them all? Maybe you missed one. So here's what you should do.
00:49:33.234 - 00:50:09.342, Speaker B: Go to Earnify and plug in your Ethereum wallet, and Earnify will tell you if you have any unclaimed airdrops that you can get. And it also does poaps and mintable NFTs any kind of money that your wallet can claim, earnify will tell you about it. And you should probably do it now because some airdrops expire. And if you sign up for Earnify, they'll email you anytime one of your wallets has a new AirDrop for it to make sure that you never lose an AirDrop ever again. You can also upgrade to Earnify premium to unlock access to airdrops that are beyond the basics and are able to set reminders for more wallets. And for just under $21 a month, it probably pays for itself with just one AirDrop. So plug in your wallets at Earnify and see what you get.
00:50:09.342 - 00:50:14.430, Speaker B: That's Earnifi. And make sure you never lose another AirDrop.
00:50:16.210 - 00:50:30.082, Speaker A: Back with our ten predictions, went through the first five. Number six. We got to talk about NFTs. David. All right, I am the student, you are the teacher. Tell me about NFTs. What's going to happen in this crazy world of overpriced? JPEGs.
00:50:30.082 - 00:50:35.606, Speaker A: Just JPEGs. What are NFTs to begin with, and where are they going in 2023?
00:50:35.708 - 00:51:05.038, Speaker B: Yeah, I think this is something that we can draw a lesson out of. The 2018 to 2020 bear. We had ICOs that just totally decimated the brand of crypto. Sadly, this bear market, we have two things tainting the brand of crypto, one of them being FTX, one of them being NFTs. If you go into any normal Internet forum, non crypto forum, and you say the word like NFT, you just get bullied. Please leave. We don't want to talk about your stupid NFL.
00:51:05.054 - 00:51:12.210, Speaker A: It's always a three letter acronym. That's a problem. ICO NFT RSA.
00:51:14.390 - 00:51:56.862, Speaker B: Okay, but what did we see? What lesson did we learn from 2018 to 2020? Like ICOs, they really just turned into governance tokens. They evolved, they got better. All of the fraudsters and the Scammers and the short termists left this space, and then what were we left with? Capital allocation and tokens. And that turned into dows, that turned into governance tokens, that turned into airdrops, that turned into yield farming, which started good, ended bad. I think NFTs will have a similar arc. And actually, I think NFTs in their current farm are in a much better spot than ICOs ever were. Board ape, yacht club, mutant apes, cool cats, pudgy penguins, azukis.
00:51:56.862 - 00:52:24.794, Speaker B: These are like real efforts by real teams to produce real things. And so all of the short term NFTs got just pushed out already, and now there's a flight to quality projects. And so this is what I see. I see NFT teams are going to really fight for their market cap. They're going to fight for raising the value of their NFT. That's kind of the purpose of these whole teams to begin with. And they're going to do that through raw innovation and refinement as to whatever their product is.
00:52:24.912 - 00:52:52.078, Speaker A: So you think that in the same way, ICOs were a complete laughingstock, NFTs are a complete laughing stock now. But what we saw is the transformation of some ICO tokens. Let's say all the sketchy teams in the Scams, they just died. Those projects dried up and died. They left, they're gone. But the ones that remained, like the well, uniswap, didn't have a token. But I'm thinking of like project like synthetics or link rocket pools, rocket pool.
00:52:52.078 - 00:53:24.318, Speaker A: These projects remained and they transformed their token into utility types of tokens. At least the utility is some governance participation with the potential promise of future cash flows. Right? And that was a big pivot from a time we said all tokens are worthless to, hey, some of these are actually worthwhile. You think the same thing could happen with NFTs? This would imply that NFTs add some sort of utility. Is that the resurrection of NFTs? That they become more than just the JPEG? There's something else to it.
00:53:24.484 - 00:53:45.394, Speaker B: I think that's right. And this has been the trend that I've noticed in the crypto space. First. We created Bitcoin. It was this static collectible, no utility asset. And then after every single asset that's gotten adopted by the crypto space after that has had some form of productivity, some form of utility. What can you do with Ether? You can stake it.
00:53:45.394 - 00:54:17.454, Speaker B: What can you do with Ether? You can put it in DeFi, you can use it as gas to pay for stuff. So Ether has a lot more utility than Bitcoin. Bitcoin has this blessing of getting to be this static, inert collectible asset. Same thing with NFTs. We created crypto punks. CryptoPunks have this blessing of being able to be this inert collectible. Every single other NFT board apes azukis penguins unlock some sort of access for their holders, some sort of privilege, famously like nightclub parties in New York.
00:54:17.454 - 00:54:48.630, Speaker B: If you're a board ape, that's kind of the brand or yacht hoggers or whatever, but each one is going to provide utility and reasons for its community to hold them and buy them and own them. And so my claim for 2023 with the world of NFTs is that NFTs are the closest prediction of closest prototypes to Belagi's network state thesis that we have. And so I think we start to look like these NFT communities start to look like some sort of prototype network state idea in the Metaverse.
00:54:48.970 - 00:55:02.606, Speaker A: Yeah. What's the link to Bellagy's network state idea? These are just communities that believe in something, have a shared set of values, and are passionate and are on the.
00:55:02.628 - 00:55:33.126, Speaker B: Trajectory towards building out a universe. So bloggy's Network state is really about getting people with like minded people together and then physically instantiating the world somewhere. I don't really think that we're going that far, but one of his big metaphors for his network state was like with Google or Facebook, if you worked at Be, you would have access to any Facebook campus all over the world and you would have this little badge. You could get into the Facebook building no matter where that Facebook building was.
00:55:33.148 - 00:55:34.930, Speaker A: If it was corporate privilege.
00:55:35.090 - 00:56:04.738, Speaker B: Exactly. And so he said that this is starting to look like a network state. I think that's going to be largely similar with NFTs, not necessarily in the real world, but also not that there are cool cats meetup. I've been to a cool cat meetup in La. The Board Apes have parties all the time. But then there's also going to be similar vibes inside of virtual lands. Like the Board Apes are building out other deeds and the Board Apes aren't other yuga labs is, they're building out virtual places for their token holders to be able to experience.
00:56:04.738 - 00:56:09.570, Speaker B: And I think that is starting to look and feel like Bellagi's network state idea.
00:56:09.720 - 00:56:53.402, Speaker A: I think that hits on the current survival, like the current cohort of NFT projects that we have. But I also wonder about a new cohort of NFT projects that are kind of built during this market. So we're talking about NFTs and some of the existing communities, but we haven't yet touched, like gaming NFTs. Are they going to be a thing this year? What are artists going to do? Like sound NFTs music, NFTs, that sort of thing? We're not even talking about that here. And I think that's a bunch of latent potential here. We are looking at Anansen, which NFT folks tell me is this is an index of NFT projects where you can kind of track price over time if you go to the top here. David, what are we looking at? Charts.
00:56:53.402 - 00:57:40.830, Speaker A: This is across different sectors. Blue chip is the orange line here. And so I guess maybe. I'm asking from a price perspective, to be honest, it's not down that much. I think this is all priced in ETH terms, which is honestly, in my opinion, the right denominator for any sort of metaverse item like an NFT. As you want this to appreciate relative to ETH, it's kind of the unit of account here. And I guess I'm wondering, from your perspective, do you think the indices as a whole, like art or blue chip, the top ten NFT projects or metaverse or gaming or social, will they appreciate relative to ETH? Do you think that's a way to think about this market?
00:57:40.980 - 00:58:13.690, Speaker B: I think that that is the goal that NFT teams ought to have. Whether they actually do that or not, I don't know, but that is in my mind. Why do NFT teams, centralized, coordinated teams exist? It's to increase the ETH denominated value of the NFTs that they represent. And I think this bear market, 2023 is going to be the time where teams get really scrappy and innovative to encourage an appreciation of NFTs in ether terms.
00:58:13.840 - 00:58:19.894, Speaker A: That's what we're all trying to do, increase our value in ethnominate ETH terms. Okay, regulation.
00:58:19.942 - 00:58:37.466, Speaker B: David, what do you think regulation comes after CFI? I don't really have anything to say, so I'm just going to stop sharing screen and we're just going to talk about CFI really quick because the CFI landscape is being stressed right now. Coinbase, as of today, announced that they are doing a round of layoffs just because it's crypto.
00:58:37.498 - 00:58:38.610, Speaker A: Winter, another 20%.
00:58:38.680 - 00:59:08.922, Speaker B: Another 20%. Kraken did a round of layoffs, gemini did a big round of layoffs. Layoff seasons. I would say it's not behind us because we've already done it all, but FTX really soured everything as it relates to centralized entities. No one wants to hear the word CFI these days. So I just kind of want to get your perspective as like in moving into 2023, what's the state of CFI and how do you think that's going to play out for the next year?
00:59:09.056 - 00:59:31.170, Speaker A: I think one thing that's true is we can't throw out the baby with the bathwater, right? So crypto, they're just like a pendulum. They go to extremes on one side or the other. And so it was centralized exchanges can do no wrong. Put all your money in these centralized exchanges, centralized lending, it's glorious amazing.
00:59:31.240 - 00:59:32.638, Speaker B: Why use the blockchain?
00:59:32.734 - 00:59:35.298, Speaker A: FTX, like, why blockchain? Yes, all of these things.
00:59:35.384 - 00:59:39.018, Speaker B: Let the centralized entities use the blockchains. You just use the centralized entity.
00:59:39.054 - 01:00:28.838, Speaker A: Exactly. We swung from that side of the pendulum to this other side, which is a little unhealthy in that we're like, oh, all centralized exchanges are bad and evil and we don't need any of them ever and I hate them. And the reality is there are some good actors in the centralized exchange space and I think the vast majority of bad actors have actually been washed out at this point. So the ones that survive. And there might be still some bad eggs in the bunch, but the ones that have survived are largely the ones that have done things right and have begun with a long term perspective. So I think that's important context to this. But I think it'll be a long time before we trust centralized CIFI lending providers again.
01:00:28.838 - 01:00:57.706, Speaker A: I mean, Celsius, BlockFi, Voyager, even Terra Luna to some extent. I know they had the anchor protocol, just these yields coming from nowhere. It'll be a long time till we trust those things again and I think that's a good thing. So this means more in the DFI space. There's also David, we've got a lot of things to just tie off from 2022. So FTX is not completely resolved. That's in bankruptcy court.
01:00:57.706 - 01:01:12.978, Speaker A: So is Celsius digital currency group, remember, is like we ended last year and that's the last domino to fall. It's still kind of wobbling. It's in this space of it hasn't quite fallen over yet and it's still like up ish and something's going to happen.
01:01:13.064 - 01:01:15.006, Speaker B: The Leaning Tower of DCG.
01:01:15.118 - 01:01:52.142, Speaker A: Yeah, I just want that thing to be over. Even this morning there was a kind of Winkle Voss twins tweeting at Barry Silbert and calling for DCG, the parent company of Genesis, to exit Barry Silbert. It said that he was unfit, I think was the letter from the Winkle Vosses at Gemini. And so $900 million of retail funds stuck in Genesis doesn't feel good. So that all has to sort itself out too. I don't know what's your take on the exchange world in 2023?
01:01:52.276 - 01:02:34.234, Speaker B: I've got two CFI takes. One is that 2023 is going to be dominated by the court proceedings from washed out actors, right? We got FTX, we got 3 hours capital, we got Celsius, we're perhaps about to have DCG. So what is the bankless weekly roll up going to be? There's probably going to be a section in every single weekly roll up that's like here is the most recent update on bankruptcy. Bankruptcy update. That's going to be a huge CFI theme of 2023, which is just hooray. That's awesome. And I don't mean that in a serious way, that's lame, but that's just going to be the way that it is because people have money in Gemini earn, people have money in Celsius.
01:02:34.234 - 01:03:22.662, Speaker B: So these updates are actually important and they're kind of going to define the centralized crypto industry moving forward. My other update is that B and C tier centralized exchanges are going to struggle and be kind of severely tested and I think we're seeing that play out with Huobi, who I would call A, B or C tier centralized exchange. And so I think the call to action is having centralized exchanges are going to be a part of the crypto world now and for forever. They're going to be around, we have to accept it. If we are going to use centralized exchanges, probably should be using a tier, centralized exchanges, not B or C tier. So if you are still having your money on a C tier, centralized exchange in this day and age in crypto, don't I don't use an A tier. Clearly you're using a centralized exchange.
01:03:22.662 - 01:03:33.614, Speaker B: If you're going to continue to do that, use an A tier one like, don't be on the long tail of risk because that is a bad spot to be in a bear market, or even any market for that matter.
01:03:33.812 - 01:04:01.258, Speaker A: It's hard on centralized exchanges because we don't know everything about all of them. The way I feel right now at this point is if someone were to ping me on Telegram and just be like, hey, what centralized exchanges do you recommend? Do you trust? Kraken? Would be top of the list. And not because they're sponsors. We picked them as sponsors because they were on the top of our list. Coinbase as well, would be on the top of the list. Take a big deep breath from there.
01:04:01.424 - 01:04:02.410, Speaker B: I don't really know.
01:04:02.480 - 01:04:07.820, Speaker A: After just binance, I hope. I think. I don't know, though.
01:04:08.510 - 01:04:14.030, Speaker B: I would bet my money that binance would be okay, but it would be a gamble.
01:04:14.770 - 01:04:25.854, Speaker A: I feel that way. And again, it could totally not be. But that's part of the challenge with centralized exchanges is you don't know for sure. And that's why proof of reserves is so important.
01:04:26.052 - 01:04:32.178, Speaker B: All right, that's another big theme I think will be throughout 2023, is proof of reserves is going to get better.
01:04:32.264 - 01:04:42.374, Speaker A: Where regulators should demand this if they want to do something helpful, just help demand proof of reserves and audits on liabilities. Yes, just raise the bar there. Thank you.
01:04:42.412 - 01:04:44.342, Speaker B: We'd appreciate so simple. It's so simple.
01:04:44.396 - 01:04:52.534, Speaker A: It's so freaking simple. Clarity for security. What's a security? And then just proof of reserves, please. Okay, what else we got? David?
01:04:52.582 - 01:05:35.538, Speaker B: All right, now moving into the regulatory conversation, regulators. Speaking of regulators, here's our favorite guy. Oh, hey, what's up, Gary? So this was an article written by Mike Selig, who I had on for a conversation, and he wrote this, 2023, the year of regulation versus decentralization. And he's basically saying that the world of regulation is going to push and squeeze crypto. And as a result of that squeezing, crypto will become more decentralized. Now, I remember being very into these conversations that almost felt exactly the same. Ryan back in 2018, 2019, it's like, all right, ICOs just tainted the industry.
01:05:35.538 - 01:06:26.646, Speaker B: The regulators are totally coming. What's going to happen is what happened. Wrist slaps. Well, some more than risk lapse, but the ICO industry, the ICO, it was an industry for a while, did grind to a halt, probably under its own wake, but also because everyone realized they were issuing an unregistered security. And so this is where people actually started to step back from their own projects and become more, quote unquote decentralized. And so this is the opinion of Mike Selig, and I totally agree with him, is that in this year the CFTC and the SEC are going to push the boundaries of their current existing authorities through novel enforcement actions and that as a result are going to force crypto to become more decentralized in response to that, which is good. That's a good thing.
01:06:26.646 - 01:06:31.066, Speaker B: Even though it's going to be rough, it's still a net positive outcome for me.
01:06:31.088 - 01:06:43.726, Speaker A: The jury is still out on whether it's net positive or not, but I will give the benefit TOAC sanctions for tiny cash. Have been one of the best things.
01:06:43.828 - 01:06:48.238, Speaker B: To ever happen to Ethereum from a decentralization standpoint. Sure, yeah.
01:06:48.324 - 01:07:40.686, Speaker A: And sorry I said that probably a little too hyperbolically. There have been a lot of great things to happen for Ethereum, but I just mean one of the things that seemed bad and very oppressive that has quickly turned into, I think, a victory for Ethereum, which is it's forced the Ethereum community to really focus on what censorship resistance means at the protocol layer for block builders. And as a result, I think we said this in our earlier predictions, mev censored blocks or blocks with censorship have probably peaked if you have that chart up. But I think you and I both believe that and there are a lot of censorship solutions, like on their way. Yeah, David's going to pull up OFAC censorship. Oh, you don't have the chart, but yeah.
01:07:40.708 - 01:07:42.382, Speaker B: What is that website? I can't remember. What that website?
01:07:42.436 - 01:07:44.660, Speaker A: I can't remember either. It's me v something.
01:07:45.030 - 01:07:46.258, Speaker B: Mev Watch.
01:07:46.424 - 01:07:56.846, Speaker A: Yeah, it might be mev. Watch. Let's try that. Mevwatch not. Oh God, this is something else. This looks cool though. This looks like dune dashboards chat.
01:07:56.878 - 01:07:58.020, Speaker B: Will you help us out?
01:07:58.730 - 01:08:24.186, Speaker A: Doesn't matter. But anyway, that's an example of the thesis that this CoinDesk opinion piece is kind of playing out in that way. Yeah, this is it. Mev Watch. It was for people that are listening WW dot mevwatch info. And this, I think, will go down over time. I think this has peaked and we're going to get some not OFAC compliant blocks.
01:08:24.186 - 01:08:34.174, Speaker A: And anyway, the Ethereum community has been educated on it and has successfully defended against it. And yeah, I think it's going to be an improvement moving forward. So that's an example.
01:08:34.372 - 01:09:21.534, Speaker B: And one thing I want to point people to is I asked Mike what is the case to watch? What are cases to watch? And Ukidao is the Dao that is being charged by the CFTC. It was going after a Dao, but then a court ruled that CFTC should actually just serve the two founders, the two founders of Okie Dow. And so really this court case really means is like, okay, what does this mean? If a Dao violates CFTC regulation, what happens as a result of that? And this case is still ongoing, but because can't really charge a Dao, they are instead going after the two founders of the Dao who have a bunch of the governance tokens how this court case falls, however this lands, is going to be important for other DAOs and.
01:09:21.572 - 01:09:31.838, Speaker A: Other founders of I hope this lands the right way. This could go very bad, in my opinion. I don't know what Mike thinks about that if you talked about that on the episode, but I'm worried about this case, David.
01:09:31.934 - 01:10:14.926, Speaker B: Yeah, but the take that we talked about is decentralization theater versus actual meaningful decentralization. And that was the point that he really wanted to hammer home on. It's just like, well, if you have two founders and they just make a dow, like, well, no, you need real decentralization, not fake decentralization. And so I know in this crypto space, we want to protect our DAOs, but we also want to protect our DAOs against grifters who are not appropriately using DAOs in the appropriate sense. And if that's what the CFTC comes and charges these two people with, it's like, no, your Dao's not a real Dao. You two are just hiding behind a Dao mask. We have to accept that as a crypto industry, I think, fingers crossed, we'll.
01:10:14.958 - 01:10:29.542, Speaker A: See the trust isn't there yet between these two groups. So hopefully with some mutual education that regulators and crypto natives can find good solutions and we get sensible regulation. All right.
01:10:29.676 - 01:10:56.174, Speaker B: Ready for bankless. We got two things left. We got what Bankless has in store for 2023 and then also what David and Ryan are thematically bullish on for 2023. But we got some stuff planned in the Bankless World. And so I put out a tweet not too long ago that the best prediction to make about 2023 is one that you're in control of. And so I'm bullish on Bankless going into 2023. Ryan, you want me to keep on elaborating? You want to take this?
01:10:56.292 - 01:11:27.638, Speaker A: Yeah, no, you could talk about it, but maybe I'll tee you up for it. We're launching a new website, guys, for Bankless members, citizens of the Bankless Nation. That is going to be absolutely fantastic. There's a cut of the beta right now in our inboxes, David, that we have to go test you and I hope we can find some time to do that. And then we're going to open this beta to members of the Bankless community and hopefully this comes out pretty soon. Do you want to say more about that?
01:11:27.724 - 01:12:34.378, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, we have a chad designer and a chad website guy and they are doing absolutely just moving mountains to make a brand new Bankless website. And I really think it's a website that I think the crypto industry really deserves. It is a place that hosts much more than just these podcasts and newsletters and articles that we're writing, but it's a hub of all raw educational resources. If you are paying attention to the Bankless World, you've noticed us producing these super refined, very short videos that are on a different YouTube channel, which we'll link in the show notes which you should subscribe to. But we're also doing stuff like I'm working on videos like what is decentralization, what is a blockchain, like stuff like this. And so I'm hoping that we can make this the best, unequivocally, the best place to send crypto curious people and that is just going to be the universal hub for people who are just starting their bankless journey. People who are very deep down the rabbit hole at 304 hundred level content and like everything in between.
01:12:34.378 - 01:12:41.182, Speaker B: And so that's what I'm bullish on is that it becomes the best hub to send somebody who's new into crypto, who's wanting to get into it.
01:12:41.316 - 01:13:01.698, Speaker A: We call this the Bankless Nation all of the time because that's the metaphor, the analogy that we're using for Bankless. And I know you know this David, but Bankless, the nation is actually larger in population size than about 40 other established United Nations recognized countries.
01:13:01.794 - 01:13:02.680, Speaker B: There you go.
01:13:03.610 - 01:13:32.560, Speaker A: Talk about Bellagi's network state idea. That's what we're slowly moving towards, right? With incremental progress. So population quarter of a million. Now how do we get to population a million? How do we get to population 5 million? How do we get to population 10 million? That's what we're aimed at with Bankless and what we're trying to do here. Another piece that's coming down the pipeline is an NFT project.
01:13:34.450 - 01:13:36.234, Speaker B: Have we mentioned that on the podcast yet?
01:13:36.292 - 01:14:18.270, Speaker A: I don't know, but I'm not going to mention any more detail than that because there'll be some things that we want to showcase. But think of this as kind of the idea of a bankless passport. What would that mean? Instantiated in NFT form. That's what we're working on. And again, the idea of the network state I think is burned into our also, you guys remember last quarter we brought on Dawson Botsford as our CTO from a fantastic tool that we just love using called Earnify. And so Bankless Labs is where that lives. We're going to double down on our efforts to produce tools for the Bankless Nation as well.
01:14:18.270 - 01:15:03.162, Speaker A: Starting with Earnify which is an AirDrop finder, has helped find people $150,000,000 in opportunities or talk about net good, public good for crypto natives and crypto travelers. That's what we're trying to do. And then of course you and I, David, I think we've dedicated 2023 to kind of get back to some of the core basics. 2022 was such a frenetic busy year. We're all over the place just trying to keep up with various things. Now we have a chance to kind of breathe and get back to some of the basics content, bringing it from the archive, freshening it up and talking about it in new terms. So we're going to revisit some of the OG educational theses that we've had from Bankless from day one.
01:15:03.162 - 01:15:17.442, Speaker A: So I think it's going to be a tremendously bullish year for what we're doing in the Bankless movement. And I'm super excited about that. Not to mention everything that the Bankless Dow is pulling off, which I just can't even keep up with. It's so much going on over there.
01:15:17.496 - 01:15:45.770, Speaker B: Yeah. It's hard to give transparency to what's going on in the back end just because we have this discord server. We have the Bankless team in there. The bankless team is large and I don't think many people realize how much hiring we've done in the last, like, two quarters or so. We have like 17 people that show up to the Monday meetings. What are they all doing? Stuff we am super stoked to be able to present to you guys soon. TM.
01:15:45.770 - 01:16:05.466, Speaker B: We've gone from something like seven or eight people at the start of 2022 to where we are now with something like 17 people going into 2023. And everyone's just been heads down working. And I think a lot of that stuff is going to come to fruition pretty damn soon here. Ryan's already teased out a little bit, but, yeah, I'm pretty bullish.
01:16:05.498 - 01:16:19.190, Speaker A: You don't have to be sorry for Bankless ever, David. All right, what are you bullish on, though? Tell me if you had to pick one thing in crypto for 2023, one theme that you're most excited about most bullish on? Yeah. What's one theme that you'd point to?
01:16:19.340 - 01:17:31.446, Speaker B: I want to point in everyone to the concept of and project sign in with Ethereum. This is something that technically doesn't have a price tag associated with it, but it is still something I'm bullish on. And it's something that I think is also going to be very, very helpful with putting ethereum on the map when it comes to mainstream adoption. Because this is something that I think everyone can really get behind, which is like, sign in with Facebook, sign in with Google, sign in with your web two overlord, or sign in with your private keys, which you minted yourself and you control and you operate your own identity. And I think especially as society is getting more and more fed up with the web two world, I think the sign in with ethereum movement, which is we are just at the very, very tip of the iceberg on this thing is going to see a lot of mainstream adoption because people or Ryan are getting exposed to NFTs via Instagram, NFTs via Twitter, and NFTs via Reddit. So, like parts and corners of the web two internet big corners like Instagram, that's not a tiny little corner. They're already getting exposed to Ethereum.
01:17:31.446 - 01:17:44.800, Speaker B: And so we're finding and also being able to log into a website without having to email and password and other identities, I think is going to be a big catalyst for just people accepting Ethereum into their lives.
01:17:46.370 - 01:18:00.022, Speaker A: Honestly, it solves a massive problem here. And I'm going to plus one your bullcase for sign in with Ethereum. Actually, there's a vitalik tweet too. Turns out he's also bullish on sign in with Ethereum. What's this tweet that we're looking at?
01:18:00.076 - 01:18:28.058, Speaker B: Yeah, so this is Matt Huang from Paradigm, who's asking Vitalik, what is his definition of a good crypto future? And Vitalik just gives a know fixed scaling, fixed privacy, fixed UX. Of course. User accounts more secure for average users than centralized services. That might be a nod to account abstraction, payments and store value. Plus the DeFi provide value to many people. That sounds like banking. The unbanked crypto social takes off, and then identity plus sign in with Ethereum succeed.
01:18:28.058 - 01:19:30.414, Speaker B: And the cool thing is, sign in with Ethereum isn't just you have a private key and you authenticate your identity to a website via signing with your private key. It starts there. And that's already a huge order of improvement in terms of user privacy and user sovereignty on the Internet. But as identity layers and identity tooling and whatever it means to create identity, which is already a nebulous definition, as that becomes greater, signing in with Ethereum becomes more useful. As there's a higher fidelity relationship between your Ethereum address and your identity because of the PO apps you collected or the attestations that you have or the things that you have done that your website that you're logging into is interested in, your Ethereum address can represent more and more about you that you control, that you have total access over. And so it's kind of like when DeFi grows, Ether becomes more useful. As Ethereum identity grows, sign in with Ethereum also becomes more useful.
01:19:30.414 - 01:19:32.802, Speaker B: And so that is something to be bullish on.
01:19:32.936 - 01:20:01.518, Speaker A: Yeah. Imagine kind of the narrative coming out of this. An Ethereum address gives you a way to sign into any application across the Internet in a decentralized way. Right. And ETH is kind of an investment in a global identity management system. I even think some of these narratives, if they come to fruition, can turn into, like, bullcases that we don't really talk about. We talk about ETH as money, but what about ETH as identity? That's a super interesting thing to think about.
01:20:01.518 - 01:20:48.026, Speaker A: But the reality is identity is broken, isn't it? In web two, it's broken. Just like the Twitter bot problem. Wow. It's a failure of identity or identity systems. And it's even like we're talking about wins for mainstream people who aren't into kind of the money number go up type use cases. Well, identity is also a national security problem. How do I know what's a Russian bot or an evil nation state actor that's trying to kind of prey upon my population if I don't have proof of identity, if I don't have proof of humanity? And I'm just thinking about how utterly lacking nation state identities actually are for this.
01:20:48.048 - 01:20:49.050, Speaker B: Pretty embarrassing. Yeah.
01:20:49.120 - 01:21:18.886, Speaker A: No, I know. We were just talking about this in one of our debriefs for an episode we just did, which is I recently opened up some exchange accounts and used a selfie. Of course, this is how you validate. You are who you say you are. Authenticate it. And it was a selfie of myself and then my driver's license. Basically three JPEGs, right? A JPEG of me in a selfie, a JPEG of the front of my driver's license, a JPEG in the back.
01:21:18.886 - 01:21:42.314, Speaker A: And they live on my computer somewhere. Why? Because I do this so often. All someone has to have is those three JPEGs and then they know my Social Security number, which is publicly available, basically, and they know my birthday, and then they can authenticate themselves in a banking application. That is your state of the art security nation. State security sucks right now.
01:21:42.352 - 01:21:43.386, Speaker B: That's pretty bad.
01:21:43.568 - 01:22:09.430, Speaker A: And for this to be a solution to that, well, just sign in. You have a private key. Private keys really are a superpower for the 21st century. And unleashing that for identity is kind of a really bullish use case. I don't know if all of this happens in 2023, though, David. I feel like 2023 will just be the start of that at some level and it'll take a few years for that to fully play out. But I'm also bullish on this.
01:22:09.500 - 01:22:19.350, Speaker B: Well, we are recording with the sign in with Ethereum team tomorrow and so we are going to turn this theory into a full length podcast so we'll have more material on that soon.
01:22:19.500 - 01:22:32.266, Speaker A: There you go, guys. Well, that has been ten predictions for 2023. We're excited about going into this year. I'll end with our typical risks and disclaimers, of course. Got to let you know that all of crypto is risky. So is ETH. So is bitcoin.
01:22:32.266 - 01:22:40.220, Speaker A: You could definitely lose what you put in. But we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
