00:00:07.370 - 00:00:28.690, Speaker A: Welcome to State of the Nation. David and I are super excited to have you tuned in to this special episode where we are talking to the founders of three Arrows Capital, a fantastic, very large investment firm. We're talking about their rotation into ether asset of it. They're pretty bullish, man. What's your take on this episode?
00:00:28.850 - 00:00:58.122, Speaker B: It's always funny when we bring on guests who haven't historically been Eth Maxis, and then they come on and they're more bullish than us. Like, both of us put together. Yeah, that's exactly what happened. Suzu and Kyle Davies of three Arrows capital. They are famous for generally just getting things right, having incredible reads on so many different things all at once on chain metrics, mainstream media and narratives, crypto, Twitter.
00:00:58.186 - 00:01:06.306, Speaker A: Look, man, they make the trade you wish you made, but they do it six months in advance, like, almost consistently every time, is how I think about them.
00:01:06.408 - 00:01:48.942, Speaker B: Yeah. Let it be known, traders can be successful. And these guys have been one of the most successful trading firms, perhaps in crypto history, period. Question mark? I don't actually know, but it definitely feels like that. And so they have a lot of prowess, a lot of clout, and so people definitely pay attention to what three arrows capital is doing. And recently, they have gotten very loud about their ether rotation. There was a very big podcast that went around on uncommon core with Kobe, a multi cycler crypto trader, and Su Zu, who's one of the two guests, one of the two founders of 3 hours capital, about the flippinning, right.
00:01:48.942 - 00:02:42.586, Speaker B: Ether flippining, bitcoin, and the ether trade. And just the magnitude of both Kobe and Sue Zhu publicly talking about their conviction about the ETH flipping was a big deal in of itself. And so we got Kyle and Sue, which is actually the first time they've actually ever been on a podcast together. We got them both on to talk and go into more detail about this ether rotation, this massive just price run up of ether. We are at six green weekly candles on the ether US dollar chart and the ether bitcoin chart. Ether just painted a $1,000 ether weekly candle last week when its previous 2017 all time high was $1,440. So painting a $1,000 weekly candle is absolutely insane.
00:02:42.586 - 00:02:56.590, Speaker B: And I asked sue, like, sue, let's try and measure the magnitude of this move. And I asked him, do you think this is the biggest event in Crypto's history? And he said, yes. And that's bullish.
00:02:56.750 - 00:03:27.422, Speaker A: That's pretty much how the podcast went. A lot of that back and forth, a lot of bullishness, guys. We usually do state of the nation live recorded. We weren't able to do that this week just because of time zone conflicts. So this is pre recorded and playing to you right now, but this is just a fantastic episode about the ETH trade, a trade that I think is the one to make if you don't have enough exposure to ETh right now. And certainly the three arrow capitals folks do as well. Just a few other things before we get in.
00:03:27.422 - 00:04:07.926, Speaker A: What's new in the nation, in the bankless nation this week, we just dropped a fantastic episode with Vitalik on legitimacy. Guys, I can't say enough about Vitalik, of course, but this episode specifically, if you don't understand legitimacy, you don't understand Crypto. That's what I walked away from that episode with. It's kind of the theory of everything. It answers many of Crypto's frequently asked questions, and I think you need to wrap your mind around the episode. Vitalik was just brilliant at laying out the case for what legitimacy is and why it's so important in crypto. David, any other reflections on that episode?
00:04:08.118 - 00:04:08.426, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:04:08.448 - 00:05:16.330, Speaker B: I frequently say that the crypto vantage point over just the world at large, not just the financial world, the macro world, but almost the whole entire world. The perspective and the position of viewing the world that crypto gives you is really advantageous, and I don't think you can get that in any other industry. And that's really well embodied by this particular episode with Vitalik, where we just answer some very fundamental questions, not about Crypto, but about the universe, the whole goddamn thing. And it just happens to apply extremely well to crypto and answer some of Crypto's, like you said, the most frequently asked questions, and a composed theory of everything which is embodied by legitimacy, I think, really does a good job helping people understand why things are what they are in crypto. And I think the fastest way I could explain this podcast and how it relates to crypto specifically is that crypto doesn't have any real world assets. Ether, bitcoin, they're all virtual. And the reason why these things are valuable while still not being real, or at least tangible, is because of legitimacy.
00:05:16.330 - 00:05:24.946, Speaker B: And so that's why Ryan says, if you don't understand legitimacy, you don't understand crypto. So if you listen to bankless, you basically have to listen to this episode. Yeah, you have to.
00:05:24.968 - 00:05:48.294, Speaker A: There's no other choice, guys. Also, one last opportunity we want to share with you. Our friends at Upshot are running a beta promotion for bankless. Badge holders upshot, of course, they are becoming the zillow of NFT pricing. So you know how Zillow has a zestimate so you can see the price of your NFT. They have that as well. And they've opened the beta to bankless listeners.
00:05:48.294 - 00:06:14.830, Speaker A: You could basically do like a hot or not. Which nft do you like better? Which NFT is worth more? And you earn directly from the upshot protocol, from your appraisal. That's what you're doing. You're saying this NFT is better than that one, and you're earning USDC and upshot tokens as well. So make sure you check out what upshot is running. You can go to app upshot IO. There's also a link in the show notes.
00:06:14.830 - 00:06:17.490, Speaker A: David, you ready to get into this episode, man?
00:06:17.640 - 00:06:18.340, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:06:18.810 - 00:06:20.486, Speaker A: Oh, before we do, I gotta ask.
00:06:20.508 - 00:06:22.198, Speaker C: You the question I ask every week.
00:06:22.364 - 00:06:24.022, Speaker A: What is the state of the nation today?
00:06:24.076 - 00:07:05.214, Speaker B: Sir, the state of the nation is rebalancing. All of the crypto world seems to be rebalancing. There seems to be just a massive inflow into ether, and I think that also comes from outside of crypto. And so there are some institutions that I would not yet consider part of the bankless nation, but they are rebalancing into ether and therefore rebalancing into the bankless nation all the same. Meanwhile, we have longtime bitcoiners rebalancing into ether. Generally, people are. This massive trade, this massive move into ether that people are making is really people who were perpetually underway ether and just did not have a measured amount of ether exposure.
00:07:05.214 - 00:07:34.602, Speaker B: And they are now rebalancing their portfolio into ether. If you've been in Ethereum since I got into 2017, Ryan, you got in, I think, into the world of crypto in 2016. If you've been paying attention to Ethereum, you have been waiting for this moment. And the fact that it's actually here kind of feels like a unicorn. But regardless, it's here. The unicorn exists, and people are rebalancing into ether.
00:07:34.746 - 00:07:55.342, Speaker A: Now all you have to do is ride that unicorn, right? David, rebalancing is the theme for today. David, remind me to tell you this story. I actually got my first dm from a bitcoin maximalist. That said, actually, I have changed my mind on Ether. I'll have to share that story with you. Maybe we'll share it on the weekly roll ups. But anyway, stay tuned.
00:07:55.406 - 00:08:01.510, Speaker B: Well, for what it's worth, Suzu shared similar stories on this episode. So there's more where that came from.
00:08:01.580 - 00:08:14.170, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know how rare that's going to be, but my first one ever, so sort of exciting. Stay tuned for this fantastic episode. We're going to dive right in. But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this bankless episode possible.
00:08:14.320 - 00:08:49.986, Speaker B: Bankless is proud to be supported by Uniswap. Uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure. Instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans, Uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on Ethereum, which is what Ryan and I call a money robot. No human counterparties or centralized intermediaries, just autonomous code on Ethereum. Input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy. Something brand new in the Uniswap ecosystem is the Uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants. We have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again.
00:08:49.986 - 00:09:18.062, Speaker B: Daos have money and they are in need of labor. If you think that you have something to contribute to the Uniswap Dow, apply for a grant to Uniswap. Just look at the size of the Uniswap treasury. It's almost $3 billion. This mountain of capital is looking for labor. Do you have something of value to contribute to the Uniswap Dow? No matter how big or small your idea is, you can apply for a uni grant@unigrant.org and help steer uniswap in the direction that you think it should go.
00:09:18.062 - 00:10:00.454, Speaker B: That's exactly what we did to get Uniswap to be a sponsor for bankless, and you can do the same for your project. Thank you Uniswap, for sponsoring bankless synthetix is Ethereum's decentralized derivatives liquidity protocol. What does that mean? Synthetix is a platform for creating and trading synthetic assets, which are assets that are priced via an oracle. Rather than bids or asks, traders can use the quinta exchange, which hosts and trades all of the synthetic assets created by synthetix. Traders on quenta can trade synthetic tokens like SBTC s Oil or SDFI. Because quenta is powered by synthetix, traders experience zero slippage on their trades. No, I didn't mean low slippage.
00:10:00.454 - 00:10:31.890, Speaker B: I meant no slippage because that is the power of the synthetix platform. No slippage on your trades. You can also easily short assets with ISy, which are synthetic assets that move inversely to their target asset. Synthetics isn't just for traders. Developers can build on synthetix to access the infinite liquidity offered by synthetic assets. Or investors can stake collateral to the protocol and earn fees that the protocol collects. If you're a trader and you're looking for a trading platform not found in the legacy world, check out quenta IO.
00:10:31.890 - 00:10:43.590, Speaker B: If you're a developer or you just want to earn yield on your collateral, go to wWW synthetics IO, where you can stake your SNX or ETH and earn fees from synthetics.
00:10:45.150 - 00:11:03.040, Speaker A: Bankless nation. We are super excited about our next guest. We have Suzu and Kyle Davies. They are legendary crypto traders, founders of the legendary crypto Fund, three arrows capital. We are talking today all about their ETH trade. Guys, someone said you were bullish on ETH. Is that true?
00:11:04.690 - 00:11:07.490, Speaker C: It's definitely true. Definitely not untrue.
00:11:08.710 - 00:11:19.800, Speaker A: Well, welcome to bankless. We are excited to dive into this. This is going to be a really exciting episode. I've heard, actually, this is the first podcast episode that the two of you are doing together. Is that right?
00:11:20.570 - 00:11:21.846, Speaker C: Oh, so true.
00:11:22.028 - 00:11:47.214, Speaker A: Wow. First time. All right, well, this is know before we dig in, and I think the context for this episode is all about the Eth trade that you guys have been talking about. But David and I want to get a sense of how you guys think about crypto. So the bankless platform is, like, I would say, almost notoriously long time horizon, right? So it's like buy and hold. Here are the crypto money assets. Defi is going to be big.
00:11:47.214 - 00:12:04.850, Speaker A: Buy and hold. We place a lot less emphasis on the trading side of things. But you guys are traders. Can you talk about how that's different and how you approach crypto from a trading perspective, how that's different from maybe narrative investing? Long term buy and hold. We'll start with you, sue.
00:12:05.750 - 00:13:02.760, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it is actually similar in a lot of ways, probably more similar than it is dissimilar. I guess one bigger difference would be sort of reflexivity and seeing when certain ideas or certain narratives are sort of best positioned to take shape. So a good example is, like, if you're denominated in ETH, but it's late 2017 or early 2018, even if you believe in it, you may think also that icos just have millions of ETH that they don't really know what to do with and they need to pay people with. So that kind of may make someone who's a long term believer in ETH think still that they have to first go into stablecoins for a while and then buy the bottom or buy when it's been flushed out. So I think just like being aware, despite the long term view or the midterm view, what the short term actors are most likely going to do. Sort of just thinking about those kind of flows is something that I guess, keeps us apart, I guess.
00:13:03.610 - 00:13:05.320, Speaker A: Kyle, what would you say to that?
00:13:06.730 - 00:13:51.826, Speaker D: Yeah, I would say we're much more similar in your mentality here, in the sense that for the better part of two years, we've been long, right. So maybe 95% of the time, we've been pretty close to almost a full allocation long. It's just a question of what we denominate in and what the composition of our book looks like. So just so happens right now that we're extremely overweight eth, but it's not like we've been long. Crypto, like, all the way through. Right. That's actually, I think, something that really sets apart three arrows from a lot of other trading firms or market makers.
00:13:51.826 - 00:14:10.682, Speaker D: Long only funds. They're long only for sure, but for individuals or trading firms, people that don't necessarily have to be long and have to make a decision, we made that decision. We made the decision that we do take a core long belief in crypto as a whole.
00:14:10.816 - 00:14:38.950, Speaker A: So when you're going long, it sounds like there's, like, almost two layers to your strategy, right? So you have sort of the long strategy where you've got these fundamental assets that you denominate in. Maybe that changes, too. Sometimes that's bitcoin, sometimes that's eth, but it's always crypto. And then you have, like, trade optimizations at the second layer. As sue was saying, when a narrative's time is right or when an asset time is right, you flip into those trading positions to optimize. Is that a good way to think about it, Kyle?
00:14:39.450 - 00:15:20.740, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that's reasonable. And part of think we, like, we're involved in the funding trade, so spot versus futures, looking at that basis, we're involved in primary investment across a number of different other projects as well. And so we have a reasonable pulse on what we think is going to be big when and if the market gets a little overheated. And I think that's why we're not just blindly long a single particular asset for a long period of time. We're rather saying the book is long. But now, how do you want to denominate, and how do you want this composition to look like?
00:15:21.910 - 00:16:15.650, Speaker B: I do see a lot of resonance with, at least with my mental models and maybe some of the things that we say on bankless where we talk about maximize your exposure to the crypto monies, and that's what we call basically bitcoin and ETH, and then also speculate in the app layer. And that app layer could also be not actually applications, but also applications, but also perhaps just seed investments into actual companies and teams. Sue, you mentioned that when we were talking about 2018 2019, you were talking about all these icos that had all this east and didn't know what to do with it. And you integrated that into perhaps your model about the markets and your trade, generally speaking. More generally, what signals or indicators do you guys really pay attention to? What sources of information do you really consistently look at to inform your trades?
00:16:16.630 - 00:17:00.420, Speaker C: That's a really tough question because it honestly depends. I mean, we try to be as intuitive as possible, actually, and it's kind of as macro as possible. So I think with some smaller trades, it can be more finessed or been more quantitative. But with bitcoin or ether allocation or bitcoin dominance, it's really the whole, I think, environment that we're in right now. So I think that we're in a backdrop where bitcoin has three x off its previous all time high, 20 to. It's running into a lot of resistance, a lot of people selling at the three x all time high. And this is in a backdrop where Ether has had probably its strongest tokenomics upgrades as a base money that it's ever had in its history.
00:17:00.420 - 00:17:49.362, Speaker C: And also in a backdrop where across many retail onramps and also just emerging market on ramps, ETH is already outpacing bitcoin as people's first buy. In fact, Doge is actually outpacing bitcoin in some of these onramps as well. So this environment is incredibly bearish for bitcoin dominance. And also it's an environment where now, after the flush out in ETH, and I would argue that there's been basically three flushouts from 2018 to now, three distinct waves of flush outs. There's pretty much no one that has eth that doesn't know why they have it. Everyone who has ETH now, they really put in a proof of work to have that ETh, right? Because you could have lost in so many ways, you could have sold it all to dollars at the bottom or near the bottom. You could have sold it all to bitcoin during the bear market.
00:17:49.362 - 00:18:24.766, Speaker C: You could have sold it all to even to applications. Right? ETH has outpaced a lot of applications by a massive margin now as well. So I kind of see that as sort of a massive scarcity play. Now that's happening, where ETH is scarce versus not just against fiat, but also scarce against the bitcoin, the very overweight bitcoin people. But then also even within Ethereum itself, a lot of eTH people don't have enough eTH because they either thought it was frothy when layer ones were pumping and they sold to dollars. A lot of people did that, actually. Shockingly, that I found out that whole environment is just very conducive to ETH now.
00:18:24.766 - 00:18:26.430, Speaker C: And you're kind of seeing that squeeze.
00:18:27.410 - 00:19:08.380, Speaker B: The articulation as to everyone who's holding ETH can articulate why they are holding ETH is not something that I thought about. That's a pretty cool perspective. Kyle, the last time you and I talked was actually in November of 2020. And we were talking about on my other podcast, Pov crypto pod, about how 3 hours capital was rotating heavily into bitcoin and really maximizing its bitcoin exposure while reducing its DFI and Ethereum exposure. And this was coming right after DFI summer, right? DFI summer was definitely cooling off, and that was the right move. Bitcoin was ten k at the time, and then just three or four months later, it was then fifty k.
00:19:11.390 - 00:19:11.658, Speaker C: I.
00:19:11.664 - 00:19:35.460, Speaker B: Want kind of start our conversation there. Where we left off in November, you guys were overweight BTC and underweight ETH, DeFi, that trade worked when you rebalanced your portfolio. Next. After that. After that trade worked, what did you rebalance your portfolio into? And was that the ETH trade that you guys find yourselves in today, or was there a middle trade between now and then?
00:19:37.530 - 00:20:17.694, Speaker D: So the first thing I should say is for application layer, for DeFi, it's a completely distinct group. It's defiance capital. They have their own capital allocation and they work with teams and they're long only. So for us, if we believe there is going to be a cooling off of alts or DeFi or whatever it may be, we're not selling very much. We have to head to something else. So that's a lot where we actually had a short on ETH, but the short was not a naked short. It was a short against a large portfolio of applications.
00:20:17.694 - 00:20:51.310, Speaker D: Right. With the thought being that we still want to win deal flow, we still want to work with teams, we still want to be long term invested in applications. So this made sense. And dominance ran all the way up to 73%. I was calling for 75. I think we got almost all the way there. And then I think the next big portfolio allocation was leading into the Coinbase IPO.
00:20:51.310 - 00:21:14.526, Speaker D: About a month before that, we were looking at it thinking this would be extremely bullish, ethereum, basically, for many reasons, but basically this is when we started to think it was time to start moving that allocation around. And then a little bit before we went very overweight.
00:21:14.638 - 00:21:18.440, Speaker B: What was the connection between Coinbase and Ethereum? Can you elaborate on that?
00:21:19.210 - 00:22:13.334, Speaker D: For bitcoin dominance, it takes a certain kind of narrative for bitcoin dominance to work. But part of that is not capital raises, because anytime there's a capital raise, people have to make a decision. And anytime there's, for example, anytime there's applications working, people have to make a decision. And anytime there's a decision, there's some sort of diversification that happens. And people look at on chain metrics and they look at many different. And yeah, so around a coinbase IPO where they've know it's the largest us exchange with many different assets on it, and a lot of their marketing is around people trading those assets. And, yeah, I think by and large, that was going to be a big Ethereum bull case.
00:22:13.532 - 00:22:15.398, Speaker B: Sue, anything you want to add to that?
00:22:15.564 - 00:22:41.902, Speaker C: Yeah, I think also the Coinbase shareholders, they're very overweight. EtH, I think in general, too, just in terms of both philosophy as well as their own coin holdings, I would suspect in late 2017, I think Brian Armstrong himself said he owns more Ethereum than bitcoin. I think Coinbase, like Kyle mentioned, is very bullish for ETH, because it's sort of their bread and butter almost at this point.
00:22:42.036 - 00:23:06.680, Speaker B: Sue, in August of 2020, you on a podcast again, I also think pov crypto pod, you said that you thought it was unlikely that ETH would ever flip in bitcoin. But recently, on the uncommon Core podcast with Kobe and Hazu, you and all the other guests seemed pretty convicted that Ethereum would flip in bitcoin at some point in time. Do you remember what the catalyst was that changed your mind on this, and when did this happen?
00:23:07.930 - 00:24:04.838, Speaker C: For me, I think it was a number of factors. One is Raul Paul. I think actually it's quite influential in my thinking, just seeing his idea that new high net worth investors coming into the space institutions, they ultimately respect network effect and they respect the size of the network and the utility of the network. And so I think when people start looking at it that way, if that's their framework, and they don't come in assuming a monetary maximalism will take over the space, then I think that if you start putting metrics side by side for each of the networks and each of the coins, then I think Ethereum stacks up very well. And I think there's also something to the idea that people want a productive store value as opposed to a non productive one. I've heard that quite a bit in people I've spoken with where they don't put a whole lot of nonprofit sovs in their portfolio. If you're a pension fund, you don't even put gold in a pension fund, but you do put productive assets like commercial reits, things that earn a yield.
00:24:04.838 - 00:25:04.594, Speaker C: And so a lot of people are really interested in what happens to Ethereum once it has a yield. Now that it has one, people are seeing it. And I think, too, that if you asked me back in August 2020, I would have said that it looks like Sailor is going to be the first. And then there's going to be a lot of other companies that do this putting bitcoin in the treasury, but it's already going into mid Q two, and it's still not that many companies that have done it right. And the kind of price action doesn't appear like there's a lot of treasuries doing it. And so once you see this kind of skepticism toward this, just like everyone's going to hold this in the treasury, then the game is open again and the kind of battle for store value continues. That kind of made me think that if these things are all true, then one, retail already likes Eth more than bitcoin because they resonate more with the Internet of value as opposed to digital gold.
00:25:04.594 - 00:25:22.338, Speaker C: And then two is institutions want to own what other people own. And on top of that, they also like productive sovs. And then thirdly, we've already had a nice bitcoin run, and we've already had sort of an activation of supply above 60k. That kind of really puts the pieces in place, I think, for kind of seeing that.
00:25:22.504 - 00:25:44.620, Speaker B: Kyle, I definitely want to get your opinion on if you think Ethereum is flipping bitcoin. But before we get there, sue, you said that you're seeing just a lot of interest in productive assets over non productive assets, and perhaps positioning a trade based off of that. But what do you personally believe? Do you personally believe in productive assets over non productive assets? Do you have an opinion on such a matter?
00:25:46.190 - 00:26:53.550, Speaker C: I do, but I think it's not as relevant what my opinion on it is at any moment. It's ultimately what people decide, right? If we're in a wartime and there's very low activity, then the bitcoin monetary maximist argument can be the most valid, because then people really do value that slight decentralization edge that bitcoin has over Ethereum, right, as a base money. But if we're in an environment where people are not going to be able to quantify that value very well of how much more bitcoin is decentralized than Ethereum, just like in Ethereum, smart contract space, too. Most people can't quantify the difference between Ethereum's decentralization and Solana or some other chain, then you are going to have a lot of people be quite okay with that. And I think it ultimately depends on what users need crypto for and what people want to use them for. I do think that in a much larger percentage of cases than people right now believe that is going to be a preference for ether.
00:26:53.970 - 00:27:53.570, Speaker A: So, Sue, I think some of the bare case around ether up to this point is part of the case that, yes, people recognize that ether will become a productive asset, stake. It is enabled. But you just mentioned another crypto network called Solana, right? And there's not just Solana, there's Cardano, there's binance, smart chain, all of these things, many of these are staking assets, right? And so all these other layer one assets can become productive assets as well when they're staked. But you made a distinction which I think is important. You called Eth a productive sov asset, which means, of course, listeners will be familiar with store of value asset, which implies some level of monetary premium, right? And bitcoin, of course, quite famously has a fantastic monetary premium. People believe it is a store of value. The bear case for ether up to this point has been, I think that even if ether becomes a productive asset, people won't value it as a store of value.
00:27:53.570 - 00:28:24.640, Speaker A: It will not have a monetary premium. Has all of these competitors, these other layer ones, that can also do the same things it is doing, and it's not bitcoin. Bitcoin is Crypto's reserve asset, has the store of value property. Those use cases won't flow over to ether. I want to ask about that, the store of valueness of ether specifically, and whether you think that is a moat that other layer ones can't overcome and how it has started to achieve this in your mind, can you reflect on that?
00:28:25.570 - 00:29:59.434, Speaker C: Sure. I think, first of all, it's very hard to just come up with a new store value, right? Because it's not just about the tech, it's also about the community and about the coin distribution, about the genie coefficients, about how did people work to get the supply that they have and how do they value it? So I think that in a way it's quite beautiful for Ethereum that it's been done proof of work up to now, because each ether that has entered supply has been costly and that process has made it so that supply has decentralized out. And that is going to be a huge struggle for a lot of proof of stake networks where a fairly smaller number of participants are going to have more of the coins and it's very hard to distribute away. So I think distribution Ethereum has a huge edge, I think also in terms of the competition for smart contract block space, I do think that anytime you have smart contracts actually being deployed on chain and being used, whether that's on Ethereum or another chain, I actually think that's very bullish for Ethereum because it goes against the entire bitcoin not blockchain argument, which is that blockchains are not that useful. The only use case of blockchains is money. Well, it turns out not. And then with interoperability and with sort of bridging of assets across chains, ethereum stands to be in very good shape in an on chain world, because there will be a huge number of participants who do value the highest decentralization for on chain activity and more.
00:29:59.434 - 00:30:31.800, Speaker C: So there will be a lot of developers that build applications for that. So I think it's almost kind of ironic, because I think despite the whole eTH killer narrative, I think these have been actually very good for Ethereum because one, has pushed the application progress very quickly, it's pushed the scaling progress very quickly. And two, I think it's shown the world that there is actually a lot of demand for on chain space like you think about BSC. Right. BSE has shown that if you did have lower fees, then here's what users would actually do if they had.
00:30:33.930 - 00:30:54.880, Speaker A: So our take has been up to this point that there are two crypto assets that are emerging as a store of value, bitcoin and ether, right. And others could emerge as a store of value, but not anytime soon, and probably not this cycle. Does that take overstate what you're saying? Do you think other layer one assets could become a store of value in the future?
00:30:55.570 - 00:31:38.902, Speaker C: I think Doge arguably is starting to look like it could be, because it's got absolutely incredible volumes, right? And it's got absolutely incredible memes as well. So I don't see also very old, also very old and very decentralized. So I don't see any reason why it can't be. And I do think doge is something, too, where it definitely helps ethereum in a way, because it just chips at this idea of bitcoin monetary maximalism. Because bitcoin monetary maximum wants to say, it wants to assert that 21 mil supply cap is the reason why it has any value. It wants to assert that these are all the reasons why it has value. But meanwhile, doge just comes in with no cap and outperforms, and it also kills the narrative that there's no alt that can be up in sats.
00:31:38.902 - 00:32:11.186, Speaker C: Well, actually, you're up actually a massive amount in sats in doge. So just the presence of doge, I think, has been one of the biggest bearish bitcoin dominance cases, because now everyone sees doge and they're like, okay, then I don't have to just denominate in just. I can also just see what's funner, and I can explore all these different assets, I think is also becoming a store value. I mean, it's also very cheap, right? And it's very usable. Granted, not many people are using it, but it does offer a different niche.
00:32:11.298 - 00:32:13.302, Speaker A: But you guys aren't long doge, right?
00:32:13.436 - 00:32:15.602, Speaker C: Where are you? We are not long doge.
00:32:15.666 - 00:32:16.840, Speaker A: Why? What's the difference?
00:32:20.330 - 00:32:57.220, Speaker C: It's something we may belong in the future, but it's definitely an interesting asset that I think caught everyone by surprise as well. Caught up by surprise. But I think it does show the power of memes. Right. And it definitely contributes to ether's meme being more stronger than ever. Because with the ultrasound money meme, now, it gives space for Ethereum to come in and say, well, we are actually even lower inflation, and you get a natural yield from holding the. That kind of contrast is going to be very stark for people when they check out the space.
00:32:57.830 - 00:33:03.458, Speaker B: Kyle, before I ask my next question to you, do you have any reflections on what we've been talking with you recently?
00:33:03.634 - 00:33:39.826, Speaker D: Yeah, the only part I would add is deflationary asset is really going to resonate with a lot of people. I think there's this point where you're bullish Ethereum, the network, and especially you see all the fee that are happening on it, but you ask about the value pool, and it's just a speculation on that. But once you can see that it's a deflationary asset, it's no longer a like, it's actually deflationary. And I think that moves a lot of people the needle for a lot of people.
00:33:39.928 - 00:34:03.420, Speaker A: Kyle, some people are still skeptical that deflationary assets actually going to happen. We are still in a pre implementation world of EIP 15, five nine. And of course, the proof of stake to the proof of work merge has not happened yet. So some people will say, yeah, there's a ton of execution risk in taking the position that you're betting in a deflationary asset. What would you say about that?
00:34:04.750 - 00:34:22.190, Speaker D: Yeah, I definitely believe in discounting execution risk, but that's like what makes a great trade too, right? Or a great investment. So, I mean, if it was fully priced in, I don't know, maybe he could be 15k right now. I don't know where it would be, but by the way, that'd be a very different investment.
00:34:22.770 - 00:34:24.880, Speaker A: Wait, fifteen k is fud too?
00:34:26.390 - 00:34:29.170, Speaker C: If everything is priced right, I think fifteen k is FuD.
00:34:29.590 - 00:34:30.340, Speaker A: Wow.
00:34:33.030 - 00:34:45.480, Speaker B: I do want to get into that specific number, but first I want to ask Kyle. Kyle, sue here was on that podcast with Kobe and Hazu talking about the inevitability of the flipping. Do you agree?
00:34:45.850 - 00:35:18.754, Speaker D: Yeah, I definitely do. I think the closer it gets to it just has to make a run at it. Especially the nice thing about the current state of the Ethereum roadmap too, is there are events happening in two months and seven months out. So even after 1559, there's no sell catalyst. You're still waiting for just the next one, right. And it's within a reasonable time. If it's like years out.
00:35:18.754 - 00:35:41.498, Speaker D: Yeah, there's a little bit different story. Or if there's we're post, like in a post proof of stake world, then now you need to price it and just believe it's going to hit whatever pe ratio or however you're valuing these things. But pre that you can just execution risk if you believe in it and you believe there's less execution risk. Great trade for you.
00:35:41.664 - 00:36:24.838, Speaker B: Yeah, Ethereum seems to have a lot of arrows in its quiver, and we've danced around the subject, around mainstream media and public narrative with this current ether move and overall how you guys position your trades. I kind of want to attack that subject a little bit more directly. So how are you guys weighting mainstream media and its current understanding of this space? The bitcoin trade, the ether trade, everything else trade. But also more specifically, do you guys consider the energy consumption part of perhaps this Ethereum move as of late, or do you guys think perhaps that's not here yet?
00:36:24.924 - 00:37:10.134, Speaker C: I think it's not quite here yet because the merge hasn't happened. So I think you will actually need the merge to happen before the mainstream media will pick up on it because that's just the way media is. So I do think that that will be another great catalyst. I think also it's a big contrast to late last year, right, where FBTC went to zero point 42 on the beacon chain activation and also on DFI somewhere. And that was kind of like a premature move in a way, because that was right, like when bitcoin was about to get sailor is going to buy an absolute monster load of bitcoin. There's a lot of high net worth and corporate buying of bitcoin. It was too early because it was too far away from EIP one five nine.
00:37:10.134 - 00:37:57.634, Speaker C: That was more just an idea at that point that was getting traction. But like how said, now we are in the midst of the media picking up on the fact that Ethereum may become more deflationary than before. And the media is picking up also on the fact that DeFi is not just a small meme anymore. It's not just a niche, it's something massive, right? We have global governments looking at how to deal with Defi and how to encourage it even. And so I think that kind of backdrop, and also Nifty's as well. I think we haven't discussed Nifty's yet, but I think Nifty's is incredibly bullish for either, because now culture is now native to Ethereum. And I think once you get culture as well, that's actually when a lot of people wake up because they say, well, I can bearish on bitcoin as a store value because I think it has no use case.
00:37:57.634 - 00:38:24.270, Speaker C: But I cannot be bearish on culture existing on Ethereum. That's an incoherent position to take. Right? So I think the fact that athletes and artists and musicians are getting very active in the nifty market, that brings incredible cultural prestige to the idea of ethereum as a settlement layer. And that I think is actually incredibly difficult for anyone else to fight against either because that does have a lot of network effects.
00:38:25.170 - 00:39:01.674, Speaker A: I want to say something about this and ask a follow up on this because this is something David and I have been talking about for a while. Like the most bullish thing for ether is to be understood. And I still feel like we are so early in the cycle of the world actually understanding ethereum and ether. I mean, you look at like Google searches and bitcoin is way up there. Ethereum is almost nothing. NFTs have done something, but people still haven't associated NFTs with ether as an asset. I'm curious how early you think we are? It feels like mainstream understands what bitcoin is like.
00:39:01.674 - 00:39:38.026, Speaker A: Bitcoin, digital gold. People on Wall street can articulate that. If you ask random person on the street, he could probably articulate that as well. But they do not understand eth or Ethereum. And this is where I see much of the upside. So if you consider that EIP 15 five nine is going to happen, proof of stake is going to happen, right? The majority of the bullcase upside is actually the world understanding these things and for the first time understanding the asset. And am I overstating the case here? I feel like the world is maybe like 5% to 10% of the way to understanding Ethereum.
00:39:38.026 - 00:39:54.460, Speaker A: And there are very few people who actually know about EIP 15 five nine and fee burn, and that issuance is going to drop deflationary. Like there's a very small cult group that knows about it. Now, am I overstating the case? How early are we on that? Sue, maybe you first.
00:39:56.190 - 00:40:41.090, Speaker C: I think we're very early in terms of people getting a proper understanding of Ethereum. I think nowadays, even like even skeptics, they roughly understand how bitcoin works. But just in terms of the basics of how Ethereum works, it's a more complex chain and there's a lot of activity going on. So a lot of skeptics don't even realize that a lot of the skepticism that they have toward bitcoin, they can't use on Ethereum in the same way. So I absolutely agree with you. I will say just as a slight counter to that though, is that I do think that retail, they're naturally much more drawn to Ethereum in the first place because they already don't resonate as much with digital gold. And either they participated in icos back then, or nowadays they participate in some other activities.
00:40:41.090 - 00:41:11.662, Speaker C: But I do think that there's something very fascinating about the fact that I think retail has been more overweight ether than a lot of institutions up to now. And I think that they've been right as well. And that kind of actually is almost like a fractal of crypto itself, where retail has also been ahead of institutions and also has been right. DeFi was invested in by retail mainly during its first run ups. That kind of almost makes it that much more powerful in a way that it is grassroots individuals as opposed to entities that have been capturing a lot of these moves.
00:41:11.726 - 00:41:15.054, Speaker A: I got to say, retail being first is one of my favorite things about crypto.
00:41:15.182 - 00:41:16.082, Speaker D: It's just great.
00:41:16.136 - 00:41:17.080, Speaker A: I love it.
00:41:17.530 - 00:41:52.622, Speaker B: Hey, bankless nation. I hope you're enjoying the interview thus far. In the second half of this conversation, we go into the specific details of the numbers behind the ether trade. Like I said in the intro, ETH is on its 6th weekly green candle in a row, both against the dollar and against bitcoin. And I asked sue to help us measure the magnitude of this move, and his answer was a really fun one. And then at the end of this conversation, we zoom out and have the conversation about crypto cycles. Sue and Kyle actually have differing opinions about what the future of crypto cycles looks like.
00:41:52.622 - 00:42:22.050, Speaker B: Sue thinks that this is generally going to be perhaps the last crypto cycle. Kyle is not yet convinced. And then we get into price predictions where sue. Unlike most of our guests, sue did not dance around the issue and actually gave a specific number of what he thinks Ether could run to in the short to medium term. Stay tuned for the second half of this episode. But first, before we get there, we have to take a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible. Gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange.
00:42:22.050 - 00:43:10.818, Speaker B: I've been a customer of Gemini since I first got into crypto in 2017, and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells. Gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide. And on Gemini, there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets, including many of the hot DFI tokens, and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid Dai markets. Gemini just launched their earn program, where you can earn up to 7.4% interest on 26 various crypto assets. If you're tired of paying fees in DFI or you don't want to worry about DFI exploits, but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets, Gemini Earn is the product for you. Another product I'm stoked to get my hands on is the Gemini crypto back credit card, which gives you 3% cash back on all of your purchases, but paid to you in your preferred crypto asset.
00:43:10.818 - 00:43:33.614, Speaker B: When I get my Gemini credit card, I'm going to make sure that I get my cash back in ETH, so whenever I buy something, I get a little bit of eth bonus back to me. At the same time, you can open up a free account in under 3 minutes@gemini.com. Gobankless and if you trade more than $100 within the first 30 days after sign up, you'll be gifted a free $15 bitcoin bonus. Check them out@gemini.com.
00:43:33.732 - 00:43:53.490, Speaker A: GoBankless metamask is your Goto wallet for the bankless journey. If you're going bankless, you need metamask, period. Browser and mobile. Get them both. This is your tool to unlock the world of defi. Here's my favorite part. Now you can swap tokens directly in metamask with a single swipe.
00:43:53.490 - 00:44:16.746, Speaker A: This has got to be the easiest way to trade ethereum tokens. Choose a token, you own a token to exchange it with. Get your quotes. If you like what you see, you hit swap. That's it. What makes swap so useful is what happens behind the scenes. It compares dexes aggregators and market makers to find you the best price with the lowest network fees and the least slippage.
00:44:16.746 - 00:44:34.530, Speaker A: This means you can swap a wider range of tokens, and swaps can even automatically split up your trade to give you access to better liquidity. You don't even have to think about it. Try it out. Download metamask for desktop or mobile now at Metamask IO and start swapping.
00:44:36.090 - 00:45:28.902, Speaker B: So I want to get into the details of this current ether move, and specifically the ether trade. So right now, Ether is on its 6th weekly green candle, both on the dollar and on BTC. Ether just painted its biggest green weekly green candle ever at almost $1,000 in one week. Absolutely massive for an asset that's previous all time high was $1,400. It's up 25% in the week. Meanwhile, ether BTC is over seven, which it's only ever been higher, versus bitcoin for like, I think a total of five or six months in all of its lifespan. How do you guys explain this massive move of Ethereum? Also, can you help us measure its magnitude? Because crypto is crazy.
00:45:28.902 - 00:45:45.740, Speaker B: So sometimes crazy things are actually not all that crazy, because we're inside of just a crazy world, so it's hard to measure. So can you guys reflect on that? How big is this move, and why is this move happening? Kyle, let's start with you.
00:45:46.670 - 00:46:30.700, Speaker D: Yeah, well, I think there is a real power to a proof of Lindy. So before something hits an all time high again, especially after a big flush out, there's always a question of, is this a debt cap bounce? Or what is the value of this asset? And that's not correct. Lindy just means, is it alive? Right? That's the definition. But actually, people don't realize it until you start breaking all time highs. Bitcoin did it first, right? Versus its 2017 all time high. But for Ethereum now, this is like when people wake up. This isn't when people capitulate or they take profit or whatever.
00:46:30.700 - 00:46:59.954, Speaker D: This is when people that were in Ethereum that heard about it, that had some money allocated, probably lost a bunch in 2018. This is when they load up. And that's, I think what we were saying. Anytime we're looking at all time highs, it gets me excited, because same goes for nfts. We saw cryptokitties in 2017, but then we saw nothing for a long time.
00:46:59.992 - 00:47:00.242, Speaker C: Right?
00:47:00.296 - 00:47:22.700, Speaker D: But now we see an emergence again. This is a proof of Lindy. The likelihood of a big NFT boom again, or like a continuation is now actually quite high. Right. Whereas just as of last year was demonstrably lower. Right. So I think that is really important, actually.
00:47:23.550 - 00:48:00.120, Speaker A: Kyle, what about this? Right? So this almost seems to be playing out almost in a, in a similar way to the way 2017 played out. I don't know if you think that it's kind of a fractal to 2017 or not. Maybe you could comment on that. But the one thing that's different is ether right now is approaching half a trillion dollar market cap. Right? This was not the case when it started its run in 2017. So isn't it going to take a lot more money, more capital, bigger buyers in order to move the price in the way that it did in 2017? Any reflections on that? And where is this money coming from?
00:48:00.650 - 00:48:23.600, Speaker D: I mean, there is just so much money in the world these days. And people were saying the same thing about bitcoin when it was like ten k and anytime it went to 10.5, people just thought it was going to get crushed again. And then it went straight to all the way up to 60k. Right. So I think that is much more remarkable in terms of the volume of dollars that went in to buy bitcoin. But yeah, there's just so much money in the world.
00:48:23.600 - 00:49:07.818, Speaker D: If you have to ask yourself, where's the incremental dollar to go in this? I would just feel like that's the wrong question. The answer here is going to be, it's going to come from bitcoin and it's going to come from dollars, basically. Right. But I just feel like if you have to think of who the incremental buyer is, every time you're looking for reasons to sell, and if you're looking for reasons to sell, you will always find them. This particular argument to me, never holds weight. Like who is the incremental buyer? Because, yes, obviously at the top, there's no incremental buyer. But did your analysis truly bring you to a good conclusion there or not.
00:49:07.818 - 00:49:10.880, Speaker D: I think that is well said.
00:49:11.490 - 00:49:32.354, Speaker B: So let's talk about the magnitude of this move. In my opinion, this ethereum move, both versus dollar and versus bitcoin, is perhaps one of crypto's largest events ever in its twelve year history. Would you guys agree with that kind of bold statement? Sue, let's start with you.
00:49:32.472 - 00:50:21.300, Speaker C: Yes, absolutely. I think that it's broken key 2018 levels, and it's at the point now where I know people that have flown around the world to move their bitcoin cold storage to buy ether. I know that sounds kind of insane, but I think that that'll continue if it gets to 0.1, right? Because in the previous near flipping cycle, there were a lot of talks about bitcoin ogs moving to ether and bitcoin cash and this kind of stuff. And that then turned out to be a panic. And people say, well, that's repudiated or that's refuted, right? But with this key, I think the key break was probably zero five and then zero six a couple of days later. It actually kills off a lot of arguments against sort of a more pluralistic distribution of a value in the crypto space.
00:50:21.300 - 00:52:01.826, Speaker C: It's definitely making a lot of people wake up, right? Because now if you're an allocator, you look at the space you saw, even the banks, right, JP Morgan, they were putting out research about how bitcoin analyzing digital gold thesis, and then they put out another thing about just covering the Ethereum bull run and then saying how there are actually a lot of reasons why Ethereum might know the clients are demanding it. And the coverage is also demanding, actually, I strongly believe, I mean, Mark Cuban, I think a great example of someone who was skeptical on crypto as a whole. But then seeing the adoption of on chain activity through Defi and Nifty's, came to realize that this was the next inheritor of sort of big tech vision. I was speaking with a billionaire big tech investor the other day, and he was saying how the reason he allocated to crypto is purely because of the idea that he's been long all these big tech Internet stocks for many years now, and he thinks that it cannot continue in that direction for that much longer. There he's asking himself almost like, who is the incremental buyer? Sort of in your speak? But he's almost thinking like if the generational trends move toward a more distributed future, then it's still very early, because no one understands this yet, right? Very few people truly understand this as sort of the inheritor of the new Internet. I think that it basically allows price is the best predictor of price, and price is also the best. It makes people listen to all the narratives, so it makes people try to understand.
00:52:01.826 - 00:52:05.678, Speaker C: And that process is making a lot of people wake up and analyze.
00:52:05.774 - 00:52:10.790, Speaker A: Sue, are you seeing maximalists capitulate then, or are they going down with the ship?
00:52:11.690 - 00:52:57.830, Speaker C: I mean, it's tricky, right? Because if your brand is a Twitter bitcoin maximalist, then you can't really capitulate in public because you'll lose followers. But I'm sure privately, a lot of these people own a lot of eth, actually, and I think they're not incentivized to talk about it, but they definitely do. You can see it in the price action on some of these exchanges. The FBDC volume has been incredibly high. On Bitfinex, for instance, it's been about a third of the eth volume on several days. That's people who currently own a ton of BDC, selling that BDC specifically for ether, right? It's not dollar based buying, but yeah, that kind of also goes along with the idea that I always find it funny, right? Either people, they used to always hold a lot of bitcoin because they'd be like, well, the market is irrational. I need to have some bitcoin just in case.
00:52:57.830 - 00:53:19.914, Speaker C: And then bitcoin people, out of them, they hold a lot of ether because they're like, well, the market's irrational. I have to hold some ether just in case. So it ends up being like, everyone's 50 50, but for different reasons. A lot of people are doing Pascal's wager there now, and they're just saying, even if this is not what I believe in the market, I prefer wealth, so I just buy the one that the market wants. I don't kind of fight against it.
00:53:20.032 - 00:53:50.850, Speaker A: I actually think the hardening of Ether's monetary policy is bringing some of the sound money people that have been bitcoiners for a long time over. Because the one criticism that I think had a lot of validity from the bitcoin side is like, what's ether's plan for issuance into the future? Right? And Ethereum would say things like, minimum, vile issuance. And they would say, yeah, but show me the code, show me the demand. And now that's starting to harden. Do you think that's part of the transfer here, the issuance policy being formed and articulated?
00:53:50.930 - 00:54:29.554, Speaker C: Well, I think for sure part of it. I think, like Kobe mentioned the previous one, there's always a camp that thinks that ether is just too centralized, there's too much control by the core devs, and so it can be captured. And then once governance is captured, then the whole chain is kind of, it doesn't have that credible neutrality. I think for those folks, they take a very philosophical stance against Ether. But I think, yeah, I agree with you. For a lot of people who just say Ether is really not optimized for ether holders, which has been the case actually for Ethereum for quite a long time. I remember in 2018, I think one of the big ODC desks, they put out a paper saying like, ether inflation is just way too high.
00:54:29.554 - 00:55:23.454, Speaker C: We need to lower the block reward from three to two ether, three to one ether. And after some time they ended up doing it and Ether price went up. But in the beginning, because it was growing so fast in utility, there was never that concern for the ether holder because they were already getting, I think for the core devs, there was this idea that, well, you're already up 200 x, you're already up 100 x. What else do you want? I'm just going to not even think about what ether holders want. But I think the bear market, what it brought out, was sort of like a renewed kind of shelling point, that ether had to be a proper store value, kind of a repudiation of Jeremy Rubin's idea that you could economically abstract ether out of Ethereum. So people kind of heard that and then were like, well, definitely that's not going to happen, and here's why it's not going to happen. So I think some bitcoiners who saw that were like, okay, well, now this is an investable asset because people are at least committed to this being an asset, as opposed to something other than an asset.
00:55:23.454 - 00:55:32.850, Speaker C: Because there were quite vocal people in Ethereum who said, eth is not an asset. To make it an asset would be to harm Ethereum's goal. Right? That was actually a very popular view in 2018.
00:55:32.930 - 00:55:34.920, Speaker A: Yeah, it was right on.
00:55:35.290 - 00:55:38.520, Speaker B: Kyle, any reflections on what we've been talking about so far?
00:55:39.770 - 00:56:08.370, Speaker D: For me, it's all about on chain activity. To be honest. DFI Summer was fully incentivized, but then it came back and the yields are still good. And sometimes it's even happening on other chains that are EVM compatible. Right. So anytime I see on chain activity, I just feel like it's a bullcase for ETH. I don't really care where it is, especially since the first bridge people always build is to Ethereum and everything is EVM compatible these days.
00:56:08.370 - 00:56:13.490, Speaker D: So, yeah, for me, it's all about on chain activity for Ethereum.
00:56:14.390 - 00:56:30.694, Speaker B: I can't remember where I heard this, sue. Maybe it was on the Kobe podcast that theores capital is the largest single holder of ether. Is that true? And if that is true, or regardless if that's true or not, when is this trade over win sell question mark?
00:56:30.892 - 00:56:33.590, Speaker C: Definitely not largest, but I think I said one of the largest.
00:56:33.670 - 00:56:34.550, Speaker B: One of the largest.
00:56:34.630 - 00:56:58.458, Speaker C: I think that is definitely true. I've been trying to figure out what qualifies as one of the largest, and I made sure we bought the needful amount to qualify as such. I was just saying to Kyle, it'd be such a shame if we bought these other coins and then we didn't have enough ether, and then it went for this move that would just be like. It'd be really sad, actually. I would actually shed a tear.
00:56:58.554 - 00:57:00.160, Speaker A: Well, welcome aboard, guys.
00:57:04.050 - 00:57:27.514, Speaker C: But the cool thing about ether too, is even as the market gets more efficient, whatever, you can kind of imagine a world where you still have a lot of yields for it. You can put it in DeFi and get yields. You can stake it and get yields. There's so much activity happening, right? And there's so many ways to use it. I think that's really attractive. Whereas now with, like, the GBTC trade is dead, it's actually negative. And then with BDC as well, it's just a very inert kind of thing.
00:57:27.514 - 00:58:06.454, Speaker C: And originally I thought that WBTC would be more bearish for ether than it was because I thought each chain would just lionize bitcoin as the store value collateral. But that really hasn't happened at all. People do prefer the actual native asset, even on BSc, people prefer. So that kind of preference for the native asset, that kind of native asset nationalism, I think I kind of underestimated. And I do think that what WBDC actually did was convert a lot of bitcoiners to Ethereum, because they just put their BDC in there for the yields because they saw their friends getting it, and then they're like, hey, wait a second. This is actually kind of cool, and I need to own some of this ether instead. And so that actually is what actually happened.
00:58:06.652 - 00:58:11.942, Speaker A: There's this reserve asset quality to it. Eth on defi. Yeah, go ahead, Kyle.
00:58:12.086 - 00:58:53.234, Speaker D: Yeah. I think one of the other ultra bull cases for me is people realized this past year that they could store their net worth on Ethereum, and maybe not even in Ethereum. A lot of people don't steer it on stablecoins, right? And they'll happily earn their yields, but that would then become their primary source of how they would store, maximize and earn their net worth. Like on their nest egg. Right? And then naturally, yes, of course, once you're using a platform in a network, of course you go buy it, right? At some point, if you have a high risk tolerance, you buy a lot. If you have a low risk tolerance, you buy a little. But you're bullish.
00:58:53.282 - 00:58:53.494, Speaker C: Shit.
00:58:53.532 - 00:59:11.078, Speaker D: Right? And I think that is maybe the single most pivotal moment, let's say, of the past year and a half, where people both created a lot of net worth, but also happily store a large percentage of their net worth, just like in the Ethereum network.
00:59:11.254 - 00:59:16.720, Speaker B: Are you guys Eth maxis now? Eth holders for life? Kyle, do you have an opinion on this?
00:59:17.490 - 01:00:13.054, Speaker D: Okay, so we are on chain and crypto maxis and have been for a while, right? And if Ethereum, we believe, is undervalued, given the amount of activity on the network, then yeah, we're probably going to be overweight Ethereum, right. If things were to change, like if it were to realize its value, or if the onchain activity were to slow down, or if another network that was not EVM compatible were to gain traction, then maybe I would change my thesis. But yeah, for the time being, I really don't see that at all. Everything has to be EVM compatible for people to want to interact with it basically right now. Right? Actually, I think there was this idea, and there still is this idealism that at some point people will interact with the blockchain and have no idea what's on the back end.
01:00:13.092 - 01:00:13.680, Speaker A: Right.
01:00:14.770 - 01:00:29.750, Speaker D: And this is still a beautiful vision. But the reality is the only way to get even close to this vision right now is for you to be EVM compatible for me. Anything that is basically just bullish. Ethereum.
01:00:30.490 - 01:00:31.960, Speaker B: Sue, anything to add?
01:00:32.650 - 01:01:09.442, Speaker C: Yeah, we definitely always try to pride ourselves on being as sort of Bayesian as possible. So with new information coming in, you always have to change kind of a bit how you want to be positioned. So if tomorrow chinese government comes out and says bitcoin is the only accepted currency, then you have to go buy a lot of bitcoin. You have to probably sell your ether to buy bitcoin. But there's always non zero events that can happen that make some assets more bullish than others. And I think that that's always true. I think that the risk reward for ether is actually even better now than it was before.
01:01:09.442 - 01:01:57.540, Speaker C: It's arguably a better risk reward now than it was during the deeper market, where I think you really have to be a true believer and kind of be a deep tech, thesis driven investor to make that trade because you're getting dumped on by everybody right at that time. So I really applaud the kind of thesis driven kind of investors that went in at that time. But I think also my hope is that they don't kind of just want to sell for their ten x 20 x to 30 x now and then move on. Because I have seen a lot of people do that. And the thing I tell a lot of crypto natives too, is if you just talk to natives all day, you'll just see people around you and then be like, everyone's too rich. Now we have to sell because everyone's too rich. But actually, no, you happen to be in the bear market of one of the best assets in the history of assets, and you bought it with your friends.
01:01:57.540 - 01:02:38.206, Speaker C: You actually deserve to be rich. You don't have to be ashamed of it. You can just prefer to keep staying rich. Right? So that kind of PTSD from the bear market, I actually think has caused a lot of people to sell too early on the way up. I think that for us, we think that Ethereum has reached a critical mass point where people can't ignore it. And the scaling is coming in a variety of ways, even if it doesn't come purely on Ethereum, it'll come through sidechain type solutions, it'll come through other solutions. And on chain activity, like Kyle said, is very good for the entire Ethereum bowl case.
01:02:38.206 - 01:03:22.910, Speaker C: And so I think you want to give that time to play out in sort of the fullness of that vision right now. There's still a lot of talk about cbdcs and this kind of stuff. I actually think that a lot of these will be ruled unconstitutional by a lot of jurisdictions and a lot of judiciaries. And what they'll end up having is governments, if they want to do Ubi, they don't have to create a CBDC, they can just do it on a public chain. And then whether that's ethereum or on another chain, that happening is also very bullish for Ethereum, right? It's also very bullish for on chain activity. So I think there's still a whole lot of misunderstanding, even now with the ether at 4k, about what it is and what the true vision could be. So I like to see a lot of those things properly play out, like to see it go deflationary.
01:03:22.910 - 01:03:48.134, Speaker C: I do think that there will be a lot of trading opportunities as you get closer into flippinning as well, because there will be a lot of emotional stuff, right? Like some people will be selling to bitcoin, some people will be selling the dollar, some people will be buying more. And so I think that that will be very volatile. I don't think that will be not volatile, but I think we're nowhere near those points yet. Where we are now, we spend actually.
01:03:48.172 - 01:04:38.806, Speaker D: Quite a lot of time. I think to some people it may seem simple that we're just talking about long bitcoin or long Ethereum, but there's this illusion of diversification, right? And you can spend a lot of time hunting for the right alts or the right this or whatever, and then buy six of them and then wanted some more, and then buy six more of them. And then before you know it, you got a portfolio of, like, I don't know, 20 different random positions that you may or may not believe in. Whereas if you had just decided to denominate your portfolio in east, you would have outperformed everything. Right? So I think we spend a lot of time just trying to figure out what are you denominated in and to what degree are you denominated in that. And then, yeah, we happily trade around other positions too, but that is by far the most important.
01:04:38.988 - 01:04:58.220, Speaker A: Well said, guys. Look, if flipping that would be a major event, right? The first time that bitcoin was flippant by another crypto asset. Where does this leave, I guess two things. One, where does this leave bitcoin? And then secondly, where does this leave other eth killers? Kyle, we'll start with you.
01:05:00.690 - 01:06:00.320, Speaker D: Yeah, I think the problem with, let's say, other layer, one smart contract like blockchains, is they may or may not have more activity, but the amount of fees being paid on them is tiny compared to what's being paid on Ethereum. And that's part of their value add, right? Like high TPS, low fee, whatever. But actually, for me, the whole value of Ethereum is the sheer volume that people are willing to pay in fees, the onchain activity. Right? And so for me, it's all about that. Yes, if there's a flipping, maybe you get a higher monetary premium to it. That I think would be the obvious case. But yeah, when I think about ETH killer or other layer ones, everything comes back to like, well, is it EVM compatible? Because if so, then I just buy more.
01:06:00.320 - 01:06:14.286, Speaker D: Is it like, how much in fees is being paid there? And if it's not very much, then, okay, I don't really care or maybe it's good for some other narrative reason, but it's not like an Sov kind of asset.
01:06:14.398 - 01:06:32.490, Speaker A: David calls himself a fee maximalist. I've heard him say this before, and I think that's kind of what you're saying, too. Sue, what about you? So if bitcoin loses the throne, does it lose its value proposition as sort of the reserve crypto asset, all the liquidity that comes with that throne? And what's the fate of bitcoin after that? Go ahead, sue.
01:06:34.350 - 01:07:32.650, Speaker C: I'm still undecided on this. I talked about this a bit in the Kobe podcast also, and I lean toward it being short midterm, quite bearish for bitcoin, because you'll have a lot of people who are effectively sitting in bitcoin saying that, wow, this is like a stale long almost. I have this long for this thesis, but it's been disproven because it's not the most high liquidity. So that would be quite a scary moment for them. And I think that then that would be the real test for the Ethereum community. Like, will they then sell back sats and stack more sats, or will they really just hold eth? And if they do just hold eth, then I think that it's going to be very hard to attract additional dollars into bitcoin. Because then at that point, I was just speaking with one of my good friends in Ethereum, and he was saying how if ETH flips in bitcoin, the wrong question is like, is it bearish for bitcoin? The right question is how many days would it take doge to flip bitcoin next? Because he said ETH flipped bitcoin very quickly in early 2018, and then XRP came right after right, and almost flipping it.
01:07:32.650 - 01:08:35.246, Speaker C: And so he's saying, if eth flipping bitcoin, he says, you go all in on whatever is the third coin at that moment, because that's kind of like the obvious trade that would happen. So I do see that kind of being like highly emotional and highly disruptive time if that were to happen. Like you're kind of alluding to. And I think there'll be a lot of interesting opportunities for sure at that. Know, I think long term it's a different question. I do think that I still believe in all of bitcoin's core kind of strengths. But the ultimate question, like Kobe said on his podcast, is, does the market demand these things right? Does it demand bitcoin caliber decentralization? Does it demand fixed supply? Does it demand this kind of fixed issuance with basically very few upgrades and this kind of ossified protocol, does it demand this? And that's also something that only the market can answer, right? That can't be answered by any individual because the needs of any individual are not relevant for the market, the market and society.
01:08:35.246 - 01:09:30.530, Speaker C: If it demands an on chain future, then that will be very likely in the form of ethereum as a store value. And if it demands a more austere version of that kind of the future that's maybe more regulated and then more government friendly and custody friendly, then it'll go toward more that camp. So I think the bullish bitcoin dominance case has kind of always been the pro custody, pro, kind of regulated on ramp case that bitcoin has generally done better in. But even now, ether now has all the same on ramps as bitcoin does on those same things. Right? Ether also has CME, and ether also has the grayscale trusts and the that. That definitely does make it very hard for people to attract incremental dollars into the system when you have this compare and contrast.
01:09:31.670 - 01:10:08.318, Speaker D: One more thing I would add to that is I think the heart of the bitcoin narrative is about self custody too. Right? But if you look at the main thesis of the past year, it has not been about self custody. It's been about centralized custody. Right? So this, I think, is a huge problem, actually, for bitcoin. It is not a beautiful future to have centralized custody with regulated onramps. It is a beautiful future to have self custody. And so, yeah, if that were to change, then I think it can be a wonderful store value.
01:10:08.318 - 01:10:13.726, Speaker D: But if it is, like, in centralized places, I don't know, it hurts the narrative a lot.
01:10:13.828 - 01:10:15.140, Speaker A: Banklips for the win.
01:10:16.070 - 01:10:16.818, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:10:16.984 - 01:10:24.820, Speaker B: So zooming out, is this the last cycle that crypto is going to see? Do you guys have opinions on this? Kyle, let's start with you.
01:10:28.470 - 01:10:52.026, Speaker D: I think that there are more cycles, to be honest. I think sue has a slightly new. He's got a different answer than me. That's why you have both of us on, though, right? So, yeah, I think there are more cycles. I just think we're nowhere near the top of this cycle like an ethereum bull run is not the top of the cycle. There are other things that are going to be, but it's not an ethereum on chain bull run. That's not it.
01:10:52.026 - 01:10:52.346, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:10:52.368 - 01:11:32.540, Speaker C: I think it comes down to how you define cycles. Right? I was thinking to Avi at Blocktower about this, and he's like, your super cycle theories already come true because there are people talking about bitcoin versus ether, and the only question is, which one do they buy? It's not a question of, is crypto a scam? It's only a question of what do you buy, what percent? We've already made it. We're already here, guys. It's already super cycle because no one is even saying it's a scam anymore. Right? You definitely will always have drawdowns. I mean, even in normal bull markets and equities, you have drawdowns. DFI, arguably, against ETH is already, like, in a bear market for some time now.
01:11:32.540 - 01:12:03.998, Speaker C: I think it's down like 40, 50% in ETh. There's kind of always a bear market everywhere, and there's always a bull market everywhere. And I think that that'll be kind of the. I think in 2018, 2019, I predicted that we will see all coin correlations go very low. And I think that we're really seeing it now where I think, just like, the last two weeks, the realized all coin correlation has gone to, like, 30% or something, which is, like, the lowest ever. I can't remember the exact number. But that is a sign of maturity, right? It's a sign that there's no concept now of an alt season nowadays.
01:12:03.998 - 01:12:38.094, Speaker C: You see, some days, EtH is up 12%, and a lot of alts are down in dollars. I think doge has contributed to that, too. Where doge can be up 20%, everything's down. I think that that kind of decoupling of coins versus other coins is very healthy. And after this continues more and more. I mean, single stock correlations in most healthy stock markets are around 30% as well. So you can definitely have markets where one coin gets very frothy and then it cycles over to another coin, or all coins fall back 2030, 40%.
01:12:38.094 - 01:13:01.990, Speaker C: But I don't think you're going to get a 90% fall in ether again. I don't think you get that chance again. And the reason why I believe that is because I think the structure of cycles is that it's very often the market gives you that one capitulation and then it's over. Right? So, like.com, you get that 95% down in Amazon, and then you don't get that ever again. And then even the dip buyers, they're hoping for that 20% dip in Amazon, and they don't get it. And they don't get it for, like, years.
01:13:01.990 - 01:13:49.574, Speaker C: And this bull run has been exactly that for a ton of people where they keep hoping for that proper bear candle and that capitulation and massive liquidations. And the liquidations come, but then there's spot buyers that buy it right up and it engulfs a red candle in, like, two days. Like Hal said, I don't think we're anywhere near the point where you have to be thinking about going very conservative. I do agree with him that that point may come, but even if you don't look for that point, I don't think you have to worry as much, because this is now an institutional grade investment. Right? It's not an investment which is a caliber of, like, we can fall 95% right after 2017. Icos having that much supply and having to dump it to pay their employees. Yeah, you actually can lose 95% now.
01:13:49.574 - 01:14:15.134, Speaker C: I think we will not have a 90% drawdown again. I think that actually is a very contrarian view in crypto because of the nature of cycles. But I think that if you zoom out of crypto itself and you put it into, let's say, overall disruption in tech cycles, Max Payne is actually shallow dips because it gets everyone who's been used to bigger dips just to not own enough of the asset that they need to have.
01:14:15.172 - 01:14:45.174, Speaker A: Right, guys, this has been a really fun episode, and you guys are fantastic. Thanks for guiding us through thesis here a little bit. In the trade, we've talked super cycles, no more 90% drawdowns. We talked about the flipping. Sue, I want to end with this question, because you said 15k earlier in the episode was FUD. 15k price of ETH. That is what is a realistic price for ETH in this bull cycle for this trade that you're making.
01:14:45.174 - 01:14:46.760, Speaker A: What's not FUD, sir?
01:14:47.870 - 01:15:24.482, Speaker C: I think we'll go over twenty five k, at least. I think also that when the price comes off the blow off top, if there is one, I don't think that it will be the style of the old one, because I think that if you think about the way that 2017 2018 market microstructure was, it was very inefficient. Right. There was very poor liquidity at that time. Like Bitfinix was 12% below Coinbase, for instance. So some would argue the actual prints aren't even real. Right.
01:15:24.482 - 01:15:46.138, Speaker C: The 1400 print isn't even real. And then some of these prints aren't even real. Whereas now the market is incredibly efficient, the volumes are incredibly high. Crypto volumes are now already higher than exchange volumes on stock exchanges. Binance volume is higher than chinese stock market volume, Coinbase volume on some days is higher than Nasdaq. Actually, that might not be true. I think it's higher than some things.
01:15:46.138 - 01:16:16.550, Speaker C: FTX volume is incredible. I mean, like, in the derabit options market, volumes are just absolutely insane. And I think that all that stuff, that's not coming back. Right. But that's not going back to the way it was, because now people can get higher yields, people can do things, all this kind of stuff. So I think that, in general, my experience in bull markets is that it goes higher than the most ardent believers believe it will go. And that is actually the max pain, because they sell it based on a dollar view, based on the fact that they can now buy a house, they can now buy five houses, they can now buy a boat, they can buy a bigger boat.
01:16:16.550 - 01:17:05.410, Speaker C: So Max Payne is actually them having been believers, but then not move, the full move, because they think they're too focused on their own life, basically, in terms of what that money means for their own life. And that's actually the entire story of pretty much all good assets. Right? All good assets get priced out of. So I think another point, kind of back to the idea of why I think Ethereum is such a strong investment, because it's one of the few assets, I think, that is going from many to few in the sense that the wealthier people are trying to figure out, how do we get more of this from many people? Whereas a lot of other coins, it is few people who own them and they want to sell them to many people. And so this few to many and many to few, I think, is very bullish because it shows the quality of the asset.
01:17:06.730 - 01:17:10.600, Speaker A: Kyle, give us your price prediction before we head out.
01:17:13.370 - 01:17:28.054, Speaker D: I got nothing new to add to that. 25K would be a nice target for that. I think for that to happen, you need to see 1559 happen on schedule, and you need to see proof of stake. You see those two things? Twenty five k is reasonable.
01:17:28.182 - 01:17:41.070, Speaker A: David, what do you think of this? We did an ETH Bulls episode, and even our most bullish eth bulls, this was in December. Their top was at. We're at. Pretty incredible. David, what you got? Last question.
01:17:41.220 - 01:17:55.940, Speaker B: Yeah, sue, this is a complete. Well, slight change of subject, but you often say this phrase, prefer wealth, and I actually haven't really completely integrated what that means. And so I'm just hoping to ask you directly, what does prefer wealth mean?
01:17:56.630 - 01:18:35.898, Speaker C: There's this idea of log wealth and linear wealth. Right. And the idea of mean. We kind of saw the Twitter fights about it with paradigm and then SBF, where SBF is saying, I prefer linear wealth, and then paradigm saying, no, all humans prefer log wealth. It's just a question of how log and all this kind of hilarious stuff. And that's kind of where the prefer wealth meme came out. And I think, for me, what it means is that when you make an investment decision or a trading decision, you do the one that is to optimize for wealth as linearly as possible, because that is the truest form of wealth.
01:18:35.898 - 01:19:21.870, Speaker C: And also that you don't try to let life things come into that. It's almost like a venture approach, right? Like if you make a venture investment in something because it has no liquidity and it has no mark to market, you don't constantly think about how do you sell it, you just ride it up and down. You just prefer owning the thing itself. And I recommend people to view crypto in the same way where you've done this investment into it and you just let that sit in that actual bucket, and you don't think too hard about what this can now buy you in the real world or what this can. I mean, obviously, make sure you don't go broke, right? And make sure you take care of yourself and definitely find to spend. But you also have to have some part of your brain thinking, deep tech venture, long term thesis, because that's the whole point of being in investing space in the first place. Right.
01:19:21.870 - 01:19:58.390, Speaker C: And so I think that's been kind of my lesson to people on Twitter, which is that it's actually totally fine to own assets, and if they go up, you can keep owning those assets, especially if you believe they will continue to make you wealthy. There's no need to, let's say, basically have this mentality that you're constantly looking for when to cash out and when to dump and when to kind of start spending the money that you've created. You can just grow wealth, basically prefer.
01:19:58.470 - 01:20:15.582, Speaker A: A wealth denomination in crypto money assets. I think that's what we're saying. I want to end with this quote from sue. It's pinned to the top of his Twitter right now. If you don't understand crypto and refuse to learn, it's going to be a tough century for you. I love that. I would say the same thing about ether.
01:20:15.582 - 01:20:24.580, Speaker A: It's going to be a tough century unless you understand this asset, this asset class. Gentlemen, it's been a pleasure to have you both on bankless. Thanks so much.

01:20:28.572 - 01:20:46.630, Speaker A: As always, guys, risks and disclaimers. Of course, crypto is volatile and risky. ETH is volatile and risky as well. You could lose what you put in.
