00:00:00.250 - 00:00:15.006, Speaker A: You. Brian Selkis is bringing on his crypto theses for 2023 in today's episode. Fantastic way to end the year and look at the next year. David, what are we talking about today?
00:00:15.188 - 00:01:13.858, Speaker B: Every single year, Brian Selkis comes with a massive document that is a fantastic way to snapshot the year. It always feels like this document that comes out every single year out of Missari, that Ryan Selkis spends weeks producing. It's a great way to tie a bow on one year and look forward into the next. So while this is a snapshot of 2022, it is also Ryan's 2022 crypto theses. And so this is just for all of the tunnel vision that we've got focusing on SPF and FTX and contagion. This is a nice way to zoom all the way back and talk about just the trends across the industry, which, I will remind the Bankless listeners, is very broad and wide. So trends in Bitcoin, trends in ethereum, trends in DFI, trends in NFTs, trends in CFI, and got to unpack we do have to unpack the regulatory landscape, the grayscale and DCG landscape, and a number of other different topics, such as who to pay attention to in 2023.
00:01:13.858 - 00:01:25.720, Speaker B: If you were on that list, that prior list, who to pay attention to in 2021 and 2022, it was either a very good or bad list, depending on who you are. Yeah, exactly.
00:01:26.090 - 00:02:00.734, Speaker A: Guys, speaking of who to pay attention to, we think you should be paying attention to our friends and sponsors over at Kraken. David this is a crypto platform that didn't rug people in 2022, and they've been at this for like ten years, providing secure, solid service. Well, it feels like everyone else was. A number of other competitors were getting distracted by the newest bright, shining object in crypto. Kraken was just serving the industry without fail, and it's really remained a rock during 2022. What should our listeners know about Kraken?
00:02:00.782 - 00:02:48.740, Speaker B: David yeah, after interviewing Jesse Powell and investigating a little bit more into Kraken, the ethos behind what Kraken is really aligns with me and makes me feel good about having them as our strategic sponsor moving forward into 2023. So this is going to be a long term ongoing relationship because the way that they are building that exchange is, I think, the product that the crypto industry deserves, especially with their emphasis on user verification of Exchange liabilities is aligned with the ethos of crypto, where we use cryptography to empower individuals to verify don't trust. And so we think this is a great strategic sponsor for Bankless moving forward into 2023, and we're excited to work with Kraken moving forward. And if you would like to learn more about Kraken, there is a link in the show notes to go and get started with Kraken also Kraken.com.
00:02:49.110 - 00:03:21.750, Speaker A: Okay, david in addition to the theses that we go over with Ryan Selkas, there's also kind of a bonus section to this episode where we ended the episode, we hit the stop recording button. But there was one question I really wanted to ask him, a question about crypto media and this news about the Block, which is a crypto media publication being secretly owned by SBF. So we get into some of that as well in a bonus episode that we'll provide for Bankless listeners. But apart from that, what else should folks be aware of going into this episode?
00:03:21.910 - 00:03:58.950, Speaker B: Yeah, it's just a broad trend download, so it moves pretty fast. Ryan's got some very broad takes, and because of how ingrained in this industry he is, he can connect so many different parts of the industry to other parts of the industry. That's really the way to get a broad snapshot of what the hell is the state of crypto. At the end of 2022 and moving forward into 2023, we talk about CZ and Brian as the last and remaining exchange leaders. We talk about Anatoli and the state of the Salana ecosystem. We go through the anatomy of a crypto credit crisis, and Selkis calls the grayscale trade crypto's widowmaker. There's just so many topics to pay attention to.
00:03:58.950 - 00:04:20.490, Speaker B: And just as you are listening to this listener, remember that all of these topics in crypto HyperThread with each other. We are one industry, this is one spot. And so the trends in C, five relate to the trends in D, five relate to the trends in NFTs. So as you are paying attention to this, make sure to connect all of the dots to all the other dots that we are talking about as we go through this podcast.
00:04:20.650 - 00:04:26.786, Speaker A: All right, guys, we're going to get right to our episode with Ryan Selkis, but before we do, we want to tell you about these tools to help you.
00:04:26.808 - 00:05:15.774, Speaker B: Go bankless Arbitrum One is pioneering the world of secure Ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the Web Three landscape. Hundreds of projects have already deployed on Arbitrum One, producing flourishing DFI and NFT ecosystems. With a recent addition of Arbitrum, nova gaming and social DApps like Reddit are also now calling Arbitrum home. Both Arbitrum One and Nova leverage the security and decentralization of Ethereum and provide a builder experience that's intuitive, familiar and fully EVM compatible. On Arbitrum, both builders and users will experience faster transaction speeds with significantly lower gas fees. With Arbitrum's recent migration to Arbitrum Nitro, it's also now ten times faster than before. Visit Arbitrum IO, where you can join the community, dive into the developer docs, bridge your assets, and start building your first DAP with Arbitrum.
00:05:15.774 - 00:06:01.146, Speaker B: Experience Web Three development the way it was meant to be secure, fast, cheap, and friction free. The Brave Wallet is your secure multitrain onramp into Web Three and is built directly into the Brave privacy browser. Gone are the days of managing multiple wallet extensions that put you at risk of phishing, spoofs and tracking. With the Brave Wallet, you can securely manage your crypto assets across more than 100 different chains, including Ethereum, Layer Two, Salana, and more, all without downloading risky extensions. The Brave Wallet is easy to set up and removes the headache of jumping between wallets and extensions. It's lightweight, but packed with great features like built in token swaps, buying and holding NFTs with a gallery view and support for hardware wallets. But also much more than that, because Brave is shipping new features every single month with a mission to make Web Three easier to navigate.
00:06:01.146 - 00:06:36.842, Speaker B: For its over 55 million users, wallet extensions are a thing of the past. So get started with Brave's Web Three ready browser today and experience a decentralized Web seamlessly without all the clutter. You can download the browser@brave.com bankless and click the Wallet icon to get started. If you've been listening to Bankless, you know that we're fans of the modular blockchain thesis, the idea that Blockchains will separate execution from data availability and consensus, allowing all three to become the best versions of themselves. And Fuel has built the fastest modular execution layer in the industry. By supporting parallel transaction execution, fuel unlocks significantly faster throughput for the Web Three world.
00:06:36.842 - 00:07:07.342, Speaker B: Fuel also goes beyond the limitations of the EVM with its own Fuel VM, which is more efficient and optimized, opening up the design space for developers. And lastly, Fuel brings a powerful developer experience with its own domain specific language, Sway, and a supportive tool chain called Fork. With Fuel, you can have the benefits of smart contract languages like Validity while adopting the improvements made by the Rust tooling ecosystem, letting the Fuel development environment go beyond the limitations of the EVM. If you want to learn more, there's a link in the show notes to see how you can get involved with a Fuel network.
00:07:07.486 - 00:07:24.890, Speaker A: Bankless Nation we have Ryan Selkis on the episode today, and we're diving into his Crypto Theses for 2023. Super excited to get into these topics. I've been reading these since forever, since I've been in crypto, always jampacked full of insight information. How many pages is this one, Ryan?
00:07:25.470 - 00:07:33.386, Speaker C: This one's a beast. I think it's 168, but that includes the COVID and the disclaimers and all the other garbage.
00:07:33.498 - 00:07:37.566, Speaker A: 168 pages. That's what the information?
00:07:37.748 - 00:07:38.430, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:07:38.580 - 00:07:57.314, Speaker A: Anyway, welcome to Bankless. It's great to have you on again. Okay, a word for the year. David and I were talking about this, but you got 168 pages, a lot of words. If you were to summarize 2022 and give it a word, what word would you give it? What's something that pops into mind right now?
00:07:57.512 - 00:08:04.098, Speaker C: Well, I think that depends if you're looking forward or looking backwards. I think if you're looking at the urine review, let's look backwards.
00:08:04.194 - 00:08:05.542, Speaker A: 2022. What word?
00:08:05.596 - 00:08:06.200, Speaker C: Pain.
00:08:07.130 - 00:08:07.638, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:08:07.724 - 00:08:08.360, Speaker A: Okay.
00:08:09.690 - 00:08:38.926, Speaker C: Full Mr. T mean. Right. Pain. I think if you're looking forward I don't want to call it relief, but I think optimism is a pretty good starting point, and we'll get into that. I think the big thing that happened this year is the core crypto thesis remains unchanged over the next ten years. One thing that did slow pretty significantly is the institutionalization or the Wall Streetification of crypto.
00:08:38.926 - 00:08:57.650, Speaker C: And that's got its benefits and its drawbacks. But I think most of the damage, most of the pain this year was certainly in the latter camp versus the true decentralization and some of those core projects that are going to be the backbone for this economy.
00:08:57.810 - 00:09:09.850, Speaker A: David, I like that word. We were debating some words back and forth, contagion. You said yield was another hubris shortcuts. But I think pain that gets right to the point, my God, 2022 was painful.
00:09:10.510 - 00:10:04.000, Speaker C: It's a good word because I think it's obviously from the economics of it, it's been a pretty disastrous year for investors. But I remember listening to your podcast when this turmoil was really hitting its peak, and just listening to David, I could feel some of that, of like, we've been building here for so long and it's just so fucking disappointing what's going on, right? It's like the parent being disappointed, not mad. We were past the anger phase at one point and I think everybody had some type of moment like that of dejection in the fall. And once reality settles in and you realize, okay, this is just another con artist just like anyone else, the industry is going to be just fine and the core remains, then you can get to rebuilding and have some optimism for the new year.
00:10:04.530 - 00:10:49.846, Speaker B: Ryan mr. Selkis, one of the reasons why I like these crypto theses at the end of the year is that it's such a cohesive and comprehensive snapshot of where we are in time. It's a moment to reflect, it's a moment to look back on 2022 and to make informed takes as to what happens in 2022 and how is it going to determine what 2023 is like. So you've created a number of different overarching themes. And so looking at the table of contents, I'll just kind of read out the themes, the top ten narratives and investment themes. Top ten people to watch, top ten trends in CFI, top ten trends in policy, bitcoin and crypto dollars. Top ten ethereum and layer one trends.
00:10:49.846 - 00:11:33.146, Speaker B: And then it continues into the second page. Top ten trends in DFI, top ten trends in NFTs and decentralized social, top ten trends in Dows and Web three. And then, of course, some bonus content as well. And so I think we're definitely going to be touching on the SBF contagion and all of the content that bankless listeners and everyone in crypto space has gotten hammered into their heads over the last few months. But I think what we also want to do is kind of get back to our roots. Let's talk about the trends in DFI, let's talk about the trends in NFTs. And so using your theses for 2023 and beyond, I think we should just get back to some of the basics of what is at the very root of this industry, using some of the trends that you've identified here.
00:11:33.146 - 00:12:17.122, Speaker B: So to start off this conversation going from the top, top ten narratives and investment themes, there's two sections I wanted to pull out. You open the section with Winter is here, it's time to build. And then also a section crypto is still inevitable. And I actually remember, I think almost every one of your theses documents has a section like this, which is the Crypto is Inevitable section. And it's just a nice refresher to remind ourselves that, yo, this technology is coming to steamroll over the world. It's different now because of what's happened in the last year. So, Ryan, while you were writing this section about why crypto is still inevitable, what was different this year, that really bolstered your confidence to be able to once again say that crypto is still inevitable.
00:12:17.122 - 00:12:21.020, Speaker B: Why is, after all, of 2022, why is crypto still inevitable to you?
00:12:22.030 - 00:13:17.098, Speaker C: Well, I think my favorite slide that we've made as a company is this one that's in the deck or in the presentation in that section, which really lays it out in full detail. And it basically outlines three core drivers, which is generation change. We kind of evolve one year at a time to a more digitally native generation. The second is just the influx of talent that we've seen this cycle. And the level of talent is at a significantly higher mark than we've seen in any cycle previous in terms of business talent, legal, technical. And then there's just dry powder, right? Like real dollars that are on these balance sheets for different projects, whether it's infrastructure related companies or whether you're talking about the projects themselves and their treasuries, that wasn't the case last time around. Right.
00:13:17.098 - 00:14:21.690, Speaker C: A lot of these ICOs, they raised in ETH. They crashed in ETH, or they raised and had these big kind of native token treasuries, but they didn't really have much dry powder. And so a bunch of projects fell by the wayside. And then, more than anything, you've got a number of stepwise upticks in innovation and, like, zero to one progress in DeFi in? NFTs, in dows layer two, kind of scaling the ethereum merge another cycle of bitcoin, kind of. Proving its bona fides as a very censorship resistant digital commodity that can be a form of money for people that need a store of value that they can secure in their head and move across borders with and then stablecoins, which continue to have record months, month over month. Right. So both the kind of derivatives that sit on top of crypto rails and then many of the crypto primitives themselves have just continued to see pretty tremendous growth cycle over cycle.
00:14:21.690 - 00:14:55.222, Speaker C: And even though the dollar values are down and now some of the volumes are down, it's still a higher low versus the previous cycle number one. And number two, there's sturdier foundations because of the capital talent and just compounding growth of open source. I guess it's like a crypto twist on Jeff Bezos'quip on the stock market and I think Bezos, Warren Buffett, maybe it's a few folks he can attribute this to about the market being a voting machine versus a weighing station.
00:14:55.286 - 00:14:55.562, Speaker A: Right.
00:14:55.616 - 00:15:37.574, Speaker C: In the long term versus the short term, they're two different things. And we're certainly seeing a lot of people vote for the exit right now. But the weight of crypto is still getting heavier and heavier, right. And I don't think that that's going to change. It's going to be very difficult to displace. So that's one thing that I come back to. And for someone that's been through multiple cycles, it's somewhat easier to feel a little bit of relief right now because you almost feel like the air is near fully out of the balloon, and you can kind of get back to okay, now that the tide has kind of washed out, you see not only who's swimming naked, but where all the dead bodies are.
00:15:37.574 - 00:16:00.670, Speaker C: And now you know what was real and what is going to have some staying power that you can build around for the next cycle. And we've seen that in 2013 and 2014, in 2017 and 2018, and we're going to see it again in 21, 22. So I think that's glass half full, I think a thing that makes crypto pretty powerful.
00:16:01.090 - 00:17:02.434, Speaker B: And on that note of looking backwards as to some of the things that we said previously in previous market cycles, I just wanted to pull out this quote from the surviving winter, redo, redux and you were citing yourself that you had written at the top of the bull market. I just want to pull this out here. In addition to eating big paper or real losses, you'll see people having breakdowns, go bankrupt due to over leverage or poor tax planning, quit otherwise promising projects, turn nasty, depressed or apathetic, and generally lose sight of the longer term potential of crypto. At the same time, the grassroots crypto herd will thin out because it's tougher to wage war when you've lost 90% of your savings and need to find a real job. This was actually not a part of your thesis document. This was you citing an earlier thing that you wrote at this top of the bull market. And then you continue in this thesis for 2023 and you ask the reader, do you still believe if you're reading this report, there's a good chance that you do, but are now wondering how to best navigate a prolonged winter? The answer is as simple as it is challenging and unglamorous build.
00:17:02.434 - 00:17:34.960, Speaker B: In many respects, it's easier to build in bear markets than bull markets. There are fewer distractions. Real product market fit becomes easier to identify without the noise of a token. And the weak and flaky contributors wash out of the market. Ryan, I could tell from this section in this document, and just knowing you, bear markets excite you, and maybe you could pass a little bit of that excitement on to the listener. Why should they get excited to build during a bear market? And why is this just another part of the crypto cycles that people that have seen a thing or two like you just know what's up?
00:17:35.730 - 00:18:33.630, Speaker C: Well, I would phrase it slightly differently. I'd say the slope of enlightenment excites me, right. I don't take any joy in seeing my personal net worth go down or seeing people get blown up or all the investors. Yeah, exactly. I'm not like some of these Twitter space hosts, right, that are just like doom porning, just shamelessly and kind of capitalizing on the situation. I think it's somewhat disgusting for people to get some pleasure out of this. So I certainly wouldn't say that that part of the bear market, the steep decline, right? This catastrophe that we've had this year is enjoyable, but when you do find a bottom, it's not going to be a V shaped recovery and some people are going to get apathetic and they'll wash out, but for the rest of us, that's when it feels like, okay, we're on more stable ground.
00:18:33.630 - 00:19:26.386, Speaker C: All of the folks that we didn't really think were going to be here for the long term if washed out and the people that we were jiving with and that we thought were going to be long term builders and contributors and were doing things for the right reasons and really excited about them for the right reasons, they're still here. And by the way, now they're getting a lot more oxygen and attention. That's, I think, the exciting part. And if you kind of come in with that mindset, there's plenty of problems to solve within the industry. And every single cycle, the biggest problems from the previous cycle tend to be solved and the solutions providers end up having the next unicorns in the cycle that ensues. So it's a pretty good entrepreneurial feedback loop, actually, if you're looking for ideas and if you're actually committed to the.
00:19:26.408 - 00:20:08.254, Speaker B: Long term, I think that's worth just emphasizing is that this product feedback cycle and being able to build inside of a bear market where you have so much signal is unique. It's a unique opportunity during the parts of the cycles, during you don't get that in the manic part of the cycle. What you do get in the bear market is a lot of signal for product builders to understand that they are actually building something inherently useful and to also take some of the idealized features of what made a mania. A mania NFTs, for example, and actually execute on that while shedding some of the short term things that only actually last in the peak of a bull market.
00:20:08.372 - 00:20:38.598, Speaker A: All right, so Selkus ten people to watch. All right, we're in the bear market. In this build season, of course. Who should we be watching right now? I noticed one of your picks were two exchange operators, CZ and Brian Armstrong, and you tied them. They're tied for the number one leaders of the two largest central exchanges left. The central exchanges left. Can you believe SBF would have been on this list a year ago? Probably now completely gone.
00:20:38.598 - 00:20:46.426, Speaker A: But coinbase and binance. So why these two? Why are they two individuals to watch particularly coming out of this year?
00:20:46.608 - 00:21:50.202, Speaker C: Well, it's interesting you say that because last year in the report I did refer to Coinbase, Binance and FTX as the three biggest exchanges to watch. Maybe we were watching it collapse. We were definitely watching for all the wrong think, you know, looking backwards. FTX probably had the most hype institutional momentum and political momentum out of the three that's obviously come crashing down and been exposed to be a hassle cards. The other two remain, but the other two are front and center for I would argue, the right reasons and that's because of their volumes and trading dominance being finance and then their custody market share being Coinbase. Right? Because Coinbase is a mega custodian in its own right, but it also custodies the Grayscale Trust. So it has 11% of all the bitcoin in circulation, 16% of all the ETH, 11% of maybe the other camp of cryptos.
00:21:50.202 - 00:22:36.634, Speaker C: So it is just a massive market participant, which everybody knows. But just to put that in perspective, you are talking about 10% of the economy in crypto essentially is safeguarded by Coinbase. So how those two CEOs kind of navigate the next couple of years I think is going to be pretty critical. And for CZ I think the challenges are really going to be headline risk related and regulatory and legal in nature. I think that there's a lot of fear, uncertainty, doubt around Binance right now. We've seen this in the last couple of weeks really pick up steam. And my nuanced take of whether that's good or bad is I think it's overblown.
00:22:36.634 - 00:23:33.470, Speaker C: I think the, the FUD is overblown, but I think it's good if it reduces that market share and it, it disperses some of that trading volume because it is, I think, unhealthy for the industry to have that much reliance on kind of one centralized exchange. And I would actually argue that for Binance they will be healthier if there are several other very large competitors that are kind of going back and forth with them. In terms of the volume lead. With Coinbase it's somewhat similar, but I think their fate and really their success is going to hinge on the US regulatory situation and how effectively they're able to thread the needle the next couple of years. Assuming that we don't get comprehensive legislation, I don't expect that we're going to get comprehensive oversight legislation basically until we have a new administration and we can maybe get into that in the policy section.
00:23:34.610 - 00:24:13.360, Speaker B: The next character that we wanted to pull out of this section is that was number one. Number one tied for first with CZ and Brian Armstrong. I wanted to skip over to number five, Anatoly Yakovnko, and the quote that I really liked here was that I saw firsthand how hard it was to kill Anatoli and his team in the last bear market. In my eyes, that's a leading predictor of long term success in crypto. As such, I'd expect the Solana core team and ecosystem to persevere once again. But can they ascend to new heights? Ryan Selkis, could you unpack a little bit as to how and why you put Anatoli and Salana as the number five person to watch in 2023?
00:24:14.370 - 00:24:56.202, Speaker C: I think that they were or are the largest Alt L One community that isn't EVM compatible. Right. So in terms of other base layer blockchains that are using a fundamentally different design than Ethereum, I think Salana has been the project to watch and it certainly attracted arguably the second most developer attention outside of Ethereum. It had an absolutely crazy Parabolic run in 2021. But there's also been quite a bit of innovation around that community. And interestingly, they've made a big effort in mobile. Right.
00:24:56.202 - 00:26:20.246, Speaker C: I think what they're doing with the Solana phone and the Solana mobile stack is a differentiator and it is pretty interesting in attracting developer talent if you're excited about bringing crypto to the masses through handheld devices, because you can't necessarily trust Apple and Android are going to let those apps through. So I think for those reasons, it is in a league of its own. In some respects. You can look at where it stands from a market cap ranking now, and it's obviously slid pretty significantly, especially given the size of stake that FTX had, a lot of those early investors. There could be some overhang, some sell side pressure that's still kind of embedded in that ecosystem when you're just talking about the token, but when you're talking about the developers and the tech, I would say that they are the leading contender for the second crypto operating system, if you will. Cosmos being kind of similarly situated, maybe slightly behind. And traditionally that's what you've seen in mobile in the browser wars, in PC operating systems, you've seen two major players and this duopoly, and then basically a pretty steep order of magnitude drop off for the other players after that.
00:26:20.246 - 00:26:26.710, Speaker C: So will they be able to consolidate some of that market ownership around this second Alts L One stack?
00:26:27.290 - 00:26:49.438, Speaker A: So on this people to watch thing, right, what's interesting is how quickly people in this industry can go from like hero to villain. Right? So last year on your list, Doe Kwan actually made number ten. And these are people to watch. These are not necessarily people that I know. You are saying like, yeah, I don't.
00:26:49.444 - 00:26:54.960, Speaker C: Know if people want to be not necessarily a good thing. Yeah. This is like the si curse or the madden curse I feel.
00:26:55.670 - 00:26:58.882, Speaker A: But also, Sam was on it two years ago.
00:26:58.936 - 00:27:00.082, Speaker C: Barry was on it two years ago.
00:27:00.136 - 00:28:14.602, Speaker A: Suzu, Kyle, Simone, what do you make of this? Right? It's like it's just this whole people to watch. There's an element of, yes, I totally agree. Brian Armstrong and CZ are people to watch. We want to understand kind of what they're saying. And also a major mistake, I feel like we've made this bull cycle is we paid too much attention to these demagogues and to these Icarus hubris types of individuals who kind of rallied populist messages and Twitter armies, all of these things. So I agree that we want to watch people, but also, what do you make of that dimension? Should we be not watching people? Should the actual people that we watch, should it just be the protocols? Or what is this interplay between people and code and the tech and how much this industry is led by leaders versus how much we want it to be in the hands of individuals and completely decentralized? It's just a thought for you because it's so interesting to see how quickly in this space, people you thought were Pinnacle, right? I mean, SBF coming into 2022, this guy was unstoppable. This guy was somebody that Brian Armstrong and CZ could not stop.
00:28:14.602 - 00:28:22.080, Speaker A: And now where is he? He's literally in jail as we're recording this. How the mighty fall so quickly. What are your reflections on that?
00:28:22.690 - 00:29:08.950, Speaker C: Well, Don't Do Meth is number one or whatever amphetamine he was on. I don't want to get sued for mislabeling the drug he was on. Well, it's interesting. So I have a couple of thoughts here. One, if you're talking about relatively static tech or static ecosystems, I know the Bitcoin community is going to skewer me for this, but then you don't need leaders as much. Right? Then it is much more community driven. I think Satoshi was able to disappear, and Bitcoin is operating just fine, and it has had some major upgrades over the years, but it has not truly had a leader since he disappeared.
00:29:08.950 - 00:29:56.010, Speaker C: Right. Ethereum, as decentralized as community is vitalik is still the figurehead and the leader and the person that people look to. He's kind of the culture standard setter for that community and still sets the vision in large part. And I think when you look at People to Watch is pretty much shorthand for what does that person represent? Right. In Brian and CZ's case this year, it's like, okay, the two exchange operators that have the biggest targets on their back, and they're holding the greatest weight of the industry on their shoulders. Right. So I think thematically, they fit as, like, the people to watch is the canaries and the coal mine.
00:29:56.010 - 00:30:36.226, Speaker C: But I think looking backwards at who's risen and who's fallen, it is, I think, good to draw lessons from history. Right? So SBF. Was on the list. Do Kwan was on the list. In prior years, Suzu was on the list. But they flew too close to the sun and they overextended or got greedy or made some catastrophic error in judgment or in some way, shape or form judgment, ethics or business or otherwise. There are other people that have been hit hard, but it's just because the market corrected viciously.
00:30:36.226 - 00:31:18.610, Speaker C: Right? So you mentioned Kyle CMS holdings. They were in that same category as Suzu. Look, I'm sure they, like us, probably lost a lot of money this year, but they didn't get extinguished, right? Because they weren't over levered and they're still operating. I'm sure they're going to get through this cycle and still be here for the long term. So it's interesting to kind of draw lessons from like, okay, who flamed out spectacularly versus who was just at such a high that they basically had nowhere to go but correct in the next year. Those people I don't really think are targets for dunks. The ones that were on a pedestal had everything, the world, in their hands and then got knocked off from their own hubris.
00:31:18.610 - 00:31:53.006, Speaker C: Big difference, right? Fair game. And I think it's good that we have those case studies each cycle so that people can point to priors and say, this person is reminding me I'm pattern matching a little bit too much with this new person that looks and feels a lot like Mark Carpellas did or looks and feels a lot like SBF did or Doe Kwan did or whatever. But because our history is speedrun, we don't even need to go to the outside world for examples. Usually there's like a crypto equivalent that.
00:31:53.028 - 00:32:05.620, Speaker A: People can tie back, really, another person, by the way, I'd really love to get your thoughts on later in the show is Barry Silbert because he's sort of somewhere that's not maybe somewhat in the middle of these things, right?
00:32:05.990 - 00:32:12.690, Speaker C: Well, I'm not going to comment on him in particular for different reasons, but I'll comment on the situation at DCG.
00:32:12.770 - 00:32:15.286, Speaker A: Let's definitely get to that later. But David, you want to keep us moving?
00:32:15.388 - 00:33:08.280, Speaker B: That actually is exactly where we are going next, because the next section here is Top Ten Trends in CFI and what was 2022 other than contagion across CFI Lending Desks and Ryan Selkis. This first section that you bring up is called Anatomy of a Crypto Credit Crisis. And it's got this great graphic that I'll show on screen here in a second. The quote that I really liked that you opened with is the grayscale trade, the GBDC trade. We've talked about this a little bit on Bankless. The grayscale trade, aka crypto's widowmaker, was integral in helping create much of the crypto contagion we saw this year, starting with Grayscale and GBTC. Can you walk us through this flowchart that you've put into your TC stock that we're also looking at on screen? Can you walk us through this autopsy like what happened in 2022?
00:33:09.950 - 00:34:03.226, Speaker C: Well, I'll start with the punchline, which is this is all the SEC's fault. And I truly mean so basically, Grayscale came public and offered these trust products, was able to raise money from accredited investors. Those accredited investors could create shares of GBTC by sending Grayscale bitcoin. And they took those shares public through something called Rule 144. It's kind of like a side door ETF. With an ETF, you can create and redeem baskets of shares daily, right? So these synthetic instruments, these shares, are going to map basically one to one with whatever the value. The bitcoin is that's in the trusts, through Rule 144, you had this bifurcation of the market where accredited investors can create shares, but then they have to wait six months and then they can sell them.
00:34:03.226 - 00:35:15.082, Speaker C: And that's when retail investors can get their hands on them. For a while, there was more demand than supply for the shares because people wanted them in their 401 KS or there just wasn't really public market access to bitcoin exposure for a long time. And so for years, you had a 1020 30, 50% premium at times on GBTC shares versus the underlying value. Some funds, including Three Arrows Capital and Blockfly, saw that and started to think, well, we can just run this trade over and over again and clip the premium every six months. And then in 2018, there were the introduction of the crypto lending desks, and that included Genesis Capital, which is a sister company of Grayscale, and all under the same DCG umbrella. But basically, we got into a situation in 2021 where Three Arrows Capital and Blockfly borrowed or created new shares of GBTC with leverage, whether it was with outside lenders or with Genesis Capital, slammed this trade. And then all of a sudden, the premium started to slowly collapse.
00:35:15.082 - 00:36:02.042, Speaker C: And as soon as it started to come down, it fell off a cliff because one of those entities or some of those investors that were hitting that trade decided to offload their entire position. And in February 2021, that premium went from about a 25% premium to a 15 20% discount in the matter of like a week. So it essentially killed the trade. And again, it turned this Grayscale trade, which was a profitable trade, but not arbitrage, because you were taking duration risk, time risk, and it turned it into what we call the widowmaker trade. At that .3, AC and Blockfly had a combined about $4 billion worth of GBTC shares. So now those levered positions are underwater versus the underlying trust assets.
00:36:02.042 - 00:37:08.770, Speaker C: But again, because this isn't an ETF, the only path to liquidity is through the shares, right? In an ETF, you would be able to, if you had a discount like this, persist, redeem those shares for the trust assets. That doesn't happen through Rule 144. It hypothetically could, but that's a longer, more detailed story that's kind of buried in the report. But the long and short of it is now you've got these lenders or these borrowers in size that borrowed a ton of money to create this Grayscale trade. Now they're impaired to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. The only lender in the market perhaps that would have looked at them as somewhat creditworthy would have to be an entity that's related to Grayscale because from their perspective, Genesis Capital, it's money from one pocket to the other, right? They know that their sister company has the assets in the Grayscale Trust. They know that whether it's six months from now, five years from now, grayscale controls the redemption mechanism.
00:37:08.770 - 00:38:07.414, Speaker C: So they would be able to look a little bit more favorably upon GBTC shares now as collateral instead of the underlying bitcoin. And so this is where the spiral started because Three Arrows Capital, I think blockfly to a lesser extent, but especially three AC, began to basically just roll the trade over and say, you know what, we're going to just roll all these underwater shares with Genesis Capital. And if you're Genesis Capital, you're like, this is great business. Because if you charge in three AC 5% a year on $2 billion in shares, that's a good line of business. And that's basically an annuity. It's like $100 million a year guaranteed in captive as long as that discount persists unless and until like an ETF is approved and that window would close. So it created this really kind of weird dynamic in the market and I think it was one of the first things that really set off some risk for three AC.
00:38:07.414 - 00:39:07.980, Speaker C: Now, having said all that, I don't think that there's anything that this is really kind of a comedy of errors or just like a perfect storm, right, the sequence that happened because that by itself would not have been enough to do in Three Arrows Capital, right? They had to make another couple of really bad toxic synthetic bets in Luna Terra and then in Stake D Thief in Q two of this year that ultimately put them under. But remember, I mean, they were in Avalanche. It seemed like they could do no wrong with all their other crypto related trades and investments in 2021. So even that big number, $100 million a year in interest, if that's what it was. Right? I'm just using it as a ballpark that would have been easy to absorb in the context of what people thought was a $10 billion fund. But you fast forward and you get to Q two of this year, Luna collapses. It turns three AC bad and then the bad credit really starts to just line up like domino's, one after the other.
00:39:07.980 - 00:39:48.220, Speaker C: That ultimately creates forces Genesis to reclaim or kind of call all the collateral, the GBTC shares that three AC had pledged as collateral in this trade. It ultimately still leaves a hole in the Genesis balance sheet. There's a crisis in confidence in BlockFi. At the same time there's a run on BlockFi. Voyager has a bunch of exposure to three ACS. Some of the other lenders kind of all go under, one after the other after the other, and then we have a little bit of a breather. Right, so it looks like all the bad credit is washed out in Q Two.
00:39:48.220 - 00:40:28.014, Speaker C: But we come to find out months later that wasn't quite the full story because we still had to deal with this backstop between Digital Currency Group and Genesis. When Genesis had this billion dollar hole blown in it from three ACS bankruptcy, DCG absorbed the liability and then they had an inter company loan. And now that's kind of created some issues in the aftermath of the FTX collapse and some withdrawal, rapid withdrawals from Genesis on the part of their creditors that's created a run in the bank with Genesis, which could impact both Genesis and DCG.
00:40:28.062 - 00:40:58.110, Speaker A: What do you think is going to happen to that, Ryan? The DCG empire? I mean, that's kind of the last thing people are well, hopefully the last thing people are trying to figure out from this massive contagion event of 2022. Is DCG going to be able to make it? And if so, sort of how people still can't, if any retail listeners listening who deposited into the Gemini Earn account, they still can't withdraw their funds. And that's all wrapped up into this, too. Do you have any takes on how this might unfold?
00:40:58.770 - 00:42:38.090, Speaker C: I think it's actually pretty promising that we haven't seen any bankruptcy filings or proceedings or anything like that in the last few weeks. We're outside of the 30 day window, that's kind of standard in some kind of cure periods, depending on the lender. You don't know what the specific agreements were between Genesis and its creditors or DCG and Genesis. All that's a little bit of a black box. So we'd run some analyses just based on public information on DCG and Grayscale and then what we knew about the Genesis fundraising needs. And basically you come out to a situation where DCG could either recapitalize the business, but at a 90% reduction in equity value versus where they raised money last year, or you reach a resolution with the Genesis creditors directly. And at this point, given the market softness and how multiples are coming down and how people have cooled on crypto and this being a distressed situation, I think the path to a resolution here probably swings on whether the creditors are able to make a good offer, and they're able to come to a resolution where Genesis creditors take some partial liquidity today and then maybe roll some of their exposure into DCG or otherwise have kind of upside and can be made whole through the other healthy businesses and healthy assets that are under the DCG umbrella.
00:42:38.170 - 00:42:44.100, Speaker A: So you think they're going to make it? You think the probability is that they could make it? Through this.
00:42:44.870 - 00:43:22.750, Speaker C: I don't want to speculate. So I'll be coy and I'll say 50 50. I think it's a coin flip. The issue is, remember, right now DCG has two different options. One, you try your hand in court and try to limit the liability that you have with this bad subsidiary and you basically let them go other. So that's kind of like the hardball play. It's very risky because DCG was itself a borrower from Genesis, so they are one step removed from owing all these creditors capital.
00:43:22.750 - 00:43:54.710, Speaker C: The other is there's some resolution with the creditors. And so it's a little bit of a game of chicken chess, whatever you want to call it. But it's not as if a resolution with creditors is a panacea for DCG because it's still going to create a new massive either liability or preferred instrument at the holding company level that could hypothetically wipe out a good chunk of equity value if things go sideways in next few years for DCG.
00:43:55.610 - 00:44:21.360, Speaker B: So I think that answers a big question that I kind of had, which was is this whole potential DCG bankruptcy going to overhang the crypto industry kind of in the same way that Mount Gox did for so long, in a way still does. And from what the tone I'm hearing from you is that it's not really going to overhang all that much. Maybe there's some bad stuff, but overhanging cell pressure, not that much.
00:44:23.810 - 00:45:26.200, Speaker C: I think that there are some similarities in the reaction, not in the structure, right? These are totally, totally different stories. But in terms of the damage it has done, potentially in the worst case scenarios of this resolution are somewhat similar to the worst case reactions that we saw after Malcox, right? Like Malcox was not it actually wasn't that damaging at the time because from a market pressure standpoint, because the funds had been slowly led away over the course of years, right. And people just didn't know that the funds weren't there. So it was a disaster for everyone that lost money. Right. But it was not necessarily like a situation where you just saw hundreds of millions of bitcoin hit the market and kind of instantly become sellable because they were hacked with this situation. And then in the aftermath of Mount Gox, we got the bit license and we got a bunch of jurisdictions become hostile to crypto and took quite a bit of time for us to make progress after that.
00:45:26.200 - 00:46:14.894, Speaker C: I think with the DCG Genesis situation, one of the issues that we're confronting with this and one of the reasons I think we need like a good positive resolution is you've got Gemini as one of the primary creditors. Gemini earn customers are owed about $900 million. So now you're pulling in US retail. There's another similar earn like program that I think was just reported on last week through a European exchange bitvavo where they have 300 million in a similar earn like, program. So that could potentially pull in the European regulators. Right? And we're running out of bodies right now, like, warm bodies, and leaders in the industry. And DCG is extremely well connected.
00:46:14.894 - 00:46:59.202, Speaker C: They've got Larry Summers as an advisor. They've got Glenn Hutchins, who's golfing budies with Obama on their board. And then Gemini is one of the best regulated exchanges and custodians in the US. So you're starting to lose just, like, one too many chess pieces on the chessboard in terms of the adults in the room, if you can't figure out if there can't be some kind of adequate resolution here. So I don't think about it as economically damaging in terms of, like, there's more credit contagion risk still in the market. I think that's probably mostly washed out. But now we're at the part of the cycle where the black eyes are going to be potentially permanent in nature if they get encoded into law.
00:46:59.202 - 00:47:04.226, Speaker C: And I think that's the biggest concern right now and the reason everybody should be rooting for some amicable resolution here.
00:47:04.328 - 00:47:40.590, Speaker A: Okay, so this is the top trends in DeFi just to CFI. Excuse me, the top trends in CFI. And just to wrap this in a bow, you called the grayscale trade the widowmaker, but you also said this was all the SEC's fault, all Gary Gensler's fault. Could Gary have really waved a magic wand and just convert that GBTC thing into an ETF? And this whole Arbitrage mess crap, all the fallout would have been solved. I know that doesn't help FTX necessarily, and all of the other contagion, but would that have made the widowmaker not make any widows?
00:47:42.530 - 00:47:45.220, Speaker C: If we had a Spot ETF, none of this would have happened.
00:47:45.670 - 00:47:46.740, Speaker A: None of it.
00:47:47.350 - 00:47:53.860, Speaker B: What do you mean, none of this? 30 capital wouldn't have over leveraged. Sam Bankman Fried would have been a fraud. Or, like, what?
00:47:55.210 - 00:48:59.258, Speaker C: Think about the impairment that three AC had, right? You're talking about mid nine figures worth of impairment, plus all of the interest payment that they had as they had to continue to borrow against these shares over the course of the last year. So this was a significant kind of dead weight loss for them. But the flip side is, I'm sure they made money on it in the beginning. The fact remains that this asset being publicly tradable. I mean, at its peak, it was a $40 billion trust, right, that retail investors are able to invest in. And it's just become like hot potato collateral for many of the entities that have blown up or face significant distress this year. And at the end of the day, who's holding the bag? It's a bunch of folks that are holding GBTC and their retirement accounts, right? There's almost a million GBTC shareholders that would benefit from the conversion to an ETF, which is the equivalent of a snap of the fingers of the SEC.
00:48:59.258 - 00:49:10.890, Speaker C: It just has to do with treating Spot ETFs. The same way they treat these insane CFDC derived derivative ETF, these futures ETFs that are garbage.
00:49:11.230 - 00:49:33.650, Speaker A: Do you think, Ryan, that Gensler looked at this and was just know, I don't know, evil villain in kind of an armchair somewhere and just like, let them burn? That's what crypto gets. Like, I could fix this, but I won't? Is it that sort of nefariousness going on here? Do you think he really has it in for the industry? Or is this all bureaucracy and just couldn't get to the ETF?
00:49:34.470 - 00:50:38.710, Speaker C: I'll give the conniving version and then from the most charitable version, I guess for someone like Chair Gensler, the most charitable version is we are not going to break policy, which is we don't have oversight of the exchanges that are trading these spot instruments, and we're certainly not going to reward bad behavior. So just because this trade existed and it created a bunch of problems, that is not our doing. Right. This was a loophole that was exploited. You've made your bed, now lay in it. That's, I think, the one hand, and essentially it's just default. No, the other is that this setback and this continued pain is arguably a good thing because it backs their position and it just shows the other policymakers that they're trying to convince.
00:50:38.710 - 00:51:31.020, Speaker C: Look, this is how unwieldy this crypto market is. We need full oversight of all of the centralized players. And these things are either securities or having an impact on the securities market. So it makes sense to empower XYZ regulator that already has this oversight responsibility in these other adjacent areas with the same power so we can clean this up. Unfortunately, I don't really see there being a resolution anytime soon. But now you've got a situation where GBTC shareholders are 50% underwater and the only people that win are counterintuitively. It's DCG through grayscale, right? Because they're still making their $300 million a year on these trusts and the SEC, because they're able to play hardball and use this as a negotiating chip for their long term position.
00:51:31.470 - 00:52:03.282, Speaker B: Well, I think this underhands us right into this policy conversation, the policy section. So, tying a bow on the ten trends of CFI, we're going to go into the trends in crypto policy. And there's a number of sections in here all about SBF and the insider baseball. Without giving too much of the juicy details away, Ryan Selkes, can you kind of just like I know you are very involved with policy in Capitol Hill and that whole world, can you kind of just summarize the insider baseball that was going on that we are still learning about to this day?
00:52:03.336 - 00:52:26.106, Speaker A: Yeah. What happened? SBF wrote that post. There's talk of the Dccpa. We had him debate on Voorhees, on the podcast defending that position, and eleven days later, he turns out to be short $10 billion. What happened?
00:52:26.288 - 00:53:02.902, Speaker C: Well, I think that's the last 20% of the write up, because this really started in the fall. I think even folks within kind of DC policy circles for a while underestimated how far the FTX team had been able to push Dccpa. Right. This stabbing out Bozeman bill, and it really started to become more apparent. In September, we actually hosted a policy dinner around Mainnet and supposed to just be kind of a celebratory dinner. Look how far we've come since the infrastructure bill. We had a bunch of speakers in town that were from the policy side.
00:53:02.902 - 00:54:45.362, Speaker C: So someone dropped a bomb during the dinner and essentially said, can we just talk about the elephant in the room? Sam's trying to sell out the industry and create a monopoly for it was it was wild. You could have heard a pin drop type of moment, but it ended up being very healthy because you got a lot of people talking for all reasons, right? It was an interesting night after that, but in the aftermath of that, I think people kind of woke up to how close they were getting. And several people, myself included, started to push Sam and the FTX team to start being a little bit more open with some of the other groups, particularly those in the DeFi side. And so there was a number of meetings that the casual armchair observer on Twitter is going to say, oh, it's a smoke filled room, or it's this or that or the other thing. It's like, no, you had a situation where one entity was making enormous strides because of all the political investments they'd made, and a lot of people were not necessarily in tune. And a lot of those other people that were able to get in touch and start comparing notes with FTX after this dinner and after these meetings were representatives of major DeFi projects or some of the other major trade associations. And the hope was that we were going to be able to make some progress on the DeFi language in Dccpa as drafted.
00:54:45.362 - 00:55:33.538, Speaker C: Then when things leaked, all hell kind of broke loose. Sam couldn't stop talking about it and the circle retightened and what there's I'm not going to name names, but there's a couple people in the industry that are patting themselves on the back for basically like, oh, it took down SBF by doing this. We stopped the Dccpa because we kind of blew the whistle on this and brought the fight to crypto Twitter. I'm telling you right now, that's nonsense. The thing that stopped the Dccpa is the it was it had nothing to do with the leak. The only thing that the leak did was tighten the circle of people that were going to contribute from that on out. And it could have been pretty damaging if this has gotten pushed through the lame duck.
00:55:33.538 - 00:55:47.018, Speaker C: So we dodged a bull. We got lucky, I think, with FTX. And I'm not going to really spend much time arguing counterfactuals, but I had a few people call me out. And so I decided to do the full post mortem since I was in some of those rooms. And that's what happened.
00:55:47.104 - 00:56:24.520, Speaker A: Yeah, I haven't read all of that and that's so interesting to me. But zooming out. Was SBF really just kind of a puppeteer trying to control the strings in DC and benefit his own exchange over DeFi? Was he basically pulling up the ladder after Know climbed up it, pulling it up for everyone else? Was there something nefarious going on here, or is that not the case? It's just very tempting to look at everything he's doing now under that lens and be like, wow, this guy is you called him political investments. It's basically campaign donations, right?
00:56:24.890 - 00:56:30.994, Speaker C: Yeah. Look, I think he was playing a game, right. And by the way, he was playing it very well, right?
00:56:31.052 - 00:56:34.122, Speaker A: Regardless of just like a machiavellian type game.
00:56:34.176 - 00:57:05.294, Speaker C: Yeah, it was a very machiavellian type game. I think that he was looking out for his own self interest, but every single company that lobbies and every single company that is kind of advocating for themselves on the policy side is doing that out of self interest. Right now. There's operating out of self interest and then there's operating out of self interest and only self interest. Right. And I think that's a difference with some of the other big crypto companies. You've seen Brian Armstrong tweet about not pulling the ladder up on DeFi.
00:57:05.294 - 00:58:07.798, Speaker C: Right. We have to protect he has every incentive to make sure that good exchange oversight legislation gets passed because he is the incumbent. Coinbase is the incumbent. But if that's going to be at the expense of all the long term innovation in the industry, I think he recognizes, for instance, that's to the long term detriment of his business as well, because you're talking about the growth of the industry, FTX was a little bit different because they also had this relationship with IEX. And Tom Emmer has been all over this. You guys should listen to the interview that Representative Tom Emmer just did with Nick Carter and the on the Brink podcast. But he goes off and it sounds like he wants to go after Chair Gensler Hard in the new year, but essentially saying, you know, okay, there's all these self dealings between this securities, know IEX and know, were they? Basically lobbying for FTX to have CFTC oversight and then IEX to have a monopoly over the crypto securities market.
00:58:07.798 - 00:58:39.858, Speaker C: And then these two would be joined at the Hip. They'd have a de facto monopoly and the whole thing. And yeah, I don't know, maybe that's a possibility. My point in writing this is there was not a single piece of Sam's business that he didn't know exactly what was going on. He is extremely smart. He thought that he knew, like, he thought that he saw the entire chessboard. He seemed to have his finger on the pulse of kind of the politics of the situation and this particular bill.
00:58:39.858 - 00:59:20.682, Speaker C: And when he was in meetings with his policy team, the policy team was the supporting cast. He was the one predominantly that spoke and kind of led the discussion. So it's not like he was kind of following the advice of the folks in his policy team. I'm sure he was right, but he was also very much leading these discussions and he seemed to just enjoy it. So I find it hard to believe that he was so detail oriented and meticulous and 3D chess 4D chess oriented in this regard, but somehow missed everything else in his $8 billion balance sheet hole.
00:59:20.746 - 00:59:32.974, Speaker A: And I remember, I would imagine everyone in DC is just like, who's been associated with him is just kind of running in the opposite direction now, trying to distance themselves. Is that what's going on? Maybe distance themselves from crypto? Who knows? It's maybe some of the clock.
00:59:33.022 - 01:00:19.700, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, we've got, like, long term damage control, right? So I think the only thing that's going to help that is time. Now, the most important win this year on the policy side is that this didn't become law. The next couple of years, I think, unfortunately, are going to be a little bit of a war of attrition. It's going to be trench warfare. A lot of legal fights warding off enforcement actions and regulation by enforcement from the SEC in particular, but also potentially from the CFTC in some cases. And we might not get comprehensive legislation for exchanges or for what constitutes a token versus a security or a commodity until we have a new administration in place.
01:00:19.700 - 01:00:52.814, Speaker C: The one exception potentially, I think, could be in the stablecoin realm, that maybe we'll see some positive, stablecoin action. There's always a chance that something more comprehensive gets done. But with the Republicans in control at the House and Democrats in control at the Senate, still, it seems more likely than not that this is going to be gridlocked, which, by the way, is probably a net positive right now, versus the alternative for some of the folks that have it out for us.
01:00:53.012 - 01:01:32.890, Speaker B: Certainly. Well, the idea that SBF was a leader and knew everything and was playing the board is in stark contrast to his public speaking tour after FF, which was, I don't know a damn thing about my own company, which was definitely the vibe that he was trying to get off. Ryan, we have so much more to cover. We got Bitcoin and Crypto dollars, top Ten Ethereum and Layer One Trends, trends in DFI, which, if I'm reading the lines, you are calling the DFI bottom. I got my own story to tell you about that one. We'll see how that works. Ryan so much more to come in the second half of the show right after we talk to you, some of these fantastic sponsors that help you go bankless Sequence is the all in one developer platform.
01:01:32.890 - 01:02:19.654, Speaker B: You. Need to build web3 games and applications for your users. Sequence is a smart wallet, and it's the easiest, most intuitive onboarding your users will ever experience and comes with all the features users need to feel empowered in the web3 world MultiChain support, NFT display and users can buy SFTS, NFTs and crypto directly with a credit or debit card.

Their APIs let you bring NFTs, SFTS, and tokens into your game or application, and a sequence relayer enables gasless transactions for your users. Sequence already powers some of the best web3 games like SkyWeaver, NFT projects like CoolCats and marketplaces like Nifty swap. And Sequence is compatible with all the EVM chains, including Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart chain, Arbitrum, Optimism and Avalanche.
01:02:19.654 - 01:03:01.490, Speaker B: So go to sequence XYZ bankless to start building or speak with a Sequence team. Today, TrueFi is DFI's largest credit protocol connecting global lenders with institutional grade lending opportunities. TrueFi has completed over $1.7 billion in originations and paid out nearly $35 million to lenders, proving that DFI is ready to take its next big leap into the $8 trillion credit market. TrueFi gives lenders like you access to sustainable, high yield opportunities backed by real world investments usually reserved for high net worth individuals. At the same time, fund managers use Trufi's financial infrastructure to bring their portfolios on chain benefiting from the global liquidity, cost savings and transparency of DeFi. TruFi is a decentralized financial utility.
01:03:01.490 - 01:03:43.582, Speaker B: The protocol is owned and governed by the TruFi Dao, and TruFi is here to bring DeFi into the golden age, bridging the power and access of crypto with institutional grade lending opportunities and portfolio. Tooling explore is a diverse financial opportunities available on TrueFi or launch your own portfolio at TrueFi. IO. The reality today is that five corporations control the entire world of social media. They own our names, they restrict our content, they monitor our every move, and their time is up, thanks to our sponsor, DSO. DSO is a layer one blockchain built from the ground up to decentralize and scale social networks. With DSO, you can own your own identity, content and social graph and take it with you across hundreds of applications already built on the censorship resistant DSO blockchain.
01:03:43.582 - 01:04:27.806, Speaker B: DSO storage advantages make it finally possible to build infinite state applications that can efficiently store and index large amounts of content and data fully on chain. Diesel also offers multiple crypto, native monetization, primitives for developers and creators, including social NFTs, social dows, social tokens, and social tipping. So in order to experience the social layer of web3, go to diesel.com and claim your username. That's deso.com. Ryan I want to start off the second half of the show with another quote out of the bitcoin and crypto dollars section in your 2020. Theses report and the quote begins with we will debate bitcoin's role in society for as long as it exists.
01:04:27.806 - 01:04:58.970, Speaker B: As bitcoin grows, I don't expect the powers that be to idly stand by without a fight, as it's been for a decade. Bitcoin's best defense will continue to be its inability to be held hostage by one charismatic leader. And its volatility and boringness will deflect attention in different ways. Ryan, looking forward into 2023, how do you expect the conversation around bitcoin to unfold? I really like this line. We will debate bitcoin's role in society for as long as it exists. What are we going to debate in 2023? What's bitcoin's role moving forward here?
01:04:59.120 - 01:05:44.486, Speaker C: Well, first off, I don't even remember writing that paragraph, so I'm partly terrified that I plagiarize it. And the other half is, like, maybe I was just, like, writing it in like a Stephen King, like, bender mode. But yeah, look, I think kind of going forward, bitcoin has benefited greatly from its boringness cycle to cycle, right? People just have such ridiculously short memories that every single passing cycle, it's the same exact thing. People underestimate Bitcoin, all the excitement is over here. All the application development is over here. This, that, the other thing. And it's just block by block by block.
01:05:44.486 - 01:06:06.306, Speaker C: The fees are relatively low. The community is crazy, so no one really pays attention to them. There's no one to go after. Right. In terms of, like, a figurehead, the core developers truly are decentralized and extremely tough to pin down for any type of you can't really put that much pressure on anyone.
01:06:06.408 - 01:06:11.438, Speaker A: It knows exactly what it wants to be when it grows up, and it's.
01:06:11.454 - 01:07:11.490, Speaker C: A borderline miraculous tech, right? And I think that's going to have staying power as a money. And we can argue about whether ethereum will surpass it or bitcoin will remain number one, but it will have staying power for that reason almost by itself in a really chaotic global environment. So, just like we saw in the last cycle, I expect that people are going to underestimate bitcoin call for the flipping. Maybe this will finally be your year, guys. I think that if you as a country or you as a company are going to think about like, a currency hedge, not an inflation hedge, but a currency hedge, then I think bitcoin still remains, like, the first choice. And then ethereum has probably moved into that number two spot.
01:07:11.650 - 01:07:43.802, Speaker B: Yeah, I certainly remember going through the 2017 to 2020 18 mania. And on the end of 2018, I definitely had more respect for bitcoin than I did at the start of 2017, that's for sure. And it's a little bit after the chaos of a collapse of crypto, of the collapse of the industry, the appreciation for one block every ten minutes definitely hits a little bit harder when we are down in the depths of a bear market. So I will give that one to you. I want to also, however, move on to the ethereum and layer one trends, and I just have a broad conversation.
01:07:43.866 - 01:07:49.486, Speaker C: Oh wow, we're going right over all the good stuff in the Bitcoin section. No surprise. No surprise.
01:07:49.598 - 01:08:22.560, Speaker B: Well, this actually isn't even diving into the ethereum part specifically. From your perspective from the outside of the ethereum community, which my Ryan and I find ourselves very in the middle of very frequently. How would you describe the landscape of smart contract chains going into 2023? Like, who are all the relevant players and who's showing strength? And with all of the alt layer one landscape, can the entire alt layer one landscape hold a candle to ethereum's layer two ecosystem? What's your take on just the smart contract landscape in 2023?
01:08:23.570 - 01:10:00.958, Speaker C: Well, I think you have to look at market cap, market dynamics, and then developer activity. I think you have to look at all three for signs of strength. I know that apps don't necessarily follow price, but price is what ultimately secures these proof of stake networks and that's also kind of an indication of community health. Right? It's the one barometer that you can kind of look at. It's not perfect, but it's directionally correct in terms of order, of magnitude, importance of the different ecosystems and then kind of the one A to that is the market dynamic, right? So this would be the changes to ethereum supply and the new Issuance schedule and the post merge economics of ethereum. And I think if you just look at those like that, one and one A, ethereum is just so far ahead of everybody else, right? Like in kind of a class of its own right now as a layer, one that you're really looking at, as I alluded to in the Anatoly comments earlier, you're looking at Ethereum and EVM compatible chains, whether that's roll ups, whether that's kind of this modularity thesis for different types of blockchains or whether you're looking at other EVM compatible like layer ones like Avalanche and others that have these bridges. I think no matter what, that is going to continue to be one of the dominant ecosystems and probably the dominant ecosystem for crypto, not named Bitcoin for the foreseeable future.
01:10:00.958 - 01:11:05.390, Speaker C: Right. Everybody else is kind of playing for second, especially post merge. Right. I think last year when we had this conversation, as you know, my quip on the merge was always take the over, whatever the date was, take the over and for a while that was money good. You'd make money hand over fist if you just always took the over when it came to when people anticipated the merge would come. But the fact that it came, the fact that it went off without a hitch, I mean, just miraculous, just one of the most impressive technical achievements of my career, my kind of professional life that I've seen. And it's something that I think solidifies ethereum for the long term in terms of not only the stability of the platform, but I think its attractiveness to other outside developers, right? Because that was such a hard problem to take on and such a tall mountain to scale.
01:11:05.390 - 01:11:41.722, Speaker C: I think there should be quite a bit of confidence that other equally tricky problems will get solved over time in a really thoughtful manner. So I don't underestimate that at all. And I think just Vitalik and the other core devs that spent years on this, they weren't the people to watch just because I didn't want to curse Vitalik. I was worried about the si. And I think Anatoly could probably not have much of a worse year than this year. So I think he's primed. Yeah, exactly.
01:11:41.722 - 01:11:46.542, Speaker C: But I think that those guys, I mean, just the bright spot in a really bleak year, for sure.
01:11:46.596 - 01:12:04.260, Speaker A: So, Ryan, can we just do this? All right, because we've had two cycles of the Meme ETH killer, Ethereum killer. Like, something is going to come kill Ethereum, right? Is that dead now? Are we going to have another ETH killer cycle the next cycle and oh, my God, repeat this whole thing. Not to say there won't be competitors with ETH, but, like, killing is different.
01:12:05.270 - 01:13:44.190, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the ETH killer cycle, now, everybody realizes it's not enough to kill ETH because the fees are high, right? And it's not enough to kill ETH because it's proof of work, right? Or it has this looming technical upgrade that's a bunch of smoke and mirrors and this perpetual motion machine. That's the roadmap that's done, right? That's in the rear view mirror. Now, there are still some challenges that need to be tackled, like the potential sensor ability issues around mev, and those are all on the roadmap. But I think that those are significantly less challenging than what we just saw in terms of the merge. So you're going to have to compete on fundamentally new use cases. So I'm not a very deeply technical person, but would some of these move oriented blockchains, right, the ones that spun out of the Facebook DM project, like Aptos and Sui, are they going to introduce some interesting applications? Is Solana going to introduce some interesting applications that just run better, faster, cheaper, and you just can't do them on Ethereum? Maybe. And then the other one to keep an eye on is, will the Cosmos app chain model ultimately attract more communities, more applications, because of the customizability of the app chains themselves? So dYdX like watching that experiment.
01:13:44.190 - 01:14:31.298, Speaker C: The next year. Their migration from a ZK roll up to an app chain on Cosmos is probably going to be the most important project for Ethereum killers proponents to watch, because that would be one sign that maybe some of the interesting use cases and some of the really scalable crypto apps are actually not going to be built on Ethereum. But maybe they'll move to something like the Cosmos DAP chain model. I don't know what the right answer is, but I would say those are the three that are covered in the report. In depth, ethereum, cosmos, salana. And then everything else is referenced and we cover probably about a dozen. Different layer ones and layer 1.5s
01:14:31.298 - 01:14:56.890, Speaker C: or whatever you want to call polygon, which had a pretty monstrous year in its own right in terms of some of its wins. But we cover all them on a quarterly basis. So those are alluded to and referenced, but I can only write so many pages. I did my best, but I know that there's going to be some communities that are pissed off. I already know that fucking Goon. He's going to DM me and be like, you didn't cover Avalanche again. Whatever.
01:14:56.890 - 01:15:01.420, Speaker C: I love you, Goon, but come on, then I wrote 170 pages in two weeks. Give me a break.
01:15:02.190 - 01:15:44.694, Speaker B: I do want to drill down on that app conversation because that brings us to the trends in DeFi. And there's one that I really wanted to pull out specifically because it hits home for me. And so I'll read one of the quotes here. Ethereum transaction fees are way down this year and the competitive dynamics with DApps have shifted. Uniswap, Lido and OpenSea, the three largest Ethereum based apps, now generate more monthly fees on a combined basis than the entire Ethereum layer one. Ave and Uniswap launched their protocols on various emerging networks this year and it came quickly to dominate their segments in terms of volumes in TVL. This shows that the shelling point for most users isn't around chain specific native versions of lending and decentralized exchanges, but of the top applications by user.
01:15:44.694 - 01:15:59.150, Speaker B: Just as Binance will likely steamroll the first top domestic Thai exchange in Thailand upon entrance into the country, ave is also likely to dominate in whatever digital country, aka a layer one it enters. Interesting, right?
01:15:59.220 - 01:15:59.454, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:15:59.492 - 01:16:19.142, Speaker B: And so then Ryan concludes the section. Mr. Selke says, why then does DFI still sit at all time lows versus ETH? I'm bullish on DFI dominance versus Ethereum in 2023, absent ham fisted new regulations. Ryan Selkis, are you calling the DFI bottom? Is that what's going on?
01:16:19.196 - 01:16:22.840, Speaker A: You've been saved. Celkus is coming to save your call.
01:16:23.210 - 01:17:26.234, Speaker C: Yeah, but I said it once, not like three times. Yeah, I think look, I personally own both, right? Is the way that I'd frame it. I think the reason to be bullish is because of the dominance and the feed generation of some of those DFI 1.0 apps, if you will, and their ability to, I think, accrue value for themselves and their communities long term. The reason to be bearish and kind of take the under on that is there are going to be significant regulatory headwinds still, right? That's like a known unknown. So you've got those countervailing forces. The reason I am much more relatively bullish maybe on DeFi than Ethereum, though, has to do with my mental model for both.
01:17:26.234 - 01:18:07.254, Speaker C: Right. So DFI is about 0.1 to 0.2% of the market cap and TVL of traditional financial services. So do I think that decentralized finances penetration in the real world is going to be more than one 3000 or whatever of the traditional financial system? I think the answer is yes. With Ethereum it's a slightly different calculation if people's mental model of Ether starts to change. Right.
01:18:07.254 - 01:19:28.850, Speaker C: So I made the point in know we're going to talk about either ETH is money in which case the sky's the limit. Right. Or Ethereum is a platform like the cloud computing platforms or like a distributed bank. Right now its economics as a platform look a lot more like a distributed bank than they do a distributed cloud computing platform in terms of margins, in terms of sustainability, of the fees and whatnot it is a transaction fee based kind of model that Ethereum has. If you kind of net out all the staking rewards. So if you think about Ethereum as the meta decentralized bank of crypto and financial settlement platform then its ceiling might be a little bit lower than the most bullish proponents think and DeFi's ceiling is probably significantly higher than I think a lot of people currently handicapped for. I think if we can get some resolution and some sandboxes around DeFi in the next couple of years in the US and Europe, we could be close to the bottom here, David.
01:19:28.850 - 01:19:31.460, Speaker C: And one of these days you might just be right.
01:19:32.470 - 01:20:02.254, Speaker A: So he's hoping for ryan, this has been great and look, we couldn't cover all 168 pages of this but we'll definitely make sure that folks have a link in the show notes at the end. But we could only touch upon a few things. Is there anything that really jumps out at you from the report that you just really were like guys, we should have talked about this. Tell us about that thing. What's something that you'd like to pull out for us toward the end of this as we begin to wrap up?
01:20:02.452 - 01:20:39.002, Speaker C: Well, I'll do a buy sell for NFTs and then Dows which are the last two sections that we didn't get to. So I think in the NFT and kind of metaverse space I'm pretty bullish on decentralized social applications and identity and pretty bearish on individual NFT projects. And GameFi. GameFi I think is the most overhyped, ridiculous trend, strong opinion, interesting, an absolute capital incinerator for years to come. Wow.
01:20:39.136 - 01:20:40.858, Speaker B: Van Spencer would like a word.
01:20:40.944 - 01:21:25.586, Speaker C: And I think NFTs are best thought of in aggregate versus as particular projects. Right? So I think that the picks and shovels businesses around NFTs will continue to do well. But the point that I make in here is Bitcoin in 2013 to 2017. If you do the digital gold versus physical gold comparison you could see its kind of steady march upwards and its market share kind of capture reflected the value of Bitcoin NFTs. I don't think the same thing is going to be true. I think that we will see like a ten X in the NFT market, but it will be because of a 1020 30 X increase in the number of projects and the number of supplies.
01:21:25.698 - 01:21:32.006, Speaker A: So you want to bet on the category, like the collectibles category rather than the Beanie Babies, right. Individual projects.
01:21:32.118 - 01:21:57.010, Speaker C: Yeah. Well, I think that's right, but I would also say that as a consumable primitive right. I think it's really important, but I just don't think that people should be thinking necessarily about NFTs writ large as an asset class. It might be better to think about them very specific niches like digital art. As an asset class. The example that I've used is your physical wardrobe. Right.
01:21:57.010 - 01:22:06.630, Speaker C: You buy fresh kicks or a new suit when you're ready to sell that thing, it's going to be $0.20 on the dollar. If you're lucky.
01:22:08.330 - 01:22:09.880, Speaker A: Give it to a thrift store.
01:22:11.450 - 01:22:25.500, Speaker C: Exactly. Right. And so that's kind of the model that I have. Could be wrong. We'll see, but I don't think so. And then on the dow side, I'm still Piper bullish on dows. We could do a whole episode on that.
01:22:25.500 - 01:22:54.418, Speaker C: So I'll gloss over that. But I think the one kind of critical area of investment next year, I expect we'll see an uptick in is what we call deepen, decentralized physical infrastructure networks. Cloud infrastructure companies are about $5 trillion of market cap. You guys want to guess where deepen is right now? If you include Filecoin, Rweave, Helium, Live, Peer, some of those projects okay, give.
01:22:54.424 - 01:22:55.202, Speaker A: Us the numbers again.
01:22:55.256 - 01:22:58.722, Speaker C: So what was 5 trillion for cloud?
01:22:58.856 - 01:22:59.358, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:22:59.464 - 01:23:01.074, Speaker C: What is the crypto equivalent?
01:23:01.122 - 01:23:02.946, Speaker B: This is under 5 billion.
01:23:03.058 - 01:23:08.534, Speaker A: I'm going to say yeah, I was going to say under ten, but I'll go under five because that sounds right.
01:23:08.652 - 01:23:09.718, Speaker C: About two and a half.
01:23:09.804 - 01:23:10.440, Speaker A: Wow.
01:23:11.150 - 01:23:59.782, Speaker C: So if you think about both the pressing need to decentralize our dependence on some of these big platforms and hardware networks, and just the just enormous revenue opportunity and the very clear unit economics here, too, by the way, of these projects, I'd expect that should be a good kind of tailwind for the industry. The question is how quickly will demand pick up for those decentralized networks? Because the supply side is largely figured out through token incentives. But can we continue to see good kind of steep growth like we have the last few quarters, even in the teeth of the bear market, in usage of some of those decentralized physical infrastructure networks? So that's a small sampling of the 95 and appreciate being able to run through it with you guys.
01:23:59.836 - 01:24:33.246, Speaker A: No, that's great. And maybe just to close us out, ryan, can you talk about 2023? So where do we go from here? You had this section somewhere in the report that talked about 2023 as a time we need to get back to crypto. Back to crypto in 2023. I think that's a good theme. If 2022 was pain, back to crypto is a great theme for 2023. And you said you want more personal wallets from my cold, dead hands rather than exchange margin accounts, which is bad. You want more privacy it's none of your business what I do than institutional adoption.
01:24:33.246 - 01:24:54.540, Speaker A: We could slow that process down. And you want permissionless? Financial and social applications. A live and let live policy versus ponzi economics. The frauds that we saw in 2022. So you want the real manifestations of this crypto vision, not the fakes. Wrap this up for us. What can we expect in 2023? What does back to crypto mean?
01:24:55.310 - 01:25:03.626, Speaker C: Well, first off, I did a fine replace of Web Three anywhere that it accidentally slipped through the cracks in the strap, killing it. I killed it.
01:25:03.648 - 01:25:05.382, Speaker A: What did you replace it with? Crypto.
01:25:05.446 - 01:25:06.582, Speaker C: Crypto. Yeah.
01:25:06.656 - 01:25:07.280, Speaker A: Okay.
01:25:09.010 - 01:25:15.130, Speaker C: And I think there was one or two that slipped through the cracks in the graphics, which I'm not too happy about, but that's my fault.
01:25:15.290 - 01:25:17.570, Speaker B: Wait, so we're putting Web Three in the grave?
01:25:19.510 - 01:25:34.790, Speaker C: Well, I'm not going to tell other people how to live their lives, but it's got bad juju for me. I'm not calling it Web Three anymore. All right? Ever since we all started saying Web Three, we started getting high on our own supply and believing too many people that are full of shit.
01:25:35.130 - 01:25:36.198, Speaker A: I don't hate that.
01:25:36.284 - 01:25:44.742, Speaker B: I remember reading the A 16 Z Punk report that came out that said that Web Three polled well with people. It was the best polling term.
01:25:44.806 - 01:25:46.726, Speaker C: Yeah, how's it polling now? David?
01:25:46.838 - 01:25:53.550, Speaker B: That was the absolute top of Web Three. It was down only for should have been by David.
01:25:56.050 - 01:26:09.026, Speaker A: All right, so back to the basics. Back to crypto in 2023. Ryan, that's amazing. Hey, action items for you bankless listeners. Of course you can go download the report. We'll include a link in the show notes. Any special instructions on how to download and access that.
01:26:09.048 - 01:26:20.150, Speaker C: Ryan oh, man. I should have the link handy, but it's going to be right on our homepage. So if you go to Masari IO, it will be on our homepage when this drops live.
01:26:20.300 - 01:27:04.610, Speaker A: Amazing. Guys, I hope you enjoyed this. We snuck this in before the holidays and you appreciate, Ryan, you hanging with us. All right, ryan here's my only regret with that conversation is we forgot to talk about the block crypto media. So I know, like, I saw some of your tweets after this. My brain just about exploded earlier this month when I saw that, basically the news that SBF had a controlling secret interest the entire time in one of the largest crypto media publications in our space. And here's why that hit me so hard, is for so long, I've been kind of preaching like and David, too, and I know you have, is the answer to our really shitty financial media coverage of crypto is crypto media.
01:27:04.610 - 01:27:30.060, Speaker A: And here we are. Here's this entity who's caught up and involved in this corruption this SBF thing. And look, I know it's not everyone there. There are tons of fantastic people at The Block that goes without saying who are not aware of any of this, but to see it kind of seep in, I don't know, my jaw hit the floor. What's your reaction to this? Because I wanted to talk to you about this for a while. Since it happened.
01:27:33.890 - 01:28:33.760, Speaker C: I feel like with anything like that, it had to have been an extremely small group of people that knew about this, if not a group of one, because stuff like this always gets out. Right. And I just don't really think that there's any reason to suspect that the vast majority, if not pretty much the entirety of the editorial and research teams at The Block really had any idea that this was the structure. I know that The Block's founder, Mike Dudas, was completely blindsided by this. Right. I think he had said that he thought that Mike McCaffrey's source of funding for his buyout of the company was just from family money. It seemed like this kind of took everybody's surprise and was very much an isolated group of people that knew about this.
01:28:33.760 - 01:29:20.062, Speaker C: So in some respects I think it's unfortunate, it's tough that a good chunk of the team is going to be maligned over this or have their integrity called into question. I don't think that's necessary and I think it just also flies in the face of their actual coverage on some of this stuff. Right. There are, I think, much more pernicious issues with pay to play within crypto media that is outside of CoinDesk and The Block. CoinDesk broke the story that unraveled FTX and has now turned around and created contagion in his parent company. Right. So I think CoinDesk and The Block editorial teams are two of the best.
01:29:20.062 - 01:29:27.170, Speaker C: Decrypts another one up there. You guys obviously do great work, but in terms of traditional news, like journalist.
01:29:27.510 - 01:29:30.258, Speaker A: Heavy, we are not journalists at all.
01:29:30.424 - 01:30:30.838, Speaker C: Yeah, I think those three are definitely kind of pillars of the ecosystem and so I didn't really spend a whole lot of time in the schadenfreude of it. I just thought it was like another whatever can go wrong will go wrong this year, because that one was more of just like an own goal that's going to look a lot worse than it really is, I think, in terms of the outside world, because I think we know some of the folks that are over the block. Right. And I would be shocked if Frankie Scoops had any idea of something like this. I mean, his reaction was like someone that just got stabbed in the back in the heart. Right. So I think that's unfortunate and maybe unfair, but I think there is a bigger question in terms of should we have like an Associated Press of crypto? Right? So something that is a little bit more open and that is focused on doing the journalistic grunt work, but where the information is ultimately like a public good.
01:30:30.924 - 01:31:21.734, Speaker A: Okay, well, let's talk about because that's really where my mind went. And by the way, we hopped right into this question with Ryan because he's totally up to speed. But for bankless listeners who aren't aware, the Block large cryptojournalism news institution in crypto turned out that their CEO was getting loans from SBF and Alameda, that entire thing, and was using that to buy up a majority stake of the Block. So in some shadow type pseudo way, SBF Alameda was actually the owner of the Block. And the question of does that taint coverage? What were the intents behind this? Also, the CEO, former CEO of The Block is obviously he's no longer the CEO and owner, was also given apartments in the Bahamas as part of this. So it's just some shady things. Anyway, that's the background that we're going into.
01:31:21.734 - 01:31:48.560, Speaker A: But what, Ryan, can we do to not become, like, the legacy media? How do we make this corruption resistant? SBF won't be the last that tries to bribe out and buy out a crypto media publication? How do we develop some armor for this the next time around? And that maybe goes to the idea that you were talking about, like Associated Press. So dig into this. What do you think the solutions are here?
01:31:49.010 - 01:32:51.666, Speaker C: I actually think this is a pretty good case for a Dow. And the reason I say that is I ran CoinDesk for a couple of years, right? So the acquisition and restructuring that we did at DCG in 2016, it was me that led that turnaround. And like a team of six, right? It was like, Pete Rizzo, Mike McSweeney, who's now over at The Block, and like an events team, our editorial team was down to two people and one know, European that was doing the night coverage and helping on weekends. I know what controls we put in place in terms of editorial firewalls just so that CoinDesk was not perceived to be just a mouthpiece for DCG. We physically moved out of the office. We had these firewalls and this kind of code of conduct that me and Rizzo worked on, and I didn't get in his way, and vice versa. I stopped writing for 18 months.
01:32:51.666 - 01:33:55.174, Speaker C: That was the only time I didn't write, basically, was the 18 months that I actually ran CoinDesk. And I think that model works, if you trust me. And that is kind of besides the point, right? You shouldn't trust that I was not getting calls from Barry and then funneling that in a conference room to Rizzo, essentially saying, if you write about this, you're fired. Right? That's something that I think gets taken for granted, because I think CoinDesk's body of work stood on its own. 2ft people had a lot of confidence on the integrity of the editorial team that we had, and that we wouldn't do something like that. But it's still a leap of faith and you can get unfairly maligned by association just because that construct exists. And I think the same is true with the situation with the block where you had a business focused CEO, not really in the editorial function, not really in the research function, doing something totally outside of both of that that is going to make them look bad.
01:33:55.174 - 01:35:05.482, Speaker C: And now it kind of impugns the integrity of the rest of the group, or at least the brand. Right. And so if you think about what a Dow could be really good for, it could be good for funding a sustainable operation for journalism that is truly independent, where the content itself is ungovernable but the funding source is secure, right? So one of the issues that you always have is you want good news but you never want to be the object of bad news. And that can create a bunch of kind of gnarly incentive problems when it comes to running a commercial business. I can't tell you how many folks on the CoinDesk side were like, we're not coming to consensus, we're not supporting you. Like this is a garbage publication because there was a negative article about them because they did something shitty or they had some mishap and the journalists covered it. So I think there are ways to monetize a business like that and basically automate the business operations of a decentralized media outlet.
01:35:05.482 - 01:36:17.702, Speaker C: And we might be at an interesting moment in kind of crypto's lifecycle where combination of a recession layoffs, some of these kind of brand issues. Let's forget the brand issues, some of the change of control issues that might exist at both the Block and CoinDesk since the Block is probably going to have to restructure based on McCaffrey's ownership. CoinDesk is rumored to be on the Block because of DCG's other issues and its other subsidiaries. So you might have a perfect storm where there's going to be a lot of talent that is potentially looking to hit the market. Could you spin up almost like a constitution Dow but for funding sustainable cryptojournalism and then organize a business unit just like you do? Like you have a centralized editorial desk in crypto? Could you have kind of a hub and spoke model where you have a centralized editorial desk and then like a freelance kind of Dow model? Kind of like what you guys have done with bankless Dow as some of the kind of specialist contributors. And I think if it's ever going to happen, it's probably going to happen soon. So maybe you guys take it up and then just shoot me a tip if it works.
01:36:17.756 - 01:36:19.240, Speaker A: I was going to ask you to do it.
01:36:19.850 - 01:37:12.294, Speaker C: Well, okay. Wink wink. I don't want to get in trouble because my team's like you have too many ideas, people, I hear you and we have to focus. But I do think it's really interesting. The other thing that I think is really interesting about this idea at this point in time is I think the economics of the journalism business have been total dog shit for forever. And that could potentially get flipped on its head with things like GBT Three in the coming years. The reason I say that is with more automation of the writing process, you're still going to need the fact checkers and the architects of these stories and the investigators, right? So even though you can do the write ups, it's like a scientist, right? Like doing the write up is the easiest part.
01:37:12.294 - 01:38:14.182, Speaker C: You got to design the experiment. You got to get all the controls, right? You got to basically set everything up. And then if the experiment is well constructed, then you read out the results and then the write up kind of that's the easiest part, is just explaining what you did. But the concoction building everything itself, that's the difficult part. And I think with something like GBT Three, if you started recording all of your interviews right, or you started just inputting all of your raw notes into an NLP engine, and then more importantly, you had a trove of historical data and historical stories and historical notes that your entire desk had done. Now that model gets more efficient and smarter over time and can make many more lateral connections and maybe break stories like FTX far sooner because that model would say, okay, we're looking at all the market cap info for these assets over here. We know that Alameda was doing these investments.
01:38:14.182 - 01:38:58.630, Speaker C: We know that the market corrected here. We know that this press release went out, then we know what FTX's volumes were, and then they have a billion dollars to bail out Blockfly and they have 500 million to bail out Voyager. It could literally just slam all these together and say, something's broken here, right? There's something that doesn't add up about these numbers. And now you've got like your smoking gun. That's just one example, but you could potentially do that with any combination of things and really kind of glean insight from the noise of most of today's news by having that source material. And you do need the source material to put into these models, otherwise you're going to run into copyright issues. So I think the economics of the news business are more interesting.
01:38:58.630 - 01:39:12.090, Speaker C: I think doing it in decentralized way is more interesting given the incentive mismatches. And every time I talk about it out loud, I kind of want to do it. My team is going to be pissed at this in the bonus, but it's exciting.
01:39:13.070 - 01:39:45.318, Speaker A: The last thing I'll say, because you've been with us for a while and I just wanted to get your thoughts on this and this has been very helpful, is I noticed number I think number four on your top People to Watch list was Citizen journalists. That was actually success in 2022. If we look at like you named Molly White and Autism Capital. And autism. Capital is doing all these things about SBF. Another one that comes to mind is that Twitter account. Zach XBT just doing deep due diligence on crypto influencers and surfacing the grift and just being like, hey, look at this.
01:39:45.318 - 01:40:07.360, Speaker A: So if we can coordinate and unify some of that citizen journalist energy in some sort of a dao structure, I mean, that starts to get really exciting. I don't know what that looks like, ryan, David and I certainly don't have time for it right now. But we are cheering on whoever's listening to this and wants to start spinning that up and thinking about it. And yeah, thanks for weighing in on this. Appreciate it.
01:40:08.290 - 01:40:13.966, Speaker C: That's your bonus episode right there. Thanks guys. Happy holidays. With that, we are done this time.
