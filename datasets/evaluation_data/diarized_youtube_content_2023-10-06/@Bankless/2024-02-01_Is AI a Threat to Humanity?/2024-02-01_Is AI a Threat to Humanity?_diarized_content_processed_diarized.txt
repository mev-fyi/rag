00:00:00.170 - 00:00:46.200, Speaker A: Think it's the future is not, you know, machines dominance. The future is us working with, with machines and, and for those who are just trying to dark paint to show the future, I mean, my answer is look, it's not a magic wand but it's not the Terminator. It's not a free ticket to heaven but it's not the key to unlock the doors of hell. It's human invention. And again, while it could outperform us in many areas, we still, you know, we still have this theme. It's not a control but we still occupy a place that I don't think machines can take away from us. It's so tempting to follow the path of the Terminator movies and Matrix, but actually while I was a big fan, of course the Terminator back in the early ninety s, I still didn't understand why Machine wanted to kill people.
00:00:46.200 - 00:00:51.660, Speaker A: It's answer. So what for.
