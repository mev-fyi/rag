00:00:02.730 - 00:00:25.074, Speaker A: Bankless nation. Welcome to our second live video Ama. I am joined by DyDX's Antonio Giuliano, who is the founder of DYDX. Just hold on 1 minute. I'm going to mute myself on YouTube. I hear an echo, but I'm good now. Antonio, how are you doing? Welcome to the bankless nation.
00:00:25.074 - 00:00:28.358, Speaker A: Are you ready to be put on the hot seat? You ready for some AMA questions, sir?
00:00:28.444 - 00:00:32.262, Speaker B: Doing well? Yeah, I'm ready. Excited. Excited to answer everybody's questions.
00:00:32.396 - 00:01:10.926, Speaker A: Awesome. All right, so I think this is actually the first time that we've had you in front of the bankless nation in podcast form or anything, but we've run a number of articles about DYDX, specifically some of the perpetual features and things that we want to dig into today. I'm sure the community will want to dig into as well. So I would love to start with an introduction before we do so though, a few housekeeping items. So first, if you are tuning in live on Periscope, head on over to the YouTube channel. That way we can see some of your questions as they come in and get those questions answered. This is an AMA, so it's interactive.
00:01:10.926 - 00:01:34.380, Speaker A: So if you have questions for Antonio during the conversation, please go ahead and post those on YouTube. Also, for the bankless nation members who are in discord, you can post questions in discord as well. You can also join us in Zoom. We will try to prioritize your questions first. And this is probably going to go about an hour. So it is 02:00 p.m. Eastern for me.
00:01:34.380 - 00:01:54.880, Speaker A: We'll probably go until 03:00 p.m.. Eastern. So we'll try to throw in kind of a half time and 15 minutes left signals for you so you can get all your questions in. So that's it as far as housekeeping. Antonio, let's continue with an introduction. So how the heck did you find yourself in crypto, sir?
00:01:55.330 - 00:02:22.838, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So how did I find myself in crypto? I've been in crypto for a little over five years now. Actually, pretty much my entire professional career I've been in crypto. Kind of the way I got into crypto was different than, I'd say, the way most other people got into crypto. So I started my career at Coinbase. I was a software engineer there, and that was basically my first job right out of college. And I got to Coinbase very differently than how pretty much everybody else got to Coinbase.
00:02:22.838 - 00:03:06.022, Speaker B: Most people were super into bitcoin, which was basically all there was at the time. And that kind of naturally led them to working at Coinbase, but I didn't know anything about cryptocurrency. And then Coinbase was just kind of one of the 20 companies I applied to my senior year of college. But I was really impressed with them, really impressed with their interview process. They kind of do this unique thing in their interview process, which UIDX also does, which is called a work trial. So basically, during my senior year of college, they flew me out to San Francisco and I basically just pieced out on classes for a week. And then I worked full time at Coinbase for my work trial and was just really excited about everybody's enthusiasm for bitcoin and the space.
00:03:06.022 - 00:03:16.586, Speaker B: And I had no idea what it was, but clearly these people were very smart and very passionate about it. So kind of just decided to take a leap of faith and go work with these people on this crazy thing.
00:03:16.688 - 00:03:32.026, Speaker A: So this was kind of like random chance of the universe, right, that you just got interested. Okay. And what did your family think when you told them, hey, of all of the companies I could join, I'm going to do the bitcoin thing? What did your family think about that decision?
00:03:32.138 - 00:04:00.566, Speaker B: They certainly had a lot of questions. I've probably explained bitcoin as probably a lot of you all have as well to my family, like a million times. But, yeah, they were definitely pretty supportive of mean, I think at that time, Coinbase was kind of a legit company. They'd raised a good amount of money at that point. So it was like, okay, clearly there's something going on here. We don't quite understand what's going on, but this seems like a reasonable company. So, yeah, go do your thing.
00:04:00.566 - 00:04:03.258, Speaker B: And I guess they were definitely supportive of it.
00:04:03.344 - 00:04:18.522, Speaker A: That was quite the start. Okay, so you're at Coinbase, your first job, sort of out of college, you're getting a feel for it, your first exposure to crypto. It sounds like you fell down the rabbit hole there in some way and then went even deeper. So then what happened when you were at Coinbase?
00:04:18.666 - 00:04:46.200, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So I joined Coinbase and just Coinbase at the time had a lot of just the absolutely best people. Like, a lot of them in crypto, at the space were all at Coinbase during that time. And this was like, back in 2015 or so. So it was a really great place to be. And it was basically just like, I think we still do this at DYDX, but especially then at Coinbase. We just talked about bitcoin literally all the time and just hyped up on the price and stuff like that, and things that were going on in the space.
00:04:46.200 - 00:05:46.698, Speaker B: And it really just felt like this little, I don't know, club almost, where it's like we were all super excited about this thing that nobody else even knew what it was. So we all just talked about it quite a lot. And it was like you got to listen to things like Olaf, like Carlson Wii, like giving a presentation over lunch, like Freder giving a presentation on ethereum early on. And then I think the thing that really did it for me in terms of just really selling me on the space was ethereum, probably like it was for, again, like a lot of you. But basically, at the time, that was right when Ethereum was kind of coming out like the Ethereum Ico happened. The main network was launched during my time at Coinbase, and then Coinbase also started supporting ETH as their second crypto asset after bitcoin, during my time at Coinbase. And this was really a big change for all of us at Coinbase at the time, because, like I've been saying, it was basically 100% interest in bitcoin at the time.
00:05:46.698 - 00:06:50.138, Speaker B: And it was just 100% clear to us that bitcoin would be the only interesting cryptocurrency ever. Because, of course it has the network effects. If there were any other cryptocurrency that were doing something interesting, well, obviously, why wouldn't bitcoin just adopt the features and then start doing it itself with its bigger network effects? So it was just 100% clear to us that bitcoin was going to be the only interesting thing ever in cryptocurrency. And of course, we were wrong, and we can all know what's happened since then. But during just kind of like the launch of Ethereum, that's when I think it took all of us just a long time to wrap our heads around what exactly. Ethereum was just kind of this concept that you can write these programs that execute deterministically on a blockchain and they can be anything, right? It's totally its own smart contracting language and everything like that. And I think it took me probably like six months or so to really wrap my head around that and just had a really great opportunity to be at the forefront of, like I said, olaf and Fred giving presentations.
00:06:50.138 - 00:07:21.660, Speaker B: We had Vitalik come in really early on and talk to us about smart contracts. We had Krug, like, come in and give us a walkthrough on creating our first smart contract, all that kind of stuff. And then after, I feel like I kind of wrap my head around Ethereum and that you could just for the first time create these programs that execute on this totally permissionless, decentralized ledger. It really just struck me that this is just like a paradigm change in computing, period. And that's what really got me excited about working in the space.
00:07:22.190 - 00:08:34.640, Speaker A: Very cool. All right, so programmable money use cases, I guess, pulled you the rest of the way down the rabbit hole. So, Antonio, I want to get to the questions, because this is for the bankless nation to ask you questions. And I've got a first question from Jesus Perez in the bankless community, and he wants to know, to understand the differences between perpetuals and margin trading. So, like, when to use margin trading and when to use perpetuals specifically. And you know what I think would be useful, too, as maybe we can use this question to start with, but is for you later to maybe describe some of the core products that DyDx actually has, because we have a lot of people here that are very familiar with DeFi, very familiar with crypto, but they haven't necessarily used some of these sorts of perpetual products and margin products that are pretty standard in other areas of traditional finance. So why don't you start with that question of when to use margin trading and when to use perpetuals? What's the difference?
00:08:35.010 - 00:09:02.978, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. I can start with that. And maybe actually, I'll just start with just kind of like the products that DyDx offers and then describe how they work and then when to use. Yeah, DYDX basically is obviously a decentralized exchange, but our main wheelhouse and what we're kind of focusing on is more advanced types of financial products. So we have three. Well, actually, we have five main products on the exchange, so we support quite a lot of stuff. So first is just spot trading, if that sounds fancy to you.
00:09:02.978 - 00:09:23.226, Speaker B: It's not. It's basically just like buying and selling, like you would do on a uniswap or a zero x or like anything else. You can do that on DyDX, too. The other two kind of more basic things that you can do are you can lend funds very similar to, like, a compound. You just kind of deposit your funds on DyDX. They passively earn interest over time. They're kind of like lent out to margin traders.
00:09:23.226 - 00:09:58.854, Speaker B: You can borrow funds directly to your wallet. Again, very similar to what you can do on a compound. So these are kind of like the three things that we support that are relatively standard in the defi space. Like you've probably done them on other decentralized platforms. But the special sauce of DYDX is these more advanced financial products, and those two are margin trading and then perpetual trading, as you just mentioned. So kind of getting into what each of those are in turn. So margin trading, all it is is trading with borrowed funds, and you basically will use that to acquire leverage on cryptocurrency.
00:09:58.854 - 00:10:36.530, Speaker B: And all leverage is. It sounds fancy, but the best way to think about it is you'd basically just multiply your gains or losses by a certain multiplier. And you can also take short positions on cryptocurrencies. So DYDX makes this really easy to do. On our margin product, you can go basically up to five x long or up to four x short on Ethereum and then die in USDC are what we support there right now. And basically what's going on behind the scenes is when you're kind of trading on the margin product, you're interacting with the lending and borrowing pools to just basically borrow funds behind the scenes. And that's how you kind of acquire the leverage.
00:10:36.530 - 00:10:41.046, Speaker B: So that's the first product, the second product before we get to the perpetuals.
00:10:41.078 - 00:10:53.130, Speaker A: Antonio, just a quick recap. So you've got spot trading, and then you've got lending and borrowing. And those first three, were they necessary in order to build the fourth that you were talking about, which is the margin trading?
00:10:53.490 - 00:11:38.218, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, that's a great point, actually. And they basically were necessary to kind of build the other points. Maybe if I were to take a step back and just say how I think about the Defi space and then just kind of like finance in general. So I really think of DeFi and then finance in general as a stack. So it's basically at the base layer of the stack, you have things like money. So things like crypto assets, which like bitcoin and ethereum kind of came out first, and then the next thing in the stack is decentralized exchanges or lending platforms, and you can't have those without the bottom thing, which is like a decentralized asset to trade. So that's kind of like things like a uniswap zero x compound kind of fit in that second layer of the Defi financial stack, if you will.
00:11:38.218 - 00:12:08.930, Speaker B: And then on top of that, I really think about more advanced types of products. So things like margin trading, things like derivatives trading, and that can exist without buying and selling can exist without lending and borrowing, which can exist without the assets themselves. So it's like really you kind of need the things like lower in the stack to support the higher things. And that's why we support all of those things. It's kind of like you say, we basically need to support lending and borrowing and obviously trading itself to be able to support margin trading.
00:12:09.010 - 00:12:39.998, Speaker A: And that's super cool because it's not just DYDX that has to build those core pieces in order to get to margin trading and derivatives. It's basically the entire defi system that's building those. It's no accident that one of the first DeFi use cases something like Maker, which was a borrowing and lending platform. So that's super cool. Now, before we leave margin and go to perpetual, I want to make sure we're solid on margin, right? So you used two words there. You used one long. I want to long something, right? And the other short.
00:12:39.998 - 00:13:00.642, Speaker A: So does that just basically mean if I'm longing something, I am borrowing some asset against my collateral and I'm making a concentrated bet to amplify my gains if I'm right, if number goes up, I get more gains? Right, but I'm putting myself at risk. Is that what longing is? And then maybe you could describe shorting.
00:13:00.786 - 00:13:07.254, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So longing is just like, you make money when the price goes up, shorting is just like you make more money.
00:13:07.292 - 00:13:09.334, Speaker C: When the price goes more money when the price goes up.
00:13:09.372 - 00:13:09.862, Speaker B: This is important.
00:13:09.916 - 00:13:10.306, Speaker C: Differentiation.
00:13:10.338 - 00:13:44.542, Speaker B: Exactly. You make more money when the price goes up. And then, yeah, shorting is you make money when the price goes down, potentially at some multiplier. But the reason you might want to do margin trading, or more broadly, just like trading on leverage, which actually you can do through the margin product and also through the perpetual product, which we'll get to, but just kind of like the concept of leverage or why you might want to use it in the first place. Say you are holding $100 worth of Ethereum. You could be your hodler, just kind of like keep it in your wallet. You're absolutely convinced that the price of Ethereum is like going to the moon.
00:13:44.542 - 00:14:04.698, Speaker B: So why would you not just hold your eth in your wallet? That's great. Good for you. You'll make some money. If you're right and the price of ethereum goes up. But kind of the reason you might want to use leverage on top of that is you can make even more money, as you just said, if the price goes up. And kind of you're right. It's also important to call out that this is not free.
00:14:04.698 - 00:14:41.266, Speaker B: You're also exposing yourself to kind of increased losses if you're wrong and the price goes down. But just kind of like this example of, say you have $100 worth of Ethereum. Say you used five x leverage to kind of take a five x leverage long position on that ethereum. It's basically now like your gains, if you're right, are multiplied by five. So say in this example, you're $100 worth of ethereum. The price of eth doubles. And now that would have been worth $200 if you had just held it in your account in this kind of new leveraged world, where you basically are multiplying your gains.
00:14:41.266 - 00:15:04.526, Speaker B: So in the normal case where you just hold, you make 100%. So you're like two x. In kind of the leverage case, if you would have doubled your money. Now, since you're multiplying by the five x leverage, you make ten x gains. So it's basically like you just multiply the gains you otherwise would have made, and kind of the exchange for that is taking on more risk, and it.
00:15:04.548 - 00:15:19.010, Speaker C: Would have gone in reverse. Right. So this isn't a free lunch. If it goes down, you can also ten x your losses. Right. Can you also comment on the collateral requirements and also the risks of liquidation?
00:15:20.230 - 00:15:49.462, Speaker B: Absolutely. So the way our contracts work is kind of similar to a maker contract or like a compound contract. They require, on the margin side, fully over collateralized borrows. But it's basically like you can use the Ethereum that you come to the platform with as margin. So let's maybe just walk through a really simple example of how that would work. So here you are with your $100. Let's say you're like one e and you're long, you're a hodler, but you've decided that you want to use leverage.
00:15:49.462 - 00:16:15.442, Speaker B: You basically would come to the DYDX platform with your one EtH, and you're like, okay, I'm super convinced that ETH is going to go up. Let's take a five x leverage long position. You basically plop down your one ETH as margin deposit, and then you borrow some stablecoin under the hood. This is all very simple, actually. Kind of. The product interface is basically just like you put in. I want to go like five ETH, leverage one ETh leverage long at five x.
00:16:15.442 - 00:16:47.066, Speaker B: But what's going on under the hood is you're actually borrowing some stablecoin. So you're borrowing, say, another four ETH's worth of Dai or USDC, and then you use those borrowed funds to buy four more ETH to put on top of that one that you put up as margin deposit. So now you have kind of like five e sitting here in your account, you still have to repay your borrow that you borrowed in kind of the stable coin once you close your position. But that's kind of inherently where the leverage comes from and what's going on under the hood.
00:16:47.178 - 00:16:53.620, Speaker C: And there's also a fee involved as well. Right. And so can you talk about where the fee component fits in?
00:16:54.310 - 00:16:56.478, Speaker B: Sure. Like the interest rates.
00:16:56.654 - 00:16:57.906, Speaker C: Yes, exactly. Right.
00:16:58.008 - 00:17:43.710, Speaker B: Yeah, so exactly. Very similar to how if you're taking a loan on literally any financial platform, people are not just going to let you borrow money for free, probably. So it's like you basically have to pay them some interest rate. So now let's continue with our example. So now you're sitting here with your five x leverage long position under the hood. What's going on is there's five e, like in the DyDX smart contracts locked into your account, and then the DyDX smart contracts basically also remember that you have to say pay back the, let's say like 2000 die that you kind of borrowed to buy the other four EtH in the first place. And basically you have to pay like the longer you hold this position, the more interest you'll have to pay, and you'll have to pay a dynamic interest rate.
00:17:43.710 - 00:18:35.146, Speaker B: It's again very similar to how compound works with kind of its variable interest rates over time. And interest rates just kind of vary, again similar to compound based on the supply and demand for the pool. But there is some interest that you'll have to pay to basically be able to hold this position. The other cool thing about DyDX, though, is in addition to paying interest on the amount that you're borrowing, you're also earning interest on the amount that you have in collateral on your position simultaneously. So since you're borrowing the die in this example, let's say you're paying interest on that die with whatever the interest rate is there, but you're also earning interest rate on your EtH that you have locked up as collateral. So the system works very well in that regard. Normally, the interest rates on stablecoins are higher than the interest rates you would see on ETH, at least historically.
00:18:35.146 - 00:18:49.346, Speaker B: So normally if you're taking a long position, you'll be paying interest. But actually it's kind of cool. Like if you take a short position, a lot of the time you'll be earning interest on the platform, and kind of the platform will show you how much interest you're earning or paying.
00:18:49.528 - 00:18:54.694, Speaker A: And then maybe the last piece to cover on that is what happens in the event of a margin call.
00:18:54.892 - 00:19:42.418, Speaker B: Yes. So, in the events of a margin call, and this is, again, very similar to basically what happens on a compound or a makerdao if you've used any of those platforms before. But in the event of a margin call, so let's say in our example again, you have this five e locked here, and then you're borrowing the 2000 die. And basically what our smart contracts will enforce is that the value of this five e always has to be greater than the value of this 2000 die, or else the smart contract itself may have lost money on the trade. So, let's say you went long. Sadly, you were wrong. The price of ETH is going down instead of up, as you had hoped, and it gets down to the point where now your five e is worth just a little bit more than the 2000 die that you had borrowed.
00:19:42.418 - 00:20:51.162, Speaker B: So it's looking like it's getting to the point where you might not be able to cover the losses on your position anymore. What will basically happen at this point is there's kind of a decentralized network of liquidators on DYDX that will look for these kind of under collateralized or close to under collateralized positions on DyDX, and then they'll liquidate your account, which all liquidation means is they'll kind of basically pay back your borrow for you, and they'll take some of your collateral in exchange to do that. And effectively, what that means from the trader's perspective is you lost money on this trade, and then your trade was closed out before you lost too much money. And there'll be like a small amount of capital probably that's in your accounts after you get liquidated, but it's probably like you lost most or almost all of your initial deposits. So that's kind of where the risk comes in that we've been talking about with margin trading. It's definitely something you should understand a little bit more and kind of think critically about the risks before you enter into, but something where it's like you can kind of increase your risk and also increase your reward there, too.
00:20:51.296 - 00:21:13.780, Speaker A: These mechanisms aren't new to defi. This is the same way it works on a centralized exchange or in traditional finance. And before we get off the topic of margin trading, I imagine we were talking about a long position there, but I imagine a short position is just the same sort of mechanism, but the bet is directionally different. You're betting instead that the price of ether will go down, is that correct?
00:21:14.150 - 00:21:15.778, Speaker B: Yeah, that's exactly correct.
00:21:15.944 - 00:21:44.074, Speaker A: Okay, cool. All right, so we've got a good base. I think that's important, even though we're still on kind of question one. But it's really important because I think this will answer a bunch of questions, and having that foundation is important. So we've gotten all the way through the first four product offerings, margin. Now we get to the fifth, where things, I think, get a little more interesting and maybe another layer of complexity. So the fifth is perpetuals.
00:21:44.122 - 00:21:44.574, Speaker B: Right.
00:21:44.692 - 00:22:00.180, Speaker A: And do perpetuals essentially sit on top of all of the other layers? So you need trading, you need lending and borrowing, you need margin as well, like a mechanism. And now once you have those things, you can build out perpetuals. Is that kind of how it works?
00:22:01.030 - 00:22:35.214, Speaker B: Sort of. I would say in terms of their level of complexity, they're definitely the most complex, financially complex product that we offer. They don't actually use lending and borrowing under the hood. They use basically like a separate mechanism. So it's kind of like, if we think of our stack metaphor again, it's like assets like buy, sell, and then it's kind of like lending and borrowing margin. And then derivatives are off to the side a little bit. But they do, like I said, kind of use more financially sophisticated mechanisms to basically offer the product that people want to trade, which I'm happy to go more into.
00:22:35.332 - 00:22:37.738, Speaker A: Yeah. So tell us, what is a perpetual?
00:22:37.914 - 00:23:17.814, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So a perpetual contract is a synthetic contract, and this is something that has become really popular in crypto itself. If you've ever heard of or traded on Bitmex, this is exactly the product that's made like bitmex, really popular. Tons of other new kind of centralized exchanges, like binance has launched perpetuals. FTX has launched perpetuals in the past year. So kind of just motivating, why did we offer perpetuals, too? They're basically by far the most popular trading product by volume in crypto right now. There's more volume on crypto perpetuals in the entire market than there is on the entire buy sell market for crypto combined.
00:23:17.942 - 00:23:24.906, Speaker A: And another word people use for perpetuals sometimes is derivatives. Is a perpetual a type of derivative?
00:23:25.098 - 00:24:01.346, Speaker B: Yeah, basically, derivative is like the master. It's like a superset of perpetual. It's like a type got you. So that's exactly why there's a lot of volume on them in terms of what a perpetual contract is or how it works under the hood. The main selling point of why you might want to use a perpetual contract as compared to another type of derivative is kind of in the name. They're perpetual, which basically means that they don't expire. Most types of derivatives, like, if you've heard of a future or, like an option, they're kind of more traditional types of derivatives like that expire.
00:24:01.346 - 00:24:13.438, Speaker B: So if you were to buy a normal future, it would expire, say, at the end of the month, and you could get price exposure to eth or whatever you wanted to trade on with that. But it's a little bit less useful because you can't hold it as long as you might want to.
00:24:13.524 - 00:24:29.314, Speaker A: So those bitcoin futures that were so much celebrated, that came out in 2017 by the CME, basically those expire every 30 days or so. They just expire. You can't kind of renew them. You have to start from scratch again, is that right?
00:24:29.432 - 00:25:20.158, Speaker B: Yeah, that's exactly correct. And the other reason why perpetuals are really cool and why it makes a lot of new traders kind of use them as their first derivative product, is because it feels fairly similar to trading the underlying asset itself. So let's maybe take the bitcoin perpetual on DyDX as an example. Since the contract is synthetic, and basically what synthetic means is, under the hood, the asset that you're trading does not exist within the platform. So on the DYDX, like bitcoin perpetual, there's no actual bitcoin involved anywhere. We basically created this financial contract which effectively just tracks the price of bitcoin without actually having bitcoin involved. And the other really nice thing about perpetuals is it, like I said, feels like you're trading the underlying asset.
00:25:20.158 - 00:26:00.190, Speaker B: So the DyDX bitcoin perpetual, and really, any perpetual contract you might trade within crypto is just set up to track the price of the underlying asset. So if you're trading the DyDX bitcoin perpetual with kind of, like, its underlying mechanisms are designed such that the price tracks the price of another asset, which, say, could be bitcoin. It's actually not that dissimilar from Dai or something like that, which tracks the price of one dollars. It's like, instead here, we're just creating this synthetic asset, which tracks the price of another asset, which is like a bitcoin or something like that. Though the underlying mechanisms are different.
00:26:00.340 - 00:26:17.970, Speaker A: And the reason you can do that is back to that first layer that you were talking about, right, which is you have the money layer, essentially, or we might call that the value layer, the collateral layer. And you're saying that collateral layer, it could be bitcoin, it could be ether, or it also could be a stable coin, like you guys use USDC as a bunch, right?
00:26:18.120 - 00:27:03.300, Speaker B: Yeah, that's exactly correct. And different perpetual platforms will use a different collateral. So we have two types of collateral on the system right now. So we have some perpetuals, which are margined in USDC, which just means that there's USDC collateral, our eth perpetual. Right now, you can actually use ETH as collateral and also trade on the price of ETH, which is very cool, like a very eth centric product for all you etheads out there. But that's kind of how it works under the hood. And kind of, maybe if we just to finish out talking about how exactly the perpetuals work, the main mechanism that perpetuals use to basically keep their peg or trade at the price that you want them to trade at is this mechanism called a funding rate.
00:27:03.300 - 00:27:58.662, Speaker B: So all a funding rate is, it's basically very similar to a dynamic interest rate that's paid between those who are long the contract and those who are short the contract. So in what long the contract and short the contract means is because this asset is synthetic, it's effectively zero sum. So for every one unit of long, there's like one unit of people going short. So say you go to DyDX and you buy one bitcoin worth of the DyDX bitcoin perpetual, you're basically trading against somebody else who's kind of taking the short side of that trade and getting back to this funding rate, or kind of what it is or why. It's really important, and important to understand if you're trading perpetuals, is the funding rate, is the mechanism by which the perpetual tracks the price of bitcoin. So, kind of going back to the perpetual, it is its own asset. It can basically trade at, like any other asset, just whatever price people want to trade it at.
00:27:58.662 - 00:29:00.118, Speaker B: So the question, if we're designing this derivatives contract, this perpetual contract, is how do we make it trade at the price of bitcoin? And basically how the funding rate comes into that is. So we know what the price of bitcoin is. Say it's like $10,000, and then we know what the price of the DyDX bitcoin perpetual is trading at. And where the funding rate comes in is if the perpetual is trading too low relative to the price of bitcoin. So basically, we want to move the price up, right? We want to get it closer to being the price of bitcoin. Then, basically we want to incentivize more people to go long, right? We want to incentivize them to buy to drive the price up, because when people buy, price goes up. So what basically happens is then the funding rate, which is just this interest, which, again, is paid between those who are long and those who are short, would basically make the people that are short pay the people that are long some interest rate to basically incentivize more people to take the long side of the trade and again, drive the price back up to what we want it to be.
00:29:00.118 - 00:29:51.702, Speaker B: Conversely, if the price of the perpetual is too high, we want to drive the price down, right? We want it to be lower, we want more people to sell, and we want to incentivize more people to go short, which basically means selling. So in that case, the funding rate would make the people that are long pay the people that are short some kind of dynamic interest rate over time. And that's basically the whole thing is just like, once you understand this funding rate and kind of how that's used to effectively stabilize the price of the perpetual alongside what the price of actual bitcoin is, you really understand, for the most part, how most of the contract works. So when you're kind of trading these perpetual contracts on DYDX, just the important thing to note is that there is kind of some funding rate, which is, from a trader's perspective, it feels similar to paying some interest rate or even sometimes earning some interest rate like you would on margin.
00:29:51.846 - 00:30:14.030, Speaker A: Very good. All right, so we got markets within markets. Now let's put a bow on this perpetual thing. We went to all of that work to construct a perpetual everything you just described. Why? Why can't we just trade bitcoin? Why can't we just trade eth? Why are we doing this? Why is a perpetual better than margin or a different use case, let's say, than the other four?
00:30:14.180 - 00:30:41.126, Speaker B: Great question. Yeah. So kind of the main reasons that perpetual, that a trader might want to trade a perpetual over margin, it's not like, strictly better. Like, there are trade offs to both. But kind of the main reason why we've seen a lot of volume flow into perpetuals, both on DyDX and also on other crypto platforms, is for a couple of reasons. So, first reason is you can trade them with much higher leverage. So DyDX isn't quite there yet, but if you've seen the bitmaxes, like 100 x's of the world, didn't finance do.
00:30:41.148 - 00:30:42.890, Speaker A: Like 125 x or something?
00:30:42.960 - 00:30:49.450, Speaker B: Finance did 125 x, FTX did like 101 x just to fight Bitmax? Probably it's just a race to the bottom.
00:30:49.520 - 00:30:53.520, Speaker C: Soon there's going to be 150 x. It's just going to keep on going?
00:30:54.450 - 00:31:12.850, Speaker B: Absolutely. So if you've seen those classes of leverage that are of the 100 x's of the world, they're trading perpetual products, and that's how you get through the underlying constructions. You can get a lot more leverage, and that's oftentimes useful to traders. I wouldn't recommend just like going and trading with 100 x leverage on Bitmex.
00:31:13.510 - 00:31:21.726, Speaker A: So what happens if you're trading at 100 x? Right? Does that mean like one small price in the wrong direction and you're just completely wiped?
00:31:21.838 - 00:31:22.726, Speaker B: If you have to look at the.
00:31:22.748 - 00:31:23.746, Speaker A: Second by second chart.
00:31:23.778 - 00:31:32.214, Speaker B: If the price goes down 0.5% on Bitmax and you're 100 x long, you get liquidated and you lose all your money. You can't let the price go down.
00:31:32.252 - 00:31:33.082, Speaker A: Like, who does this?
00:31:33.136 - 00:31:34.982, Speaker C: It's a straight gamble. It's a straight gamble.
00:31:35.046 - 00:32:01.220, Speaker B: It's madness. Yeah, most of the 100 X's stuff is a bit crazy. You definitely shouldn't do that. But most people don't. A couple of people do. It's mostly marketing, if I'm being honest, just trying to get the higher leverages of the world. But most people trade with five to ten to maybe up to 20 x leverage or so, which, if you have really good understanding of how you think the price is going to move, it can make sense.
00:32:01.220 - 00:32:35.530, Speaker B: So the first is like higher leverage on our margin product. Right now, our maximum leverage is five x. On our perpetual products, our maximum leverage is ten x. That's actually going to increase quite a lot once we move to our starware integration for perpetuals, which we can get into later. So the first reason is leverage. Second reason you might want to do this is the funding rates can be a lot more attractive than kind of paying the underlying interest rates on margin. So that makes it really sometimes more attractive for traders to trade perpetuals.
00:32:35.530 - 00:33:17.270, Speaker B: And then the third reason, which is really important, especially if you're trading on defi, is because perpetuals can support synthetic assets. So that basically means that to offer trading of bitcoin, we don't need bitcoin, we don't have to worry about any of the cross chain stuff. We could spin up whatever market we wanted to, like XRP market or litecoin, all these types of different things. And from a technical perspective, it would be very similar. The only thing we need is a price oracle that's reporting what the price of the asset that we want to trade is. So it allows exchanges to spin up way more easily. Spin up trading for new markets and just make these markets really liquid.
00:33:17.270 - 00:33:23.926, Speaker B: And all liquid means is if you want to make a trade, there's tons of people on the other side willing to make the opposite trade.
00:33:24.118 - 00:33:50.166, Speaker A: Okay. All right. So it basically allows you to use any store of value, any money at the base layer, to create anything you want. Okay. All right. So I think we got to Jesus Perez's first question, but that was a fantastic amount of foundational knowledge. I think, that a lot of people don't understand with margin perpetuals, but that answers that question.
00:33:50.166 - 00:34:06.954, Speaker A: I do have one last question on perpetuals. So there is this thing that you guys recently came out with called an inverse perpetual. Okay, what's the inverse part of perpetual? And it's an inverse perpetual of eth, I believe. What does the inverse piece mean?
00:34:07.072 - 00:34:48.914, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a great question. So, fundamentally, under the hood, exactly the same thing still has the funding rate, still has the same dynamics of the perpetual contract. The inverse thing, basically what that means is it just determines what type of collateral you're using. So the inverse part on the eth perpetual means that you are trading the price of ETH, and you're also using ETH as collateral. This is kind of like, if you've ever traded on bitmex before, you'll know that bitmex uses bitcoin as collateral, and you can also trade the price of bitcoin on bitMex. It's a very similar idea to that, but this is the very eth native product and native way to do this. You can come to DydX, you can only have ETH.
00:34:48.914 - 00:35:14.542, Speaker B: You can lever up and trade on ETH with this product that's running on the Ethereum blockchain, like, control your keys the entire time. So that's kind of why we launched our eth perpetual. As an inverse perpetual is we really see a lot of demand within defi, and especially crypto, more broadly, for people that just hold ETH and want to say, either go, like, leverage long eth or sometimes leverage short eth. And this product is, like, a really great way to be able to do that.
00:35:14.596 - 00:35:25.554, Speaker A: So it's really a product for the ETH holders who are super bulls on ETH, and they don't want to cash out their ETh for some other, lesser money. Right. Like a fiat. Fiat stablecoin, then.
00:35:25.672 - 00:35:26.098, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:35:26.184 - 00:35:46.870, Speaker A: Okay. All right, very good. All right, awesome. Okay, we are over halfway done now, but. Okay, let me do some quick hit questions, Antonio, that are coming in. So one question is from the discord. Bankless discord are parts of DyDX still geofenced? If so, what led to that decision?
00:35:47.030 - 00:37:00.062, Speaker B: Yeah, great question. So, yes, so the main thing that is geofenced is the perpetual contracts. And the main thing that led to that decision in terms of where they're geofencing customers right now. And the main thing that led to that geofencing is just certain regulations that are basically on derivative contracts within the US and kind of our assessments of the risk of being an exchange and kind of offering those products to us customers. It seems like it's not within the spectrum of risk that we're willing to take on to be able to do that. Maybe just really quickly taking a step back in terms of how we think about the risk as a decentralized exchange, I'd say from a regulatory perspective, especially in the US, every regulator has a different definition, basically of what a decentralized exchange is, and also a different definition of how much or little being a decentralized exchange helps from a regulatory perspective. And probably the CFTC, which is the body that regulates derivative products in the US, it basically take, this is not legal advice, but it's kind of basically doesn't really matter too much if certain parts are decentralized from the CFTC's perspective.
00:37:00.062 - 00:37:03.406, Speaker B: So that's kind of what led to that decision. Gotcha.
00:37:03.438 - 00:37:11.046, Speaker A: And that's the main regulator that you're dealing with is the CFTC, rather than not the SEC so much correct.
00:37:11.148 - 00:37:12.118, Speaker B: Yeah, got it.
00:37:12.204 - 00:37:19.240, Speaker C: So, Antonio, is there a future version of the world where DyDX has to implement KYC onto its platform?
00:37:19.850 - 00:37:47.038, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a great question. Yeah. Not to get too much into the weeds on the legal stuff with this too, but there's kind of the main reason you might implement KYC is not with the CFTC. Actually, there's a different us regulatory body that kind of controls that, which is called Finsen. They've actually put out some really good guidance in the past year. They're one of the most proactive regulators in terms of putting out guidance which specifically address decentralized exchanges. And that's given us confidence to basically be able to operate without KYC.
00:37:47.038 - 00:38:06.680, Speaker B: I'm not going to sit here and say that the regulatory regime will never evolve in a way that makes DYDX do KYC, but we really strive to be able to very much, in the ethos of cryptocurrency, just offer trading to as many people without KYC to just democratize access to our products as much as possible.
00:38:07.850 - 00:38:32.862, Speaker A: This took me a while to kind of figure out all of the regulatory agencies that are involved. So the spark notes, and correct me if I'm wrong, because you would know right more than me. But spark notes are like, if you're dealing with something like a stock or a security, the SEC is the group involved. If you're dealing with something like a future or an option or perpetual, or synthetic or commodity, it's the CFTC, right?
00:38:32.916 - 00:38:33.374, Speaker B: Correct.
00:38:33.492 - 00:38:49.494, Speaker A: Sometimes there's overlap, and then if you're dealing with anything that is like anti money laundering, patriot act type stuff, this is all us, by the way. Sorry, international folks, but the US is. They've got a lot of regulatory bodies. Anyway, that last one is. That's Finson, right?
00:38:49.532 - 00:38:49.782, Speaker B: Correct.
00:38:49.836 - 00:38:57.480, Speaker A: Those are the primary regulators that you would probably come into contact with in what you're doing. Is there anyone else?
00:38:58.250 - 00:39:10.410, Speaker B: Yeah, certainly we look at other regulatory bodies besides that. Even just in the US, there's quite a lot of them, let me tell you. But I would say, yes, you're correct. Those are the main ones that we think about, engage with, and work with.
00:39:10.560 - 00:39:13.820, Speaker A: Okay, so another question. Oh, go ahead.
00:39:14.270 - 00:39:41.750, Speaker C: So from the realty side of things, I'm exposed to this a lot. As a good rule of thumb, if there is an investment contract, it is a security, and it's under the purview of the SEC. And all the things that are going on on DYDX are not investment contracts, they are not solicitations for investment. But they are instead like products and derivatives, which is why they are under that. Is that match your understanding, Antonio?
00:39:42.330 - 00:39:48.374, Speaker B: Yeah, basically. And the derivatives would be the CFTC, but yeah, FinCen and CFTC are the major ones for now.
00:39:48.572 - 00:40:06.202, Speaker A: How about this? So this is a question coming in from our discord. So that notwithstanding, you guys haven't offered perpetuals today, but is there some path for when you might be able to eta for perpetuals in the US? I think a lot of our us listeners are curious.
00:40:06.266 - 00:41:10.610, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a great question. There's no ETA right now, if I'm being honest. Yeah, it's definitely something that, it doesn't seem like, at least within the next year or so, that any crypto company would basically be able to offer these types of more advanced derivative contracts to us customers just based on the current state of the regulation. I think it's definitely something where this is more like where we would take the strategy of working with regulators, really trying to educate them on the benefits of DeFi and kind of how a lot of that stuff can play into objectives that regulators also have. So it's not purely antagonistic I would say in terms of DeFi plus regulation, one of the other things that regulators care a lot about is just the health of markets. Just like making sure that the collateral is where the exchange is, that everybody can have transparency into what's going on with the exchange, like making sure that the collateral is there, that the operators aren't going to run away with the money. Decentralfi is a really good fit for basically solving some of these problems from regulators.
00:41:10.610 - 00:41:48.570, Speaker B: The other thing regulators care in the US about is who is trading these contracts and whether we agree with it or not, who has the financial sophistication to basically, from the government's perspective to be able to trade them. And I think that that's where most of the decision to block us customers comes in or where a lot of the laws come in is just due to the CFTC's objective to make sure that, and this is the CFTC's view, not my view, but make sure that less financially sophisticated people, however the CFTC defines it, don't have access to the more sophisticated financial contracts.
00:41:48.730 - 00:42:08.754, Speaker A: Right now in America we tend to define it as how much money do you have? What's your net worth? Yep, which is a darn shame, but that is the way it is right now, understand? Okay, so another quick hit question is when Dydx token, everyone's doing yield farming? Like where's the Dy DX token?
00:42:08.802 - 00:42:56.114, Speaker B: Antonio, I promise you, we are thinking about it and we're thinking about it very seriously on potentially a shorter time horizon, potentially like months from now. We have not made the decision yes or no whether we're going to actually do one. We're just really critically evaluating. How could a token be useful in DydX? What would it be used for? How can we get the community more involved in things like governance and stuff like that? How can we use it to just bootstrap growth of the community and of DyDX itself? So yeah, we're definitely thinking about it. No firm decisions yet, but something that we are looking to make a decision one way or another on in the next few months. And if we decide to do it, obviously look for us to release more information at some point and you guys.
00:42:56.152 - 00:43:03.334, Speaker A: Raise capital kind of the VC route. But what do you think of these fair launch style of projects that are cropping up these days?
00:43:03.532 - 00:43:31.550, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's really interesting. Yeah, I definitely think different funding models make sense for different types of projects. For us, the VC route made sense. That's not necessarily the best decision for every entrepreneur to take VC money. It really depends what you're trying to build. I'm definitely a big fan of a lot of the stuff that's been going on in Defi. I thought Yam was a great example, even though it had some security issues.
00:43:31.550 - 00:43:53.634, Speaker B: Well, of course it's going to have security issues, but that's basically what I think a lot of the stuff with the fair launch is trying to solve just allocating capital that's really in the community's best interest to allocate to some of these projects to kind of get them off the ground, get them the capital that they need to bootstrap the community and kind of let the community take over from there. So I'm definitely a big fan.
00:43:53.762 - 00:44:22.158, Speaker A: All right, here's a question that came in from YouTube. So this is on the subject of alternative infrastructure. So we've got ethereum, of course, we know and love. There's also these new, whether you call them eth killers or competitors or alternate L2s, whatever you call them, avalanche, polkadot, those sorts of things. Are you considering those infrastructures to host parts of DyDX? And also maybe you could talk about your starquare announcement and what that is.
00:44:22.324 - 00:44:39.570, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. It's a great segue to that. Basically, we in the past month or so, had done a ton of research in terms of scaling DYDX. Basically what's happened for us has happened for literally everybody else in the space is we're just spending a ton of money on gas, as you might imagine.
00:44:40.070 - 00:44:41.942, Speaker A: And you guys pay for all that? It's nice.
00:44:41.996 - 00:45:15.562, Speaker B: We pay for users gas. When you trade on DyDX, one of the nice things is you don't have to pay your own gas fees. So that's pretty nice once you've deposited. But yeah, trust me, we're feeling those costs. One of the things we wanted to solve is just obviously we've gone to the point where there is a lot of demand to use DyDX, but now we need to scale it. And DyDX is never going to be super big if it's not scalable. So we looked at a lot of these new blockchains, looked at a lot of ethereum native scaling solutions, things like optimism, things like the OVM, things like, obviously Starkware.
00:45:15.562 - 00:46:22.854, Speaker B: We also evaluated building our own optimistic roll up chain, which would kind of be special purpose for we really, the reason that we kind of ended up on the Starquare integration as kind of the best possible scaling solution for DYDX at this time was for a couple of reasons. So first Starquare, their scaling solution is live right now. It's already running in production with a couple other exchanges. So there's an exchange called diversify, which is already integrated with Starkware just on the spot side. But our work with Starquare has basically just given us a lot of confidence that we can build this next level of sophistication and these margin and perpetual systems on a scalable solution with software. And we're going to have it running in production not in years from now, but in months from now, probably like three to four months or so, that we're aiming to have this live, which I think is a pretty ambitious timeline because we literally just started working on this with them a month ago. We've basically, where we've gotten to is we finished all the research side so we know what we're going to build for the most part and we're actively building it right now.
00:46:22.854 - 00:47:11.782, Speaker B: So all the DydX engineering team is building this. A lot of the Starkware engineering team, they basically have come up with a custom scaling solution for us, Starquare. For those who aren't familiar, they're the leader in kind of using zero knowledge proofs and kind of starks to be able to scale blockchains. And the really high level fundamental way that it works is just like. So we're DydX, we have a bunch of trades we want to execute, right? And normally, so the way it works right now is for every trade that happens on DYDX, like any other Dex right now, that just maps like one to one with a transaction that gets sent to Ethereum. So we have to pay a linear amount of gas fees. Like if we make 2000 trades tomorrow, we have to pay twice the amount of gas fees as if we've made like 1000 trades today.
00:47:11.836 - 00:47:18.330, Speaker A: I bet you guys are spending the tens of thousands of dollars per month range at this point.
00:47:18.480 - 00:47:20.060, Speaker B: I'm just going to laugh at that.
00:47:21.470 - 00:47:26.410, Speaker A: I'm being very naive with that. Okay. Hundreds of thousands.
00:47:27.310 - 00:48:06.006, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a lot, but yeah, it's driving us in the right direction. Right. So that's kind of like one of the emphasis or one of the things that's driving us move towards the scalable solution and kind of moving on to the scalable solution. So basically what we need to do is we need to be able to support an unlimited number of trades. So how do we do that? And the way the starquare integration is going to work at a very high level is now instead of sending trades directly to the blockchain, when we want to execute them, we'll basically send them to Starquare instead. And then their services will basically buffer all of the trades that we want to execute. So maybe like 1000 trades or whatever in the last hour.
00:48:06.006 - 00:48:56.290, Speaker B: And then what they'll do is they won't send all of these thousand trades to the blockchain. Instead they'll use their magic, which is kind of zero knowledge proofs, which sounds magical, but it basically translates these thousand trades down into this constant sized data object. So it doesn't matter if it's 1000 trades, if it's 10,000 trades, if it's one trade. This data thing that basically proves that all of these trades happened is the same size, like in megabytes or whatever, or smaller than that. So it's the same size and that's where all of the scalability comes from. And then you take this little data object, which is like the zero knowledge proof, you submit it to the blockchain periodically and that's where all the scalability comes from. And kind of by our estimates this should get us at least 100 x reduction in gas costs.
00:48:56.290 - 00:49:30.722, Speaker B: Wow. So that's something that we're really excited about. Yeah. There's also a number of other really important benefits that we're going to be getting from the Starcorp integration I can just go through really fast. So the second is being able to support cross margining, which sounds like financially sophisticated, but basically all it means right now is right now for each perpetual on DYDX, they're margined separately. So it's like if you put down your 1000 USDC to margin your bitcoin perpetual, you can't use that thousand USDC to margin your link perpetual, you'd have to margin it separately. Okay.
00:49:30.722 - 00:50:10.410, Speaker B: But one of the features that other exchanges support, which is actually really important, is what's called cross margining. So you basically have one account, so you have your thousand USDC and that's used to margin all of your positions at the same time. So you could take a bitcoin position and a link position and it'd be collateralized by this same account. And this is also really important for market makers to kind of really capitally efficient, just support liquidity on new markets. So we're going to support cross margining with the startware launch as well. And that's also going to enable us to launch way more markets, probably on the order of 20 to 50, and then that next six to twelve months after launch.
00:50:10.490 - 00:50:12.586, Speaker A: By more markets, do you mean more assets?
00:50:12.698 - 00:50:14.558, Speaker B: More assets, yeah, like more trading pairs.
00:50:14.574 - 00:50:15.570, Speaker A: What kind of assets?
00:50:17.750 - 00:50:26.194, Speaker B: Something we're still trying to figure out. We're doing a lot of experiments. Like we just launched the link perpetual on Tuesday. Actually, we're probably exploring other things.
00:50:26.232 - 00:50:28.870, Speaker A: Link marines, hopefully any link marines watching.
00:50:29.020 - 00:51:25.638, Speaker B: Yeah, like things like wifis of the world, like other cross chain assets, like the big ones, like XRP, stuff like that. But yeah, adding lots more assets. That's the second improvement. The third improvement is like if you've used DYDX, it basically feels like any other decentralized app you've used right now where it's like you make a trade and there's some spinner on the site that waits until your transaction gets mined, which is fine, okay, we probably all understand that, but let's be honest with ourselves. Trading on a centralized exchange where your balances update immediately and it feels really snappy. It's just a way better user experience, and we're going to be able to support that as well in the instant trades after the Starcore integration. And then the last improvement, which is also really important but is a little more under the hood, is we're going to put the Oracle prices on zero knowledge world, which will basically allow us to have way more performant Oracle price updates than what exists on any other Oracle solution on Ethereum right now.
00:51:25.638 - 00:51:30.918, Speaker B: And that's basically going to allow us to offer a lot higher leverage at a lot lower risk to the platform.
00:51:31.084 - 00:52:10.178, Speaker A: Okay, I'm just going to summarize everything you said because this is super exciting. I didn't realize this. So what this all feels like to me is it's a major v two upgrade for DYDX. This is not a small tweak. This is like a major v two upgrade. And it's basically going to put you in terms of Ux experience and range of assets you support, on par with what centralized exchanges are doing, except exactly. Just as decentralized as you are today, meaning no one has to give up their assets, there's no KYC process involved, there's no black box where a bitmex can kind of cheat you and trade against you and do some nefarious activity.
00:52:10.178 - 00:52:18.662, Speaker A: Maybe not, who knows, right? And you're going to be able to do this in like a four month time horizon, right? Is that what you just said?
00:52:18.796 - 00:52:20.460, Speaker B: Yeah, that's exactly what I said.
00:52:21.310 - 00:52:48.180, Speaker A: I'm excited about it now. And one last question to kind of tie this off. So one big question is around composability. So diversify has their starquare roll up, right? And gods unchained I think they're using starkware as well. I heard that recently. Can you talk to the different. So you're going to use ethereum as a settlement layer, not like a Polkadot or avalanche, but can you talk to the other roll ups from your roll up? Does that make sense?
00:52:48.550 - 00:53:20.074, Speaker B: Yeah, basically no. Okay. Kind of like the one thing that we trade off, but we already kind of trade that off on DyDX because we haven't really gotten into this yet. But we use a central matching model right now, which basically means that we run a matching engine and like an order book in a centralized way. But still all of the trading is noncustodial and settled on a blockchain. So it'll be very similar to that in terms of the composability right now. But, yeah, we haven't been quite as focused on that as a compound or like a uniswap of a world, really.
00:53:20.074 - 00:53:28.334, Speaker B: RMO is just trying to provide you, the traders, with the best possible trading experience on DyDX and that's what we've been laser focused on.
00:53:28.452 - 00:53:41.826, Speaker A: Super exciting. David's chiming in. He's got three questions. Hey, David. And everyone listening. So we've got five minutes left with Antonio and we want to keep these to an hour. So could we try to do as lightning round questions as we can these next five minutes? Pack them all in.
00:53:41.826 - 00:53:42.414, Speaker A: Go ahead, David.
00:53:42.462 - 00:54:01.414, Speaker C: Yeah, two of these questions lump together really well. So what is the long term business model of DYDX? And is there a world where DyDX gets acquired by somebody of the likes of Coinbase or Gemini or some big gargantuan in the space, or are you guys going to go ahead and pioneer your own roads here?
00:54:01.612 - 00:54:33.842, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a great question. So there's kind of like two things that Duidx has right now. So it's like the centralized, matching centralized company runs that we take trading fees, we make revenue, and then the second thing is this decentralized protocol, and that's kind of where we're thinking about the token potentially coming in over time. So I think we'll see just these split a little bit more over time. Yeah, of course, the centralized part could be acquired. I'm not going to sit here and say that it couldn't, but definitely the decentralized part will continue to be its own autonomous decentralized network and then another follow up.
00:54:33.896 - 00:54:47.318, Speaker C: So one thing I'm really bullish on is every single entity that has and operates its own l two is incentivized to have its own on ramps and like, DyDX especially would benefit from having its own native on ramp. Have you guys thought about this?
00:54:47.404 - 00:54:48.726, Speaker A: You mean fiat on ramp too?
00:54:48.748 - 00:54:50.040, Speaker C: Fiat on ramp, yes.
00:54:50.810 - 00:55:10.110, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. We thought about it. Yeah. I think it's something where if we did it, we would partner with another product that does kind of like a fiat on ramp. But we want to just again, make the product experience for trading on DYDX as simple as possible. And I definitely think fiat on ramps in the product, whether that's like us totally building it or integrating with somebody else, is something that's important.
00:55:10.260 - 00:55:28.178, Speaker A: So a question from Sid. Other projects in DeFi, are these platforms, right, composable money Legos, that sort of thing. Dhedge is building on synthetics. Are there some ways that DyDx can act as a platform? It's kind of an underlying primitive money Lego for other things to be built on top of.
00:55:28.344 - 00:55:57.374, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. There are. I'd say it's not our main focus right now, but there are a lot of interesting things that have been built on top of DyDX, actually. And DyDX also supports flash loans, if you've heard of that marketing lingo before, which I'm sure you have, a lot of the flash loan applications kind of go through DyDX as margin protocols right now. So that's like a good example of how things can be built on DyDX. So definitely, I think it's important as well.
00:55:57.492 - 00:56:03.086, Speaker A: Other price oracles. Do you plan to integrate price data feed from other oracles besides what you're using right now?
00:56:03.188 - 00:56:38.070, Speaker B: Yeah, we're definitely looking into it. So we have two oracle providers as of Tuesday, so we're using Chainlink for the link perp for that oracle, and then we use the makerdal v two oracles for kind of all the other stuff. What we're basically building for the starware integration is kind of like I was saying before in the advantages spiel was that we're kind of building our own oracle solution there, which will kind of work similarly, and we'll integrate with the maker Dow V two network for price oracles, but it'll basically just feed the prices into zero knowledge lands way faster and more accurately than they exist on Ethereum. So it's a bit of like a hybrid solution.
00:56:38.150 - 00:56:50.240, Speaker A: This is all going to go through the zero knowledge land that you're talking about, the starkware implementation as well. Very cool. All right. A super secret pseudo anonymous account just asked the question, is EtH money? Antonio, how do you answer?
00:56:51.330 - 00:57:02.162, Speaker B: Definitely? I mean, we're using it as collateral, you can trade ETH, trade on the price of Eth, use it as collateral like you would any other stable coin. So definitely, there you have it.
00:57:02.216 - 00:57:38.670, Speaker A: Thank you for the ETH perpetual, by the way. I think that's great for the ETH bulls. Okay, last question for me, and then I think we're going to have to wrap it up. We've got two minutes left is how could the bankless nation help you guys? So I've used this term, we're on a path to become more and more bankless over time, right? Like decentralize as much as we can. It's a journey, it's not overnight. But one of the things that we love to support is obviously decentralized exchanges doing the sorts of things that centralized exchanges could do before. Kind of like, I love to use the term bye bye bitmix.
00:57:38.670 - 00:57:55.138, Speaker A: DyDX and other bankless protocols can start to replace some of these things. How can the bankless nation, I guess, help you do that, get involved? Are there other ways to get involved in your governance token if you choose to release one? What can we do to help?
00:57:55.304 - 00:58:38.450, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I think definitely the best thing you can do is getting the word out there, just in terms of posting about it, talking to other traders or people that you may know, which could be good users of DYDX, using the product yourself, giving us feedback, we constantly want to iterate and just make the product the best possible that we can make it for you. Yeah. In the future, if we do decide to do governance token, just participating more in the governance, stuff like that. But absolutely, we think of DyDX as a product, as an exchange, and we would just want to make it the best for you and everybody else. So it's really helpful. As much as you're all able to get the word out there, ask questions, that's how people learn and then just keep talking about it.
00:58:38.600 - 00:58:52.678, Speaker A: Awesome. I see Qaz put it well. I feel like a sponge soaking up the knowledge of the ocean. Referring to this conversation we just had with Antonio from DyDX. He's the founder of DyDX. This has been your AMA, bankless nation. Thanks for joining me.
00:58:52.678 - 00:59:14.330, Speaker A: One last action item for you. If you want to support DYDX and what it's doing, try it out. Be careful of know derivatives, margin training perpetuals, not for the faint of heart. Test with small amounts of funds. Like you got to know what you're doing with this stuff. It gets dangerous and risky quickly. But if you want to try it out, the best way to do that is type in banklist.
