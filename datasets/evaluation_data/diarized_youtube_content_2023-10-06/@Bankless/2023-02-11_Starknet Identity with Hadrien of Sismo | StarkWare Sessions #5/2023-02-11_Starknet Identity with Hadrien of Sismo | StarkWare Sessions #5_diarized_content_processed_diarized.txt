00:00:02.970 - 00:01:03.998, Speaker A: Welcome to Bankless, where we explore the frontier of Internet money and Internet finance. And sometimes that frontier is at a conference like last weekend, where over a thousand developers, founders, builders, and investors attended the Starkware Sessions in Tel Aviv in order to participate in growing the StarkNet ecosystem. This is Bankless's Starkware Session series, which are nine bite sized episodes interviewing the founders, builders, and ecosystem developers of StarkNet. Every once in a while in the crypto world, a conference happens, but not everyone is available to attend. Don't worry, Bankless has your back, because I go to basically every conference that's out on the frontier, and I bring an entire podcast studio in tow with me in order to make sure that the Bankless nation stays on the frontier of what's happening in crypto. In this interview, we are talking to Sismo, and Sismo is an identity tooling set to help express your identity across all of your ethereum addresses. Sismo lets you connect all of your ethereum addresses, whether you have your board apes in one address, your crypto punks in another address, or your governance tokens in a third address.
00:01:03.998 - 00:01:54.666, Speaker A: Sismo lets you prove what you have in your wallet, or what you've done in your wallet to some sort of third party, some sort of web app, anything that's trying to access your identity, but it lets you keep yourself private in the process. So say, for example, you are trying to get into this party that is token gated by board apes, but you don't want to DOX your address to that website. Sismo allows you to do a ZK proof of the state of your address to prove to anyone about the credentials that you might have in that wallet without having to DOX your wallets. And it's also useful for combining all of your identities across all of your wallets that you may use, so that you can express all of the access that you have across all of your wallets all at once without having to DOX these things together. The use cases for this are endless. And so we go into all of these details and more in this interview with Sismo.
00:01:54.698 - 00:01:55.646, Speaker B: But first, a moment to talk about.
00:01:55.668 - 00:02:45.274, Speaker A: Some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible. Kraken has been around for almost as long as crypto itself. As crazy as crypto is, kraken has remained a rock for its clients, building out a platform designed to stand the test of time. Kraken is all about proof, not promises, which is why they've pioneered a proof of reserves, a system that lets Kraken's customers verify for themselves the solvency and responsibility of the Kraken exchange. And for this reason, and many more, we've chosen Kraken as Bankless's strategic sponsor for 2023. And once you're done using Kraken to get your dirty fiat money into pristine crypto assets, perhaps you should check out Arbitrum, where so much of the frontier of crypto innovation is taking place. Arbitrum just announced their Stylus initiative, which is their brand new programming environment that lets developers deploy apps using their favorite programming languages like Rust, C C alongside regular old solidity EVM apps.
00:02:45.274 - 00:02:50.734, Speaker A: Sets can use any coding language they like, and it simultaneously drops layer two fees by an order of magnitude.
00:02:50.782 - 00:02:51.490, Speaker B: It's a big deal.
00:02:51.560 - 00:03:39.582, Speaker A: So many of your favorite DFI apps have already deployed to Arbitrum, like Uniswap. But did you know that Uniswap isn't just for ERC 20 tokens anymore? Uniswap is also an NFT aggregator too. To make sure that you are getting the best price on your NFT purchases, uniswap gives NFT collectors and traders powerful tools, all from the cozy comfy Uniswap interface, by the way. It's also got a native Fiat onramp it's also deployed on like, every layer two, and it's got this nifty cool thing called a universal router that ensures that you always get the best price on your trades. Crypto protocols like Arbitrum and Uniswap are becoming super powerful, so make sure that you're also using a wallet that's equally as powerful, or else you'll be missing out. If you're looking to upgrade your wallet experience, check out Phantom, the number one wallet of Solana, which has recently come to both Ethereum and Polygon. Phantom has native NFT support, giving you your own NFT gallery from inside the wallet.
00:03:39.582 - 00:03:49.602, Speaker A: Phantom is both a browser extension and a mobile wallet, and is also the only wallet to span both the Solana and Ethereum ecosystems. Check it out at Phantom app. And now let's get into the interview.
00:03:49.666 - 00:04:01.606, Speaker B: Welcome, Bakeless Nation, back to the Starware Sessions. We are on day two, and I have completely lost my voice talking to everyone here over in Tel Aviv, Israel today. And right now we're talking with Adrian from the team. Adrian, welcome.
00:04:01.708 - 00:04:03.450, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks, thanks. It's going to be great.
00:04:03.520 - 00:04:06.394, Speaker B: Yeah. How's your conference going so far? How's day two?
00:04:06.592 - 00:04:14.330, Speaker C: It's going really great. A lot of cool stuff are happening, a lot of ZK people. So for a team like us that are doing ZK, it's always great.
00:04:14.480 - 00:04:20.250, Speaker B: So we're of course going to talk about Sismo, and I want to see if you can explain Sismo in a sentence.
00:04:20.330 - 00:04:21.214, Speaker A: But then we're going to talk about.
00:04:21.252 - 00:04:23.066, Speaker B: StarkNet and then we'll go back to Sismo.
00:04:23.178 - 00:04:23.406, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:04:23.428 - 00:05:00.794, Speaker C: So Sismo uses ZK proof so that you can selectively reveal stuff from your wallet. So let's say that you have a big wallet with many, many data. We're using ZK proof so that you can just take a piece of it and we tokenize it as SVT. So let's say that you have a wallet with many NFTs DeFi, stuff like that. You can just pick one data, one NFT, and you get a Solborn token on another address that is virgin, that is empty, that just proved that you own this NFT. So by doing this, you have chosen a piece of data and you can use this new address to connect on applications and to just bring the data you want, basically.
00:05:00.912 - 00:05:07.594, Speaker B: And this is of course an identity conversation to help express who we are, but also keep ourselves private.
00:05:07.642 - 00:05:08.238, Speaker D: Right?
00:05:08.404 - 00:05:23.122, Speaker C: Exactly. Yeah. It comes from the fact that I think that in real life, you always choose, depending on the context, what you bring to the table, what part of your identity you bring. So, like coworkers party, you don't bring the same identity that's in your coworking space.
00:05:23.176 - 00:05:23.586, Speaker D: Right.
00:05:23.688 - 00:05:35.526, Speaker C: And so it's a bit similar with CISMO. What we're trying to do is that from your sovereign data, from your wallet or even other web two accounts, you can exactly choose what you want to reveal when connecting to an app.
00:05:35.708 - 00:05:46.598, Speaker B: Okay, so I want to ask you about how you ended up overall in the StarkNet ecosystem. How did you get started? Was it with the Starkx or StarkNet? How did you get started and why did you pick the StarkNet ecosystem?
00:05:46.774 - 00:06:23.670, Speaker C: Yes, just to be 100% clear, we're not yet deployed there. We want to just to give instance of what CISMO is. Like users in their front end, they generate ZK proofs like that. I have a certain NFT and then we need to verify it. And Sysmo allows you to verify it on chain, on Ethereum, on EVM chains, but also off chain. Like a server can just check the proof and we plan to deploy on Sarknet to verify in that's we're not live yet. But I'm a good friend with a lot of people that have been in the ZK space for quite some time.
00:06:23.670 - 00:06:33.738, Speaker C: I was working with Ave and we worked with them on bringing Ave to there. So, yeah, lot of friends in common, but not yet fully deployed there.
00:06:33.904 - 00:06:51.178, Speaker B: Is there something specific about Starknet's technology that is conducive to what you're working on in CISMO? Or can you also do this on well, I'm assuming you could do this on layer one, but that would probably be really expensive. What about other layer twos and then why did you overall pick StarkNet?
00:06:51.354 - 00:07:18.994, Speaker C: Yeah, so I guess that Sysmo is a bit like we're not defined by blockchain. What we do is a bit option. We generate proofs and you can verify it anywhere. So any blockchain can be a substrate. For now, we are mainly on EVMs, so we are on Mainet Polygon agnosis. We'll soon be on other chains like Optimism and like layer twos and Sarknet. So we are really chain agnostic, basically.
00:07:19.132 - 00:07:25.290, Speaker B: So you actually don't need block space, do you? You don't need to consume block space to produce a proof.
00:07:25.790 - 00:07:26.540, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:07:27.390 - 00:07:27.802, Speaker B: Okay.
00:07:27.856 - 00:07:32.742, Speaker C: Yeah, we make it available on chain for two reasons. First, so that smart contracts can use it.
00:07:32.816 - 00:07:33.294, Speaker D: Right.
00:07:33.412 - 00:07:53.410, Speaker C: And the other thing that is important I think, is like the SBT parts is that it's the standard that is well used even by off chain applications. So by putting in off chain, it makes it the proof the Attestations is usable. It's composed by Snapshot Guild, like all the tools that are token gated, basically.
00:07:53.480 - 00:07:54.402, Speaker D: Sure. Okay.
00:07:54.536 - 00:07:56.530, Speaker B: How did you come up with the name Sismo?
00:07:56.870 - 00:08:09.126, Speaker C: Actually, it comes from the fact that seismology it's like signal science. And so our goal is like, from all the noise that you have on your wallet, you pick one and you reveal just this one.
00:08:09.228 - 00:08:30.590, Speaker B: Okay, so let's talk about how this is conducive to identity. And I watched you give a talk this morning, and you of course use the example, and this is a frequent example used in the web Three world of you get to pick and choose parts of your identity in the moment that they are relevant to the context that we want to talk about. Can you elaborate on this and then talk about how Sismo enables?
00:08:33.910 - 00:09:14.874, Speaker C: Our thesis is that there's going to be more and more sovereign data that you own on the ID on your wallet. And then now that you own your social capital, that's not the case in web two. In web two, like, your data is on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and they don't let you do anything with it. It's impossible to create an event when you invite your Facebook and Twitter and LinkedIn friends because they are so competitive on their data. It's not yours, it won't be shared. Like Twitter API is not payable. Now that you have several wallets, several identity, your dow identity, your private wallet, your ENS, now it's yours.
00:09:14.874 - 00:09:35.582, Speaker C: You can leverage it together. But let's say that you want to prove your total amount of ETH. Let's say that you have three wallets with 500 e. You're lucky then. You're lucky if you have that. But imagine that you can dream. You could potentially prove that you have more than 1000 ether without creating any link between your wallets.
00:09:35.582 - 00:10:13.374, Speaker C: So that's where CISMO comes in. It's like, for now, we allow you to granularly reveal part of your wallet per wallet. And soon we'll do also this on an aggregated version, meaning that you import in CISMO vaults, like all your wallets for now. You can now start generating ZK proof from any of them. And soon you'll be able to prove anything from the aggregated data that you have on all your wallets without creating links with them. So the users is the only one that has the aggregated view and the user can bring exactly what they need or want to the app.
00:10:13.492 - 00:10:13.774, Speaker D: Okay?
00:10:13.812 - 00:10:32.114, Speaker B: And so one important nuance that I want to pull out here is like, say I have three wallets. I've got my NFT wallet. And personally, my NFT wallet is also David Hoffman E. And so it's also where I have my ENS name. And this is my public wallet. It's my you know, I also have my DeFi wallet. Don't look at that one, that's mine.
00:10:32.114 - 00:10:59.022, Speaker B: And then maybe there's like another wallet out there. That's my gaming wallet or something. And so the idea is you can use sismo to take all the properties you want from any wallet and the point is to not be able to link them together. So I can express what I want from each of these wallets. But the important point I want to drive is that maybe there's an app that is asking you about some data that you want to provide but you don't want to link these wallets together. You also don't need to link any wallet to that app. Right.
00:10:59.022 - 00:11:09.602, Speaker B: Because the app isn't asking for your wallet, it's just asking for perhaps a proof. So it's not only about not linking the wallets together, it's also not about showing the wallet in the first place.
00:11:09.656 - 00:11:25.058, Speaker C: Right, definitely. Yeah, that's exactly this. What we allow to do is the app will. Yeah, we're trying to fight against the sign in with Ethereum version one. We love it. Of course you can connect with your, as you said, your in s wallet. It's a signal wallet.
00:11:25.058 - 00:11:53.826, Speaker C: Everything that is here is public. So you can share it, you know, that it's here. But now let's say that you want to leverage your social capital from your private wallet. You don't want to share it. So yeah, we'll have this proof with CISMO button basically that you can embed in any app and it's a sort of competitor but not really to sign in with Ethereum. But basically by clicking this button it's redirect to CISMO where you generate your ZK proof and then you back to the app and the app just knows, okay, you have a board ape or.
00:11:53.848 - 00:11:59.986, Speaker B: You have so you said not could be competitive with signing with Ethereum, but.
00:12:00.008 - 00:12:01.122, Speaker A: Also could not be.
00:12:01.256 - 00:12:17.080, Speaker B: We recently did a podcast with Wayne From signing with Ethereum and we talked about these things called data vaults. Couldn't esismo ZK proof be something that goes into the sign in with Ethereum data vault? As in like you can create that proof and then have that available to you.
00:12:17.690 - 00:12:18.342, Speaker D: Exactly.
00:12:18.476 - 00:12:28.022, Speaker C: That's what first, we are not competitors because we can just enhance sign in with Ethereum apps. Let's say you connect to I know, like Finland. You know Finland?
00:12:28.086 - 00:12:28.314, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:12:28.352 - 00:12:43.822, Speaker C: They are doing like from your history, you have a city or stuff like that. And so you're already logged in with your wallet, your public wallet. But what if you want to import data from your private wallet? You could use CISMO from it. So it's not competitor. You can just use it to boost you bring the data that you want.
00:12:43.876 - 00:13:00.360, Speaker B: Right. I was actually in the Philian discord saying like hey, I just logged in with Ethereum to do my stuff but you guys should use ZK proofs to do this. I was in the discord telling them and then of course this is exactly what you're doing.
00:13:00.730 - 00:13:59.062, Speaker C: Yeah, that's our goal. And generally I think what thing that is interesting let's say that you want to create a newsletter for Ethereum stakers and you want to verify that they are all ethereum stakers. You don't want their address, of course you don't want it. So it will be a very simple app. You just have a proof of more, you redirect it to CISMO, you prove that you are a staker, then you get access to the email news later. We also did something, I don't know if you seen this, but with the foundation, the merger pass, it's an NFT that gives access to conferences and basically having the foundation computed the list of the 130 contributors to the merge. And to get the NFT, instead of just there's a whitelist and instead of just giving their wallet to get the NFT, they used Tismo to generate a ZK proof that they were part of the whitelist without really so this was the ZK Drop first app that uses this proofismo flow.
00:13:59.206 - 00:14:25.970, Speaker B: So is there a conversation to be had here about websites or companies or projects collecting user data? Because perhaps with GDPR requirements, you don't want to be receiving too much data that you don't need. And so maybe from the user perspective I might only want to give you a ZK proof to protect my privacy, but from the company perspective I might only want to receive certain data because I don't want the rest of that data. Is there a conversation here as well?
00:14:26.040 - 00:14:26.530, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly.
00:14:26.600 - 00:14:59.542, Speaker C: So first I think companies like Ledger, they don't want the addresses, but they want to do some loyalty programs. So it's outside of GDPR. But now we've been talking with Ariani. It's a project that lets big brands like LVMH, like Louis Vuitton, stuff like that, to tokenize their bags. And they want to tokenize the bags so that they can have a relationship with their customers but GDPR. And so they need a privacy layer. They need to not be able to track their users.
00:14:59.542 - 00:15:09.134, Speaker C: So they're talking with us. And CISMO could be like a GDPR compliant layer for these loyalty programs or supply chain stuff.
00:15:09.332 - 00:15:28.340, Speaker B: Okay, so question for you. Say there's a party that you need a board Ape to get into and I don't have a board Ape. Can I go to my friend who does have a board Ape and I can get him to make a ZK proof of his board Ape and then sell it to me? And then would that work?
00:15:31.350 - 00:16:05.914, Speaker C: No, basically no. Just wanting to be sure to have the right answer the way it was that you would create an SBT of your board Ape ownership first, in our current process, you need to prove ownership of both the source that is eligible, the owner of the board Ape and the destination. Okay, if you want him to create the DK proof, you need to give him also the private address or your real address. So that won't work. And then we have a nice property on our SBTS. They are actually more account bound, meaning.
00:16:05.962 - 00:16:06.560, Speaker D: That.
00:16:08.530 - 00:16:33.258, Speaker C: Your SBT order if you lose the address or if you sell it to someone, you always have the opportunity, by recreating a ZK proof of ownership of the source, to burn. It won't I'm sure you can find a way to give your private address to a friend, but you won't be able to create a market of it because there's always the incentive. I can get it back.
00:16:33.424 - 00:16:46.890, Speaker B: Okay, so just to check my understanding, I can make a ZK proof of an NFT that I have, and I can give that to a friend, but that friend doesn't have any assurances that I didn't do that again and again and again and kind of ruin the marketplace.
00:16:46.970 - 00:16:55.082, Speaker C: Yeah, so I wasn't precise enough. Like the ZK proof is like first you have the NFT and then you own the destination address that will have the SBT.
00:16:55.226 - 00:16:55.630, Speaker D: Okay?
00:16:55.700 - 00:17:09.750, Speaker C: So you need to have the ZK proof. You need to have both address at the same time. So your friend's address and yours, so you won't give your private key to your friend. Okay, so the only thing you can do is mint on a destination of yours, then give the private key to your friend.
00:17:09.820 - 00:17:10.246, Speaker D: Sure.
00:17:10.348 - 00:17:12.722, Speaker C: And then you always have the opportunity to burn and remain.
00:17:12.786 - 00:17:30.330, Speaker B: Okay, so I can make a ZK proof of my NFT and I have to also use a private key of a destination address for where the soulbound token goes, but I can give that to my friend. But then again, the friend doesn't really have any assurances that I don't do this multiple times.
00:17:30.480 - 00:17:30.890, Speaker D: Okay?
00:17:30.960 - 00:17:31.546, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly.
00:17:31.648 - 00:17:34.990, Speaker B: But I could still get into the party, though, because I could still give it to my friend.
00:17:35.140 - 00:17:50.820, Speaker C: Yeah, that's the version that we released today, but tomorrow so we have this big thing at etc. Like the conference in Paris. We have this masquerade. It's a privacy preserving party. And so to get in, it's going to be this. But then what's great is that.
00:17:53.110 - 00:17:53.474, Speaker D: The.
00:17:53.512 - 00:18:12.918, Speaker C: ZK proof will be off chain. It will be on a one time thing. So when you present to the event, you'll need to create the ZK proof on your mobile app, prove directly that you have the punk, and then you access. Unless you share your wallet to your friends, you won't be able to do that.
00:18:13.084 - 00:18:24.780, Speaker B: Okay, we talked about so the soulbound token goes into the destination address. I think we might have skipped over that part of the conversation. Can you talk about the role of the soulbound token in the yeah, so.
00:18:25.470 - 00:18:49.730, Speaker C: Let'S start again with ZK proof. So I do as ZK proof that I have an eligible account for a specific batch. I'm part of the group of you're in the club? Yeah, I'm in the club. I have a board Ape. I'm part of it. I create a ZK proof. Then from ZK Proof, we can use it off chain service, can just check it, no SBT involved.
00:18:49.730 - 00:19:18.510, Speaker C: Or we send ZK proof on chain to what we call a Zkat tester. It's a smart contract that verify Uzika proof. It's valid, so it checks you have an eligible source. It checks also that you own the destination. So it verified SDK proof and then it means the SBT on your destination. And third it stores what we call a nullifier is the fact that to make sure that you won't be able to use the same source twice to get two badges. So one source, one batch.
00:19:19.250 - 00:19:29.940, Speaker B: So when it comes to the roadmap of Sismo, how does this thing get started? What is the first sort of ZK proofs that you guys generate? How does this play out in the future?
00:19:30.790 - 00:20:31.400, Speaker C: So today we have these SBTS. They are starting to be used to gate some, like I think of Zkpay that is a project on Aztec that gates their community to people that have been using Aztec. There are also a lot of personal tokens, like in theory CISMO IO you can easily create a Ziki badge like click click, like no code UI, a Ziki badge for all your Lens followers, for instance. So we have this I think it's great, but it is great, but we're trying to aim wider, meaning we want to really help application developers to gate their services to specific users without getting their wallets. That's what we were saying about so we'll go to the market with the Provisysmo button that is easy to integrate. Basically, step one, you choose your gate. Like I want to get a service to my Lens followers or people that follow Vitalik or I don't know.
00:20:31.400 - 00:20:44.326, Speaker C: Then you get the button to integrate in your front end and then all the solidity library if you want it to be SBT or an off chain package to verify the decay proof.
00:20:44.358 - 00:20:53.680, Speaker B: Anyway, so for the listeners that are listening right now, we have a lot of Lens users and Farcasters users in the Bakeless Nation. Is that probably where they might run into?
00:20:54.690 - 00:20:55.246, Speaker D: Exactly.
00:20:55.348 - 00:21:30.650, Speaker C: Yeah. Yeah, that's farcaster's. Lens. They are actors within the system ecosystem on two sides. First they are sovereign graphs, right? So you can prove stuff from your parkaster. I can prove that I follow you on Parcaster, I can prove that I follow you on Nance and then they can integrate CISMO to do specific stuff like follow me only if you prove me that you are part of the Proof of Humanity registry. And so on the two sides, I think we're building infrastructure for these kind of people.
00:21:30.650 - 00:21:39.050, Speaker C: That's our focus. We want to onboard CV resistant teams that build these groups anyway. Yeah, we're building for them.
00:21:39.120 - 00:21:39.946, Speaker D: Very cool.
00:21:40.048 - 00:21:44.670, Speaker B: If people want to start experimenting or just read more about CISMO, where should they go?
00:21:44.820 - 00:22:14.214, Speaker C: Yeah, we're trying to keep the doc updated a lot, so it's always an iteration process. So go to docs. Sismo IO and create your first DK badge on factory CISMO IO, it's a very simple app. You choose your group of eligible accounts from, like, you can say, like, my Snapshot voters, people that follow me on. You can use many things you'll see, like subgraph, like, many things. So you can create your ZK badge. You choose the metadata, and it's live.
00:22:14.214 - 00:22:24.922, Speaker C: So that's the things that you can do today and keep updated within the next two months. We'll release this, devtooling the prove with CISMO button. That will be so exciting, I think.
00:22:25.056 - 00:22:29.626, Speaker B: I'm looking forward to it. What's the website and any other social medias that you want people to follow?
00:22:29.808 - 00:22:30.106, Speaker D: Yes.
00:22:30.128 - 00:22:41.130, Speaker C: So it's CISMO underscore ETH. That's the twitter. That's the main lending with the Docs. The Docs is our main lending, I would say docs ysmo IO.
00:22:41.210 - 00:22:41.502, Speaker D: Awesome.
00:22:41.556 - 00:22:51.460, Speaker B: Adrian, for the rest of your time here in Tel Aviv and at the Starquare Sessions, what's exciting to you? What talks have you liked, what have you enjoyed? Who have you talked to? Anything that stand out to you so far?
00:22:51.830 - 00:23:03.320, Speaker C: Yeah, so it was actually one of my first Stocknet conferences, and I met so many people working on ZK stocks. I'm more like a ZK snark guy.
00:23:04.490 - 00:23:06.840, Speaker B: I don't know what that means, but I love it.
00:23:07.610 - 00:23:35.390, Speaker C: I've met a crazy amount of people that just blew my mind. Like, yesterday, I was an event, and wow, the community is big because I thought that I knew a lot of smart and great people in ZK, and it's twice the size, actually, so I think it's just getting started, like, all this DK stuff and yeah, the crowd is amazing. I sincerely advise you to go this kind of conferences.
00:23:35.890 - 00:23:38.110, Speaker B: Is the Seismo team going to be at East Denver?
00:23:38.630 - 00:23:45.378, Speaker C: We're not this time. We have to ship what I told you about, like, two months of sprints and then we'll go, like, many hackathons until SEC.
00:23:45.464 - 00:23:46.770, Speaker B: ECC is the big one.
00:23:46.840 - 00:24:04.146, Speaker C: SEC is the big one, and we have our big party. So, yeah, we're going to be all in on SEC. And before that, we'll go at East Porto, East Dam, and we'll do a lot of hackathons. So always happy to help you guys get started with Cisco.
00:24:04.258 - 00:24:05.478, Speaker B: Adrian, thank you so much.
00:24:05.564 - 00:24:07.138, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks a lot for the invitation.
00:24:07.234 - 00:24:07.698, Speaker D: Cheers.
00:24:07.794 - 00:24:12.160, Speaker C: Cheers. You.
