00:00:00.250 - 00:00:19.578, Speaker A: And I do see this in, like, broader Solanas. Like, they don't emphasize the role and importance of money in the same way that bitcoin exclusively does. And a large part of Ethereum definitely does. Like, the last time we had you on bank list, like, we asked you, like, is soul money? And you're like, soul. Soul's not money. And to us, I'm like, that's, that's the thing. We start there and we expand outwards.
00:00:19.578 - 00:00:38.760, Speaker A: But without your base chain becoming money, then you don't have, you can't expand outwards from that. Agree with you. I don't think it matters to Solana, devs or community. If all the volume that was happening on there was going against wrapped ETH pair, everyone would be just as happy. Like, holy shit, we got it to work. Everything's, like, working. Really? Yeah.
00:00:38.760 - 00:00:57.454, Speaker A: If ETH was the unit of account in Solana, you think Solana fee would be like, nice, cool, great. Yeah, because the message bus works. It's coordinating state. Everyone is paying very cheap fees, and everything's working. King. Look, as an ETH Maxi, I would love ETH to be the unit of account inside of Solana. That would be awesome.
00:00:57.454 - 00:00:58.810, Speaker A: Whatever. Like, who cares?
