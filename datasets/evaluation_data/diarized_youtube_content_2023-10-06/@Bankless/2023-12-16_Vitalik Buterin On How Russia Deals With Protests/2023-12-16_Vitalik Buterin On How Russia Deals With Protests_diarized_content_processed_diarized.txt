00:00:00.170 - 00:00:31.010, Speaker A: One of the things that's been happening in Russia is that you'd have protests. And the authoritarians discovered this one weird trick, which is you let the protest happen. You send the police out and you do the usual protest versus police thing a little bit, but you don't aim to crush it right then and there. But you have the cameras out, and then you identify who all of the key people in the protest are. And then at some point later, at 02:00 a.m. They get a knock on the door, repeat. And about a hundred times and five years later, suddenly you have almost no one left to lead the protests.
