00:00:11.780 - 00:00:34.848, Speaker A: Hey, bankless nation, we are back. We are live streaming this special edition panel episode. The theme here is finding common ground. So we have some alternative layer ones, some of the founders of Solana, Avalanche and possibly Terra. We'll see if Doequan shows up in just a minute. But, David, give us some context for this panel. Why are we doing it? What's the hex going into this?
00:00:34.934 - 00:01:32.656, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the industry is still unpacking 2021 because it was such a crazy year, definitely the craziest year in crypto's history like period. And the mental model that I have for this is that the start of 2021 was really Ethereum rising out of the bear market and having a lot of success. And then in the wake of that, a lot of newer l ones to crop up on the scene with different design structures, different blockchains, also capture a bunch of users. And there's been a ton of demand for users to do crypto stuff. And a lot of these newer layer ones have innovated in new ways that have enabled a lot of new people to come into the crypto ecosystem. And so we want to unpack just a little bit about where we all have common ground with all of these different blockchains. All blockchains are blockchains, which means we have common ground somewhere and we want to find where that is and then grow that ground, grow that area of real estate of which we all share.
00:01:32.656 - 00:01:55.924, Speaker B: So that is the panel that we are having today. We invited Anatoli, Eman and Doe from Terra Solana and avalanche. Doe, I don't know where Doe is. We don't know where Mia right now. Yeah, he's the Mia at the moment. If he comes in the next few minutes, that would be fantastic. Otherwise, we have Anatoli and Emmen, who's imminently about to show up right after we get through some of these other messages.
00:01:55.924 - 00:01:59.092, Speaker B: Ryan, what else do you have to say about this fantastic panel?
00:01:59.236 - 00:02:20.784, Speaker A: Well, I think I just want to say that the theme for this panel is good vibes only in 2022. So we're going to have a productive conversation. I think crypto is a little bit tired of a lot of the tribalism goes on. So this is a great opportunity to not be tribal and just have a great conversation. So that's what we're going to do. Guys. Some other announcements, housekeeping things as we get in.
00:02:20.784 - 00:02:45.400, Speaker A: The first is we've got a conference coming up. This is the permissionless conference. I believe avalanche and Salana are going to be there. Tara maybe too, not sure but this is a fantastic conference coming in May 17 to 19th. Just wanted to let you know to get your tickets soon for this event. Tickets go up every two weeks and batches are released every two weeks as well. So grab your ticket to this event.
00:02:45.400 - 00:03:01.516, Speaker A: Both David and I will be there. Also wanted to give a quick PSA from our friends at Xerion because they've incorporated some new L2 and multi chain features in particular. This is a Xerion portfolio. You see this, David? Look at this. What am I doing here?
00:03:01.698 - 00:03:03.400, Speaker C: It looks like you're swapping networks, Ryan.
00:03:03.480 - 00:03:14.048, Speaker A: You can swap networks now in Xerion. All of your assets in one place, one user interface. Really cool. Also tell them about bridging, David, because Xerion enables some bridging as well.
00:03:14.134 - 00:03:43.370, Speaker B: Yeah, bridging is a very complicated world because there's going to be so many bridges of so many different types. And that's why I'm kind of bullish on the world of bridge aggregators or bridge obfuscators, where it lets you do exactly what Ryan is doing right now, which is not care about what bridge you're using and just simply being able to send your assets to the place that you want to go without having to worry about the details about how you got there. And so that's what Xerion is doing, is making bridging easier so we can all become bridge ors. In 2022.
00:03:43.740 - 00:04:00.076, Speaker A: We are all migrating to L2, all grading to different side chains. Getting off the Ethereum l one. That's the message here. Get on L2, connect your wallet, use Xerion to hop across those bridges. Get started. There's a link in your show notes to do that. All right, guys, we're going to be back with our guests in just a minute.
00:04:00.076 - 00:04:03.968, Speaker A: But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.

00:06:34.500 - 00:07:02.932, Speaker A: Hey guys, welcome back to this special panel edition. This is the finding common ground panel with some alternative layer ones. We've got two here that we're going to talk to first, want to introduce you to Anatoly, who is the co founder of Solana, and also introduce you to Eman, who is the founder of Ava Labs. We are missing our third panelist, Dokwon. He might show up in the episode at some point in time. If he does, we'll just let him right in and roll along with the conversation. Gentlemen, it's great to have you on bankless.
00:07:02.932 - 00:07:03.610, Speaker A: Welcome.
00:07:04.140 - 00:07:06.168, Speaker D: Nice to be here. Thanks for having me.
00:07:06.334 - 00:07:27.840, Speaker A: All right, this is going to be a fun episode, I think. And I think it's something the crypto world is craving. And I just want to throw out some ground rules as we enter this conversation. So I don't think this is really a debate. I think this is about finding common ground, that we all have some ground rules. I think for our guests, good vibes only. This is the podcast we want good vibes only.
00:07:27.840 - 00:07:52.424, Speaker A: I think the crypto community wants to see good vibes from the leaders in this space, including David and myself. Also plain speak. We're going to try, whenever possible, not to talk technical. The community has asked that we sort of speak at a plain speak language as much as possible, not get too in depth in the weeds. And the third ground rule is letting people finish their sentences. I know we're very excited. Have a lot to say.
00:07:52.424 - 00:08:11.570, Speaker A: Let's let everyone have an opportunity to talk. David, you and I have some ground rules as well. We are not representatives of Ethereum on this episode. We are merely moderators. Not today. So we're not arguing aside. We're just here to be good hosts and move the conversation forward and be as hospitable as possible.
00:08:11.570 - 00:08:14.368, Speaker A: Great to have you guys on bankless. You ready to start?
00:08:14.534 - 00:08:16.096, Speaker E: Yeah, let's do it.
00:08:16.278 - 00:08:31.930, Speaker A: All right, let's start with this first question. I think this is an important values alignment question, and I expect we'll have a lot of common ground on it. And the question is, why are you in crypto? Why are you in crypto? Anatoly, you want to kick us off with that?
00:08:32.460 - 00:09:23.256, Speaker E: Yeah. I had this idea that it's possible to use these byzantine fault tolerance systems to build an environment where there's no intermediaries for trading. And this was because this was something that I did in my spare time. I did it for fun. I used to connect to interactive brokers or a bunch of forex trading platforms and trade via their APIs, and I was always feeling like my trades were getting in a little later than everyone else's. The data I was getting was a little slower than everyone else's, and there was this barrier to entry there that was kind of impossible to cross. As a hobbyist, and when I kind of had the technical idea for building a system like Solana, that was the first use case that I thought of.
00:09:23.256 - 00:09:45.440, Speaker E: And that's really what drove the first, I would say, three years of development. How we were thinking about the use case we're building and everything we're trying to deliver, is that okay? Hobbyists can connect to this network with just a piece of metal, and they're in the same level playing field as Alameda or jump, and that was the goal, and still is the goal.
00:09:46.180 - 00:10:00.820, Speaker A: Just curious. Anatoly, quick follow up on that. A lot of people came to crypto for like a sound money thesis, right, as a result of what they would say is misuse of monetary policy and kind of the fiat world. Is that you or is that not?
00:10:00.890 - 00:10:31.852, Speaker E: No, but I totally get it. And I thought that was a really very important thing that crypto could enable. My family, growing up in the Soviet Union, saw the failure of government to experience it firsthand, myself included, like my parents. They left in 1992 with $350 to seven people. That was it. That was the only thing that the Soviet Union will let you leave with. So that was kind of.
00:10:31.852 - 00:10:57.588, Speaker E: I get it. I strongly get it in a very core sense, and I totally appreciate the folks working on that side. But what I was passionate personally, was like, bits, and sending these bits as fast as possible around the world and as fairly as possible, which was where my skills set lies and what I was inspired to do, and not trying to compete in the sound money thesis at all, but definitely appreciate it.
00:10:57.754 - 00:11:00.820, Speaker A: Eman, curious. Same question to you. Why are you in crypto?
00:11:00.980 - 00:11:45.424, Speaker D: So I like building big things that work, and it comes from a different kind of background. I grew up at a time, and in a country where things did not quite work, you would go to the airport and the systems were down, you would go to the bank. They'd say, come back the next day when you close the door. It wouldn't close perfectly, completely. Now, I remember going into my middle school at the time, in american school, and seeing that everything actually perfectly matched. The doors were no longer draughty. And that instilled in me a sense for things that have a life of their own, that live on the internal in some virtual universe, subject to their own rules, and continue functioning in a predictable, perfect manner.
00:11:45.424 - 00:12:15.920, Speaker D: And that got me going into distributed systems and starting in 2002 with the karma system that we built. I started getting into digital money, and the goal, of course, is to digitize all things of value, to create a universe where anyone can digitize something, send it around the world, and trade it, and in so doing, eliminate all the middlemen. You should not have to get permission from anybody. You should not have to be beholden to anyone else's rules in transacting with your valuable goods.
00:12:16.580 - 00:12:59.772, Speaker B: Guys, I find your quick backgrounds actually really fascinating, because I think both of your backgrounds actually show up in the blockchains that you guys work on. Anatoly, you talked about how you were working with trading, and you just felt like you were getting front run by people with more access and better privileges than you. And so that inspired you to make Solana, which I think has similar properties that make sure that everyone can do and eman same with you, where you like big things that work, where perhaps the experience that you had influenced why you're here in crypto and also the nature of the blockchain that you guys are building.
00:12:59.826 - 00:13:00.828, Speaker C: Can you guys just speak a little.
00:13:00.834 - 00:13:16.000, Speaker B: Bit to that about the values that you learned when you were deciding before perhaps getting into crypto and how it came to actually shape what you consider to be important inside of the crypto industry? We'll start back with Anatoly.
00:13:17.220 - 00:13:44.588, Speaker E: So I spent most of my career Qualcomm working on communications operating systems, like moving bits around through silicon. And that skill set is what I brought to Solana. And the use case that I thought of was this system that I'm building. It has to be good at something useful to humans. That was the prerequisite. And there were plenty of people already working on the sound money thing. And I was like, I don't think I bring anything new to that space.
00:13:44.588 - 00:14:39.532, Speaker E: I don't think I can build a better bitcoin or a better ethereum. So I never really thought of it as something for us to go after. And trading was something that I personally enjoyed as a hobbyist and had saw a clear reason why centralized systems always kind of tend to get to kind of a corrupted state, where it's not in the sense that it's corruption, where you're getting screwed. It's that you got to pay $10 million to Chicago Mercentel exchange for that preferred access. And to even be able to do that, you have to know the people, to even talk to them and be part of the club. And that, to me, always felt like just not great. It felt like I couldn't do what I was really interested in know, and I didn't think that initially, I kind of maybe.
00:14:39.532 - 00:15:31.336, Speaker E: Maybe these systems will actually flip CME and Nizi, and we'll see equities being traded on these open, decentralized systems. What I've realized lately over the last year is that the revolution that we're seeing is that everything is becoming DFI. Art is becoming DFI, social networks are becoming DFI, and that long tail of new use cases is going to surpass all these old financial applications by 100 miles. It's just going to outgrow everything. So where we've switched kind of idea is that what we're building is this thing for trading for price discovery, but we need to start building tools for humans to actually use it in day to day activity that they do on the web. And that could be nfts. That could be using that NFT to participate in a social network.
00:15:31.336 - 00:15:52.710, Speaker E: That's the monkey Dow that's now staking with a validator, whatever it is that they want to do right. It's kind of become much more consumer driven. Like, how do we apply this stuff to now consumers as opposed to jump trading or Alameda or even trading hobbies? Even though I believe both of those joining together is really what makes the space really interesting.
00:15:53.720 - 00:16:05.480, Speaker B: And Emmen, same question to you. What about your experiences in your young professional life led into how you decided to construct avalanche, or what you care about now that you're in the industry of crypto?
00:16:05.820 - 00:16:42.084, Speaker D: So there are a couple of things that struck me very early on. So one of the main things that I saw, I saw in the very first attempts at digital cash and how they failed, they failed because the banks intervened. You can't go through the regular channels and do a revolution. That's just not how it works. You got to bring something to the table that is multiple orders of magnitude better than what's there. You can't come in with, like a 15%, 20% better thing and say, hey, this is going to change things. So that made me stay in academia for actually a very long time.
00:16:42.084 - 00:17:13.560, Speaker D: I've been an OG in the space for a long, long time. Started out, I remember single digit bitcoins. I didn't actually initiate avalanche until I decided that there was something in our hands that was orders of magnitude better than what was there. So that's one of them. A second thing that characterizes my approach is to always build systems that are flexible, that do not have. I think this comes from my background as a graduate student. I worked on operating systems.
00:17:13.560 - 00:18:00.168, Speaker D: You want to build a substrate, something that lies at the bottom, that enables other people to get whatever they want done. You don't want to be prescriptive. You want them to be able to customize whatever they're building. So avalanche has this notion of subnets that allows anybody to create their own chains with their own rules, with their own virtual machines. So that is something that's actually fairly unique to avalanche, and it's quite different, and it plays to the heart of our values. The third and final thing is that all along I was always human oriented, not algo oriented. So there were a lot of people, especially in the early days, who were like, oh, bitcoin cannot be changed because the algorithm says 21 million coins, et cetera, et cetera.
00:18:00.168 - 00:18:25.396, Speaker D: And so they're right in what they're saying, but they're missing out the fact that these systems have to be serving their constituents, they have to be serving their users. So that led us in a direction where we're building a system that is within given parameters, admits governance and modification on the fly by its users. So all of these had a fairly big impact on the ultimate design of.
00:18:25.418 - 00:18:26.470, Speaker F: The system we built.
00:18:27.240 - 00:18:54.670, Speaker B: I'd love to know who are your guys'heroes, in this industry? Who are our ancient forefathers or four women who you guys think that have really the cipher punks of old, for example. Personally, I really look up to somebody like Amin Soleimani Ryan here might say Vitalik. Who do you guys look up to that are like the early ogs of cryptography or cryptocurrency or who comes to mind? Eman, let's start with you.
00:18:55.440 - 00:19:14.688, Speaker D: Let's see. So one of the first people I would mention would be Ron revest. He is the R in RSA. He's a touring award winner. Came up with some of the crypto that we use to sign our transactions. He's also brilliant across the spectrum. And every time I chat with him, I come away enlightened.
00:19:14.688 - 00:19:40.696, Speaker D: Another person that I look up to is Barbara Liskov, and she was a professor. She retired from MIT. Brilliant researcher. Set the path for consensus protocols, which are at the heart of all of these systems. And so there are also some other sort of more modern. So these are, I think, maybe two generations or three generations older than me. A couple more people that I look up to is Mike Burroughs.
00:19:40.696 - 00:20:09.152, Speaker D: He is the person from Alta Vista. I'm not sure if you guys remember this, but it was one of the big search engines back in the day. Probably the best engineered search engine of its day. Just a fantastic builder all around. And Jeff Dean, someone that I went to graduate school with who's an amazing builder at Google. A lot of the Google infrastructure that we all use came from his vision or his actual fingertips typing away at the code. So that's sort of my go to idols.
00:20:09.152 - 00:20:10.628, Speaker D: If I were to name them.
00:20:10.794 - 00:20:13.496, Speaker B: Anatoli, who are your idols or people.
00:20:13.518 - 00:20:33.610, Speaker E: That you look up to in the space? I would say Zaki from Cosmos. He was one of the first folks that I talked to that was like a true crypto. He was like a true crypto developer. And he's one of those people that you can call in the middle of the night and he will calm you down.
00:20:35.140 - 00:20:36.850, Speaker B: Is this something that you've done before?
00:20:39.060 - 00:20:41.010, Speaker D: You can call me know. Yeah.
00:20:44.660 - 00:21:55.370, Speaker E: He'S just an amazing person. Vitalik I haven't interacted with him that closely just a few times, but his writing, I think, is very crisp and succinct, and he's able to describe really complex topics to an engineer. I feel like he bridges that gap between academia and engineering really well at a personal level. There's a few folks that I worked with at Qualcomm that really shaped my career in terms of operating system design. Brian Kelly, I don't know if you would be listening to this podcast, but he was just one of the senior directors there that was designing a bunch of the operating systems on arm while arm was moving from architecture to architecture basically at every year. And it was such a breakneck speed of development on the hardware that I really kind of learned what it's like to code under the gun. When you have hardware that's shipping at a particular date and it's shipping with bugs and every delay is costing like a company $10 million or something like that, you're under a lot of pressure to deliver and solve hard problems really quickly.
00:21:56.540 - 00:22:25.980, Speaker A: So, guys, now we get to get into the meat of this a little bit more and ask a question I think is on everyone's mind in the crypto community. Some of us in this panel represent maybe different tribes within crypto, although we have just so much in common. But I want to ask the meta question of why do you think crypto is so tribal? And does it actually have to be? Does it have to be tribal? Why is it tribal? And does it have to be, what do you think? Anatoly?
00:22:26.140 - 00:23:27.892, Speaker E: So I kind of came into tech in the 90s as a teenager, and I remember people arguing with passion and vitral about linux file systems, like the file system that you pick in your config, in your kernel config when you're booting up linux. People were tribal about that and turns out there was one evil file system, but that's a different story. The thing that I think what people get about these technologies like movements is that when you participate in these, you're thinking about all the future things that the singer will enable. You're kind of putting a lot of faith in these ideas and how it's going to change the world. And that's almost a religious experience, right? Like this idea of an open source movement taking down Microsoft. That was a big deal, right? Like you were battling a company that was like a giant monopolist run by Bill Gates that was just squashing everyone, right? And this fledging community of people are just coding for fun. You kind of get bought into this.
00:23:27.892 - 00:23:48.670, Speaker E: And I feel that's true about crypto. We're trying to change the world and we buy into these ideas and you think about what is this going to be 20 years from now? How is this going to improve the world and change everything? And that is a faith. That's faith, right? So we argue about it like we argue about religions. It's part of the human experience.
00:23:49.760 - 00:24:03.330, Speaker A: Do you think that crypto is a bit more political than something like a Linux file system by nature? Right? It's kind of about decentralization as a political concept. Does that make it a little different?
00:24:04.820 - 00:25:17.768, Speaker E: I think at that time in the open source was almost a political movement and a lot of folks actually became tried to interact with politics and governance and get us governments to adopt policies that taxpayer money should only be spent on open source software development. And these were really core important things to folks. They took time out of their own life to go do this. Right? And I think we're seeing similar things now with decentralization and open finance because there is kind of not a single enemy like Microsoft, but kind of this vampire squid that's like slowly sucking the blood out of everything, both on the web through advertisement and those kind of negative loops and in finance through fees and everything else that people deal with. These are powerful movements. I feel, I guess blessed to live through multiples of these, like the web, open source and now crypto. But it's also a curse, right, to have that much, so much change happening in your life.
00:25:17.934 - 00:25:21.690, Speaker A: Eman, what do you think? Why is crypto tribal? And does it really have to be?
00:25:22.060 - 00:25:50.580, Speaker D: Well, it shouldn't be. My dream is that we would stop fighting over the same pool of users and focus on growing the space. Some total, we're about 1 trillion and some total. There's about 700 trillion worth of assets out there. And the chains that win will not be the ones that say the meanest things about each other. They're going to be the ones that can absorb that growth, that can make those use cases happen on top of their platforms. So that's very clear to all of us.
00:25:50.580 - 00:26:24.572, Speaker D: And you're right. Despite that, this area does attract a level of tribalism that I actually have not seen in many other areas. I've seen the open source movement, of course. I have seen the editor wars, emacs versus Vi. I fought on the side of one of them that I'm not going to name because then I'll lose half my audience. But money is inherently political, and it's so deeply ingrained in our consciousness, everybody thinks they're an expert at it. That's also another thing that factors into this.
00:26:24.572 - 00:26:54.696, Speaker D: If you can balance a checkbook, then suddenly you think you're an economist, and suddenly you've got all these people opining on all sorts of technical issues that really ought to belong to a couple of people who've done some measurements and ought to be resolved by science. And so instead of scientific discourse, we find ourselves in vitriol. And it's not a good look for the industry, for the space. But I think we'll grow out of it. Or maybe we won't. I mean, I actually don't think we're going to grow out of it entirely. It's just always going to happen.
00:26:54.696 - 00:27:01.690, Speaker D: But the folks who absorb the message that, hey, moving on and expanding is the right strategy are going to be the ones that win.
00:27:03.360 - 00:27:40.440, Speaker A: That's cool. Thanks for these answers, guys. We're going to switch it up and throw some community questions your way from Twitter. The first is from Yankee. USt on Twitter asked this question prior to the show. Do you see your chains as complements or substitutes to each other? I think, Eman, you were maybe advocating for a more expanded pie. But at the end of the day, is there some competition between these chains? Are they substitutionary or are they, I guess, synergistic and complementary?
00:27:40.780 - 00:27:55.928, Speaker D: They are essentially complementary. So, first of all, let's dispense away with the killer word. There is no killing done in this space. There are chains that are technologically dead. Anatoly knows this. Every techie knows this. They ought to be dead.
00:27:55.928 - 00:28:22.084, Speaker D: And the horses lying down on the ground with the four legs facing into the sky. But yet they're traded. They're round, and they're not disappearing. So even dead chains are actually quite alive and walking. So that's, I think, something that everybody needs to absorb. There will be times when I will criticize anatoly for some technical choice, and he will understand what I'm saying. He might do the same to me, but those are technical discussions among technical people.
00:28:22.084 - 00:28:56.136, Speaker D: So in general, it's not one against the other. So all of these chains have a different vision, and they have far more in common, far more in common than they have against, in opposition to each other. For example, avalanche and Ethereum are working in the same EVM space. The more we have in the EVM space, the better it is for both of those ecosystems. So Solana is pushing the envelope in a variety of different areas. In terms of engineering, in terms of building a community, in terms of appealing to a different set of programmers. Their programming language is quite different.
00:28:56.136 - 00:29:33.224, Speaker D: So I'll name other ones. For example, Tezos is appealing to a functional programming environment. So there are all sorts of different approaches to this whole thing that are essentially going to complement each other. And it's not I win a dollar by taking it from you kind of an environment. There is so much out there that isn't digitized, that hasn't come into blockchains, that that's where the real battles ought to be and are actually, that's where we are fighting. Because avalanche at least, or avalabs certainly, is spending its time coming up with new assets to build on top. We're coming up with new use cases, new virtual machines to build on top of our platform.
00:29:33.224 - 00:29:40.636, Speaker D: So that's, I think, the thing that's going to get us out of this more ass of people who seem to be inward oriented at each other's throats at times.
00:29:40.738 - 00:30:01.380, Speaker A: So, Anatoly, same question to you. Emmett says there's no such thing as a killer. There's no such thing as an ETH killer or a bitcoin killer or a Solana killer. At some level, we're all in this together, but there has to be some element of competition, right? I mean, somebody's got to win. What would you say to Yankee UsT's question? Compliments or substitutes?
00:30:02.200 - 00:30:50.480, Speaker E: I think the killer part comes from if the developers just stop building, eventually that thing will, in theory, right? As long as there's somebody working on this open source project over the weekend, you can't really kill it. And we saw that with Microsoft trying to kill all sorts of things that were much, much smaller than any of these chains. So that part, I think, is kind of like just a silly thing to think about. But I think there's definitely competition because there's overlapping use cases. Every chain can run nfts. So now we're competing in that use case. Those projects that are built on top are now competing for the NFT space, NFT users, NFT enjoyers.
00:30:50.480 - 00:31:32.080, Speaker E: And that competition, I think, is very healthy because that forces innovation at that border between complicated technology and consumers. How do you figure out key management? How do you figure out what is a good ux for a wallet and all these other things? You get to see a bunch of different experiments run, and the best of those are the ones that succeed, but they're not exclusive to that chain. You start seeing people copy all the best practices, like almost instantly. And that's really the driver, innovation driver of growing the space, getting more users to have their keys, full custody, ultimately a good thing. But it's competition. That's fine. I like competing.
00:31:34.820 - 00:32:01.950, Speaker A: Let's set some context before we ask this next community question. So I think the context is crypto is very much on a path towards becoming more decentralized over time, at least at its best. Right. Bitcoin is trying to do this through distribution. Ethereum is trying to do this via a variety of mechanisms. I assume your projects are trying to do this as well. So the question from faithful Stewart is, what's your chain's plan to become more.
00:32:01.950 - 00:32:14.360, Speaker A: Yeah. At some point on the centralization versus decentralization spectrum, assuming you want to become more decentralized, how do you do that? Eman, what would you say to faithful Steward?
00:32:14.520 - 00:32:58.236, Speaker D: So the very first thing that's essential for any system to become more decentralized is to have at its very core, a protocol that allows people to participate. If that is exclusionary, if it is, for example, as we saw in the case of Libra, it's just Zuckerberg and 27 of his best buddies at most, going up to, they had visions to go up to about 100. And, you know, they had to scuttle the whole project. It didn't go anywhere because they failed to decentralize. So if that's your path, then you're going to be limited. And we see, for example, with avalanche, we spent a lot of effort in coming up with a protocol that accommodates millions of participants in every single decision. So that's number one.
00:32:58.236 - 00:33:40.490, Speaker D: Number two, of course, is the ecosystem on top. You want to accommodate as many use cases as possible, as many programmers as possible, and provide to them both a familiar environment, if that's what they so choose, or an environment that they can custom tailor to their needs. And that's what we do. We have both the contract chain, which is EVM compatible, and we have the ability to create subnets for custom use cases. So these all bring in new use cases. And the ultimate in decentralization is the set of people that we attract, the set of people who are part of our ecosystem. And we're working, I think overall, all of us, and not just avalanche, but I think for all of us, we're trying to expand that pie.
00:33:40.490 - 00:33:57.276, Speaker D: And I'm really excited about what has happened. I think we saw in the last year or so that systems like Avalanche did not exist 15 months ago and it went from zero to where it is today. And that's been a tremendous driver for us. And we plan to continue on that path.
00:33:57.388 - 00:34:09.104, Speaker A: And Eman, concretely, how do you think Avalanche can become more decentralized? Like, what's the next thing that you feel like you could implement? The chinks in the armor right now that need to be filled?
00:34:09.232 - 00:34:54.016, Speaker D: Sure. So currently we have only three subnets that are in production and we have a couple of testnet subnets that are really seeing a lot of use. So as we have more subnets, where you're going to see a very exciting development. I've been saying this for a while now. Nobody takes it seriously, but staking services and validation services are going to become a real revenue driver, not just for the platforms themselves and the people who hold those platform tokens, but also for people who are participating as validators and stakers. Validators and stakers don't do much today, but soon there will be actual use cases for differentiated validation services, validators that do more than just vote on transactions. So that's coming.
00:34:54.016 - 00:35:21.064, Speaker D: And as that comes in, you're going to see all sorts of people participate in making blockchains more decentralized, and there will be essentially a business model developing around them. That's one of the main ways in which we're pushing the envelope. And of course, another step forward for the avalanche community is to bring the costs of joining the system as a validator, the default networks as a validator, so that more people can participate in avalanche itself.
00:35:21.262 - 00:35:26.860, Speaker A: And, Natoli, how would you answer that question? What's Solana's plan to become more decentralized?
00:35:28.640 - 00:36:45.040, Speaker E: So I think there's some things that we can do and that's more engineering focused and that's similar to what Eman's talking about. Reduce the cost to join the network, make sure it's permissionless to entry. I mean, those are the obvious things. And reduce the number of failure points. And that could be things that you see Ethereum do, like multiple versions of the same client, because the more teams you have that understand the protocol at that intimate level, that they could be able to write it, the more kind of, you're reducing kind of Keyman risk, right? The bus factor is much lower. And all these things are parts of decentralization. And I think the bigger picture there is, do you have enough humans that actually care that this thing is decentralized to use it, take advantage of these features, that decentralization buys them, that there's a reason for this thing to exist and for that to move forward without the latter, without actual demand for self signing, self custody, actual humans signing transactions and doing something on these chains, the work that you're doing in decentralization becomes pretty pointless, right? You may do the work, but then no one's actually going to run these systems and care about them and make sure that they're operating correctly.
00:36:45.040 - 00:37:03.230, Speaker E: So that latter part is a mixture of time and use cases that have product market fit. And that latter part is the harder part. That's not engineering, that's actually trying to understand what humans need out of these systems and building for them.
00:37:04.320 - 00:37:34.900, Speaker A: Anatoly, the bankless thesis has very much emphasized decentralization, particularly at the base layer, the layer ones. But there are others with kind of like a different thesis on the space, basically pushing back and saying, hey, the most decentralized chain doesn't always win. Do you believe that? Do you think decentralization is the thing that makes a layer one fail or succeed? Or do you think there are other things that are even more important for.
00:37:34.970 - 00:38:33.640, Speaker E: Our particular use case? If it came to a point that it's possible for some set of the network to prevent a hobbyist to plug in and get at the same information level playing field as everyone else, I would consider that a failure and I would probably start a different chain. So that part of it, right, that physical guarantee that anybody in the world can throw a piece of metal, even if it's a very expensive hunk of metal, but at least they can do that and permissionally start getting in the same Levin playing field in terms of information as everyone else. That to me is a critical piece. And I feel like if we succeed there, plus there's humans that want this system for something, right? There's some real product market fit on the human side. Everything else would just be taken care of over time. That's just a function of time. So that core part, I think both of those need to exist.
00:38:33.640 - 00:38:51.420, Speaker E: And that's a different thing than sound money or something like that, or whatever. Nuclear war resistant, finance bunker coin, whatever you want to call that. Two different use case, three different use cases, potentially.
00:38:52.880 - 00:38:56.990, Speaker B: So, guys, that was all of our serious philosophy type questions.
00:38:57.440 - 00:39:37.660, Speaker D: I didn't get a chance to react to that. Let me say a few words. Yeah, let me say a few words. Actually, Ryan, I'm actually really worried about the issue you raised. So the issue is, does the market know enough to evaluate the claims of these chains? And something that you always worry about if you have a high quality product is a cheap knockoff. And many of us, in fact, everybody on this podcast, obviously, is working on chains that are working really hard to get truly decentralized or have worked really hard to be truly decentralized. And then along comes Joe's centralized shack, okay, Joe's centralized blockchain.
00:39:37.660 - 00:40:33.724, Speaker D: And you got to worry, because they can suddenly excel in metrics that are really hard to excel in because they've given up on one of the most important things in this space, which is decentralization. So they can boast all sorts of numbers, they can cut corners, essentially. And the thing is, will that be seen and evaluated properly by the market, or will the market just go along? Because most of the time everything is good and it's a sunny day, and you don't really have to worry about the leaks on the boat until the storm comes in and starts shaking it, and that's when it sinks. So this is something I actually worry about quite a bit at the end of the day. And we have seen this happen, too. We have seen chains rise, and we've seen chains get adopted as if they are fundamentally sound. When many of us knew that they were at their core, they had centralized points of failure or they weren't decentralized enough.
00:40:33.724 - 00:41:17.596, Speaker D: So this is something that actually does worry me and that we've worked really, really hard to be able to compete even with those folks who are at the extreme ends of that trade off. That is, our algorithmic innovations are so good that we are competitive with them, but it's still something that worries me. And at that level, I think we do have to just rely on user awareness. We have to get the word out that there is a big difference between chains that are deep down centralized versus the chains that are actually bringing something new to the table versus the ones that have true technology and true decentralized foundations. So I think at that point, it's up to all of us to educate the public about the differences here and.
00:41:17.618 - 00:42:16.560, Speaker A: The values in the space, it always seems on that. Like Eminen, the thing that trips people up is like, people don't know where to draw the line, right? So bitcoiners will say Ethereum is too centralized, right? And some people in Ethereum will know Solana, avalanche, and Terra are too centralized. And then maybe this panel collectively says, well, we've got binance chain and Tron and Zuckerberg coin, and that's where we draw the line. So that is the hard part, I think, for new entrants to the market. What gives me peace, I'm wondering if the panelists agree with this is, in the long run, the market will just figure this out, won't they? Things will happen, hacks will happen, centralization vectors will be attacked, single points of failure will fall, and the market will figure this all out. But in the interim, there's a lot of, I guess, miseducation and noise and questioning about these things. Would you both agree with that?
00:42:16.710 - 00:42:29.620, Speaker D: Absolutely, 100%. I think the storm inevitably comes someday. That's the nature of these tail events. And when it does, it exposes problems with decentralization very easily.
00:42:30.040 - 00:43:14.210, Speaker B: And I definitely agree that this is definitely the hard part about onboarding people into crypto, because these are the hardest lessons to learn. Right? Like, decentralization is such a new word for so many people outside of the crypto industry that when they come into this industry, the newer. I remember coming into 2017, not really appreciating decentralization and just kind of thinking that peer to peer money was like the cool new thing and not really realizing actually how to measure or reason about decentralization. It's a very hard thing to reason about, especially for the newcomers. And so, guys, that was all of our philosophy, serious type questions. But in the second half of the show, we have some more candy type questions. I want to tease the second half of the show with this candy type question here.
00:43:14.210 - 00:43:29.030, Speaker B: What is your favorite blockchain? That's not the one that you are working on. So if your blockchain went down, God forbid, and you had to use a different blockchain, what blockchain would it be? Anatoly, let's start with you.
00:43:29.660 - 00:43:47.150, Speaker E: Shoot. I don't know. I haven't thought about anyone else's blockchain in a while. I would like to try avalanche, I guess I haven't tried it yet. I'll just be nice to him.
00:43:47.520 - 00:44:05.808, Speaker D: Sounds good. We'll give you some coins if you bridge over. That's a very easy question for me. Without a doubt, ethereum. So I'll just flip over my network and pay the extra fees and go back to what I used to use.
00:44:05.974 - 00:44:25.336, Speaker B: Well, that question was going to be a little bit more fun if we had doe here for a three person panel, but we don't. We just have you guys. If he's like, oh yeah, okay guys. So we have questions like that, such as do you think your own asset is money? And what do you think about l two s versus l ones and bridges? And some very fun questions coming up.
00:44:25.358 - 00:44:26.296, Speaker C: Right after we get to some of.
00:44:26.318 - 00:44:28.584, Speaker B: These fantastic sponsors that make this show possible.
00:44:28.702 - 00:44:30.216, Speaker C: When you shop for plane tickets, you.
00:44:30.238 - 00:44:33.412, Speaker B: Probably use kayak, Expedia or Google to compare ticket prices.
00:44:33.476 - 00:45:03.300, Speaker C: So why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto? When you make your trades, you want to make sure you're getting the best possible price on your trade, and that's why you should be using matcha. Matcha has smart order routing that splits your trade across all the various liquidity sources in Ethereum and is also operational on polygon, avalanche, Binance, smart chain and other chains. Trading on Matcha is super easy because it pools the liquidity for me in a single easy to use platform and allows me to make limit on chain orders. So you can set and forget your defi trades and they will go through automatically while you're away.
00:45:03.370 - 00:45:04.852, Speaker B: So when you're making a trade, head.
00:45:04.906 - 00:45:45.440, Speaker C: Over to Matcha XYZ slash banklist and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets. The Gemini exchange has been my exchange of choice ever since I got into crypto. I use Gemini to both buy the dips and also manage my regular automatic monthly purchases of my preferred crypto asset. On Gemini, you'll find over 50 different cryptos, including many of the top DFI and metaverse tokens like Wifi and Axio Infinity. Using Gemini earn, you can earn yield on your various cryptos, including 8% on the GUSD stablecoin. Gemini is available in all 50 states and more than 50 countries worldwide. So if you're looking to upgrade your crypto exchange, sign up at Gemini with Gemini.com
00:45:45.440 - 00:45:50.164, Speaker C: gobankless and get $15 of bitcoin after you trade $100 or more within.
00:45:50.202 - 00:45:51.364, Speaker A: The first 30 days.
00:45:51.482 - 00:46:19.852, Speaker C: That's Gemini.com gobankless. Bankless is proud to be sponsored by Uniswap. Uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure. Instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans, uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on Ethereum that lets you trade any token at the current market price. No human counterparties or centralized intermediaries, just autonomous code on Ethereum. Input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy.
00:46:19.852 - 00:46:38.820, Speaker C: The Uniswap grants program is accepting applications for grants. Do you have something of value that you think you want to contribute to the Uniswap ecosystem? No matter how big or small your idea is, you can apply for a unique grant@uniswapgrants.org and help steer uniswap in the direction that you think it should go. Thank you, uniswap, for sponsoring bankless.
00:46:40.120 - 00:47:08.072, Speaker A: Hey, guys. We are back with the finding common ground panel. This is with the alternative layer ones Anatoli from Solana, and we have Eman from avalanche. Guys, when we finished the last conversation, we left a few questions hanging. And one, I think it's really important, at least has been important, as David and I have sort of explored crypto. And that is the question about the monetary value of the tokens underlying your platform. So are your assets.
00:47:08.072 - 00:47:35.076, Speaker A: Money is the avax token. Money is the sole token money. The reason we think this is important is because that can be what gives the token additional value. And of course, in these economics, crypto economic systems, additional value means increased security. So let me throw it over to you. Anatoly, is sol money. Are your layer one assets money, would you say?
00:47:35.258 - 00:48:07.712, Speaker E: So if you lived in some planet where you could magically communicate with everyone simultaneously, and that was guaranteed, you wouldn't need Nakamoto consensus, you wouldn't need BFT. All you would need is cryptography to build money. That would be the only thing that you'd need. So in a world where Solana is at its peak, right, it's the system where information state transitions pass through it at speed of light, through fiber. It is that thing. It's that planet. And you can build money on top of it.
00:48:07.712 - 00:48:32.356, Speaker E: But I don't think of the token or something like that as a money in sense that users don't need to use it from day to day services, to transact in it, to buy coffee in it or to use it. I don't know. Yeah, I think of it as like, access to that magical communication bus where I send a message. It's guaranteed to arrive to everybody in the world.
00:48:32.458 - 00:48:34.152, Speaker A: So not a store of value then.
00:48:34.206 - 00:48:46.670, Speaker E: Anatoly, you could build a store of value on top of that planet, right? On top of this Tesla planet, where you stick a rod into the ground and you can talk to everybody. All you need is cryptography to build a store of value on it.
00:48:47.360 - 00:48:54.464, Speaker A: We're going to ask these same questions to Eman, but just a quick follow up while we're talking about. So what makes the sole token valuable then?
00:48:54.582 - 00:48:55.664, Speaker B: Why number go up?
00:48:55.702 - 00:49:44.076, Speaker E: Anatoly, this is, I think, a tough question because it's not clear that there is a clear. I think the only clear business case that I think I see in these systems is that owning soul gives you a percentage of the stake. That percentage of the stake means that you get to produce x amount of blocks. And producing those blocks is lucrative for some use cases such as MeV. But that's four degrees of separation. And this is the only thing that I've seen really as a real use case on Ethereum that has clear connection to the underlying token. But I personally don't think that may be the final use case or how the stuff plays out.
00:49:44.076 - 00:50:07.350, Speaker E: I don't know. Right. We're so early that we don't know yet. And you can say that safely because 1994, when you're looking at those bulletin boards and the first six degrees like email chain went out, there's no way you could have predicted that's going to be Facebook worth a trillion dollars, right? Like 20 years later. So we can safely say that we don't really know yet.
00:50:08.440 - 00:50:16.008, Speaker A: So, Eman, same question over to you. Our avalanche tokens, are they money? They have a monetary premium, okay.
00:50:16.094 - 00:50:53.520, Speaker D: Of course they're money. They can serve as money in transactions. The system is so fast finalizing transactions in under a second that you can use it for payments faster than you can use most credit cards these days, at least in the US. So that's a very good situation to be in. The token has other uses as well. It's used as a primary means of access to this underlying network of networks, the avalanche system, in which there's these multiple subnets live. And on those subnets you can do things like create new smart contracts, interact with smart contracts, stake, lend, swap, et cetera.
00:50:53.520 - 00:51:31.424, Speaker D: So it has utility, it has use cases, and it serves as the sort of the fluid that greases all of these financial wheels. And the main thing, of course, is that this thing, while it's money, our vision is not to compete with the world's monies. We are not trying to compete with bitcoin's store of value narrative. So even though we're actually a hard capped asset like bitcoin, that's not where our energy is going. We're going after the use cases that are not on the blockchain, we're trying to digitize all things so we have a very different vision and take than most systems out there.
00:51:31.542 - 00:51:36.400, Speaker A: Guys, I think a new player has entered the chat. I wanted to welcome Doe Kwan to the chat.
00:51:37.220 - 00:51:39.430, Speaker B: The YouTube chat is about to blow up right now.
00:51:41.480 - 00:51:50.260, Speaker F: Hey, guys, sorry I'm late. It was supposed to be 05:30 a.m. My time, but I accidentally set the alarm for 630. So really sorry about that.
00:51:50.330 - 00:51:59.192, Speaker A: No worries. Well, we appreciate you jumping on and joining. This has been a really fun conversation so far. David, should we just throw Doe right into the last question there?
00:51:59.246 - 00:52:00.248, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely.
00:52:00.414 - 00:52:02.120, Speaker A: That's the best question to start.
00:52:02.190 - 00:52:03.208, Speaker B: Let's do it.
00:52:03.374 - 00:52:18.370, Speaker A: All right. First thing in the morning for you, Doe. So the question is, are the underlying tokens of the terra blockchain, are they money? Should they have a monetary premium associated with them? And if they're not money, why should number go up?
00:52:20.660 - 00:53:17.680, Speaker F: Yeah, I mean, if you look at our Twitter handle, it's Terra money. So definitely the intention is for it to be money. But I think when I say money, I mean that in a slightly different sense from, let's say, when people say bitcoin is money or ethereum is money. So we generally think about what we're trying to do as creating a price neutral asset. So a stable coin that is pegged to things like the dollar or the crayon yuan or the british crown and so on and so forth. And then the idea is that people can enjoy programmable assets, so things that they can build in defi and so on and so forth, in a censorship resistant context, similar to bitcoin or Ethereum, while at the same time they maintain all the price stability characteristics of your local fiat currency.
00:53:19.220 - 00:53:39.364, Speaker B: So, Doe, we're going to have to catch you up and speed run through some early questions to get you up to speed with the panel. So the first two questions that we want to run through is, why do you care about crypto? And also, who do you look up to in the space? Who are your heroes or your idols that have influenced you in your time here in this industry?
00:53:39.492 - 00:53:42.040, Speaker A: And it's okay if you name someone on this panel, Doug?
00:53:44.640 - 00:53:47.870, Speaker F: Well, to answer the second question first, all of you guys, obviously.
00:53:49.840 - 00:53:51.900, Speaker B: Okay, but what about not on this panel.
00:53:54.100 - 00:54:44.830, Speaker F: In general? I think the people that are inspiring is if you look at the type of people that started building, like, many years ago, most of them have semi retired or fully retired at this point. And it takes a lot, right, because crypto runs 24/7 it definitely does take a reasonable amount of toll on your health. I actually used to be, like, 20 kg lighter when I started Terra, if that's useful context. But, yeah, the types of people that I find inspiring are the people that have been in the daily grind for three, four, or five years, yet at the same time still going strong. So I think these are the types of people that add tons of value to the industry and hope to be working together for a long time.
00:54:45.680 - 00:55:36.290, Speaker B: All right, now that we got a little bit of your background, we're going through some of the candy questions, and so we want to kind of unpack. I think the listeners definitely want to hear about the versions of crypto that you guys think will manifest. While there's spectrums in crypto, such as the decentralization centralization spectrum, I think another spectrum that we can all talk about is the l two versus multi l one world. And so what do you guys think about l two s? Will your chain have L2s, or will it be mostly emphasis on a multilayer one world instead? How do you guys reason about these things? And how does your blockchain fit into the future crypto world that you think is unfolding? Anatoli, let's start with you.
00:55:37.220 - 00:56:35.340, Speaker E: I think defining l two to strictly this idea of something like optimism or zero knowledge, proofs that verify that some computation was done correctly. Those are implementation details. Anybody could build this on Salana. So the question is, why would they want to, right? Like, what is it that they're trying to do with this thing? And the only reason they'd want to do this is because the execution layer on Solana is not sufficient for them, that it takes too long for some really big computation. But right now, that's not a bottleneck, and it doesn't seem like that's going to be a bottleneck for the next couple of years, at least. I don't know what things would change, but cryptographic operations that are typically the expensive parts that you run on Ethereum, unless they're built in, those are running at nearly native speed. And by native speed, I mean, like, SIMD accelerated speed on current processors.
00:56:35.340 - 00:57:19.280, Speaker E: It's, to me, unlikely that we'll hit those limits simply because current hardware does a million these things per second, right? So computation is just not the bottleneck and neither estate, I think both of those are fairly solved problems. It, I think, might be more necessary in this. Like, we only want to do settlement at the layer one and nothing else, and we'll build a thing for settlement and only that. And run these single core e two style validators. That may be the necessary design choice, but I don't know. We'll see. I don't see it as like a necessity.
00:57:21.540 - 00:57:22.764, Speaker A: Hey David, you're muted.
00:57:22.812 - 00:57:36.446, Speaker B: Eman, what's your take about the future? Multi L2, multi layer one, how do you reason about these things and how does avalanche fit into that? Eman, you're also muted.
00:57:36.638 - 00:58:03.658, Speaker D: Okay, so every L2 solution also works on avalanche. So we can accommodate any L2. That works on Ethereum just as well. But that's not where our scalability roadmap is taking us. So I understand where Ethereum wants to go with its own L2 based solution. And I'm not headed that way. I'm not headed that way because I have some concerns about where one might end up if one were to go that way.
00:58:03.658 - 00:58:53.110, Speaker D: And that is centralization land. All of these L2s that exist today, minus like some of the very esoteric ones that people worked really hard to build, most of them that you've heard of have single points of failure. They're centralized and then assuming at their best some future date when they get finally whatever they are too. The second version of them that has the sequencers all made redundant, et cetera. Even in that universe, the designs, the architectures lead to constructs where some central party is collecting all the rent, somebody is collecting all of the extractable value from the user stream. So you can end up wanting to build a new system that's really scalable and you end up reinventing the system as we have now. Congratulations.
00:58:53.110 - 00:59:30.838, Speaker D: You have Robin Hood and Citadel, and so I don't want to end up there. So that's why we have so much emphasis on layer one, scalability. Everything that can be done on layer one should be done on layer one. These l two s, they essentially take an opaque blob, do something to it and bring it back into the system. And that process that happens away from users, in many cases, users understanding at least. So there are many different paths for malfeasance. There are many different paths by which people can reorder what happens at the L2 level.
00:59:30.838 - 00:59:47.374, Speaker D: So that's not where we're headed, but we can accommodate any L2 to come. So we have a very different path on that front. Oh, and our subnets are the natural way to shard things and shard by use case, so that allows us to paralyze as well.
00:59:47.572 - 00:59:59.300, Speaker B: And though I have one more candy question after this serious question, so teaser on that one, but how do you reason about the L2s versus multilayer ones and how does Terra fit into that?
01:00:02.310 - 01:00:53.454, Speaker F: Yeah, from a non technical perspective, it just seems that the main distinction that people are driving between l two s and l ones is two things. Like number one, this idea that you would have better security in l two s because you're borrowing that security from another blockchain. But I feel like that differential is going to get squeezed out over time as bridges improve and things get more secure. So the mental model that I have is that the world is really just chains and bridges. And the reason why I think there should be multiple chains is because at some point, every chain is going to run into. It has finite state, right? So in that finite state, there's a limit to how much transactions that you can squeeze in. So you need to be able to offload it to different chains.
01:00:53.454 - 01:01:54.646, Speaker F: Now, the question is whether you offload that to an L two or to other l ones. And the way that I'm thinking about it is that once bridges become more secure, and as I said, that security differential gets squeezed out, it's all just going to be a world of chains and bridges. So in that case, I think the only difference would be where do these different blockchains declare their allegiance to? So, for example, as we're fragmenting state in that world, I think the only difference would be that these l two s are economically benefiting the token holders of an L1 to which they're swearing allegiance. It's kind of like a feudal system where there would be like a lord that declares allegiance to a duke, and this duke declares allegiance to a king. So it's kind of like a hierarchical file system where you don't necessarily borrow security, you're borrowing community from other blockchains. So I think multiple of these things would emerge. I think some blockchains would brand themselves as l two s.
01:01:54.646 - 01:02:07.900, Speaker F: I think some of them would largely associate themselves as being entirely sovereign. And yeah, I think it's going to be like the feudal systems, it's going to competing kings, competing knights and things like that.
01:02:08.270 - 01:02:22.960, Speaker B: And the question that I want to ask you is, what is your second favorite blockchain after Terra? If Terra, God forbid, went down or was lost for whatever reason, what would be the chain that you would migrate to?
01:02:27.810 - 01:03:14.480, Speaker F: We actually spend a decent amount of time thinking about that. So I would say the straight up honest answer that I would have to give is that there's multiple different candidates. We're big fans of Avalanche, we're also big fans of Solana. But for example, around the time that we started, the reason why we selected the Cosmos SDK was because we were super focused on payments, and there wasn't really a way for us to be able to get those payment margins down using a different chain, which is why we had to pick a chain where we could control the rules in a sovereign type of way. But now that's kind of different. So things are up in the air.
01:03:15.410 - 01:03:43.626, Speaker A: Guys, this has been a really fun panel, and I think, I hope listeners saw that there's a lot of common ground between these three projects, these three platforms, and maybe other projects in crypto as well. And thank you guys for being willing to do this. It's been a lot of fun. Closing question for all three of you is the same. Crypto loves predictions. Really fun to predict various things. Wondering what your highest conviction predictions for 2022 are.
01:03:43.626 - 01:03:49.850, Speaker A: Do you have any high prediction, high conviction predictions? Maybe. We'll start with you, Anatoly.
01:03:50.990 - 01:04:12.670, Speaker E: Man, I think we're going to see the first application with like 10 million users in, 22, like 10 million active users that are signing stuff, doing stuff. First decentralized application is going to break that barrier. Wow.
01:04:12.820 - 01:04:17.614, Speaker A: Big prediction. Emmen. Do you want to go next? What's your prediction for 2022, highest conviction?
01:04:17.742 - 01:05:02.846, Speaker D: That's a good question. So I'm a techie, I'm not much of a market person, but I suspect that this year is going to be far better than most people in the space think it will be. I suspect that a lot of the people that we are seeing are very much the early adopters, and the ones that actually have the loudest voices on Twitter are the ones that have been through many, many crypto winters, and those all happen in a very different environment. So I suspect that this year is going to be a huge boom year because the technology has finally come of age. So those things that we dreamed of for many years are now here. So that's my highest conviction prediction. In other news, I think easy predictions that I could always throw out the bridge wars are going to intensify.
01:05:02.846 - 01:05:24.386, Speaker D: That's going to be great for the users because you'll end up having an opportunity to sample a lot of these systems and see how they operate firsthand. There will be very big hacks, as there always have been. So that's always going to be fun. And overall, I'm super bullish in this space. That's my simple basic prediction, anatoly, predicting.
01:05:24.418 - 01:05:36.880, Speaker A: Millions of users, Eman saying that bear market bear participants be gone. This is going to be a bullish year. Doe Kwan, do you think you can outbullish these two panelists, your predictions for 2022?
01:05:38.050 - 01:06:33.102, Speaker F: Well, I don't know if I have a super bullish prediction, but there's a couple of opportunities that I think are going to be interesting. And these market cycles are difficult to predict, but at the same time, some elements are predictable. So, as I think in 2021, layer ones were super popular, and right now there's a lot of competition that's happening in the L two and then the layer below that, like L zero. So, like bridges and things like that. So what I think is going to be interesting is if you look at the interface of some of the stable swap protocols, like saber on Salana, for instance, or Trader Joe's on Avalanche, there's actually multiple bridged assets for the same thing. And this leads to pretty terrible user fragmentation. Now, the problem here is that the bridges themselves can't create products that solve this fragmentation problem.
01:06:33.102 - 01:07:08.620, Speaker F: So I think the next project that can very low hanging fruit be very highly valued is sort of like a wrapper around all the bridged assets that issues canonical assets, regardless of which bridge was used to bring assets on board. And this is fairly easy to do because every single app that uses bridged assets wants to solve this problem. And it sort of helps to co locate liquidity around canonical assets instead of having seven different versions of the same thing. So, yeah, I think that's going to be powerful. Maybe I'll build it.
01:07:09.070 - 01:07:10.060, Speaker E: Do it.
01:07:12.030 - 01:07:18.320, Speaker A: This has been awesome. Eman Anatole do Kwan, thank you for joining us today on bankless. It's been a lot of fun.
01:07:18.770 - 01:07:21.440, Speaker D: Thank you for having us. It really was a lot of fun.
01:07:22.290 - 01:07:30.890, Speaker A: We will do this again sometime, of course. Hand clap, applause these panelists, they have been instrumental.
01:07:30.970 - 01:07:31.214, Speaker E: What?
01:07:31.252 - 01:07:36.130, Speaker A: That's the wrong button. It killed the vibe at the end.
01:07:36.200 - 01:07:37.234, Speaker F: Look at them.
01:07:37.432 - 01:07:59.990, Speaker A: Rug pull. No. All of you guys, all of your projects have been responsible for onboarding a lot of users in the space and distributing a lot of private keys, and that increases the decentralization of our world, and that's a good thing. So we applaud you. Congratulations. Risks and disclaimers for bankless listeners, of course, ETH is risky. Avalanche, terra and Solana, they're also risky.
01:07:59.990 - 01:08:10.110, Speaker A: All of crypto is risky, so is Defi. You could lose what you put in. But this is the frontier. We're headed west. It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
