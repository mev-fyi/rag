00:00:07.610 - 00:00:17.566, Speaker A: Bankless nation. It is roll up time. This is the first week of September. Wow. Starting to feel like fall. Starting to feel like time to get back to school. But I haven't taken the summer off.
00:00:17.566 - 00:00:19.086, Speaker A: David, I don't know about you.
00:00:19.268 - 00:00:32.370, Speaker B: No, this summer I'm not feeling. I've only gotten more and more just like energetic and crazy and like every week that has happened, it's just like, how are we going to do the weekly roll up? This is absolutely insane.
00:00:32.450 - 00:00:36.566, Speaker A: Yeah. How are we going to fit this within a two to three hour?
00:00:36.748 - 00:00:39.160, Speaker B: How do I explain what's going on?
00:00:39.770 - 00:00:57.342, Speaker A: Guys, we will keep this as short as possible. As always, we're going to cover markets, releases, news takes, what we're excited about. End with the meme of the week. I think we have a moment of Zen for you, too. Hey, before we do, we got to talk about our friends at so rare, NFTs are going mainstream. It's happening this cycle. It's happening now.
00:00:57.342 - 00:01:26.098, Speaker A: So rare is a way to collect, trade and do fantasy sports with soccer, your favorite soccer players. Europeans will call this football. Of course. What's super cool from a tech side is this is NFTs on ZK roll ups. So they got the tech figured out. It is fast and seamless and there's utility along with these cards so you can play with them in a fantasy sports type arena. Bankless wants you to play global fantasy football.
00:01:26.098 - 00:01:29.014, Speaker A: That is the message here for those.
00:01:29.052 - 00:01:48.186, Speaker B: That are into the world of fantasy sports. Fantasy sports has now arrived on Ethereum. I was actually just last weekend playing with, hanging out with my friends while they were doing their fantasy football draft. So I kind of expect that to also follow along right after this. Fantasy football is here and it's on ZK roll up on Ethereum.
00:01:48.218 - 00:01:59.442, Speaker A: So check it out. Yeah, absolutely, guys. All right. Collect and play. There will be a link in the show notes, or you could go to Sorae.com. That's Sorare.com. And check that out.
00:01:59.442 - 00:02:16.966, Speaker A: David. Also, we got to talk about a conference. It's coming in 2022 next year in May in Florida. It's called permissionless. We are helping to throw the biggest DFI conference that's ever been had. I said conference. Maybe I should say party because I think it's going to be both.
00:02:16.966 - 00:02:50.286, Speaker A: And we are in the stages of planning that with our friends at blockworks. I wish I could tell you there were tickets available, but the first tranche is all sold out. That said, there will be new tranches that open every two weeks. So the first opportunity to get in on that is on the 15 September if you are a bankless premium member. So you are a member of our bankless newsletter. You get the premium podcasts, all that good stuff, then you got an additional 30% off discount that's available for you. I am psyched about this conference.
00:02:50.286 - 00:03:09.978, Speaker A: I wish people could get into it now, but as soon as we tweeted that out yesterday, it was like Insta sold out. But there will be lots of opportunities hopefully in the future. I forgot to mention this too, David. Every two weeks the price goes up on this thing. So it's like crypto. You got to get in now or you have to fomo in at a higher price later.
00:03:10.064 - 00:03:42.834, Speaker B: What do you think is going to go higher, faster ticket prices or ether? I don't know. I'm super looking forward to this. There hasn't really been a defi forward metaverse forward conference yet, and so we're teaming up with the people at blockworks to help coordinate this and get this done. Like you said, it's maybe a conference, but more of a party. I think in crypto they're kind of the same. It's pretty far out. It's May of 2022, so we got plenty of time before it actually happens.
00:03:42.834 - 00:03:56.738, Speaker B: But it's going to be a blast. Ryan might actually meet you for the first person. Wow. We might actually host podcasts alive on stage in person. That's kind of crazy to think about, but yeah, it's going to be an absolute blast.
00:03:56.834 - 00:04:04.042, Speaker A: Yeah, check that out, guys. We'll have more info in the weeks to come. All right, David, let's get to the markets, man. Bitcoin. What's bitcoin doing?
00:04:04.096 - 00:04:23.470, Speaker B: Yeah, bitcoin started the week at $48,000, fell down to the low, low price of $46,700, and then has zoomed up to $49,970 at the time of recording. It touched 50k earlier this week, but it has not been able to hold its head above water overall, up 2.3% on the week.
00:04:23.620 - 00:04:29.694, Speaker A: Nice to see us above 50k, even though it was brief. Let's talk about ETh. Wow, this looks like an ascent.
00:04:29.822 - 00:04:52.540, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. Ether started the week at $3,000, which was also the low of the week, and it has assumed all the way up to $3,840 currently at the. And that was the high just set, I think, last night, early this morning. We're currently at $3,810, up 16% on the week. It was absolutely ether's week this week.
00:04:53.150 - 00:04:58.810, Speaker A: What day did the Raul Paul podcast come out, David. I wonder if we could see that on the charts.
00:04:59.470 - 00:05:03.006, Speaker B: That was exactly on the 30th, which.
00:05:03.028 - 00:05:27.586, Speaker A: Is the interesting correlation is not causation. But also, I also wouldn't be surprised. That was a very bullish podcast we put out with Raul Paul. And I think it's set up to be one of our most downloaded ever. Talking a lot about ether. He talks about it as the greatest trade ever. And it's funny because we've been talking about ether fundamentals for like three years, right? A long time.
00:05:27.586 - 00:05:39.900, Speaker A: But now it's very clear to even smart macro people like Raoul Paul. So there you go. All right, what's the ratio doing, David? This is the ETH to bitcoin ratio. I've got the three month open.
00:05:40.510 - 00:06:09.790, Speaker B: As you can tell, the ratio has done phenomenally this week. It started the week at zero 66 and it touched zero 78. Five at the very top, and it's currently coming in at zero 76. So if we go to go to the year to date, we are almost breaking into new highs on the ether BTC ratio. There's been some murmurings on Twitter of what happens when ether breaks its all time highs before bitcoin does. That's kind of like the sentiment right now, David.
00:06:09.870 - 00:06:31.610, Speaker A: Speaking of sentiment, I saw Chris Berninski tweet. He said something to this effect. Bitcoin no longer has the stranglehold on crypto culture and in kind of the mainstream mind that has transitioned. And I think that's true. Nfts are incredibly bullish for ether. Now it's got this narrative. EIP 15, five, nine, burn.
00:06:31.610 - 00:06:40.060, Speaker A: Yeah. Hard not to agree with Raul Paul that this is going to be an absolutely crazy year. He called for year.
00:06:40.910 - 00:06:42.970, Speaker B: I also call for that. Okay.
00:06:43.040 - 00:06:59.662, Speaker A: David also calls for that. On the one hand, I wouldn't be surprised. Right? On the other hand, that's a lot of territory to move. But this is crypto, and we'll see how the fall goes. I feel like we've been in the crab season long enough. Feels like everything's primed for breakout.
00:06:59.806 - 00:07:30.218, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. And going back to the whole culture thing, I mean, it makes sense that a Turing complete platform that has generalizability offers more and more surface area for culture, because we can just do anything with it rather than whatever bitcoin culture is around, like sound money. It's just like one instantiation of culture. On Ethereum, you can have all cultures instantiated and then made economically viable. So there's communities, there's dows, there's nft, orgs. There's everything on Ethereum, and all of that is kind of coming to a head right now.
00:07:30.304 - 00:07:41.070, Speaker A: It just captures all these narratives, too, right? Like, even the narrative of the metaverse that's spinning up, we're going to talk about later. It has a key role to play. All right, well, let's get to some more metrics. We're still in markets.
00:07:42.130 - 00:07:46.658, Speaker B: Wow. I didn't notice that before. 96 billion locked in. D five. That's a new all time high.
00:07:46.744 - 00:07:52.690, Speaker A: New all time high. Wow. We didn't look at this going in. We're almost at 100 billion.
00:07:53.270 - 00:08:00.310, Speaker B: Almost. Wow. I can't believe I missed that. Can you zoom out today? Schedule your tweet for tomorrow.
00:08:01.690 - 00:08:02.870, Speaker A: Wow, look at this.
00:08:02.940 - 00:08:05.090, Speaker B: That is great. That's fantastic.
00:08:05.170 - 00:08:40.190, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, so, for people who can't see, this is basically kind of a straight ascent up from October 2020 or so. Actually, I could go back before that, from DFI summer all the way up to here. We had, I guess, a dip from May until now. And then we're out of that dip, and we are on our way to new all time highs with total locked value in Defi. Let's talk about this dpi to Eth ratio. So is it Eth season? Is it d five season? It ain't d five season, Dave.
00:08:40.270 - 00:08:59.942, Speaker B: Well, not comparatively to ETH season. DFI tokens had a fantastic week this week. It's just that ether absolutely crushed everything. And so the DPI is coming in at zero, which is meaningfully below my bottom call of zero. But I would like to say on dollar terms, it's doing great.
00:09:00.076 - 00:09:19.386, Speaker A: He's just hanging to everything he can. There's like this tiny life raft that he's clinging to at this point. You know, David's still smiling, though. He doesn't care because he's got his. So, you know, if it goes that way, it's fine, too, for time. But let's talk about the bed index. So this is a combination of one third bitcoin, one third eth, one third DFI.
00:09:19.386 - 00:09:27.054, Speaker A: When crypto is doing well, how does it not also go up? And, of course, that's what it did on the weekly. Where did we start and where did we end?
00:09:27.092 - 00:09:56.060, Speaker B: Yeah, we started at $143 and are currently clocking at $164 for one bed index. We maxed out the week at $169. Nice. And again, bed index never gone down in the entire. Can you zoom out to the three months it is up, only it has never, ever gone down. It is absolutely incredible. So, yeah, the bed index literally proving exactly what I say every single week, the best crypto index of all time.
00:09:56.590 - 00:10:18.162, Speaker A: Excellent way to get crypto exposure. Hey, let's talk about l two beat, because new L2s are launching and we are at. I don't think this is quite an all time high. It's not, but it's a 90 day all time high on value inside of L2s. And I think this is all true L2s. Right? So it doesn't include side chains. But look at this new entrant to the mix here.
00:10:18.162 - 00:10:18.994, Speaker A: See that guy?
00:10:19.112 - 00:10:19.490, Speaker B: Wow.
00:10:19.560 - 00:10:20.530, Speaker A: Arbitrage.
00:10:20.950 - 00:10:45.610, Speaker B: Look at that 2700% increase. They're at $21 million. So it's like relatively new. But we're going to see very large percentage increases on both optimism and arbitrum over the next few weeks. And this is why we have started to get ahead of this narrative. But other l two s are also doing fantastically. Look at immutable X, up 27% on the week.
00:10:45.610 - 00:10:57.486, Speaker B: We got DyDX up 11% in value, locked on the week, almost breaching. $300 million locked. A Zk sync up 15% on the week. Aztec plus 21% on the week.
00:10:57.588 - 00:10:58.666, Speaker A: Looks so rare.
00:10:58.858 - 00:11:02.046, Speaker B: Up only so rare. Look at that.
00:11:02.068 - 00:11:04.474, Speaker A: Good for you guys. 11 million locked.
00:11:04.602 - 00:11:06.082, Speaker B: This is not a small number.
00:11:06.216 - 00:11:16.838, Speaker A: Yeah, this, of course is a ZK roll up as well. Really cool, man. I wonder if you can almost bet on what's going to go up, like sort of horse race style, how to.
00:11:16.844 - 00:11:18.198, Speaker B: Get synthetic assets on these things.
00:11:18.284 - 00:11:51.374, Speaker A: Well, I feel like. So arbitrum is definitely going to be in the top like three before long. It just launched, right? I'm pretty bullish on ZK sync. Not yet, but in the future when they roll out an EVM compatible ZK roll up, that's going to be really cool to see. So some great immutable x, dude, that could be a dark horse as well. As soon as they onboard some large NFT projects. And everyone loves nfts, but gas is too high on main net.
00:11:51.374 - 00:11:55.470, Speaker A: Immutable X is kind of solving that. So a lot of cool solutions being built out here.
00:11:55.540 - 00:12:05.246, Speaker B: Also new to L two B.com is that risk panel. So they've actually added in some ways to measure risks, which is pretty cool. Pretty nice gate patch.
00:12:05.438 - 00:12:23.366, Speaker A: Interesting. Very cool. Spend more time looking at that. Okay, let's talk about ETH issuance. David, this is in the context of ultrasound money. This is the effect of EIP 15 five nine. I saw coin metrics put out this chart and it shows you very visually.
00:12:23.366 - 00:13:03.554, Speaker A: Tell me at what point EIP 15 five nine gets deployed, right this point where you see ETH issuance steady, it's above 4%, 4.1%, EIP 15, five nine hits and bam, down. Annual issuance down to 3%, down another leg, annual issuance down to like 1.5%, down to 1%. Annual issuance for ether on its proof of work chain was below bitcoin for a period of time. And this is the thing to remember as NFT mania continues. Basically that means it's block space demand mania for Ethereum.
00:13:03.554 - 00:13:28.378, Speaker A: And what that means is ETH issuance goes down. So no doubt in my mind that we will be in the ultrasound money territory post merge, perhaps well under it. I mean, what would we be looking at? Like negative two, annual issuance, negative three, annual issuance, something to that effect. But it's absolutely crazy how quickly ETH gets burnt when block space demand goes off the charts.
00:13:28.474 - 00:14:00.810, Speaker B: Yeah, and this is just the symbiosis between all native economies on Ethereum and ether the asset, this is dependent on actual economic activity, right? So if the NFT mania actually cools off, then this would rise back up. But it's only been heating up. And it's also just one sector of Ethereum. And so regardless of the merge, which you didn't yet mention the triple happening, which is still on the menu, there's just more and more generalized economic activity coming to Ethereum, consuming block space.
00:14:00.960 - 00:14:12.982, Speaker A: Absolutely. Let's talk more about EIP 15 five nine, because now we're a month in or so, just about a month in, and we've got some actual visuals, some metrics on this. What are we looking at here, David?
00:14:13.046 - 00:14:46.982, Speaker B: Yeah, so this first graph is kind of a model for what you would expect for the gas markets and EIP 1559. So those are, those are two different things. There's the markets for actual block space demand, and then there's the EIP 1559 mechanism. And there's this predicted overshooting. Because the gas markets, EIP 1559 is a lagging mechanism. It reacts to the environment around it, it reacts to the gas markets. When an NFT drop comes, everyone apes in and the base fee goes up and up and up because everyone consumes all of the block space.
00:14:46.982 - 00:15:25.874, Speaker B: And so base fee rises 12.5% per block if the block space is maxed out. And so EIP 1559 responds to the over demand, over consumption of block space by increasing. But first, there's this overshoot of the base fee is too low and the tips come in, and that's what raises the block space and then we actually saw that this model, we actually saw this model actually live in real time with the next picture in this thread, which you can actually see it exists. So first we have this first hump right here with this gray tip amount. You also have the purple line, which is the moving average. So they're basically the same thing.
00:15:25.874 - 00:16:01.418, Speaker B: And then that overshoots. And that tells Ethereum, that tells EIP 1559, like, hey, you need to react to this. And then we see EIP 1559 take effect. The base fee goes up, and then it responds by reducing the tip amount. And then over time, this also settles out as the NFT drop ends. So the takeaway is that you are seeing EIP 1559 allow Ethereum to respond to the environment that it finds itself in. And this is what it takes to have an antifragile, maximally adaptive protocol, rather than something that's rigid and can't react.
00:16:01.418 - 00:16:14.834, Speaker B: Ethereum has this EIP 1559 mechanism that reacts to the world around it and allows it to maintain stable equilibrium. And this is what it means to have a monetary system operated by algorithms, operated by code.
00:16:15.032 - 00:16:50.062, Speaker A: It kind of reminds me of buildings they build in areas of the world that are earthquake prone, where they build a little bit more sway built into them. So there's an earthquake, the building can sway and doesn't immediately fall apart. That's what's happening. Ethereum is just vibing. What does this mean for the average eth user? So if an Eth user sees gas price spike, this generally means that just wait a little bit and they'll come down faster than in a pre EIP 15 five nine world. Is that the correct interpretation? Yeah.
00:16:50.116 - 00:17:14.946, Speaker B: I would also add that this Ethereum mechanism that's reacting to the markets means that the users have to react less, as in this nebulous thing that we call Ethereum is doing its own internal computation, and that means the brains of humans have to do less computation, because Ethereum did the thinking for it. So this is Ethereum working for us. Technology is a bicycle for the don't.
00:17:14.978 - 00:17:58.898, Speaker A: Look, I don't want to get too weird on this, but here's the other thing I think this means is there is this weird notion in bitcoin that Santoshi created the perfect mechanism, and it was fully baked at the beginning. There was no possible improvement to the underlying mechanism. Right. It just seems empirically false. This is not a huge tweak to Ethereum, but it is a slight mechanism change, and it's massively improved the system. I think some iteration on our mechanism designs is hugely important. This is technology in addition to money, and technology can improve and it can change and can get better.
00:17:58.898 - 00:18:11.290, Speaker A: The importance of being able to upgrade and change things when they make sense. Let's talk about some of these metrics coming out of block native. David, what are we seeing from EIP 15? Five, nine? What is block native showing us here?
00:18:11.360 - 00:18:41.922, Speaker B: Yeah, this is just the story of EIP 1559 adoption. You can see the differing transaction types, type one and type zero, which is like EIP 1559 enabled versus not enabled. There was a big jump in the middle of these graphs right here. I can't remember what wallet provider just started implementing EIP 1559, but we are now well over 50% of EIP 1559 type of transactions. And again, we're just going to watch this approach 100% over time.
00:18:42.056 - 00:18:56.598, Speaker A: There we go. All right, let's talk about OpeNC. They've just had a killer get that bar month. Absolutely killer month. 3 billion trading volume in August. 3 billion in August. And it's just a straight line up.
00:18:56.598 - 00:19:01.294, Speaker A: This just shows how quickly things can happen in crypto in July.
00:19:01.362 - 00:19:06.026, Speaker B: That looks like there was roughly like 300 million. Yeah, but we did a ten x.
00:19:06.128 - 00:19:15.406, Speaker A: Nice ten x on the month there. Congrats to openc on that. And nfts, of course, are just popping off. So that explains a huge chunk of why that's happening.
00:19:15.508 - 00:19:21.680, Speaker B: Congrats to all the investors that invested in Openseas. Raise literally like two months ago.
00:19:22.210 - 00:19:46.518, Speaker A: Exactly. This is just such a crypto thing to happen. Talk me through this tweet. This is one from our friend Richard Chen, who always digs into the analytics, the on chain analytics behind these chains. We did an episode with him where he's talking about his approach to Dune analytics. Looks like he's got some analytics based on crosschain bridging. What's going on here?
00:19:46.604 - 00:20:47.098, Speaker B: I believe maybe it was last week or the week before, but one of my takes was that the whole phrase of cross chain is going to move from layer ones to layer one, cross chains like bitcoin to Ethereum or Ethereum to Tezos, and instead crosschain is going to start to increasingly mean cross L2s. And I think this is evidence of that. Richard Chen says hop protocol, which is a protocol that lets you hop from L2 to L2 and then also back to ethereum, he says is doing the same amount of volume as thorchain, which is a layer one to layer one, like swap protocol, liquidity protocol, doing the same amount of volume of Thor chain before Thorchain got hacked, which was another point I made, is cross chains are really complicated and really dangerous, whereas L2 to L2s all operate on the EVM, all use the same standards and are much safer. And so this is exactly proving exactly what I was talking about. Layer twos to L2 hopping is going to be 100 times easier, 100 times more safe, and is ultimately going to become whatever it means to say, cross chain. Cross chain is now l two to l two.
00:20:47.264 - 00:21:34.054, Speaker A: I think we got to finish the rest of this tweet, too, because this is important. He said that about hop protocols doing the same amount of volume as Thor chain before the hack. And then he says, no token, there's no army of shills, just a missionary team heads down, focused on building shot across the bow to Thor chain. I don't know what thorchain is doing now in terms of market cap. I saw at one point in time like 6 billion or so. David, you could probably look that up, but it's kind of the difference between, I think, actually building and seeing the numbers on chain and investing in that versus investing in a potential narrative. And you can make money both ways in crypto, right? From a fundamentals perspective or from a narrative perspective.
00:21:34.054 - 00:21:48.330, Speaker A: And yes, these two things also blend. But when in doubt, man, always buy fundamentals, always invest in the on chain data. That's at least how I think we approach things at bankless. Yeah. So what was Thorchain's market cap, David?
00:21:48.410 - 00:21:50.910, Speaker B: Currently coming in at 2.7 billion.
00:21:51.410 - 00:22:09.618, Speaker A: 2.7 billion. Really interesting to see how that evolves. Of course, connects is also doing some big things here. This is another hop type protocol. This is another bridge between different L2s. And this is an arbitram to polygon in 70 seconds transaction.
00:22:09.618 - 00:22:20.010, Speaker A: The tweet says, you aren't excited enough. I do feel like that's true. I don't think the entire crypto space realizes how good bridging is going to be between these L2s before long.
00:22:20.160 - 00:22:24.250, Speaker B: The bridges are already being finished before people have even migrated onto layer.
00:22:26.190 - 00:22:49.700, Speaker A: Absolutely. All right, well, let's talk about this, David. Maybe we'll end markets with spot volume up and what that means. So apparently, August, if you look at centralized exchanges, the spot exchange volume broke $1 trillion. Okay. And this is the first time it's done so since May. So if you look at the numbers here, this is kind of what the chart looks like.
00:22:49.700 - 00:23:20.054, Speaker A: This is the story. If we're to sum up the entire market section. It feels very much to me like we've gotten through crab season. We're at the end of the summer and bullish fall. That's what this is looking at. Thanksgiving is going to be one of those thanksgivings where you might be sitting around with your family and everyone's asking you about crypto. And I don't know what they'll be asking you, but be asking about nfts or ether or tokens or bitcoin or what, but it feels like it's going to be one of those thanksgivings.
00:23:20.054 - 00:23:20.790, Speaker A: David.
00:23:20.950 - 00:23:41.058, Speaker B: That's exactly right. And we'll talk about this later in the roll up. But the cool thing about the last few months of Ethereum and of Defi and of crypto is that the things that we've created lately, while they're all kind of crazy, like we're selling jpegs for millions of dollars, jpegs are still easier to understand than uniswap. Right. And so some of these conversations are going to be easier to have.
00:23:41.224 - 00:23:45.074, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. You can show people. Absolutely.
00:23:45.192 - 00:23:47.166, Speaker B: All right, guys, we're going to show them your penguins.
00:23:47.278 - 00:24:00.458, Speaker A: Show them your penguins why that's worth hundreds of thousands of dollars and try to explain that. We should do an article on that, David. All right, we are going to be back with releases, but before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:24:00.544 - 00:24:36.034, Speaker B: Bankless is proud to be supported by Uniswap. Uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure. Instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans, Uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on Ethereum, which is what Ryan and I call a money robot. No human counterparties or centralized intermediaries, just autonomous code on ethereum. Input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy. Something brand new in the Uniswap ecosystem is the Uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants. We have been saying this for a while, and we'll say it again.
00:24:36.034 - 00:25:04.062, Speaker B: Daos have money and they are in need of labor. If you think that you have something to contribute to the Uniswap Dow, apply for a grant to Uniswap. Just look at the size of the Uniswap treasury. It's almost $3 billion. This mountain of capital is looking for labor. Do you have something of value to contribute to the Uniswap Dow? No matter how big or small your idea is, you can apply for a Uni grant@unigrants.org and help steer Uniswap in the direction that you think it should go.
00:25:04.062 - 00:25:44.838, Speaker B: That's exactly what we did to get Uniswap to be a sponsor for bankless, and you can do the same for your project. Thank you Uniswap for sponsoring bankless. Balancer is a powerful platform for flexible, automated market makers. Typical amms just have two tokens inside of one liquidity pool, which can lead to fractured liquidity across the many pairs. In defi with balancer, you can access the full power of multiple tokens inside of one single amm, which unlocks an entirely new playing field of possibility. This makes balancer an awesome building block for so many different use cases. Balancer pools can make asset indices, but instead of paying fees to portfolio managers, balancer lets you collect the fees from traders who use your portfolio for liquidity.
00:25:44.838 - 00:26:40.634, Speaker B: Additionally, balancer smart pools can be programmed to have properties that change according to predetermined rules, such as changing the swap fee based on market conditions or even liquidity bootstrapping pools, which can help you launch and distribute your token with day one liquidity. At bankless, we use a liquidity bootstrapping pool to sell our bap t shirts to much success. Balancer V two brings powerful new features that makes your money work even harder for you. In v two, idle tokens are capable of generating yield in DFI without sacrificing liquidity in the pool using Balancer's asset managers, Balancer's vault architecture lets you trade between balancer pools at a fraction of the cost versus trading on other platforms. Balancer's mission is to become the primary source of liquidity in defi by providing the most flexible and powerful platform for asset management and decentralized exchange. Dive into the balancer pools at app Balancer fi all right, guys, we are.
00:26:40.672 - 00:26:51.902, Speaker A: Back with the releases. David, we gotta start here. Another L2 has shipped. We talked about it before. Now it's actually happening. The tape is being cut. The theme park is open.
00:26:51.902 - 00:26:56.190, Speaker A: Arbitrum is ready for business. What does this mean? Oh, God.
00:26:56.260 - 00:27:23.446, Speaker B: It means that one of the ethereum's most hyped scaling solutions is we can go into the theme park and go on all the rides. Not only is the theme park open, but the rides are also open. That's what's been going on for the past, like two months or so, is that all these dev teams have been building their rides. The rides have been under construction. Now most of them are finished. And so now we can go play in this new theme park that's called Arbitrum. And so the list of things that are already ready for you to go ride on, is pretty insane.
00:27:23.558 - 00:27:53.598, Speaker A: We're going to go through some of that list. But, David, I haven't had an opportunity to actually use arbitram. So we're recording this on Thursday just because this has been such a crazy week. But I intend to. My understanding is one of the big, of course, reasons to migrate to arbitrum is lower gas fees. So it's not eliminating gas fees completely, of course, because you're still ultimately securing things from main net. But if you look at Arbitrum versus mainet, here's one comparison.
00:27:53.598 - 00:28:41.582, Speaker A: The cost to send eth, one dollars on arbitrum right now, gas prices being what they are, about $11 or $12 to send ether from one address to another. The cost to use a uniswap, $5 on arbitrum, where on mainet, costs about 80. And this is all with, like, the governor's on. So arbitram still hasn't let everything through. They're throttling transaction throughput, and they are deploying this in a cautious way. So I anticipate these gas fees could go down over time, too. Of course, it's partially depending on what mainet does, but not that bad, right? Like, when we talked to arbitram, they were anticipating, like, 90% to 95% reduction in gas fees for typical transactions.
00:28:41.582 - 00:28:52.470, Speaker A: And that's kind of what we're seeing right now, which is good. I know one concern I've heard people have is, hey, there's not liquidity yet. I'm also like, look, we're on day one.
00:28:52.620 - 00:28:54.934, Speaker B: There's not liquidity. We have to put our money there first.
00:28:54.972 - 00:29:03.420, Speaker A: There was like $2 million in liquidity, and I think I've heard some complaints. I was like, hey, the theme park is great, but we don't have the liquidity yet.
00:29:04.030 - 00:29:10.154, Speaker B: When the water park turns on, you got to wait for the water to flow all the way down the slide before you can slide on it.
00:29:10.272 - 00:29:27.410, Speaker A: That's what's happening. And now we're already at 40 million. And we saw that on L2 scan. So by the time you guys listen to this, I don't know, it could be 60, could be 80 million. It's going to take some time for the water to get down the slide, but, yeah. You're so good at here, man. Bro, I just copy you, David.
00:29:27.410 - 00:29:42.430, Speaker A: Layer two is here. This is what we've been waiting for. This is different than optimism in that everything is kind of generally available out of the gate. They're not deploying things an application at a time. Yeah. What's your take here, David?
00:29:42.510 - 00:30:17.810, Speaker B: Oh, it's kind of going to be a wait and see type of thing. The cool thing about L2 is we can take all of our DFI stuff and put it on the ll two and then yay, we save on gas fees. The cool thing that I think is really exciting is like, well, there's also dFI things that couldn't happen on layer one, that can only happen on L2s. And that's going to be like this big zero to one moment. As soon as we figure out what those things are, you can't really ever predict them, but that's kind of what I'm really excited about. And just overall, there's going to be a great migration to the arbitram L2, which I'm pretty sure is what I say in this sponsor.
00:30:18.230 - 00:30:39.794, Speaker A: Well, guys, stay tuned for Tuesday. We're going to have Arbitrum back on the podcast doing a show with them to review their progress since the last time we talked to them. But maybe let's just scan a few things that have been deployed. So there's a block explorer by the people who made ether scan. It's called Arbiscan and that is up and ready. So we love Etherscan.
00:30:39.842 - 00:30:41.150, Speaker B: Looks and feels like Etherscan.
00:30:41.250 - 00:31:02.878, Speaker A: How many times a day do I use this thing? And now it's deployed on Arbitrum. Also, our friends at balancer, they have expanded to L2. They are on Arbitrum live now. Sushi is on Arbitrum and they've got rewards. Realize this. So they're already doing yield farming on Arbitrum. Definitely something to check out.
00:31:02.878 - 00:31:18.920, Speaker A: Uniswap also deployed on Arbitrum. So this is the first L2 where we've seen both of those solutions, both sushi swap and Uniswap. So they get to battle it out in a new realm. I'm kind of excited about that, honestly. Look at all this.
00:31:20.490 - 00:31:33.978, Speaker B: All of them, everything. Hey, shout out to tracer, curve, dodo, DX Ave, future swap, mc decks, Makerdao, perpetual protocol, d force, whatever we piggy is so much. It's on Arbitrum. Love you.
00:31:33.984 - 00:31:56.490, Speaker A: We piggy. Yeah. Tracer, gnosis safe. Some of these are cool because they're actually new apps that haven't been deployed on Mainnet, too. So anyway, lots to go check out. We are going to be releasing a guide next week to Arbitrum next Thursday. So if you've read some of our previous guides, like we did a guide to Polygon, doing a whole comprehensive guide for arbitram.
00:31:56.490 - 00:32:04.306, Speaker A: So stay tuned to the newsletter to check that out. That's newsletter banklesshq.com. If you are not signed up, go do that now. Yeah.
00:32:04.328 - 00:32:12.918, Speaker B: And shout out to Ben, literally the best guide writer in all of Defi. We got him. Great find. Got him on the team. And now he's going to be re releasing an optimism guide as well.
00:32:13.004 - 00:32:15.526, Speaker A: Yeah, we just need him to quit college and work for us.
00:32:15.708 - 00:32:17.160, Speaker B: Just quit college, bro.
00:32:17.770 - 00:32:21.778, Speaker A: It worked for there.
00:32:21.804 - 00:32:23.130, Speaker B: That's what you say to your parents.
00:32:25.870 - 00:32:57.362, Speaker A: All right, man. The other point I want to make is there's just a thread from Anthony Sasano that goes through all of the other L2 solutions that are coming to Mainnet. So he goes through Starkware, he goes through ZK sync. That's coming optimism. That's coming arbitram. If you want a collection of all of the L2s, we will include this link in the show note notes and you can go check that out because it still is L2 summer. I know we're almost out of summer, so it's like L2 summer fall edition is what I think is happening in the next few months.
00:32:57.362 - 00:33:08.290, Speaker A: This is definitely going to pick up some more. David, should we talk about this? This is interesting. Why don't you explain what's going on with Vincent van Doe and three arrows capital?
00:33:08.370 - 00:33:51.030, Speaker B: All right, so three arrows capital famously kind of was one of the big reasons why this NFT mania got so much steam, picked up so much steam so quickly. They aped into a bunch of crypto punks of Fidenza, some ringers, and now they look like they are just doubling down on nfts as investments. And so they have brought on whoever Vincent van Doe is on Twitter saying, excited to be working with Suzu and Kyle Davies from three arrows capital to launch starry night Capital, an NFT fund. I love the name. And he says, our thesis is simple. We believe the best way to gain exposure to the cultural paradigm shift being ushered in by NFTs is owning the top pieces from the most desired sets. So that's pretty cool, investing in culture.
00:33:51.030 - 00:33:59.330, Speaker B: And I think that's just a fantastic option to. The fact that you can even invest in culture is fantastic.
00:33:59.490 - 00:34:29.060, Speaker A: And David, you said whoever Vincent van Doe is, and that's because he's pseudo anonymous, not because he's unknown on Twitter. He is a big deal in NFT circles, as far as I understand it, like one of the top collectors in the space, able to identify these things early. So this is the kind of talent acquisition for three arrows capital, too. They've got the capital. They need the talent through which to deploy it, and they're matching those things together. Really cool to see an NFT focused fund. That's what this is.
00:34:29.590 - 00:34:33.780, Speaker B: And if you read my digital culture revolution, you might have seen this coming.
00:34:34.950 - 00:34:36.606, Speaker A: You got to hit the buy button, though, David.
00:34:36.638 - 00:34:38.680, Speaker B: That's the hard part. I forgot that part.
00:34:40.090 - 00:35:11.498, Speaker A: All right, merit circle, this is interesting. This is a fork of optimism. So optimistic rollups we've talked about so much. Optimism is a solution similar to arbitram on optimistic rollups. Merit is apparently forking their code, tweaking it in some ways doing sort of their own thing. I don't know all of the details, but I'm just kind of of the mindset, like, let 1000 roll ups bloom and we'll see which ones win. Very excited that this is our scalability path for DFI and Ethereum.
00:35:11.498 - 00:35:13.054, Speaker A: I don't know, David, if you have.
00:35:13.092 - 00:35:24.146, Speaker B: Anything to add, there's not going to be a few roll ups or a few l two s. There's going to be infinity numbers of them. And so this is just one more.
00:35:24.328 - 00:35:33.622, Speaker A: Absolutely. Pleaser Dow. What's pleaser Dow doing? And maybe give some folks some context for what pleaser dow even is. Yeah.
00:35:33.676 - 00:36:10.350, Speaker B: Pleaser Dow is a Dow that got spun up in just a hasty fashion in order to purchase people pleasers. Famous x times y equals k. Uniswap v three nft that got launched at the same time as uniswap v three debuted. And just a bunch of friends all pooled their money so they could buy this NFT. And then the Dow kind of took that and ran with that. And so there's a bunch of more Internet culture nfts that Pleaserdao has purchased. One of them was the original doge, the shibu Inu doge meme, the actual picture from the actual owner of the doge who actually took the photo.
00:36:10.350 - 00:36:11.282, Speaker B: It's that one right there.
00:36:11.336 - 00:36:12.350, Speaker A: This is the original.
00:36:12.430 - 00:36:31.480, Speaker B: And so the artist. Artist, the owner of the doge, who is at Suko Sato, apparently she only speaks Japanese, but the Dow is actually in contact with her. She minted the photo as an NFT, and pleaser Dow bought it, I think, for $5.5 million. 169.696,969 eTh. Nice.
00:36:31.480 - 00:37:07.042, Speaker B: And now this is on the balance sheet. Now what pleaser Dow is doing is they're using Andy 800:52s fractional platform, which we did an AMA on. If you want to learn more about that. They are putting the doge NFT into fractional and fractionalizing 20% of it. They are trying to do more in the future, but they're starting off with 20% into 16,000,000,009 69696 units. There's a bunch of memes going on here. This sale is actually ending right now.
00:37:07.042 - 00:37:35.600, Speaker B: And then all of a sudden, the dog Erc 20 token is going to be a token on Ethereum, and it's going to represent a fractional share of the doge NFT. And I would just like to shield my own bags here and say that doge, the blockchain that the doge currency is clocking in at $38 billion, and the dog token, which is the actual NFT, the actual meme itself, only clocking in at roughly six to 10 million, there's a discrepancy there.
00:37:36.610 - 00:38:13.898, Speaker A: Okay, so let me get this straight. What's happened is there was a Dow that was created to purchase cultural artifacts called Pleaser Dow. They purchased one of the biggest cultural artifacts, which is the dogecoin dog, the picture from the artist, the actual, original, most legitimate one. Now they are fractionalizing that thing and releasing it as an ERC 20 token that people can buy. So I think it's being auctioned off, but people can also buy this token. And the meme is this token now could compete against the original dogecoin meme, which is dogecoin the blockchain plus the currency. That's what you're saying.
00:38:14.064 - 00:38:18.070, Speaker B: I mean, they wouldn't say compete. That's my interpretation.
00:38:18.150 - 00:38:19.094, Speaker A: Memetic competition.
00:38:19.142 - 00:38:43.086, Speaker B: It's a little bit of memetic competition, but also we did a live stream with Andy and Jamis from Pleaserdao, and they talked about how well this can become a community operated organization. This can become like a dao that's centered around the doge meme now that the doge NFT is in the hands of the people. So there actually could be collaboration between the doge blockchain and the dog token holders on Ethereum.
00:38:43.198 - 00:38:56.102, Speaker A: It's so weird, the numbers, the value we're talking about. If aliens unearth civilization years from now, after humanity destroys itself, they will have thought we worship dogs during the Internet culture of time.
00:38:56.156 - 00:39:00.342, Speaker B: Hey, maybe they would understand. Maybe they have their own pet aliens that they worship.
00:39:00.486 - 00:39:01.130, Speaker A: Maybe.
00:39:01.280 - 00:39:15.566, Speaker B: I think the potential for this is actually pretty crazy. So there's badger dow on Ethereum, which is BTC infrastructure. I think there could be, like, dog dao for doge infrastructure. And we all know that Elon Musk would absolutely join that dao. That's for sure.
00:39:15.668 - 00:39:35.378, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. It's getting some press, too. This is pleaserdao Emily Yang on Bloomberg TV talking about this. So very cool. Hey, let's burn through these other releases. Block native just released a gas estimator for your browser, so it's a great browser extension. Now you can just click a button and see how much you should be paying.
00:39:35.378 - 00:39:42.274, Speaker A: This is all EIP 15 five nine. Ready? So great way to estimate not overpay on your blocks.
00:39:42.322 - 00:39:59.020, Speaker B: And that's meaningfully different from all the other gas estimators that you might already have installed. Because the current gas estimators, they only look at recent transaction history. Block native goes very deep into the mem pool, into the mempool. So it has a lot more insights and a lot more clarity to give you better information.
00:39:59.790 - 00:40:11.166, Speaker A: Let's talk about this too. We probably don't have time to cover it. Maybe it's a podcast in the future, but a new NFT derivative from the brilliant minds at paradigm. What is this derivative? What's the TLDR? Right?
00:40:11.188 - 00:40:33.382, Speaker B: So any NFT project that has a decent amount of liquidity, which then establishes a floor price paradigm, has established floor perpetuals, which allows you to make a perpetual contract upon the floors of an NFT project. So this is now a synthetic asset for any NFT project. So, like synthetic penguin tokens, synthetic punks, synthetic cool cats, synthetic whatever.
00:40:33.436 - 00:40:53.226, Speaker A: Price is just like the absolute lowest price that on the open market, say a punk, has been listed, right? It's the very minimum layer. So what would you do with this kind of synthetic? Would this be a way to speculate, using an ERC 20 token on a given NFT market? Maybe create an index out of this eventually?
00:40:53.338 - 00:41:12.158, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. It's just financializing nfts, which is fantastically cool. Right below the floor is where you find liquidity, which is why these perpetuals are pointed at the floor. And it's just like, for people that don't care for a particular punk but are still bullish on punks, they can buy these floor perpetuals.
00:41:12.254 - 00:41:19.766, Speaker A: Sir. I wonder what a CFTC commissioner, what their take would be on something like this, an instrument like this.
00:41:19.868 - 00:41:40.822, Speaker B: Well, it's such a fantastic little coincidence that we actually interviewed a former CFTC commissioner coming out on the podcast on Monday, and we asked a question kind of like this, but I framed it a little bit differently. He's like, bruh, there are like 10,000 NFT projects and there's going to be 10,000 synthetic assets. Like, what's the CFTC going to do about that? His answer was pretty interesting.
00:41:40.976 - 00:41:48.800, Speaker A: Yeah. Stay tuned for that podcast. It's Brian Quintez. He's a former CFTC commissioner. He just resigned this week.
00:41:49.330 - 00:41:50.558, Speaker B: The day before we recorded.
00:41:50.644 - 00:42:10.038, Speaker A: The day before we recorded. So he kind of has some more freedom. License to speak. Anyway, hot episode coming up there. We missed this little raise, by the way, in all the talking about arbitram, they actually raised another 120,000,000 in funding. I think their valuation is like one point something, 1.2 billion, I want to say.
00:42:10.038 - 00:42:35.600, Speaker A: So they've got a war chest to keep building what they're building. But look at this, David. Like a big raise in crypto, TechCrunch. Our friends at TechCrunch, the Bloomberg of technology blogs, I don't know, but they had this crazy headline, off chain labs, those are the people behind arbitrum raises 120,000,000. Why? To fix Ethereum shortcomings, that's why.
00:42:38.290 - 00:42:51.758, Speaker B: Taking the perspective of somebody who's not in Ethereum, you can kind of see why, like a $70 uniswap trade, I guess that's a shortcoming. But again, it's more nuanced than that. Ethereum's decentralization is not a shortcoming.
00:42:51.854 - 00:42:52.430, Speaker A: Expensive.
00:42:52.510 - 00:42:54.398, Speaker B: And decentralization is expensive.
00:42:54.494 - 00:43:24.398, Speaker A: Yes. Yeah. The thing that we're building is a very slow computer that does one thing, which is it's trustless. It's decentralized. Like that is the entire point. It's just shocking to me that popular technology blogs, even like TechCrunch, still don't understand this, still don't get this. This is why we need crypto media publications to actually crypto natives talking about their own industry in a way that makes way more sense because TechCrunch is not getting it right.
00:43:24.398 - 00:43:28.366, Speaker A: Speaking of the crypto industry, though, jobs get a job.
00:43:28.468 - 00:43:30.766, Speaker B: If you're in crypto, a goddamn job.
00:43:30.868 - 00:43:49.590, Speaker A: Check out the bankless job boards. We have a senior front end web3 developer at Tracer Dow. You got to check that position out. There are a number of others. Make sure you look at that. You can also subscribe to the Bankless Jobs newsletter and get updates. We'll include a link in the show notes.
00:43:49.590 - 00:43:56.742, Speaker A: All right, David, should we get onto the news? Do you want to talk about the chain split first? Yeah, sure.
00:43:56.796 - 00:44:32.974, Speaker B: So there was, right after we recorded on last Thursday, there was Friday morning, there was a chain split to Ethereum. And what that means is there was a consensus failure, consensus bug, and then we had the chain go in two different directions. This didn't really cause too much of an issue at the time because most of Ethereum all went in the same direction. Some parts of the guest client, some parts of the guest client went in a different direction. People that hadn't updated their guest client found a different chain to go off of. And basically what happened was there was a bug in Geth in the code that handles the static call opcode. It was found in fixed in an update.
00:44:32.974 - 00:45:10.106, Speaker B: And that new update to Geth was deployed and all those nodes that updated didn't fork, but the ones that didn't update ran off with an unfortunate consensus failure. Like I said, and because of this very specific smart contract that was deployed, somebody actually exploited this. And all the non updated guest clients, because of this weird contract thing, went off in a different direction as soon as these clients downloaded the latest client, although they pointed back to the original Ethereum chain, and then we went on our merry way. But this is why Ethereum has multiple clients and also why you need to update your nodes.
00:45:10.298 - 00:45:45.370, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. I do think it was a bullet that was maybe narrowly dodged, I think so. This definitely could have been worse, but this had already been an exploit that was patched and so only affected older geth nodes, which is why we saw sort of a brief chain split and then everything kind of merged back and fixed. Yeah, so I think points well taken, David. Let's talk about this Coinbase L2. They are doing stuff on L2. This is a whole blog post about that telling the crypto community what they intend to do.
00:45:45.370 - 00:46:32.554, Speaker A: They said, we just announced support for Polygon Network for the Coinbase wallet and the Coinbase wallet extension, with plans to integrate polygon as our first scaling solution for Coinbase. But they are not stopping there. Their goal, they say, is to explore scaling initiatives with l two, such as optimism, arbitrum and starkware over time. That is music to my ears. David, we've been talking about the protocol sync thesis, which is those protocols that have the highest levels of decentralization, credible neutrality, the highest levels of legitimacy, as we've talked about before. Those will be at the bottom, form the bottom of all other settlement layers on top of them. And so this is essentially Coinbase doing that, recognizing that, executing that.
00:46:32.554 - 00:46:53.866, Speaker A: I think this is the protocol sync thesis coming true. Pretty soon they'll have deposits to all of these L2s, so there'll be a direct fiat bridge from a coinbase. And all the other exchanges will also do this directly to L2s. They will build products on top of these L2s. And I think this is very bullish for the future of bankless decentralized finance.
00:46:54.058 - 00:47:08.694, Speaker B: If I remember reading this blog post correctly, I think there was also a call to action from Coinbase asking for people who want to. They're looking to hire people. And so if you know about this stuff and you think you can help Coinbase, they are looking for your attention and for your help.
00:47:08.812 - 00:47:28.650, Speaker A: This is huge too. David, metamask, our favorite browser extension wallet, just surpassed 10 million monthly active users. 10 million monthly active users. Seems like we're just talking about the 1 million mark. That was maybe a few months ago. Maybe six months ago. Insane growth here.
00:47:28.800 - 00:47:51.266, Speaker B: It's got to be nfts too. What else would it be? If you want to buy on OpenC, you got to use metamask and you can also use wallet connect. But most people use metamask. So congrats to Metamask for being the most bankless browser wallet ever. Allowing so many people to actually take control of their own private keys, it's such an important concept, and metamask has made it easy. So they deserve all the success.
00:47:51.448 - 00:48:04.290, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. Huge growth story there. All right, let's get to some NFT stuff. We got to lead with this story. Twelve year old kid just made three hundred and fifty k. Three hundred and fifty thousand dollars in ETH. How? By selling nfts.
00:48:04.290 - 00:48:30.698, Speaker A: This was an article in CNBC that I saw last week, and I love this quote for him. They asked if he's going to sell and he said, no, I plan to keep all my ETH and not convert it to fiat money. I love that he said fiat money. People at CNBC are like fiat money. Do you mean like money? And he goes on to say, it might be early proof that maybe everyone doesn't need a bank. Just has an ETH wallet. Just has an ETH address and a wallet.
00:48:30.698 - 00:49:01.786, Speaker A: I said, the next generation is bankless. Look, this is a zoomer. Twelve years old, he's making his way, making his first economy using ETH as his bank account. You think he's ever opening an account at Wells Fargo? Not if he can help it. If he does, it's only to pay, like, stupid bills. This kid is sold for life. And I think this is how the Zoomer generation Gen Z is growing up, right? They are like eating and breathing this stuff.
00:49:01.786 - 00:49:18.574, Speaker A: Some of the innovators, like a twelve year old kid did this from his own home, was able to generate that kind of cash. He's telling all his friends this is propagating on CNBC, man, it's over. The world is going to be bankless. And starting with the next generation, this.
00:49:18.612 - 00:49:53.690, Speaker B: Also speaks to the power of actually using these things. We can talk about it and you guys can listen to podcasts and read articles, but it's meaningfully different when you actually have an Ethereum wallet and make your own transactions and actually use some of these infrastructures. That was when we had our podcast with Preston Pish about Ethereum versus bitcoin and I asked him if he had ever used uniswap and he's like, no, dude, I've never made like a transactional ethereum. Dude, what the hell? This twelve year old kid can get it. And the difference between Preston Pish and this twelve year old kid is that this twelve year old kid actually went and used Ethereum.
00:49:54.110 - 00:49:54.982, Speaker A: Just curiosity.
00:49:55.046 - 00:49:56.058, Speaker B: Just use this stuff.
00:49:56.144 - 00:50:13.226, Speaker A: We had a twelve year old kid. We also have in the bankless program our favorite bill Ford. He is 77 years old, he did say. And he's doing things with metamask. He's claiming tokens. He's doing d five, right? So that's a large span. So once again, twelve year old kid, 77 year old person.
00:50:13.348 - 00:50:17.246, Speaker B: What's running circles around everyone who hasn't touched Ethereum?
00:50:17.438 - 00:50:36.742, Speaker A: Exactly. All right, let's talk about this cryptopunks creator, larva Labs. They just signed up with a major talent agency. This agency is called UTA. I've not heard of them, but I'm not in the talent industry space. What did they do? Some kind of a business partnership? Vance Spencer explains it a little bit, David, but what's the summary here?
00:50:36.796 - 00:51:15.042, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm also unfamiliar with this territory, but I think it's more just about allowing all the products from larvae labs, cryptopunks, me bits, autoglyphs to be part of licensing agreements with commercial content licensing. So maybe we see just kids tv shows with a cryptopunk in it or cryptopunk toys. I don't know. I don't know how this works, but I think this is kind of what we're diving into. I still have open questions about what happens if somebody uses my crypto punk. Do I get royalty fees for that? Or like I feel like you should. Like I should.
00:51:15.042 - 00:51:21.494, Speaker B: I bought it. I bought the damn thing anyways. I'd still be happy to see my crypto punk on like Nickelodeon or something.
00:51:21.692 - 00:51:25.858, Speaker A: That'd be awesome because you are the only owner of that legitimate crypto punk.
00:51:25.874 - 00:51:28.598, Speaker B: So I get punk 1118, best crypto punk of all time.
00:51:28.684 - 00:51:35.178, Speaker A: Even if you don't get a share of this, then this also still kind of propagates the meme and benefits your.
00:51:35.184 - 00:51:36.122, Speaker B: Crypto at the very least.
00:51:36.176 - 00:51:58.942, Speaker A: Yeah, it's super interesting to see that play out. Let's talk about this board ape yacht club. They just sold 96 million of their mutant ape nfts in an hour. And so this is a massive raise in and of itself. We also have, like, major artists. This is the chain smokers. They just changed their profile picture on Twitter to a board ape.
00:51:58.942 - 00:52:02.398, Speaker A: What's up with board apes? Are they the new crypto punks?
00:52:02.494 - 00:52:11.350, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, they're the runner up, that's for sure. And this whole mutant crypto punks, if you can find some pictures of mutant crypto punks, that'd be great because they're really creative.
00:52:11.930 - 00:52:12.342, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:52:12.396 - 00:52:47.098, Speaker B: The bankless editor, Lucas put this, well, I really like, this is like somebody asked like, yo, what happened to the board apes? And Lucas said, oh, they leveled up. So this kind of feels like an evolution of the board apes. Like, first they were just like normal board apes and now they're mutant board apes. They had like a leveling up moment, an evolving moment. And so this kind of tells the story of a particular set of Ethereum objects is like they did something, they changed. The board ape meme has evolved with mutant apes. Mutant apes, I think, are actually way cooler than the originals.
00:52:47.194 - 00:53:26.666, Speaker A: Okay, but can I ask you a question? Right, so this is me just getting into nfTs, right. As you know, I've been on sort of like a mini quest over the last two weeks to just get up to speed on everything. Okay. Do you remember in the early days, there was this criticism of bitcoin, particularly from people outside of the space, that just said, hey, bitcoin is not valuable because you could just fork it, create a bitcoin diamond, create a bitcoin gold, create a litecoin, create a dogecoin, whatever. And it will never be valuable because it's so inflatable. You could just create these new chains in perpetuity. Right.
00:53:26.666 - 00:54:01.654, Speaker A: And so it's just going to inflate the value away. This was an early criticism of bitcoin. What about that criticism for nfts? Right? So if board ape yacht club has now turned board apes and created a whole new set of, I don't know how many there are, but say, 10,000 mutant apes, does that not dilute the value of the original board apes? And what's to stop somebody else from going and creating another set of like 10,000 board apes that are I don't know, robotic board apes or something like that. Does that not start to dilute things? What's your take there, David?
00:54:01.702 - 00:54:25.390, Speaker B: Yeah, there's a lot to unpack there, actually. For one, the mutant apes add to the richness of the story of the original board apes. I don't know if this is completely true, but if you had a board ape, that doesn't mean you actually got a mutant ape. You'd also have to buy it with everything, everybody else. So there was no original. Sometimes with bitcoin, when bitcoin would fork into bitcoin cash. Bitcoin owners also got the bitcoin cash.
00:54:25.390 - 00:55:01.290, Speaker B: Right, true. But bitcoiners also say every time that bitcoin forks, it's just an airdrop of free bitcoin, because you can sell that bitcoin for the original bitcoin, and that actually instantiates value back to the original bitcoin. But there's also a difference to talk about. Punks are kind of considered like the bitcoin of NFTs. Like the original, it was valueless for such a long time as the shelling point at OG. But the difference between bitcoin and crypto punks is that bitcoin has a massive security expenditure budget. And cryptopunks or any other NFT, they don't because they're tokens on Ethereum and they don't have consensus.
00:55:01.290 - 00:55:06.906, Speaker B: They're just items on Ethereum. And so that also kind of changes the conversation.
00:55:06.938 - 00:55:27.982, Speaker A: Well, that would make me think they're more easily inflated then. Right, because bitcoin at least has that moat where, hey, you're never going to achieve bitcoin's level of security if you're just kind of a fork or a new chain that's based on bitcoin code, whereas every NFT has equal amount of security. And it's all social consensus around these things.
00:55:28.136 - 00:55:32.470, Speaker B: Yeah, but I would say it's also social consensus around what is the most valid bitcoin chain.
00:55:32.890 - 00:55:36.086, Speaker A: So it's all just social consensus, and.
00:55:36.108 - 00:55:37.640, Speaker B: That'S why we have layer zero.
00:55:39.450 - 00:56:04.410, Speaker A: All right, well, turtles all the way down. David walked right into that one. Well, let's talk bitcoin stuff. What's El Salvador doing with bitcoin? That seems to be the story for the last couple of months, but something new happened. They just approved $150,000,000 trust fund to support bitcoin's ambitions. What is this? This is part of the original plan when El Salvador rolled this out, correct? Right.
00:56:04.420 - 00:56:27.880, Speaker B: So, yeah, this $150,000,000 trust fund is committed to buying bitcoin from el salvadorian citizens who want to swap bitcoins for dollars. El Salvador before this whole bitcoin thing, its national currency was the dollar, and now it's also bitcoin. So now they have two national currencies. And this trust fund allows people to swap between bitcoins and dollars for people that want dollars.
00:56:28.570 - 00:56:29.922, Speaker A: So that's what this is for.
00:56:29.996 - 00:56:38.170, Speaker B: It's basically a $150 million dollar fund that will eventually turn into only purchase bitcoin over time.
00:56:38.320 - 00:56:52.766, Speaker A: What do you make of all the protests that we're seeing? So we're starting to see these protests of El salvadorians who are anti bitcoin. Like, no bitcoin. They're holding up signs that say this in Spanish. What are they protesting? And what do you make of this? Right.
00:56:52.788 - 00:57:28.300, Speaker B: So this was one of the big criticisms of this whole move is that bitcoin is supposed to be freedom money. It allows people to opt out. But then a nation state imposed bitcoin upon its citizens. Granted, it went from having one choice of currency to a dollar to having two choices, but now businesses are forced to accept bitcoin. Now there's our legal precedent for opting out of that forced coercion into owning, into accepting bitcoin if you don't have the technology for it. But I think people are kind of just like, they don't really care and they just don't want bitcoin to be like a thing in their country. And they're expressing that.
00:57:29.550 - 00:57:59.622, Speaker A: It's really weird to see. It's kind of a juxtaposition I've not seen. So you'd see protests against bitcoin or cryptocurrency for energy reasons, energy consumption reasons. But this is a protest from some citizens to their government saying, like, we don't want this thing as legal tender, we don't want to use this thing as money. And you're forcing us to. And that is like new territory. I'm not sure what the specific concerns are, but that feels top down in a way that bitcoin has never really been.
00:57:59.622 - 00:58:15.114, Speaker A: It's always been this opt in, bottom up movement. And I almost wonder if this is like a backlash against kind of that approach. I don't know if it's a great look, to be honest. It's different than anything I've seen in crypto. Yeah.
00:58:15.152 - 00:58:17.770, Speaker B: That's why it's important to maximize choice.
00:58:18.590 - 00:58:42.706, Speaker A: Let's talk about this. Jack Dorsey is still doing a lot with bitcoin. Looks like Twitter is adding the ability to tip using bitcoin on Twitter. I don't know, man. This feels very like 2018 to me. Off the plot. If you're a bitcoiner, do you want to spend your bitcoin? We talked about that.
00:58:42.706 - 00:58:44.962, Speaker A: Probably not payments. Why not?
00:58:45.016 - 00:58:49.570, Speaker B: Remember payments? Payments using bitcoin, never stable coins.
00:58:51.770 - 00:58:52.886, Speaker A: Any takes here.
00:58:52.988 - 00:59:12.566, Speaker B: It's such like, bitcoin's innovating. We made tipping inside of Twitter. It's like, God damn it, do something cool. The bitcoin section and the weekly rollers are always famished. And I swear to God, we try and find bitcoin news every single time, and this is what we get. We get Twitter tipping with bitcoin. Goddamn.
00:59:12.678 - 00:59:17.994, Speaker A: That's all we have right now. It'll get better, though. Bitcoin's got the story ahead, David. Never fear.
00:59:18.042 - 00:59:19.150, Speaker B: Not convinced.
00:59:19.490 - 00:59:51.354, Speaker A: Okay, let's talk regulation. I don't know about the growth story behind tether. So the province of Ontario has actually prohibited tether. Look at this list of prohibited crypto assets. A list of one bullet point. It's interesting to me, though, that nation states, I guess this is a province in this case, are starting to squeeze tether, maybe try to squeeze it out of existence, and maybe we'll see more of this for tether in the future. Probably not a good sign now.
00:59:51.354 - 01:00:27.558, Speaker A: There are other more legitimate stablecoins out there, like USDC, that seem to be taking steps to say, hey, we're not like, look at the whole thing, is backed by treasuries. We have money in the bank account. We're super transparent. So I think that USDC and other stablecoins like it will probably win off of this move. David, do you have any takes on this? FTX acquired a crypto derivatives exchange, Ledger X. I think Ledger X has some CME blessing or some CFTC blessing, if I'm remembering correctly. Yes, they do.
01:00:27.558 - 01:00:32.390, Speaker A: What do you make of this acquisition from SBF of FTX?
01:00:32.970 - 01:00:37.560, Speaker B: I don't have too much of a take. I didn't even know what Ledger X was.
01:00:38.410 - 01:00:41.394, Speaker A: Kind of like a small crypto CME, basically.
01:00:41.532 - 01:00:44.140, Speaker B: Are us citizens are going to be allowed to use it?
01:00:44.510 - 01:00:57.840, Speaker A: Yeah, well, they are allowed to use it right now. It's kind of just like a mini CME futures for crypto, I believe. That's my understanding of it. I guess my take here is like, SBF is buying everything right now.
01:00:58.370 - 01:01:00.126, Speaker B: Not golden Sachs, though.
01:01:00.308 - 01:01:28.214, Speaker A: Not golden Sachs. Not yet. He's worked his way up to it. But people have heard me say this before. That doesn't make me super comfortable. I have this fear that what we might end up doing is just replace one set of bankers with a new set of bankers. And SBF is definitely know, like, nothing against.
01:01:28.332 - 01:01:28.658, Speaker B: He's.
01:01:28.674 - 01:01:52.106, Speaker A: He's a capitalist making capitalist plays. But I don't want to see that. I want to see a more decentralized money system. So we'll keep monitoring this kind of activity. Did you see this, David? Speaking of centralized exchanges, crypto dad, John Carlo, he was the former head of the chair of the CFTC. He had joined Blockfi's board of advisors, and he just quit. So he just kind of quit.
01:01:52.106 - 01:02:08.742, Speaker A: And we know Blockfi has been under increasing regulatory scrutiny for their interest products. So it's a little bit jarring to see somebody like Giancarlo quit their advisor board. It seemed like in a sudden way. Do you have any takes on this?
01:02:08.796 - 01:02:47.554, Speaker B: Yeah, it definitely feels like when Brian Brooks quit binance just months after becoming binance, us after becoming its CEO, people just don't want to be part of companies that have significant amounts of regulatory scrutiny. BlockFi is going through, like, a securities issue. The SEC deemed their lending products to be securities, and they are currently fighting that fight. Meanwhile, also, Blockfi was going through a raise. I don't know if the details of the fallout on that have come out, but it was a big question mark as to whether or not they would actually be able to pull funding as a result of after the SEC came and said that their products are securities. So that story is still on. Yeah.
01:02:47.592 - 01:02:57.410, Speaker A: Do you know if the SEC said know? My understanding is definitely New Jersey has raised some flags about it and maybe some other states. I don't know if the SEC has fully weighed in about it.
01:02:57.560 - 01:03:00.486, Speaker B: I'm pretty sure that's true, but maybe. Listen, I need to double check.
01:03:00.588 - 01:03:25.342, Speaker A: Well, I do know it does look like here in the story, lead investor, third point LLC, pulled out of their recent raise. So they were partway through. They're getting some investors pulled out. There's some regulatory risk that's being raised in organizations like Blockfi. I do think they have a legitimate product, and regulators need to give them a path towards legitimacy. I mean, it's not a defi product, but I don't.
01:03:25.476 - 01:03:26.014, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:03:26.132 - 01:03:33.534, Speaker A: Do we live in a financial prison or what? I mean, blockfi interest account. I can't. Can't open one. Can't understand the risks. We'll see how this turns out.
01:03:33.572 - 01:03:40.098, Speaker B: All right, to wrap up this week in the news, we have to talk about this whole loot phenomenon. Ryan, have you been following this whole loot thing?
01:03:40.264 - 01:03:41.326, Speaker A: I have loot, David.
01:03:41.358 - 01:04:01.100, Speaker B: All right, so there's this whole insane loot phenomenon that has gone on, and it's really, really important, I think, as a concept, we don't know if this particular loot thing is going to be the thing that it promises to be, but people have gotten really excited about it, and it's taken the NFT Twitter sphere defi people by absolute.
01:04:01.870 - 01:04:11.462, Speaker A: So can we explain what loot is first? Because what's so crazy is it's bizarre. It's just a list of text. Right, David?
01:04:11.606 - 01:04:14.300, Speaker B: Yeah. Maybe if you scroll down, you can find.
01:04:14.750 - 01:04:17.814, Speaker A: I'm going to go to Opensea. Just like open, type in.
01:04:17.952 - 01:04:34.706, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay, so we all know nfTs. They are jpegs. We're all trading jpegs. And so these new NFTs came out. And if you look on OpenSea, it's just a black square with eight lines of text on them. And if you're familiar with Diablo two, a lot of these items came out of Diablo two.
01:04:34.706 - 01:05:12.170, Speaker B: Short sword, ancient helm mesh, belt of reflection, divine slippers of brilliance, necklace of skill, silver ring. These are all, like, elute items you would find in an rpg game. And so what the hell is this JPeg doing with just a list of items? And it's important to differentiate what's actually going on here. When you buy these NFTs on Opensea or anywhere, you're not buying the JPEG. The JPEG is a reflection of the properties of the token. And so there are properties inside of these tokens that have eight items inside of a loot bag. And these eight items, when you purchase the bag, you get all of the items.
01:05:12.170 - 01:05:35.906, Speaker B: And so this has, like, flip flopped what an NFT is like. Previously, an NFT would be a JPEG, and it would tell you what it looks like. Now, we have these loot bags, which are just a token with properties inside of them that are associated with items, and that allows whoever wants to manifest these properties to choose how to manifest them visually.
01:05:36.018 - 01:05:36.294, Speaker A: Right.
01:05:36.332 - 01:06:19.346, Speaker B: And so we have this great graphic by the Twitter account Tan Davas, who says a typical NFT is a top down approach where the creator determines what it looks like and then the purchasers buy it. The NFT just looks like that. But on the loot approach, we have this bottom up approach where the people around the NFT can build the game, they can create the avatar, they can write the lore, write the novels, and it's all bestowed upon one token. And so this is a complete paradigm shift of what it means to have an NFT. And there's so much energy that went into this in the last week that, God, it was exhausting trying to keep up with it. Felt like defi summer.
01:06:19.458 - 01:07:01.534, Speaker A: Okay, so let me make sure I'm tracking so far. So this is kind of like if anyone's played an MMORPG, right? Like a diablo or a World of Warcraft or something like this. This is almost as if that entire items list, including all of its rarity, was like exported, right? And now it's being exported and put on chain in these nfts that individuals can buy. And each NFT might give you kind of like a certain set of items and armor and all of these things, but that's it. It's just like the bare bones export of this kind of scarce rarity system. And list of items. And there's how many? Like 7500 or so of these loot drops?
01:07:01.662 - 01:07:24.714, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there's 7500, but that's also just one component of it, right? There could be more. This is kind of like creating a community, creating a dow in the sense that all these people are participating, like, hey, I think we should do this next. Not only can you suggest it, but you can also just go and do it and you can append on whatever you add onto these base primitives, right?
01:07:24.752 - 01:07:36.894, Speaker A: So why are people going and doing it, though? I have two kind of questions for you on this. One is why are loots so valuable right? Now? A few days ago, these things were like, what did they start?
01:07:36.932 - 01:07:43.150, Speaker B: I mean, you could mint it for free. Minted them for free. Fair launch, right? Everyone likes fair launches.
01:07:43.490 - 01:08:06.760, Speaker A: When I first looked, these things were trading at like half an eth or something like that, or one eth. And I was probably later to the game, right? But now these things, the floor rate is like ten e. Twelve last time I checked. Right before we recorded 30, 40, 50 e. So, a, why are they valuable? And what do you do with these things?
01:08:07.450 - 01:08:54.934, Speaker B: Why are they valuable? People are speculating that these items become like the epicenter for the future metaverse, right? They are the first Nft tokens that don't impose what they actually look like upon their surrounding environment and they allow the metaverse to come around them. And this is what I wrote about in my article this week, which is very much a part of the story. And I think, Ryan, if you actually go to that article, we can actually look at illustrate what's actually kind of going on with this. And there's a few examples that we can talk about first off, definitely read the article. It's relatively long, but it's, in my opinion, a pretty good definition for how the metaverse is actually going to emerge. And if you scroll down, Ryan, to the loot section is going to be like most of the way through it, right? Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going.
01:08:55.052 - 01:08:55.574, Speaker A: Right here.
01:08:55.612 - 01:09:31.374, Speaker B: Okay, here's what the loot looks like on Opensea. But there are more specialized websites, like zeroxinventory app that actually illustrate the properties of these tokens better than opensea does. And so you can actually see the colors of the rarity of each of these tokens if you want to scroll down, Ryan, just a little bit more. And so think about this difference. We have opensea that just gives you eight lines of text and they're all white. But we have zerox app, which gives you the same eight lines of text. But it also illustrates the properties of the tokens to a significantly more degree.
01:09:31.374 - 01:10:10.410, Speaker B: It tells you the rarity of them. And so this is a different layer upon these same tokens that express those tokens differently. And right now, the difference between Openc and this website is just that. Now the text is colored according to the rarity of the object. But take that into. Keep going with that logic. Right? What happens when a website doesn't just tell you the text of the objects, but actually manifests the objects into a character's hand? Or what happens when you put on VR goggles and a token that you have in your VR wallet actually puts a heavy belt of rage on your character?
01:10:10.490 - 01:10:10.734, Speaker A: Right.
01:10:10.772 - 01:10:12.334, Speaker B: Like, this is where this is going.
01:10:12.452 - 01:10:54.138, Speaker A: Okay, so that would be insanely valuable. But now this kind of gets to the second part of my two part question, which is why are people actually building all of these universes and games on top of things? And what's the economic incentive for them to do that? Right? So if I'm building a massive multiplayer rpg of some sort, of course I have to create this scarce items engine internally, but that's because I'm building a game, and at the end of that game, I'm going to charge my customers for that, make money, and that's how the economic engine works. Why would somebody build on top of loot? Why not just create their own?
01:10:54.304 - 01:11:19.458, Speaker B: Right? So that's a really good question, and we're just going to have to watch this unfold. In order to answer that, some preliminary answers are that if you own a bunch of loot tokens, you kind of are incentivized to add on more rich parts of the universe. On top of the loot tokens to give the tokens utility. Since you own the tokens, you want them to have utility because that makes them more valuable. So there's that. There's also. You can build parts of the universe that you can charge for.
01:11:19.458 - 01:11:55.934, Speaker B: So this is why my article, I think I super recommend, if you want to dive deeper into this subject. And the point of the article is to illustrate how the metaverse will actually arrive. And the metaverse will arrive by a bunch of distinct, separate components becoming interoperable with each other. And so people who have all these loop bags have minted other things. And so now we also have ability scores that give you a character strength nine, dexterity seven, constitution 13. And then there's characters, which are actually literally illustrations of a character. Lucas of the editor, I think, accidentally took out that photo.
01:11:55.934 - 01:12:27.846, Speaker B: But there's also realms, and there's realms, which are parts of, literally maps, like generative maps, in the same way that art blocks are. Generative realms are also generative. And I wasn't able to put it in my article because this came out this morning, but now there's also gold. And so there's now a fungible part of this loot universe that is gold. And importantly, in order to mint gold, you had to give the creators 0.3 ether. And so they actually got paid for the creating that part of the metaverse, the gold part of the metaverse.
01:12:27.846 - 01:13:00.262, Speaker B: And so I think all of these are going to be stitched together like they're all kind of puzzle pieces. Money Legos. In the same way that DFI has money Legos. For all the applications, the legos of Ethereum, of NFTs, just create the metaverse around the loot. And this concept is why so many people have gotten so excited about it. Because by not imposing a visual cosmetic layer upon these tokens, it allows the people around these things to impose their perceptions as to what these tokens are. And that expressivity allows more things to be built.
01:13:00.396 - 01:13:53.426, Speaker A: It's like a writing prompt. Yes, the story is not written, but we've got this prompt. And I think you alluded to the economic incentive here. So this is why this week has been so crazy for anyone who's gone down this rabbit hole and purchased some loot, is because it's not only purchasing loot and speculating on that entire market, but all of these derivatives that you generate, like the abilities and the characters and the realms that you're mentioning, even the adventure gold that you mentioned, you have to own loot in order to mint those things and participate in those other products. And also these things just keep spinning up on a daily basis, maybe multiple times a day. These new kind of like loot derivative products, it's kind of clunky. In order to claim them, you have to go to ether scan and you're interacting directly with the smart contract.
01:13:53.458 - 01:13:56.518, Speaker B: There is no website. There's only no website to do this.
01:13:56.604 - 01:14:35.540, Speaker A: But everyone's speculating that this entire loot universe is going to be absolutely massive. And these are the economic incentives that essentially inject energy into this entire system. It's because now you have this entire loot economy, and if you want to create a new product on top of it, then you can charge a fee for that. Maybe like it's some fee when things are minted and it's very organic and very weird. Very bottom, very decentralized, right. Very bottom up, but also magical. I think skeptics will look at this and be like, but guys, you didn't actually do anything.
01:14:36.090 - 01:14:37.030, Speaker B: And it's so true.
01:14:37.100 - 01:15:03.850, Speaker A: There's no game. What are you talking about? All I see is a list of seven words and somebody's going to pay like $20,000 for that. This makes no sense, right? But I don't know. Something about it makes more sense when you put on the framing of the metaverse and this collective building that we're doing to bring it about.
01:15:04.000 - 01:15:37.800, Speaker B: So people are speculating that these loot tokens are like the crypto punks of the metaverse, right? They're the very first ones. They're the zero to one moment, and they're going kind of in the same way. There's like the fat cryptopunk thesis where all NFT value gets pushed down to cryptopunks because they're the ogs. The people are speculating that these loot bags are kind of like the same thing for the metaverse. And so that energy behind that speculation can actually manifest it into reality. Because if enough value goes into these tokens, well, there's enough incentive to actually build the damn thing because of all the speculation that's going into them.
01:15:38.650 - 01:15:57.886, Speaker A: So weird. Also so cool. I can't wait to see this experiment unfold. There is an element, though, of does this feel like a massive multiplayer game? Only for the rich, though. Like you have to fork over some significant cash or you have to be early. You need to be wealthy or you can be early in order to get in on this. What's your take?
01:15:57.988 - 01:17:00.866, Speaker B: Yeah, so the original 7500 loot bags, if the community wanted to mint more. And if we collectively decided that that was a legitimate choice, I think that's possible, that's possible for the community to do. And so that might actually be a route for funding, say like enough contributors, dedicated contributors, rise to the top, and maybe some team forms around this loot ecosystem. And maybe that team needs funding, maybe they fund themselves by minting more loot bags so that instead of just having 7500 bags, we have enough for the whole entire planet to play in this whole rpg. Now the cool thing about this loot thing is that when we talk about rpgs or Diablo two, or my favorite rpg was Borderlands, we're talking about just items inside of that one game. When it's on Ethereum, it's an rpg for the whole entire Internet, right? And so we are increasing the scale as to where and how this game can be played. And ultimately rpgs are just life like.
01:17:00.866 - 01:17:11.430, Speaker B: You go through life, you acquire items, you put them on your bookshelves, you acquire new skills, you level up. And now we're doing it on Ethereum, and that is what is creating the metaverse.
01:17:11.770 - 01:17:17.062, Speaker A: So bring your item, bring your loot item into any game, basically that supports it, right?
01:17:17.196 - 01:17:22.278, Speaker B: Any game that answers to the properties of the tokens is a part of that tokens metaverse.
01:17:22.374 - 01:17:41.600, Speaker A: And the loot community is economically incented to propagate loot everywhere. So the loot community actually wants to talk to Blizzard or Epic games or all of these game publishers and get them to support loot, right? Maybe like provide grants for new games to support.
01:17:41.970 - 01:18:12.394, Speaker B: And like, the interoperability nature of loot incentivizes it kind of in the same way that taco Bell gave out free crunchwrap supremes to dogecoin holders, whatever, right? We got free marketing, free engagement, free customers, composable community, posable communities, right? And so games could be like, hey, we included loot tokens. Now you can play our game with loot tokens and all the loot token holders, like, yay, we reward you with our engagement and now we're actually going to play your game.
01:18:12.512 - 01:18:21.638, Speaker A: As crazy as this sounds, I think this is why the crypto is feeling like this is a new unlock. It really does feel like that feels.
01:18:21.654 - 01:18:23.066, Speaker B: Like a paradigm breaking moment, for sure.
01:18:23.088 - 01:18:29.038, Speaker A: Yes, we unlocked something new here. We're in uncharted territory and it's going to be exciting to see where this goes.
01:18:29.204 - 01:18:35.770, Speaker B: Extremely speculative, extremely risky. Nothing is certain. This could just be the top of the NFT markets. Who knows?
01:18:35.850 - 01:18:40.174, Speaker A: It could be that too. We could look back and be like, we were paying what? For lists.
01:18:40.222 - 01:18:42.386, Speaker B: For lists of tokens. What?
01:18:42.488 - 01:18:43.470, Speaker A: That was the bubble.
01:18:43.550 - 01:18:45.394, Speaker B: We thought people were going to build it.
01:18:45.432 - 01:18:46.690, Speaker A: Like, that's crazy.
01:18:46.840 - 01:18:48.178, Speaker B: Why would you think that?
01:18:48.264 - 01:18:58.902, Speaker A: You never know, guys. That's the fun of crypto. Guys. We will be right back with the takes for the week and of course, the meme of the week. But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this show possible.
01:18:59.036 - 01:19:30.926, Speaker B: Gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange. I've been a customer of Gemini since I first got into crypto in 2017, and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells. Gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide. And on Gemini, there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets, including many of the hot DFI tokens. And it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid Dai markets. Gemini just launched their earn program where you can earn up to 7.4% interest on 26 various crypto assets.
01:19:30.926 - 01:20:13.826, Speaker B: If you're tired of paying fees in DFI or you don't want to worry about DFI exploits, but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets, Gemini Earn is the product for you. Another product I'm stoked to get my hands on is the Gemini crypto back credit card, which gives you 3% cash back on all of your purchases, but paid to you in your preferred crypto asset. When I get my Gemini credit card, I'm going to make sure that I get my cash back in ETH. So whenever I buy something, I get a little bit of eth bonus back to me. At the same time, you can open up a free account in under 3 minutes@gemini.com. Gobankless and if you trade more than $100 within the first 30 days after signup, you'll be gifted a free $15 bitcoin bonus. Check them out@gemini.com.
01:20:13.826 - 01:21:12.958, Speaker B: Gobankless the Ave protocol is a decentralized liquidity protocol on Ethereum, which allows users to supply and borrow certain crypto assets. Ave version two has a ton of cool features that makes using the Ave protocol even more powerful. With Ave, you can leverage the full power of DFI money, legos yield and composability all in one application. On Ave, there are a ton of assets that you can supply to the protocol in order to gain yield, and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol. If you have supplied collateral here, you can see me borrowing 200 USDC against my portfolio of a number of different DFI tokens in ETH. I'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option, but I could choose the stable interest rate option if I wanted to lock in that interest rate in permanently. V two also features the ability for users to swap collateral without having to withdraw their assets, trade them on uniswap, and then deposit them back into Ave.
01:21:12.958 - 01:21:23.830, Speaker B: With Ave, users can do this in one seamless transaction, saving you time and gas costs. Check out the power of ave@ave.com. That's aave.com.
01:21:23.900 - 01:21:38.054, Speaker A: All right, guys, here are the hot takes of the week. Let's start with this one from Alex. Defi brings the capital nfts. Bring the people. Capital people defi for capital nfts for people. What do you think? David short sweet.
01:21:38.102 - 01:21:44.666, Speaker B: To the point. These memes about how DeFi operates and how NFTs operates are getting more concise and more punchy.
01:21:44.778 - 01:22:02.580, Speaker A: I like it. I had this take this week. David says Twitter should roll out a blue check mark for NFT profile picks. Just validate them against ethereum. Every social network will be doing this soon. It's the most obvious feature ad ever, dude. I feel like it's the most obvious feature ad.
01:22:02.580 - 01:22:53.634, Speaker A: Like, meanwhile, we're doing that with Twitter. I mean, if social media is asleep at the job, new social networks will come up that actually use these valuable NFT items as profile pictures, as items in their universe, use their lore and leapfrog them. So I think Twitter will be forced into doing this, but it just seems to be the most obvious feature ad. It's like, I know you've seen some people who are kind of plagiarizing, I guess your crypto punk, and anyone could do that. It's true, you can right click. But if you had a social network that was like enforcing the validity of that punk and verifying that on chain and putting kind of just a simple checkmark, this is valid or not. I mean, it just seems so obvious you do that.
01:22:53.634 - 01:23:18.490, Speaker A: And by the way, that would inject a tremendous amount of additional value in the NFT economy. Because if that becomes a standard and all social networks do that, then the whole right click save thing becomes completely delegitimized. You can't right click save because you have a fake crypto punk. And anywhere you propagate that on the Internet, in the metaverse, it's going to show up as a fake.
01:23:18.830 - 01:23:46.486, Speaker B: NFTs are a social phenomenon and they absolutely belong in any and all social media platforms. They're people flexing their stuff and they do that on social media. So the profile picture avatar movement, I think has absolute staying power. And also to the point crypto is rampant with scams. I see fake Ryan's all the time trying to dm me and get my ether from me, but if I was, it's actually me.
01:23:46.508 - 01:23:48.050, Speaker A: David, I'm trying to get your ether.
01:23:48.210 - 01:24:31.330, Speaker B: You'Re making your own. But like, imagine if all know Vitalik impersonators or whoever impersonators had to put an NFT as their profile picture and couldn't verify their ownership of that. Like, all of a sudden this becomes extremely easy to differentiate impersonators versus non impersonators because nfts are unique. Another part of my metaverse article talks about how human identity of the human spirit can actually be captured by Ethereum addresses on Ethereum based on the nfts that they interact with. Like every NFT is its own object. And as an Ethereum address, you have your own story. And the story that you write is of the NFT objects that you come to interact with.
01:24:31.480 - 01:24:37.234, Speaker A: Yeah, you could be a turtle or you could be a crypto punk. In this new economy, crypto punks are.
01:24:37.272 - 01:24:38.900, Speaker B: Way better than turtles, by the way.
01:24:39.930 - 01:25:23.406, Speaker A: Yeah, but you know what's cool too, is we did this article with Brantley from Ens about single sign on for Ethereum, right? It's always like, oh, that would be cool if we had the ability to sign on to every app using a private key. An eth private key, right? But the question is like, oh, how is that going to happen? Why would new platforms adopt it? Maybe it happens because nfts are awesome, right? Your public private key pair owns an NFT and has to own an NFT. So that could be a way to propagate a public private key, single sign on Ethereum everywhere. Because if you have that NFT functionality, you're already doing like 90% of the work to integrate that anyway. Super cool. Let's do this. Take diamonds versus jpegs.
01:25:23.406 - 01:25:25.314, Speaker A: Which would you rather have, David? Yeah.
01:25:25.352 - 01:25:48.858, Speaker B: Tasha says carrying a rock around your finger is no less absurd than buying a rock jpeg on the Internet. If you can't appreciate the absurdity in all human rituals, you'll be a slave to past rituals, not a creator of future ones. Such a punchy take. It almost has 10,000 likes. That's crazy awesome. So this is why it's important to stop being skeptical on nfTs. You don't get to right click save them.
01:25:48.858 - 01:25:59.646, Speaker B: And she hits this so hard at the end, you will be a slave to past rituals rather than create future ones. That's so awesome. Get on board with the NFT train, people.
01:25:59.748 - 01:26:25.682, Speaker A: Look, it's memes all the way down. And crypto is just exposing the fact that it is, and it always has been. I love that take. Let's see this, David. So Vitalik did this experiment on Twitter. So he follows 268 people, and there's a Twitter setting where you can set your replies to only the people that follow you, basically. And so he did an impromptu ask me anything on Twitter.
01:26:25.682 - 01:26:48.062, Speaker A: A lot of interesting questions and answers arose, but this is one of my favorites. David. Someone asked him his biggest regrets in his Ethereum journey and had to be nontechnical. Vitalik said the whole eight co founders thing and choosing them so quickly and nondiscriminately was his biggest regret. Super interesting insight there.
01:26:48.196 - 01:27:10.822, Speaker B: This is definitely like a hindsight 2020 thing, right? Like when you don't know how big Ethereum is about to become, you're trying to just get this out the door. You choose people to help you do that, and then you accidentally choose people like Gavin Wood and co founder of Cardano, Charles Hoskinson. Yeah, like, of all of the Ethereum co founders, Vitalik is the only one.
01:27:10.876 - 01:27:14.710, Speaker A: That'S left, except Joe Lubin is kind of on the periphery.
01:27:15.850 - 01:27:17.314, Speaker B: Was he a co founder?
01:27:17.442 - 01:27:20.102, Speaker A: Is he one of the. Oh, okay, yeah, he's one of the eight. Okay.
01:27:20.156 - 01:27:21.986, Speaker B: Joe Lubin definitely counts. Absolutely.
01:27:22.108 - 01:27:22.442, Speaker A: Okay.
01:27:22.496 - 01:27:26.890, Speaker B: Yeah, there's still too many of them forked off and did their own, like.
01:27:26.960 - 01:27:50.222, Speaker A: Many of them forked off, did their own thing. Didn't really help Ethereum that much. Others just totally dropped out. Like, just didn't really develop the idea beyond the initial months. You've read the Infinite Machine by Cammy Russo, right? It goes through that entire story and you could see it. The thing that Vitalik said was good, though. Three favorite podcasts, bankless.
01:27:50.286 - 01:27:51.106, Speaker B: Number one, top one.
01:27:51.128 - 01:27:51.438, Speaker A: He listened.
01:27:51.454 - 01:27:53.634, Speaker B: Number one. I'm sure he put it in order.
01:27:53.752 - 01:28:12.860, Speaker A: Wow. I'm sure he put it in order. Two other podcasts. One is called rationally speaking, which I've not listened to. And his third favorite, hardcore history, which I absolutely love. So, man, huge honors. Like, I saw that tweet come out last night and I was just like, oh, my know, this feels good.
01:28:13.710 - 01:28:30.798, Speaker B: I was able to ask Vitalik my question because Vitalik follows me. And my question is, how do you define the Metaverse? And he gave in a single tweet the same definition that I gave in my, like, 20,000 word article. Which is even more reason why you need to go read the Metaverse article that I put out on bankless not too long ago.
01:28:30.964 - 01:28:38.340, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. He also did this, David. I guess Elon Musk asked him a question. What is love?
01:28:39.750 - 01:29:02.362, Speaker B: I don't even know how to pronounce this. But then Vitalik responds with Elon Musk's kids name that he has with Grimes, which is like Xaea twelve. Don't hurt me. It was what Vitalik said. So Elon Musk, it's, what is love? And then Vitalik responds, child's name, don't hurt me. So, like, doing a little bit of a meme, which is, yeah, this isn't going to become important very soon.
01:29:02.496 - 01:29:11.886, Speaker A: So I was not in pop culture. I was not plugged in enough to know that Elon actually named his kid this, like, series of symbols. I didn't even know what this means. Do you?
01:29:12.068 - 01:29:28.814, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay. The a twelve is the SR 71 plane. The version that came before the SR 71 was called the a twelve. And so they named it one part after a plane, X. And each one of these things has reasons behind them. They're all stupid.
01:29:28.814 - 01:29:30.340, Speaker B: Don't name your kid this.
01:29:31.750 - 01:29:32.898, Speaker A: Pronounce this.
01:29:33.064 - 01:29:37.250, Speaker B: It does have an correct pronunciation. I don't know what it is.
01:29:37.400 - 01:29:46.230, Speaker A: Well, it's been done, so you know the child's there. Maybe he'll go by 812. Who knows? David, give me this last. Take us home with this last take.
01:29:46.300 - 01:30:12.858, Speaker B: Yeah, I tweeted this out right before we did this roll up. I said, can we please just pause all Ethereum blocks this weekend? We can resume after Labor Day. I need a break, Ryan. This week has been absolutely exhausting. Not only have we done, like, 17 shows this week, but we also had this fucking loot phenomenon which takes forever to keep up with and moves. It's almost a full time job just to keep up with that. And like, God damn, dude.
01:30:12.858 - 01:30:15.970, Speaker B: We also have three shows today and three shows tomorrow.
01:30:17.110 - 01:30:18.734, Speaker A: Did you call this Ethereum brain?
01:30:18.782 - 01:30:36.102, Speaker B: I call this Ethereum brain. Eric has a great take, like, right under me. He goes, have you ever seen the 1950s horror film blob? It's basically Ethereum. It traps us and we can't get out. Apparently there's a movie about, like, a blob that just sucks everything in. This is what Ethereum does. It sucks you in and it doesn't let you leave.
01:30:36.236 - 01:30:46.442, Speaker A: Mental energy, time, capital, every single asset. I can't be mad because this is so amazing and exciting in the future, but it's hard to do anything else.
01:30:46.496 - 01:30:48.266, Speaker B: Bucket is tired in the real world.
01:30:48.448 - 01:30:53.530, Speaker A: Guys, if you're feeling that Ethereum brain, that fatigue, what's the best advice you have? David?
01:30:54.510 - 01:31:21.718, Speaker B: Okay, so this is why everyone should also listen to the Layer zero podcast that I did with Eric that came out this week. We talked about strategies, and he talks about it's just like quitting cigarettes or quitting drugs or quitting alcohol or quitting whatever you're addicted to is a skill. You have to learn how to take a step back and do something else. Because if you don't, Ethereum will suck up all of your time. It will suck up as much time and energy as you give it.
01:31:21.804 - 01:31:38.714, Speaker A: It totally will. So if you feel yourself going down that track and have some Ethereum brain encourage you, take some time away from screens. Just take some time over the weekend, maybe this Labor Day, relax, enjoy some time with your family. Don't worry, bankless is holding it down. We will be releasing, we will take.
01:31:38.752 - 01:31:41.798, Speaker B: That energy off of your shoulders and put it on ours.
01:31:41.894 - 01:32:11.158, Speaker A: I mean, some people like, look, man, how many podcasts do we do every week, right? Like five a week, plus the newsletter, plus everything, right? There's a lot. Some people just listen to the weekly roll ups, and that's kind of enough for them for some weeks, right? And then they go back and listen to other episodes later, right? So anyway, be careful. This space can do a number on you. Crypto addiction is a real addiction, and it can exhaust you. You can miss out on things in.
01:32:11.164 - 01:32:12.102, Speaker B: The real world, right?
01:32:12.156 - 01:32:12.374, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:32:12.412 - 01:32:17.400, Speaker B: Ethereum is redefining humanity, and it will also take your humanity from you if you let it.
01:32:18.110 - 01:32:19.622, Speaker A: I feel like we're speaking to ourselves.
01:32:19.686 - 01:32:23.210, Speaker B: Yeah, we need some goddamn therapy.
01:32:25.070 - 01:32:27.210, Speaker A: All right, wait for a new NFT.
01:32:28.350 - 01:32:30.830, Speaker B: Somebody drop an NFT so I can get distracted.
01:32:32.050 - 01:32:35.498, Speaker A: All right, let's get to this. What are you excited about this week, David?
01:32:35.674 - 01:33:05.862, Speaker B: God, I'm just excited, man. I don't have a single specific thing, but there's so many things to be excited about. It really feels like the stars are aligning for Ethereum. There are so many things that are happening on Ethereum that are making it more and more useful for the outside world, also making more and more sense for the outside world. Even though million dollar rocks are kind of crazy, at least we can talk about them. EIP 1559 is outperforming everyone's dreams. We get all these numbers and things to look at, so that's crazy.
01:33:05.862 - 01:33:25.082, Speaker B: There's also this NFT mania going on, which is really letting time fly and all of a sudden, proof of stake is just going to be here. So that's really exciting. There's just so much to be bullish about. And you talked about it in the market section. Like, we're kind of getting out of this crab season and starting to get bullish again. It's the super cycle, man. Super cycle is back on the menu.
01:33:25.082 - 01:33:28.234, Speaker B: It's just going to be like, so much super cycle.
01:33:28.282 - 01:33:32.640, Speaker A: And then crash. You think, no, we're going up, only.
01:33:33.490 - 01:33:37.282, Speaker B: We'Ll have a bunch of little crashes, but they won't be as much as they are up.
01:33:37.336 - 01:33:39.778, Speaker A: Yeah, we're never going to see a negative 95%.
01:33:39.864 - 01:33:50.226, Speaker B: No, never ever. Not financial advice. I mean, 50% crashes over and over and over again, along with, like, 300% run ups.
01:33:50.418 - 01:33:51.142, Speaker A: There you go.
01:33:51.196 - 01:33:55.030, Speaker B: Super cycle. Anyways, that's what I'm excited about. I'm excited about being excited.
01:33:56.810 - 01:33:57.926, Speaker A: That's good, man.
01:33:58.028 - 01:33:59.458, Speaker B: What are you excited about, Ryan?
01:33:59.634 - 01:34:20.094, Speaker A: I think I'm excited about the metaverse this week. Right. Did you read an article? I read that article is absolutely fantastic. We asked Raul Paul what his definition of the metaverse is. He said digital fluidity, which is super. But, like, we've had the Internet for a while and people have. Do you remember that game, like second life? Yeah.
01:34:20.094 - 01:35:10.430, Speaker A: I don't know when that came out, but it's like, oh, this is how humans are going to spend their time, and we're all going to be in this virtual world. And you know what I think the thing that's been missing from all these experiments in the past is? It's Ethereum, right? There's never been an organic economy on top of these systems. There's never been a property rights system. There's never been, like, a center of commerce. It's always been built more like the Metaverse and virtual reality experience have always been built more like university campuses rather than like cities. A city is, like organic, and there's different sectors and different groups, and it's very chaotic, it's very bizarre. Rather than cathedral, right? The metaverse hasn't risen up because it's basically been all cathedral based.
01:35:10.430 - 01:35:43.206, Speaker A: And I think the Ethereum piece is going to accelerate the movement to the metaverse. And some people might not like that. Some people like the physical world, but I just feel like it's inevitable, right? So it's kind of like, you may not like that jpegs are so valuable, but by resisting that movement, you're just going to disconnect yourself from the wider movement that is humanity. And I don't know you're going to Fomo in later. I don't know. You're going to realize it on the back end of this. I want to be pressing into the frontier of the metaverse.
01:35:43.206 - 01:36:07.298, Speaker A: And that's the thing. The experiments are going to get weirder. There's going to be massive opportunities for everyone who discovers this early. So I guess what I'm excited about is the metaverse and the invitation opportunity is like, plug in now. We are so early. This whole loop phenomenon is just like another unlock, and we'll see where that goes. But it is so early to be here.
01:36:07.298 - 01:36:09.922, Speaker A: But make sure you're here. Make sure you're plugging in. Yeah.
01:36:09.976 - 01:36:45.518, Speaker B: Just think about how valuable the metaverse is and how fortunate and lucky we are to be at the beginning of it. I think people all have the conviction that whatever the metaverse is, it's coming. And I think there's a very valid case that it is being built because of the property management system of Ethereum, actually instantiating objects into the metaverse, whatever the metaverse is. And you are watching that in real time, and you get to tap into the value that is created. And so that's why there's so much energy and excitement on this loot phenomenon. And that is just the beginning. Right? There's going to be so many more loot things that come out.
01:36:45.518 - 01:36:59.860, Speaker B: And if you are paying attention and if you are on the ride, you will be able to take advantage of the creation of the metaverse. You are watching the metaverse being born. Make sure you have stories to tell your kids about how you were there.
01:37:00.470 - 01:37:01.694, Speaker A: But also take breaks.
01:37:01.742 - 01:37:04.050, Speaker B: Also take breaks sometimes. Also take breaks.
01:37:04.870 - 01:37:12.006, Speaker A: Not too much. All right, David, meme of the week time. Hey, this art piece is phenomenal. Explain this art piece, and then we'll get to the meme. Yeah.
01:37:12.028 - 01:37:45.058, Speaker B: So this is a famous Renaissance painting out of the romantic era. And it's like journeyman standing on frog over sea storm. Just a very. Just like, romantic image of this guy looking over this vast, foggy sea ocean. Again, it's a meme of the romantic era, of the renaissance paintings. And now we have this. And so this is the same image overlaid, but instead of the guy standing on the sea rocks, he's standing on an ether rock, which is going for like $400 million.
01:37:45.058 - 01:37:52.770, Speaker B: And then there's just a sea of jpegs in front of them. And also this guy is now an alien cryptopunk with a beanie.
01:37:53.990 - 01:37:55.262, Speaker A: This is the new frontier.
01:37:55.326 - 01:37:56.542, Speaker B: This is the new frontier.
01:37:56.686 - 01:38:10.502, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. Great meme guys, thank you so much for hanging with us. Of course, none of this has been financial advice. Eth is risky. So is Defi. So is bitcoin. So is everything in this space.
01:38:10.502 - 01:38:17.498, Speaker A: But we are entering the metaverse. This is the frontier, and we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
