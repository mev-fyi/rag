But we are seeing the opposite. We are seeing that many protocols did very poor treasury management and now find themselves in a position where they have to reduce the headcount, they have to stop incentive, they have to raise money at peak low prices. And this is all things that if you had someone in charge of treasury management who had worked at a traditional company before, these are very basic things. I think if projects thought of themselves more as businesses then you wouldn't see some of these easy mistakes.
