00:00:00.170 - 00:00:56.474, Speaker A: Looking for the front page of Defi? Look no further than Xerion IO. Xerion is your home base for managing your DeFi portfolios. Xerion offers a central place for you to engage with all of the DeFi protocols and assets that you engage with on a daily basis, but all in one central spot. Here you can see I've loaded up a wallet and Xerion is giving me the portfolio performance of all the assets in this this wallet over time, as well as a breakdown of all the assets that I own, as well as all of my transaction history that I've ever done. In an easy to view fashion, Xerion also lets you invest right into DeFi's best yielding financial opportunities right from their homepage. Xerion also makes it super easy to access interest in DeFi using applications like compound and Ave in the background. And you can also exchange your assets using the Xerion app, using an exchange aggregator in the background to make sure that you always get the best rates.
00:00:56.474 - 00:01:31.974, Speaker A: You can even use the Xerion mobile wallet to add your metamask or argent or another ethereum address right into your mobile wallet so you can see your portfolio and engage in DeFi on the go. Here, I just loaded up my argent wallet and now I'm going to load up my metamask as well. And Xerion will do the same thing. It will add all of my assets and wallets together all in one space, and give me a portfolio summary of what's going on. Adding wallets is trivially easy. If you already have a metamask, you can get it right into the Xerion app, and it can sync with your desktop app as well. And the best part is you can also buy ether right into the app itself.
00:01:31.974 - 00:02:07.186, Speaker A: Use the invest tab to look at all the things that you have invested in, as well as other opportunities. And coming soon to the Xerion app is the ability to buy and sell your assets straight from your mobile device as well. So download the app. It works on iOS and Android. Go to Xerion IO, plug in your wallets, and get a historical report of your portfolio over time, as well as a comprehensive breakdown of all the assets that you own and how much yield they're generating for you. We're also brought to you by monolith. Monolith is your cool new DeFi account, your defi savings account, your defi checking account.
00:02:07.186 - 00:02:56.494, Speaker A: Except the cool thing about the Monolith Defi account is that it gets software updates, right? You actually get to increase the usefulness of this over time. So here are some of the features. Monolith is a smart contract wallet with a lot of the features that you would expect if you've come to know DeFi and what it is, you can add money to it. You can put that money to work in compound and accessing yield, and you can also swap through uniswap. What's cool with monolith is that they will send you a very sexy monolith visa card that connects to your Monolith smart contract wallet on Ethereum. So it's a really awesome tool to live a bankless life with a savings account that gets software updates. So this is something that you're never going to find out in the real world, but you can still do real world things with real money, like buy your groceries.
00:02:56.494 - 00:03:16.662, Speaker A: So that's just fantastic. Coming soon to Monolith. Actually already here to Monolith is now you can buy die and get it sent to your wallet directly. Right? So it's also being an on ramp. So you don't have to go through your centralized exchange like Coinbase or Gemini or wherever. You can just go straight from your bank account right into your monolith checking account. Smart contract wallet.
00:03:16.662 - 00:03:24.318, Speaker A: So check them out at Monolith XYZ. David Ryan, what are we about to do? We're about to roll it up.
00:03:24.404 - 00:03:25.246, Speaker B: Let's roll it up.
00:03:25.268 - 00:03:25.866, Speaker A: It's rolling.
00:03:25.898 - 00:03:37.730, Speaker B: About the week of December. Happy Friday morning. This comes out every Friday morning. So you can drink a cup of coffee and catch up on crypto in about 25 minutes. David, what do we do? Give us the topic list.
00:03:37.880 - 00:03:57.990, Speaker A: We take five different topics and we roll it up into five different minutes each. We talk about the market. What is the market saying? We talk about releases, what got released. Then we talk about the news. Then Ryan and I share some of our takes. And finally we finish off with what we are excited about. There is a ton of news to roll up in this week.
00:03:57.990 - 00:04:08.602, Speaker A: So much happens. And so we are going to roll up a whole entire week's worth of information, inject it straight into your brain so you can keep up with the crazy world of crypto. Ryan, are you ready?
00:04:08.736 - 00:04:22.218, Speaker B: I'm ready, man. Let's do it. Okay, let's start with the market. The question is, what is the market saying? I feel like it's saying price go up. I think it says number go up. What a week, man. Let's start with bitcoin.
00:04:22.218 - 00:04:27.154, Speaker B: All time highs. After flirting with it for I don't know how many weeks. Feels like four weeks.
00:04:27.192 - 00:04:27.634, Speaker A: Four weeks.
00:04:27.672 - 00:04:30.642, Speaker B: Yeah, it hit it. Tell us about it.
00:04:30.696 - 00:04:59.494, Speaker A: Yeah. Interestingly enough, three years to the date that bitcoin painted the almost twenty k all time high in 2017. We broke it on December 16, three years later, cruising through the almost $24,000 in the last two days, bitcoin has painted almost two candles at $2,000 each. That is crazy. The volatility is back, baby.
00:04:59.622 - 00:05:11.360, Speaker B: Do you know what this means? David? I was thinking about this. It means every single person who told you that bitcoin would never reach all time high again is wrong.
00:05:11.890 - 00:05:14.878, Speaker A: Ever doubted. Bitcoin is fundamental, proven wrong.
00:05:14.964 - 00:05:39.334, Speaker B: They're wrong like they've been wrong. And it kills me that people give advice without any skin in the game. Nasib Taleb talks about this and it happens all of the time. These analysts and these experts and these economists give advice without any skin in the game. And it costs them nothing when they're wrong. Well, they were all wrong. Bitcoin came back, hit all time highs again and no signs of slowing down.
00:05:39.452 - 00:06:10.882, Speaker A: Should we get the ether price right before we do? This? Feels like the starting pistol for the game, where all the whole 2018 2019 slow ramp and even the 2020 slow ramp, the game didn't start until all time high was passed. And so the game starts now. Congratulations. We all have been talking about like, yo, the bull market is here. But we never really felt too confident about it. Now that bitcoin is at all time highs blasting through its previous levels. Officially, the bull market is on.
00:06:10.882 - 00:06:13.906, Speaker A: There's no other way to have a bull market. Bull market is here.
00:06:14.008 - 00:06:25.094, Speaker B: You can't interpret this any other way. What have we been saying? We've been saying this is 2016. Next year is 2017. We'll see how it works out. Let's talk about ETH price. EtH price go up, too?
00:06:25.212 - 00:06:51.680, Speaker A: Yeah. ETH number go up all the way. ETH painted a $100 day yesterday going from just under $600. I think it was at like 590. And then I guess it didn't do a full $100. But then it reached a peak of roughly $680 earlier today. And then it's taken a bit of a tumble back down to 630, a little bit off the all time highs, but still really strong.
00:06:52.610 - 00:07:14.082, Speaker B: Crazy. Seems like only yesterday, David. In fact, it was March of this year when ETH price was under $100. It just went up $100 in a day. But within recent memory, the last nine or ten months, it was actually under $100. Pretty crazy. ETH is actually up 370% on the year, which is super impressive.
00:07:14.082 - 00:07:29.818, Speaker B: Bitcoin up 180%. Both having very good years, phenomenal years. Breaking the back of the bull market. I would say we should also talk about total locked value in Ethereum because that is up to all time highs, it looks like.
00:07:29.904 - 00:07:48.434, Speaker A: Yeah, it was even higher, much higher earlier today. Earlier today it was at 16 and a half billion. It's down to 15.9 billion. But that's still much higher than the 14 billion it was at last week. Same thing with the DPI D five pulse index. Last week it was at $101.
00:07:48.434 - 00:08:02.040, Speaker A: Now it's at $112. Actually, as far as number go up goes, that number didn't go up very much. DPI kind of lagged behind. DFI has not made the big moves that bitcoin or Ether have.
00:08:03.050 - 00:08:24.394, Speaker B: The DPI that David was talking about. Of course, if you're new, that is an index of the top defi tokens on Ethereum. Pretty insane weeks for both bitcoin and ether as an asset. There's also been some insane premiums in the grayscale market. So look at these. Of course, grayscale. You can catch our episode with Michael sun and Shine from Grayscale.
00:08:24.394 - 00:08:32.640, Speaker B: This is a way to buy trust type products. Get some ETH exposure, get some bitcoin exposure in your retirement account if you want to do it that way.
00:08:33.170 - 00:08:36.094, Speaker A: Wow. Premium is insane.
00:08:36.222 - 00:08:52.594, Speaker B: 200%. 200% versus spot price. If you're buying ethe in your retirement account, you're paying over 200% more than somebody who's buying it on the Coinbase exchange. That just shows you how much institutional locked up demand there is for these assets.
00:08:52.722 - 00:09:15.118, Speaker A: Well, it also shows retail demand. Right. Because Ethe is just like, okay, what's this Ethereum thing? How do I access it? Where do I go to get exposure? Let me go to where I always go, which is my broker. Oh, there's this trust thing that gives me exposure to ether. I'll buy it, and then they just hit the buy button. They don't really understand what they're buying. It doesn't matter, but that's where that premium comes from.
00:09:15.118 - 00:09:28.734, Speaker A: The fact that people are willing to pay. Basically what's going on is people are paying almost double for the price of ether for convenience. Right. And so there's a lot of people that really want ether. Quite a lot, apparently.
00:09:28.862 - 00:10:01.950, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. I thought Anthony Sasano had a really interesting comparison. The last time ether price was above 500%, he goes through some $500. $500, excuse me, was the last time it was at $500? November 29, 2017, versus today. Of course, it's above $500 and unique addresses. So the increase in basically Ethereum bank accounts, these are ETH addresses. 900% increase from five years ago, or, excuse me, from three years ago when the price was $500.
00:10:01.950 - 00:10:33.846, Speaker B: So he goes through some other stats. Active addresses are up 60%. 24 hours transaction count up 80%. The fees, the revenue on a 24 period hour period of time. The demand for block space up 1470%. DFI is up like infinite amounts from 10 million to like. Well, DFI was invented, basically invented, right? So this paints the picture to me, David, of an ether price of 500.
00:10:33.846 - 00:10:53.050, Speaker B: November 29, 2017. It was based on unfulfilled dreams like potential. The Ethereum of today has brought a lot of these dreams to life, and it's a massive amount of real world traction that we've seen, yet the same similar price point. Pretty crazy. What's your take on that?
00:10:53.120 - 00:11:37.178, Speaker A: Yeah, it's also good to remind ourselves that ether is still roughly 50% off of its all time high. Now, I don't really ascribe too much weight to all time previous all time high prices because of how incredibly fleeting they were. Bitcoin was at 19,700 for ten minutes before it dropped. And ether was at the all time high price of $1,370 for just like moments, right? So it didn't really put too much history or meaning into those numbers. But at the end of the day, ether price is 50% of its previous all time high. Meanwhile, the network has improved by multiple orders of magnitude. Some things like DFI exist now that just didn't exist last time ether was at this price.
00:11:37.178 - 00:11:42.506, Speaker A: And that discrepancy between those two things looks like opportunity to me.
00:11:42.608 - 00:12:05.250, Speaker B: You know another thing that didn't exist for Ethereum, David? Staking, staking, my friend. There's now 1 billion worth of ETH in the e two deposit contract. So this Internet bond we've been talking about, this digital Internet bond, is now worth over a billion dollars, which is pretty incredible. Some other Ethereum stats we should talk about. The number of Ethereum addresses passed a milestone.
00:12:05.750 - 00:12:08.114, Speaker A: Ethereum addresses with ether in it.
00:12:08.152 - 00:12:24.380, Speaker B: Oh, excuse me, with ether in it. Passed over 50 million. Actually. I'm not sure if I have this chart up, but that's incredible. That's like an all time high for any crypto network. The number of Ethereum addresses with the asset ether in it, over 50 million.
00:12:24.830 - 00:12:43.962, Speaker A: Right. And importantly, that's a number that can go down where total number of Ethereum addresses that have had a transaction with them only ever goes up. This is closer to actual usage. Right. Like strictly the number of wallets that actually hold a balance of ether. Just reaching all time highs every single day, it looks like.
00:12:44.036 - 00:13:12.714, Speaker B: Pretty crazy. We've got USDC that now hit over $3 billion. Of course, all settled on Ethereum ETH option open interest, that's at $1 billion too. So ETH options. We'll talk about some really interesting news around ETH options in just a moment. But even on crypto exchanges like Darabit and OKX, that's at all time highs to 50 x increase this year. The options market for ether this year has come a long way.
00:13:12.714 - 00:13:14.106, Speaker B: Pretty crazy as well.
00:13:14.208 - 00:13:34.580, Speaker A: Yeah, and I'm not totally familiar with the options world, but I'm pretty sure, at least with things like derebit or perhaps even all options. I'm not an expert, but you need ether collateral in your account to play with these options. Right. And so while these things are centralized, the volume, the open interest volume, requires ether collateral to make that work.
00:13:34.950 - 00:14:06.298, Speaker B: Let's talk about some other big option news. Let's get to the new releases. David. This has been something that's been, I guess, foretold for weeks, not months. The CME Group. This is the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the biggest financial derivatives exchange in the world for traditional markets for anything. They finally announced that they're going to release an ether futures product.
00:14:06.298 - 00:14:11.630, Speaker B: So bitcoin, of course, has an ether futures product, and the CME has had that since 2017.
00:14:11.970 - 00:14:22.222, Speaker A: Ether is literally a week three years ago to the week bitcoin futures was offered by CME. Really weird three year anniversary is going on right now.
00:14:22.276 - 00:15:05.382, Speaker B: Very strange timing. I'm not sure if they just do stuff in December or what, but three years later, now this is the second crypto asset to be added, which means if they are successfully added, ether really has the green light to be considered a commodity by us regulatory authorities, which is pretty incredible. Has to be decentralized enough to be a commodity. This is just going to open up the institutional floodgates for Ether as an asset, as it has with bitcoin. I wouldn't be surprised. We've talked about this before, David, but all of the fund managers and institutions who are saying, we love bitcoin, we're buying bitcoin, announcing it. Part of the reason is because now they can get their hands on, right? So they don't announce until after they bought the thing.
00:15:05.382 - 00:15:23.298, Speaker B: They're not going to tell you that they own bitcoin until they have tons of bitcoin. They just moved into a position. I think the same thing is going to happen increasingly with ether. These large institutions are going to go buy some ether, then they're going to tell you about it maybe a few weeks or months later because this has opened up the gates. Any takes here?
00:15:23.384 - 00:15:52.714, Speaker A: Yeah, the main takeaway here is in addition to just opening up the options for big money to have exposure to ether, this is also something that needs to happen. If there is ever going to be an ether ETF, which I totally think there will be. The bitcoin ETF is probably going to come first. But the thing is, big brother bitcoin fights the hard fight with the regulators, and then ether just like slips right through. I'm a younger child. I have an older sister, a much older sister. She fought with my parents to get a cell phone.
00:15:52.714 - 00:15:56.858, Speaker A: And when I had to fight for my cell phone, I didn't have to fight so hard. That's like ether and bitcoin.
00:15:56.954 - 00:16:00.142, Speaker B: That's not fair, mom. I'm sure she said that a lot.
00:16:00.196 - 00:16:01.120, Speaker A: Exactly right.
00:16:01.490 - 00:16:24.258, Speaker B: Well, it might not be fair, but that is indeed what is happening. Bitcoin is leading the way for ether, the asset. This is interesting in releases as well. Swivel finance is an interest rate derivative protocol. It's built on Aave and compound they just released. We're seeing like new DeFi protocols emerge every week. What's interesting or special about this one? David?
00:16:24.354 - 00:16:50.862, Speaker A: Yeah, there's two ways to make a money Lego on Ethereum, you build one from scratch, or you connect two other money legos with your third money Lego. And that's what this swivel finance is. It's an interest rate derivatives platform, which is just increasing the financialization of the Defi world. This is a product that legacy people would find themselves familiar with. But now it is, in a defi context, just inevitable before something like this comes out. So cool. Glad it's finally here.
00:16:50.916 - 00:17:18.502, Speaker B: Dope Circle is a crypto bank. They are releasing a new earnings account. It's basically a high yield USDC business account for businesses. Again, we think that yield is going to be a big driver of defi products. In a world of decreasing yield to 0% and below 0%. That's what you find in traditional finance. When DFI can start to offer these things and even crypto banks can start to offer these things, that's going to bring on mainstream.
00:17:18.502 - 00:17:19.990, Speaker B: Any hot takes here, David?
00:17:20.070 - 00:17:53.518, Speaker A: Yeah. Once again, Ethereum proving to be the last bastion of yield in this financial world and being proven out by people on the podcast who aren't seeing the screen. What circle is offering is 8.5% interest on your USDC deposits, depending on the product that you choose. Even if it's a fixed term, they are advertising as high as ten point 75%. That is high. If you go out and tell businesses that they can get almost 11% yield on their cash, it's a no brainer.
00:17:53.518 - 00:18:00.850, Speaker A: It's like, yes, please give that to me. That is something that the world absolutely wants these days and just can't be found anywhere outside of Ethereum.
00:18:01.010 - 00:18:40.098, Speaker B: Yeah. By the way, with the news that we announced three weeks ago about Visa essentially enabling payment rails for USDC, this pairs so nicely with that. Now you've got a business bank account where you're receiving high yields, and then you've got a way to pay for things with USDC using the Visa crypto rails. Pretty incredible. Kraken is launching lightning integration in 2021. It feels about time, right? A lot of bitcoiners and crypto exchanges have been talking about lightning for a while. I'm glad they're doing this.
00:18:40.098 - 00:18:42.786, Speaker B: This feels like a long time coming. Any takes here.
00:18:42.888 - 00:19:15.102, Speaker A: Yeah. It's good to see lightning finally coming into the world, right? Exchanges would be the logical first people to implement lightning for payments. There's a bunch of skepticism, especially out of the ethereum world, as to whether lightning is even legit or not. I think this is going to be a really great litmus test to see. Do people actually want to use lightning as a real solution to a real problem, or is it just kind of this hypothetical tinkerers environment? Lightning is about to, quote unquote, go mainstream and be put against the free market. So let's see if the free market wants it.
00:19:15.236 - 00:20:13.274, Speaker B: Something else we've been tracking has been the emergence of digital currencies in places like China. And I don't have the link open, but David, I looked at an article that actually showed somebody paying with a digital wand using touchpay on their phone. So basically, one smartphone to the other, and they used China's new central bank digital currency, made a payment. I think people don't realize, particularly maybe in Europe and North America, that digital currency, central bank digital currencies in Asia, at least in, like, they're here, they're in the process of being rolled out right now. In a year, a year and a half or two years time, it's going to be everywhere. And other central banks are going to need to compete with that level of infrastructure. Like, it's happened, it's here, and it's going to cause everything to accelerate and become more digital.
00:20:13.402 - 00:20:29.574, Speaker A: Yeah, Adria moves faster than we do. And yeah, let's not be flippant about it. They are way ahead of the west when it comes to central bank digital currencies. And the west is going to, if they are not already going to feel extremely threatened by that.
00:20:29.692 - 00:21:00.062, Speaker B: Yeah, space race is an interesting analogy for what is about to happen, I think. Wow. We talk about these releases, but they seem to fit kind of a common mold of institutional adoption. Someone every week is building something new in a money protocol on DeFi, the crypto banks are becoming more like fintech central bank digital currencies. They always seem to fit a similar mold, David. So I hope listeners are seeing the trends here and extrapolating those trends. Let's move on to news.
00:21:00.062 - 00:21:03.710, Speaker B: The big news, I think, of the week.
00:21:03.860 - 00:21:05.634, Speaker A: Other than all time highs, other than.
00:21:05.672 - 00:21:38.250, Speaker B: All time highs, other than ether being listed on the CME, maybe number three is coinbase is announcing the confidential submission of a draft registration statement. What does that mean? It means they are likely gearing up for an ipo in 2021. The first large crypto initial public offering I think that we have probably ever seen. That's got to be maybe in the double digit billions by the times they list. Pretty massive. David, what's your take?
00:21:38.400 - 00:22:10.230, Speaker A: This is Coinbase is, I'm pretty sure, crypto's largest company, right. And definitely crypto's largest company in America. So Coinbase going public is an extremely big deal in so many different ways. It's extremely legitimizing to our industry. It's a way to people like Coinbase, quote unquote, sells shovels, right. And traditional investors who maybe don't care to purchase bitcoin and ether, but are definitely interested in selling people shovels would definitely purchase Coinbase. Also, interestingly, they announced this the day after bitcoin all time high day.
00:22:10.230 - 00:22:44.986, Speaker A: I think that that was a very strategic move. I think that they had this ready to go in their back pocket to announce the day after bitcoin broke its all time high. And they are very strategically positioning their ipo to come during a mania period, right during a hype cycle. While everyone, while the premiums for bitcoin on grayscale are super high, while there is just incredible interest in bitcoin, Coinbase is going to ipo and the timing couldn't be perfect and it's just going to be. So it's also just another thing to propel the bull market. This is a super bullish development.
00:22:45.178 - 00:23:13.322, Speaker B: I totally agree. And the timing is right and well played on Coinbase's part. They've been talking about this for years. And now it's here, right in time for the bull market. As David, you mentioned, this was pretty big news as well. It feels like another theme on these roll ups is every week we announce some institution, some billionaire, some hedge fund who has just purchased more crypto assets, bitcoin primarily. But this one caught my interest as well.
00:23:13.322 - 00:23:55.750, Speaker B: This is one river asset management. The CIO CEO Eric Peters just put another 600 million into two things, bitcoin and ether. It's interesting because we had that conversation just this week, David, with Ryan Selkis, talking about how Bitcoin was the only asset that's really getting put on institutions balance sheets. But very clearly in the Bloomberg terminal, you have the purchase of almost 600 million and adding to you about a billion dollars of bitcoin and ether. Both of those assets together are being institutionalized. What's your take here?
00:23:55.820 - 00:24:25.254, Speaker A: Yeah, dude, there is no such thing as tribalism outside of the crypto world. The legacy world. The legacy investors, they don't care about tribalism. They see bitcoin and they see Ether and they want exposure to this world when they just purchased bitcoin. They don't have anti non bitcoin asset opinions like many bitcoiners do. So the diversification is like the name of the game when it comes to these legacy investors. And so they look at all the possible investments to make in the space in addition to bitcoin.
00:24:25.254 - 00:24:43.750, Speaker A: And ether is a close second right. And the market cap of ether is like one fifth or one 7th the market cap of bitcoin, which means that $1 into ethereum, $1 into purchasing ether means so much more when it comes to moving the price, simply because of Ether's lower market cap.
00:24:43.900 - 00:24:56.250, Speaker B: Yeah, that's an excellent point, that last bit. And the interesting thing about this is it's really a two horse race. It's bitcoin and ether and nothing else. It's like both of those assets, they are not going to put something like XRP on their balance sheet.
00:24:56.910 - 00:24:57.990, Speaker A: Cryptocurrency.
00:24:58.150 - 00:25:26.710, Speaker B: Okay, let's talk about this, too. So our friend Hugh Karp, we've had on the podcast before, go check out that episode. He's the CEO of Nexus Mutual, Defi insurer D five protocol. He just got hacked for about 8 million in NXM tokens. And the way he was hacked, David, super scary. Super scary. It was actually the hacker had remote control over the computer he was using.
00:25:26.710 - 00:25:58.414, Speaker B: And Hugh is an experienced defi operator. Of course he covers his tracks good. Opsec was using a ledger with metamask, and the attacker somehow rewired metamask. It would display some different output and channel a transaction that Hugh made from his ledger, his hardware wallet, to a different destination than Hugh intended. So that's a story that's kind of still developing, but what's your take on that?
00:25:58.532 - 00:26:24.120, Speaker A: Yeah, I always knew that something like this attack vector existed, but I never heard anyone making any noise about it, so I just never really bothered to protect myself from it. What happened was that some hacker got access to Hughes laptop and did a hot swap of metamask. Right. Installed a malicious version of metamask that looks exactly the like. I don't know how many transactions you make where you just don't really verify the data because it always works.
00:26:24.970 - 00:26:25.942, Speaker B: I never do that.
00:26:25.996 - 00:26:50.830, Speaker A: I never do that anymore. Now, something I've also haven't done since this is make a transaction on my ledger via metamask, because I'm a little bit scared. Right. You and I are both very public people. So is Hugh. That's kind of having. We are going to have Hugh on the show once this whole ordeal gets settled, because there is a little bit of a police chase going on right now.
00:26:50.830 - 00:27:22.454, Speaker A: Interestingly enough, the hacker. The only way that the hacker knew, or something to do with the fact that the hacker was a customer of Nexus mutual, which means that that customer is Kyc'd, which is really interesting, and that's not really a great position to be in as the hacker. And so there is a police chase going on right now. The Nexus and Hugh are working with authorities to get back his money. So that'll be an interesting development. And once the silence is lifted from that whole story, we're going to tell it on the bankless YouTube.
00:27:22.582 - 00:27:58.230, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. Make sure you stay tuned into that just for your own OPSEC purposes. Right. So we can kind of figure out how individuals who are going bankless can protect themselves against this sort of thing. That'll be part of the story as well. David, let's talk about the office of Comptroller, who has been pretty bullish lately on ether and on crypto assets, is making some statements. This is in the US wanting to more formally integrate stablecoin issuers into the existing banking system.
00:27:58.230 - 00:28:28.990, Speaker B: I think this is Brian Brooks, who is doing this. Does it seem inevitable, David, that stablecoin issuers are going to be regulated in some way? We just had a conversation with Rowan Gray, who, of course, is the proponent of the stable act. He definitely wants to regulate all of the issuers, but it feels like it's going to come in one form or another. And some of the issuers, the decentralized issuers anyway, are sort of like proponents of some light regulation as well. What's your take on this news?
00:28:29.140 - 00:28:49.750, Speaker A: Yeah, Rohan Gray's argument is that if it walks and talks like money, it needs to be regulated like money. And to some degree something like USDC. I kind of do support that. Right. Because they are in the meat space world. They are connected to the legacy banking system. And so there should be some amount of regulation, I guess regulation isn't evil by nature.
00:28:49.750 - 00:29:06.460, Speaker A: So I think this is kind of just a natural evolution of the industry. Like the parts of Ethereum that connect to the United States banking system, they're going to get regulated. I'm not interested in fighting that too hard. I don't even see what would be beneficial about it.
00:29:07.630 - 00:29:23.098, Speaker B: Another interesting, I guess, news development is somebody created a way to stream long term incentives on Ethereum. This is a developer by the name of James Fickle. Can you talk a little bit about this open grant project, David?
00:29:23.194 - 00:29:44.614, Speaker A: Yeah. So this is just trying to solve the principal agent problem, in my opinion, where a lot of Ethereum development should be incentivized financially. And it is. But what this project is trying to go after is trying to incentivize in ethnominated returns. Right. And so people that are working on the Ethereum ecosystem are by proxy increasing the value of ether, the asset. Right.
00:29:44.614 - 00:30:11.694, Speaker A: And so this is a way to reward developers working on Ethereum with ether denominated returns rather than us dollar denominated returns, meaning that if they do a good job, then Ethereum will be better and ether will be more valuable and they'll be able to access that upside that they created for the network. So just a really good incentive alignment system. And that's really what Ethereum is all about, is like offering tools for you to tinker with incentives so that we can produce the outcomes that we want.
00:30:11.892 - 00:31:10.402, Speaker B: Yeah, it's really great to see between things like this. And of course Gitcoin, the community is really solving the public goods problem of how to fund this sort of infrastructure, which has always been part of the bear case. I think for cryptocurrencies it's like great, you're rewarding miners, you'rewarding validators, but how do you reward the equivalent of the hospitals and roads and the public infrastructure that needs to be developed for these systems? And the community is coming up with really creative ways to harness the money protocols that we have to do this. And that's super exciting, super bullish. David, have you kept up with the whole NFT art scene at all? Because there are some artists that are having some massive success. And this really feels like to me, like this is going to be something really big is going to come out of the art scene, the crypto art scene and the NFT scene in 2021. And maybe it's already starting.
00:31:10.402 - 00:31:20.678, Speaker B: So this artist, Beeple, just made $3.5 million in an NFT auction. Dude, that's crazy. $3.5 million for digital art, right?
00:31:20.764 - 00:31:37.594, Speaker A: Yeah. I first came across Beeple because Joe Rogan tweeted about him saying that he thinks that his art is really cool and his art is really cool. It's very unique. It's kind of also OD. I would say it's odd art. Definitely worth checking it out, peoplecrap.com, where you can go check out some of his work.
00:31:37.594 - 00:32:10.274, Speaker A: But yeah, he auctioned off seven nfts for $3.5 million. So first off, congratulations to this guy. Second off, this is just going to open up the floodgates towards digital art, right? This is how a digital art mania gets started. I expect this to be kind of like bitcoin crossing the all time high. I expect this to kind of be a starting pistol for digital art, an artist coming to, because if somebody's making $3.5 million by selling digital art, a lot of people are going to take notice and be like, I can also get a chunk of that.
00:32:10.312 - 00:32:12.870, Speaker B: Dude, this is some weird stuff. I don't know if you read this.
00:32:12.940 - 00:32:13.634, Speaker A: Yeah, it's really weird.
00:32:13.682 - 00:32:25.660, Speaker B: This is like Donald Trump running through fire. But apparently this art piece is programmable. And it was like, if Trump wins, the art itself changes to a video of a sexy boy king Trump. Like, what is this?
00:32:26.190 - 00:32:35.546, Speaker A: Well, this is part of the art, right? The Beeple guy is like a really creative, kind of off brand guy. That's part of his brand that you're buying into when you buy one of the NFTs.
00:32:35.658 - 00:32:43.518, Speaker B: Wow. Super creative. Super interesting, David. We've gone through market releases, news time for some takes.
00:32:43.684 - 00:33:31.902, Speaker A: If you want to live a bankless life, you need to get a hardware wallet. There is no alternative for storing your crypto in a self sovereign fashion. That's why I have four ledgers that I use to manage my different crypto assets using the Ledger live account as well. Ledger Live is like your home base for managing your Ethereum, defi and crypto accounts. It does a really good job of aggregating all of your different Ethereum wallets if you are the type of person that uses more than one. But you can also add other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or Cosmos or whatever your preferred blockchain is, and then it will display an aggregate portfolio of all your accounts at the main page. One thing that ledger is doing a really good job of is enabling all the money verbs that me and Ryan talk about with the bankless skillcube enabled in the Ledger Live app.
00:33:31.902 - 00:34:26.966, Speaker A: So right now in the Ledger Live app, you can buy, sell, lend, swap and stake your crypto assets, which is doing a really good job of fulfilling all of the money verbs in the bankless skillcube. Something that's new to Ledger Live is Ledger swap, where you can swap assets one for another directly inside the ledger live application, ensuring trustlessness in your financial activity, on Ethereum and on bitcoin. If you want to learn more about what you can do with a ledger, go to the blog post the power of Ledger live on the Ledger website where they share some of the more advanced things that you can do with your ledger that you might not have known about. There's a link in the show notes that will take you to the ledger shop where you can get your preferred ledger hardware wallet. I personally like the Ledger Nano X, but I also have both. They're both great options. When you own a ledger, you own your own assets in the way that they have been designed to be held by the user and the user alone.
00:34:26.966 - 00:35:20.210, Speaker A: So go get your ledger today to make sure that you are as self sovereign as possible. The bankless state of the nations are brought to you by Wyrn. Wyrn is DeFi's first self building community run project which I just get really excited about. Wiren is a system that seeks out yield in DeFi, and it does that in a number of different ways. A very aggressive way is with the vaults where you can deposit your preferred asset of choice and different DeFi experts will come in and generate a strategy for what to do with your deposited token, right? And so it'll go find ways to get yield in that deposited token in DeFi. For those who want to just earn yield on their stablecoins, the earn system is for you, where you can deposit your preferred stablecoin and Wyrn will go and figure out which money market on DeFi in DeFi is producing the best interest rate. Whether it's DydX, it's compound, or aave.
00:35:20.210 - 00:35:32.726, Speaker A: It looks around DeFi to see where the yield is coming from, and it directs stablecoins automatically so you don't have to check them out at yearn finance to get started. And also check out the stats page to see what other people are doing.
00:35:32.828 - 00:35:34.822, Speaker B: What is your hot take this week?
00:35:34.956 - 00:36:04.750, Speaker A: My hot take is about this bull market, and it is different this time. TM this bull market is different this time. And there's just a number of different reasons why it's different this time. First and foremost, obviously, we are in times of money. Printer go burr we are in the middle of an economic contraction while we are also simultaneously having monetary base growth and inflation. Right? And so while the economy might be down, there's so much more money in the world. And so that's already, quote unquote, it's different this time.
00:36:04.750 - 00:36:32.286, Speaker A: What's also different in this time is as a result of that, the investors coming into this space are different. They are funds. They are boards of people making governance decisions about treasuries. They are long term holders, not the fickle retail who were like, the price of bitcoin drops by like 5%, and then they get scared out of their positions. These people don't get scared out of their positions. They are here for the long haul. Right? They are not trading bitcoin.
00:36:32.286 - 00:36:56.018, Speaker A: They are taking it and removing it from the market. And there's a lot of them. Meanwhile, we have like three and a half million dollars being purchased on nfts. That's also something that's totally different. It's also different like we've talked about previously on previous roll ups and basically across every bankless channel, Defi didn't exist last time. There's different surface areas for investments, gaming. It's all happening all at once.
00:36:56.018 - 00:37:24.090, Speaker A: This bull market is not the same thing as previous bull markets because of how much optionality there is to express bullish opinions in different investments and also just the different players. In 2017 and the mania of 2017, crypto was like a household name. Everyone knew that this cryptomania was going on. I think people are going to understand that a lot sooner. And I think the crypto is about to become just a very common talking conversation point from everyone, not just the crypto.
00:37:27.390 - 00:37:33.290, Speaker B: Agree, you know? So can I make my hot take sort of a riff off of your hot take? Is that allowed?
00:37:33.370 - 00:37:35.294, Speaker A: I feel like that's how this podcast goes.
00:37:35.412 - 00:38:03.346, Speaker B: Okay, so it's different this time. Tm, right? So just building off what you said another way it's different is this time we actually have DFI, capital assets. We have tokens that are capital assets. And here's what I mean by that. So like 2017, all of the token mania had no substance behind it. These tokens didn't have cash flows associated with them. They didn't even really have value accrual mechanisms.
00:38:03.346 - 00:38:26.554, Speaker B: It was just some nebulous thesis that, yeah, I buy a token, bitcoin went up, ether went up. So therefore this token should go up. Right? The era of utility or futility tokens, as we called them, that is not the era that we're living in right now. So what I think is going to happen is mainstream finance. First, they're getting their arms wrapped around bitcoin and digital scarcity. Okay, done. Checkmark.
00:38:26.554 - 00:39:13.270, Speaker B: Right. Next they move into ether and this whole Ethereum economy and ether the asset, and they start to understand digital bonds, the Internet bond, productive asset, the ability of ether as an asset to generate revenue from the economy that's building. Okay, check mark in progress, right? Like that's happening right now. They're also going to understand this cycle, defi tokens, capital assets, things like Wifi, which just released a quarterly report last week. It was generating something like 3 million in quarterly revenue, right? This is real revenue. These are real financial assets and they are producing returns for investors. And I haven't heard anyone in financial mainstream talk about that yet.
00:39:13.270 - 00:39:44.070, Speaker B: Like they're not even aware that this world exists. They understand bitcoin, maybe they've heard of Ethereum, but they don't understand that there is a future SP 500 that is in the process of being built. But they will this cycle. We've got some really interesting analysis tools this cycle, too. So we just put out how to use token terminal to calculate price to sales ratios and price to earnings ratios. And it's like financial kind of stuff. We could start to do that now we're understanding these assets more than ever.
00:39:44.070 - 00:39:47.030, Speaker B: So you know what, David? You're right. This time it is different.
00:39:47.100 - 00:40:12.522, Speaker A: It's different when the investors of the world, when the investor class of the world, the funds, whatever, and they come to Ethereum and they see that there is a open sea of possible investable sets that are worthy of their research and attention. They're going to get really excited because they thought that they knew about all the assets of the world, but turns out there's a bunch of new assets they didn't even know existed. And you know what they're going to do when they discover all of those new assets?
00:40:12.666 - 00:40:13.902, Speaker B: What are they going to do, David?
00:40:13.966 - 00:40:21.042, Speaker A: Probably subscribe to bankless. Probably bankless. Q three token report that was a great token report.
00:40:21.176 - 00:40:46.810, Speaker B: They should, but I'm excited for them to come. David. But you know what I'm more excited about is the bankless community front running them. We've been talking about this for the last bags front run. This is part of it. They're going to slowly wake up to this, but because we're using these systems every day, we know what's about to happen. So guys, subscribe to Bankless, continue to front run the Wall street investors who are about to jump in here.
00:40:46.810 - 00:40:55.002, Speaker B: All right, that was takes, but I felt like that was a bit of what we're excited about too. Is there something else you're excited about? What else are you excited about, David?
00:40:55.066 - 00:41:39.526, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm actually excited about an article that is coming out on the bankless newsletter that I'm writing called Ethereum is a trust plant. I like plants, as you guys can tell, I have plants behind me. But I wrote an article about how Ethereum is similar to a plant. And I think if you really want to understand how these systems work, the right perspective is actually one of biology. And that's kind of what I make the case in the article. One of the things that, and this gets to the thing that I'm excited about is not only to release that article and for everyone to read it and tell me what their feedback is, but also the way a good, healthy, vibrant plant works and lives is through redundancy. Right? And we are seeing coming out of defi a bunch of redundant systems.
00:41:39.526 - 00:42:02.754, Speaker A: Right. There's a lot of dependency on Dai. Right. Now, Dai is not all that redundant, but actually we're getting new projects like empty set dollar and a few other decentralized stablecoins as redundant systems in addition to compound. Now we also have Ave and now we have redundant money markets. And the best thing about Defi is the room for redundant systems. Right.
00:42:02.754 - 00:42:26.710, Speaker A: If Aave goes down, compound's there to replace it. Right. Hopefully if maker goes down, there's a new alternative, decentralized stablecoin to replace that. And so what really gets me excited about is the anti fragility I'm seeing growing out of the defi space. If something breaks, something else in Defi can take up that and bear that weight and the structure just won't collapse because of how we have redundant structures.
00:42:26.870 - 00:42:36.446, Speaker B: Guys, you knew it was only a matter of time before David combines both of his passions, botany and crypto, into a single article. I'm excited to read that to you, my friend.
00:42:36.548 - 00:42:43.386, Speaker A: Yeah, no, it's almost done coming out. I think the 30 December. So pretty soon David does these reads.
00:42:43.418 - 00:42:50.526, Speaker B: Too on the YouTube. Another reason to subscribe where he'll actually walk through and read the article to you so you can get in your brain that way too. Really cool.
00:42:50.548 - 00:42:56.790, Speaker A: Yeah, I put some voice and emphasis into it too, so it's fun to listen to it. All right, Ryan, what are you excited know?
00:42:56.860 - 00:43:45.778, Speaker B: Okay, so the CME news is so big with ether. So we're having this debate with Ryan Selkis earlier this week, right? Kind of a is eth money debate. And it turned out that that wasn't even the debate because we actually both agreed that if you use the definition of money that I use and you use that Ether is money. And he said, yep, I agree. But what I don't agree about this is Ryan Stelkis, who runs crypto analysts for Masari. He's what I don't think is going to happen is that Ether is never going to be a monetary asset in the way that bitcoin is. And if I'm to paraphrase him, the main reason he said, is because institutions like microstrategy, like large hedge funds, Paul Tura Jones of the world, they are not currently putting ether on their balance sheet and they won't in the future.
00:43:45.778 - 00:44:35.118, Speaker B: So one of his points was the institutional of ether is a myth, right? So we debated that back and forth. And then two days later, David, two days later, ether CME announces that ether is going to be listed. They're going to have futures on ether in the same way that they have futures on bitcoin, like the only other asset besides bitcoin to be listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the world's largest derivatives market. Nothing else is even close to that. Right? Same day, this asset management company, one river Asset Management, which you talked about earlier, released press that they bought 600 million of not just bitcoin, bitcoin and ether. Right. So, love Ryan Selkis.
00:44:35.118 - 00:44:46.390, Speaker B: I feel like forwarding those links to him and telling him, buddy, just get ready. Let's have this conversation again in 2021 because it's already happening, right.
00:44:46.540 - 00:44:48.762, Speaker A: Even the conversation two weeks later would be different.
00:44:48.896 - 00:45:27.794, Speaker B: Right. So I think it's important, guys, that you catch these trends early. Crypto is very much about trying to see the future, but also catching trends and things that are happening very early before they become like consensus crypto ideas. The institutional of bitcoin, institutionalization of bitcoin is now a consensus crypto idea. Like everyone sees it, they don't yet see, I think the institutionalization of ETH and that these same funds and asset managers who bought bitcoin are about to buy ether. And I think there's alpha there. We've said it before, I think Alpha.
00:45:27.794 - 00:45:37.686, Speaker B: There's going to be massive amounts of alpha in ether, the asset, this cycle. But of course, you guys know we skew ether bullish all the time.
00:45:37.788 - 00:46:01.642, Speaker A: Just a little bit. Just a little bit. I put out a tweet. I put out a tweet forever ago that was like, this is right after microstrategy, I think, bought their first bunch of bitcoin. And I said, by the end of 2021, more companies will have ether on their balance sheets than bitcoin. And the reason why that's true is because they're going to need to purchase ether in order to transact on Ethereum. I'm not saying that they are going to put their treasury into ether.
00:46:01.642 - 00:46:30.710, Speaker A: I'm saying that companies will need ether to pay for transactions. So maybe they're not putting millions and millions of dollars, maybe they're just buying $100 worth of ether so that they can use Ethereum, the network, to do whatever they want to do on Ethereum the network. And to me, if ten times as many companies are purchasing ether to pay for access to Ethereum versus purchasing bitcoin to put on their balance sheet, and it's just a little bit of ether, that sounds like money to me. That sounds like what money is.
00:46:30.860 - 00:46:50.954, Speaker B: Absolutely. Well, we will see what happens. The next year is going to be big, David. We've got a little bit of overtime, but it was an overtime week in terms of the news, and it always is. Guys, this has been the weekly roll up from bankless. As always, this is not financial advice. Both bitcoin and Ether and Defi are risky.
00:46:50.954 - 00:46:58.170, Speaker B: You could lose what you put in. But this is the frontier. We're headed west. Thanks for joining us on another episode of bankless.
