00:00:01.210 - 00:00:34.470, Speaker A: All right, everyone, welcome to episode seven of State of the Nation. So what we do on State of the nation is we talk about what's happening in the nation. I'm talking about the bankless nation. Of course we relate it to big picture stuff and then we drop some insights and action items. This show comes out on YouTube because we like to show the visuals when we can. It's all about the visuals. So seeing David's face, seeing my face, seeing our special guest face, being able to peek inside the graphs and some of the analytics behind the things that we're talking about.
00:00:34.470 - 00:00:58.014, Speaker A: And we leave you with a list of resources in the show notes to check out. So this comes out on Tuesday. So it's Tuesday when you're watching this on YouTube, you get it earlier when you subscribe to the channel. Make sure you do that. And then we release it on the Bankless podcast stream on Wednesday so you can catch it via just audio that way. David, how are you doing today, sir?
00:00:58.212 - 00:01:27.846, Speaker B: Absolutely fantastic. The bankless nation has a lot of energy in it, and so it's been absolutely wild seeing that energy grow. And there's also just a ton of energy, not just in the bankless nation, in greater Ethereum, and even in the greater cryptosphere at large. Lots of energy to talk about. So lots of topics to get through. Like you mentioned, we did bring on a very special guest to help us dissect where some of this energy is coming from. But we will get to that.
00:01:28.028 - 00:01:51.166, Speaker A: Yes, yes. The secret intro. All right, before we do, and before I ask you the question, David. So get your answer ready. Sir, we should talk about our fantastic sponsors. I want to start by telling you a little bit about argent. So Argent is a smart contract wallet for Ethereum, for all of these Defi protocols, these money legos that I personally use, David uses it.
00:01:51.166 - 00:02:15.970, Speaker A: Everyone I know in the bankless community uses this wallet in some form or fashion because it is just drop dead simple to use. You get easy access to Aave, you get easy access to compound pool together, Kyber token sets. You can do all sorts of things with it. It's secure and easy to use. So this is actually a great entry wallet for your friends and family. This is like a venmo type experience. It's all mobile.
00:02:15.970 - 00:02:40.160, Speaker A: There's no seed phrase involved. You can even set up social recovery, which is key. It's non custodial, most importantly. So this thing is ultimately bankless. You can check it out at the link that we will include in the show notes, or you can go to state for a state of the nation special deal. So that's state. And check that out.
00:02:41.330 - 00:03:25.386, Speaker B: Ave is a borrowing and lending platform on Ethereum. Definitely responsible for a decent chunk of that energy that I was talking about. So if you want to supply collateral and earn an interest rate, Ave is the place for you. If you want to borrow assets to participate in yield, farming, liquidity mining, all of that energy, Ave is also the place for you and developers who are leading the charge. You can check out their flash loans protocol where you can borrow any amount of assets with zero collateral so long as you pay it back in the same transaction. There's a lot of potential here with money, legos. The ideas and ideation that we can go to think about how you can leverage this thing is endless.
00:03:25.386 - 00:04:00.182, Speaker B: So developers, check them out. You can go and find out all about ave@ave.com. One of my favorite features about Ave is their stable interest loans, which is such an important thing to be able to replace the existing financial system with bankless financial systems. Stable interest loans help people think in the long term. They help businesses make business decisions, and they just will help the bankless nation go faster. Ave has just been climbing the charts on DeFi pulse with value locked up in their contracts. So rip roaring success.
00:04:00.182 - 00:04:07.562, Speaker B: So tip of the hat to them for everything that has happened to their protocol in the last few months. So check them out@ave.com.
00:04:07.696 - 00:04:51.194, Speaker A: All right, David, we've got some exciting things happening just in the bankless nation that we should maybe start with. Before I ask you the question, we had Joey Krueg podcast that we released yesterday that was absolutely fire. I know I say that this all the time, but it's one of my favorite podcasts that we've done. We've got Eric Voorhees coming tomorrow, so that's going to be exceptionally interesting. Eric, of course, he came from bitcoin, but he's non tribal and he's very interested in things that are getting built in this bankless landscape. It's also mint week for the bankless badge. So bankless badge, if you've been keeping track, is something that we issue to bankless members.
00:04:51.194 - 00:05:10.586, Speaker A: Give some unique privileges and rights within the bankless ecosystem. We'll include a note there and then. David, we've got something coming next. You know, I don't want to talk about this too much. Maybe you should take over from here. What's happening next Monday?
00:05:10.698 - 00:05:10.974, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:05:11.012 - 00:05:34.242, Speaker B: So the crypto land has fertile ground, right? The bankless nation is fertile. Lots of green pastures. That's why we're so excited about this. There's lots of things that are potentially awesome things to do. And so we found one, we think, and so that's coming. A brand new wing of the bankless revolution is coming to the bankless door.
00:05:34.386 - 00:05:50.060, Speaker A: I'm super excited. Next Monday is going to be awesome. And you find out about it first because you are tuned in here on Tuesday. Next Tuesday. Make sure you catch that episode. We will show the big reveal then. David, let me ask you the question.
00:05:50.060 - 00:05:53.454, Speaker A: What is the state of the nation right now?
00:05:53.492 - 00:06:15.826, Speaker B: Sir, the state of the nation is explosive, okay? Which is kind of a dangerous word to say in the world of cryptography and smart contracts. But right now it's a controlled explosion, okay? So hopefully we can continue to control it. I kind of see it as like a slow motion explosion is a controlled explosion.
00:06:15.858 - 00:06:18.440, Speaker A: Is that a demolition? Is that it?
00:06:19.130 - 00:06:39.430, Speaker B: Hopefully not a demolition. We're paving the roads with explosives. And so that's what we're doing. Hopefully everything goes right. But ether has been in this long drawn out bear market. It's been hitting this descending line over and over and over again. And it finally broke through it just on the 22 July.
00:06:39.430 - 00:07:01.294, Speaker B: And there seems to have been just this massive pent up energy in the eth price. And it seemed to have been kicked off, like some people have been saying, by the Defi mania which got kicked off by comp. People have been saying this for a while. The comp token, new paradigm of tokens. All of a sudden there's more of them. All of a sudden there's liquidity mining. All of a sudden there's yield farming.
00:07:01.294 - 00:07:16.310, Speaker B: All of a sudden people get it. Defi tokens go wild. Our previous state of the nations were bullish and then exponential, and now they explosive. I think that these state of the nations have been pretty damn accurate with describing what is coming.
00:07:16.460 - 00:07:26.540, Speaker A: Dude, we'll get to that. Because last Tuesday, I feel like you called it, man. I feel like you called it, but we'll get to that. All right, so explosive. That's what's happening. But not explosive in a bad way.
00:07:26.990 - 00:07:41.994, Speaker B: I'm leaving on the table for what is potentially explosive. But right now, values of things are going up really fast. And so far, it's a good thing we're successfully controlling the explosion, but there's always risk. There's always risk.
00:07:42.042 - 00:08:21.146, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. And I think we'll get to the risk too. But let's talk about some of that explosive behavior again. Explosive, we think in a good way, but we brought on a special guest to tell us a little bit more about a DeFi asset that I think is super unique, something we haven't seen before. And it's called Yfi. If you've been tuned into bankless newsletter, even our podcast earlier this week, we talked about it, and we brought on Daryl Lau, who is a writer in the space. He's a researcher, and he wrote, I think, the best article that I read this week on YFi.
00:08:21.146 - 00:08:48.870, Speaker A: He's also a. I don't know if you'd call this like a core governor of the protocol. Darryl, how's it going? There he is. Great to see you. Thanks for all your work in YFI. You know what my first question is? What is this thing called? Is it yiffy? Is it giphy? Is it Wifi? Is it wifey? Like Wi fi? What are we calling this thing?
00:08:49.020 - 00:08:55.990, Speaker C: So I've personally been calling it wifey. I've got it wifey to like, three or four people now on calls.
00:08:56.650 - 00:09:00.006, Speaker A: Okay, it's wifey then for the rest of the episode. David, we're going with wifey.
00:09:00.038 - 00:09:01.580, Speaker B: All right, I'm going to have to relearn that.
00:09:03.390 - 00:09:12.618, Speaker A: Where should we start with? So, like, should we just talk about what it actually is, how it came about, like, what the products are?
00:09:12.704 - 00:09:23.440, Speaker B: Yeah, that's kind of what I struggle and why I want to bring Daryl on to help us, describe us, where is the beginning of this whole project? Where does it start at?
00:09:24.210 - 00:10:08.080, Speaker C: So I guess it started in early this year where Andre Kondre, the developer, he launched this protocol where it's a yield aggregating aggregator protocol. So basically what it does is that it chases the best yields across BYDx, compound and Ave. So let's say compound is giving like about 10% APR and Ave is doing like about 15% ApR. Obviously, you want to move your funds over to Ave for that. So what the iron did was that it automated the whole process and made it a lot easier. So you just have to put your money inside and then you'll know that you get the best yield possible at that time. So that was the whole start of the whole project, I would say.
00:10:08.080 - 00:10:30.660, Speaker C: Then it worked quite well. It worked quite well. Got about 8 million aum. And then I think March. In March, there was this whole drama about Andre having. Holding the entire admin keys for everything. So quite a few people on Twitter were attacking him, saying that he shouldn't have all this stuff.
00:10:30.660 - 00:11:06.400, Speaker C: And then he decided, and at that time, he couldn't even afford the audits because they were quite pricey. I think it was like fifty k to one hundred k at least. So he decided to decentralize the whole thing, burn the admin keys away. And then from there he stopped working on it, because at the time the whole product was complete. It had all the features you could ask for, it, automated rebalancing, it had the best yields and had the most aum across all the other projects that are doing the same thing. So, yeah. Then more recently, in about the last month, he came back from self.
00:11:06.400 - 00:11:22.520, Speaker C: He started to launch new products like Yswap, ileverage, itrade, all kinds of new Defi products, all leveraging on top of existing building money that exists today.
00:11:24.650 - 00:11:35.900, Speaker A: So Daryl Andre, some people are calling him the Satoshi of Defi. Who is this guy? What do we know about him? Why are they calling him that?
00:11:36.590 - 00:12:13.750, Speaker C: So I guess the comparisons with Satoshi Andre right now is because that Andre decided to do a completely fair launch. He didn't mine any tokens for himself, he didn't have any tokens allocated for a team or any pre sales or whatsoever. He just decided, I'm going to launch this protocol. Everyone has same rules, and that's start, basically, that's the start. If you read the post at the announcement, you would have been able to start mining immediately by providing tokens. And there was nobody else that had a head start hit from you except if they read it earlier.
00:12:17.050 - 00:12:17.366, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:12:17.388 - 00:12:57.566, Speaker B: So this is one thing that we talk a lot about on bankless, where the compound token went public in a way faster rate than what a traditional company would have gone public on a public stock market. Right? So there's one or two rounds of funding and then there's liquidity mining. And that liquidity mining is the way that instead of going public on the public stock market, it goes public on Ethereum via liquidity mining. But what Andre did with the wifey token is he just went straight public because he didn't have to worry about minting anything. He didn't have to worry about securities issues. He didn't have to worry about anything because he went straight to the liquidity mining first. And so that's why this is so incredibly elegant.
00:12:57.566 - 00:13:07.234, Speaker B: He didn't mint any himself, he just went straight for liquidity mining for instant. There was no instance of this token not ever being public. It was public first, which is absolutely insane.
00:13:07.282 - 00:13:13.734, Speaker A: And he also didn't take any for himself. How can they blame him? And he said it was valueless, if I'm recalling correctly.
00:13:13.862 - 00:13:24.540, Speaker C: Yeah. So in his blog post, he put that the fair value for the token was zero, because there was no, just don't buy it, earn it. That's what he said in his blog post.
00:13:25.650 - 00:13:57.430, Speaker A: All right, so you know what I think is an interesting thing for our audience to see is the thing that Andre called valueless. Let's take a look at the value of Daryl. So, first of all, let me just say, in all the time I've been in crypto, I've never seen a chart that looks like this. We've seen some pretty crazy charts. Right? So when you were talking about. The announcement was made, was that on a Saturday? Saturday the 18th.
00:13:58.590 - 00:14:01.286, Speaker B: Okay, so this valueless, that's when I was camping.
00:14:01.398 - 00:14:12.090, Speaker A: That's when David was camping in the mountains. He missed all of it. Yeah. Never take vacation in Defi. Is that what we're learning from?
00:14:12.160 - 00:14:15.802, Speaker B: Yeah, I would have been a richer man, but it turns, right?
00:14:15.856 - 00:14:52.522, Speaker A: So, all right, so valueless token, he said, you've got to earn it. So people started earning it. But what they did, of course, some of them, a subset of them, created a market for this. And because ethereum is a global permissionless system, they listed on exchanges like uniswap and balancer and that sort of thing. Right? So we start at a price of $34. Okay? And then, wow, look at that, $3. Okay, all right, so this is like the earliest coin gecko reports is $34, but this started at $3.
00:14:52.522 - 00:15:13.600, Speaker A: All right? And then we're traveling up here, and then look at this. This is just crazy. Crazy, right? So we top out, at least locally, one week later at $4,500. So if you're saying $3, we're talking over an 1000% gain in seven days.
00:15:14.210 - 00:15:14.960, Speaker C: Yes.
00:15:15.510 - 00:15:27.910, Speaker A: Okay. If you showed this chart to anyone outside of crypto, they'd be like, okay, that's a scam. So let me ask you, Darryl, what is the scam here? Is there a scam?
00:15:29.290 - 00:16:08.270, Speaker C: I guess basically a lot of people are talking about how the token was considered cheap comparative to the total value locked. So the whole theory is that any governance token should be able to command a valuation such that it's higher than the total value locked of protocol. Otherwise it could be easily manipulated and everything like that. But at the same time, everybody wanted to get more wifi, so they kept depositing into the protocol. So prices kept going up higher and higher. But yeah, it reached about a 400 million total value locked at the peak, around 400 and 5400 million.
00:16:08.420 - 00:16:10.570, Speaker A: So this is the value locked, where.
00:16:10.580 - 00:16:22.470, Speaker B: You talk about the total value locked. If you couldn't go back to the price chart, you said that you've never seen a crypto chart like this, and I actually think that you're wrong. I think you have seen one crypto chart like this before, and that's bitcoin.
00:16:24.810 - 00:16:26.280, Speaker A: Not in a week, though.
00:16:27.130 - 00:17:02.638, Speaker B: Not in a week. That's totally true in different time frames. Because what we're talking about is the token value started at zero because they didn't have a market for. So that's why this thing is so incredibly exceptional. Like, bitcoin also started at zero, and that's why we're calling Andre like the satoshi of ethereum, because it started in the same way where you can only earn it. There was no pre mine, and that's why this token value started at zero. And so the pricing of wifey has only come from people buying it on the secondary market and not any sort of perceived valuation.
00:17:02.734 - 00:17:19.942, Speaker A: It's a great point. I do think, obviously, the time horizon, this is super compressed. This is seven days. Bitcoin did not do that. But at the same time, bitcoin did not have permissionless markets to list on. Right. How could it list? It couldn't list anywhere.
00:17:20.086 - 00:17:22.966, Speaker B: It first got evaluated by two pizzas.
00:17:23.078 - 00:17:42.558, Speaker A: Exactly. But now we're in Defi world, and you list something like this without any founders, and immediately there's an exchange. Permissionless don't have to ask anybody, don't have to pay an exchange fee. It's there. That's probably why price discovery happens a lot quicker. What do you think about that, Darryl? Is that sort of the right analogy here?
00:17:42.724 - 00:17:53.060, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's perfectly fair. We started off with near zero valuation, and then just pop up from there from free market, valuing it so much higher than it should be.
00:17:55.270 - 00:18:14.074, Speaker A: And you were saying it sort of traveled the total value locked. Right. Which has become kind of a Metric for relative pricing between various DFI tokens. So explain this chart. Okay, we've got that. Saturday, let's see, the Saturday was the 20. What?
00:18:14.272 - 00:18:16.666, Speaker C: Let's see, 21st.
00:18:16.848 - 00:18:24.910, Speaker A: Saturday was the 18th, right? So on Friday, there was 9 million locked.
00:18:27.570 - 00:18:28.910, Speaker C: Right before the launch.
00:18:29.250 - 00:18:49.842, Speaker A: Okay. And then by Saturday, we've got 62 million locked, and then a week later, we've got 330,000,000 locked. You said this topped out near 400 million locked. What's going on here? Why all of these funds is starting to pour into the Wifi protocol.
00:18:49.986 - 00:19:40.790, Speaker C: So I guess at the very start of the Wifi mining, like when you're trading around $20 to $50, the APR you would get for it was about 500% at least. So areas of the piling in and started buying up wifey in order to get some of the returns, which made the price go up even higher and the returns going up even higher. So at one point it was about 2000% apr at the very first or second day. So when you saw the large price increase from 50 to 1000 something, it was about 1000, 202,000% aprs. So that I think if you break that number down, it's about 5% a day, if I'm not mistaken. Yeah, 5% interest per day on your stable coins.
00:19:44.250 - 00:20:07.198, Speaker B: And so this is just to distribute the Wifi token, right? This is how people got their hands on it. And so we see that massive explosive rise in assets locked in the urine finance protocol. But then it also fell off. It fell off a cliff, so it hit almost 400 million, and now it's back down to 100 million. So where did all that go?
00:20:07.364 - 00:20:31.000, Speaker C: Look, basically the whole distribution was based off ten k tokens distributed in each pool for one whole week. So there's triples? There's triples. And basically the last of the triples ended their distribution yesterday. So that's why the whole total value lot dropped quite a bit.
00:20:31.530 - 00:20:57.278, Speaker B: Okay, let's go into that a little bit more. So there were 10,000 wifey tokens in three different pools, 30,000 wifey tokens total. Yeah, 30,000 total. And these pools, you could liquidity mine these pools at different times. Right? So the first pool would run out and I would start the second pool, and then the third pool. Can you explain what these three pools are and why they came in the order that they came in?
00:20:57.444 - 00:21:45.678, Speaker C: Yeah, so the very first pool is basically that using the Yn protocol, where basically when you provide liquidity to the token, you get a share token in return. So this share token is about somewhere around a dollar stable, because it's based off of a stable coin. So then all you have to do is just stick that token into, stake that token into the governance contract, and that was it. So you mine some YP tokens based on the time that you stake inside the protocol relative to the share of your tokens. So let's say if you had 100k, for example, and the pool only had 1 million, you get 10% of all the YP tokens at that time. So that was the very first pool. Then I think the second pool launched like a few hours after that, where it was basically like a balancer pool incentive program.
00:21:45.678 - 00:22:38.794, Speaker C: So if you provided 98% die and 2% YP tokens as a liquidity provider on balancer, you would get the balancer pool token correct. Then you just take the balancer pool token to get a share of the YP tokens. So that's pool one and that's pool two. Then I think about two days after that those two pools launched, they launched the governance staking contract. So what it does is that basically they wanted to incentivize voting for voting on the platform for governance decisions like the inflation schedule, as well as the burning of staking, which I can get into later. Essentially they just wanted incentivized voting. So what they did was that you have to supply liquidity to a balancer pool of 98% of the YCRV token and 2% of YV token.
00:22:38.794 - 00:22:51.986, Speaker C: So then you get a balanced token. Again, you stick it there. So those are the three pools that were launched, and those are the three initial distributions of YP tokens for the whole 30K.
00:22:52.168 - 00:23:48.838, Speaker B: So the way I describe this in my mind is this is the tutorial of some video game, right, where your user is going through these steps to learn how to use the system. And as they progress through the tutorial, they're getting the equipment that they need in order to play the game, right? And so the first step is to provide stablecoin liquidity to the urine protocol, which gets you the Yifi token. And so that's like you got your shield, right? Like first step you got your shield, and then you go into the next pool, and then you supply the wifi token to the balancer pool. And then that's the second pool of wifi tokens that are distributed out of the 30,000, now there's 20,000. So now you got like your sword. And then if you're ready to move on to the next final step in the tutorial, which is learning how to govern the protocol, which is staking your wifi tokens to the urine governance portal. So now you have your armor, so you have your three things, now you're ready to play the game.
00:23:48.838 - 00:24:16.830, Speaker B: And then that's also how the wifey token was distributed. And so it's both like fostering a community by showing them what they need to do in order to earn, because these three things also come about as to why this thing is valuable at all. Later, after all these tokens are distributed. And it's also showing the community how to do the thing, and it's also distributing the wifey token all at once. I thought it was genius. It's like the scavenger hunt on Ethereum, where you have to go do all the things so you can get the wifey tokens.
00:24:17.890 - 00:24:37.650, Speaker C: Yeah, it was perfect when it started incentivizing users first and then started incentivizing holders. And the third pool is just genius. That incentivizes everyone to actively participate as well as reward them with all kinds of incentives, like Wifi, CRV, and balancer tokens.
00:24:39.030 - 00:25:13.970, Speaker A: So, Daryl, we were talking about the market cap, and the market cap right now of Wifey is based on a set supply of 30,000. That sounds like a fixed cap, right? So I guess maybe another bitcoin analogy. But the difference is this can be changed via governance. Can you talk, I know you've been involved from the very beginnings in Waifi governance. Can you talk about why the 30,000 cap and some debate around that and how that sort of thing is decided?
00:25:14.710 - 00:25:56.734, Speaker C: So right now, the 30K cap is just basically from the distribution that's already happened. So 30k was the max limit, and then it stopped there. So the discussion after that was, how do you want to incentivize future pools? Right now, if you were to maintain the same schedule as before, they'll be giving out more than $50 million in tokens in a week. So that's obviously not sustainable. So basically the community decided to vote for it. Like, what kind of inflation schedule makes sense? So, yeah, I wrote the first, I would say the first proper inflation schedule where I decided to use a synthetic model. So about 150% inflation rate.
00:25:56.734 - 00:26:43.440, Speaker C: And over a period of few years, we had a trailing inflation. So the problem there was that synthetic started off their inflation schedule because very high, because they wanted to attract users. And the difference between Wifi is that Wifi has already attracted all the users. We've attracted 400 in Aum without much marketing, just the hype of the returns. So it really wasn't about the attracting the users value, it was really about incentivizing users to stay on. So the community, like substrate and Delta Tiger, for example, who designed the original synthetics, inflation monetary policy, they decided to take a spin at it themselves. So they decided to work out around a 22% Apr, 22% inflation rate, which should cap the supply at 50k instead.
00:26:43.440 - 00:26:50.560, Speaker C: So that's still being discussed on with the community, but I think we're going to launch the on chain vote for that soon.
00:26:52.450 - 00:27:22.090, Speaker B: Okay, so we've been talking a lot about the wifey token and how it's gotten distributed in the different mechanisms as to how that came about, but I think we haven't yet talked about what the urine protocol actually is what does it do? And so why is everyone so incredibly excited about this protocol? What is unique about the actual system that has been developed, which of course then finds itself in the valuation of the token. But what is the yearn protocol? What does it do for its token holders?
00:27:24.350 - 00:28:01.682, Speaker C: There's basically two parts to this. Like for example, if you're a wifi holder, you get the validity and governance of the protocol. And then there's also the fact that you can get a claim to the reward to the fees distributed to the protocol. So wire has a bunch of different products launching. The first product was the iron yield aggregator. Then there's a few other products launching like the leverage stablecoin swap and leverage stablecoin yield farming protocol and a couple more upcoming. So these are all different products, all based off of existing defi protocols.
00:28:01.682 - 00:28:17.660, Speaker C: But Andre just made his own spin on things like a single asset, amm for balance you can see in Bangkok and a few other projects that are launched. So Andre is always going to add it and launch it instead. Planning to launch it.
00:28:19.710 - 00:28:23.866, Speaker A: Oh, go ahead. No, keep going. And then I want to ask you a question about Andre.
00:28:24.058 - 00:28:42.834, Speaker C: Yeah. So y fee holders, if you voted in protocol, for example, you would get a claim to the fees. And I think it was about 60k in fees alone for the first week. Wow. So that was about 10% return on a token, which was like 1000 at a time.
00:28:42.952 - 00:29:34.210, Speaker B: Okay, so there's this yield farming mania that's going on. And what the urine protocol does is that it creates this product to make it easier to yield farm, right? It makes it more formulaic, more algorithmic, so that you don't have to pull out your calculator and find out what is the best returns. You can just deposit your assets into the yearn product and it will do that for you. And then the Yifi token is this governance token, cashflow ownership token, because just like compound, just like balancer is a governance token that governs over the cash flows. And so what yifi is, is this token that is farming the farmers, right? And so it earns the fees that some of the farmers are earning the fees as well. So people like me, I didn't really participate in the yield farming thing. Kind of over my head.
00:29:34.210 - 00:30:05.386, Speaker B: I'm kind of way too busy. But now I can just buy the wifey token and I can farm the farmers, right? And so there's this three tiers of things where people are submitting, people are leveraging long ether by depositing ether into compound. They're borrowing Dai, and then they're buying more ether, and then maybe they're also sticking that to compound. And then they're earning the comp token. And then that's like tier one, right? That's just normal people. Like, my friend's doing this. This is just the basic activities on Ethereum.
00:30:05.386 - 00:30:47.210, Speaker B: And then there's people who are doing this with the intent to actually farm comp or the intent to actually farm balancer. And so they're going recursive, trying to find the best rates. They're borrowing bat, even though they don't care about bat. They're borrowing, like, tether, even though they don't care about tether because they want to farm comp. And these people are using their calculators to try and find out what the best yield is. And so that's like tier two, right? And now tier three is you just submit your assets into the yiffy protocol, the wifey protocol, and it does it for you, right? And you don't have to do your calculations, which is also fantastic, by the way, because then you don't have to pay for gas because the wifey protocol just pays for the gas for you. So you're already making more money that way as well.
00:30:47.210 - 00:30:54.798, Speaker B: And then tier four is just the wifey token itself, where you can just buy the wifey token. You don't have to worry about all these things. Did I get that right?
00:30:54.964 - 00:31:20.558, Speaker C: Yeah, that's perfectly right. Andre, when he first developed all the protocols, he decided that I'm making all this to make my life easier. Before this, everyone was manually doing, manually checking the calculators and stuff like that, changing products depending on rates. So Andre just made this protocol to make his life easier. And if you want to use it, you can use it. That's basically his entire logic at the start.
00:31:20.744 - 00:31:36.714, Speaker A: Can I kind of make, I guess, a comment here or a couple of things that kind of pop into my mind as you guys are describing this? And David, I think that was a great explanation. That was like a deeper level than I think I understood it going into this. Well done, sir. Okay.
00:31:36.832 - 00:31:37.702, Speaker B: My abilities.
00:31:37.846 - 00:32:19.898, Speaker A: Yeah. So two things here. First, I am in awe amazed that one developer from his garage, to use the analogy, was able to come up with a d five protocol incentive mechanism like this that works and grow it to 80 million in value in seven days. That is the power of open finance DFI. It blows my mind, and I think that's incredible. I think it's a real capital asset. Right? At the same time, I'm somewhat terrified in a way.
00:32:19.898 - 00:32:41.546, Speaker A: Okay? And here's why. So Andre is a fantastic developer, but he also makes no secret of he tests in prod. I'm looking at his twitter handle right now. He's like, I test in prod. That's the one thing you shouldn't do with smart contracts, right? That's the one thing. Like test in prod. No maker dow.
00:32:41.546 - 00:33:10.374, Speaker A: You formally verify that. Like, what are we doing? Okay, so he tests in prod. Okay, so that's the one thing. The other thing is what David just described. Wild genius does something that I don't necessarily love, which is it chases yields, right? So yield chasing is okay. That's an efficient market. However, to look at the real yield, what you have to do is look at risk adjusted yield.
00:33:10.374 - 00:33:59.670, Speaker A: So it's very easy to see which of these various protocols are throwing off returns and just formulate a calculation. Say, I'm going to go in that one, because it's the highest return. However, it's hard to assess risk on that side of things. So one thing I worry about a little bit on the more macro side of defi with all of these kind of lending protocols, which I love, by the way, is that we get into a habit of chasing yield, and then we're not looking at the risk of these. Some protocols have more risk than others, and we get trapped. Right. Something catastrophic happens, and it's a great unwinding, and a lot of people who weren't aware of the risks are now pissed off and kind of tainted by know.
00:33:59.670 - 00:34:11.500, Speaker A: I'm not saying Andre's responsible for any of that. I think this experiment is fantastic. I think the way he approached it is absolutely fantastic, and I think it's net super positive. But what are your thoughts on.
00:34:13.550 - 00:35:04.122, Speaker C: The first thought about testing a pro? Yeah, that's what Andre's been doing since the whole time he's been building the whole protocol. Even before in January, when he was testing out iron protocol, he decided to launch it entirely on main net instead. So he burned about $30,000 to $50,000 in development costs alone, because he wasn't familiar with how you could fork main net and launch your own instance of it. So he burned quite a bit there by just testing out everything in Mainnet. And, yeah, he always does put their disclaimer on the risk, saying that there might be risks involved. Don't deposit all your money inside, you might lose it all, which is still, I'll say, good to see some people just say, trust me, trust me, all your money. I am 100% believable but that's not true at all.
00:35:04.122 - 00:35:43.910, Speaker C: I don't trust everyone 100% of my money. Then, for example, I just bring up an example from two days ago. I think two days ago he launched this pool where you can deposit your USDC and it will supposedly get the best rates, supposedly yield bump for you across all the other protocols. And he didn't even say anything about the APR because he didn't want people to just randomly deposit money inside. But in less than an hour after he launched the protocol, there's about a million dollars inside already. Yeah. So that's the amount of crazy I would say that people are doing now to yield chase.
00:35:43.910 - 00:35:50.730, Speaker C: They are just depositing a million dollars to something that doesn't even have the documentation really written up properly yet.
00:35:50.800 - 00:36:20.600, Speaker A: And if I'm correct, I seem to recall that that thing that he launched, the new thing, actually had a fatal flaw in it that was discovered by a talented, smart contract research analyst, which on the one hand, it's awesome that the community is like self funding and self doing these sorts of audits, but on the other hand, oh my God, right? People putting a million dollars in this thing and it's not even audited, and it's just, you pushed it into prod without testing. Wow.
00:36:23.770 - 00:36:50.334, Speaker C: Yeah. We spotted the vulnerability pretty early on when he first launched it, but at that time, there was already about three hundred k, three hundred to five hundred k inside of. Inside it already. So we started warning everyone on Twitter and everything, telling him that there's a vulnerability. But at the same time, when we found the vulnerability, we already told Andre about it. So he just fixed it almost immediately. By the time the tweets were out, he already fixed it.
00:36:50.334 - 00:36:55.790, Speaker C: He just hadn't updated the UI yet, but the underlying fixed.
00:36:56.390 - 00:37:41.662, Speaker B: So there's a conversation here that I want to get into where one of the beautiful things about the wifey token and the urine system is that it needs yield farming DeFi protocols in order to work. Right. But it doesn't need any one particular defi protocol in order to work. Like compound could blow up and metastable could blow up and balancer could blow up, but there could just be the new yield farming defi protocols that come and replace them that the urine system could leverage. Right? And so urine isn't dependent on compound, compound can die and urine can stay. Like balancer can die and urine can stay. And so one of the beautiful things about it is Defi itself can come and go.
00:37:41.662 - 00:37:49.374, Speaker B: Right? We've seen different components of ethereum die off and be replaced like ether delta died and got replaced by uniswap.
00:37:49.422 - 00:37:49.586, Speaker A: Right.
00:37:49.608 - 00:38:42.020, Speaker B: And I think there's always going to be this replacement of protocols and churn over time as new innovations come. And the fantastic thing about yearn and the wifey token is that it will just be there for these new protocols and it can freely plug in or plug out of these protocols as they come and go. So to some degree, the contract risk of compound doesn't actually impact the contract risk of urine. However, there are parts of the urine system that are completely dependent and have to work and have to not blow up. Can you talk about which components of the urine system? First off, obviously it's urine itself, but I think also curve needs to work and can't go away for the wifey tokens to work. Is that right? And can you kind of just go into, what are the core dependencies of the urine system?
00:38:42.550 - 00:39:48.490, Speaker C: I guess for smart contract, for example, I don't know if you guys remember, but way back in, I think, February or March, when there was this protocol called Defos, so they basically fought compound, and there was this large vulnerability where they lost about 30, $40 million, I think. So at that time, when it happened, the IM protocol automatically stopped deposits into the system. It didn't allow for any deposits into the system because it detected, like, a large amount of withdrawals, and Andre was on top of things to check it out. But if you talk about risk adjusted returns, you would always be using the main protocols like DidX, compound, and Ave. So those are quite, I would say quite good risk risk profiles because they've been audited multiple times already. And I guess in core dependencies, iron doesn't really have much core dependencies. Curve is just one interface to interact with the protocol.
00:39:48.490 - 00:39:57.420, Speaker C: You could use the iron's main website itself to deposit and withdraw rather than using curve. Curve is just a popular interface to use.
00:40:01.150 - 00:40:25.940, Speaker B: Fantastic. This is so incredibly cool. One thing that this reminds me of is it feels like the Dow 2.0, right, where the Dow 1.0 was, this system that could pool capital together and as a distributed set of governors, could elect which protocols or which things to invest in. But at the time, it was way too early. Right.
00:40:25.940 - 00:40:38.918, Speaker B: I think people, at the time of the Dow, I wasn't in Ethereum at the time of the Dow, but people were like, okay, we're going to invest in equity in companies, and that's going to be part of the Dow, right? And that doesn't work.
00:40:39.004 - 00:40:39.206, Speaker A: Right.
00:40:39.228 - 00:41:12.660, Speaker B: And they didn't even have a chance to try it, but it was very much sku morphic. Right. It was the wrong kind of system because it was just too early on Ethereum. But it does resemble some of this early yearn components where there's this pool of funds and it's investing it into the greater ecosystem in order to get a return. And the great thing is that it's got this formula to always make the same return. And it's a little bit like central in the sense that it's a product of products rather than just being one product. Right.
00:41:12.660 - 00:41:43.894, Speaker B: It feels like a very central token on Ethereum because the rest of Ethereum can come and go like the edges of Ethereum can come and go while the yearn Dow can stay in the same place. And the reason why the urine Dow works is because there's actually things on Ethereum to do now. Like in the 2016 Dow, there was nothing to invest in on Ethereum. Now the Dow model actually works because there's on chain governance tokens, there's on chain equity capital assets. Yeah, on chain capital asset. That's the right word. I know I always use the word equity.
00:41:43.894 - 00:41:55.010, Speaker B: I know that's not right, but it's good metaphor. And so this does feel like the Dow 2.0, like a revamp of the Dow in a way that works. Is that a fair comparison, Darryl?
00:41:55.670 - 00:42:30.720, Speaker C: Yeah, I would say that a wired protocol is basically like proving how composable entire defi ecosystem is because it leverages off of everything you can see online right now. It leverages off of compound Dydx Ave and builds up so much more things that you didn't know could exist prior to Andre just writing up something and just proving that it could work. So yeah, things can come and go. Things can just die off. But I'm pretty sure that Wyon would stay just because of how composable it is and how central it is to the whole.
00:42:33.250 - 00:43:00.934, Speaker A: To Daryl, this has been fantastic. I want to maybe end with this. I'm going to share my screen one more time and take a look at the organic community. You, you guys can see my sir? Yep. These are, this is the governance board for wifey. And the activity on here has absolutely blown my mind. Look at this one.
00:43:00.934 - 00:43:06.440, Speaker A: 4.4, almost 5000 views here on the issuance policy.
00:43:06.810 - 00:43:08.950, Speaker C: That's about 100k page views.
00:43:09.310 - 00:43:10.346, Speaker A: It's crazy.
00:43:10.528 - 00:43:17.580, Speaker B: That's crazy because there's only four and a half thousand people that own the wifey token right now. That's crazy.
00:43:18.270 - 00:44:00.934, Speaker A: All of the Tokens and projects that are doing kind of vc launches, they can't get a community like this. They spend millions on sort of marketing and b to b conversations and salespeople and slick stuff. And this is really what you need to pull a product off the ground. You need a grassroots, organic community. And to get that community, you have to reward them early and have a founder story and give them a reason to participate. And that's what I think is the magic behind the wife token. The wifey token, Darryl.
00:44:00.934 - 00:44:05.290, Speaker A: Okay, so we actually put a governance proposal in here, didn't we, David? Somewhere.
00:44:05.870 - 00:44:07.338, Speaker B: Yeah, this is absolutely.
00:44:07.424 - 00:44:08.042, Speaker C: How's it going?
00:44:08.096 - 00:44:28.610, Speaker B: Fantastic. It's going really well. So the governance proposal came as a result of, like, we wanted to get Andre on the bankless podcast. And so I tweeted at him, andre come on the Bankless podcast. And he didn't respond. And then 12 hours later, he sent out a text message saying, I've gotten a lot of requests for interviews. It's up to the token holders to determine if I go on an interview or not.
00:44:28.610 - 00:44:53.930, Speaker B: I live and die by the protocol. Like, the protocol determines what I do, which I think is a fun experience. Yeah. And so I immediately rushed to the governance portal and be like, should Andre come on the bankless podcast? Yes or no? We got 114 votes. I don't really know if he's going to force or request an actual on chain vote with actual wifey tokens. The yes to no ratio is like 95% yes, 5% no.
00:44:54.000 - 00:44:55.882, Speaker A: How can I tell? Can I see it here?
00:44:56.016 - 00:44:57.130, Speaker B: You would have to vote.
00:44:58.110 - 00:45:02.106, Speaker A: Oh, I have to log in. I did. I voted yes, by the way. I logged in and voted yes because.
00:45:02.128 - 00:45:03.420, Speaker B: This is important to me.
00:45:03.790 - 00:45:04.986, Speaker A: I didn't vote no.
00:45:05.088 - 00:45:24.820, Speaker B: Yeah, if you can speak for Andre, if he does end up coming on the bankless podcast, which, according to community sentiment, sounds like he will be if that's how he listens to the token. But can you comment as to why you think Andre wants to live and die by the mean?
00:45:25.510 - 00:45:41.500, Speaker C: Essentially, the token is like his baby. I would say, like, he built the entire thing from scratch without much external help. So it really is just like his baby. He wants it to fully control his life, and then it's up to him.
00:45:44.270 - 00:46:09.058, Speaker B: Well, I hope he comes on. I think it sounds like he is, because 95% people said yes. We'll see how that works out. I hope that we, as a community, I'm a wifey token holder. I hope we find a way to reward this man, because he took no reward and he definitely deserves something. So I think that's something I'm going to propose to the community.
00:46:09.224 - 00:46:31.254, Speaker A: Do we know that, though? Let me ask you, do we know. So, Satoshi, definitely take. But if I'm Andre, just being a rational actor, I'm not saying, like, andre is a different person than I am. I would not do things the way he did because he's clearly doing this for altruistic reasons. But you don't think he liquidity mines?
00:46:31.302 - 00:46:31.750, Speaker B: He totally.
00:46:31.830 - 00:46:33.526, Speaker A: That's the question for the podcast liquidity.
00:46:33.558 - 00:46:40.090, Speaker C: Mined, he only mined about 200. I think he only mined two wifi tokens. Like, he tweeted that out.
00:46:40.160 - 00:46:40.780, Speaker A: Really?
00:46:41.310 - 00:46:44.410, Speaker C: Yeah, I only mined two tokens.
00:46:44.830 - 00:46:45.770, Speaker A: Oh, my God.
00:46:45.840 - 00:46:46.074, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:46:46.112 - 00:46:55.634, Speaker B: Darryl, you said at the beginning that he's not like this wealthy crypto investor. He's not somebody that got rich off bitcoin or ether, so he didn't have that much capital to deploy into his own system.
00:46:55.832 - 00:46:56.146, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:46:56.168 - 00:47:09.330, Speaker C: At a time when Wyatt first launched, he spent quite a lot of savings just testing out Ethereum, testing out the dive protocol and mainnet, like I said. And he couldn't even afford the audits because they were so expensive.
00:47:09.490 - 00:47:10.200, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:47:10.650 - 00:47:30.310, Speaker A: All right, well, I take it back. I need to learn more about this Andre individual. Sounds incredibly interesting. I do hope he comes on the podcast. And, yeah, I would log in and vote for a reward for Andre, certainly. I'm sure he has tremendous community goodwill at this point, so I would probably have no problem passing.
00:47:30.390 - 00:47:54.530, Speaker C: Yeah, we are actually planning for that. So one of the inflation schedules that we are passing through, about 75% tokens will go to liquidity providers, but 25% of tokens will go to, like, a multi sick or dow. And then from there, we're going to decide how much percentage we're going to stream back to Andrea, because he definitely deserves it. He definitely deserves some kind of developer funding, or that's what we're planning out in governance.
00:47:55.030 - 00:48:35.598, Speaker B: I just think that's great because obviously, I think that's great because that's fair. But also, at the same time, it shows you that you can be like the Satoshi and you can take zero tax at the system, you can take zero founders reward, and you can still get wealthy. If this does end up playing out, I hope Andre makes like a million dollars. And a million dollars is half a million dollars, $2 million, I don't know. But he's still hopefully going to make a lot of money from generating this protocol. And the value that he returned to the community because he didn't take a founder's reward will be so much more. The total value created because of his actions is like 100 x more than if there was like a vc backing this thing.
00:48:35.684 - 00:48:36.154, Speaker A: Totally.
00:48:36.202 - 00:48:39.102, Speaker C: Yeah, totally agree. Cool.
00:48:39.236 - 00:48:51.560, Speaker B: Darryl, thank you so much for coming on the bankless state of the nation. We really needed the help in handholding, learning about the urine protocol. So thank you for walking us through it, and you have been a great guest, so I appreciate it.
00:48:52.010 - 00:48:55.250, Speaker C: We're happy to help. Just reach me out on Twitter anytime.
00:48:55.410 - 00:49:02.140, Speaker B: Yeah, so if people want to find out more about you, do you want to share your Twitter handle? How can people reach out if they have questions?
00:49:02.510 - 00:49:14.650, Speaker C: Yeah, just reach out to me on Twitter, Darryl. TK on Twitter, then. I hang out a lot on the yn, unofficial discord and unofficial telegram. So yeah, just tag me there anytime.
00:49:14.810 - 00:49:20.842, Speaker B: Fantastic. We will have your Twitter handle in the show notes, sir. So thank you for your contributions.
00:49:20.906 - 00:49:22.030, Speaker A: Thanks, Daryl.
00:49:22.470 - 00:49:23.220, Speaker C: Guys.
00:49:24.390 - 00:49:36.370, Speaker A: All right. Wow, that was insightful. That was a lot. Yeah. Dave, we should talk about our sponsors again, our second set of sponsors. So why don't you start?
00:49:36.520 - 00:50:14.110, Speaker B: Yeah. So ample force is one of our fantastic bankless sponsors. Speaking of things that have been explosive lately, Ampleforth is a new monetary experiment, which I just think is totally fascinating. I can't really think of any other m zero on Ethereum. That's not ether other than Ampleforth, and that's what Ampleforth is trying to be. It's an experimental money m zero on Ethereum. The way that it works is that as price changes every 24 hours, the token, quote, unquote, rebases back closer to the value of $2,019.
00:50:14.110 - 00:50:39.334, Speaker B: But in the same sense, that kind of, in the same error as bitcoin. It's nondilutive, right. And so it will mint more or less, but into your wallet if you own them. And so there's no dilution events. So you will always own the same share of the ample currency, which is what makes it an m zero as it rebases up and down. So this thing slowly tracks a dollar over time. It never completely tracks a dollar over time.
00:50:39.334 - 00:51:04.334, Speaker B: It's not a stable coin. But if I'm interested in how it becomes a defi, denominated debt. Right. You will always be comfortable denominating debt in Ampleforth, unlike denominating debts in bitcoin, because you don't know what bitcoin's price is going to be in five to ten years. But you know, the ampleforth price is going to be about a dollar in five to ten years. So that's why it's an interesting monetary experiment. So you can check them out@ampleforth.com.
00:51:04.532 - 00:51:32.086, Speaker A: Very cool. We are in a 100 guay plus world and gas prices show no signs of going down. That's good. From one perspective, it means Ethereum is being used a lot, but it's bad if you're trying to get a trade done. Diversify solves this. Diversify is a new class of next generation L2 exchanges. It's noncustodial, so it's DFI.
00:51:32.086 - 00:51:56.766, Speaker A: It's secured by the Ethereum blockchain. They do some really cool things with roll ups to do that. It's for serious traders. The experience with diversify is similar to using something like Coinbase so they can support 9000 transactions per second. They also have a governance token that's very interesting. It's called NEC. It gives membership, voting rights, and it also gives discounts to diversify traders.
00:51:56.766 - 00:52:20.806, Speaker A: So take a look at that as well. Neck and diversify started the original liquidity mining back in 2018. They've kind of perfected their exchange and their product and really excited to see you use them and for their success and to see L2 DeFi exchanges thrive. Check them out@diversify.com. We will include a link in the show notes.
00:52:20.918 - 00:52:53.934, Speaker B: I've actually used the diversify exchange and it is as lightning fast as advertised, right? And the cool thing is every time I make a trade, I have to press a button on my ledger, which makes me feel good because it's noncustodial, right? I'm not just trusting somebody to do my order, I have to verify it first. So that just is fantastic. And like you said, it's like a centralized exchange experience. But it's also bankless, right? Because they can never do anything without your pressing of your ledger or your metamask or whatever. So it returns sovereignty to the users.
00:52:54.062 - 00:53:12.058, Speaker A: It is slick, guys. Absolutely. David. Speaking of sovereignty to the users, can we talk about topic too? Price. Let's talk about price. So what happened with price? And what price are we talking about? Our show notes just say talk about price.
00:53:12.144 - 00:53:13.018, Speaker B: Talk about price.
00:53:13.104 - 00:53:13.354, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:53:13.392 - 00:53:45.930, Speaker B: So how can we not, right? So ether is at $320 right now when the last state of the nation it was at, what was it at? 235 245, right? Ryan, you made this joke. We were talking about how DFI tokens have absolutely mooned. And one of our topics of the last state of the nation was like the ratio of the aggregate market cap of all tokens on Ethereum. All ERC 20 tokens on Ethereum to ether, like the total market cap of all tokens surpassed the total market cap of ether.
00:53:46.110 - 00:53:47.542, Speaker A: And then you said something.
00:53:47.676 - 00:54:17.440, Speaker B: You said, security concerns we're talking about. So ether protects Ethereum, but now the things that it protects are higher than the walls that are protecting it. So it's a risk we were talking about. Does this invalidate the fat protocol thesis? Is ether going to track this thing? Is this insecure? And what I said was that, sure, we can talk about the invalidation of the fat protocol thesis, but that just goes out the door the moment ether moons to $300.
00:54:17.970 - 00:54:20.570, Speaker A: I've got a chart up. I show the chart.
00:54:20.650 - 00:54:32.894, Speaker B: Yeah, go for it, Ryan. You asked me like, okay, so when does that happen? And I go tomorrow. And I was three days ahead of schedule. I was three days ahead of schedule. Yeah. Okay, so I was not purposely doing that. I was accidentally.
00:54:32.894 - 00:54:34.420, Speaker B: Right. Let it be clear.
00:54:34.870 - 00:54:45.880, Speaker A: I don't think you should be modest, David. I mean, all of your predictions on state of the nation, to my knowledge, have come true so far, so why be modest about it? You just call the plays and then it happens.
00:54:46.250 - 00:54:47.778, Speaker B: This is so far, so good.
00:54:47.884 - 00:55:17.154, Speaker A: Price on Tuesday when we published was 236. And then maybe you're moving markets. Maybe that's what you're doing. Because then a week later, 322, and you totally called it even close to the number, right? I think you said from 230 to like 300 or something like that on the last day of the nation. So well done, sir. I look forward to reading the prospectus for your new hedge fund that you are initiating. It could be exciting, but, yeah, look, it's been a good week.
00:55:17.154 - 00:56:10.690, Speaker A: I mean, we've been talking about this for a while on bankless in general. So what we saw, if we just kind of zoom out. I still have the chart here. Right. Let's look at the three month. So, yield farming is only two months old right now at this point, right? And that's been sort of a new template, a new catalyst for the entire defi ecosystem that started around may, right? And then what we saw from May until June was Defi tokens absolutely take off and basically leave ether in the dust. So people were saying things like, well, does that mean ether is just used for gas? That it's not correlated to the success of DFI? We could have DFI worth a trillion dollars, and little ether is worth 16 billion, still hovering at 200 per eth.
00:56:10.690 - 00:56:53.490, Speaker A: And then that was the conversation for the past two months. And now we're starting to see a bit of a rise that we've been talking about for a while. I do think that the bankless thesis is pretty bullish on ETH as a monetary asset, as the reserve currency for this entire deFi experiment, as the lowest layer in the protocol sync thesis, the economic bandwidth for this space. If you've never heard those terms before, you got to check out bankless material and take a look at the guide and read up on those terms. Listen to those terms, because it's kind of a core part of the thesis so far. And it was good to see. I had a lot of fun with this one, David.
00:56:53.490 - 00:57:17.240, Speaker A: Every time the price went up $10, I just tweeted out, like, the price at this is hilarious, because I do think it's hilarious. Even the price now, to me, is not commensurate with the value that ether is bringing, the growth of DFI, or even the value relative to bitcoin. I think it's all underpriced. I just kept doing it.
00:57:19.310 - 00:57:20.540, Speaker B: Every $10.
00:57:21.470 - 00:57:23.786, Speaker A: And you could just dig into this.
00:57:23.968 - 00:57:24.842, Speaker C: Look at this.
00:57:24.976 - 00:57:29.802, Speaker B: Oh, man, here's 280. This. I missed this.
00:57:29.856 - 00:57:43.946, Speaker A: You missed this. Oh, it's fun, man. I was just like. And people said I had a bot. I didn't have a bot. I was actually looking at things. It started with this, though, and that's kind of the core tenant, when you dig enough staking.
00:57:43.946 - 00:57:58.280, Speaker A: Plus, defi is going to put more demand on Eth than icos ever did. This is about the scarcity thesis of Eth, right? And I mean, you wrote a fantastic article about that, but that I think there's some market validation that maybe this is coming.
00:58:01.290 - 00:58:02.342, Speaker C: The def.
00:58:02.476 - 00:58:24.478, Speaker B: Absolutely. The DeFi narrative caused this price. And I think Eric and Anthony on the Ethub podcast called this a long time ago, where they said that the comp token may just kick off a bull market. And I think that is exactly what happened. And it wasn't necessarily the comp token itself. It's not just about comp token, although that comp token is a core component of this. It's the token model.
00:58:24.478 - 00:59:07.766, Speaker B: Right. The governance token model that governs over the cash flows of these protocols are valuable tokens. And like we've talked about with Chris Berniski, like we talked about with Dan Elitzer, we can evaluate these things on the ways that we've always evaluated capital assets throughout time. Now, DeFi has gotten to that point, so that's bullish. And then the liquidity mining of people really striving to provide work to access these tokens created their own mania. And then now this mania has just topped off with the yearn protocol, which is still nascent. Right? But it's all coalesced into this Defi mania, this growth of defi, which is just growth of finance, this new finance, this bankless finance.
00:59:07.766 - 00:59:36.500, Speaker B: And finally, it's being reflected in the ether price. Like ether price is always going to be a lagging indicator of what's going on on ethereum. And now, after the Defi tokens have mooned, now it's ether's turn. And more importantly, actually, I'm going to share my screen. More importantly, we have had this massive, drawn out bear market where the ether price has just been suppressed, suppressed, suppressed over time. I'm not in the right time frame. Let me zoom out.
00:59:36.500 - 01:00:02.422, Speaker B: I am not a charter, so hold this with a grain of salt. But other people that I listen to and know are charters, and they have all been looking at this line. Maybe their line is placed differently, but they've all been looking at this line, and this line is also present in bitcoin. Right? And so here is the top of 2017, two years ago. And over time, this line has just been bullying the ether price up until the 20 20 July.
01:00:02.486 - 01:00:03.606, Speaker A: Wow, look at that.
01:00:03.728 - 01:00:14.110, Speaker B: Boom. We ripped right through it. Right? And so I'm not a charter, I'm not a savant, I'm not a guru, but we're quote unquote, out of the bear market. Bear market is over. Bear market.
01:00:14.180 - 01:00:15.134, Speaker A: Wow. You're calling that.
01:00:15.172 - 01:00:42.278, Speaker B: Yeah, bear market. Bear market's dead. It's really a matter of a. Does that mean the bull market started? And if yes, does that mean it started today, or is this going to be a long, drawn out? Because if you go back to the bitcoin price coming from 2015 to 2017, that was a two year crescendo before it really started to get bubbly. Right. So what's that like? I don't know, but bear market is dead.
01:00:42.374 - 01:01:11.266, Speaker A: I mean, we've talked about this being 2016, right? Which was basically how bitcoin and ether were sort of viewed then. It was a long, grueling bear market in 2016. Coming out of that, there were signs of life. It wasn't a full on bull market yet, but there were definitely signs of life. This does feel. Again, we keep talking about, like, 2016. Tell you another thing, maybe it's early, actually 2017, because you asked last time, last year of the nation, have I gotten any text yet? Yes.
01:01:11.266 - 01:01:12.850, Speaker A: The answer this time is yes.
01:01:12.920 - 01:01:13.860, Speaker B: Getting text.
01:01:14.550 - 01:01:31.214, Speaker A: I got two, right? Yeah. So somebody's like, hey, let's go for beers. My portfolio is. And he gave details of his portfolio, like, 2% XRP, like 5% EOS. And 40% ETH and another 30% bitcoin. Something like that. He's like, how would you realize?
01:01:31.282 - 01:01:33.418, Speaker B: Pretty good as far as normies go, right?
01:01:33.504 - 01:01:48.430, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm not bad. There's that. I also got a text from a friend. This is really cool. He's like, I want to buy this thing. It's an ERC 20 token. How do I do it? Right? It was popping.
01:01:48.430 - 01:02:25.130, Speaker A: He's like, how do I do it? He's Coinbase, who talked about it before. And actually, within, like, 30 minutes, he figured out how to move his ETH from Coinbase to metamask and complete a transaction on uniswap and buy a token. And he bought it at a time right before it moon. So now it's like, prices up double. Since he is defi for life, I don't think he's going back. So the learning curve, people say it's steep, but it's a lot less steep than it was.
01:02:25.280 - 01:02:25.834, Speaker C: I don't know.
01:02:25.872 - 01:03:02.390, Speaker A: Two years ago, you could figure out how to use, how to secure your private keys and figure it out in a couple of hours. And here's the thing. It's like that entire time when we were talking to Daryl about Wi Fi, and you were like, you went on a camping trip and you missed it. All of the people who don't know how to use these tools right now, they don't even know this conversation is happening. You have to be here. You have to have been putting in the time to level up to actually understand these assets in order to get exposure to an opportunity. Like yfi.
01:03:02.390 - 01:03:40.658, Speaker A: If you weren't here, if you weren't playing the game, you didn't get that opportunity. That is why we talk about leveling up. It's not like a step gain from week to week or month to month. It's like you're investing this time, and then suddenly something happens, some catalyst, and you were there at the right time, and you had the right information, leveled up, skills. You had the skills. You could sort the bs from the actual assets, and then you made the move. You only had that ability because you had put in the time to level up.
01:03:40.658 - 01:03:56.470, Speaker A: Over the past months, I'm sure Daryl, I mean, he's been in the space for a while doing that with absolutely no return. And then suddenly he's like, this thing could be big. And I know it's big, and I'm using it, and then, bam. He knew how to liquidity, and he was there. He was there. Yeah.
01:03:56.540 - 01:04:23.486, Speaker B: And this just leads into the conversation of user self sovereignty. Right. Like, you are learning the skills as an investment into the. The value of your own person is your greatest asset. Right. And learning these skills, learning how to operate in the decentralized finance long, it's a long bet that DeFi is actually real and actually going to be a thing. But we're assuming everyone listening to this has already taken that bet, right? Like, we all believe that's real.
01:04:23.486 - 01:04:43.478, Speaker B: And so now it's just a matter of honing your skills, learning how to think critically, learning how to evaluate defi risk, contract risk, and communicate that, and then also take the opportunity when it presents itself. And this is going to come because you have invested your time and energy into the space in order to figure this out. Right?
01:04:43.644 - 01:04:56.780, Speaker A: Totally. That's the reward. On the other side of that, we talk about that a lot. Okay, so, last thing, David. We've gone on for a while. These shows just keep getting longer, man. Should we start closing down? How long are we in here?
01:04:57.150 - 01:05:00.042, Speaker B: Yeah, we are into this for about an hour.
01:05:00.176 - 01:05:33.650, Speaker A: Okay. All right, so let's kind of wrap it up. One thing I just want to say, and this can be a show notes thing to take a look at, is just to reemphasize the risk that we're talking about here. Some of the least risky assets you can purchase in crypto are probably going to be like bitcoin and ether, like, core protocol type things that have established records. But even those are incredibly risky. Right. When we talk about something like wifi or yield farming, you start to get into a place where you're compounding risk.
01:05:33.650 - 01:05:45.802, Speaker A: Not just risk on ether. Yeah. You're just stacking. You're money legoing your risk. Right. And people need to be aware of that when they go into these systems. It is the wild west out there.
01:05:45.802 - 01:06:04.446, Speaker A: We do say you can lose everything. Very important that people are aware that something could go wrong. Andre, one developer could have a bug in his code that causes the price of Wi Fi to collapse or the thousands of dollars you put in liquidity to just evaporate into nothing. It's risky.
01:06:04.558 - 01:06:07.230, Speaker B: Explode because the state of the nation. Explosive.
01:06:07.310 - 01:06:07.650, Speaker C: Yes.
01:06:07.720 - 01:06:10.402, Speaker B: This is why we chose this, you.
01:06:10.456 - 01:06:36.346, Speaker A: Know, full circle here. There is some good news, though. I would say is there are ways to hedge against that risk. Nexus is one. We're actually putting out a tactic on Nexus today about staking with Nexus, and it basically insures against one type of risk. There are several, but their one type of risk is smart contract risk. I saw with Nexus, they are insuring about 0.4%
01:06:36.346 - 01:07:08.198, Speaker A: of all of the value locked in DFI. So still super small. I mean, this is millions of dollars right now, but all of the value locked in DFI, only 0.4% of it, is insured by Nexus. And of course, things could also happen to Nexus. Ideally, we'd have multiple providers of insurance in this space. All that to say before you get in the stacking protocol, smart contract risk, and start chasing yields, know what you're getting into.
01:07:08.198 - 01:07:39.002, Speaker A: If the reward is high enough. Okay, maybe it makes sense. But, I mean, Vitalik said this, right? If you're making a 3% earnings on something like DAi, then you're basically assuming that DAi doesn't have a cataclysmic event for decades, basically. And is that a good return for the amount of risk that you're taking? So question that insurance can help. And take a look at Nexus and the tactic that we're putting out about that. Anything else you want to say on that, David?
01:07:39.066 - 01:08:13.242, Speaker B: Yeah. To some degree, DeFi is speculation and gambling. To some degree, it's also finance, and it's also like this new paradigm that we're all hoping comes about. But it's speculation that it comes about, it's risk that it comes about, and to some degree, that it's also gambling that it comes about. And the first rule about playing poker and the first rule about gambling is that you always position yourself so that if you get wiped out, you can still play. Like, if you lose the hand, you can still play. And so I think that is a rule of thumb that everyone should follow.
01:08:13.242 - 01:08:34.894, Speaker B: Like, if you buy a bunch of yiffy tokens, wifey tokens, are you investing your entire net worth into it? And then if something goes wrong, are you effed, or are you responsibly investing an amount that you can lose? That leaves you able to stay at the table, like, always position yourself so you can stay at the table, or otherwise it'll just be bad. It'll be bad.
01:08:34.932 - 01:08:47.490, Speaker A: David's totally right on, man. And there are multiple tables. You've got your traditional world table, then you've got your entering crypto table, and then within crypto, there are levels of risk. Right? So eth is less risky than iffy.
01:08:47.650 - 01:09:09.974, Speaker B: Yeah, one more comment on that. Right. So some of these listeners, maybe this is their first cycle. I have not yet completed a cycle. I came in in June of 2017. And so I feel like, on the horizon, as we go full circle into these crypto cycles, I feel like I can see on horizon where I started in the last cycle. Some people haven't yet gone a full cycle.
01:09:09.974 - 01:09:52.646, Speaker B: And let it be known that when prices go up and you check your blockfolio and you're twice as rich as the day before, your mindset changes, your psychology changes, and you need to account for that and be cognizant of that. Who you are changes in a bull market and your risk appetite will change. And you need to watch yourself as that changes. And so be responsible, be introspective, be mindful, and make sure that as the bull market goes on, that you don't succumb to the mania and you stay rational. It's not easy. It's not easy when you see your portfolio double in a day, you think you're a genius, but also you're not. So you have to be mindful, you have to be cognizant.
01:09:52.646 - 01:09:58.890, Speaker B: You have to be aware of your own psychology. Know who you are, know your limits, be responsible, because you have to stay at the table.
01:09:59.230 - 01:10:18.094, Speaker A: Well said, sir. We need to do a tactic sometime on dollar cost averaging out. I think people could benefit from that. As the bull market continues, this has been state of the nation. Explosive is the word. That's the state of the nation today, guys. This is episode seven again.
01:10:18.094 - 01:10:29.714, Speaker A: It comes out Tuesdays on YouTube. Make sure you subscribe. You get this and other videos. Last thing I'll say about risk, of course, eth is risky. Bitcoin is risky. All of the tokens we talk about are risky.
01:10:29.762 - 01:10:31.590, Speaker B: Wifey is super risky.
01:10:32.010 - 01:10:46.260, Speaker A: Yes, ultra risky. Don't put in more than you can afford to lose. But we're headed west and we're excited that you are on the journey with us. State of the nation signing off.
