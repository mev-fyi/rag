00:00:08.450 - 00:00:40.378, Speaker A: This episode of Bankless is brought to you by Ave. Ave is a great place to borrow and lend digital assets. On Ethereum, you can deposit your preferred asset of choice in order to borrow a different asset, which is particularly good for yield farming if you want to deposit your ether instead of selling it. So you can borrow Dai or USDC to yield farm with. One of the cool things about Ave is that it offers you two various interest rates, a variable one that changes as the market does, or a stable one that gets fixed in for the long term. Check them out@aave.com we're also brought to you by monolith.
00:00:40.378 - 00:01:27.838, Speaker A: Monolith is a really important tool to help you go bankless, but still let you buy your groceries at your local grocery store. Monolith will ship you a very sexy Visa card that you can use wherever Visa is accepted, which is basically the whole world. But instead of using the dollars in your bank account, it uses the Dai in your monolith smart contract wallet. Check them out at Monolith XYZ and get your monolith visa card today. You know that random string of characters that you have to pass to your friends and family to show them what your Ethereum address is and they just don't get it. Unstoppable domains fixes that problem. With unstoppable domains, you get a human readable name so you can tell them to instead of paying you at zero x 1743 Q four, you can just tell them hey, pay me at Davidhoffman XYZ or Davidhoffman Z-I-L.
00:01:27.838 - 00:02:06.586, Speaker A: You don't have to ever worry about sending the wrong address because it's human readable. And this works for not just Ethereum, but for bitcoin, for litecoin, for any blockchain that works with unstoppable domains. You can even tell bitcoiners to send you bitcoin to Davidhoffman eth. They even allow you to set up uncensorable websites that are always accessible, even if the chinese nation state doesn't want them to be. Check them out@unstoppabledomains.com if you're still using blockfolio to check up on your portfolio, you're behind the times. Check out Zapper fi because Zapper looks directly on chain to tell you exactly how much of which assets you own.
00:02:06.586 - 00:02:31.470, Speaker A: Not only does it know which assets you own, but it also knows where they are. So if you are providing liquidity to Uniswap or you've deposited them to compound or to Aave, Zapper knows and it will give you a comprehensive report of your entire defi portfolio. Not only that, but you can even make transactions through Zapper that allow you to invest in various defi protocols like balancer or Uniswap or curve. Check them out at Zapper fi.
00:02:31.550 - 00:02:50.826, Speaker B: All right, guys. Welcome, everyone. This is a new segment that we're doing on bankless. I think it's needed. It's called Alphaleak. So here we're talking about something big that's just happened, usually a product launch or a token launch or something we think the nation needs to know about immediately. David, what's our alpha leak today?
00:02:51.008 - 00:03:10.430, Speaker A: The Uniswap token is out. Uniswap, the beloved protocol of everyone super dense in the protocol sync thesis, just distributed their uni token and it has one of the most insane distribution events, I think, ever. I think it's just going to sweep the floor with this one. It's pretty cool.
00:03:10.580 - 00:03:29.910, Speaker B: Wow. Okay, well, we're going to talk about that. So here's the format. We're going to try to keep these relatively short. But first we're going to tell you what it is. Then we're going to tell you how to use it, how to get it, what that looks like. Then we've got some conversation that the community has been having around this token, and then we'll close it up.
00:03:29.910 - 00:03:39.022, Speaker B: So, David, I'm going to share my screen and let's talk about the Uniswap launch first. So where did this come from? What time was it actually launched?
00:03:39.106 - 00:04:10.962, Speaker A: Yeah, this was launched around dinner time, my time. So like 07:00 p.m. 08:00 p.m. We saw somebody leaked the token minting event and like 15 minutes later, one moment. And like 15 minutes later, everyone had found out that the Uniswap token was here and that it's something that you can go and claim. So they had this planned and ready to go and that was pretty cool. And so it came out really fast.
00:04:10.962 - 00:04:20.514, Speaker A: They had this thing just pre planned, a brand new website, brand new analytics infrastructure. So pretty sweeping. Solid launch by the Uniswap team.
00:04:20.632 - 00:04:44.634, Speaker B: Yeah, they did it under the COVID of night. So it was like 08:00 p.m. At least on the east coast. And that's where I think many of the Uniswap team are located in New York City. So this is it, right? So this is the introducing Uni Token post. And I guess let's dig into the details. So what are we looking at here? Of course, first they're talking about their stats.
00:04:44.634 - 00:04:57.430, Speaker B: Uniswap bankless listeners don't need to be reminded that Uniswap does a ton of value, a ton of volume. In fact, recently they've been beating Coinbase in terms of total volume.
00:04:57.610 - 00:05:02.126, Speaker A: Nice little pat on the back from Uniswap here, right before they start talking about the value of their token.
00:05:02.238 - 00:05:21.942, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. All right, so let's get into the goods. This is the allocation. So first we've got 60% going to Uniswap community members. That's primarily the liquidity providers and users of the Uniswap platforms. We'll talk about that. And then we've got 21% to team members and future employees.
00:05:21.942 - 00:05:45.442, Speaker B: Right. We've got 17% to investors. There was a recent round, like two months ago, some accredited investors, VC firms got in. So not completely fair launch, although I suppose 60% of this maybe is fair launch, with some reserved for the team as well. What's your take on this distribution in general, David? How would you rate it?
00:05:45.496 - 00:06:23.694, Speaker A: Yeah, so I've heard people with some grumblings about a decently high weighting towards investors and VC firms and then also towards the team. So you add those together, you roughly get 40% towards the team members and investors that have invested in the protocol. And sure, that could be a little bit high on the high end of things, but at the same time, the awesome distribution that happened with the 60% on the other side of things more than makes up for it. And also, again, we need to remind ourselves that vcs aren't bad. Vcs did the job of bootstrapping Uniswap into being what it is.
00:06:23.732 - 00:06:24.078, Speaker C: Right?
00:06:24.164 - 00:06:42.174, Speaker A: They deserve it. I know this yield farming phenomenon is trying to be like this anti vc phenomenon, but I think we all saw what happened with sushi swap and also yams, where yams contract blew up and that sucked. And sushi swap, the anonymous founders, they absconded with the funds. That sucked.
00:06:42.222 - 00:06:42.434, Speaker C: Right.
00:06:42.472 - 00:06:51.558, Speaker A: And that doesn't happen with vcs. And so 40% to vcs who had the skin in the game before Uniswap could even figure out that they were going to tokenize. I'm okay with it.
00:06:51.644 - 00:07:19.722, Speaker B: Yeah. And it is 20% to the vcs and 20% to the team. So the team is getting a good cut of this for building a fantastic product and that is vested as well. So they don't get it right away. It comes over time. Now, there's kind of a four year vesting period here, but when you sort of run the math, it looks a bit more like two years, which we can get into. But let's talk about, I think, the most exciting part, and that's that 60%, the community drops.
00:07:19.722 - 00:07:31.810, Speaker B: So who's that going to? Maybe. Let's break that down. The thing I am most excited about is probably this one right here. David, can you talk about what they're doing with the 400 uni per address?
00:07:31.960 - 00:07:42.914, Speaker A: Yeah. So if you have ever used the Uniswap protocol, even once before September 1, you are able to claim 400 uni tokens from that wallet.
00:07:42.962 - 00:07:43.270, Speaker C: Right.
00:07:43.340 - 00:08:04.922, Speaker B: Okay, wait, so that is worth repeating. So, guys, if you have used Uniswap, if you've ever done a trade on Uniswap. Right, from an Ethereum address. From an Ethereum wallet, if you did one of our tactics that we published in December, telling you to go try out Uniswap, for instance, you did that before September 1, you get 400 uni tokens. All you have to do is claim them.
00:08:04.976 - 00:08:05.590, Speaker C: Yes.
00:08:05.760 - 00:08:06.906, Speaker A: And it's per wallet.
00:08:06.938 - 00:08:07.134, Speaker C: Right.
00:08:07.172 - 00:08:11.514, Speaker A: And so I personally have a couple of wallets, and so I get to claim them from both wallets.
00:08:11.562 - 00:08:11.774, Speaker C: Right.
00:08:11.812 - 00:08:41.542, Speaker A: That's separate. And so that's pretty cool. It's 400 per wallet. If I had my way, I would have kind of weighted it towards people that were heavy uniswap traders versus light Uniswap traders. There are a lot of new entrants into the DFI world that just made their first transaction on Ethereum, like, a couple of weeks ago, and they got 400. And other people who have been trading on Uniswap once per day for the past two years also got 400. I wish they kind of weighted it for the amount of trades, but again, I'm not going to complain.
00:08:41.542 - 00:08:50.518, Speaker A: 400 uni tokens, which are trading at $3 right now. That's one. $200 to anyone that's ever used the Uniswap protocol ever, right?
00:08:50.624 - 00:09:24.802, Speaker B: Yeah, it's airdrop money. This is the Uniswap stimulus package. All you had to do was use Uniswap early. It's like, imagine if you were one of the first users of Facebook and they awarded you retrospectively, you created a Facebook profile back in 2003 or whatever, and they rewarded you Facebook stock for that. That's what's just happened. All you had to do was be a user, be early, be on the bankless journey, essentially, and front run the opportunity. You get one $200 not bad per wallet.
00:09:24.866 - 00:10:04.066, Speaker A: So on coin gecko on DFI market, cap, on DFi pulse. Now, Uniswap has, like, this $2 billion valuation, which we're going to talk about whether that valuation is justified or not. $2 billion valuation that is now in the hands of 48,000 people. The Uniswap token isn't even a day old, it's like 12 hours old. And 48,000 people have made transactions on Ethereum claiming their Uniswap tokens. So the equity of Uniswap, the governance token of Uniswap, is so incredibly distributed so quickly to a sizable chunk of people with a sizable chunk of value. It's one of the coolest distribution events of all time.
00:10:04.168 - 00:10:14.386, Speaker B: You should compare that to another really cool distribution event, which was the wifi token. Wifi which we've talked about. So how many wifi token holders do we have versus Uniswap?
00:10:14.418 - 00:11:00.198, Speaker A: Yeah, wifi token holders is roughly like 11,000, right? 11,000 people have either farmed or purchased wifi from the Uniswap or from the wifey farming way back when. And now it's basically only from Uniswap or from some centralized exchange. Uniswap again is like at five times that distribution. And what's so great about it is because they have the two years of history of people using it and people organically shilling Uniswap for being this protocol that's deep inside the protocol sync thesis. So getting the community support, and so as a product, it has been used by so many. And so as a team trying to distribute and decentralize ownership of the protocol, it went from centralized to maximally decentralized, the most decentralized thing on top of Ethereum like that.
00:11:00.364 - 00:11:40.574, Speaker B: Basically anything you do on the bankless journey, once you get to level one and you start getting your coins off of an exchange into an ETH address, and you get to kind of level two, it begins with Uniswap, right? That's one of the first things that someone who's new to DFI and new to bankless actually does is trade something on Uniswap. So what that means is the distribution is basically everybody in DFI. Everybody in DFI pretty much got something from this event, got at least one, $200. If you had multiple accounts, then you got more than that. So that's crazy. But they also did something cool with. So they didn't reward for trading volume, but they did reward heavily.
00:11:40.574 - 00:11:43.282, Speaker B: Liquidity providers, can you talk about that?
00:11:43.336 - 00:12:02.582, Speaker A: Yeah, liquidity providers got paid. And so 10% of all Uniswap tokens went to people that traded, 5% went to liquidity providers. And so that's half the total amount of Uniswap went to liquidity providers. But the number of liquidity providers versus the number of traders is like one 100th.
00:12:02.646 - 00:12:03.260, Speaker C: Right.
00:12:04.030 - 00:12:16.222, Speaker A: It's actually very much more concentrated. And so if you have been, I know an individual who calls himself a Uniswap maximalist, and he loves just providing liquidity. And he's been providing liquidity since like, day one.
00:12:16.276 - 00:12:16.494, Speaker C: Right.
00:12:16.532 - 00:12:50.998, Speaker A: And he got paid with Uniswap. Right? And especially, it weighted early liquidity providers. It weighted them stronger than later liquidity providers. So if you have been a steward of the protocol, if you have been providing your value to Uniswap for a long time, you got more Uniswap tokens, right? Which is good. That's what we want. Like, if you've used the service a lot and you are incentivized to take care of the protocol, you deserve more tokens. Right? Lps, people that provided liquidity to Uniswap have gotten a bunch of uniswap tokens.
00:12:51.094 - 00:13:09.902, Speaker B: And these lps, the few I know that are in kind of the top ten list, these are not hedge funds, these are not bankers, these are not exchanges. These are people who have a decent amount of capital, but are on the bankless journey, on the Defi journey. These are like Defi ogs, right?
00:13:10.036 - 00:13:11.966, Speaker A: These are people that are being their own.
00:13:12.148 - 00:13:19.490, Speaker B: Exactly, exactly. So that's super exciting. All right, so also stockholders got a little something. Should have bought some socks, David.
00:13:20.230 - 00:13:26.510, Speaker A: I think the sock token price went through the moon as well, because people wanted to redeem socks for Uniswap tokens.
00:13:26.670 - 00:13:29.094, Speaker B: And the socks was just their NFT game.
00:13:29.132 - 00:13:29.478, Speaker C: Right.
00:13:29.564 - 00:13:57.514, Speaker B: They were kind of playing around with. But it's kind of like our baps idea, which is it's redeemable for physical socks. Anyway, they got a little something from this. All right, so let's talk about the community treasury. For the first four years, it seemed like the supply was something. Total supply of like 1 billion, I believe. But after those four years, there's an ongoing inflation, is that correct? Like a 2% inflation.
00:13:57.562 - 00:14:03.146, Speaker A: 2%, what I recall, which is great, because that disincentivizes passive uni token holders.
00:14:03.178 - 00:14:03.374, Speaker C: Right?
00:14:03.412 - 00:14:41.594, Speaker A: And so with your money and with your value, the bitcoiner narrative is that the inflation just devalues people's savings, and that's bad for money. But with governance tokens, what it does is it devalues passive people that aren't partaking in governance, right? And so if you don't have a say in uniswap, then you get diluted versus people that have been actively maintaining the protocol. So in this particular instance, I'm a big fan of it. And it's only 2% a year, and it's actually like hard coded 2% a year. It's not the Federal Reserve's 2% wink wink a year. When it's actually like 10% a year. It's hard coded 2% a year.
00:14:41.792 - 00:15:15.026, Speaker B: Okay. All right, so some people have already gotten their unit tokens for things they've done in the past retrospectively just being users of the protocol. You get 400 tokens, or if you're a liquidity provider, you get more, and that's time weighted. But there's also another opportunity that goes live today. So I believe that's today at least it's September 18 UTC time. So depending on your time zone, it could be today or tomorrow, but there's the opportunity to do some liquidity mining and pick up some more uni tokens. And here are the pools that they have opted.
00:15:15.026 - 00:15:21.994, Speaker B: Eth, usdt, eth, USDC, eth, dai, eth, wbTC. Boy, that's a lot of ETH in there.
00:15:22.032 - 00:15:23.082, Speaker A: A lot of eth you love.
00:15:23.136 - 00:15:24.278, Speaker B: Why so much ETH?
00:15:24.374 - 00:15:27.430, Speaker A: Because Uniswap protocol is an ETH maxi. Clearly.
00:15:27.590 - 00:15:44.682, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, I mean, they are trying to be the most decentralized trading protocol, and for that you need the most decentralized, credibly neutral form of money. So that is ETH. So what happens when this opens up? I guess we can kind of show there's a countdown interface.
00:15:44.746 - 00:15:45.166, Speaker C: Right.
00:15:45.268 - 00:15:56.050, Speaker A: I think we're like nine or 8 hours away. Better. 7 hours, 42 minutes from the time of recording. Liquidity mining in Uniswap is going to start in 7 hours.
00:15:56.120 - 00:15:56.498, Speaker C: Right.
00:15:56.584 - 00:16:15.002, Speaker A: And according to the post, these first four pools are the pools that you can liquidity mine in. And so relatively limited, relatively small, and that is going to be the way it is for 30 days. And then after 30 days, the Uniswap token is then the governance tool to vote in further pools to liquidity mine with.
00:16:15.056 - 00:16:15.274, Speaker C: Right.
00:16:15.312 - 00:16:46.850, Speaker A: And so I think that the most obvious next one is the uni token eth pair. Right, eth uni. And because people want to provide liquidity to Uniswap, because they're bulls on Uniswap. Right, on the uni token. And so I think that's going to be the next one that comes and that's going to just bootstrap the liquidity of the uni token, further pulling away the uni token away from centralized exchanges into the Uniswap protocol, which we know and love, and then it just kind of goes from there. But yeah, Uniswap yield farming is here.
00:16:47.000 - 00:17:17.342, Speaker B: All right, so if I want to yield farm in 7 hours or so, then I have to, of course, deposit in here. And when you're depositing Uniswap, you have to provide both sides of the pair. So for this EtH die pair, I have to have 50% ETH, 50% die. I deposit it in there. There are some other things there that we don't have time to get into right now, such as impermanent loss that you have to be aware of, but that's how you do it. And there's a certain rate of uni tokens that you'll receive. We'll get into more of that later.
00:17:17.342 - 00:17:24.798, Speaker B: David, is there anything high level else we should talk about? You touched on governance, of course. Anything else we should talk about here?
00:17:24.884 - 00:17:49.814, Speaker A: Yeah, I think since we just talked about yield farming and how to do it, you should be aware that the gas prices on Ethereum are the highest they've ever been, because 50,000 people are trying to claim their Uniswap tokens. And remember, Uniswap tokens, the minimum you got was one $200 ish worth of Uniswap tokens. So it makes sense, it's rational to pay a lot of money to claim that $1,200. And so a lot of people are doing that.
00:17:49.852 - 00:17:50.054, Speaker C: Right.
00:17:50.092 - 00:17:55.980, Speaker A: And so gas prices right now are just through the roof. So make sure you pay attention to that if you try and do this.
00:17:56.350 - 00:18:20.206, Speaker B: By the way, I like this gasnow.org site, too. Yeah, it seems to be updated a bit better than the ETH gas station website, which I also use. So you can see this is the highest gas prices I've seen since yesterday, but it's still pretty high. So be cautious of that. Be careful of that. But a lot of this is from the Uniswap activity.
00:18:20.318 - 00:18:23.246, Speaker A: While we say that, should we go ahead and claim our Uniswap tokens?
00:18:23.278 - 00:18:48.090, Speaker B: Ryan, that's what I was, man. So, okay, so I'm going to tee this up for you, David. So basically, if you've ever used Uniswap, as we were saying, if you've ever done a trade with Uniswap in any way, connected an Ethereum wallet to Uniswap in any way, shape or form, you have the ability to go claim 400 uni tokens more if you provided liquidity as well. And David, you've got an address. You're going to show us how to do that, right?
00:18:48.160 - 00:18:48.986, Speaker A: Yes, absolutely.
00:18:49.088 - 00:18:49.354, Speaker C: Okay.
00:18:49.392 - 00:19:17.214, Speaker A: I'm going to take back screen sharing from you, Ryan. So we have provided liquidity for the Bap token, right? Bankless has. And then while I was trying to do that, we made some trades in order to have the right amount of ETH to supply that. And so we have 400 eth. Plus, it looks like we got 333 more eth or more uni, excuse me, from supplying those bap tokens. And so I'm on the uniswap site. We'll have that link in the show notes.
00:19:17.214 - 00:19:18.086, Speaker A: I think there might be.
00:19:18.108 - 00:19:21.266, Speaker B: This looks like a special uniswap site. Like ipfs.
00:19:21.378 - 00:19:32.122, Speaker A: Yeah, this is the site I've been using because yesterday the site went down because 50,000 people tried to claim their Uniswap token. So this is the website I've been using. I think the other one is back up. Let me check, let me check.
00:19:32.176 - 00:19:41.434, Speaker B: And it's just a user interface, right? Yeah, but the ipfs link is super cool because that's actually not using centralized servers to do it.
00:19:41.472 - 00:19:42.474, Speaker C: Exactly. Yeah. Okay.
00:19:42.512 - 00:19:49.854, Speaker A: But the other website is backup. Okay, so claim uni. I'm in the wrong.
00:19:49.892 - 00:19:50.094, Speaker C: Okay.
00:19:50.132 - 00:20:05.778, Speaker A: So I have the wallet loaded up here, so I'm just going to use this one. But that other website also works. Okay, so here's my 733 uni that the website knows that I have. And so I got 333 for providing liquidity and 400 for trading once.
00:20:05.944 - 00:20:06.894, Speaker B: Good for you, David.
00:20:06.942 - 00:20:07.714, Speaker A: Yeah, nice job.
00:20:07.752 - 00:20:08.294, Speaker B: Good job, man.
00:20:08.332 - 00:20:15.000, Speaker A: Nice job. Worked hard for this. I'm going to boost this gas fee because we're on a YouTube video.
00:20:15.450 - 00:20:17.510, Speaker B: Wow. You are generous to the miners, friend.
00:20:17.580 - 00:20:19.282, Speaker A: Yeah, indeed.
00:20:19.346 - 00:20:24.362, Speaker B: 50K, that's painful. Yeah, but I mean, that's only. How much? That's like $25.
00:20:24.416 - 00:20:30.770, Speaker A: $25 to claim. What are we getting? We're getting like $2,000 worth of Uniswap tokens to the bankless treasury.
00:20:30.870 - 00:20:32.874, Speaker B: There you go. Bankless treasury.
00:20:32.922 - 00:20:34.670, Speaker A: We'll go watch this transaction.
00:20:36.690 - 00:20:39.754, Speaker B: Our stimulus fund from Uniswap. Faster than Congress.
00:20:39.882 - 00:20:44.266, Speaker A: There it is. We just claimed 733 uniswap tokens.
00:20:44.378 - 00:20:45.114, Speaker B: Crazy dude.
00:20:45.162 - 00:20:46.958, Speaker A: All right, virtual, how you are doing, Brian?
00:20:47.134 - 00:21:07.586, Speaker B: Yeah, nice job. We earned it. All right, so let's talk about what people should do with that. Of course, none of this is financial advice, right. But I think there's a legitimate question as to whether the token is overvalued or undervalued or how you highly valued.
00:21:07.618 - 00:21:08.422, Speaker A: That's for sure.
00:21:08.556 - 00:21:38.158, Speaker B: Yeah. So how you even value this thing? You're going to have to give me a screen share back, David. I think so. I thought Andrew Kang had a good take here. And it's something basically know valuation method that we've been using on bankless as well, which is sort of a price to sales or price to earnings valuation method. So first of all, Uniswap has really popped. I think it was like $0.50
00:21:38.158 - 00:21:40.194, Speaker B: when it first launched. Right.
00:21:40.392 - 00:21:50.262, Speaker A: The price was so incredibly volatile, it went up to $10 and then down to. It's been hovering around $3. And then to get Ryan press command plus, like one or two times.
00:21:50.316 - 00:22:13.974, Speaker B: Okay, so to get the fully diluted market cap of that. Right, so that means after four years, when that 1 billion is all released, what you do is you take that 1 billion fully diluted market cap and you multiply that by the price. Nice, easy, round number. So if it's trading at $1, that means the fully diluted market cap of uni tokens is $1 billion. Right. It's trading at what right now, David?
00:22:14.022 - 00:22:17.770, Speaker A: About $2.02 and a half to $3 is where it's been fluctuating.
00:22:17.930 - 00:23:01.034, Speaker B: Okay, so uniswap spending existence for a while, getting more volume than coinbase right now, and it's being valued at $3 billion. The question is, is that expensive? Is that cheap? What should the price of a Uni token be? Again, this is not financial advice, but what we want to do is provide you frameworks for how to look at this. One framework we think is super valuable is the price to earnings ratio of the uni token. So Andrew King makes the point, you got to know when to sell your crop and when to hold or buy more. And he makes the point that he thinks Uni tokens are actually valued fairly, undervalued, a PE ratio of 41. It's a price to earnings ratio. Right.
00:23:01.034 - 00:23:16.110, Speaker B: So Netflix is 80. Price to earnings ratio of Netflix stock is 80 right now or so. Price to earnings ratio of Amazon stocks, like 160. Right now, do you think uni will grow faster than Amazon and Netflix? Well, it certainly has in the last two years.
00:23:16.180 - 00:23:16.846, Speaker C: Absolutely. Yeah.
00:23:16.868 - 00:23:18.670, Speaker A: The trajectory is in its favor.
00:23:18.820 - 00:23:46.330, Speaker B: Yes. Okay, so price to earnings ratio. You can also take a look on token terminal, which is one of my favorite websites for seeing this kind of thing. And they call it price to sales ratio, which is a bit more accurate. But if I sort by price to sales ratio, I can see the valuation of Uniswap right here. They use kind of, I think a 30 day type metric. So it's a little bit different than the number Andrew came up with.
00:23:46.400 - 00:23:48.154, Speaker A: We're running on limited data here, but.
00:23:48.192 - 00:24:02.798, Speaker B: Yeah, running on limited data. But the point is, when you use kind of a similar apples to apples metric, it is the lowest, second lowest price to earnings ratio capital asset out there.
00:24:02.884 - 00:24:11.742, Speaker A: I think when people see the $3 billion valuation from the Uniswap token, they get a little thicker shock, because nothing in DFI is that highly valuated.
00:24:11.806 - 00:24:12.420, Speaker C: Right?
00:24:13.030 - 00:24:25.618, Speaker A: One to one and 1.5 billions for the AA protocols that we all know and love. But people have to remember, this is Uniswap. This is Uniswap. This is like the beloved DFI protocol.
00:24:25.794 - 00:24:26.966, Speaker B: And look at this.
00:24:27.148 - 00:24:38.458, Speaker A: Annualized gross volume is doing more volume than Coinbase. Like, what do you think Coinbase's valuation is? Coinbase's valuation is at least larger than 10 billion. I think it's between 15 and $25 billion.
00:24:38.544 - 00:24:38.794, Speaker B: Yes.
00:24:38.832 - 00:24:42.438, Speaker A: And Coinbase is beating them on volume. And it's a protocol.
00:24:42.534 - 00:24:46.794, Speaker B: Right. And Coinbase has 1200 employees. Uniswap has eleven employees.
00:24:46.842 - 00:24:47.054, Speaker C: Right.
00:24:47.092 - 00:24:52.878, Speaker B: Seems like there might be some efficiency delta there, too. One of those is more efficient than the other.
00:24:52.964 - 00:24:54.174, Speaker A: That's exactly right.
00:24:54.292 - 00:25:01.646, Speaker B: And another way to look at it is this. This is something we've shown before, but this is crypto fees that various protocols generate.
00:25:01.678 - 00:25:03.486, Speaker A: It has more fees than bitcoin.
00:25:03.678 - 00:25:08.142, Speaker B: Yes. Like a decent amount. More.
00:25:08.296 - 00:25:08.774, Speaker A: Decent amount.
00:25:08.812 - 00:25:17.480, Speaker B: More seven day average fees over than bitcoin. Right. That's pretty crazy.
00:25:18.090 - 00:25:25.786, Speaker A: Again, not financial advice, but I think that I'm personally going to be sitting on my hands, not really looking at that sell button.
00:25:25.968 - 00:25:28.534, Speaker B: Did we just make a decision with the bankless treasury?
00:25:28.582 - 00:25:30.246, Speaker A: I vote to not sell the token.
00:25:30.438 - 00:25:35.518, Speaker B: I concur. Okay, so we're keeping 733 uni tokens for a while, anyway.
00:25:35.604 - 00:25:36.560, Speaker C: For a while.
00:25:36.930 - 00:26:16.762, Speaker B: All right, sounds good. Okay, so what else should we talk about here? Can we talk about the whether? Does it make sense? Another question I think people probably have is does it make sense to actually liquidity mine? So that's basically the four initial pools that come out in 7 hours that we were talking about. Eth, dai, eth, USDC, USDT. Eth wrapped bitcoin. Right. So other monies on top of Ethereum. So coingecko, which has been doing just a bang up job on defi stuff lately, they released a yield farming dashboard, which I think is pretty good.
00:26:16.762 - 00:26:21.280, Speaker B: And what you can do is you can switch to degen mode. Check this out. David, have you seen this?
00:26:22.050 - 00:26:26.190, Speaker A: Oh, my God. Why is that not default?
00:26:26.930 - 00:26:57.426, Speaker B: Yeah, it's not default. You have to opt into dgen mode. All right, so I haven't fully explored what the difference is, by the way, but. Okay, so what we have here is basically when you're in dgen mode, some returns calculation. I haven't fully investigated the returns calculation, kind of what all the variable parameters are, but you can kind of get a flavor of the various estimates for uniswap. Right. Weth, USDT or ETh.
00:26:57.426 - 00:27:22.222, Speaker B: USDT. ETH, USDC, ETH dai, and kind of calculate the returns based on the current price of uniswap this way. So that's certainly one way to look at it. Another way that I like to look at it is because we have this issue when you deposit two sides to the liquidity pool of impermanent loss. David, do you have a quick explanation of what impermanent loss is? Yeah, sure.
00:27:22.276 - 00:27:30.734, Speaker A: So when you deposit ETH and dai to the same pool, what you're allowing people to do is you're giving them the freedom to purchase one of your bags, to sell them your other bag.
00:27:30.782 - 00:27:30.994, Speaker C: Right.
00:27:31.032 - 00:27:42.562, Speaker A: And so if you deposit both, you're claiming that you're okay with owning any balance of both of these things, and as one or the other appreciates and depreciates, you should be okay with that adjustment.
00:27:42.626 - 00:27:42.854, Speaker C: Right.
00:27:42.892 - 00:27:50.930, Speaker A: And so the question as to whether you should provide liquidity or not is kind of a function of how okay are you with both assets.
00:27:51.010 - 00:27:51.254, Speaker C: Right.
00:27:51.292 - 00:28:02.042, Speaker A: And so I think that's why the first pool in uniswap that really got a ton of liquidity was the ether MKR pool. And it's because those two tokens kind of tracked each other in us dollar price.
00:28:02.096 - 00:28:02.314, Speaker C: Right.
00:28:02.352 - 00:28:22.260, Speaker A: And so there wasn't much impermanent loss to be had there. What would make me nervous about the EtH dai pair is that if ether doubles in price, you will be owning less ether than if you had just hold it and you'll be owning a lot more dai. And so you will be making money, but you'll be making less money than if you had just been holding ether. Right.
00:28:23.510 - 00:28:40.546, Speaker B: If you're an ETH bull, you kind of don't want to do the EtH dai pair, because if ETH goes up in price, you end up losing some of the dai that you've contributed in exchanging that and selling it early for the dai. That's essentially what the liquidity pool does. Is it kind of exchanges that ETH for dai under the covers.
00:28:40.578 - 00:28:56.926, Speaker A: Right, yeah, exactly. And so that's why out of these four pools. The ethwbtc pool might be better. If you think that prices are going to go up, then the ethwbtc pool might be for you. Because BTC and ether are much more correlated with each other than ether is to us dollars.
00:28:57.028 - 00:28:57.294, Speaker C: Right.
00:28:57.332 - 00:29:16.866, Speaker A: And so if you are really looking to farm this uni token and you don't know, but you also are bullish on ether and probably therefore also bitcoin, the ETH WBTC pool might make the most sense. And I'm going to be willing to bet that that is the pool that experiences the largest increase in liquidity because of that logic.
00:29:16.978 - 00:29:43.242, Speaker B: Okay. And then the other, I guess, variable to consider when you're thinking about yield farming, something like this is you get more. If the fewer people who contribute to the pool, essentially the better for you. Right. So what you just said is if you think a lot of liquidity is going to come to the WBTC pool, then that could also dilute the amount that you receive.
00:29:43.306 - 00:29:43.582, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:29:43.636 - 00:30:01.166, Speaker B: So you have to monitor that too. Right. And ultimately it could start super high right here. Like, you see these yearly numbers, that's not going to last because as liquidity gets injected in those amounts, per share of the liquidity pool will decrease.
00:30:01.278 - 00:30:08.310, Speaker A: Yeah. There's not more uniswap that's issued. It's the same amount of Uniswap tokens that are issued spread across larger and larger people.
00:30:08.460 - 00:30:42.400, Speaker B: Exactly. All right. So one thing that Jacob, friend of ours, coinmetrics, said is he actually argued that, hey, this is awesome, but there's also bit of a dark side to the uni airdrop. He said that whales hugely profited. He said that some scams who are lping their own coin, like maybe a hex comes to mind, hugely profited. And then he said, look, the four year vesting schedule for sort of the team and the insiders, it's more like a two year vesting schedule. Right.
00:30:42.400 - 00:30:50.850, Speaker B: And then he said, claim on fees unclear, though expected. I don't know what that means. But what do you think of some of these takes, David, about kind of the dark side of.
00:30:50.920 - 00:31:17.514, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So I want to commend Uniswap for trying to have a very anti political attempt at distributing. And so if we wanted to kind of fix some of these problems that Jacob outlined, like whales got a lot of tokens and some pools probably shouldn't have gotten to, we start to be making decisions as to who deserves what.
00:31:17.632 - 00:31:18.202, Speaker C: Right?
00:31:18.336 - 00:31:20.006, Speaker A: And these are subjective decisions.
00:31:20.038 - 00:31:20.186, Speaker C: Right.
00:31:20.208 - 00:31:26.958, Speaker A: These are political choices. And so maybe you say whales got too much. But they're the ones that provided the value.
00:31:27.044 - 00:31:27.294, Speaker C: Right.
00:31:27.332 - 00:31:51.320, Speaker A: And then if we also say hex shouldn't have gotten it, well, then you're making a decision that hex is a scam, which I don't really think too many people are going to fight you on, but it's still a decision at the end of the day. And so to some degree, just doing what they did and just blanket airdropping uniswap equally and relatively, trying to have a politically reduced distribution, I think makes sense.
00:31:51.770 - 00:32:19.502, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree. It's tough to kind of rate these different distributions. But if you think about bitcoin had kind of an immaculate conception, right. On the spectrum, I'd probably rate that an a relative to all other distributions in crypto. ETH had a pretty decent one as kind of an immaculate ICO where anyone could enter totally permissionless, not VC funded, no accredited investor rules. Right. So maybe that's an a too.
00:32:19.502 - 00:32:24.334, Speaker B: Maybe it's a b plus, something like that. Yam had a decent one, to be honest.
00:32:24.372 - 00:32:25.118, Speaker A: It was great.
00:32:25.284 - 00:32:29.166, Speaker B: That was the first kind of like vegetable style farm.
00:32:29.198 - 00:32:31.666, Speaker A: I wouldn't give it an a, but I would give it a b plus.
00:32:31.848 - 00:32:42.118, Speaker B: I feel like it's at least a b, maybe. And then wifey had a fantastic distribution, too, in rewarding some of their early users. Maybe that's an a minus, a b as well.
00:32:42.204 - 00:32:43.782, Speaker A: I give it a b plus.
00:32:43.916 - 00:32:45.334, Speaker B: This ranks right up there.
00:32:45.452 - 00:32:46.614, Speaker A: This ranks up there.
00:32:46.732 - 00:33:09.902, Speaker B: Not perfect. Right. But I don't think it's A-C-I feel like some of the redeeming qualities of it are 60% does go to the community. Right. And a whole bunch of lps who were early adopters of this did really well on it. And basically everyone who was using DFI prior to September 1, 2020, got something from it.
00:33:09.956 - 00:33:10.222, Speaker C: Right.
00:33:10.276 - 00:33:12.206, Speaker B: And a lot of those folks are going to hold.
00:33:12.308 - 00:33:12.718, Speaker C: Right.
00:33:12.804 - 00:33:15.650, Speaker B: Not bad. I can't think of another protocol that's done that.
00:33:15.720 - 00:33:16.050, Speaker C: Right.
00:33:16.120 - 00:33:23.934, Speaker A: And the best thing about this is the retroactive distribution is one of the last remaining bastions of fair launching.
00:33:23.982 - 00:33:24.242, Speaker C: Right.
00:33:24.296 - 00:33:29.974, Speaker A: Because it turns out that we've been farming Uniswap since 2018 and we didn't even know it.
00:33:30.012 - 00:33:30.454, Speaker C: Right.
00:33:30.572 - 00:33:33.446, Speaker A: Turns out we've been yield farming for years, according to you.
00:33:33.468 - 00:33:46.522, Speaker B: Well, it turns out there was no such thing as impermanent loss. Yeah. Because if you deposited into the pool and you're a big liquidity provider, you were making money every month and didn't know it, it was just paid in the future to you.
00:33:46.576 - 00:33:46.794, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:33:46.832 - 00:33:55.134, Speaker A: If you supplied ether die liquidity when ether was $80 and then ether mooned and you lost a bunch of ether, you just made a bunch of uniswap to make up for that.
00:33:55.172 - 00:33:55.470, Speaker C: Right?
00:33:55.540 - 00:34:15.678, Speaker A: Yeah. Some whales took a hit and they are being compensated for that. And at the end of the day, one person that made 10,000 trades on Uniswap versus one person that made one trade on Uniswap. Getting the same amount of uniswap tokens is kind of like, maybe that doesn't feel right. But also distribution, distribution, distribution.
00:34:15.854 - 00:34:47.070, Speaker B: So the new thing I felt like was two year retroactive distribution. Right. But you can already see that people are thinking about that and already starting to front run it. So sue from three arrows Capital tweeted something out like, what's the last Defi darling exchange? Not to issue a token DYDX. Right? And they haven't issued a token yet, but similar style to Uniswap, it's got some vcs involved. So should we front run that? Should we start trading DYDX right now.
00:34:47.140 - 00:34:54.922, Speaker A: Just in case supply, liquidity, leverage long ether, forex up, forex down. At the same time, let's just go to DYDX.
00:34:54.986 - 00:34:55.310, Speaker C: Right.
00:34:55.380 - 00:35:19.910, Speaker B: That's why as soon as a new distribution comes out, you get to use it once, one time. Exactly. And then it starts to get gamed and it starts to degrade over time, which is why we're starting to see all the crappy farms that we've been seeing lately. But David, anything else we should say on this Alpha leak edition? The Uniswap edition, anything else we need to tell listeners?
00:35:20.570 - 00:35:27.862, Speaker A: I don't know. I think that was it. I think we covered everything. I'm sure there was something that we could talk about, but we'll probably talk about it again on this date of the nation.
00:35:27.926 - 00:35:28.202, Speaker C: Right.
00:35:28.256 - 00:35:41.690, Speaker A: And so whatever happens between now and next Tuesday with Uniswap, because this isn't even 24 hours news, this is twelve hour old news. So we're going to watch this and then we will update everyone on this state of the nation on Tuesday.
00:35:41.850 - 00:36:08.454, Speaker B: All right, we will include some links to resources, as usual, action items for you guys today. You can, of course, go claim your Uniswap tokens. If there's an ETH address where you've interacted with Uniswap, make sure you go do that. You can also think about whether it makes sense to start providing liquidity to Uniswap. Of course, none of this is risk free. All of it has impermanent loss risk, which you should understand as well as smart contract risk. So keep that in mind.
00:36:08.454 - 00:36:20.622, Speaker B: This has been the Alpha leak edition, a new show that David and I are creating when exciting news comes out and it's available to you on YouTube, so make sure you hit that subscribe button as well. That's it for me.
00:36:20.796 - 00:36:21.278, Speaker C: Cool.
00:36:21.364 - 00:36:22.060, Speaker A: And we're done here.
