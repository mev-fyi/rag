00:00:00.170 - 00:00:04.560, Speaker A: We really see, like, private debt all moving on chain over the next five to ten years.
00:00:07.490 - 00:00:11.726, Speaker B: Welcome, bankless nation, to this edition of Meet the nation. It's been a while since I've done.
00:00:11.748 - 00:00:15.086, Speaker C: A meet the nation. And so for those that have not seen a meet the nation before, this.
00:00:15.108 - 00:00:19.514, Speaker B: Is where I pull in a project and introduce them to the bankless nation.
00:00:19.642 - 00:00:52.746, Speaker C: What is the 101, the TLDR, the high level overview of what this project is. And to today we're talking with Blake and Michael from Goldfinch protocol. Goldfinch is all about under collateralized loans. Defi, as we know, is really, really good at over collateralized loans. But kind of the whole point about a loan is to borrow money because you don't have money, but you want money. And so it's actually over collateralized loans are kind of like this weird thing that is, for some reason really, really common in DeFi. It's under collateralized loans that is really just the loans that we know of today.
00:00:52.746 - 00:01:53.882, Speaker C: And Goldfinch is developing the system to help businesses access capital when they don't already have capital, which kind of crazy, right? Like weird how that works. And so they have this very interesting kind of like, organically balancing mechanism using really just basic primitives in DeFi, along with just traditional business development and outreach. And they have definitely penetrated pretty well into emerging markets. Michael tells a number of stories about success, stories about how Goldfinch was able to put capital in the places of the world that wouldn't previously had access to capital. So this is the conversation of banking the unbanked or providing money to businesses that are definitely credit worthy businesses, but just by proxy of where they live in the world, they just don't have access to finance. Now that we have DeFi spanning the whole entire globe, we have systems like Goldfinch that can put capital in corners of the world that definitely need it and deserve it, but otherwise wouldn't have gotten it. So I really enjoyed this conversation.
00:01:53.946 - 00:01:55.454, Speaker B: We're going to go and dive right.
00:01:55.492 - 00:02:06.866, Speaker C: Into all about Goldfinch and what it is and how you can participate and get higher yields than you otherwise would have if you choose to go into the Goldfinch protocol. And so if you are doing your.
00:02:06.888 - 00:02:08.894, Speaker B: Due diligence, definitely start with this episode.
00:02:08.942 - 00:02:10.870, Speaker C: And then learn more at their website.
00:02:10.940 - 00:02:11.714, Speaker B: Or in their discord.
00:02:11.762 - 00:02:13.234, Speaker C: The link should be in the show notes.
00:02:13.362 - 00:02:15.606, Speaker B: So without any further ado other than.
00:02:15.628 - 00:02:23.322, Speaker C: This one, let's go ahead and get right into all the conversations about Goldfinch. Right after we talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible.
00:02:23.456 - 00:02:55.502, Speaker B: The Brave browser is the user first browser for the web three Internet with over 50 million monthly active users. Control your digital footprint with built in privacy and ad blocking. Inside the brave browser, you'll find the Brave wallet, the first secure crypto wallet built natively inside of a web three crypto browser. Web three is freedom from big tech and Wall street, more control and better privacy. But there's a weak point in web three, your crypto wallet. The bravewall is different. Bravewall is built natively inside the brave browser, no extension required, which gives the brave wallet an extra level of security versus other wallets.
00:02:55.502 - 00:03:38.382, Speaker B: With the brave wallet, you can buy, store, send and swap your crypto assets, and it can even manage your nfts and connect to other wallets and defi apps, all from the security of the best privacy browser on the market. Whether you're new to crypto or a seasoned pro, it's time to switch to the brave wallet. Download Brave@Brave.com slash bankless and click the wallet icon to get started. When you shop for plane tickets, you probably use kayak, Expedia or Google to compare ticket prices. So why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto? When you make your trades, you want to make sure you're getting the best possible price on your trade, and that's why you should be using matcha. Matcha has smart order routing that splits your trade across all the various liquidity sources in Ethereum and is also operational on polygon, avalanche, binance, smart chain and other chains.
00:03:38.382 - 00:04:28.110, Speaker B: Trading on matcha is super easy because it pools the liquidity for me in a single easy to use platform and allows me to make limit on chain orders so you can set and forget your defi trades and they will go through automatically while you're away. So when you're making a trade, head over to matcha XYZ slash bankless and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets. Bankless is proud to be sponsored by Uniswap Uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure. Instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans, Uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on Ethereum that lets you trade any token at the current market price. No human counterparties or centralized intermediaries, just autonomous code on ethereum. Input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy. The Uniswap grants program is accepting applications for grants.
00:04:28.110 - 00:04:43.362, Speaker B: Do you have something of value that you think you want to contribute to the Uniswap ecosystem? No matter how big or small your idea is, you can apply for a unique grant@uniswapgrants.org and help steer Uniswap in the direction that you think it should go. Thank you, Uniswap, for sponsoring bankless.
00:04:43.506 - 00:04:48.134, Speaker C: All right, guys, I'm here with Michael and Blake of Goldfinch. Michael and Blake, welcome to the show.
00:04:48.332 - 00:04:50.230, Speaker A: How's it going, dude? Thanks so much for having us.
00:04:50.300 - 00:04:50.920, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:04:51.370 - 00:04:58.138, Speaker C: So first off, how did you guys meet, since you guys are both co founders? And then how did the inspiration for Goldfinch come about?
00:04:58.224 - 00:05:24.926, Speaker A: Yeah, so Mike and I actually have known each other for a really long time, like, almost 17 years at this point. We were randomly paired together as freshman year roommates in college. And since then, we've worked on just, like, a bunch of various kind of side projects and stuff together. Everything from a music collaboration website to machine learning models to predict tennis matches to a new music notation system. We also both worked at Coinbase for a while together, and Goldfinch.
00:05:25.118 - 00:06:21.720, Speaker D: And I think the thing that really inspired Goldfinch is one of the things that brought us to Coinbase originally, was just being super excited about what we feel like crypto can do in the world around expanding access to capital and empowering financial inclusion. And I know those are kind of like buzwords in the crypto space, but we really believe it. And we loved Coinbase's mission of an open financial system. And then while we were there, we were feeling like a lot of the sort of infrastructural pieces had fallen into place and feeling almost antsy with the industry that we could be moving further and doing things that help people and getting the true sort of promise of crypto, of changing financial systems as they are today. We wanted to make that happen. So that was sort of the thing that really drove us to start goldfinch, which is to be this bridge between all of the capital that is sitting in crypto looking to be put to work with borrowers out in the world who've been traditionally underserved but are looking to grow their businesses and actually can use that.
00:06:22.410 - 00:06:38.426, Speaker C: And, Michael, talk a little bit about the infrastructure pieces that you saw falling into place that really allowed you to perhaps see something greater than what was being built. What were the things that were the flags that you're like, ooh, look at all these dots that I could love to connect. Tell me about that.
00:06:38.528 - 00:06:51.918, Speaker D: Yeah, there were, like, three big ones. The first was that there was so much more capital in crypto looking to earn yield. So I remember when we were at Coinbase, what was it that Coinbase was launching? It was like staking one of the.
00:06:51.924 - 00:06:57.650, Speaker A: Staking also USDC yield. I actually worked on that team at Coinbase while we were there.
00:06:57.720 - 00:07:47.906, Speaker D: Yeah. And I remember when it launched and just like, how many people were all about the. This was before compound launched comp token and the whole yield farming thing took off in 2020. And just seeing how many people were using the staking product, just realizing, oh, there's like a lot of sort of pent up demand for earning yield just by seeing how many people were using that. The second big piece is we needed stablecoins to exist. And so USDC and tether, I mean, we use USDC with Goldfinch, but it was just starting to get to a critical amount of actual capital and stablecoins that we could use with borrowers who aren't sort of crypto native because a company in Nigeria or Indonesia, they're not going to take an ethereum denominated loan, but they do take loans in USD terms today. So we needed stablecoins to be able to have this whole thing work.
00:07:47.906 - 00:08:24.218, Speaker D: And then the third piece was exchanges expanding around the world. So that made it easier for these businesses to receive USDC and then exchange it for the local currency. So, like, one example is finance had launched in the beginning of 2020 in Nigeria specifically, which then allowed us to work with our first customer, Quickcheck in Nigeria. And that was what enabled them to actually use crypto. So we needed these exchanges to be popping up in all of these markets around the world. We needed stablecoins and we needed all the yield desire among existing capital and crypto.
00:08:24.394 - 00:08:37.200, Speaker C: And so how did all these moving parts come to become the vision behind Goldfinch? And at this point, we should just dive right into what Goldfinch actually is. So what is Goldfinch? And how do all these moving parts come to be inside of it?
00:08:37.510 - 00:09:14.554, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think we can kind of get to both of those questions at once. So if you look at a lot of the yield products that were in crypto at the time and still really the most popular ones, it's all this over collateralized lending protocols, things like compound and Ave, right. And they have seen a bunch of success, but they serve actually a fairly narrow use case. Right. Are either using as kind of margin trading accounts, or you're looking to take out some gains on highly appreciated assets while still maintaining some exposure to the upside of the asset, which is great. And that works to the tune of billions of dollars for those protocols. And we were like, okay, so that's over collateralized.
00:09:14.554 - 00:09:51.410, Speaker A: But most people in the world, when they want to take out a loan, it's because they don't already have the money. So we wanted to figure out how we could build a system that was under collateralized. And so that's really the heart of Goldfinch, is building this under collateralized lending protocol on Ethereum. And initially we were told by a bunch of people, well, who's going to be the borrow side? Right? Who's actually going to be borrowing that? Could it be individuals? Well, we're like, probably not. The gas costs are too high, and it's really hard to underwrite individuals. And then we thought maybe it's like miners or other traders or something like that. But we talked with a lot of those entities, and none of them really felt like they were the right fit or really had the serious borrow demand.
00:09:51.410 - 00:10:34.246, Speaker A: And then I've had kind of like a long standing interest in microfinance and realized you should probably be reaching out to companies who have not been served as well in the financial system. And so we started reaching out to a lot of fintech companies. We talked to dozens of these companies before starting Goldfinch to get a feel for is there a real customer here? Is there real demand? And after talking to them, we heard the same story kind of over and over again, which is that there's just not enough capital going into these markets. And despite the fact that there's a lot of great businesses here, people have years of track record lending out money, and they're able to generate really pretty sizable returns on that capital. And they're willing to try something new because they spend, like, half their time trying to raise capital for these businesses. So they're willing to do weird things like use metamask. And they were like, crypto? Like, sure, whatever.
00:10:34.246 - 00:10:44.918, Speaker A: I need this to grow my business. This is really important to me. And so once we had those conversations, we felt like, okay, now we know there's both sides of the market here, and we felt confident to really go start goldfinch.
00:10:45.094 - 00:11:24.726, Speaker C: So let's unpack the over collateralization versus under collateralization, just to make sure we nail down for the listeners the nuances here. Crypto, as it is today, is really, really good at over collateralized loans. And that's because of the nature of an anonymous Ethereum address. Right? Like an ethereum address doesn't know your identity, doesn't know who you are. Therefore, if you want a loan, how do you ensure to the protocol that you're going to repay that loan? You ensure that you're going to repay that loan by over collateralization, which is what you guys are kind of saying. It's like, well, that's kind of like antithetical to the whole concept of a loan because most people that need loans don't already have the money. That's kind of the whole point.
00:11:24.726 - 00:11:57.490, Speaker C: So then we get into the topic of under collateralized loans. But that gets really, really hard in Defi because we don't have identity. And identity is key for how we get loans from the bank and tradfi, right? Like, if you don't repay, they can take you to court and they will take you to court. There is no Defi court, there is no Ethereum court. That's kind of the whole thing we're trying to get away from. So how have you guys solved this identity issue? Are you guys like a KYC platform? Or how do you go about feeling secure in giving out loans in an under collateralized fashion? How do you solve that problem?
00:11:57.640 - 00:12:30.406, Speaker D: Yeah, there are two aspects. So you brought up the identity part, and the answer is a, we do have Kyc in it. And what we built to make Goldfinch work is what we call unique identity, which is an NFT. We call it UID, the NFT. And that is like when someone goes in the KYC, we create this NFT that's non transferable, that says you've been KYc. And so then it's known that this represents your identity, this NFT that any protocol, including Goldfinch, can use to know that this person has been Kyc and is unique. So that solves the uniqueness aspect.
00:12:30.406 - 00:13:49.570, Speaker D: And then there's the second aspect, which is how do you ensure that a borrower is going to repay their loan when they aren't already providing this other form of collateral, which is crypto collateral. And the answer is to figure out a borrower's credit worthiness in a different means and have a different kind of collateral. So the way it works on Goldfinch is there are a community of folks, and we call them the backers. And the backers talk to the borrower like off chain, look at data rooms, do due diligence, get into amas and ask them questions and working with them directly. And then when they supply capital, they also enter into loan agreements directly with that borrower. And so we call this, instead of doing like crypto collateral, the sort of collateral comes through what we call a trust through consensus, which is the consensus of the backers, who all agree a particular borrower is credit worthy and they provide capital, and it's higher risk because the capital the backers provide goes into the junior tranche, which is first lost, and then they also enter into loan agreements with that borrower, so they have legal recourse as well, off chain. And so the credit worthiness comes from, and the collateral is from that borrower's off chain assets and their off chain activities, and that whole loan agreement that exists.
00:13:49.570 - 00:14:00.566, Speaker D: And so we're kind of shifting the way credit worthiness is determined from just capital literally sitting on chain to the consensus of a group of backers who are all agreeing this particular borrower is good.
00:14:00.668 - 00:14:37.702, Speaker A: Yeah. I might add one analogy that some of the listeners might be familiar with, which is how Nexus mutual works, where there are these protocols who are looking for insurance, and then you have a community of people who, through whatever means necessary, decide that this protocol is trustworthy, and they stake their NXM token on it to lower the price of buying insurance on that protocol. It's a somewhat analogous mechanism to the backers deciding through whatever off chain mechanism they want. I'm willing to put capital into this particular borrower, and by putting their own capital up, you know, they're taking real risk. And so the protocol is then able to trust them, and it allocates additional capital from this senior pool, which we haven't gotten too much into, but we can get into that as well.
00:14:37.836 - 00:15:19.490, Speaker C: So it sounds like this is really like a hybrid tradfi defi approach, where you guys haven't really solved the whole identity thing, which is arguably not really solvable. If you want to do under collateralized loans, you kind of have to bring in some sort of external identity in order to really have the full backstop. But you are using Ethereum and DeFi for capital allocation, capital efficiency, like easy, seamless movement of funds, as well as the ability to collect a lot of people to make some sort of group wisdom of the crowds type of market analysis. So would you say that's a fair representation?
00:15:20.070 - 00:15:53.242, Speaker D: Well, I would say, yeah. Versus. I think of it as like a bridge. We're trying to bridge what's happening on crypto with things that are happening off chain in this real world activity. But take, for example, the UId NfT we created, where it's like there's a service that is guaranteeing someone has been KyC. I view that as pretty analogous to, say, USDC, where the consortium there is saying that, yes, there's a dollar sitting in a bank account for every USDC token that exists. We're saying, yes, there's been KYC for every one of these UId nfts that exist.
00:15:53.242 - 00:16:18.660, Speaker D: And so then it'd be like, in terms of solving identity, it's not like the die of identity, it's not like a fully, entirely crypto native version of it. But I think a version of this where it's this bridge and it's still proving that off chain, there's proof that that person has been KYC can still be fully sort of composable within the Defi space. And I view that as one of potentially a number of different solutions that will show up.
00:16:20.410 - 00:16:49.262, Speaker A: I think the identity piece, as Mike's pointed out, is totally correct in terms of the sort of lending piece, right, that component. Because the identity, we could swap that out with any provider we want. We could swap that out with the decentralized identity provider in the future. And the protocol has been built all of that way. Identity is just sort of like a function that's necessary, but it's not core to how the lending takes place. But I think to some of your earlier points, from the lending perspective. Yeah, we're using DFI for the things that we think DFI is truly, really good at, which is capital allocation anywhere in the world.
00:16:49.262 - 00:17:37.118, Speaker A: The ability to be composable with other financial products in a permissionless way, the global nature of it all that stuff is just better than the traditional finance space, which is why we really see private debt all moving on chain over the next five to ten years, because of these features, things like access and liquidity that are just like. These are the two big things we think DFI does so well anywhere in the world is able to participate in these deals in a way that just wouldn't have been really hard before. And then beyond that, DeFi makes it so easy to create liquidity on the positions that our backers take into these deals. So kind of an analogy is sort of what we're doing is a private credit fund in the traditional finance space. Those are usually like a qualified investor. Investor to get, and it's very tough. And then also, once you put your money in, you're probably not going to see it for three, five, seven years.
00:17:37.118 - 00:17:58.190, Speaker A: And there's really no good way to even sell your position because it's all on paper. No one even knows where that money is really going. But with Goldfinch, all that stuff is on chain. All the loans are on chain. The repayments are all happening on chain, you know, which pool your token is a representation of. And it's really easy to permissionlessly create secondary markets for those tokens which allow people to get liquidity on them. And this should all reduce the cost of capital.
00:17:58.190 - 00:18:22.560, Speaker A: We think that's just going to be part of a big to go with your ethereum sync thesis. I think this is why capital is just going to be flowing into Ethereum and why we think private credit is going to move on there, and you're going to want a marketplace to organize all that activity. But I don't think that DeFi sort of fundamentally makes it easier to underwrite these deals or assess credit worthiness until all that information starts moving on chain. And I think it's just going to be a little.
00:18:25.890 - 00:18:46.420, Speaker C: Guys, do you have to take KYC information to be compliant from a regulation perspective for Goldfinch, as in, in order to check marks, all the compliance boxes, you guys have to take KYC information, or do you take KYC information just because that's really just the base building block that you need in order to establish some sort of identity? Are you required to take.
00:18:47.670 - 00:19:23.454, Speaker A: Yeah, I want to separate here, like Goldfinch, the protocol from the borrowers who are like our borrowers, our companies, they have their own compliance requirements, and they need to have some notion of KYC to know that they're not taking anonymous capital, because that's a global thing, that's not just an american thing. And the anti terrorism finance thing is very real. It has a lot of stringent consequences. So they need that from a compliance standpoint, the goldfish, the protocol, just needs some sort of civil resistance. Right. Because we use this notion of trust through consensus, and that requires some form of id that's hard to replicate. And so KYC sort of ended up serving kind of both purposes there.
00:19:23.454 - 00:19:52.986, Speaker A: But I just kind of want to underscore that it's really the borrowers who need the KYC. And also I think that the KYC actually is really helpful for truly making this decentralized. Like, we want Goldfinch as a company to really be stepping out as much as possible, right. We don't want to be involved. We want this to be direct between the backers and our borrowers who are coming to the protocol. And the fact that there's KYC is what enables that for the borrowers to remain compliant and allows them to sign deals directly with the borrowers rather than know, we're not signing any deals in here. We're not like part of these legal agreements or anything like that.
00:19:52.986 - 00:20:03.566, Speaker A: Whereas I know there are other real world asset protocols. Sometimes they get the company sort of acts as a centralized entity, which that's what's taking the risk off of the borrowers, even if the protocol is open up to all.
00:20:03.748 - 00:20:44.860, Speaker C: Interesting. Okay. And then you talk about the NFT token that represents a signature that this person or this individual has been KYC'd. From my limited experience working at a previous company that had to do stuff like, like even if a third party company was able to attest to some Ethereum address, that this one particular ethereum address was indeed positively KYC'd, as like a United States individual, compliantly, we wouldn't actually be able to trust that without doing the KYC ourselves. So does that token actually work as an endpoint for other third parties to trust as KYC information?
00:20:45.630 - 00:21:49.710, Speaker D: Yeah, it depends on the type of entity. So the main reason we want to do it is because a lot of these entities around the world, they just need to have assurance that they're not like taking a terrorist money or helping in money laundering of these forms. And so the folks who don't need KYC whatsoever, and they're happy to use Defi today, then there's another layer of folks who just need that assurance for their own local jurisdictions and they can get comfortable with the NFT that exists. Then you could go to probably an extreme of highly regulated institutions in the US who feel most comfortable if they're doing their own KYC. And then probably there would need to be some evolution of how this KYC NFT works on crypto to serve that. But I think it's helpful to think about it in terms of a spectrum from doing every single KYc yourself to not requiring any KYC at all. And this NFT at least got us past the hurdle of a large group of new kinds of funds and companies around the world where that was enough to check the box off for them to use it.
00:21:49.710 - 00:22:06.914, Speaker D: And then I think this will certainly be a space that evolves over time. And probably there will be always some folks who want to do their own KYC directly on the individual every time. And then we have ideas of ways to solve that eventually. But yeah, it's not like solving that particular type of customer right now.

00:24:29.590 - 00:25:00.540, Speaker C: Right. And then also, just to reiterate, it sounds like Goldfinch is, like, KYC system agnostic as it's in. Any sort of KYC system can come into DFI that has some sort of adoption and standards around, and maybe the industry just somehow organizes around that one. And that's the one that Goldfinch just plugs into, just because that's what the ones that are using. Right, like, you guys aren't building your own standards. You guys are just setting the minimum viable KYC standard and letting the participants kind of take it from.
00:25:01.310 - 00:25:24.210, Speaker D: I mean, like, ideally we wouldn't have had to build the KYc thing in the first place, but there was just nothing that was going to solve the customer's needs. So we built this, and we hope that it's useful for other protocols as well. We think it has some really cool sort of capabilities that it enables. But also, if there's some other kind of KYC solution, I would suspect the Goldfinch community would switch over to that.
00:25:24.280 - 00:25:24.802, Speaker A: Cool.
00:25:24.936 - 00:25:56.622, Speaker C: All right, that's enough KYC talk. I hate KYC. Let's get into the defi lending stuff. Okay, so I would imagine that the incentive for lending out money using goldfinch versus just lending it into compound is that you can get higher rates on Goldfinch. If we're going to have some sort of under collateralized loan, then there's probably a little bit more risk there than a collateralized loan. And so therefore, you could get more yield by lending it to goldfinch than you could to compound. Am I on the right track here?
00:25:56.756 - 00:26:25.814, Speaker D: Yes, that's right. And there's two benefits. So one is the yields are higher. So the interest rates of the loans to these borrowers are the market rates in these areas, which tend to range from ten to 15%. And then take the senior pool, which is the aggregated, kind of like passive pool. There's fees that go to the protocol, and then there's a portion of interest that is reallocated to the backers. So the senior pool sees 70% net of the actual interest rate.
00:26:25.814 - 00:26:58.798, Speaker D: So if the interest rate is 10%, the senior pool is seeing 7%. So even on the low end, the rates are really compelling. This is all directly on USDC. And then there's additional kind of g five distributions on top as rewards. So that's one compelling part of it is the yields are higher. The second compelling part is these yields are coming from businesses selling products around the world that have nothing to do with crypto. It's like motorcycle taxi companies in Kenya and small businesses in Brazil and cook stove sales in India.
00:26:58.798 - 00:27:19.334, Speaker D: And so take right now, when potentially the crypto markets are fluctuating a ton, these yields that are coming from these borrowers are just steady. They're not driven by crypto activity. And so the second benefit, in addition to the higher yield for the additional risk you take there, is that these yields are steady and completely uncorrelated with the crypto space.
00:27:19.532 - 00:27:27.562, Speaker C: Neat. Neat. Okay, so we're starting to build, like, actual real world anchors with our demand for lending. And it's also international, too.
00:27:27.696 - 00:27:30.282, Speaker A: Yes. We're in 18 different countries right now already.
00:27:30.416 - 00:27:37.294, Speaker C: That's really cool. That's really cool. Is that intentional, or is that just because that's where the demand is?
00:27:37.492 - 00:28:02.322, Speaker A: Yeah, it was really two things. One, as you said, they have a big pain point. There's not a lot of capital going there, and so they're willing to use crypto off the bat. Right. And so there's just like a ton of demand, a ton of pain point there, as Mike was saying. Also, they have compelling yields there, which is great place to start for crypto. And third, also helps achieve sort of the mission that we have as a company is just expanding access to capital and building financial inclusion through crypto.
00:28:02.466 - 00:28:16.154, Speaker D: I would add the fact that it's like, in 18 countries, we didn't focus just on Nigeria or just on Indonesia to start was also intentional because we think it's stronger to be diversified geographically from the very cool.
00:28:16.192 - 00:28:26.478, Speaker C: That's really cool. Do you guys have any success stories or any stories that you liked from the consumer standpoint of people that got funding from Goldfinch that otherwise wouldn't have?
00:28:26.644 - 00:28:51.526, Speaker D: I could give examples of three pretty cool borrowers who are using Goldfinch. One, there's this company called Tegande. They're based in Uganda, and they're ramping up their operations in Kenya. And what they do is they provide loans to people who want to do motorcycle taxis in Kenya. So this is like the Uber of Kenya there. And these folks need a loan, and they do rent to own to buy the motorcycle. I think it's like a $2,000 loan, and they pay it off over a couple of years.
00:28:51.526 - 00:29:09.340, Speaker D: And so Tigende has borrowed a significant amount from Goldfinch to ramp up their operations in Kenya. And they've been around for years and years, and they have tens of thousands of customers, but mostly in Uganda. So this is helping them really ramp things up in Kenya. Another example is.
00:29:11.070 - 00:29:25.194, Speaker C: The vision that people should have is a bunch of people buzzing around on their motorcycles, and there's a lot more transportation going on. That's a lot cheaper transportation going on because there's just a lot more supply of motorcycles because of the capital that was able to come out of goldfinch.
00:29:25.322 - 00:30:13.674, Speaker D: Yeah. And these folks, I think they use the term like they're entrepreneurs who are getting a motorcycle, and they're doing. It's how they're earning their income. So not only is it making the transportation cheaper, but it's folks who are earning a living now by being, like, taxi drivers on motorcycles through the help of all the capital coming from crypto, basically, to help them borrow that money, which is pretty cool to see capital coming all the way from disparate parts of crypto into the hands of someone in Kenya who's able to get a taxi motorcycle, which is a really cool thing. Another example is a company called Davy bank, and they're in Brazil. And what they do is they provide working capital loans to small businesses in Brazil. And so these are a bunch of companies throughout Brazil who just need short term loans to be able to meet their working capital needs.
00:30:13.674 - 00:30:53.578, Speaker D: And now Divi bank has built up a great business doing this, and they've taken capital from Goldfinch to then provide to these businesses. And then a third really cool example is a company called Greenway. They're in India. They have these eco friendly cook stoves that are eco friendly, and they provide them to low income households throughout India. And then the way the company makes money is through the carbon credits. They are profitable from that. And so what the loan from Groffinch is doing is allowing them to get more of these cooksos and provide them to low income households throughout India.
00:30:53.578 - 00:31:02.938, Speaker D: And so this is another example of something completely separate, kind of, from crypto. But they would have struggled to get that capital without this kind of a loan.
00:31:03.034 - 00:31:17.474, Speaker C: And why would they have struggled to get that capital? Is just, like, the options to get micro loans or short term loans, just not available. Is this like, a story of crypto coming and providing financial services to parts of the world that it just doesn't exist in?
00:31:17.672 - 00:31:42.940, Speaker A: So I would say we should also be clear that goldfish doesn't provide, like, micro loans to these individuals. At the bottom, they're providing loans to the company. The company then provides loans to smaller individuals and businesses and stuff like that. And so that is important also from a risk standpoint. All of the expected defaults from those individuals are all kind of rolled up into the rate that people should get. So the default rate on goldfish right now is actually 0% and has been for over a year that we've been in operation. That's cool.
00:31:42.940 - 00:32:30.774, Speaker A: It's really like a lot of these businesses fall into a gap that is just not well served within the traditional financial space. So in a lot of these developing markets, they don't have capital markets that are as deep as they are in Europe and America, and so there's just not as much money there. So if the businesses wanted to raise less than, say, like, 500k, that's probably kind of a doable thing in there, even with the limited financial markets. But then if they wanted to raise a lot of money, like 25 million plus or something, you could probably start getting the attention of western institutions and people from Europe. But there's a big gap there that's just really not well served due to kind of inefficiencies of the general financial markets, as well as also a lot of governments in these space. They offer kind of high yield government bonds that tend to sort of crowd out the other investment money that might come from a bank. And so banks are just really not interested in serving these types of customers in a lot of these markets.
00:32:30.774 - 00:32:46.074, Speaker A: And that's a theme we also heard over and over again from the calls we had. And so did you have crypto over here? Very risk tolerant capital, very global space, and we knew they'd be willing to lend out to high quality businesses no matter where they are in the world. And so that's really what crypto is providing, is just this access to capital.
00:32:46.202 - 00:32:46.878, Speaker D: Cool.
00:32:47.044 - 00:33:00.674, Speaker C: So let's talk a little bit more about the lenders. We talked about how the incentive to lend might just be because of higher yields. But you guys have also alluded to some sort of, like, tiering of risk. Can you go into that? If I heard that correctly?
00:33:00.802 - 00:33:54.498, Speaker D: Yeah. So there are two ways to participate. One is in the senior pool, which is kind of, one's in the senior pool, and one is, as a backer, in the individual loans. And the way to think about it, I'll start with the backers, which is when there's a loan through Goldfinch, it is divided into two tranches, the junior tranche and the senior tranche. Then the backers provide capital to the junior tranche. And what that tranche means is that whenever there's a potential loss or default, the backers take losses first before the senior tranche takes any kind of a loss. So, if the backers provide 20% of the loan and the senior tranche is 80% of the loan, then if, for whatever reason, the borrower defaulted and they only paid back 80% of what they owed, the senior tranche would get every dollar back, and the backers would lose all their money in that scenario.
00:33:54.498 - 00:34:44.758, Speaker D: And so there are two ways to participate. One is, if you're a backer, you can evaluate the individual loans, and you can provide capital into very specific loans, and then you're doing so in the junior tranche. Or if you participate in the senior pool, you're providing it into kind of like an aggregated pool that just automatically allocates capital to every single loan on the platform into the senior tranches. So when you are providing into the senior pool, it's automatic, it's diversified, and it's protected by the backers. And the way to make this all make sense economically is that 20% of the interest for the senior tranche is reallocated to the backers. So it really gives the backers an outsized return. So take, for example, a loan that has a 12% interest rate.
00:34:44.758 - 00:35:05.306, Speaker D: Well, the senior pool might see in the range of, say, 8% to 10% base yield, but the backers who are in the junior tranche, they'll see more like 18% base yield. So they receive a much larger yield for both doing the work of picking and choosing the different loans and then providing capital that is higher risk and junior.
00:35:05.498 - 00:35:39.650, Speaker C: Okay, so, there's this line that Kathy Wood said that stuck with me is that prices are determined at the margins. She didn't invent that line. But basically, this is what's happening here, right where we have this very big senior pool that's just like the lazy lenders. The people are like, all right, just take my money. Go do stuff with it. I don't really want to do any of the vetting. And then you have the junior tranche, or just the active lenders, which are actually unpacking, like, looking at the terms, actually drilling into this thing, like you said, doing the work, and then also taking the risk.
00:35:39.650 - 00:36:12.260, Speaker C: And that's where you can get some super high yields. And the way that that super high yield comes from is taking a small slice of the yields that are going to senior tranche, which is like your laziness penalty, and then giving that to the junior tranche, which is like your. You did the work reward. But then also, this is where the wisdom of the crowds comes in, where the risk takers need to actually do a good job vetting the quality of the loans. And if they do a bad job, they get punched first.
00:36:12.710 - 00:36:13.570, Speaker A: Exactly. Right.
00:36:13.640 - 00:36:14.066, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:36:14.168 - 00:37:45.982, Speaker D: And I think this leads to a second question that would be helpful to clarify that I'm guessing people would ask, which is like, well, how does the senior pool decide how to automatically allocate the capital to the different tranches? And that's where this whole concept of consensus comes in. If there's a borrower pool, and literally just one backer participates in that borrower pool, the senior pool in the protocol says, well, I don't know if we can just trust what only one backer did, but if there's a different borrower pool where 1000 or 10,000 different backers all participated, then the protocol can say, oh, we can trust that a lot more because it has a lot more consensus by the shared number of people who have participated in it. And so the methodology is that there's the concept of this leverage ratio, which is how much additional capital does the senior pool put into a given loan relative to what the backers put in? And that leverage ratio is dynamic. And so it'll be based on parameters that we'll set as a community, but there will need to be some minimum number of backers before the senior pool will even put, like, a single dollar in that. And then there will be, like, a leverage ratio that increases and say, as you get to 100 backers or 1000 backers, maybe the senior pool will put in $2 for every dollar or $3 for every dollar as you go up. And so that leverage ratio is really crucial because it's the idea that you can trust a loan when there's a bunch of backers already in it and allocate more capital to it. But if there's only a couple of backers, you don't put any capital in there because you don't see the consensus yet.
00:37:46.116 - 00:38:30.938, Speaker C: Okay, this is really cool. This is the really cool crypto economic magic side of this protocol so far that I've got it. What you're saying is that if all of the risk takers have all decided to allocate their money to the same pool, that's signaling to the market that actually that pool doesn't really all have all that much risk in it because all of these backers are putting all their money in the same spot. It's like, oh, well, clearly they all believe that this is a very good opportunity for them. Clearly, there's not much risk here. And so either the lenders, the senior pool, will get more favorable rates or perhaps maybe the actual borrower could also get more favorable rates, too. How is the interest rate for the borrowers determined? Or how are the interest rates determined?
00:38:31.114 - 00:38:51.478, Speaker A: Yeah, so the interest rate doesn't move in response to this thing. The interest rates are determined. Really, you can think about it as just kind of market action between the backers and the borrower. Right. The borrower could come to the protocol and say, hey, I'm going to pay a 1% interest rate. That'd be great for the borrower. But then no backers are going to fill that, and so they're never going to get their money.
00:38:51.478 - 00:38:58.358, Speaker A: Right. And so they're just going to need to pick a rate that is reasonable, that's going to satisfy both the backers, but also is low enough for them to still be able to pay back.
00:38:58.524 - 00:39:34.574, Speaker D: Yeah, I think kind of walking through, just so you can understand how it works is like the borrowers almost propose like a term sheet to the backer community. They say, hey, everyone, we want to borrow $10 million at a 12% interest rate because we have this great business, we're going to use the money for these things. And they are asking the backers to provide the capital towards it. And they're saying, these are the terms that we're asking for the capital. So it's not a dynamic interest rate in the sense the borrower says, here's something I want. But if the backers all kind of reply being like 12%, that's not really a market. You should really be paying 13 or 14%, then that could be like an off chain agreement.
00:39:34.574 - 00:39:45.170, Speaker D: And they can propose a different pool. But the terms of the interest rate aren't kind of like dynamically set. What's dynamically set is like how the capital flows into that pool.
00:39:45.250 - 00:39:50.978, Speaker C: Very cool. Very cool. It's like an automatic wisdom of the crowd load balancing for capital.
00:39:51.154 - 00:39:53.786, Speaker A: Yeah, I like that. Fair way to look at it.
00:39:53.808 - 00:39:54.620, Speaker D: Yeah. Cool.
00:39:54.990 - 00:39:56.620, Speaker C: So there's a token, right?
00:39:57.150 - 00:40:01.438, Speaker A: Yes, there is a token that was launched three weeks ago.
00:40:01.604 - 00:40:34.898, Speaker D: Yeah, a few weeks ago in early January. It's the governance token. So right now, governance is live. We kind of like handed over the protocol to the community and there's like snapshot voting. And a very cool thing is we're using quadratic voting because we have the UID, like the unique identity NFT. So we know people are unique and we don't have to worry about, we have civil resistance from that. And so we implemented quadratic voting on snapshot, which is cool because there aren't that many ways to do that without having that civil resistance.
00:40:34.898 - 00:41:07.890, Speaker D: So the token is there. It is serving governance. It is also right now being distributed as like rewards for liquidity, mining for the senior pool, and then for the backer side very soon to come, maybe even by now for folks listening. And then there are a number of other utilities that the token serves. One is when there will be an auditor system. We haven't described that yet, but auditors will stake this token and they will be paid in the token. And then another is the ability to kind of stake on backers, which is listed in the white paper.
00:41:07.890 - 00:41:11.726, Speaker D: So this is other kinds of things. The token will do a whole bunch of different things for the protocol.
00:41:11.838 - 00:41:14.830, Speaker C: Cool. And then how does the protocol collect fees?
00:41:14.910 - 00:41:26.630, Speaker A: The protocol takes 10% of all interest that comes back in. So basically the protocol wins when everyone else wins. Right. And there's also a 0.5% withdrawal fee.
00:41:27.770 - 00:41:35.138, Speaker C: Okay, point. So after, when you are lending and it's time to come collect your money, you pay a 0.5% on the capital to the Dow.
00:41:35.234 - 00:41:54.560, Speaker A: Yeah. And that really is just there to kind of lightly incentivize long term holders. Right. Guard against certain attacks of like if you were to try and predict when interest payments are going to come back in and the prices are going to go up, you don't want to flash loan into that and then pull your capital out and stuff like that. So it's just a light mechanism there to say, hey, you should be here for some long term cool guys.
00:41:55.170 - 00:41:59.440, Speaker C: Let's see, are there any angles that I have missed or haven't touched on yet?
00:42:00.530 - 00:42:18.726, Speaker A: I would just say there's a whole bunch of questions we get from other people around, like how do you prevent fraud and collusion between the backers and the borrowers and things like that. That is a rich topic that actually we can get into. I don't know how much time we have and stuff, but also just wanted to say a lot of those in the white paper and people can read all of those angles as well.
00:42:18.828 - 00:42:24.922, Speaker C: Yeah, this sounds like an in depth conversation, but it sounds like there are answers to that, to that.
00:42:25.056 - 00:42:45.330, Speaker A: We have thought through all that and the token is part of helping to do that security, keeping it really brief. The auditors, they stake this token sort of like a proof of stake mechanism on ethereum or other chains where they can be randomly selected to look at deals before a drawdown happens, to look for signs that collusion might be taking place between the borrowers and the backers. And that's kind of the idea there.
00:42:45.480 - 00:42:50.114, Speaker C: So where does the protocol actually live? Are we on Ethereum main net or where is it?
00:42:50.232 - 00:42:51.346, Speaker D: Ethereum main. Net?
00:42:51.448 - 00:42:51.954, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:42:52.072 - 00:42:53.490, Speaker C: Any l two plans.
00:42:55.510 - 00:43:25.166, Speaker A: Yeah, we'd love to move to an l two. Just kind of got to get to it. The truth is, for the borrowers, because they're borrowing such large sums of money, the gas fees on Ethereum are not as big a deal for them. Of course, we want to be able to expand access and make it available to as many people as we can. And the gas fees and ethereums, we know, are prohibited for a lot of people. So we'd love to move to an l two. We're going to kind of delay that, build a few more aspects out on the protocol, and then probably, I imagine the community is going to want to move to that.
00:43:25.166 - 00:43:26.606, Speaker A: Maybe later this year.
00:43:26.708 - 00:43:26.974, Speaker D: Right?
00:43:27.012 - 00:43:39.346, Speaker C: I can imagine. This isn't a high touch application. This is like one transaction and then a really long time and then another transaction. Not like NFT degens who are touching their ledgers every single day.
00:43:39.448 - 00:43:52.630, Speaker D: Yeah. Folks who, the ideal kinds of folks supplying capital are doing it for a very long time, and then people who are borrowing, they're borrowing millions at a time, and then they're making a monthly interest payment. So it just doesn't require frequent transactions.
00:43:53.210 - 00:44:00.280, Speaker C: What happened? Well, I guess you guys have said you have a 0% default rate, but what is the protocol for somebody who misses a payment?
00:44:01.230 - 00:44:27.794, Speaker A: Yeah, so the losses would just get socialized. There's the waterfall, as we said, right. The backers lose all their money first, and then the senior pool loses its money. In either case, the losses between the groups are socialized. So that just means that we sort of reduce the share price for the senior pool all at once. So there's no ability for someone to come in and get all of their money out before someone else. There's no kind of like run of the bank issue there.
00:44:27.832 - 00:44:39.240, Speaker D: You mentioned the word share price, which is kind of like an internal protocol term, but it just means that the amount that folks can redeem is adjusted for the fact that it's expecting this payment will not be made.
00:44:39.610 - 00:44:46.200, Speaker C: So what if somebody is just like five days late? How does the protocol account for something like that?
00:44:46.810 - 00:44:51.142, Speaker D: There is a grace period, so I forget what the exact.
00:44:51.196 - 00:44:53.894, Speaker A: Is it, 30 days, 30 days or a couple of weeks?
00:44:53.932 - 00:45:16.866, Speaker D: There's some grace period. So if it's literally five days late, what's traditional with these loans? Not even in crypto, but traditional markets is there's some grace period. And then after the grace period, I believe it's 120 day write down period continuously. So that loan just gets written down over the course of 120 days until it's paid back and then all that capital is resupplied back to all of the folks who participated in it.
00:45:16.888 - 00:45:18.322, Speaker A: Or so it's written down. Yeah.
00:45:18.376 - 00:45:24.722, Speaker D: So there's no like from one day to the next, just like some big loss. It's just, yeah, that's the way it works.
00:45:24.856 - 00:45:29.240, Speaker C: Awesome guys. Well, if people are intrigued and want to learn more, where should they go?
00:45:29.690 - 00:45:40.780, Speaker D: They should go to the website Goldfinch finance and then would encourage people to check out the discord, enjoying the community and the Twitter. Those are all linked to from the website.
00:45:41.230 - 00:45:51.820, Speaker C: And who do you guys need the most in the ecosystem? Do you guys need lenders or do you guys need customers? Or what are you guys missing in the ecosystem? The.
00:45:53.550 - 00:46:10.178, Speaker A: Know, really, every player in the ecosystem is important to making the whole marketplace work. I think for this audience, probably the most thing that makes most sense is becoming backers or lps in the protocol. Remember, the backers are the active ones, more risk takers, and the LP is more kind of passive. Set it and forget it.
00:46:10.344 - 00:46:16.722, Speaker C: Awesome guys. Well, I've definitely learned a lot in this episode, so thank you for explaining to me all about Goldfinch is awesome.
00:46:16.776 - 00:46:17.746, Speaker D: Thanks so much.
