00:00:01.130 - 00:00:36.050, Speaker A: Bankless Nation, we've got an excellent episode prepared for you today. What's hot on Arbitrum? That's the question, david, it feels like it's layer two season. I know we've said that a few times in the past, but this time it feels like a real bright spot in the crypto community. Layer twos are up. And among all of the layer twos that are doing things in terms of getting more transaction volume, getting more users, deploying more applications, arbitram is kind of in the lead. And so we are doing a deep dive exploration on the Arbitrum community. Why don't you tee up what's in store for us in this episode?
00:00:36.130 - 00:01:35.660, Speaker B: Yeah, so we got three community leaders who are also the experts. They're co founders, the core contributors of whatever particular app on Arbitrum that they contribute to, but they're also just DeFi NFT power users across the broad Arbitrum landscape. And so we're going to have a panel today of three Arbitrum power users that are building on Arbitrum, that are just community members of Arbitrum, community leaders of Arbitrum. Because of all things that happened in 2022, all of the down bad things that happened in 2022, Arbitrum was not one of them. They were one of the few ecosystems that was growing throughout 2022. And you can really feel it in the energy of the community. So I want to know, why is Arbitrum so hot right now? What is Arbitrum specifically as the team? What are they doing right? And what is on Arbitrum that these NFT organizations, these CeFi apps are really leveraging? There's a bunch of energy going on and I want to know why that energy is so high.
00:01:36.350 - 00:02:17.862, Speaker A: Guys, we're going to get to the episode before we do a few things to talk about. Number one is crypto Tax calculator. Here is Ryan Sean Adams, the tax optimizer himself, telling you, have you done your taxes yet? Have you taken a look at them at least? I know last year was kind of a mess. You might be thinking about ignoring it. Don't make the mistake I have made a long time ago. That's why, David, it always gets on me for like ryan, why are you always talking about taxes? It's because I felt the pain before in not having a tax strategy ready and getting totally burnt. There's this new tool called crypto Tax calculator that actually the COO of Bankless Rachel Kusak let me know about.
00:02:17.862 - 00:02:49.742, Speaker A: And I wish I had had this in previous years, David, because there are lots of different ways to do your taxes in crypto. But what I found is no tool covers all of the different hard, complicated transactions, right? Like layer twos and DeFi. Does it support this application? That application, what about its NFT support? Crypto tax calculator is actually the most user friendly, comprehensive way of getting all of these integrations in there like they do the hard DeFi degen transactions.
00:02:49.806 - 00:02:52.210, Speaker B: Do you guys hear the excitement in Ryan's voice right now.
00:02:52.360 - 00:03:10.502, Speaker A: I'm seriously excited about this. And here's why I'm excited, is because it's literally going to save me hundreds of hours, right? Like, you just plug in your address and boom, you get the results. You deliver that to your CPA or whatever. Do it yourself. Anyway, taxes don't actually excite me, but getting taxes done quickly excites me.
00:03:10.556 - 00:03:10.870, Speaker B: Fair.
00:03:10.940 - 00:03:19.530, Speaker A: And that's what you can find at Crypto tax calculator. David, I think there's a discount there's a big discount, like a 30% discount. How do folks activate that?
00:03:19.600 - 00:03:37.086, Speaker B: Yeah, there is a link in the show notes to activate a 30% discount for Bankless listeners. But if you're a Bankless Premium subscriber, there's a 40% discount in the discord. So go find that code there. But otherwise, for you non premium subscribers, you can go ahead and click a still healthy 30% discount in the link in the show notes.
00:03:37.198 - 00:03:41.730, Speaker A: I think that the code is bank. Am I right? Bank 30. Grab that discount.
00:03:42.150 - 00:03:43.458, Speaker B: I hope that's right. I will.
00:03:43.464 - 00:03:51.858, Speaker A: Go check it out. Go check it out. All right, so, Arbitrum, David, you've teed up the episode. What should listeners really be paying attention to from these three panelists?
00:03:51.954 - 00:04:22.110, Speaker B: Yeah, like I frequently say on Bankless, there's always a bull market somewhere. And the energy across the layer two ecosystem is probably at all time highs. And that is especially true about the Arbitrum ecosystem. Ryan, did you know that the Arbitrum Bridge contract is the 7th largest holder of ETH? Number seven. Number seven, yeah. It's also one of the largest burners of ETH. And so the energy of the Arbitrum Smart contract burning all that ether is coming right out of the Arbitrum community.
00:04:22.110 - 00:05:10.154, Speaker B: You can see them in the chat right now. Yes, I am looking at so, like I said in the intro, I want to explore, how did Arbitrum do this? What about the builders on Arbitrum? Why do they choose Arbitrum? Arbitrum doesn't even have a token. Things like avalanche solana, like all these other layer ones have had tokens, yet Arbitrum is lapping them in TVL and transactional volume. What is going on over in Arbitrum? So this is going to be the meta of the show. These are going to be the questions that we were asking the three contributors in the Arbitrum app layer. We got a representative from the Treasure Dow, we got a representative from the GMX leverage what do you call these things? Margin trading apps. Which, fun fact, ryan was the best token to hold throughout 2022, where everything was down like 90% GMX.
00:05:10.154 - 00:05:41.326, Speaker B: Better than stablecoins up 20%. It was up 20% in 2022. Yeah, uncategorically winning 2022. And then also we got a game, the Beacon. And so we're going to explore DFI, we're going to explore NFTs, we're going to explore gaming, because apparently you can do it all on Arbitrum. And I should say that there are disclosures that usually we don't have too many disclosures to disclose, but on this episode we do. I own a material amount of magic tokens and also small brains, which are the unofficial PFP of the treasure ecosystem.
00:05:41.326 - 00:05:55.178, Speaker B: And the Bankless fund also owns some small brains as well. Oh, and Arbitrum is also currently a bankless sponsor, so there are plenty of conflicts of interest in this episode. But we've been promoting layer twos for a while now, so this should really come as no surprise.
00:05:55.354 - 00:06:21.986, Speaker A: David also owns some ETH too. We may talk about ETH here or there. Certainly I'm excited about this episode because I feel like I'm going to learn a bit more about the Arbitrum ecosystem. So guys, if you want to join us in that, then stay tuned. We'll be right back with our episode with folks at Arbitrum exploring this ecosystem. But before we do, we want to tell you the sponsors that made this episode possible, starting with our favorite number one recommended crypto exchange, and that is Kraken. Stay tuned.
00:06:22.098 - 00:07:15.990, Speaker B: Kraken has been a leader in the crypto industry for the last twelve years. Dedicated to accelerating the global adoption of crypto, kraken puts an emphasis on security, transparency and client support, which is why over 9 million clients have come to love Kraken's products. Whether you're a beginner or a pro, the Kraken UX is simple, intuitive, and frictionless, making the Kraken App a great place for all to get involved and learn about crypto. For those with experience, the redesigned Kraken Pro App and Web experience is completely customizable to your trading needs, integrating key trading features into one seamless interface. Kraken has a 24 7365 client support team that is globally recognized. Kraken support is available wherever, whenever you need them by phone, chat or email. And for all of you Nfters out there, the brand new Kraken NFT beta platform gives you the best NFT trading experience possible rarity rankings, no gas fees, and the ability to buy an NFT straight with cash.
00:07:15.990 - 00:07:35.694, Speaker B: Does your crypto exchange prioritize its customers the way that Kraken does? And if not, sign up with Kraken@kraken.com slash Bankless. How many total airdrops have you gotten? This last bull market had a ton of them. Did you get them all? Maybe you missed one. So here's what you should do. Go to Earnify and plug in your Ethereum wallet. And Earnify will tell you if you have any unclaimed airdrops that you can get.
00:07:35.694 - 00:08:03.234, Speaker B: And it also does poaps and mintable NFTs any kind of money that your wallet can claim. Earnify will tell you about it. And you should probably do it now because some airdrops expire. And if you sign up for Earnify, they'll email you. Anytime one of your wallets has a new AirDrop for it to make sure that you never lose an AirDrop ever again. You can also upgrade to Earnfi premium to unlock access to airdrops that are beyond the basics and are able to set reminders for more wallets and for just under $21 A month. It probably pays for itself with just one AirDrop.
00:08:03.234 - 00:08:11.046, Speaker B: So plug in your wallets at Earnify and see what you get. That's Earnifi. And make sure you never lose another AirDrop.
00:08:11.158 - 00:08:11.594, Speaker A: All you.
00:08:11.632 - 00:08:28.080, Speaker B: David ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this state of the nation where the state of the nation is hot. Because that is exactly what Harbitrum is. In the top right corner, we got corel. Corel is the COO and co founder of Treasure Dow. Corel. Welcome to the show.
00:08:28.770 - 00:08:30.766, Speaker C: So happy to be here. Thanks for having us.
00:08:30.868 - 00:08:43.154, Speaker B: In the bottom left corner of your screen, we got Diego. Diego is Over At the Beacon, which is a game, I believe, inside of the Treasure ecosystem. We're going to ask about how that works. Diego, welcome.
00:08:43.192 - 00:08:47.726, Speaker D: Absolutely. Hey Guys, happy to be here. I'm the CEO and co founder of the Beacon.
00:08:47.838 - 00:08:56.146, Speaker B: And then also in the bottom right corner, we got Coin Flip Canada, the only Anon on the stream. This is why we've got his little profile picture over the Zoom chat. Coinflip.
00:08:56.178 - 00:08:57.240, Speaker D: Welcome to the show.
00:08:58.010 - 00:09:01.158, Speaker E: Thanks for having me here. David. Longtime fan of this show.
00:09:01.244 - 00:09:01.554, Speaker A: Cheers.
00:09:01.602 - 00:09:32.958, Speaker B: Well, It's been a while since We've had A panel up On Bankless, which is Why I'm juggling both the stream and also the questions. But I think this is going to be pretty fun, guys, because this is exactly what these systems, these protocol systems, are supposed to do. Bring people together in the app layer to Allow for some interoperability and also some lively, healthy growth. That's what we're looking to talk about here. And so I want to start with this question. What exactly is Arbitrum doing? Right. Because the Arbitrum ecosystem is one of the hottest things in Ethereum.
00:09:32.958 - 00:09:53.610, Speaker B: But not just in Ethereum, in all of crypto. Like I said in the intro in 2022, crypto deflated in 2022. Except for Arbitrum. And so I want to know why that is true. So, Corella, I'll throw this first question to you. From your perspective, what's going right in the world Of Arbitrum?
00:09:55.070 - 00:11:00.154, Speaker C: I'd say A ton of things. I mean, we're coming into this from the vantage point of Gaming and NFTs, of course, but I think for us, we came Into Arbitrum late, kind of 2021, kind of shortly after they launched, so we were fairly early into everything. And I think the major theme in just Kind of working not only with Arbitrum but also everyone else here, is that this Is a super Collaborative and largely kind of community driven sort of effort. And so working Shoulder To shoulder with everyone here, they're focusing on The Right things, growing organically, you kind of mentioned it and looking at when Token, which I think Is A common theme across the board. But, yeah, I think there are so many different sort of game changers that have come out of this. I think from a technology perspective, as builders and users, that's Been A Huge thing for us at Treasure and all the games that we're supporting as well. So definitely I think that's been a huge kind of part and I think why they're kind of playing the right cards.
00:11:00.154 - 00:11:24.200, Speaker C: And I think the other part of that is everyone who's come here to build on top of the Arbitrum network. And so for us, all the games, a network is kind of dead without DApps and protocols and things that are coming here. I think there is that sort of flywheel network effect that is coming out from just having a thriving sort of ecosystem that is growing and building together.
00:11:25.050 - 00:11:46.542, Speaker B: Diego, I want to throw kind of the same question. I think we're going to just take this one by one by one. Diego, from your perspective over at the beacon and perhaps you could kind of illustrate how the beacon works on Arbitrum because if I understand it correctly, the beacon, the game is built on top of Treasure Dow, which is built on top of Arbitrum. Is that how this works? And overall, can you talk about just the network effects that you've been able to experience over there?
00:11:46.596 - 00:11:59.886, Speaker D: Yeah, so to some degree, the beacon interacts with Treasure, but it's not precisely built on top of Treasure. It's built, in fact, on top of Arbitrum. Like all our contracts, all our smart contracts are deployed in Arbitrum.
00:11:59.918 - 00:12:00.162, Speaker E: Right.
00:12:00.216 - 00:12:30.074, Speaker D: But Treasure is like this sort of ecosystem that powers games for the most part. And the Beacon assay game pretty much just stepped into Treasure's infrastructure in order to not only will help it grow, but also us benefiting from the thriving ecosystem that they have. But technology wise, yeah, it's an arbitrary project in that sense. Everything is just on the arbitrary. It's an arbitrary on the technical side of the equation. What I do think that they've been doing well is a few things. I mean, Corel actually summarized it pretty well.
00:12:30.074 - 00:13:11.898, Speaker D: But it's the fact that there's like this set of interesting initiatives that have been growing in Arbitrum lately, very cool projects, and most of them are very community driven and very open towards collaboration. And I'd say that's one of the key aspects to it. But it's also the fact that for developers and I would say that for users alike, arbitrary is a fantastic experience. Like for us, when we deployed our contracts and everything did on the arbitrary layer, the experience was fantastic. It was really smooth. And from the side of our users, transaction speed is fantastic and it's also on a very low cost basis. So I'd say that if you add all these factors together, they really grant an experience that makes people well, delighted of the experience.
00:13:11.898 - 00:13:16.538, Speaker D: I'd say that that's one of the main things, yeah, that's from my side of this.
00:13:16.704 - 00:13:47.060, Speaker B: And of course, Corel and Diego are part of the NFT gaming ecosystem side of Arbitrum, but the DeFi part of Arbitrum is just as hot and so I'm going to turn now to Coinflip Canada out of the GMX ecosystem. So, Coinflip, talk to us about DeFi on Arbitrum. I think that's kind of where Arbitrum really started is starting with DeFi apps. NFTs and Treasuredao came out to shortly afterwards. But Arbitrum really got started with its roots in DeFi. Talk to us about the health of the DeFi ecosystem on Arbitrum. What about it is so special to you?
00:13:48.310 - 00:14:40.246, Speaker E: Well, in many, and without making it sound too grand for me at this point, arbitram DeFi is Ethereum DeFi. It's just become the natural home where the applications, the DApps, the collaborations that you want to do are possible in the environment that Arbitrum has built, safe, secure, secured by Ethereum, which I think has been such a fundamental part of its success. The fact that so many people have been willing to come over, bring their assets over to Arbitrum. You said the number seven wallet in all Ethereum is the Arbitrum bridge. It just shows that the comfort level with remaining closely aligned within the Ethereum ecosystem has been just such a boon. But it's also been that. And again, I was probably involved in DeFi in the early days, but I wasn't involved in, let's say, in Ethereum in the early days.
00:14:40.246 - 00:15:19.620, Speaker E: And you talked to a lot of people, they say that we have that sense that it's a small community still. It's really a community where people are building. The conversation is around product. People are looking at how innovation actually applies, how it works together, how there is product, market fit. I think it's really interesting that it sort of runs at a pace that is very way to put it in crypto. Nothing is human, but at a very human pace where people are actually trying to figure out how they do sequential pieces that are not rushing to deploy things that don't work and see what happens. I don't know, there's just a real sense of sensibility over there.
00:15:19.990 - 00:15:46.460, Speaker B: And Coinflap, like I said in the intro, GMX is one of the few applications that ended up green on the year in terms of the token price, but also trading volumes. And I also butchered the description. I believe perhaps the correct description of what GMX is, is the derivatives exchange. But for people that never have interacted with GMX before, or maybe derivatives exchange isn't the right name. And can you just explain a little bit more about the DeFi app, what it is and what does it do and what you can do on it?
00:15:47.550 - 00:16:49.706, Speaker E: Yeah. So GMX is a Oracle based, perpetuals and spot exchange on Arbitrum and Avalanche. It basically works by aggregating the best off chain data from large centralized exchanges and in time, decentralized exchanges as their volumes grow to help create a deep liquid on chain market. And we've really been able to try to create an environment where people have confidence that they're getting transparent pricing. Everything that happens is still executed on chain. You're able to verify what the market price was, what you were executed at, what you were liquidated at, using chain link Oracles, it's really just helped to try to bring, I think, a sex like experience over into the on chain experience, but most interestingly, doing so without external market makers or other participants, but instead relying on one of the great DeFi innovations, which is a liquidity pool.
00:16:49.898 - 00:16:53.598, Speaker A: A sex like experience. And of course you mean centralized exchange like experience.
00:16:53.684 - 00:16:55.714, Speaker B: Of course, our YouTube comments have already caught up on that.
00:16:55.752 - 00:16:58.660, Speaker A: Maybe not that good. It is pretty good.
00:16:59.590 - 00:17:01.780, Speaker E: Try GMX, though. And then tell me.
00:17:04.230 - 00:17:33.310, Speaker A: Coinflip, you mentioned that Arbitrum DeFi is Ethereum DeFi, which is kind of interesting take on things. I'm curious from all of our panelists, maybe starting with you again, Coinflip, and we'll work the other direction. How would you describe Arbitrum culture? How is it the same? How is it different than Ethereum culture? And then GMX is also deployed on avalanche. How is Arbitrum similar or different from an alt layer, one like avalanche?
00:17:35.810 - 00:18:47.794, Speaker E: I think the starting point between Ethereum and Arbitrum and obviously I think spending so much time in Arbitrum, maybe for me the line has become very fuzzy because maybe I've had the opportunity sort of GMX has been very privileged. We've been sort of the biggest player on Arbitrum and it's given us a chance to probably talk to so many protocols. And those conversations are always about how they can come in, how we can integrate, sort of if I take the great idea of being able to be composable, have permissionless, contracts, those discussions have been very central. So I think a lot of things that people were hoping to do on Ethereum, which I think just from a gas standpoint, even now with lower gases, were not practical settlement times. I think people have sort of said, well, great, we've been able to solve that by coming over to Arbitrum and now actually sort of conceive a lot of the ideas people had a few years ago. So I think now it's really a conversation about so how do we do it? I think my conversations, to be fair, in the avalanche ecosystem have probably been very similar. I think when you actually get down to conversations with builders, there is, I think, a lot more sensibility.
00:18:47.794 - 00:19:20.960, Speaker E: The markets, obviously, and the wider ecosystem gets noisy. But most builders have been really focusing on what piece of the puzzle they can work on and how we can work together. And I think Arbitrum, I've really appreciated working with, collaborating with other protocols who have also said, look, we've got one piece of the puzzle and hopefully all of these pieces put together start to create a tapestry. They start to create that experience in DeFi that doesn't require you to now need to move off chain for anything.
00:19:22.290 - 00:19:57.260, Speaker A: Diego, how would you describe kind of crypto gaming culture and Arbitrum. And what does that look like? I mean, I remember there was a period of time where Ethereum, Mainet had more crypto games. They were very sort of primitive, but most of those have kind of now migrated. Is Arbitrum sort of an epicenter for crypto gaming right now? How would you describe that? And is Arbitrum going to be the long term home, like Arbitrum one? Or is there talk about like Arbitrum Nova or some of these other game centric layer twos as well?
00:19:58.030 - 00:20:52.662, Speaker D: So it seems to be that Arbitrum is like the epicenter of l two gaming at least. But I would say that it's not a coincidence. The fact that we have Treasure Dow into Arbitrum is actually one of the main, I would say one of the core drivers of that adoption. But not only Treasure, of course, the Arbitrum team is also putting serious effort on making this environment more friendly towards developers. Like, for instance, Nova is actually quite the promising approach to build games upon and for users to use it. To me, it's the fact that it would seem to be, and this is just my personal opinion that currently the community in Arbitrum, at least in relation to games and perhaps like other prices, well, is more cohesive, it's like more united than what you would find, let's say, on the other chains. Maybe, for instance, if you compare the Arbitrum community with the Avex community, it would seem to be, to me at least, and maybe I could be biased because I'm building here, right, that it's more cohesive, more driven, more welcoming.
00:20:52.662 - 00:21:44.058, Speaker D: At the same time, it's like maybe because it's also the fact that Arbitrum is let's say I wouldn't say the new kid on the block, but it's fairly newer to some degree than maybe all these cool initiatives have been being built upon it, that it also brings the hype in. People are actually quite enthusiastic about the future of Arbitrum and the fact that it's also tied to Ethereum makes it to be perceived as a more secure bet. Right, well, you're building games, we're having games and everything, but it's also tied to Ethereum. So that sort of thing set up. To me, the main feeling I derived from this is that the community is more united and I will give the ball to Carl in this one is that it seems to me that a good portion of that is also due to the fact that Treasured Dow has been pushing this sort of ethos forward as well. So it's like it's hard to distinguish one from the other to some degree. This is very tied together.
00:21:44.058 - 00:21:45.598, Speaker D: But yeah, Carl, if you want to.
00:21:45.604 - 00:21:46.866, Speaker A: Add to that yeah, Carl, I want.
00:21:46.868 - 00:21:47.338, Speaker D: To put you in trouble.
00:21:47.354 - 00:22:07.126, Speaker A: By the way, it sounds like Treasure is a main reason for the gaming ecosystem really taking off on Arbitrum in the way it has. So can you describe kind of the gaming culture. And yeah, why do you think Treasure and Arbitrum are becoming the nexus for layer two gaming, as Diego says?
00:22:07.308 - 00:23:12.646, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. Thanks for the I mean, I think the Arbitrum gaming and I mean, it's largely Treasure culture, as you know, I think because of that, and I'll give some background maybe on Treasure really quickly, I'll kind of speed run through it, but we're effectively building what we like to call the decentralized Nintendo. So a crypto native game publisher that is leveraging Web Three to its fullest extent. So breaking down walled gardens, transforming how game publishing is done in a bottom up and community driven manner. And all of this is tied together through interoperability shared resources, magic as our token. And so as we think about this kind of context and I think why we sort of view this as the culture of Treasure as well is, I think, a lot of the gaming and NFT activity, certainly from a transaction perspective, we really dominate the scene right now. I think we account for across all of our different games, like over 95% of related transactions on Arbitrum.
00:23:12.646 - 00:24:30.500, Speaker C: So kind of looking at it from that lens, I think a lot of it is because of how we're approaching things. And in the same way that you have a Nintendo, you have different cartridges, different games that you can slot in and out, there's this cohesiveness that spans, really, the entire ecosystem. So between the games, between the different types of kind of infra and tooling that we're building out, everything is connected. And you're kind of looking at this in the sort of viewpoint of this sort of broader degree of network effects that really kind of drive both players and builders into this epicenter that is kind of forming. It's a very, I think, deep contrast to some of the other sort of l two S networks out there where, in a lot of ways, any games that are kind of building there for the most part anyway, we haven't necessarily seen a kind of treasure like community form quite yet, is that they're kind of building in isolation. And so, really, this rising tide lifts all boats. Ethos is something that we live and breathe by and it is kind of shared across all the games that we have and who we have the pleasure of working with.
00:24:31.830 - 00:24:47.938, Speaker A: Is that basically Arbitrum one? Is that going to remain home for Treasure? I mean, I mentioned Arbitrum Nova earlier and then we've also talked about Avalanche, but what about Arbitrum One? Feels like home. And how would you kind of expand into other chains if you do?
00:24:48.124 - 00:25:52.830, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, Arbitrum One is in a lot of ways a relic which has served, I think, treasurer quite well, but just in terms of how we migrated and moved everything over from E cell One onto Arbitrum. Right? And so Arbitrum Nova wasn't there at the time. It's a good bet on us to kind of transition there. I guess if we think about the future of Treasure and where we're going to go from here, certainly I think there are no plans to move away from Arbitrum kind of period at this point in time. But I think with the Nova question, I think just thinking about from an even technology perspective and speed and transaction costs, it makes a ton of sense as they are really kind of by they, I mean Arbitrum, they're positioning this as the gaming and social kind of chain for different sort of applications like that. So I think we did launch support via our marketplace for Arbitrum Nova, I think, in the fall.
00:25:52.830 - 00:26:16.100, Speaker C: So could there be really a subset of games that also emerge there? I think it's very realistic and I think there's a bigger question on the liquidity kind of front as well as we think about this token that unifies everyone. Having that fragmented is also a big question. So it's not something we're looking at lightly, but definitely considering for sure.
00:26:16.710 - 00:26:19.380, Speaker B: Diego, am I hearing rumors of thoughts from you?
00:26:19.830 - 00:27:14.694, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I was just wanting to add something that Garell said to mean I don't want to throw us lower in any other chain or anything like that. I haven't been exploring the other chains for a while because once we sat on Arbitrum and Treasure, we just stopped looking. But I could add that at some point when we were deciding on which chain to launch on, one of the key challenges that we sort of found out was that even though there were initiatives for these chains to build games upon, it sort of felt like every game you had on these different chains was like a siloed operation. It seems like there was no communication between the community of one game with the community of another game, even though they were in the same chain, let's say as Avex. Whilst on the other hand, with Treasure and arbitrary for that matter, you sort of found that there was like this deep connection of community. And I say that was like the deal breaker for us to jump in. It wasn't that those other chains didn't give you support or any of those things, but it seemed to me that the community aspect was stronger on the Arbitrage side.
00:27:14.694 - 00:27:22.250, Speaker D: And for that, for us, that meant that was like the deal breaker. Community is king if you want to build a blockchain game coinflip, you have any thoughts?
00:27:22.750 - 00:27:23.500, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:27:25.230 - 00:27:53.506, Speaker E: Echo what Diego said. The community aspect, I think really should not be underestimated. The fact is that if I go through sort of our side chats within GMX, the dialogue actually isn't just about DeFi. There is a lot of conversation about Treasure other people building game environments. There's a lot of interesting sort of gamified vaults and GameFi that's also developing out. I mean, I know Treasure is also looking at a. Few things within the ecosystem that we might be collaborating on.
00:27:53.506 - 00:28:18.294, Speaker E: So I think that's the interesting thing, that people are sort of toying out and testing out those different models because there's been such an interesting intersection between those two sort of areas. It'll be interesting to see how things keep developing, but the fact that people in these communities are overlapping, it's not like we have a NFT community and a DeFi community. There's really an Arbitrum community that sort of overarchs and people are dabbling across that whole ecosystem.
00:28:18.422 - 00:28:27.434, Speaker A: There's a lot of crossover between DeFi and gaming. You mentioned GameFi, but that's been talked about a lot. But is that really happening on Arbitrum?
00:28:27.482 - 00:29:07.882, Speaker E: Coinflip yeah, so there are platforms that are looking at well copy trading in a sort of a social aspect. You're looking at people doing gamified vaults. There's a project protocol called, I think, DSQ who's working with us. I think they're doing something with magic as well. I know even Magic's been talking about looking at LP positions and other things to sort of back their ecosystem. So I think there's a lot of things there where we're trying to see how do you optimize for idle capital, because there is a lot of inefficiency that sort of lies in the system. So obviously we're all a little careful because we don't want to go too quickly.
00:29:07.882 - 00:29:29.220, Speaker E: But I think those conversations have happened and we see a lot of potential for overlap. And I think that if I were using an example that GMX has done very well with attracting a good amount of capital and trading activity. So off of that, you're getting a lot of people looking at gaming, which crosses over into gambling and a lot of other things that are sort of happening. So I think you're going to see a lot of happening in that space.
00:29:29.750 - 00:30:22.226, Speaker B: I'm actually reminded of what you were saying coinflip from all the way back in DeFi summer, where we had this concept called composable communities, where I think this really came out after, like Yams came out, where you could deposit your synthetics tokens, your maker tokens, your Ave tokens, your DeFi project tokens. And it was all these communities coming together to farm Yams. And it was like this great composability of all these ecosystems come together under this one DeFi app. And so this one brand new DeFi app, yams was collectively owned by all these other communities. It seems to me there's a little bit of that playing through in the Arbitrum app layer. But it's interesting to me that this is not really something that is technical. This is not a protocol competing against another protocol, right? This isn't like Arbitrum going over and competing with avalanche on their protocol, even though I'm sure they could.
00:30:22.226 - 00:30:34.310, Speaker B: But it's really something much more in the social layer that is really allowing Arbitrum to rise to what we see today. Do you think that's a fair take? Of it's actually the culture that has been created more than the protocol.
00:30:35.450 - 00:31:15.860, Speaker E: Yeah, I'm not going to get into a technology conversation because I think every system has its own merits. But I think that in some ways, as you said, 2022 was a very interesting experience. If I think about when Arbitrum main net went live, if I recall, it was basically November 1 of 2021. It almost kicks to the peak of the market of the Bull Run, and that's when Arbitrum went live. There's no Arbitrum, Token. There's nothing on that front. So what happened was it did become a community that got to focus on the protocols and everything that was being built.
00:31:15.860 - 00:31:42.458, Speaker E: I'll say that, listen, I can take avalanche, I can take phantom, I can take all these other ecosystems. In some ways, as Token went down, communities got their emotions, got tied with the token price as opposed to what was being built. Great stuff was being built in other spaces. But in Arbitrum, everybody got to only focus on what was being built. And I think that was it just really helped to snowball and keep growing in the right direction for us.
00:31:42.624 - 00:32:16.440, Speaker B: Coinflip. I got one more question for you. That since when you hopped into the Zoom, you said that you're familiar with Bankless content. And that means that you're generally familiar with the Bankless thesis. Which means you're generally familiar that Bankless has kind of been promoting the layer two thesis much more than it has the alt layer one thesis. And since GMX has straddled both Avalanche and Arbitrum, I think you're actually in a pretty well equipped position to give an audit as to the Bankless thesis. In what ways do you think we were right? In what ways do you think we were wrong?
00:32:18.010 - 00:33:09.962, Speaker E: Well, okay, so I will say I'm a great believer that the Ethereum network, from a security standpoint, is the most valuable system of security. And I think that that's been a real big aspect of where, from a DFI standpoint, I think there's a lot of potential. So I think that thesis is extremely strong when it comes to L two S. And as you said, we're deployed on avalanche as well, and there's even governance proposals for us to go to other L ones. I think it really comes down to what is getting built on each protocol. I mean, for something like GMX, we're a base layer, and we want to work with other people who could build on top of us, who can build liquidity under us, and it largely comes down to each ecosystem if there's an active number of builders. So I don't know, I think the thesis is sound.
00:33:09.962 - 00:33:23.082, Speaker E: I mean, I think that Ethereum will continue to snowball and grow, and for any alt L one to stand up, they will have to differentiate themselves. I'm not sure if that's in DFI, if that's in gaming or whatever area.
00:33:23.136 - 00:33:23.740, Speaker D: But.
00:33:26.110 - 00:33:33.166, Speaker E: Black holes not the right thing. But there's a center of gravity around Ethereum and then the L two S that is very strong.
00:33:33.348 - 00:34:22.158, Speaker A: You know what's so exciting to me about this whole conversation is how much David, this feels like we are exploring new know and kind of like settling. We've called layer two the kind of the new frontier. It's moved from Ethereum Mainnet into the new frontier. And what we're seeing in Arbitrum is entirely different kind of ecosystem of players and important applications in the stack. So, like, Treasure being incredibly important, GMX being incredibly important, this whole gaming ecosystem that is so much different than the kind of the cast of applications and important ecosystem participants on Mainnet. And you might have assumed, like a sterile world of, yeah, all of the big DFI apps and all of the big kind of apps on Mainnet will just replicate across all of the layer twos. We're not seeing that at all.
00:34:22.158 - 00:35:18.482, Speaker A: It's almost like our analogy of Ethereum is kind of like a nation of states, every state being kind of a different blockchain. Some of these things are almost like cities. So when we look at arbitrary and compare that to optimism, it's almost like looking at the difference between New York and San Francisco. These are entirely different cities with different networks and different ecosystem participants. And sure, there's some crossover, but they're all united under this one kind guess settlement assurance of a nation state. Anyway, that's very striking to me, and it's also very exciting because what it means is there is a whole new world of opportunity for builders to make their mark in new chains. And in addition to kind of lower gas fees being a place for innovation to sort of thrive, we have these new ecosystem participants that can try something different.
00:35:18.482 - 00:35:31.510, Speaker A: And I think we'll get a lot of variety that way. Is that what you're seeing? Or am I off here? Because I know you've explored L two S a little bit more deeply than I have. And this is a question for you, actually, David.
00:35:32.170 - 00:36:06.302, Speaker B: For me? Yeah, this is absolutely what I'm saying. There's the different cultures in different cities, but also free transportation, free access across each one, right? So you can walk I mean, you can't really but in theory, you could walk from San Francisco to New York, right? There's nothing stopping you from doing that. And that's what it feels like, layer two bridges. But what you do find in these different layer twos is different cultures. And it's easier to compose inside of cities than it does across cities. So that's kind of what I'm seeing there. Coinflap, I got one last question for you about specifically GMX.
00:36:06.302 - 00:36:22.760, Speaker B: Before we turn the conversation into the more NFT and gaming ecosystems. How are other DFI protocols on Arbitrum hooked into GMX? Because we all know that DFI is what it is because of composability. What's the current state of composability on the Arbitrum layer two.
00:36:24.890 - 00:37:41.482, Speaker E: It exists and it's growing. And so I would say that I'll just use an example that if we're doing any sort of update to our protocol at this point, we're probably sending out updates to 50 different protocols, builders groups who are already sort of tied into GMX in one way or the other, and roughly an equal amount who we know are already in the process. And that's across both our existing deployment and our upcoming GMX synthetic markets, which is kind of a bit of a successor to what we've done with GMX and GLP. You have countless people building delta neutral vaults, you have people building compounding vaults, you have people building trading strategy vaults now that are utilizing GMX. You have options, protocols already deployed and more who are deploying, who are able to use GMX to provide capital efficient hedging strategies for being able to expand their marketplaces. So I think everybody has really looked and found value in bringing that capital efficient structure on chain and being able to ensure that you have transparent settlement. You're not needing to move beyond the chain to be able to effectively add risk or offload risk.
00:37:41.482 - 00:38:10.470, Speaker E: That's a nice way to say it. For other protocols, for traders, it's typically doing the same thing, but for protocols, I think it functions very differently. And that's continued to be a build out. So I really do feel like 2023, you're going to see that notion of the Lego, really, the tower being built up with multiple protocols feeding liquidity into GMX and multiple protocols building and utilizing that liquidity.
00:38:10.810 - 00:38:42.346, Speaker B: Carlton and Diogo, the way that I kind of think of you guys are founders of your respective projects, but power users of the rest of Arbitrum, so that means DFI too, I'm assuming. Do you guys use Arbitrum for all of your DFI activities? Is it like 50 50 between Arbitrum and the rest of the ethereum ecosystem? I know we've said that Arbitrum is DFI at this point, but to what degree is your activity, your DFI activity, whatever that may be contained inside of the Arbitrum ecosystem? Krell, let's start with you and we'll go to Diego afterwards.
00:38:42.538 - 00:39:21.120, Speaker C: Yeah, I'd say it's fairly limited, speaking from a kind of treasure lens, but aside from a liquidity standpoint, we had recently kind of made a swap from kind of Gamified protocol owned liquidity that was previously just kind of through Sushi magic ETH kind of pools and moving that to GMX. We haven't put that in place quite yet, but at least we got the governance proposal through. So there is that kind of crossover that is beginning to kind of take shape. But beyond that, everything that we sort of do and interact with is all on.
00:39:21.810 - 00:39:23.966, Speaker B: And Diego. What about you?
00:39:24.148 - 00:40:10.030, Speaker D: Yeah, I guess I can add to that. So I guess it's important to disclose that our project does not have a token per se, like our own token. We don't have one and we may have one in the future, but we don't have one because we pretty much rely on treasure's infrastructure, economic infrastructure, to be the unit of account of our game to some degree. And so most of the DeFi part are actually sort of outsourced towards Treasure or towards Corel in that sense. But I do envision that if at some point, let's say we have a token, we will for sure use Arbitrum's infrastructure on the DeFi side to fuel it. Right? But there's no need to do that now, on the personal side, I do use arbitrary on DeFi quite a bit and the speed and the transaction cost is quite delightful. But yeah, in the case of our project, it's mostly just we outsource the problem towards Corel in that sense.
00:40:10.180 - 00:41:06.118, Speaker C: Yeah, and if I can add there, I mean, I think there are homebrew or homegrown kind of, I'd say, products that we're in development for to kind of bring this to life as we think about just the cross game economy. So we have something called magic swap, which right now is essentially just using magic as the base pair. I mean, that's similar to a lot of the other kind of protocols out there. There is an evolution of that, that's kind of coming that is more focused around how we can do this, but from an NFT perspective. And as we think about and I think there's a big debate right now across gaming and Web Three on kind of the financialized sort of aspects of it and the other side, which is more the intrinsic sort of value that you can kind of derive from essentially kind of building here. And so there's a lot of that know, we're kind of building up towards as you know, certainly that will sit on arbitrary.
00:41:06.314 - 00:41:45.966, Speaker B: Well, Carl, I really want to dive down into the economics of the Treasure ecosystem and the whole idea of Treasure as a Nintendo for Web Three with different cartridges to slot in and out. There's always been this idea in the world of crypto, of composable games and composable gaming and up until this point I've been kind of a skeptic. It's like, all right, that's a cool meme, that's a cool narrative. But it's hard to say that what Treasure Dow is doing isn't actually executing on that narrative. And so this has gone from a narrative to an actual real story. So I want to dive down into that specific part of this conversation. But first I want to talk about a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this episode possible.
00:41:45.966 - 00:42:27.274, Speaker B: Uniswap is the largest on chain marketplace for self custody digital assets. Uniswap is of course a decentralized exchange. But you know this because you've been listening to Bankless. But did you know that the Uniswap web app has a shiny new Fiat onramp? Now you could go directly from Fiat in your bank to tokens in DFI inside of Uniswap. Not only that, but Polygon, Arbitrum and optimism layer Twos are supported right out of the gate, but that's just DFI. Uniswap is also an NFT aggregator, letting you find more listings for the best prices across the NFT world. With Uniswap, you can sweep floors on multiple NFTs, and Uniswap's universal router will optimize your gas fees for you.
00:42:27.274 - 00:43:13.142, Speaker B: Uniswap is making it as easy as possible to go from bank account to bankless assets across Ethereum, and we couldn't be more thankful for having them as a sponsor. So go to app Uniswap.org today to buy, sell or swap tokens and NFTs. Arbitrum One is pioneering the world of secure Ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the Web Three landscape. Hundreds of projects have already deployed on Arbitrum One, producing flourishing DFI and NFT ecosystems. With a recent addition of Arbitrum nova gaming and social DApps like Reddit are also now calling Arbitrum home. Both Arbitrum One and Nova leverage the security and decentralization of Ethereum and provide a builder experience that's intuitive, familiar and fully EVM compatible.
00:43:13.142 - 00:43:54.178, Speaker B: On Arbitrum, both builders and users will experience faster transaction speeds with significantly lower gas fees. With Arbitrum's recent migration to Arbitrum Nitro, it's also now ten times faster than before. Visit Arbitrum IO, where you can join the community, dive into the developer Docs, bridge your assets, and start building your first DAP with Arbitrum experience web Three development the way it was meant to be secure, fast, cheap and friction free. And ladies and gentlemen, we are back in the second half of the show. We're going to dive down into the NFTs, the PFPs, the Web Three gaming side of Arbitrum in this conversation. And so, Carl, I'm going to start with you. I interviewed the Treasure team back in last April.
00:43:54.178 - 00:44:29.026, Speaker B: I was still living in San Diego at the time, and the community that showed up in the chat was absolutely insane. They were the craziest, but also extremely friendly. The most friendly community that I've ever engaged with, which was really refreshing at the time, because in April of 2022, I had gotten in, like, three fights in a row with various different frog armies. First do Kwans. And before that, Daniel Cestas. So it was really refreshing to have all of these small brain people coming into the Chat, even though I didn't really know what the hell the e thing was. Fast forward to where we are now.
00:44:29.026 - 00:44:54.890, Speaker B: I poked in my head into the Treasure ecosystem to see what's up with that community. Did they make it through 2022? Are they doing all right? And they were just as crazy and energetic as ever. So, dude, how the hell did you do that in 2022? How did you keep your community so engaged throughout one of the worst years crypto has ever happened? How did Treasure inject so much energy into its ecosystem?
00:44:55.870 - 00:45:03.760, Speaker C: Yeah, no one. Thanks for stopping in there. We will definitely have Ryan, I think, do a big e at the end of this.
00:45:04.290 - 00:45:05.440, Speaker B: I've already asked.
00:45:10.450 - 00:45:51.386, Speaker C: Yeah, definitely. It's a team effort. I mean, I think part of it is we've just gone. I think looking back to April 2022. And I'll bring up one of the things that you kind of talked about to cap off the last kind of call we had, which the kind of framing of we have the centralized Nintendo, but then there's also treasure as like the web3 nation and it's the ecosystem made up of many network states of which those are games. They're the metaverses. And so as we think about this GDP of the network, right, it's like the economic activity, it's all the builders, developers, contributors of all the many games and metaverses and then of course, the players.
00:45:51.386 - 00:46:49.550, Speaker C: I think that has there's just something special about gaming which in a lot of ways is antifragile to everything we're sort of doing. And certainly I think with the pace of the just macro and market overall where people are kind of sticky because they're here for the content and the games. And of course there's been a big change in wave from kind of early 2022 P to E. That sort of era has, I think, very much sort of changed the landscape of gaming and how we kind of approach things. And so I think there's that sort of natural just path. As the Treasure ecosystem at large matured, we brought more games, a lot of them also matured as well. And they went from what was much more kind of simple sort of game mechanics and game loops into something that's a lot more immersive, that's fun and it is really kind of going through that evolution.
00:46:49.550 - 00:48:00.406, Speaker C: You have games like the Beacon coming out and I think a lot of these, I think, changes and just us maturing as an ecosystem, the players kind of sticking around because they're just having fun and being part of the community. I think there is also just a provenance of, I think being kind of early and being part of this and kind of contributing in meaningful ways and I think there's a cultural sort of aspect to it as well, the social kind of moat that I think can sort of emerge from that. And you spending time in the small brains community and we in a lot of ways view them as kind of the blue chips and kind of the punks plus bake plus whatever you want to kind of compare them to, but in its kind of unique way and we like to call them the Mario of Treasure. And so I think there's a lot of that has this emotional kind of connection but really at the end of the day, I think there are just things to do here and it leads to, I think, people kind of sticking around and contributing or playing and we're hoping to have a lot more of that.
00:48:00.588 - 00:48:37.220, Speaker B: Yeah, it was definitely something I learned throughout this last bull market is that the attention game is really where it's at in crypto and gaming has this edge over most other things in that there are things to do. So there's always a reason to deposit your attention into a game. We've talked about the narrative of Treasure as like the Nintendo of web3 and what that means. I did not understand that meme when I first heard it. So I think we need to take some time to explain it. Corral can you kind of explain this vision? What does this mean to be the Nintendo of web3 and how do game cartridges fit into this whole thing?
00:48:39.350 - 00:49:26.862, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. So when we think about just game publishing and kind of the Nintendo, that's one really good analogy. There's also the Valve and the Steam and the Half Life which is also another one that you could probably use as well. But really thinking about this from breaking down these walled gardens, which I think is kind of looking at this in a brand new way that previously probably wouldn't have been possible in web two or was not feasible from a business perspective. But now enter kind of web3 and really coming at this from how kind of treasure started. I mean, it was a derivative of loot. I won't go through all the history because we have another pod on this already and kind of approaching this from just like a bottom up manner.
00:49:26.862 - 00:50:20.926, Speaker C: It was a fair launch. Free mints. We distributed Magic, we distributed the kind of initial NFTs that led to free mints, that led to small brains, that led to kind of Bridgeworld and legions. And so that was our approach of one taking this thesis of how can we kind of create and bridge and connect games that could share common resources. So this interoperability thesis but kind of do this in a way that helped to kind of showcase what a proof of concept could look like. So like a Nintendo there are first party bets and IPS that need to kind of form and that ultimately our hope is that we can kind of create some hits from them. But at the same time, because of the nature of the space and what I think magic sort of unlocked for a lot of people was the ability for other builders and other games to come into Treasure.
00:50:20.926 - 00:51:04.862, Speaker C: And again, it's permissionless, anyone can pick it up and do whatever they want with it. But that said, it needs to kind of be done in a way that the Dow can formally kind of accept and bring in one folks who are kind of well aligned with Treasure and magic and really what we're trying to accomplish and kind of build together. And so this enabled this sort of like bottom up manner of building that maybe the Nintendo of kind of web two probably wouldn't be able to kind of tackle it. And so we're doing this. My aspiration is that we no longer have to refer to this moniker of the decentralized Nintendo in a few years and we just call it Treasure.
00:51:05.006 - 00:51:48.302, Speaker B: Certainly, I'll say my first initial reaction to that was, that's a great narrative. All web3 gaming platforms want to have this interoperability. Just come build your game on Treasure. But then my initial skeptical, I was optimistic that we could do this. Somebody could hopefully do this. But my initial reaction was like, well, why would you just build your game on Treasure when you could just build your game independently and not be subjected to the economics of Treasure? And so this is what I was really waiting for after doing the interview back in April, and then I come back in June, I was like, oh, that's actually playing out. Somehow they've managed their coordination incentives to actually encourage people to build on Treasure rather than defect and go out and build on their own.
00:51:48.302 - 00:52:04.850, Speaker B: And one of those games, I think, is the beacon so diogo, I want to turn to you, is like, what resources did Treasure, the Treasure ecosystem, have to offer you and what you were building? And why did you decide to build alongside Treasure instead of just forking off and building your own ecosystem?
00:52:05.190 - 00:52:59.034, Speaker D: Sure, I mean, there's quite a few I'd say that one of the things that I wanted to mention, that I don't really know precisely how Treasure achieved this culture that they have. Like this e kind of thing. I really don't know how you recreate that. I think that's impossible. And when we actually found out about this community, we were like, what is up with these guys? Who are these people? How are they all so well coordinated and so sharing the same, I don't know, ethos to some degree? That was quick. Well, so we quickly realized that we found this community that had the interest that we were looking for, which is people that are interested in the crypto space, but also highly interested and invested in the gaming side of things, much like we were we're all gamers, we love the crypto space. But we found out that this community had those two interests very at heart, and they have built a community that was not only fun, but very contagious.
00:52:59.102 - 00:52:59.526, Speaker E: Right.
00:52:59.628 - 00:53:54.950, Speaker D: So we quickly realized, like, hey, whatever is it that these guys built is actually quite unique, quite hard to replicate, and we don't really want to replicate it. I think that this was like the audience that we're to some degree, like, looking for. Right. But besides the community side, which is actually quite the big one if you're building a game, I'd say that's the hardest part is the fact that Treasure also offers a set of, let's say, an infrastructure that is very hard to build on your own. Let's say one of the main reasons why most projects in Gamify fail is because they develop tokenomics that don't really make economic sense or they sort of orient the game design towards a token and usually they fail on that. But what Treasure sort of grants you is it's a token that has utility outside of your game while also providing you with a community that wants this token and this infrastructure and say this whole ecosystem to thrive. And also providing you infrastructure to build upon like marketplace and other stuff like that.
00:53:54.950 - 00:54:36.962, Speaker D: So they sort of help you in different ways that is very hard to come by if you're building on your own. To me, one of the core aspects where games fail is because they focus on building a token first, rather than just focus on building a game first. So with Treasure, we sort of realized that we could focus on creating what's actually engaging for players, which is the game. Right. We also sort of leveraged the fact that Treasure impulses interoperability, right. The fact that an asset on my game can be used on another game and so on, so on and so forth, which actually adds more value to whatever exists inside the ecosystem. So let's say the Treasure has this property that the more it grows, the more it's enticing for games to hop into.
00:54:36.962 - 00:54:52.106, Speaker D: And the more games that hop into, the more it keeps on growing because sort of everyone benefits from it. And you can certainly see that the community has that in mind to some degree. That's what they've created that I say it's very hard to replicate, it's very hard. So yeah, that's my answer, I guess.
00:54:52.208 - 00:54:52.522, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:54:52.576 - 00:55:16.260, Speaker B: It really seems to be that Treasure's moat is distribution where games could be independent if they wanted to. They could attempt to bootstrap if they wanted to, but maybe they just want to take the easy route and plug right into Treasure and have just like these crazy e fanatics immediately start playing their game. And that seems to be like kind of the bullcase for Treasure. Is that how you guys see it?
00:55:18.870 - 00:56:07.250, Speaker C: I'd say it's one part and I'll start diego, I'll clip that for later and show the team because I think that was a great yeah, I mean, I think when we think about certainly from the gaming and sort of builders, we we like to talk about our flywheels a lot. But there is a bit of this builder flywheel where you have this vibrant and kind of intimate ecosystem. There's the community side, it's Bootstrapping player adoption tap into that. It's the ease in the crowd and also the Beacon community. I think this player base and especially as this grows, there is that kind of cross pollination that's kind of happening. There's this other side of it which I think is maybe more builder centric and in a lot of ways it's almost like a founders group. If you kind of put your VC hat on.
00:56:07.250 - 00:57:03.602, Speaker C: It's a group of just like it's other entrepreneurs, other builders and I think for us to be able to kind of curate and bring really talented folks together who can spend time talking about very openly struggles and challenges that they have with regards to game design. Tokenomics go to market operations. I mean there's a chat going on right now on generative AI and the use of that in art production and it's a very just collaborative kind of effort versus it being really kind of competitive in that sort of nature. So there's a big kind of bucket around that ecosystem. So distribution I think is really key to that but also kind of this kind of building side of things. I think we're moving to this maturity of the network where you can have and kind of bring out just these more immersive kind of gaming experiences. So interop is like a really big sort of theme there.
00:57:03.602 - 00:57:53.506, Speaker C: I think there's also this meta game that is emerging because everything is tied together in so many different ways. So you have this meta game that we're trying to foster that is like InterGame intra game and then just add a kind of layer of identity as kind of social the social graph that players can kind of tap into and then coordinate. We're talking a lot about guilds that could form, that could span different games in the way that what might have emerged in World of Warcraft but think of having something that could take shape in multiple games XP, identity, et cetera, et cetera. So I think there's so many different parts there that we can kind of play a role to help kind of cultivate and really kind of bring this to life.
00:57:53.688 - 00:58:41.810, Speaker A: Charles, I'm curious what's holding you guys back right now? So there was a time where I might have said, yeah, GameFi is being held back by really high transaction fees and kind of scalability constraints of decentralized blockchains. I don't know if that's still the case. Maybe another aspect is user experience. I mean wallets are still kind of hard onboarding into crypto is still kind of hard. But what would you point to like what's holding treasure that entire ecosystem and GameFi in general back? I get the impression that this is maybe in terms of number of gamers we're in the tens of thousands or so, maybe close to hundreds of thousands maybe what's it going to take to get to the millions? What's it going to take to get to kind of the big boy numbers that the Nintendo's of the world are pulling?
00:58:43.830 - 00:59:29.410, Speaker C: I mean, my perspective is a lot of it is from that user experience. I think there's definitely a scaling and kind of cost and speed question. I think in a lot of ways though and you're seeing more of the kind of hybrid on off chain sort of models emerge and I think there's room and a place for fully on chain games. But I do think that there was a period of time where that was the end goal for a lot of folks. But I think we're maybe still a bit far off from that. That said though, I think there's that wallet experience and this may be a hot take. I think at the end of the day, a user and a player shouldn't even know what network they're on.
00:59:29.410 - 01:00:28.898, Speaker C: They shouldn't have to worry about kind of the tokens. And so this is where whether it's on Arbitrum and hopefully it's on Arbitrum, but it could be anywhere else that it's abstracted away, you don't have to manage your wallet. And so we're making quite a number of strides. There are a ton of partners out there, a lot of people just working on really the picks and shovels to make that experience much better for the end user. So I think that is maybe the biggest kind of blocker right now for us to kind of get there. I think the other side of it is just the types of games that could appeal to that kind of mainstream audience or mass market. I think we're still a bit far off from that, but I think there's a number of them that are which I would point to with the beacon being one that I think has the ability to really kind of capture that sort of audience.
01:00:28.898 - 01:00:54.390, Speaker C: And I think we had come from a stage where there was a ton of games that weren't free to play. You had to buy and mint an NFT in order to participate and it cost quite a bit for you to kind of enter and play. So I think there's just a bit of a shift in terms of how games and how builders are approaching it. But I'd love to hear Diego's perspective.
01:00:54.470 - 01:01:18.290, Speaker D: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, there's plenty to touch in there. To me, I agree with Corel for the most part. I think that on ramps are quite the important part. Just make this frictionless for regular players. To me, one of most biggest problems is Gamify itself, right? The fact that you create a game that spins around a certain token and that you need to use DeFi to participate into it. I think that that's not necessary.
01:01:18.290 - 01:02:38.874, Speaker D: The approach that we took on our end was to why don't we create a game that sort of leverages the benefits of blockchain without necessarily requiring it for you to play the game? By doing that, we achieved to some degree to create a fun and engaging experience that also has the benefits of blockchain and that at least as for now, has worked well because people really want to play games on the blockchain. The only issue that you have is that you don't have that many and the way to play them is to well, to purchase tokens and participate on these strange economic loops. There's also to me like a change in some tendencies, like GameFi, let's say a year ago, was way different in the sense that there was like this notion that every aspect of the game had to be in a blockchain, everything had to be centralized, I mean, decentralized, which I think that is not the case anymore. I think that to achieve mass adoption we need a game that is like a hybrid, that has the aspect, even the benefits of blockchain, but that has the technology that allows it to be a fun game. Like you need to have a game that's to some degree centralized in order to create an engaging experience because if everything is on the blockchain, there's just no way to do that and create a fun game by having everything decentralized. You need this sort of hybrid approach. And I think that we're seeing a tendency now where games are actually focusing on the fun aspect first and blockchain sort of second to some degree.
01:02:38.874 - 01:03:18.586, Speaker D: And yeah, I think that that's one of the things that's going to drive adoption is if you want to appeal to the Web Two crowd, give them what they want, which is to have fun, right? And if you show them the benefits of Web Three, which are quite substantial to begin with, they will inevitably keep on using the technology. The way I sort of envision it some degree is that people will be using blockchain in games without realizing that they're using blockchain in games the same way that we don't realize many of the technologies that we use nowadays. I think that's sort of the way to go and I certainly see that happening to some degree, although we still have the old Gamify approach. Let's say that's token based. That's just my take, by the way, I might be wrong on this one.
01:03:18.608 - 01:03:25.326, Speaker A: Of course, you're saying we don't make kind of finance the focus or the end all be all right. It's got to be more than that.
01:03:25.428 - 01:03:26.080, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:03:26.770 - 01:03:54.950, Speaker A: I would just say we're depending on you guys to build some really cool stuff because I don't know if you noticed, but the gaming community kind of hates us right now. Absolutely hates crypto, hates NFTs, thinks it's all a ponzi scam, and it's up to you guys, the builders, to prove that we have something really fun and engaging. And I think we're seeing that in kind of the community, the treasure communities that's sort of stuck around and is exploring this ecosystem right now. They seem very engaged and excited, but it's up to you guys.
01:03:55.100 - 01:04:14.350, Speaker B: Diego, on that note, I think when people hear the words like Web Three gaming, they think Axio infinity. And they really understand it to be like there's a skin on top of this economic game, actually. What's the beacon game? What do you do in the game? What are the objectives? Can you pitch the game for us? How do you play the game?
01:04:14.500 - 01:05:03.082, Speaker D: So the beacon is a roguelike RPG game that leverages the social aspect of MMOs together with NFTs, right? So the game basically spins around two core concepts. The first concept would be a solo dungeon crawler roguelike game that's pretty much based or inspired on games like Hades or the Binding of Isaac. If you experience those games like fast paced action, heavy skill requiring games that use procedural generation so that every time you enter, it's going to be a different experience. And the idea is that players, as they play, the farther they get into dungeons, the better or the more loot they can take home. And this loot could be sometimes NFTs. Sometimes it's just like cosmetic items, right? That's one of the dimensions of the game. And the second dimension of the game will be a highly social gameplay where every player, just for the sake of existing, owns a house.
01:05:03.082 - 01:05:52.234, Speaker D: A house, right? And they can decorate this house with the items that they find during their dungeon runs. So you have like a character, you have your house, most of the items inside the house are NFTs. And the idea is that you can invite people over and visit other players'houses and just pretty much have this sort of social experience, right? But besides that, we have the fact that characters are highly customizable as well by NFTs and by different items so players can have their own unique looks. And besides the housing system and the social experience, we are planning to have this sort of open world kind of city that mimics the experience that most MMOs have. Like most MMOs that you ever played had a town or a city that you needed to go to in order to interact with the core aspects of the game such as questing and crafting and stuff like that. And it's usually that place where people hang around and just talk with each other. And we were planning to recreate this experience in our game.
01:05:52.234 - 01:06:47.326, Speaker D: So we're basically just a mix between Hades and Stardew Valley that also sort of includes the social aspect of MMOs, right? And we're using NFTs to power most of this in the sense that you have limited items that you can share towards others and a highly competitive gameplay that we can leverage to have people competing against each other and stuff like that. So it's basically a game that is a game first approach that uses the blockchain to its benefit rather than relying on the blockchain as its main source of existence, let's say, as its main motive of existence. And that's why we think that will be one of the ways to go in blockchain gaming, is just using the power of the blockchain to leverage the assets inside of a game instead of just pursuing financialization, although you can actually add some financialization approach into it if you want to, but it comes with its risks. Of course, that's like a broad explanation of the game. But I can dive deeper if you want to.
01:06:47.348 - 01:07:27.770, Speaker B: No, I love that I'm already getting excited because roguelikes are my bread and butter. That's my favorite kind of casual game to hop into. Guys, this has been just a great overall landscape overview of the Arbitrum app layer. But I want to talk about this last conversation before we wrap things up here, which is the PFP landscape of Arbitrum, because that's actually how I really just got zoomed into the Arbitrum ecosystem as of recently, is trying to ask myself, what are the PFPs worth collecting in the Arbitrum ecosystem? And so, Carl, I'll throw this one to you. What are the PFPs in the Arbitrum ecosystem? Because people definitely rock them. Can you kind of run us through the landscape of Arbitrum PFPs?
01:07:28.590 - 01:07:54.050, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, you already have one. One is definitely the small brains side of things for a backdrop, the kind of genesis for it. I mean, obviously, super cute monkey, very zany, just amazing kind of pixel art. But the concept of it was it had ever kind of increasing head as you kind of staked it. By the way, you should be tossing up trove on here, not OpenSea.
01:07:56.070 - 01:07:59.794, Speaker B: It's a boomer mistake right here.
01:07:59.992 - 01:08:00.746, Speaker C: Trove.
01:08:00.878 - 01:08:02.760, Speaker A: Okay, I'll be right back.
01:08:05.850 - 01:08:37.386, Speaker C: You would have this kind of small brain that would grow over time, and the longer you staked it, the more IQ it would gain. And with that, though, the kind of collective world would also advance at the same time. So it was definitely one of the first and few that kind of came to Arbitrum. I mean, certainly there were many that were kind of there before as well, but this is really that kind of blue chip. It's the culture icon of treasure. Is it a blue chip?
01:08:37.418 - 01:08:41.410, Speaker B: How do we know that? That's a fair statement to make. Is it the blue chip of Arbitrum?
01:08:41.910 - 01:09:24.626, Speaker C: I guess so. Look at it from maybe like, there's the price angle, but I think from a cultural relevance as well, just in terms of kind of where it stood overall sort of volume. I don't know what that translates to in terms of hard numbers, but it's done quite a bit. But the hope is that there are going to be many more. So we just announced another kind of and, I mean, there's certainly the beacon. I see a lot of people representing their beacon characters on Twitter and Discord and all that as well. We just announced a partnership with a game called Carrero Before the Holidays, which is effectively a Pokemon of kind of web3.
01:09:24.626 - 01:09:39.320, Speaker C: And so they're building an ecosystem and they'll have a PFP collection as well, which I'm super excited for. Maybe I'll bump it to Coinflip because I know that they also have one in the GMX community as well.
01:09:41.930 - 01:10:51.242, Speaker E: Thanks for that shout out. Yeah, no GBCs or the GMX Blueberry Club, which I guess depending on if I'm talking or not, you might see on the screen was a real fun part of our community. Again, we are very much a D Five protocol. But early last year, as the bear was setting in and people wanted to really focus on how they were appreciating and enjoying the community, actually, a few community members came together and created DBC, which has also grown, and you'll find them all over Twitter. And it's a great way for people to show their support for the protocol. But it's created this interesting community because in a very different way, I remember part of the dialogue, it was that we just wanted to show a happy, friendly place and that was kind of our thing of Arbitrum and GMX and everybody coming into our GBCs are happy. Again, I think it became a very nice way for people to just show their loyalty, respect, however you want to term it, for this community that was being built out.
01:10:51.242 - 01:11:02.880, Speaker E: And I think everybody's very proud of that. And I think that's one of the things with PFPs, it doesn't always need to be about signaling status and anything else. It's just about being part of a community.
01:11:03.330 - 01:11:40.650, Speaker B: I'm loving the synergies here between DeFi, which is of course what GMX is, and NFT PFPs, which is just kind of showing the case that it doesn't matter if you're a DFI app, you can also have a PFP NFT as well. And I do appreciate the happy go lucky like vibes of this collection. And also, if you had told me in 2017 that I would be having a podcast where we talk about blueberry profile pictures, I would have thought that crypto went off into weird niche territory. But turns out this is actually how we scale this out to the masses.
01:11:41.790 - 01:11:54.706, Speaker D: It's interestingly enough, one of the most uniting aspects of the whole technology. People really just put the PFPs of the projects that they like and they sort of identify with them. It's big.
01:11:54.888 - 01:11:57.330, Speaker C: Yeah, we're all looking for our tribe.
01:11:58.150 - 01:11:58.900, Speaker D: Absolutely.
01:11:59.430 - 01:12:14.310, Speaker B: Well, guys, this has been a fantastic exploration and I know none of you guys are the actual Arbitrum team, but I have to raise the topic of the question of the token. You guys know anything about the token? Because they are not telling me anything. You guys got any alpha?
01:12:16.010 - 01:12:17.030, Speaker E: What token?
01:12:17.530 - 01:12:19.050, Speaker B: The Arbitrum token.
01:12:21.070 - 01:12:21.722, Speaker C: Never.
01:12:21.856 - 01:12:23.100, Speaker D: I wish I did.
01:12:25.550 - 01:12:50.082, Speaker E: I'm sure it's like the first, 2nd, third and hundredth question they get. But you know what I mean. Jokes aside, I actually appreciate the fact that that's not their focus. It really has ended up being one of the big uniting factors for building out this community. People, as you said. Instead, what have people done? They've come across to Arbitrum because everybody has heard of it. And they've gone and looked into the magic community.
01:12:50.082 - 01:13:11.286, Speaker E: They've looked within GMX and our extended ecosystem. They've gone into dopex's ecosystem. There's all these DEXes that are coming across now and opening trader joe's come across camelot swapfish and everybody's instead focusing on projects and protocols. Not a token, but yes, when token.
01:13:11.398 - 01:13:35.150, Speaker B: Sounds like y'all all share that sentiment. Yet nevertheless, we are all very excited for what we hope to be an eventual token drop some way, somehow, in some mechanism. I'm sure the Arbitrum team is listening right now. Chuckling a little bit. So I got one last question. This one's actually for Ryan. Ryan, what is the letter that comes after D in the alphabet?
01:13:35.490 - 01:13:37.266, Speaker A: Are you talking about E? David? Yeah.
01:13:37.288 - 01:13:38.690, Speaker B: Can you say a little letter E?
01:13:38.760 - 01:13:46.850, Speaker A: I'm just talking about e is a letter. Nothing to do with any PFP ecosystem. It's just the letter E. ABCDE.
01:13:47.830 - 01:13:50.566, Speaker B: Well, they're going to love that one. Ryan, you want to close this out here?
01:13:50.668 - 01:14:20.058, Speaker A: Yeah, guys, it's been a lot of fun. Look, thanks for making crypto fun again and weird again. I feel like we got sidetracked in 2022, but the Arbitrum community is really delivering some cool stuff. So want to thank all of our panelists for this, appreciate you and message to the Bankless nation. It's a bear market, but it's time to explore. This is kind of the most fulfilling time, I think you can be on your crypto journey because there's a lot less noise, there's a lot more builders. The communities are much cooler.
01:14:20.058 - 01:14:33.982, Speaker A: There's much more signal and less noise. So go check out the treasure ecosystem today. We'll have a link in the show notes. You can just Google it, you could figure this out. Also go play Beacon the game. Sounds really cool. Dungeon crawler mixed with crypto economics.
01:14:33.982 - 01:14:50.390, Speaker A: Very cool. Go check out GMX as well. We'll also include in the show notes a link to some of our Arbitrum guides that we've published on the bankless newsletter. So you can get started with this, but most of the tools you're familiar with on ethereum and other places in the ecosystem will work here.
01:14:50.540 - 01:14:58.226, Speaker B: But I think the first point of alpha, I say is on treasure, use trove, not OpenSea. That is one of the first things that I learned.
01:14:58.338 - 01:15:09.966, Speaker A: There you go. I just learn that now. So, guys, we're all leveling up together. Risa and disclaimers, of course. Got to let you know that Arbitrum is risky. So is all of crypto. DeFi is as well.
01:15:09.966 - 01:15:19.660, Speaker A: You could definitely lose what you put in. But we are headed west towards the frontier. It's not for everyone. We're glad you're with us on the Bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
