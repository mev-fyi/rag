00:00:06.650 - 00:00:12.622, Speaker A: Bankless nation. It is the first week of April. This is April 1 as well. David, how are you doing today?
00:00:12.756 - 00:00:38.918, Speaker B: I'm doing absolutely fantastic. Trying to sift through this sea of both real and fake news, trying to put this weekly roll up agenda together. April 1 is a harder time in crypto than in any other industry. And for those that aren't have, this is their first April 1 in crypto. Congratulations. We take this seriously in the crypto world. I remember to this day.
00:00:38.918 - 00:00:49.910, Speaker B: Vitalik released a proposal to hard cap the Eth supply on April 1, and no one knows if it was an April fool's joke or not, like to this day. So it's a special day in the world of crypto.
00:00:50.070 - 00:01:21.394, Speaker A: Bankless has certainly carried on that tradition more when we wait, we did an April fool's joke, maybe. I mean, no, it's up to the listener to decide whether it was an April fool stroke or not. Anyway, guys, you're listening to this on a Friday morning. We hope you are enjoying this with your morning routine, with your morning coffee. We're hitting the market releases news takes and then ending with what we're both excited about, the schedule. This comes out every Friday morning. We release it on YouTube.
00:01:21.394 - 00:01:28.778, Speaker A: We also release it on the podcast. All right, David, let's talk about bitcoin. King bitcoin, how's bitcoin hanging in this week?
00:01:28.864 - 00:01:51.934, Speaker B: Almost above $60,000 once again, $58,940 fluctuating in that very high $50,000 range. And hopefully we are breaking through all time highs with bitcoin sometime soon. Traders are getting bullish, the market is getting bullish, but also bitcoin not being the leader this last week. That is an interesting story as well.
00:01:52.052 - 00:01:55.226, Speaker A: All right, well, tell me who the leader is. Actually, I'm going to flip to it. Is Eth the leader?
00:01:55.258 - 00:02:25.398, Speaker B: David, I think EtH is the leader still. Also not at all time highs, but closer to previous all time highs than bitcoin. Ether coming in hot at $1,968. $1,968. A strong show of force from the low, low price of one $600 that we started this week at for this last week. It's been up and to the right, sentiment really brewing positively for ether ETh.
00:02:25.414 - 00:02:49.490, Speaker A: Two k, my friend. I'm excited to get back out the party hats and celebrate another 2000 milestone. We'll see if it hits this. Maybe it will have hit this by the time you listen to this tomorrow morning. David, let's move to total locked value in DFI. Looks like I am zoomed out to the 90 day here. But what it's been doing recently, it's kind of flat hanging at 44 billion or so.
00:02:49.490 - 00:02:49.954, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:02:49.992 - 00:03:01.110, Speaker B: And again, really kind of just looking like the ETh chart, especially as ether price is going up and more ether is in DFI. It's basically just an extension of the ETH chart as it kind of has been.
00:03:01.260 - 00:03:10.234, Speaker A: All right, let's talk DPi. And I hope you tell us whether it's DFI season or not, or maybe we're in this in between world. What is DPI doing this week?
00:03:10.272 - 00:03:34.640, Speaker B: Yeah, DPI, $430 at the time of recording. I believe it's down versus ether over the week, and that's always to me the more interesting metric, Dpi versus Eth. But DPI versus dollars doing a strong show of force, not as high as its previous all time high, which I believe is around $480. But still, if you're in DFI tokens, you are doing pretty okay.
00:03:35.330 - 00:03:50.806, Speaker A: Doing pretty okay. And someone corrected me, actually last week. I think I said there were ten tokens in DFI. I believe there's now twelve tokens in DFI. Of course, in the DPi, rather new tokens get added to the DPi all of the time. They have a methodology. They have a criteria for doing that.
00:03:50.806 - 00:04:06.602, Speaker A: You can read all about it somewhere else, maybe we'll put it in the show notes. But the Defi pulse index is always changing. But what it tries to do is serve as a benchmark, an indices for the top Defi tokens. And that's certainly what it has been this year.
00:04:06.736 - 00:04:11.974, Speaker B: Okay, there's my favorite chart. Zoom out to that three month time horizon.
00:04:12.022 - 00:04:15.358, Speaker A: Ryan, you want me to zoom out to three months? Okay, here we go.
00:04:15.444 - 00:04:31.550, Speaker B: Yeah. Still down versus ether. Right. So in the cycle of bitcoin to ether, to defi tokens, I think perhaps we are still in that ether. It's still eth time. Defi season is still on pause. Waiting for ether to actually maybe take the reins.
00:04:31.550 - 00:04:39.990, Speaker B: Question Mark. It's been down versus ether since all of March. DPI has been down versus ETH against ETH or all of March. That's pretty crazy interesting.
00:04:40.060 - 00:04:56.362, Speaker A: So we're maybe in this in between season. We're not quite sure what season we're in. We're just about to transition rather. Maybe to bitcoin, maybe to ETH, maybe to DPi. We'll see. David already knows. What's Chris Berninski saying these days? Look, I'm looking at a chart, but let me read the tweet first.
00:04:56.362 - 00:05:21.362, Speaker A: Our friend Chris Berninski is saying with bitcoin, at ETH, bitcoin, that's the ratio looking like it wants to push towards the 200 week moving average. Again, that places ETH around $2,500. Chris is bullish. He's doing some technical analysis. I think of Chris as a fundamentals investor, but he also dabbles in the technical analysis here and the trading. What's he telling us?
00:05:21.416 - 00:05:57.530, Speaker B: Yeah, chart Chris is the best Chris, in my opinion. We all want chart Chris, and he only gives it to us a very little bit. But, yeah, what he's saying is that the ETH BTC ratio is, from what he's saying, there seems to be a band that it is marching up a channel that is going up and to the right, and we are on the low end of that channel, perhaps going to the high end of that channel. And that high end of that channel is. The low end of that channel is roughly 0.3 ether per bitcoin. And then he thinks that perhaps we're going to that high end of the channel where there is zero point 42 ether per bitcoin.
00:05:57.530 - 00:06:07.570, Speaker B: And again, that puts ether at a dollar price of $2,500, which seems totally reasonable. Just $500 they'll get above previous all time highs. Seems about right.
00:06:07.720 - 00:06:23.234, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm not sure. So I like chart Chris, too. But I also like price prediction Chris. And Chris has always been calling for higher highs this cycle. A lot higher highs. Right. So, like, ten K Eth is not out of the question, certainly for Chris.
00:06:23.234 - 00:06:55.866, Speaker A: He's been bullish the whole way. All right, who's this lemonade alpha? This is somebody from the index co op, which actually manages the DPI and other associated tokens. But this is index co op, Daily revenue. And what's cool about this is index co op is a Dao that manages these indices, these sets that are put out of tokens that you can buy. Like DPI is one such token. And the revenue growth has been pretty crazy here. This is daily revenue growth.
00:06:55.866 - 00:07:02.722, Speaker A: And if these assets just continue, you can see that the potential for this to keep going up and up and up. What's your take here?
00:07:02.856 - 00:07:33.194, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there's so much dormant potential in the index co op, I think they have a really streamlined process. Bankless has been talking to them about an index. Question mark, what's going on there? The interesting story here is the ETH two X Fli token, which is brand new. The FLI, I believe, stands for a flexible, long index. Yeah. And so it's a single token that has a dollar price associated to it. And that dollar price goes up or down twice as fast as ether does.
00:07:33.194 - 00:08:05.142, Speaker B: It's a single token that leverages a two x to long position on ether, the asset. It's got some crazy DFI magic behind the scenes. So it's got a debt position in it as well. When you buy into it, you are buying into a debt position that is leveraged long ether. And this has really been part of the conversation in crypto, Twitter and dFI trading. Twitter and I believe there is over $10 million allocated into the two X ETh FLI token. And that's been growing up, growing very fast.
00:08:05.142 - 00:08:23.062, Speaker B: And so it's already become a very substantial part of index revenue. And I think this is just going to be the first of many leveraged index tokens. BTC next. Other DFI tokens next. Why not? Let's just get this FLI model out for everything.
00:08:23.136 - 00:08:24.622, Speaker A: Leverage everything. Yeah. Leverage everything.
00:08:24.676 - 00:08:26.480, Speaker B: Leverage everything. Yeah.
00:08:27.010 - 00:08:41.890, Speaker A: Why have one x the pain when you can have two x the pain and two x the gain? Of course. I'm sold. David. Sign me up. FLi product market fit. It is especially for this market. Guys, be careful when you're trading leverage products.
00:08:41.890 - 00:08:57.106, Speaker A: Of course. I hope that goes without saying. Here is not FLI. This is filecoin. Completely different. File coin, completely different. This is a fully diluted valuation I'm looking at of 383,000,000,000 billion.
00:08:57.218 - 00:09:01.290, Speaker B: Billion, yes, with a b. So here's a lesson.
00:09:01.710 - 00:09:03.580, Speaker A: This is bigger than EtH right now.
00:09:04.590 - 00:09:17.814, Speaker B: I think it's tied pretty closely to ETH, which is absolutely crazy. No, I think you're actually right. Yeah, no, you are right. Because it is higher than. Not. Wells Fargo, Walmart, the file.
00:09:17.862 - 00:09:19.354, Speaker A: Why do you say Wells Fargo, David?
00:09:19.402 - 00:09:55.274, Speaker B: Well, we're going to get to that fil, which is the file coin. Decentralized storage protocol has a higher market cap than Walmart. And this is a lesson in the difference between market cap and fully diluted market cap. There's not very many trading tokens out there. And yet, because people keep on buying them for some reason, if you take in the market cap, of all the non circulating tokens, you come up to almost $400 billion, making it, I think, like, the world's 17th most valuable asset. There's no way that this is worth that much.
00:09:55.312 - 00:09:56.442, Speaker A: This is just doesn't make sense.
00:09:56.496 - 00:10:07.150, Speaker B: It's a byproduct of bull market froth. It doesn't make sense. Yet people are buying into it. I would proceed with caution, is what I have to say with this.
00:10:07.300 - 00:11:18.360, Speaker A: Yeah, fully diluted valuation is an interesting metric because it can also depend on what the future issuance rate is of the asset. Right? So you have to factor that into. But in any case, the interesting thing about many protocols is that the issuance can be sort of changed. NBA Topshots I throwed a tweet about this, but its fully diluted market cap was something like 50 billion a couple of weeks ago. I'm not sure what it is now, and I know that's some news, but make sure you're checking the fully diluted valuation, these tokens and total supply, and ask yourself carefully if this is a good buy based on who has the current supply and what the future issuance is. $383,000,000,000 with a b does not seem like a good valuation to enter in for almost any asset in crypto besides maybe ETH, bitcoin, those sorts of things that have proven themselves. All right, David, we're going to get to the news in just a minute, but before we do, we want to tell folks about the sponsors that made this roll ups episode possible.
00:11:19.610 - 00:12:01.010, Speaker B: Gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange. I've been a customer of Gemini since I first got into crypto in 2017, and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells. Gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide. And on Gemini, there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets, including many of the hot DFI tokens, and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid Dai markets. Gemini just launched their earn program, where you can earn up to 7.4% interest on 26 various crypto assets. If you're tired of paying fees in DFI or you don't want to worry about DFI exploits, but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets, Gemini Earn is the product for you.
00:12:01.010 - 00:12:34.574, Speaker B: Another product I'm stoked to get my hands on is the Gemini crypto back credit card, which gives you 3% cash back on all of your purchases, but paid to you in your preferred crypto asset. When I get my Gemini credit card, I'm going to make sure that I get my cash back in ETH, so whenever I buy something, I get a little bit of eth bonus back to me. At the same time, you can open up a free account in under 3 minutes@gemini.com. GoBankless and if you trade more than $100 within the first 30 days after sign up you'll be gifted a free $15 bitcoin bonus. Check them out@gemini.com.
00:12:34.692 - 00:12:56.990, Speaker A: Gobankless Metamask is your Goto wallet for the bankless journey. If you're going bankless, you need metamask, period. Browser and mobile? Get them both. This is your tool to unlock the world of DFI. Here's my favorite part. Now you can swap tokens directly in metamask with a single swipe. This has got to be the easiest way to trade Ethereum tokens.
00:12:56.990 - 00:13:25.066, Speaker A: Choose a token, you own a token to exchange it with. Get your quotes. If you like what you see, you hit swap. That's it. What makes swap so useful is what happens behind the scenes. It compares dexs, aggregators and market makers to find you the best price with the lowest network fees and the least slippage. This means you can swap a wider range of tokens, and swaps can even automatically split up your trade to give you access to better liquidity.
00:13:25.066 - 00:13:54.822, Speaker A: You don't even have to think about it. Try it out. Download metamask for desktop or mobile now at Metamask IO and start swapping. All right, David, let's get to the news. The first one, this is hot ZK EVM in May. This is ZK sync. Okay, so just some context here, right? We've talked a lot about the difference between Ethereum side chains, which are not secured by Ethereum and Etha token, and Ethereum L2, which is secured anything.
00:13:54.822 - 00:14:15.374, Speaker A: Layer two is secured by the Ethereum network and Etha token. We've talked about the different roll ups that are L2. So optimistic roll ups is one, arbitram is another. There are other roll up solutions. And then we've also talked about ZK rollups. If you want more info on these things, go check out a podcast we did previously from Metallic. I think he explains the difference very well.
00:14:15.374 - 00:14:41.826, Speaker A: But the promised land for all of this, even according to Vitalik, the long term goal is to have an EVM. So that provides the expressiveness of the Ethereum main net inside of a Zk roll up. That's kind of the promised land for scalability. And here's ZK sync talking about presenting an update on that, potentially a Zk EvM in May. What's this about, David?
00:14:41.938 - 00:15:27.474, Speaker B: Yeah, this gets into cryptographic magic, which is a little bit beyond me, but they are implementing a main net version of ZKsync, which is much more full feature than I think we initially expected becoming this year, which is kind of crazy. Included in this is nfts are available on ZK sync, which is not something that I thought was anywhere close because nfts are harder with ZK rollups. But the fact that this is getting announced sometime soon is pretty crazy. The through line here is there's always going to be some sort of tug of war between something like optimistic roll ups and something like ZK roll ups, and each one is going to provide its own benefits and merits at some sort of timeline. It seems like this timeline is maybe getting moved up.
00:15:27.672 - 00:15:55.042, Speaker A: Yeah, it's awesome, because all of these L2 solutions are competing. They're rushing to get out the door and to develop and build on top of it. So the public testnet for ZK sync is in May 2021, Mainet August 2021. I haven't looked into all the details, not sure how full featured it's going to be, but it is exciting nonetheless. The prospect of a ZK roll up with an evm inside of it. Let's just talk about Ethereum's L2. Diversify.
00:15:55.042 - 00:16:33.926, Speaker A: Put out this fire tweet which just puts a bunch of logos on the screen and categorizes these, you know, wallets. Swap everybody in the Ethereum ecosystem that is working on L2. Specifically, David, if I'm a competitor and I'm looking at this slide, right, maybe that gets to our meme of the week hint. We'll talk about that later. If I'm looking at this slide, this just looks like I'm not just competing with Ethereum, I'm competing with the entire Ethereum ecosystem. That's pretty hard. Those network effects are pretty entrenched.
00:16:33.926 - 00:16:36.570, Speaker A: What are you getting from this image here?
00:16:36.640 - 00:17:12.166, Speaker B: Yeah, the cool thing is that they actually have, granted, they have multiple logos in different spots, right? So loopering, you see that in infrastructure. You also see it in wallets, you also see it in exchange. You also see it in payments. That's actually kind of one of the cool things about loopering, is it does all of these things, and so we're kind of double counting here. But it's also one of the powers of composability and just expressiveness in l two s why expressiveness in ZK sync is so powerful. One, l two can do multiple things. Ethereum people have been chanting this for years now.
00:17:12.166 - 00:17:30.234, Speaker B: The network effects on Ethereum, it's almost too late. And I can't say that it is too late because I don't know the future. But like you said, imagine having to reconstruct all of this stuff, which is being built out in so many different directions by different teams. You can't keep up. Can't keep up.
00:17:30.272 - 00:18:08.194, Speaker A: David, you know what I think is a good heuristic? It's kind of the ten x rule, right? Which is like in order to get an ecosystem or people to switch something, the technology has to be a ten X improvement. Bitcoin is ten x improvement over any sort of store of value in the real world. Gold. Ethereum, I would argue, is a ten X improvement on bitcoin, right? With its expressivity, its programmability, with its defi ecosystem, with proof of stake, with all of these things, ten X. I'm struggling to see the next ten X improvement on Ethereum in the current crop. Right. So I do think if there is a successor to Ethereum, it'll probably look a lot different than Ethereum.
00:18:08.194 - 00:18:16.170, Speaker A: Like we might not even see it coming, or we might even call it an eth killer. That's sort of a rule of thumb, I've thought. But of course, it doesn't seem like that in the bull run.
00:18:16.240 - 00:18:30.720, Speaker B: I think the way that we ten X Ethereum is on Ethereum, not replacing Ethereum, it's something like the app layer, right? If we want to improve of what make Ethereum ten x better, it's going to come out of the app layer. And that's kind of the whole point.
00:18:31.170 - 00:19:00.300, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. All right, PayPal. PayPal launching crypto checkout service. That means all PayPal customers, 29 million merchants as well, will be able to receive funds in crypto. So basically what this is, I understand that you have eth, you have bitcoin, you have litecoin, things like that. You can just use those currencies in your PayPal wallet and check out any PayPal merchant. 30 million of them, almost.
00:19:00.300 - 00:19:02.394, Speaker A: How big is this?
00:19:02.592 - 00:19:29.202, Speaker B: This is huge. This just makes the usability of these crypto assets as money far better. We can finally check out with crypto. This is now the thing. We can now check out with crypto with the PayPal integration. And so being bankless, but also purchasing something while you're just shopping is now done on PayPal. Right? So you can hold all your crypto money and then you can go buy your thing and you can pay with your crypto money.
00:19:29.202 - 00:19:59.606, Speaker B: It's absolutely fantastic. Interestingly, there's still some improvement that needs to be done, I think, in the marketing, because if you look at the picture that they use, they have the XRP icon in there along with bitcoin and litecoin. For some reason, people still think that we want to pay in litecoin when we don't we would like to instead pay with USDC and die. I do believe they have USDC, but I don't believe that they have die, but not going to knock them. Nice job, Paypal. Keep it going. How about some ERC 20 tokens? Let's get those, more of those integrated.
00:19:59.798 - 00:20:18.654, Speaker A: This is the DfI mullet thesis, right? Which is the fintech in front and DFI in the back. And that's exactly what PayPal is building. They're building on crypto rails. ERC 20s are coming. That's next. Stablecoins virtually guaranteed after this move. David, let's talk about this.
00:20:18.654 - 00:20:33.862, Speaker A: Actually, I said this whole section was news. It's releases, isn't it? We're talking about all the releases that happened. Introducing element. David, what is element? Element Phi. Got some big investors behind it. Is this a cool new defi primitive defi thing? What is.
00:20:33.916 - 00:20:58.714, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. New defi money. Lego. And so I tried to figure out how this totally works and I didn't really get too far. So I'm just going to read out the section that I think is important. The element protocol at its core works by splitting the base asset positions. And so think of a collateralized lending application like compound or AAvE, splitting the base asset positions, ETH, BTC, USDC into two distinct separate tokens.
00:20:58.714 - 00:21:46.030, Speaker B: The principal token, the deposit, the collateral and the yield token, the upcoming interest. And so there's now two tokens as a result of your deposits. And so this splitting mechanism allows users to sell their principal as a fixed rate income position, further leveraging or increasing exposure to the interest without any liquidation risk. The competitive activity along with custom curve built. A custom curve built on balancer v two is what drives the high fixed yield markets, bringing liquidity to fixed income yield while minimizing slippage and fees as the discount decreases, ultimately of opening the door to a number of new Defi primitives. So more surface area is my takeaway. Now, instead of just like depositing collateral into Aave and then that being a position, now we are more granularly able to.
00:21:46.030 - 00:21:54.910, Speaker B: Are we talking about the principal of that position or the yield of that position? And which one of those do we want to build off of? Now we have tokens to build off of each. So that's pretty cool.
00:21:55.060 - 00:22:18.002, Speaker A: Yeah. Fixed rate income markets. We have a lot of variable interest rates. If you deposit an ave, right, your interest could be 5% one day, it could be 10% the next could be 2% the next. Right. Getting to fixed income rate assets is important. It's all part of the movement that we're seeing in defi, which is speed running traditional finance.
00:22:18.002 - 00:22:31.462, Speaker A: So that's what's happening next. Speaking of which, optimistic ethereum L2 synthetics on L2, they've now integrated staking. What I think is cool about this is if you look at sort of metamask. Look at this, David, you got metamask.
00:22:31.606 - 00:22:34.590, Speaker B: Awesome switch networks, right?
00:22:34.660 - 00:23:09.910, Speaker A: So in metamask, where you're on the Ethereum main net, you could just swap over to optimism. Synthetics is there now you can stake with synthetics on the optimistic roll ups. The cool thing about all this stuff, especially with optimistic roll ups and arbitram roll ups, and this sort of thing is everything that you use today in defi just works right out of the box. So your metamask wallet, like Ledger, all of this stuff is just going to work. And it's the same protocols, you know, and love, but fast. Ux is going to be great. So this is in production right now.
00:23:09.910 - 00:23:22.474, Speaker A: Synthetix, of course, has been kind of pioneering the way with optimism. And next is uniswap. They're going to be on there, too. So pretty exciting, I think, in the world of Ethereum layer, too. Yeah.
00:23:22.512 - 00:23:59.186, Speaker B: This little gif is just a really good job of explaining how l two s work. It's going to be a contract on Ethereum where you send your money, and when you put it in that contract, it sends it over to the l two. And then you just switch your metamask. You point your metamask to a different implementation of the EVM. One will be the OEVM if it's on optimistic roll ups, and you're just pointing to a new chain. And the cool thing is that chain has the same assurances that ethereum does, and now you don't have to use any new infrastructure. You went through the portal and now you're on the other side, and now your money and your transactions are instant and cheap.
00:23:59.186 - 00:24:14.800, Speaker B: And it's the same infrastructure that we are all familiar with. It's one thing to build out scalable l two s. It's another thing to make the UI and UX seamless. And the fact that we can use and recycle all of our same infrastructure is really awesome.
00:24:15.330 - 00:24:36.366, Speaker A: Can't wait. All right, Faye Labs. Faye had a genesis this week, still in process. As we're recording this. Faye is kind of a stablecoin. It's a different take on a stablecoin, similar in some respects to Maker, except rather than sort of collateral being controlled by individual CDP creators. It's actually controlled by the protocol.
00:24:36.366 - 00:25:12.858, Speaker A: There's a lot of detail here and honestly, a lot of complexity here. We have covered all of this in an alpha leak that we sent out to bankless premium members. We sent that out the day this thing launched. The cool opportunity, to the extent it still exists, is you can actually deposit your eth into the Faye contract. You get Faye, but you're also rewarded in tribe genesis tokens. These are the governance tokens for the Faye protocol. I know a number of folks in the bankless community have tried this out and used this and are excited for this kind of quasi elements of a fair launch.
00:25:12.858 - 00:25:49.242, Speaker A: The governance community getting distributed to the early genesis believers of the project. I'm not sure where Faye ends up. There are a ton of stablecoin solutions these days, David, but we're super excited to see the innovation in stablecoins, because ultimately we have to move from stablecoins like USDC and tether to crypto backed stablecoins that are 100% trustless and decentralized. And this new crop seems to be moving in that direction. Things like Rye. You said this last week, Rye is being a real stablecoin rather than crypto dollars. So it's exciting to see these sorts of things.
00:25:49.376 - 00:26:13.540, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. And it's just fitting in a thesis that what can be built will be built on Ethereum, and this is not built yet. I believe the contract will finish receiving ether by end of my Saturday. End of us Saturday. And so you, as a listener to this on Friday, have roughly one and a half more days to figure out if you want to be a part of this or not.
00:26:14.630 - 00:26:16.822, Speaker A: All right, David, you ready to get to news?
00:26:16.876 - 00:26:17.686, Speaker B: Let's do it.
00:26:17.788 - 00:26:18.806, Speaker A: What are we starting with?
00:26:18.908 - 00:26:21.480, Speaker B: Are we finally announcing? We're announcing it.
00:26:22.170 - 00:26:22.566, Speaker A: All right.
00:26:22.588 - 00:26:23.640, Speaker B: We sold out.
00:26:26.570 - 00:26:30.422, Speaker A: Bankless, acquired by Wells Fargo. Was the headline published?
00:26:30.486 - 00:26:32.330, Speaker B: Congratulations, Ryan.
00:26:33.630 - 00:26:49.278, Speaker A: All right, so this was published on April 1. Okay, April 1, right. Keep that in mind. And the title of this bankless article. I sent it out. Bankless acquired by Wells Fargo. Dear bankless nation, huge news today.
00:26:49.364 - 00:26:49.854, Speaker B: Huge news.
00:26:49.892 - 00:27:08.182, Speaker A: Break up with your bank has been our mantra since day one. But today, I'm happy to add a slight addendum to that mantra. Break up with your bank and join Wells Fargo. Bankless has been acquired by Wells Fargo. Okay, so I sent this email out because it's April 1. It's April Fool's Day. Guys sent this out.
00:27:08.182 - 00:27:17.910, Speaker A: And look, man, I didn't think it was super serious. There were a lot of hints that this is all a joke.
00:27:18.510 - 00:27:20.490, Speaker B: Not everyone got the joke.
00:27:22.190 - 00:27:37.466, Speaker A: I know. Yeah. We've been recording basically all day today. We've had, like, two big, long episodes, and I barely got into my email, but I looked at it a couple of times, and my email is wrecked.
00:27:37.498 - 00:27:38.510, Speaker B: We got some haters.
00:27:40.770 - 00:27:54.942, Speaker A: Well, it's a combination. So some people are like, I was mad at first, but then I got the joke. Well played, guys. That's probably 75% of people, and 20% of people are just like, fu. You guys sold out. This is terrible. Unsubscribe.
00:27:54.942 - 00:28:02.360, Speaker A: Cancel my subscription. I hate this. Right? It's funny because there's another 5% that are like, congratulations, guys. Well done.
00:28:03.210 - 00:28:08.402, Speaker B: Pat yourself on the back. You made it. How much did we sell banquets for, Ryan?
00:28:08.546 - 00:28:15.370, Speaker A: Oh, my God. Well, it wasn't even disclosed in this email in this newsletter, so. Undisclosed.
00:28:15.790 - 00:28:18.954, Speaker B: Can't even imagine what Wells Fargo would want even to do with us.
00:28:19.072 - 00:28:29.342, Speaker A: Wells Fargo has been the trope for us from the very beginning of being sort of the bank that we're trying to get away from. Nothing against Wells Fargo. I actually have a Wells Fargo account.
00:28:29.396 - 00:28:30.062, Speaker B: Yeah, so do I.
00:28:30.116 - 00:28:39.074, Speaker A: Funny. Okay. And then there's this picture of you standing in front of a Wells Fargo that you use as your profile shot, which. That is.
00:28:39.112 - 00:28:47.540, Speaker B: The new leak information is that, oh, David's profile picture is actually in front of a Wells Fargo bank. That is true. That was not a joke. That is a real thing.
00:28:47.850 - 00:29:11.978, Speaker A: So, guys, if you're part of that 20%, who's angry about this? Don't be. This is an April fool's joke. Bankless is not selling any of its media assets. Will never to Wells Fargo or any other bank. This is not what this movement is about. If you're part of the 75% who got the joke? Thank you. I'm not sure it's too early to know whether I regret sending this out or not.
00:29:11.978 - 00:29:21.134, Speaker A: I think it was okay. But we definitely lost some people. And if you're part of the 5% congratulating us, like, I don't know why, don't congratulate us.
00:29:21.172 - 00:29:22.302, Speaker B: We don't deserve that.
00:29:22.436 - 00:29:35.182, Speaker A: Yeah, we don't deserve that. Anyway, it's good to see that the 20% of the bankless community as well, is holding us accountable for not selling out on our core beliefs here. David, optimism.
00:29:35.326 - 00:29:36.130, Speaker B: Back to real news.
00:29:36.200 - 00:29:50.860, Speaker A: Back to the real news. Okay, that was some of the fake news David alluded to. Back to real news. Optimism launch moving from March to July. Okay, so we're talking about how bullish we are in L2. But now here is optimism announcing another delay. Are you worried about this?
00:29:51.950 - 00:30:14.058, Speaker B: Well, yes and no. I wanted optimism in March. I was calling it optimistic March. But what I've gathered is that when they do finally release it in July, it's not going to be the same release that we were going to have in March. It's going to be with everyone. There's going to be a full suite of applications in July. That's my takeaway.
00:30:14.058 - 00:30:32.738, Speaker B: That is not something I verified with the optimistic team. But that's what I've gained from reading through the, through lines in their posts, is that when they do go live, it's going to be with a whole entire just suite of fun things to do. I will be patient and I will excitedly anticipate their launch in July.
00:30:32.914 - 00:31:05.454, Speaker A: Yes, well, the Uniswap team put the pressure on, too. They said Uniswap VC is launching May 3, and then optimism shortly after. An optimistic version of Uniswap V three shortly after. So hopefully shortly means sometime in July, and we will see, hopefully it's even stronger launch at that point in time. David, this has been kind of the news of the week. Visa now settling payments in USDC, of course, is a stablecoin on Ethereum. Settling payments on Ethereum.
00:31:05.454 - 00:31:28.706, Speaker A: They're doing this through the crypto.com visa card. I guess previously the settlement of the crypto.com visa transactions happened in the old traditional banking system. And this is here Visa saying, hey, it's okay. Why don't we just settle USDC on Ethereum, on the Ethereum mainnet through our custodian. I think they're using Anchorage as their custodian.
00:31:28.706 - 00:32:03.474, Speaker A: But David, this is just like, I think it's a small step in some ways, but it's a highly significant step because this is the largest payments company, largest credit card processing company in the world, effectively settling transactions for the first time on the public Ethereum network. To me, it means Visa is becoming a sidechain of Ethereum. Of course, people will say, like, that's hyperbole. You can't say that. You're exaggerating things. But this is how it starts, man. It starts with one settlement and then what's it going to be next? What are we going to see next?
00:32:03.592 - 00:32:38.122, Speaker B: Yeah, and it's not just like Visa would be like, oh, let's gut all of our old infrastructure. We use Ethereum now. No, that's not what's going on. Perhaps that's what happens in 40 years, maybe 20 years, maybe less. But the way that this starts is that Visa puts one transaction a day on Ethereum to settle up, which is where they are starting. And then they will learn about how they can use Ethereum block space to manage payments. And Ethereum block space is really advantageous for people that want to settle payments.
00:32:38.122 - 00:33:04.470, Speaker B: And so it starts with one transaction a day. But Visa will find a way to make use of Ethereum's block space to better suit their offering that they have as a payment provider. And perhaps that even includes going on to an l, two roll up or doing just other things. And so this is the foot in the door that will, in my opinion, lead to just a much longer, larger, more rich relationship between visa and Ethereum.
00:33:04.970 - 00:33:37.310, Speaker A: Yeah, I think so, too. And some people, when I tweeted this out, said, but what about the Eth gas fees? Here's the thing. A company like Visa doesn't care about a $50 gas fee when it's settling billions in transaction volume. Think of the Visa network as an entire side chain, and in one transaction on Ethereum, they can literally settle billions worth of stablecoin value. Right? So they don't care about a $50 transaction here or there. This is an entire side chain doing the settlement.
00:33:37.390 - 00:34:12.640, Speaker B: Yeah, and I think that might come from the misconception that if you swipe your Visa card, then Visa has to pay, like a $50 transaction on Ethereum. No, that's not how it works. When 10,000 people swipe their Visa card over the course of the day, then that all gets bundled up, and that's one transaction on Ethereum. That's what the Visa payments network is. It collects and bundles and aggregates and then settles on whatever settlement infrastructure they have available to them. Usually that's banks, but now it's also Ethereum. Visa is going.
00:34:14.370 - 00:34:48.166, Speaker A: Absolutely. This is back to something we've said for a while, is that transactions on the Ethereum network will become more and more economically dense, so more and more value per transaction will be settled. All right, David, let's move to this next tweet. Well, actually, this is sort of a bit of news. So tether just released some assurances that they are fully backed. This has always been a question, is tether fully backed or is it not? Now, this is an independent auditor saying, yes, they are. I'm not sure who this independent auditor is.
00:34:48.166 - 00:34:49.622, Speaker A: It almost doesn't even matter.
00:34:49.676 - 00:34:52.470, Speaker B: Who do we have to trust this independent auditor, Ryan?
00:34:52.550 - 00:35:20.030, Speaker A: That's the point. We have to trust this independent auditor. You contrast that to another stablecoin, which is the die stablecoin and all of the backing is basically transparent and open and evident and auditable on the ethereum blockchain. And that happens every 13 seconds. Every time a new ethereum block is released. We have the assurances that Dai is backed. We don't need auditors.
00:35:20.030 - 00:35:41.610, Speaker A: I just thought this was an interesting juxtaposition between tether, which is kind of in this in between place of not really being defi. It's sort of like a tokenized version of traditional finance, and Dai, which is purely a defi protocol. And, man, it's so cool that we could show the difference in stark contrast.
00:35:42.750 - 00:35:48.150, Speaker B: With tether, you have to trust the auditor, but with Dai, you are the auditor.
00:35:48.230 - 00:35:48.522, Speaker A: Right.
00:35:48.576 - 00:35:50.422, Speaker B: Well, where does the power lie?
00:35:50.566 - 00:35:58.650, Speaker A: Well said. That's a good line. All right, David, let's talk about what Ave is doing. They've got some L2 plans as well. What are their plans?
00:35:58.730 - 00:36:09.118, Speaker B: Yeah, they are integrating Ave on polygon, which seems to be like the billionth integration I've seen happen on Polygon. For some reason, everyone seems to really want to deploy on Polygon.
00:36:09.214 - 00:36:11.138, Speaker A: It's here in a work.
00:36:11.224 - 00:36:23.666, Speaker B: It's true. And so I guess congratulations to Polygon. And I'm looking forward to moving my Ave position over to Polygon because every time I do anything on Ave, it costs like $150, which is ridiculous.
00:36:23.858 - 00:36:37.222, Speaker A: Yeah, that's no fun. Got to go to L2. All right, David, let's talk nft stuff. Man. Did you see the SNL on NFTs? This is actually a great explainer. Like, my wife watched this. I was like, if you want to understand nfTs, don't listen to bankless.
00:36:37.222 - 00:36:40.526, Speaker A: Watch this SNL skit. Should I play?
00:36:40.548 - 00:37:02.690, Speaker B: It hurts. Yeah, let's watch a short little clip. Okay, now what the hell's an NFT? Apparently cryptocurrency. Everyone's making so much money. Can you please explain what's an NFT? I said, what the hell's an NFT? It's like real life monopoly. Everyone is doing it. Like, gronkowski, can you please help me make an NFT?
00:37:04.710 - 00:37:41.038, Speaker A: Son, I didn't understand a word you just said. That's amazing, dude. So it's like, got a version of Janet Yellen, and people in the classroom are trying to explain to her what nfts are. And the explanations get increasingly complex but also increasingly accurate, surprisingly like SNL writers. You guys understand what an NFT is? Maybe we've got some bankless listeners in the audience, but, yeah, it's just a great three and a half minute explanation of nfts for mainstream. So look, if we're on SNL, it means we're mainstream, right?
00:37:41.124 - 00:37:52.958, Speaker B: Yeah, but does that also mean it's the top? Question mark. People have been saying it's the NFT top for, like, months now, so I'm not convinced. I think the NFTs are just in the beginning of integrating their way into public consciousness.
00:37:53.134 - 00:38:10.582, Speaker A: Well, Michael Jordan agrees with you. So Michael Jordan just joined a $305,000,000 investment in NBA topshot. So this is the NFT platform, the NFT train, produced by dapper Labs. So what's your take on this, David?
00:38:10.726 - 00:38:38.878, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't like, I've been cordial about flow in the past, but I'm losing my patience. If it's a l one blockchain, it needs to have nation state level censorship resistance, and this does not have that. And therefore these are not nfts. And so I'm worried about the future of dapper labs and the future of nfts if they begin to be associated by dapper labs on flow.
00:38:39.054 - 00:38:45.682, Speaker A: I'm not worried about the future of dapper labs because it looks like they are just minting revenue right now. So I think they're doing quite a bit.
00:38:45.736 - 00:38:48.718, Speaker B: I'm speaking regulatory landscape.
00:38:48.894 - 00:39:38.966, Speaker A: Oh, interesting. I think that it'd be great to have some money from dapper labs to sort of articulate the points on this and have a discussion on it. Certainly in the past, the flow blockchain has been touted as an Ethereum killer, in some ways, an ethereum alternative. I'm not sure if that's the posture they would take now, but sort of the reason cryptokitties didn't work, we needed. Flow is sort of the thing, but I think that there's maybe a more nuanced take, and we should have some folks from dapper labs on at some time to kind of explain what top shots is. One thing I will say that's awesome is they are getting more people at least talking about nfts, talking about crypto. Now, whether they're nfts or not, maybe you might debate, but it's certainly a gateway of some kind.
00:39:39.148 - 00:39:42.354, Speaker B: Sure. They're not nfts. They're fake nfts.
00:39:42.482 - 00:39:46.278, Speaker A: There you go. It's David Hoffman. All right, let's talk about an ethereum story.
00:39:46.364 - 00:39:48.518, Speaker B: A real nf y equals k. All.
00:39:48.524 - 00:39:49.398, Speaker A: Right, what's this story?
00:39:49.484 - 00:40:30.006, Speaker B: Yeah, x times y equals k. That's the uniswap v three animation that came out from a people pleaser, which the animation itself pleased a lot of people so true to her name. And I did a little put on my journalist hat and I went out and I interviewed Layton Cusack, who helped form Pleaserdao, which generated enough capital to put over half a million dollars as a bid down on people pleaser's NFT. And also people pleaser is donating all of that money to charity to help support marginal communities. And so I think the through line here is that this is really just a fantastic story of what makes Ethereum so great. And I give that summary, Ryan, you're scrolling down to it right here. Okay.
00:40:30.006 - 00:41:28.774, Speaker B: X times y equals k was sold for over half a million dollars because it leveraged the best of what Ethereum has to offer. Capital formation in the DAO, a financial asset in the NFT, cultural expression, in the animation and market values based on human values, which is the legitimacy. And so if you scroll down just a little bit more, I put a graphic in there that I think sums it up nicely. I use this image of a camera to illustrate what's going on here. A camera has a lens in it which focuses light, and it allows people that perceive beauty to focus their perception through a lens and allows them to see an object that they find beautiful. And what Ethereum does is allowed people to all come together in a Dao and focus their capital on purchasing this NFT, which they found had market value and that they wanted. And so this story, the through line here, is that Ethereum enabled people to get what they wanted to get done that was aligned with what they wanted to see in the world.
00:41:28.774 - 00:41:30.600, Speaker B: And I think it's a pretty cool through line.
00:41:31.050 - 00:41:44.602, Speaker A: Super cool. I'm interested to see what they do with this NFT. It seems like the people pleaserdao maybe had the idea of creating almost like a digital museum of artifacts from the early defi history, this being one such artifact.
00:41:44.666 - 00:41:52.560, Speaker B: Are they going to have a capital formation event for further capital to purchase further defi art? Question mark.
00:41:52.930 - 00:41:55.246, Speaker A: I know somebody who wants to get in on that.
00:41:55.348 - 00:41:56.194, Speaker B: I want in on that.
00:41:56.232 - 00:42:23.894, Speaker A: I'll be covering that. All right, David. NFT marketplace OpenSea plants. We're in the NFT section, by the way, in case you guys didn't notice, NFT Marketplace OpenSea plans to integrate L2 protocol, immutable x. Excited about immutable X, because this is a way to scale nfts in a decentralized way. So this, in some ways, if you were worried about flow, this is kind of the answer to the flow killer. It's backed by Ethereum, it's secured by Ethereum.
00:42:23.894 - 00:42:52.202, Speaker A: Maybe flow is a different thing. I don't know if they kill each other, but yeah, it's definitely the Ethereum native answer to flow. It looks like Opensea is planning to integrate immutable into their protocol. When we talked to OpenSea, Devin from OpenSea, they seemed really open to integrating everything, though I'm not sure that they had a bias in one direction or the other. I'm sure they're going to have flow on there. I'm sure they're going to have immutable x. I'm sure they're going to have every other chain that has so called NFts.
00:42:52.266 - 00:43:11.370, Speaker B: Yeah, Opensea is just an NFT explorer, right? And so natural really as mutable X, which is a very hyped NFT optimized l two. OpenC is going to be able to take nfts that are on your immutable xl two and display that as assets that you own on Openc. So that's pretty cool.
00:43:11.520 - 00:43:43.538, Speaker A: David, I'm going to burn through these last ones because want to get to takes with some remaining time, but bitcoin. Goldman is introducing bitcoin to their high net worth individuals feel like Goldman Sachs always knows where the gold is, always knows where the money is. Looks like they can see the writing on the wall. Large high net worth individuals want to hold assets like bitcoin, so they're offering them that service. I always feel like I see a headline like this in most bull cycles. Goldman is doing something in crypto. Maybe they're for real this time.
00:43:43.538 - 00:44:07.210, Speaker A: This is one on regulation. But Coinbase has paid a fine to the CFTC for some purported wash trading and I guess a related story to this. I'm wondering if you could link them. Coinbase's direct listing again. They are ipoing they're going to list directly on the Nasdaq and that's actually planned for April 14, which very close. Didn't know. This is like breaking news.
00:44:07.210 - 00:44:12.746, Speaker A: I feel like where this is new as of for me today. Are those two bits of news related?
00:44:12.858 - 00:44:51.626, Speaker B: Yeah, probably. I'm guessing that Coinbase needs to come clean because it's about to go public. And so perhaps it made the mistake of allowing wash trading on its platform in its early days and so now it's atoning for its sins and so it's coming clean to Uncle Sam so it can go public. And I think this is a lesson in playing long term games. And so Coinbase, regrettably for a short period of time forgot to play long term games and now had to pay a fine. And so perhaps this is a lesson to be learned for every young upstarting project or company or whatever. If you don't play long term games from the very start, you're going to have to pay the fines in the future.
00:44:51.626 - 00:44:53.366, Speaker B: So play long term games.
00:44:53.558 - 00:45:16.942, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. All right, let's get to what's next. Is this is maybe the last news item, FTX. So that is a crypto exchange, a crypto bank, up and comer. Almost like a binance junior. That's what I think of FTX. They are getting their name put on the side of a stadium in Miami.
00:45:16.942 - 00:45:35.190, Speaker A: So a major sports stadium. Dude, you know what this reminds me of? Like, a banker play HSBC, slapping its name on the side of stadiums. Been doing that for a while. Like, other big banks do this all of the time. Is this just like a banker move or what is this?
00:45:35.260 - 00:45:48.730, Speaker B: Yeah, the difference here is that FTX is an unregulated offshore exchange that is serving us customers in ways that it should not. And so my mind goes to the Icarus metaphor, flying a little bit too close to the sun. Sam ban.
00:45:50.510 - 00:46:03.630, Speaker A: Now, us regulators have definitely heard of you if they're attending that stadium. David, let's get to takes in just a minute. But before we do, we want to tell you about the fantastic sponsors that made this roll ups episode possible.
00:46:03.700 - 00:46:39.226, Speaker B: Anklis is proud to be supported by Uniswap. Uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure. Instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans, Uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on Ethereum, which is what Ryan and I call a money robot. No human counterparties or centralized intermediaries, just autonomous code on Ethereum. Input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy. Something brand new in the Uniswap ecosystem is the Uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants. We have been saying this for a while, and we'll say it again.
00:46:39.226 - 00:47:07.282, Speaker B: Dows have money and they are in need of labor. If you think that you have something to contribute to the Uniswap Dow, apply for a grant to Uniswap. Just look at the size of the Uniswap treasury. It's almost $3 billion. This mountain of capital is looking for labor. Do you have something of value to contribute to the Uniswap dow? No matter how big or small your idea is, you can apply for a Uni grant@unigrants.org and help steer Uniswap in the direction that you think it should go.
00:47:07.282 - 00:47:47.678, Speaker B: That's exactly what we did to get Uniswap to be a sponsor for bankless, and you can do the same for your project. Thank you, Uniswap, for sponsoring bankless. Synthetix is Ethereum's decentralized derivatives liquidity protocol. What does that mean? Synthetix is a platform for creating and trading synthetic assets, which are assets that are priced via an oracle. Rather than bids or asks, traders can use the quinta exchange, which hosts and trades all of the synthetic assets created by synthetics. Traders on quinta can trade synthetic tokens like SBtc s oil or SDFI. Because Quenta is powered by synthetix, traders experience zero slippage on their trades.
00:47:47.678 - 00:48:14.870, Speaker B: No, I didn't mean low slippage. I meant no slippage because that is the power of the synthetics platform. No slippage on your trades. You can also easily short assets with isy, which are synthetic assets that move inversely to their target asset. Synthetix isn't just for traders. Developers can build on synthetics to access the infinite liquidity offered by synthetic assets. Or investors can stake collateral to the protocol and earn fees that the protocol collects.
00:48:14.870 - 00:48:32.510, Speaker B: If you're a trader and you're looking for a trading platform not found in the legacy world, check out quinta IO. If you are a developer or you just want to earn yield on your collateral, go to www synthetics IO, where you can stake your SNX or ETH and earn fees from synthetics.
00:48:36.190 - 00:48:38.350, Speaker A: All right, David, you ready to get into the hot takes?
00:48:38.420 - 00:48:40.154, Speaker B: Hot takes. Let's do it. My favorite.
00:48:40.282 - 00:48:52.322, Speaker A: All right. Niraj has always got some hot takes. So he's talking about nfts and he's saying, like, who's buying all this shit? And this is the response. Maybe you should read it and give me the interpretation here.
00:48:52.376 - 00:49:17.898, Speaker B: Yeah, I thought this was really interesting. This is a really good point. What if art people bought stupid shit all the time already, but blockchain lets us see how large that market actually is. Like, wow, actually a really important point. All these stupid nfts that are being bought. Well, there's a lot of stupid art out there too. Maybe the only difference is that it's actually just transparent and we get to see all the stupid shit that people buy because it's art.
00:49:17.898 - 00:49:19.882, Speaker B: Like, maybe that's what's going on.
00:49:20.016 - 00:49:29.582, Speaker A: You're just saying who's to say what's stupid and what's not? Sure, yeah, because the market kind of decides, although a job rule fire festival painting. Sounds pretty stupid to me.
00:49:29.636 - 00:49:32.110, Speaker B: Sounds pretty stupid to me. But not to draw a rule.
00:49:33.330 - 00:49:53.782, Speaker A: And it sold for 122k. So there's an element of values in the eye of the beholder, particularly for nfts. What's this next take? Oh, dude, this was on a great Reddit thread that's actually, I think, inspired by our ultrasound money post. And Vitalik kind of led the thread on ethereum. But what's the take here?
00:49:53.916 - 00:50:43.718, Speaker B: Yeah, the take is that this is from bobot on our ethereum. Is it possible that proof of work was needed as a way to create the preconditions of token value and decentralization that make for a successful proof of stake? This is something that we've mentioned on the bankless program here and later. Proof of stake is not actually a distribution mechanism, it's a security mechanism. Proof of work is, by proxy of its inefficiencies, a distribution mechanism. Because bitcoin is secured by sell pressure on BTC, miners have to sell the BTC they make, and this is a distribution mechanism. Bitcoiners like this because it prevents any one miner from just having a monopoly on not having to sell any of their BTC. And so the second half of this take is that he or she says.
00:50:43.718 - 00:51:27.330, Speaker B: I keep thinking back to Netflix spending many years mailing people dvds as a way to build a streaming service. They needed an early iteration on the concept that bridged the older, more physical world into the newer, more virtual one. And so when we were renting dvds from Netflix and they would mail them to us, it's because literally the bandwidth of the Internet wasn't good enough, and so they just mailed us the dvd. And so the corollary here is that proof of work is this kind of old system that's rooted into the physical world that's not yet optimized for the virtual world. But now, with proof of stake, we do have that optimizations where we can, instead of mailing dvds, we can just start streaming. I like the parallel here.
00:51:27.480 - 00:51:48.774, Speaker A: Yeah, I like that analogy. I'm with it. I got it. Let's go to the next one. So this is from Jacob from Twitter. So just a reminder, Vitalik coined Ethereum as the Lego of crypto finance in 2014. Here, David, I thought you came up with a money Lego meme, but apparently Vitalik front ran you in 2014.
00:51:48.774 - 00:51:50.438, Speaker A: Lego of crypto finance.
00:51:50.534 - 00:51:52.474, Speaker B: Yeah, money Legos is more catchy, though.
00:51:52.592 - 00:52:18.894, Speaker A: Yeah, that's true. You perfected it. Well done, sir. Second, the white paper calls out DFI as the first category of applications for Ethereum. And I think his point is this. Critics will tell you that Ethereum's narrative keeps changing and quote, no, you just caught up, sweetheart, he says, nice little sassy there. Look, man, I've never understood that critique, that Ethereum's narrative keeps changing because, no, it hasn't.
00:52:18.894 - 00:52:58.202, Speaker A: It's always been about defi, always from the very beginning. Hopefully, if you're listening to, like, go back and read the white paper, these are use cases that Vitalik talked about in the white paper. Decentralized finance use cases that are coming to fruition have come to fruition. Money Legos was predicted in 2014. This has always been partially about a decentralized money system, money platform, a bankless money system. DFI was always part of the vision. I think one thing that might be true from the critics perspective is that the eth narrative, eth, the asset, that narrative has changed.
00:52:58.202 - 00:53:38.014, Speaker A: And to that, I would say, okay, fair enough, right? When ETH was presented, it was very much presented as an asset to pay for Ethereum transactions, almost like a cryptocurrency to pay for a commodity. And the commodity is Ethereum blockspace. That's changed. But the reason it's changed is because people started using it as money, David. That's why it changed. It changed because the use case changed, essentially. It didn't change because some mastermind is trying to pull one over on you and sneak in new narratives, right? And look, the bitcoin narrative has changed as well over the years in the same way.
00:53:38.014 - 00:53:39.438, Speaker A: So what's your take on this?
00:53:39.524 - 00:54:01.822, Speaker B: Yeah, I think people that point out Ethereum's changing narratives have it backwards. Narratives don't lead crypto systems. Crypto systems lead narratives. When we created the Internet as humanity, we didn't know what we created. We had to discover what the Internet was. And the same thing with bitcoin. We didn't know what bitcoin was at Genesis.
00:54:01.822 - 00:54:21.850, Speaker B: We didn't know that there was going to be a civil war between block size over store of value, asset or cash payment. Bitcoin, we didn't know what that was going to become. We only knew it. In hindsight, the bitcoin narrative changes just as much as the Ethereum narrative. We are discovering what ethereum is. We are discovering what these things will be. We do not create them.
00:54:21.850 - 00:54:23.660, Speaker B: They happen to us.
00:54:24.270 - 00:54:30.960, Speaker A: Blockchains aren't created, they are discovered. Hasu quoted that from our Monday tweet. I think he's actually quoting Vitalik, as.
00:54:32.210 - 00:54:33.870, Speaker B: He'S always at the root of everything.
00:54:33.940 - 00:54:41.060, Speaker A: Dude, sorry. All right, tweet from Hayden Adams, who, by the way, we're having on the podcast soon.
00:54:41.670 - 00:54:45.940, Speaker B: Available today. Go watch it. Available today after you finish watching this.
00:54:46.790 - 00:55:02.994, Speaker A: Well, here's what he says. If you're building something valuable for the Uniswap ecosystem, consider replacing venture capital raises with a governance proposal. Wow. The Uniswap community will fund your project. Guys. You don't need a vc. You don't need capital from outside investors.
00:55:02.994 - 00:55:10.714, Speaker A: You can just apply for a Uniswap fund if you're building something related to the Uniswap ecosystem. Pretty cool. Yeah.
00:55:10.752 - 00:55:38.626, Speaker B: The fantastic thing is that Uniswap is just allowing builders to not have to sell part of their company. Uniswap has $2.7 billion denominated in uni tokens. So if that goes up, then the treasury goes up. $2.7 billion is effectively infinite money. I think this is part of the whole cool stuff about Ethereum is what does this enable? You don't have to sell out your company.
00:55:38.626 - 00:55:44.760, Speaker B: You can just go get free money from Uniswap. If you are built something that is in alignment with what the protocol wants.
00:55:45.290 - 00:55:48.130, Speaker A: Let'S talk about cool stuff. Cryptoculture is tight.
00:55:48.210 - 00:55:50.070, Speaker B: Cryptoculture is tight.
00:55:51.610 - 00:55:54.502, Speaker A: Why is that your take? Why is it tight? What's awesome about it?
00:55:54.636 - 00:56:06.134, Speaker B: We have funny jokes. We have funny memes. We have funny lingo. We have a good time. We don't have to sell our companies because crypto culture is tight. We just apply for grants. We exist on the Internet.
00:56:06.134 - 00:56:25.570, Speaker B: We have digital relationships. We are pioneering what will be, in my opinion, the future of culture, of humanity. And it's going to be digital. It's not going to be changing the legacy culture, the worldwide culture, because humans are moving online. And so we are pioneering digital culture, and it's really tight.
00:56:26.390 - 00:56:29.058, Speaker A: And we do not have to sell to Wells Fargo, and we don't have.
00:56:29.064 - 00:56:31.620, Speaker B: To sell to Wells Fargo. Who would do such a thing?
00:56:32.630 - 00:56:36.934, Speaker A: All right, David, let's talk. What are you excited about this week?
00:56:37.052 - 00:57:05.402, Speaker B: I'm excited about rugging the Fed. And this idea came to me when I was writing the market Monday piece, which was about the visa settling on Ethereum. And so this is how we slowly rug the Fed. And, Ryan, if you want to go into my article, I kind of gave a nice little illustration about what this means. And so visa is using Ethereum as its settlement layer. It's using USDC, but it doesn't always have to use USDC. Ryan, if you want to scroll down to that first graphic.
00:57:05.402 - 00:57:40.438, Speaker B: And so we have this visa just incorporating itself between its merchants. Coinbase bitpanda crypto.com blockfi settling USDC denominated payments on Ethereum. But visa is just a profit maximalist company. They will do what the people want and they will settle assets, even if they're not dollars, if the people want them. And so all of a sudden, instead of perhaps settling USDC, maybe we're settling Dai, maybe we're settling Rye. Maybe we're settling an algo stablecoin that has nothing to do with the Federal Reserve that's not pegged to the dollar.
00:57:40.438 - 00:58:08.190, Speaker B: And so this is how we rug pull the Fed. Like, first we get visa to settle us dollar payments on Ethereum. Then we get visa to settle perhaps dai on Ethereum. And then we get visa to settle something that has nothing to do with the Federal Reserve. And then if you scroll down to the last graphic, Ryan, then we have a new bankless one more. Then we have a new bankless infrastructure where visa is settling payments and it has nothing to do with the dollar or the Federal reserve. And that is how we re rug pull the Fed.
00:58:08.350 - 00:58:11.094, Speaker A: You know, my response to that is, David, tell me.
00:58:11.132 - 00:58:14.950, Speaker B: I'm excited. Don't tell them.
00:58:15.020 - 00:58:16.194, Speaker A: Quiet. Quiet.
00:58:16.242 - 00:58:17.794, Speaker B: Sir, this is the secret.
00:58:17.842 - 00:59:18.534, Speaker A: Not until our plan is closer to mean. But the good thing about this is, even if you very much believe in the central banking system in the US, I'm not sure that we have a lot of those listeners. But even if you do, let's say you do, isn't it a good thing that central banks around the world now have to compete for the people? Right? They don't, carte blanche, get to be our reserve currency. They actually have to compete with alternative store of values that the market has created, that the people have created from the ground up, that's going to be a net benefit. Even if the Fed doesn't get fully rugged, the fact that maybe there's the threat of them getting rugged makes a better central banking system, too. So even if you're not fully into the idea of the Fed rug pull, the presence of crypto is going to hold central banks more accountable. And this is a net good thing for society.
00:59:18.534 - 00:59:19.386, Speaker A: That's my take.
00:59:19.488 - 00:59:36.560, Speaker B: But also an extension out of the sovereign individual thesis where the ability to exit is new. And that is what crypto systems offer. And now we can finally exit from the Fed. Maybe you don't want to exit from the Fed, but like you just said, ryan, having that option is always advantageous to the people.
00:59:37.570 - 00:59:38.318, Speaker A: Absolutely.
00:59:38.484 - 00:59:40.574, Speaker B: All right, Ryan, what are you excited about?
00:59:40.772 - 01:00:01.878, Speaker A: David? I'm excited about the Hayden Adams podcast. This has been a year in the making, over twelve months in the making. We've been in Hayden's dms. We've been asking him publicly on Twitter. It's almost become a running joke because it's been like, hayden Adams from Uniswap. He is, of course, the creator of Uniswap when he coming on bankless. And he's always been like, oh, the time's not quite right.
01:00:01.878 - 01:00:17.994, Speaker A: Like soon, but not yet. It finally happened. We got him. We got Hayden Adams on the podcast. We actually just talked to him today. And this is a long podcast, two and a half hours long. But we go through the entire history of Uniswap from inception.
01:00:17.994 - 01:00:42.082, Speaker A: I think this is going to be a story that the history books will tell. Like in line with the start of Apple computer, the start of Microsoft. Right. Early Silicon Valley companies. This is a story for the ages. And so we wanted to chronicle it. Well, so we go through that history, and then we talk about uniswap v three, which Hayden thinks will be even more important to the world.
01:00:42.082 - 01:01:07.654, Speaker A: Like Uniswap V one. V two has been just the start on this journey. And he believes that v three is kind of the next chapter that's going to send Uniswap into the trillions in terms of volume, exceeding the s and P 500, exceeding Nasdaq, exceeding the traditional financial exchanges. So go watch it. David, I guess it's a question to you. I know you're editing. Busy editing after this podcast.
01:01:07.654 - 01:01:08.974, Speaker A: When's it coming out?
01:01:09.172 - 01:01:18.878, Speaker B: Right now. It's available right now. If you're watching this on YouTube, go watch it. But not before you watch the meme of the week, which comes next. Shall we get into that?
01:01:19.044 - 01:01:21.314, Speaker A: Yeah, let's get into the meme of the week. What are we looking at?
01:01:21.352 - 01:01:36.870, Speaker B: Yeah, so diversify. Put out that fantastic ethereum l two ecosystem. And they also released their Cardano ecosystem as well. Look at it. It's nothing. No, there's nothing there. There's a skeleton because Cardano doesn't have smart contracts.
01:01:38.170 - 01:01:42.120, Speaker A: Are we being mean here? Is this sweet meme or is there a lesson here?
01:01:42.570 - 01:02:02.842, Speaker B: I wish when I was getting into crypto back in 2017 and I thought about like a polychain universe of, oh, yeah, every single chain will exist. I wish somebody would be, was mean to me back then so I would get some. Some sense slapped into me. Cardano is not a real system. It's not live. It doesn't have contracts. It doesn't have an app layer.
01:02:02.842 - 01:02:12.642, Speaker B: It just has Charles Hawkinson, who is a bitter developer who is trying to, I don't know, grasp for straws, for attention. That's my hot take.
01:02:12.776 - 01:02:36.054, Speaker A: That's some spice. I mean, the thing about Cardano is that its market cap is something like $30 to $50 billion. So it's a massive market cap. It's being valued as if it is a legitimate threat or a legitimate DFI platform. And the reality is there's no ecosystem.
01:02:36.102 - 01:02:36.522, Speaker B: There's nothing.
01:02:36.576 - 01:02:38.410, Speaker A: There are no smart contracts there.
01:02:38.560 - 01:02:39.242, Speaker B: No one's building.
01:02:39.296 - 01:03:29.174, Speaker A: I think the messages through this meme is make sure you do your own research, folks, right? It's very easy to watch somebody on YouTube tell you that some token is going to go to the moon, not tell you why, but hype it up. Have you used the system? Have you ever done anything of value on a system like Cardano? If the answer to that is no, if you can't even use it, then you got to question what you're buying, right? This has always been core to the bankless platform. The bankless thesis is you only become an informed investor because you use these systems in the real world. And if you're not willing to spend the time to go use the system and test it out and see it do something of value, don't buy it. You're not an informed investor until you do that. You're just buying into a narrative. Narratives can be dangerous.
01:03:29.174 - 01:03:32.202, Speaker A: They can be destructive. That's the message here behind the.
01:03:32.336 - 01:03:37.340, Speaker B: That's the. That's the nice message. I prefer the mean message.
01:03:37.710 - 01:03:44.874, Speaker A: There you go. But I won't read. I already said it, guys. Risks and disclaimers. Of course. Eth is risky. Bitcoin is risky.
01:03:44.874 - 01:03:54.786, Speaker A: All of crypto is risky. So is defi. You could lose what, especially Cardano. Cardano is really risky. But we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone.
01:03:54.786 - 01:03:56.958, Speaker A: But thanks for joining us on the bankless.
