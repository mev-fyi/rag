00:00:00.330 - 00:00:00.880, Speaker A: You.
00:00:04.290 - 00:00:37.714, Speaker B: Bankless nation. We have Balaji Srinivasan on. He's talking about his prediction that within 90 days the US dollar would hyperinflate and one bitcoin would be worth $1 million. This is both a prediction he made and a bet that he has made after that prediction on Twitter. He's been saying some alarming things over the past few, few days, I would say, about the US banking system. And maybe the most alarming is some of his early predictions have sort of been right. There's more murmurings of bank closures that have passed.
00:00:37.714 - 00:01:09.550, Speaker B: Both the United States are now in Europe. We just had Credit Suisse, we had First Republic Bank that just kind of go to zero. We have Central Bank Communications talking about coordinated efforts between them all to inject liquidity in this market. The prospect of unlimited coverage for all depositors and for all of these underwater assets is now in play too. And so I worry about some of the things coming to pass because his predictions, David, are quite dire. He is sending out an alarm. He says the bit signal.
00:01:09.550 - 00:02:14.882, Speaker B: He says people to get their money outside of the US banking system and into Bitcoin, specifically into crypto systems and outside of the areas where the Fed has root level access. So we brought him on to make this case, to hear the evidence for his claims and to see how alarmed we should really be. One thing I'll say before get your response from this, David, is we do intend to bring on a counterpoint as well. So Balogy has given his case for why we're all basically the US dollar is doomed, it's going to hyperinflate and that's going to happen in relatively short period of time. We also want to get on somebody to make the opposite claim so that this is balanced and so that listeners can listen to the evidence balogy comes up with and listen to the counterpoint and make their own decision on this. But I got to say, we needed to hear him out on this because he's been right about many things in the past, he's been right overall about crypto and kind of the direction and now he's setting off this alarm bell. It certainly gave me cause for concern and the reason for this conversation.
00:02:14.882 - 00:02:19.766, Speaker B: So David, what are your thoughts going to this episode? What should people keep in mind?
00:02:19.948 - 00:02:58.430, Speaker C: Yeah, I think bology is just sounding the alarm that Bitcoin is going to a million dollars. He's made that bet and many, many people are like, well, he owns a bunch of bitcoin. This is a rational thing for him to do. It's a million dollar marketing expense. That's not what bology is here to say. He is saying the net effect of Bitcoin reaching $1 million is as a result of the complete destruction, perhaps of the United States banking system and the dollar system at large. His big claim is know all of Alameda Research and FTX's insolvency where they tried to prop up their accounts with some finagling of their accounting.
00:02:58.430 - 00:03:42.574, Speaker C: He is saying that that is perhaps true of the entire banking system where there is just not a there there anymore. And so his idea that bitcoin is going a million dollars is actually a much bigger topic, which is more or less the complete and utter destruction of our banking system. A few comments on the actual form Factor podcasting logistics for this episode. We've been talking to bology about doing an episode and he randomly just hit us up and said all right, let's do this right now. And so we kind of aped into this interview. bology gave us a ton of links to share and we are doing our best to share them in Riverside, which is our podcasting recording software. Recording this one was logistically challenging.
00:03:42.574 - 00:04:31.262, Speaker C: Like I said, Ryan said, I'm also in the Dominican Republic, my internet is an issue. But I think the message will become loud and clear. And really going back to the content, I think the takeaway for our Bankless listeners, regardless of how true Balogy is, I think there's a spectrum here. Either bology is like 100% right or he's only 5% right. But either way, the patterns and things that unfold over the next, perhaps 90 days of time as a results to banking crises and inflation and liquidity at least I think bology is giving us a mental model, a map to test what events happen in one week, one month, three months. And we can test them against Bology's thesis and his theories and what he's presented here today. So I think that's really the call to action for bankless listeners to understand, see the model that Balogy is putting forth.
00:04:31.262 - 00:04:39.160, Speaker C: And as more announcements happen, as more perhaps bank failures happen or doesn't happen, you'll be able to test it against what Balogy has presented here today.
00:04:40.890 - 00:04:41.990, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely.
00:04:42.140 - 00:05:07.870, Speaker B: And I don't think David, you and I are in a place to say that he's right or he's wrong, but certainly his argument warrants consideration. So that's why we are putting this in front of you today, guys. We're going to get right to the episode with biology, but before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible, including Kraken, which is the best way to get your Fiat into crypto, and our number one recommended exchange for 2023.

00:07:57.356 - 00:08:10.674, Speaker B: Bankless Nation we have Balaji Srinivasan here on Bankless again today, talking about something very specific, which is a very bold call that Balaji made last week. Balaji. Welcome back to Bankless.
00:08:10.802 - 00:08:15.420, Speaker A: Hey, welcome. Thanks. Or I guess. Thank you. You're supposed to say welcome. I'm supposed to say thank.
00:08:16.030 - 00:08:18.186, Speaker B: Yeah. You've got your own podcast now, by the way.
00:08:18.208 - 00:08:18.554, Speaker A: I do.
00:08:18.592 - 00:08:27.342, Speaker B: Which is fantastic. So you've probably been playing the role of host more often. Tell folks about that before we get in.
00:08:27.396 - 00:09:07.622, Speaker A: It's funny because I launched a blog right before COVID I launched a podcast right before this. So it's a little bit of deja vu where I was just like a month into kind of this new sort of content project, and then things started getting intense on the Internet, or not just the Internet, but like the world. Yeah. The podcast is called the Network State Podcast. It is about what sort of comes after the 20th century order. And I actually think that the book thenemberxate.com there's a bunch of stuff in there which I think will potentially be actually fairly relevant to what's going to transpire.
00:09:07.622 - 00:09:31.122, Speaker A: And I kind of thought it might play out over a decade or something like that. You heard that saying by Lenin there's decades where nothing happens, and there's weeks where decades happen, right? Like during Corona, at the beginning of Corona, the remote work went like 30, 40, 50 points vertical. It did like a decade of adoption in a few weeks. All these kinds of things went like vertical or horizontal or down. Right?
00:09:31.176 - 00:10:11.326, Speaker C: You're here because I think you're claiming this is one of those two weeks where a decade's happened, and all of a sudden you have been inundated with intention about this crazy, crazy bet that you've made where you think, that bitcoin, our beloved asset is going to become worth $1 million inside of the next 90 days, which, when you take that take into account, people will call that a bold call. And so this has made the Internet all pivot their attention to this claim, which is a crazy, crazy claim that I think people aren't totally understanding or willing to accept. So, Sabalaji, maybe you can kind of walk us through your thought process here. How is Bitcoin going to become worth a million dollars in the next three months?
00:10:11.428 - 00:10:45.194, Speaker A: So here's the thing is, I don't think I've ever made a price prediction or something like that. Just not what I do. I'm not a price guy. I'm not a chart guy. If you look at I've been in the public eye for ten years. I have tens of thousands of tweets, I have hundreds of pages of writing whatever, hours of podcasts, including some with you guys, right? Essays and so on and so forth. And there's enough context there where people, I think, know that I'm not a money motivated person, I'm an ideological person in our talks and so on.
00:10:45.194 - 00:11:52.320, Speaker A: I've never been like, oh, price, blah blah. Let me just back up for a second, okay? Ten days ish ago, 1012 days ago, silicon Valley Bank, silvergate and then Silicon Valley Bank, like, basically just collapsed overnight. There's no warning, right? Just boom, done. And then this gigantic, this 200 billion dollar bank with 40,000 tech companies, people who had done basically nothing, they're just going about their business, suddenly found that their checking accounts, the money was gone, right? And then they were being blamed as if wanting their checking account back was like a bailout or something. Like that, as if they had done something risky. And this was this whole frantic kind of thing over the weekend and some people were acting tactically and they were trying to figure out how to fix the situation or whatever. But I was like, how could this possibly have happened? And I started looking at all of the numbers that I could find online and just to summarize what I found, and I'll show you a zillion references on this because it's actually kind of crazy.
00:11:52.320 - 00:12:45.534, Speaker A: The Central Bank, meaning the Fed, the banks and the bank regulators have all known for at least the past year that hundreds of banks in the US. Are insolvent. Meaning? Uncle Sam bankman freed. They don't have assets on hand on a mark to market basis to match their know. Uncle Sam Bankman Fried is the best way of understanding this. Because Sam Bankman fried whether he lied to himself or he lied to others or whatever complicated thing. Remember he had this balance sheet that was this crazy balance sheet which in his head, it added up to more than what people were asking for their money out, right? And until the stress test actually came and people actually withdrew their money, neither he nor they knew how much money he actually had.
00:12:45.534 - 00:13:14.794, Speaker A: Because he wasn't just holding it on like a one for one basis. He was doing these crazy conversions, exposing everybody to market risk and so on and so forth, right? Essentially, he took people's trust. He took their deposits, he invested them in these shitcoins or spent it on something. Whatever the heck he did marked it as if it was still there. But when they actually came for it, there was a huge hole. Right? We now know that story. Okay? That is basically what has happened.
00:13:14.794 - 00:14:20.078, Speaker A: And the funny thing is, Amjad Masad and I, in the fall of 2022, we were like, you know, that's kind of what fiat banking is also, because a fractional reserve and so on. If everybody actually asked for their money at the same time, they wouldn't be able to get it back. But the situation we've got now is so much worse than even fractional reserve. And what that is, is that the banks all did something very much like Sam Bankman Fried. They took your deposits and they bought long dated Treasuries and other long dated government bonds in 2021, essentially on the guidance of the federal government, or especially the Fed really, that they were going to keep interest rates low for a long time. And then the Fed raised rates in 2022 in this sort of surprise super high hike, crushed the portfolios of every single entity that had trusted them, and stuck the banks with this giant surprise of this massive devaluation of bonds. And you can see, and I've found all these links where the bankers are basically panicking about this over 2022.
00:14:20.078 - 00:15:11.294, Speaker A: And you know what they come up with? They basically come up with an accounting trick called hold to Maturity. I call it Hide to Maturity, where just like Sam Bakeman fried, they book it as having not depreciated. Oh, it's still worth what we paid for it. We're good, right? And this time bomb just grew larger and larger and larger and larger across the entire industry, with everybody obviously knowing about it. And again, whether they were lying to themselves or they're lying to others, what they didn't do is they didn't notify you the depositor that the money was gone for not just SVB, but for millions of depositors across the country and every bank that has US. Treasuries and long data, government bonds. This is one of those things, you know what saying, like, if you have a problem, if you owe the bank a million dollars, you have a problem.
00:15:11.294 - 00:15:48.234, Speaker A: If you owe the bank a billion dollars, the bank has a problem, right? If you have one bank failure, that's a bank's problem. If you have hundreds of bank failures, that's a central bank's problem. Backing up for a second, what is a proposed action that people should take? Get your coins, get whatever you can into crypto. Okay? I recommend bitcoin at this point. It is going to be the lifeboat for a number of different reasons. Of course, if you have other cryptocurrency, whatever, obviously you guys are ethereum guys. Let's just say that all of the crypto tribalism is going to rise to an ideological level that we've never seen in a year or two years, or whenever this crisis over.
00:15:48.234 - 00:16:22.262, Speaker A: By in this crisis, there'll be three kinds of zones. Fiat only zones where crypto is banned or seized, and only the government can have it because it's used to back the currency. Bitcoin only zones, like maximalist zones, and then crypto free zones where you can use whatever cryptocurrency you want. Okay? And one of the reasons is a lot of Fiat banks are about to die. They all trusted the Fed at the same time, the centralization at the Fed buying the same asset at the same time, getting it devalued by the same vendor, namely the Fed in the same way, then all going bust at once. That's basically what's happening.
00:16:22.316 - 00:16:57.070, Speaker B: So, Balaji, I just want to put kind of the timeline together and ask how you have been piecing this together. Right? So we had Silvergate Bank and Silicon Valley Bank. That happens the weekend of the 11th and twelveTH, let's call it, right? You put up the bit signal on March 16. So that was Thursday after that weekend. And the bit signal is basically like you telling people that bitcoin was going to go up. You said this. How do you ring the fire alarm on the internet? How do you show it's not a false alarm? I'm putting up the bit signal.
00:16:57.070 - 00:17:30.198, Speaker B: $1 million in bitcoin to alert us to the stealth financial cris. Thousand dollars per tweet for the best 1000 reply with your charts, graphs, stats and memes. So you're clearly propagating a message. One question I have for you is to some of the doubters, maybe like, let's just address this at the beginning. So this was previous to the bet. So some of the people are saying some people are saying, bology, that this tweet and also the bet itself is kind of like promotion. It's basically advertising for your bags, which are crypto centric bags.
00:17:30.198 - 00:17:32.086, Speaker B: How do you respond to that critique?
00:17:32.198 - 00:18:22.294, Speaker A: The thing is, if I didn't hold crypto, they would say, oh, you don't actually have skin in the game, you're just doing it for attention, and so on and so forth, right? All I can say on that is hold dollars, then okay, if you don't believe me, hold dollars and then see what happens, right? If you don't believe me, buy short dated treasuries, like three months and just say, biology is crazy and whatever, fine, go ahead. But this is like, if you look at the full context of everything I've said, it's impossible to prove, quote motivation or whatever, okay? But if you look at all the tweets and everything I've ever said, this is something where this is like the crisis that Bitcoin was built for. Like, Bitcoin was born out of crisis, the 2008 crisis, and this is the 2023 banking crisis.
00:18:22.342 - 00:18:55.030, Speaker C: And I remember, Balaji, that you were very, very early to the COVID crisis. And so I remember you were sounding the COVID alarm in January, February, and then COVID hit in March. And so you have a track record of doing this at least once before. That I can remember, and it being contrarian at the time. And while this is very different from COVID I will have to say that you have one very strong mark of sounding an alarm in a prior crisis, at least a couple of months ahead of time. So this is not a new activity for you.
00:18:55.180 - 00:19:42.078, Speaker A: Yeah, it's not fun, right, because everybody thinks you're crazy or you're doing it for attention because essentially both the virus. Well, first let me talk about COVID for a second. Let me come back to that. People are saying it was a paranoid conspiracy theory to say that Coronavirus would ever spread out of China. Obviously you're a racist, blah, blah, blah. But obviously public health people had been thinking about pandemics for a while, and at the time that was a good way of sort of framing that this was not like a threat that a crazy person was coming up with, but that public health people were. And I had sort of a mental model of the world, right? Like, imagine there's like a bunch of rubber bands between countries like Taiwan China, right, or India, Pakistan, or Bitcoin ethereum, right? There's these various rubber bands between groups, right? Stress, tensions and so on.
00:19:42.078 - 00:20:04.014, Speaker A: Then when you have like, a shock to the system where someone goes from zero to one or one to zero. A lot of those rubber bands update, and the system moves into a new confirmation. Okay? And so that's kind of how I was thinking about this. I had this sort of chessboard in my head, and I was like, okay, if this hits, how does that move? This, this, and this, right? Do you see what I'm saying? Okay.
00:20:04.132 - 00:20:17.074, Speaker B: And by the way, for listeners, this was a January 30, 2020 tweet timestamp is what we're talking about. So well before the general US became aware, weeks or so.
00:20:17.192 - 00:20:56.510, Speaker A: And I'll show you how, if you just scroll down a little bit, you'll see how I did it. Right? So first is I was following the raw data. I had some background in before I got into crypto, I was actually basically doing computational genomics and statistics, and especially microbial genomics, right? So I had some background in the space, so I had some lenses with which I could read some of the technical literature. Viruses are exponential. The thing about this at the time, by the way, that's funny, it's like total confirmed cases outside was like less than 1000 or whatever, right? Seren's like, look, it's so low. I'm like, yeah, but somebody knows viruses, knows tech. It's about like, rate of growth.
00:20:56.510 - 00:21:40.278, Speaker A: And this is like a pretty high rate of growth. And the thing about this, by the way, and one thing I'll just back up for a second and say as of January 2023, three years later, people believe two things about COVID First, a novel virus out of China infected more than 700 million people worldwide, killing about 1% of them and seriously sickening another tens of millions of people, causing significant upheaval by all kinds of governments and a huge tech shock. Right? On the other hand, they also think, yeah, it wasn't that big a deal. Life went on. Both of those things. I would say the combination of both those two facts is actually what I'd say the conventional wisdom is as of January 2023. Would you agree with that? Roughly.
00:21:40.278 - 00:22:41.886, Speaker A: But the thing about that is, while I agree life went on, and certainly it wasn't like the end of life on Earth or anything, and we're lucky that it wasn't like the Spanish flu or something. That was certainly not like, if I'd said, in January, 700 million people will get infected, 7 million will die, but life will go on, nobody would. That would be in the weirdest projection ever. Okay? It would sound terrifying and preposterous. But then also and this is important, the concept of normality of some kind being restored on the other side would have also seemed preposterous. That is a very nonobvious frame of mind, which is a frame of mind I'm in kind of now. Okay, we're basically in and I'll get into details we're basically in the fiat crisis, okay? We're in the crisis where all the centralization of fiat, all the opacity of fiat, all the things that Satoshi talked about, all of that is now blowing up on people in a very tangible way.
00:22:41.886 - 00:23:16.090, Speaker A: And really it's kind of remarkable. And so now the thing is, we're going to have a wrenching transition to the crypto economy, where just like, remote work kind of went like vertical because people just had to, right? A lot of fiat systems are going to break, potentially over the next weeks and months and maybe years, and we're going to have to switch over to crypto systems and it'll be a big pain, a huge pain, of which the single most important is the transition to Bitcoin as a global reserve currency. But there will be normality of some kind on the other side.
00:23:16.160 - 00:24:16.814, Speaker B: So, Balaji, one difference between kind of the fire alarm you pulled around COVID and the fire alarm, the fiat crisis fire alarm that you're pulling now is you are actually talking about numbers in a timeline, right? So you've got 90 days as a number. You've got a prediction or a bet now, as it's turned into of $1 million in Bitcoin, and that is a fairly short duration timeline. So you must think that this is going to happen all at once. Using that phraseology so suddenly now this is the all at once moment. And I'm wondering why you think that this is almost like hyper bitcoinization or the inflation away of all fiat is sort of a long term crypto prediction anyway, that's what happens to fiat over 70 to 100 year time periods when nation states go on the decline in a new monetary policy regime. But you're saying this is going to happen in 90 days, this is going to happen in fast motion. And by the way, it's happening now, and here's your Tweet warning about it.
00:24:16.814 - 00:24:22.906, Speaker B: So can you tell us why do you feel confident enough to put numbers around this in timelines?
00:24:23.098 - 00:24:50.918, Speaker A: So the exact state of the world in 90 days? I don't know, but I think it's going to be quite different than today. And the main thing I wanted to get people's see, this is not really a bet on the price of Bitcoin. It's a bet on the devaluation of the dollar. This is the Honky cruise hyperinflation table. First of all, hyperinflation is much more common than people think. And second, when it happens, it's much more rapid than people think. People basically lose faith in a currency and they go to a competing reserve currency.
00:24:50.918 - 00:25:24.420, Speaker A: Okay? Now, historically, that has been something where they escaped their local currency for the US. Dollar. But until now, see, the big difference versus 2008 is today the US dollar is no longer too big to fail. There are two competitors to the dollar. There's a rinminbi and there's bitcoin. And as I'll get to what is currently happening is you know how people have said that the US. Is going to monetize the debt? You probably heard that before, right? Yeah, so everybody knew it was going to happen, but not exactly how.
00:25:24.420 - 00:25:49.338, Speaker A: And it's happening now. When I was digging into the SVB situation, I was trying to be like, how could a 200 billion dollar bank be insolvent? Take a look at this graph. This is not my graph. This is from FDIC. This is unrealized gains losses on securities. Do you see the 2008 2009 over on the left hand side? Okay? And now look at the Yawning losses that are there in 2022, okay? Right?
00:25:49.504 - 00:26:06.046, Speaker B: This looks like similar to, I guess the Sam Bankman freed FTX analogy of like you have a balance sheet with a lot of trash on it and you have a market downturn and they've all lost like 80% to 90% of their value. And now what's? Propping up your assets? That's sort of what this graph looks like to me.
00:26:06.148 - 00:26:41.606, Speaker A: And this is across not just one bank, it's all the banks. One way of thinking about it is sometimes people are in debt and then there's a balloon payment at the end and then they're done. They just can't pay it, right? They just don't have the money. This is kind of like that one of the things that the financial system is set up to be opaque, right? It's set up to like in 2008, if the market treasures happening on Twitter, people would say, tell me you don't know what a CDO is. Without telling me, you don't know what a CDO is. And the whole point is that nobody knows what a CDO is, including the guy who's selling it and the guy who's buying it. They've all fooled themselves into thinking they're so smart.
00:26:41.606 - 00:27:50.290, Speaker A: And actually the thing underlying is a house that sucks because nobody's paying the mortgage and no amount of financial engineering can do anything other than hide that eventual mark to market on the thing with the guy who's paying zero money. Do you see what I'm saying? Right? And in the same way, what's happened today is all of this financial engineering has led to a house of cards where the money is gone underneath it like the banks literally don't have, if you came to them, this gigantic hole on the right hand side. If people came to them and actually asked for their dollars out, the banks would not be able to liquidate their assets to get their dollars out. Okay? And so for the whole year, they hid this with the right decoder lens from where we are now, three, four months later, you can see, wait, it's not one bank, it's not SVB, it's a lot of banks. Right? But look at the thing at the end, right? It's like 423,000,000,000 during the first six months of the year grew larger, right? This time bomb was growing and the bank regulators were aware of it. And they weren't notifying you, the depositors. They were just thinking they could kick the can again.
00:27:50.290 - 00:27:50.990, Speaker A: Somehow.
00:27:51.070 - 00:28:18.460, Speaker B: We all know as. Part of a fractional reserve system. If there is a run on the bank, there's not enough dollars in the bank account to meet the demands of that run on the bank. But this is somehow worse because we have these securities propping up the assets of the bank and of depositors funds that have just lost massive amounts of value. And so if you mark them to market, we are much further underwater than just the typical fractional reserve banking system.
00:28:18.910 - 00:29:22.122, Speaker A: One of the things I learned in kind of Tweeting about this is just like Bankman Fried had these weird self deception tricks or taboos or whatever within the company that stopped people from asking the right questions. All of these bankers basically do not think of the Fed as an actor, right? And so they think of them as a referee. First, let me explain what the reality of the situation is, and then let me explain what they think it is and why they haven't told you about it. The reality of the situation is, while it's complicated, the Federal Reserve effectively gave guidance to banks to buy certain assets. That it then massively depreciated all at once and crushed every single bank that trusted the Fed, their balance sheets all at once. And that's what's responsible for this huge devaluation here. And the thing is, though, that a lot of finance guys, they think that it's like weird to blame the Fed, okay? Why do you think it's weird to blame the Fed? They think of the Fed as like a referee.
00:29:22.122 - 00:29:29.214, Speaker A: You know how people used to say, oh, you can't blame the media. If you're a bad guy, the media will call you out. You should be ashamed of, like, as in a referee.
00:29:29.262 - 00:29:32.014, Speaker B: As in neutral, kind of an arbitrary of laws.
00:29:32.062 - 00:30:10.302, Speaker A: Yes, as in neutral. Right? Just like people used to think the media was like a neutral referee of just like the political system or whatever it just calls balls and strikes. We don't have any opinions on anything, right? I mean, that's ludicrous today, right? They're constantly attacking people. People thought that the Fed was like a neutral referee of the system and it's just like deliberation to figure out what the right rate to set is and beyond politics and so on and so forth, right? If you're a fund manager, you simultaneously think, okay, the Fed is all important. Powell is more powerful than the know. We listen to everything the Fed says. Our algorithms trigger on their every word.
00:30:10.302 - 00:30:33.286, Speaker A: Oh, they're so, so important. But then if somebody says, oh, this bank got decimated because the Fed hiked rates, they'll say, Lol, what a loser. Look, you can't take everything the Fed says at their word. It's your responsibility to hedge. The Fed just puts out guidance. You just got to make your own book and so on and so forth. Okay? Now think about that, right? That's two different things.
00:30:33.286 - 00:31:00.874, Speaker A: It's first, the Fed is all powerful. And second, the Fed is never to be held responsible. See what I'm saying? Okay? And the reason that if you are a fund manager, you can't control the Fed. You just have to react to it. So it's almost as if they're like setting the laws of the video game that you're playing and so can't be a wimp. You just have to win within the laws of the video game. Do you see what I'm saying? Okay, and people are like, you know what? Yeah, maybe once in a while they'll complain about a call by the ref, but fundamentally, they think of the Fed as legitimate.
00:31:00.874 - 00:31:27.586, Speaker A: How could they think any other way? You know what? You're not going to have somebody setting interest rates. Well, that would mean we can't help people. We can't have full employee. That would be terrible. Right? Oh, where you're saying they should just publish an interest rate and stick to it? No, they need to have a data dependent policy path where they go and assimilate all the information from the world on the state of affairs and they update the interest rate. But what that's like, by the way? And this is like a really fundamental Rooden Branch critique. Imagine steering a car by mail.
00:31:27.586 - 00:31:51.822, Speaker A: You've got your car, all right? You drop a postcard out the window. You wait like, a week for it to come back, and then you turn left or right. What's going to happen? You're going to crash. Right? Because the time constant of steering is seconds. And this is like weeks. Right? That's like, what the Fed is, where it's getting in data that's this lagging data. Oh, inflation is up.
00:31:51.822 - 00:32:10.962, Speaker A: That's a result of so many millions of people doing all these things. Okay, now let's change interest rates or whatever, and they're changing, like, a single parameter, okay? And it's a highly political process. So TLDR is a lot of this stuff is actually intentionally meant to be complicated. But the simple version is the Fed bankrupted the banks. Okay? It bankrupted its own banks.
00:32:11.106 - 00:32:30.874, Speaker B: At year end 2021, only four community banks had tangible equity capital ratios below 5%. That number increased to 333 at June 30, 2022, indicating less ability to sustain economic shocks. Okay, there's some finance bro language there. Can you help us parse through what that actually means?
00:32:30.992 - 00:32:38.718, Speaker A: Yeah, it basically means there are 333 banks where the money is gone. And so I want to take a.
00:32:38.724 - 00:33:00.230, Speaker C: Moment and summarize everything here and everything that the reason why you're saying Uncle Sam bankman freed is that, okay, so FTX insolvent did some funny accounting tricks to maintain pseudo solvency, public solvency, and basically bologna. You're saying that that is now true for the entire banking, commercial banking system of the United States of America.
00:33:02.010 - 00:33:18.890, Speaker A: And even more than that, because it's also true for all of these foreign banks. It's even bigger than that. Every foreign bank that bought us Treasuries and by the way, when I was saying this, people are like, oh, Bowser, you're so crazy, blah, blah, blah. But did you see what they just did with the swap lines? Okay, look at this.
00:33:19.040 - 00:33:48.770, Speaker B: So what are we looking at here? Breaking market. News from the US. Federal Reserve. This says the Fed and the central banks of the US sorry, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, and European Central Bank and Switzerland announced a coordinated action to improve liquidity provision through the standing US dollar. Liquidity swap lines. Doing that on the weekend, it seems like the central bankers always do really important things on the weekend, like when they're in crisis mode. And I guess that happened on a Sunday, sunday the 19th.
00:33:48.770 - 00:33:55.858, Speaker B: So what does this mean? What is these words around? Improved liquidity provision through standing US dollar?
00:33:55.874 - 00:33:56.054, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:33:56.092 - 00:33:57.026, Speaker B: Liquidity swap lines.
00:33:57.058 - 00:35:07.440, Speaker A: What is that again? The thing I want to stress over and over again is they will mock you and attack you for not knowing every piece of their lingo, because it's what camouflage is to like a venomous snake, okay? The whole point is to sneak up on you, bite you, and one way to think about it, by the camouflage of venom snake, it's a good analogy because the snake didn't design its camouflage. It was just evolutionary, okay? The finance guys. Because the thing is, see, in our sector of the world, if you're investing, if you're doing at least in the tech sector, if you're putting money into companies, that's so called primary investment and they're going and building a product and selling it, right? That's something where both parties, all parties, can win. The customer, the company, the investor, and so on. Okay? Finance, though, is a fundamentally zero sum world, often where one party is going to lose, okay? And they have evolved a bunch of camouflage tricks to hide what they're doing from themselves and from others. And the whole point, I mean, there's a saying in finance, how are you going to screw me? Right? Everything is hidden in the fine print. And it's like, ha, you signed that, but you didn't think of that.
00:35:07.440 - 00:36:13.438, Speaker A: The whole point is it's like adversarial, all right? And just to show you how insane that gets, all right? One of the things I found that the whole you remember how people are like, oh, you tech guys, you should have known that the bank was insolvent. It was in a public statement and so on and so forth. Remember how they were saying stuff like that, right? Well, it is something where the insolvency was intentionally hidden in a footnote. Evidence of deception, okay? Now, by the way, it wasn't just SVB that was deceiving. What happened was the Fed surprised the banks by giving them a bunch of assets or selling a bunch of assets. They then surprised devalued the panicking banks then decide to surprise the depositors by hiding their gigantic unrealized losses. And that is a time bomb that is about to blow up the entire Fed centered economy, okay? They're blanking out the stuff that they used to show to show their giant losses and they just buried it in a okay, the fact that they were insolvent.
00:36:13.454 - 00:36:16.034, Speaker B: What are we looking at here? This is a SVB document.
00:36:16.082 - 00:37:04.210, Speaker A: This is SVB's Financial. Got it? Okay, so the point is, look, you know, the EU makes every company put some stupid cookie disclosure on their website, but the regulator is allowing a 200 billion dollar bank to bury its insolvency in a footnote. Okay? And let me explain, that's what I mean by like a poisonous snakes camouflage, right? The thing is, you paid for with your tax and so on. You paid for regulators to give you a high trust banking system. What the hell are you paying the regulators for if they are literally covering up the insolvency of the bank? We're talking about something where 40,000 companies and all of their employees were banking at an insolvent bank and not notified about it by the regulator that they were paying to protect them. You see what I'm saying?
00:37:04.280 - 00:37:07.038, Speaker B: What are you alleging as the incentive here, Balaji?
00:37:07.134 - 00:37:08.014, Speaker A: What am I allergic? Incentive.
00:37:08.062 - 00:37:18.920, Speaker B: Yeah. The poisonous snake has an incentive, either defense or attack or something like this. What is the incentive of central banks and regulators? Why would they want to hide this within the system?
00:37:19.530 - 00:37:46.266, Speaker A: Exactly. Well, so here's the thing. If the entire system is going bust, okay, and you have been handed a flaming bag of dog poop, which the defense I can make is while certainly the mismanagement of the last few years has been historical, the debts of the US. Have been building up for a long time. So there's always incentive to kick the can, okay? Now the can't be kicked. So they are just trying to hide it for as long as they can. Suddenly it blew up with SVB.
00:37:46.266 - 00:38:34.974, Speaker A: If all the banks go bust, the regulator has a problem. So if they're going to go bust, the regulator needs to find a scapegoat. And the scapegoat is either the tech guy, or the Trump guy, or both, or the people who are getting their money out or whatever. If it was discovered that the bank regulators in the central bank had caused a crisis and covered up the crisis, would that look good for them? No. So this chaos that's about to unfold, essentially what I was able to discover was that the devaluation of the dollar, the monetization of the debt that Dahlio talked about, whether intentionally or emergently, they're doing it now. They're not calling it that, they're calling it bailouts of banks. But this is actually the messy devaluation of the dollar where all the debts they couldn't print are printed at once.
00:38:34.974 - 00:39:28.420, Speaker A: And if they thought that, and if they said that because they've got the slamming bag of dog poop, how do they stick it with somebody without getting blamed, right? If they just came up front and said, we're not going to be able to make our bond payments, the US. Can't pay its debts, therefore we're just going to print monopoly money. Wee and your purchasing power goes away, right? Then there would be attention on what they were doing. And by the way, this is just the most extreme version of something that's always okay, where often regulators cause a problem and then it blows up in public, and then what happens is more failure, more funding, okay? Like every crisis powers them up because let's say, for example, there's some drug company and it's got an issue, right? Bad drug, drug company goes to zero. FDA is broadened, they're spanked in Congress, oh, you did such a bad job. And you know what it ends with, okay, how much budget do you need to make sure this doesn't happen again?
00:39:29.510 - 00:39:33.454, Speaker B: Even failure mode is success, more failure.
00:39:33.502 - 00:40:32.498, Speaker A: More funding, because people can't conceive an alternative to FDA. So it's failures. It has an incentive to either cause or turn something into a crisis because then it's a big deal, right? And again, this is something where is it conscious? Sometimes it's like, oh, they'll exaggerate and they'll say, oh, you crypto guys are criminals. Like what Gensler is doing, that's conscious, right? He is making you guys out to be criminals so he can get more budget and power. But sometimes it's like just the emergent incentives where it's like, oh, if this thing blows up, well, we get more budget and well, I guess now we have the authority to go and regulate that thing that we screwed up. And the way of thinking about it that's outside the FDA or outside the Fed is do you have an alternate regulator, right? Don't you want a regulator which will tell you in a trustworthy way that your deposits are still there? Right? That's a blockchain.
00:40:32.594 - 00:41:32.730, Speaker B: Balaji before we get to kind of blockchain, because some of this has happened so fast for people, right? So I was just saying, it was a week and a half ago and we first started seeing Silvergate go under and then the crisis with Silicon Valley Bank and then just last weekend, so not the previous weekend, but one before. It seemed the the fed the US. Government FDIC came out and said, look, all depositors funds are going to be made whole. We're going to basically, implicitly, we're going to stop the banking crisis here. No more bank runs. And then last week we started to see, oh, okay, well, maybe this has spread to Europe and Credit Suisse, but it's just one bank, right? And it's like you hear rumors and you hear rumblings and you hear all of these things. And I think at every stage the general public is like, okay, well, I don't understand finance, and I'm not surprised that bankers did banker things and there's a few rogue actor bankers here and banks and the Fed is taking care of that.
00:41:32.730 - 00:41:50.794, Speaker B: FDIC is taking care of that. This is not going to spread any further. I think that's the general feeling of the public right now. Why do you think this is more severe? Why do you think they can't just issue and say, oh, depositors funds are going to be secured. FDIC will cover them, don't worry.
00:41:50.842 - 00:41:57.842, Speaker A: So let me show you something. Ready? Yeah. Put this up on screen. Jean Claude Juncker when it becomes serious, you have to lie. You know who this guy is?
00:41:57.976 - 00:41:58.914, Speaker B: I've never heard that name.
00:41:58.952 - 00:42:31.770, Speaker A: Former head of the eurozone. Okay. This is Central Banker. And what he's basically saying is when the system is actually melting down, you have to give public statements saying everything's all right. While you know what this is the equivalent of, okay, remember, FTX is fine, assets are right? Yes. Like, that is literally what is happening now. The fact that the Federal Reserve has put out multiple statements over the last few weeks that are like, we're still solvent, it's still there, et cetera.
00:42:31.770 - 00:43:02.230, Speaker A: Everything is on fire and we're all going to die. It's a closer translation of that. So the whole point is for them to spend whatever trust they have and hope you don't exit the system. So, March twelveTH, 2023, they said, we're only going to print 25 billion and it won't be necessary to draw on the funds. In four days, it was up to 2 trillion. And really, it's going to be infinity. Okay, it's funny, but it's also bananas, right? So this is a new era, okay? This is the final era where they have found they can't hike rates anymore.
00:43:02.230 - 00:43:40.530, Speaker A: All people are looking for their money in the banks. And so rather than those people coming up with, oh, my God, the money is gone, they're printing tons of money to give it to these banks, and the banks are taking it. And if you look at the way they're doing it is this is swap lines and the Btfp program, and Arthur Hayes has some good if you want to know all the technical details of exactly how they're doing this shit, arthur Hayes is the 150 IQ guy who can talk to you about it, okay? As I said, it's set up to be complicated and whatnot. And like, oh, no, they're not actually printing money. Ha. You're so naive. But you know the 50 IQ, 100 IQ, 150 IQ guy.
00:43:40.530 - 00:44:17.630, Speaker A: Right. Basically, gigantic amounts of new money is rushing in because they believe there's going to be a ton of bank runs. Right? And the reason is those bonds that they had in their portfolios that were marked down, well, the Fed said, you know what? We're going to give you money that will make them seem as if they're worth what they were worth. So if you lost $0.15 on the dollar, we're going to pretend that it's like, 100 cents on the dollar. It's just like the mortgage crashes. They bought these assets at Par, right? And again, it's all this obfuscation to cover for the fact that basically what Dahlia talked about, the giant print that monetizes the debt, the digital devaluation of the dollar is here.
00:44:17.630 - 00:44:19.370, Speaker A: This is like the final banking crisis.
00:44:19.450 - 00:45:04.622, Speaker B: So, Balaji, here's a part that I think some people don't understand though, is like, so if the Fed intervenes and provides all of this confidence to the market and they play the act and they seem super confident, there's no problem here. Of course all of the assets are backed. This is the US. Banking system. They're always backed in a very serious tone, and the market actually buys that. It might be a self fulfilling prophecy in that it stops the bank run. Now, one thing I read in Arthur Hayes'article, though, is that that won't stop the arbitrage opportunity of things like money markets where if you have deposits in a bank and you're only receiving a fraction of a percent of interest, you're going to want to go chase the higher interest payment on your dollars somewhere else.
00:45:04.622 - 00:45:24.882, Speaker B: And so there might be a bleed out of the banking system into like money market ETFs. And depositors aren't stupid over the long run. And of course, they're not going to let the bank essentially make money on them and so they're going to withdraw. Where's the withdrawal coming from? I suppose the confidence is still there.
00:45:25.016 - 00:46:10.802, Speaker A: What they are counting on is amidst all this chaos, that you wire money from one bank to another. You wire money to all the big banks. Only if you turn into bitcoin are you outside the system. What's happening is all of the small banks, all the tech banks, all the think different banks are getting wrecked and the big guys are coming in as saviors with printed money from the Fed and ability from the Fed to just scoop up all the small banks. And the end state is in a panic. People are like, let me wire money to the saviors, thank you, government, right, which is both arsonist and firefighter, okay? So they set all these small banks on fire by destroying all of their balance sheets, by giving them this directive to buy these bonds that they devalued. Again, whether intentional or emergent behavior doesn't actually matter.
00:46:10.802 - 00:46:45.066, Speaker A: You can describe it as if it was intentional, even if it's emergent like an ant colony. Every individual ant isn't like sketching out a blueprint, but they're responding to local incentives. Okay? So the net effect of this right now without the bit signal is all these small banks go to zero, your bank goes to zero, and you in a panic, wire your money to a big bank and that's a trap. Now you're like, I'm with the federal government. Now. I'm in the too big to fail bank whoo cris over. Thank you, Fed.
00:46:45.066 - 00:47:21.354, Speaker A: Fed's the hero. They saved the day, right? And now you're in some money market thing, or you've locked it up in Treasuries, or you're locked up just in a big bank. And here's the thing. Now, at the end, when all the small banks are dead, all the community banks are dead, all of the tech banks are dead, all of the crypto banks are dead, okay? And you've got only the big banks at the end of the banking crisis. Do you know the other thing that they chose to kind of know, despite all of know? It's a very busy time for the Federal Reserve, but they managed to get out this press release. Did you see this?
00:47:21.472 - 00:47:30.090, Speaker B: This is a press release saying, federal Reserve announces July launch for the Fed Now Service. Right? Which is their yeah, that's their CBDC.
00:47:30.430 - 00:48:00.946, Speaker A: So, again, I'm not saying I don't know exactly. It's very hard to say how intentional versus how emergent it is. But the plan, if you're described as a plan, looks something like this. The US. Has debts it can't pay. Saddle all of the banks with these giant UNPay, like these giant liabilities have tons of them go bust, come in swooping as a hero, printing the money. So people are like, thank you, Fed.
00:48:00.946 - 00:48:29.722, Speaker A: You got me my money back. And then also have them all centralized at the big banks in the process. And then amidst all the chaos, you've got, like, four banks in the US. And, like, one bank in Canada, or whatever the number is in each place. And now you just roll out a CBDC. And now the banks that were too big to fail are too big to escape, okay? Because they won't allow intraconvertibility into crypto. And all of the crazy China style tracking can be applied.
00:48:29.722 - 00:49:28.866, Speaker A: Moreover, everybody's probably going to be much poorer in 90 days after I mean, to an extent that might be hard to describe, but if the west actually does effectively default on the dollar, and all of this stuff which people have thought is worth a billion goes to zero, which is happening overnight, right? You saw first, republic like equity. Zero. You're taking a lot of billion dollar hits very fast, right? A lot of people are much poorer than they thought. And that has huge ripple effects, right? House payments, all kinds of payments don't go through huge ripple effects of the economy that we're just going to see. So in an environment of all the small banks are dead, all the money is at big banks. People are scared. The CBDC is rolled out, and now you're locked into a China style system of massive centralization, and it's too big to escape, okay? And then they can do those things, you know, the things that like incentives, like, oh, spend your money today or lose it.
00:49:28.866 - 00:49:55.066, Speaker A: Have you seen stuff like that? Sure, right? All the tracking and so on. Now, again, remember the 50 IQ, 100 IQ, 150 IQ thing. If we don't have a lens into all of the actors that set up the bomb like this, okay? But basically we do know what the exit is. Amidst all of this chaos, with all of these wires flying around all of these banks, you can do something they didn't expect you to do. You know what that is?
00:49:55.248 - 00:49:58.966, Speaker B: You're saying buy crypto, buy bitcoin, buy bitcoin.
00:49:58.998 - 00:51:08.740, Speaker A: And the reason I say bitcoin is, look, obviously I like you guys and I like it, but if there's one thing, if you have some relative or you have some friend who doesn't know, they'll say, what kind of bitcoin should I buy? Right? It just has name recognition. And in an emergency, you're not asking people to do portfolio optimization. Do I think on the other side of this, I think bitcoin is gold and I think ethereum is the financial system. I think that's probably right because ethereum can scale with lots of transactions. But I think also there's going to be jurisdictions that are so tired of finance that they will be like bitcoin maximalist jurisdictions and they will just not want I mean, if everything goes to zero and bitcoin is the only thing that doesn't go to zero, you'll have a lot of people become essentially overnight converted to bitcoin maximalism. And that's why I remember a year or two ago, I said bitcoin maximalism is the most important ideology in the world that nobody knows about. Do you guys remember saying something like that? Right? You're going to see what I mean, okay? Because bitcoin has the advantage of being I mean, it's obviously complicated with the cryptography and so on, but now it's relatively simple.
00:51:08.740 - 00:51:49.870, Speaker A: And in a time of cris, people need something simple that they can all rally behind. That's why the bit signal, that one thing goes vertical, everybody in the space values it. We get to the lifeboat, okay? And the thing about it, and here's the important thing, the big difference with bitcoin, as opposed to every single other action within the Fiat system is it's the thing that the Fed is not directly or indirectly a system administrator over, okay? Who has root, do you see what I'm saying? Like any entry in the bank of Japan, if the Fed wants, they can get the bank of Japan to just delete that, freeze that account, stop it, seize it, et cetera. They've got root over this, you know, like in The Matrix, right? The guy's got the root system. In Australia. They've got root. So that entire US financial system, they have root access.
00:51:49.870 - 00:52:28.202, Speaker A: Any stock they can freeze, they did to the know, the Canadian truckers, they did to the Russians, right? Anything where you are on their server and they have root, okay? They can monkey with it. And so from their perspective, you know what, yeah, this is a huge mess with the money lying around and whatnot, but at the end of the day, it's all just going to end up back at banks that they control. And so who know, it'll be like a time of chaos. But then we'll roll out the Fed now, we'll make sure that never happens again. We'll have total control over everything. Okay? I don't know exactly what they're thinking, but that's the result unless you get to Bitcoin. So your theory that is something they don't control, policy to walk this through.
00:52:28.256 - 00:52:35.790, Speaker B: Your theory is all of the banks are underwater by a lot and the bankers are lying about it effectively.
00:52:36.450 - 00:52:45.382, Speaker A: As Jean Claude Junker said, when it gets very serious, you have to lie, as the bankers lied in 2008. And you think that the reason is because people are forgotten how much they lied.
00:52:45.466 - 00:53:36.530, Speaker B: And bank runs are going to continue and they're going to be faster than ever because we are in this new digital era. And so we've seen First Republic SVB just kind of drop to zero overnight. And you think that anywhere that someone flees with their money, if you go from small regional community bank to larger US bank, it doesn't matter because you're still effectively inside of the Fed's system. You're in their prison. And so they're content to let you move from some small community bank to Morgan to a money market. They don't really care because they have root access on all of these systems. And you're saying you're making the case that the dollar, as a result of all of this money printing that is happening through this new form of quantitative easing, which is not called quantitative easing, it's something else.
00:53:36.530 - 00:54:08.890, Speaker B: But during the bank run, all of this money gets printed effectively. And that sends the dollar on a hyperinflation kind of track against all commodities. Maybe, but more specifically, Bitcoin, because people are going to flee the banking system. And they're going to park their assets into the only non root access fed asset class that we have, which is crypto and predominantly bitcoin because that has kind of the mind space for this narrative use case. Anyway, is this the summary of the thesis?
00:54:09.310 - 00:54:29.006, Speaker A: Yes. There's one thing I'd add, though, which is pretty good. One thing I'd add is I expect wage and price controls and so on. So prices on anything that the Fed has, like bread or whatever, they won't allow the price of bread to go to some crazy level. They'll impose price controls on it. So instead you just get shortages. Or the price of this is what happened to the Soviet Union.
00:54:29.006 - 00:55:03.462, Speaker A: The price was low, but the good just wasn't there. Okay? So anything where they can kind of hide the scarcity of it, right, and blame it on the store or whatever. Remember they were trying to say, oh my God, you greedy corporations for raising prices. Remember they were doing that, okay? The only signal, the one honest signal in the world that they can't fully fake is basically the desire to exit from the system. That's literally what this is. Can enough people get to the Bitcoin exit in time before they close the exits?
00:55:03.606 - 00:55:07.082, Speaker B: So you are predicting that's what this close the exits then to Bitcoin?
00:55:07.146 - 00:55:24.654, Speaker A: Yes, as well, because they shut down silvergate. They shut down so silvergate SVB, first Republic, gosh. What's the signature? Signature was murdered. It wasn't even right. So it's like fog of war, as Nick Carter talked about, right? Fog of war. Banks are dying. Boom.
00:55:24.654 - 00:55:59.226, Speaker A: Kill this one. Right? And some of these banks died by bank runs that the Fed itself caused. Some of them were just pulled from licenses, but just have it happen all at the same time. So it's chaos and people can't figure it out when they're outside. Okay? If they're bailing out all of the US. Banks and all of the foreign banks who are connected to the Federal Reserve System at the same time, it's clearly a banking I mean, that people are no longer denying that that's a banking crisis. And what is the effect of that banking crisis? Well, there's basically two possible outcomes.
00:55:59.226 - 00:56:05.890, Speaker A: The first is everybody trusts the banks. At the end of the day, they wire to the banks. What's the name of this podcast?
00:56:07.590 - 00:56:09.054, Speaker B: You know it bankless.
00:56:09.182 - 00:56:56.050, Speaker A: Bankless. And the literal nature of that, I think, is going to actually surprise even us, okay? Because a lot of Fiat banks will either go to zero or will become like Venus fly traps, and you may need some Fiat to pay the bills. I recognize that, okay? Because who knows exactly when and how all this stuff comes about, all right? I totally recognize that. But having at least some of your, like, a good chunk of your net worth, whatever that means to you, in Bitcoin held locally, you will have the strongest technological and social defense on it worldwide, because both matter. And you know why the social defense matters.
00:56:57.190 - 00:56:59.042, Speaker B: What do you mean by social defense, by the way?
00:56:59.096 - 00:57:07.842, Speaker A: Yeah, that's very important. So technological defense is encryption, right? Social defense is is your jurisdiction going to allow you to hold Bitcoin? Right?
00:57:07.896 - 00:57:48.354, Speaker B: So there was in the 1930s, an Executive Order 6102, which was effectively a gold ban on US. Citizens private ownership, right? That's what you mean by social guarantees. The holders of gold were called things like hoarders, for example, that it was just socially uncooperative and socially unproductive and evil, maybe for people to hoard away and store their wealth, to exit the system, if you will, and to have gold bars around your house. We don't have to talk about the US. If you don't want to, but could you imagine this sort of scenario playing out in jurisdictions across the world?
00:57:48.472 - 00:58:42.046, Speaker A: Well, let's just say this in the event. So right now, what we're on pace for is before the fire alarm, before ring the fire alarm, we were on pace for dollar holders becoming bag holders, okay? A stealth digital, dollar devaluation, masked as bailouts again, whether it's intentional or urgent doesn't matter. But essentially you would get all this printed money in your fright. You'd run to the big banks, you'd wire all the money there, you'd be locked in and centralized, and there'd be this CBDC issued with this currency that was worthless against bread or whatever, or the prices were kept low, but the bread wasn't there. So either it's hyper serious inflation or shortages. And by the way, one thing to keep in mind, this is a very important thing. People are like, well come on, dude, like 2008, it was bad, but wasn't the end of the world, blah, blah, blah.
00:58:42.046 - 00:59:39.482, Speaker A: Right? Well, the thing is, people know that the American taxpayer bailed out the banks, right? But what they don't know is actually the world bailed out America. You know why? The US. Exported its inflation, okay? And so the thing is, there's two ways of robbing somebody. The first way of robbing them is gun to their face, they know they're being robbed and so on, okay? The second way, which is much more effective, is silent robbery, where you're even telling them you're doing them a favor or something like this. Egyptians have tasted the bread of liberty, right? People literally set themselves on fire because food prices were so high, okay? You know who it was the end of the world for all of those previously stable countries in like Libya and Tunisia and so on that were just basically set on fire by inflation in the early two thousand s. The Arab Spring wasn't just some that was just absolute pandemonium and chaos caused by essentially okay. Those people get to pay for the financial cris.
00:59:39.482 - 01:00:23.662, Speaker A: But it was so complicated and it was so indirect that everybody can deny that that's actually what happened, okay? Because think about how many transactions are it's on a blockchain. You can't look at it, you can't prove that that happened exactly in that way. You can point at some correlational numbers and so on, but you can look at food prices spike after this printing, and you can ask, okay, where did the inflation go? It got shunted. And before 2008, this is the key chart. Before 2008, Republicans and Democrats were roughly equal, okay? The real GDP, they're roughly equally matched afterwards. What happens? There's a shift. Somehow all the Democrats become much richer on average than all the Republican districts.
01:00:23.662 - 01:01:14.786, Speaker A: So Republicans were taxed by inflation to pay for the financial crisis. So cantel in effect is who gets a printed money first wins. In 2008, the Democrats effectively taxed the Republicans and the foreign dollar holders to pay for the bailout. That's fundamentally what happened, okay? And the foreign dollar holders, they got either directly or indirectly, they had riots and chaos in the Arab Spring, and the domestic ones were impoverished. So it is not that 2008 just was okay, it's that it was shunted. The cost of that was shunted to the invisible. Does that make sense? Right? Basically, in a sense, the most powerless person is the one without a voice, who cannot complain or understand what is happening to them.
01:01:14.968 - 01:02:04.494, Speaker C: Uniswap is the largest on chain marketplace for self custody digital assets.

01:04:25.678 - 01:04:38.306, Speaker B: We are looking at visualizing the purchasing power of the dollar of the last century. So we're looking at a steep decline down from 1917 until 2019.
01:04:38.418 - 01:05:20.034, Speaker A: This is silent theft, okay? It is framed as if it's good for you to take away all of your money because, oh, a little bit of inflation is good. Okay? And fundamentally, by the way, this is where Bitcoin rejects this foundational concept. That is to say, the traditional macroeconomics view is, yeah, hyperinflation is bad, but deflation is also bad. We wouldn't want prices to go down. We want a little mild inflation 2% target or whatever each year. Right? And whereas the Bitcoin view is hyperinflation is of course a catastrophe, but inflation is also just a slow motion catastrophe. Deflation and even hyper deflation are good if they're caused by technology.
01:05:20.034 - 01:05:53.194, Speaker A: Meaning, for example, with Moore's Law, the price of transistor, I mean, it's not exactly it's transistor density doubles every 18 months. That's a technical different. But let's just say the price of computing drops in half every 18 months as an approximate version, right? That's hyper deflation. The cost of something is dropping rapidly. And the traditional macro theory would say when deflation happens, people hoard they don't buy because of price. Right. Except with hyper deflation of computers, even though they keep getting cheaper very fast, we buy a lot of them.
01:05:53.194 - 01:06:29.222, Speaker A: It's a crucial part of the modern world. Right? So the macroeconomic theory that hyper deflation is bad, they don't even think hyper deflation exists, by the way. But the macroeconomic theory of deflation and hyper deflation being bad is not actually with the reality. The reality is when you use technology to reduce the cost of something that's actually good. Okay? This fundamental thing is one of the thing about it is American Keynesianism is bad, just like Soviet economics was bad, it's just slightly less bad, but we don't realize that it's actually also bad. Do you see what I'm saying? It's also fake and what have it's go ahead.
01:06:29.276 - 01:07:07.620, Speaker C: It's a lesser, lesser of two way that I think that what you're saying, Belaji, is the bitcoin meme between ethereum and why you're saying, like, oh, I like you guys, is because obviously me and Ryan are known to be ethereum leaning. But I've always been of the mindset that it's bitcoin during times of war and ethereum during times of peace. And I think the crisis that you are suggesting is that we are in wartime right now. This is a crisis moment where there is a flight. And so this is not a time to be thinking about innovation and layer twos, this is a time to be thinking about safety, simplicity, redundancy, because this is a crisis moment.
01:07:08.010 - 01:07:55.074, Speaker A: That's exactly right. That is exactly right, David. And that's why I tweeted something like, look, I'm not a bitcoin maximalist, but we are all bitcoin maximalists now. You know, in Indian mythology, like the third eye, right? Imagine the third laser eye kind of opening. That's literally what I'm talking about, okay? We are truly in wartime mode and there's a digital fire burning that not everybody can see yet, right? That's why I put up the fire alarm, okay? When I did that, people are still watching TikTok or whatever. If you go back and look at the tweets around that time and now the entire world was talking about, wait, could the dollar hyperinflate against they started to actually whether they yelled at me or not, okay, before I rang the fire alarm. And by the way, I did it with the bit signal first before taking the bet.
01:07:55.074 - 01:08:24.350, Speaker A: The bet just got even more people's attention because it's a very specific kind of thing, right? Bitsignal got a lot of attention in its own right. The point was not to get attention for its own sake. The point was to get attention to get to the lifeboat because the final digital devaluation of the dollar is coming. And did I show you the chart of the hyperinflations, how quickly that can happen? Right? And we just went through a bunch of graphs. We're like First Republic of which went to zero, like this, right? Signature to zero. They just shut it down. Like over a weekend.
01:08:24.350 - 01:09:18.590, Speaker A: The bank printing went to $150,000,000,000 in a few days over the weekend. David, I'm so glad that you get that, right, that in wartime bitcoin, because bitcoin will be protected by enough governments. Bitcoin is well understood and that will be a fundamental cleavage in the world. Which is it's going to be? Are they like, you know, atheist, monotheist, polytheist, right? You know the concept, okay? So in the network state book, I have this concept of God, state and network, okay? And you remember what we were talking about and and the question is, what is your mental model of the world is the most powerful force? Is it Almighty God? Is it the US military, which is the state, right. Or the Chinese military? Or is it encryption right? God, state, network. And then from that you can actually have obviously you have combinations and stuff. I talk about that in the book.
01:09:18.590 - 01:09:45.586, Speaker A: But from that you could have like an atheist monotheist polytheist. So, for example, on the god Leviathan, right? Atheist doesn't believe in God. The monotheist is like Christian, Muslim, Jewish, et cetera. The polytheist is like a Hindu believes in multiple gods. Right, okay. Now with the state you have, the atheist doesn't believe in state. They're like an anarchist, okay? Monostatist, that's like an advocate for empire, like a Chinese nationalist or like a dollar nationalist.
01:09:45.586 - 01:10:41.046, Speaker A: That's what's I think going to come. And then the third is you have a polystatist, like a digital nomad, they hop between states, okay? And then with coins, you have a no coiner, like fiat only, okay? They hate coins, okay? A monocoiner, like a maximalist bitcoin maximalist, and then you have a polycoiner, which is me in normal times, okay? But in wartime, we have to just focus all of our energy behind something. And it's not a portfolio strategy thing. And this is very important. People just don't get it yet. This is not the make money time because everybody's going to be a lot poorer soon, unfortunately. Okay? The actual devaluation of the dollar means the entire party that we lived in where things were all much richer than we'd think, right? That's about to come to an end.
01:10:41.046 - 01:10:56.606, Speaker A: And exactly how much poor we are, I don't know, but America as a new Argentina is not a bad mental model in my view. Right. Do you know what Argentina was? I mean, it obviously still exists, but the rich country that became poor, yeah.
01:10:56.788 - 01:11:10.946, Speaker C: The Argentine agricultural industry is amazing, but then just corruption set in, government mismanagement of money at all. It broke an entire what was once a very rich country, and it just hyperinflation and government corruption just broke it all.
01:11:11.048 - 01:11:16.718, Speaker A: If you're really bad at capital allocation, a rich country will become poor.
01:11:16.814 - 01:11:21.270, Speaker C: You're saying the time has come where we kicked the can down the road, but then it fell off the cliff.
01:11:21.610 - 01:11:57.774, Speaker A: Exactly. Sidewalk ends here, bankruptcy happens gradually and then suddenly and so now the question is, the dollar holder is the bag holder, right. At the end of the day, now, the fire alarm has been to it would have been without the fire alarm, everybody would have just been hit by this digital Pearl Harbor. Right? Because the whole thing, you know, like FTX assets are fine, don't worry, et cetera, et cetera, boom, Venus flytrap, you're done. Right? Because you didn't get your money out in time. Right. So Uncle Sam bankman, Fried is saying assets are fine, et cetera.
01:11:57.774 - 01:12:32.214, Speaker A: And if you have and by the way, it's not just a dollar, by the way, it's basically any fiat currency that is controlled by the US. Or really by China. Okay. Because that's the other sector I'll come to China. Right. Any fiat currency, if you saw that thing where it's mean, I'll clarify because I think there are Saudis or there are countries that have Fiat currencies that the US does not control, India. And whatnot those will probably, in my view, after this crisis, eventually be gold or digital gold backed.
01:12:32.214 - 01:13:19.414, Speaker A: Okay? So that combination of gold plus digital gold, gold will be like a state to state thing where states will be able to trade that amongst themselves and it'll be very ritualized and infrequent. Okay, but it'll happen. But then digital gold will become important. And so literally, you'll need gold and or digital gold to back your currency. It will kind of go back to the 19th century after this Fiat crisis. And all the stuff that we've talked about kind of in crypto, it'll just happen very, very fast. A particularly extreme version of when I talk about absolutely insane inability to allocate resources is this 20 years to build a bathroom.
01:13:19.414 - 01:13:31.850, Speaker A: They held a ribbon cut in several press conference and the photo just tells it all. That's a California state senator and a bunch of people there with a press conference cutting a toilet paper to open a single stall bathroom.
01:13:32.010 - 01:13:35.940, Speaker C: Belaujri, do you subscribe to the whole fourth turning idea?
01:13:37.110 - 01:13:37.860, Speaker A: Yes.
01:13:39.670 - 01:13:42.078, Speaker C: This just kind of feels very forth turning.
01:13:42.254 - 01:13:44.846, Speaker A: It's very force turning. Well, so the idea of the fourth.
01:13:44.878 - 01:14:45.126, Speaker C: Turning is that there's these four cycles of generations and they all relate to each other. But the gist of it, to put it very reductively, is like the whole meme of good times make weak men, and weak men make bad times. And I think the point that you're trying to make with a bunch of just of our leaders, our government leaders who are mocking to cut toilet paper with their fingers to announce the launch of a single stall public bathroom is a bunch of perhaps weak men who are about to create some bad times because we are misallocating our funds. And then the downstream net effect of this is that we make bad financial capital allocation choices, but then we try and cover it up because we are weak men not taking responsibility. And we can do that for only so long. And this is also highly actually related to Ray Dalio's whole entire idea of macro power cycles. And so a lot of this is all kind of like lining up.
01:14:45.126 - 01:15:11.520, Speaker C: And I definitely see the point. And all of this is what you're saying is like you said at the beginning, this isn't necessarily your bet, which is how this whole thing got started. Your bet that Bitcoin hits $1 million inside of 90 days isn't a bet about Bitcoin. It's a bet about the devaluation of the dollar. And also, you said at the very beginning is like there's only two real banks, there's the Federal Reserve and there's Bitcoin. And I actually also 100%.
01:15:12.130 - 01:15:15.342, Speaker A: That's such a good quote. That's great. Do you trust?
01:15:15.396 - 01:15:46.102, Speaker C: And I'll also take the point that just like it's not about ethereum and all of its smart contracts or all that cool stuff. It's all about just like people are going to run and they're going to flee and they're not going to think too critically about where they're going. They're going to see collapsing banks. And this is a function of your average Joe or your average money manager and like, oh, banks are collapsing and I kind of see the devaluation of the dollar. What is my inert spinal reflex? Bitcoin. It's bitcoin. That's my spinal reflex.
01:15:46.102 - 01:15:50.442, Speaker C: That's where I'm going to run to. And I think that's really the punchline that you're kind of like leading up to.
01:15:50.496 - 01:16:18.114, Speaker A: Right? That's exactly right. That's exactly right. It is the shelling point, right? Basically, do you know the concept of the shelling point? It's like coordinating without for, right? So you tell people, hey, meet me in New York City, right, and there's various shelling points people can come up with, but many people will say, okay, I'll meet in front of the Empire State Building because Statue of Liberty, they might say, but that's like kind of an islandish thing. Or they might say the clock in Times Square.
01:16:18.152 - 01:16:19.570, Speaker C: I was going to say Times Square.
01:16:19.720 - 01:16:50.426, Speaker A: Yeah, that's right. So it's not a perfect example, but it is the concept. Or let's say you need to meet in London, where's it going to be Big Ben, right? So that's a better example. San Francisco will be Golden Gate Bridge. Right? That's like the iconic know, right? So the shelling point is how people coordinate without coordinating based on their prior information. And that's what bitcoin is, right? It is basically the thing that everybody in our space respects. Every crypto exchange supports.
01:16:50.426 - 01:17:32.214, Speaker A: It has social defense. I'm not saying we will win. There's going to be some serious attacks, but I'm saying we might be able to win. Right. The question is whether the currency of the people, by the people, for the people will not perish from this earth. And I know that sounds crazy right now, okay? But that's what this one is about because the thing about bitcoin is it can't be seized with the key press. It means that all of that stealth seizure that was happening there, that's just like hitting buttons on a key and okay, there's a billion dollars here.
01:17:32.214 - 01:18:25.054, Speaker A: All of that can't happen anymore because it's outside the system. It's escaped the system. It's literally exited the matrix, right? And then some interesting things are going to happen and so people need to sort of be just locked on philosophically. I mean, the interesting about this, I was going to write an article actually, I'm in the middle of writing it, which is that bitcoin maximalists are best positioned mentally for what's about to happen, in my view. And it's going to be fast, even for them. Okay? Hyperbitcoinization refers to not simply it is the collapse of all fiat currencies against bitcoin, okay? It is a gigantic global quote redistribution of wealth, in a sense. But it's basically like all of the bills of all of the people that have run Keynesian macroeconomics because they kicked the can.
01:18:25.054 - 01:18:39.730, Speaker A: Kick the can, kick the can. They didn't know, at least the British, they gradually handed it over to the next people, right? They gradually handed it over to the Americans. But the Internet is the next America.
01:18:40.070 - 01:19:01.050, Speaker C: I would like to see how this maps into your understanding. And so this is Martin Coppelman saying, detect a pattern. And we've got a bunch of two different kinds of banks, united States banks and Chinese banks. All the Chinese banks are up into the right. All the American banks are down into the right. How does this map into what you're talking about here?
01:19:01.200 - 01:19:42.338, Speaker A: So some people are probably moving deposits. See, what the Fed has now signaled is that actually, do you see Moody? Moody has downgraded the entire US. Banking system, okay? The banking system is negative, okay? You know how, like San Francisco, remember I used to say, like the ascending world, and not used to say I still say it's not about first World and third world. It's the ascending world and the descending world, right? And if you've been to San Francisco, it's not an ascending world. Place it's in a descending world. Place it's poop in the streets and needles and it's like worse than it was 1020 years ago. Whereas India is ascending world, right? The US banking system outlook is negative.
01:19:42.338 - 01:20:15.754, Speaker A: Here's the thing. Powell has turned America into Argentina. The series of bank runs and currency crises and printing and so on, that's about to begin means you will obviously have to have some money in the US. Banking system to pay your bills for whatever so long as this crisis goes on, okay? However, people are going to learn that you cannot trust the state. You can't trust the US. State. It's like a, you know, corrupt government, but at massive scale, right? So a ton of people are going to lose faith in the centralized state all at once when the money is gone.
01:20:15.754 - 01:20:49.258, Speaker A: And if you look at the other tweet I sent, many Fiat banks are dead. Many more are going to die, all because of the Fed, because Powell ain't Satoshi, and the US is run by heirs who wrecked institutions they inherited, including the accounts of dollar holders. And after the Fed kills its own banks, will you want your money in a US. Bank? In a system with insane bank runs where regulators deceive depositors? Powell made america Argentina. So the Internet is a new America. All the next banks are crypto where one BTC equals one BTC, the new reserve currency of the world.
01:20:49.424 - 01:21:33.654, Speaker B: What's hard to believe about this, though, Apology, is this is quite the statement that it happens now and that it happens so fast. That's the part I can't wrap my head around. I mean, obviously, from the inception of bankless, and a lot of people are in this crypto journey because we see what's going on in the background. But the idea that all of this could happen over the next 90 days, that's the part that's boggling to me. I always expected this to be sort of a decades long play here, but you're saying it's here, and what is your certainty that this is the fire alarm, that this is actually happening now? It can't be 100% confidence. Is it in the 90% zone?
01:21:33.782 - 01:22:12.546, Speaker A: I don't know. But I'm going to show you just to rec a bunch of digital graphs, okay? So here's with very relatively little forewarning, okay? There is some warning. And if you go back to December 2022, they're like, you know, banks are going back to the discount window again. It's not something they were doing for a while, and it's because the ones that had bought these bonds or whatever were like, I need some money. You guys crush me. Can you give me some money? Or I don't know what all the reasons were, right? But here's another one where you had some warning, and then it's digital, right? Okay, here's another. Yeah, you had some warning.
01:22:12.546 - 01:22:17.446, Speaker A: There's decline, and then it's digital at the end. You see what I'm saying? Right?
01:22:17.548 - 01:22:21.290, Speaker B: By digital, you mean like, it's gone and it's gone.
01:22:21.440 - 01:22:40.078, Speaker A: It's analog up until the end, and then you enter the digital age. Digital death. Right. It's continuous and it's discrete. It's an analog curve and then just sudden death. It's not like a gradual decline all the way to the end. Okay, you see my point on these? There's not graphs I'm making.
01:22:40.164 - 01:22:50.290, Speaker B: It can happen. It's just so hard to fathom that it happens to the Fed, that it happens to the dollar, that it happens to the United States of America.
01:22:51.990 - 01:22:52.980, Speaker A: I know.
01:22:53.590 - 01:23:43.460, Speaker C: Well, I think really the point here is that the long term vision of this has been predicted by the bitcoiners. And I think even bology is saying that the bitcoin is happening so fast, it's going to actually boggle the bitcoiners minds. And of course, humans aren't supposed to we're not really used to being able to think in these terms. Humans don't think in exponential terms. And so to think that if this idea about ebology is presenting here is correct, if that's true, we are about to enter a phase change that is also accelerated by technology. We're already watching that with the bank runs. And so not only is it one of these times where decades happens inside of weeks, but we've also never had one of those moments of history where a decade happens in weeks with all of the technology that we have.
01:23:43.830 - 01:24:01.382, Speaker A: Yeah. So this is like World War I or something like that. When people were entering world war I, they were starting it. First of all, by the way, let me show you that there is some forewarning, okay? So take a look. At the next link I sent you. So since inception, the US. Dollar, the smart money, has been voting against the dollar and entering Bitcoin.
01:24:01.382 - 01:24:20.298, Speaker A: This has been a joke chart, but it's actually a really important chart. You have had forewarning that the dollar is going to zero against Bitcoin for 13 years. It's actually just like some of those other charts where it was, like, continuous and then it was discrete.
01:24:20.474 - 01:24:48.034, Speaker B: I think part of the troubling thing here is if what you're saying is correct, though, right? So Bitcoin appreciates, but isn't that the end of the United States? I mean, if the dollar hyperinflates, we're in for real bad times in the US. And I guess I might say Western liberal democracies as a whole. And so that is hard medicine to swallow as well, if that's what you're describing.
01:24:48.162 - 01:25:23.986, Speaker A: I know. So here's the thing again, I'm not sure what to say. Because the problem is, if I tell you what my world model is, the thing is there's people who are like, oh, no, you can't ever panic people. I'm like, Look, I never actually call for, quote, panic. What I call for is understanding the severity of the situation and taking calm, conscious steps to ensure yourself against it. Okay. You know, actually did a good job.
01:25:23.986 - 01:25:28.918, Speaker A: I'm very glad that Dalio published his book. Right. Principles. Do you remember this came out last year?
01:25:29.004 - 01:25:29.814, Speaker B: Yeah, it was great.
01:25:29.852 - 01:26:04.650, Speaker A: Right? So big devaluations are abrupt and episodic rather than evolutionary. The six major currency transitions that have happened before have just been like once the alternative appears, the old one just kind of disappears. And we've kind of felt that the US. Has been running on reruns, right? Marvel movies over and over again. We've got 70 year old Fed Chair and Trump and Biden and so on, where people are still, like, refine the Communist Chinese. They're still, like, in this kind of 1980s Cold War war. I have nothing against Southerners.
01:26:04.650 - 01:27:01.380, Speaker A: I like that, but I'm just saying or it's like, oh, my God, we're standing up for this and that, and people are just kind of running their old scripts. Where perhaps the best example of this is what Powell is doing is the 1980s formula of Paul Volcker hiking rates. And he thinks that's the same move at the same thing that worked 40 years ago, he can just kind of do today. And it'll work in exactly the same way. And the state of the world is different, right? So by running those old scripts that don't work anymore, you lose. And one way of thinking about it is on the eve of World War I, right, in 1913, that was a world of kings and princes and horses and so on. There was strain, tension on this world because of the new clanking machines and the industrialization all of this stuff was something which there was obviously tech pressure on it.
01:27:01.380 - 01:28:07.746, Speaker A: You had these social movements. You had people who wanted the vote, you had communists, you had all these different things clanking and straining against this, right? And then there was a catalyst of a few things there's world War I and just like modernity roared into being. When something is born, it's like got blood all over it and so on, right. I'm not saying it's good. I'm saying though, that people started World War I, for example, with horses, and they certainly didn't end it with that, right? The thing is that the future can't actually, you know, it's saying the future is already here, it's just not evenly distributed. Right. If you go to that next photo, the other one I sent you, all those kings, it's kind of like all of these heads of Fiat states, and I'm not saying they all go to zero, right? But those that trusted the Fed and that don't have either natural resources, gold manufacturing or digital gold or something like that to back their Fiat currency will probably be in trouble after the Fiat crisis.
01:28:07.746 - 01:28:18.794, Speaker A: I know that sounds like if you take the full implications of what I'm just saying there, that's actually a pretty big thing, okay? But a lot of these states that trusted the Fed after the Fiat crisis, the money is gone.
01:28:18.992 - 01:28:39.598, Speaker B: This has been a lot balaji and I'm sure you felt the full weight of the things that you're saying over the last few days also on your shoulders. Because if this does come to pass, we will wake up in an entirely new world in whatever time frame, whether it's 90 days or it takes I.
01:28:39.604 - 01:28:46.114, Speaker A: Don'T know the exact time frame exactly. I don't know the exact time frame. I'm just ringing the fire alarm to try to get people to realize the scale of the change that's about to unfold.
01:28:46.162 - 01:29:11.610, Speaker B: And you feel the same way, a similar way as you felt to COVID in January of 2020 when you rang the fire alarm for COVID. And you're saying bank crisis is imminent. This is not just a regular bank crisis, this is the Fiat bank crisis and the fall of the US dollar. So prepare yourselves, get to hard digital assets as soon as you can. And for you, that means bitcoin. That's what you're saying?
01:29:11.760 - 01:29:35.614, Speaker A: I'm saying that. And I'm also saying basically there's four options you can take, okay? And people are going to choose one of these four options. The first is trust US banks, trust the US media. Just like 2008, all the other crises, there's always a crisis. Who cares? Going to go back to TikTok or whatever, okay? A lot of people will do that. Number two is, okay, I actually am seeing that there are something serious going on. This is now something which is like user tangible.
01:29:35.614 - 01:29:52.726, Speaker A: Like a bank run is user tangible. All the other stuff was just sort of like an enterprise thing. What I mean by that is it was just banks it had liabilities to other banks. It was on balance sheets in the back end somewhere, and they could work it out amongst themselves. And there wasn't an impact on you, the end user. Do you know what I'm saying? Right. I don't recall.
01:29:52.726 - 01:30:12.894, Speaker A: At least I don't know if you recall. I don't remember bank runs during the financial crisis, right? Okay. So depositors were taken care of or whatever. Then it was just like moving funds around. It was all made invisible. Okay? Now, so number two is if it's exploded on you, you're an SVB or something, you cannot ignore it. The money is gone, right? And so actually, a lot of people they did is actually wired money.
01:30:12.894 - 01:30:33.720, Speaker A: Now, you know, they're trusting more than the US banking system. A lot of people wired money back to India, okay? They're getting out of the US banking system. Maybe that's what that graph is on China or something like that. Because the US banking system, people were literally calling it and let me speak to this for a second. They're like, oh my God, it's a bailout to want your checking account back. Now, that's just actually a true inversion of what happened. And here's why.
01:30:33.720 - 01:31:37.690, Speaker A: If you go to Mogadishu and people tell you not to go, and then you ask for like a helicopter airlift out, okay, that's a bailout. You took a high risk activity. It's atypical you're making other people risk their lives to get you out, that's a bailout, okay? If you walk down the street and you're attacked by somebody and you're like, call for the police, that's a paid for. That was a low risk activity you took. And this police protection is part of your budget, your subscriber budget. As a citizen, you paid for that, okay? Similarly, if you make a high risk investment that nobody told you to make or whatever and you want your money back, that's a bailout, okay? If you're operating a business checking account and you're just literally just doing by law required to keep your money in a bank and so on with a 200 billion, you have some expectation that these federal regulators that you paid for would give you some hint that not just your bank, but all the banks are insolvent. Especially when they knew it for months and years beforehand.
01:31:37.690 - 01:32:10.378, Speaker A: Okay. And so what actually happened is you paid for all the regulation and got none of the protection. It's a narco tyranny. It's just like in San Francisco, right? You pay for the police, but the only thing they do is issue parking tickets. They don't stop a crazy guy from, like, smashing your window, okay? If you're like an Uber driver in San Francisco, you get the tyranny of the, whatever, $100 parking ticket for being on the side of the road. Then you have the anarchy of the guy who smashes your window and nothing happens to him. Okay? So the same way we are going to have an archa tyranny.
01:32:10.378 - 01:32:39.040, Speaker A: But for banking, we have the tyranny of assets frozen, funds seized, a CBDC, potentially price controls, serious inflation and so on. But the anarchy of the money can be gone. And it's your fault because you were supposed to read the statement and find that it hid in a footnote. Their $80 billion loss that makes the bank insolvent. That's not practically regulation. That's not consumer protection. That is a third world country.
01:32:39.040 - 01:33:46.258, Speaker A: Do you see what I'm saying? That is a corrupt regime that has betrayed its citizens and the full scope of what that betrayal means. See, most people won't be able to process that, okay? Some people will because they've got because what it is, it's like their God has died. Do you know what know like to truly think of the US state as betraying you to that extent? Not just like making an error or something like that, but something where the banking system has lost all the money of all the people, right? Like an error of that extent is something which just crashes people's operating system. And then what's going to happen is one of two things or a few things, right? First is they're foreigners and they're in a place with a functional government. I hope that India, Israel can stand up to be the leaders of the free world and what is to follow. Okay? Second is they're in a place know, Russia or China. And if what I'm saying is actually what's happened, if the money is gone and this is like that final crisis, okay, then you have to assume that all kinds of troops get pulled back.
01:33:46.258 - 01:34:33.566, Speaker A: Ukraine, that just stops happening. Russia and China, which were kind of in a box before, and they were getting sanctions put on them and all this stuff that just stress tension loosens. And you have this just unleashed russian bear and the Chinese dragon are just like Roar because they're let out of their cage. Could it be that Taiwan is captured without a shot and TSMC, now the sanctions are on the west? Quite possible. Very possible. And the only thing is, by the way, the fundamental premise, all of this is just like with Corona, right? I only had one premise, and that premise was this is going exponential. We're going to have millions of people infected and a lot of people are going to die.
01:34:33.566 - 01:34:51.546, Speaker A: And nobody understands this now because they're not actually calculating out that from that and only from that, I had a rubber band tension model of the world and I was figuring out what things would move on that. Okay, it wasn't a perfect there are things I got wrong or whatever. I thought full face mask covering would be there. But I do want to show you.
01:34:51.568 - 01:35:14.240, Speaker B: This, which is this is Max Roser tweeting, your original COVID tweet saying the world has changed so much in just the ways Balogy predicted it might. Be almost hard to appreciate how prescient this thread was when he wrote it at a time when nothing had changed yet one year ago today. Is that what you anticipate people tweeting about? Your original Bitcoin bit signal tweet one year from now?
01:35:16.130 - 01:35:17.280, Speaker A: I hope not.
01:35:18.070 - 01:35:20.900, Speaker C: I also hope not. For the record, maybe.
01:35:23.910 - 01:35:32.950, Speaker A: But I should probably tweet that. I should say this a bet I hope I won't win, in a sense. Right? Yeah.
01:35:33.020 - 01:35:50.060, Speaker C: I think from paying attention to your tweet and your gamble biology, I think that would actually go a long way because, like kind of we said in the intros, some people are just thinking, like, oh, it's profitable for him to make this trade by tweeting this or something like that.
01:35:50.690 - 01:35:55.200, Speaker B: Or else he wants to watch burn something like this.
01:35:55.970 - 01:36:02.270, Speaker C: Yeah. It bothers you. This has been very scary, if not informative.
01:36:04.530 - 01:36:32.282, Speaker A: Yeah. And hopefully I've given you enough links to give you a sense of this is not just me coming up with stuff. I don't know, there's like 50 or 60 references or what have you. Right. I have a role model here which might be wrong, but that shows that this financial cris is actually a very extreme one. I'll leave you with one last thing, which is, you know the Ray Dalio principles for the changing world order? Yeah. So that's right.
01:36:32.282 - 01:36:59.374, Speaker A: So the video of it is yeah, you're right. There are two separate books. The video of it is really good to watch. And the thing is, Dalio did something very smart with this video. He got the concepts across with cartoons. And with the cartoons, you can kind of process it without realizing how serious what he's talking about is. The collapse of empires.
01:36:59.374 - 01:37:34.640, Speaker A: Right. Lots of people fighting, no money. Right. With the cartoons, you can process it, but then you have to apply it. That's a key thing because there's something about it. Know, history is like we're on like a cycle because people live and die and so on, right? And the thing about this is, here's the one thing that Dalio doesn't get, okay? And he's a really smart guy. He gets politics and he gets finance, right? And he gets history, but he doesn't get technology.
01:37:34.640 - 01:37:47.458, Speaker A: And so what he doesn't see is that there's actually another force that is as big as China that hopefully becomes the leader of the free world in the aftermath, and that is technology.
01:37:47.624 - 01:38:06.360, Speaker C: I think Ryan and I have also shared our critiques of Ray Dalio is that everything, that his whole patterns and cycles throughout history is all spot on, but he just misses the next phase change as a result to crypto. I think he started to get it, but I don't really know how complete his understanding is about all of.
01:38:08.490 - 01:38:58.600, Speaker A: Partially, he's right about one thing, which is if we don't have a critical mass of people in the free world get out to Bitcoin, then China is number one after this, and they're out of their cage because the money going to China is like, well, China is the stable system. China gives you stability, right? It doesn't give you the chaos of the US. It also gives you totalitarian control of the CBDC, but at least it's a stable version. Unfortunately, a lot of people will go for know the thing about this. By the way, I talked about this in the network state book, between American anarchy and Chinese control, right? We want the decentralized center, we want to have the free world, and really, this is the moment. So take everything you guys have said seriously over the last five years, everything you've got, all the concepts, okay? And help your guys go bankless that's it.
01:38:58.970 - 01:40:01.574, Speaker B: Balaji, we're going to end it there. This has been very helpful to walk through your brain and to kind of understand all of the pieces that you've put together here recently. And we'll certainly be having someone on to do the counterpoint to talk about reasons why this might not come to pass or might not come to pass so soon. But we really wanted to unpack your brain here today, and certainly if what happens comes to pass, it will be absolutely world changing, the biggest event of our lifetime, and I don't think any bankless listener will be fully prepared for it. So it's worth taking a moment to understand and dissect Balogy's arguments, to look through the references and links that we put forth in this episode and do your own research and come to your own conclusion on this and to do it fast. I think if things collapse in the expedient way that bology is predicting, you may not have much time to put the pieces together in the aftermath of this. Balaji, thank you so much for coming on Bankless.
01:40:01.574 - 01:40:02.986, Speaker B: Once again, we appreciate you.
01:40:03.088 - 01:40:39.238, Speaker A: Thanks. And I'll say one last thing, which is, even if what you think I'm saying is crazy, hopefully it will be something that now you've been exposed to at least once, and as you see events unfold, you might think, okay, some percentage of that might be correct, and then take action, if that makes any sense. It's like a retargeting of some kind, right? You have a different frame or lens to view events, just like that original corona thread where people might have thought it was crazy and then they had the lens to view events anyway. All right, guys, get your coins, get your Bitcoin, get your coins off exchanges, get to a crypto friendly jurisdiction if you can. There it is.
01:40:39.324 - 01:40:47.426, Speaker B: That is the alarm. Risks and disclaimers, guys. Got to end it here. Of course, none of this has been financial advice, maybe just simple life advice.
01:40:47.538 - 01:40:49.250, Speaker A: Life advice, that's all. Yep.
01:40:49.330 - 01:41:02.380, Speaker B: Bitcoin is risky, so is ETH, so is crypto, but my God, the banking system is more risky than ever. You could definitely lose what you put in but we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
