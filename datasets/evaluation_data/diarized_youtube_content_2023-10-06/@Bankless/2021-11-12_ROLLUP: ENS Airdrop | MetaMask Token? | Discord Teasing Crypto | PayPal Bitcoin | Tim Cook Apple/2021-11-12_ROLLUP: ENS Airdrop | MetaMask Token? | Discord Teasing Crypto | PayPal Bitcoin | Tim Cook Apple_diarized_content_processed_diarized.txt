00:00:07.370 - 00:00:10.862, Speaker A: Happy second week of November, bankless nation. David, what time is it?
00:00:10.916 - 00:00:26.200, Speaker B: It's the Friday weekly roll up where we roll up the entire week of crypto. It's my favorite part of the week is when we get to talk about all the crypto things, all the fun things that happened, and there's always fun thing that's happening, and then we get to talk about it for way too long. And that's why these shows for an hour and a half.
00:00:26.570 - 00:00:44.794, Speaker A: That's right. But you know what? It's really fun. It's like a way to digest everything that's going on. It actually puts me at peace because every single week in crypto, I feel like this frenzy of frenetic activity. And then after the weekly roll up, I'm like, I've absorbed it. Now I know what's going on. And that's why I enjoy this time, too.
00:00:44.794 - 00:00:54.682, Speaker A: Other than that, it's also fun. There's so much going on, but I feel like the box is checked. I got through another week of crypto and I absorbed as much material as I could.
00:00:54.736 - 00:01:02.862, Speaker B: Yeah, listeners think that we know all these things before we talk about them, but no, we're just learning as we read them aloud. And so let's go ahead and get started with that, guys.
00:01:02.916 - 00:01:26.134, Speaker A: Some hot topics this week, including the Ens Airdrop. All right, so if you have a eth, you probably had a right to claim some Ens tokens and those skyrocketed in price. We're going to talk about that. We're going to talk about the potential of other airdrops as well. Metamask with a token. Question mark, question mark, question mark, discord, teasing, ethereum integration. They did some teasing, too.
00:01:26.134 - 00:01:41.782, Speaker A: Their CEO, nonetheless. And then they kind of rug pulled it. So let's talk about that. Tim Cook, see bullish on Crypto David. And also, bankless is launching a new podcast. What we are, because we need another podcast.
00:01:41.846 - 00:01:43.610, Speaker B: Wait, are you doing your own podcast?
00:01:43.770 - 00:01:47.226, Speaker A: Oh, you'll have to tune into the full roll up to hear all the details.
00:01:47.258 - 00:01:48.590, Speaker B: Brian's doing a podcast.
00:01:51.090 - 00:02:01.186, Speaker A: A few things we've got to mention before we get into it. The first is this. Look at this. This just dropped last week. This week it's still going on. This is the Bankless. We're going to make it.
00:02:01.186 - 00:02:15.958, Speaker A: Hoodie, dude. I got a hoodie. I also got a t shirt. You can get both of those. This is a bankless Dow metafactory collaboration drop. And if you recall, these things only last for like a week or so. Actually, this is your last day to get this.
00:02:15.958 - 00:02:30.342, Speaker A: Wow. Okay, I'm just reading that now. November twelveth is the last day. So if you want this hoodie, if you want the shirt, go ahead and pick it up. Of course, you put in your metamask, and there's also some robot for you waiting on the other side. Eventually.
00:02:30.486 - 00:02:38.986, Speaker B: People love the shirts that. The bankless shirts that I'm wearing out at these crypto conferences. And every time I tweet about it, hey, where can I get that shirt? And I'm like, yo, it's too late.
00:02:39.018 - 00:02:39.578, Speaker A: You missed.
00:02:39.674 - 00:02:47.802, Speaker B: That's why you always have to get every single drop, because you don't know if you're going to want it in the future or not. It's insurance, right? You got to get every single drop.
00:02:47.946 - 00:02:52.798, Speaker A: It is scarce, right? You only have a specific time window. If you don't get it there, it never comes back. It's gone.
00:02:52.884 - 00:02:54.106, Speaker B: Yeah, this is scarce merch.
00:02:54.138 - 00:02:54.286, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:02:54.308 - 00:03:02.886, Speaker B: So that sale ends tonight at midnight Eastern, 09:00 p.m. Pacific time. So if you are listening to this on Friday morning, you don't have too long to get this.
00:03:02.988 - 00:03:06.258, Speaker A: And if it's Saturday, you're too late. Should listen to these on Friday.
00:03:06.434 - 00:03:08.086, Speaker B: Sorry, guys, you're not going to make.
00:03:08.108 - 00:03:21.770, Speaker A: It to the weekend t shirt, but you are going to make this. I think you have some extra time for this. This is Dharma. Go sign up for their smart contract wallet. It's a mobile app. It's super easy. Connect your bank account to Dharma in, like, 10 minutes.
00:03:21.770 - 00:03:46.722, Speaker A: You can go from bank account all the way to DFI. So do this and then invite a friend, because waiting for you on the other side is $50 in ETH, and that is deposited, I think, relatively instantly. You just have to trade $500 worth of tokens. So good place to start with DFI. Bank to bankless in 10 minutes. And make sure you click the bankless link in order to get this code. And get the $50 in ETh on the other side.
00:03:46.722 - 00:04:03.666, Speaker A: That's where it's waiting for you. Great user experience, too. I mean, these wallets are getting extremely impressive, guys. If you are new in this space, this technology was not available a year ago or, like, two years ago or, like, oh, my God, three years ago. This would have been beyond our wildest dreams.
00:04:03.698 - 00:04:05.062, Speaker B: Magic. It's pure magic.
00:04:05.206 - 00:04:16.878, Speaker A: Yeah, it's pure magic. We're living the future. Go check this out. Even if you have other wallets, it's good to have a dharma wallet as well. All right. Also, David, we're doing office hours. Tell them what's going on.
00:04:17.044 - 00:04:45.602, Speaker B: Office hours with Ryan and David. So this is a premium member perk. We get ton of requests for people that just want to ask us simple questions. We don't really have time for everyone's questions. But if you are a premium member, we are setting aside 90 minutes to chat with you and answer all of your questions. If you are trying to get into crypto, I know you want those trusted resources to ask all of your questions that maybe they're noob questions, maybe you don't know, but you want to ask the people that you're comfortable with asking. Maybe that's me and Ryan.
00:04:45.602 - 00:05:14.270, Speaker B: And so if you are a bankless premium member, we are doing office hours November 19 from 04:00 p.m. To 05:30 p.m. Eastern time. This is going to be the last Friday of every single month. This is going to be a reoccurring thing, except for this month because of Thanksgiving, and then also except for next month because of the holidays. But after that, every last Friday of the month, we're going to have office hours for bankless premium subscribers, going to be in the premium discord. So if you want to take part in that q a session, sign up for bankless premium so we can answer your questions.
00:05:14.420 - 00:05:37.990, Speaker A: Yeah, you sign up for bankless premium, you get a link to the discord, and then we'll open this channel to you. And should emphasize too, like noob questions, welcome. If you have just something you think is like, a dumb question or too stupid to ask, something that's just taking too long to research on Google, that's where you can ask the question. Right. And we are happy to answer. And so is the bankless team, the rest of the bankless staff. All right, David, let's get to it, man.
00:05:37.990 - 00:05:43.482, Speaker A: Market time. Sorry, stuff happening in the markets. What's bitcoin doing to us or for us this week?
00:05:43.536 - 00:05:46.310, Speaker B: Well, remember how it was all time high last week? Last week, Ryan?
00:05:46.390 - 00:05:47.642, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, that happened.
00:05:47.696 - 00:06:06.286, Speaker B: All time high a week this week. Yeah, absolutely. So, yeah, bitcoin painted a new all time high of $68,640, almost hitting that magic, magic meme number of $69,000. Not quite there. Tumbled a little bit off the high. Currently at $65,300. Oh, no.
00:06:06.286 - 00:06:15.054, Speaker B: Excuse me. It's $64,700. Dropped a little bit since last I checked. Overall, up 3.6% on the week. So bitcoin, all time high week for bitcoin. Congrats.
00:06:15.102 - 00:06:30.570, Speaker A: Do you know what our friend Raul Paul said when we had him on in what, August or so, we were like, hey, give us some price targets, right? And I was thinking he'd be very vague and not give a time horizon. He's like, boom. 100k bitcoin end of year, ten k eth end of year mic drop.
00:06:30.990 - 00:06:33.766, Speaker B: We're getting close. Feels very much within striking distance.
00:06:33.878 - 00:06:40.954, Speaker A: We are within striking distance to Raul Paul's numbers, and that didn't seem as likely a few months ago. What's eth doing for us?
00:06:40.992 - 00:07:00.482, Speaker B: Eth, same story. Also, all time high week, hitting a new high of $4,850. Immediately after hitting that high, it tumbles $350 down to $4,500. It's crazy to see Ether make $350 moves inside of 1 hour. Think how crazy.
00:07:00.536 - 00:07:06.738, Speaker A: I didn't even think about that. Do you remember when ETH was below $350? Yeah. That would have meant dropping to zero, sir.
00:07:06.824 - 00:07:34.906, Speaker B: Yeah. But after tumbling $350 down to the low, low price of $4,500, it has since reclined up to $4,730 at the time of recording overall, up almost 4% on the week. So ether new time, all time high, bitcoin all time high, all time high week. And also a little something behind the scenes. But the bankless podcast downloads, charts looks like the bitcoin and ether charts right now. So we are also bankless.
00:07:34.938 - 00:07:35.886, Speaker A: Except it doesn't go down.
00:07:35.908 - 00:07:36.814, Speaker B: Except it doesn't go down.
00:07:36.852 - 00:07:37.422, Speaker A: That is true.
00:07:37.476 - 00:07:39.434, Speaker B: Yeah. Up only on the bankless lessons.
00:07:39.482 - 00:08:06.070, Speaker A: Yeah. Do you know what? Okay, so two things. One, five k continues to elude us, right? Every other day when I see kind of like a run up, I'm just like, five k today, question mark. And I throw it out on twitter, and it doesn't happen. So maybe that's a top signal. Maybe I should stop doing that and doing the Anthony Sasano thing. The other thing I'll say is this drop, this sudden $350 drop in the price of eth, bitcoin got hit, too.
00:08:06.070 - 00:08:20.438, Speaker A: Was this, like, what were the rumors going around? I saw, like, evergrande or something? Some sort of weird fud, whatever. I just pay no attention to these things because they're so temporal and temporary and it didn't matter. Do you think that was just an explanation?
00:08:20.534 - 00:08:21.206, Speaker B: I have no clue.
00:08:21.238 - 00:08:21.802, Speaker A: For the price.
00:08:21.856 - 00:08:32.654, Speaker B: I have no clue. Right. It barely dropped below where it started in the week, and so it went from super high to just really high. Maybe it was Evergrande. I don't know. I just think it's funny at this point.
00:08:32.772 - 00:08:40.446, Speaker A: Just don't try to explain these things. Right. Sometimes bots leverage traders games. In the short run, you'll see moves like this. Yeah.
00:08:40.468 - 00:08:46.246, Speaker B: You only see moves like this when you zoom in on the one week charts. Like when you zoom out on the one year charts, it doesn't actually show up.
00:08:46.268 - 00:08:47.798, Speaker A: Let's do it. Yeah, I'm going to zoom out in.
00:08:47.804 - 00:08:50.370, Speaker B: The, like, you can't actually see it. Yeah, it's not there anymore.
00:08:50.450 - 00:08:51.078, Speaker A: It's gone.
00:08:51.164 - 00:09:01.674, Speaker B: Wow, look at that. Up and to the right. Can you go down to the very bottom of that? Up and to the right trend right a little bit to sometime between November and September where it just starts linearly going up right there.
00:09:01.712 - 00:09:01.962, Speaker A: Okay.
00:09:02.016 - 00:09:11.178, Speaker B: So, yeah, around the early and October, we have just been linearly up and to the right perfectly. That's crazy. That's crazy.
00:09:11.264 - 00:09:23.550, Speaker A: This is stairstepping, I guess, like feature. These stairs are little hilltops, little mountains. We're just stair stepping out. That's a really interesting looking chart. Let's zoom out a little further, though. Look at that. This is not logarithmic, but you can hit that log.
00:09:23.550 - 00:09:24.286, Speaker A: Do you remember?
00:09:24.388 - 00:09:26.320, Speaker B: Hit that log on the bottom.
00:09:26.850 - 00:09:31.438, Speaker A: I want to see it in linear first. Do you remember 2018? Yes. This was the high my friend burned.
00:09:31.454 - 00:09:32.418, Speaker B: Into my, look at it.
00:09:32.504 - 00:09:35.838, Speaker A: Just a tiny little, tiny little blip. Yeah, tiny little blip.
00:09:35.934 - 00:09:48.406, Speaker B: Famously, there's the trader memes is when the top of the previous market cycle just doesn't actually show up anymore on linear view. You can still see it, but it's getting small. It's getting pretty small.
00:09:48.508 - 00:09:58.582, Speaker A: Do you know what's crazy is I was listening to your griff green layer zero, which is great, by the way. I really enjoyed that. Anyway, do you remember the Dow crash?
00:09:58.726 - 00:09:59.420, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:10:01.310 - 00:10:18.942, Speaker A: You can't even see on the chart. So this was like the massive wifo moment where we're f, it's over. When the Dow collapsed and EtH price totally lost, like 50, 60, 70, 80% of its value, basically in a very short time span, like a month time period of time. You can't even see it on this chart.
00:10:19.006 - 00:10:35.654, Speaker B: All right, hit the, hit that log button just to appease me and the viewers. Look at that. That is sustainable, dude. Look how vertical the price action was in 2017 right at that blow off top. And look how not vertical it is right now. That's pretty cool. That's pretty cool.
00:10:35.654 - 00:10:37.234, Speaker B: This seems very sustainable.
00:10:37.362 - 00:10:41.846, Speaker A: Are we falling in love with charts right now? Should we get someone on the bankless podcast to chart with us?
00:10:41.868 - 00:10:52.970, Speaker B: David, perhaps, perhaps. I'm in conversations right now with Ben Cohen, who I believe last I checked, just said that he's down to come chart with us on Tuesday. So charity chart show on the bankless livestream.
00:10:53.330 - 00:11:16.310, Speaker A: We don't do charting very often, so this is a special treat. And I do feel like it's kind of like know I'll partake in it every once in a while, but I know it's not really good for know, but every once in a while I'll indulge myself. So that's what's happening. Hopefully next Tuesday we'll have a charting show at the state of the nation. David, another chart eth bitcoin ratio. What are we looking like? Yeah.
00:11:16.380 - 00:11:31.820, Speaker B: In comparison to where we were at last week, we are up just a tiny little smidge. We were at last week. We are at 73. So up basically like 1% on the week overall. Kind of flat, but flat at a very high level.
00:11:32.590 - 00:11:42.762, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess we're looking at to see if we can beat the highs of the year on the ratio. And looks like we're still getting close.
00:11:42.816 - 00:11:42.986, Speaker B: Right.
00:11:43.008 - 00:11:43.980, Speaker A: The highs are.
00:11:46.110 - 00:11:50.138, Speaker B: Eight. That will be a fun day when that breaks.
00:11:50.314 - 00:11:54.638, Speaker A: Total locked value above 100 billion. Ryan likes to see that.
00:11:54.724 - 00:11:59.758, Speaker B: $112,000,000,000 locked in DFI. You know what's interesting about this week on total lock value in DFI.
00:11:59.774 - 00:12:01.538, Speaker A: Ryan, what's interesting?
00:12:01.624 - 00:12:05.590, Speaker B: Maker Dow number one. It has been a long time.
00:12:05.660 - 00:12:05.986, Speaker A: Maker.
00:12:06.018 - 00:12:20.458, Speaker B: Maker Dow is the number one. Hello. Welcome back to the King Thrones, Maker. Did you see somebody minted? Did I put that tweet in there? Oh, yeah, I did put that tweet in there. I don't know if you pulled it up or not.
00:12:20.624 - 00:12:21.706, Speaker A: I don't think I did, but yeah.
00:12:21.728 - 00:12:33.338, Speaker B: So one single person, I believe this is Celsius, actually. Celsius, the lending app. Unconfirmed, though. Minted $150,000,000 of DAi in 1.
00:12:33.424 - 00:12:34.254, Speaker A: Celcius did this.
00:12:34.292 - 00:12:46.978, Speaker B: Celsius minted $150,000,000 with a liquidation price of 3150 ether, which is a pretty high number. But yeah. Celsius minted $150,000,000 and that's why Maker Dow is number one in the TVL charts today.
00:12:47.144 - 00:13:03.590, Speaker A: Well, that's super interesting, actually. And that's interesting on a number of levels. Not just maker number one, but Celsius doing the minting. That's kind of DFI mullet thesis. Celsius being sort of like a blockfly, like a crypto bank, if you will. And they're doing something to generate yields now. They're using DFI protocols right.
00:13:03.590 - 00:13:04.562, Speaker A: Protocols sync.
00:13:04.626 - 00:13:09.462, Speaker B: Yeah, this is actually not new. Celsius has always been minting with maker just for.
00:13:09.516 - 00:13:10.582, Speaker A: No way. I didn't know that.
00:13:10.636 - 00:13:15.658, Speaker B: This is an old thing, but, like, $150,000,000 is. That's the new thing. That's a large number.
00:13:15.744 - 00:13:23.286, Speaker A: It's a lot of money. That's news to me, too, though. Okay, let's talk about the DPI. DFI pulse index. Was it a good week for DFI?
00:13:23.398 - 00:13:37.054, Speaker B: Oh, you bet it was. Started at $370, currently clocking in at $410, up 9% on the week. Even hit a high of $442 before that big drop. So, yeah, DPI, strong performance this week.
00:13:37.172 - 00:13:42.686, Speaker A: D five is back, baby. It's too soon to say. David's knocking on wood.
00:13:42.718 - 00:13:43.198, Speaker B: Knocked on wood.
00:13:43.214 - 00:13:50.130, Speaker A: Yeah, it's too soon to say. But you know what tells us the truth is the defi to eth ratio.
00:13:51.590 - 00:13:57.718, Speaker B: Yo, at this point, flat is up. It was flat this week. The dti versus eth flat is up.
00:13:57.804 - 00:14:02.214, Speaker A: That's not the most capitulation cope sentence I've ever heard.
00:14:02.412 - 00:14:11.414, Speaker B: The DtI versus Eth pair did not go down this week. It held its ground. In fact, it is up 0.4%. So, congratulations to DPi.
00:14:11.462 - 00:14:13.786, Speaker A: I wish I had some skis so I could ski down that hill.
00:14:13.818 - 00:14:16.320, Speaker B: David, you'd be going real fast.
00:14:17.650 - 00:14:26.962, Speaker A: Well, let's talk about bed, which is the ultimate split, where you get a third, a third, a third, a third bitcoin, a third eth, and a third DPi. What are we looking at on the week?
00:14:27.016 - 00:14:54.554, Speaker B: Yeah, very strong performance by the bed index, which, of course, illustrates the market as a whole. And the market as a whole was up 6.3% this week. Started the week at roughly $182, currently clocking in at $195. If you want to get some bed, you can go buy it or mint it@indexcoop.com. Bed sleep comfy in bed. If crypto is stressing you out because of the volatility, the bed index is meant for you, so get comfy in bed.
00:14:54.672 - 00:14:59.338, Speaker A: I love this chart, man. It's just so much more muted than, like, bitcoin and ETH and DPI, because.
00:14:59.344 - 00:15:00.618, Speaker B: It'S just, like, up only.
00:15:00.784 - 00:15:18.660, Speaker A: Yeah, well, yes, exactly. And it's less, like, up and the down. And it looks like the adult in the room here. Good job, bed. Let's talk about this. This happened, and I barely remember it. So apparently, last week, crypto market cap just topped $3 trillion.
00:15:18.660 - 00:15:29.574, Speaker A: $3 trillion. Wow. Where does this end, David? Where are we going to end this cycle over ten, if you believe in cycles over ten. Over ten.
00:15:29.612 - 00:15:30.502, Speaker B: Absolutely over ten.
00:15:30.556 - 00:15:37.880, Speaker A: Yeah, that's easier to call now, I feel like. But like, 3,000,000,000,012 months ago, 18 months ago.
00:15:39.050 - 00:15:59.854, Speaker B: I remember in December of 2017, we crossed a trillion dollar crypto market cap in the IcO mania. And I remember asking my friends, like, all right, guys, bets on when we cross $10 trillion. And I think I remember saying May, 6 months later, yeah, I was wrong. I was the top.
00:16:00.052 - 00:16:18.402, Speaker A: But you know what? This is how the human brain works, right? Do you remember? Let's see, 18 months ago, again, people started, us included, started calling for, like, EtH to ten k. Right? Now when I post, hey, Eth is still on the road to ten k. Everyone's like, that's fud.
00:16:18.546 - 00:16:19.682, Speaker B: Ten k is bearish.
00:16:19.746 - 00:16:36.762, Speaker A: Yeah, they're like, ten k is bearish. Now people are calling for one hundred k. And this is how market psychology works, right? Market psychology, it's always like, now $10 trillion. Because we're at 3 trillion. That feels very rational. Obviously, it's going to 10 trillion. You can't be wrong with that prediction, sir.
00:16:36.762 - 00:16:45.038, Speaker A: Right. But if you were to say 100 trillion, that would be crazy. And if you were to say, hey, it's going back to 100 billion, that would also be crazy.
00:16:45.124 - 00:16:45.422, Speaker B: Right?
00:16:45.476 - 00:16:48.414, Speaker A: So this is how it always works every single cycle, right?
00:16:48.452 - 00:16:48.922, Speaker B: Bullishness.
00:16:48.986 - 00:16:49.594, Speaker A: Posts are moved.
00:16:49.642 - 00:17:16.994, Speaker B: Bullishness begets bullishness, begets bullishness. People are like, oh, this thing's one dollars. Well, if it can get to $2, it could probably get to, like, $5. And if it could get to $5, it could probably get to $10. And then this just goes and goes and goes, like, oh, I get $10, I get $100. And at some point, it just all blows up, right? It turns on just like this very ingrained, speculative fervor that humans have. But again, when we looked at the slope of bitcoin and ether, very sustainable.
00:17:16.994 - 00:17:19.590, Speaker B: We're not there yet. We're not there yet, but maybe we will.
00:17:19.740 - 00:17:48.786, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. And there's different sectors now in crypto where things can bubble, where other things are not bubling. Let's talk about this, though. I saw this chart. Someone put out a fantastic report, and this is a graph of how long it took some major companies, and also bitcoin, to reach a 500 billion dollar valuation. That's a lot. So it took Apple about 36 years to do that, to hit $500 billion in market cap in total value.
00:17:48.786 - 00:18:07.682, Speaker A: It took Amazon less time 23 years. It took Tesla 17 years, it took Google just over 14. Facebook did it in 13. You could see the trend here. Bitcoin did it in twelve years to $500 billion. ETH just did it in six years. Okay.
00:18:07.756 - 00:18:16.540, Speaker B: ETH is the only chart that you see here that did it in less than half the time of the other examples on the chart. Absolutely crazy.
00:18:20.030 - 00:19:04.646, Speaker A: What are we saying here? Somebody could say, well, the value of the dollar is not what it used to be. Okay, sure, that's some effect. But I think what we're really seeing is the difference between these computing revolutions here, right? So you see like an apple, which was a massive revolution in compute, but it was physical, like physical computers, like the pc revolution, it led that and then led mobile. And then we get kind of the Internet with the Google and the Facebook and the Amazon, right? And that's a revolution in of itself. Now we have the network revolution, the network economy that this has turned into. And this is where you see ether and bitcoin. And how fast the growth can be in these economies is absolutely astounding.
00:19:04.646 - 00:19:06.666, Speaker A: This is like blitz scale growth here. Yeah.
00:19:06.688 - 00:19:40.534, Speaker B: And there's such a strong story to be told here. First off, the pace of innovation, of not just crypto, but overall innovation always gets faster and faster and faster. And when we start these shows, we always say, such a crazy week in crypto. Well, when a network grows to 500 billion dollar valuation in the most record time, 5.8 years, that's because there's always so much stuff happening. And this actually reminds me of that line that we said with Josh Rosenthal in our crypto Renaissance podcast. The actual renaissance took time because you actually had to build out the printing presses, and then it had to actually diffuse out from a central point.
00:19:40.534 - 00:20:04.590, Speaker B: The Ethereum is actually being built on another network. So it's a network on top of a network, and it's being birthed across the globally. And also, it's not just bitcoin, where there's only BTC. You can do any assets, any nfTs, whatever, on Ethereum. And so this malleability, this open sourceness, this permissionlessness of Ethereum allowed it to be the fastest growing network in history, which is pretty cool.
00:20:04.740 - 00:20:21.220, Speaker A: Totally. Yeah. Chris Dixon made the point when we had him on that. Like the Internet, something like Ethereum is a network of networks, right? All of these other examples are companies. These are companies. And so their permission, you have to hire employees. Like with Ethereum, people just work for Ethereum for free.
00:20:21.220 - 00:20:37.574, Speaker A: They set up shop there, right? They don't have to be hired. And so it is continuously expanding in all of these directions at once. So no wonder we're seeing this level of growth. David, this is your take. This is from actually Coinbase. I believe this is their quarterly earnings report. Yeah.
00:20:37.574 - 00:20:38.566, Speaker A: What happened here? Yeah.
00:20:38.588 - 00:20:54.586, Speaker B: So last quarter it was the first quarter that ether volume was the number one traded asset on Coinbase for the first time ever, passing bitcoin. And this quarter it happened again. So for two quarters in a row, ether the number one most traded asset on Coinbase.
00:20:54.778 - 00:21:25.910, Speaker A: What is the definition of monetary premium? Right. And what is money? One of the definitions that we've talked about since early in the podcast a couple of years ago was liquidity. Depth of the order book is basically a good definition of money. And this is always something that bitcoiners have said for a long time. Right. Why is bitcoin money? It's because it is the most saleable good, the most liquid asset. Well, it's interesting when ether starts to surpass bitcoin on the exchanges.
00:21:25.910 - 00:21:43.118, Speaker A: Hard to deny now that ether is money, and it meets the same criteria for money that bitcoin did, although there was a lot of denial of that in 2018 and 2019. Yeah, I feel somewhat vindicated on that whole ETH is money thing. David, how about you?
00:21:43.204 - 00:22:14.886, Speaker B: Yeah, 100%. And I'd like to see the numbers for other exchanges, because centralized exchanges is where bitcoin finds its liquidity, and ether can also find its liquidity there. It's finding its liquidity there. It's the most liquid asset on Coinbase, and that's not even counting all of the liquidity in Defi. And so if you want to add the global liquidity of ether, you have to add the centralized exchange liquidity of which, at least ether is dominating on Coinbase, and it's also clearly dominating in DeFi because it's all on Ethereum. Ether the most liquid asset of all time.
00:22:15.068 - 00:22:29.722, Speaker A: Yeah, it seems to be the case. All right, guys, we got a lot more to talk about. We're going to get to releases, of course, and the news of the week. Man, there's so much news to talk about, too. But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:22:29.856 - 00:23:11.142, Speaker B: Gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange. I've been a customer of Gemini since I first got into crypto in 2017, and it's been my main exchange of choice to make. My crypto buys and sells. Gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide and on Gemini there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets, including many of the hot DFI tokens, and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid dye markets. Gemini just launched their earn program where you can earn up to 7.4% interest on 26 various crypto assets. If you're tired of paying fees in DFI or you don't want to worry about DFI exploits, but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets, Gemini Earn is the product for you.
00:23:11.142 - 00:24:00.502, Speaker B: Another product I'm stoked to get my hands on is the Gemini crypto back credit card, which gives you 3% cash back on all of your purchases, but paid to you in your preferred crypto asset. When I get my Gemini credit card, I'm going to make sure that I get my cash back in ETH, so whenever I buy something, I get a little bit of ETH bonus back to me. At the same time, you can open up a free account in under 3 minutes@gemini.com. GoBankless and if you trade more than $100 within the first 30 days after sign up, you'll be gifted a free $15 bitcoin bonus. Check them out@gemini.com. Gobankless the Ave protocol is a decentralized liquidity protocol on Ethereum, which allows users to supply and borrow certain crypto assets. Ave version two has a ton of cool features that makes using the Ave protocol even more powerful.
00:24:00.502 - 00:24:52.390, Speaker B: With Ave, you can leverage the full power of DFI money, legos, yield and composability all in one application. On Ave, there are a ton of assets that you can supply to the protocol in order to gain yield, and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol. If you have supplied collateral here, you can see me borrowing 200 USDC against my portfolio of a number of different DFI tokens. In ETH, I'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option, but I could choose the stable interest rate option if I wanted to lock in that interest rate in permanently. V two also features the ability for users to swap collateral without having to withdraw their assets, trade them on Uniswap, and then deposit them back into Ave. With Ave, users can do this in one seamless transaction, saving you time and gas costs. Check out the power of ave@ave.com.
00:24:52.390 - 00:24:54.630, Speaker B: That's aave.com.
00:24:54.700 - 00:25:03.646, Speaker A: All right, guys, we are back talking about releases today. David, let's start here. The ENS airdrop. This is the big one. Big airdrop. Maybe airdrop of the year. I don't know if that's too much.
00:25:03.668 - 00:25:04.878, Speaker B: But it feels that way.
00:25:05.044 - 00:25:34.662, Speaker A: So, yeah, because of how many people actually receive this for one. But also the market cap of this thing has been absolutely extraordinary. We had the ENS guys on earlier this week. So take a listen to that podcast and take a look at that show if you want all of the details. But what happened here, David? This is, by the way, our alpha alert. So anytime a really cool thing happens like this, an airdrop or something else, we send it out to bankless premium members so they get notified. But what was this airdrop? What happened this week?
00:25:34.716 - 00:26:15.694, Speaker B: Yeah, so this has been a long time coming, and no one really knew that the ENS team was going to do an airdrop. But if you had been paying attention to Ens, you would understand that the mission and culture and values of ENS was to eventually have this thing managed by the community. And so I remember talking to Brantley Milligan forever ago when ENS was really getting bootstrapped and talking about like, oh, so Ens sells domains in eTh, but ENS does not want to be a company. ENS wants to be a public utility. And the reason why they have to sell domains is because of an anti Sibyl mechanism. If you don't actually have to pay money for these things, somebody will just claim all of them. So they were selling EnS names, generating a treasury.
00:26:15.694 - 00:26:59.490, Speaker B: And now this protocol, the namespace of Ethereum, is now this public good. And that specifically should not be managed by two people or team of people, but instead should be managed by the broader community of people that are stakeholders. And so this is just the perfect marriage between what we've all been talking about with dows and tokens and a public utility on Ethereum. So if you have an ENS name, that happened before the snapshot, and the snapshot wasn't too long ago, just a couple of weeks ago, you can go claim your EnS tokens. There's 100 million tokens. They're currently trading for about $60. The average airdrop recipient got between like maybe 100 to 300 tokens or so, which is a pretty healthy amount.
00:26:59.490 - 00:27:34.062, Speaker B: And there's a few formulas with how your token amount was calculated. The longer that you've had your Ens name, the more tokens you get. The longer you've renewed it for, the more tokens you get. If you've actually registered your Ens name to an actual Ethereum address, you get even double that. All that information is in the state of the nation that we did with the ENS team. But this is really foundational. Ryan and I actually think that this is even more foundational than Uniswap because ENS is something deeper and closer and more related to Ethereum, the protocol itself, than uniswap is.
00:27:34.062 - 00:28:03.654, Speaker B: They're both in the app layer. But ENS is really about the namespace of Ethereum. So I think that a lot of people wanted to compare ENs to something like Godaddy, where you can register websites. It's even bigger than that. It's ENS is actually comparison to DNS where like the dot coms of the world. And that is DNS is another global public good that has to be managed by this private company. Instead, ENS is now being managed by the people that are using it.
00:28:03.654 - 00:28:12.620, Speaker B: And so the ENS Dao is now being handed over to everyone that has a ETH address. So we are all now managers of this open public good system.
00:28:12.990 - 00:28:50.114, Speaker A: Yeah. So like something like GoDaddy is just an app on top of DNS, right? It's not DNS itself reminding folks what this ETH address is. It's basically just a human readable name for your Ethereum address and recall an Ethereum address, okay? One model of that is as a bank account. That's what we talk about so often. It's just like your self sovereign bank account, but more than a wallet, more than a bank account, more than a vault, it's also your self sovereign identity. And it's becoming more like a passport every single day. So we talked with Brantley and Nick about the ability to sign on with Ethereum.
00:28:50.114 - 00:29:34.594, Speaker A: I think these addresses are going to become increasingly important to individual identity in this whole web3 world, right? So you're storing your nfts, you're storing your tokens inside of your ETH address. If I want to send some ETH to you, David, or some tokens to you in an NFT to you, it's very easy. I know you have Davidhoffman eth. I could just do that very easily rather than this public key with all of these characters. So very cool. Know one thing that blew my mind though, is the price on this. So like, I know know you, Nick and Brantley weren't the ones to talk price, but let's you and I talk price here for a second because this really surprised me.
00:29:34.594 - 00:29:55.114, Speaker A: All right, so here's the market cap of this thing. And this is not fully diluted market cap. This is just like, I guess, market cap that is unlocked up in supply. But here we are on coin market cap, and we hit $1.3 billion. Some highs of probably over $7 billion in fully diluted market cap.
00:29:55.152 - 00:29:58.762, Speaker B: For this, I think the peak was $8 billion. Yeah. It peaked out at $8. Yeah.
00:29:58.816 - 00:30:21.570, Speaker A: Why do you understand, why is this thing valuable to people? Right. So if you sign the constitution to get your drop, which I did, it's kind of a nonprofit. Right. You have governance rights in this thing. You've been given a responsibility. Why do you think people are valuing it at six, seven, $8 billion?
00:30:21.720 - 00:31:03.418, Speaker B: I definitely want to answer that question, but I want to answer that question at the very end, because it'll be easier to explain that. And so some of the dynamics, just to fill listeners in about what happened here, is like the ENS token got airdropped. Then there was a bunch of shenanigans with the Uniswap contract, because everyone who didn't have Ens wanted to buy it, but there were zero liquidity at the very start. And so if you were watching the uniswap, it would go like, for a moment, Ens. One Ens token was worth $577,000. And so for a brief moment in time, everyone was, like, a billionaire just by this weird proximate of there being, like, no liquidity in uniswap. Eventually, liquidity came in, the market settled, and that's where we started to see some actual price discovery.
00:31:03.418 - 00:31:36.410, Speaker B: Started around $20 to $30, which is, again, a two to $3 billion valuation. And then it zoomed up to $80 per token, and now is currently clocking in at just below $60 a token. But some really astonishing. Imagine just like, releasing your thing, and it had no valuation. ENS had no public valuation. It was managed by Brantley, by Nick, these guys that were just eight people, just stewards of this thing, not taking profit and not doing this for revenue, just managing this open protocol. And then boom, the token launches, and it comes out clocking in at a max of $8 billion.
00:31:36.410 - 00:32:01.070, Speaker B: That's absolutely insane. And so to unpack what this thing actually is, what EnS actually is. ENS is a public good. It is a public good for Ethereum, the namespace of Ethereum. If you could go back one tweet, Ryan to my tweet, the namespace of Ethereum is a public good. What do we call all of us? Because there's Ryan here, and then there's also Ryan Selkus. We can't have two Ryan's.
00:32:01.070 - 00:32:07.010, Speaker B: One of them's gotta be Ryan s Adams, and one of them's gotta be Ryan S. Selkis, right? Like we need two.
00:32:07.080 - 00:32:09.186, Speaker A: Hear that, Ryan Selkis? There can't be two of us.
00:32:09.208 - 00:32:09.854, Speaker B: Can't be two of us.
00:32:09.912 - 00:32:10.354, Speaker A: Sorry, budy.
00:32:10.402 - 00:32:11.026, Speaker B: Two different names.
00:32:11.058 - 00:32:11.942, Speaker A: One of us is going down.
00:32:11.996 - 00:32:42.558, Speaker B: You can't have conflicting names because we need to actually .2 things, only one entity per. And so that is called what is called a namespace, where we label all of the entities that exist in Ethereum. And with the Ethereum name system, we actually get to put in human readable names around these very complicated public addresses. And so the ENS is a public namespace around Ethereum, the system for collectively deciding how we name things. And this actually lends itself to how blockchains work. ENS is a consensus system.
00:32:42.558 - 00:33:03.794, Speaker B: It's a consensus for all identifying how we name all the things. Just like how a blockchain comes to consensus. ENS is a public goods that comes to consensus about how we name all the things. So just like Ethereum itself, ENS is a public good that needs to be protected from free riders. And this is the magic of Ethereum. This is why this gets me so excited. Ethereum as a protocol, like you said, a network of networks.
00:33:03.794 - 00:33:43.906, Speaker B: Ethereum as a protocol is finally able to price in public goods in ways that we've never seen before. So, like clean water, clean air, the free market doesn't do a very good job of pricing in those free resources. ENS is a resource, a system that is now establishing a market value, which is somewhere between four and $8 billion right now. And just how, like, proof of stake and proof of work is the protection around blockchains. The value of the ENS token is the protection around the Ethereum name system. And so Ethereum is unlocking the free market to actually finally price a public utility. And so, Brian, to answer your question about why this is so valuable, it's because we don't know how valuable this thing is.
00:33:43.906 - 00:34:02.886, Speaker B: We have never been able to price public goods. Like, like the bullish side of that is like, oh my God, we don't know how to price these things. The last thing I learned that we didn't know how to price was ether. And the sky's the limit on that one. The bear case is that these are public goods. It's actually really hard to monetize public goods. That's actually why they're called public goods.
00:34:02.886 - 00:34:22.160, Speaker B: So maybe they're not worth that much. This is going to be a grand experiment about finally pricing in some public goods for the first time ever. And I think the price action is really going to be emblematic of how well Ethereum can finally price these things that have always been left out of the market and ultimately cause a lot of human suffering. But that's a topic for a different day.
00:34:22.770 - 00:34:52.258, Speaker A: Yeah, you had a lot to say about that. There's a lot there. I mean, one point that Brantley makes is this, you were not dropped airdropped free money. You were airdropped responsibility. That's another way to look at it. I think the ultimate question of what you're saying is, like, the question of how to price a public good, whether right now $6 billion is overpriced or whether $6 billion is underpriced, is ultimately decided by individuals who own ens tokens. All right.
00:34:52.258 - 00:35:34.178, Speaker A: And so you tweeted this out. Raise your hand if you're holding your ens drop. I choose to bear this responsibility. So the question to everyone who just received this, of which there are like 150,000 more, or about 150,000 or so eth addresses that were eligible to receive this is what you going to do? It's worth $6 billion. You probably made thousands of dollars on this. I know people who've made tens of thousands of dollars easily on this airdrop. So what are you going to do? You're going to sell it? Are you going to hold? And if you're going to hold, are you going to bear the responsibility of voting? But it's awfully tempting to sell at these prices, is it not? And so what are people doing? They're not selling.
00:35:34.178 - 00:35:56.302, Speaker A: That's why prices going up. A lot of people have decided that it's worth holding on to. This thing could be more valuable in the future. They want to participate in this network at any cost. And so they're not selling. But I've actually been pretty surprised at where supply and demand have kind of met with the valuation of this thing. And to your point, nobody knows how to price it.
00:35:56.302 - 00:36:13.694, Speaker A: But I feel like some things in crypto are definitely overpriced. Right. Just honestly, I don't know whether EnS is overpriced or underpriced. It's a legitimate project. This is not smoke and mirrors. This could be insanely valuable. Team is fantastic.
00:36:13.694 - 00:36:32.262, Speaker A: The distribution seems to be, and they distribute it to a whole bunch of eTH bulls who have done well on ETh. And so they're going to be some of the last people to sell. But is it worth $6 billion? I legitimately don't know. So let me ask you the question did you sell or did you hold David?
00:36:32.406 - 00:36:41.580, Speaker B: So my two ens names that I have, trustlessate east and David Hoffman Eth, those private keys are in Seattle. So I am.
00:36:44.210 - 00:36:45.374, Speaker A: Hypothetical. Yeah.
00:36:45.412 - 00:37:23.660, Speaker B: But I have actually bought some in addition to that as well. And so I've actually doubled what my airdrop is worth by buying some. And I think I'm going to be holding that for a good long while. And it's also really something that's really, if you're paying attention to the crypto Twitter sphere, something that's also emerges. There's a big culture around ens right now, and I think it's just this very emergent property of everyone being really excited about ens. So, like, these memes are coming out in the same vein that we saw memes about, like, chainlink and all these other memes. There's a holding culture around ens right now, which is pretty damn cool.
00:37:23.660 - 00:37:28.070, Speaker B: We are going to have two moments of Zen at the end of this podcast.
00:37:28.150 - 00:37:28.602, Speaker A: So good.
00:37:28.656 - 00:37:38.702, Speaker B: And they are absolutely phenomenal. There are two songs about ens and ens dao. They are actually catchy. And I hope you guys stay tuned to the very end so you guys can listen to that.
00:37:38.756 - 00:37:43.118, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. How can you not? Ens stands for everyone not selling, I guess. Right? That's the meme here.
00:37:43.204 - 00:37:44.820, Speaker B: Can I get you in on a little bit more?
00:37:46.870 - 00:37:49.150, Speaker A: Going to. You're going to crank me up on more ens?
00:37:49.230 - 00:37:50.094, Speaker B: More ens hopium.
00:37:50.142 - 00:38:05.314, Speaker A: Okay, convince me. So I have claimed now, David, part of me thinks that this is a bit overvalued, my friend. I love ens as a project. It's fantastic. I'm incredibly bullish, but why should I hold at these prices?
00:38:05.442 - 00:38:15.482, Speaker B: How many funds do you think have purchased or invested in in ENS? VC funds? Zero. Zero funds? Zero hedge funds. It's all people.
00:38:15.536 - 00:38:16.922, Speaker A: No one's going to dump on me.
00:38:17.056 - 00:38:32.654, Speaker B: There's no one to dump on you. It's all people. All the way down. The only people that got the ENS tokens were people that were using the ENS system or were part of the ENS team, which was know building the ENS system. So, yeah, there's no one to dump on you.
00:38:32.772 - 00:38:33.550, Speaker A: Except my friends.
00:38:33.620 - 00:38:42.802, Speaker B: Except your friends. Except your friends. Right. And so, like this, friends don't dump on each other. We can pump this thing to the moon if we all agree to not sell. This is how this works.
00:38:42.936 - 00:39:17.278, Speaker A: I think it's a great project. And look, guys, this is just another reminder to you of the value of using these protocols. We've been saying this for the past, like, two and a half years, okay? Use these protocols. We're not just saying you'll be rewarded, as in, you'll learn a new skill and there'll be some educational rewards, and it'll enrich your life. No, you get free money. Why are you not using these protocols? Okay, when we say you're getting rewarded, you're literally getting airdropped money. Okay? Tokens value responsibility as well, but these things have value.
00:39:17.278 - 00:39:39.334, Speaker A: So we published an airdrop guide about two and a half weeks ago. Now, it had 25 different opportunities. This was number 16, guys. So that went to bankless premium members. That's another reason you should subscribe. I feel like we're shilling the bankless premium, but, like, look, what's the ROI on that? You spend $22 a week, and you get a few thousand dollars a month. Yeah, sorry.
00:39:39.334 - 00:39:42.280, Speaker A: A week. It would still be worth it, though.
00:39:42.970 - 00:40:01.286, Speaker B: I did see a fantastic. I think we put a meme on the weekly roll up a number of, like, a month or two ago about somebody's daughter wearing one of the crypto the cipher punk t shirts in middle school. That person's daughter got the ENS drop. No, a middle schooler got a $20,000 EnS drop.
00:40:01.398 - 00:40:03.914, Speaker A: Changed her life. Andrew Yang just got it.
00:40:03.952 - 00:40:05.066, Speaker B: Andrew Yang got it.
00:40:05.168 - 00:40:05.738, Speaker A: You're welcome.
00:40:05.824 - 00:40:06.810, Speaker B: Andrew Yang.
00:40:07.890 - 00:40:24.946, Speaker A: We got to go help Andrew Yang claim his airdrop. We should put it in his address and see how much he got, actually. But anyway, guys, airdrop season, really fun. I think this is the airdrop of the year. There's some great ones this year, DyDX, but I don't know. This is really fun from the distribution perspective. David, we got to burn through these, man.
00:40:24.946 - 00:40:32.822, Speaker A: We spent a lot of time on that. But let's talk about this new podcast launch. We teased it in the intro. Overpriced jpegs. What is happening here?
00:40:32.876 - 00:40:34.674, Speaker B: Oh, Ryan, this isn't you. This is Carly.
00:40:34.722 - 00:40:36.440, Speaker A: No, this is not me. This is somebody.
00:40:37.130 - 00:40:38.082, Speaker B: Yeah. Newest.
00:40:38.146 - 00:40:40.762, Speaker A: You guys don't want to hear another podcast with me in it.
00:40:40.816 - 00:41:03.978, Speaker B: Dear Lord, those probably do. Overpriced jpegs with Carly Riley exploring the world of NFTs and the metaverse. We've always wanted an NFT podcast. Carly Reilly is the person to do it. Ryan met Carly Riley while he was on the Yang Speaks podcast. Carly Reilly is the former finance manager for the Andrew Yang campaign. Sorry, Andrew Yang, for stealing your finance manager.
00:41:03.978 - 00:41:27.426, Speaker B: But she's great. And, yeah, so now she's starting her own podcast, part of the Bankless network. And so there are links in the show, notes to go subscribe to overpriced jpegs. It's going to be on a different RSS feed than the Bankless podcast, so you need to go subscribe to that. It is going to come out on the bankless YouTube. So we're going to share the youtubes, but Carly gets her own RSS feed, and I'm really, really stoked for this. Carly is a fantastic content producer.
00:41:27.426 - 00:41:31.914, Speaker B: She's a great speaker. She's a ton of fun. And, yeah, I'm really, really excited for this.
00:41:32.032 - 00:41:57.386, Speaker A: She's articulate, she knows her stuff. Yeah. I couldn't be more excited about the talent we're bringing in here. And think of this as, like, the sister companion to bankless. If bankless is, we definitely talk about the Metaverse and NFTs, but the show is also called bankless. So, you know, we're going to be coming back to defi and crypto money systems or these things. This is the sister that talks about NFTs in the metaverse all the time, right? You need this in your life.
00:41:57.386 - 00:42:10.882, Speaker A: Two episodes a week, one with a weekly recap, the other with interviews. You need this in your life. So go hit subscribe if you like bankless. You're going to love this. All right, David, more releases. Across protocol is live. This is like a hop.
00:42:10.882 - 00:42:23.514, Speaker A: This is like a connects. This is a bridge. But they're doing something different. You could be a co founder. Apparently, you join their discord. You could be a co founder. They've, like, created a dow from inception in this thing.
00:42:23.514 - 00:42:24.346, Speaker A: What's going on?
00:42:24.448 - 00:42:47.454, Speaker B: Yeah, across protocol, and one of the many, many protocols for bridging money across L2. And so that's not everyone. I think by now people understand this. We got hot protocol, we got connects. There's also mover. Now there's a cross just illustrating you how vibrant this market is going to be. There's going to be a lot of value to be won by whoever can win through in their market, in their network effects to be the cross chain protocol.
00:42:47.454 - 00:43:13.914, Speaker B: This one has this very interesting strategy of what they are calling a fair launch. Fair launches are no longer fair. They've kind of been, like, played out and gamified, but they're trying to do a brand new experiment. And I think this experiment by itself is going to be fun to launch, where they are going to mint a dow token, and then as a community, they're just going to manually figure out how to give it to. Right. And so the community is going to determine the distribution. Right.
00:43:13.914 - 00:43:45.986, Speaker B: So not one person. This isn't top down. This isn't a retroactive airdrop which is getting farmed. This is going to be a very interesting experiment to see. Can we just mint a bunch of tokens and then collectively agree as to who to give them to? And I think that's it's humans all the way down. Right. And so the human choices of this dow as to how they're giving out the tokens and if they can make sure that they do it correctly and not get corrupted along the way is going to be extremely bullish just for not only across, but the concept of token distribution in general.
00:43:45.986 - 00:43:55.298, Speaker B: It kind of throws it into the face, like retroactive airdrops. Meh. Yield farming. Meh. Let's just pick and choose. Let's just put in the labor to pick and choose who gets the token.
00:43:55.474 - 00:44:15.290, Speaker A: Yeah. And what I've seen with something like this, it's going to be like meritocracy. It's like that word gets used a lot and it gets abused a lot. Right. And it's like our company is a meritocracy. It's probably not really a meritocracy. This is going to be much more like a meritocracy because I've seen these dows in the early stages.
00:44:15.290 - 00:44:36.142, Speaker A: How they work is basically, you join a discord, you're a co founder. I joined the discord. I'm a co founder. I don't have time to figure out everything the Dow needs. I don't. I'm like, involved in other dows, but I'll be kind of a small time co founder, I guess. But if you want to figure out exactly what the Dow needs, take a leadership role, start contributing.
00:44:36.142 - 00:44:53.094, Speaker A: Start actively doing things for the DaO. You can quickly rise up the ranks and you'll get rewarded on the other side. This is like the create your own job path. And people would be surprised at how many of these opportunities now exist in crypto. And it's pretty unique. It's unique. Like, you don't find this in the regular economy.
00:44:53.094 - 00:45:08.990, Speaker A: I'm going to join a discord. I'm going to figure out what's needed, and I'm going to create my own job. Based on what? It's a form of network entrepreneurship. Right. You join a network, you be an entrepreneur in that network, and you create your own job. That's what's happening in these dows. And I think that's what across is doing.
00:45:09.060 - 00:45:30.614, Speaker B: I've always thought that the most bullish dows are the ones that figure out how to collapse the cost of contribution down to the absolute minimum. So anything can be contributed and a part of that is the incentive. And when you're very limited contribution of like, oh, guys, I made a meme and you actually get some tokens out of that. That's interesting. So, fantastic experiment. Let's see how this plays out.
00:45:30.732 - 00:45:51.594, Speaker A: Absolutely. Okay. Coinbase. Brian Armstrong said that they would be the DeFi exchange we were hoping for. They just released the Coinbase wallet as a standalone browser extension. So you know how you have metamask in your desktop browser? Well, now you can also have Coinbase wallet. I haven't tried this yet, but I need to.
00:45:51.594 - 00:45:57.322, Speaker A: And it's good to see Metamask having some competition in this space. What are your thoughts, David?
00:45:57.386 - 00:46:23.538, Speaker B: Yeah, that's exactly right. Like, more competition the better. Metamask gets an unfair amount of flak for basically supporting entire ecosystems worth of support. Request tickets for things that are just outside of their control. And so they're the front lines. There's been a ton of hate on Metamask lately and it's totally unjustified. They are spreading the mission and it's just like unfortunate that the entire crypto web3 funnel funnels down onto metamask.
00:46:23.538 - 00:46:41.130, Speaker B: But congratulations to Coinbase. This is your guys'win. We want more browsers extensions. I said at the beginning of this week that I think Coinbase is turning a page. I think they have kind of figured their stick out and they are really going hard into this whole web world. And this is an example of that.
00:46:41.280 - 00:47:07.346, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, we went into the Brian Armstrong podcast and our mission was basically to say like, hey, it seems like Coinbase hasn't selected its strategy for what it's going to do in DeFi, right, with smart contracts and all of this. What is your strategy? Right. And I think Brian said, I'm going to double down on open, credibly neutral protocols, and this is an example of that. So hopefully these words are followed up with actions. We're starting to see them. Rocket pool.
00:47:07.458 - 00:47:10.566, Speaker B: Speaking of open, credibly neutral protocols, so.
00:47:10.588 - 00:47:18.866, Speaker A: Tell us about rocket pool. Staking your eth in rocket pool. What just launched and what's still unavailable to you, David?
00:47:18.898 - 00:47:51.630, Speaker B: Yeah, rocket pool mainnet has launched. So rocket pool is a decentralized staking as a service protocol. So if you want to stake your ether, but you don't want to run a node, but you also don't want to trust anyone to run a node. Rocket pool is a protocol for running nodes in a trustless fashion. And so it's a home away from home. With regards to staking your ETH, it has been a long time coming for rocket pool to get launched. They are finally live in a very limited capacity, kind of in the same way that, like, arbitrum and optimism have spun out their l two s in a very constrained fashion.
00:47:51.630 - 00:48:18.890, Speaker B: Rocket pool has started its main net in a constrained fashion. They've actually already hit their limit, but the limit is going to be expanded and expanded and expanded over time. And so the rocket pool is going to be, I think, a very favorable place to stake your ether. Rocket pool has captured my love from a very beginning, from very early days in ethereum. They've been around since 2017 just building. And the cool thing about rocket pool is they have not cut any corners. They have stayed decentralized through and through.
00:48:18.890 - 00:48:44.098, Speaker B: So there's no multisig, there's no anything. And that strategy has, while it's very honorable, has actually cost them in adoption. But now that they are here, now that they are alive, they are out the gate, and I'm really excited to see what rocket pool can do. So congratulations to the entire rocket pool team and the entire rocket pool community that is stuck with rocket pool, I think because of the values that rocket pool has upheld. So, really a nice day.
00:48:44.184 - 00:48:51.762, Speaker A: Yes, you can't stake your eth with rocket pool right now, but as David said, they're going to be expanding soon, so they're at their limit.
00:48:51.826 - 00:48:52.502, Speaker B: You could have.
00:48:52.556 - 00:48:52.774, Speaker A: Right.
00:48:52.812 - 00:48:53.878, Speaker B: But it got filled up.
00:48:54.044 - 00:49:22.286, Speaker A: It got filled up in the first 45 seconds as well, and it was only like 150 ETH. But they're going to like every single phase. I think maybe on a weekly basis they're going to increase capacity, and they're just doing this to have a measured, phased launch. So this will be available to everyone pretty soon. Speaking of being available to everyone pretty soon, David Airdrop season airdrop. Okay, this is Joe Lubin responding to something on Twitter, a little bit of.
00:49:22.308 - 00:49:24.034, Speaker B: Drama, but it's kind of aside from the.
00:49:24.152 - 00:49:47.090, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So aside from the story, the main point is he's hypothetically asking the question, are we driving towards decentralization? We are driving towards decentralization of several of our projects. Joe Lubin says, when mask, question mark. That's the metamask token, by the way. Stay tuned. And then he says something snarky. But that's the main thing is like when mask.
00:49:47.090 - 00:50:06.366, Speaker A: Stay tuned. So this is a little tease. Metamask with an is like, this is like the industry's best kept secret. Like it's going to happen. Guys, what do you do to get this airdrop? All right, you use Metamask specifically use swaps, not financial advice. We don't know for sure. We have no insider information.
00:50:06.366 - 00:50:12.782, Speaker A: This could also not happen, but like, it could be true.
00:50:12.836 - 00:50:39.106, Speaker B: The leader of consensus, which owns Metamask goes when dollar sign mask. Stay tuned. There was also another clip of the metamask, I think, community call answering this question. When token. They said, we have no plans for a token, but we are actively investigating the best ways to engineer a token and also distribute it. There's probably going to be a token. I used to think that it was just totally going to be off of the swaps because that's the only verifiable way that metamask.
00:50:39.138 - 00:50:40.470, Speaker A: You don't think that anymore.
00:50:42.670 - 00:51:08.126, Speaker B: It can be a component. It's definitely probably a component about it. There's other ways too, as well. But that involves going into infura, where metamask routes its orders, and then collecting the addresses that have used infura to airdrop tokens there. I think that distributions, it's a very hard problem just by the nature of what metamask is. Metamask doesn't actually know what ethereum addresses are in it or not. And so that's why the swap feature is the only verifiable way to airdrop a metamask token.
00:51:08.126 - 00:51:17.350, Speaker B: I think they're trying to spin up some sort of alternative distribution plan, because I think that the distribution for metamask is going to be really hard, but we're going to see how that goes.
00:51:17.500 - 00:51:27.480, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. And again, just saying, the ultimate guide to airdrops, I'm sure this was listed in it. Metamask. Let's see, that was number.
00:51:29.530 - 00:51:31.502, Speaker B: It's in there. It's in there somewhere.
00:51:31.666 - 00:51:47.710, Speaker A: It's in there somewhere. Yeah. Oh, it's an honorable mention. Okay, so you're not just getting 25, you're getting like 35, 40 or so airdrops in the ultimate guide to airdrop, which was published by bankless. Bankless premium. You do that, you get that. All right, let's talk about this.
00:51:47.710 - 00:51:50.702, Speaker A: What is Dai? Wormhole David is another release for the week.
00:51:50.756 - 00:52:18.082, Speaker B: This is really, really cool. This is about the L2 ecosystem. And this is maker Dow with one of the coolest innovations, I think, of one of the coolest innovations of the year. And so what this means is Dai can now be minted on any of the l two s arbitrum starknet fuel all these L2 s. And this is not Dai being minted on the layer one and being sent to the l two via a cross chain connect or hop protocol.
00:52:18.146 - 00:52:20.706, Speaker A: You're actually minting it. You are through a wormhole.
00:52:20.818 - 00:52:49.162, Speaker B: You are wormhole minting die natively on the l two. And so it's coming out of the maker contracts out of l one, but being minted on l two. And so there are some crazy cryptographic consensus magic going on here. But this is exactly why Rune Christensen was talking about the differences between L2 roll ups and multi sig bridges. You could not have built a wormhole through a multi sig bridge. You can only build a wormhole through a roll up. We're just making up this wild.
00:52:49.162 - 00:52:52.258, Speaker B: A wormhole is not a technical term, by the way. We are just making this up because.
00:52:52.264 - 00:52:57.502, Speaker A: That'S a great metaphor, but I'm getting the visual. Yeah. And is this available now, or is this coming soon?
00:52:57.576 - 00:53:18.294, Speaker B: I think so. Maybe. I think maybe the contracts are live. Maybe the UI is not quite there yet, but, yeah, this is a fascinating development where you can just birth an asset anywhere around the L2 ecosystem without having to use hop, without having to use connect. Not that using those things are bad, but it's just like, efficiency begets efficiency.
00:53:18.422 - 00:53:23.034, Speaker A: I'm just paying L2 gas fees. I'm not paying main net gas fees. Right? Yes. Right. Wow. Yeah.
00:53:23.072 - 00:53:29.386, Speaker B: Mint wild. Minting die on l one would cost over $100 to $200. Minting dye on l two costs $0.10.
00:53:29.498 - 00:53:42.142, Speaker A: Man, I need to read more about this, actually. This was the first time seeing this. Let's talk about this. Rebrand for Uniswap. They're rebranding, potentially. This is a governance vote. Still the unicorn.
00:53:42.142 - 00:53:48.514, Speaker A: This looks like a medieval unicorn. Something you put on like a night shield, like a suit of arms. What's going on here?
00:53:48.552 - 00:53:52.646, Speaker B: Okay, Ryan, let's play a game here. On the count of three, thumbs up or thumbs down? It was whether you like it.
00:53:52.668 - 00:53:53.350, Speaker A: Ready? Okay.
00:53:53.420 - 00:53:56.790, Speaker B: Three, two, one, down.
00:53:56.860 - 00:53:59.974, Speaker A: Wait, I can't see. You gotta put the camera. Yeah, I like.
00:54:00.012 - 00:54:03.670, Speaker B: That was thumbs down from Ryan, thumbs up from David.
00:54:03.750 - 00:54:14.714, Speaker A: Yeah. So people can see that. I like number four, actually, because that preserves some of the simplicity that I love. But, like. Yeah. One, two, three. Just a bit too complicated for me.
00:54:14.714 - 00:54:16.234, Speaker A: It doesn't have a little bit of a mess.
00:54:16.272 - 00:54:17.630, Speaker B: Twos a little bit of a mess. Yeah.
00:54:17.700 - 00:54:23.890, Speaker A: It doesn't have, like, the apple esque simplicity. Can I draw it in the sand? That means it's a good logo.
00:54:24.630 - 00:54:25.394, Speaker B: That's a good take.
00:54:25.432 - 00:54:34.738, Speaker A: It's a little too much for me, but I like, would, you know, put this on my shield, maybe that shield that you have.
00:54:34.824 - 00:54:54.570, Speaker B: I like pulling forward the medieval era of Europe into defi. It's just like such a juxtaposition that it's so crazy that it kind of works. This is actually not official. So this is actually going up for governance vote. So if you are a uni token holder and you want to participate in, say, yay or nay, you can say yay or nay on this. So, yeah, uniswap getting a rebrand question mark.
00:54:54.720 - 00:55:04.154, Speaker A: Yeah. You know what? So this is the thing. I feel like we're post medieval era, David. I feel like we're Renaissance. Is this right? Yeah. Okay. Old era web two is medieval.
00:55:04.154 - 00:55:09.360, Speaker A: All right? We are Renaissance and then moving into the modern era. Whatever.
00:55:09.970 - 00:55:11.262, Speaker B: Josh, we need your help.
00:55:11.396 - 00:55:12.474, Speaker A: Josh Rosenthal.
00:55:12.602 - 00:55:15.140, Speaker B: Josh Rosenthal. What era are we in?
00:55:15.670 - 00:55:37.190, Speaker A: Raises. Okay. Matter labs. Matter labs just announced 50 million in new funding for ZK sync. Pretty excited about this because this is like a starkware esque ZK roll up. It's going to have the EVM general purpose smart contracts inside of a roll up. They released some sort of a testnet, I believe, a month or two ago.
00:55:37.190 - 00:55:42.982, Speaker A: I'm not sure when Maynet is coming, but it has to be soon. And they just raised another $50 million. Pretty impressive.
00:55:43.046 - 00:55:45.354, Speaker B: Congrats, matter labs. What's the valuation on this now?
00:55:45.392 - 00:55:48.422, Speaker A: After they raise 50 million above a billion?
00:55:48.486 - 00:55:49.674, Speaker B: Over a billion. I know that.
00:55:49.792 - 00:55:52.774, Speaker A: Yeah. I don't know all of the details of this race.
00:55:52.822 - 00:55:53.718, Speaker B: Layer two.
00:55:53.904 - 00:55:59.406, Speaker A: Layer twos are hot and they're raising and they're well funded and, yeah, they're coming. They're going to be here.
00:55:59.508 - 00:56:06.286, Speaker B: There were other raises this week, but that's the only one that we got. Yeah, that's the only one we're talking about. It's the best one.
00:56:06.308 - 00:56:06.926, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:56:07.108 - 00:56:07.722, Speaker A: Jobs.
00:56:07.786 - 00:56:08.058, Speaker B: Jobs.
00:56:08.074 - 00:56:08.954, Speaker A: That's the reminder, David.
00:56:09.002 - 00:56:16.998, Speaker B: Get a job. Why haven't you got a job in crypto yet? Your web two job is not as cool as a web3 job. If you're not even in web two, then it's definitely not school. Get a job.
00:56:17.164 - 00:56:37.114, Speaker A: Get a job in crypto. Okay? Either work for a dow or work for a protocol company or some sort of company in crypto. Okay. You're listening to bankless, so you obviously are already down the rabbit hole. Crypto is probably one of the top five things that you think about all the time, if not, like, the number one thing. So why not let it consume all of your waking hours?
00:56:37.232 - 00:56:42.186, Speaker B: Just let it happen. Just let it in. Just give up.
00:56:42.368 - 00:56:54.340, Speaker A: People have told me, David, that I say the word capitulate too often. I was just about to say the word capitulate. You should capitulate and get a job in crypto. Yes. Let's talk about these jobs. These are new this week.
00:56:54.790 - 00:56:56.402, Speaker B: Bitwise. Nice. All right.

Link in the show notes. Bankless palette xyzjjjjobs hit subscribe.
00:58:42.846 - 00:58:55.826, Speaker A: You get these via email and not only do you hear it from us weekly to get a job, you get an email alert saying, here are the jobs that you can get. That's what you need to do. Yes, man. You don't find job titles like this anywhere else. Crypto.
00:58:55.858 - 00:59:00.380, Speaker B: I'm bummed that we don't have a meme lord, but that's because all the meme Lord jobs get snapped up too damn fast.
00:59:01.550 - 00:59:15.262, Speaker A: That's right. We could use another meme lord, too. Maybe we'll post around David. All right, let's talk news of the week. All right, big news of the week. Let's start with discord. What are they doing, man? Discord is where I spend so much of my time.
00:59:15.262 - 00:59:23.742, Speaker A: It is the office for crypto. That's like going to the office and basically logging to a discord server. What did they tease this week?
00:59:23.796 - 00:59:44.018, Speaker B: Yeah, they teased an Ethereum integration. The CEO of Discord says probably nothing with an image of the discord icon. Plus Ethereum and then also has metamask and wallet connect right next to the connections page. So some sort of, like, address authentication address integration into discord being teased. Ryan?
00:59:44.114 - 00:59:48.470, Speaker A: They know what we want. They know what we do know what we want. They do know exactly what we want.
00:59:48.540 - 01:00:18.962, Speaker B: Sadly, there is a very sad part two of this story after, let's see, about a day later, the same CEO tweets out. Thank you for all the perspectives, everyone. We have no current plans to ship this internal concept. For now, we're focusing on protecting users from spam scams and fraud. Web three has a lots of good, but also lots of problems, and we need to work through at our scale more soon. So they teased this thing, and then they had to say, like, don't worry, guys, we're not actually doing this. So, yeah, what the hell happened? You wanted.
01:00:19.016 - 01:00:40.140, Speaker A: This is a two day period. This is, by the way, these are like tweets from the CEO, Jason Citron, who is the founder of Discord. Right. This is the guy who would be in the know. It almost feels like something happened within that 48 hours period of time to chill him on the concept or chill them on the concept. They get it like a call from a regulator. What do you think happened?
01:00:40.750 - 01:01:04.878, Speaker B: I think we know what happened is that he got absolutely mobbed by the anti crypto folk of the world. Right? No way. So here's Anthony Sazzle Zerox saying on a tweet, this is wild. There are literally hundreds of, quote, tweets like this. People quote, tweeting the Discord CEO. And he also says, imagine being this uninformed about something, but also still have such a strong opinion about it. So there are four tweets in here.
01:01:04.878 - 01:01:23.334, Speaker B: Okay, so somebody who's not in crypto Twitter says, so this is the Discord CEO teasing some sort of crypto integration. Make sure to let him know, discord, know how much you hate this, both on Twitter and here. Go there, make a thread, yell tell your friends to do the same thing. Nfts and crypto belong in the trash. That's just one. There's another one. Let's go on.
01:01:23.334 - 01:01:54.730, Speaker B: I don't like to use my platform for big statements often, but Discord recently had a work in progress blog post about a partnership with Axie, a community that exploits people in an MLM structure, indebting new users and making them share personal data. This is the antithesis of trust and safety. We could go on. So apparently, the discord. I am canceling my nitro subscription immediately and will be encouraging all my friends and followers to do the same. I will not support a platform that aligns itself with crypto and nfts, not to mention MLM schemes and sharing of personal data. Oof.
01:01:54.810 - 01:01:57.134, Speaker A: Rough. MLM is multilevel marketing.
01:01:57.262 - 01:02:15.190, Speaker B: Big oof. Big oof. The CEO of Discord informally teasing integration with Ethereum wallets. Ethereum misspelled isn't surprising. Discord is a home of number of NFT griffs masquerading as exciting projects, and it's in vogue about no nothing tech lords. But it's definitely a disappointing development. Damn, I want to swear.
01:02:15.190 - 01:02:34.202, Speaker B: I want to swear everyone f off. You don't know what you're talking about. It's so frustrating. And this goes back to the cognitive dissonance that people have about cryptos, like, oh, you didn't get rich on bitcoin? Well, you hate it because of the environment. Oh, you haven't made any money off nfts. That's because they're a scam. Oh, MLM schemes.
01:02:34.202 - 01:02:59.990, Speaker B: Guess what? The dollar is an MLM scheme. It's so frustrating. It's so frustrating. And the fact I understand as a CEO why he had to capitulate to this. Here's me saying capitulate, but damn, is it really frustrating, because that could do. Sign in with Ethereum, self authenticated, like, self sovereign identity, where you don't have to sell your data to Google or Yahoo or Facebook to sign in, is the exact opposite of what they're talking about.
01:03:00.140 - 01:03:27.946, Speaker A: David. Here's the thing, dude. It's just a login with metamask. If you don't like it, don't freaking use it. If you don't like it, don't use it. Why are you getting mad that somebody's building an integration to something like, look, the biggest discord server in the world is axie infinity, right? Don't you think those members of Discord, those users of discord, would like some integration with their metamask? Wallet. I asked this question because I saw some of this pushback.
01:03:27.946 - 01:04:00.310, Speaker A: I actually didn't read everything that you just put up, but this guy said, discord is pausing NFT plans after the huge backlash. Apparently some people in the gaming studio totally hate nfTs, and I was previously unaware of that. But you read some of the quote tweets. So I asked the question of one of the guys who was tweeting this, why do you hate it? And this is his response. Oh wow. Unable to view it. I may have just gotten blocked.
01:04:00.650 - 01:04:02.522, Speaker B: Open it up in a private browser then.
01:04:02.656 - 01:04:10.106, Speaker A: Okay, let me try to open it up in a private. You can open that? Okay, let me open it up. I didn't even respond to it anyway.
01:04:10.288 - 01:04:11.206, Speaker B: You did get blocked.
01:04:11.238 - 01:04:33.300, Speaker A: Wow. I got blocked by basically saying, okay, so just so people know, here's my response. Ryan tweeted this and he linked me to this thread and I said, I appreciate this reply. This is exactly what I was looking for. I'm not going to use this thread to push back against these points, but I hope you stay tuned into the NFT community to hear the arguments. Apparently I got blocked over that. Yeah.
01:04:33.300 - 01:05:09.870, Speaker A: Anyway, so it goes. But basically the thread, now that I can see it in incognito mode, nfts are harmful to games and the entire thread is basically a few points. One energy. Okay, so like the environmental issue, every NFT kills the environment, right? Which by the way, in six months the Ethereum merge. That'll no longer be an issue. Ethereum will reduce its energy expenditure by 99.9%. If you know anything about this, you've done any research, then you obviously know that nfts are not on bitcoin.
01:05:10.450 - 01:05:17.726, Speaker B: Also, individual nfts don't actually add more carbon to the air. It's just like theorem's ecosystem as a whole. It's not nfts.
01:05:17.838 - 01:05:48.474, Speaker A: Yes, exactly. That's another subtle point that seems to be missed. And then going through it, it's basically like play to earn is toxic to the gameplay mechanics, turns it into a multi level marketing type scheme. Right? And it's like my response there is, well, then just don't play those games. You're not losing anything from the existing games that you play. Like, you don't have to play an axe if you don't want to. And then they basically don't believe the premise of you control what you buy.
01:05:48.474 - 01:06:27.810, Speaker A: So they're like, you already control what you buy in a centralized database. And if the gaming company goes away, then the NFTs go away anyway. Right. So that's another point, not really understanding the difference between property rights and being able to port your NFT from game to game. Also, the one good point in this thread was basically a point that we've talked about before, which is like, what happens if all of the games turn into these grinds for money? What does that do to gameplay? Does that remove the fun? Right. So, like a whole massive thread of criticisms, maybe a few points, but mostly misinformation.
01:06:27.890 - 01:06:29.378, Speaker B: Big swing and a miss.
01:06:29.484 - 01:06:55.774, Speaker A: Like, big swing and a miss. So again, I don't understand why there's this disconnect. And I didn't even realize until this discord thing that some of the gaming industry actually hate crypto. Like, they hate nfts and they hate what we're doing here. I didn't realize any of this was the case, but I think there's a massive amount of misinformation out there and just lack of education on what crypto is actually trying to do. Any other thoughts here?
01:06:55.812 - 01:07:27.866, Speaker B: Yeah, the concern about what happens if these games just turn into a grind and they suck out all the life out of the game. You know what else is a grind? Working from below poverty wages in a country that doesn't have jobs to support you. That's also a grind, and that really sucks. And so gatekeeping is like, oh, I don't want to dilute the art of my industry to the point where you actually are revoking people's ability to make an income from themselves. They do not know that the reason why Axio infinity is so incredibly large is because it's supporting an entire country's gdp right now.
01:07:27.888 - 01:07:30.162, Speaker A: It got people through Covid in the Philippines.
01:07:30.246 - 01:07:49.762, Speaker B: Yeah, I understand that people have cognitive dissonance about accepting crypto. There's a lot to swallow. It really breaks people's brains. But also, you are doing so much harm by just jumping to conclusions that these things are harmful. It is extremely frustrating. I will stop there.
01:07:49.896 - 01:08:06.450, Speaker A: Yeah, it is extremely frustrating. But now we know this pushback exists, so we could talk about a little bit more. No pushback at Sotheby's, though. They are auctioning off as many nfts as they could. And this one is actually denominated in ETH, and it's for Banksy art. David, what's the significance?
01:08:06.530 - 01:08:21.946, Speaker B: Yeah, so if I'm getting the story correct, Banksy went up to Sotheby's and made a stipulation saying, hey, when you auction off my piece of art, you have to do it in ETH. And so there's going to be a live auction for a Banksy art piece. And this is, the auctioneer is going to be like, can I get 50 e?
01:08:21.968 - 01:08:22.314, Speaker A: 50 e?
01:08:22.352 - 01:08:38.722, Speaker B: 50 d. Can I get 60 e? 60 e, please? 60 e. Can I get 60 eth? 75 eth. That's crazy. Imagine how many non ethereum people, very rich art collectors, are going to be in that crowd hearing instead of. Yeah, with her calculators. That's exactly right.
01:08:38.722 - 01:08:58.726, Speaker B: Instead of hearing dollars hearing eth. And this goes back to the first time we had this NFT bubble where we started realizing that art is going to be priced in ETH. Well, part of that statement was because we thought all art was going to be digital. But now ether is moving into physical art, so physical art is starting to get priced in ETH. That's crazy.
01:08:58.908 - 01:09:26.350, Speaker A: It is crazy. And it's super cool. And yeah, it's unexpected that it's happening so quickly, is what I would say. Let's talk about this, though. Some bad news on the NFT side is like, the games are fun to play, the art is fun to collect, but the tax optimizer is here to ask, have you thought about your taxes this year? This was an article I read, David. NFT games are fun. Filing taxes afterward is a nightmare.
01:09:26.350 - 01:09:58.282, Speaker A: I'm not going to go through this whole article, but it's just kind of a PSA that the way the IRS and other nation states treat game items is as, like physical property. Okay? So if your axe breeds with another axe and you get a new axe, then you got a new asset. And if you swap that asset for another axe, it's an asset to asset trade, and there's a capital gain on that trade. And I bet none of you listening are tracking that stuff, right? No, gamers are okay.
01:09:58.336 - 01:09:59.226, Speaker B: Why would they?
01:09:59.328 - 01:10:34.774, Speaker A: But this is what the tax code says, right? And what I'm saying is as ludicrous as this sounds, right? One, you should be aware of it and conscious of it, because if you want to do the letter of the law with taxes, you have to record these transactions. But two, my God, how could we tax games in this way? How can we tax digital goods in this way? There's got to be a better system than recording every single time and reporting the IRS every single time. An okay. Like, we got to do better than this. David, do you have any answers for us?
01:10:34.892 - 01:10:50.938, Speaker B: No answers, but just more illustrations of how nonsensical this is. Imagine you're grinding against this boss. You kill this boss, it drops like a legendary sword, and you're like, shit, if I pick that up, that's a taxable event. I can't pick that up.
01:10:51.024 - 01:11:05.030, Speaker A: And when you pick that up, right, it's a tax event at that moment. And, oh, my God, that sword is worth $1,000. So now you have $1,000 in ordinary income. You have to file on your taxes. Terrible.
01:11:05.130 - 01:11:32.022, Speaker B: We already know that the way crypto works, it's just incongruent with a tax code. But previously, the Defi tokens and normal ether, it wasn't that bad. Where you can still do your taxes. Compiling stocks. Defi summer came along and started to really, really get hard mess. Once gaming is here, we have to rewrite the tax code or else you are getting none of it because gamers do not give a shit about their taxes.
01:11:32.086 - 01:11:47.840, Speaker A: Well, but listen, this. Imagine that exact same scenario I laid out, right? Boss drops an item. You go to pick up your sword, right? And it's a taxable event. And you're ten years old. You're a ten year old kid. Little Bobby. You don't even know what.
01:11:47.840 - 01:11:55.918, Speaker A: Sorry, Bobby. I hope you've reported that sword to the IRS. God, man.
01:11:56.084 - 01:12:02.734, Speaker B: Anyway, Bobby, you got to stop playing the games. Your parents can't afford the tax bill. It's Bobby's responsibility.
01:12:02.862 - 01:12:03.346, Speaker A: Sorry.
01:12:03.448 - 01:12:04.530, Speaker B: Damn, Bobby.
01:12:05.590 - 01:12:06.802, Speaker A: All right, let's talk about this.
01:12:06.856 - 01:12:07.582, Speaker B: Fun on this sometimes.
01:12:07.656 - 01:12:10.514, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, you know what? Taxes can be fun, right, David?
01:12:10.642 - 01:12:12.360, Speaker B: Joking about that, that's for sure.
01:12:13.370 - 01:12:33.566, Speaker A: Bitcoin news. The New York City mayor elect, Eric Adams is going to take his first paycheck, his first three paychecks, rather, in bitcoin. Wow. This is a flag in the ground. And he's saying, basically, I want New York City to be a crypto friendly city. Mayors around the country, around the US have done this. Right? Mayor of Miami, some other mayors as well.
01:12:33.566 - 01:13:00.994, Speaker A: And it's really cool that they're doing this. Vitalik had this blog post about crypto know, mayors and cities have a bit more ability to be flexible and experiment. And New York City is actually talking about launching a New York City coin. I wonder what they're going to do with this. But it's kind of interesting. Eric Adams says, we're glad to welcome you to the global home of web3. They're starting to see the jobs potential, the economic prosperity potential.
01:13:00.994 - 01:13:06.594, Speaker A: They're starting to make the connection between that and web3 and crypto. What's your take, David?
01:13:06.642 - 01:13:34.778, Speaker B: Yeah, this New York city coin, it's of the same category as like the Miami coin that happened not too long ago. This is built on this Dax side chain bridge thing off of bitcoin. I'm not sure that connection there, which is kind of weird because bitcoiners generally don't like tokens, especially not like city tokens. But if there's enough traction to justify another New York coin, absolutely. Let's do it. So, let's see what happens here. I still don't know what this whole citicoin thing is about, but I'm a fan of experiments.
01:13:34.874 - 01:13:46.002, Speaker A: I really don't know either. And mostly I'm a fan of politicians saying, hey, we want this jurisdiction to be friendly to crypto. All right, let's talk about there. I guess I have to consent something. Okay. Crypto firm Grayscale. This is big.
01:13:46.002 - 01:14:16.010, Speaker A: Crypto firm Grayscale just hit 60 billion in assets under management. What's interesting about this is this is now larger than the top gold ETF. And this is both incredible from a growth perspective, but what a tragedy. Okay. What a tragedy that we have not really an ETF, but a fund that has additional rent extraction, like one, 2%. I forget what the grayscale management fees are rather than an ETF. And it's grown as big as gold.
01:14:16.090 - 01:14:19.642, Speaker B: And it doesn't actually track bitcoin closely. Not perfectly.
01:14:19.706 - 01:14:33.774, Speaker A: Exactly. All right, so, like, the SEC is in action on etfs. I know we got a futures based ETF. We need a spot ETF. Just take this grayscale ETF and convert it to an ETF. Do the right thing, guys. We're bigger than gold.
01:14:33.774 - 01:14:45.846, Speaker A: You've waited four years too long for this. Four years too long. Retail could have had this already. Now you need to make up for lost time. Is the SEC listening? You think to this, David? You think they're going to do that?
01:14:45.868 - 01:14:49.442, Speaker B: Well, Hester Pierce is. Hey, Hester.
01:14:49.586 - 01:14:56.700, Speaker A: Hey, Hester. Yeah, we love your work. By the know. SEC's got to get moving on some things.
01:14:57.390 - 01:14:59.210, Speaker B: Gary, though, lukewarm on him.
01:14:59.280 - 01:15:18.194, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll see. Maybe we'll come on the podcast and persuade us. David. Jake Trevinsky. Okay. The infrastructure bill, you probably heard about this, had some really terrible language in the bill regarding tax reporting and crypto and all of these things. It passed, right? So it's passed in the house.
01:15:18.194 - 01:15:32.898, Speaker A: Looks like it's moving towards approval. Or was it approved? David, I didn't catch up on the news last week. Okay. I don't know either. But for crypto, this is not great. Crypto stood up and pushed it out. But here's, I think, the main takeaway.
01:15:32.898 - 01:15:39.378, Speaker A: There's nothing really we can do at this point in time. Okay, so how is this going to get resolved, do you think, David?
01:15:39.554 - 01:15:57.822, Speaker B: Well, if this does actually go into effects, like 75% of the infrastructure that makes this crypto industry work becomes illegal. And so at that point, we just go to the courts because it's not like we're going to stop doing this. And so I think we might have a destiny in court, which will be fun to watch.
01:15:57.956 - 01:16:35.820, Speaker A: Yes, and it doesn't take into effect until 2024, so keep that in mind. Also, there will be some legislative pushes from basically the crypto lobby, people listening to this to get this amendment, get this stripped from the bill. So there'll be that pushed. And then ultimately, if all of this fails, then we take it to the court system, so not the end of the world. I think crypto made a valiant stand against this, and I think we'll have some know steps up to bat to try to get this language out, but we got to remain vigilant. And I guess that's the story. There's nothing we can do at this point in time, but we will sound the alarm when there's more that we can do on this sort of thing.
01:16:35.820 - 01:17:00.034, Speaker A: Jerry Britto has a good comment on that, too. We'll include that in the show. Notes David. PayPal getting some revenue increases on their quarterly earnings. They plan to increase their crypto offerings. You know what's so cool here is corporations become addicted to quarterly earnings reports. Basically, they're always looking for the growth, right? That's what the street wants from them, investors want from them, their company wants from them.
01:17:00.034 - 01:17:12.534, Speaker A: And once they get on the crypto train and they start realizing some of that growth for crypto, they ain't coming back. They're going to do this more and more. They're going to double down on it, triple down on it. It seems like that's what's happening with PayPal and Venmo. Any thoughts here?
01:17:12.572 - 01:17:28.086, Speaker B: Yeah, Ryan here always says crypto pays you to learn about it. Well, all these companies, these financial services companies integrate with crypto, and they're like, oh, there's a lot more revenue here than I thought. Let's keep going. And so crypto pays companies to integrate with it, and this is how crypto wins.
01:17:28.198 - 01:17:32.362, Speaker A: It does, totally. David, let's do some quick takes here. What's this one? First one?
01:17:32.416 - 01:17:40.302, Speaker B: Tim Cook of Apple says he's bullish on crypto and that he owns some, so that's kind of cool. I kind of think that's the whole story, is that the whole story.
01:17:40.356 - 01:17:42.766, Speaker A: Yeah. What coins do you think he has?
01:17:42.868 - 01:17:44.394, Speaker B: Probably bitcoin and ether.
01:17:44.522 - 01:17:46.314, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. Probably got to start there.
01:17:46.372 - 01:17:47.374, Speaker B: Do you think he has doge?
01:17:47.422 - 01:17:48.738, Speaker A: Oh, God, I don't know.
01:17:48.824 - 01:17:50.338, Speaker B: I wouldn't bet against it.
01:17:50.424 - 01:17:51.410, Speaker A: What's this next one?
01:17:51.480 - 01:18:06.918, Speaker B: Matt Huang of paradigm is joining the board at stripe. Stripe, the massive, massive payments company that does a ton of volume. Matt Huang, a crypto native person coming on board there, he says, I'm excited to see them invest more energy into crypto and web3.
01:18:07.084 - 01:18:20.554, Speaker A: This is super cool. Basically, this is stripe saying, hey, we need a crypto native on the board and them getting a crypto native on the board because they're doing cool stuff in crypto. I think that's what's going on. David. What's going on with this Dave Dow, David Dow. Dave Dow.
01:18:20.602 - 01:18:48.946, Speaker B: Yeah, it's officially Dave Dow. We have the Dave token. It's on Polygon. There are, like, 250 daves in the Dave Dow discord. And so what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to corral everyone into the day who's named Dave or David or Davy or from what I've learned, if you're italian David, or if you are Arabic, dawed. Yeah. So all forms of David are welcome into Dave Dow.
01:18:48.946 - 01:19:00.690, Speaker B: We're trying to corral every single David that exists into the discord. There's over 250 of them. And this has actually generated Matt Dow and Dan Dow. Dan Dow is Dave's Dow arch enemy.
01:19:00.770 - 01:19:04.218, Speaker A: Is this just a fun experiment or what are you expecting to fall out of?
01:19:04.304 - 01:19:29.090, Speaker B: So, yeah, the cost of issuing a token, the costs of making a dao have collapsed so low that you can make a dow out of anything right now. And so I think this is a great model of when you strip away everything from a Dow and you just compact it down to just one single thing that people share. That is what this is. Right. So the bankless dow, that's a complex narrative. Like, we want bankless technologies, bankless culture. There's a lot of things there.
01:19:29.090 - 01:20:09.342, Speaker B: What happens if you have a Dow collapse down to just the bare minimum, which is, like, one thing that people share, and I want named Dows to get spun up all over the place. And so if you click that screenshot at the bottom, somebody says, finally, a place for Dave's can feel at home. And I quote him and say, this is unironically the point of this. And I say in quotes, hey, I want to get into crypto. Where should I go? And if there's a bunch of namedows everywhere. You can just say, well, what's your name? Just go to your namedao. And so we said Dave Dow is going to be maximally successful if we also get like Ryan Dow, Justin Dow, Sarah Dow, also to get started.
01:20:09.342 - 01:20:37.842, Speaker B: That should be our goal. Dave Dow, the crypto punks of Dave Daos, by the way, because we're the first ones. But yeah, I think this is a fun experiment. It's just the perfect level of meme and realness to matter. And the goal, we have decided the collective vision of Dave Dao is to buy the statue of David so we can own once it's not for sale. But the power of crypto will make it happen. We are going to own the statue of David and it'll be property of Dave Dow.
01:20:37.986 - 01:20:58.794, Speaker A: Wow, this is very strange and interesting. And you know, I don't have time to start a Ryan Dow, but I'd probably join one. So if there's some listener out there with the first name Ryan, then you've got some ideas that David has just dropped you. Let's talk about this too. Optimism. We were teasing it for the last couple of weeks. What did they just drop?
01:20:58.842 - 01:21:27.174, Speaker B: Yeah, by the time that people listen to this, the optimistic Ethereum, the EVM equivalent version of optimism, will be online. The network is going to go down in 24 hours from a little bit yesterday. So that's going to be coming up at the time of recording. By the time you guys listen to it, should already be backup line or maybe it's in that six hour window. But then, boom. Optimism is EVM equivalent, which I think is going to be an iterative process, but moving closer and closer and closer towards EVM equivalents. Such a beautiful thing.
01:21:27.174 - 01:21:29.750, Speaker B: Really excited for that. Congratulations to the optimism team.
01:21:29.900 - 01:22:00.318, Speaker A: Yeah, really cool, for sure. We also wrote a fantastic post this week about Ethereum's roadmap. A lot of people have questions about Ethereum's roadmap. So when is the merge? What's it going to include when the merge happens? Will I be able to withdraw my eth? What about sharding? What about scalability? When's that all happening? We wrote it up in the Ethereum roadmap update. Trent from the Ethereum foundation wrote that for us. So it's just a fantastic overview. We'll include a link to that in the show notes.
01:22:00.318 - 01:22:09.766, Speaker A: Guys, we will be right back with our takes of the week and also what we're excited about. But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
01:22:09.868 - 01:22:45.486, Speaker B: Bankless is proud to be supported by Uniswap. Uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure. Instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans, Uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on Ethereum, which is what Ryan and I call a money robot. No human counterparties or centralized intermediaries, just autonomous code on ethereum. Input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy. Something brand new in the Uniswap ecosystem is the Uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants. We have been saying this for a while, and we'll say it again.
01:22:45.486 - 01:23:13.562, Speaker B: Daos have money and they are in need of labor. If you think that you have something to contribute to the Uniswap Dow, apply for a grant to Uniswap. Just look at the size of the Uniswap treasury. It's almost $3 billion. This mountain of capital is looking for labor. Do you have something of value to contribute to the Uniswap? Dow no matter how big or small your idea is, you can apply for a unigrant@unigrant.org and help steer Uniswap in the direction that you think it should go.
01:23:13.562 - 01:24:02.902, Speaker B: That's exactly what we did to get Uniswap to be a sponsor for bankless, and you can do the same for your project. Thank you, Uniswap, for sponsoring bankless the era of proof of stake is upon us proof of stake systems like Ethereum, Terra and Solana allow the industry to move away from the hot, loud and wasteful proof of work systems and return back to a cottage industry of individual stakers and individual validators. And that is what we need to make this industry stay decentralized. Individuals must play their part in crypto network validation, and that is what Lido is here to do. Lido makes staking accessible to everyone at the click of a button. By delegating your stake to Lido's network of nodes, you can access the yield offered by proof of stake systems and claim your share of the network transaction rewards. Do you have 32 ETH and want to stake it to Ethereum? But running a node sounds intimidating.
01:24:02.902 - 01:24:34.980, Speaker B: Or maybe you have less than 32 eth and you need to pool your eth with others so you can access staking yields. Lido offers a solution for both. Simply go to Lido fi choose which assets you want to stake and deposit them to the Lido validating network. Lido is working to make sure proof of stake stays as decentralized as possible and is committed to decentralizing its own validating network to eventually become a completely permissionless protocol. So if you want to stake your EtH terra or Sol and get liquidity on your stake, go to Lido fi to get started.
01:24:35.430 - 01:24:44.406, Speaker A: Hey, guys, we are back with the takes of the week. David, let's start with the PSA here. Don't get fished on Uniswap. This is Harry Eve giving us the warning. What's going on here? Yeah.
01:24:44.428 - 01:25:04.714, Speaker B: So, for the listeners, this is a visual thing, but if you're on Twitter, the links that populate on Twitter, they comes with a preview, right? And so if you're used to seeing the same links, you'll see the same previews. There's a link here that has the uniswap unicorn logo. It says uniswap.org. It says uniswap swap. And they're all the same things that you'd see on uniswap. So, Ryan, let's go ahead and click that link and see where it goes.
01:25:04.832 - 01:25:07.134, Speaker A: Am I going to get fished here?
01:25:07.172 - 01:25:35.106, Speaker B: Oh, we are not on the uniswap page. We are on a page called harrydenly.com, who's probably the guy that made this website fake Twitter unfurling. And it says, do you trust links? Well, you shouldn't. And so basically, there is a way to make a link on Twitter look like it's going to someplace and then take you to a different place. And the idea is that it could take you to a clone of Uniswap that looks like Uniswap, acts like Uniswap, but instead takes all of your money. So don't get fished.
01:25:35.106 - 01:25:41.714, Speaker B: This is a new scam that we've seen. Now that we know about it, check your URLs, check your links. Verify everything, guys.
01:25:41.772 - 01:25:48.842, Speaker A: And there are so many phishing scams out there. Okay, so, like, discord all the time, 20 times a day, I get hit up by things.
01:25:48.896 - 01:25:50.850, Speaker B: Okay, don't click weird links in discord.
01:25:50.950 - 01:26:17.950, Speaker A: I get text messages these days. Like, ledger had a leak, for instance, that gave away a whole bunch of people's email addresses, phone numbers. I've gotten letters, okay? Like in the mail, physical letters, like phishing, please mail. If you're in crypto. Yeah, basically, if you're in crypto, expect to get these things, and they'll look like they're coming from legitimate sources. That's how a fish works. So this looks like it's coming from Uniswap.
01:26:17.950 - 01:26:36.746, Speaker A: I get text messages from Google, right? Google support saying, you got to check your gmail, stuff like this, be on the lookout for it. If you are in the crypto industry for any amount of time, you are going to become a phishing target. So be very skeptical of messages from unidentified sources as they come in. David, what's your take here?
01:26:36.848 - 01:27:04.830, Speaker B: Yeah, this is actually a talk that I gave at a local San Diego meetup, condensed down into tweet forum. I'm still working on the talk, but basically, I say, historically, banking has always been centralized, while artists have always been at the margins. Artists are on the frontier. They are exploring the margins. And I say with crypto, the institution of banking is outsourced to the individual. Banking is now also on the margins where the artists are. And I follow it up, saying, I'm so damn bullish on human culture.
01:27:04.830 - 01:27:13.350, Speaker B: If you put the money next to the artists, what do you think happens? Artists create more things like, that's awesome. And that is why I'm bullish on humanity.
01:27:13.770 - 01:27:33.098, Speaker A: Yeah, crypto is very bullish on humanity, actually, at least I think the ethereum ethos very much is. Let's take this take from Jason Choi. I'll read it out. Slow success builds character. Fast success builds ego. That's the take. He says it explains most of the people you'll meet in crypto.
01:27:33.098 - 01:28:06.214, Speaker A: Wow, that's true. This one hit me as far as, like, hey, this is my experience in crypto. There are a lot of people in crypto that have gotten wealthy very quickly, and some of them become pretty egotistical as a result of that. Some of my favorite people are the people who have been here for a long time and have gotten wrecked a few times. Okay. Like, just, like, made some dumb mistakes and gotten absolutely destroyed by them at some point in time. Right.
01:28:06.214 - 01:28:16.666, Speaker A: Or at least been through some shit. Right? So going through 2018, 2019, holding eth, you had a 95% price drop, guys. Okay.
01:28:16.768 - 01:28:19.450, Speaker B: Even more if you kept on buying on the way down like I did.
01:28:19.600 - 01:28:37.378, Speaker A: Right. That was even more painful. So that's the type of thing experience that really builds character. And honestly, it's like a quiet, humble type of. Type of character. Right. But on the other side, you see a lot of people who, man, they just yolo bet on something.
01:28:37.378 - 01:29:05.866, Speaker A: Now they know everything. Hi. I've been in crypto for, like, eight months, and I know exactly what's happening, and I've made, like, a 50 x return. Okay. I see a lot of these people, and they have pretty large egos because they haven't gone through the trenches that others have. So I don't know, this one just resonated with me, and it kind of explains what's actually going on. It's like too much success too quickly can build ego when it happens to people.
01:29:05.968 - 01:29:31.618, Speaker B: Let's do a thought experiment. Say there's two people, both of them at one point in time, both have a million dollar portfolio. One person ground and did research and was patient and was responsible. And dollar cost average into responsible assets that went up. And now that person, over the course of three to five years, has a million dollar portfolio. This person b aped into dogecoin and they were poor for all three to five years. And then all of a sudden, they have a million dollars.
01:29:31.618 - 01:29:37.910, Speaker B: Both people have a million dollars. Who do you think is going to be still wealthy in the next year? Right.
01:29:37.980 - 01:29:38.406, Speaker A: Right.
01:29:38.508 - 01:29:56.326, Speaker B: It's the guy that figured out how to actually maintain long term wealth and long term responsibility. Right. Like, if money comes to you extremely quickly, it can also go away from you extremely quickly. So it's good to practice long term thinking, long term responsibility, because, again, that's what Jason choice edge builds character.
01:29:56.438 - 01:30:17.826, Speaker A: Yeah. And I know someone's listening. He's being like, hey, look, everyone in crypto has gotten rich quick. Okay? Don't talk to me. I've been, like, investing for 30, 40 years, right? But then I go back to somebody like you had on layer zero this week, DC investor. Okay, DC investor has been here for a while, and he's gotten wealthy via crypto and nfts. Right.
01:30:17.826 - 01:30:46.874, Speaker A: But this wasn't an overnight success. Go listen to his story. Okay. He's been thinking about how to get out of the rat race and use his money so that his capital works while he's sleeping for his entire adult life, since college. Okay. And he's been involved in all sorts of different communities like this, investment communities. This is not suddenly he got rich because he made a lucky bet type of story.
01:30:46.874 - 01:31:08.050, Speaker A: And it's funny, too, because I see in somebody like DC investor that slow success that's built up character rather than the ego. And, yeah, I think that's what you get. So even in crypto, people think it's like overnight success, but it's not. And some of the best, some of my favorite people have gone through some serious stuff in crypto in order to get to the other side here.
01:31:08.120 - 01:31:18.178, Speaker B: Yeah, we are blessed that crypto moves faster than the rest of the world, and that includes our markets. But you don't want to go too much faster than that. That's when things sustainable.
01:31:18.274 - 01:31:26.966, Speaker A: That's right. And keep your ego in check. Right. Because this stuff is fleeting. Okay, let's talk about this take from Sam Altman. David, why don't you. Yeah.
01:31:27.068 - 01:31:57.822, Speaker B: Sam Altman says there is a special combination of optimism, excitement, camaraderie, exploration, frontier speed, and knowing a shared secret that existed in the startup community of 2005 to 2012. It has been dormant for a long time. It's nice to see it again in the web3 community. I really like that shared secret element. And this is like the difference between the people that hounded the discord CEO the people that hounded the discord CEO to get him pulled back on that ethereum integration. They didn't know this shared secret. Only we know the shared secret.
01:31:57.822 - 01:31:59.170, Speaker B: We've got the secret.
01:31:59.910 - 01:32:26.390, Speaker A: This is Sam Alton, by the way. I think this is the Y combinator guy. As you know, that has some resonance here. This is a take from Poly Naya, one of our favorites, talking about modular blockchains generally, but also has some fantastic takes. And he talks a lot about the settlement layer. And here's his tweet on five top criteria that matter for a settlement layer. This is the base layer, the layer one for assets and transactions.
01:32:26.390 - 01:32:49.662, Speaker A: And like the property rights layer that we talk about so much on bankless. He said the five things that matter are a culture of users running nodes, running their own nodes wide token distribution. That's number two, credible neutrality. It's number three. Number four is Lindy effect. That's like time without it breaking. And then number five is liquidity.
01:32:49.662 - 01:33:22.426, Speaker A: And then follows up with this. Bitcoin is still arguably the leader. So it's frustrating to see there's no concentrated effort to support roll ups. I think that's like two takes within the take, right? It's like bitcoin should be supporting roll ups because arguably it's leading or it's one of the number one contenders in a lot of these things. But I guess my take off of this is one. I completely agree. But this is also why not all layer ones are equal, right? Just because you say you're a layer one doesn't mean you have these five characteristics.
01:33:22.426 - 01:33:39.700, Speaker A: Your users running nodes wide, token distribution, credible Neutrality, Lindy time without breaking, and liquidity. Okay. And you have to have five of these to actually compete in the game. And of the chains that are competing in the game, it's honestly, right now it's only bitcoin. And.
01:33:41.510 - 01:33:47.966, Speaker B: Why would we consider those two things the bankless things? Because they are actually fighting for these five properties.
01:33:48.158 - 01:33:55.954, Speaker A: Absolutely. Yeah. So anyway, it was just nice to see kind of a breakdown of what those things are? And if you have anything to add to this. David.
01:33:56.002 - 01:34:23.198, Speaker B: Yeah, I put out a tweet that was along the lines of like, hey, do you have any favorite l one that you identify with? And everyone in crypto has their favorite l one. And then I said, do you understand the values that are embodied in that l one? Because if you haven't consciously thought about that, you need to and then reply to that, like, oh, my favorite l one. Is this my favorite? Kind of misunderstanding the point of the tweet? And so when I say, do you understand the values of what is embodied in your l one?
01:34:23.284 - 01:34:24.014, Speaker A: It's a lot of this.
01:34:24.052 - 01:34:48.578, Speaker B: Like, do the people run the nodes? Is the actual system decentralized by the people, for the people? Is there a wide token distribution? Do we all have access to the upside? Is it credibly neutral, or does it king make, does it bestow rights that some people have that other people don't? How long has it been running without breaking? And then, of course, liquidity, which we talked about at the very beginning of the show, is the actual l one asset liquid.
01:34:48.754 - 01:34:52.374, Speaker A: Do you know what's not listed there is transaction throughput.
01:34:52.502 - 01:34:53.226, Speaker B: Yes.
01:34:53.408 - 01:34:56.122, Speaker A: How many TPS transactions per second you have?
01:34:56.176 - 01:35:09.578, Speaker B: Well, that's why he says, I'm frustrated to see that there's no concerted effort to support roll ups on bitcoin, because actually, he did actually put that there. But it's, again, not at the settlement layer, because TPS doesn't happen at the settlement layer. TPS happens at the roll up layer.
01:35:09.674 - 01:35:12.334, Speaker A: That's right. Bitcoin could totally do this. It's just not.
01:35:12.372 - 01:35:13.582, Speaker B: It just needs a hard work.
01:35:13.716 - 01:35:16.642, Speaker A: Let's see this. David, what's this tweet, and what's the take here?
01:35:16.696 - 01:35:52.106, Speaker B: Yeah, this is Clon. Clon is the OG guy behind the cool cats nfts, and he does a first now and then later tweet or picture. There's two tweets, two pictures. 2015, there's this kind of, like, shoddy looking tent with a bunch of cat drawings that are hanging up on strings. Kind of looks pretty weak, but turns out the guy really cares about cats and didn't quit. And now, in 2021, on the right side, you see cool cats on these led screens, which are in New York, amazing Times Square. This is what I'm talking about.
01:35:52.106 - 01:36:27.218, Speaker B: This is the exact perfect representation of what I'm talking about. When you remove central banking and you push money and banking to the periphery, where the artists are, all of a sudden these guys that really care about their art that are going to stick through it, get funded, and all of a sudden we see cute little cats on Times Square billboards. This is what happens when you fund artists. This is the power of NFTs. This is the power of having an asset, like being able to democratize making nfts, making assets to everyone. You generate communities, you generate culture, you generate art. So congratulations to Klon.
01:36:27.218 - 01:36:35.100, Speaker B: If you're listening to this, I actually met you at the LA Coolcats meetup. I don't know if you knew who I was, but I appreciate all of your work and I love your community.
01:36:35.790 - 01:36:56.206, Speaker A: Yeah, it's just like, what? This is like the golden age for creators, man. The opportunities here, you go from kind of a tent, an obscurity, to you go from, like, Times Square, right? And this is only possible because of crypto. Back in 2015, when Khan was in this tent, this whole NFT Avenue was not available to him and didn't even.
01:36:56.228 - 01:36:57.538, Speaker B: Have even thinking about it.
01:36:57.624 - 01:37:10.102, Speaker A: Right? Yeah. It hadn't even been invented, so what a golden era. What a golden age to be a creator these days. David, let's talk about what we're excited about. So let me ask you the question. What are you excited about this week?
01:37:10.156 - 01:37:42.394, Speaker B: Yeah, two things, Ryan, two things I'm excited about. This thing that I learned called manifold contracts. And there's a story here. So while I was at NFT NYC, the last day, Friday, I went to an in real life NFT art show. And a little fun fact about me. Fun fact is, once upon a time, I was a photographer that was really interested in taking, like, cityscape, city skylines, geography pictures, and then making these hdrs where you would take pictures across many, many brightnesses and then compress them down into one image. So you get the full range of color and spectrum.
01:37:42.394 - 01:38:13.466, Speaker B: It added a bit of a surreal nature to these cityscapes. I go into this NfT in real life art show, and I see this very, very surreal drone footage of New York. And it was on a loop, but it was like 20 minutes long. And I watched the whole thing, and I was just, like, mesmerized by it. And so it's like this guy took a drone, flew it around New York, added this AI algorithm to make it really surreal, really watercolored. He called some the painted cities. And then I met the artist because he was there.
01:38:13.466 - 01:38:55.126, Speaker B: And so there was eight different individual units that he was displaying, and he hadn't actually minted these things. And so I do a handshake deal with him, and I buy every single one, the whole series to swept the floor. And the thing is, they weren't minted, so it was a handshake deal. And so I've had to go on a journey with this guy, with this guy Nate, to actually figure out how to mint these damn things. And I didn't really realize how big of a problem this is that is currently being tackled right now by so many different teams. And so I asked around, because if you mint them on, like, foundation, if you mint them on super rare, you're putting, what's that word, provenance in foundation or super rare. And we don't want that.
01:38:55.126 - 01:39:30.930, Speaker B: That's a little bit of the web two model. I'm sure super rare and foundation have something to say about this, but I want the artist to have the provenance. I want to buy them from Nate the artist, not super rare, the platform. And so I want Nate to mint the tokens. And so going through the journey of asking people around, like, hey, guys, how do we do this? Because I want my art, I want my nfts that I paid a lot for to be on all the platforms, not just the one that we minted them on. We discovered this thing called manifold contracts from the Manifold team. And Manifold is this cool NFT minting platform that they call it state list, as in, like, it doesn't host anything.
01:39:30.930 - 01:40:10.606, Speaker B: It takes your tokens and mints you some contracts. That is yours as an artist, and then you can mint the nfts, and that is, again, your contracts. And then it takes the data of the NFT, the actual JPEG, or in this case, like a gigabyte size of footage, puts them on rweave for decentralized file storage, and then the tokens are owned by the artist and can go anywhere. Opensea super Rare foundation, like, whatever NFT platforms show up, and it gives complete ownership to the artists. So Manifold doesn't actually collect any rent from this process. They are just supporting infrastructure to mint these tokens. And I'm really bullish on that.
01:40:10.606 - 01:40:30.034, Speaker B: That's really, really cool. And so we're waiting for gas prices to come down because it's going to cost a bunch of gas to mint these things. But I'm really excited for that. And just, like, learning through that whole process, we're going to get a manifold on a state of the nation to talk about this process. And that is what I'm excited about. Only the first thing, though. The second thing is I'm also excited about Metaverso in Puerto Rico, which is the first week of December.
01:40:30.034 - 01:40:38.120, Speaker B: So Puerto Rico, blockchain week. G money's throwing metaverse. I'll be speaking there. So if you guys are going to Metaverso in Puerto Rico for the first week of December, I will see you.
01:40:39.390 - 01:40:49.002, Speaker A: Very cool, man. Yeah, I would love to learn more about manifold, honestly. And this whole minting process from that angle, I've not learned about that yet.
01:40:49.056 - 01:40:58.400, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I'm glad I actually had the experience. I didn't know that this was a problem that exists, and now I'm exploring how to solve it. And so I will report back when I find out. Ryan, what are you excited about?
01:40:59.010 - 01:41:33.370, Speaker A: What am I? Okay, so I'm excited that I always think about this a little bit when the holidays come about, which is like talking to friends and family about crypto, right. Because you know they're going to ask, especially in up years. Usually they're quiet, like in the bear market. So I tweeted this out. What was the most common objections to crypto you hear from your family and friends? Just put that out there. Then I read through the objections, David, and my impression was like, holy crap. That's all you got, right? Most of the objections are just a result of a massive education gap.
01:41:33.370 - 01:42:01.106, Speaker A: I was left again with the impression that we're still early. It was just the same old stuff, like, nothing backs a bitcoin. The governments are going to shut it down. It doesn't scale. I can't buy my coffee with crypto yet. It's like the same old objections that have been answered in a thousand ways a thousand different times. There's really nothing meaningful here that's new or different.
01:42:01.106 - 01:42:42.800, Speaker A: And so, yeah, I was just left with that impression that's like, wow, it's been a while since I've kind of peeked my head up from crypto and talked to people in the real world who aren't yet. I guess crypto pilled, aren't yet into why we're in this industry and what we're doing here. And the objections just haven't really gotten any better. In fact, they've deteriorated. Right? Even what does crypto actually do? What are the products behind it? Like, wow, we have answers to all of those things now. I mean, go check out a dharma wallet. Where else can you get 8% yield? Like nfts? Where do they exist? The metaverse Facebook is even seeing this future.
01:42:42.800 - 01:42:58.498, Speaker A: So I think it'll be a different conversation, I guess, during the holidays for many people, and we'll have a lot to show, but I guess just be prepared. The objections haven't really gotten any better. And I guess that's bullish for crypto.
01:42:58.594 - 01:43:18.806, Speaker B: I think my take here is that if they haven't gotten better and they've only gotten worse, that's because only worse and worse objections actually can work anymore because we've answered all the good objections. Here's a good objection. And then we solve that problem. Right. And so we're actually eating away at all the objections because we're actually delivering on some of these promises.
01:43:18.998 - 01:43:24.238, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's true, too. So anyway, that's what I got. David, you ready for meme of the week?
01:43:24.324 - 01:43:50.434, Speaker B: Yeah. Which one? We got two of them this week, right? Yeah. Okay, so we've done this meme format before. So this is the army man protecting the sleeping child, right? So we have the SEC and it's protecting the sleeping child from a bunch of money coming in with the airdrops. Like no sec does no money for the child. Meanwhile, on the other side of the frame, we have crypto scams coming in hot with grenades and knives going right. For retail investors.
01:43:50.434 - 01:43:54.498, Speaker B: So SeC protecting you from those airdrops, but not from the scams.
01:43:54.674 - 01:44:02.374, Speaker A: This about summarizes it and maybe is a call for a switch of priorities there, David. Let's do this next tweet. What's this?
01:44:02.412 - 01:44:08.562, Speaker B: This one's great. I'm pretty sure Michael Wong made this one, but the last time I said this on the show, it turns out it was actually you, Ryan. So maybe you'll.
01:44:08.626 - 01:44:09.286, Speaker A: No, this was not me.
01:44:09.308 - 01:44:25.246, Speaker B: This was not you. So this is the guy looking in the mirror of his car. The mirror says objects in mirror are closer than they appear. The guy is banks. Banks are looking in the mirror. Objects in mirror are closer than they appear. What's in the mirror? L two scaling, just coming fast.
01:44:25.246 - 01:44:26.206, Speaker B: Coming fast.
01:44:26.308 - 01:44:28.610, Speaker A: He's chasing down like a predator. That's awesome.
01:44:28.680 - 01:44:56.010, Speaker B: All right, guys, Ryan is about to give his very famous disclaimer. But after the disclaimer, we have two moments of Zen. They are both songs about Ens, one is about the ENS Dow, one's about the ENS airdrop. They are both really catchy and I'm just extremely surprised that both of these songs are fantastic. One of these, the first one is going to be by a guy, Jonathan, I think is his name, that makes one song a day and he's done this for like 5000 days or something like that. Something crazy. And the other song is a rap artist that I don't know.
01:44:56.010 - 01:45:01.174, Speaker B: But they're both good. They're both good. Okay, so stay tuned for that. Ryan, tell us about going west.
01:45:01.222 - 01:45:14.222, Speaker A: Yeah, stay tuned for the sick beats. But I got to tell you, none of this has been financial advice. Of course, eth is risky. Bitcoin is risky. All of crypto is risky. You could definitely lose what you put in. But what are we doing, David? We are headed west.
01:45:14.222 - 01:45:19.538, Speaker A: This is the frontier. It's not for everyone. But we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
01:45:19.704 - 01:47:16.070, Speaker C: The core components of Ens are decentralized. Nobody can take away somebody else's prize. But still, there are just a few things that need a special discretionary touch of a human it. Autonomous organization. Time. Use your token to vote for what you think is right Jamie song and all these are mine and come what may they will remain till the end of time come on, we got the power to take come on we're all gonna make it air dropping the stimulus stimulus air dropping the stimulus.
