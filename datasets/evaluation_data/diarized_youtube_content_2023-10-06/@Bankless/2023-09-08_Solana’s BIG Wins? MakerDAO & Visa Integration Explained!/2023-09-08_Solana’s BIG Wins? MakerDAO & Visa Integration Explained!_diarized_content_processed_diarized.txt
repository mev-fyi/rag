00:00:00.170 - 00:00:04.158, Speaker A: Is MakerDAO's endgame on solana? David, what are we looking at here?
00:00:04.244 - 00:00:25.750, Speaker B: Okay, so Roon Christensen puts out this tweet that like, rocked the ethereum community and the broader crypto world. I say and he just says, the last phase of Endgame is the launch of a native blockchain for Maker with codename new chain. It will make the ecosystem more secure and efficient. After some research, I believe the Solana code base should be considered as the basis for new chain.
00:00:29.370 - 00:00:33.314, Speaker A: It is the second Friday of September, and it is time for what, David?
00:00:33.362 - 00:00:43.190, Speaker B: The bankless Friday weekly roll up where we cover the entire weekly news in crypto. And that is always an ambitious endeavor. And Ryan and I are squeezed for time today. So we're going to go so fast through this agenda.
00:00:43.270 - 00:00:44.406, Speaker A: We're going to go so fast, David.
00:00:44.438 - 00:00:46.300, Speaker B: It'S going to take us 90 minutes.
00:00:46.750 - 00:00:54.314, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a promise. You can commit that to the blockchain settlement assurances. David, it's good to see you, man. Back from Burning Man.
00:00:54.352 - 00:00:54.690, Speaker B: Back from burning.
00:00:54.710 - 00:01:07.498, Speaker A: Glad you came back. Destroying some horror cruxes. Do you hear the Twitter rumor you're destroying horror cruxes? Every time you go away, something bad happens to Gary Gensler. I know. Like he loses a court case.
00:01:07.604 - 00:01:09.842, Speaker B: I'm aware of what happens.
00:01:09.976 - 00:01:11.714, Speaker A: So what are you really doing, my friend?
00:01:11.752 - 00:01:17.698, Speaker B: What am I really doing? Was I truly at Burning Man? How did I get back so soon from Burning Man while everyone else got stuck? What's the deal with that?
00:01:17.784 - 00:01:22.134, Speaker A: Yeah, and when are you going again? When am I leaving? Next question.
00:01:22.252 - 00:01:31.754, Speaker B: Do not have another trip planned that's not a crypto conference for a while. So Gary Gensler is going to be rest. Okay. For now. He's already gone.
00:01:31.952 - 00:01:46.478, Speaker A: Yeah, he is. We're going to talk about that. But when you're gone, some things happened. So the first is MakerDAO, at least. Rune Christensen said the final stage of endgame for MakerDAO is solana. Question mark. We're going to talk about that.
00:01:46.478 - 00:01:47.886, Speaker A: What else we got going on?
00:01:47.988 - 00:02:00.850, Speaker B: Also in Salana, world Visa announces it's going to settle USDC on Salana, while simultaneously this week the base layer two sees a halt in block production. Did Salana take the dub this week?
00:02:01.000 - 00:02:01.700, Speaker A: Wow.
00:02:02.550 - 00:02:27.414, Speaker B: Okay. But including to those dubs, uniswap takes a dub in the courts, adding to the tally of crypto dubs and TradFi l's. And then also I did not see this coming, but Justin Bieber drops an NFT that I give two thumbs up for quality and integrity. It's a good looked at this. Well, I didn't mint it. I'm not a Justin Bieber fan. I'm not not a Justin Bieber fan.
00:02:27.414 - 00:02:35.254, Speaker B: But this NFT is not like all the others. So we will talk about why this NFT is different and what it means as a model for future NFT drops.
00:02:35.382 - 00:02:42.474, Speaker A: Well, good job, Biebs in advance, guys. Before we get in today, there's a message from our friends and sponsors over at Ave. David do you ever use Ave?
00:02:42.522 - 00:02:44.814, Speaker B: I'm currently using Ave. Oh, my God.
00:02:44.852 - 00:03:12.902, Speaker A: Ave is the best. And Ave wants us to let you know that Ave V Three is here. And why are we telling you this now? Ave V Three, actually, David, came out in January of this year, which means it's a bit more hardened, it's a bit more tested, and there is some protocol liquidity to migrate from V Two to the new Ave. So that is the message. There are some benefits that come with ave v three. Do you know what those are, David?
00:03:12.966 - 00:03:26.878, Speaker B: Oh, there's a handful of them. There's more efficiency. There's reduced gas prices for swapping. You can swap collateral without having to unwind, trade on uniswap and then put it back in. Ave will just do all that for you. I'm doing this from memory. Is there anything else? What else did I miss?
00:03:26.964 - 00:03:50.182, Speaker A: No, you got it. Asset isolation mode. So there's lower risk for different asset pools, all of those things. So if you are an Ave V Two user, then you can move your assets from V Two to V three with an easy migration tool. That's on App Ave.com. And if you're a builder, by the way, so Ave just released their Go stablecoin, if you remember that. And they are funding anyone who is building on top of Go.
00:03:50.182 - 00:03:58.546, Speaker A: So there's a link in the show notes Avegrants.org, where you can get your grant on if you're building something on Go. That's it, man you ready to get to the markets?
00:03:58.578 - 00:04:00.006, Speaker B: I'm ready to get to the markets, yeah.
00:04:00.108 - 00:04:03.274, Speaker A: Okay, here we go. Bitcoin on the week. Tell us, what are we looking at?
00:04:03.312 - 00:04:09.180, Speaker B: Everything is flat. Everything. The whole markets are flat. Should we call it good? Nothing has happened.
00:04:09.630 - 00:04:12.742, Speaker A: So you're telling me bitcoin's flat, ETH is flat.
00:04:12.806 - 00:04:18.682, Speaker B: We can just cut in ratio prices from last episode and it would be the exact same man pancake flat.
00:04:18.746 - 00:04:22.094, Speaker A: I feel like that's, like, been the last month or so, last six weeks.
00:04:22.132 - 00:04:33.426, Speaker B: I mean, we're incrementaling downwards. Like, ETH is low right now. 1630, that is a low price. Bitcoin at 25,800. That's a low price. Things are low.
00:04:33.608 - 00:04:37.122, Speaker A: Yeah. Are you feeling in the mood to buy last week?
00:04:37.176 - 00:04:40.786, Speaker B: I mean, if I don't do anything, I buy because of reoccurring buys.
00:04:40.898 - 00:04:51.078, Speaker A: I mean, anything below like two K. But if we get below 1500 on ether, that is like buy zone. Wait, do you think we could get back to triple digit ETH?
00:04:51.094 - 00:04:52.714, Speaker B: David, moving on.
00:04:52.752 - 00:04:55.446, Speaker A: Do you think we could get back to triple digits?
00:04:55.558 - 00:05:04.458, Speaker B: Triple digits below 1500 is on the table. Like, that's totally reasonable. Three digits is not on the table.
00:05:04.474 - 00:05:06.286, Speaker A: If we get to triple digits, then I called it.
00:05:06.308 - 00:05:06.494, Speaker B: Okay.
00:05:06.532 - 00:05:20.114, Speaker A: And I never competed. No uncall backs. All right? I called it once. That counts. If it dips. All right, well, we'll see what's in store in this crab market. And thanks to Kraken, as always.
00:05:20.114 - 00:05:34.966, Speaker A: For providing these glorious charts, even though nothing at all is happening on them. Here are some charts that things are happening on. This is on layer two beat. We got TVL going up. We got scaling factor going up. Let's see, let me look at the.
00:05:35.148 - 00:05:41.182, Speaker B: Down, because apparently three and a half percent down. We're below $10 billion on layer twos.
00:05:41.266 - 00:05:42.726, Speaker A: All right, hold your breath.
00:05:42.758 - 00:05:47.946, Speaker B: It'll be back up above $10 billion. Oh, my God, that activity chart is so good.
00:05:48.048 - 00:05:48.794, Speaker A: Activity is going.
00:05:48.832 - 00:05:49.690, Speaker B: That makes me so happy.
00:05:49.760 - 00:05:50.700, Speaker A: It's going up.
00:05:51.070 - 00:05:52.794, Speaker B: There's always a bull market somewhere.
00:05:52.922 - 00:06:13.700, Speaker A: Well, look at this. StarkNet had a big week this week, apparently. Here's an article from the defiant StarkNet activity surges on token speculation. So apparently somebody tweeted this out, maybe from the StarkNet account, a tweet that was then deleted about StarkNet tokens. So there's some additional speculation going on.
00:06:14.150 - 00:06:30.070, Speaker B: There's no confusion that StarkNet has the StarkNet token is minted. There is a contract address. It does exist. That's not what's being up for. Speculation. This story of how StarkNet tokens becomes distributed is the unknown thing. And I think the reason why it's unknown is the Starkware.org
00:06:30.070 - 00:06:47.150, Speaker B: is hands off, and they are totally giving it up to the foundation and some sort of just like, community decided governance about how to distribute the thing. And so I think if you want alpha on StarkNet distribution plans, I'm pretty sure that information is public. You just have to go sift through forums.
00:06:47.650 - 00:06:50.654, Speaker A: I thought it would have been distributed by now. I thought they would have kind of.
00:06:50.692 - 00:07:11.058, Speaker B: It is partially being distributed. Unlike previous tokens with, like, retroactive airdrops, blah, blah, blah. There's not like one distribution event. They are saying like, okay, these people are good and doing valuable stuff, let's give them some tokens, and then that gets distributed. And then repeat this process many, many times, and all of a sudden we have a liquid token. I don't think the token is liquid, though. It's definitely not liquid.
00:07:11.154 - 00:07:20.922, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't think it's liquid. Anyway, we got L two beat activity going up. At least that is going up on the week. David, how many crypto millionaires do you think there are? Just guess.
00:07:21.056 - 00:07:23.194, Speaker B: Less this year than last year, that's for sure.
00:07:23.312 - 00:07:26.618, Speaker A: Okay, how many? How many are you talking?
00:07:26.704 - 00:07:30.300, Speaker B: How many crypto millionaires are there? Over 10,000.
00:07:30.750 - 00:07:31.514, Speaker A: Over 10,000?
00:07:31.552 - 00:07:36.142, Speaker B: Not 100,000. Everyone in the bankless community, every single.
00:07:36.196 - 00:07:39.760, Speaker A: That has been here since the podcast number one.
00:07:41.170 - 00:07:44.606, Speaker B: Maybe up to 100,000 is my final answer.
00:07:44.708 - 00:07:57.734, Speaker A: Up to 100,000. All right, well, here's the answer for you, at least according to Henley and Partners. Really close. David, 88,200. I am total crypto millionaires, according to this report.
00:07:57.852 - 00:07:59.286, Speaker B: Stuff like this, correct?
00:07:59.468 - 00:08:19.354, Speaker A: 182 centimillionaires. That's 100 million and above, apparently, in crypto. And 22 billionaires in crypto. Only minted billionaires. Yeah. And according to this anyway, this is why I'm actually not sure of these stats. The total crypto users is 425,000,000 okay.
00:08:19.354 - 00:08:32.186, Speaker A: This is henley and partners compiled a crypto wealth report. Apparently they do this thing for all sorts of other asset classes, and they list their methodology on the methodology page. And it's kind of like I wish.
00:08:32.218 - 00:08:34.320, Speaker B: There was a standard for public information.
00:08:34.770 - 00:08:47.074, Speaker A: Yeah. In house, it's like a proprietary database type things. So I don't know how accurate this is, but interesting data set nonetheless. Yeah, millionaires sent to millionaires and billionaires in crypto.
00:08:47.202 - 00:08:49.000, Speaker B: Let's add some zeros onto those numbers.
00:08:49.690 - 00:08:50.950, Speaker A: Trillionaires.
00:08:52.010 - 00:08:59.726, Speaker B: The number of millionaires. I guess that's the greatest thing. But I'd rather have more millionaires than more trillionaires in crypto.
00:08:59.778 - 00:09:02.234, Speaker A: More distribution. Yes, more distribution here.
00:09:02.352 - 00:09:05.222, Speaker B: I want every single listener of this podcast to be a millionaire.
00:09:05.366 - 00:09:11.478, Speaker A: Oh, really? Is that saying something about the dollar inflating? Because that's the next story I've got for you. You ready?
00:09:11.504 - 00:09:16.320, Speaker B: That's not what I had in mind, but that's one shortcut of the way to there.
00:09:16.690 - 00:09:52.354, Speaker A: Get all the millionaires. US. Deficits explode despite the growing economy, there's actually been this was a Washington Post article, which I don't often see these types of things in mainstream media, like the Washington Post talking about US. Deficit explosion. But did you know, David, that the deficit, the US. Deficit this year that is spending more in kind of their fiscal, their annual budget than previous years, it's going to rise from about 4% of GDP last year to almost 8% this year of GDP.
00:09:52.402 - 00:10:08.266, Speaker B: So 8%, just understanding this, this means that if the deficit is 8% of GDP, is that as a whole we need to take 8% of our economy, the revenue from our economy, every single year and pay that to stay flat in our bills?
00:10:08.298 - 00:10:13.502, Speaker A: Well, we're going in debt by like 8% of our GDP every single year.
00:10:13.556 - 00:10:16.862, Speaker B: So every single year we owe 8% of our GDP to stay flat?
00:10:17.006 - 00:10:21.858, Speaker A: Yeah, right now this is kind of the year what do you mean to stay flat, though?
00:10:21.944 - 00:10:23.970, Speaker B: That's not to sink further in debt?
00:10:24.470 - 00:10:34.262, Speaker A: No, that is us sinking further in debt. This 8% is basically of our GDP, another 8% in the whole. That's what's happening this year.
00:10:34.316 - 00:10:35.142, Speaker B: That feels large.
00:10:35.196 - 00:10:36.774, Speaker A: Things more clear. It is large.
00:10:36.812 - 00:10:37.894, Speaker B: That feels large.
00:10:38.092 - 00:10:51.498, Speaker A: So this was COVID, right? Big bump in terms of deficit. So 3.1 trillion in 2020. You might expect that 2.8 trillion in 2021. Then it went way down in 2022. Well, now it's back up to 2 trillion.
00:10:51.498 - 00:11:04.590, Speaker A: And just for some context here, we've only had higher deficits as a share of GDP in 1942 to 1945. World War II, three years. Yeah, you remember that? Well, you don't remember that?
00:11:04.660 - 00:11:05.374, Speaker B: I know what those are.
00:11:05.412 - 00:11:17.614, Speaker A: Those dates ring a bell. 2009 to 2011. Remember those dates? Okay. And then 2022 and 2021. Okay, COVID, those are the only years we've had a higher deficit.
00:11:17.662 - 00:11:20.594, Speaker B: Wait, but this is a normal year because COVID's behind us.
00:11:20.792 - 00:11:23.042, Speaker A: It's not normal from a deficit perspective.
00:11:23.106 - 00:11:24.950, Speaker B: What's going on yeah.
00:11:25.020 - 00:11:43.274, Speaker A: Anyway, I mean, we kind of have talked about this a little bit, interest payments going up and some of the reasons tax revenue apparently is way down. So that's another contributing factor. Government's going to have to print money out of this one. Which maybe brings us to what's going on in Turkey. David, you read the headline here.
00:11:43.312 - 00:12:14.038, Speaker B: Yeah. So the follow up on this happening right after we talk about deficit is too good and also in a bad way. Okay. So over the last year and a half, adoption in Turkey of crypto has increased from 40% to 52% of the Turkish population. So 12% of the Turkish population has adopted crypto in the last year and a half. That's pretty good. And why is this happening? Well, Turkey inflation, which is what a deficit in your budget leads to, right? That's the right logic, yes.
00:12:14.038 - 00:12:41.534, Speaker B: Turkey reported 60% inflation in August. So according to this Kucoin article blog article, our findings in Turkey and other previous country reports, the growing number and percentage of crypto investors indicate an increasing interest in acceptance of crypto as a hedge against inflation, especially with the Turkish Lira losing over 50% of its value against the US dollar. So is this America's future? Hopefully not soon, but slowly, inevitably, yes.
00:12:41.732 - 00:12:54.350, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think it's interesting. So I don't know how reliable these percentages are. The sample size is somewhat small, but I mean, this report is saying 40% to 52% of the Turkish population owns some crypto.
00:12:54.430 - 00:13:11.954, Speaker B: Yeah. So there's like an interesting set of countries out there, and I think it might be data points of two. Argentina and Turkey of internet connected developed countries with high inflation are also the spearhead of crypto adoption.
00:13:12.082 - 00:13:47.362, Speaker A: Right. I mean, this is the crypto use case. Some people are like, well, where are the use cases? Where are the use cases? Well, when you have a fully developed kind of bank system and you have like Venmo and PayPal and other things, then normies don't need this as much. When you have capital controls, when you have your store of value currency inflating away, well, you very much need this and it's good to see kind of crypto holding up its use cases where it's most needed. David, a follow up from last week. All right, we got some maybe good bitcoin ETF news. Of course, you heard about the court case that was one.
00:13:47.362 - 00:13:55.078, Speaker A: Here is a follow up from one of the analysts in that space who's really tracking this. This is Eric B. What is Eric saying?
00:13:55.164 - 00:14:32.610, Speaker B: Eric and his colleague James are saying that they are upping their ODS of a spot bitcoin ETF launching this year up to 75% ODS. So three out of four ODS and then also 95% by the end of 2024, which is pretty good. These are just two people's numbers, two informed people's numbers. They said that they previously had a 65% odds of spot bitcoin ETF launching this year. But since the Grayscale court case, they have upped that to 75%. Basically they are saying that the SEC has been left with very little wiggle room. And then they are also adding that beyond the legal loss, this is just overall a PR loss for Mr.
00:14:32.610 - 00:14:34.850, Speaker B: Gensler. Sucks to suck.
00:14:35.510 - 00:14:56.122, Speaker A: It does. By the way, Eric and James, these are the people who know actually we had James in the podcast. I did that one solo while you're out. He's absolutely phenomenal. And he tweets a follow up here. Next dates to watch the middle of October are the next major days to watch for the Bitcoin ETF, namely October 16. Well, David, something else happened this week as well.
00:14:56.122 - 00:15:02.954, Speaker A: And this is again from an ETF analyst, eric B. Boom. Arc just filed for a spot.
00:15:03.002 - 00:15:04.426, Speaker B: Ether ETF.
00:15:04.618 - 00:15:17.802, Speaker A: The first one probably more coming imminent. All right, we're just talking about a Bitcoin spot ETF potentially getting approved either this year or maybe early next year. And we're talking about those ODS.
00:15:17.866 - 00:15:27.730, Speaker B: Well, he says probably not the only one. That's also true. A 21 shares that that company also filed for its bot Ether ETF this week too.
00:15:27.800 - 00:15:30.726, Speaker A: They did. I missed that. There's two.
00:15:30.908 - 00:15:34.840, Speaker B: And both would like to custody their assets with Coinbase custody. Interesting.
00:15:35.370 - 00:15:58.702, Speaker A: I mean, it's so great that Bitcoin is kind of macheting its way through the regulatory jungle. And once it gets a spot Bitcoin ETF approved, then you got to think that the spot Ether ETF is just like months away. At least if Gary Gensler doesn't get his way. I mean, it seems to be that's going to be what's happening because there's no excuse to not follow up with.
00:15:58.756 - 00:16:12.478, Speaker B: Gary Gensler has their ETF. Yes. The dislocation between the fundamentals of this entire industry and the prices, it's like nearing all time highs. Highs I have not seen since like 2018 to 2019.
00:16:12.574 - 00:16:15.906, Speaker A: Are you telling me it's not priced in? You think that the retail what I.
00:16:15.928 - 00:16:22.390, Speaker B: Say crypto prices are going down and the ETF is becoming more and more assured sooner.
00:16:23.050 - 00:16:26.230, Speaker A: Why do you think that's a big deal? So just an ETF product will just.
00:16:26.300 - 00:16:29.990, Speaker B: Big detail big pipes of money to buy our assets.
00:16:30.410 - 00:16:41.206, Speaker A: I mean, one example of this is financial advisors. How many financial advisors do you know or how many people you know? Like just normal people who get their advice from their professional financial advisor.
00:16:41.238 - 00:16:45.342, Speaker B: Like Edward Jones guy, the sheep of the world. Yeah, by definition, like most of them.
00:16:45.476 - 00:16:55.118, Speaker A: The people who know pay attention to their finances as much. Right. Well, the reason most financial professionals in the US don't actually recommend crypto is because they don't have crypto products there's.
00:16:55.124 - 00:16:56.370, Speaker B: No. Yes.
00:16:56.440 - 00:17:04.034, Speaker A: Yeah. And so once they get a ETF, which is what they do, these types of financial advisors, they just recommend ETFs all day. Right.
00:17:04.072 - 00:17:18.360, Speaker B: Imagine what FTX did for the financial advisors who were trying to say, yo, let's get some crypto in your portfolio. We're going to open up an exchange, a crypto exchange just with this company called Coinbase. What's the difference between Coinbase and like I can't explain that to you because.
00:17:18.890 - 00:17:20.986, Speaker A: They would never advise. They would never do that.
00:17:21.008 - 00:17:27.690, Speaker B: But now there is a buy this Bitcoin ETF button inside of their Charles Schwab brokerage, which they already exactly.
00:17:27.840 - 00:17:36.462, Speaker A: All the other assets. Right. So just allocate two 3%. That'll probably be the advice coming down the pike. David, this is really cool. What are we looking at here?
00:17:36.516 - 00:17:51.214, Speaker B: Rasterly. Rock. Ryan Rasmondson. Fun fact, I went to college with him. Uniswap flipped Coinbase's. Spot trading volume in Q One and Q Two. So two quarters in a row has Uniswap been the number one source of liquidity versus Coinbase.
00:17:51.342 - 00:17:58.246, Speaker A: That is surprising me. Is that surprising you? I mean, it's always been inevitable, man. I know we thought this and we.
00:17:58.268 - 00:18:07.126, Speaker B: Predicted this, but yeah, it's nice to see two quarters in a row. How many quarters can we get? Maybe four.
00:18:07.228 - 00:18:08.018, Speaker A: Forever.
00:18:08.194 - 00:18:09.362, Speaker B: Forever. It's on the table.
00:18:09.426 - 00:18:10.102, Speaker A: Forever more.
00:18:10.156 - 00:18:10.754, Speaker B: Forever more.
00:18:10.812 - 00:18:12.646, Speaker A: Coinbase will never exceed Uniswap.
00:18:12.678 - 00:18:12.874, Speaker B: Sorry.
00:18:12.912 - 00:18:13.786, Speaker A: Coinbase now on.
00:18:13.888 - 00:18:16.234, Speaker B: You're doing great. Uniswap's great, too.
00:18:16.272 - 00:18:18.362, Speaker A: Yeah. What are we doing? Coming up next?
00:18:18.416 - 00:18:40.570, Speaker B: Coming up next, rune envisions MakerDAO on a solana chain. We're going to unpack that. I've actually got some pretty hot takes to give. Of course, MakerDAO has always been near and dear to my heart, and so I'm going to give my perspective there. I think it's a pretty good perspective. Arbitrum is releasing stylus. Stylus is coming to Mainnet to do some multi language building on top of Ethereum to route around the constraints of solidity.
00:18:40.570 - 00:19:00.854, Speaker B: And another big win for DeFi in the court system. We're going to get to all of this and more.

00:19:28.552 - 00:19:29.042, Speaker A: Today.
00:19:29.176 - 00:20:26.782, Speaker B: Mantle, formerly known as Bitdao, is the first dowled Web three ecosystem, all built on top of Mantle's first core product, the Mantle Network, a brand new high performance Ethereum layer two built using the Op stack but uses eigen layer's data availability solution instead of the expensive Ethereum layer one. Not only does this reduce Mantle network's gas fees by 80%, but it also reduces gas fee volatility, providing a more stable foundation for Mantle's applications. The Mantle Treasury is one of the biggest Dow owned Treasuries, which is seeding an ecosystem of projects from all around the web3 space for Mantle. Mantle already has subcommunities from around web3 onboarded, like Game Seven for web3 gaming and Bybit for TVL and Liquidity and Onramp. So if you want to build on the Mantle network, mantle is offering a grants program that provides milestone based funding to promising projects that help expand secure and decentralize Mantle. If you want to get started working with the first Dowled layer two ecosystem, check out Mantle at Mantle XYZ and follow them on Twitter at zero xmantle.
00:20:26.846 - 00:20:30.918, Speaker A: Is MakerDAO's endgame on salana. David, what are we looking at here?
00:20:31.004 - 00:21:00.990, Speaker B: Okay, so Roon Christensen puts out this tweet that rocked the Ethereum community and the broader crypto world. I say, and he just says, the last phase of Endgame. MakerDAO has this endgame plan. So this is the name of this plan. Endgame is the launch of a native blockchain for Maker with code name New Chain. So, like placeholder of a name, calling it New chain, it will make the ecosystem more secure and efficient. After some research, I believe the Solana code base should be considered as the basis for new chain.
00:21:00.990 - 00:21:29.670, Speaker B: Okay, so this is not new information that MakerDAO wanted to put Maker on a chain that has been part of the fifth phase, the fifth and final phase of Makerdo's Endgame. Since that's not surprising. That's not new. That's not new information. People have just always assumed, oh yeah, you're going to be a layer two on Ethereum. Because MakerDAO was born on Ethereum, the MakerDAO project actually started fun fact, before the first block of Ethereum, it's always been wait, really?
00:21:29.740 - 00:21:31.222, Speaker A: Yeah, that is a fun fact.
00:21:31.276 - 00:21:42.250, Speaker B: They started making the planning MakerDAO before Ethereum even launched. And so like, crazy to think that when they talk about a new chain, they're not talking about like a layer two, especially during this Op stack fork phenomenon.
00:21:42.330 - 00:21:50.302, Speaker A: The first DeFi app I ever used and actually DeFi pilled me through using this janky version of MakerDAO back in the day.
00:21:50.356 - 00:21:51.594, Speaker B: Right. Remember peeth.
00:21:51.642 - 00:21:53.274, Speaker A: Jesus, peth.
00:21:53.322 - 00:22:42.026, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay. And then Rune just shocks the world saying we're going to use Solana as the code base, implying like, there's a lot of things that that implies, but we'll go through some of the technical details. Okay, so the purpose of the new chain is specifically to allow the ecosystem to use hard forks to gracefully recover from severe forms of governance attacks or technical failures and allows also the system to deal with the eight years of technical debt in the MakerDAO protocol. So, like, clean slate for MakerDAO new chain will contain the backend of Maker protocol and its Subdoubs. So MakerDAO Subdows, it's going from like a singular monolithic central bank plus commercial bank all in the same system. And it's breaking that out into just the central bank of MakerDAO.
00:22:42.026 - 00:23:21.738, Speaker B: The issuer of Dai and then Subdao is like its own commercial banking layer. So it's breaking these out into different DAOs, different orgs and so becoming modular. So the governance, the back end of these systems, the supporting infrastructure of this system will be hosted on new chain. All user facing products like Dai, for example, the product of MakerDAO and systems will be untouched and remain on Ethereum or its layer twos, or wherever Dai exists out in the crypto landscape. And these Dai and other MakerDAO products will be connected to new chain through advanced bridges secured by the Maker protocol called two stage gravity bridges. I don't know what these are. I'm assuming it's just a bridge.
00:23:21.738 - 00:24:01.850, Speaker B: The benefits of this is that this allows for the more advanced tokenomics of endgame, which Rune is calling neural tokenomics, which also was a topic of conversation, like neural tokenomics. What the hell is that? This will benefit from having its own new chain and then allows the ecosystem to recover as much value as possible, minimizing value leaked to mev and transaction costs. And also he says that this provides Solana mainnet access to native maker DeFi features and capital. And importantly, he says that we don't have to build it from scratch. We can just fork an open existing open source protocol where of course, like I said, the Ethereum community is like, oh yeah, you're just going to fork the Op stack. And Rune is like, no, I'm going to fork solana.
00:24:02.830 - 00:24:20.000, Speaker A: All right, so a couple of things maybe to clarify here. So this whole new chain idea, this is still many years out. And Rune kind of admits this. This is like future things. This is him saying new chain will be many years out. Its main purpose is to act as a secure and efficient back into the system. But it's many years out.
00:24:20.000 - 00:24:36.978, Speaker A: But there was the big question, of course, is Rune said the S word, right? And you know how tribal crypto is, right? And so everyone from Ethereum is like, why not the EVM, right? Are you abandoning ethereum? Just like, well, it's not only that.
00:24:37.064 - 00:24:49.594, Speaker B: It'S saying why not the EVM? But the thing, the big crux is that he's not proposing an Ethereum layer two, he is proposing a brand new layer one using the Salana code base.
00:24:49.712 - 00:25:21.650, Speaker A: And again, this is a Marquee blue chip D five been building on Ethereum since V one died in the Wool, kind of like ETH bull and is kind of saying these things. So there's the question of why not EVM, sir, this is Rune replying. EVM is still the most important when it comes to building stuff for users, since that's where the users are. But for a specialized backend for makers specific needs. It is not ideal. And solutions like Solana or something like something like, say, are a much better fit. That's what he says.
00:25:21.650 - 00:25:23.198, Speaker A: So why solana? David?
00:25:23.294 - 00:25:40.458, Speaker B: So I think this is actually a pretty legit endorsement of Solana's Tech. And I think even the tribal fighting from Ethereum versus Solana is actually not about Solana's Tech. Like Solana's tech is probably pretty strong. It, again, doesn't have technical debt. It doesn't have baggage that the EVM has.
00:25:40.624 - 00:25:43.690, Speaker A: You're talking about specifically the Solana virtual machine.
00:25:44.270 - 00:26:24.470, Speaker B: Yes, exactly. And so when there's Solana people and Ethereum people fighting, it's not over who's got the better technology. Technologies is, like, one thing that makes up a blockchain. But this statement is Rune saying, hey, the Solana Tech's good. Let's use that. And so that's the motivation for why the Solana code base. The interesting thing, and Rune does address this, is that he vetted Cosmos as an alternative, which, if you're thinking about being your own layer one and again, the reason why not an ethereum layer two? Is that even what? Rune is saying is that MakerDAO wants to be able to arbitrarily fork its own chain to recover from governance attacks or any failure of the backend.
00:26:24.470 - 00:26:50.826, Speaker B: Because Dai is considered holy in MakerDAO. It is the first class citizen of MakerDAO. It is the purpose of MakerDAO. And so anything else is secondary to MakerDAO, to Dai. And so if we need to recover governance, for example, then we can fork the MakerDAO chain without disrupting Dai. And a layer two actually doesn't give sufficient sovereignty over freedom of forking. It's still on chain governance.
00:26:50.826 - 00:27:33.582, Speaker B: And so what Rune is saying is that we want to be so incredibly sovereign that we can be maximally free to fork our chain as needed to make sure that governance is upheld by its social layer. So this is actually MakerDAO's social layer breaking free from shackles. And you would think that this is the Cosmos thesis. Just build an app chain on Cosmos because you're beholden to no one. It's interesting that Rune did evaluate Cosmos. And he says the major benefits of Cosmos its large and highly quality talented pool range of independent developer companies, huge amount of existing cases of successfully developing app chains using the Cosmos stack disadvantages. Cosmos not built around efficiency the same way Solana is.
00:27:33.582 - 00:27:49.006, Speaker B: Cosmos doesn't have a strong central foundation like Solana has. But yet, with understanding these, he still didn't say Cosmos, which is directly in violation of Cosmos's vision. It's a direct violation of the belief.
00:27:49.038 - 00:27:53.794, Speaker A: That he mean Cosmos was hoping to win this one because it's very clearly a sovereign app.
00:27:53.912 - 00:27:54.434, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:27:54.552 - 00:27:55.266, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:27:55.448 - 00:28:00.134, Speaker B: Well, okay, so he's saying, like, Cosmos, I see your vision, and no.
00:28:00.332 - 00:28:07.522, Speaker A: Would this mean all Dai is backed by collateral? And if you were using sort of new chain, you're putting your ETH in new chain.
00:28:07.586 - 00:28:07.862, Speaker B: No.
00:28:07.916 - 00:28:08.854, Speaker A: Don't you lose. No.
00:28:08.892 - 00:28:09.142, Speaker B: Okay.
00:28:09.196 - 00:28:12.970, Speaker A: So that's not what this is. Mainly for governance and kind of the back end stuff, correct?
00:28:13.040 - 00:28:40.898, Speaker B: Yeah, there is liquidity. So each subdow has its own token. And you could imagine like, some curve like pool or some uniswap liquidity pools on new chain to be the liquidity for MKR and the Subdow tokens. And because that's part of this I think it's part of this whole neural tokenomics thing. So Liquidity and mev would be on new chain while Dai and CDPs would be on Ethereum, Solana, whatever.
00:28:40.984 - 00:28:51.622, Speaker A: Well, let's get some of the community reaction then. I want your reaction and I'll kind of get mine to this. All right, so here's one data point here. Actually, a couple of hours after that.
00:28:51.676 - 00:28:58.966, Speaker B: Vitalik butyrin immediately after Rune tweets this vitalik butyrin dumps 500 MKR, all of.
00:28:58.988 - 00:29:02.450, Speaker A: His MKR tokens, that's about 600K worth.
00:29:02.620 - 00:29:05.494, Speaker B: Pretty clear statement of belief.
00:29:05.622 - 00:29:18.926, Speaker A: Swapped it for ETH. So he didn't say anything publicly. But you can look at the on chain data for maybe how he feels about this. This does seem like it's some sort of statement of Vitalik's take on did.
00:29:18.948 - 00:29:54.618, Speaker B: He did make public statements. He went into the Reflexor, not on Twitter. He went into the Rye Reflexor fork of single collateral maker Dao, but without the US. Dollar as the peg instead of it's a free floating peg. And so kind of like trying to fulfill one of the original visions of MakerDAO before it's done all its development and directional progress. And so he goes into Rye the Rye discord and says, this has made me change my mind on one chain. I think it's somewhat more okay before for the Rye community to have somewhat more activist governance than I previously thought.
00:29:54.618 - 00:30:22.914, Speaker B: Rye previously has been all about ungovernance zero governance and Vitalik's saying, hey, you guys could have a little bit more governance. Not going all the way, but like, being okay with doing more active governance to support staked ETH and ideally, intentionally accepting only non dominant forms of staked ETH. So not Lido, staked ETH other, like, rocket pool or anyone else down the long tail of staked ETH. And so he's coming into the Rye Reflexor discord and is like, hey, there's like an opportunity for you guys here.
00:30:23.112 - 00:30:36.280, Speaker A: But is he also saying implicitly with selling, last time you bought Maker MKR was April 2018, according to kind of the on chain data. So this is also a statement of, like.
00:30:38.250 - 00:30:49.878, Speaker B: He said these words, if Maker Dow is torpedoing itself in weird directions, then it makes natural sense for Ride to move somewhat closer to the category of Dow governed, real world, asset backed stable coins.
00:30:50.054 - 00:30:55.614, Speaker A: Here's another take. This one from one of the leaders of the Solana community, Anatole. What does he say?
00:30:55.652 - 00:31:10.418, Speaker B: Anatole says, Maker, considering Solana's Tech is a win for open source, it has nothing to do with Solana's main Net or Sol or ETH. I really hope people in the Solana community don't use this as a casual to attack Ethereum. Ethereum is awesome. I've got to take about this take later.
00:31:10.504 - 00:31:17.270, Speaker A: Very good. Okay, this is somebody from the Ethereum community. So this is Justin LaRue.
00:31:18.570 - 00:31:52.990, Speaker B: Justin says Rune's forum post advocates for a privately controlled app chain to, quote, use hard forks to gracefully recover from the most severe form of governance or tax or technical failure. And then Justin's take here is that this completely negates all legitimacy achieved by initially building MakerDAO on a public blockchain. What he's saying is that what happened to immutability? What happened to smart contracts? If we're just explicitly devolving back to the social layer? Well, that's TradFi, isn't it? We're taking the immutability out of governance.
00:31:53.970 - 00:31:59.822, Speaker A: Just the governance is on this kind of solana chain. It's not the immutability of kind of the Dai smart contract.
00:31:59.966 - 00:32:01.858, Speaker B: The dai preserves its immutability. Yeah.
00:32:01.944 - 00:32:04.158, Speaker A: Okay, here's another take. This one from Fumbar.
00:32:04.254 - 00:32:27.130, Speaker B: Yeah, Fumbar just kind of gives, like, the amalgamation of, I think, the average Ethereum person take. Maker we will have an over collateralized, stablecoin users. Great, Maker. We'll back it by USDC users. Wait, why? Maker? We will spend the money on Rwandan carbon credits. Users. Can I have a refund? Maker governance for neural tokenomics will live on the salana layer two.
00:32:27.130 - 00:32:27.946, Speaker B: Oh, boy.
00:32:28.048 - 00:32:45.922, Speaker A: It's just saying no one's asking for this. And these are kind of hair brained ideas, basically, is the take here? Yes. The Carbon Credits is in reference to part of Rune's post about the end game, which gets into kind of like, making dye green money and that sort of thing. Carbon credits are mentioned there.
00:32:45.976 - 00:32:53.294, Speaker B: Yeah. The strategy there is to use collateral to legitimize crypto, which I think is valid, albeit political.
00:32:53.422 - 00:32:58.838, Speaker A: All right, well, give your take, and then I'll give mine. What do you make of all this?
00:32:58.924 - 00:33:40.690, Speaker B: Okay, so my take is that I understand that this is unintuitive, but I don't think that people should immediately cast this off as an incoherent decision with regards to Maker's long term vision. I think if you understand some of the social contract that MakerDAO is incepted by, you would be able to fit this into that vision regardless of whether you think it's good or bad. Like, you're free to still consider it bad, but at least it is coherent with one of the early establishments of MakerDAO's idea of, like, hey, let's hold Dai of the highest regard. We have this emergency shutdown mechanism. Let's improve that. And so it is not totally incoherent. MakerDAO is saying that it needs even more sovereignty in its ability to fork its own chain than what an ethereum layer two can allow for.
00:33:40.690 - 00:34:29.822, Speaker B: And as maximally sovereign as an ethereum layer two can be, which is really, really sovereign. MakerDAO is saying that that's not enough. And this is a really, really big choice because it implies that social forking is more important than immutable finance, which is kind of a very core principle of crypto. And, like, we've covered, but Dai will still remain as permissionless and censorship resistance as ever on the Solana piece. This is an endorsement of Solana's Tech, but not Solana itself. When people say the name Solana, they're referring to the Solana blockchain and also the Solana Vision of a single shared monolithic state. One single state, one global state, one ecosystem, one block space, a forking of Solana's code base and spinning up a new secondary MakerDAO app specific Solana chain is antagonistic to the Solana Vision.
00:34:29.822 - 00:34:54.006, Speaker B: The Solana Product project wants to be one chain. Solana as a system is a maximalist of itself. And so a Solana copy doesn't actually fit inside of the vision. It is a bullish statement on the SVM, the Solana virtual machine, as a growing ecosystem that stands in contrast to the EVM. And that is a story for a different day. That is something that we are thinking about coordinating a podcast around. So that's my solana take on cosmos.
00:34:54.006 - 00:35:19.058, Speaker B: I think the real loser here is Cosmos. Cosmos is supposed to be the perfect glove to fit the MakerDAO hand that is waving around. And MakerDAO chose not to even join the Cosmos ecosystem. And also, I will say Ethereum is also a loser here. It doesn't get a MakerDAO op stack chain. It loses the economic activity of MakerDAO and its subdou tokens. It does retain its supply of Dai across its layer twos and layer ones.
00:35:19.058 - 00:35:42.750, Speaker B: But maybe it has a less firm grip on future Dai issuance. So Ethereum doesn't win, solana doesn't win. Maybe the SVM does get a win. Cosmos doesn't win. Who does win? Who wins here? Whether or not MakerDAO wins, I think we will have to wait and see. In theory, Dai holders win because now they are buffered from any chaotic occurrences and MKR governance. But this is still theory, not in practice.
00:35:42.750 - 00:35:57.514, Speaker B: We will have to wait and see. And then I will also finish this off by saying that this is just a proposal. This is up to the MakerDAO community. If they wanted to do something different and go in a different direction, then that is free. This is not codified. This is not set in stone. This has to be accepted.
00:35:57.514 - 00:36:01.630, Speaker B: And so I think the future is still very unwritten and we will see what plays.
00:36:01.970 - 00:36:22.920, Speaker A: Those are my takes. Good take. Good take. Do you want to hear my take? I do. I don't care about any of this. I feel like people are just bored and they're making much ado about nothing. This is a proposal from Rune for something in the future.
00:36:22.920 - 00:36:59.794, Speaker A: He may change his mind, something may or may not happen. It's basically just the governance portion. He's effectively saying we're doing this governance portion in a side chain, and rather than do an EVM, we're thinking of doing it. And I don't think it matters very much. I felt like this was just Twitter being bored and having an excuse for a little bit of tribal infighting. The other thing I'll say about Rune is he's very much a vision person, right? So big Audacious kind of visions contrarian things sometimes.
00:36:59.912 - 00:37:02.942, Speaker B: Inside of endgame is legitimately AI governance.
00:37:03.006 - 00:37:33.770, Speaker A: It's some crazy stuff like neural tokens. How much of that is actually going to come into play? I remember even if you look at kind of Rune's early ideas around what Dai would be, it was PSI at the time. It was going to be an SDR, like a Fiat, not just the dollar. It would be like mapped to the SDR, which is like a basket of different stablecoins. You're not dependent. Some of the vision just doesn't always play out in the execution. And so that's the other element.
00:37:33.770 - 00:37:47.730, Speaker A: And then I guess lastly, I would say it is interesting somewhat that maker is becoming a bit more banklike. I would say a bit more like coinbase in sort of that spectrum of pure DeFi.
00:37:48.630 - 00:37:50.830, Speaker B: Although I will say it's a small step in that direction.
00:37:50.910 - 00:38:15.046, Speaker A: I think it's a small step in that direction. The bigger step in that direction is multilateral Dai, basically, and using real world assets to sort of back your stablecoin. Right? If you want to be sort of purists and just on chain, then you do something like the original PSI or you do something like rye. And so they've already stepped in that direction. It's another step. But yeah, in general, I don't know. Sorry, I didn't mean to dismiss what you were saying, David.
00:38:15.046 - 00:38:16.294, Speaker A: I think those are all valid.
00:38:16.342 - 00:38:20.140, Speaker B: I have like 5000 words to say about almost anything. And you're like.
00:38:21.870 - 00:38:28.510, Speaker A: Well, it was a good discussion and it was certainly had on crypto Twitter this week, for what it's worth.
00:38:28.580 - 00:38:38.130, Speaker B: All that take that I just wrote out just there. I was thinking about writing that into an article and then I came back from Burning Man and I was like, oh wait, no one cares about this anymore. We've already moved.
00:38:40.790 - 00:38:54.934, Speaker A: This is interesting though, this week. So another win for Solana that you mentioned. Visa has expanded its stablecoin settlement to Solana. I do think we can consider this a win for the Solana community.
00:38:55.052 - 00:38:57.030, Speaker B: They're treating it as a win, that's for sure.
00:38:57.180 - 00:39:13.254, Speaker A: All right. This is Q Sheffield. He's been on the Bankless podcast before, of course. He is on the forefront of everything that Visa is doing with crypto and blockchain. And he says, we are excited to announce that Visa has expanded our stablecoin settlements to the Solana blockchain. Do you think this is a big deal, David?
00:39:13.302 - 00:39:35.902, Speaker B: I'm having a hard time totally understanding if it's a big deal or not. I know that the Solana community would love for you to think it's a very big deal. Visa announcing that it's going to settle USDC on Solana. Yeah, Solana is supposed to be for payments, instant transaction, blah, blah, blah. So that fits with the Solana vision. Visa formally integrating Solana is very big deal. Visa has integrated other chains before that have not seen adoption.
00:39:35.902 - 00:40:09.182, Speaker B: So other chains have come and go. So this is like the opening of the door. But whether or not people go through the door is completely up to the future and that is unwritten. I mean, Solana does have a strong base of people and developers. And so perhaps compared to other previous chains that Visa has integrated with, this one stands out amongst the crowd. But I think the Solana community is doing massive victory lapse and I think that part is premature, although it could very well play out that, yes, indeed, this does formally get adopted by the free market.
00:40:09.316 - 00:41:07.838, Speaker A: I think it's a big ish deal. I think it's a good win for the kind of the staying power of Solana, for sure. One thing I would say, when it comes to USDC or anything that is kind of like TradFi backed, basically, settlement assurances don't become that important. Right? So it's like I would always just be like, why use Ethereum if you're Visa? I mean, if you have to, I guess, settle something that is crypto native. Okay, but let's remember that any sort of stablecoin on Visa or even USDC itself is not ultimately settled on a network like Ethereum or actually like Tron is the most used USDC stablecoin network when it comes to transactions. It's actually settled in the legal system of the United States banking system because each of those dollars are just they're tokenized IOUs that are actually backed by money in an account somewhere, in a bank account somewhere. It's kind of like banked money using crypto Rails.
00:41:07.838 - 00:41:20.502, Speaker A: So, yeah, settlement will be all over the place. And I don't think settlement assurances are really prioritized by someone like Circle or USDC or Visa. So that would be one thing I would add to that.
00:41:20.556 - 00:41:36.262, Speaker B: The reason why, like kind of hesitant about this is that previously Visa integrated with Stellar Lumens. I think they had a partnership with Ripple at some point in time. Both of those just came and went. So I'm like, okay, great. Congrats on the partnership. Show me the money. Right? Like, let's see the traction.
00:41:36.406 - 00:41:41.034, Speaker A: David, you are so harsh on the Solana community. And they will be sure to point that out, my friend.
00:41:41.152 - 00:41:43.020, Speaker B: I'm sure they will. How about this?
00:41:43.470 - 00:42:08.646, Speaker A: Was this an L for base? We were just talking about a couple of weeks ago how smooth the launch of the base layer two went. And earlier today they're reporting out. This is the base Twitter account. There was a delay in block production to internal infrastructure requiring a refresh. Basically the base blockchain was offline for some period of time. How long?
00:42:08.748 - 00:42:10.246, Speaker B: 1 hour and two minutes.
00:42:10.428 - 00:42:13.942, Speaker A: Okay. Why? Do you have any takes here?
00:42:13.996 - 00:42:40.394, Speaker B: I don't know, but you can go to base status. Status base. I found this website while I was looking at this, actually kind of cool website to look at base, just like uptime stats. They just said that there was a global issue, critical issue. It stalled out. There was a major outage for 1 hour and two minutes, but overall, 99.92% uptime.
00:42:40.394 - 00:42:48.420, Speaker B: What does this mean when base goes down? It's like seven or 18 more times. Then it'll finally approach salana level of downtime. Wow.
00:42:50.550 - 00:43:08.402, Speaker A: What happens when something like base goes down? Right? So if I have assets, if I have Ether on base, which I do have some a little bit, what happens when there's an outage? I mean, all of my I guess my user interfaces are kind of dead, but do I still have the ability to withdraw funds back to Ether?
00:43:08.546 - 00:43:50.280, Speaker B: So let me compare this to the Arbitrum non outage but non finality event that happened a while ago. Like, for a while, Arbitrum blocks were still being produced, but it was not submitting state routes to the Ethereum layer one. For some reason, that happened a while ago, right? Yeah, that was a number of months ago. And so in that instance, you were still able to use Arbitrum completely uninterrupted. You were just not getting layer one settlement finality for like, I think, 90 minutes or something, and then they fixed it, and then it was fine. In that moment of time, you could have actually still bridged out of Arbitrum. Your usage of Arbitrum is totally fine.
00:43:50.280 - 00:44:13.642, Speaker B: This base blocks stopped happening. The chain stopped moving forward. So for 1 hour and two minutes, you could not do anything on base. You couldn't trade friend shares, you couldn't withdraw using the normal mechanisms. You could have done a forced exit of the inclusion that is and always is possible. The Solana community would say that, well, show me the button. And, I mean, they're right.
00:44:13.642 - 00:44:23.040, Speaker B: There is no easy button to write a script automatically to withdraw your things, even though it is technically possible, like me, as a non technical person, I'm not enabled to do that.
00:44:23.410 - 00:44:33.090, Speaker A: But if this happened for any sustained period of time, as long as there's a way to do that, there would be user interfaces that are spun up that would support those. But you're saying for base, there is a way to do that.
00:44:33.160 - 00:44:48.566, Speaker B: Right now, yes. So forced withdrawals are alive for all roll ups, all optimistic roll ups, but there's just no button for mean. The critique is like, great, it's technically possible, but if the end user isn't technically have the technical skills to do.
00:44:48.588 - 00:44:54.474, Speaker A: It, then I don't understand that, because somebody will just obviously spin up it's the open source community. Someone will spin up a button that's not that hard.
00:44:54.512 - 00:45:19.102, Speaker B: Right. There is a script that Arbitrum made that is available on their GitHub for the outside world to turn that into a UI, and they gave a grant to blockchain at Berkeley to go do that. But it hasn't been done yet. And why hasn't it been done yet? Because we haven't needed to. The free market doesn't do things that people won't pay money for. And so without a need for this button, then the button hasn't been created. It'll be created eventually.
00:45:19.102 - 00:45:21.182, Speaker B: I know layer two beat has us on their roadmap.
00:45:21.246 - 00:45:33.926, Speaker A: Well, I'm excited for a roll up to actually go down for some period of time where we get to actually test the button. I totally want to test the button. I want to see how this works. Soup to nuts. Because that is the promise of a roll up, right. Theorem. Main net didn't go down.
00:45:33.926 - 00:45:44.006, Speaker A: If a layer two goes down, okay, that's kind of crappy. But I have the ability to withdraw my funds. That is the entire purpose of a roll up. So I want to see that soup to nuts confirmed sometime.
00:45:44.198 - 00:45:45.126, Speaker B: Should we have a roll?
00:45:45.158 - 00:45:45.926, Speaker A: I'm hoping for an outage.
00:45:45.958 - 00:45:46.886, Speaker B: Do a fire drill.
00:45:46.998 - 00:45:48.822, Speaker A: Yeah, we should do a fire drill.
00:45:48.886 - 00:45:50.502, Speaker B: That's a great layer to a fire drill.
00:45:50.566 - 00:45:51.818, Speaker A: Yeah. No one's going to want to no.
00:45:51.824 - 00:45:58.090, Speaker B: One'S going to want optimism is be like Arbitrum, you do it, and arbitram is going to be like ZK. Sync. You do it and zkync.
00:45:58.170 - 00:46:16.726, Speaker A: If any roll up listening is willing to do a fire drill, we will broadcast it live on, see if it works. All right. Well, this was great news this week, David. I saw this in the back of the tornado cash. Everything else happening in the court system, developers getting arrested, this is a win for DeFi. What are we looking at here?
00:46:16.828 - 00:46:39.974, Speaker B: Court sides with Uniswap over class action lawsuit. So Southern District of New York Judge Catherine Polk, the judge who's also in charge of the Coinbase case, has thrown out a class action lawsuit against Uniswap, ruling that software uniswap cannot be held accountable for the losses of its users for the damages of third parties. Wow. Obviously.
00:46:40.112 - 00:46:40.960, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:46:41.650 - 00:47:02.978, Speaker B: Wow. So this original complaint was filed last year that alleged that Uniswap founder Hayden Adams, andreessen Horowitz, and Paradigm, all Uniswap investors were responsible for, quote, rampant fraud on the exchange and pushed for Uniswap to register with the financial industry regulatory authority. This is an Onion article, bro.
00:47:03.064 - 00:47:07.438, Speaker A: Who are the plaintiffs here? Who's pressing the charges? Just random names here, I guess.
00:47:07.464 - 00:47:12.694, Speaker B: Uniswap users, class action lawsuit. Yeah. Everyone's. Yeah, of course.
00:47:12.732 - 00:47:15.714, Speaker A: Targeting where the money is, right? So you get the VCs and the founder.
00:47:15.762 - 00:47:29.898, Speaker B: Makes sense. So the judge stated, due to the protocol's decentralized nature, the identities of these scam token issuers are basically unknown and unknowable, leaving plaintiffs with an identifiable injury, but no identifiable wait, wait.
00:47:29.984 - 00:47:50.180, Speaker A: The complaint was that there are scam tokens on Uniswap, and I went and I bought one, and it's your fault that I went and I bought Uniswap's fault. It's uniswap's fault. And all of the people being charged here that I went and made a stupid financial decision and bought a token that represented a dog, and it dropped to zero.
00:47:51.590 - 00:47:52.818, Speaker B: Yes, you are correct.
00:47:52.904 - 00:47:53.298, Speaker A: Okay.
00:47:53.384 - 00:48:12.838, Speaker B: The plaintiffs launched the suit hoping that this court might overlook the fact that the current state of crypto regulation leaves them without recourse, but that does not allow them to blame uniswap for their injury. Yeah, the topic of responsibility just goes so deep in crypto, and whoever's doing this suing is just trying to abscond from responsibility.
00:48:12.934 - 00:48:13.654, Speaker A: Oh, totally.
00:48:13.702 - 00:48:14.106, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:48:14.208 - 00:48:27.982, Speaker A: Okay. So what does Hayden say here? Huge win. Long live DeFi. One longtime fear of mine has been bad legal interpretation. He says of our complex technical industry, it's highly motivating to see US. Courts hold up arguments. I felt deeply for years.
00:48:27.982 - 00:48:53.240, Speaker A: Here's some of the best, most based comments from the court case. This quote it defies logic that a drafter of computer code underlying a particular software platform could be liable for a third party's misuse of the platform. As discussed, smart contracts are self executing, self enforcing code. Wow. David. This judge gets it again. Same judge on the coinbase case, which seems to be good news.
00:48:53.240 - 00:49:39.050, Speaker A: They the plaintiffs now sue the defendants, hoping that this court might overlook the fact that the current state of cryptocurrency regulation leaves them without recourse, saying something we've been saying for a very long time, like there is no coherent cryptocurrency regulation. This one, too. The court declines to stretch the federal securities laws to cover the conduct alleged and concludes that the plaintiff's concerns are better addressed to congress than to this court. The court's saying we're not going to decide, we're not going to stretch securities law to meet the plaintiff's request here. That's for congress to decide. That totally makes sense, too. No plaintiff would sue the New York stock exchange, or Nasdaq, for tweeting that its exchange was a safe place to trade after that plaintiff had lost money due to an issuer's.
00:49:39.050 - 00:49:57.882, Speaker A: Fraudulent schemes. Exactly. So somebody buys a stock on the Nasdaq, and it drops to zero, and it's fraudulent. You're not going to sue the Nasdaq for that anyway. It goes on. A bunch of good news, a bunch of common sense being injected through these court cases, and you love to see it. This is precedent being set.
00:49:58.016 - 00:50:12.894, Speaker B: It is, like, moderately frustrating that stuff like statements like this that you and I were saying, in 2019, 2020, you can't sue software, and then we actually have to go to court over. That very obvious. Like, to the end where we win. Yeah.
00:50:12.932 - 00:50:17.598, Speaker A: Well, it feels good. I mean, somebody talking some common sense. David, speaking of common sense, what do we have coming up next?
00:50:17.684 - 00:50:44.266, Speaker B: Coming up next, a firm with $5 trillion asset under management releases an investment thesis for ether. Give me a hot and bother heard Kevin owalki coming back to Gitcoin. We're going to talk about this. And Justin bieber releases a 2015 hit as an NFT and will share streaming revenue with its holders. I kind of teased the punchline there, but we're going to talk about all that, but first I wanted to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible, especially MetaMask and MetaMask Portfolio to help you prepare for the bull market incoming, hopefully. Knock on wood. Let's go hear from them right now.
00:50:44.266 - 00:51:22.262, Speaker B: MetaMask Portfolio is your one stop shop to manage your crypto assets and to tap into DeFi all in one place. And the most important part of that experience? Buying crypto. Obviously, MetaMask Portfolio's buy feature enables you to purchase crypto easily without going through centralized exchanges. Designed with you in mind, you can fund your wallet directly in just a few clicks with convenience and simplicity. What happens when you press the buy button? Rather than being limited to a single payment provider, MetaMask brings together a bunch of vetted trustworthy providers to present you with customized quotes for your crypto purchase. Once you've funded your wallet, you'll be able to plug into DeFi with all the money verbs like swapping, bridging and staking. But first things first you need skin in the game.
00:51:22.262 - 00:52:11.154, Speaker B: Head over to MetaMask IO Slash Portfolio to buy crypto the easy way. Are you planning to launch a token? Is your token already live? And are you granting your employees and contractors vesting token awards? And are you trying to figure out how to take care of taxable events for your team? Toku makes implementing a global token incentive award simple. With Toku, you will get unmatched legal and tax support. To grant and administer your global team's tokens. Toku will help you navigate across the lifecycle of your token, from easy to use pre launch token grant award templates to managing post cliff taxable events with payroll for legal, finance and HR teams. It's a huge, complex task to have to comply with labor laws, payroll and tax obligations, tax reporting and crypto regulations in every country that you employ someone. It's difficult, time consuming, manual and costly, and it's drawing more attention from global regulators and governments.
00:52:11.154 - 00:52:23.818, Speaker B: Toku makes it simple for leading companies in the Space protocol Labs, Hedera, Gitcoin and many more. So if you want some help navigating the complex world of token compliance, go to Toku.com Slash bankless or click the link in the description below.
00:52:23.904 - 00:52:31.062, Speaker A: Quick update on the tornado cash developer who was arrested now two weeks ago, Roman Storm. He pled not guilty. Not guilty.
00:52:31.126 - 00:52:55.154, Speaker B: This doesn't really come as a surprise. I 100% understand that Roman Storm doesn't think he's guilty. I also think he's not guilty. And so this is just the next step and what's probably going to be a long court battle as well. One of the themes of this episode, I would say, is crypto is winning in the courts. We had one last week and the week before. Like Grayscale, Gary Gensler, some other class action lawsuits are getting walked back.
00:52:55.154 - 00:53:18.426, Speaker B: So a recent theme is that crypto has taken some dubs in the legal world. I wouldn't want to say that we are winning against the SEC, we're winning against the CFTC, we're winning against stupid class action, ambulance chasing lawyers. This case is not a big test. This is the Department of justice. These are the biggest people.
00:53:18.608 - 00:53:30.234, Speaker A: It's also financial surveillance crimes. It also gets into kind of national defense, reinvoke North Korea. And so this is a different type of battle. Some have called this kind of the final boss. This feels a little bit more like the final boss.
00:53:30.282 - 00:53:37.202, Speaker B: So we'll see how we're stacking up some dubs. But it doesn't mean that this one is just going to follow suit. This is going to be a hard.
00:53:37.256 - 00:53:53.590, Speaker A: This one seems like the most obvious open source developer, I mean, privacy code. Anyway, we'll be covering this one closely. You guys can count on that. Polygon just launched their SuperNet kit. David, this sounds a lot like Superchains from Optimism. What is this launch exactly?
00:53:53.660 - 00:54:25.714, Speaker B: What you just said is their chain development kit, which I mean is actually the right name for these things, chain development kits. Like, it's not an SDK, but for a chain. So Polygon has launched supernets. Optimism has superchain, zksync has the ZK stack Hyperchains, arbitram has orbits, polygon has supernets. And now the SuperNet kit is out and about. An important point of difference between Optimism, superchain or this is a ZKE EVM. So this is going head to head with ZK, Sync and Starkware, which released their superchain kit not too long ago.
00:54:25.832 - 00:54:47.634, Speaker A: So it allows anyone to spin up a chain. It's a ZK roll up type chain and it's all connected through Polygon technology, basically. So this is their version of a superchain as the SuperNet david Rollup's on the move this week. This notice from Arbitrum as well. I was really looking forward to this. This is for the devs. This one's for the devs, the release of Stylus.
00:54:47.634 - 00:54:48.626, Speaker A: What is stylus?
00:54:48.738 - 00:55:00.874, Speaker B: Stylus is a coding environment, I think is that the right word? That is not based on Solidity, but based on WASM WebAssembly, which is like, I would say, the status quo for devs out there to build stuff like.
00:55:00.912 - 00:55:02.958, Speaker A: Web two devs, web two devs all build against.
00:55:03.044 - 00:55:17.540, Speaker B: So we're taking web two dev infrastructure and popping out Solidity and popping in whatever devs want to choose to build on. So it just opens up a larger supply of developers to build on Arbitrum. And that's great.
00:55:17.990 - 00:55:25.506, Speaker A: So basically the value proposition is rather than learning this esoteric crypto web3 thing called the EVM, you just bring.
00:55:25.608 - 00:55:29.122, Speaker B: Your existing no, it's still the EVM.
00:55:29.266 - 00:55:35.958, Speaker A: Yeah, but basically you get to use kind of whatever coding language compiles to Waslam, which is not Solidity, basically.
00:55:36.044 - 00:55:43.226, Speaker B: So it's solidity, right? Solidity, I mean, it's Esoteric, but it's also pretty close to JavaScript, which is pretty common. But other people like C Plus plus.
00:55:43.328 - 00:55:52.282, Speaker A: David and I talking about like, yeah, Solidity is easy. Just learn it. Come on. It's so easy. It's very. Cool. And the other thing, this has been a promise for a while.
00:55:52.282 - 00:56:10.066, Speaker A: Do you remember back in god, I feel like a grandpa crypto here. Back in 2019, we're talking about deploying WASM on the EVM. There was like an EF team working on this. Anyway, the layer two s are the ones who brought across the finish line and actually built it up, which is great to see here.
00:56:10.168 - 00:56:25.942, Speaker B: So something I don't understand about how this works, but Rachel from Arbitrum says arbitram stylus flashes fees across four categories. Compute is ten to 100 times cheaper, memory is 100 to 500 times cheaper. And other cheap things.
00:56:25.996 - 00:56:27.414, Speaker A: Getting cheap things.
00:56:27.452 - 00:56:31.414, Speaker B: Yeah. I don't know how that works, but cool. Oh, damn. We need to do an episode on this.
00:56:31.612 - 00:56:37.338, Speaker A: Yeah, it's getting cheaper. It's getting more optimized. What is StarkNet doing? They're doing some things too.
00:56:37.424 - 00:56:54.986, Speaker B: Starkware. StarkNet Stone prover is now open source. So a prover is a very important piece of ZK roll ups. You need to prove zero knowledge proofs. You have to prove them. That's part of completing the circuit. And now Starkware's Stone prover is now open source.
00:56:54.986 - 00:57:03.054, Speaker B: So this is like ZK syncs boujam or polygon's plonky two. This is Starkware's stone and it's now open source.
00:57:03.102 - 00:57:09.058, Speaker A: It's good. They're all going open source. Love to see it. Rocket Pool is launching some new stuff. What do they got on the menu?
00:57:09.154 - 00:57:34.666, Speaker B: This whole thing is a very long post. Jasper put a thread together, but TLDR, it's a big architecture redesign. There's ten X scalability and on chain governance, birth of Rocket Pool layer twos. There's a bonding curve for the lower ETH rocket Pool nodes. I sadly didn't have enough time to fully dive down into this. I apologize to the Rocket Pool community, but Jasper put a Tweet thread together that summarizes all of this. It's a big update.
00:57:34.666 - 00:57:35.658, Speaker B: It's a very big update.
00:57:35.754 - 00:57:55.294, Speaker A: David, Kevin Owaki is now returning to Gitcoin. This is his announcement. He says, I'm excited to announce my plans to return to Gitcoin. The Dao has made some solid strides in decentralizing things. At the same time, I think some of the community's criticism of Gitcoin is valid. So he's coming back to help them turn a corner together. I think that is bullish for Gitcoin.
00:57:55.294 - 00:58:07.906, Speaker A: Sometimes you need that leadership injected back in. And of know Kevin has great takes on what public goods means and how Gitcoin can transform the world. So I'm bullish on that. I imagine you are as very, very bigly.
00:58:07.938 - 00:58:15.990, Speaker B: Yeah, we love the Kevin Owaki. He's also going to be at permissionless giving a talk. One of my favorite talks that he's going to update. And also I'm sure he's going to talk about his return to Gitcoin as well.
00:58:16.140 - 00:58:25.310, Speaker A: All right, I've been waiting for this the entire podcast. Tell me about the beebs. Justin Bieber. He's got an NFT. And you said you were a fan. You didn't say the NFT drop.
00:58:26.770 - 00:58:28.266, Speaker B: I'm a fan of the drop mechanism.
00:58:28.298 - 00:58:29.210, Speaker A: You're not a fan of Biebs.
00:58:29.290 - 00:58:31.450, Speaker B: You said you were an Ambivalent. Couple songs.
00:58:31.530 - 00:58:31.918, Speaker A: Okay.
00:58:32.004 - 00:58:42.018, Speaker B: The justin bieber kanye good friday, christmas in harlem song. Oof, he kills it. That's some early bieber. That's actually a Bieber deep cut. And I don't really know if I like mainstream people.
00:58:42.104 - 00:58:46.578, Speaker A: Yeah, I was like, I hadn't heard of that. Okay, so tell me about the NFT, though. That's what the crypto people want to hear.
00:58:46.664 - 00:59:08.166, Speaker B: Yeah. So his song, A company from 2015 is being tokenized. I do not know this song. 2000 NFTs, $28 each. One of the reasons why I like this is like that's a pretty modest price. It's actually the real price is zero 117. So all of these got Minted out? All 2000 of them max per user.
00:59:08.166 - 00:59:35.474, Speaker B: Ten. So Justin Bieber made $56,000, which, for what he could do, I think is completely modest and respectable. Every single NFT individually receives zero, zero 5% of royalties when company is streamed. And so if this is ever played on Spotify or makes money wherever music makes money these days, you as a single NFT owner, you get 5%.
00:59:35.512 - 00:59:40.150, Speaker A: So it's a cash flowing asset. It's a capital asset, then you might say.
00:59:40.220 - 00:59:41.480, Speaker B: Does that make it a security?
00:59:42.010 - 00:59:49.906, Speaker A: Well, I'm sure they've worked around that. Oh, actually, I'm not sure. US. Citizens cannot access Minting royalty claims due to regulatory.
00:59:50.018 - 01:00:03.706, Speaker B: US citizens were barred from oh, man. Well, good thing. I love how they just explicitly say, due to regulatory. Like, that's actually a big step forward from just, like, banning it ways. Like Gary Gensler is not letting you do.
01:00:03.808 - 01:00:09.706, Speaker A: Yeah, we should just put his picture in front and it's just be like, this man does not want you to have this NFT.
01:00:09.818 - 01:00:15.070, Speaker B: Instead of saying, if you try and click the button and Gary Gensler's face just comes up and stop right there.
01:00:15.140 - 01:00:32.546, Speaker A: Yeah, he's pointing his finger at you, you can't have it. That's really what's happening here. That's exactly what's happening. Okay, we've got some good news, I think, coming out of Fidelity as well. This was my Tweet here. The world's third largest asset firm with $4.2 trillion in assets just released.
01:00:32.546 - 01:00:47.142, Speaker A: This is it. This is what they called the paper. Investment thesis for Ethereum. Here are some of the major sections. ETH as an aspiring money, ETH as a store of value. ETH as a yield bearing asset. The company is Fidelity.
01:00:47.142 - 01:01:02.954, Speaker A: So, second largest assets under management firm in existence. And they've got their ethereum investment thesis. I skimmed through this, David. It's pretty good. Gotta say. There are some references to the ultrasound Money website. Believe it or not, multiple references.
01:01:02.954 - 01:01:13.940, Speaker A: I'm almost surprised they didn't use Bankless as a source for some of this, but I saw some of our energy inside of these narratives. For sure.
01:01:14.710 - 01:01:16.398, Speaker B: Ryan's trying to collect his receipts.
01:01:16.494 - 01:01:47.582, Speaker A: No, I mean, I'm not saying that this was us, but kind of was us. Anyway, can ETH be considered a money the same as bitcoin? Oh, I should say some context, too. Fidelity. For a very long time, they've been involved in crypto, but specifically bitcoin. And they've almost been, like a bitcoin heavy. I wouldn't say maximalist, but a bitcoin heavy shop. And so also, seeing Fidelity see the light on Ether as a store of value asset is great to see as well.
01:01:47.582 - 01:02:17.238, Speaker A: So they get a lot of it right. I would have some quibbles with some of what they said, but let me give you some takes here. Ether technically has unlimited supply parameters, which are kept within a range depending on the number of validators and burn. That is correct. It seems unlikely that any other digital asset could improve upon bitcoin as a monetary good, because bitcoin is viewed by some as the most secure, decentralized, sound digital money. So that's another quote from it. So you can see they're still pretty bullish on the bitcoin side of things.
01:02:17.238 - 01:02:33.226, Speaker A: Nonetheless, this is a fantastic report, and you can see them kind of gearing up, maybe for future ETFs, future financial products around Ethereum as well. David we've invited them on the show, actually. So they're going to come on Bankless and talk about this report with us.
01:02:33.328 - 01:02:35.310, Speaker B: And why we were not cited.
01:02:36.450 - 01:02:40.190, Speaker A: If they ever listened to the ultrasound money episode, they know anything.
01:02:40.340 - 01:02:41.790, Speaker B: Where do you get your information?
01:02:41.940 - 01:03:04.038, Speaker A: Look, I think this is bullish. And, you know, when I saw this, it was for me, it was, wow, how things have changed from the last bull cycle, 2018, 2019. We were just, like, fighting for the existence of this asset. Now we've got major financial institutions writing papers on it and getting it like 80% to 90%. Right. From my perspective, this is just great.
01:03:04.124 - 01:03:10.322, Speaker B: Ether ETF fuel. Hey, why are you suggesting I buy this Ether ETF thing?
01:03:10.396 - 01:03:11.562, Speaker A: Go read the fidelity report.
01:03:11.616 - 01:03:16.906, Speaker B: Oh, here's a report from Fidelity. Here you go. Go read this. Go learn about ultrasound money or go.
01:03:16.928 - 01:03:27.450, Speaker A: Listen to the Bankless podcast. This next thing is maybe a sign of things to come. A little bit worried about it. Privacy coins are now outlawed and delisted from exchanges.
01:03:27.610 - 01:03:30.810, Speaker B: This is a Binance exchange exchange in Belgium.
01:03:30.890 - 01:03:33.578, Speaker A: The country is Belgium of it starts.
01:03:33.594 - 01:03:35.390, Speaker B: In Belgium, though, and it goes out from there.
01:03:35.460 - 01:03:48.882, Speaker A: Yeah. Monero. Remember monero mobile coin zen. I don't see Zcash, but no privacy coins. Can't buy privacy coins. This worries me. David yes.
01:03:48.882 - 01:03:50.534, Speaker A: I hope this is not a sign of things to come.
01:03:50.572 - 01:04:01.898, Speaker B: This is a war on privacy. That's an encroachment. I mean, Monero inside of Belgium on Binance is very far away, but it starts there and it doesn't stop until we fight him.
01:04:01.984 - 01:04:10.650, Speaker A: Yep. David, some cool things coming out of MetaMask. This week. They shipped a sell feature. Do you see this inside of the MetaMask portfolio?
01:04:11.710 - 01:04:12.314, Speaker B: Only buy.
01:04:12.352 - 01:04:13.374, Speaker A: Don't you want the option?
01:04:13.492 - 01:04:14.286, Speaker B: Only buy.
01:04:14.388 - 01:04:17.390, Speaker A: Well, you got to sell at some point, don't you? No, you don't.
01:04:18.130 - 01:04:23.382, Speaker B: I mean, I've definitely hit the sell button in a meaningful capacity.
01:04:23.546 - 01:04:29.954, Speaker A: Anyway, what's cool about the sell button in MetaMask portfolio is you can actually sell back to your bank account. Oh.
01:04:29.992 - 01:04:31.860, Speaker B: Regionally? Not supported yet. Great.
01:04:32.230 - 01:04:34.446, Speaker A: Well, United States Minor outlying islands.
01:04:34.478 - 01:04:37.858, Speaker B: I can just what VPN are you on, bro?
01:04:38.024 - 01:04:50.540, Speaker A: I'm not telling you. Tell me all my secrets here. Yeah. So you could pick your state and you can exit directly to a bank account if you still have one of those. If you're a hypocrite, why would and you still have a bank account.
01:04:51.630 - 01:05:00.300, Speaker B: Can't imagine I wouldn't know. My 82 year old landlord takes USDC anyway. Pretty cool release. He doesn't do that.
01:05:00.750 - 01:05:01.482, Speaker A: I know that.
01:05:01.536 - 01:05:03.050, Speaker B: Neither does the IRS.
01:05:04.110 - 01:05:06.926, Speaker A: Pretty cool release from MetaMask. David, what else we got coming up?
01:05:07.028 - 01:05:20.318, Speaker B: Coming up next, we got some questions from the nation. Why don't we ever talk about polkadot? Why don't we talk about polkadot? Ryan we're going to talk about polkadot for the first time, and it's going to be about why we don't talk about it. How is Burning Man? It's a question that somebody is asking.
01:05:20.404 - 01:05:21.598, Speaker A: Yeah, I want to ask you that.
01:05:21.684 - 01:05:44.326, Speaker B: And if you are still in crypto and you haven't lost your private keys, you are very well positioned for the next decade, according to a take who might be given by this guy here, ryan Sean Adams. So all of that and more. But first, a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible. You know Uniswap, it's the world's largest decentralized exchange with over $1.4 trillion in trading volume. You know this because we talk about it endlessly on Bakelists. It's uniswap.
01:05:44.326 - 01:06:15.266, Speaker B: But Uniswap is becoming so much more. Uniswap Labs just released the Uniswap mobile wallet for iOS, the newest, easiest way to trade tokens on the go. With a Uniswap wallet, you can easily create or import a new wallet, buy crypto on any available exchange with your debit card with extremely low fiat onramp fees. And you can seamlessly swap on main net, polygon, arbitram and optimism. On the Uniswap mobile wallet, you can store and display your beautiful NFTs. And you can also explore Web Three with the inapp search features, market leaderboards and price jars. Or use Wallet Connect to connect to any web.
01:06:15.266 - 01:06:42.270, Speaker B: Three application. So you can now go directly to DFI with the Uniswap mobile wallet safe, simple custody from the most trusted team in DFI. Download the Uniswap wallet today on iOS, there is a link in the show notes. Arbitrum is accelerating the Web Three landscape with a suite of secure ethereum scaling solutions. Hundreds of projects have already deployed on Arbitrum One. With flourishing DFI and NFT ecosystems, Arbitrum Nova is quickly becoming a Web Three gaming hub. And social DApps like Reddit are also calling Arbitrum home.
01:06:42.270 - 01:07:23.482, Speaker B: And now Arbitrum Orbit allows you to use Arbitrum's secure scaling technology to build your own layer three, giving you access to interoperable customizable permissions with dedicated throughput whether you are a developer, enterprise, or user, Arbitrum orbit lets you take your project to new heights.

So visit Arbitrum IO, where you can join the community, dive into the developer docs, bridge your assets, and start building your first app with Arbitrum experience. Web three development the way it was always meant to be secure, fast, cheap, and friction free.
01:07:23.616 - 01:08:00.070, Speaker A: Questions from the nation this week. This one from cryptoroo MD. It goes on thanks us for what we're doing and asks the question, why don't we have a bullcase for polka? Dot? It's really similar as the cosmos hub thesis and as fast as solana. I can't see any money theory for dot, but I think it's a good competitor. This is a related question as well, asking us to bring on polkadot and moonbeam. So some people in the bankless community are asking about polkadot. Maybe the meta question here, though, is why haven't we done a big episode on polkadot? Or why don't we talk about it as much? What's your answer to that, David?
01:08:00.410 - 01:08:28.378, Speaker B: There's many different reasons for this. I would say first and foremost is that polkadot occupies this space that other chains also occupy. And in my opinion, polkadot kind of fills the worst of both worlds space, not the best of both world space. So it's kind of like a hybrid between ethereum and cosmos. And I actually kind of just think you should just pick one. Either do ethereum or do cosmos. But occupying the middle space, I think you kind of get the worst of both worlds.
01:08:28.378 - 01:09:08.314, Speaker B: Like dot isn't money. They correctly identified that Gavin Wood, like, I wouldn't call him an aligned actor. He raised a bunch of money with parity. They did an ethereum client, and then they forked off, and it all felt very mercenary and kind of leveraged ethereum for his own means. I don't exactly enjoy the genesis story of polkadot, and overall, I haven't seen too much real meaningful adoption in polkadot. I could have a blind spot. There have been, like, a handful of times of bankless citizens in our discord saying, hey, I'd like to do an episode on why? Why have you guys done one? Granted, we did schedule an episode with Gavin wood to do this episode, and then he canceled on us.
01:09:08.352 - 01:09:24.074, Speaker A: Well, if he heard you talking just now, we'll never get Gavin wood on now, because the reason he canceled was actually we were informed it was because some past things I had said my twitter timeline against literally my shit is tame, dude.
01:09:24.122 - 01:09:34.814, Speaker B: Yeah, it was very tame. Tweets. So some PR manager from the polkadot ecosystem went through Ryan's tweets and was like, hey, you tweeted this about polkadot and we don't like it. And it was like it wasn't glowing.
01:09:34.862 - 01:09:36.980, Speaker A: But it was money or something.
01:09:39.110 - 01:09:43.670, Speaker B: Then they wanted to throw us some other polka dot person like, no, we want Gavin Wood.
01:09:44.090 - 01:09:45.554, Speaker A: I would still love to do that episode.
01:09:45.602 - 01:09:46.406, Speaker B: I'd still do it.
01:09:46.508 - 01:09:52.982, Speaker A: I think you're right, David. A couple things I would say on this too. We can't cover everything.
01:09:53.116 - 01:09:55.720, Speaker B: So we have to sort of choose crypto so big.
01:09:56.570 - 01:10:05.902, Speaker A: So it could be we're missing huge things in the polkadot community. And the way it would bubble up and surface to our attention is if there were use cases, if there were apps, if there was things being built.
01:10:05.956 - 01:10:10.094, Speaker B: And I don't know, why would I put money on polkadot? I don't know what I would do there.
01:10:10.132 - 01:10:18.478, Speaker A: I know there are some apps. So people are going to say like, oh, but haven't you tried this, this and this? They just haven't gotten big enough. Relative the other things that are what's.
01:10:18.494 - 01:10:20.914, Speaker B: The biggest stable Conan polkadot? I have no idea.
01:10:21.032 - 01:10:27.300, Speaker A: But if anyone's listening has the ability, would love to do a show with Gavin Wood if they still welcome to. Come on.
01:10:27.670 - 01:10:28.886, Speaker B: Always has been welcome.
01:10:28.988 - 01:10:36.406, Speaker A: Yeah. David. How was Burning Man? This is a question from a bankless citizen. I'm going to ask it to you, too. How was Burning Man?
01:10:36.508 - 01:10:41.494, Speaker B: Burning man was great, bro. I had a ton of you.
01:10:41.532 - 01:10:42.506, Speaker A: This is you and your dad, right?
01:10:42.528 - 01:10:48.854, Speaker B: This is me and my father. Yeah. Not only is that me and my father, but that is my grandfather, his dad's navy jacket.
01:10:48.982 - 01:10:49.418, Speaker A: Wow.
01:10:49.504 - 01:10:52.106, Speaker B: I actually never met my grandfather, so it's kind of cool.
01:10:52.288 - 01:10:53.306, Speaker A: That's very cool.
01:10:53.408 - 01:11:13.454, Speaker B: Yeah. So there's like a meme of Burning Man people saying like, you have to go to Burning Man. And then I go to Burning Man. It takes me a couple of days, but I'm like running around the playa on my Led bicycle with LEDs all over my jacket because that's what you do on the playa. And I'm seeing everyone else run around the playa. The playa is the desert. It's like this very flat, salt flat.
01:11:13.454 - 01:11:18.882, Speaker B: And I'm like, okay, I get it. There's like a little bit of an AHA moment of Burning Man.
01:11:18.936 - 01:11:19.860, Speaker A: What is it?
01:11:20.550 - 01:12:01.566, Speaker B: I'm so glad you asked. I cannot explain it to you in such a brief amount of time because we have a podcast that we need to get to in 20 minutes. However, I did write a 5000 word article that is going out on the bankless newsletter yesterday from the time of recording, today Thursday, and also will be out on the podcast feed. The parallels, the short TLDR, the pitch for why you should go read or listen to that is that Burning Man, like crypto is a rabbit hole. And when you go down the burning rabbit hole at the very bottom, you actually poke out the other side into the crypto rabbit hole. Like these things connect very deeply. These are big social movements, and they are alternative social platforms for scaling certain cultures.
01:12:01.566 - 01:12:23.834, Speaker B: And Burning Man is doing its job and crypto is doing its job. And these things are actually parallel. They're parallel. And so I'll say if one of these movements succeeds either Burning Man or crypto, it actually is conducive to the other. So this is like while I don't expect people to become Burning Men, people burners. It is worthy to understand what powers Burning Man. Burning man.
01:12:23.834 - 01:12:45.986, Speaker B: Started in 1987. In the first few, like five years, it doubled in size. And then it's been growing like five to 15% year over year growth for like almost 30 years. Bro why? What power is it? What powers, burning man? Where does this growth come from, let alone the hundreds of regional events that happen all over the world? It is a decentralized social movement that wants to change the world.
01:12:46.088 - 01:13:12.346, Speaker A: I got to admit, what's interesting about this is you kind of talking about Burning Man evangelizing for it and talking about your excitement for it. This probably is what crypto sounds like to people who aren't in crab crypto. Because you're saying it. You're saying these words, and I'm just like I just don't get it because I haven't experienced it. I haven't read your piece. I haven't done any research. So I have these media driven narrative impressions of what Burning Man is.
01:13:12.346 - 01:13:21.370, Speaker A: And I think there's this impression of what Burning Man is right now, which is like, oh, it's a place where Silicon Valley bros go and just do mushrooms.
01:13:22.430 - 01:13:25.374, Speaker B: That's not so like and it's just.
01:13:25.412 - 01:13:32.958, Speaker A: Kind of weird hippie culture. And then what they're going to do is once they do visit this thing, they'll come back and tell you how amazing it is.
01:13:33.044 - 01:13:33.534, Speaker B: Exactly.
01:13:33.652 - 01:13:36.260, Speaker A: Yeah, that's what you're doing right now.
01:13:37.910 - 01:13:40.702, Speaker B: I think I have good writing skills. I think if you read my article.
01:13:40.766 - 01:13:41.986, Speaker A: I will think it's one of the.
01:13:42.008 - 01:13:53.910, Speaker B: Best ways to accept Burning Man, the Burning Man vision for what it is. And then so the article is titled burning man through the Crypto Lens. So if you are a crypto person, you will be able to understand Burning Man at a very deep level.
01:13:53.980 - 01:14:22.922, Speaker A: Well, it's also interesting because now I get to feel what a normie feels like when they hear about crypto. Invited to a bankless podcast. All right, we got some takes of the week. David, this first one is from Vance Spencer regarding a socket investment that was a big investment that they made this week. He says, regarding socket, I continue to believe that the way the market thinks about L2 S is wrong in the medium term. Probably doesn't matter where your contracts are deployed or if you have your own L two, if the contracts are networked. And socket is how to get those connected.
01:14:22.922 - 01:14:55.546, Speaker A: Just some background. Socket is kind of like an interoperability bridge type tech connect all the L two S, that sort of thing. Vance goes on said another way, the interop protocols will accrue more value than the L two S themselves over the longer term, especially if there are lot or too many L two chains. This investment in socket is a view on the likely fragmentation of contracts over too many chains and the value of networking them. Okay, so one thing to say is vance, of course, is a VC. This is a bag that he bought. So he's of course excited about socket and what it's doing.
01:14:55.648 - 01:14:57.878, Speaker B: But we are also investors in socket.
01:14:57.974 - 01:15:26.130, Speaker A: That's true. Yes, angel investors. But I also think that this is an interesting take, which is very contrary to something that I believe, which is that actually L two super chains will be the main value accrual mechanism of this new frontier that we're building out in crypto. Vance is saying that's not true. It's actually the interop protocols themselves. It's like the sockets and the Bridging tech layer themselves. What do you think about this?
01:15:26.280 - 01:15:54.874, Speaker B: I think that there's likely a tension between these two things. So you have the optimism, superchain, you have all the superchains. Like, I just list them all like CK Sync, blah, blah, blah. Everyone's doing a super chain and there's going to be individual singular one off chains as well. So not only are there perhaps a plethora of superchains, but they also have like what about Aztec? That is going to be a single chain. What about all the other single specific chains, like Starkware? StarkNet. So in addition to the superchains, there's also individual chains.
01:15:54.874 - 01:16:09.218, Speaker B: And so while I totally agree that the growth of superchains will be how interoperability happens, you're just relevating the problem to one dimension higher and it's still the same problem of interoperability between superchains and independent chains. There's a tension between these two things.
01:16:09.384 - 01:16:23.734, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess my take is, again, you're saying a little bit of column a little bit column B. My take though is superchains will be like power law winners and they within the superchains will kind of solve the interoperability problem themselves. I don't think there's going to be.
01:16:23.772 - 01:16:34.422, Speaker B: Like what that means, though, is that there's actually going to be one super chain that is a power law winner. Because if there's multiple super chain winners, then I think we get their interoperability.
01:16:34.486 - 01:16:50.160, Speaker A: I think we get like three to four big economic zones similar to how we have big economic zones today. We have kind of like the Western Europe and America economic zone. We have China, Asia Economic Zone. Anyway, who knows, though? He could be right.
01:16:51.170 - 01:16:59.346, Speaker B: I do think that between this socket thesis playing out, there are other socket alternative competitors out there. So there's more than this one.
01:16:59.528 - 01:17:03.314, Speaker A: Like layer zero would be one. I mean, there's a lot of big valuation ones.
01:17:03.432 - 01:17:29.770, Speaker B: LiFi Leafy is one as well. Maybe chainlink CCIP, maybe we'll do a show on that. But what was I going to say? Oh, yeah. So one of the big things that the Salana people will pound their chest about is like single shared state because of the composability. This is like ethereum fracturing into many, many layer twos to achieve scale and decentralization and sovereignty over your chain and then socket and superchain type energy, like reforming the composability back.
01:17:29.920 - 01:17:34.766, Speaker A: Yeah, that's true. This is another take. This one's mine. Do you want to read it?
01:17:34.868 - 01:17:50.740, Speaker B: Sure. Ryan Sean Adams says, if you're still in crypto and manage to hold your private keys through all the scams, rugs, hacks, phishing, fake yield and populist demagogues, then I think you're going to do just fine this century. It's everyone else I'm worried about.
01:17:51.670 - 01:18:25.534, Speaker A: I feel like, so hardened. I feel like we are kind of like the veterans on the frontier. Like we're learning about security, rug pulls, populism, what to trust online, all of these things in a very accelerated timeline. And these are all skills that everyone else is going to learn and need to learn for the rest of the 21st century. Even things like securing your private keys, right. I look at password management for my legacy banks and financial accounts. I'm like, oh, my God, this is so far behind.
01:18:25.534 - 01:18:43.730, Speaker A: Right? So if you can hold your private keys, you're doing just fine. If you haven't been fished yet, or even if you have been fished yet, maybe that's a good learning lesson in itself, but I think these are all 21st century skills that we're all going to need pretty soon. Agree? David, what are you bullish on, man?
01:18:43.880 - 01:18:48.498, Speaker B: Okay, it's right behind me. It's a picture. I'm going to pull it out as soon as I tell a story.
01:18:48.584 - 01:18:48.834, Speaker A: Okay.
01:18:48.872 - 01:19:05.242, Speaker B: So I tweeted out this photo that you see on screen. Oh, boy, that's a lot of stuff. And this is like a classic backpackers picture when they lay out all of their gear before they go backpacking. So this was in May, right? Before I did. Like my 4 July. Yeah, right. A lot of was actually.
01:19:05.242 - 01:19:29.780, Speaker B: There was more stuff. Anyways, so someone this hooded pepe replies to this and goes, is this Cass Simmered approved and tags this individual Cass Simmered? No idea who Kath Simmered is. But I click in and I find if you want to go, yeah. And I find that she's an NFT artist, a photographer, and she has this mint that is currently live and two thirds minted out, which is a piece titled above the Noise. And I just love it.
01:19:30.230 - 01:19:32.414, Speaker A: Fun fact, did she take this photo?
01:19:32.542 - 01:19:55.606, Speaker B: Not only did she take this photo, that this is a real photo, kind of. She is a photographer, digital artist. So this is a composite. So it's a number of photos flapped together and that's kind of like her deal. She's a hybrid adventurer, photographer, digital artist. The first money Ryan I ever made was actually as photography. Me and my dad would just go backpacking and I would bring my Nikon and I would take some pictures.
01:19:55.606 - 01:20:09.070, Speaker B: And that's kind of like the first skill set I developed as a young adult. And I sold these photos as prints. And then I went to college. And that was kind of how I paid for slush fund money in college. I would take, like, sorority pictures.
01:20:09.890 - 01:20:11.258, Speaker A: Do you ever do weddings?
01:20:11.434 - 01:20:38.534, Speaker B: I never did a wedding. I know, but then going and doing that, taking sorority photos in college took the soul out of it because I wanted to do landscapes. But landscape, like Monetizing, my landscape photos was really hard. And for what I was, I was an okay photographer, but I'm not a professional. And so I didn't have a mechanism to generate revenue as a photographer. And then I also got interested in psychology and then the blah, blah, blah, blah. Fast forward.
01:20:38.534 - 01:20:59.130, Speaker B: Now I'm a podcaster, but I find this NFT mint. I'm like, wow, I'm about to go climbing all these mountains, and there's this NFT photographer who is this adventurer person taking mountain photos, selling them for ether. And so I mint it. And so I mint it and purchased it via Cast Simmered. And then I watched this back in July.
01:20:59.210 - 01:21:00.926, Speaker A: I see this back in July 1.
01:21:01.028 - 01:21:20.530, Speaker B: She has this crazy the NFT. Now, the NFT media company, NFT Bankless NFT, I'll call them did this great video essay about Cast Simmered, the Artist, which I highly recommend. We'll put it into the show notes. So I watched that. I'm like, wow, this is really cool. And so I hit her up on Telegram. Fun fact, she's also a dick butt holder.
01:21:20.530 - 01:21:30.630, Speaker B: So she's in the dick butt telegram with me. And then, okay, so I'll pull out the picture. And so I bought a print, and now I've got it right.
01:21:30.700 - 01:21:33.080, Speaker A: Wow, it's super cool. That's great.
01:21:33.870 - 01:21:37.818, Speaker B: Now I have to go frame it and put it up. I can't put it in frame, but here we go.
01:21:37.904 - 01:21:43.434, Speaker A: So the moral of the story is, I don't know, you can Monetize your Hobies.
01:21:43.562 - 01:22:01.954, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm bullish on I know this is a very big 2021 take, but I'm bullish on new Monetization mechanisms for digital artists that didn't previously have them and also artist collector relations, because now her and I just like, chat about stuff. And it's been pretty cool.
01:22:02.072 - 01:22:04.180, Speaker A: That's creator economy stuff, man.
01:22:05.430 - 01:22:08.194, Speaker B: In 2021, it was theory, and this is practice.
01:22:08.322 - 01:22:18.454, Speaker A: Yeah, that's true. We're not in the fervor of JPEG mania here, so we can actually be cool and sober and appreciate the art a bit more.
01:22:18.492 - 01:22:28.698, Speaker B: Oh, and the title of the piece, Ryan, is above the Noise. While you and I are talking about, man, there's a lot of dumb bankless haters out there. I'm going to stay above the noise. I thought all of it wove together very well.
01:22:28.784 - 01:22:37.210, Speaker A: That's awesome. You know, another thing I was thinking, by the way, is I'm so glad. We don't have to fight the FUD that NFTs are bad for the environment this cycle.
01:22:37.290 - 01:22:49.538, Speaker B: Yeah, right, because we're going to get something else. All right, that was what I'm bullish on. I'm bullish on NFTs in 2021. What are you bullish on?
01:22:49.544 - 01:23:00.114, Speaker A: Right. I am bullish on new product we're releasing. It's called claimables. All right, this is a little sneak peek here. Okay. These are my wallets on the bankless website. This is in staging.
01:23:00.114 - 01:23:45.474, Speaker A: So I'm actually I don't know if I'm allowed to share the screen, so I'll flick off it really quick. But this is based on we acquired a company called Earnify, which we've talked about on the roll up a few times. And what did it does is you plug in your addresses and it identifies all of the on chain opportunities that you might have. So were you eligible for an AirDrop? Were you eligible for an NFT mint an allow list? For instance? Did you deposit some funds inside, pulled together, and you won a prize maybe that week? Well, you just plug your addresses into Earnify and it tells you what you've earned, what you can claim. This is a product that we're now integrating into the bankless website. It's called claimables. We're very excited about it.
01:23:45.474 - 01:23:50.566, Speaker A: All right. That is dropping next Monday. If you're a bankless citizen, you will have access to this.
01:23:50.668 - 01:24:32.270, Speaker B: You will have access to this. So this last week, Connect AirDrop went live. And so we actually have the numbers for people who have loaded up their address inside of the bankless app. $62 million US dollars, fiat dollars are claimable of the Connect AirDrop to earn five subscribers. So we know that bankless listeners, citizens, whoever pays for this service, $62 million is up for grabs. The last we checked, $18 million of the expiring soon TM Arbitrum AirDrop is still yet to be claimed, which is how we know that A, this is valuable, and B, there's work to do. You all still need to claim $18 million of arbitrary what are you doing, you listener?
01:24:32.350 - 01:25:02.250, Speaker A: Well, maybe they don't know about it. This is like back to kind of tools that we're building because we want ourselves is. I don't have a way to scan through all of my wallets and identify all of the things I'm eligible for apart from this tool, apart from Earnify. And now what we're building in Claimables. So anyway, bankless citizens, if you've been waiting for a reason to upgrade to bankless citizenship, this might be it. There's always a link in the show notes for you. Of course, you get the Bankless Premium feed as well.
01:25:02.320 - 01:25:08.138, Speaker B: RSS feed, the ad free Bankless Premium feed all the way through the podcast seven minutes faster.
01:25:08.314 - 01:25:16.814, Speaker A: All right, David, I got a meme of the week for you, and this is going to take a little bit of explaining. I think it also ties into the moment of Zen. Okay?
01:25:17.012 - 01:25:18.522, Speaker B: Oh, I didn't know we had a moment of Zen.
01:25:18.586 - 01:25:32.866, Speaker A: Well, you know what? We're going to make this the moment of Zen. So I'm going to get through disclosures first, then we're going to go through the kind of the meme the moment of Zen. So a few things to disclose. Dave and I are investors and advisors to optimism. We're also members of the rocket pool. Odao, we mentioned rocket pool today. And I'm an advisor to Polygon.
01:25:32.866 - 01:25:48.698, Speaker A: I'm an investor in Reflector Labs and Arbitrum and also stockit, as we mentioned. Gotta let you know as well, we are long term investors. We're not journalists. We don't do paid content. There's always a link to all full bankless disclosures in the show notes. And of course, crypto is risky. You could lose what you put in.
01:25:48.698 - 01:26:07.170, Speaker A: But we are headed west. The frontier, it's not for everyone. But we're glad you're with us on the Bankless journey. All right, let's set up this moment of Zen. David, this is what I was thinking. This video clip from Rick and Morty was what I was thinking the entire time we were doing that episode this week with Dom.
01:26:08.070 - 01:26:10.290, Speaker B: Unreleased episode that Bankless listeners haven't heard.
01:26:10.360 - 01:26:28.450, Speaker A: Yes. And we're talking about this concept called Blobs and Blobspace. And I was thinking, how am I going to explain this to my family? Like the podcast that I just did and everything I heard Dom talking. We were talking about polynomials. We're talking about dank Sharding and proto dank Sharding.
01:26:28.530 - 01:26:29.602, Speaker B: Erasure coding.
01:26:29.666 - 01:26:32.540, Speaker A: Erasure coding and erasure coding is not real.
01:26:33.230 - 01:26:34.730, Speaker B: No, actually it is real.
01:26:34.800 - 01:26:36.778, Speaker A: That's real. That is a real one.
01:26:36.864 - 01:26:37.818, Speaker B: But you wouldn't know.
01:26:37.904 - 01:27:06.162, Speaker A: Yeah, it's all of these crazy words. And I was just thinking the entire time when Dom was talking, I was thinking of this clip from Rick and Morty. We'll play it now. Everyone has a plumbus in their home. First they take the dinglebop and they smooth it out with a bunch of schleem. The schleem is then repurposed for later batches. They take the dinglebop and they push it through the Grumbo where the fleab is rubbed against it.
01:27:06.162 - 01:27:31.290, Speaker A: It's important that the fleab is rubbed because the fleab has all of the fleab juice. Then a schlammy shows up and he rubs it and spits on it. They cut the fleab. There's several hyzards in the way. The Blamps rub against the Trumbles and the plubis and Grumbo are shaved away. That leaves you with a regular old plumbus.
01:27:34.130 - 01:27:35.440, Speaker B: Why don't you do it?
01:27:37.330 - 01:27:39.086, Speaker A: Because Murphy's barking. Hold on.
01:27:39.188 - 01:27:40.110, Speaker B: Okay, I can do it.
01:27:40.180 - 01:27:42.160, Speaker A: Shut up, Murphy. Hold on.
01:27:42.930 - 01:27:43.962, Speaker B: That's a good blooper.
01:27:44.026 - 01:27:47.630, Speaker A: God. Murphy, you hear it? Is it?
01:27:47.700 - 01:27:47.934, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:27:47.972 - 01:27:56.180, Speaker A: Yeah, I hear it. I can do he's almost he's almost done. I can feel it. Is.
