00:00:07.450 - 00:00:30.246, Speaker A: Welcome to bankless, where we explore the frontier of Internet money and Internet finance. This is how to get started, how to get better, and how to front run the opportunity. This is Ryan. Sean Adams. I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless. David, this was an exceptional interview with Jeremy Alair. What were some of the highlights for you?
00:00:30.348 - 00:01:11.598, Speaker B: Yeah, Jeremy Alair, founder of Circle and USDC. Really a timely episode because of how much regulatory action there's been, especially in the last quarter of 2000 and 22,021 shows that there's no signs of that slowing down. And USDC and crypto dollars seems to be kind of at the forefront of that regulatory conversation. So that's one of the big topics that we get into with Jeremy Alair, as well as, of course, USDC inside of DeFi, USDC replacing the commercial banking layer and all the benefits that public permissionless blockchains like Ethereum can offer the world using things like USDC.
00:01:11.774 - 00:01:50.382, Speaker A: Yeah, it's interesting because he seemed pretty bullish, actually, on the regulatory side, that we are going to kind of come out ahead, and I'm not sure that he'd always say that. So there have probably been times where I've seen him in various ways frustrated with the regulatory bodies of the US and kind of their handling of crypto, but he seemed pretty optimistic this time around. What's interesting to me, David, is he knows a number of these regulators on a first name basis. So he's very plugged into that world and kind of fighting for crypto in DC at that level. So it's good to see him optimistic on that.
00:01:50.516 - 00:01:50.814, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:01:50.852 - 00:02:16.466, Speaker B: One of the most interesting components of this interview, that was my biggest takeaway, was the relationship between Coinbase and circle and USDC. There was a little bit of unexpected protocol sync thesis conversation to have there where the center consortium is kind of this neutral layer for producing USDC that Coinbase is a part of and circle is a part of. And I thought that that was a pretty interesting takeaway.
00:02:16.578 - 00:02:46.658, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. And for those of you who are wondering, you're saying, like, USDC guys, that's not bankless. You're right, it's not completely bankless. This is kind of a crypto banking type product. However, we did talk a lot about how this is the gateway to Defi. Essentially, for a lot of people, this is the gateway to non sovereign stores of value, commodity monies like bitcoin and like Ether. And Jeremy talked about how he was bullish ultimately on that future.
00:02:46.658 - 00:03:15.162, Speaker A: This is another bridge into that world and another path to get here. I think it would be a shame if people stopped at USDC on Coinbase and didn't do anything else, but I don't think that's likely, David. I think once they get a taste of know, you got to go all in, you got to explore the frontier, you got to go into where the action and excitement is, which is Defi. So this is going to be a gateway. This is not a replacement of crypto native systems to me. Yeah.
00:03:15.216 - 00:03:47.650, Speaker B: And bankless maximalism I don't think is for everyone. Right? So it's not just Ether and Defi tokens in your Ethereum address. Using USDC in your Ethereum address is way more bankless than Wells Fargo dollars in your Wells Fargo account. It's always a step in the right direction. And the more USDC on Ethereum, the more financialized and monetized ether the asset and ethereum the economy is. So I think it's long term bullish for Ethereum no matter what. Guys, this was a fantastic interview.
00:03:47.650 - 00:04:27.166, Speaker B: Just a reminder for bankless paid subscribers, there is a 2030 minutes debrief conversation that Ryan and I have at the end of every single episode. That's where Ryan and I just hop into Zoom and we discuss the episode right after we record it. That is available to all bankless paid listeners as well as well as all the other debriefs we've ever done. This is some of the best learning that I get done just having these conversations with Ryan after the episode, and I'm happy to make these conversations available to the bankless paid subscribers as well. So if you guys want to access that, there is a link in the show notes so you can go and hear those debrief conversations.
00:04:27.278 - 00:04:37.540, Speaker A: We will jump into the interview with Jeremy in just a minute, but before we do, we've got to tell you about the fantastic sponsors who made this bankless episode possible.
00:04:38.250 - 00:05:16.306, Speaker D: Synthetix is Ethereum's decentralized derivatives liquidity protocol. What does that mean? Synthetix is a platform for creating and trading synthetic assets, which are assets that are priced via an oracle rather than bids or asks. Traders can use the quinta exchange, which hosts and trades all of the synthetic assets created by synthetics. Traders on quinta can trade synthetic tokens like SBTC s Oil or SDFI. Because Quenta is powered by synthetics, traders experience zero slippage on their trades. No, I didn't mean low slippage. I meant no slippage because that is the power of the synthetics platform.
00:05:16.306 - 00:06:14.190, Speaker D: No, slippage on your trades. You can also easily short assets with isync, which are synthetic assets that move inversely to their target asset. Synthetix isn't just for traders. Developers can build on Synthetix to access the infinite liquidity offered by synthetic assets, or investors can stake collateral to the protocol and earn fees that the protocol collects. If you're a trader and you're looking for a trading platform not found in the legacy world, check out quinta IO. If you are a developer or you just want to earn yield on your collateral, go to www dot synthetics IO, where you can stake your SNX for east and earn fees from synthetics. If you want to live a bankless life, you need to get a monolith DFI Visa card monolith is both a one two punch of an Ethereum smart contract wallet, as well as an accompanying visa card that lets you spend the money that you have in your Ethereum wallet wherever Visa is accepted.
00:06:14.190 - 00:07:03.058, Speaker D: It's really a fantastic tool that lets you use Ethereum for what it does best, which is holding and managing your financial assets, but also keeps you connected to the rest of the world's payment rails. Monolith also offers on ramp services for getting your fiat money into the world of Defi, so it's trivial to top up your monolith card if ever you need to, and your deposited money goes straight into your non custodial wallet. So your money is never held by a centralized intermediary. Because your monolith wallet is native to ethereum, monolith helps you transcend both the legacy and the crypto worlds. Because the money that you hold in your monolith wallet has the power of defi behind it. Swapping assets on uniswap or earning yield in defi is at your fingertips. But with monolith, so are the groceries at your grocery store or the coffee at your coffee shop.
00:07:03.058 - 00:07:07.910, Speaker D: Go to monolith XYz to sign up and get your monolith visa card today.
00:07:07.980 - 00:07:29.146, Speaker A: Bankless nation we are here with Jeremy Alair. He is a serial entrepreneur. He's the co founder of Circle. He is also almost the king of stablecoins in a way. He's definitely an advocate for the US crypto industry in Washington, DC. Jeremy, it's fantastic to have you on the podcast. How are you doing, sir?
00:07:29.248 - 00:07:34.166, Speaker E: I'm great, thanks. Ryan and David, really awesome to be here with, you know.
00:07:34.208 - 00:07:43.426, Speaker A: Okay, so can we start with this question? Nomenclature wise, is it stablecoin or crypto dollar? What do you know?
00:07:43.448 - 00:07:44.126, Speaker C: It's really funny.
00:07:44.158 - 00:08:00.600, Speaker E: When we got started working on this, we sort of called these fiat tokens, but that obviously was, like, what they were. And then sort of stablecoin became what people started referring to these as.
00:08:03.290 - 00:08:28.186, Speaker C: I think now, basically, people call this stuff stablecoins in the broader sector, like if it's in policy or financial institutions, big fintechs and crypto, obviously, stablecoin is pretty well known. I like crypto dollar as well, but I think USDC is both a stablecoin and a crypto dollar. But there are going to be stablecoins.
00:08:28.218 - 00:08:29.278, Speaker E: That are not crypto dollars.
00:08:29.364 - 00:08:31.946, Speaker C: And so I think the category is still stablecoins.
00:08:31.978 - 00:08:37.090, Speaker A: Ooh, I like this. Okay, so what is the distinction? What is the difference between stablecoin versus stable dollar?
00:08:37.510 - 00:08:46.930, Speaker C: Well, I mean, you could have a euro stablecoin, or you could have a yen stablecoin or a Singapore dollar stablecoin, and those are not crypto dollars because they're not dollars.
00:08:47.080 - 00:08:47.586, Speaker A: Okay.
00:08:47.688 - 00:08:52.386, Speaker B: And then Dai also would not fit into the category of crypto dollar.
00:08:52.418 - 00:08:52.614, Speaker C: Right.
00:08:52.652 - 00:08:54.630, Speaker B: Because it's also, DAi is not a dollar.
00:08:55.610 - 00:09:13.454, Speaker C: Right. That is sort of this kind of collateralized issued instrument. It's a little bit different. I mean, we're getting into semantics, obviously, but on a spectrum, there's different ways of working with this stuff.
00:09:13.572 - 00:10:02.858, Speaker A: Okay, well, let's start this by talking a little bit about last year, 2020. It was really like the year of crypto dollars. It was the year of stablecoins. We want to get into USDC and the role that it played. I have kind of a question before we get into all of that, too, which is, I'm not sure it's totally clear for our listeners or for myself, what is the relationship between circle and Coinbase with respect to USDC? Because sometimes you kind of hear about circle and USDC, other times you hear about kind of Coinbase and USDC. Can you tell us about that relationship? Does one of you own USDC versus the other? Do you both issue? How does it work?
00:10:03.024 - 00:10:03.740, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:10:06.290 - 00:11:30.794, Speaker C: Just a little bit of history here. We've been, as circle, very interested in models for how you can kind of represent fiat currency as digital currency. And we've experimented with different ways of approaching that over the years. And then in 2017, we made a decision to kind of work on what we thought of as, like, a protocol layer for fiat tokens, with us dollar tokens being the starting point for that. But really importantly, when we thought about it, we really believed, and obviously continue to believe, that the right long term approach for something like this is to have a governed standard, and to really build a governance model around it. And there's a lot of analogies to other things that are standards on the Internet, whether it's the worldwide web consortium and the standards around the web or the IETF, and standards around different protocols that exist on the Internet, but in particular with fiat protocols and the kinds of things that you'd build around them. You don't just want that to be from a company, you really want it to be something that can be multiple issuers, multiple companies, multiple geographies, and actually have a governance process around it.
00:11:30.794 - 00:12:51.202, Speaker C: So we created something called center, and Coinbase joined us in the founding of center, basically from the fall of 2018 until today, Circle and Coinbase both Manage center consortium, and we can talk more about that in a little bit, because it's growing independently of either Circle or Coinbase. And there's a new, I think, incredibly strong CEO that is going to be building out that consortium in a very significant way with a lot of different types of firms getting involved. We, I think, as circle and Coinbase together, saw an opportunity to build a standard and govern a standard that could work as a high quality, kind of trusted dollar market infrastructure in the crypto economy. Technically, Circle operates as what's called the minting issuer of USDC, and Coinbase operates as what is called an issuer of USDC. And we kind of jointly govern the evolution of the smart contracts, the open source project. We all contribute source code to that and implementations to that. We make decisions together about where that standard goes.
00:12:51.202 - 00:13:04.440, Speaker C: There's other policies, like the governance of the reserve model, the compliance and regulatory model, all those things we do together. So that's something that has been a really close partnership between Circle and Coinbase over the years.
00:13:06.170 - 00:13:16.426, Speaker B: What would you say would be the advantage of the dividing up of responsibilities of USDC? And is that how you would kind of characterize what, it's not so much.
00:13:16.448 - 00:14:39.430, Speaker C: A dividing up of responsibilities, meaning there are a lot of pieces to this. I think the first is that stablecoins are regulated as like a stored value, electronic money technology and payment technology in the United States, and that's increasingly how they're being regulated in other parts of the world. And in that model, there is sort of a company that is doing the issuing of that e money, if you will, and has the fiduciary responsibility that has to manage the reserves, and is ultimately on the hook as the licensed and regulated entity that is doing that now, on top of that, you can build all kinds of different arrangements around the technology standards around distribution, and that's what center really established. But I think the best way to think about this and the way we think about this is essentially every kind of major innovation in electronic money has been consortium of private sector actors that are working together on technical standards and interoperability, and then they build kind of governance models around it. That's what Swift is. Swift is a consortium of private sector actors. They happen to be systemically important.
00:14:39.430 - 00:15:24.494, Speaker C: So major central banks also have a supervisory role. If you look at what most people think of as the sort of most popular forms of electronic payments, like card networks, would probably be what you think of card networks are associations of members. They're consortiums. They define set of technical standards, they define interoperability. And that way, not every bank is issuing their own proprietary system for processing cards. They all can get interoperability with each other, and in a sense, it creates a fungible electronic money unit. So stablecoins have the same potential and I think will be far, far larger in scale ultimately in terms of what they handle compared to those more proprietary models.
00:15:24.494 - 00:15:51.290, Speaker C: But that's a little bit of a way to think about it. And so, success over time looks like lots of crypto finance firms, large consumer fintechs, banks, others that are part of a consortium that are involved in this and involved in governance and involved in the standards. And that's when, as that happens, we think this gets into trillions of dollars of scale that are issued in these digital currencies.
00:15:51.710 - 00:16:12.162, Speaker A: It's funny, people would not have believed trillions of dollars of scale was possible before a year like 2020. We'll talk about the numbers in a bit. I just want to make one comment on what you're saying with consortiums. Quite famously, visa was a consortium, largest payment network in the world, came out of the. That was a consortium. The same way you're talking.
00:16:12.216 - 00:16:12.770, Speaker C: Absolutely.
00:16:12.920 - 00:17:13.970, Speaker A: We use this term, Jeremy, called credible neutrality a lot on bankless. The idea that more credibly neutral protocols or organizations or institutions are more scalable for the simple reason that they are unbiased, they're neutral. So if you as circle are competing against other exchanges, like a coinbase or a. Like, they're going to release their own coin to kind of compete with you, right? Because it's sort of a winner take all market. You're all competing. But as a consortium, you could scale much larger because no single entity or company has the governance power to bias the coin in their favor or not. So the circle model, it seems to me, and the center model, that consortium underneath USDC is far more scalable.
00:17:13.970 - 00:17:21.690, Speaker A: And it does seem like we could grow to something as large and as fundamentally important as like the visa network here on top of something.
00:17:21.760 - 00:17:22.540, Speaker C: Oh, absolutely.
00:17:24.670 - 00:17:28.794, Speaker E: I have this philosophy, and this is sort of an Internet philosophy in some.
00:17:28.832 - 00:18:48.994, Speaker C: Ways, which is as we've enabled sort of these decentralized protocols and distributed systems that kind of connect people and machines everywhere, whether it be for sharing of data, sharing of content, communications, like all these kind of layers that have been built up over the past decades, every time you do that and you enable global connectivity into standards like that, the actual volume of what happens ends up being orders of magnitude larger than in the prior more closed network systems. And so my view would be that the gross scale of transactions in the world will just be radically larger because as costs approach zero, which I think inevitably they do, the unit economic costs approach zero, then the velocity can be even larger. And so sort of the net output of payment volume in the world will grow larger and larger. And then it comes back to people wanting to store value in these digital currency units because they have greater utility value. And so that leads to trillions of dollars in market capitalization over time.
00:18:49.112 - 00:19:20.014, Speaker A: Yeah, it's totally true. Like what you're saying is open networks win, right? We've definitely seen that with Ethereum being an open network and all stablecoins being deployed on top of it. I hope we address that in a moment. I want to talk about growth for just a second here, because stablecoin supply is up from 6 billion in January 2020 to 34 billion now. Right. USDC itself, 500 million to 5 billion last year, actually.
00:19:20.052 - 00:19:27.090, Speaker C: Yeah, it's been wild. Yeah, we've just crossed 5.4 billion.
00:19:28.470 - 00:19:31.362, Speaker A: Were you surprised by this? Are you surprised by this?
00:19:31.416 - 00:19:31.822, Speaker E: Totally.
00:19:31.886 - 00:20:09.130, Speaker C: I mean, at one level I'm surprised, at another level I'm not. Because obviously as we built this and we thought about it, we thought, okay, this has this potential. I think everyone was caught by surprise in terms of how rapidly the pickup of this happened in 2020. And it was really interesting. I mean, I remember obviously extremely vividly to basically early March of last year. And it's really interesting. You can correlate the growth very heavily to the impact of the pandemic on the economy.
00:20:09.130 - 00:20:53.310, Speaker C: And we saw issuance start to spike up as crypto markets came alive in Asia in response to Covid. And then as the pandemic took hold globally, just the volume started to really take off. So there was this interesting correlation. But I think back in early March, we were actually just launching a whole new suite of services built up around USDC, and we didn't know what the demand would look like for that. We had a lot of ideas. And I remember sitting with my board of directors, it was actually literally like days before the lockdown in the United States and just saying, like, jeez, I don't know. What's going to happen is the economy.
00:20:53.310 - 00:21:33.610, Speaker C: Do we need to cut our company in half? What's going to happen here? As a lot of people kind of thought about it, and then literally it was just all of a sudden, the growth just started kicking in. We're like, oh, my God, what's going on here? And so it really did take us by surprise. In the abstract, we've always felt some inevitability to this, and so have always thought, yeah, this can be really big. But even throughout the year, the way in which it sort of tended to compound, no pun intended, it really far exceeded certainly what we had planned.
00:21:34.030 - 00:22:02.100, Speaker B: One of my favorite tweets that came out of 2020 was Brian Armstrong's tweet a couple of days after the one $200 stimulus check went out. And he tweeted out just a graph of different deposit sizes going into coinbase, and the $1,200 deposit size was just through the charts. Would you say that USDC benefited from similar tailwinds as Coinbase deposits into their mean?
00:22:02.470 - 00:22:50.562, Speaker C: I think there's some correlation mean overall, I would mean this is sort of the crypto markets as a whole, right? It's been perceived to be an asset class that has benefited from the enormous amount of inflation that's taking place in real world dollars. And so that goes into risk assets, it goes into crypto, it drives crypto market growth, drives demand in turn for stablecoins. Crypto market growth drives demand for DeFi borrowing. DeFi lending drives demand for stablecoins. And then dollarization as a theme, crypto dollarization. But dollarization more broadly is driving demand, and that's a direct impact of economic conditions around the world. Currency devaluations, things like that, that are happening.
00:22:50.562 - 00:22:55.250, Speaker C: And so all of those seem to kind of feed each other a little bit as well.
00:22:55.400 - 00:23:05.320, Speaker B: Would you say that that's the main reason why there has been such an influx of USDC into Ethereum, is just serving those demands? Or is there other forces at play as.
00:23:06.330 - 00:23:58.794, Speaker C: I mean, I think the overarching drivers are. There's just continued significant growth in individuals and institutions participating in digital asset markets. That's one. The second, which is very much related, is this incredible growth in DeFi. And DeFi protocols, which really heavily rely on stablecoins, both as collateral and as borrowed assets and for liquidity and other things. And then what we've seen, which has been really fascinating, is this really interesting growth in businesses, not just crypto native companies, but a lot of different types of organizations who are basically realizing, wow, this is a really powerful settlement medium. This actually has a whole bunch of advantages compared to the banking system.
00:23:58.794 - 00:24:57.542, Speaker C: And so we're just seeing really nice growth in businesses that are adopting this for international global transactions. We're seeing demand for this that's coming out of Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia, other parts of the world, which is really interesting. And so I think one of the phenomenons, and this relates to the actual kind of market cap growth as well, which is what's been really interesting about USDC, and I think also for tether as well, is the net number in circulation continues to grow. Now, what people don't know is with USDC is that it's redeemed on a massive scale as well. It works both ways. It's not like a roach motel, it works both ways. That's incredibly important, right? This is valued as a dollar because it's always redeemable as a dollar.
00:24:57.542 - 00:25:37.950, Speaker C: And there's great retail infrastructure for that through Coinbase. There's great institutional infrastructure for that through. So there's enormous, there's billions of dollars of value that's redeemed as well. But the net amount in circulation continues to grow because people, it's sticky people, once they start using it and holding it, they realize, well, why would I want to put this back into the Ach form of money? Or why would I want to put this back into the swift form of money? I'd rather keep it in a blockchain native form, because it's just more powerful that way. And so we're seeing that stickiness and that's creating flywheel effects of people who are realizing that this can actually be used for a much broader range of payment use cases.
00:25:38.130 - 00:26:13.220, Speaker B: One of the bankless theses is the Ethereum protocol is one of the great disintermediaries, and specifically of the banking layer, and specifically the commercial banking layer. And you just said it, that so many people are seeing the advantages of using USDC on Ethereum to settle payments and transactions between them. How do you think these forces are going to impact the commercial banking industry? How will the commercial banking layer of the world pivot to answer to this new payment infrastructure with, for example, USDC on?
00:26:14.070 - 00:28:08.394, Speaker C: I mean, there's so many dimensions to mean one of the really big pieces of news was just a couple of weeks ago, right, which was that the OCC, which is the banking regulator for 75% of the national banks in the United States, issued a whole set of guidance around the use of stablecoins in public chains as a payment infrastructure, as a settlement infrastructure, as an electronic stored value mechanism in the US financial system. So that's a really big deal because it basically signals that banks and financial institutions can rely on this in some ways the same way that they rely upon the ACH network or other types of things. So in some ways, I think there is this kind of convergence that happens, which is this becomes a really powerful payment system, and banks and consumer fintechs and crypto firms and commerce firms and others will kind of connect to it and utilize it. So I think that's extremely positive for Ethereum, obviously, and we can talk about other layer one, layer two type issues as well. But I think that becomes something that gets broadly adopted. But I think over the long run, and this gets to, I think a core issue is we believe that as kind of third generation blockchains, and I include Ethereum two in that, and there are certainly other interesting layer one projects out there. But even just say successful layer twos on Ethereum, as that infrastructure gets widely deployed, the cost of payment transactions falls to zero.
00:28:08.394 - 00:28:40.514, Speaker C: And for traditional commercial banks, it depends on the given institution. But there's a big chunk of money they make from charging fees around, storing money and transmitting money. And then there's a big bunch of money that they make from loans and from risk taking, essentially. And I think over the long run, the ability to extract fees or achieve profits from the payment settlement will just go to zero.
00:28:40.632 - 00:28:40.914, Speaker A: Right?
00:28:40.952 - 00:29:12.714, Speaker C: It's sort of like no one charges for long distance telephone calls anymore, or so many different types of services. Like we can have these free video calls with anyone, anywhere in the world. No one's making any money on that, per se. So I think that that happens there. And so I think that that impacts any business whose core business model is charging a fee to collect or make a payment. And you got to kind of pick your time frame there, but it's inevitable. And so I think that has a big impact.
00:29:12.714 - 00:30:32.754, Speaker C: I think the more interesting, and I think obviously a huge set of topics that you guys explore all the time is what does the disintermediation of other kind of financial contracts, other types of financial market activities that becomes protocol governed and protocol facilitated, what does that do to those business models? And that's a fascinating area, obviously, and one which we're quite excited and bullish about ourselves, which I think we're in the very early stages of that. We talk about total value locked. We talk about the growth there. But when we look at the total amount of capital that gets deployed into borrowing and lending, or that is issued against collateral and other things in the world, it's in the trillions of it's in, it's enormous. And so there's a tremendous opportunity to transform. Know, I had a conversation with Robert Leshner last week, and the topic I kind of laddered off of Brian Brooks editorial on the FT, about self driving banks and what that looks like. And so we were just playing off of that concept.
00:30:32.754 - 00:31:04.274, Speaker C: And right now, a lot of the protocols that are there that interact with stablecoins, I mean, it's fully collateralized borrowing and lending. The critical thing about commercial banks is that they take risks. They basically say, we believe that there'll be future cash flows from you as an entity, whether an individual or business. And they create money. They create new money. They create new money by creating new deposits. And it's an extension of credit.
00:31:04.274 - 00:31:41.040, Speaker C: And it's built on the premise that there will be future cash flows. It's impossible to do that right now with crypto, by definition, you can't create money. And so I think it's an interesting interplay, which is, do we move into a world of full reserve banking and we live within the limits of kind of fully issued assets, whether it be a bitcoin or a USDC or what have you, and then ultimately, how does that interact with that traditional banking business model of money creation and credit?
00:31:41.730 - 00:32:10.978, Speaker A: Yeah, it's very interesting. Defi has not built out its credit primitive yet. That is something that is certainly yet to come. I was thinking about this. So bankless, of course, believes in the thesis that this technology, crypto, will completely disrupt the banking system. And I think a lot of bankless is a group of users. We don't just talk about crypto, we actually use crypto.
00:32:10.978 - 00:32:53.054, Speaker A: And I want to underscore this point for someone who's maybe a little bit new, there are like three types of digital dollars that you can have right now, or there are three types of dollars you can have. One is like physical dollars in your wallet, right? That has obvious limitations. Not very poor. It's not in the digital at all. It's not Internet. Then you have dollars in your bank account, like these wells Fargo dollars, and they suck, too, because anytime you want to actually do something with your money, there's a limit on taking how much out, or there's ach transfer. I have to show up at a bank with my id physically to wire some funds that's with my local bank.
00:32:53.054 - 00:33:18.134, Speaker A: Like, how crazy is that? And then you have this third category of dollars, which are crypto dollars or coins. USDC. Right. Is one of those. And what I found personally, Jeremy, on my kind of crypto bankless journey, is that stablecoins like USDC are so much more valuable than the wells Fargo dollars. Totally, right. So, like you were mentioning that USDC is sticky.
00:33:18.134 - 00:33:33.360, Speaker A: Oh my, yes. Like, I want all of my us dollars out of Wells Fargo and into at least something like a coinbase where it's in USDC. Why? Because USDC is like dollars with superpowers. Right.
00:33:33.730 - 00:33:35.158, Speaker B: Dollars plus software.
00:33:35.274 - 00:33:52.454, Speaker A: It's dollars plus software, and it has exposure to crypto rails. So I can generate more yield on it. I can send money to David in like 2 minutes. Right. Any amount that have to. I don't have to show up at a bank in person. That's what this is providing people.
00:33:52.454 - 00:33:54.466, Speaker A: It's dollars with superpowers.
00:33:54.658 - 00:34:10.250, Speaker E: Yeah, I actually have used that phrase to talk about it in the past. Yeah. Sort of superpowered, turbocharged kind of dollars.
00:34:10.400 - 00:34:13.520, Speaker C: Yeah. I think one of the really interesting.
00:34:14.370 - 00:34:16.494, Speaker E: Other differences that I think is more.
00:34:16.532 - 00:35:12.800, Speaker C: Subtle is because USDC, it's a full reserve digital currency unit, it's fully reserved against underlying dollars. It has some different attributes. I think a commercial bank money, if you think about it in the classic sense, your dollar at Wells Fargo, if that happens to be the bank or whatever that you're using, that dollar is a claim on their balance sheet. It's an IOU. It literally is. Right. And so they might have, let's just say, $10 billion of actual kind of deposits of base level m one money.
00:35:12.800 - 00:35:58.910, Speaker C: But their obligations that are outstanding might actually be 100 billion. So the assets to kind of deposits ratio can be like eight to one. And there are standards for that, that basel, the bank of international settlements, and the Basel standard set for banks. And so they're a little bit different in that sense. And that's the classic fractional reserve money kind of concept and issue. And that's obviously subtle for people to understand. But yeah, just the utility value alone, obviously is significant.
00:35:59.250 - 00:36:42.400, Speaker B: One of my favorite mental models about this industry is that the cryptocurrency industry is like speed running through the history of money and finance. Right. Like bitcoin is our digital gold, ethereum is turning into our banking layer. And one of these landmarks one of these stops along the speed running of monetary history is fully reserve banks. And then in the future after that is fractional reserve banks, which kind of implies, if you want to extrapolate that out, that fractional reserve crypto dollars perhaps might be coming to Ethereum one day. Why not USDC? And maybe you can talk about just like, where you see the evolution of crypto dollars going into the future.
00:36:42.930 - 00:36:44.846, Speaker C: Well, I mean, the critical thing is.
00:36:44.868 - 00:37:14.230, Speaker E: That if you move to a fractional reserve model for digital currency, then you're talking about banks. That is what a bank does. That is, the business model of a bank is to take deposits and then issue credit against deposits in the form of deposits that they create, either in their own institution or at other financial institutions. It's a money creation kind of role.
00:37:14.970 - 00:37:19.146, Speaker C: And I've done some interviews myself on.
00:37:19.168 - 00:38:04.230, Speaker E: This topic, and I think one of the things, if you think about crypto, philosophically sound money principles, sound money principles. And bitcoin is certainly an expression of this, and it's grounded in austrian economic philosophy. Austrian economic philosophy also extended to, really, the Chicago school of economics in the 1930s and later. But basically, the idea is a fixed supply. Money that has a fixed supply is better money than money that can be kind of created by fiat.
00:38:04.890 - 00:38:08.330, Speaker C: And that is a really important principle.
00:38:08.830 - 00:38:27.760, Speaker E: When you move from full reserve to fractional reserve, you are basically embracing the money creation that humans create money. And I think one of the really important foundational components to bitcoin and Ethereum, Ethereum, as ether as commodity money.
00:38:29.650 - 00:38:30.014, Speaker C: Has.
00:38:30.052 - 00:38:55.030, Speaker E: That same sound money principle as well. It has a predictable supply, it has a predictable inflation rate, it's algorithmically determined, but it is fundamentally more or less a kind of fixed supply model that gives rational economic actors a basis to make decisions, and it forces people to make decisions in the context of those capacity constraints.
00:38:56.250 - 00:38:58.810, Speaker C: The basic premise of the Chicago school.
00:38:58.880 - 00:39:38.230, Speaker E: Back in the 1930s, the Chicago plan is a famous set of work from many of the most prominent economists at the time. In response to the Great Depression, which was this collapse of fractional reserve banks, you had a run in the bank, and guess what? They didn't have the money because they had lent it out. And everyone came to get their deposits at once. And there was this run in the bank, and there was a really significant argument made that we should move to full reserve banking, that banks should be, there should be essentially deposit taking banks that also facilitate payments.
00:39:38.570 - 00:40:38.778, Speaker C: And then lending activity is only based on that fixed supply money. You can't create new money. You only have that fixed supply money and crypto, I think, inherently supports that philosophy, and I think that's important and people can argue about it. I think most modern economists would say, oh, that's hogwashed. Like, credit creation is really fundamental. And obviously what's happening with central banking right now is an enormous amount of money that obviously has its own challenges. But I think the belief of the authors of the Chicago plan was that if you had full reserve banking that you would actually smooth out the boom and bust cycles, you would actually have net increases in economic output, and it would force economic actors, whether it be a corporation or a government, to work within fiscal constraints as well.
00:40:38.778 - 00:40:58.238, Speaker C: And that that's ultimately advantageous to economic activity and society. So I think a move of attempting to reintroduce money creation literally out of thin air money creation into crypto, would be very inconsistent with many of the underlying philosophical tenets of crypto itself.
00:40:58.324 - 00:41:37.734, Speaker D: Ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on Ethereum and just recently released Ave version two, which has a ton of cool new features that makes using Ave even more powerful. With Ave, you can leverage the full power of DFI money, legos, yield and composability all in one application. On Ave, there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield, and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol. If you have deposited collateral here, you can see me getting a 200 USDC loan against my portfolio of a number of different DFI tokens and ETH. I'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable.
00:41:37.782 - 00:41:39.610, Speaker B: Interest rate option, but I could choose.
00:41:39.680 - 00:42:17.938, Speaker D: The stable interest rate option if I wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently. One of Ave's V two features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets, trade them on uniswap, and then deposit them back into Ave. Ave does all of this for you, all in one seamless transaction, so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them. Check out the power of Ave@ave.com. That's Aave is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange.

00:43:23.332 - 00:44:15.674, Speaker A: This is some people get a little bit upset and say, like, oh, bank backed stablecoins. That's not the vision, right? The vision is a non sovereign store of value and non sovereign money. But what I think is a little bit subtle here is that this is exactly how we bootstrap non sovereign monies. So what people don't understand is that just as USDC is sticky, it's also a gateway to the rest of crypto. It's also a gateway to bitcoin and Ethereum and defi, right. So it's like a nice smooth on ramp. And the interesting thing, you talked about ether being sort of a commodity money, right? Well, every time there is a settlement transaction of USDC on Ethereum, it requires ether.
00:44:15.674 - 00:44:30.546, Speaker A: And eventually with other things in Ethereum, like EIP 15, five nine, a portion of that ether gets burned. So what are we doing? We're using the banking system to bootstrap our own store of value asset. This is all very synergistic in my mind.
00:44:30.648 - 00:45:27.538, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I completely buy that. I'm a very strong believer in non sovereign store of value commodity money. I'm quite long on it myself and have been for a long time. And I think fiat stablecoins such as USDC are very synergistic with that over the long run. I take a very long term view on some of this. I think 10, 20, 30 years out. What might this look like? And I do think over a longer period of time we'll move towards essentially synthetic digital currencies that are composited out of multiple reserve currency stablecoins and allocations of commodity digital money like ether and bitcoin.
00:45:27.538 - 00:45:59.760, Speaker C: As well and effectively, it's not necessarily a peg, but there's a basket, if you will, and there's a balancing that will continue to go on. And eventually, for everyday transactions in the economy, most people in the world will rely on that global synthetic unit. But increasingly, the amount of that global synthetic unit that is based on non sovereign money will increase over time and maybe over the very long run become predominantly that.
00:46:01.170 - 00:46:36.374, Speaker A: So, Jeremy, another question here I'm curious about is do you think fintech is going to join the party this cycle? So it seems to me that they're sort of the flashy user interface layer on top of the ugly fax machine that is the existing ach banking layer. Right. But it's always struck me that do they really need the banks, I wonder, right? What if they just swapped out that dusty old infrastructure for this new crypto rails infrastructure we're building? Are they going to get this at some point? Are they going to join the party?
00:46:36.422 - 00:47:02.340, Speaker E: Absolutely. We're already seeing really interesting indicators of that, and I think that will accelerate a lot over the next couple of years. I think it'll be fintechs, it'll be other types of financial institutions as well. I think very much so. We'll move towards that.
00:47:03.190 - 00:47:04.626, Speaker C: There is sort of like this kind.
00:47:04.648 - 00:47:07.320, Speaker E: Of convergence at some level where.
00:47:10.490 - 00:47:10.902, Speaker C: Really.
00:47:10.956 - 00:47:28.890, Speaker E: Broadly adopted mainstream stablecoins might have a supervisory relationship with banking regulators. But are they the same as what you'd think of as traditional banks, or are these crypto and self driving banks?
00:47:30.270 - 00:48:25.210, Speaker B: Jeremy, the last quarter of 2020, I think, was perhaps the most regulatory active in crypto that we've ever seen. And we saw some really awesome tailwind news, like what we talked about with out of the OCC. But then we also saw some very bearish, very conflicting news that's less than ideal for this industry, specifically with what we saw coming out of secretary, the treasury minutian, which actually just got struck down today, I believe, or if not yesterday, but then also with the stable act. So there's definitely some tug of wars going on between the positive and the negative regulatory news. And my opinion is this is just the beginning, and then 2021 is going to be just a more regulatory fight. Maybe you could give your opinions to us and the listeners about what you see coming in the regulatory horizon for crypto dollars and for public blockchains.
00:48:25.290 - 00:48:55.970, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, it's a fascinating time for that. I think the more that this lurches into the mainstream, the more that policymakers are going to have opinions about it. Not just opinions. They're going to legislate or they're going to come up with rules. It's a double edged sword because on the one hand it really means you're achieving super scale. Like this is going to be something that everyone in the world is going to use. And that's really exciting.
00:48:55.970 - 00:49:56.886, Speaker E: Like, wow, the idea that our transactions are going to get mediated on public chains and enable that is really exciting. It's a double edged sword also, because policy can be a blunt instrument. Rules can be ill thought or can have specific political motivations that are based on lobbying by established industries and so on. And so it's complicated. It's not straightforward. Ultimately, my philosophy has always been work with policymakers, because in the march towards global scale adoption, the notion that you're just going to route around governments, I think is not realistic. What has to happen, though, and this is something I've said a lot, is, at the end of the day, regulators are there because there are real risks, and they're there to kind of create guardrails.
00:49:56.886 - 00:50:32.390, Speaker E: And the guardrails are designed to make sure that people are not defrauded, to protect individuals and to effectively limit illicit activity, limit crime, or to ensure that the financial system is not abused by crime. Now, we know, obviously, that there are tons and tons and tons of financial products and services that have not been good for consumers, that have been utilized very broadly by criminals.
00:50:32.730 - 00:50:35.400, Speaker C: And that's like a tug of war that goes on.
00:50:36.170 - 00:50:40.666, Speaker E: And there's, I think, really good people in government that are focused on these things.
00:50:40.768 - 00:50:42.986, Speaker C: And so I think the critical thing.
00:50:43.008 - 00:50:47.178, Speaker E: Is industry has to engage on this. Now, the other perspective that I have.
00:50:47.264 - 00:52:01.486, Speaker C: Is that it's really actually incumbent on creators and on entrepreneurs and on technologists to solve the problems that are the risks that policymakers care about and solve them in a better way than regulations ever could solve them themselves. And so to me, something like the record keeping requirements on identity associated with public chain infrastructure, there's an underlying set of risk there, which is, wow, if people are self managing their crypto, they could be criminals or they could be abusing this in these other ways. Well, we clearly want to be able to have decentralized financial market infrastructure. We clearly want to be able to have individuals and businesses be able to connect to that and participate in that. Are there other ways to think about solving those problems? And it's here that I think, for example, blockchains and crypto provide a lot of the answers themselves. One of the things that I'm most excited about is self sovereign identity. I'm very, very excited about self sovereign identity.
00:52:01.486 - 00:53:04.790, Speaker C: I'm very excited about identity protocols that can be built on chain, that are built on crypto, on zero knowledge proofs, on verifiable claims and identity attestations and all these kinds of things that are these really important primitives that crypto makes possible and blockchains make possible, that can actually lead to an individual being able to say, yeah, I'm actually who I say I am. I actually am someone whose identity has been verified by an identity issuer, and I can actually take that with me and control who I give that information to and have the rights to do that and actually ultimately have DeFi protocols that know, okay, if you want to participate in this transaction, you need to prove that you're a person or what have you. And this is the kind of infrastructure that I think needs to get built. No regulator is ever going to say, here's what you need to do. They're going to say, how are you going to deal with these risks? So I tend to sort of put it back on industry and say, okay, well, how do we solve these problems?
00:53:04.940 - 00:53:41.714, Speaker A: That's a really good take. Right? I think the challenge, though, sometimes, Jeremy, is that the good regulators might say, okay, here's what we need. How are you going to solve them? But sometimes not all of the regulators take that open minded, like there's a solution here to solve it. So oftentimes what they'll do is they'll just come up with these heavy handed kind of regulations. Famously, the stable act is basically like, oh, you can't have any stablecoin denominated in us dollars.
00:53:41.832 - 00:53:48.760, Speaker C: Remember, that's not regulators. That was an academic who got the ears of some.
00:53:49.290 - 00:53:50.966, Speaker A: We had Rowan Gray on, and we.
00:53:50.988 - 00:53:54.722, Speaker C: Talked very much about view that's not regulators.
00:53:54.786 - 00:54:19.134, Speaker A: But even the proposed rule coming out of kind of minutiae, that was somewhat problematic, and it didn't offer the opportunity for industry to solve it. What's your confidence that the new administration, this new set of regulators under Biden might, how will they work with crypto in a different way? Are you optimistic? Are you pessimistic on mean?
00:54:19.172 - 00:54:50.922, Speaker C: Look, you know, the new head of the SEC is someone who's intimately familiar with crypto. He's someone who I know reasonably well. I've kind of helped co teach his crypto blockchain course at MIT. And I think he's a pragmatic person who understands the issues, the innovation, but he's also a regulator. He's someone who is going to be focused on this, is not just some unencumbered thing that's just going to go flying around.
00:54:51.056 - 00:54:54.460, Speaker A: By the way, this is Gary Gensler for Gensler. Yeah.
00:54:55.870 - 00:55:39.014, Speaker C: And Michael Barr, who is apparently going to be the new head of the OCC, is someone who also has been involved in crypto and blockchain in his career, and that's helpful. So I think people who have some awareness and education that are in these critical positions, that's really important. There will be a new head of the Federal reserve that will be appointed at some point in the next year or two. That'll be a really interesting question as to who that is and what their disposition is around this. I mean, look, when I step back and I look, know the. I mean, you can look at individual regulators. I don't think this is all about just individual regulators.
00:55:39.014 - 00:57:15.026, Speaker C: I think this is about what is the United States government's posture going to be to this critical strategic technology and infrastructure area? And I think there's a tremendous opportunity for the US government to actually realize that this is a major area of infrastructure that is going to be fundamental to the future of economic systems, to commerce, to many other things, and we'll figure out ways to support that industry. At the same time, I think there is going to be much more precise engagement around certain things like criminal abuse risk, consumer protections. And this is where I'm very hopeful that there's meaningful engagement and meaningful dialogue and ultimately kind of collaboration with industry to ensure that if there are regulations that get introduced, they're cognizant of the fundamental differences in how this technology works and the innovation that it spawns. For example, I mean, DeFi is just a totally profound example of that. This just doesn't fit the model of how you think about financial market infrastructure. This is software that runs on the Internet, that is just machines that run this financial market infrastructure. That's a really different thing, but it's here and it's got incredible power, and it's a really significant innovation that opens.
00:57:15.058 - 00:57:15.970, Speaker E: Up a lot of opportunities.
00:57:16.050 - 00:57:24.394, Speaker C: So. Okay, well, how do we think about. I. Cautiously optimistic is ultimately what I'd say.
00:57:24.592 - 00:58:19.210, Speaker B: Jeremy, I'm wondering, to get your opinion on the interaction between what me and Ryan are following, which is kind of the rise of MMT and crypto dollars and using Ethereum to host and facilitate payments with crypto dollars. We've seen Janet Yellen, who is Joe Biden's nomination to be the cabinet of the treasury. Yeah. And she's made two statements recently, one saying that she's interested in making very big moves when it comes to coronavirus virus relief, which kind of is an extension of MMT. Using the ability to mint coins help facilitate relief. And then also she's made some of the common criticisms of bitcoin. We would call this FuD, that bitcoin is used to serve terrorist financing, which to my mind kind of is like, why is Janet Yellen.
00:58:19.210 - 00:58:49.190, Speaker B: Yellen. Excuse me? Why is Janet Yellen talking about bitcoin facilitating terrorist financing? We know that's not true. That's pretty baseless to me. The incentive is that she's trying to protect the brand of the US dollar to help facilitate MMT. And we saw some of this energy coming out of Rohan Gray and the stable act that was very much a MMT inspired initiative. Do you have any thoughts about perhaps the collision course between public payment rails and MMT?
00:58:50.490 - 00:59:58.154, Speaker C: Yeah, there is a major challenge here, which is, I think in particular, I would say I'm less focused on stablecoins in relation to that, and more on non sovereign store value commodity money, like ether and bitcoin and many others that sort of fit that category. But just use those as a reference here. The rise of that on a global basis, it is absolutely a direct threat to monetary sovereignty in the current modern form. And there are a couple of ways it can go. Right. It can go the path of, okay, it actually becomes so big and important that it continues to be regulated as property, which is how it's regulated today. But it actually becomes a balance sheet instrument of governments themselves.
00:59:58.154 - 01:01:15.090, Speaker C: And not only is it a balance sheet instrument in terms of holding it in reserves, but actually governments make it a national priority to participate in mining and participate in network validation and say, this is sort of systemically important infrastructure, and we actually want to be active market participants in it. And that's actually necessary strategically, competitively, and from a national security perspective, I think that's where it goes. I think that's ultimately where it goes. When, at the end of the day, people really think about it, that will be the path. But there could be, in different parts of the world, there could be very rapid, harsh, unpredictable interventions that could be very negative for that form of digital assets. I mean, obviously, in the history of money, during the Great Depression, the federal government made holding gold illegal and seized all gold from everyone because it threatened monetary sovereignty. And it affected how fiscal stimulus worked in a massive economic contraction.
01:01:15.090 - 01:02:16.438, Speaker C: Could that happen? Could something like that happen? Conceptually, it did. Are these are tail risks, right. But I think ultimately, I don't know, Janet Yellen, but I hope to have a chance to spend time with her. And I think there's a lot of educating to do because I think the simplistic, oh, this is used for this or this is used for that, those tend to be very simplistic understandings. And so when you actually get down to the staff level, you get down to the actual people who work in these agencies, in the regulatory community, they have a much more sophisticated view on this, like Fin, which is actually the financial crimes enforcement network that is in charge of how to deal with terrorist financing, how to deal with financial crimes and the abuse of the financial system. They're incredibly savvy about this and they're very great to work know. They really are.
01:02:16.438 - 01:02:33.078, Speaker C: I think they're an agency that is part of Janet Yellen's remit. Now it's part of the Treasury Department. But I think when you get in and you get working with the actual kind of career civil servants and the established entities, they have a much stronger understanding.
01:02:33.254 - 01:03:30.090, Speaker A: Last thing on this, Jeremy, and then we'll get to defi. But just to tie off kind of regulatory and government. So you're talking about how maybe in the more distant future with MMT, these non sovereign store of values may be threatening to something like the dollar, but in the short to medium term, let's face it, the dollar is the world's reserve currency and it's quite strong. We even saw its strength, as you were saying earlier, during coronavirus. There's know some people have called it the dollar milkshake theory, this sucking of capital into dollars itself. Could you talk a little bit about the wins for the US government in crypto? Right? So the US, from an adversarial perspective, you've got China developing its own central bank digital currency, making pretty good progress from all we can tell. What is the US's answer to this? And could it be something like USDC on Ethereum?
01:03:30.250 - 01:04:27.246, Speaker C: Yeah, so I have a pretty strong view on this. And that is that historically in the west, the major advancements in the financial system have come from the private sector. And it's typically been consortiums of private sector actors working together to define standards and infrastructure that then is built out and utilized at a large scale. It's technology innovators, it's financial sector innovators, and it's standards. And that's sort of been what has worked. And I have no reason to believe it'll be any different in the digital currency world in the west. I do not believe that a giant R D project out of the Federal Reserve with a contract with IAM, or however you'd want to think about it, is going to be remotely successful in competing with the open Internet.
01:04:27.246 - 01:05:25.140, Speaker C: Internet entrepreneurs, public open source infrastructure and private sector actors. Building on top of that, the innovation is just night and day. It's just going to be far, far more competitive on the open Internet and private sector side of things. I think that the government will realize that and they'll say, actually, that's how we're going to compete. We're going to compete like we've always competed, by having open networks, by having sound supervision of private sector actors that are innovating in this space, and we're going to let that drive innovation. And I just think that's likely. And I think ultimately what that translates to is I think the US government and many other governments are going to get very much behind adoption of public blockchains as fundamental strategic infrastructure, not just for economic activity, for a wide range of other types of record keeping activity, transactional activity and the like.
01:05:25.140 - 01:06:00.238, Speaker C: So I'm extremely bullish about public chains. I think ethereum, obviously, I think very highly of ethereum, and I think that's where we'll get to is a model like that. And I think something like USDC could evolve to have a lot of other major market participants involved in it, could evolve to a place where there is some kind of relationship with central banks as well. But that's still a ways off.
01:06:00.404 - 01:06:35.740, Speaker B: Do you think these regulatory headwinds that we have seen in the recent times actually turn into regulatory tailwinds once regulators realize that the key to competing with the chinese digital yuan, or the fact that Russia is now purchasing petrol in euros instead of doubling down on a central bank digital currency out of the Fed, it's actually just much more aligned with the interests of regulators to just promote public use cases. Public blockchain's usage of us dollars absolutely makes sense to.
01:06:38.430 - 01:07:18.522, Speaker A: Let's. Let's conclude with talking about DeFi for a moment. So we've been talking very much about kind of disruption to banks and the banking system. How big of a deal is defi? I think you talked about Brian Brooks in the OCC. He penned this fantastic piece, like, equating it to self driving cars, which I think probably is an analogy that works for a lot of folks. But is Defi overrated? Is it underrated? How big of a deal is it in the future of crypto and the future of finance for the world?
01:07:18.656 - 01:08:37.198, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's totally underrated right now. And like I said, I think we're in the opening innings of this and just financial market infrastructure is fundamentally about providing certainty, providing mechanisms of risk management, and dealing with clearing and settling things, but also dealing with counterparty and counterparty risk. And so much of what the financial market infrastructure does deals with that. For the first time ever, you can actually create systems of that that do not have humans intermediating it, that is totally public and transparent to all market participants, that is extremely efficient, that is open and global, anyone can connect to it. That has ultimately radically lower kind of unit economic costs to market participants in it. That is just so profound. And I think you can take almost every dimension of finance, and you can imagine ways for that to happen in these on chain protocols.
01:08:37.198 - 01:09:13.786, Speaker C: Now there are going to be oracles, I think, identity, identity attestations, so entity attestations, things like this, those become really critical because the real world and the Defi world do need to interact. But as those primitives come into place, I think this can get enormously larger and can disrupt more and more dimensions of what is currently run by banks, currently run by other financial market infrastructure providers as well. So there's a tremendous amount that can happen there, and I think it's underrated.
01:09:13.818 - 01:10:01.370, Speaker B: Right now, there's a common thought that the cryptocurrency industry and DeFi especially exists because it lives on the margins of what is perhaps legally acceptable or compliant. Right, Hazu? I know, famous cryptocurrency thinker iterates that he thinks that one of the main use cases for cryptocurrency is skirting regulation and USDC is flowing permissionlessly through, you know, some protocols are probably totally compliantly fine. Other DeFi protocols are probably more legally dubious. How do you think about this tension between USDC flowing through perhaps legally dubious DeFi protocols?
01:10:02.030 - 01:10:05.246, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think that this.
01:10:05.268 - 01:11:19.122, Speaker E: Is a place where we talked about kind of what regulators care about and where they're focused. And some of this has to do with abuse by potentially criminal actors, things like that. This is going to be the vexing critical issue that faces Defi, which is how can deFi essentially interact with real world identities, and how can real world identities interact with public protocols in a privacy preserving way, in a way that puts greater control into users hands. So to me, that's how we answer these questions. It's not a USDC thing. It's actually kind of these identity metasystems, how are they built for the Internet? When we were getting started with circle, and I was really excited about blockchains as an innovation, the view, from my perspective, was wow. This is the technology that solves two of the fundamental issues, two missing layers of the Internet.
01:11:19.122 - 01:11:43.806, Speaker E: One was money, the other was identity. And I think the identity piece is going to come later. In fact, it needs to come in response to the development of decentralized finance and money on the Internet. And so I think that will be one of the next major phases that gets developed and that's how we'll face those issues at a high level.
01:11:43.988 - 01:12:02.050, Speaker A: Jeremy, it's been a pleasure to get your thoughts on all of these things. One last question for you. A prediction question. How big do you think stablecoins are going to get this market cycle? In particular, USDC? And when are you guys going to flip in tether?
01:12:04.470 - 01:12:13.926, Speaker E: Yeah, it's a good. So if you say this market cycle, what do you have in mind there?
01:12:14.028 - 01:12:18.982, Speaker A: We have in mind that we are in a bull market.
01:12:19.116 - 01:12:19.878, Speaker B: Careful there.
01:12:19.964 - 01:12:20.454, Speaker C: Ahead.
01:12:20.572 - 01:12:34.240, Speaker A: Bull market. And so we're thinking that could last the next year, the next two years, sort of. And all assets will grow along with the bull market. So that kind of time horizon, one to three years.
01:12:34.930 - 01:12:36.560, Speaker C: Yeah, it's interesting.
01:12:37.650 - 01:13:11.180, Speaker E: I think USDC over, say two years, I think it easily exceeds like 50 billion. I think there are scenarios where in particular, if more mainstream financial applications integrate to this and start to utilize it in different ways, it could exceed 100 billion. But it's hard to know. I would have given you a different number six months ago.
01:13:12.910 - 01:13:15.580, Speaker B: Jeremy, do you think tether is here to stay?
01:13:16.910 - 01:13:52.006, Speaker E: I do, actually. There's the classic kind of offshore dollar market, kind of euro dollar market type role. There's significant demand in Asia for shadow banking, for dollar shadow banking. Those markets exist. They're large, they will continue to exist, they'll grow. And so I expect tether to play a critical role in. So I would expect it to absolutely have staying power and continue to grow.
01:13:52.188 - 01:13:57.862, Speaker A: Absolutely. Well, Jeremy, it's been a pleasure to have you on bankless. Thanks so much for joining us.
01:13:57.996 - 01:14:00.070, Speaker C: Thank you guys. Really enjoyed it.
01:14:00.140 - 01:14:31.458, Speaker A: Bankless nation, some action items for you today. One is something that you can do, which is if you haven't already, try out USDC. It is fantastic. I think you will find yourself wanting to move more and more of your funds out of the traditional banking system and into the crypto banking system. USDC is a great gateway for that. Secondly, David and I are now doing debrief episodes. This is for bankless premium subscribers, where it's just David and I's raw, uncut thoughts on the episode we just recorded.
01:14:31.458 - 01:14:50.594, Speaker A: It's about 20 to 30 minutes. Premium subscribers get that after every episode. We'll include a link if you're interested in that, for you to subscribe and get a premium bankless membership. Finally, of course, risks and disclaimers. None of this was financial advice. Crypto is risky. Bitcoin is risky.
01:14:50.594 - 01:15:01.050, Speaker A: ETH is as well. So is Defi. You could lose what you put in. But we're headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone. But thanks for joining us on the backless journey.
