00:00:00.250 - 00:00:00.622, Speaker A: Hey, guys.
00:00:00.676 - 00:00:02.186, Speaker B: This is called a Debrief episode.
00:00:02.218 - 00:00:03.486, Speaker A: It's an episode that David and I.
00:00:03.508 - 00:00:29.766, Speaker B: Record right after the podcast. This one was delayed by a few days. I think it took us a while to catch up after the episode with WorldCoin, but we wanted to release this on the public feed so everyone has access to it. And you can see our thoughts coming out of the conversation with WorldCoin. Usually this debrief is available only for bankless citizens, available on the bankless premium RSS feed. But today we are releasing it publicly. So we hope you enjoy.
00:00:29.766 - 00:00:34.194, Speaker B: This should give you some insight into the conversation we just had with WorldCoin.
00:00:34.242 - 00:00:41.734, Speaker A: Thanks a lot. Hey, guys. Welcome to the Debrief. After the episode that I wasn't on with WorldCoin. Sam altman.
00:00:41.782 - 00:00:43.820, Speaker C: The cool thing about Debriefs is it doesn't matter.
00:00:45.470 - 00:00:46.650, Speaker A: Tell me about it.
00:00:46.800 - 00:01:01.006, Speaker C: We had on Sam Altman and Alex Bolania of WorldCoin. First time Sam Altman's been on the show. First time Alex has been on the, uh so you weren't there. So I have to tell you about what the episode was about.
00:01:01.028 - 00:01:03.566, Speaker A: You guys recorded on Mother's Day. I couldn't be there.
00:01:03.668 - 00:01:08.580, Speaker C: Oh, that's right. That's why you were also it was also Sunday. I don't think you would have yeah.
00:01:08.950 - 00:01:11.154, Speaker A: I probably would have aped out anyway.
00:01:11.272 - 00:01:17.774, Speaker C: Yeah. So it was just a straightforward download on WorldCoin.
00:01:17.822 - 00:01:18.130, Speaker A: Okay.
00:01:18.200 - 00:01:47.774, Speaker C: So for people who hadn't ever heard about WorldCoin before, this would be a great episode for them. Talked a little bit about the drama about Worldcoin's launch, which we actually had not like wasn't like how we had a play in the we had a quick story about the World coin launch way back when because they were going to come on the show. And then their PR company canceled because you sent out the tweet. What the fuck is going on with WorldCoin? And the PR company thought it was hella out. Yeah. You don't remember?
00:01:47.812 - 00:01:49.040, Speaker A: Did you guys bring that up?
00:01:49.490 - 00:01:59.714, Speaker C: Not in the recording, but afterwards, yes. And Alex was like, oh, yeah, we fired those people long ago. They were terrible. And I'm like, thank you.
00:01:59.912 - 00:02:20.726, Speaker A: That's something stupid, man. Okay, so that put a bad taste in my mouth when that happened. The only two times that's happened, actually, besides, like, maybe I won't count Charles from cardano, but Gavin Wood. Okay, right? Gavin Wood polkadot scheduled.
00:02:20.838 - 00:02:21.210, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:02:21.280 - 00:02:31.006, Speaker A: We're like, hey, and then could Gavin come to the podcast? Haven't explored the polkadot ecosystem. And then I think maybe a few.
00:02:31.028 - 00:02:33.774, Speaker C: Days before really close.
00:02:33.892 - 00:02:59.518, Speaker A: Yeah, the comms lead at Polkadot reached out and was, you know, we went back through some of your previous tweets, like years ago. And we don't like what you and Gavin's not going to come on the podcast. So we should cancel this. And tried to substitute someone else at Polkadot in the podcast. And I think I asked for what the offending tweets were. And they were so tame.
00:02:59.614 - 00:03:00.510, Speaker C: There was a week.
00:03:00.600 - 00:03:07.174, Speaker A: It was just so tame. Anyway, that kind of puts a bad taste in my mouth when projects do that.
00:03:07.212 - 00:03:29.246, Speaker C: But I guess they're saying it was a PR firm. It was a PR company. And I knew that it was. We knew that it was because when the PR company canceled on the show, originally on US, I went to Alex just straight on Twitter, and I was like, hey, fuck your PR company. WorldCoin is getting the absolute shit slammed on them right now. The backing away from the public spotlight is this is not the right time.
00:03:29.268 - 00:03:33.680, Speaker A: To everyone is asking the questions that we would ask you on a.
00:03:36.130 - 00:04:01.174, Speaker C: Said I basically said that to Alex in DMs. I was like, you need to ignore your PR company. Just come on. Mainly, A, that was very valid and real and authentic advice, and B, I also did not want to emergency find another good guest. He didn't go for it. Anyways, the cool trivia about that episode is the episode that came out of that was ultra scalable ethereum, which turned out to be an absolute banger.
00:04:01.222 - 00:04:02.870, Speaker A: Oh, the one that we did last minute.
00:04:02.950 - 00:04:03.338, Speaker C: Yes.
00:04:03.424 - 00:04:05.510, Speaker A: We put together agenda.
00:04:05.590 - 00:04:26.398, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. Anyway, so that was the precursor to this whole story. So finally, that had to be over a year ago. That's a long time ago now. WorldCoin is still still around, still building. Has won some hearts and minds to have joined the team and support the effort. Mainly people I respect.
00:04:26.398 - 00:04:29.678, Speaker C: DC Builder. I don't know if you know that name floating around on crypto Twitter.
00:04:29.854 - 00:04:31.310, Speaker A: This is not DC investor.
00:04:31.390 - 00:04:48.680, Speaker C: Not DC investor. DC Builder. Zero knowledge cryptography researcher. Guy that everyone generally trusts and appreciates in the space. He joined WorldCoin. A few other people joined WorldCoin. Optimism and WorldCoin are collaborating on Stack stuff.
00:04:50.170 - 00:05:30.038, Speaker A: I think they still have a major uphill battle about what okay, so let me just say two things about this. One is I am very excited to listen to this episode, actually, and thankless listeners should know I'm coming to the debrief, not having listened to the episode. So you guys are at an advantage to me. So we actually are recording this because schedules david was in Zizalu, and just schedules permitting, we're recording this, I think, like, weeks later, really, this debrief. But I still haven't listened to the episode, and I am excited to listen to it. And I intend to go into this episode with an open mind. I also don't think it will answer all of my questions.
00:05:30.038 - 00:05:33.158, Speaker A: I think it'll be like too high level. It'll be a high level.
00:05:33.244 - 00:05:34.518, Speaker C: We only have 60 minutes.
00:05:34.604 - 00:06:31.094, Speaker A: Yeah, it'll open up the door for other questions. And I think one of my big questions is around sort of probably the privacy of this network, probably how decentralized really is it? Like, how public goodsy is it? How values aligned is it? I'm actually not sure what series of questions this will completely unlock. But I guess I don't want to hear a VC marketing machine tell me these things. I want to hear independent community representatives that people that I respect in privacy and decentralization talk about these things. So that's one part of it. The other part I would say I think that it's just hard. I mean, I said this on the roll up last week, David, but the crypto bros want to orb.
00:06:31.094 - 00:06:32.378, Speaker A: You right.
00:06:32.544 - 00:06:33.660, Speaker C: It's not great.
00:06:35.950 - 00:07:19.562, Speaker A: To capture identity and who's behind it. It's the guy who's building the most powerful AI in the world, sam Altman. And I don't know, that's an uphill marketing battle, I think, and maybe it should be. If you're going to do something of this type of magnitude and make these types of vision commitments, then I think you owe the world a commensurate level of transparency, auditability openness. That's a pretty high bar to me.
00:07:19.696 - 00:07:57.234, Speaker C: And they say all of that stuff is on their roadmap, they say, and I'm a trusting individual, I tend to believe them. I think there are some projects out there that are very in the crypto world that are very beloved. Like Gitcoin comes to mind, protocol guild optimism, I would say has some of this WorldCoin has the opposite of that. It's like, what is the opposite of beloved? I don't know. But it's easy to hate WorldCoin just by a nature of what it is, which is like, if you trust WorldCoin and believe WorldCoin, then it's like totally unfair because they're doing the same thing.
00:07:57.272 - 00:08:14.198, Speaker A: It's just said so you just said, David, you're a trusting individual. Why are you a trusting individual? After all the shit we've gone through in why? Why would you trust anybody in this space to do any I was a.
00:08:14.204 - 00:08:19.670, Speaker C: Trusting individual before crypto, first off. And so hasn't crypto individual my disposition.
00:08:20.370 - 00:08:58.482, Speaker A: Hasn't crypto kind of, like, shown you to be less trusting in some? Cases, particularly when you have sort of the setup of large VC allocation. A coin super ambitious. Kind of promises lots of ways to cut corners. WorldCoin could be fantastic. I have no idea. But I'm just saying the pattern fits many patterns we've seen in the past of this not working out very well. And I think that's what the white blood cells, the immune system of crypto is just kind of like indiscriminately attacking.
00:08:58.482 - 00:09:33.940, Speaker A: And I think if you want to get more precise in the white blood cells, you really have to go dive deep. Most people don't have time to do that, including myself, honestly, I'm going to be relying on third party privacy researchers, people in the crypto community I trust. I'm going to be able to do levels of due diligence, but I can't vet this thing from the ground up anyway. This trust, why should we trust what they say at all? Why shouldn't we default posture to like, oh, this is a bunch of then, you know, work our way out of.
00:09:35.030 - 00:10:26.706, Speaker C: I will. I'm not going to make the case for why one should trust WorldCoin, but I will make the argument for let's see okay, let me just say that start that again. I'm not saying that you should trust WorldCoin, but here is the argument for why you could why there are some green flags here that are different from all of the 2022 mess that we don't want to go back to. One is like the idea, if you accept that the idea that biometric scanning is the most civil resistant mechanism to produce proof of humanity, then you get something like the Orb. And so you can start to cast away the negative connotation that iris scanning and the Orb has, which is like a source of distrust. It's just like the whole aesthetics of the whole thing. So you can try and shave that from your brain.
00:10:26.706 - 00:10:52.730, Speaker C: Then there's like okay, VC allocation, serializing humans, all that kind of stuff. Do you trust Sam Altman? What does Sam Altman have in it? That 3 hours capital. Or Doe, kwan or SPF. He just doesn't fit those types and neither does Alex Blania. Right? Maybe if Alex Blania was loud on Twitter.
00:10:53.870 - 00:10:55.318, Speaker A: They're not populous.
00:10:55.494 - 00:11:16.990, Speaker C: They're not populous, right? Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So there's not that right. It doesn't seem like a get rich quick scheme. They actually have a roadmap to produce something uniquely valuable and unique in and of itself to crypto. I don't think it maps onto the whole things that we should map onto.
00:11:17.070 - 00:11:51.310, Speaker A: Like a VC coin, VC alternative layer one that we've seen so many times. I know it's not actually an alternative layer one, so that alone makes it kind of different. But we've seen many just ridiculously funded alternative layer ones that kind of go liquid and then you just sort of get this feeling and kind of see in the data that the VCs just dump on you once it gets into the market and they don't really go anywhere. They don't have product market fit. It just feels like corporate top down. It doesn't feel organic. There's no builders, there's no community.
00:11:51.310 - 00:12:17.538, Speaker A: And so I guess where that usually turns into is not an outright scam but just like, I don't know, exit you. You become exit liquidity in some cases for VCs and then it becomes sort of a zombie chain which is not like the worst outcome, that's not like a SBF FTX style outcome or a lunatera outcome, but it's not a great outcome.
00:12:17.714 - 00:12:44.314, Speaker C: So it is heavily VC weighted. There's two ways to approach VC weighting. There are the easy, like yo, let's fork, ethereum fork the EVM which the Ethereum researchers have been building for almost a decade now, more than a decade now. And then let's raise on it and then keep all the tokens for ourselves and dump on the followers. So get other people to do the lift work. Pump the token ourselves with our VC marketing dollars and then dump. So not much work.
00:12:44.314 - 00:12:50.802, Speaker C: A lot of upside. The WorldCoin project is a ton of work. Is a ton of work.
00:12:50.936 - 00:12:56.370, Speaker A: It's not like a fork. It's not like a MeToo of something the VC raise.
00:12:56.710 - 00:13:25.878, Speaker C: The VC dollars are legitimate because there's no way that they could get the orb mass produced in a way that other people can produce the orb. And there's no way that they could get people to scan other eyeballs that aren't in the world coin employees. That whole lift side of things requires VC dollars. It's very legitimate use of a capital raise. And then that just checks out to me. You need VC money for?
00:13:25.904 - 00:13:39.794, Speaker A: It still doesn't fit the mold of a typical VC exit scam kind of thing. And I put Scam in quotations because it's usually just ghost chain, low product market fit where you become exit liquidity if you buy this particular token. But you don't have to, right?
00:13:39.832 - 00:13:44.434, Speaker C: And also, the point of WorldCoin isn't even the token. Like that's one of three points.
00:13:44.552 - 00:13:45.960, Speaker A: What are the three points?
00:13:47.050 - 00:13:59.702, Speaker C: Proof of humanhood. The coin. And I'm missing one. Maybe it's just two. I feel like there's world. ID. There's the World App, which I think is pretty similar to World ID.
00:13:59.702 - 00:14:03.882, Speaker C: It's like, yeah, it's the wallet, your authentication. But I guess that's pretty similar to world ID.
00:14:03.936 - 00:14:06.060, Speaker A: This is built on a L2, right?
00:14:06.430 - 00:14:11.574, Speaker C: So right now they're deploying on Op mainnet and eventually they will make Op stack chain.
00:14:11.702 - 00:14:17.038, Speaker A: And so this will be their own sort of will it be like a layer three type chain or it'll be.
00:14:17.044 - 00:14:18.570, Speaker C: An independent op stack chain.
00:14:18.650 - 00:14:20.858, Speaker A: Independent op stack chain, which in theory.
00:14:20.954 - 00:14:23.006, Speaker C: Fits into the Optimism super chain model.
00:14:23.108 - 00:14:25.220, Speaker A: I mean, that's kind of cool, right? Yeah.
00:14:27.750 - 00:14:42.114, Speaker C: As an op stack chain, the app. So it's like an app specific chain. And what does that app specific chain do? It provides proof of humanhood the world coin way to the op super chain which is eventually just ethereum.
00:14:42.162 - 00:15:19.166, Speaker A: And by the way, the reason I'm coming in a little hotter in this is because I think this is how the white these are the questions. I guess maybe we don't have necessarily full, satisfactory answers on what you just raised already. But I think you are offering some valid points of how this kind of breaks the pattern typical pattern that we've seen. That's all I'm doing right now. And I think that's what the crypto community is doing pattern recognition. But There's This Third Kind Of Negative Pattern that I Think People see, and that is The Figure Of Sam Altman, which is like, all Right, Tech bro, I Put Him In Quotations. Billionaire.
00:15:19.166 - 00:15:24.786, Speaker A: I don't even know if he's a billionaire. I heard him go in front of billionaire. Okay, but he went in front.
00:15:24.888 - 00:15:27.150, Speaker C: He quacks like one in Congress.
00:15:27.230 - 00:15:31.334, Speaker A: I mean, he has no equity in open. Like, I just don't even know how this works.
00:15:31.452 - 00:15:47.082, Speaker C: Yeah, he has no equity in OpenAI. I think that you can't necessarily take that at face value because he could have no equity in OpenAI, and then OpenAI could get liquidity and then he could get like a billion dollar garha OpenAI. So there's like roundabout ways where that doesn't really matter.
00:15:47.136 - 00:17:04.258, Speaker A: He feels like the Mark Zuckerberg of the 2020s in that he has created this technology that is clearly going to change everything about the fabric of the way humans organize and interact in Open. AI. Right, and now we're at a phase, I think, in the world where tech bros from Silicon Valley are all kind of grouped into this parasitic extractor type of motif. And some people might think that's fair, some people might think that's unfair. I think the majority of society, though, just doesn't trust that sort of individual at this point in time. And so I guess a question to you is, or maybe just a question to mull over is like, is this guy legit or is this guy going to be somewhat evil or somewhat influenced by Molok traps and all of the things that we've seen tech billionaires get influenced by leading to bad outcomes for society. I guess the question is, can you really trust Sam Altman? Is what it comes down to.
00:17:04.424 - 00:17:36.842, Speaker C: So, yeah, the archetype of the web two extractor, the Zuck web two idea. I'm reminded of this quote from Sam Harris where he was talking about how everyone is like, there are fewer people and there's a modern movement to ignore expertise. Just like, oh, experts are wrong, they're all wrong. Experts told you to wear masks and they're wrong. And so he was throwing a flag at that whole movement that's going on in the intellectualism. Yeah, exactly.
00:17:36.896 - 00:17:37.126, Speaker A: Okay.
00:17:37.168 - 00:18:07.990, Speaker C: And he's like, the way that society progresses is like, there are experts and then they say things and then we prove those experts wrong. That's how society moves forward. But who actually proves experts wrong? Other experts like more experts, not the masses. And so to carry over this analogy, zuckerberg is the old expert, Sam Altman. Who knows if he's a better, newer expert who proves the old archetype wrong. But as me, as a trusting individual, I would like to leave that door open. That the way through.
00:18:07.990 - 00:18:30.240, Speaker C: That bad branding for VC tech bro founder innovator type is actually we find one that does good for the world who fixes the like, it's not going to be like the average Joe that solves proof of humanity, proof of humanhood in the AI world. It's going to be a VC tech pro. That's why he's a VC tech pro. That's how you solve these problems.
00:18:30.610 - 00:18:33.006, Speaker A: What was your impression of him during the conversation?
00:18:33.118 - 00:18:35.282, Speaker C: I'm slowly liking him more and more and more.
00:18:35.336 - 00:18:37.060, Speaker A: Why? What do you like about him?
00:18:40.550 - 00:18:59.638, Speaker C: He seems authentic. He seems nice. He's not running away from the alignment problem. If he is good in the front and then bad in the back. He is a world class sociopath.
00:18:59.814 - 00:19:05.398, Speaker A: What does the AI safety community think about this mean? I know Elizir. Yudkowski.
00:19:05.414 - 00:19:06.154, Speaker C: I don't know.
00:19:06.272 - 00:19:09.690, Speaker A: Elizkowski has, like, burned down all the GPUs.
00:19:10.190 - 00:19:11.142, Speaker C: He's an extremist.
00:19:11.206 - 00:19:24.422, Speaker A: Okay. But I'm surprised that safety. Hmm. I haven't really seen AI safety and alignment groups come out and, like, torch OpenAI or Sam Altman very publicly.
00:19:24.586 - 00:19:27.650, Speaker C: Anyone, right? They don't have torch anyone.
00:19:27.800 - 00:19:48.630, Speaker A: Is that sort of happening? Or is there the general impression in AI alignment communities that, hey, while OpenAI is not perfect, they've done a fairly good job so far, and they're not completely ignoring safety, they're still trying to remain competitive.
00:19:50.090 - 00:19:59.020, Speaker C: OpenAI has an alignment division inside of them and apparently contribute to this world.
00:19:59.470 - 00:20:49.698, Speaker A: Well, there's another factor of why people are scared, and that's just because these tech billionaires are so powerful. These like, how powerful is Mark Zuckerberg at this point? How powerful is the individual who is masterminding Open? AI. Right, and now you're doing decentralized identity as well. You're doing WorldCoin as well. I think that unnerves people. One thing I'd say, though, because this has been somewhat me throwing lobbing grenades and criticisms, what is the alternative to decentralized identity? That is the threshold to cross is like, basically what we're going to be left with is some sort of nation state digital identity, right? That's all we have. I mean, India already has that deployed now, and that is completely centralized.
00:20:49.698 - 00:21:13.154, Speaker A: Now, you might argue, well, this is probably the Rowan Gray argument. Well, yeah, of course. Decentralized identity, it's gray. It's a democratic nation state sort of proposing this and putting this forward. And so that's a great thing. But that is definitely centralized technology. And I do think that is the only viable alternative that we've seen.
00:21:13.154 - 00:21:31.834, Speaker A: For all of the decentralized identity experiments in crypto so far, none of them have really taken off. So as long as this thing is better than that or different enough than that, it feels like a worthwhile experiment to keep running. Like, what's the downside, I guess would be my question.
00:21:32.032 - 00:21:58.370, Speaker C: That's where I go back to the claim that biometric scanning is the best form of sibling resistance. I don't know, there's probably some measure of truth or falsity to that. But still, there's a reason why we do biometric scanning. So turning biometric scanning into proof of humanhood, I think, is a noble endeavor. And so that is why I am categorizing myself as a WorldCoin apologist.
00:21:59.030 - 00:22:11.106, Speaker A: Wait, you'd say a world coin apologist? Yeah, apologist means, like, you're fighting for coin, like, you are evangelizing for WorldCoin. You are sort of making the argument.
00:22:11.218 - 00:22:17.880, Speaker C: I'm just saying that the existence of WorldCoin is not the thing to be upset about.
00:22:18.570 - 00:22:41.630, Speaker A: I guess my take is, and this might be a more moderate take, I'm just open minded, I think that sometimes the crypto white blood cells attack too hard and destroy things without good reason. And so I am pretty open minded about this one and excited to see how it plays out. When are you going to get Orbed, David?
00:22:41.970 - 00:22:43.310, Speaker C: I'm not getting orbed.
00:22:44.770 - 00:22:48.114, Speaker A: If you're an apologist though, you have to get Orbed at some point.
00:22:48.312 - 00:22:52.206, Speaker C: I will get Orbed when I need to do something that requires me getting Orbbed.
00:22:52.238 - 00:22:56.094, Speaker A: What's the benefit of getting Orbed anyway? Is it just you get World coins?
00:22:56.222 - 00:22:59.134, Speaker C: Yeah, you get World coins sooner. You get a distribution of World coins.
00:22:59.182 - 00:23:03.480, Speaker A: And that the idea, is that World coins, like any crypto token, appreciate in value over time.
00:23:04.090 - 00:23:38.910, Speaker C: Yes. Sam Owlman actually talked about that on the podcast explicitly. Like, yeah, why never go up? So the interesting thing about WorldCoin is that not only is it the currency that might be Gooze, but it might also be like a graph for things like airdrops or distributions. So if WorldCoin as a distribution mechanism becomes legitimately, decentralized and distributed to humans equally all over the planet, then it becomes a very good graph to distribute other things to remember. You read Bill Bowder's book? Red notice.
00:23:38.990 - 00:23:39.620, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:23:40.070 - 00:24:11.660, Speaker C: So there was a big problem when the Soviet Russia went from communists to capitalists, how did they distribute the equity of the companies to the people of Russia? And so they gave out these vouchers things to people like, if there was WorldCoin, they would have just been airdropped. Here's the equity of the company to the citizens of Russia. Right. It's just like a legitimate mapping of equity and capital. It's like the most legitimately distributed asset of all time is the thesis that they're going after.
00:24:12.270 - 00:24:14.806, Speaker A: Why WorldCoin? Why are they calling this thing WorldCoin?
00:24:14.918 - 00:24:17.260, Speaker C: I don't know.
00:24:17.970 - 00:24:23.200, Speaker A: All right, well, open minded and then when's this thing launching? Did you find that out?
00:24:24.290 - 00:24:26.110, Speaker C: They do not have a public date yet.
00:24:26.180 - 00:24:29.838, Speaker A: Okay, well, I do know that it's.
00:24:29.854 - 00:24:31.954, Speaker C: Not like one thing that launches, it rolls out over time.
00:24:31.992 - 00:24:39.160, Speaker A: Do you know our editor, Luke, of Bankless newsletter? He got Orbed actually, on Thursday, New York City.
00:24:40.650 - 00:24:41.186, Speaker C: Luma?
00:24:41.218 - 00:24:42.146, Speaker A: Yeah, luma got orbed.
00:24:42.178 - 00:24:42.946, Speaker C: Luma got orbed.
00:24:42.978 - 00:24:46.550, Speaker A: Yeah, he went to the offices and got Orbed as a test.
00:24:46.620 - 00:24:47.282, Speaker C: No shit.
00:24:47.346 - 00:24:50.166, Speaker A: Yeah. So I haven't debriefed with him.
00:24:50.188 - 00:24:54.140, Speaker C: Is it going to be like the what was that Dr. Seuss book, star Belly Sneaches or whatever?
00:24:54.510 - 00:24:56.714, Speaker A: Orbs. If you're Orbed or if you're not.
00:24:56.752 - 00:24:58.140, Speaker C: Yeah, if you've been Orbed or.
00:25:00.430 - 00:25:06.030, Speaker A: Just I feel like they could have done something different in the marketing, but maybe there's no other way. World coin.
00:25:06.370 - 00:25:25.518, Speaker C: That's what I was thinking about. Like okay, so once you commit to the biometric scanning thesis, then you conclude this is outside of just crypto stuff, then you conclude that irises are the most legitimate biometric scanning technology. So you are scanning irises. If you believe in biometric scanning, you believe in scanning irises.
00:25:25.534 - 00:25:27.540, Speaker A: So you're saying there's no way to make that.
00:25:28.070 - 00:25:49.260, Speaker C: How do you make a thing that is mass produceable so that we can capture 8 billion irises. Like, what shape do you put that in? You want it to be a box because the box isn't much better. Do you want to dress it up like a teddy bear? Because that's kind of worse. How do you do it? How do you do it in a way that doesn't make people squirm? It's not possible.
00:25:51.150 - 00:26:01.760, Speaker A: Maybe. Could you do it? Yeah, it's probably not possible. If you have to have an independent hardware device, you can't create an app for it or something like this, right? Yeah. Well, you know what?
00:26:02.370 - 00:26:14.162, Speaker C: Once you make its own device, it has to be custom. It can't look like anything else. How do you do it? I still think a chrome orb is like as good as idea as any.
00:26:14.216 - 00:26:56.994, Speaker A: I still think that even though this is very well funded, given the names and given kind of the ambition as well it kind of should be, I still think that the most likely scenario of a product like this is it doesn't reach product market fit. Right. And I just say that because that's generally what happens with startups. This is the startup phase and so maybe I think a few things to watch is like how's traction going? Is it able to resist civil attacks or not? That's a huge know, I guess how many new IDs are they getting over it's? Stuff like that. I think that will the big question.
00:26:57.032 - 00:27:06.280, Speaker C: Is because Sam Altman is doing this because the world of AI is coming and so I think without the world of AI wait, why?
00:27:06.730 - 00:27:08.278, Speaker A: Because you need to prove who the.
00:27:08.284 - 00:27:33.806, Speaker C: Humans are on the internet. Yeah. And so WorldCoin without AI I don't think has much legs. I think Sam Altman is going to simultaneously produce the need for WorldCoin using OpenAI and that has actually been his plan all along. He's like, first I need I'm going to make OpenAI and then there's going to be AIS everywhere. Oh, then we're going to need to figure out who the humans are. So I'm also going to make this World coin thing.
00:27:33.988 - 00:27:38.062, Speaker A: I create the problem and also the solution. You can see how this gets.
00:27:38.116 - 00:27:40.798, Speaker C: Very good business model.
00:27:40.884 - 00:27:51.120, Speaker A: Yeah. Anyway to be determined. We'll see. I would definitely be great to have Sam on the podcast again and talk about AI stuff as well. But I'm sure we'll get into that some.
00:27:51.570 - 00:27:55.070, Speaker C: He's going to owe the world a handful of conversations.
00:27:55.450 - 00:28:02.340, Speaker A: Well, Bankless Nation, let us know what you think of WorldCoin and this conversation. As always, we appreciate you being Bankless Citizen. Thanks a lot.
