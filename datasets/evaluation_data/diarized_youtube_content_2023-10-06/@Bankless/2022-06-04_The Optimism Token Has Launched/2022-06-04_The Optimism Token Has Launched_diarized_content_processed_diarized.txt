00:00:00.170 - 00:00:20.970, Speaker A: Optimism airdrop. Summer people got their tokens. The optimism token is launched with a total supply of 4.3 billion tokens, inflating at 2% a year. And the Airdrop went to almost a quarter million addresses. For comparison, Ryan Uniswap was just 2000 more addresses larger than optimism, coming in at 251 500. That's great distribution.
00:00:20.970 - 00:00:36.546, Speaker A: The op tokens have some value. We should note that. Yeah. At the time of recording it at $1.0.57, coming in at a fully diluted valuation of $6.7 billion. It's airdrop season, so stop being depressed about the market, pick your head up and go start exploring.
00:00:36.546 - 00:00:49.170, Speaker A: Because there's so many airdrops left. Not only optimism airdrop number two, number three, number n, but there's also the application tokens. And so if you want some of these airdrops, you got to go be on the optimism land, because that's where the surface area is for all the airdrops.
