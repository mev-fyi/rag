00:00:02.090 - 00:00:38.866, Speaker A: Bankless Nation. We got an extra show for you today here we got a panel of cross chain experts. We got Zachie Manion from Cosmos. We got Steven Goldtter from Arbitrum and New to Bankless sergey Gorbanov from Axelar. Axilar is a newer IBC chain on the scene. It's been around for a while, but it's new to me and it is working on interchange composability. So not only is the world of Cosmos and IPZ chains a world of interoperable mesh network of Cosmos layer ones, but also Axlar specifically is working on interoperability beyond the IBC realm.
00:00:38.866 - 00:01:25.270, Speaker A: And so the announcement going out today is that Axelar's new technology, what they are calling general message passing, is connecting the world of Arbitrum to the world of Cosmos, which is why Stephen Goldfeather from Arbitrum is on this panel as well. So previously we have been skeptical at Bankless about cross chain bridges. Generally, the position that everyone that we've seen so far is fundamentally insecure. And I am still cautiously optimistic about Axelr. But there is a lot of new technology that they are bringing to the table. And so they are able to produce what seems to be a meaningful integration between Cosmos and Arbitrum that has both communities pretty excited. And according to Sergey from Axelr, the interconnections between different chains doesn't stop there.
00:01:25.270 - 00:02:07.554, Speaker A: Because if you can connect the IBC language of Cosmos to the EVM language of Ethereum, you can actually kind of connect any languages from any blockchain. Or at least that's the idea. And so if you are into the world of the many layer one landscape with bridges connecting all these things, this episode is definitely for you. And so we are going to get right into that conversation with Zackie, Steven and Sergey. But first, before we talk to Zackie, Steven and Sergey on this show, we're going to talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible, especially Kraken, our strategic sponsor for 2023, who, if no matter what chain you choose or no matter what asset you prefer, it's all on Kraken.

00:04:44.002 - 00:04:50.198, Speaker A: Bankless Nation. We have two returning guests and one new one, Zackie Mannion from Cosmos. Zackie, welcome back to the show.
00:04:50.284 - 00:04:51.658, Speaker D: It's great to be here.
00:04:51.824 - 00:04:55.258, Speaker A: And Stephen goldfeather from Arbitrum. What's up, Steven? How's it going?
00:04:55.424 - 00:04:57.354, Speaker E: Great to be here. Thanks for having me.
00:04:57.552 - 00:05:07.550, Speaker A: And also the new entrant into the Bankless Nation. We have Sergey Gorvonov from Axilar, and this is the center of this announcement. Sergey. Welcome to Bankless.
00:05:08.370 - 00:05:09.920, Speaker B: Hey, good to be here.
00:05:10.450 - 00:05:31.640, Speaker A: So today we're talking about chains and bridges and a particular new type of expressive bridge that Axelar is bringing to the table. So, Sergey, since you're the new one of the bunch to the Bankless podcast, could you just explain a little bit about Axelar, what it is, and you can just tee us up for this announcement that we are going to be talking about here on this episode today?
00:05:32.730 - 00:06:08.050, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. High level accelerator is the network that connects other networks, right? So it's a decentralized blockchain technology that allows you to connect different layer ones and layer twos and send information across them, right? And so we build kind of a full stack of interoperability that allows you to compose your applications across different ecosystems, right? So you can have smart contracts on one chain, talk to smart contracts on another chain, and really enable kind of very simple developer and user experience to interact with multi chain ecosystem that we live in now. Right? And so Axela is a decentralized layer that enables a lot of this functionalities.
00:06:08.710 - 00:06:21.720, Speaker A: And Axilar is a Cosmos IBC chain. And so, like many of the other Cosmos IBC chains, it just fits right in into that mesh network landscape of Cosmos chains, correct?
00:06:23.530 - 00:06:24.134, Speaker B: That's right.
00:06:24.172 - 00:06:24.326, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:06:24.348 - 00:06:42.890, Speaker B: So Axel is powered by kind of a tenderman, right? And a lot of the rules around the consensus have been customized to go beyond Cosmos, right? So be able to connect different ecosystems like ethereum, like layer ones, like Arbitrum, optimism, and so on and so forth, and kind of really be the connector across different software language stacks.
00:06:43.650 - 00:07:03.140, Speaker A: Right. So this is where the explanation for Axilar kind of gets a little funny, because we have Cosmos, which is a network of chains, and then we have Axilar, which is supposed to connect the Cosmos network of chains to other chains. So can you just open up that can of worms and help explain that a little bit?
00:07:04.550 - 00:08:01.910, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. I mean, I think Cosmos has been built with interoperability mindset at its core, right? And so kind of IBC protocol can be used quite well to connect a lot of the Cosmos ecosystems, right? But the reason IBC works and everything else is because the Cosmos DAC has been designed with interoperability in mind, right? So IBC is kind of a very native to the Cosmos ecosystem. All of the chains speak the same language, and so IBC helps you put packets back and forth across them. Now, if you want to go outside of Cosmos to EVM chains, to Arbitrum and so on and so forth, you have to speak a different language, and you have to have a different protocol in mind to connect those chains. And so this is where Axela comes in. So our protocol can be used to connect an arbitrary EVM stack and then be able to compose those ecosystems with each other and with other Cosmos chains. And you can think of Axela acting as a sort of a translation layer in that process.
00:08:01.910 - 00:08:22.240, Speaker B: Right. So you have messages or transactions that can be executed on EDM chains, that can be translated into the packet formats, or messages that can be executed on Cosmos chains and vice versa. Right. And so Axela allows you to connect these software stack that speak very different languages and unite them together.
00:08:23.170 - 00:08:42.370, Speaker A: So previously, generally on Bankless, we were critical of cross layer one bridges, generally as a form factor, we kind of think as a structural pattern that they are insecure. They tend to kind of collapse down to just a multi SIG. So how is Axilar different in that respect?
00:08:43.910 - 00:09:00.314, Speaker B: Yeah, so Conaxla is one of the very few networks that are fully decentralized and powers interoperability, right? So it's powered by tendermint. It's an open, validator set. Anybody can participate, anybody can join. And security is something we took very seriously, kind of from the ground up.
00:09:00.352 - 00:09:00.506, Speaker D: Right.
00:09:00.528 - 00:09:41.346, Speaker B: So at the core networking layer, the network is decentralized. It has robust security policies like quadratic loading for processing cross chain requests, validator key rotations and so on and so forth. So that's sort of the base layer, right? It's a very secure, very decentralized network on top of it. If you're thinking about security for Crosschain, you have to have very robust engineering practices, right. So everything from we've done over 40 audits on the network, right? Multimillion dollar bug bounties, lots of rigors like unit tests and so on and so forth. So you have to have the operational excellence, right, if you want to ship anything cross chain. And finally, what I call is like application layer security add ons.
00:09:41.378 - 00:09:41.574, Speaker C: Right.
00:09:41.612 - 00:10:45.210, Speaker B: So if you are transferring value between chains, then in your code or in your functionality, you maybe want to have things like rate limits that would prevent worst case disaster attacks at the networking layer. So that's how we think about security, kind of a from the ground up, full stack approach, making sure you have multiple robustness protocols in place throughout it, and the end of it can be actually a very secure and scalable architecture. And the final point I'll mention, there kind of a new paradigms, things like general message passing that we have a lot of applications building with actually enable you to build different class of applications that don't rely on explicitly token bridges, right? Don't rely on token transfer in particular. And those designs can be a lot more secure and we can go into the details of it. But I'd say that's the new wave of how Crosschain applications will be built out is using kind of general message passing paradigms that enable a very new architecture and design space that's more secure by default.
00:10:46.270 - 00:10:59.438, Speaker A: And that's the subject matter of the announcement that's going out of Axlar today. Correct. That is the big thing. So there's a big thing happening there's an announcement that Axlar is making. It's called sommelier. Is that correct?
00:10:59.604 - 00:11:00.634, Speaker D: Sommelier.
00:11:00.762 - 00:11:12.578, Speaker A: Sommelier. I'm not French. Sommelier should be. So, Zachy, maybe I'll turn to you since you're the one wearing the Sommelier shirt. What is this announcement? And technically, what does it do?
00:11:12.664 - 00:11:53.918, Speaker D: Yeah. So, co founder of Somalier. Somalier is a project that I started with Christy, my co founder, back in sort of early 2021, right around the time when IBC was launching. But it's been a passion project about the combination of Ethereum DFI and EVM, DFI and Cosmos tech. So the idea was to build a decentralized, active strategy manager. So essentially, think of it as Urine 2.0. It was like, you want to because urine strategies, anyone who's used them has seen a pattern.
00:11:53.918 - 00:12:37.934, Speaker D: You start out APYs are really high. As more money comes into them, the returns get diluted, and you've got to pivot to the next year in strategy. And it's just sort of this sort of endless process. And So wanted to build a protocol for strategies that adapt, evolve over the time, but didn't give up decentralization. And it was always sort of a core value for me that we wouldn't be Bridging tokens. Bridging tokens super hard to do well and a lot of risk, right? There's all this risk associated with it. But what we realized is by Bridging essentially data and rebalances, like sort of trades, we could manage the trades on the Cosmos side.
00:12:37.934 - 00:13:17.638, Speaker D: So you could have strategy signal providers that are DeFi experts talking to validators those validators agree and process proposed trades before they happen. They agree, and it gets bridged over. So we've been using our own bridge for over a year to run our strategies. And we have two strategies right now that collectively have about 17 million TVL. We have the best stablecoin yield on Ethereum Real yield USD, and the best ETH denominated yield on Ethereum real yield ETH. These two strategies are these adaptive market adaptive strategies. They can scale.
00:13:17.638 - 00:14:29.700, Speaker D: They can allocate into multiple strategies. They don't have to compromise decentralization for this, and they never bridge the tokens. So you aren't taking this security risk of the bridge when you use the system. But the hottest place to be in DeFi right now, where all of our strategists are like, how can we get on Arbitrum? When can we get on Arbitrum? It's clearly the coolest, hottest place to be in DeFi, right? Most protocols, most exciting stuff, lots of volume, lots of TVL. And so been looking for what would be the right way of doing that. And have been keeping an eye on Axilar for a long time and realized that this composability between IBC and EVM was possible and realized we could, in a very short order, get access to the ability to run our strategies, sommelier strategies on Arbitrum and many other EVM. People don't really know this about me that I've been building this massive, like, a very large scale, very sophisticated ethereum project.
00:14:29.700 - 00:15:09.840, Speaker D: We just joined the ERC 4626 alliance. I'm basically an D Five Maxi at this point and love using it. This was, like, huge enabling technology, and I think it took us basically two years to get Sommelier to full maturity and a lot of money and a lot of time. But the next generation of builders, the builders who come after all of this, can just use Axilar and immediately take combine Cosmos tech and ETH tech to build something like bigger, better, amazing in months.
00:15:11.090 - 00:15:57.038, Speaker A: Okay, so my understanding of this so far is that Axelar Cosmos IBC chain fits right into the Cosmos IBC ecosystem, and then we have Arbitrum with this very vibrant DeFi ecosystem on the other side, and these things are disparate. They are disconnected. While Axilar does have cross chain communication capabilities, I don't think that they are meaningfully differentiated from the cross chain bridges that Bankless has previously been concerned about. But this is when Sommelier I might have to do that a third time psalm. But this is where Psalm comes in and changes the game. Correct. So just at a high level brushstroke, that's what we're talking about.
00:15:57.124 - 00:16:01.950, Speaker D: Is that a way to I mean well, we're like, the first of what is a category of applications, right?
00:16:02.020 - 00:16:02.302, Speaker A: Okay.
00:16:02.356 - 00:16:44.378, Speaker D: I don't think the bridge applications of tomorrow and today really look like the bridge applications of the past. The bridges of the past were like, okay, I want to go ape into this high APY ghoul on some weird chain. I'm going to bridge my stable coins or my other coins over. And that's been the Bridging experience of the last two years. What Sommelier is, is like, no, we're getting you the best ETH native yield. We're going to get you the best Arbitrum native yields. We're going to get you the best we're not sucking your liquidity into some new ecosystem.
00:16:44.378 - 00:17:08.680, Speaker D: We're making your liquidity more effective, more efficient, more powerful where it's natively. So for Arbitrum native DeFi protocols like the Gmxs, the Options protocols, the Camelot DEXes of the world, we're building optimized experiences there using the cross chain tech.
00:17:09.210 - 00:17:21.210, Speaker A: Okay, so I think I misspoke so Sommelier is a DeFi app. It's in the application layer. And so I misspoke when I said that it is the thing doing the magical Bridging.
00:17:21.870 - 00:17:32.720, Speaker D: The magical bridging is Axor. We are the application layer of and we are the application layer that's really highlighting what can be done.
00:17:33.890 - 00:17:37.200, Speaker A: Sergey, where is this go for?
00:17:38.850 - 00:18:37.138, Speaker B: I mean, just to add to that, right. So traditional acceler's been kind of composing Cosmos and a lot of EVM chains for one of the exciting applications was the Bridging moving tokens around. Right. And I think, like Zach said, I think moving tokens around is cute, but we kind of turned humans into manual routers that they have to move their tokens back and forth just to use one application. Right. And so I think what we're doing with the upgrade for the general message passing? What it means is that you can have applications on Cosmos, you can have applications on Arbitrum that can talk to one another by issuing contract calls and sending messages, right? And so what that enables you is to have liquidity wherever you want it to be, but manage the contracts and compose the applications in the same way as you could compose them if they were all like, on Arbitrum. Right? But certain applications could not be built on a layer one or layer two on its own, like Samalier, it needs its own validator set.
00:18:37.138 - 00:18:59.110, Speaker B: It has its own security model and things like that. So those need, like, separate stacks, but now they can have the same level of composability with all the applications and all the liquidity on these chains as if they were actually residing there. So I think that's the exciting part. And that's the general message passenger paradigm, right? That we kind of open it up between these two software stacks.
00:18:59.930 - 00:19:48.322, Speaker A: So I was talking to Zachie before the show, and we were talking about just like, the war against non interoperability. And I called it like a front, right? A front that we need to advance in order to create interoperability. And there's like, marginal improvements. You get across chain bridges, you get some language efficiencies, you get to improve. And so I was trying to weight the magnitude of what is being announced today, which is just to make it really specific, axlar's general Messaging passaging is the announcement that we are talking today, the GMP. And so the answer that he gave me was like, I was trying to measure it between a small incremental step and a breakthrough that we've never seen before in the world of crypto economics. And so I'll throw that question to you, to Sergey.
00:19:48.322 - 00:20:04.430, Speaker A: The general gist I'm getting is like, this is a large step forward. It's not like a zero to one breakthrough moment that we have totally upended the world of crypto economics, but this is not just an incremental improvement. Help me understand how big of a deal this is for the world of cross chain interoperability.
00:20:05.890 - 00:21:04.714, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think this is the first time where you can have very two different software stacks, like EVM stack and a Cosmos stack, being fully composable with one another through Axel and through the general Message pass on EVM land. It's much easier to compose things. And Axel have been doing, like, DJNO message passing there, but across different software stacks like Cosmos. And know, it's much harder to know. Like Zach said, they sort of spent kind of two years building the initial version that connected to Ethereum, right? So how do you do that for all the chains, for all the Cosmos and all the EVM chains? And that's what we've done with a very simple architecture. So what I view it as a step forward to have better developer and better user experiences where people don't have to think about Bridging, don't have to think about moving their tokens. That would in turn enable us to have more users in the ecosystem.
00:21:04.714 - 00:21:37.078, Speaker B: Because I think right now it's very painful. If you like to play with an application, oh, it's on a different chain. Oh, let me find a bridge, let me move my token. It's a different token. Oh, I need a wallet, I need to pay gas across all of those things. So all that stuff we can remove away, right? And so if you're a user of Samlier, you can just interact with Arbitrum and vice versa. If you have an application on Arbitrum, you want to submit a request, and that request needs to be executed in an application in a Cosmos ecosystem, you'll be able to do that so much, much simpler user experience, much better liquidity properties.
00:21:37.078 - 00:21:39.660, Speaker B: I think that's what it all is able to do.
00:21:40.510 - 00:22:39.038, Speaker A: So, Sergey, when I said bankless had previously been critical about cross chain bridges, I think it is that migration of tokens across chain is where we start to get scared. And I think we are in agreement in that philosophy. It's like that is where the insecurity comes from. And so this is the new strategy that Axelar is pioneering, is not token transfers, but data transfers. So you call it general message passing to just allow chains to talk to each other, communicate messages to each other, not share assets with each other. And so I think it's saying that this is the new way to do interoperability, is to not share assets, but share data. How does one actually achieve a fully expressive level of interoperability if only data can be passed? So the way that you and Zachie are talking, it's as if the full vision of interoperability is equivalent in this world.
00:22:39.038 - 00:22:49.860, Speaker A: Are there any trade offs in just like the message passing versus token passing world? And do we actually get the fully expressive interoperability world that we would get if we had secure token passing, too?
00:22:52.390 - 00:23:45.566, Speaker B: You can build secure, but yeah, I'll say briefly, I'm taking add on. You can build token transfers as an application on top of general message passing, right? So if you want to transfer tokens, you can build that as an application. You should have robust security there maybe rate limits and so on and so forth. So that you can do. And so I guess what general message passing allows you is to go beyond that, like we said, right? The analogy that I like using, we traditionally move the liquidity to where the application logic lives, and that's what creates the painful experiences, fragmentation. You can still do all of that if you want to move liquidity and build a Bridging application. But with this new software paradigm, through general message passing, you can move the application logic to where the tokens are, execute that logic, and then return the result back to the user's wallet.
00:23:45.566 - 00:24:19.200, Speaker B: So I submit it with my wallet on Cosmos chain, the transaction is executed on Arbitrum, and I get result back to my wallet. Liquidity is not moved. It's the interaction that we have within it. So it gives you kind of in Ethereum. I think everybody knows that EVM is Turing complete, right? Meaning that you can build anything. And so with Genome message passing, it's a Turing complete way to compose chains and ecosystems that you can build anything. And Bridging could be one of the applications if you really feel like it, but it doesn't get you the same level of experience.
00:24:20.530 - 00:24:22.000, Speaker A: Zachy, you were going to add.
00:24:22.930 - 00:25:53.486, Speaker D: I mean, I think that right now, the user experience that is most familiar to most users, most capital, is like the EVM, like the MetaMask Gnosis safe type experience, right? And that's primarily an experience that you want to be able to give. So when you interact with Sommelier, you don't know about the cosmo side, really, as a user of real. And the same thing will be true for our Arbitrum strategies, right? Like, you'll interact with all of them from MetaMask, it always feels like a completely native Arbitrum experience, but you're getting all of these benefits sort of behind the scenes. And I think that kind of application paradigm and you think about how much more accessible it makes everybody to be able to embed. We need to be able to move away from this current world where when you want to do something, every time you want to access something new in Blockchain, it's like, okay, I got to learn a new wallet, learn a new ecosystem, learn new block explorers, learn everything, right? It's too much. The Sommelier version of MultiChain has been like, you're getting these enormous benefits that just get expressed as better yields from the multi chain world. But you're just like your user experience.
00:25:53.486 - 00:26:05.346, Speaker D: What you know, you can go look at a Sommelier strategy on Dbank, see where the assets are allocated. Your transactions are all on Ether scan. This is what the world would people want.
00:26:05.448 - 00:26:49.530, Speaker C: Learning about crypto is hard until now. Introducing MetaMask Learn, an open educational platform about crypto, Web Three, self custody, wallet management, and all the other topics needed to onboard people into this crazy world of crypto. MetaMask Learn is an interactive platform, with each lesson offering a simulation for the task at hand, giving you actual practical experience for navigating Web Three. The purpose of MetaMask Learn is to teach people the basics of self custody and wallet security in a safe environment. And while MetaMask Learn always takes the time to define Web Three specific vocabulary, it is still a jargon free experience for the crypto. Curious, user friendly, not scary. MetaMask Learn is available in ten languages, with more to be added soon, and it's meant to cater to a global Web Three audience.
00:26:49.530 - 00:26:50.958, Speaker C: So are you tired of having to.
00:26:50.964 - 00:26:52.814, Speaker A: Explain crypto concepts to your friends.
00:26:52.932 - 00:27:39.838, Speaker C: Go to learn MetaMask IO and add MetaMask Learn to your guides to get onboarded into the world of Web Three arbitram One is pioneering the world of secure Ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the Web Three landscape. Hundreds of projects have already deployed on Arbitrum One, producing flourishing DFI and NFT ecosystems. With a recent addition of Arbitrum Nova. Gaming and social DApps like Reddit are also now calling Arbitrum home.

00:28:44.526 - 00:28:59.880, Speaker A: So, Stephen, you've been patiently waiting for us to arrive at the Arbitrum part of this conversation. From the Arbitrum perspective, if one could speak for the protocol, why would the Arbitrum Protocol be interested in this? What's exciting from the Arbitrum side of things?
00:29:00.650 - 00:29:01.014, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:29:01.052 - 00:29:44.274, Speaker E: I think from a technology perspective, I think it's all about access, which is I don't want to repeat the points that have been made, but the idea is there are different ecosystems with different properties and allow you to do different things. And the question is, are these siloed or can you access one from another? And to Zachie's point, you have the idea there. Just kidding. You have the Similier Cosmos chain, and that has some really nice capabilities. For example, I think one of the things that I'm most excited about is the ability to ingest private data and use that to inform these strategies. And now the. Question is, you have these strategies.
00:29:44.274 - 00:30:10.186, Speaker E: You have these strategies. What can you access there? I think that's where Axelar is helping. Oh, now you can access the Arbitrum ecosystem. You can access this as well. And fundamentally, Bridging is really important. And actually so I'll talk about the Arbitrum roll up bridge for a second. Many people don't know this, but that's also just the native bridge between Ethereum and Arbitrum is a general message passing bridge, which most people just use to bridge tokens.
00:30:10.186 - 00:31:03.358, Speaker E: But obviously there's a lot more to explore when you look at general message passing, be it between Ethereum and Arbitrum in other ecosystems. And, yeah, I think some of the really important value here in connecting these different chains and these different technologies is not being siloed and having the ability to securely that's the key word here. And that's where the questions you're asking David, of course. And I think that's Sergey's focus here is to securely be able to bridge and access these different ecosystems. Because just two things. One is there are different levels of expressiveness, different ideas of what you can do with private data you wouldn't necessarily be able to do directly in these ecosystems. Also, the idea that you just want to access multiple ecosystems from your strategy, I think these are all really important.
00:31:03.358 - 00:31:53.434, Speaker E: I think from the arbitrary from technology perspective, it's nice to have to be open and accessible from these different environments. And also, I'll just say one more thing on a multi chain vision that I have, which is we get very focused here, or I get very focused on the values that I care about, which is security and decentralization. And that's obviously what led to a lot of decisions that off chain made early on when it know, initially designing the arbitrary technology, or I was doing back when I was with Ed and Harry at Princeton. That doesn't mean, though, that we have to ignore the fact that there are others that make different decisions. And I'm not talking about any of us here. I'm talking about some other, say other layer ones or other layer twos that have different properties. They can have different values and different decisions that allow them to make a different set of trade offs.
00:31:53.434 - 00:32:37.200, Speaker E: It's all trade offs. So there are always pros and cons. But the idea of being able to talk to each other is still valuable, right? You don't always have to be so maxi and say it's. Either you believe in our set of values and interact here, or else get away from us. It's like, no, okay, you have this environment and there's this other environment, and there's a different set of properties in them, maybe expressive this, maybe security, but can we bridge these? And I think Axelr is one of a great project that's working on exactly solving this problem. And Smelier is one of the first users, or perhaps the first user of this particular integration that's showing the power that can happen when you grant this access from one ecosystem to another.
00:32:38.530 - 00:33:41.102, Speaker A: So the image that I have in my mind about how this is, I try and turn these into visual metaphors just because I understand those better. And so we have the ethereum multilayer two landscape. I always kind of view it as a tree with the tree trunk as the base layer, and then it branches out to the layer twos and then layer threes on top of that. And then we have the philosophically aligned version of the Cosmos mesh network app chain system, which is like a Bush or like a mycelial network. Mycelial network is a really important metaphor, because what I'm seeing with Axilar here is that we are actually seeing the first cross connections, the first bridges being made between the Arbitrum layer two and the Cosmos mesh network. I don't know if you call it a layer one, but the flat landscape of and Sergey, correct me if I'm wrong, but the idea here is that this starts with GMP, the general message passaging. It starts with data, as perhaps just like the small thread of connection that connects these two endpoints.
00:33:41.102 - 00:33:57.960, Speaker A: But I'm assuming that it grows from there and it becomes a more robust than just data, and the actual threads can actually combine in a more robust way. That's my intuition. Can you reflect on the accuracy of that metaphor, and maybe perhaps they can make it a little more tangible for us.
00:33:59.370 - 00:34:29.858, Speaker B: Yeah, you're right. The data itself that you can pass can be, like I said, sort of arbitrary. Right. And so I guess when you talk about reinforcing, what can be done is that this is where we rely on builders like right. To actually build the application logic into that data. So performing those types of cross chain calls and Axel will help you facilitate all of the communication in parallel. Right.
00:34:29.858 - 00:35:01.334, Speaker B: I guess just to add one more thing to I think what Stephen said. I think why it's important to interoperate these ecosystems is to really allow innovation to continue to happen across the software stacks. Right. I think we're still, in the early days, I think there's still a lot of decisions to be made on how to scale. There's still a lot of decisions to be made, like how EVM should evolve, a lot of decisions how Cosmos should evolve. Right. And so the interoperability between that means that you can innovate any way that you want within Cosmos stack.
00:35:01.334 - 00:35:44.070, Speaker B: You can innovate any way you like your application within the Arbitrum stack, but they can all still be kind of composable and talk to one another. And as more Cosmos chains use the Axler for the general message passing, you can think of them as more connections being made to the Axler. And then Axler helps facilitate that with Arbitrum. So lots of data passing. And on Arbitrum, you have a lot of applications that can consume the data from all of the Cosmos ecosystem through what we call as a gateway smart contract. So you can talk to one contract, and you have access to now or hundreds of Cosmos chains for free, essentially kind of one connection, but many to many on both sides of the equation.
00:35:46.190 - 00:36:04.880, Speaker A: Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the way that this works is that if you can connect an EVM chain, like Arbitrum to a non EVM chain, like anything in Cosmos, can't you do anything? Those are just two language types, like you could do other language types as well, correct?
00:36:06.370 - 00:36:06.782, Speaker B: Correct.
00:36:06.836 - 00:36:07.102, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:36:07.156 - 00:36:32.266, Speaker B: We're already working with a lot of different layer ones. Right. So stellar. We're working with kind of suite those integrations. So pretty much anything that kind of has smart contract capabilities can connect with Exeter. And that was one of our requirements as we were designing the protocols to make sure we can plug and play interoperability. So don't require any changes from layer one or layer two.
00:36:32.266 - 00:37:01.970, Speaker B: Be able to come in and just serve a plug and play, make sure the protocol is as light as possible, requires as little effort as possible to integrate. And again, that's very important, I think, in this phase of the ecosystem to allow innovation to happen across languages, across settlement layers, right across consensus protocols. And having this sort of plug and play approach that you can talk with any different language or a virtual machine is pretty important. And that's what we're following.
00:37:02.790 - 00:37:29.340, Speaker A: Okay, so I hate to get fixated on the bridge conversation, but just, like, remind me one more time about the security model for Axilar and how it's compared to bridges. In the past, we've seen the wormhole hack. We've seen the nomad hack. We've seen the Rodent bridge hack. We have cross chain bridge hack, PTSD. And so I really want to just drill down into this. What's the security model for Axelr? And what's this defense against something like this?
00:37:31.470 - 00:37:43.882, Speaker B: Yeah. So security model is that Axel, compared to a lot of the protocols that you mentioned, is actually fully decentralized network, right? So it's not relying on a small multi SIG, like three out of five or whatever was the Ronin hack where the keys got compromised.
00:37:43.946 - 00:37:44.222, Speaker C: Right.
00:37:44.276 - 00:38:00.294, Speaker B: It's a decentralized network where you have lots of validators that are collectively processing all the cross chain messages. And so what that means is that from a security side, you have security that backs the same model as backs a lot of layer ones on their own.
00:38:00.332 - 00:38:00.486, Speaker C: Right.
00:38:00.508 - 00:38:40.002, Speaker B: So layer ones have a decentralized, validator set that sort of secures and processes, and you get security through having a consensus. And so that's what Axela is. It's kind of a security through a decentralized open and permissionless validator set, augmented with a lot of robust engineering and a lot of application layer security features like rate limits. If you want to do a bridging application or things like that. But it all starts at the very core, which you have to have the right sort of decentralized design to be able to diversify software deployments, to be able to encourage as many participants as possible and not have a closed multi SIG between a few people.
00:38:40.136 - 00:38:55.000, Speaker A: So that makes it sound something similar to, like, ren protocol, where it was a decentralized network of nodes along with a native token that would do a lot of cross chain infrastructure spiritually. Are we in the correct area?
00:38:56.410 - 00:39:09.660, Speaker B: Yeah. So I haven't looked at the rent fully designed. I mean, I'm not sure if their validator participation was fully decentralized that anybody could actually join and anybody could participate. But yes, in principle, if that's what they're doing, then yes.
00:39:10.110 - 00:40:01.660, Speaker A: Okay, cool. The main question is, like, man, why didn't we get here sooner? A lot of the cross chain bridges were just like, multi sigs. Right? And so kind of egregious in hindsight. But it really just seems to be that the main big novel parts about Axelar is that it's hooked into a pre existing ecosystem that stood the test of time being IBC and Cosmos, and it's leveraged this general messaging as the base level of cross chain bridging. And then it's done just a lot of, I'm assuming, technical engineering lifts to get to the point where it's been able to connect the EVM to IBC and then also all the other chains. So this is my mental model so far as a result of this episode. Is that right?
00:40:02.830 - 00:40:15.854, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that sums it up. Yeah. And I think the one thing that I just want to add, right, is that even if you have general message passing or things like that, you still have to think about how do you build the types of application experiences that we talk about.
00:40:15.892 - 00:40:16.094, Speaker C: Right.
00:40:16.132 - 00:40:58.110, Speaker B: So when a user submits a transaction semilier, how do you make sure it actually gets executed on Arbitrum? Right? Who's going to pay gas there? And things like that. And so we've augmented kind of the network itself with a lot of services that allow you to do those things. Right? And so I think the developer experience building in a multi chain world is very different. You have asynchronous message passing, and you have execution on remote chains and things like that. So you actually have to build a lot of services around these core protocols to make sure the experience is as seamless as possible. Right. And that's the final piece that we're working on, is actually building the types of tooling that developers needs to build these types of applications.
00:40:59.330 - 00:41:21.110, Speaker A: And, Sonny, if we can put the Cosmos hat on, just how would you when we zoom all the way back out and view Cosmos both as an ecosystem of many, many chains and also a long term project that started, I think, sometime in 2016 or 2017? What does this technology mean? For Cosmos? How does it fit into the whole Cosmos vision?
00:41:22.890 - 00:42:31.750, Speaker D: There's no one Cosmos vision. But my Cosmos vision has always been the sort of Cosmos Ethereum merger vision. Right? The success of Ethereum L two S, Arbitrum Op stack have kind of brought the toolkit for building blockchains innovation marketplace that Cosmos already is conceived of to the Ethereum ecosystem. And there's also with Eigen layer things like ideas of sort of subseted, validator sets, shared security, all of these things. So there's just been this general sort of convergence that I've believed in for a really long time of Cosmos ideas, Ethereum ideas, into the one. Ultimately, I don't care if Atom is the most valuable token or what the price of ETH is. Ultimately, we're here to build a secure infrastructure for the entire world, right? That's the ultimate goal.
00:42:31.750 - 00:43:21.260, Speaker D: And so to me, it's always been about how do you blend all of these different technology ideas to get to that? And so to me, the vision is Cosmos, Ethereum. It's all one thing, ultimately, for the users. And the users are just getting robust, secure, financial primitives and other interactions, transactional primitives that they couldn't get anywhere else. And so, in the ordinary world, if you wanted to have something like Sommelier, you'd be sending your money to a hedge fund, and instead you have a decentralized, secure system that protects its users from strategists going off the rails, doing anything malicious. It's actually able to have a coherent security model, but allows for extracting alpha that you wouldn't be able to get it.
00:43:22.990 - 00:44:05.450, Speaker A: Steven, part of the recent Arbitrum announcement was not only the launch of the Arbitrum Dao that made everyone very excited, but the idea of multiple Arbitrum chains being built in a stack. And so we got layer twos and we got the layer threes, and everyone loves all the chains now that Arbitrum is on kind of the receiving end of somlier gosh, I'm so sorry, Zachie Samlier and the interoperability efforts from like, how is all of these chains going to interoperate with the Axelar Bridge? And overall, what is the net effect upon Arbitrum? Aka, why is this bullish for Arbitrum?
00:44:06.510 - 00:45:16.930, Speaker E: Yeah, so, a few things to be said. First of all, I think just getting more access to Arbitrum, I think the fact that starting off with Arbitrum is very good sign for Arbitrum and the strength of the ecosystem. And that's where a lot of the strong DFI is. So it's exciting to see that decision has made to expand to Arbitrum first. But when it comes to the L two S and other L three S yeah, it's a great question, which is like, so how do those fit into the Bridging environment, if I understand? And how, basically, will they use Axelr or something else? The answer is, I think, a little bit of both, particularly when it comes to layer three chains, Arbitrage Morbid chains, there is the ability for these things to talk together a little more natively, so to actually have some native interaction. So in a roll up, for example, in Arbitrum, there's a few out there that says all roll ups are is a bridge, right? So there's just like one of the framings of what roll ups are or what chains are even more generally. The Arbitrum obviously has a direct bridge to ethereum.
00:45:16.930 - 00:46:07.934, Speaker E: And one of the interesting things, though, is, okay, what about these other chains? What about two Arbitrum chains, right? Today there's Arbitrage, one arbitrary nova. Can they talk together? So today they don't talk together better than that. They can talk together via ethereum. So there is room, and there are these fast Bridging solutions that go ahead and talk to one another, can bridge that gap. I think over time, there are opportunities to develop technology that can allow different layer threes to talk together more broadly, or different layer twos to talk together more directly connected. But that will always only be like in the same family of technology. But if you want to reach past that, say, to get to the cosmos ecosystem, say to get to other ecosystems, you're going to need interoperability solutions that don't have those same native properties or don't have those same native abilities.
00:46:07.934 - 00:46:51.822, Speaker E: And those, I think, are going to become very important. One other thing, which I'll mention, which I think is very interesting. Not to digress too much into the optimistic or the roll up wars, but one thing that comes up a lot with roll ups, people like to talk about the benefits between different types of roll ups, and bridging is one of those that comes up right away. People say, Well, ZK roll ups have a faster Bridging, which is true, right? If the proofs are faster, it's not instant. It's usually hours to days to half a day or so, depending on the roll up. But I think what people miss and what this show actually highlights is that's looking at a very narrow bridging example. Right when you talk about Bridging from ethereum to a roll up, people like to focus very much.
00:46:51.822 - 00:46:56.660, Speaker E: But in a multi chain world or a cross chain world or whatever the term you want to use.
00:46:57.670 - 00:46:58.034, Speaker A: Both.
00:46:58.072 - 00:47:29.690, Speaker E: ZK roll. Ups and optimistic roll ups or any type of roll up that want to access other ecosystems or go across the boundary, not just to the chain that they're built on, are going to have to rely on other Bridging technologies. They can be more native, they can be third party technologies, they can be Axelr, and they're all going to become, I think, important to this big ecosystem. So from an off chain technology perspective, I think interoperability is the frontier right now, and this is very exciting to see today's announcement.
00:47:30.670 - 00:47:47.780, Speaker A: Well, Zachie, Steven, Sergey, I really appreciate you guys walking me through this story here. And so, Sergey, I'll let you end it here. If listeners are peaked, and they want to learn more about this. Maybe they're a developer and they want to open up the docs or they're just a user and they want to use where ought they go?
00:47:49.030 - 00:48:02.280, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean I think a good starting point is just to go to Axel network website and from there you can find links to discord. We have developer channels and you can find links to the Docs. So it's Docs Axel Dev and you can take it from there.
00:48:03.290 - 00:48:14.978, Speaker A: Awesome guys. Thank you so much for joining me here on the show today. Like always, bankless nation risks and disclaimers. Crypto is risky. ETH is risky. DeFi is risky. Cross chain bridges probably are still risky.
00:48:14.978 - 00:48:24.620, Speaker A: Yeah, at least they are headed in the right direction. You can lose what you put in but we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone but we are glad you are with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
