00:00:18.330 - 00:00:50.570, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. This is Defi dad. And this is another bankless tutorial. Today, I'm going to walk you through three common reasons that I think traders should or could be using loop ring. So we're going to walk through loop ring Dex. This is powered by the loop ring protocol. This is a place where I can place, limit, buy and limit sell orders, or I can place the limit, buy or sell price at a low enough or high enough point so that it executes it like a market order immediately.
00:00:50.570 - 00:01:38.998, Speaker A: And so this is a place that I know that I can trade for a fraction of a cent per trade in gas. I pay 0% on maker orders, and I pay 0.6% on taker orders. But the gas. If we go to an example of an order I've placed previously, you can see here that I'm paying fees that add up to around a cent, sometimes less than a cent. And I'd say with the price of ether today around 400, I think this is around $0.04. Loop ring looks and feels a lot like a coinbase pro or a finance, but you're completely in control of your assets, and you accomplish that by using metamask.
00:01:38.998 - 00:02:27.984, Speaker A: You can link your metamask wallet address to a loop ring, quote unquote account. But again, in order to use loop ring Dex, all I have to do is have metamask or a wallet connect compatible wallet. So that would be like the argent wallet, which you can connect through wallet connect. And then what I'm doing is I'm tying my ethereum address to the exchange merkel tree. So I'm not creating an account like you would on a centralized exchange. I'm still 100% in control of my assets, and there's no one at loop ring that can save me from myself. So if I lose control of my wallet, I will lose the assets that I have control of with that wallet.
00:02:27.984 - 00:03:12.240, Speaker A: Setting up an account takes about five to 30 minutes. One thing to be aware of is there are different referral codes. There's one from bankless that I'll link in the show notes or in the YouTube video. And that helps you to save on some fees when trading on loopring. Once I set up my account, I want to deposit some assets so that I can trade, so I go to account. There's a long list of assets now available to trade on loopring, so you can check them all out here, including Wi Fi and the new curve Dow token. And if I want to deposit those, all I have to do is click deposit and then choose however much I have available in my Ethereum wallet.
00:03:12.240 - 00:04:31.428, Speaker A: So let's say I choose what's here and I click deposit, and then I would just go through the normal steps with any sort of ethereum transaction. If I haven't done this previously, I'm going to have to give permission to spend the token that's in my wallet and then actually do a second transaction to deposit it. Once I've connected my Ethereum wallet to the merkel tree of loop ring, aka registering an account, and I've deposited some assets that I can trade, I can start to trade. So here are the three common reasons that folks should be using loop ring. Number one is I'm trading at least a few times a week or a few times a month, and hence I would benefit from saving on all of the gas that I'm paying on different Dexs or Dex aggregators. So the thing that I would do is I would come here to look up all of the different assets that are available and all of the different pairings. And if there are those pairings available, if I'm trading, let's say back and forth between ETH and USDC, well, I could be saving quite a bit by trading here on loopring.
00:04:31.428 - 00:05:14.568, Speaker A: So let's give a quick example of a trade. I've got some ether and I'm going to sell it for tether. Now, I could be setting limit orders in advance, trying to of course sell higher. So in this case I might put in a sell limit order for a price of ether of let's say 450 tether. And I'm going to go ahead and sell 50% of what I've got here and I'm going to receive about 95 tether. So if I click sell, this is now a limit order. It's an open order, of course.
00:05:14.568 - 00:06:02.872, Speaker A: And if that gets filled, if we go up to 450 tether in terms of the price of ether, that'll get filled and that'll show up then in my order history. It's all really standard stuff that you'd see on any other exchange. And if I want to cancel the order, I can do that here. Now, different than that, let's pretend that I want to sell my ether now, and I can see here on the order book that sell orders are at around 403.66 tether. So I could put that below that, or I could just, let's say, choose this price here so that my order will definitely go through and we'll go ahead and sell, let's do 0.5 e.
00:06:02.872 - 00:06:34.012, Speaker A: So I'll get 20 tether back from this. And now if I click this and make sure that the price here is higher than the limit price that I'm putting in here, it'll definitely execute it. Actually, let's go ahead and just make it $403 just to be safe. And if I hit sell. There we go. So my order was submitted, it was executed. You can see it happens within milliseconds.
00:06:34.012 - 00:07:09.752, Speaker A: And there we go. It was already filled and I got my 20 tether. So one of the things I like about loop ring is again, it looks and feels a lot like the centralized exchange experience, except I'm still in control of my assets. So let's take a look at how much I paid in terms of the fees to execute this order. So we'll go to orders, fill history. So I paid 0.2 tether, which is about most popular Dexes like uniswap.
00:07:09.752 - 00:08:10.576, Speaker A: You're going to pay about $10 at least in gas. That's just the going rate to put through a transaction. When gas prices are up around 100 gwe, there's zero reason that I should be paying that. If I know that I'm going to be trading back and forth between, let's say, ether and tether, I can instead just use loop ring and deposit my assets here and do my trading here. Reason number two is if I'm looking to accumulate, if I'm looking to accumulate a certain token, and I'm going to be trying to place limit orders so that I can buy that token at a certain price, that really does limit me in terms of which DFI app that I would be using. Loop ring sits on that short list. And so it makes sense that I can come into loop ring and I can be placing limit orders for the best possible price.
00:08:10.576 - 00:08:57.248, Speaker A: Let's pretend I want to buy ether at $250 and I will be placing an order for one ether. Or let's do whatever I have available with the tether I have here, and then I could click that I'm going to buy 0.8 ether at around 250 tether or better. So if I click buy now, I can see in my open orders that I have a limit buy for that ether. A third reason that I could be using loop ring is to be placing wishful orders. When I say a wishful order, I mean a price that I could only wish for it to hit. So similar to what I did here.
00:08:57.248 - 00:09:57.156, Speaker A: I could instead go in and put a much lower price if I'm trying to buy, or a much higher price if I'm trying to sell something that I regularly wouldn't believe that the market would take us to. But I'm putting it there just in case I get lucky. So maybe I'd put in for, let's say, $149 ether, and I would buy as much as possible here with my 20 tether. But I'm going to put in this wishful order for some unforeseen rainy day in the markets that brings the price down to $149. So I could click that, and now I've got that sitting there. This is something I regularly do to place these wishful orders just in case the market takes us there. It very often doesn't, but on rare occasion, I'll get a buy at a very low price.
00:09:57.156 - 00:10:43.608, Speaker A: And that's kind of the silver lining to the markets crashing on a single day. All right, so just a quick recap of all of the risks to consider in terms of what I've covered here today. First off, if I'm using loop ring, I'm 100% in control of my assets, which means that if I lose control of my wallet, I lose control of my assets. So I'm in charge. And while that's empowering, it also puts all of the pressure on me to custody and keep my private key safe for my wallet and make sure that I don't lose that risk. Number two is liquidity. Loop ring Dex is still rather new.
00:10:43.608 - 00:11:47.452, Speaker A: It doesn't have the same liquidity that you'd find on a centralized exchange. Their trading volume has been increasing over the last several months. So a good example of this is if I look at the ether tether market, it's going to be more liquid than if I look at one of the newer markets, like the Ren BTC market with tether. So this is a market that's really new. It's not very liquid, and it's just something to be aware of. If I come here to see that very few orders are being placed, or that the 24 hours volume is only $1,900, that tells me that if I place an order, especially if I'm trying to place an order that executes very quickly, it's probably not going to execute very quickly. And I need to either be patient and just wait for that market to become more liquid, or I could place a limit order, and that would then contribute to future liquidity and give me a chance to get a buy or sell order at a price that I want.
00:11:47.452 - 00:12:34.956, Speaker A: Reason number three is one that we talk about in every tutorial smart contract risk. If there is some bug in the code here, that's unforeseen. That would put my funds potentially at risk. So I would have to consider that smart contract risk and whether or not it's worth me trading with whatever value of funds on loop ring. The last risk to consider is exposure to stablecoins or pegged assets like RenBTC. So if you've never had exposure to RenbTC, this is tokenized bitcoin. And so we're all reliant upon that peg holding, and the market's continuing to buy and sell at a price that remains near equivalent to what bitcoins is.
00:12:34.956 - 00:13:07.512, Speaker A: And then the other part of that equation that we are talking about is just the stable coins. So I am similarly reliant upon those pegs. And if those pegs were to fail, that would be pretty disastrous to the value of the assets that I'm holding. All right, that's all I've got for you. Thanks for watching.
