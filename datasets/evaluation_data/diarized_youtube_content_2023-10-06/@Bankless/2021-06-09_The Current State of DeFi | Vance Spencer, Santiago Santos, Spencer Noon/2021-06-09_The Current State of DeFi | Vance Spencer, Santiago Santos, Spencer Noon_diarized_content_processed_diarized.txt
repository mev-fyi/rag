00:00:10.620 - 00:00:11.170, Speaker A: You.
00:00:13.140 - 00:00:32.092, Speaker B: Hey, bankless nation, we've got an exciting 60 minutes planned for you. We are doing a current state of DFI panel with three of the biggest DFI brains that we know. David, I know you're excited about this, man, because it's all you've been talking about for the past two weeks. What excites you about this panel?
00:00:32.156 - 00:00:32.528, Speaker C: Why?
00:00:32.614 - 00:00:33.856, Speaker B: Why is this so interesting?
00:00:33.958 - 00:01:21.136, Speaker D: Yeah, the context for this panel is that I went on to a different panel a couple of weeks ago, and it wasn't what I wanted it to be when it was a. What is the current state of DeFi panel? And so I got teased by what I thought was going to be a really dope panel, but now we actually are doing it. I think bankless can do it better. So bankless is doing what is the current state of Defi panel? And we have brought on three big brain guests to give us their perspective as to what they see on the frontier. We've got Santiago Santos of Parafi capital. We have Vance Spencer from Framework Ventures, and we have Spencer noon from the variant fund. And these guys are both DeFi investors, and so they think like investors, but they are importantly also DeFi users.
00:01:21.136 - 00:01:46.344, Speaker D: And so they know about it from both sides. Like they use this stuff and they invest in this stuff. And so I think this is going to be a fantastic panel to go through a ton of topics really quickly. If you have consumed bankless content since you're viewing this, I'm assuming you have, you know that we kind of tend to really take our time and distill stuff. This is going to be a little bit quicker. We're going to move really quickly through a lot of subjects. It's going to be zippy.
00:01:46.344 - 00:02:09.030, Speaker D: Yeah. And so if you guys like this content, like this panel content, let us know. We have other ideas about panel content. This is kind of in contrast to the AMA stuff that we do. And so if you like this panel content, leave a comment in the show notes. Also like and subscribe to the YouTube because we do these at least every single week. So, Ryan, without any further ado, shall we just go ahead and get right into it?
00:02:09.400 - 00:02:27.450, Speaker B: Yeah. And guys, of course, like any other AMA, you can leave questions in YouTube. We will get to those questions if we have time, as the panel has an opportunity to. Before we get into the panel, though, we want to thank the sponsors that make this episode possible.
00:02:27.980 - 00:03:06.084, Speaker E: Synthetix is Ethereum's decentralized derivatives liquidity protocol. What does that mean? Synthetics is a platform for creating and trading synthetic assets which are assets that are priced via an oracle. Rather than bids or asks, traders can use the quenta exchange, which hosts and trades all of the synthetic assets created by synthetics. Traders on quinta can trade synthetic tokens like SBTC s oil or SDFI. Because quenta is powered by synthetics, traders experience zero slippage on their trades. No, I didn't mean low slippage. I meant no slippage because that is the power of the synthetics platform.
00:03:06.084 - 00:03:45.140, Speaker E: No slippage on your trades. You can also easily short assets with isynths, which are synthetic assets that move inversely to their target asset. Synthetics isn't just for traders. Developers can build on synthetix to access the infinite liquidity offered by synthetic assets. Or investors can stake collateral to the protocol and earn fees that the protocol collects. If you're a trader and you're looking for a trading platform not found in the legacy world, check out quinta IO. If you are a developer or you just want to earn yield on your collateral, go to www dot synthetics IO where you can stake your SNX or ETH and earn fees from synthetics.
00:03:45.140 - 00:04:49.768, Speaker E: Ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on Ethereum and just recently released Ave version two, which has a ton of cool new features that makes using Ave even more powerful. With Ave, you can leverage the full power of DFI money, Legos, yield and composability all in one application. On Ave, there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield, and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol. If you have deposited collateral here, you can see me getting a 200 USDC loan against my portfolio of a number of different DFI tokens and ETH. I'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option, but I could choose the stable interest rate option if I wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently. One of Ave's v two features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets, trade them on uniswap, and then deposit them back into Ave. Ave does all of this for you, all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them.
00:04:49.768 - 00:04:55.370, Speaker E: Check out the power of aave@ave.com that's aave.com.
00:04:56.860 - 00:05:19.852, Speaker B: Hey bankless, welcome back. This is our big brain defi panel. We are really excited to talk about the current state of Defi. We're going to whip through a whole bunch of topics here today. Keep this zippy. As David said in the intro, I wanted to introduce you to Santiago Santos of Parafi Capital. We've got Spencer noon from variant fund, and we've got Vance Spencer from Framework Ventures.
00:05:19.852 - 00:05:22.610, Speaker B: Guys, how are you doing today? It's great to have you.
00:05:23.220 - 00:05:25.996, Speaker A: That's great to be here. Thanks, Ryan. Awesome. Thanks, David.
00:05:26.028 - 00:05:45.284, Speaker B: All right, everyone looks good. You guys are looking good. Ready to talk some defi? I'm sure you don't do this on a regular basis. I'm sure this is a rare event for you. But let's start with this, because I think this is important. The definition of Defi. How do we define Defi? I was team call this thing open finance.
00:05:45.284 - 00:05:55.870, Speaker B: I felt that was a bit more fluid, lost that battle. This ended up being called Defi. How do we define what it actually is? Spencer, can we start with you?
00:05:57.120 - 00:06:20.564, Speaker F: Yeah, so thanks for having me. Mean, this is obviously pretty difficult. I think the crypto community generally sucks at coming up with names for things. I think one thing is for sure, Defi is not bitcoin. So just wanted to get that out there first. But I would say we have these financial applications, these primitives that are built. For me, Defi is that.
00:06:20.564 - 00:06:34.920, Speaker F: And principally, I think, their cash flows. Being on chain is the core thing that kind of defines them and unites them. So when it touches something that's on chain, I think of it as being deFi. It's a spectrum, but that's probably the litmus test.
00:06:35.070 - 00:06:44.620, Speaker B: So touches something on chain, on chain cash flows, but bitcoin is not deFi. Vance, would you add anything to that? Do you disagree? Is bitcoin not deFi?
00:06:47.440 - 00:07:25.156, Speaker G: I think that bitcoin is a subset of deFi. I don't think the two are necessarily mutually exclusive. I kind of build up my understanding of blockchains and of defi, kind of from three steps. Number one, blockchains are something that are built for a trustless transfer of value. Number two, blockchains are an open development platform that anybody can write logic on. And so anything that's on a blockchain that has logic built on top of it is DeFi. Whether that's an escrow contract, whether that's from one address to another, whether that's a complex derivatives protocol.
00:07:25.156 - 00:07:28.716, Speaker G: That's how I kind of build up the definition of defi in my mind.
00:07:28.898 - 00:07:41.120, Speaker B: Santiago, we haven't yet very much used the term decentralization, and maybe that's intentional from our other two panelists, but is decentralization part of deFi? What is DeFi?
00:07:41.620 - 00:08:30.540, Speaker A: Yeah, I think for me, what I think about DeFi is embedding logic in a smart contract that executes in a very predictable, reliable and trustworthy manner. Certainly like the sediment layer, which is ethereum or some other chain, you're relying on some degree of decentralization to make sure that that smart contract executes the way that it makes that state transition, if you will. But for me, defi advance it. You are transferring some value. And that might not just be tokens, it might be nfts, it might be other things that have value via some sort of digital scarcity attached to it. But generally speaking, yeah, it is. For me, the most exciting thing about DeFi is the predictability of a smart contract to do a specific logic if then statements.
00:08:30.540 - 00:08:34.210, Speaker A: And you can apply that to any money verb, if you will.
00:08:34.660 - 00:09:03.850, Speaker B: So when we talk about DeFi, what it is and what it isn't, can we apply that to any specific platforms? Right? So Vance thinks that bitcoin is maybe a subset of DeFi. Spencer might disagree. Another investor might call Solana or Binance chain deFi. Some other people might disagree. What about these platforms? Is Solana Defi? Is binance chain Defi? What's your take on that? Where do you draw the line?
00:09:05.660 - 00:09:55.076, Speaker G: I think the space is exploring all these trade offs right now. And so I think a lot of it is, we will see, but a lot of things will trend towards kind of either side of the spectrum. So I'm sure at some point someone will build an interoperable Google sheet with Ethereum, and they'll be transferring money around on a spreadsheet that settles on eth. And they'll call that deFi. To me, that falls outside the kind of scope of what is DeFi, because it's naturally kind of decentralized. And so the criteria for what is enough decentralization to qualify as DeFi is kind of the heart of the question. And I think with decentralization, you only really find out that you need it when the chips are down, when things are breaking, when regulations come in, when there's adversarial actors on a network, that's when decentralization really matters.
00:09:55.076 - 00:10:24.128, Speaker G: And so oftentimes you only find out what's decentralized when things are breaking or things aren't going that well. And I think you can see that on things like Binance, where it shuts down, where that would never happen, with Ethereum or the polygon bridge, which isn't operable for hours on end when there's a market crash. Those things are not DeFi just because they've kind of fallen under that exclusion criteria. And I think more of these blockchain platforms that are not Ethereum will eventually not be DeFi as well.
00:10:24.294 - 00:10:28.260, Speaker D: Santiago, do you have an opinion on what is and is not DeFi?
00:10:28.600 - 00:11:21.968, Speaker A: Yeah, very succinctly. It is minimizing counterparty risk, because that's really the only reason why you want to do, you know, if you're doing BSc or some other know, you might go there for yield. You might go there for some other reason, especially if you're like a. And, but, but largely, I think where this space really is going, when you have large financial institutions, aggregators, where a lot of retail will end up interacting with these platforms, and they might not even know that they're interacting in a defi context, is, I think, when you're providing liquidity, when you're interacting in the system, you want to make sure that you're minimizing counterparty risk. Right. I'll give you an example. In a day like Black Thursday, where you have a market collapse, the first thing I thought when I woke up is I didn't think, I wasn't concerned about Ave or compound being insolvent.
00:11:21.968 - 00:11:49.896, Speaker A: I mean, you could have looked at the state of liquidations in real time and d five and said, okay, things are working. Of course it's congested. Of course the keeper system is a little bit flawed, but things are working in a very predictable way. The thing that I wasn't 100% sure on was, are our centralized counterparty solvent. And to me, that's the most important thing. And you see that over and over again in the normal financial system in 2008, in Robin Hood. In these instances of market failure, I think traditional finance is quite fragile.
00:11:49.896 - 00:11:59.120, Speaker A: And DFI, time and time again has proven to be a very anti fragile system that is very adversarial and is, by design, can't be insolvent.
00:11:59.860 - 00:12:17.400, Speaker D: Not only can they not be insolvent, but a frequent line that I like about DeFi, and I hear a lot about DeFi, is can't be evil. Protocols can't be evil. And so let's turn to Spencer. What does the phrase can't be evil mean to you inside the context of defi?
00:12:20.060 - 00:12:50.960, Speaker F: Yeah, I think it kind of goes to this idea that anyone can audit the code of the platforms that they're using, right. So the code is deterministic, it's being executed, and you as a user have kind of all of the tools at your disposal to figure out if it's evil or not. It can be evil, right? There are smart contracts that can do things that are antagonistic to users. So I don't know if I necessarily agree with that, but, yeah. Does that answer your question?
00:12:51.110 - 00:13:03.392, Speaker D: Yeah, totally. Maybe it's more like we can all Audit the evilness, right? We can all exactly check on how exactly evil these applications are. Vance or Santiago or Spencer.
00:13:03.456 - 00:13:12.872, Speaker F: Well, I would just add one thing, too, I think is important, is that users in DeFi have agency and that they can exit the system if the set of rules changes.
00:13:12.926 - 00:13:13.144, Speaker A: Right.
00:13:13.182 - 00:13:38.576, Speaker F: So you have, I think, like we were saying before, decentralization. Obviously, it's a spectrum. There are some protocols where there are only a few parameters, if any, that can be changed. There are others where their smart contracts are truly upgradable in a very wide kind of amount of changes that can be made. And for that, you can leave. And so I think it does also, one thing that you always have to come back to with DeFi is that.
00:13:38.598 - 00:14:00.600, Speaker A: The users have the agency to leave. Yeah, totally. You saw yesterday's statement by the CFDC, one of the commissioners. You know, in know, things can be manipulated and can't be enforced. I'm like, wait a minute, that's not true. I mean, the traditional financial system goes back to what Spencer's saying. You don't have agency, right? People understand that when you deposit your money in a bank, you have no idea what they're going to use it for.
00:14:00.600 - 00:14:50.628, Speaker A: Now, you rely on regulators to kind of have some sort of oversight into what banks are doing. But the only oversight that they're doing is, what is it like, bank efficiency ratios and making sure that they're quasi solvent, but they're stress tests, and those tend to fail. Whereas in DeFi, you are your own bank, you control your assets. Right? And so that's where I would challenge. When someone says, in DeFi, things are perfectly transparent. You're in real time able to infer anyone can be a watchdog, and anyone can infer if there's a change to a smart contract, if validator is down or not executing things in the way that things are intended to, then you can exit the system. And I think it's that ability for anyone to be a watchdog that keeps the system much more resilient.
00:14:50.804 - 00:15:28.196, Speaker D: Something that we've seen lately is we've seen Brian Brooks being hired by binance, us, and we've also seen Coinbase also hire a particular regulator who used to be part of regulation and now is part of Coinbase. And one thing that really concerns me and Ryan when we chat about this on the weekly rollups or just privately? Is this is kind of what we've seen before? Is DeFi perfectly antagonistic to this? Is DeFi the counterpart towards all this revolving door politics that we're trying to escape from, or is there something else there? Vance, let's turn that to and do.
00:15:28.218 - 00:15:33.300, Speaker G: You mean that people from the government wouldn't come work for a DeFi protocol, or in what sense?
00:15:33.370 - 00:15:55.790, Speaker D: Well, even if they did, does it really change the nature of the protocol? Right. Can a regulator, even perhaps a benevolent regulator, or perhaps a corrupt regulator, does the DeFi protocol actually absorb corruption in the same way that the traditional nation state regulating body does that we've seen throughout the end of time?
00:15:56.880 - 00:15:57.244, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:15:57.282 - 00:16:50.140, Speaker G: I mean, blockchains don't have a wifi connection. They can't tell who's good or who's bad. And smart contracts are the exact same. And so their ability to be kind of taken over is relatively small. I will say that because tokens are governance votes and those are effectively purchasable or borrowable, there is that attack vector, and there's also the attack vector of regulators regulating by decree. A lot of their power in this space comes from the fact that one statement, one speech, one indication can send prices downwards, and regulators oftentimes will do everything they can not to kind of draw formal lines in the sand and instead kind of rule by kind of public speaking. And so I think that's kind of one of the bigger tools that they have in DeFi where they don't have elsewhere.
00:16:50.140 - 00:17:06.020, Speaker G: But ultimately, I think regulation is going to be good for the space, and it might not kind of break exactly the way we want to see it. But the total addressable market of this stuff is so large and is moving so quickly that if we're able to embrace regulation in a way that's constructive, it's going to be a positive.
00:17:06.360 - 00:17:47.884, Speaker B: That's where we want to get to you next. Van so maybe we'll stick with you for a minute. We often talk about, Chris Berninski has used this phrase, infinite white space, to describe sort of the frontier that is defi, the frontier that is crypto. What I want to know from our panelists is, how big is this frontier, exactly? You just used the word tam, total, dressable, market size. But quantify this for us. We all remember the birth of the Internet, or we were young when it was birthed, but it's a big deal, right? And I think a lot of institutional investors hearken back to the early days of the Internet. Is defi as big as the Internet.
00:17:47.884 - 00:17:51.170, Speaker B: How do we quantify its size? Vance, to you?
00:17:51.860 - 00:17:52.272, Speaker F: Yeah.
00:17:52.326 - 00:18:37.200, Speaker G: So in the US, there are about 3 trillion in market cap of financial services providers that exist within the traditional ecosystem. And if you add banks to that, it's more maybe double or triple. And so you're talking about, and I just always go in orders of magnitude, probably 10 trillion to $100 trillion of market cap opportunity. Assuming that DFI doesn't just reinvent the stack, it actually makes it better. And I think with all kind of digital transformations, that's proven to be the case. So I think it's that large of an opportunity and maybe that encompasses the base layers and the apps, or just the apps, but I think it's probably all encompassing. And so ten to 100 trillion is about as large as I think it is, which would make it bigger than the Internet.
00:18:37.700 - 00:18:56.010, Speaker B: Ten to 100 trillion. Okay. And so are we talking there, Vance, about bitcoin as well being incorporated in this? Often bitcoiners talk about the total addressable market of gold, 8 trillion to 10 trillion. Is that something different when you're doing the quantification of the DFI market size?
00:18:56.460 - 00:19:24.864, Speaker G: It's different. I think if you think about. So say the tam for DFI is 100 trillion, and you say the tam for bitcoin is 12 trillion, which is the market cap of gold. I think bitcoin has a better chance of fulfilling more of the tam just because it's relatively a neutral technology. You can cleanly put it into a regulatory bucket. There's not things building on top of things that you need to regulate. So I think bitcoin will probably have.
00:19:24.902 - 00:19:27.024, Speaker C: All of that tam or exceeded at some point.
00:19:27.142 - 00:19:51.848, Speaker G: I think these financial apps, it largely depends on regulations, what percentage of that TAM it increases. Does the world look like all of these DeFi protocols are offshore and we're doing this regulatory hopscotch, or is it kind of embedded into the traditional financial ecosystem? I think that's the determinant of the tam or the percentage of that it occupies. But I think they're both going to be absolutely gigantic, and there's definitely no lack of opportunity.
00:19:52.014 - 00:19:53.530, Speaker B: Spencer, what do you think about.
00:19:54.780 - 00:20:37.050, Speaker F: I think. I think Defi is like a superset of everything, basically, is how I would think about it. All of the world's value will be instantiated on blockchains. It will clear on different layers of blockchains, whether that's ethereum, because it requires an extremely secure blockchain, or a L2 or a side chain, or any other smart contract platform where there's some type of financial activity happening? I think zooming out, right. The Internet allowed us to kind of send packets of information, crypto and Defi allows us to send, for the first time, packets of value. And that's the most disruptive thing that has kind of happened, I would say. So.
00:20:37.050 - 00:20:38.824, Speaker F: I think it eats everything.
00:20:38.942 - 00:20:40.168, Speaker A: It eats the world.
00:20:40.334 - 00:21:01.020, Speaker B: Santiago DeFi eating the world. Tell us about this. But also, how are the traditional financial systems going to act? What's Wall street got to say about this? What do traditional banks have to say about this? What about our friend Wells Fargo? What's Wells Fargo going to say when all of this transformation starts eating their core?
00:21:02.800 - 00:21:13.996, Speaker A: Like, ultimately, they won't have a choice because a consumer will demand it. Right. When you can earn higher yield on chain. I was at Morgan, this was rat poison. And now they're banking crypto.
00:21:14.108 - 00:21:14.672, Speaker C: Why?
00:21:14.806 - 00:21:43.064, Speaker A: I don't think Jamie Dimon woke up one day and said in the board meeting, we have to do this. If we don't do it, crypto banks are going to eat our lunch. And so, look, I mean, the global financial services industry is 20 trillion. Like, to go off of what Vance just said, it's very antiquated. There's a lot of friction in the system, and it's not capturing all of the value. Right. And nor is it capturing servicing all of the tam.
00:21:43.064 - 00:22:04.544, Speaker A: Right. There are many people that are unbanked. They don't have access to credit. And so really, d five for me is about not only doing things, as Spencer said, in a much faster, better, cheaper way than traditional financial system. So by virtue of that, you expand, right, what it is today from 20 to maybe 40. But it's also capturing anyone that has an Internet connection can now transfer value. And that has never happened in the history of the world.
00:22:04.544 - 00:22:34.492, Speaker A: And so when you connect all of that and you leverage the infrastructure of the Internet and the distribution of smartphones, then you start getting to, I think, what Vance is saying, more to closer to 100 or 100 plus. Now, you layer on top of that, the metaverse and things like nfts, where you're capturing, essentially, you're combining global capital markets with digital scarcity and creating new forms of non sovereign like stores of value and mediums of exchange. If you combine all of that, you get to 100 plus. In my mind, guys, I was just.
00:22:34.546 - 00:23:07.572, Speaker F: Going to say, I think the rocket fuel here is that smart contracts offer developers unprecedented leverage. You have never had more kind of value that you could pack into a line of code than you can with a smart contract. And I think the prime example is uniswap. I looked at this calculation maybe in March, and I think where we came out was that every line of Uniswap code based on its market cap was something like $18 million, right? And all that is to say that there are very few lines of code in these products.
00:23:07.626 - 00:23:12.456, Speaker B: Wait, every line of code was worth kind of uni market cap, right.
00:23:12.478 - 00:23:48.256, Speaker F: So if you took the market cap of Uni, right, and you divided it by the number of lines of code in the Uniswap smart contracts, you got to. It was like 18 million at the time. Obviously, this is not perfect science, but it just shows you kind of the relative level of programming that is necessary. I mean, think about Coinbase versus Uniswap. You have dozens of people working at one protocol versus hundreds thousand plus at a company, and they're doing roughly the same order of magnitude of volume. That is the opportunity. Right? Everything is about to be disrupted because of smart contracts.
00:23:48.256 - 00:23:57.380, Speaker F: And I think that's why I don't like to value the addressable market just because it's so big that it would make my head explode.
00:23:57.720 - 00:24:09.530, Speaker B: It also sounds silly, I think, to some outside investors when they hear us talk about these things, like ten to 100 trillion is the TAm. The TAM is everything, like the whole world.
00:24:12.380 - 00:24:50.836, Speaker C: One thing I think about is that the Internet was invented in the mid 90s, around the time that probably most of us were born. And that is such a huge development. And I don't think that has even been fully appreciated or explored in terms of the TAm, of what that means. To have a hyperconnected world, it would be like being kind of born within 20 years of the wheel being invented or fire being invented. I'm sure almost all measures of life quality went up over the next kind of 200 years, and I think that will be a very similar thing with not only Internet, but also DFI. And I see those things as very intertwined.
00:24:51.028 - 00:25:29.510, Speaker D: Guys, I remember in 2017, everyone was really, really stoked because the institutions were coming. The institutions were coming. Or at least that was the narrative at the time. Turns out that took about four years to actually become true. But 2021 does seem to have been the year that institutions put bitcoin on the balance sheet. Institutions starting to allocate to ether, and perhaps now also looking into DFI and NFTs and understanding the excitement there. So why, in your mind, would you say, are institutions here today? What do we have in 2021 that we didn't have in 2017 that are enticing institutions to finally come? Spencer, let's start with you.
00:25:32.680 - 00:25:44.964, Speaker F: Large amounts of liquidity, it really comes down to that, right? Like, institutions can access these markets and put on size in them, and that's kind of a testament to yield. Farming, liquidity, mining.
00:25:45.012 - 00:25:45.224, Speaker A: Right.
00:25:45.262 - 00:26:01.356, Speaker F: Like the innovation happening through a lot of the core low level DeFi protocols. I think, for me, I don't get excited about institutions with DeFi at all. I think they are just not the.
00:26:01.378 - 00:26:02.224, Speaker A: Right users for this.
00:26:02.262 - 00:26:33.288, Speaker F: This is about, again, kind of giving individuals financial tools that they've never had before such that they don't have to go to an institution who rips them off or takes a massive cut. I think the idea of an institution is being challenged as well. Right. With things like daos, investment clubs. Yeah, there's a long way to go. This is a huge battle. But, yeah, I totally understand why they're here.
00:26:33.454 - 00:27:02.720, Speaker B: Spencer. I was talking to you, David, when we were preparing notes for what questions to ask the panelists, and when we got to the institutions question, part of my discussion was like, whether the institutions come or not doesn't really matter, because what DeFi is actually doing is we're building new institutions. Right? So come aboard if you guys want. But back to Santiago's point. They're going to be forced into it, whether they come early or they come late.
00:27:03.380 - 00:27:22.116, Speaker F: So, echoing what you say, no, I think it's a great point that Santiago made. You talk to any tradfi person and you explain them compound or Aave, and they eat it up and get it immediately. Right. And they're starting to use just. Yeah. Again, I just think that's not, like, the end goal.
00:27:22.228 - 00:27:34.284, Speaker B: So, Santiago, what would you add to that? So your background is JPMorgan. So you've seen the institutions from the inside. Are they coming, or is this more about building new institutions, or is it a bit of both?
00:27:34.482 - 00:28:05.540, Speaker A: It's definitely both. I mean, I do think that there's two things that are different this time in 2017. One, there's much more infrastructure in place and much more Lindy to the space. There is also Covid, certainly, I think, was an accelerant to, for instance, stablecoin adoption. And if you look at the circle, I think put out a metric last summer that said there's been like a 600 700% increase. And I think it was like, year to date in the number of non crypto businesses using stablecoins. And you ask why? Well, because people can't go to a bank, and so digital money becomes much more.
00:28:05.540 - 00:28:06.912, Speaker A: It becomes the solution.
00:28:06.976 - 00:28:07.590, Speaker F: Right?
00:28:08.040 - 00:28:46.592, Speaker A: So anyone that has used a stablecoin doesn't want to go back to a wire transfer. So if you're Starbucks, if you're Walmart, and you can pay your coffee growers in Sumatra with stablecoins, well, why else would you do something differently? Right? So it really challenges the operating flow. Why? The only reason why technology has ever gotten adopted is because it's faster, it's better, and it's cheaper. Right? And so stablecoins fulfill that criteria relative to a wire transfer. So I think Covid was an accelerant to a digital transformation. Like, you would have looked at Asia and the way that they've totally leapfrogged financial infrastructure, and no one in Asia ever thinks of brick and mortar banks. Everything is just sort of very native with a smartphone like WeChat and cacao.
00:28:46.592 - 00:29:29.196, Speaker A: So I think you extend that further in the US and other places, and people have become much more in tune. I think stablecoins are a gateway drug to crypto, to Defi. And so I think that's different. And for banks, look, the only department that keeps growing in banks is back office and compliance and operations. All of those three can be totally collapsed if you operate through a smart contract. Now, you look at what aave is doing with a permission market, like whitelisted market, where Morgan can underwrite loans and borrow from another counterparty and interact with the customer directly. What does that do to their operation? Well, all of a sudden, they can process order of magnitude or two of mortgages and service a much wider audience.
00:29:29.196 - 00:29:56.440, Speaker A: And so going back to this thing, finance is perhaps the only sector that hasn't truly cut off to the Internet. And for the first time, banks are realizing that. And I think there are much, much more friendly and welcoming to this technology than most people assume they are, because they appreciate that any technology that can strip away fat from their P L, they're going to be very incentivized to adopt.
00:29:56.860 - 00:30:12.130, Speaker D: Vance, what's your take on whether or not we can just build our own defi native institutions? And if we can, what is really different about these that are built on the inside rather than coming from the outside? In what does this new era of institutions look like?
00:30:14.580 - 00:31:01.528, Speaker C: I think it's path dependent. Based on the regulatory landscape, I can see a version of the future where consumer banking apps are able to interact with all DeFi protocols. And I think that things like Coinbase wallet, which has a million users, is largely a representation of that future. And that is a future where we can build our own institutions, and we use the crypto exchanges as the on ramps. And that's kind of our banking stack. And I think that will be kind of the way that the world plays out. I think the other version of the world is where regulations are onerous and protocols are basically kind of separated into this kind of like shadow banking institutional world where maker and nave and all those things are kind of these offshore banks.
00:31:01.528 - 00:31:27.956, Speaker C: And I think that's also a gigantic market, but it looks a lot more like kind of how finance develops and their kind of restrictions on a regulatory or jurisdictional basis. And in that case, I think that it's going to be harder for these things to grow. So I think I'm optimistic and I think that regulators will come around and realize that these things are a net positive, but it's extremely path dependent. And it's just worth acknowledging that you're.
00:31:27.988 - 00:31:44.460, Speaker B: Almost implying, Vance, that there's a possibility we kind of go through a brief winter period of time in DeFi as regulators maybe come down on it relatively harshly, or at least regulators in some countries. Do you think that's a likely path?
00:31:47.040 - 00:32:35.228, Speaker C: I don't think it's a likely path. I think all of this will take years and years and years to kind of sort out, and there's going to be regulators taking out kind of the worst actors. Like you look at the icos of 2017, they went off and got the worst people, the bitconnects of the world and the scam icos, and I think they will go after those. And then the question is, how far do they want to take it? Do they want to use that as precedent for further regulatory action, or is that kind of the amount of regulation that they want to see in the market? And I think ultimately it'll end up being the former. They'll want to get bad actors out of the space. They'll want to kind of honor what consumers are already using and what they want to use in the future and that there won't actually be a winter. And so I'm super bullish on the regulatory future of the US.
00:32:35.228 - 00:32:51.120, Speaker C: I know that that's probably a minority opinion, but we talk to regulators and for the most part, they just want to see this space grow in a way that is helpful to consumers and it's constructive ultimately. And so I think there's really important work going on and it'll continue to happen and ultimately it'll be successful.
00:32:51.460 - 00:33:21.592, Speaker A: I think just to add to that, a good parallel is how they try to regulate the entertainment industry. Things like YouTube, certainly you had the early instantiations of that, like Limewire and Casa. That enabsers that obviously there were challenges with that, but ultimately you couldn't stop this train. And I think we've been at this for ten years. DFI is certainly like younger, it's two, three years. But I think regulators are using that as a parallel and we've used it when we talk to them. Think about how you try to regulate something.
00:33:21.592 - 00:33:47.670, Speaker A: YouTube. Well, you have to maybe create certain standards that if a YouTube video has certain amount of time, you can only use. You define how you redefine IP and copyright in a similar manner. I think regulators appreciate that there's a lot of innovation here and they want to be competitive on a global scale. So I think they want to sensibly regulate this technology with new regulation, not old regulations that apply to an antiquated financial system.
00:33:48.600 - 00:34:32.892, Speaker F: Yeah. One other thing that I would just quickly add is that there are a lot of people working behind the scenes in our industry to interface with regulators and other people that kind of work for the government. There is no doom, gloom, black swan that's coming from out of nowhere to be like, oh, man, the industry is like, that's not happening. But it's funny how you go on crypto Twitter, right, on any given day and it's like, oh, man, this SEC commissioner said that. Or, and it's just one data point. I just think it's worth kind of all of us just kind of understanding that this is an evolution of the financial system. Ultimately it will be folded into society.
00:34:32.892 - 00:34:37.590, Speaker F: It's going to require a lot of collaboration from many different stakeholders, and it's happening.
00:34:39.800 - 00:35:17.250, Speaker D: Guys, I want to turn the conversation to crypto dollars because crypto dollars, I think, kind of took everyone by surprise in 2018 and then continued to take everyone by a surprise in 2019 was with their immense growth in supply, in 2021, crypto dollars alone went from 29 billion to $105,000,000,000 in total supply. And also in 2021 alone, we went from $308,000,000,000 in monthly volume to $766,000,000,000 in monthly volume just last May. Guys, where are all the crypto dollars coming from? Why are they here? Spencer, let's turn to you first.
00:35:18.740 - 00:35:47.000, Speaker F: Well, for starters, self plug. I run a newsletter called our network. It's about on chain analytics and kind of data analysis. And if anyone wants to dig into this topic, we would fund it. So reach out to me. I think my hypothesis and what I've seen on chain is that it's to chase yield, right? Like they're going to defi protocols. They're farming, they're being used on exchanges for trading or as collateral.
00:35:47.000 - 00:35:53.640, Speaker F: And that number is growing because the appetite is only continuing.
00:35:54.780 - 00:36:01.920, Speaker D: Vance, any opinions about crypto dollars? Why are they here? Is there other stuff other than yield, or is it all about the yield?
00:36:05.620 - 00:36:54.560, Speaker C: There's a few different trades that you can put on that are just yield generative, that are within the strike zone of what kind of most institutions and hedge funds do. And I think a good portion of the stablecoin growth has been for things like the cash and carry trade, where you're basically harvesting the yield of dated futures on exchanges. Probably that. I would say that's a quarter. I would say another quarter is kind of know emerging markets people that are using us dollars instead of their current native currency. An interesting anecdote there is that when you go to the foreign exchange counter in Kowloon in Hong Kong, they don't quote you us dollars, they'll quote you USDT. And so it's just remarkable the extent to which that's grown to be a real phenomenon in emerging markets.
00:36:54.560 - 00:37:08.550, Speaker C: And then the other kind of half. It's a mystery. I don't think anybody knows, but it's just a global phenomenon where people are putting cash in and once it goes onto a blockchain, it's not leaving. And they're doing yield farming with it. They're having fun, they're using it to pay people.
00:37:08.920 - 00:37:11.076, Speaker G: And so I think if we were.
00:37:11.098 - 00:37:21.640, Speaker C: To really dig into the data, we'd find out it's a lot more international than we think. And it also has a diverse array of participants, from huge hedge funds to people that are just sitting in their basements. Yield farming.
00:37:22.140 - 00:37:55.456, Speaker B: Santiago, what do you think about this? Especially what Vance was saying at the end of crypto dollars being relatively sticky. Once the dollars, the fiat crosses that bridge into this new frontier, it tends to stay there. Is that the case? Or like some critics would say, look, guys, once all the yield evaporates in the next bear cycle, all these dollars are going to just disappear along with the yield they came because of the yield they're going to go when the yield disappears. What's your thought on how sticky crypto dollars are as a use case and the growth potential there?
00:37:55.638 - 00:38:52.928, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I would challenge the assumption that yields will go down just full stop and I can get in. But no, no, I think, look, again, it goes back to the usability of a digital coin versus having dollars in a bank account. Not only is it just your own bank, but people continue to criticize, defi because it is all speculation, shitcoins and all this stuff and yield farming. At the end of the day, I think more and more people are waking up this idea that depositing your USDC in Aave or compound, forget about the yield for a minute. Even if there was no yield, you're in control of that and there's greater certainty. And I think people outside the US, where you have different regimes and not as strong of a system, appreciate the certainty, the higher degree of security that you can have by having a digital dollar. Now, of course I would like to see more truly decentralized stablecoins.
00:38:52.928 - 00:39:07.560, Speaker A: I think that is a frontier in DeFi that has a lot of experimentation, but I think that's the next sort of wave where you see something like Faye or some other projects that are trying to experiment in this frontier.
00:39:08.460 - 00:39:19.544, Speaker B: Okay, tell us why yields aren't going down well, first of all, where they're coming from, because some people don't even know that where are the yields coming from? And then make the case for why they're not going down well, a number of reasons.
00:39:19.592 - 00:40:08.620, Speaker A: Yields are either subsidized by sort of a combination of like native tokens, right? When you're yield farming, that's one element where protocols may issue you their own token. And so that has value. The other component is just by virtue of utilization, there is a lot of demand to perhaps borrow these stable coins. So for instance, a subset of participants are looking to go levered long, for instance, or borrow stable coins to go farm and do other things with them. So that's another, when you think about the utilization curve of what determines yields in these money markets, that's another component. And the third piece of why yields are not necessarily coming down. One, there's always a risk premium attached, and there will continue to be a risk premium attached to this industry because it's younger, it has smart contract risk, it's just more in the frontier.
00:40:08.620 - 00:40:36.580, Speaker A: And the other is the ability to do derivatives, right, and create much yield generative opportunities like credit default swaps, something like Barnbridge or saffron, the ability to tranche risk and create much interest bearing opportunities. I think that is a whole area that is very nascent in DeFi today, but I think increasingly will create opportunities to capture yield in space.
00:40:36.730 - 00:40:59.464, Speaker F: Okay, I would add a couple things. Go, if you wouldn't mind. Okay, so one, I don't purport to be like a trader. We definitely don't at variant, we don't know where the market is going tomorrow. I think we make kind of, like, long term bets. I would say yields are very much, as we know, predicated on the price of the governance tokens that people are farming.
00:40:59.512 - 00:40:59.820, Speaker A: Right.
00:40:59.890 - 00:41:49.710, Speaker F: But I think for the reasons that Santiago said, and two more that I'll give that in equilibrium, I believe that Defi yields will be higher than yields, and the two others are one. It's like a lower cost of capital, right. If you're lending on Ave, the difference between that and interfacing with an institution like Morgan or something like that, they have businesses and compliance and people to employ, right? All of those things are costs that protocols do not have. Number two is composability. Right. If you are an actor in this system, you can stack yield in a way that is just kind of unimaginable in the financial system for most, basically all participants, except for the very few sophisticated ones.
00:41:50.160 - 00:42:35.788, Speaker D: Awesome. I really like that. Take the bureaucracy is one of the most attractive, or lack of bureaucracy is one of the most attractive features of this space. And since we have all these crypto dollars on chain, like I said, over 100 billion of them, how has that impacted market structures? Right. Back in 2017, 2018, when we were dipping, people had to flee to fiat on exchanges, on centralized exchanges, and then maybe one step away from their bank account. But nowadays, people can just exit into crypto dollars on chain and keep them on chain. How does that change the properties of the tokens that are proximate to all of these crypto dollars? I would assume ether has the most surface area to crypto dollars, but also DFI tokens as well.
00:42:35.788 - 00:42:46.290, Speaker D: Vance, how do you see such a large supply of crypto dollars being so close in DFI to all of these crypto assets? How does that change the market?
00:42:47.140 - 00:43:24.284, Speaker C: Yeah. So relative to 2017, bitcoin has become less important as a medium of exchange just because that was kind of your. It would go alt to bitcoin or eth to us dollars on an exchange. You can kind of just cut out one of those legs now. And so bitcoin has kind of had to evolve as a result, as it's not kind of the reserve currency of a lot of these kind of alternative coins. So that would be kind of one of the biggest ones. But I think just the idea of user persistence and the fact that people are sticking around and it's not, you withdraw to your bank, it's three to five days out, it comes into your bank account.
00:43:24.284 - 00:44:04.090, Speaker C: If you want to get back in, you're making a conscious decision to wire money to coinbase. Removing user friction means that people can use these things more. And I would say that's kind of a general benefit of market structure as well. But just the ability for people to actively use those stablecoins, earning more governance tokens on things like Ave or compound or curve or synthetics, that's a huge use case. And I think that actually helps the liquidity of those underlying protocols and allows them to fend off a lot of the downwards reflectivity that they see in times of stress. So I think it's ultimately a huge positive. I do think that with stablecoins we've only seen the very beginning of the story.
00:44:04.090 - 00:44:37.004, Speaker C: And I'm very bullish on things like Dai and SUSD and more decentralized alternatives to things like USDC, which I think will eventually just kind of come to be neutered in a lot of ways as that blacklist kind of gets more expansive and the list of protocols that they'll allow to interact with becomes more and more diminished over time. So we'll see on what that looks like in time. But people think the decentralized stablecoin race has been won, or it's already finished, but we're really at the very beginning of that industry.
00:44:37.132 - 00:45:26.690, Speaker B: Well, here's another maybe new beginning, and this goes to kind of current events, which is El Salvador talking about making bitcoin a legally accepted currency inside of their economy. And El Salvador is, as I understand, based on the dollar today. You just said something super interesting. I think, Vance, which is what we've seen in the crypto economy, is that crypto dollars have started to replace bitcoin as a medium of exchange. I'm wondering if we might start to see this on the nation state level, right? So like one thing you might get with crypto dollars is an entire financial system in a box, right? And that could service entire countries in the future. That's a hypothetical and also a question mark Santiago, what do you think about that?
00:45:27.640 - 00:45:46.708, Speaker A: Well, I'm from Mexico, as you guys know. And to me, yeah, most people don't want to hold their savings in pesos. You want to do it in a dollar. Now, you can do that, the digital dollar, and interface with an entire, as you said, out of the box, so much utility. I mean, Mexicans can't even invest in the US stock market. You can't invest in things like Tesla now. You can't.
00:45:46.708 - 00:46:14.644, Speaker A: Right, through synthetic products. I mean, the level of usability of this system, right? Usability. I'm not talking about speculation, just pure usability and access to new financial products that otherwise it would impossible to get access to is huge. I think you look at the turkish lira, you look at the venezuelan peso, you look at the Zimbabwe dollar, their volatility. You think shitcoins on uniswap have volatility. These things lose value time and time again.
00:46:14.682 - 00:46:14.884, Speaker C: Right?
00:46:14.922 - 00:46:30.120, Speaker A: And so in my mind, that is what really is exciting about defi, is the usability. Most people talk about speculation, but don't appreciate the level of usability and what that truly means for most of the world's population.
00:46:30.860 - 00:46:33.530, Speaker D: Guys, we are going to. Oh, go ahead.
00:46:33.900 - 00:46:47.230, Speaker A: No, I was just going to say, in reality, why do you need to have fiat, like local fiat currency or tokens, if you will, when you can do a stable coin or something like e?
00:46:47.920 - 00:47:24.570, Speaker D: Guys, there is so much left in this d five conversation. We're going to get to the topics of L2s that we all think, and some are already here. The rest are coming. I want to talk about Uniswap V. Three and who is most capable of winning the Uniswap V three? Liquidity, providing competition. Is it DFI apps, or is it institutions and individuals? And then there's some other conversations I want to get to, such as, what does it mean to be about that life? It's this Vance Spencer quote that we got out of the first podcast with him, and it stuck in my brain. But first, before we get to all those questions, we're going to have to take a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible.
00:47:24.570 - 00:48:01.316, Speaker D: Bankless is proud to be supported by Uniswap. Uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure. Instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans, Uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on Ethereum, which is what Ryan and I call a money robot. No human counterparties or centralized intermediaries, just autonomous code on Ethereum. Input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy. Something brand new in the Uniswap ecosystem is the Uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants. We have been saying this for a while, and we'll say it again.
00:48:01.316 - 00:48:29.372, Speaker D: Dows have money and they are in need of labor. If you think that you have something to contribute to the Uniswap Dow, apply for a grant to Uniswap. Just look at the size of the Uniswap treasury. It's almost $3 billion. This mountain of capital is looking for labor. Do you have something of value to contribute to the Uniswap? Dow no matter how big or small your idea is, you can apply for a Uni grant@unigrants.org and help steer Uniswap in the direction that you think it should go.
00:48:29.372 - 00:48:59.548, Speaker D: That's exactly what we did to get Uniswap to be a sponsor for bankless, and you can do the same for your project. Thank you, Uniswap, for sponsoring bankless. Gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange. I've been a customer of Gemini since I first got into crypto in 2017, and it's been my main exchange of choice to make. My crypto buys and sells. Gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide. And on Gemini, there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets, including many of the hot DFI tokens.
00:48:59.548 - 00:49:37.636, Speaker D: And it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid Dai markets. Gemini just launched their earn program, where you can earn up to 7.4% interest on 26 various crypto assets. If you're tired of paying fees in DFI or you don't want to worry about DFI exploits, but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets, Gemini earn is the product for you. Another product I'm stoked to get my hands on is the Gemini crypto back credit card, which gives you 3% cash back on all of your purchases, but paid to you in your preferred crypto asset. When I get my Gemini credit card, I'm going to make sure that I get my cash back in ETH. So whenever I buy something, I get a little bit of ETH bonus back to me.
00:49:37.636 - 00:50:32.932, Speaker D: At the same time, you can open up a free account in under 3 minutes@gemini.com. Gobankless and if you trade more than $100 within the first 30 days after sign up, you'll be gifted a free $15 bitcoin bonus. Check them out@gemini.com. Gobankless guys, we are back with our DFI panelists, and I want to start off the second half of this show with uniswap v three because Uniswap V three and concentrated liquidity has really kind of changed the game with what it means to provide liquidity in Amms. Amms already changed the game, but then uniswap V three changed the game again where it used to be, this lazy liquidity providing paradigm. Submit your assets, call it a day. Now we're kind of getting back into the world of competition, and now we're kind of seeing these order books form these order books that look like pyramids rather than inverted pyramids like we would see on traditional order book exchanges.
00:50:32.932 - 00:51:00.610, Speaker D: And so I want to ask you guys the question. Who is most capable of generating the most fees and yield in Uniswap v three? What parties of institutions are we individuals who can move really quickly, or funds who can have dedicated strategists or DFI apps that are really yield optimizing, yield aggregating DFI apps like Yearn? Who's the best party that's most situated to win the litiquidity providing game in uniswap v three? Santiago, let's turn to you.
00:51:01.460 - 00:51:31.150, Speaker A: I think it's DFi apps. You've started to see a few. We're actually investors. We're investing in one, incubating one. And I think it's going to be urine like strategies that really automate this for all kinds of users, not just retail, but also sophisticated institutions. For what it's worth, it is very time consuming and process to manage liquidity provisioning in v three, and I think this is better suited for someone like urine to do.
00:51:31.600 - 00:51:37.470, Speaker D: Vance, same question. What do you see on the horizon of who's going to win the lp game moving into the future?
00:51:38.720 - 00:52:00.096, Speaker G: It's not going to be passive. Lps and projects that don't adapt to this new kind of regime of capital efficiency are really going to struggle, partly because they're not going to be able to get best execution, but also because they're just going to be basically hiring other people's lps that are lazy. And there will just be less fees.
00:52:00.128 - 00:52:01.824, Speaker C: There will be more people lping.
00:52:01.952 - 00:52:25.852, Speaker G: There's kind of less of a pie to go around. And so I'm kind of bearish on those. But I think there will be protocols that sit on top of uniswap and basically democratize access to market making again. And those will be relatively profitable. But yeah, there's also kind of like this kid in the basement factor that's just figured it out, and there's tens of thousands of those types of people that can do it themselves.
00:52:25.906 - 00:52:27.448, Speaker C: I think the question will be ultimately.
00:52:27.544 - 00:52:28.908, Speaker G: Whether they want to, or whether they.
00:52:28.914 - 00:52:29.356, Speaker C: Just want to pay.
00:52:29.378 - 00:52:30.850, Speaker G: Urine, 1%.
00:52:31.860 - 00:52:35.890, Speaker D: Spencer, same question. Got any opinions on the v three game?
00:52:36.980 - 00:53:11.320, Speaker F: Yeah, I have strong opinions. I think everyone wins, and I think it's really early. So right now, we don't have much of an ecosystem of apps that help the, quote, lazy liquidity providers right now. But that's going to happen. And I think people will organize, they will find a way to, I guess, equip. Themselves with strategies that more sophisticated participants have today. So I think that's really cool, something I'm seeing behind the scenes with teams.
00:53:11.320 - 00:53:17.784, Speaker F: But I think taking a step back. Uniswap is permissionless. Anyone can add a pair to uniswap.
00:53:17.832 - 00:53:18.044, Speaker A: Right.
00:53:18.082 - 00:53:25.312, Speaker F: And so with that, you have a long tail of assets that, frankly, institutions are never going to touch.
00:53:25.366 - 00:53:25.584, Speaker A: Right.
00:53:25.622 - 00:53:49.108, Speaker F: They're going to touch them when they get bigger and they become a top pair or part of the middle market. And so I think the beauty of Uniswap is it is the exchange for, we believe, all of the world's value. And so I think there are fees to earn for literally everyone. It comes down to kind of what pairs you're playing with.
00:53:49.274 - 00:54:01.740, Speaker B: I'm going to ask a quick question on uniswap to each of the panelists just to get your quick gut reaction opinion. Do you think we'll live in a world where Uniswap is the dominant amm, or will we have many amms? What do you think, Spencer?
00:54:03.680 - 00:54:32.656, Speaker F: I would say it's probably like a power law. I wouldn't be surprised if Uniswap was the dominant player. I actually believe it will be. I mean, look at the market share now, right? We just saw about a 60% market share right now. Everyone has tried everything in terms of liquidity, mining programs, different amms, different curves, and yet vampire tech. Yes. Even without all of those things, Uniswap is still winning.
00:54:32.656 - 00:54:34.560, Speaker F: And I think it's worth interrogating.
00:54:34.640 - 00:54:35.364, Speaker A: Why?
00:54:35.562 - 00:54:58.844, Speaker F: I think, obviously, first mover advantage was huge. Right. Liquidity begets more liquidity. You have users that are coming and trading. That's more trading fees for the lps. I think brand and trust is also a big thing. Right? So when you're a liquidity provider or a user, you want to be somewhere, you want to participate in a platform where you have the assurances that your money is not going to go away and you're going to get the best price.
00:54:58.844 - 00:55:02.864, Speaker F: So, yeah, it's really interesting. We'll have to see.
00:55:02.982 - 00:55:09.280, Speaker B: Vance, what do you think? Are you as bullish as Spencer on Uniswap, or do you think there's many amms?
00:55:12.260 - 00:55:15.644, Speaker G: I think if you look at Polygon.
00:55:15.692 - 00:55:58.124, Speaker C: Right now, there's an amm called quickswap, which basically does all of their volume, and they dominate that area. And that's honestly where a lot of retail is being onboarded right now. And Uniswap is really amazing, and it's capturing most of the market share of these amms. But they're kind of too principled to go and deploy there because polygon is not really permissionless innovation. It's kind of like a federated side chain. So I think it's kind of path dependent in terms of which l two ends up winning, but Uniswap being able to go on or being willing to go on to arbitram makes me more bullish on Uniswap, kind of winning out in the end game. But there is a world where we explore these decentralization trade offs and another L2 or another blockchain ends up winning.
00:55:58.124 - 00:56:07.216, Speaker C: And Uniswap is not the amm of that, you know, pretty path dependent. But we're extremely bullish on Uniswap. We hold Uniswap, so disclosure.
00:56:07.248 - 00:56:15.800, Speaker B: But yeah, we're going to get more to L2 in just a minute. But I want to ask santiago same question about Uniswap versus a world of many amms.
00:56:17.180 - 00:57:09.892, Speaker A: Yeah, I would think that there is possibility to have sort of like a duopoly or two or three dominant amms. I think like sushi, for instance. Look, I love Uniswap and what they're doing, but certainly sushi is one that the areas of DFI that need more solving are like capital efficiency. And certainly univ three starts to accomplish that by being allowing consumer preference to say, hey, what continuum of the curve do you want to provision liquidity based on your interpretation of correlation of said assets right at the pair. But Sushi's approach to capital efficiency is much different through options and like Hashi and Bento box. And so in my mind, it's just sort of a different approach to capital efficiency. Ultimately, what the consumer most and the liquidity provider most cares about is being able to maximize fees.
00:57:09.892 - 00:57:52.320, Speaker A: And certainly that might be possible in b three. But I think there is still a lot of room for innovation in this field of capital efficiency. And I'm personally interested in seeing different approaches to that. And so I think by virtue of that, there is a possibility to have potentially competing amms. And look, it's a vast area, right? And so what you, I think, need to understand is that from a liquidity provider standpoint, you might value certain things, right, if you're a retail LP, different than if you're a Treasury LP, if you're a much more institutional LP. And so I think there's different approaches, and for that reason, you're going to see perhaps multiple amms.
00:57:52.480 - 00:58:47.928, Speaker B: Spencer, it's been woven throughout this conversation today, but we talked about Polygon, other L2s, right? And Polygon maybe is a side chain, less of a L2, but the L2s are coming. It's really interesting to see those of us, all of us here, have been in the space for a bit through the trajectory of Ethereum. The beginning, they said smart contracts would never work, no one would use them, right? Then Ethereum got so full and so successful that that became sort of the problem is, how are we going to scale Ethereum? And now we have things like binance chain launching with an EVM, smart contracts, instant massive transaction. Polygon, kind of the same. Now we're on the cusp of what David and I have been calling L2 summer. We've got arbitram, we've got optimism, we've got lots of experimentation with the starkware stuff going on. Talk to us about what you see ahead for the next three to six months in L2.
00:58:47.928 - 00:58:52.200, Speaker B: Is it here? Is it coming? Is it going to make a big difference? What do you think, Spencer?
00:58:54.060 - 00:59:59.432, Speaker F: Yeah, I definitely think it seems like a lot of these projects are kind of marching towards a main net all around the same time. And I think to Polygon's credit and even BSc, they've kind of showed the playbook of how to get users at least to take a tour of their blockchain, right? And it starts with some type of fork of a battle tested defi app that lives on Ethereum, and it's either juiced with liquidity, mining rewards, and even sometimes subsidized by the underlying chain itself. Right? So like giving matic rewards on top of sushi rewards, that's a great incentive for people to come over and try it. And then you kind of couple that with the infrastructure. If it's an EVM chain, you can use things like metamask, you have block explorers that kind of plug in, and it's a user experience that feels very similar to Ethereum. So, yeah, I think it's going to be madness, frankly. I'm curious about what happens after that.
00:59:59.432 - 01:00:17.392, Speaker F: Right, when the dust settles, what was sticky and what was not, which users actually stayed? Were they mercenaries and just going to wherever the hottest yield farm was? Or are they a different type of user kind of entirely? So, yeah, it's going to be fascinating.
01:00:17.536 - 01:00:53.570, Speaker D: Spencer, you use the word madness, which I think is very proximate to the word mania, and then you also just indicated that there's going to be a bunch of yield farms around. And so one of my things that I've been speculating about is people tend to issue tokens in this space. And so I'm kind of thinking that every single l two will have a token, and if they have a token, that means they'll need to distribute it. And so, Santiago, how do you think all these l two s are going to distribute the tokens? What's the distribution plan, the logical distribution plan that you see coming for all of these l two s?
01:00:55.060 - 01:01:48.524, Speaker A: Yeah, well, first of all, I think there's some uncertainty if some l two s will issue tokens. I think I can't think of any network that has been successful without a token. So for that reason, I think every l two will have a token purely for governance or for other reasons. On the distribution side, I think we can look at precedents on what has been a successful distribution strategy. I think most recently, you've seen projects like Badger and others and Gitcoin distribute tokens in a much more sensible manner based on certain criteria, not just providing liquidity, but also what are going to be good stewards of governance that are going to be active in the community, active in governance. And I think for an l two, what is most important? Right. Well, you want to attract partners, right? You want to attract apps to come on board, and so distributing to those treasuries and those users might be good as well as the underlying users.
01:01:48.524 - 01:02:08.416, Speaker A: So I think, obviously, as we all know and are in for the space, being able to distribute those tokens widely is also important. And so, yeah, I think you will probably see some guild farming opportunities purely to distribute this to a wide variety of users.
01:02:08.528 - 01:02:31.532, Speaker B: Vance, we just had you on the podcast, so I know you're bullish. Layer two, right. And I know you've got some stuff to say about it. I want to ask this question, right. I feel like in crypto, if you zoom out, we've seen a couple of eras. We've seen, first the era of bitcoin, where we discovered digital scarcity. Then we saw the era of Ethereum, where we discovered sort of smart contracts and DFI was born.
01:02:31.532 - 01:02:42.530, Speaker B: Is L2 unlocking another new era? Is it that big? Is it that important? Is it that impactful? How would you characterize L2?
01:02:43.160 - 01:03:26.352, Speaker C: It's unlocking a lot. I think it unlocks both good and bad. So the good is high transaction throughput, a means to kind of port Ethereum culture forward in a way that doesn't crush the base layer, and just new primitives that we can all build and enjoy in this new financial system. That's definitely the good. The bad is know. And I was talking to some friends from China last night I was, how's BSc doing? Is it still know? Do you guys trade on it? They're basically, you know, people got rugged, too much retail, stopped coming onto the platform in know. People in know calling for consumer protection against finance and things.
01:03:26.352 - 01:03:35.264, Speaker C: I think L2s oftentimes think that they are competing against each other, but really they're competing against not blowing themselves up and developing the wrong culture that turns users off.
01:03:35.382 - 01:03:36.996, Speaker G: And so I think that's kind of.
01:03:37.018 - 01:03:45.696, Speaker C: The bad unlock that a lot of these L2s will have to grapple with. And I think bsc and kind of the relative death of that has largely been indicative of that trend.
01:03:45.728 - 01:03:48.164, Speaker G: And so I think there's this idea.
01:03:48.202 - 01:04:29.510, Speaker C: That we're just going to open up the theme park and people are going to come in and have a blast, but in reality, we have to make sure the rides are constructed the right way. People aren't getting their heads chopped off on a roller coaster. That's kind of how we lose the L2 battle in the near term. In the really long term. I think the big thing is how do you productionize and utilize Mev? That is basically the financial, where the rubber meets the road in terms of porting ethereum culture. Are you giving it to people that are not supportive to the ecosystem? Are you giving it to the lowest common denominator developers so that they can keep building their little dinky defi app that may 1 day become something big? And I think that's where kind of, we end up long term. But there's going to be a lot of tokens issued before we get there.
01:04:30.360 - 01:04:31.110, Speaker D: Guys.
01:04:31.560 - 01:05:06.956, Speaker A: Go ahead, Santa, just add something to that. I mean, for me, l two s are really not finance marching. I appreciate, definitionally, they might be included in that, but for me, l two s are like arbitrary and optimism, like Starquare. These are things that provide the same sort of security guarantees of an l one, but also allow for much higher throughput. And I think for that reason, Ethereum is migrating from dial up to broadband. And I think most people don't appreciate how explosive that will be. So if you think about when you have those brick phones, people will want to pay tons of money for dial up Internet.
01:05:06.956 - 01:05:20.580, Speaker A: And Defi has largely been that you're paying high transaction fees, but it provides a lot of utility. Now imagine a world where that collapses orders of magnitude. What's that going to do? Like binance, smart chain was just a foreshadowing event of what will happen in Ethereum.
01:05:21.240 - 01:05:46.510, Speaker D: Guys, this has been a really awesome panel, and I want to finish off with a more high level question. You guys have all been in DFI since DFI was created in December of 2017 with Maker Dow. That's kind of when I think DFI was really created. How has DFI changed your life? As in, like, we all have these insanely awesome DFI protocols right at our fingertips. Right. They're inside our computer. They're just a few ledger presses away.
01:05:46.510 - 01:05:49.870, Speaker D: How has that changed your life? Spencer, let's start with you.
01:05:51.540 - 01:06:06.352, Speaker F: Yeah, I think, for starters, it's changed my life because DeFi kind of offers, frankly, investment opportunities that were otherwise unimaginable to me and other participants.
01:06:06.416 - 01:06:06.644, Speaker A: Right.
01:06:06.682 - 01:06:48.400, Speaker F: I think there is so much low hanging fruit, but also just kind of meaty projects out there to take on where anyone in the world can access these opportunities, too. Right. And that's really important. But I think the biggest thing is probably just the mission. The idea that we are creating a financial system that is owned and operated by users, I think is really important, and it kind of transcends even making money. Or we're talking about how society is going to change. And so I think that's given me a mission because we now have a blueprint to get us.
01:06:48.400 - 01:06:51.820, Speaker F: It's very early, but it's definitely changed my life.
01:06:51.990 - 01:06:54.870, Speaker D: Santiago, how has DeFI changed your life?
01:06:56.360 - 01:06:56.772, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:06:56.826 - 01:07:26.844, Speaker A: For me, it's sort of been a privilege to be part of a space. Know one. It doesn't discriminate. No one cares where you come from, who you are, what you look like. If you went to Harvard or community college or didn't even go to college, and I've seen that firsthand, I feel like interacting with these developers. Someone like Hayden, no experience coding, and then teaches himself how to code and just built the most popular, one of the most valuable d five applications that is rivaling Coinbase. Just think about that, to me, blows my mind.
01:07:26.844 - 01:08:05.364, Speaker A: And I think it's very emblematic of web3 and open source systems, where it really is the best way to express human ingenuity and creativity at a global scale. And then you latch on top of that, the ability to transfer value. And I think the combination of that and you're seeing it with nfts and artists being discovered. We just hired a guy who's 18 years old, was anonymous on Twitter, and I found him on Twitter, and now he works at parafi. And to me, that's the most explosive thing of, look, if VFI works, great. If it doesn't work. I think generally this idea of open source systems where human talent is matched by capital in the most efficient way, is here to stay, and that's very explosive.
01:08:05.364 - 01:08:07.130, Speaker A: And that's, like, why I'm here.
01:08:07.520 - 01:08:11.070, Speaker D: Vance, same question. How has Defi changed your life.
01:08:13.040 - 01:08:13.356, Speaker B: For.
01:08:13.378 - 01:08:14.590, Speaker G: The better, for sure.
01:08:18.160 - 01:08:19.656, Speaker A: Vance doesn't sleep.
01:08:19.848 - 01:09:08.270, Speaker C: Yeah, less sleep for sure. I think the financial returns have been cool. And I always thought once I made x amount of money, I would go and chill on an island or something. But that has kind of caused me to kind of reflect on what I actually want to do and what is actually the purpose of what we're doing. And just like working at framework every single day with Michael, the rest of the crew, and actually doing something that if you work in a big tech company, it kind of feels like you're just like in this little cog or this little box that you can't really get out of. The DeFi is basically infinitely expansive and inclusive and you can really make it your own or what you want out of it. And I think just echoing what Spencer said, just that purpose and that mission is really kind of the thing that's really changed the, from, from kind of the free defi days.
01:09:10.000 - 01:09:23.910, Speaker B: Yeah, guys, these stories are so cool. David, I hope you scratched your itch. This was an incredible panel. Just want to thank all the panelists for hanging out with us and sharing your stories and your insights. We appreciate it.
01:09:25.320 - 01:09:26.484, Speaker A: Yeah. Thanks, guys.
01:09:26.602 - 01:09:27.268, Speaker C: Thanks, guys.
01:09:27.354 - 01:09:29.284, Speaker F: Thanks, guys. That was fun.
01:09:29.402 - 01:09:50.132, Speaker B: Yeah. Look, guys, I decided the same thing as these panelists about five years ago. I was like, I missed the early days of the Internet. There's no way I'm going to miss the next financial revolution. That's why we are all here. That is why you are watching bankless.

01:09:55.120 - 01:10:00.312, Speaker B: Of course. Risks and disclaimers, everyone. None of this was financial advice.
01:10:00.376 - 01:10:01.256, Speaker E: ETH is risky.
01:10:01.288 - 01:10:11.904, Speaker B: Crypto is risky. So is Defi. You could certainly lose what you put in. But we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone. But we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey.
