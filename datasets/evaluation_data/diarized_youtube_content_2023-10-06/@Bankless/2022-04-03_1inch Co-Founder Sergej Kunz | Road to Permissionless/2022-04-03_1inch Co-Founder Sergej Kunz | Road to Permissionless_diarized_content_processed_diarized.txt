00:00:06.730 - 00:00:37.894, Speaker A: Hey, bankless nation, we've got a special episode for you today. Not just an episode, another episode in a series called the road to Permissionless. Permissionless is going to be a conference. This is a conference that is happening May 17 through 19th. We're hyping some of the companies and projects that are coming to permissionless in hopes that you get as excited about the conference as we are. This is going to be the biggest DFI conference yet. David, there's some speakers at permissionless as well who's going to be speaking at that event.
00:00:38.012 - 00:01:47.274, Speaker B: Oh, gosh, so many and so many that we haven't totally finalized yet. But the people that we have, Chris Dixon from the mental models of web three episode that everyone knows and loves, as well as Justin Drake, the pioneer of ultrasound money, Cooper Turley the crypto NFT web three socialite, Jai from Jay from Rari, Stannie from Ave, Vance Spencer from framework, Jiho from Axi, and of course, the beloved Carly Riley from overpriced jpegs, just to name a few. And those are the ones that we have announced, not the ones that we haven't. So, Ryan, there's going to be a ton of fantastic talks and sponsors and just booths there. And one of the reasons, one of the main reasons why people go to conferences is not just to get the alpha and the information from the talks, but to make the connections from the people at the booths, the companies there, the people there, and make some friends along the way. So it's just depending on what you are looking for, conferences generally have something for you, whether you just want to make some friends or you're looking for a career, or you just want to vibe and go to the parties, permissionless is going to have it all. So that is why you should go to the permissionless conference coming in May 17 in Florida.
00:01:47.402 - 00:02:12.694, Speaker A: And here is one project that's going to be here, one inch. This is the largest biliquidity Dex aggregator out there. They started at a conference themselves. We have the co founder of one Inch on an episode today, Sergey Kuhnz. We're going to get to that discussion in just a minute. David, they also, at permissionless, they let you and I plan some of the content. So we're going to have three tracks for you guys.
00:02:12.694 - 00:02:46.514, Speaker A: There's going to be a metaverse track, it's going to be awesome. There's going to be a Defi track, and there's going to be an institution regulatory type track. So it's basically all of the content that you've come to appreciate. And like on bankless, we're trying to condense a lot of that into one conference. So we jam packed you across all of those lanes. So it's going to be really cool. Also, if you are a bankless premium member, did you know you get 30% off a conference ticket? I hope you've already got your ticket, but if you don't, there's still time.
00:02:46.514 - 00:02:57.442, Speaker A: And the best way to get that is to upgrade yourself to bankless premium membership. Get a 30% discount. You'll see a link to that discount in the show notes. David, anything else we should say?
00:02:57.576 - 00:03:16.330, Speaker B: Yeah, if you go and look at the which it's not totally published yet, but if you go look at the agenda for the content, it's basically just like three days straight of bankless live. Bankless live as a live podcast for three days. So you guys are all listeners to bankless, so we know that you're going to enjoy the content and the talks there at the conference.
00:03:16.750 - 00:03:37.294, Speaker A: Absolutely. So, guys, we are going to get right to our conversation with Sergey Kuhnz, who is the co founder of one Inch. We hope you're hyped. Bankless nation. We are super excited to introduce you to a guest on the road to permissionless series. This is Sergey Koontz. He's the co founder of one Inch, which is a fantastic decentralized exchange aggregator.
00:03:37.294 - 00:03:40.580, Speaker A: Use it all the time. Sergey, welcome to Bankless. How are you doing?
00:03:41.350 - 00:03:45.378, Speaker C: Hi, everyone. It's a pleasure to stay here. Yeah, I'm fine, thanks.
00:03:45.464 - 00:04:06.650, Speaker A: We are very excited to see you guys at permissionless, but maybe before we talk a little bit about what you're doing from a product perspective, what you're going to be doing at the conference. Can you give folks who haven't heard or used one Inch the summary? What is one inch?
00:04:07.950 - 00:05:20.690, Speaker C: So one inch is one stop access for DeFi, we call it, because we have almost every liquidity source integrated in one inch. So just imagine if you are going to buy an airplane ticket, you're not going to Emirates to Lufthansa or to Alaska Airlines. You are going to aggregate right to get the best rates. Sometimes, if you have connections between the flights, New York, Frankfurt, Dubai and so on, you need really the best airplane ticket also in the right time. And this is what we are doing for DeFi. If you're swapping one token to another token, we generate the path, the route, like on Google Maps, but more complex to exchange one asset to another asset in fully noncustodian manner, in real PTP manner. So you're interacting directly with the smart contract without trusting us by using our protocols, which are multiple times audited and verified by the community as well, and a lot of security experts.
00:05:20.690 - 00:05:56.622, Speaker C: One each network itself started with Oneish aggregation. We built it on a hackathon over two nights in ETH, New York. It was May 2019. We didn't sleep at all over two nights. It was really hard, really hard. At the end, the room behind me started to change somehow, but I was able to finalize the prototype together with Anton Bookoff, my co founder, and some of the guys whom I showed this product. They said, this is the next big thing, and this is really the next big thing.
00:05:56.622 - 00:06:25.874, Speaker C: For the DeFi. It makes no sense to exchange directly on dexes. It makes only sense to use aggregators to get the best result. And one each network is nowadays more than just aggregation protocol. This kind of order book limit, order protocol, fully permissionless manner. And there's a liquidity protocol. Multiple teams are already joined to our kind of network.
00:06:25.874 - 00:07:04.500, Speaker C: We have like 100 contributors around the globe. We have independent teams building additionally under kind of one inch umbrella, like for example, decentralized file storage protocol. DNAt, you have maybe seen them, and everyone is welcome to join. There's a grant program. We know how it is. At the beginning, we were like working one half years with London without any penny from these products, just in the night, normal jobs, days over. And we know how it is to have a need for money to build on something what is really amazing.
00:07:04.500 - 00:07:10.630, Speaker C: And that's why everyone can join and apply for a grant. One inch network.
00:07:11.370 - 00:07:19.334, Speaker A: When I describe one inch to folks, I usually say something like, look, it's expedia for Defi, right? For trading. That's generally what it is.
00:07:19.372 - 00:07:20.726, Speaker C: Short version, yeah.
00:07:20.748 - 00:07:54.740, Speaker A: And for folks, the great thing about this is if you want to actually understand everything that Sergey was saying in more detail, just use it. Just go to one inch and actually use the exchange. You can plug in, metamask, whatever noncustodial wallet you have, and try it out. I think sometimes in Defi, that's the best way to learn, is actually try it. It's very easy to use. Why do you think one inch has been able to attract so much market share? Sergey, what's been the key to your success here, and how much market share do you guys have now?
00:07:55.690 - 00:08:36.830, Speaker C: So we actually invented the aggregation in DeFi among multiple liquidity sources. One single transaction, fully atomically. That's why we have the biggest part of the market share on the market right now. There are some other guys who just started to follow us, like Xerox, for example. So they actually built limited order protocol and they came to the idea, oh, one inch solved. Really a huge problem in Defi. We combined all liquidity source in a single one by using algorithms, and zero x started to do that.
00:08:36.830 - 00:09:55.514, Speaker C: Parasop also joined us the competition, and we are hackers, like hackers, as builders on the hackathons and the competitions, and we love competition and we compete very well. If you look on the metamask, metamask is using us zero x periscope and some other liquid sources, and we have most of the market share there because we compete much better because we have more liquidity source integrated and we have highly optimized advanced algorithm which responds under 100 milliseconds. This was a really huge achievement of our team in the last month. About the market share. The thing is, if you compare us directly with Uniswap users who are using Uniswap directly on the UI, on the website of Uniswap and us, we are on the same level. So we need a little bit time to jump and be really the best DeFi application in the world. And compared to other aggregators, I don't have right numbers right now, but we have more than zero x and periswap together.
00:09:55.514 - 00:10:36.038, Speaker C: So if you count them together, we have more than just the current state, and we just solved a huge problem. And this is the key point of success. Solve a problem. And don't try to teach people that you are right or they have to use something on what you have built. Just show him what you solved as a problem and they will agree on that because you solved the problem. So you have to people who agree on what you have built, and this is the success of one inch, I.
00:10:36.044 - 00:11:24.310, Speaker B: Would say, sergey, I remember East New York 2019, where you guys put the first versions of one inch together. I remember being at that conference, and I think that's an interesting lesson for listeners, where some people think that conferences are a bunch of just fun games and parties, and it can be, but you can also make a ton of progress and get a lot of done at conferences, especially hackathons like East New York. So it's definitely one of the things we're interested in seeing at permissionless. And I'm curious with regards to the user base or the use cases of one inch. Obviously, the use case of one inch is to get the best liquidity and the best rates on your trade. But when it comes to actually who is using the product, what do you see happening? The most like what is the most frequent customer of one inch who's using your product to achieve what goals?
00:11:25.210 - 00:12:02.942, Speaker C: So we have really great distribution among different trade sizes. I would say we have more than 1 million people already using one inch. Just on Ethereum, it's like half a million on binance, smart chain 600,000 Polygon. So we have these dashboards, or public dashboards and dune analytics. Everyone can take a look on that. At the bottom of the analytics you can find the distribution, this chart you can see how is the distribution between small amounts, people who trade small amounts, people who trade bigger amounts. So we have really great distribution.
00:12:02.942 - 00:12:20.940, Speaker C: There are some who trade a lot, some who trade really small amount. But like in the middle, the graphic looks like this, in the middle. So they swap like 2310 thousand dollars. Most of our users who are doing that.
00:12:24.830 - 00:12:37.040, Speaker B: I'm curious, as we go into the world of layer two, does one inch have a layer two strategy? What's the plan for reducing gas fees and making sure that one inch can be accessible by everyone?
00:12:38.530 - 00:13:21.740, Speaker C: So we have t one inch foundation on Cayman Islands. This is fully independent organization from us. They still have some oneish tokens and they have a program for gas refund. So if you stake specific amount of tokens already from, I guess, 1000 tokens, you get a discount from 25 percentages of gas costs every month as a kind of withdrawal. And if you have 100,000 of vanish tokens staked, so you get full amount as a refund in oneish tokens every month for what you're swapping. So this is like a small mitigation to solve this problem with higher gas costs right now. This is not a future problem.
00:13:21.740 - 00:14:02.294, Speaker C: You can see the market dropped a lot and the gas costs are also low right now. But layer two is a good solution. So we were talking with Vitalik as well in the last conferences, and he also agreed on that, that layer two is a good solution for DFI sharded architecture. Ethereum 20 is something for other things, not for decentralized finance. Because in decentralized finance you need to execute atomically. In our case, we execute like advising transaction, multiple swaps on multiple exchanges, multiple markets in between. This is the benefit.
00:14:02.294 - 00:14:43.414, Speaker C: And layer two offers lowest codes, high security, and we have already optimism, integrated arbitrum, we have integrated, and the big player is coming very soon. I was talking, it's a small insight. I was talking with Alex from Zikasync in the last days, and they are working really hard to release Zikasync in the main net. It's already in a testnet. You have seen it maybe. And the thing is, the difference between Zikasync and optimism and arbitrum is that everything is already pruned on Zikasync, so it's not optimistic. Roll up.
00:14:43.414 - 00:15:08.526, Speaker C: So maybe everyone manipulated something and you have seven days on withdrawal to claim. But in Zika sync, it wouldn't work. Everything is proven. It's very fast, it's scalable. It can be scaled up to 25,000 transactions. And this is huge. It offers also to deploy applications for banks as well.
00:15:08.526 - 00:15:40.700, Speaker C: So banks are, we are talking a lot with banks around the world, and they are looking in Defi. And I guess they will also deploy a lot of things and will play with all the protocols in permission manner. For sure. We need to introduce KYC for this part. This is a different story, but also the low gas costs on layer two. It's a great thing. And high security is also very important in these terms.
00:15:41.150 - 00:16:41.210, Speaker A: Sergey. So I'm just curious, when we think about scalability in general, how do you think this shakes out? Right. So one inch is very much as an aggregator, very much a liquidity aggregator. And in the early days, that just meant liquidity on one chain, ethereum across different d five protocols. Now, increasingly, it means liquidity across multiple chains, many chains, and many different layer twos and roll ups as well. And you were talking about some challenges with atomic transactions, right? The lack of composability between various l two s. Does one inch serve as an aggregator for that sort of thing, too? How do you think this shakes out in the three to five year time horizon? Is there still one user interface where a user can kind of get liquidity from anywhere, whether it's a side chain, a main chain, a layer two, or do you think that the future of Defi is a bit more fragmented?
00:16:43.010 - 00:17:29.914, Speaker C: Yeah, we have seen the liquidity move to polygon, to binance, smart chain, and so on. And right now it makes no sense to offer swaps among multiple chains because they are not atomic. And this is a huge problem. So you have a risk that the rate can change on the other chain, and you need to mitigate this risk for sure. If you have a kind of a good bridge protocol which can mitigate this, and you exchange on Ethereum side to these liquidity pool tokens of this bridge, and they are just unlocked on the other side. But there are some risks, and it's not that easy to implement, and there's not enough liquidity right now for bridges. I would say one thing.
00:17:29.914 - 00:18:21.680, Speaker C: What you can do is potentially easy. Already we are thinking about this feature as well, swapping on Ethereum and moving it to polygon for example. In one single transaction it would potentially work. We are looking this direction as well, but I don't think so that we will aggregate this among multiple chains in the future. What looks like layer two, which is highly secure and scalable, which get the most traction. And it makes no sense to distribute liquidity among multiple chains where you have maybe higher fees than in one single l two where you have a lot of protocols deployed already. And maybe for example polygon had an outage of one day or something.
00:18:21.680 - 00:18:49.430, Speaker C: They didn't work like one day. And this is insane for the blockchain. Potentially you have bank application later working on this and everything stopped because of one bug. And this is really stupid. Yeah, I guess we had never such a situation in Ethereum. That's why ethereum has the most liquidity for sure. We had some forks and so on because of these stories with the hackers.
00:18:49.430 - 00:18:55.110, Speaker C: I don't think so. That it will happen again because the community is much bigger than before.
00:18:55.260 - 00:19:24.530, Speaker A: That's interesting. So you think there's going to be a power law winner in the l two wars? We'll have to see how that moves forward. But tell us a little bit about the road to permissionless. So we have three months until the permissionless conference. Really excited about that at the time of recording. Anyway, do you guys have any big new releases between now and then or just in the upcoming future? What's one inch? Because I know you guys are always building things. What's on the near term release? Roadmap.
00:19:25.190 - 00:19:53.340, Speaker C: So we have like 100 people around the house. Like 50 people are working on software things like developing. We have multiple fields. We have our wallet, iOS wallet. We are going to introduce NFT support in the next days if you have the luck that Apple approved support. Yeah, yeah, it's a really great already. I'm testing it already like a month.
00:19:53.340 - 00:20:34.390, Speaker C: So I was showing it on the ETH Denver a little bit to some people and it's a know like in a wallet, in one inch wallet you need NFT support for sure. In aggregation itself. We don't have yet the solution. We are looking also in this direction, but it's not on a high priority actually. You need aggregator for the NFTs because like TikTok, if you have an NFT which is high rated then you should maybe buy it and later sell it for high money or whatever, not financial advice. So we are going to introduce Android wallet. Yeah, it's almost done.
00:20:34.390 - 00:21:16.966, Speaker C: They say extra team waiting for the security audit results. It's also important in our case, we do every time when we release something, security audits. We are working on a new protocol where one inch token is used highly as utility. You need to stake and ensure this kind of insurance. We call it you stake one each token to ensure specific part of the protocol. I cannot disclose a lot of things regarding this, but this is also a game changer. We introduce permissionless manner in a specific defi field, which is not yet solved by anyone.
00:21:16.966 - 00:21:35.226, Speaker C: So, yeah, these are things what are coming in the next three months, and we have more in planning. So derivatives, aggregation this direction. It's a lot of work right now, and derivatives is also options. And this is also a huge topic for Defi from our point of view.
00:21:35.408 - 00:21:51.920, Speaker B: Sergey, that's all very exciting. I'm excited to see the things that come out of one inch in the next three months. And I'm assuming listeners are going to have a bunch of questions when they see these products roll out. So who from the one inch team is going to permissionless? So if people have questions about these releases, who can they go ask?
00:21:53.110 - 00:22:40.410, Speaker C: We have a great community team. They are also based in us. Matt, for example, he's traveling between the conferences. He's right now in Tanner, for example. They are right now in Rio and come to our booth, and we have sometimes kind of some gifts, chips, like poker chips, and some one inch tokens on it. So you can participate directly in the Dow as a contributor, kind of DaO contributor. And there are also some other people who are traveling.
00:22:40.410 - 00:23:16.134, Speaker C: There's also Nick, for example. He's more in the field of business operations. Glap. He is more with working with influencers and some other social media guys. Also, we have Natalia. She's also working very closely with the community. And, yeah, just come to our booth, get a nice t shirt, maybe a hoodie, and also some one ish tokens to participate in the Dow.
00:23:16.134 - 00:23:32.990, Speaker C: We have a really great Dow. We have a Dow treasury with already 7 million of dollars collected from the revenue streams, from the protocols itself, which should be spent for grants, for example. But everyone's welcome to participate.
00:23:33.410 - 00:23:50.870, Speaker B: So who at permissionless are you looking to meet? What kind of talent are you looking to have onboarded into the Dow? What kind of talent are you looking to help build out the one inch ecosystem? So if people are coming up to your booth, what skills should they bring if they're interested in contributing?
00:23:51.850 - 00:24:32.386, Speaker C: So we have a lot of fields where we are working right now. Like Robert said, one other people, a lot of teams, we have teams for the UI, for the web, three UI. We have teams for Android who can write Java code. You're welcome. IOS people, algorithm guys for sure. We are looking for more people to improve the algorithm, also to extend it maybe later for stock exchanges or centralized exchanges as well, and maybe combine altogether with Defi. Also people who would love to work with the community itself.
00:24:32.386 - 00:24:59.114, Speaker C: We need more people who push this defi topic around the globe for sure. We are looking for business relations as well. So if you have maybe a startup and you would like to integrate one inch, or you would like to be being integrated in one inch, or you just want, I don't know, one kind of collaboration, you're welcome to come and to talk with us.
00:24:59.312 - 00:25:29.990, Speaker B: So Sergey, the permissionless conference I think is going to be a mix between industry veterans, industry ogs, but then also a bunch of new people. A lot of people's first conference I suspect is going to be permissionless. Do you have any advice for people that have never been to a crypto conference before? Because crypto conferences are kind of a beast of their own. Do you have any advice or rules of thumb or just bits of information that perhaps the first conference goer might find useful?
00:25:31.290 - 00:26:21.382, Speaker C: My suggestion, just do it. Come to the conference. The thing is, when I was touring also around the globe before 2018 was an AWS conference for example, and some other conferences around the globe, and I didn't had the feeling this is really cool and it's like there are a lot of cool, nice people which I can just meet and talk with them directly. In crypto conferences, crypto hackathons, you can talk with anyone, just go to someone and ask what they are doing. And most of the people are really or all people which I met, they are just explaining what they are building. They are maybe traders, maybe they are building on startup. They have just an idea to build something.
00:26:21.382 - 00:26:36.620, Speaker C: We're looking for another co founder. So I like this feeling on the crypto conference that everyone loves to talk with anyone else. And this is great.
00:26:38.270 - 00:26:57.970, Speaker B: Sergey, you've talked about some of the products that are rolling out in the next three months before permissionless happens. But I want to zoom all the way out and just kind of ask about the one inch ecosystem in like the three to five year time horizon. What is the super zoomed out vision for the one inch ecosystem?
00:26:59.270 - 00:27:49.538, Speaker C: So we will see KYC introduced in DeFi, so we will have a permission defi. And this is not bad. Regulators are looking how to regulate, and banks are looking to join, but banks need to kind of regulation. So for this, we will see kind of KYC certificates, I call it potentially on Zika knowledge proof technology. It's a really good one. Technology which can be used with smart contracts highly efficiently. So we will see under one inch a lot of different products, leverage, durities, whatever else is possible to build in permissionless manner to just improve the current traditional financial system.
00:27:49.538 - 00:28:37.582, Speaker C: And I would love to see also banks participating in this and institutions who offer everyone to maybe stake some, like $100 in a protocol by using potentially also, from our point of view, also a bank. Why not? Bank is a gatekeeper for me. It's not someone we have to fight with. We need to work with them and use them as gatekeeper. So they will open the doors for everyone to stake on a specific protocol without having huge knowledge in DeFi space, and they trust the bank, and it's fine, and the people can earn on the savings. Right now, you don't get anything in Europe, at least you get, like, negative interest rate. And this is stupid.
00:28:37.582 - 00:29:28.980, Speaker C: If I have €50,000 collecting my last ten years, I have to pay like, zero, five percentage negative interest rate. This is stupid. Right now I can just buy USDC and with this money and put in unison, for example, in a specific price range where I can just generate ten percentage cpu. This is nice, but not for everyone. And that's why I would love to see a lot of institutions, also custodian services, working more with DFI. And we will have for sure, the leadership on the market, because I have the best team in the world who are shipping like beasts, like maniacs in good terms, working the nights and the days. How I do it with Anton still.
00:29:30.950 - 00:29:53.530, Speaker A: Well, Sergey, thank you so much for spending some time with us, and thank you for building one inch. Your team has one of the shippiest teams in all of crypto and all of DeFi. You guys just keep pumping out the features, and I think that's why you've gained so much of the market share. Thank you for your insights. Thank you for some of the advice today. And we're looking forward to seeing the one inch team at the permissionless conference.
00:29:54.750 - 00:29:58.538, Speaker C: Thank you very much. It was a pleasure to participate here.
00:29:58.704 - 00:30:17.906, Speaker A: Of course, guys, none of this has been financial advice, but I got to say, this is kind of career advice. You got to come to the permissionless conference. This is the space to be in crypto web three. We're changing the world. We could do that in person too. Attending conferences is important. David has taught me that I'll be there in person as well.
00:30:17.906 - 00:30:27.010, Speaker A: That's going to happen May 17 through 19th in Palm Beach, Florida, the biggest DFI conference yet. We are looking forward to seeing you there. Take care.
