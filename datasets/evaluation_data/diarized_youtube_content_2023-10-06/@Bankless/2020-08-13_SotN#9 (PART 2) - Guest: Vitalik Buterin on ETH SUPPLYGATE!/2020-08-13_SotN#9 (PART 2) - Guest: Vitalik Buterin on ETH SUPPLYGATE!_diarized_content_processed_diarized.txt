00:00:00.730 - 00:00:21.434, Speaker A: All right, everyone, welcome to state of the nation. This is episode nine. This is part two. So in part one, we caught you up on what is going on with yams. It's still going on, as a matter of fact, as we're recording part two. Also, we gave you an update on Dex volume versus centralized exchange volume. In this special part two episode, we've got Vitalik Butyrin.
00:00:21.434 - 00:00:29.462, Speaker A: We're going to talk about something called EtH Supply Gate. David, what was your take on Vitalik's comment on ETH supply gate and everything? He said?
00:00:29.596 - 00:01:08.158, Speaker B: Yeah, there's just been so much going on in Ethereum in the nation that we had to split this up into two categories. Like, yams deserved their own episode. Honestly, uniswap exploding deserved its own episode. And also going through the nuances of ETh supply gate deserves its own episode. Ryan and I, we aren't really coders, and so we wanted to get someone who could speak on a more technical level, and so we just went straight to Vitalik. And Vitalik actually loves to talk about this stuff, so we got him on the state of the nation to help us get through some of the nuances of ETH supply gate. For those of you guys that aren't familiar with ETH supply gate, I believe it all started with Pierre Richard.
00:01:08.158 - 00:02:15.670, Speaker B: Not to name names, but I'm going to do it because it's kind of like a call out, gotcha moment. So, Pierre Richard, a famous bitcoin maximalist, he's also an accountant or an auditor. Excuse me. So he's very much in this world and loves the fact that you can easily audit the bitcoin supply and is a very big proponent of bitcoiners running their own node. He's a bitcoiner to the fullest degree, and he spearheaded this ETH supply gate effort where he realized that there's no internal function to the Ethereum blockchain that allows you to audit the ETH supply. And so he made this public tweet asking, like, okay, what's the supply of ether? Do we even know how much ether there is out there? Which, coming from the camp of bitcoin or sound money is, like, sacred, right? Like, you must know what the supply of bitcoin is, because you check your own node and you check and make sure, because you run your own node and you do your own math, right? That's the bitcoiner ethos. Pierre and other bitcoiners, bitcoin maximalists, I would call them, realized that ETH doesn't really have this built into the clients, right? We don't really have that function.
00:02:15.670 - 00:02:51.362, Speaker B: And so we actually didn't really have a quick and easy answer as to how much ETh is out there because it's not built into the system. Now, that doesn't mean that the amount of ether is unknown. It's just importantly just a different way in construction between bitcoin and Ethereum. And that's about as much as I know. And so we'll pick it up with Vitalik when we turn to Vitalik. There's just one last piece I wanted to bring up before we turn to Vitalik, and I got into the conversation as to why bitcoiners are doing this kind of like gotcha thing. It's a very gotcha moment.
00:02:51.362 - 00:03:23.838, Speaker B: There's not real much substance behind it. Vitalik will explain more, but I asked Vitalik, where is this motivation coming? Like, why are so many bitcoin maxis trying to have this gotcha moment for Ethereum? And his answer, while we recorded it, might have gotten jumbled by the Internet. So I'm just going to reiterate it here. But Vitalik answered that he thinks that there's a lot of people who are really insecure and worried that Ethereum is becoming completely legitimate in everyone's eyes. And so I'll leave it at that. Ryan, if you want to have any last comments before we hop into the Vitalik interview, let's hear them.
00:03:23.924 - 00:03:48.234, Speaker A: Yeah, that's know, just one point of clarification. Of course, ETh supply was known. It's just not built into the geth and parity client. So like, you can view it on Etherscan, you can view it in all block explorers. It's been charted over time, coin metrics, other analytics firms chart. It's just not a function in the geth or parity node. So that was really the point of contention.
00:03:48.234 - 00:04:28.334, Speaker A: And you know what, I guess maybe I'll end with this and we'll jump to the interview. Actually, I ask the question every what something cool you did in crypto this week, right? And last Saturday, Pierre answered the question and he said, I helped Ethereum figure out its supply issues, something like that. And I was like, you know what, I think this is helpful. This is part of going through the gates of what it takes to become a reserve asset and a money. And Ethereum should have a good answer to this question. And I think Vitalik does, quite frankly. And I believe we will see the click here for ETH supply button in future Ethereum clients.
00:04:28.334 - 00:04:33.890, Speaker A: Whether it's ETH 10 or ETH two. So with that, David, let's get to the interview with Vitalik.
00:04:36.330 - 00:05:18.974, Speaker B: All right, Vitalik, welcome to the Nation. We are doing this very quick episode to kind of just get right to the heart of things. For context, there has been this pretty avid movement in the bitcoin maximalist camp. I would categorize them, not the bitcoiners, the bitcoin maximalists who are going after the difficulty of auditing the ETH supply. And so there are a lot of different conversations to have that are relevant here, a lot of different nuances to get into. And Ryan and I aren't really all that technical. And so we're just going straight to the source of the guys that can speak the best about this subject.
00:05:18.974 - 00:05:28.870, Speaker B: So we're bringing on Vitalik to help us kind of dig through this actually kind of difficult and nuanced conversation. So, Vitalik, thank you for coming on the state of the nation.
00:05:29.450 - 00:05:32.440, Speaker C: Thanks. It's good to be back in the nation again.
00:05:33.370 - 00:06:11.074, Speaker A: Awesome. Hey, Vitalik, I'm going to start with maybe a tweet that I saw, and this is not the only tweet, of course. This is just one of a flavor of some of the conversations that have been going on. But I just happened to see this, I think on the eigth was that Saturday, Sunday something. And it's basically this sentiment coming from, I think, members of the bitcoin community, maybe more skewed maximalists. And it says something like this, the Ethereum community can't figure out what the total outstanding supply of ETH is. This is a major problem and showcases why ETH is not good money.
00:06:11.074 - 00:06:21.480, Speaker A: So comments like that, I guess maybe like my first question is that right? Can the community, Ethereum community not figure out what the total outstanding supply of ETH is?
00:06:21.930 - 00:07:02.180, Speaker C: No, and I think the Ethereum community definitely knows what the total outstanding supply of ETH is. And it's like about 112.1 million, right? And you can see that by just in a whole bunch of ways. There's all of the different scripts that have been run the past few days. You definitely shouldn't trust them. But the fact that all of the different e supply calculators kind of on the Internet have basically agreed to the answer within a factor of about 100,000. You can even look at the Ethereum protocol and know what you know about on call rates, and you can try to estimate the Ethereum supply from that, and you can get somewhere very close.
00:07:02.180 - 00:07:23.130, Speaker C: The supply is about 112.1 million right now. I think people like this, they're definitely kind of engaging in a very serious modern bailey fallacy here. Are you familiar with that term? It's a kind of popular slate circodexism.
00:07:24.190 - 00:07:25.226, Speaker B: Yeah, please.
00:07:25.408 - 00:08:14.026, Speaker C: Yeah. So basically the idea is that this is a kind of old medieval terminology where kind of in a castle, I think the mod is that it's kind of well protected castle that you got the wall, you got the tower, it's very hard to invade. And then the bailey is this kind of farmland below. And the idea is that normally everyone's kind of happily off farming the bailey, but then whenever someone attacks, everyone kind of retreats back to the mod. Right. And so the idea is it's this kind of argumentative dark arts technique where basically you have one position, which is kind of the bailey that you kind of state publicly, and it tends to be a much more extreme position. And then if someone actually challenges you in the extreme position, you just kind of say, no, you don't get it.
00:08:14.026 - 00:09:43.720, Speaker C: I just meant this a kind of other smaller, totally reasonable thing. And you can see people in politics saying this sort of, or being in this kind of pattern all the time, right? But here, basically the MoD is that there doesn't exist a kind of convenience function that's very easily accessible from ethereum clients that lets you kind of go and click and say the Ethereum supply is like 112-02-4589 point, or whatever it is. But the Bailey that they try to kind of implicitly go after, I think, is this idea like, oh my God, no one knows what the Ethereum supply is. Maybe someone snuck in an extra 25 million coins. If someone actually did sneak in an extra 25 million coins, then yes, you probably should be kind of selling and shorting eth because they're going to do something terrible with that 25 million and probably dump it before everyone realizes what's going on. But nothing remotely close to that has happened. Right? So this is all basically this kind of dispute that has just been blown horribly out of proportion about a difference, of really about, was it 100,000 coins, a few thousand coins? Pretty much nothing, right? Because 100,000 coins get issued every week.
00:09:43.720 - 00:11:05.918, Speaker C: So that's kind of, I guess the core of how I see this. Another analogy, I might add, is in neither Ethereum nor bitcoin, nor most cryptocurrencies, can you estimate, say, the genie coefficient, right, and the genie coefficient is important. The genie coefficient is really important, because if you're going to create a new monetary system, it's important to know how much inequality the monetary system has, because if it's introducing a really huge amount, then maybe that's not a monetary system that you want to support. And cryptocurrencies are, of course, pseudonymous. You can have many people sharing an account, you can have one person having many accounts, and there's just not a good way of actually estimating this number. And so you could imagine a proponent of fiat currency kind of just pressing really hard on this point and going around asking, what is the genie coefficient of bitcoin? What is the GD coefficient of bitcoin? You don't know? Then how do you know that you're not introducing a plutocratic dystopia on the order of North Korea? Obviously, that argument is crazy. And we have ideas roughly about what kind of inequality and concentration there is in these systems.
00:11:05.918 - 00:12:31.274, Speaker C: And we actually know that. For example, as far as all the cryptocurrencies go, bitcoin and ETH are actually both among the more equal ones. A lot of the other big, heavily pre mined and heavily, kind of non transparently ico'd all coins, they tend to be very concentrated, and BTC and ETH are not. But that's one analogy, right? So the mod that they can claim, the thing that they basically are claiming is that the total supply of ETh just is this parameter that clients just haven't created this convenience function for, because there just hasn't been much demand for it right now. One thing you might say is like, well, if we don't have this auditing and we don't have this convenience function, does that mean that there's actually a significant risk that someone will somehow sneak 25 million ETH into the system? Like, okay, maybe right now it's a disparity of 100,000, but if we're not auditing, maybe someone will sneak in 25 million. And I think that kind of completely misunderstands the security model of ethereum, and I would even argue the security model of kind of cryptocurrency generally. Basically, I think this is kind of a bit of a deeper kind of rabbit holy philosophical point.
00:12:31.274 - 00:14:33.490, Speaker C: But I think a lot of people think of verification of cryptocurrency as in of wrongly being a kind of very piecemeal kind of fact by fact thing, when in reality verification of a blockchain is all or nothing. And to give a totally different example of this, there were some older blockchain scaling protocols that basically said things like, we're going to create a scalable blockchain that makes it easy for you to verify the presence of your own coins, right? So basically, imagine like a highly scalable blockchain, even bitcoin sv size or something like completely insane like that. But where you have a litecoin protocol that makes it very easy to just verify kind of the history and the kind of provenance of your own coin. You have your UtxO, here's the two parents, here's the three grandparents, here's the five great grandparents, and so on and so forth, right? All the way back to Genesis. And that's going to be a substantial amount, but maybe a few hundred megabytes, but you can verify it. The reason why that kind of verification is just totally stupid and pointless is because in order to verify that your coin is valid, in order to verify that kind of your coin will be accepted by people, you don't just have to verify the prominence of your coin, you have to verify that your coin is part of a chain where the entirety of that chain is valid, right? Because even if the prominence of my coin is completely valid, if your coin is in there and your coin got double spent and the double spending got accepted by the network, then that is a chain which is fundamentally kind of invalid and corrupted. And so that is a chain that, once people figure that out, is just going to get rejected by the ecosystem, right? And so the fact that I have a coin that's totally valid within the context of a chain that's totally invalid and it's going to be rejected, that's worth pretty much nothing, right? And so the only verification that matters is verifying that the entire chain and all the rules of consensus have been kind of fully satisfied.
00:14:33.490 - 00:15:43.900, Speaker C: And it's the same situation here. Basically, there's no value in kind of privileging one specific rule, whether it's the rules about issuance or whether it's the rules about, were the ECSA signatures all correct or whatever, you have to basically verify all the rules, right? And that's what clients do, they verify all the rules. Basically. The reality is that if he wants to verify that Ethereum is a system that satisfies the goals of being a blockchain, that satisfies the goals of being a valid kind of substrate for ETh as money and for Dai as money and for whatever other money you like that's on Ethereum, then there's no value in looking at one single consensus rule in isolation. You would also have to verify that smart contracts have never been illegally hacked. You might have to verify that transactions without valid ECDSA signatures were never included you have to verify that your coins were never invalidly taken away. You have to verify that everyone else's coins were never invalidly taken away.
00:15:43.900 - 00:16:57.090, Speaker C: Specifically verifying that this one consensus rule has been satisfied as a kind of, it's focusing on one specific thing, when in reality you have to focus on everything together and you really have to think about it in kind of two parts, right? The first part is, were the consensus rules that we think the consensus rules are actually followed. And the way that we know that is, well, there's a whole bunch of clients and a whole bunch of clients have processed it, and there's lots of people in the ethereum ecosystem that have run those clients. So I talk about the concept of herd immunity here, right? Fortunately, it's 2020, and herd immunity is an analogy that pretty much everyone understands. But the idea is that if you have 1000 people in a whole bunch of places in the community that have run a node and have verified each individual piece of the chain, then realistically the chain is valid. And it's incredibly unrealistic that an invalid chain is just going to sneak through all of them. Right. This is the sort of thing that we could kind of rabbit hole deeper if we want to talk about the philosophy of sharding, for example.
00:16:57.090 - 00:17:37.182, Speaker C: But that's a whole other topic. But that's the first thing, right? The verifying that the consetus rules were followed. And we have multiple implementations, lots of implementations. Lots of them have sunk the chain at one point or another. Lots of them have verified any individual block. And then the second piece is, okay, well, given that we know these consensus rules, let's take the consensus rules and let's figure out what the supply is going to be today, and what the supply is going to be at kind of different realistic points in the future that we care about. And if we want to estimate what the supply is today, we can run some of those scripts that determine exactly how many uncles there are.
00:17:37.182 - 00:18:07.400, Speaker C: You can do estimates based on basically the more exact the number you want, the more kind of work you have to do. And if you're willing to actually process the entire chain, you can get a number down to the last way. But the value down to the last way is not very useful because 14 seconds later there's going to be another two point something eth introduced. But if you want that number, you can get it. But if you're okay with five or six decimal places, you can do a bit less work. And if you're okay with three decimal places, you can do even less work. And so there you go.
00:18:08.810 - 00:18:32.110, Speaker B: Okay, so, Vitalik, I'm going to try and recap all of this as short of a bit as bitcoiners. And the bitcoin blockchain has this function built into it that just does the audit of bitcoin. Right. And it's built into the protocol, which is really aligned with bitcoin or values, because they really like auditability. That's part of the proposition of bitcoin.
00:18:33.970 - 00:18:40.318, Speaker C: It's a function that's built into the bitcoin client. If ethereum clients wanted to, they could build in that function too. It wouldn't even take a hard fork.
00:18:40.414 - 00:18:40.674, Speaker A: Right.
00:18:40.712 - 00:19:39.720, Speaker B: Okay. And so bitcoiners found out that there isn't this function in ethereum clients, and so they found this opportunity to nitpick about that, when in reality, the reason why we know that no one has slipped in any ether in any ways that don't fit the rules of consensus is because we haven't hard forked the chain. We haven't had a hard fork. If somebody wanted to slip in ether in a way that would be invisible to people, it would result in a hard fork. And that thing either being invalid or there being a hard fork, which we would have known. So. And so this kind of then goes into the second criticism, which after you pressed some, not you specifically, but also you specifically, but also people like Chris Berniski and Eric Voorhees and Andreas Antonopoulos, after they brought up the issue that this is mostly a non issue, it's kind of like this gotcha moment.
00:19:39.720 - 00:20:06.202, Speaker B: The conversation then kind of turned to, well, ethereums don't even run their own node because that's just not in their culture, which I agree. It's actually not really in our culture to run our own node. I don't run my own node. I haven't in a while. I don't think Ryan runs his own node. What you're saying. Oh, you do? Pardon me? But what you're saying, vitalik, is there's this herd immunity where not every single individual needs to run their own node.
00:20:06.202 - 00:20:12.170, Speaker B: We just need to have enough individuals. So to the point where we get sufficient decentralization. Was all of that accurate?
00:20:12.330 - 00:21:12.734, Speaker C: Yeah, I think so. And I definitely think that it would be nice if we could get more of a node running culture in Ethereum in the future. But I think we do have to kind of think pragmatically about this, right? Because right now I think a lot of people don't run Ethereum nodes because ethereum nodes are expensive and ethereum nodes are expensive because we have these big hulking blocks with twelve and a half million gas. And the reason we have big hulking blocks with twelve and a half million gas is because right now the gas price is, I think an hour ago when I checked, it was like, was it 240 Gwe or something? And if we had not done those increases, it would probably be like 2000 Gwe. Or more realistically, everyone would have left Ethereum, and everyone would be on Ethereum classic or Neo, or one of these other chains. In the short term, there's this unfortunate kind of trade off that we do have to make. And I do think that the Ethereum community, the bitcoin community, really values the accessibility of reading the chain.
00:21:12.734 - 00:21:54.954, Speaker C: But I think the Ethereum community also really values the accessibility of writing to the chain. So accessibility of reading the chain means how much does it cost to run a node? Basically accessibility of writing the chain. How much does it cost to send a transaction? And those two are in conflict, because the more space there is, the cheaper the transactions. But the harder it is to run a node, the less space, the more expensive the transactions, but the easier it is to run a node. So in the short term, there's not much that we can do. But at the same time, this gets back to one of these other weird talking points that I saw yesterday, that people are kind of gotcha quote, tweeting this tweet for myself, like four years ago, and I said, the Internet of money should not cost five cents. Five cents a transaction.
00:21:54.954 - 00:22:22.346, Speaker C: And I'm like, yeah, you're right, it shouldn't. The fact that it costs more than five cents a transaction right now is terrible. And that's exactly why we've been working on charting and bossway and roll ups and all this stuff for the past years. If you send a transaction in loop ring or ZK sync, or one of these systems, we can calculate the transaction cost on one of those right now. What's the eth gas station gas price right now? I guess it 222 41 of those.
00:22:22.368 - 00:22:24.298, Speaker B: Last I checked, it was 273.
00:22:24.464 - 00:23:06.450, Speaker C: Oh, wow, that's zero glaze celsius. Excellent. Let's round it up to 300 and be like spartans that are lazy at math. And 300 multiplied by about, let's say 500 gas per transaction that happens inside of a roll up. And so we get to 15,000 guay. And then 15,000 guay, multiply by, was it about $400? And we get about 6 million. And this is all in units of one, over a billion.
00:23:06.450 - 00:23:55.846, Speaker C: And so it's about $0.6. So even in the context of today's sky high gas prices, if you personally today are living inside of loop ring or Zksync, then in optimal conditions you get transaction fees of 0.6 cents. If the batches are a bit smaller, you might get transaction fees of like three or $0.04. But basically the Internet of money is still alive, and it's called highly scalable ethereum layer two. Basically the future that we're working toward where we have roll ups, where we have scaling another one that hasn't been given enough, the, you know, they were kind of very hyped up a couple of years ago, and then I think a lot of people got the impression that they kind of went away and were dead. But no, they have a beta running on mainnet and you can go and use it.
00:23:55.846 - 00:24:24.580, Speaker C: And I think tether is planning on migrating to it soon. So after we have these scaling solutions, then we can consider, or we will be able to have both very high scalability and low cost of running a node. And for example, the cost of running an e two node is definitely already much lower than the cost of running an Eth one node. So that's exactly the sort of thing that I think we're working towards and I think we can have more of in the future.
00:24:25.430 - 00:25:28.520, Speaker B: So Vitalik, this conversation came out of that tweet from somebody who I would classify in the bitcoin maxi camp, and it was another one of these gotcha tweets. And this whole eth supply gate thing has been classified by a number of people. Like Andreas Antonopoulos is one of the people that I think is the person that coined the whole thing, the gotcha, the eth gate gotcha moment, gotcha question. And so it seems to be like there's a certain camp of people coming out of the bitcoin maximalist cohort that are trying and going for these gotcha things for whatever reason. And so it delves back into this whole tribal mentality where there are a couple bitcoiners who are really loud out there trying to poke holes in the Ethereum value proposition. What's your take on that? Why are there so many people that seem to be motivated with these gotcha things without actually contributing anything of real value either to the ecosystem or to the conversation going on? What's up with this?
00:25:28.890 - 00:25:32.230, Speaker C: I think people are scared that Ethereum is gaining legitimate.
00:25:36.730 - 00:26:09.490, Speaker A: So I'm a bitcoin hat on and play devil's advocate. So here's a devil's advocate here. So fact that Ethereum is five years old, not have a eth supply calculation function in parity. Or about the prior. I can picture maybe somebody saying that because ether didn't write calculating supply.
00:26:11.430 - 00:26:11.746, Speaker C: In.
00:26:11.768 - 00:26:21.266, Speaker A: Its clients as an easy button that you press, its priority is not to be a fixed supply sort of asset.
00:26:21.378 - 00:26:31.900, Speaker C: The reason you can imagine someone saying that is perhaps because I said that myself on Twitter, I think about two days ago as an attempt to kind of summarize what I thought the best argument of the camp was.
00:26:32.910 - 00:26:35.980, Speaker A: So you did summarize that. Okay, I didn't read that.
00:26:39.390 - 00:27:59.960, Speaker C: My words were something like the fact that Ethereum clients community doesn't seem to care about having a convenience function for calculating the Ethereum total supply just shows that Ethereum is kind of much less interested in kind of the sound money religion. I use the term religion mutually, by the way. So ethereum and bitcoin are both part of the cypherpunk religion, for example. And if you want a sound money, then it's better to have a money whose community kind of subscribes to the sound money religion, right? Which is a fair argument. I think that's one way to kind of understand a lot of their positions. Like you want to have a money whose community subscribes to the sound money religion, you want a money whose community subscribes to the immutableism religion and so on and so forth, right? It's kind of that kind of Richard Dixon kind of rationally crazy sort of line where being incredibly attached to something can be an advantage if it basically kind of makes it more difficult to push a certain thing through someone or through a group of people. So I think that's fair.
00:27:59.960 - 00:29:05.386, Speaker C: Ethereums definitely value the sound money religion less than people in the bitcoin camp do. And to be fair, the whole ethos, money meme is barely a year old, whereas the bitcoin is money meme is many years old. So I think, first of all, if Ethereum people want to, that's something can change over time. But second, I think it's important to note that there's a limit to the extent to which we can comply with some of these values while the Ethereum 2.0 roadmap is not yet complete, right? And this is another thing that I think is important to kind of understand, right? Because we have this looming transition to proof of stake and then sharding and then killing the proof of work chain. And during that whole transition, we're going to see massive changes to the reward formula. We're also going to see fee market reform, aka Ep 1559, implemented at some point.
00:29:05.386 - 00:30:07.838, Speaker C: We're going to see, actually see for the first time, how many people are willing to stake and what exactly the actual issuance rates and what exactly the actual burning rates are. And out of this it could end up being that the eth supply growth rate is negative, right? I mean, if fees continue the way they are today, the supply growth rate is definitely going to be negative. In which case the analogy I made is like, if a zero growth rate is sound money, then what does a negative growth rate mean? Does it mean even supersonic money? But this is all future stuff, and this is all kind of unknown. And there's definitely aspects to the ethereum culture that kind of explicitly understand that. As I think I summarized a couple of years ago, bitcoin people think bitcoin is 80% complete. Ethereum people think ethereum is 40% complete. I think now maybe instead of 40%, it's more somewhere between kind of 50 and 60%.
00:30:07.838 - 00:31:19.190, Speaker C: But it's that kind of mentality, right? And so people understand that there is this technological roadmap ahead, there are these kind of economic unknowns ahead, and it definitely is something that aspires to have certain economic protocols. But what's the point of verifying that? The current rules are being kind of misatified to this extreme extent of having kind of all of these different functions for verifying it. If we know that these are things that are going to change in one or two years anyway, and after the one or two years, I think people, and after the economics get nailed down, that's something that people can and will take very seriously. And people are taking very seriously. Right. So like for example, we see these east two staking reward calculators and we see these e two issuance calculators. And there is this growing community of people that do take east two economics kind of extremely seriously because they see that the east two economic model is something that's been made with a lot of care and love, and it's this thing that's theoretically meant to kind of stick with us for the long haul.
00:31:19.190 - 00:31:35.580, Speaker C: Basically, we need to take this kind of more long termist perspective and look at, well, it's funny to say, yeah, caring about what will happen three years from now is a long term estimate. Basically, ETH two will change things.
00:31:36.030 - 00:32:15.234, Speaker A: Yeah. Also another narrative that pops up, David mentioned one, which is bitcoiners or maximists will say, hey, ethereum's don't run their own nodes and that's a big problem, which many do, by the way. But another, I guess, narrative that gets put out there is that Vitalik and know Dev overlords here act as know federal Open Market committee, basically the FOMC of the US. And they set issuance, they set supply. Can you talk about that? I mean, what's to prevent the FOMC.
00:32:15.362 - 00:32:16.040, Speaker C: Of.
00:32:18.750 - 00:32:33.840, Speaker A: Would, as they would phrase it, from increasing issuance to something and maybe like funding a yacht or funding your favorite charity or funding, I don't know, ETh two development even.
00:32:36.050 - 00:33:10.918, Speaker C: Sure. So I think people kind of further away from the Ethereum community definitely, they definitely overestimate the war dictator Vitalik, but they also overestimate even the Ethereum line of FOMC. So first of mean, you probably remember this yourself, right? When the issuance reduction from three ETH per block to two ETH per block was happening, that was not core dev driven, that was not Vitalik driven. I think that was even driven by Ethereum community members that were in what was maybe not yet called, but starting to become the ethos money camp. Right. Does that sound accurate to you?
00:33:11.084 - 00:33:33.810, Speaker A: Yeah, from my recollection, I think people who are holding ETH and who are believers more in the idea that ETH is a sound collateral sort of drive those sorts of changes, and they'd have a lot to say. I know I would. I could speak to David too. If issuance were to increase for something that was outside of the social contract, for instance.
00:33:34.150 - 00:33:54.600, Speaker C: Right, exactly. Now let's look at another dimension. Gas limit increases. So gas limit increases. The interesting thing is, so if you go right now to Etherscan IO chartgaslimit, right, open up that page. You see like the graph, right? And it looks like a bit like a kind of city skyline. It's got.
00:33:54.600 - 00:33:58.186, Speaker C: I guess I'll wait for you to open that up.
00:33:58.288 - 00:34:00.202, Speaker B: Sorry, what was that URL one more time.
00:34:00.336 - 00:34:05.610, Speaker C: Etherscan IO chartgaslimit chart.
00:34:07.550 - 00:34:09.100, Speaker B: There we go. Yes.
00:34:10.030 - 00:34:42.040, Speaker C: You see the city skyline. So let's look at that chart kind of very closely, right? So one of the things that you might notice is if you look at kind of the beginning stages of that chart, open up and search on Google images, us historical income tax rate like images. Yeah, images. Let's see if we can find a good one. Just the second one. The second marginal tax rates. Right.
00:34:42.040 - 00:35:39.958, Speaker C: So see how the chart kind of jump back and forth between the two? Just like look at the ether scan, look at the, back to the taxes. Ether scan taxes. So I actually made this point in a blog post kind of. Actually, this is another one of my points when I was being kind of self critical of Ethereum governance a few years ago, where basically these charts both look kind of similar, right? They have this pattern of staying very cleanly at one exact position for a long time and then jumping and then staying very horizontal and then jumping. And this is a property of basically a magic number that gets constantly renegotiated by a committee of technocrats. Right? Like, if you have a number that's constantly renegotiated by a committee of technocrats, then this is what it looks like. Now, let's look at the chart more recently.
00:35:39.958 - 00:36:33.078, Speaker C: If you look at specifically what happens after January 2019, right? Like, look at the last kind of bar there and then kind of after. So notice, zoom out again. Just refresh maybe notice how that last 20% of the chart looks much less clean than the first 80%. Do you see that? The first 80% looks incredibly clean, and then after that, it gets very choppy. So here's what's happening, right? Basically, what's happening is that the gas limits, at the beginning, they actually were essentially set by a committee that sets magic numbers, right? Basically the Ethereum foundation. Maybe one Time Lord dictator, the Vitalik said, hey, guys, maybe we should increase the gas limit. And all the miners were like, yes, my lord, we should raise the gas limit.
00:36:33.078 - 00:37:09.898, Speaker C: And they changed their settings with the clients and they raised the gas limit. And this was admittedly how governance worked in the earlier days of Ethereum and when we were able to kind of pull off the Dow fork and these other that. But more recently, what's been happening was the latest two gas limit increases were minor driven. Right. Basically, there was very little input from the, from Lord Vitellik. There was very little input from the Federal Open Markets committee. It was basically miners initiating and in some cases miners disagreeing.
00:37:09.898 - 00:37:33.006, Speaker C: Like, there are a couple of mining pools switched from 8 million to 10 million. A couple of other mining pools stayed at 8 million. And so you saw the gasoline kind of going, bouncing up and down. And even when it got to 10 million, if you look into kind of the daily average, it wouldn't be 10 million, it would be maybe 9.9 or 9.8 million, because there was this kind of ongoing disagreement and the gas polymer would still be kind of bobbing up and down a lot. Right.
00:37:33.006 - 00:38:12.146, Speaker C: And the most recent one, the rise from ten to 12.5, you can see even more clearly how bungled that was. Right. Basically what happened was that, I remember back in May, I think it was a spark pool. I remember it was. Shin reached out to me and he basically said, hey, vitalik, we're considering maybe we should increase the gas limit because transaction fees are getting a bit higher. And this was back when it was about 20 to 30 gwe, right? And I replied at the time, maybe no, we shouldn't, because that'll get Lord Peter Salagi Salaj.
00:38:12.146 - 00:39:07.546, Speaker C: And I'm sure I'm buggling the name angry. And Lord Peter Salaj is doing a lot of great work, and we should not be making his life harder because he and his team have been doing a lot of great work on kind of making GEF work more efficiently. And if we're just going to go and kind of undo those efficiency gains with the stroke of a pen, that's not a very good thing. And that could cause kind of dos issues and all of this stuff. Now, six weeks later, the transaction fee situation got way more serious. And I guess the mining pools by themselves, they talked among each other, they talked in each other in their WeChat groups and in the telegram, and had some discussions. And they started kind of bumping it up from ten to maybe it was like twelve or twelve and a half.
00:39:07.546 - 00:39:26.980, Speaker C: And this happened without permission from myself, without permission from the Federal Open Markets Committee, without permission from any of these people. And I learned about it when I saw a message on Twitter. And I checked on Etherscan, like, oh, my God, there's a block with a gas limit of like 10.4 million, and it's rising now.
00:39:27.910 - 00:39:30.020, Speaker A: Indeed. Peter was not happy.
00:39:33.190 - 00:40:11.726, Speaker C: Peter was not happy. And the interesting thing about the rise was that apparently they did not even agree on whether they would rise to twelve or 12.5, right? Like, I remember when the gas limit went up, it rose. And then I think it might have even briefly gone above 12 million and then below 12 million. And it kind of bounced around. And it seemed clear that there were some people voting ten, some people voting twelve, some people voting 12.5. And then if you go back to ether scan, you could see the ether scan chart gasoline, you could see the day by day volatility in the gas limit because there was this kind of gas limit voting war going on.
00:40:11.726 - 00:41:14.660, Speaker C: And after another couple of weeks, I guess one of the mining pools that was voting twelve relented and went up to 12.5. And now we have 12.5. Right? So this whole thing was initiated, driven, carried through by miners without core dev permission, without Lord Vitalik permission, without any of this stuff. And so in light of this, how can you call Ethereum governance centralized. It's clearly this kind of complicated, multipolar kind of tug of usually cooperation, occasionally a bit of war between these multiple kind of highly independent and kind of diverse people from diverse backgrounds. And realistically, I think issuance is similar, right? Like, issuance is not going to go up just because one group of people wills it. And I think there's definitely a strong enough constituency that will just fight to the death against issuance increases that people can feel kind of safe and sound that issuance increases are not going to happen.
00:41:15.770 - 00:41:46.990, Speaker B: I think the answer to the question, Vitalik, as to how you can call Ethereum governed and centralized is by just totally foregoing one person's responsibility to understand nuance and kind of just cater to their audience and tell people what they want to hear. So in light of all that, Vitalik, I commend you for keeping your head above all the mess that you can easily find in the depths of Twitter. And I thank you for being a sober voice in a very loud, messy.
00:41:50.530 - 00:41:52.720, Speaker C: Mean, I'm always glad to say stuff.
00:41:55.110 - 00:41:58.834, Speaker B: All right, Ryan, do you have any last questions before we wrap this up?
00:41:59.032 - 00:42:25.958, Speaker A: No, Vitalik, that was, that was super helpful. Thank you. I think folks will be interested to hear all this. I guess maybe one last question, just because it's super topical, and we will be releasing this sometime today, is back to those gas prices. They are going vertical right now. There's craziness, something called a yam token, which is going crazy. There's always something happening in defi.
00:42:25.958 - 00:42:46.910, Speaker A: It appears like ethereum block space is becoming more and more valuable. Some of that value is driven from speculative value at this point. Is that going to continue to be the case? Are you seeing any hope around the corner with some of this layer two, scalability before e two ships.
00:42:47.490 - 00:43:13.606, Speaker C: A very good question. I think I have a bit of an answer which has to do with roll ups and specifically optimistic roll ups. So we know, right, that there is the two families of roll ups. There's a ZK, there's the optimistic. The ZKs are alive already, but the optimistics are still a few months away. And the reason why the optimistics are a few months away is because they're trying to do something much more complicated than the ZKs, right. The ZKs are just trying to support payments and maybe a Dex.
00:43:13.606 - 00:44:52.694, Speaker C: The optimistic ones are trying to support full EVM execution inside of a roll up, and there's a lot of devilishly hard challenges involved in that. So basically, one of the silver linings of this, though, is that I think optimistic roll ups are going to be ready for kind of non financial applications and for natively issued assets and some of these other things before they're ready for DeFi. And the reason for this is that for a roll up to be useful for Defi, it has to be really, security wise nailed down, right? And if the security breaks, then all hell breaks loose and people kind of lose a whole bunch of money. But if you just want to use a roll up, say for Reddit community points or some other kind of lower value thing, then the nice thing is that the security requirements on the roll up are much lower. Right? And the reason is that if it turns out that the roll up smart contract is broken, then as long as your roll up scheme is only using kind of assets that are native to that protocol, so it's not using external assets, all you need to do is just deploy a new smart contract, and that new smart contract can have the fixes and everyone can just be told to kind of pay attention to the new smart contract and accept the new smart contract as being kind of the canonical definition of those assets instead. Right? And so basically, kind of when you're using an application that only has native assets. So like an example of this would be like if you imagine a version of Auger that only uses rep for everything, right? Because the rep is kind of defined by the Ethereum protocol.
00:44:52.694 - 00:45:17.474, Speaker C: And if auger breaks, and if Auger works that way, then if Auger were to break, then they could just hard fork rep then. So for those kinds of applications, the security requirements are lower. And so I expect those things to be among the first use cases of some of the optimistic roll ups that are coming out. And I'm looking forward to those optimistic roll ups and I think they are going to come out quite soon.
00:45:17.592 - 00:45:28.280, Speaker A: So we've got ZK right now with loop ring and others that's happening right now. Optimistic of the type that you were talking about. Are we weeks, months away, do you think?
00:45:30.570 - 00:45:42.230, Speaker C: I think the optimistic roll up teams that I know are definitely saying like a couple of months, but I do think we'll have a kind of test versions even before that.
00:45:42.380 - 00:46:06.750, Speaker A: Very good. Well, it does seem like the high gas fees are pushing and accelerating hopefully some of these efforts, because it is becoming very urgent and kind of centerpoint for the Ethereum community right now. Vitalik, this has been absolutely fantastic. Thank you so much for joining the bankless nation in this special session. We appreciate it.
00:46:06.900 - 00:46:08.640, Speaker C: Thank you. It's been good to be here.
00:46:09.090 - 00:46:09.500, Speaker A: Take care.
