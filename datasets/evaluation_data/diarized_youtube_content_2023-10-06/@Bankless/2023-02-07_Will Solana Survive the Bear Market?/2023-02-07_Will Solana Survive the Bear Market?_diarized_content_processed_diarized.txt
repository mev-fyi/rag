00:00:00.170 - 00:00:14.106, Speaker A: Is Solana gonna make it through the bear? The network will make it. I mean, like, the tech is there. The code is there. It's awesome. People like using it. We have enough traction and enough devs that want to keep this thing going. The rest is, like, I think, very much macro dependent.
00:00:14.106 - 00:00:33.570, Speaker A: That's, like, a big question for all of the smart contract platforms except for Ethereum. How do you feel about Solana's chances then? Honestly, I feel pretty good. We have this thriving and NFT community. It means the underlying base layer will survive. Is, like, the web three NFT business model survive? I think so. And if that's true, I think Salana survives.
