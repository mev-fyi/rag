00:00:13.770 - 00:00:31.878, Speaker A: Welcome to Bankless, where we explore the frontier of Internet money and Internet finance. This is how to get started, how to get better, and how to front run the opportunity. This is Ryan. Sean Adams. I'm with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless. David, how are you doing, my friend?
00:00:32.044 - 00:00:38.498, Speaker B: Super good. Ryan just came out of this interview with Stani Kolachov from Ave. Ryan, what did you think of this interview?
00:00:38.594 - 00:00:39.914, Speaker A: Man, it was so much fun.
00:00:39.952 - 00:00:42.710, Speaker C: I think it's a perfect next episode.
00:00:42.790 - 00:01:35.690, Speaker A: From our last episode with Vance from Framework, where Vance talked a lot about these unique characters in the Defi space, these crypto native founders. And he actually mentioned Stani by name as one of the archetypes of these types of founders. And we're going to be doing a series. The next few episodes, including this one, are a series where we actually talk to these crypto native founders, the actual builders, the people that Vance was talking about, the people who are sort of unique to this, I guess, generation of defi protocol building. And I think one of my takeaways from this conversation with Stani was just how understated that Stani and his team at Ave are. I almost used the word kind of humble about what they built. At one point in our conversation, Stannie says at the beginning of the year.
00:01:35.760 - 00:01:37.546, Speaker C: They would have been happy with 5.
00:01:37.648 - 00:01:44.622, Speaker A: Million locked, total locked value inside of the Ave protocol. And here we are, they have about.
00:01:44.676 - 00:01:49.310, Speaker C: 1.4 billion locked in six months later.
00:01:49.460 - 00:02:16.920, Speaker A: Just the amount of kind of building that's been going on with Ave, his team style of just constant shipping product, never stopping, partnering with other protocols wherever possible, really building for the ecosystem, I found, frankly refreshing. It's not something that you typically see, but I think it is one of the patterns you see in successful DeFi protocols. So if you're looking at the future, trying to front run the next opportunity.
00:02:17.690 - 00:02:19.554, Speaker C: Maybe you'll see some of the patterns.
00:02:19.602 - 00:02:28.886, Speaker A: In the Aave team and what Stani and his team have developed play out in future protocols. Maybe those types of characteristics are the investable pieces.
00:02:28.998 - 00:02:30.390, Speaker C: What did you think, David?
00:02:30.550 - 00:02:48.050, Speaker B: One of the lines that stuck out to me in the Vance episode was when he is interviewing or talking to founders of protocols that are looking to eventually turn over the keys to the kingdom, to the community, he asked them, are you really about that life? I thought that was a funny line.
00:02:48.120 - 00:02:48.450, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:02:48.520 - 00:03:13.546, Speaker B: And Sonny is absolutely about that life. And that life is what he means by this is if you are interested in building a protocol on Ethereum, it's fundamentally different than building out an LLC or a C Corp or going public on the stock market. It's just a different deal. And I think Stannie is particularly well suited as an exemplar person who is about that life.
00:03:13.648 - 00:03:14.010, Speaker C: Right.
00:03:14.080 - 00:04:16.446, Speaker B: Because, you know, Ave has one of the most insane histories of 2017 and 2018, where they initially tried out this thing called Eth Lend. It was. It became clear that it wasn't going to work, so they pivoted a protocol. Like a protocol pivot is an interesting thing in and of itself. And one thing I think why you think that Stani and Ave is understated is because unlike companies like Amazon and Jeff Bezos and Steve Jobs and Apple, I don't think Ave had this grand one 3510 year plan. I think in the middle of the bear market, they just started working on what was obvious and what was obviously wanted and needed by the community, and they just put 1ft forward in front of the other. And then all of a sudden, because of their relationship with their community and the feedback that they got from the community, which is a topic that we talk about in this podcast, they were just able to create what the community wanted.
00:04:16.446 - 00:04:21.230, Speaker B: And as a result of that, there's like $1.5 billion in Aave.
00:04:21.970 - 00:04:35.790, Speaker A: Yeah, it's really an amazing story, and I think it'll come through in the conversation. And really, maybe the last thing I'll say before we jump into it is there tend to be two types of people that come into crypto.
00:04:35.950 - 00:04:38.546, Speaker C: One type is the tourist, and they're.
00:04:38.578 - 00:04:46.466, Speaker A: Here just because they've heard the hype and they want to build something because it's hypey, and they're all about that glitz and the glamour.
00:04:46.578 - 00:04:48.026, Speaker C: And there's the other type that's more.
00:04:48.048 - 00:04:50.346, Speaker A: The crypto native, the builder, the one.
00:04:50.368 - 00:04:53.340, Speaker C: That'S going to keep going in the trenches of.
00:04:55.470 - 00:05:21.426, Speaker A: A soul sucking bear market. And those are the teams and the individuals, the crypto natives, the people who are there in the bear market that I tend to trust more to carry us forward in the future bull market, there is going to be a host of new tourists that come aboard, and you only can tell whether they're crypto natives or not, if they're willing to continue building during the bear market as well.
00:05:21.608 - 00:05:46.726, Speaker B: Yeah, making it through the bear market is just the biggest signal of commitment. Like, no one can ever question whether you're here in it for the long term or not. And Aave, as one of the biggest protocols on Ethereum, I think is pretty clear, is in it until the very end. So big fans of Ave, let's just go ahead and get right into the interview. But before we do that, we're going to take a moment to talk about our sponsors.
00:05:46.918 - 00:06:37.674, Speaker E: One of the tools I've started to use recently is zapper. For those of you that were part of the 2017 bull market, it was characterized by just opening up blockfolio and refreshing it over and over and over again. And also, anytime you ever made a trade, you would have to go into blockfolio and manually input that trade information to make sure that your portfolio, that you think that you have matches what you actually have. With Zapper. You don't have to do any of that anymore because all you have to do with Zapper is input your Ethereum addresses, and then Zapper will give you a really elegant report as to where all your money is. So there will never, ever be any disconnect between the money that you think that you have and the money that Zapper reports to you. Zapper looks directly on chain and gives you a nice portfolio summary of all your assets and how many assets and all of your debt and all of your lending positions, all of your positions all at once.
00:06:37.674 - 00:07:19.362, Speaker E: So there's no more editing your portfolio because Zapper just does it for you. One thing that I thought was really useful about zappers was when I plugged my wallets in, I found that I had submitted liquidity to uniswap forever ago, and without Zapper, I would have probably lost that forever. Because Zapper knows where your money is better than you do. It's also the gateway to investing your money into this ever expanding list of available Defi platforms like curve, Balancer, Uniswap, yearn. In the bankless nation, there is this growing number of money legos, and keeping track of them all is just super overwhelming. Which is why you can just go to Zapper, and Zapper will solve the problem of there just being too many money legos to choose from. So check them out at Zapper fi.
00:07:19.362 - 00:07:24.774, Speaker E: Enter your Ethereum addresses and check out your portfolio and see if there's anything that you missed.
00:07:24.902 - 00:07:55.442, Speaker A: Your Ethereum address is a bankless bank account. But here's the problem. It doesn't have a human readable name. It's represented by this long hexadecimal string that no one can read. Unstoppable domains has the solution to that problem. It provides a domain name for your Ethereum address. So instead of telling someone to send you funds to zero x e three, ba blah blah blah, you can tell them to send funds to yourname crypto a domain name for your Ethereum address@unstoppabledomains.com.
00:07:55.442 - 00:08:30.750, Speaker A: You can search for blockchain domains like this and find tools to easily launch websites on decentralized web technology like ipfs. You can even have unstoppable domains help you manage your crypto or ETH or even zill domain name addresses at their unstoppable domains manager websites have domain names.com. Org your bankless bank account on Ethereum should have a domain name too. So go to unstoppabledomains.com. Register a domain name for your Ethereum address now. Unstoppabledomains.com. All right, let's get to the interview.
00:08:40.790 - 00:09:22.254, Speaker C: Bankless Nation I am super excited to introduce our next guest. This is Stani Kolachov, who is the founder of the Ave protocol, which is, as you know, because you are a bankless listener, a money Lego for lending and borrowing assets in DFI. It has a phenomenal growth story. So right now there are about 1.4 billion in locked assets inside of the Ave protocol. The price of lend, its native token, has also increased about 3300% this year. So that means if you bought $100 worth of lend on January 1, you'd now own $3,300.
00:09:22.254 - 00:09:31.940, Speaker C: An absolutely insane growth chart. Insane year for Ave. Stannie, how's your year been? Are you doing okay? How's the year going so far?
00:09:33.110 - 00:09:50.566, Speaker D: I'm pretty much dying here with all the things that we're building and also all the traction that is coming and in the whole space. And it's hard for me to keep up with everything, what's happening, even inside Ave. It's just been amazing year, so know.
00:09:50.588 - 00:10:12.800, Speaker C: So David and I are both like full time. This is our job to cover all of these things and to try to keep up. And we're having a hard time not just keeping up with just things that are going on in Defi, but keeping up with all of the things that aave has been shipping. Like, are you guys accelerating in your ability to ship things, or is this just the symptom of a bull market?
00:10:13.110 - 00:11:04.080, Speaker D: I think we're more organized in the sense, I think we have more resources than we used to have. And I think we are more somehow smarter in the way we build not just code, but ship products. I think it's a combination of multiple things, but we're super organized. And when we get a good idea, a good feature, we just want to get it kind of like to the public. And we tend to see that many of interesting things hasn't come up into mainnet because I think projects are hesitating too much. But it's all about innovation. The more you get stuff that helps people, removes inefficiencies and brings value.
00:11:04.080 - 00:11:07.218, Speaker D: There's no reason to wait with it.
00:11:07.384 - 00:11:50.430, Speaker C: Well, you guys certainly don't wait. You've been shipping like demons this year. It's been absolutely insane to see. I want know start with this. And we don't usually do this on the podcast, Stannie, because we tend to like to skip over the kind of the intro and get sort of into the meat. But I think part of the meat actually for you is the intro. Like we're doing this series on crypto native founders and Vance Spencer from Framework came on last episode and he talked about this, how it's his goal and framework's goal to find these unique crypto native founders and they're typically not found in the places that traditional Silicon Valley venture capitalists look for them.
00:11:50.430 - 00:12:12.840, Speaker C: And now you guys started Ave in Finland, right? Helsinki, Finland, is that right? So this is a country of 5 million people. For folks who aren't familiar. It's very far north, very likely north of where you're listening to this from. Why Helsinki? How did you guys found a major Defi protocol in?
00:12:16.090 - 00:13:13.834, Speaker D: I mean it's not the place where you would expect big projects come from, but in terms of Finland is a small country, but in some way there is a lot of things that are very good. I mean in terms of education, innovation, we don't just see usually Finland represent that much. I mean we have a very good gaming industry. For example, if everyone remembers, for example, angry birds, clash of clans, these are finnish games actually. And if someone remembers still like Nokia, they made the best phones and they went to the worst phones. There is innovation there. I don't know, I see it kind of like maybe it's because of defi we're able to do this.
00:13:13.834 - 00:13:39.490, Speaker D: Maybe because it's the fact that anyone can build permissionlessly, not just like use permissionlessly, defi primitives and the protocols, but actually you can build. And if you allow that, I think the next biggest thing might come from, I don't know, from some even smaller country. Maybe that's the point of whole decentralized finance.
00:13:39.910 - 00:14:26.242, Speaker C: I totally agree. I think that is the point that anyone can get started from anywhere. It's permissionless. You don't need to ask anyone, you don't need to know someone on Wall street or know someone in Silicon Valley to go build something and to go innovate and to go ship. Know, another fascinating point, I think about you, Stani, is that you've got a master's degree in law, right? So this is also not necessarily the typical, I guess, motif of the tech founder. Can you tell us about law and how that intersects with cryptos? Just tell us the story. How did you get involved in wanting to build something on Ethereum and in DeFi to begin with?
00:14:26.376 - 00:15:21.582, Speaker D: Yeah, before going into law school, actually, I did web development. I did mobile app development before that. And I used to focus quite a lot on financial applications. And I even had a startup where. Well, it wasn't a startup, it was more like a small project where I build an app where all the gamers, for example, or anyone who gets income from App Store or Google Play, there's this waiting period of one month and 15 days or so, and our kind of like product application allowed them to get their income the next day. So we did a bit of financing in that sense. And I loved always development.
00:15:21.582 - 00:15:44.538, Speaker D: I was born always somehow close to software. My brother used to basically tweak Linux kernels. And Linux was a big thing. It was very big thing in Finland because Linux actually is from, the founder is from Finland. The project started from there. So there is another thing that, and it's open source. I think Linux is the biggest open source thing out there.
00:15:44.538 - 00:16:32.170, Speaker D: One of the biggest. And what was interesting is that programming in mathematics, it's very proof like. So let's say one plus one is two. But then again, whenever I encounter regulation or law, which is very common in finance, I noticed one interesting thing is that law is basically opinionated in the sense that there is no right or wrong, but there's actually a consensus of different kinds of opinions and that forms the law. And I wanted to understand more. And I went to study law and that was pretty funny.
00:16:32.670 - 00:16:38.234, Speaker C: So it was intellectual curiosity that drew you to law school. Is that the case?
00:16:38.272 - 00:17:43.454, Speaker D: Yeah. I never intended to work as a lawyer. Somehow, as a professional it could be fun in terms of like you're able to, especially if you're like a commercial lawyer, you could actually see how companies do transactions and help them. Startups, scale ups, and also kind of like a bigger blue chips as well. But somewhere in Middle of the law school, I started to get more involved in Ethereum. I guess I was researching something about automatizing legal agreements and somehow I ended up into a post about smart contracts and started to read more and ended up in Ethereum, Reddit, and started to think like, what is this thing and just researched weeks and weeks and tried to understand and grasp what you could actually do with this technology. And that was like when I understood Smart contracts and the power, especially the power of having immutable code.
00:17:43.454 - 00:18:25.242, Speaker D: And then it kind of suddenly clicked to me, actually we're building something that kind of didn't exist before in this efficient way. And that was mind blowing. The interesting part for me was that when I was designing and building the financial applications like programming itself, it kind of like felt. And mathematics, it feels like it's very rules based. So what it basically means that let's say you have an equation of one plus one, it's two. But in law when it comes to regulation, it's not like that. It's very opinionated.
00:18:25.242 - 00:19:35.178, Speaker D: So if you think about law, it's kind of like different kinds of opinions based on interpretation. And then you kind of have a consensus on what is the right interpretation of, let's say law, or what is right or wrong in that sense. And that part of fascinated me quite a lot because it was very uncommon to me and I wanted to feed this intellectual part. But what's interesting is that I started somehow get more involved in Ethereum because I was researching at some point in my studies about automaticizing agreements or efficient way of making legal agreements. And somehow I ended up reading something about smart contracts. And then one thing led to another. I was in the Ethereum Reddit community and reading all this stuff and people doing transactions and reading kind of different kinds of use cases potential.
00:19:35.178 - 00:20:06.382, Speaker D: And once I realized the potential of smart contracts in terms of immutability, I was pretty much sold because it was mind blowing. Because once you deploy the code in a way that it's immutable, you kind of don't need the trust and you can even get rid of the lawyers in one way and simplify transactions and make it more efficient. And that was something that was very mind blowing to me.
00:20:06.436 - 00:20:35.478, Speaker C: So it sounds like it was almost like this confluence for you of things like so intellectual curiosity. I'm sure you probably saw that in Ethereum and in crypto and this idea of smart contracts as law, as immutable law, and also harkening back to kind of the Linux experience with open source, it's all of those things combined. Is that why you kind of fell in love with defi in the space? And at what point did you decide to actually build something here?
00:20:35.564 - 00:21:48.922, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean the open source part was really fascinating because you have people around the world and contributing. I always understood the open source because I usually tend to use open source software. When I was younger and developed software in college, I didn't want to pay because I didn't afford to pay different kinds of software. So I tended to try to always find open source versions and not much contribute. I wasn't that kind of like talented in the sense or skillful, but definitely I always understood it, what it means. And I think even more in Ethereum it became quite clear because you had a community which is very open source centric, but actually you could build a lot of proprietary technology on top of on chain ecosystems and in Defi as well, but many tend not to because you kind of lose the edge of having a community and the contribution of community. And when I saw that happen in the term space, that was pretty fascinating.
00:21:48.922 - 00:22:26.186, Speaker D: There was one incident that kind of was weird to me because I came a bit before the Dow hack, things were very unclear to me. I haven't grasped everything, what's going on in theory, and the Dow hack happened. A lot of people kind of turned their backs and thought that the experiment was a bit of failure to some extent. But for me it wasn't ever like an issue. I mean, I wanted to still build something, and somehow I realized that I want to build something related to finance. And then I kind of started to think what that could be.
00:22:26.288 - 00:22:54.910, Speaker B: Okay, Stani, so you discovered Ethereum. You're intellectually curious, you like smart contracts, but why did that end up you creating Ethland? And as a piece of trivia for those that aren't familiar, before there was Aave, there was Ethland. And so Ethland is actually the precursor to, you know, Stanny and the Ethland team started before Ave ever was a thing. So Stani, how come Ethland, as a protocol or as a project, how come that interested you?
00:22:55.080 - 00:23:47.346, Speaker D: Yeah, I guess I wanted to do some sort of a proof of concept of a loan transaction where we connect a lender and a borrower and they can basically do a loan transaction in a distrust environment. Especially like addresses are basically pseudo anonymous and still in a way that the borrower has an incentive to repay the loan. So what we came up is, interestingly, this was the period when we saw the first kind of like decentralized exchange coming in. Ethereum in 2016 was the ether delta. And there was absolutely no traction. Nobody cared about it, nobody understood how to use it, and it was difficult to use it. And it was an order book exchange.
00:23:47.346 - 00:24:44.040, Speaker D: So it took a bit while when these tokens, Erc, 20 tokens that are in theorem got a bit of more volume and traction, and people started to actually trade them, and we saw actually liquidity. So in that part, I was thinking like, okay, so we have here tokens that could actually be assets, representations of anything. Why not use these assets as a collateral until, and make a loan transaction and release the collateral when the borrower repays it? And that was the very first concept of over collateralized loans. And we named the project Ethlend, short for Ethereum lending. And it wasn't like the. I mean, the designs were very crappy those days. When you build decentralized applications, you didn't give much about user experience.
00:24:44.040 - 00:25:25.266, Speaker D: The front end, it was just all about deploying smart contracts and having some sort of way to interact. And that's fine if you can connect to a DAP and then just initiate the transaction. Rest was kind of like obsolete at that point, and I'm glad that we got rid of that. And now we are in a state that we have beautiful user interfaces and actually user experience. But that moment was there when we actually started, and that was fascinating enough. Ethland model, the overcollateral loans is basically where half of the DeFi is based on you borrow against a collateral. We didn't understood back then.
00:25:25.266 - 00:25:35.030, Speaker D: I didn't understood back then how big the space could become. I thought it was a very nice proof of concept, and probably I will forget about the project, but that didn't happen.
00:25:35.180 - 00:25:51.446, Speaker C: Yeah, people talk about the user experience of Ethereum and crypto being difficult today. And I think those people never actually tried to use Ether delta back in 2016. David, did you ever trade on ether delta?
00:25:51.558 - 00:25:57.518, Speaker B: I'm pretty sure I still have funds inside of ether delta. I didn't bother to go get them because it was such a pain.
00:25:57.604 - 00:26:40.878, Speaker C: It was just so janky. But it was at one time the only place where you could get particular tokens. But, man, it felt like something out of, like, the early 90s. It was just terrible to use. But, okay, before we get to ave now and kind of finish the story on ETH lend, I want to talk about this, because ETH Lend was similar to the initial version of dharma, right? Another protocol that was doing peer to peer lending, in that it was peer to peer. Right. So it was one individual with an ETH address matched to one other individual with an ETH address.
00:26:40.878 - 00:27:15.826, Speaker C: And I don't know how you think about it, Stannie, but it feels like peer to peer defi contracts haven't taken off in the way that peer to contract DeFi protocols have. In that like a peer to contract is sort of like there's this aggregate pool, and you sort know match liquidity, and you pool liquidity inside of the contract rather than always having to match peers. Was that an insight that you developed, or what are the kind of insights that you developed when building ethlend that led you into what aave eventually became?
00:27:15.938 - 00:27:55.458, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I definitely agree that the peer to contract model is more efficient in that sense. What's interesting back then is that when we started, there wasn't an ecosystem like this. We have mean ether delta, where I remember first time I wanted to actually sell tokens or buy tokens, I waited a week that someone bought the tokens and there were quite liquid ones. It was first blood tokens. It's just fascinating how low liquidity there was.
00:27:55.624 - 00:28:04.822, Speaker C: You opened a trade, so this is like what people don't remember about ether delta. So you would open a trade and there would be no buyers in the other side, so you'd have to wait.
00:28:04.876 - 00:28:06.440, Speaker D: Like a week for one.
00:28:07.210 - 00:28:07.718, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:28:07.804 - 00:28:09.354, Speaker C: To get that trade filled, right?
00:28:09.392 - 00:28:55.750, Speaker D: Yeah, that's how crazy it was. And then you have the gas cost, and then you wonder why I'm paying gas. Well, you wonder these days even more. But it's kind of like interesting aspect. The liquidity was very low, and we wanted to make this transaction to happen and this proof of concept. And we were thinking like, what happens if actually someone needs to liquidate the loan and resell the collateral, and how we make it work in a way that we don't kind of risk other users. So when the liquidity is very low, it's way better not to pull the risk together into a systematic form.
00:28:55.750 - 00:30:06.080, Speaker D: And that is very typical in low liquidity instruments. So what we wanted to do is kind of like separate the agreements, and we even technically did it quite separately. For each loan that was created, we deployed a separate smart contract, which was very stupid to do, because every time you deploy a smart contract, you pay a lot of gas. But then the gas price was quite low, and we found out like six months later that the gas prices went ten x, and then we were in the place that we had to refigure everything out again, so we had to separate the risk. So that was like one of the things we didn't want to make a situation where someone can come and somehow use this systemic risk in their advantage when the collateral values are low liquid in markets. So we made the peer to peer model, where everyone who is funding a loan can actually decide upon their risk level at that time. It made a lot of sense.
00:30:06.080 - 00:31:01.134, Speaker D: What was interesting in this fashion is that it was the very first primitive of onchain lending. And kind of like, we wanted to look something that already exists in the traditional finance, which is peer to peer loans, even though they are these days, also kind of like liquidity providers are already aggregated in one way. And we started the model this way. And at some point, the DeFi started to accelerate in the sense that some of these tokens started to actually have some value. Like now we have actually shitcoins that are traded and not just shitcoins that aren't traded anywhere. And that changed quite a lot. So you could pull risk, and we started people to do this, and that started to actually inspire us that, okay, if they can do it, we can do it and we can improve something.
00:31:01.134 - 00:31:04.740, Speaker D: And I think that was the moment that took us forward.
00:31:05.190 - 00:31:47.630, Speaker C: So before we get to the happy 2020, want to talk a little bit about the bear market, the grueling bear market. Right? So back to tokens. You guys launched the lend token in happy days, right? December 2017, when everything was booming, even cryptokitties were selling for like, thousands of dollars. You launched it, then it shot up. So from whatever the launch price was to about $0.39 in January 2018, everything was going crazy. There was not a lot of rationality to it, not a lot of cash flows or token economics that were thought through.
00:31:47.630 - 00:32:35.322, Speaker C: People were just buying everything. But then we had the 2018 bear market start shortly after. And it seems like shortly after you guys launched, ethereum lost 95% of its value. But tokens like lend lost even more than that. It lost 99% of its value by 2019. So the pit of the bear market, I think, again, memories are short lived, but people don't remember how despondent DFI teams were feeling, like ethereum was dead. Bitcoin is the only app for crypto.
00:32:35.322 - 00:32:38.058, Speaker C: All of these things. How are you feeling?
00:32:38.154 - 00:32:59.320, Speaker B: And to add a little bit more color to that, there are plenty of 2017 tokens that did exactly what the lend token did at the start of 2017 and then mooned, and then in 2018 went to lost 99%. Right. And there are plenty of tokens that are still at 99% losses, whereas lens has not.
00:33:01.690 - 00:33:11.580, Speaker D: And there's also tokens that they used to do something completely else and lose 99% of value. And now they're doing DFI. Yeah, exactly.
00:33:12.750 - 00:33:44.098, Speaker C: Well, okay. But in the bear market, with your token 99% down, everyone's saying, like, dfI is dead, ethereum is dead. How are you feeling? It seemed like you guys kept building, but did you ever think it's over? Ben Horowitz has a book which I love, called the hard things about hard things. And he talks about every protocol. Every startup has its wifio moment. That's WFIO where it's like we're f'd, it's over, right?
00:33:44.184 - 00:33:44.434, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:33:44.472 - 00:33:50.246, Speaker C: And they have to go through that to come out on the other side. Did you have that moment? Did you think it was not going to work out?
00:33:50.428 - 00:34:36.120, Speaker D: Actually, never, because we did raise substantial funds. But kind of in terms of building the ideas that we always think about at Ave and back in Italy, we were always thinking, when can we ship this new thing? When we could move to the next thing? And we had so many ideas that we wanted to actually get into the main net. I still have, I still have lot of kind of like proof of concepts that we basically were brainstorming two or three years ago and that are very viable products today, if we will ship them. And it's just kind of like.
00:34:38.170 - 00:34:38.486, Speaker C: We.
00:34:38.508 - 00:35:22.660, Speaker D: Have always been a bit unresourced because we are small teams, so we have to focus in the very core. But I can say that during that kind of crypto winter period, it wasn't easy. I mean, it wasn't like people are losing faith and just because of the valuations and the market is going down and not giving much about what people are building. That was sad. At least it was sad to me, because we were shipping more stuff all the time. We're getting more knowledge and we're building more things more than ever. And basically people weren't that excited about it.
00:35:22.660 - 00:36:04.210, Speaker D: And I think the good part is that we definitely had very diverse community and we had a lot of users. Even today, many Ava users are actually from the italian era. And for them it's fascinating because they have seen our very first products, which look completely like crap. And where we are today, for them, this is a journey and they have been part of it. And that's fascinating. And there's still a lot of people who come all the time that they are saying that's been following all the time and haven't been active. But it's just amazing how you guys are proceeding.
00:36:04.210 - 00:36:39.754, Speaker D: I think for us, the thesis always been the innovation. We didn't care about the markets. And to be honest, when I came to Ethereum, I never came to invest. I bought Ethereum for gas, and that's all about it. I needed gas for deploying contracts and to pay transactions, and that is why I needed Ethereum. I never needed for as an investment, I like to build financial products, but I don't want to kind of focus too much on investing. I love to build things.
00:36:39.754 - 00:36:41.354, Speaker D: I'm a builder, I think.
00:36:41.472 - 00:37:20.218, Speaker B: So let's talk a little bit more about the Ave community. During the bear market, you said that there were people that stuck around and people that paid attention, but that couldn't have been the same throughout 2017 and then into 2018 and 19. So how did the Ave community kind of fill their niche around Ave? Because from what I understand now, the Ave community is one of them. Probably the gold standard in crypto, right? In terms of having a strong relationship with the team, and the team using the Ave community to iterate on their products. Tell us about the transition from 2017 to 2018 19 with the Ave community.
00:37:20.384 - 00:38:23.198, Speaker D: I think what was important that when we were building eat land, we basically finished all the features that we wanted to deliver to the community and then we started to build the next thing. But for us, what was important that actually our community is more about what could be built next. Compared to that, too much sticking on something very puristic. And I really love that because it gives space to ship. And it's interesting now we're shifting towards decentralized governance where the token holders make all the decisions. And I'm really curious to see how it will play out in the future, because Ava as a team will build things. I hate the idea when you build the protocol, you build the product and give it to the community, and then you basically say, okay, I'm out of here.
00:38:23.198 - 00:39:18.990, Speaker D: And I just don't believe in that. I believe that you are still like a stakeholder in what you're building. And if you look at for example Linux torwalds as a kind of member of the Linux community, he's still very active. And same for for example Vitalik in Ethereum. And these are kind of like a people where actually I like the idea of kind of being present in the ecosystem. And I think it will be interesting to see because there will be other teams also building on top of Aave and also making pull requests into the core of the protocol and curious to see what direction it will take. And the good thing about we're always listening to community in that sense, there usually haven't been difficult times.
00:39:18.990 - 00:39:55.546, Speaker D: I guess more when there's difficult times, we have got a lot of respect in the sense that we build things and we don't disappear. If we fail with one thing or something doesn't work, we just try to find a solution. And I think people just trust us in that sense, that they want to give us support and push us forward. And I think, end of the day, your product is as strong as your community, including users within the community. That's vital part of Ave. Did the.
00:39:55.568 - 00:40:16.370, Speaker B: Community ever take a more active role in product development? How did the communication between team and community go while you guys were making this pivot from east lend to Ave? What impact did the community have in actually making design decisions or meaningful and impactful choices? Did any of that happen?
00:40:16.520 - 00:41:43.930, Speaker D: Yeah, I remember kind of like, we showed some designs when they were crappy. We got a lot of negative feedback and we realized, okay, now we really need to make some better ux. And we understood the importance of it because many of the community members, they're not always this kind of like a super defi, super user type. We do have them in our community, but we also have community members who are just, they might deposit once and forget for a long time, or they might just basically, they support defi, but for some reason they don't want to use it at the moment and just want to follow the action that is happening and might be like a token holder, but holding still in centralized exchange. So the feedback has been very, I mean, community is somehow you have this feedback loop and go back and forth and having this for many years is amazing. The feeling is just super nice because, you know, there are certain people there, like if you publish some designs or product updates, there are people who have followed you and are actively participating, and that feeling is amazing. So you kind of trust that you have audience.
00:41:43.930 - 00:42:12.854, Speaker D: We try to not take it as a granted and appreciate where we are. And I think we wouldn't be here without the whole token sale and this kind of like a path to roller coaster. Coaster from bull market to bear and back here. I think this has kind of bring more strength in our community.
00:42:13.052 - 00:42:20.810, Speaker E: Hey, guys, we're going to pause the interview with Stani so we can talk about some of the bankless sponsors that make the bankless nation possible.
00:42:20.960 - 00:42:50.482, Speaker A: Bankless nation. Do you want to go fully bankless? But in the real world, monolith is the Defi account that you need. It wraps your ETh address in a bankless visa card and it does so much more. It closes the loop from fiat to DeFi. So you can onboard fiat to Dai on monolith with zero fees. Then you can convert that dai to Adai, which is an interest bearing savings account. Again, zero fees, and then you can spend that interest in the real world on a Visa card.
00:42:50.482 - 00:43:13.754, Speaker A: So you can finally buy your cup of coffee with interest earned in defi. Guys, this is magic. This is the closest thing to the holy Grail crypto card, and monolith gives you all of it. You need to download the app at monolith XYz to get your bankless Visa card. It's optimized for european listeners. They'll be coming to the US soon. And when you get that Visa card, the monolith card, tweet about it when you do.
00:43:13.754 - 00:43:24.986, Speaker A: I love seeing people unpackaging their beautiful bankless Visa cards. It makes me realize that the revolution is here. Search monolith in the App Store Ampleforth.
00:43:25.018 - 00:44:14.638, Speaker E: Is a new base money experiment on Ethereum. Many people have heard of this new rebasing mechanism, and Amplforth was the protocol to first introduce that into the Ethereum space. Ampliforth is very comparable to bitcoin in the sense that it has a non dilutive supply. However, there's one thing about it that's inverse with bitcoin. Whereas bitcoin has a completely inflexible supply, meaning any demand for BTC. The asset is therefore reflected in the price, and Ampleforth is the inverse of that, where Ampleforth is pegged to $2,019, and any demand for the ampleforth token is reflected in the supply of the asset, not the price of the asset. So the Ampleforth token tracks $2,019 slowly over time, so it should never be too far away from $2,019.
00:44:14.638 - 00:44:56.742, Speaker E: And in order to achieve that goal, it adds or burns ampleforth token supply so that the market generally prices it around the value of a $2019. It is definitely not a stablecoin because the volatility of the value that you hold will fluctuate up and down wildly. But the token itself is supposed to track a dollar. Pretty interesting experiment. There's been a lot of spinoffs using this rebasing mechanism. They also have this liquidity mining program where you can supply Ampleforth and ether tokens to the Uniswap pool, and you'll be able to get an extra dividend of Ampleforth tokens from the Ampleforth Geyser. So check them out@ampleforth.org
00:44:56.742 - 00:44:59.562, Speaker E: and see if this is an experiment you want to partake in.
00:44:59.696 - 00:45:01.146, Speaker B: All right, guys, let's get right back.
00:45:01.168 - 00:45:02.906, Speaker E: To the interview with Donnie.
00:45:03.098 - 00:45:09.050, Speaker B: So you mentioned the token sale. Did you guys have funding before that token sale from, like, venture capital?
00:45:09.210 - 00:46:11.010, Speaker D: No. I mean, it's quite difficult in the sense that we were building technology back in days that was very novel. In the sense that the ecosystem didn't exist. And also, me coming from Finland, small country, which is not a VC playground, being that age, still mean I could not see a VC fund placing a bet on what we were doing back then. You will need something more kind of like a democratic way to raise funds. And as we did the token sale, I afterwards realized by analyzing that, actually, if this way of funding will not exist, we will not be here. No way in that stage early, any vcs will invested us in those kind of circumstances.
00:46:11.010 - 00:46:41.386, Speaker D: We knew that we could build things, but betting on this kind of technology and ecosystem today, it's easy. I mean, it's very easy to go and find a project which does some solid stuff and just invest, because there is an ecosystem, there's market and cross interactions, but back then, there's ether Delta, which wasn't even liquid. Not an easy scenario in that sense.
00:46:41.568 - 00:47:34.906, Speaker B: The lend token sale happened in November of 2017. And from what I just looked up just now, you guys raised a little bit shy of $18 million, which, I mean, as far as market caps and valuations go, that is insanely low for what we know of today. And so you're telling me that the $18 million that you guys raised in November of 2017, plus I'm sure there were some ave tokens held by the team. All of that raise was done in an ICO, and all of the funding that you guys took was done from the ICO to people that were involved in the community at that time. And to me, I want to highlight something here, because the ICO is kind of synonymous with the f word. It's like a bad word. Now, we always look back on the ICO mania as, like this time where a lot of retail got scammed, people got burned.
00:47:34.906 - 00:48:21.598, Speaker B: But I think we forget that the bad side of the ICo mania came out of a very good side of the ICO mania. The most good, for example, I would say, was like Ethereum, like the most fair ICO of all time. And then Auger came not too long afterward. And Ave, I think people should remember that Ave is a leading example of an ICO that was fundamentally good, that did its job in both giving funds to the team, because they need that funds to build out the protocol, but also using the token as a community shelling point, a community coordination tool. And so I just think, as the ICO model was done with a complete success with the Ave team.
00:48:21.764 - 00:48:59.610, Speaker D: Yeah. And I think what's funny is that I see kind of like betting on the Ave team, it feels like betting or reliability. So we kind of went the ups and downs, and we're still here. It's more certain in that way. But, yeah, I totally agree. I mean, lots of things happened, and I'm pretty sure that once this whole yield farming craze will end, we will see, like, a lot of disappointments. But also, if you look at the venture capital ward, and investments in general, let's say you make ten bets and nine will fail and one will be the jackpot.
00:48:59.610 - 00:50:03.758, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, there's even more kind of, like, similar scenarios and investments in general. But I really like the idea. I still don't understand why people aren't doing this so called daikos, which is a combination of a dao and ICO token sale, which is something that Vitalik himself kind of suggested that that could be a model to try in the sense that you actually have a fair launch model where you basically sell the governance power to the token holders, and those funds are going into the dow and they get instant governance in that sense. And there's, like, incentives are so aligned, and we're now having this kind of like a fair and launch model that we call where you give everything to the community with this farming. But I think it's very unfair, and I can later tell why.
00:50:03.924 - 00:50:50.618, Speaker B: So, Stanny, to wrap up this portion of the conversation, when we had Vance on the podcast from framework, he talked about how teams that were handing over the governance of the protocol off to the community were looking inherently looking for valuations that were far beyond, like, the traditional C Corp valuations or the companies that you find on the stock market. Right. And because inherently, these things are protocols. They aren't companies and protocols just are bigger. Right. And so when you guys were in 2017, 2018, building out Ave, were you guys thinking along those lines, or were you just kind of heads down building, or what was the end goal for Ave back in 2018 and 2019?
00:50:50.714 - 00:52:11.810, Speaker D: Yeah, I think mostly we were heads down building, but we kind of tried to a bit of think of where the space is going, and sometimes there were difficult times in the sense that we didn't see things moving in the space. Kind of like we had long narrative. There was a long time a narrative where there's only a few Defi users, and we build a lot of stuff because we were embracing how much there's developers building in Defi and so many cool things and just a couple of users and this kind of like a meme. And now it's insane. I mean, this kind of like a narrative was back in year and a half ago and now we're in completely different situation. And it's interesting. So one of the times on those 20, 18, 19, we had this kind of periods that we are not getting more users and why isn't this working as an ecosystem? And we weren't disappointed, but we were thinking in a funny way that what we didn't build or what's left to build, that we can actually get more people involved.
00:52:11.810 - 00:52:45.700, Speaker D: And funny, what's really funny is that it's actually the incentives that drew everyone. And the very first incentives were basically having stable coins and earning interest on them. And that got a lot of attention. I mean, you saw interest rates from 5% to 7% annually. And then you compare it to the traditional finance where it's close to zero. It makes you wonder, like, wow, this new world, there could be some potential here.
00:52:46.390 - 00:53:27.038, Speaker C: I personally absolutely love the fact that the Silicon Valley vcs of the world and the Wall street finance people totally missed Aave. I just love it because it's just know, that's the story of Defi. That's kind of the bankless story. It's kind of the underdog, right? Anyone has access to these tools from anywhere in the world. They don't have to be part of these established networks in order to succeed here. What they have to do is build something that people want. But it still is, I think, an incredible story.
00:53:27.038 - 00:53:59.340, Speaker C: So not that long ago, we're talking six, seven months ago, Stani Ave had less than a couple hundred thousand dollars locked inside of it. So it was tiny. Now fast forward to now. We've got over a billion, we've got something like 1.41.6 billion locked in this protocol over the past seven months. That kind of growth is absolutely insane, even by Silicon Valley standards. They don't see this sort of thing.
00:53:59.340 - 00:54:29.060, Speaker C: Can we talk for a bit about why you think that growth has come? So you mentioned incentives. Is that the reason? Is it also that you guys have just been building so much and you're just building faster and innovating faster than everyone else? I guess my question is, in the two years of the bear market, what the heck did you guys build to account for this seeming overnight success that we've seen in 2020?
00:54:29.430 - 00:55:38.282, Speaker D: Yeah, we definitely didn't expect this kind of growth. Our idea was very, we always had ambitious goal to achieve, but I wasn't expecting even the Defi space to grow so much. Honestly, we would be happy if we had like 5 million locked value and that would have been super awesome. And then we will be thinking, okay, what will be the next features we will build? But I kind of felt somehow that we put a lot of effort in the actual protocol launch. I mean, we built it for quite a long time. I think it took us almost a year to deploy and we put a lot of effort in what we were building and trying to perfectionize it. And having all these features like the a tokens that accumulate in user balances and having native flash loans and all of the stuff that we were implementing, it kind of paid off.
00:55:38.282 - 00:56:53.310, Speaker D: And I guess one of the bigger things is that it's quite developer friendly protocol, and it's very easy to build on top. And we noticed that most of the liquidity comes from actually, and transactions comes from different kinds of products that have been built on top. For example, when we launched in January, we got quite a lot of deposits and borrowings, but no one actually was using flash loans. That was actually interesting part of this kind of underdog story, because our flash loan has this kind of like a reward fee to the depositors. So whenever there's a flash loan on particular block, it means that it gives this kind of like a spike in their yields, depositors yields. So let's say if there's a dai flash loan, typically now, today there can be even like a 14 million worth of die borrowed in a flash loan that gives a small spike in depositors yields. And that's pretty cool because it's arbitrary.
00:56:53.310 - 00:57:55.650, Speaker D: What we noticed that kind of like the Silicon Valley, this perception was that actually you don't need to charge in the beginning, you don't need fees, and you're looking for market share. And for us it was like a bit of bullshit in the sense that if you're building products, you can have fees because you're building value in that sense. And when you're building value you can definitely charge. And how we are doing in the protocol in the future is actually that the fees goes to the stakers and eventually to the token holders and whatnot. But I think people were too shy on breaking things in a good way. There's so many patterns, not just in Defi, but in product development. And those people who are actually going in and breaking those barriers, they're succeeding.
00:57:55.650 - 00:58:46.494, Speaker D: That is the innovation and how we get further. And we promoted the flash loans and talked to different developers and showed them what kind of cool things you could do. I did a blog post on eight different use cases of flash loans. And then some of the actually developers listened to me and kind of like they started to implement and I didn't even know about that. And then what happened? The black Thursday came, and you suddenly see this kind of a needle in the graph. If you go to ave watch, you have this graph of the usage. And we had this kind of huge needle that went up and that was basically flash loans.
00:58:46.494 - 00:59:29.380, Speaker D: And we were like, wow, where is it coming from? And there was a project called DeFi server that allows you to liquidate your cdp before it goes to the liquidators, and you lose the incentive to mean these kind of things. And once people saw what kind of things you could do with flash loans, it took forward. Of course, there was a couple of flash loan related hacks that gave a lot of publicity to the actual function, but I don't know, being close to developers and being part of that with them, when you brainstorm, adds a lot of value added and helps others to actually use your product as well.
00:59:30.310 - 01:00:23.538, Speaker C: And for those that aren't aware, this flash loan mechanism that you're describing was pretty. Guys, I don't know if you came up with the idea of flash loans, but you certainly popularized it. And it's this idea. And jump in here, Stani, if I don't recap it quite correctly, but it's this idea of in a single block. So in just one short Ethereum block space of time, you can in an instant borrow some funds, use those funds to accomplish some purpose in kind of the defi landscape, and then give the funds back, and you're charged a rate for that. But it's the kind of thing that doesn't really exist in traditional finance. Is that how you describe what a flash loan is? And who came up with this idea? Where'd you guys figure this out?
01:00:23.624 - 01:01:27.878, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it's kind of exactly, I mean, it's something that isn't in traditional finance in the same form. And flash loan itself, it always existed in Ethereum because of the atomicity, how the Ethereum settles transactions. But I've seen a lot of flash flow implementations before us, I think even like multiple, but I never saw actual mainnet implementation, utilization kind of like before us. So I think what happened is that we just made it fashion and somehow popularized it. But definitely I've seen before implementations, and I go a lot of code. I used to go a lot of code more than I do today, but I used to go like repositories and search from different kinds of what kind of projects people are building. And I definitely saw a couple of implementations, but didn't mind that much.
01:01:27.878 - 01:02:14.950, Speaker D: I think one of our developers, Emilio basically started to, I mean, he was very into this atomicity and kind of came up with his own sort of implementation that we eventually used and still use. And we are coming with version two where we have again, completely a bit different kinds of different, kind of a flash loan implementation. It's one of those things that kind of like this Defi thing. DFI existed for a few years, nobody cared, and now everyone is caring because of the incentives. It's fascinating how the network effects work. They come, and when they come, they come altogether.
01:02:15.610 - 01:02:55.970, Speaker C: Yeah. I guess another way that Ave was an underdog is it actually feels, in a way, almost like a second mover advantage type of product. Right. So Google certainly wasn't the first search engine. Ave wasn't the first lending and borrowing protocol to do something in a kind of a peer to contract type way. Compound seemed to be first compound, a silicon Valley company coming out of that a 16 z coming out of that whole zone. It seemed like at the beginning of the year that kind of compound had this space covered completely.
01:02:55.970 - 01:03:05.560, Speaker C: But here you guys are, and you've now surpassed compound in terms of total locked value. Is there something to that second mover advantage that you think accounts for your success?
01:03:05.930 - 01:04:13.550, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, it's always difficult to be the kind of like a top dog. I mean, we were in DeFi polls for a week and something as the most value locked, even the metric is a bit not suitable for covering all the different kinds of financial protocols. But we felt bad in the sense that it's not cool to be there, it's way cooler to be below and kind of compete with the innovation and not worrying about what's your kind of rank in that sense. And I think for us, our goal was always to build a product that everyone uses and everyone that we have certain user base, and we are happy what we're doing. We are always competitive. We love what others are doing in the space and really admire everyone's work. I mean, the stuff people are building these days is amazing and technical, even technical implementations.
01:04:13.550 - 01:05:33.654, Speaker D: There is good amount of talent now, and I hope we get even more. So I guess being an underdog is way better, at least for us, because we don't need to worry that much of a pressure. But of course you get a bit of pressure when you're getting closer to someone that is above you. But I don't know, it's fun competition and we work quite closely with everyone and we try to be very approachable and kind of be as collaborative as possible. I still think that the DeFi ecosystem is like everyone works together in some way, but we have difficulties to reach upon coming up with standards, best practices and actually embracing them. Even though we have been already a while and I don't know, it might be because everyone is building heads down or just kind of like we're still looking too much on tvls and kind of like competing a bit. But I think that we will move forward from this space and interesting times will come.
01:05:33.772 - 01:06:34.780, Speaker B: So Stanny, what about the culture differences between a team like Ave and a team like compound? Where like Ryan alluded to, compound is this Silicon Valley esque, a 16 Z backed startup that is a startup from a founder that has plenty of startup experience. And where Ave, it's like this team out of Helsinki, very grassroots organization, very grassroots leadership. Grassroots community funded by an ICO. And that that ICO seeded that community in a way that compound never really. Compound earned their community to give credit to where credit is due. But the genesis of compound came as a venture capital type of investment, right? And Aave is just a little bit of the opposite. And compound seems to kind of go along with this very slow, very meticulous, never ever risk anything type of type of attitude where Ave is much more move fast and experiment quickly.
01:06:34.780 - 01:06:47.630, Speaker B: Definitely not alluding to move fast and break things. If any of the listeners just had that pop into their head. How do you credit the culture differences between these two organizations to the differences in the resulting.
01:06:49.330 - 01:07:52.802, Speaker D: Mean, like of, I'm from Finland myself, but actually when we look at the team, it's quite global and in the sense our headquarters is now in London, we have an office in Switzerland, we have so many nationalities. I think there's like 23 employees in Aven and most of them are developers. That's why we ship quickly. But what's interesting is that I think everyone has somewhat like a Persona or social media presence and participates in different kinds of communities. And I think that's very important for us. I can't speak much about how compound is doing things. Of course they have their own way of doing stuff, but we really want to be very open and innovative how we do things.
01:07:52.802 - 01:09:11.726, Speaker D: And definitely if we see an opportunity, we want to take it and we want to take it as fast as we can and kind of experiment how things go. And even in terms of building, it's very challenging to build protocols that are holding a lot of funds because it requires so much procedures and effort in terms of security and the way you develop the architecture and all the afterworks that you need to do so in that sense. It's not easy, but I guess it's also about how you build and structure and architecture your offerings because you could always build products on top. And I think that we have done pretty well. But I think important stuff for us is that we don't want to be associated into one particular place. I don't think we want to be european or we want to be seen more preferred in us. We want to be this kind of like a global thing in a way that we have brand exposure in us, Europe and Asia, and we try to get as wide demographic as possible.
01:09:11.726 - 01:10:11.614, Speaker D: And that is the key. When you build something that is very decentralized and autonomous protocols, because you succeed if actually that protocol is used globally in different parts of the world. And not just used, but you have contributions that people are contributing and building and helping out in the community. So when we achieve that thing, that's pretty important. And personally, I think vcs coming into the space was like a couple of years ago and it was like this institution are coming moment for DeFi when we saw vcs taking investments. I think in one way that was really good because a lot of good projects were built. Now it's difficult to say when we are in this a fair launch model, give it straight to the community and how this VC part will play.
01:10:11.614 - 01:10:33.990, Speaker D: But I see benefits in both of them. And I think the community members at least have decisions to make what kind of community they want to belong. But definitely our goal is to be as open community as possible. I think maybe that's the difference. We want to be global.
01:10:34.410 - 01:11:25.830, Speaker B: So I want to just harp on this a little bit more. So Ave has had their token out since 2017, right? Since the ICO, since November. And the ave number of addresses that hold the Ave token is over 100,000, whereas comp and their brand new token has only been out for a few months. And it did this fantastic job with kicking off this whole concept of yield farming and liquidity mining as a fair distribution mechanism, but as a coordination tool, comp is just behind. They are very recent, they're very new. And whereas Ave's token as a coordination mechanism, both as a coordination mechanism between the community and the team, has been going on for years now. Do you attribute any success to Ave's protocol, as to the establishment of the token? Much earlier than I think.
01:11:25.980 - 01:12:19.698, Speaker D: Honestly, mostly I think it just takes time to actually build this reliability of success. And I think it boils down to the discussion that we saw the ups, we saw the down and we're still here. We're building, we're shipping. So I think our community in general, people understand somehow that we're serious on what we are doing and we keep building. This isn't like a trial or this isn't something that we are trying to figure out whether this works or not. If we don't succeed in the first time, we will pivot and do something differently. If it doesn't succeed again, we will just redo.
01:12:19.698 - 01:13:40.878, Speaker D: I mean, we are not leaving anywhere on the opposite side. We want to expand and we want to grow the product offerings and improve our protocol and kind of get community involved as much as possible. And I definitely agree that it takes time to build things. I don't have anything bad to say about compound because I really respect what they're doing and I like to have them as a competitor or kind of like one market participant in the space because they're doing good job. So it keeps me even more active to do even better job and at least try to do better job in that sense. But in terms of fair distribution models, I don't know, if you look at the yield farming, I don't see them that fair because this isn't ready to compound itself. But actually like what we see today, for example, where we have this liquidity mining purely in the sense that you print this token to the governance, to the liquidity providers who are basically putting liquidity into whatever you're doing and farming the token.
01:13:40.878 - 01:14:28.580, Speaker D: And what happens is that it's kind of like a free money in that sense. So liquidity providers come and the more you have money, the more you're farming, right? So you're getting more tokens. And then if you have a smaller amount of funds and you want the token, you actually, by farming it the same way, you are not getting as much as governance power. So you are kind of like forced to buy the token. So you see other people are printing with large amount of money and selling it to the smaller audience. And I see it actually the opposite as unfair distribution model. And I think it will not end well.
01:14:28.580 - 01:14:50.860, Speaker D: I've seen very good models of this liquidity mining or inflation, incentives, rewards, whatever you name it. For example, synthetics, which was one of the earliest models and their system seems to work quite well. But the stuff I see today is a bit kind of crazy.
01:14:51.310 - 01:16:00.190, Speaker C: Yeah, things are certainly getting a little crazy, that's for sure. One of the things I think is super underrated is actually going through a bear market. That's part of what distributes your token to the community and particularly to the holders the true believers of that community, bitcoiners have been saying this for a long time, actually, and I think they're right. Bitcoin is probably the most widely distributed, probably ether. After that, both going through bear markets, going through a bear market can be the best thing you can actually do, counterintuitively, to build better distribution of your token and to build your community. I want to talk about one last area of think success, or something that's unique about Ave before we talk about roadmap and avonomics and everything cool you guys have in the pipeline, and that's this. It feels like you have an uncanny ability, your team, the Ave protocol of building up these unique partnerships, like these protocol partnerships, like bringing other Defi tools and Defi protocols together to build something cool.
01:16:00.190 - 01:16:49.070, Speaker C: So partnership with Openlaw to create this unsecured lending, almost like a credit primitive partnership with realty. You've got real world assets coming into AAve. Even maybe I want to talk about this the most, because Andre is somewhat from the Wi Fi project, who we had on the podcast a few episodes ago, Wire, and that is he is becoming kind of a defi celebrity, if you will. And I feel know is the case that you guys were working with or you were working with Andre many months ago on some of these projects, like you saw the potential of the sorts of yield farming that he was doing and building. And it feels like there's a partnership there as well. Can you talk about some of those partnerships and maybe focus on your partnership with some of these developers like Andre?
01:16:49.410 - 01:18:00.994, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, in terms of different projects. And I think one of the interesting success usually is that we try to find a simple way to make things happen. When we discuss with different projects and we're trying to find something that we could do in common to solve some efficiencies or provide value added, they tend to become complex. That was my previous experience. But now I see that we are very good at finding something very easy, simple way of executing. And that is what has happened with the different projects. And we're doing really cool stuff with realty and open law and just like showing the potential, the credit delegation, I mean, many missed kind of actually the bigger value proposition, definitely the open law and kind of like delegating your credit to someone you trust or someone you make a legal agreement that just shows how you can unlock liquidity from Defi.
01:18:00.994 - 01:18:56.920, Speaker D: But actually, what's the cool part is that for me, who kind of is very crypto native and smart contract native, is that you could delegate your credit into a smart contract. And if you know the predefined functions that what that smart contract can and can't do, you can assess the credit risk and say, okay, there is not much risk here because it just can borrow the funds, deposit them into somewhere else and farm some token and sell it. And then after a period of time return the funds. And if it's not returned, I can myself call the function and the funds will be returned and I get whatever proceeds there are. And this is like credit delegation, the actual potential from the protocol, from the depositors to smart contracts. And Andre is an interesting individual. I mean, we have worked for quite a while.
01:18:56.920 - 01:19:52.360, Speaker D: We always brainstorm in things. What I like about Andre is that we build the things for Abe and we build common stuff, and also we help each other in terms of brainstorming ideas. It's also kind of like a mental support for each other in terms of things are going quite hectic in Defi. And it's not easy, especially for Andre, because he started to develop by himself. Now people are helping, which is amazing, but there's a lot of stress when you're building stuff on mean. He made a post once about how building on defi sucks, and it really sucks in sense that people want to blame and point fingers. It's kind of like always.
01:19:52.360 - 01:21:16.986, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, the coolest part about this relationship is that Andre has bigger things. When you talk about ideas with someone like maybe this and that could be built normally it never happens or you find only kind of reasons not to build. But usually with Andre, he builds it and that's a cool thing to do. And there's many of these kind of developers that are shipping and some are doing it in a different way. But I really like what's happening in the whole ecosystem and I really love how Andre was using Ave already in a way that was pretty cool before this whole wifi phenomena, and that was really amazing. And I'm really happy that he continued back in the days and continued to build part of this relationship stuff with everyone. It also requires that your team is very active in the sense that your developers are happy to help other developers who are not in, let's say, ave, but are building something else, helping them, contributing to their projects.
01:21:16.986 - 01:21:37.580, Speaker D: For me, it's very important that I can actually help someone to build a better product and whether they utilize aave or not, because they're in the ecosystem and it's important, especially security wise, that everyone kind of gets the resources that they need because you can build the whole reputation and lose it quite quickly if something goes wrong.
01:21:38.030 - 01:21:50.814, Speaker C: You almost get the sense with teams like Ave and developers like Andre that they're not just building for their own products, they're building for the entire Defi ecosystem. Is that.
01:21:50.932 - 01:22:52.274, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. And I think we all are in the sense that the Defi is just one step. It's a step one. And it's funny, we started with Defi because talking about the whole Ethereum ecosystem, because it's just like finance makes sense to have financial backbone, but then there's going to be cooler stuff, there's going to be nfts, collectibles tokenized, different kinds of value and ecommerce on chain. There's plenty of stuff. Once we realized that actually those barriers that we had in our minds actually are just restrictions for imagination, when we get that on the side, we will unlock the real capital. I mean, if you can custody and you can tokenize a dollar, why can't you tokenize a tv or a PlayStation or a game? There's so many things you could actually do in the future, and I'm bullish on that side.
01:22:52.274 - 01:23:02.642, Speaker D: And DeFi will be this backbone that will help fuel more fire in these different spaces that we will see in Ethereum.
01:23:02.786 - 01:23:38.450, Speaker B: So Stani, I want to turn to avenomics and I want to read a little excerpt from the Avenonomics introduction, just a very first sentence. The goal of the Ave tokenomics, through its incentives and policies, is to create a shelling point where the protocol's growth, sustainability and safety take priority over individual stakeholder objectives. Stani, can you kind of give us the. Too long, didn't read on the. I'm going to redo that. Stani, can you give us a summary of Avenomics and its ethos and role and importance of the future of the protocol?
01:23:38.790 - 01:25:05.360, Speaker D: Totally, totally. And that basically part of actually was Jordan from our team, who basically led a bit the Avenomics project in Aave came up with, and I really like the quote and what's interesting about avenomics, once we shipped the protocol back in January, that was the very second thing we started to focus on the very next day. So we continued straight away to work with Avenomics. We didn't rest at all, and our goal was just to figure out how we could actually benefit our token holders. So we never thought about token itself. It's just a commodity, like a token for actually how the community can voice out, but how they could actually benefit from the protocol but also contribute into it. And we were thinking what is the most important thing for a financial protocol, what's the most important thing? And we were thinking that if something goes down, let's say if there is some sort of like a shortfall event, failed liquidation or security breach or whatnot, that will be very devastating, not just for Ave, but the whole space.
01:25:05.360 - 01:26:01.210, Speaker D: And to some extent we understood that these protocols will scale, especially if there's adoption. I never knew that it will come more faster than I expected. But we know that what we need to build in terms of token economics has to also take into consideration the scale that we can scale at some point. But we started to think that we really need to somehow get people to contribute to securing the protocol. And in essence, what the ave token, it's basically migrate token from the land to Ave. That we have the migration coming up actually quite soon. And the idea is that when the token holders are making decisions, they factually are making decisions on risk parameters and risk based decisions.
01:26:01.210 - 01:26:50.010, Speaker D: So what kind of collaterals could be added into the protocol, what kind of markets could be created and risk parameters, and on the return they're taking the risk transfer. So they're taking the risk of what they're deciding. And because they're doing that, they basically get rewards. There's passive and active risk taking. So the active risk taking is when you're staking into the protocol, you're staking your tokens. What it means is that if there's some sort of like a shortfall event, let's say failed liquidation, or a bulk or smart contract hack, what happens there is that 30% of the staked amounts that you're risking and getting rewards. So you're basically earning.
01:26:50.010 - 01:28:01.110, Speaker D: Abe could be slashed, which basically means that they could be sold. And the passive one is the version where if that stake doesn't cover and the loss is more substantial, then there is this maker style minting facility. And then we added one additional function here is this built in backstop module of stable coins that are placing auction bits and buying those slashed or minted tokens. And all of the reasoning why we came up, besides the safety, why this type of mechanism? There were certain events during this year, like the Black Thursday, the flash loan attacks, the deforce hack and BCX hacks as well. And what was interesting for us is actually to monitor how was the aftermath handled. And it proved some interesting parts like the maker model worked in one way. I mean, they were able to use their token economics to cover a deficit.
01:28:01.110 - 01:29:01.210, Speaker D: Then for that as well, there was this group of individuals and entities that went to this Dai backstop syndicate. And that kind of like mimics our backstop module that is built in. And yeah, I mean, the idea is kind of like focus on the safety, but we have liquidity provider rewards, but they're not that substantial. And the idea is that when you get those rewards by providing liquidity, you're incentivized to bridge them into the staking facility. And then your governance is kind of like in lined towards making secure protocols. So you don't want to have this kind of governance war where on the one side you have people who want safety and other side you have people who want higher yields and just providing liquidity. So it's actually like even there's a lot of functions in simplicity.
01:29:01.210 - 01:29:15.402, Speaker D: We just want to use the market capitalization of Ave to recapitalize the protocol when needed. That simple explanation of my complex explanation.
01:29:15.546 - 01:29:54.058, Speaker B: So when I look at the ecosystem overview and for the listeners, this will be in the show notes, it's docs ave.com slash avonomics, where there's this fantastic, well, a explanation, just document of explanation, but also some really nice graphics which are really helpful to understanding how this ecosystem and Stani, when I look at this, I see a lot of different protocols having their influence in these graphics, right? Like I see components of synthetics and I see components of maker, I see the compound governance module in here. Can you talk about the influences that have helped guide the architecture of the avonomics system?
01:29:54.224 - 01:31:08.530, Speaker D: Yeah, in terms of having the token as a way to secure the protocol, we looked quite a lot into the maker model when it comes to the minting. The staking is more of what we have in synthetics. And this kind of like inflation. We were balancing between actually inflation and the reserve model, and we had an active discussion in our community forums. It's actually quite interesting in terms of even more, what influenced us is the Ethereum itself. So if you think about it, people in Ethereum, they're not actually paying for transactions, you're not paying that your transaction is saved, you're actually paying for security in the sense that you're basically paying, that the transaction doesn't get somehow manipulated. In one sense, Ethereum as well, it has an inflation model.
01:31:08.530 - 01:32:20.162, Speaker D: And so we tend to kind of like, look what's happening in Defi. But a lot of good stuff has been built already on the blockchain network level. And Ethereum was a very big inspiration. And then we had SNX synthetics, very influential, and the maker model, we looked kind of like almost every major protocol, how their token economics were built and we tried to find what's suitable for us, for our community and what was the narrative. And also we look at compound when compound came also with the liquidity mining, and we just were following how that develops. It's a combination of everything that's out there and picking the pieces that fits well in what we're trying to achieve. Somehow I think we did quite good job, but also I noticed that we spend six months every day, a lot of time in designing.
01:32:20.162 - 01:32:37.360, Speaker D: And it's kind of funny that how long it takes to design token economics, it's not, it's not that easy that I usually have been thinking about, but it took a lot of time to design.
01:32:37.810 - 01:33:39.106, Speaker B: So I want to get into the backstop module a little bit more because I think that's one of the newest innovations that avonomics brings. And so to add some context, if you decide to purchase MKR for Makerdao, you are taking the risk of the makerdao system, because if maker ever becomes under collateralized, it needs to mint MKR to fulfill that need, to fulfill that capital. And so as an MKR holder, you are therefore being diluted. So by buying MKR, you are buying access to the, you're buying exposure to the upside and you're also buying exposure to the risk. Now, with the Aave safety module and the backstop module, there is a more explicit way to have more upside and more risk to ave separate from just holding the aave token in your wallet. Can you explain that differentiation and maybe just elaborate on the backstop module and how it distills risk away from one parts of the system and compartmentalizes it into another?
01:33:39.288 - 01:34:38.982, Speaker D: Yeah, definitely. And actually big thanks to you as well, David, because I read one of your posts where explained very well the maker model, and also some of the posts on kind of like what Ethereum is ETR. And what's interesting about this model is definitely like we want to make token holders to feel that they're participating. So if you buy a token, if it's bearing just passive risk, it's less direct, whereas you actually take that value and lock that value. And actually you are subscribing to another risk level. And that also is a risk transfer from the passive holders to the active ones. And also they get rewarded in that sense.
01:34:38.982 - 01:35:50.330, Speaker D: So I think it's kind of like an interesting combination. And of course, if the shortfire is substantial, that the stake doesn't cover the full amount, then there is the passive kind of like subscribing to the risk. So definitely, I think as a model, it has more ladders, and I really like it, because then you can decide to what kind of risk levels you want to subscribe into. And it's interesting to see how it will play out. I don't know if there's any similar to economics actively for a while, but yeah, I feel this is the right thing to do. The good thing is that it's basically up to the governance to decide how to continue in the future and how to change token economics. And that's the cool part about decentralized protocols, but so far so good feedback.
01:35:50.830 - 01:36:49.898, Speaker B: Well, one thing I'm particularly bullish on is the ability to give users choice, right? And that is definitely, I think one of the goals of avenomics is giving the user the ability to choose their level of risk. And that's definitely one thing that smart contracts really allow you to do if you harness their power correctly, is to be able to. There's no such thing as eliminating risk, there's always risk. But if you can control and harness that risk in a particular way, that just means that the Aave protocol is going to be able to scale to more and more users, more and more capital, more and more entities using Aave. And so a line from Ryan is that safety makes defi real world ready. So when you were building this safety module and this backstop module, were you thinking in the lines of just like scale and growth, or were you just thinking in the lines of doing what you need to do to lock down aave to be as secure as possible? What was going through your head as you guys delivered the backstop module?
01:36:50.074 - 01:38:30.522, Speaker D: Yeah. For us, what was interesting, so the backstop module is the actual kind of like a backstop for the slashed or minted Ava tokens that you put stable coins and you can buy it. But the actual safety module, there's two things, but they kind of compensate each other. But in terms of what we were thinking is that we somehow need to provide some sort of a value in case something happens. And the problem that we were facing is that, let's say if you have one or 1 billion locked value in the protocol or more, what kind of ways we can have to somehow insure this amount. And the token economics is an interesting way, because you could incentivize people to stake and use your market capitalization of your community, who are actually making those risk decisions and putting skin on the game, and adjust the incentives in a way that if the protocol grows, the incentives should actually grow as well, to incentivize more staking and you get this kind of like a value loop. And the more the protocol grows, the more actually you can adjust the incentives to incentivize more staking.
01:38:30.522 - 01:38:56.758, Speaker D: And I think that is something we hope to achieve in a way. I mean, whether it will work or not, it really is something we need to see in practice. But at least we know that we are able to incentivize our community to provide this safety. And time will tell how it will play out.
01:38:56.844 - 01:39:28.530, Speaker C: So Stani, this safety module and many of the things we've been talking about, that's just one piece of what you guys are releasing with what I think you're calling Ave v two. Like a whole version upgrade. When is Ave V two actually coming? And is there any other additional thing you'd highlight? I know that it's shipping with so much, and we're going to include a note to the roadmap in our show notes, but when is it shipping? And is there anything else that you'd want to highlight for folks?
01:39:29.190 - 01:40:26.870, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, version two, we started to work quite a while ago. It's based on the version one in terms of as a base layer. But what we worked quite a lot is on the gas optimization and to get rid of all this excess cost. And we were able to reduce over half of the gas costs even more. And we have a bunch of cool features. But this is so important to mention, because you can optimize quite a lot by designing things in a right way. And organizing that is something that I think is important because it allows smaller deposits to be utilized.
01:40:26.870 - 01:41:26.546, Speaker D: Because if you think about the high gas price is actually a barrier to finance. So if you're spending in gas costs so similar amounts that you're earning interest, it doesn't make sense to deposit and take the risk. But besides that, I think what's important that we deploy with a lot of interesting features. So we're trying to help users to switch their positions. For example, what you can do in the Ave version two, you can swap your collateral. So if you're deposited, for example, eat and you borrow die, and you want to, for example, to get exposure to land, you can swap your collateral in one click without returning your loan. So you change your long position and it enables actually collateral trading.
01:41:26.546 - 01:42:16.790, Speaker D: So you can trade collateral at the same time that you have borrowed. And we also have debt swap, so you can swap your debt position. So if you borrowed, let's say, die at 5%, and you already spent that die or converted to USD, let's say USDC is a few percent cheaper for some reason. You could actually, with one click swap your debt to USDC. So actually you're making currency swap and you're making also interest rate swap in the same transaction. And you could perform all the tree even like the collateral swap as well. And we're also having more trading functionality.
01:42:16.790 - 01:42:51.838, Speaker D: There's going to be ability to trade on margin. We improved the a tokens. There's a lot of features. I think it's a long list that's coming up. But also we improved quite a lot the base structure as well. And there's going to be some stuff that we haven't announced, but also we are going to deploy as well, which will be pretty cool things, but something to leave a bit of in terms of excitement.
01:42:52.014 - 01:43:07.894, Speaker C: Stannie, you had me hooked on the 50% gas reduction, sir. That is definitely in these 400 gwe times, that is definitely something we are looking forward to. When, sir? When are we going to see some of this stuff?
01:43:08.092 - 01:43:11.400, Speaker D: Quite soon, actually. Quite soon, sir.
01:43:14.430 - 01:43:37.854, Speaker C: Excellent. The sooner the better. And at the pace you guys are shipping, I think that I'm interpreting soon to mean actually soon. So very exciting, I think, for the bankless community. Can we talk about that though, really quick? I mean, we're talking about 50% reduction, right? So in gas fees. That's great. That's fantastic.
01:43:37.854 - 01:44:31.540, Speaker C: It feels like all protocols are trying to do that sort of thing right now in this high eth gas price world. You also talked about earlier about there's some competition sometimes between protocols, but sometimes there's not as much coordination as you'd like to see. We were talking to Kane from Synthetix recently about this. Why isn't there a court? Or maybe there's something we're not aware of, but is there a coordinated effort from DeFi protocols to work on some kind of a layer two solution? It seems like optimistic roll ups are sort of the preferred solution if everything we're hearing and reading about them are true. Is there some kind of a DeFi roll up that DeFi protocols can coordinate on and to start building together any initiatives like that that could help solve this problem?
01:44:32.390 - 01:45:46.170, Speaker D: Yeah, I definitely agree that there is collaborations, but there isn't actual wider collaboration. And somehow if there would be, I feel that there's a bit of clicking in the sense you might have projects in Silicon Valley that are close together and then you have other projects that are somehow in connected somehow. What I saw previously in DeFi happen is that some projects were working very closely together and trying to take the ownership of DeFi and that is something you can't do. I mean, it belongs to everyone, every project that is in the space and every user. And so maybe that is one of the kind of issues that we are a bit selfish in that sense and need to coordinate a bit more. And of course everyone are busy and focusing on their own communities and also trying to build stuff. But I think we'll see some effort.
01:45:46.170 - 01:46:22.482, Speaker D: I truly believe optimism is quite interesting. Star queries is quite cool, and matic as well. Maddok has some gaming activity and Avagotchi Ave ecosystem project that is launching this kind of like funky cool NFT project where you unlock this Ave. Gotcha. NFTs by saving on Ave. So that's pretty fun. So they're looking into Matic and I am seeing a lot of effort and coordination.
01:46:22.482 - 01:47:32.302, Speaker D: It usually happens in a way that if the Defi community sees some success, then everyone else follows. And these multiple reasons, I guess it's a bit of also uncoordination, like what could be the perfect solution. And also, for example, I have an issue in the sense that I'm very good friends with many of these layer two solutions. And it's very hard to promise to everyone, like we would deploy here and there. You're trying to please everyone at the same time and be very friendly and I don't know, I would see when we see more tools that allows you to, let's say, to transfer your funds from one layer two to another layer two, we come more closer together. Even this layer two solutions themselves. But I think now I've seen a couple of initiatives where projects have come together and tried to make an ecosystem and I think this will grow.
01:47:32.302 - 01:47:38.800, Speaker D: And once there's just a couple of projects, or few projects doing this, risk will follow.
01:47:39.330 - 01:48:29.086, Speaker C: Know some of the Defi founders that we've talked to recently, like Antonio from DyDX, they're developing something on starkware, which you mentioned. Kane had an interesting approach from Synthetix where we kind of talked about Ethereum mainet being like Manhattan and it's overcrowded and busy and it's expensive. And he said, you know what I'm going to go do and synthetics is going to go do is go build a Brooklyn, go build an OVM roll up and make that really nice, get kind of a tooling set up for Defi. And then hopefully other DeFi protocols will come move to Brooklyn. Is that kind of the approach that you're thinking will happen? It'll be a few pioneering Defi projects that kind of build it out for everyone else. And once they find some success, then everyone will sort of move over and coordinate that way.
01:48:29.188 - 01:49:30.030, Speaker D: Yeah, definitely. And I kind of find similarities in London. All the financial action and all the traffic and everything is in the city, that's the financial center, all the jobs are there. But then we have shortage, which is basically where the tech industry is. And it used to be a rough area, but now you see more and more startups there and it's getting better and the ecosystem grown there, and even Facebook and Google have offices there. So definitely this is exactly what I feel that actually you don't need to be in the very busiest place, and the most busiest place might have certain type of transactions, which requires a lot of security, but then when you want to innovate and you could actually go a couple of steps on the side and build there and have this kind of like a clusters. So I definitely love what Kane is visioning.
01:49:30.110 - 01:49:46.466, Speaker B: So you guys just announced that you guys got a electronic money institution license from the UK Financial Conduct Authority. So I don't know personally as a member of Citizen of the US, what that means. Can you kind of explain the significance of this license?
01:49:46.578 - 01:51:11.090, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, the abbey protocol itself, it's decentralized, autonomously running on Ethereum network. But one thing we noticed that actually many people don't have access to this network. And how the steps to take and access into our protocol or our ecosystem or defi in general, there's still many steps, they're not that many as there used to be, but still, I think it's not as much as available as it should be. So what we decided to do, and we actually started this work a couple of years ago in 2018, when everyone else were fleeing out of the space, is that we wanted to actually kind of ensure that once we build this protocol, that actually there's access points. And one of the access points we wanted to have actually was our user interface as well. You can access the other protocol from, I think there's like 50 different ways in wallets. I mean, my ether wallet you can access and deposit and borrow and so forth, and there's a bunch of cool ways to access.
01:51:11.090 - 01:52:36.894, Speaker D: And we wanted to ensure that we could widen the demographic that is using the DeFi. So we went and applied last year, we put our application in and we got our electronic money license last month. And the idea there is what it means that this entity that we have in UK that is practically responsible of integrations and so forth, can actually build a gateway for users to have a payments account where they can convert national currencies into stablecoins, and then they can decide what to do with those stablecoins. And for us, the most important thing is that they could actually then dive into this DeFi world. So it's kind of like this idea of that protocols are the ocean, they're self regulated and so forth. But then we have this kind of like a ports that, where we're dealing with the local currencies and so forth, we have their regulation, and that is something that we want to test out how it will work. Will it bring new users and will it bring a new adoption? And I'm really eager to see how things will move on that front.
01:52:37.092 - 01:53:27.214, Speaker C: Yeah, it's super exciting. I mean, it's something we talk about where there's like this bridge from the traditional old fi system, right, the fiat world and this new DeFi system. And generally the groups that have kind of bridged that gap between these two worlds have been crypto banks, have been exchanges like the coinbases or the binances of the world and geminis of the world, and God bless them. But wouldn't it be great to have a direct point of entry and port of entry and a direct bridge from the fiat traditional banking system into a DeFi protocol? That seems to be essentially what this new license is unlocking for. Yeah, super exciting. Particularly when we get into layer two stuff, too. And we can operate with the speed of centralized crypto exchanges as well.
01:53:27.332 - 01:53:48.040, Speaker D: Yeah, and I mean, it's the very same license that Coinbase is operating in Europe. So it's really exciting how it will help adoption in the like. I want new users. I want people who never used DeFi to actually use. And that is something that is close to my.
01:53:50.810 - 01:54:45.720, Speaker C: We usually, at this stage, we're the bull markets, Donnie. So we usually ask about bull market price predictions because price predictions are always fun. But you know what I'm going to ask is actually number of user predictions and maybe amount of capital predictions locked up. So how soon? DFI's got about maybe 200,000 users right now for being generous. How soon until we hit 10 million? How soon until we hit 100 million and how soon? This is something that Vance from framework said. He thinks that there's the potential that we could get 500 billion in total locked value in DFI in this cycle. Do you think that is possible? So give me user estimates and then give me total locked value in DeFi estimates, if you will.
01:54:46.490 - 01:55:01.660, Speaker D: Yeah, I think we could easily have. By end of the year, there could be definitely like it's hard to estimate. I usually get them wrong.
01:55:03.710 - 01:55:07.760, Speaker C: That's why there's no, everyone gets them wrong.
01:55:09.250 - 01:55:35.510, Speaker D: Let's be optimistic. I think we'll have 1 million DFI users by end of this year. And we will have, let's think of something very realistic. We have 100 billion locked value by end of this year. So either of them I might be right or both wrong. I mean, I'm really bad at predictions.
01:55:37.610 - 01:55:52.426, Speaker C: Well, in the past it sounds like when you were hoping then of 2020 you'd have 5 million locked and now you've got 1.6 billion locked. If anything, you've been underestimating it so far. So we will see. Those are bullish predictions, but we will.
01:55:52.448 - 01:55:52.586, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:55:52.608 - 01:55:59.280, Speaker B: Sony, if you could go ahead and be as incorrect by an equal order of magnitude, I'll be down.
01:56:03.510 - 01:56:13.700, Speaker C: It's definitely very exciting. Stani, thanks so much. I guess last question for you is what can the bankless nation do to help Ave today?
01:56:14.070 - 01:57:34.990, Speaker D: I think the most easiest way is to experience, just experience the possibility of having permissionless global savings account by just holding a tokens. So getting a bunch of a tokens, let's say Adai AUSDC and holding in the wallet and seeing that balance grow without any transactions to see it update. That is fascinating. And what I really love and hope to see is that everyone spreads word on what Defi is. Someone who you might know, might not know. I mean, tell to your friends, family and what is Defi and what do you see the value in? And that is something which brings more people here and the adoption, it comes in a way that we kind of share it to others and use a tokens Adai as an example, show how the thing works and get people excited. I mean, that is something that you could help the whole ecosystem and also help Ave.
01:57:35.490 - 01:57:54.430, Speaker C: Fantastic. Well, you heard Stani, bankless nation. He wants you to tell your friends about bankless. Tell your friends about Defi. Tell your friends about Ave. This a token which is essentially a programmable savings account that you could just hold without a bank. All banklessly.
01:57:54.430 - 01:58:01.894, Speaker C: Fantastic stuff. Stani, thank you so much for joining us today on the podcast. It's been a awesome, awesome to be.
01:58:01.932 - 01:58:04.882, Speaker D: Here and thank you so much, David and Ryan.
01:58:04.946 - 01:58:05.474, Speaker B: Cheers.
01:58:05.602 - 01:58:25.130, Speaker C: All right, guys, action items, a few things for you today. The first is we've written up a delegated credit explainer. You heard Stani reference it during our conversation. We've written that up at bankless. We'll include that in the show notes. Also, second action item is read about avonomics in the Ave roadmap. We will include some links in the show notes.
01:58:25.130 - 01:58:40.958, Speaker C: Stani also mentioned an article that somewhat inspired their tokenomics that David wrote. We'll include that in the show notes as well. Lastly, David, did you see we passed 100 stars, sir, on Apple iTunes? I just noticed that in the past week or two. So we hit our goal. What's our next goal?
01:58:41.134 - 01:59:11.706, Speaker B: Next goal is 500, I think you Ryan told me you got an email saying that we broke the top 100 podcasts in the investing and finance category. And again, it's just at the beginning of the bull market. And I think it's well within reason that as this bull market continues, you can see bankless in the top ten of the investing and finance podcast space. That's my personal goal. I want to do my best to get bankless there. And so I've gone and given my own podcast, a five star review. And you should, too.
01:59:11.706 - 01:59:28.186, Speaker B: So by the time 2021 rolls around, by the time there's 500 billion locked in DFI, bankless is the top of the iTunes charts. And we are onboarding people into the bankless world as fast as possible. And you can help in that effort by giving us a five star review wherever you listen to podcasts.
01:59:28.298 - 01:59:33.390, Speaker C: All right, let's do it, guys. Finally, risks and disclaimers, of course. We always end with this.
01:59:33.460 - 01:59:36.066, Speaker A: Eth is risky. Ave protocol is risky.
01:59:36.098 - 01:59:41.686, Speaker C: Crypto is risky in general. This is not financial advice. You could lose what you put in.
01:59:41.708 - 01:59:44.802, Speaker A: But we are headed west. This is the frontier.
01:59:44.946 - 01:59:50.340, Speaker C: It's not for everyone. But we are glad you are with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
