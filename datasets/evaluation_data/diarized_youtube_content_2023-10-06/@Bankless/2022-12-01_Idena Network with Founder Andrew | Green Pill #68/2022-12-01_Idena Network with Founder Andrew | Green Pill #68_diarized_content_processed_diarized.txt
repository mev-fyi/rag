00:00:04.810 - 00:00:46.378, Speaker A: What up, coordination? How you doing? We are continuing our exploration of decentralized identity with the founder of the Idina Network. Andrew, who is an anon, is joining us today to talk about their approach to doing civil resistance. So basically, ideana is what they call the first proof of person blockchain. And basically personhood is proved by showing up online with then a strict window of time in solving a series of flip tests. Think of them as like kind of CAPTCHAs, like human intelligence tests to make it so that bots can't operate accounts. This is called a validation session. And if maximum is successful, Idina helps create a more democratic borderless world.
00:00:46.378 - 00:01:19.762, Speaker A: We talk about quadratic staking, we talk about Gitcoin integrations, we talk about why civil resistance, how we can create a more democratic web3 with civil resistance in this episode and then just various use cases for proof of personhood. So I think this is one of the more technical episodes that we've done. Andrew is kind of a I would say he's like a deep technical subject matter expert. If you want to go deep on civil resistance, probably a good episode for you. And if you're watching on video, we have no video for this one because Andrew is a none. But if you're listening to audio, it'll sound the same as any other podcast. So a fun episode.
00:01:19.762 - 00:01:34.138, Speaker A: I think that civil resistance is important. ideana is one of the many players out there making an earnest try at creating more civil resistance. And so, without further ado, I hope that you enjoy this episode about civil resistance with Andrew, the founder of the Idina Network. Enjoy.

00:03:26.708 - 00:03:28.880, Speaker C: Yeah. Hey, Kim. Great.
00:03:29.490 - 00:03:41.250, Speaker A: Really have been going deep on civil resistance this season of the Green Pill podcast and so really excited to talk about Idina. Tell us about Idina and how you think about civil resistance.
00:03:41.750 - 00:04:37.926, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks for inviting us, really appreciate that. I think the civil resistance is a very important topic and it's getting even more and more attention across different platform. Last time, let me introduce myself first. I'm Andrew, I'm a co founder for Dina. I'm software engineer and before crypto. I've been for more than ten years in it, and I've learned about bitcoin in 2015. And I was really amazed about bitcoin because what I learned about it is it's not a digital currency, it's not like a PayPal, but it's something new, and it has no underlying asset, and it's kind of a value itself, which exists on the web, which was really kind of amazing idea.
00:04:37.926 - 00:05:57.978, Speaker C: And the most important part for me was that nobody solely controls the bitcoin. So it's what civil resistance is about. And in 2015 we started the semidecentralized Crypto Exchange. It was the first Swiss based crypto exchange in Europe and it was a noncustodial semidecentralized setup where you could control your money with a private key so that exchange could not get your deposited coins, but at the same time you could trade back and forth with the speed of normal centralized exchange. So what we did is we provided the payment channels for trading for users and it was a building block for Lightning Network. But we were live even before the Lightning Network was launched that time and we learned a lot about the layer two scalability solutions and there are lots of trade offs about that and it's a complexity liquidity problem and ultimately all the layer two scalability techniques are kind of constrained by the limitations on the first layer of the blockchain itself. And that was the starting point for ideana.
00:05:57.978 - 00:06:46.106, Speaker C: We actually decided to solve that problem. So we didn't want to make identity protocol. And Idea was that we just make a scalable blockchain that can perform a substantial number of transactions without decreasing the level of decentralization. And actually this is kind of we try to solve this scalability three lemma. So the idea is that we just enable parallel on chain computation which reaches a sharding. And instead of running one blockchain, we run just many interconnected chains. And instead of running just one state machine, we run multiple state machines which are secured by independent set of validators.
00:06:46.106 - 00:07:40.254, Speaker C: So how can we make it securely? To make it that possible, we just needed to have as many independent validators as possible to secure every chain. So we needed to have an excessive decentralization, which is I think the key for solving the scalability trillion and the civil resistant. That time was really practical for us. It has really practical meaning for us. But the problem was that we couldn't find the right basis for this decentralization. What we understood that time, that money doesn't work, staking doesn't work because of the nature of capitals. Its wealth is getting pareto distributed all the time.
00:07:40.254 - 00:08:54.546, Speaker C: So we go like rich get richer. So we needed to find a better basis for civil resistance, which is kind of scars but opposite money. And the question was so what is the most evenly distributed resource on the planet? It's not money, it's not CPUs, it's not electricity, so what is that? And the answer was it's us, it's human beings. So yeah, this is how we started with the civil resistance. Interesting part here is that because we just came up with the idea of human beings, we tried to get better understanding of civil resistant problem because initial definition of civil resistant attack was telling us about the large number of pseudonymous accounts which attacker can create to get a disproportionately large influence on the system. But Satoshi actually changed that definition. So instead of using accounts, he used CPUs.
00:08:54.546 - 00:09:59.420, Speaker C: Like to make a civil attack on proof of work, you need to buy lots of CPUs to make a civil attack on proof of stake system, you need to buy lots of coins. Like for example, to attack Ethereum, you need to have many accounts with 32 Ethers each and kind of a joke. To attack a Twitter you need to make many accounts with $8 each, which is kind of a joke. But is it going to be kind of civil resistance resistant? I don't think so. And what we currently have in Ethereum that more than 70% of the blocks are currently OFAC compliant, which means that 70% of validators actually follow their rules. And is it okay? I don't think so. And the problem is that we are as a community, we just agreed that it's okay to have large stakeholders dominating the network if their intentions are good.
00:09:59.420 - 00:10:39.080, Speaker C: So if they're not interested in attacking the system because they lock their stakes but I think it's not okay. And the reason is actually what we have in Ethereum is a civil attack. I mean, the civil resistance is not about intentions. Civil attack definition is telling us about an attacker gaining disproportionately large influence on the system. This is what we have. You see that these 70% of Validators who follow the of fuck rules are just a few guys and this is nothing but civil attack. And we failed to handle it and we failed the civil resistant war already.
00:10:39.080 - 00:11:07.650, Speaker C: And the problem is that we accepted that. And now if you want to solve that, we just need to acknowledge that problem. I think we shouldn't welcome civil attackers even if their intentions are good, because regulators can come in and local government may come or their intentions may change or what if they can short the stake coins?
00:11:09.110 - 00:11:38.330, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that we've kind of trotted the ground on green pill of why civil resistance matters a lot. So basically, moving from one token, one vote Dows to more one human, one vote Dows creates more democracy in how tokens are distributed and how decisions are made. And I'd be curious if you sort of agree with that summary, if there's anything you would add to it. And then I want to talk about how Idina creates civil resistance.
00:11:42.930 - 00:12:55.082, Speaker C: Yeah, but before we just dive into this specific of Ie, I would rather tell a bit more about the building kind of a unique identity primitive. Because when we started Idino, we tried to find the existing solution for unique identity primitive. And the problem was that idea is the blockchain. And we needed to find a kind of a layer one identity solution. But identity data is very sensitive and it's not usually suitable for storing this data on blockchain because blockchain is immutable. And we try to find kind of privacy preserving or even better anonymous solution for that. And there were many other problems like we needed to have the open source solution, we need to have decentralized AI, resistance resistant and non contextual, non subjective.
00:12:55.082 - 00:13:35.534, Speaker C: So it should be like a global registry of validated identities. And finally it should have been like we needed to find it like a puppet resistant solution, which I think was the most difficult. And we tried to iterate with many approaches. We decided just not to go with the government based IDs because of the privacy issue, government trust issue. And we learned about biometric solutions. There are proprietary solutions that cannot work with blockchain and open source solutions have their own trade offs. How the biometrics is analyzed.
00:13:35.534 - 00:14:58.278, Speaker C: Either it's publicly available, like you publish your biometrics data on chain, and then you have a privacy issue or deepfakes issues, or it's a client side analysis, like you have a public neural net with some ZK knowledge proof. But then you also have some problems with white box attacks and the adversarial perturbation attacks, which can be applied for the neural nets. And the last options that we could use that was the attendance based protocol. So because other protocols couldn't work with blockchains, there are too many trade off. And we just decided to go with the kind of a protocol that is based on participation of users during the kind of a validation seminars. So the idea is that people cannot have many accounts because they cannot be in many places at the same time because the time is scars. And we can build a protocol around that idea and kind of make it in a way like people mutually validate each other without any centralized party.
00:14:58.278 - 00:15:34.550, Speaker C: So initial idea was to run a global Zoom party when people talk to each other at the same time. We tried, we tested that, but it wasn't scalable enough. And then we just decided to go with the validation ceremony when people where people just communicate with each other with some kind of a prearranged test. And this is how we started Idina. We started building our own protocol for unique identity primitive.
00:15:36.330 - 00:16:27.142, Speaker A: Right. So it seems like you wanted to have a civil resistance technique that was going to be privacy preserving. Didn't have any you know, these Zoom meetings were sort of like the prior for you. We actually had Brian Ford on the podcast a few episodes ago, and he talked about four ways to create civil resistance biometric, Nation, State, IDs, Web of Trust, and then the fourth one was presence based. And so the one that really jumps out to me with these sort of Zoom parties being the method through which you wanted to emulate with the Idea protocol is presence based. If I'm in the presence of you at a certain time, then you can't be two people at once on that same Zoom party without people catching you. Is that a fair take and a fair synopsis of what you said?
00:16:27.276 - 00:16:47.390, Speaker C: Yeah, that's right. This is what we tried and tested, and we couldn't kind of build the right protocol for Zoom meetings because we need to, you know, to let people talk at the same time and challenge each other at the same time, which is pretty complicated.
00:16:50.210 - 00:16:58.850, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, this feels like a great jumping off point to talk about the Idea ceremony and how Idina creates civil resistance. So you want to take us down that rabbit hole?
00:17:00.710 - 00:17:44.674, Speaker C: I might take a bit, like some more kind of details about what Idea is because I want to emphasize that ideana is not a civil resistance solution. It's not an identity solution. It's a blockchain. And it's a general purpose blockchain that aims to encourage running human centered apps on top of it. It's based on democratic principles, like one person, one vote. And it's not a kind of smart contract or it's not a fork of any existing blockchain. It was developed from scratch, and it's secured by the network of nodes which run by people.
00:17:44.674 - 00:18:43.646, Speaker C: It's either individual or family nodes, and every person can run the validating node with equal voting power, which makes Idea one of the most decentralized blockchains. And there are around 600 nodes up and running as we speak. So the core concept of the Idea protocol is a unique identity and we call it crypto identity because it's somehow similar to cryptocurrency. It has no underlying identity data, it's anonymous, it's global. So uniqueness is not contextual, and it has no central issue that could certify your uniqueness. And it's based on mutual verification and validation parties. And I think the most fascinating part about Idea civil resistance and puppet resistance is that it's not just empowered by the crypto identity concept, but it's empowered by the Quadratic Staking.
00:18:43.646 - 00:19:17.630, Speaker C: So I think that Quadratic Staking is the most important part about Adina because civil resistant identity itself, I think sorry to say that, but I think that civil resistant identity is a myth. However, the identity primitive, like unique identity primitive is a missing element for building civil resistance system. And if you don't mind, I just want to tell a bit more about this provocative statement because please do.
00:19:17.700 - 00:19:18.526, Speaker A: Let's go there.
00:19:18.628 - 00:20:10.414, Speaker C: Yeah, I think we were very idealistic when we started Idina. We wanted to build a democratic system based on pure proof of personhood. Like one person, one vote governance system with equal mining, reward distribution without any initial investment, no staking. We wanted Idea to pay equal UBI for their validators. But the problem is that unique identity is not enough for that. It isn't civil resistant by itself and it doesn't matter which protocol you use for the proof of Python Hood, either Biometrics or Web of trust or it could be even government based identity. Interesting thing is that there was a really cool project, it's called Ubik, like UBIC, you can Google it.
00:20:10.414 - 00:21:06.500, Speaker C: It's a kind of proof of passport identity. Know, to make your identity, you just need to scan your NFC chip of your passport with your iPhone and you can get the zero proof of your identity on the blockchain immediately. It was so cool and so simple solution and it worked really well until one guy from China came in and just submitted around 20,000 passport in one single batch. It's really crazy. And the problem is that you can do the same with video verification so people can say you some words for you on camera just for a few cents. They can scan their faces or iris for a few cents. They can do even on a regular basis if you just pay them.
00:21:06.500 - 00:21:43.806, Speaker C: And this is kind of the evolution of fake identity. Arm race, essentially proof of personhood is just the final stage of that arm race. At the beginning we had algorithmically based generated accounts, like in the early stage of web two. So it's more or less solved. The problem was more or less solved by CAPTCHAs. We still use it. And then the next stage was like of this arm race was just human generated accounts where one guy could make hundreds of accounts per day.
00:21:43.806 - 00:22:53.250, Speaker C: And we currently have these human farms generating thousands of accounts, 24/7 sitting together. And the third stage is a proof of personhood protocols, which problem is these protocols can be attacked with the kind of puppets where many people can generate just many account. Each account is linked to one person and these puppet accounts are valid from the proof of kind of personal protocol perspective, but they are not civil resistant. What I mean, so it's not possible to prove who is exactly the owner of account. And it's really hard because usually these people, these kind of puppets, they are not interested in kind of claiming their own accounts, their ownership of their account. So yeah, this is a bad news for all the professional protocols. That system based on unique identity are not civil resistant.
00:22:53.250 - 00:24:07.858, Speaker C: And I would call that a naive proof of personhood. So the thing is that the system that formalizes unique identity and kind of neglecting the capital create strong incentives for corruption and identity collusion is a kind of a form of authoritarian systems like where you have strong leaders on the ground that can coordinate lots of people just to extract the value. Yeah, and what we have is ultimately we have two extremes. There on the left side, on the left hand we have an authoritarian systems where money doesn't matter, it's an identity centric system. And on the right side we have plutocratic systems which are token centric. And on that side, the identity doesn't matter. And good news about that, that both sides, like both extremes, authoritarian and plutocratic systems are just extremes located on the same dimension.
00:24:07.858 - 00:24:18.190, Speaker C: And we can generalize them them and we can find a middle way between them by combining them together. And this is what we call Quadratic Staking.
00:24:20.210 - 00:24:23.250, Speaker A: Got it? Yeah. So tell me about Quadratic Staking.
00:24:23.670 - 00:25:33.990, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that Quadratic Staking is a real gem. We were lucky to discover that idea and I'm happy to share details about that with you. The Quadratic Staking is the model that actually combines proof of stake and naive proof of personhood. It's something that makes your mining rewards proportional to square root of your stake. So essentially it solves the plutocracy problem inherent in capitalist system. So it discriminates against whales or large scale investors and at the same time it increases the weights of small users and encourages them to participate more actively. So to make Quadratic Staking work, you need to have this unique identity primitive because otherwise large stakeholders could just split their stakes across many accounts.
00:25:33.990 - 00:26:36.890, Speaker C: But with the proof of personhood or kind of unique identity primitive, you can stake the coins only if you have this kind of account validated account. And you can be slashed if you don't prove your liveness. And at the same time, if you want to withdraw your stake, then you need to terminate your account. So your stake is fully connected with your unique identity. And basically your stake is always at risk related to your proof of your uniqueness, of your identity. And which actually makes the identity primitive, more civil resistant. On the one hand we have a Quadratic Staking, which is just an improved version of Linear Staking, but on the other hand, it makes a unique identity itself more civil resistant and more puppet resistant.
00:26:36.890 - 00:27:37.760, Speaker C: So this is what we actually see currently in Idina during last few months. So before Quadratic Staking, we observed a really aggressive growth of human farms. And after we released the Hard fork update with the Quadratic Staking model, then we see the decrease in human farms. Actually human farms just who made their accounts just to extract the value from the network decide to stop their business. This is what Quadratic Staking and of course, Quadratic Staking has its own drawbacks. So I mean, the main downside of the Quadratic Staking is its exclusivity. It's an advanced version of Linear Staking, but unfortunately the monetary component of unique identity just filters, excludes some people.
00:27:37.760 - 00:28:16.570, Speaker C: And a fully inclusive and democratic system where every person has equal income and equal rights is a subject of coercion. And I think that it's an unachievable and idealistic and Ethiopian, unfortunately. So the Quadratic Staking is a kind of a compromise between two extremes, like a capitalistic system that doesn't take into account identity and communist system that denies the role of private capital.
00:28:17.070 - 00:29:15.520, Speaker A: Right? So it seems like it's a way of staking your tokens, wherein the amount of tokens in the voting power that you get from staking is a square root of the amount of tokens. So it's more democratic than a full one to one token system, but one human, one vote. It's not fully on that spectrum. And my experience with quadratic funding, quadratic voting is via Gitcoin. And one of the things we've always thought was really powerful about quadratic funding is that it gives the people with more capital, more of a voice and an incentive to give more of their capital. But it doesn't give them one to one, it gives them a square root, like a decaying more influence for putting in more capital, which is a way of weighting the whole system on some towards the poor and the many, over the rich and the few, but still giving the rich people an incentive to participate. Do you see any sort of symmetries between Quadratic Staking and quadratic funding there?
00:29:16.050 - 00:30:15.940, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. Actually the Quadratic Staking idea was fully inherent from Glenwale ideas about quadratic voting and quadratic funding proposed by Vitalik. It's very important concept and the more projects follow this concept, the more civil resistant the whole ecosystems can be. Because otherwise if you just consider the identities, like identities without stakes, like equal, then you automatically create pressure and incentives for authoritarian guys who can coordinate people on ground and just create puppets. So we need to use this approach widely across many projects. It's very important.
00:30:16.710 - 00:30:53.254, Speaker B: Working in web3 is awesome. It's freeing, powerful and so much fun. But working outside of the typical W two employee structure is a deal breaker for so many.

00:32:12.730 - 00:32:23.882, Speaker A: You know, I'd love to get into the actual Idea ceremony at some point. Does that make sense to steer the conversation there? Is there anything else you wanted to say before we get into that? Cool.
00:32:23.936 - 00:32:24.250, Speaker C: Sure.
00:32:24.320 - 00:32:34.170, Speaker A: And this is fun for me because I participated in an Idea ceremony, I think it was about a year ago. Could you tell us about how IDna actually verifies the humans?
00:32:36.030 - 00:33:09.510, Speaker C: Yes. The idea protocol. As I said, it's the attendance based protocol. So there is no QYC, no biometrics. So the protocol is based on regular validation ceremony where you need to prove your aliveness and uniqueness by participating in that. And it's based on idea that you cannot be in many places at the same time. So all participants appear online at the same time across the world and prove their personhood by solving so called Flip Tests.
00:33:09.510 - 00:33:41.570, Speaker C: Flip Tests is a kind of a capture, but they made by other participants, which makes them more AI resistant. And Flip is abbreviation. It stands for Filter Fly intelligent People. It's a binary test. So we need to solve a bunch of these tests to prove your personhood. And there are two sides of these tests, like two answers. They looks like a comics.
00:33:41.570 - 00:34:17.630, Speaker C: There are sequences of images that tell you a story without using any text. It's language agnostic. So every flip has two versions of the story. One is correct and one is shuffled. And to complete this test, you need just to identify which story makes more sense for the majority of other people who also solve this test. So solving this flip test is pretty simple. It's not an IQ test, but it's even kids can do these tests.
00:34:17.630 - 00:35:28.262, Speaker C: Even if you get the difficult flip during the ceremony where you cannot identify the right answer, it's most likely will be disqualified by the consensus because other people who also cannot solve this flip, they will vote randomly and will not be able the committee will not be able to reach the consensus about the right answer and the flip will be disqualified. And the author of this flip will be kind of the author will just lose some rewards because of that. So, yeah, this is pretty much it about the ceremony. And we have this ceremony like, on a regular basis, and the epoch duration depends on the network size. The larger the network, the less frequent the ceremony play. This is pretty much about the ceremony itself, so let me know if it makes sense.
00:35:28.316 - 00:35:42.358, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I remember participating in the ceremony, and this might have been last summer that I participated in one, but if I recall, it was every two weeks. The ceremonies were happening back then. Does that seem like the right time interval?
00:35:42.534 - 00:36:13.426, Speaker C: Yeah, that's right. It was two weeks. As I said, it's a function of the network size and it always happens at the same time. And it happens like, early in the morning for the America and late at night for the Asia. And it's like 130 p. M. UTC time.
00:36:13.426 - 00:36:16.050, Speaker C: Which is a date for your opinions.
00:36:17.110 - 00:36:49.520, Speaker A: Yeah, and I recall basically getting online and then opening up, I think it was an idea website or it might have been an application. And then for ten or 15 or 20 minutes, I can't recall solving a series of these flips, and I remember thinking that they do kind of feel like CAPTCHAs in a way. And I know that I passed the ceremony and I was part of the registry for a little while after that, which was cool. I can't remember if I got any tokens for doing it. Go ahead.
00:36:50.290 - 00:37:48.834, Speaker C: Yeah, actually the thing is that the identity is not forever, so it just lasts for until the next validation. So you can actually miss up to two validations in a row and then your identity got terminated. And once you get verified, once you get validated with the ceremony, you can run your node and get some kind of coins for. That and the validation itself can be run both on desktop version of the Adinab or we recently developed maybe it was like a year ago. We just deployed the web version so it's available on the browser. So you can just connect to any shared node that provided by the community. And you can even run it on your mobile, which is really nice.
00:37:48.834 - 00:37:52.180, Speaker C: So you can do the validations wherever you are.
00:37:53.270 - 00:38:09.820, Speaker A: Yeah, well, you know, the one thing I did after I went through the ceremony was I went onto the Gitcoin website and I verified my identity on Gitcoin so that I could get more matching. So it was neat to see Gitcoin and Idina interoperate in that way.
00:38:10.590 - 00:38:28.186, Speaker C: Yeah, that's true. Actually. Now we have the Gitcoin passport, right. And we actually submitted the pull request to get that integration with the Gitcoin passport.
00:38:28.218 - 00:38:57.720, Speaker A: As yeah, cool. Well, I'm curious if there's anything I didn't ask that you want to say about Idina. I think it's really neat to see a bunch of different pluralistic ways of creating more civil resistance, work together and build this ecosystem. So I'm curious if there's anything that I didn't ask that you want to say.
00:38:58.990 - 00:39:08.154, Speaker C: Probably I would like to explain a bit about our anonymity. I think it's a very important part of idea project.
00:39:08.352 - 00:39:09.100, Speaker A: Right.
00:39:09.630 - 00:40:20.820, Speaker C: First of all, I wanted to say thank you, Kevin, for inviting us even regardless on our it's also it's the first time we speak in public that way. Actually. We committed to stay anonymous, inspired by Satoshi and as well as in Bitcoin, we didn't make any ICO, so the project is fully open source and anyone can follow and contribute. And the main reason why we stay anonymous is we wanted to minimize our influence on the protocol. So we want the community to decide about the protocol values. And I think it's very important feeling when community members just feel in charge of protocol changes. We are as a team, we cannot make any simple changes in the protocol, so we cannot deploy any hard work without community support because the validators who control the network and users who use the system are the same people.
00:40:20.820 - 00:40:52.590, Speaker C: So we are very thankful to our community for their activity and involvement into the protocol governance. And I want to say special thanks to all our old guys. I want to say that we hear you. We do our best to follow your discussions and read your comments and thank you for staying with us for such a long time, really appreciate that. And we really share your passion about building democracy and sustainable civil resistance.
00:40:54.850 - 00:42:00.100, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I do think that there's really an important I don't want to say trade off, but I want to say a design criteria of creating actual civil resistance but still protecting privacy. I think that that's a really important thing that you just can't bolt on at the end and of the mechanisms that Brian Ford told us about presence based Biometric, KYC and Web of Trust. It feels like there's a lot of in that trade off space privacy concerns that I really have concerns about with KYC and biometrics and I think relying totally on presence based and Web of Trust is a really elegant way of creating more civil resistance but also maintaining privacy. And it seems like y'all are doing it and the fact that you're anon yourself as the founder I think is an interesting fact pattern that supports the privacy at the base else is there any other sort of important design criteria that you want to tell us about?
00:42:02.390 - 00:43:37.986, Speaker C: Yeah, I would also like to tell a bit about the use cases of human centric blockchains in general because there are some that are really on the surface but like votings dows airdrops quadratic voting, quadratic funding UBIs and actually we have Quadratic Staking and we have Adena as the blockchain is also the use case for unique identity primitive. But we also have many things to discover and I would like to name few of them. For example, it's the on chain ads. We do experiment with that and nobody likes ads, but on chain ads is a different concept and it's something that you just publish on chain and anybody can pull that out and just view that ads. And we build you kind of a protocol based on self targeted ads and I think it's a huge market that still doesn't exist on chain, which is really interesting and it can only work with the unique identity primitive. Then interesting idea is about the content moderation. This also we do some experiments with that.
00:43:37.986 - 00:43:59.114, Speaker C: We use randomly selected human Oracles for the ads moderation and probably another version of that we could experiment with fake news analysis, it's a subject to explore but probably could make some experiments with that.
00:43:59.312 - 00:44:06.940, Speaker A: Yeah. And is there an ecosystem of people that are building these type of things on top of Idina? Tell me about the community.
00:44:07.390 - 00:45:12.886, Speaker C: Yeah, we already have built in into the client the Oracle voting system. So if you're a validated identity, then you just can participate in the Oracle votings. You can run your own votings and it's a kind of civil resistant votings where you can do different things. Like you can ask participant to stake something before they vote, before they publish their role, or you can just pay for some polls asking their opinions. So yeah, all this stuff is already there. So you can even lock some coins and unlock the coins based on Oracle's decision. So that Oracles are just randomly selected from the network and they can decide whether to unlock the coins or just keep them locked.
00:45:12.886 - 00:46:21.110, Speaker C: This is actually the interesting primitive that we anticipate to use in order to implement kind of a decentralized gitcoin, so decentralized common good funding platform. We actually have a so called zero wallet in Adena protocol where portion of inflation is getting locked. And it's really big challenge how to spend that coin safely. And, yeah, this is kind of a subject that we need. To explore and experiment with and community does really interesting experiments with that running community multi sick like a community wallet and yeah hopefully we'll manage to build some kind of an automation like decentralized smart contracts that could be able to fund projects driven by the randomly selected Oracles.
00:46:22.330 - 00:46:29.740, Speaker A: Great, well, this has been a really fun episode learning about your take on civil resistance. Is there anything that I didn't ask that you want to say from here?
00:46:32.430 - 00:47:14.790, Speaker C: I think it's pretty much it. So what I just wanted to add that we truly believe that human sensory blockchain can make our lives better. We just need to find the right way to build the identity which should be, I think, civil resistant, pipette resistant and privacy preserving and I hope it could lead us to a better world which is more connected, less polarized and more democratic. And we are staying in the dangerous fork on the road. So let's pick the right way to stay safe and coordinated.
00:47:17.470 - 00:47:27.020, Speaker A: Very cool. Yeah. Well, I guess let's wrap by asking where can people find Idina online?
00:47:29.150 - 00:47:40.640, Speaker C: It's a website Idena IO and you can find all the social media out there.
00:47:42.370 - 00:47:49.420, Speaker A: Great. Well, thanks so much for joining me on this episode of Green Pill, really enjoyed the conversation and see you out there in the civil resistant future.
