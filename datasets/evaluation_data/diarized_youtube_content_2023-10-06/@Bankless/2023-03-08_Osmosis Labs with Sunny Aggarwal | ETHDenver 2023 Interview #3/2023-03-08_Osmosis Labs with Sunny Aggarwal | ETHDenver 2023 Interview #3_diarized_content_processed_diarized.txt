00:00:12.730 - 00:00:30.310, Speaker A: We are here at the Axelar Interop Summit and we are going to talk to Sonny Ogerwald, who, when I hear the word Interoperability, I definitely think Sonny. He's been in the Cosmos ecosystem since Cosmos was born, so he is the king of Interoperability if he accepts that title. So we're going to go talk to Sonny right after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that makes this show possible.
00:00:30.380 - 00:01:10.642, Speaker B: Kraken is our strategic sponsor for 2023. Why? Because Kraken has been around for over twelve years and has proven itself to be deeply aligned with the crypto industry. Trusted centralized crypto platforms are hard to come by these days, which makes the few remaining ones even more valuable. With over 9 million users and not a cent lost, choosing Kraken as our strategic sponsor for 2023 was a no brainer. We need exchanges like Kraken to provide the onramps to get people to go bankless, and Kraken's emphasis on security and transparency makes us feel good about having them as a sponsor. If you're unsure about your centralized exchange or onramp, perhaps open an account with Kraken today. And if you're unsure about the rest of Web Three, well then maybe you should get your Learn on with MetaMask Learn.
00:01:10.642 - 00:01:56.254, Speaker B: Learning about crypto is hard. There's no one out there to hold your hand to get into this industry. Until now. MetaMask Learn is the best place I've ever seen to send someone to learn everything there is to know about Web Three. If you're a company trying to onboard employees, or you're a son or daughter trying to onboard your boomer parents, MetaMask Learn is the place to send them interactive and engaging lessons, making learning about Web Three fun and easy. Now, once you're through the Kraken's gates and you've taken the MetaMask course on what's a Dex, you're safe to make your first stop into the world of DFI. Where better to start other than Uniswap? Uniswap is, of course, a decentralized exchange for crypto asset trades and swaps, but it's now also an NFT aggregator as well, making Uniswap some of the best decentralizing trading tech that's out there.
00:01:56.254 - 00:02:34.298, Speaker B: Uniswap's big announcement at East Denver is their Uniswap wallet, which is waiting to get released to the public as soon as Apple stops being a big ol bully about crypto apps in the App Store. Uniswap is basically on every chain that's relevant in the crypto ecosystem. So if you want to use Uniswap, but with the cheapest possible fees, then use Uniswap on Arbitrum. The Arbitrum L2 is the host of Ethereum's most vibrant DFI and NFT communities. Arbitrum is already surpassing the ETH layer one in transaction volume, and it's not even close to full capacity. With so many vibrant communities on Arbitrum, Arbitrum is a good place to call home for the era of L2s. Speaking of settling into new homes, the Phantom wallet is now available on both Ethereum and Polygon.
00:02:34.298 - 00:02:54.894, Speaker B: That's right, the number one wallet on Solana is expanding into the Ethereum ecosystem. Phantom is the one wallet for everything displaying NFTs, making NFT trades, swapping tokens, Staking tokens. So if you're a multi chain surfer or an NFT power user, then the Phantom wallet is for you. It also comes in mobile. Check it out at Phantom app. Now let's get into the interview bank of the station.
00:02:54.942 - 00:03:02.802, Speaker A: We are back at the Interop summit hosted by Axelar. And I'm here with Sonny Ogerwald. And when I hear the word interoperability, I think of Sonny. How's it going, Sonny?
00:03:02.866 - 00:03:03.734, Speaker C: I'm doing great.
00:03:03.852 - 00:03:08.166, Speaker A: Are you just vibing in this conference that is really custom built for you to vibe in?
00:03:08.268 - 00:03:11.050, Speaker C: Yes, it is. I'm getting to spread the word. Yeah.
00:03:11.120 - 00:03:17.706, Speaker A: So tell me about, as somebody who is largely inside of the EVM world, what is the new meta in the Interop world?
00:03:17.888 - 00:03:35.022, Speaker C: The new meta? Well, Axlar is definitely helping bridge the EVM and IBC worlds. There are new stuff that they're building. It helps you send messages between EVM chains to Cosmos SDK chains very seamlessly. So really excited about that coming about.
00:03:35.156 - 00:03:45.262, Speaker A: What I've understood with Axelar and I've only really learned about it in this last, like, 24 hours is that it is, like, the Cosmos between Cosmos and Ethereum. Is that a fair metaphor?
00:03:45.326 - 00:04:06.982, Speaker C: Yeah, that's right. It's a Cosmos SDK built app chain that lets it's a bridge app chain, basically. So you have many bridges. They're all, like, multi SIG based and stuff, whether it's wormhole, multi chain, whatever. Right. But it's like well, actually, it's similar, but instead of being a multi SIG, it's a proof of stake based Bridging solution.
00:04:07.126 - 00:04:16.766, Speaker A: Okay, so how is that different from other things, like THORChain, for example, or, like, Ren protocol? There's a bunch of other proof of stake middleware chains. Is Axelor really all that different from.
00:04:16.788 - 00:04:45.378, Speaker C: All those so, THORChain, it uses similar technology to THORChain, but THORChain is like it doesn't let you do Bridging. It only lets you use their bridges for Thor chain swaps. And this is part of their whole security model, where they don't want you to use it to bridge stuff. Right. And that's cool technology, but we can't use it with Osmosis. Right. You can think of it almost like Osmosis plus Axlar equals THORChain.
00:04:45.378 - 00:05:15.694, Speaker C: And so we sort of fragmented these two things out. We were like, hey, at Osmosis, should we be building our own bridges? And we looked at all the bridge hacks that were happening. We're like, that is a responsibility and risk that we don't want to take on ourselves. Let's find a team that is really solid and understands this stuff really well. And we went through this whole decentralized bridge bake off process, and we kind of came to the conclusion that Axlar is the team that has the best Bridging tech in the entire space, in our opinion. Okay.
00:05:15.732 - 00:05:23.042, Speaker A: And how much of that opinion is shared by others? Is that your opinion? Or is that kind of the consensus and why there are so many big names here at the Axlar interop event?
00:05:23.176 - 00:05:49.142, Speaker C: So I think part of it is this is like a generalized interop event. So a lot of people have been coming, but I think Osmosis picking Axlar as our canonical bridge. That helped get them on the map. And then basically every other Cosmos chain started using them as well. And now they're starting to be used by I think Polygon supernets are planning on using them. They're a partner for the new base roll up. So I think they're starting to get more and more traction.
00:05:49.142 - 00:05:58.110, Speaker C: And what I really liked about them is they have a lot of functionality, both from the cool features and security functionality that I think other bridges just don't have right now.
00:05:58.180 - 00:06:12.306, Speaker A: Okay, so just to really test my knowledge here, it is a Cosmos IBC chain, and it also, by a nature of what it is, can also connect to non Cosmos IBC chains through its proof of stake consensus, correct?
00:06:12.408 - 00:06:41.606, Speaker C: Yes. So it uses a more traditional multi stake style bridge system. Not multi SIG, but like validator controlled deposit system to talk to EVM chains. So they've connected to ethereum, avalanche, Polygon, Arbitrum, BSE, a couple others. Phantom. But then to talk to Cosmos chains, it uses IBC. And what's really nice is that means for something like Osmosis to talk to Ethereum, we don't have to have our own bridge protocol.
00:06:41.606 - 00:06:47.242, Speaker C: We just talk IBC to Axlar. And Axlar acts like a translation layer for us to talk to EVM chains.
00:06:47.306 - 00:06:57.890, Speaker A: Okay, so it's a translation layer. Is there a bridge risk here? So if Axlar is talking to Ethereum and Phantom and then also Cosmos, how much bridge risk is there present in this system?
00:06:57.960 - 00:07:35.258, Speaker C: Yeah, so it is you could call it like a custodial bridge. Right. The Axlar validators their proof of stake system is custodying the assets that are bridged from the EVM chain. So there is bridge risk. Part of the things that the security stuff that the Osmosis team, we worked with Axlar to design things like rate limiting. So basically, we have the system where only 20% of the Axlar bridges, TBL, can be removed in a six hour period, and otherwise it triggers a circuit breaker. And this is the kind of stuff, if you look at traditional finance systems, a lot of the security properties come from these circuit breaker style systems.
00:07:35.258 - 00:07:48.802, Speaker C: And that's what we've been working with Axlar team to bring these security mechanisms. And that's one of the things that I sleep better at night knowing that, okay, even if there was some sort of bridge hack or something on Axlar, the losses are capped. Right.
00:07:48.856 - 00:08:02.454, Speaker A: Stop loss for bridge hack. So is the bridge that connects Axlar to Ethereum and Axlar to Phantom, those are two separate bridges, not one single bridge. Correct. There's not one central bridge that would collapse all the other bridges, right?
00:08:02.492 - 00:08:06.150, Speaker C: Correct. But it is run by the same validator set, correct? Yes. Okay.
00:08:06.220 - 00:08:14.134, Speaker A: Well, yeah. Security by validator set, I feel like is a pretty known quantity. It's that independent bridge from chain to chain that always seems to be the weak link in all these systems.
00:08:14.182 - 00:08:14.442, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:08:14.496 - 00:08:18.780, Speaker A: And so Axlar still kind of has to work around that kind of risk, right.
00:08:19.390 - 00:08:42.542, Speaker C: I guess to talk to every EVM chain, it's using a similar implementation. So if there's a contract risk, you can imagine that same contract risk probably exists on multiple chains. But then Axlar is working on non EVM bridges as well. And that's kind of what they were announcing at this event, was, like, basically building an SDK that allows more people to build pluggable bridges into Axelr.
00:08:42.606 - 00:08:52.278, Speaker A: Okay, moving on from Axelar, because I know you're actually more of a Cosmos guy. Just speaking on Axilar's behalf, what's going on in the Cosmos ecosystem? What are people really excited about? What's the meta there?
00:08:52.364 - 00:09:30.834, Speaker C: Yeah. So I think the biggest thing of the last one month probably is the Mars launch. So Mars is a lending app chain, and they just sort of launched recently. And so in Cosmos, there have been a couple lending applications, but none of them had real product market fit yet until Mars launched. And they have these borrow caps for security reasons, and I think they hit their borrow caps within 3 hours of launch, and so they're slowly upping that. But so far in Cosmos, we've had a lot of DEXes. Obviously, Cosmos is the biggest one, but lending and borrowing and margin trading is sort of the next big DeFi use case that needs to come.
00:09:30.834 - 00:09:36.760, Speaker C: And we've been working very closely with the Mars team to enable that. And I'm really excited because.
00:09:38.570 - 00:09:38.998, Speaker A: There'S a.
00:09:39.004 - 00:10:12.174, Speaker C: Lot of cool things that we're able to do with Mars because of how closely our teams are working together. One of the things that makes margin trading on Ethereum not as efficient as it could be is that the Ave protocol doesn't know about uniswap. They act as independent protocols. But in our case, the Osmosis Dex knows about the Mars protocol, the Mars protocol knows about the Osmosis Dex. And this allows us to do a lot of cool capital efficiency sort of things a lot more efficient liquidations, all sorts of cool stuff. Okay.
00:10:12.212 - 00:10:22.770, Speaker A: So these things can be like oracles for each other just because of the on chain state that's passed between each app layer or app chain. Is that a feature that is unique to app chains?
00:10:23.110 - 00:10:29.380, Speaker C: It's not unique to app chains. It's unique to collaborating apps. Okay.
00:10:30.250 - 00:10:31.686, Speaker A: I love the nuance on that one.
00:10:31.788 - 00:11:13.118, Speaker C: It's interesting. So, for example yeah, Mars uses Osmosis Twaps. It allows you to use Osmosis LP shares as collateral. It's liquidations instead of doing an auction system similar to what maker compound Ave do, they actually execute against on chain liquidity on Osmosis, the coolest thing is this thing called credit accounts, where what you can do is you can borrow. So in ave today, right? Let's say to borrow $100 of USDC, you have to put down $150 of E. Right. In Mars with the credit accounts, you can put down $50 of atom as collateral, and you can borrow $100 of USDC.
00:11:13.118 - 00:11:31.974, Speaker C: How is this possible? Isn't this under collateralized? Right. The trick is that it's borrowed into a special credit smart contract account. Think of it like a smart contract wallet. That all you can do with it is do certain margin trading on certain pools. And the Mars Protocol has the ability to liquidate from the credit out account directly. Right.
00:11:32.012 - 00:11:37.994, Speaker A: And so you're giving it into a custodial account that limits what you can do, but you still have more capital available to you.
00:11:38.032 - 00:11:43.786, Speaker C: Yeah. Smart contract custodial. Right. It can only pull from your account if a liquidation is triggered. Right.
00:11:43.808 - 00:11:48.270, Speaker A: So you get to it's under collateralized lending, but with constraints on what you can do with that.
00:11:48.340 - 00:11:56.486, Speaker C: Exactly. This is how margin trading works on centralized exchanges. Right. If you have a margin account, you can't withdraw money off of the centralized exchange.
00:11:56.618 - 00:11:58.882, Speaker A: Right. That makes a ton of sense.
00:11:58.936 - 00:11:59.298, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:11:59.384 - 00:12:14.402, Speaker A: So I heard a take recently that Cosmos is really DeFi focused. As in most of the innovation in the Cosmos land is DeFi. There's less gaming, there's less identity. How does that take ring true for you? And what are the other non DeFi parts of Cosmos?
00:12:14.466 - 00:12:50.370, Speaker C: Yeah, so, I mean, obviously I spend my time focusing on the DeFi side of things, but there are things going on. So Stargaze is like this NFT platform. There's a couple of we mentioned the Bad Kids. I think when I mentioned it on the Bankless episode, bad Kids had this huge uptick in popularity since then. And there's a couple of projects working on a lot of cool gaming stuff. So, like, there's this project called Argus. Scott, he was a friend of mine, he was one of the builders of Dark Forest, and he realized that, hey, the Cost SDK actually gives us the ability to build a lot more powerful, fully on chain gaming things.
00:12:50.370 - 00:13:00.550, Speaker C: And so he's building this project called Argus that will enable a lot more gaming app chains and stuff. So we're starting to see the initial proliferation of other use cases as well.
00:13:00.620 - 00:13:25.130, Speaker A: So how does because of Cosmos of what it is, the whole app chain mesh layer. In contrast, we have ethereum with the central shared security, the ethereum community as a result, I call it kind of more coherent. And Cosmos is a little what is the state of the broad set of the Cosmos app chains community? Is each app chain its own community? Is there one broad Cosmos community? Give us the topology of the Cosmos social layer.
00:13:25.210 - 00:13:54.902, Speaker C: Yeah, so there's definitely this meta thing where it's like people are often community members of specific popular app chains like Osmosis has its own community. Kujira, which is another popular dex has its own community. Juno will have its own community. But then at the same time, we're all like, citizens of the Cosmos as a whole. And it's kind of know I'm a citizen, know I grew up in New Jersey, so I'm a New Jersey in, but I'm also an American. Right. And so it's just like you kind of have both layers going on.
00:13:55.036 - 00:13:55.286, Speaker A: Cool.
00:13:55.308 - 00:14:13.866, Speaker C: And then there's always a little bit of like people are often like, oh, there's so much drama in Cosmos. But I think people it's a little bit overblown, actually, to be honest. I think there's often a lot of drama within ethereum as well. Right. You had uniswap SushiSwap compound ave today. Now you have optimism versus Arbitrum. Right.
00:14:13.866 - 00:14:21.566, Speaker C: And so you see similar things. But I think at the end of the day, everyone is still very tied with this larger Cosmos vision and community. Yeah.
00:14:21.588 - 00:14:32.670, Speaker A: Like, sports teams are still all watching the same sport, right? Yeah. Sonny, we got a lot left in the East Denver Conference. It's just Tuesday and it goes all the way until Saturday. What's left on your schedule? What's left on your itinerary?
00:14:32.830 - 00:14:56.630, Speaker C: Yeah. So tomorrow I'm really looking for checking out walletcon. I don't know, just interested. I recently downloaded a new browser and I'm like, this is an opportunity to try out some new wallets. And so I've just been playing around with a bunch of different wallets and exploring like, wow, there's so much cool innovation that's happening. So excited to go check that out. Thursday, there's like, this shared security summit hosted by Eigen Layer and Babylon.
00:14:56.630 - 00:15:07.738, Speaker C: So I'll be giving a talk there about mesh security and how that's, like, the future of Cosmos shared security. And then on the weekend, I'll just be hacking at the hackathon and sonny.
00:15:07.754 - 00:15:09.438, Speaker A: Can you walk us through your sweater, please?
00:15:09.604 - 00:15:31.190, Speaker C: Yeah. This is just our Osmosis Christmas sweater. We did a test batch run this year just for the core development team. I figured, why wear a Christmas sweater only one month a year? I'm going to wear it in February years. But I think we definitely want to figure out how to get these on chain something more like, unisox by next year. Sure.
00:15:31.260 - 00:15:37.254, Speaker A: Sonny, thank you for always walking me through this interoperability world, which, again, I definitely need a guide. And you are always a good one, so thank you so much.
00:15:37.292 - 00:15:37.970, Speaker C: Thank you. Cheers.
