00:00:08.090 - 00:00:17.838, Speaker A: Hey, bankless nation. It is the fifth and final week of June. We have begun July and it is time for roll ups. Weekly roll ups. David, you ready for this?
00:00:17.924 - 00:00:23.338, Speaker B: Absolutely. I drank my coffee, I've got the energy. I'm ready to roll up the week in crypto with you, Ryan.
00:00:23.514 - 00:00:27.350, Speaker A: Dude, it's almost like the the 4 July. Are you celebrating this weekend?
00:00:27.690 - 00:00:34.370, Speaker B: Tomorrow I'm going on a boat, and then on Friday I'm watching fireworks as one does, or, excuse me, on Sunday.
00:00:34.530 - 00:00:52.758, Speaker A: Yeah, as am I. And I was kind of curious, what stage do you think we'll be in where blockchains have their own holidays? Do you think that'll happen? There will be a day like maybe in the future? Was it December 1? E two staking first went live. Will the Ethereum community celebrate that as a holiday?
00:00:52.854 - 00:01:13.620, Speaker B: Right. Well, I can tell you the United States of America will not be celebrating that because that's a nation state holiday, not a blockchain holiday. So really it will only kind of be for the Ethereum native to have kind of their own day. But then it's not a holiday. It's like, hey, it's the 10th anniversary of EIP 1559. Like not coming into work? No, that's not going to happen.
00:01:14.230 - 00:01:33.306, Speaker A: All right, well, maybe we'll celebrate on bankless. Anyway. Sorry for the digress, guys. This is the quickest way to get crypto downloaded into your brain. Every week we cover market releases, news takes, and then what we're excited about this comes out every Friday with your morning coffee live. Not live, but it comes on YouTube and also on the podcast. Feels pretty live.
00:01:33.306 - 00:01:41.446, Speaker A: David, we should talk about Kyber first because we've been promising this for a while, but they just rolled out a really cool liquidity program. What's going on with Kyber?
00:01:41.558 - 00:02:22.534, Speaker B: Yeah, Kyber is doing a liquidity mining program both on the l one but also on the Polygon l two. This is part of the DFI summer thesis L2 edition, is that there's going to be a bunch of liquidity mining rewards existing on the L2. So if you're looking on the screen, you can see all of the different ways that you can get some extra yield on your yield. Yo dog, I heard you liked yield. So if you are supplying stablecoins, get yield on your yield. If you're supplying stablecoins, take a look at Kyber's new raid maker, liquidity mining program. There's a link in the show notes below where you can find out how to get some extra KNC and some extra matic tokens if you are bullish on those particular two assets, guys, 25.
00:02:22.572 - 00:02:28.582, Speaker A: Million in rewards over the next three months. Not a small amount. So check that out. Make sure you check that out. All right, David, you ready to get to markets?
00:02:28.646 - 00:02:29.098, Speaker B: Let's do it.
00:02:29.104 - 00:02:34.110, Speaker A: Ryan, let's talk bitcoin first. What's going on with bitcoin price since last week?
00:02:34.180 - 00:02:48.094, Speaker B: Bitcoin started the week at $34,000, dropped all the way down to $30,000, jumped up to 36 and a half. Currently at the level of $33.3 thousand. That's what happened with bitcoin last week.
00:02:48.212 - 00:02:51.102, Speaker A: Is this crab season? It's just a little back and forth, sideways.
00:02:51.166 - 00:02:59.330, Speaker B: Feels like crab season. Yeah, we go up a little bit, people get bullish. We go down a little bit, people get bearish. At the end of the week, we're at the same level. We started with. Crab season.
00:02:59.490 - 00:03:09.590, Speaker A: Crab season, crab summer. Okay, what about Eth? Same story. Dude, these charts look similar. Actually, that's because it's the same chart. Never mind. I have bitcoin price twice.
00:03:09.930 - 00:03:31.802, Speaker B: This story is going to be pretty much the same. Ether started the week at $2,000, fell down to the low, low price of $1,700, spooked some people, and then it jumped to $2,300. Got people excited again. Now it's at $2,100. And then once again started or ended the week how we started it roughly at the same price. Crab season. Yo.
00:03:31.946 - 00:03:38.706, Speaker A: Let's see if we're seeing any story in the ETh bitcoin ratio. What's this ratio showing? Are we up or down on the week?
00:03:38.808 - 00:04:07.180, Speaker B: We are up on the week. We tapped a new local low of 00:55 but ether seems to really be allergic to anything below that. And so we jumped from 00:55 to almost zero, 66. So almost up 10% versus bitcoin on the week. I tweeted out there was a day where ether really jumped up versus bitcoin. I think it was like two days ago. And I tweeted out eth BTC up 8%.
00:04:07.180 - 00:04:14.640, Speaker B: Resume flipping talk. And clearly that tweet had product market fit because it got over like 8700 likes in like a day and a half.
00:04:15.010 - 00:04:18.414, Speaker A: Have you seen some flipping talk yet, though? I haven't seen as much.
00:04:18.532 - 00:04:21.534, Speaker B: I told people to resume it, so I guess we'll see.
00:04:21.652 - 00:04:59.782, Speaker A: Okay, so now after the roll up, guys, you can resume flipping talk. You know what? I want to take some credit for this tweet, David, because I said this in December 2020, this may be hard for some of you to hear, but ETH will outperform bitcoin again in 2021. Quote me, I said, I threw that out there, David. And you know what? At the time, it was really bitcoin maximalism season, very much like bitcoin was just like wrecking everything else. And here we are, six month in, bitcoin is up 16%. Year to date, ETH is up 188%. Feeling good about this prediction.
00:04:59.846 - 00:05:16.642, Speaker B: This was right after DFI season, right after everyone was bearish on ether, because all the DFI tokens mooned and ether just lagged behind. And then you tweeted this, and then it was like, oh, yeah, ether took the reins for the next, like, six months. But, Ryan, question to you. Do you think, is it going to happen again? What about them for the next six months?
00:05:16.696 - 00:05:43.820, Speaker A: Like, you mean the next six months will outperform? I want to say yes, but I'm not putting my full weight into that prediction, David. Where I'm putting my full weight is, I think by end of the year, if you look year to date, ETH will still have outperformed bitcoin. I feel really comfortable with that prediction. I'm not sure what the next six months will bring. I still feel like it's probably true. Although, look at this, man. ETH is already up 188%, whereas bitcoin is up 16%.
00:05:43.820 - 00:05:54.154, Speaker A: It just has to kind of hold that and the prediction comes true. So I'm being sort of conservative. I think it'll happen, but I'm not too sure. We'll see what that ratio does.
00:05:54.272 - 00:06:14.180, Speaker B: Granted, Bitcoiner said very similar things about bitcoin versus ether throughout 2019 and 2020 because bitcoin really outperformed ether. And really it was just kind of signals like, well, maybe I should rotate then. Because if you sold bitcoin for ether while bitcoiners were talking about how bitcoin has outperformed, that was the right move.
00:06:15.030 - 00:06:34.342, Speaker A: Or just don't worry about it and hold both. That's a secret. Okay, let's talk about DFI pulse. What's going on? With total locked value in DFI, we're at 52 billion, down from the highs. Still haven't hit that. Like, that 100 billion mark seems kind of far away at this point. But what's happening here? We're just crabing.
00:06:34.406 - 00:06:44.750, Speaker B: We're just crabbing. Keeping the head above $50 billion locked in DFI Ave staying around 15% dominance. Not really too much churn going on right now, I would say.
00:06:44.900 - 00:06:53.354, Speaker A: All right, how about DPI this is our index of defi tokens. Looks like that's kind of also flat on the week ish shocker.
00:06:53.482 - 00:06:56.610, Speaker B: Crab season. How many times are we going to say it in the market section?
00:06:57.590 - 00:07:06.550, Speaker A: Not another time. Let's talk about the DPI index to ether. So this is a different seasonal benchmark. Oh, man. We're below 13%.
00:07:06.620 - 00:07:27.226, Speaker B: David, we are below zero. Yet I am still feeling good about the DPI bottom. It's still approximate to zero point 13. I didn't get the specific number, but I'm feeling good in the ballpark, it being the bottom. And I remember when we had ledger on the state of the nation. Fantastic episode. You should go watch it.
00:07:27.226 - 00:07:54.258, Speaker B: He talked about how the zero could be, like, a good entrance and it might dip below it and then kind of zoom back up for hopefully a DPI bull market. Maybe. But I'm still feeling good about the bottom. The zero point 13 wasn't the perfect call, but if this is actually the bottom, the zero will be great entrance. If, of course, it doesn't go any lower. But I guess I'm just kind of, like, biting my own tail here.
00:07:54.424 - 00:07:59.734, Speaker A: Guys, we know that's important to David, so buy some DFI tokens and support David's cause. He doesn't want to miss that one.
00:07:59.772 - 00:08:01.430, Speaker B: Please. I'm buying DPi.
00:08:02.650 - 00:08:15.418, Speaker A: What's this? This is l two beat. I know you guys looked at this last week, but this feels like the DFI pulse of L2. It's like total locked value in Ethereum's L2 platforms. What is this showing us?
00:08:15.504 - 00:08:56.722, Speaker B: Right, so just like DFI pulse, it shows you all the value that is deposited into all these various L2s. There is $322,000,000 in l two s. Last week, it was 340 something million dollars. So down on the week. But this is something that we are going to track moving forward. This is very reminiscent to very early DFI pulse pages, where when we were initially looking at the value locked in DFI, we were looking at the tens and maybe even the hundreds of millions of dollars, whereas now we're looking at the billions of dollars. And so I'm pretty sure this story is going to be one to follow, which is why we're going to come back to l two beat frequently just to track the growth of L2 on Ethereum.
00:08:56.866 - 00:09:02.218, Speaker A: It's kind of cool that it's pure L2. It doesn't include polygon, for example.
00:09:02.304 - 00:09:05.306, Speaker B: If it did, it would just, like, drown out literally everything.
00:09:05.408 - 00:09:08.982, Speaker A: Oh, my God. Polygon's got many billions now billions and billions.
00:09:09.046 - 00:09:19.278, Speaker B: Yeah, which is why we know that this is coming, right, like optimism and arbitram going to open up in July. That's really where this game is going to start going.
00:09:19.444 - 00:09:26.578, Speaker A: All right, guys, we are going to be back with the hot releases for the week, but before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:09:26.744 - 00:10:18.770, Speaker B: Balancer is a powerful platform for flexible, automated market makers. Typical amms just have two tokens inside of one liquidity pool, which can lead to fractured liquidity across the many pairs in DeFi. With Balancer, you can access the full power of multiple tokens inside of one single amm, which unlocks an entirely new playing field of possibility. This makes balancer an awesome building block for so many different use cases. Balancer pools can make asset indices, but instead of paying fees to portfolio managers, Balancer lets you collect the fees from traders who use your portfolio for liquidity. Additionally, balancer smart pools can be programmed to have properties that change according to predetermined rules, such as changing the swap fee based on market conditions or even liquidity bootstrapping pools, which can help you launch and distribute your token with day one liquidity. At bankless, we use a liquidity bootstrapping pool to sell our bap t shirts to much success.
00:10:18.770 - 00:11:23.522, Speaker B: Balancer V two brings powerful new features that makes your money work even harder for you. In V two, idle tokens are capable of generating yield in DFI without sacrificing liquidity in the pool using Balancer's asset managers Balancer's vault architecture lets you trade between balancer pools at a fraction of the cost versus trading on other platforms. Balancer's mission is to become the primary source of liquidity in Defi by providing the most flexible and powerful platform for asset management and decentralized exchange. Dive into the balancer pools at app Balancer Fi the Aave protocol is a decentralized liquidity protocol on Ethereum, which allows users to supply and borrow certain crypto assets. Ave version two has a ton of cool features that makes using the Ave protocol even more powerful. With Ave, you can leverage the full power of DFI money, Legos, yield and composability all in one application. On Ave, there are a ton of assets that you can supply to the protocol in order to gain yield, and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol.
00:11:23.522 - 00:12:02.114, Speaker B: If you have supplied collateral here, you can see me borrowing 200 USDC against my portfolio of a number of different DFI tokens. In east, I'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option. But I could choose the stable interest rate option if I wanted to lock in that interest rate in permanently. V two also features the ability for users to swap collateral without having to withdraw their assets, trade them on uniswap, and then deposit them back into Ave with Ave. Users can do this in one seamless transaction, saving you time and gas costs. Check out the power of Ave@ave.com. That's aave.com.
00:12:02.232 - 00:12:22.822, Speaker A: All right, guys, we are back with releases. David, we got to start here. Compound is doing some cool things. They launched the compound treasury, which it seems like provides institutions the ability to earn 4% APR. That's like 30 x what you receive in a traditional savings account. So not insignificant. I think the difference is they're offering this to a different audience.
00:12:22.822 - 00:12:27.946, Speaker A: It's not the Defi natives and crypto natives, it's institutions. Any thoughts on this?
00:12:28.048 - 00:12:38.622, Speaker B: Yeah, these feel like the base hair follicles of the Defi mullet. This is where the Defi mullet grows out of. There's a super weird metaphor for you, but, yeah.
00:12:38.676 - 00:12:39.038, Speaker A: Beautiful.
00:12:39.124 - 00:12:53.806, Speaker B: Yeah. This feels like a compound. Just advertising. Hey, just use us for your yield, figure out how to attract capital. That's your guys'problem. But come to us for yield, and we'll solve that yield problem for you. So, compound opening up surface area for the Defi mullet.
00:12:53.838 - 00:12:57.490, Speaker A: More heroic, honest defi mullet, David. Sure. Check this out, man.
00:12:57.560 - 00:13:01.430, Speaker B: Current already. You know what current is now? I do, yeah.
00:13:01.580 - 00:13:07.222, Speaker A: They say they're not a bank, but they kind of are a bank. Right? They've got, like, bank connectivity. But look at this.
00:13:07.276 - 00:13:08.498, Speaker B: Improvement upon a bank.
00:13:08.594 - 00:13:21.818, Speaker A: Sure. Yeah, but look at this. We're excited to work with compound treasury to be able to offer our members access to the protocol's interest rate through a simple, unified experience. D five mullet fintech on the front, compound on the back. That's really cool to see a single.
00:13:21.904 - 00:13:29.194, Speaker B: Solid hair growing out of current. Out of compounds hair follicles. All right, how long should I take this metaphor for keep going all episode?
00:13:29.242 - 00:13:31.182, Speaker A: I'm really digging this. I'm really digging this.
00:13:31.236 - 00:13:33.780, Speaker B: Okay, 10,000 word article coming in.
00:13:35.510 - 00:13:41.314, Speaker A: The dissection of the mullet. All right. Polygon launches. Avail. What is avail, David? Yeah.
00:13:41.352 - 00:14:12.746, Speaker B: Avail is a data availability layer on polygon. So for those that are familiar with the project of lazy Ledger, this is a similar data availability structure for the polygon L2. So if you're into the world of cryptography and blockchain and consensus, you kind of know what I'm talking about. If you're not, then you're probably really confused, which is actually kind of closer to where I am. But basically, there's this data ability problem, and there's a number of different ways to solve it. And avail is trying to solve it. For the polygon ecosystem, roll ups have.
00:14:12.768 - 00:14:35.422, Speaker A: This limitation, too, right? Storing data on chain is one of their limitations. So this is really an effort to further scale l two s and roll ups by offering a data availability layer on top of Ethereum. I haven't dug into the details. I'm sure this means even more to some of our listeners, but this is another scalability tech being based on Ethereum, that's going to really propel the roll up roadmap, which is super cool, super exciting.
00:14:35.486 - 00:14:45.106, Speaker B: And this is one of the bullcases for polygon, is that any chain that Nick can and needs to be built will be built. And so that's kind of why matic token is so highly valued, at least in my opinion.
00:14:45.138 - 00:15:10.030, Speaker A: It's kind of cool, too. I think it's bullish for polygon, too. It's like they're not stopping with just chain, right? And I know they've said they're coming out with roll ups and ZK roll up, like tech and that sort of thing, but also a whole data availability solution. I was not expecting that. It's kind of cool. All right, cream finance announcing integration with polygon, too. So what is cream? They're deploying on polygon, another protocol part of the theme here.
00:15:10.030 - 00:15:11.646, Speaker A: But what are they?
00:15:11.748 - 00:15:26.098, Speaker B: Cream is a money market, just like compound and aave I put them on. There's a different risk spectrum that every single money market really likes to take on. Compound is kind of known as the conservative risk off money market. That's why they have such few assets on there.
00:15:26.264 - 00:15:27.806, Speaker A: That's why they can do the Defi mullet.
00:15:27.838 - 00:15:43.014, Speaker B: That's why they can do the defi mullet. Yep. Protocol sync thesis Ave is kind of more in the liberal camp of risk, but still not. Still pretty good. Right in the middle ground. Cream is like, yeah, let's open up. Open up the floodgates of all the assets.
00:15:43.014 - 00:15:52.618, Speaker B: Let's list all the assets. A little bit more risky, but to some degree, you can only get liquidity on many different assets using cream. And now cream is on polygon.
00:15:52.794 - 00:16:11.970, Speaker A: There you go. Very cool. All right, let's talk about perpetual protocol. So they have launched a cross margin trading limit order multilateral protocol. This is basically on arbitrum that they're launching as well. It's called Curie. What's special about this data?
00:16:12.040 - 00:16:46.640, Speaker B: There's just a number of different use cases for financial activity that really can only work on L2. And perpetual swaps is definitely one of them. Just high frequency trading or just people that want to be really active with their trades and anyone who's day trading really, it works a lot better on L2. So perpetual protocol. I'm actually doing a meet the nation with them. I'm recording with them today, so that will probably be out sometime early next week if you guys want a deeper dive into perpetual protocol. But overall, it's just a suite of trading activities and now it can be done on L2.
00:16:47.490 - 00:17:01.230, Speaker A: Speaking of Meet the nations, actually I think the state of the nation we had element protocol on not too long ago. Their founder was on will, and now it looks like they have finally deployed to Mainnet, which is super exciting. What is element protocol, David? What's the TLDR?
00:17:01.310 - 00:17:49.406, Speaker B: Yeah, element finance takes one asset and splits it into two. And so you have the principal asset and the yield asset and allows people to kind of break apart the different properties of a single asset and allows people to express their opinions about what they want in more granular ways. Do you want really the yield side of an asset or do you want the principal side of an asset and allows you to express your financial opinions about the future in different ways? Go check out the state of the nation for more details. One of the really exciting things about element is the team. A bunch of Ethereum ogs, both on the team itself as well as the advisors. Just core Ethereum consensus, like Ethereum one builders, along with just Ethereum l, two advisors as well. Eric Connor is on the advisor.
00:17:49.406 - 00:17:53.860, Speaker B: Danny Ryan is an Advisor. So just an all star team with an all star product.
00:17:54.230 - 00:18:18.540, Speaker A: Very cool. All right, we also have more yield happening this time on Coinbase. So this is super interesting to me. Coinbase is now going to start offering 4% APy on USDC coin inside of Coinbase. So previously I think they have sort of a savings light type product. But if you have USDC on Coinbase, it offers like something like zero point 15%.
00:18:20.750 - 00:18:22.298, Speaker B: When the last idea it was.
00:18:22.384 - 00:18:47.390, Speaker A: At one time, but then it dropped all the way back down. So it's more like a bank savings rate a little bit higher, but not much. This is something different. This is where Coinbase is actually lending out your USDC, similar to how a blockfly might lend it out. And it's providing that higher Apy that 4% rate. So kind of interesting. It's unclear where they're getting the interest.
00:18:47.390 - 00:18:50.870, Speaker A: It's kind of like blockfly. It's sort of like a black box, David.
00:18:51.290 - 00:18:59.446, Speaker B: It's a little bit coincidental that you get 4% on Coinbase and compound gives you 4% with their feature, I was.
00:18:59.468 - 00:19:21.050, Speaker A: Going to say this same week. Kind of interesting. I mean, they could get 4% from compound, right? That would be protocol sync thesis. Absolutely. But anyway, interesting that they are offering this. Certainly competing with the block fives of the world, maybe doing some protocol sync, getting into compound. We're not sure, but we're actually going to have Robert Leshner on state of the nation on Monday.
00:19:21.050 - 00:19:32.020, Speaker A: So he's been very involved. He's a founder of the compound protocol. To talk about compound treasury. Without Robert, it wouldn't have happened.
00:19:32.710 - 00:19:35.630, Speaker B: Very involved, very active contributor.
00:19:35.790 - 00:19:52.086, Speaker A: Yeah, I may have downplayed that a little bit. He does some work for compound. Kind of a big deal there. Anyway, he's going to tell us, hopefully, maybe about. Maybe I'll have comments on this coinbase 4% APY, because I know Coinbase and compound have been close in the past, too. So there you go. Sort of interesting.
00:19:52.086 - 00:20:09.200, Speaker A: What's going on here, David, we got to end releases with this. We have a couple of raises to talk about, but a new crypto comedy show has been released. Dude, I watched it. It was fantastic. I love not having to do the work to produce it, by the way.
00:20:10.530 - 00:20:11.870, Speaker B: I could just enjoy it.
00:20:11.940 - 00:20:13.982, Speaker A: So what is this? What'd you guys put out there?
00:20:14.036 - 00:20:42.666, Speaker B: Yeah, this is top signal, the newest show out of the bankless ecosystem, with bankless's newest anchor, newest co host, Michael Wong, one of my, actually the person that hired me for my first crypto job ever. And so we go way back. It was an IcO advisory company back in 2018. And that actually kind of led into our first gag that we did where we presented the three guests. It was DFI dad, Kevin Awakey, and Anthony Suzano. We presented them with two icos. One of them was real, one of them was fake, and they had to pick the real or the fake one.
00:20:42.666 - 00:21:07.518, Speaker B: All three of them got it right. So it sounds like we need to get more creative on our icos. But we also did crypto Twitter fantasy draft. And so each person had to draft their favorite anon crypto Twitter personalities. And so we got to kind of jostle for who wants to pick what crypto anon and then pitch our team and how our team is better than the rest. And we did some around the horn. Just quick takes on different topics.
00:21:07.518 - 00:21:28.226, Speaker B: It was super fun. The through line or kind of the tagline for top signal is that it is in a superposition of a complete psyops or the best alpha you've ever seen or just a normal factual statement. It could be any of those three. We don't know because we don't do any fact checking on top signal.
00:21:28.418 - 00:21:34.870, Speaker A: It's just kind of fun. And I don't know what you guys have in store for the future, but maybe some rap battles. That's a rumor.
00:21:34.950 - 00:21:42.874, Speaker B: Hayden Adams and Carl for guys. We want you guys as a rap battle duo on top signal. It's going to happen at some point in time.
00:21:43.072 - 00:21:50.270, Speaker A: That would be amazing. It's just a fun show. I can't wait for the next one. It sounds like there's no real schedule. When's the next one going to be, David?
00:21:51.090 - 00:22:06.226, Speaker B: As soon as we corral the guests and get them onto the show, it's going to be different every single time. We have Alexandra Bates, the chess streamer, and she's going to come on with her co host because she's actually also producing Ethereum content as well. And I'm going to try and find the four best chess players, try to.
00:22:06.248 - 00:22:07.022, Speaker A: Beat them in chess.
00:22:07.086 - 00:22:12.230, Speaker B: Yeah, we're going to try and four v two them and see how far we can get. But overall, it's just going to be a fun time.
00:22:12.380 - 00:22:23.798, Speaker A: That's awesome. All right, guys, let's switch to some of the raises really quick. So one is Nansen. So Nansen is kind of like a blockchain data analytics provider.
00:22:23.894 - 00:22:26.314, Speaker B: They are data consumer, right? Yeah.
00:22:26.352 - 00:22:36.110, Speaker A: And they provide a lot of Ethereum data. So they just received a funding from a 16 z, $12 million. Not an insignificant amount. Any other takes on this?
00:22:36.180 - 00:22:54.706, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I think this is really important infrastructure for just people who want to view the chain for data. And the Ethereum blockchain has an insane amount of data, and so you need systems to parse and consume and digest that data. That's what Nansen does. And so this is going to just be really important infrastructure moving forward.
00:22:54.888 - 00:23:22.778, Speaker A: Also with L2s, man, all this data needs to be digested and consumed. So super important there. Also, the tracer Dow closed $4.5 million in a raise. Some pretty solid vcs were behind this. So one is framework ventures, whom we've had in the podcast, but also some angels like Mariano Conti were part of this. And what is this protocol? It seems like it's perpetuals again.
00:23:22.778 - 00:23:33.930, Speaker A: So it's another story. And they're deploying on arbitrum as well. So it's another L2, first deployment, not main chain, which is kind of interesting. We're seeing that trend. Anything else to add about tracer Dow, David?
00:23:34.010 - 00:24:02.430, Speaker B: Yeah, the Dow tagline makes me think that it doesn't at all stop with perpetuals. I think it's going to be kind of something similar to a DXDao, where they're just making a suite of financial services that's owned and operated by the DAO. And those suite of financial services makes the DaO money. And there's really positive statements by basically everyone involved. Mariano Conti is somebody I definitely trust for signal. So when he says that he's excited about something, I pay attention. So tracer Dao.
00:24:02.430 - 00:24:04.122, Speaker B: I'm going to be looking at you guys.
00:24:04.256 - 00:24:21.738, Speaker A: Mariana Conti, the maker mafia. Maybe that's a thing now. All right, David, let's talk news man. First is some ethereum stuff. This deserves our attention. A defi education fund was proposed in Uniswap governance. Of course, we've talked about before, Uniswap has an absolutely massive treasury.
00:24:21.738 - 00:24:23.046, Speaker A: It's mostly in uni tokens.
00:24:23.098 - 00:24:25.986, Speaker B: You hear it every single time in the bankless ad.
00:24:26.088 - 00:24:55.334, Speaker A: Millions. Exactly, that's right. But now this is a governance proposal to actually create a Defi education fund in quotes. This is a nonprofit, so a 501 C four nonprofit based in the US, and it's trying to fund all of the following. Policymaker education. Oh, interesting lobby type stuff. Thought leadership and research, legal fire, power messaging, grassroots advocacy and best practices.
00:24:55.334 - 00:25:02.234, Speaker A: It has people like Jake Chervinsky on, has people in the Defi space as well.
00:25:02.352 - 00:25:04.270, Speaker B: A lot of Dao experts here as well.
00:25:04.340 - 00:25:22.962, Speaker A: A lot of Dao experts, a lot of legal minds in. This is. I feel like, david, this is Defi starting to flex this muscle and saying, hey, we want a voice in legislation and we want to expand into hearts and minds, and we have the money and funds to do that. So we're going to go deploy them. What are your thoughts here?
00:25:23.016 - 00:25:43.130, Speaker B: Yeah, they are asking for 1 million uni tokens, which is a lot. That is $18 million, depending on the state of the market. Let me go check the price of Uni right now. $17.7 per unitoken. So $17.7 million at the time of recording is what they are requesting, which is a large amount of money.
00:25:43.130 - 00:26:14.674, Speaker B: But also, like, what the hell is the treasury fork if you're not going to open up the purse strings? Right. And so these are absolutely the right people to ask for this amount of money. And so I'm kind of pretty excited to see what they can get done with this. There is definitely some opportunities available for people to go and capture this. So kind of think, I'm pretty sure think of this as its own micro uni grants. Right. They are taking uniswap money, and then they are going to also give out grants with it.
00:26:14.674 - 00:26:49.834, Speaker B: So it's a grant giving grant, and they have definitely goals and objectives that they want to reach. And there's a decent amount of things that the listener of this show could go and produce for money. And so they are looking for my eyes. Go to the thought leadership and research post where they say, we need more written and video content explaining DeFi and its benefits in a medium that positively impacts the public perception of defi. Yo, like Ryan, you and I can do that. And so we might be going after this bankless dao. I challenge you guys to go after this bankless listeners.
00:26:49.834 - 00:26:56.170, Speaker B: I also challenge you guys to go after this money. This money is for you, so long as you can produce what these guys want you to produce.
00:26:56.330 - 00:27:05.666, Speaker A: Yeah. And what this really speaks to is, I think DeFi is now fighting for hearts and minds, and it's deploying capital to fight for hearts and minds. And this is not just like going.
00:27:05.688 - 00:27:07.486, Speaker B: On the offensive narrative.
00:27:07.678 - 00:27:28.986, Speaker A: Exactly. Going on the offensive, but also like regulatory, which is really good to hear because guess what? Banks have this kind of regulatory firepower. Even crypto banks have it. We're going to talk about some FTX news. They're deploying capital, know all sorts of ways. So DeFi needs a voice in our legislative halls, and I think this is a step towards that. So kind of cool, David, let's talk about this.
00:27:28.986 - 00:28:16.458, Speaker A: So Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, put out a post called embracing decentralization at Coinbase. And the headline here is basically talking about Coinbase creating kind of an Apple App Store experience, right? But treating DeFi protocols as first class citizens. So DeFi protocols being kind of the apps, and Coinbase custody being sort of the custodian, solutions being sort of the user, I guess, UI and the bridge to all of these apps. Kind of cool, David, because I think this is the protocol sync thesis in action. Coinbase is recognizing, hey, we don't have to build all of the apps. We don't even have to have maybe the most liquid trading markets in the world. We could just provide an interface to uniswap and charge a fee on top of that.
00:28:16.458 - 00:28:32.798, Speaker A: This, to me, is the future of banks. Now, we'll have to see how they enact this, but I do think it's going to be good for DeFi protocols. Overall, not everybody is ready to hold their own private keys. They need some handholding, at least at first, to get into this space. Any thoughts here?
00:28:32.884 - 00:29:03.994, Speaker B: Yeah, they really advertise the crypto App Store, which gives me flashbacks to 2017 and 2018, where people were like, oh, yeah, we used to have apps in the traditional App Stores, Google iOS. Now we have these D apps. And so we're going to fundraise $100 million to build the D App Store, not realizing that dapps don't actually exist as something that you can download. Like, imagine going to your phone and downloading uniswap. That's like a nonsensical thing to do. But that was, like, the vision back in 2017. But now this can make a little bit more sense.
00:29:03.994 - 00:29:31.998, Speaker B: Now, I think if people are. People are looking for familiarity when they come into crypto, they are straight up looking for the dFI tab in their coinbase wallet, or, like, where's all the dFI things? And so maybe it's actually a really power play to put all of DFI into one single UI and really make that available as a consumer in the ways that they are used to when it comes to the App Store. So they can literally tap on Uniswap and then they open up. Uniswap.
00:29:32.174 - 00:29:55.562, Speaker A: Yeah. I was never a fan of the 2017 Dap thing. Like, we're creating an App Store, and that was just such a, because it was very unfocused. But I am a fan of this because I think money apps are the thing that is the thing that we are producing in crypto. It's a better banking system, a better financial system for the world. And so this seems much more focused. Remember, the dapps of yesteryear could be anything.
00:29:55.562 - 00:30:32.102, Speaker A: Like, it could be like a decentralized social media thing, or it could be, like, all of these weird things that no one was actually using. But, like, hey, if I can get 4% on my USDC, on my stablecoin by using an app through Coinbase, I don't have to figure out dFI then. Cool. Sign me up. So, Dave, let's talk about this Kane's glorious return. So, Kane of the synthetics product he co founded that he has now returned to save the project. What's going on here? I didn't know synthetics needed saving.
00:30:32.102 - 00:30:33.414, Speaker A: Was it in trouble? Yeah.
00:30:33.452 - 00:31:13.060, Speaker B: So Kane likes to joke how he had taken a step back from the benevolent dictator to kind of just the guy that writes blogs over at synthetics. Because to some degree he is the Vitalik of Ethereum for synthetics. He is the satoshi for bitcoin for synthetics. And if we like decentralized apps, we want our applications to have leaders. But there's a friction there because to some degree, leaders are leaders for a reason. And it sounds like after Kane stepped away, there was a bit of an unfilled power vacuum that never really got filled by the DAO. And so it sounds like Kane's coming back in to really just kind of be that guide that synthetics needs.
00:31:13.060 - 00:31:29.110, Speaker B: Dowing is hard. And so maybe we do still need to come to terms with the fact that while dows are cool, they do need maybe some one single person kind of calling the shots until these things really grow out and mature.
00:31:29.690 - 00:31:57.346, Speaker A: Yeah, it seems like it's going to oscillate back and forth between that and the Dow structure where you decentralize and then you maybe do it too much and you need to create some more structure and then maybe do that too much and you kind of eb and flow until you get the exact combination. Maybe that's how this is working. It seems like it's the next ebb and flow of synthetics though. David, let's talk nft stuff, man. We got to start here. Axie Infinity is a gaming platform is absolutely booming. And I was amazed when I saw this.
00:31:57.346 - 00:32:17.986, Speaker A: So this is William Pester, who writes the bankless metaversal newsletter. He just put this post out today. Look at this, dude. Last 30 days, wow. Axi Infinity has provided $11 million to its players. Wow. That means you're playing axe and you're making money while you're playing video games.
00:32:17.986 - 00:32:22.540, Speaker A: My God. That was my dream as a twelve year old boy growing up, like here.
00:32:22.990 - 00:32:26.634, Speaker B: I can literally, like, there's a generation too late, Ryan. Right?
00:32:26.672 - 00:32:43.162, Speaker A: I know, man. I can play video games for a living and not just stream it like the Twitch streamers these days. But the items I'm mining and the skills I have in this game, these are real items with real world power. It's like, man, it's. All my childhood fantasies are like, happening now. David.
00:32:43.226 - 00:32:51.362, Speaker B: Dude, again, imagine if Diablo, if you could have made money from Diablo two. Imagine how much money, like, a bail run would have gotten you.
00:32:51.496 - 00:32:53.794, Speaker A: Oh, my God. Imagine how addicted I would be, though.
00:32:53.832 - 00:33:12.774, Speaker B: Yeah, right? Yeah. Maybe bankless wouldn't have been existed. You'd still be playing. It's crazy that Axio Infinity is making a substantial amount of more money, again, at least in the last 30 days. 30 days. Not a short amount of time than maker Dow. Axio Infinity pulled in $11 million in revenue versus maker Dow's $8.4
00:33:12.774 - 00:33:22.542, Speaker B: million. I'm not sure if that 11 million revenue for Axio Infinity goes to the axe team or if that's more like going to the players who are playing. I think it's going.
00:33:22.596 - 00:33:23.834, Speaker A: My understanding it's going to the players.
00:33:23.882 - 00:33:25.082, Speaker B: I think it's going to the players.
00:33:25.226 - 00:33:38.322, Speaker A: You earn these things called, like, love potions, and there's a market for love potions, and then you can sell the love potions that you're earning on uniswap for money. So this is like, again, the intersection of gaming, nfts and defi all mashed together.
00:33:38.376 - 00:34:00.474, Speaker B: Totally. And this is actually not the first time that we've seen this story of people generating more income than their minimum wage in their home country. We saw this with Gaza and chain. There was a story of some brazilian player who was making like two to three times the minimum wage just playing gaze and chain and collecting scarce assets. I think this is the signs of things to come.
00:34:00.672 - 00:34:18.270, Speaker A: Yeah, look at this. Axie infinity. This is Linda talking about Axie Infinity. Players in the Philippines earning living wage through this. Really cool how global this is as well. All right, David, on the NFT subject, Twitter is dropping its own nfts on rarible. That seems like a big deal.
00:34:18.270 - 00:34:19.198, Speaker A: What's going on?
00:34:19.284 - 00:34:40.486, Speaker B: Yeah. Jack Dorsey is on one side of things telling us that lightning network is coming to Twitter, yet Twitter seems to be coming to rarible to issue nfts first. That's an interesting little juxtaposition right there. I don't know why these nfts are valuable. I don't really think they're just testing. It seems like. Yeah, like a test.
00:34:40.486 - 00:34:55.740, Speaker B: These aren't historical Twitter moments. It's not like Jack's tweet where he actually did sell that. These are kind of just random little Twitter creative drawings. So it's kind of the fact that the verified Twitter account is selling these things. That's really the big thing. It's not necessarily nfts themselves.
00:34:56.110 - 00:35:15.178, Speaker A: Back to your comment about Dorsey, though. Somebody asked him or somebody said this. I've talked shit about Jack being a maxi in the past, a bitcoin maxi, that is. But ever since following somebody, he's looking into it more. Only a matter of time before he buys into Eth. Jack Dorsey buying eth. And then Jack Dorsey comes in this thread.
00:35:15.178 - 00:35:30.178, Speaker A: He was tagged on. And no, no, he is not buying Eth. And I love this follow up. I think this is the follow up chain link. God says, how'd you pay the gas fees to mint these nfts then, Jack? Somebody must have bought Eth. Somebody? Twitter.
00:35:30.274 - 00:35:33.110, Speaker B: Somebody is buying eth. Either it's Jack or Twitter itself.
00:35:33.260 - 00:35:35.030, Speaker A: Is this cognitive dissonance?
00:35:36.170 - 00:35:38.470, Speaker B: Just capitulate, Jack. It's okay.
00:35:38.620 - 00:35:41.320, Speaker A: Just come on, bankless. Let's have a talk about it.
00:35:41.690 - 00:35:42.554, Speaker B: We'll be really nice.
00:35:42.592 - 00:35:59.086, Speaker A: There can be more than one coin. There can be more than one store value. It's possible. Okay. A couple more things going on in NFT world. The first is Tim Berners Lee has sold an NFT. This guy was one of the main people behind the Internet that we know and love today.
00:35:59.086 - 00:36:11.266, Speaker A: He sold some original code in NFT form for 5.4 million. This is another piece of crypto culture, excuse me, Internet culture getting preserved and valued as an NFT. Any thoughts here?
00:36:11.368 - 00:36:46.030, Speaker B: Yeah, I really think this is one of the core legitimate purposes behind nfTs, not people just like spinning up some 3d animations and graphics and selling in that. That's cool, too. But NFts are art, and art is partly historical. And if you want to own a piece of history, that's kind of the role that art serves. And if you want to own a piece of Internet history, that's products market fit for nfts. And so this going for $5.4 million, that's actually kind of where I see nfTs, kind of like planting a flag and saying, this is what we are for.
00:36:46.030 - 00:37:08.562, Speaker B: There's many other things. There was an NFT mania that happened, but the high priced one of ones of deep Internet culture that happened before NFTs were even a thing. I think that kind of phenomenon is here to stay. So congratulations for Tim Berners Lee created something open sourced for free and then got $5.4 million like 30 years later.
00:37:08.696 - 00:37:11.218, Speaker A: Do we know who bought it? Did pleaserdao get it or pleaser?
00:37:11.234 - 00:37:14.022, Speaker B: Dow did not buy it. I think they voted against buying it.
00:37:14.156 - 00:37:15.766, Speaker A: Oh, interesting. Well, you know what?
00:37:15.788 - 00:37:17.110, Speaker B: It's unknown buyers.
00:37:17.530 - 00:37:25.574, Speaker A: Every time this happens though, David, it makes CNN. And that in itself is cool. That's a great thing for crypto.
00:37:25.622 - 00:37:29.206, Speaker B: All right, let's talk. Issued some NFTs last week. Not apparently.
00:37:29.238 - 00:37:29.530, Speaker A: What?
00:37:29.600 - 00:37:34.278, Speaker B: Fun fact. Yeah, we don't have to go into it because they were a bunch of bs, but they're also in the NFT game.
00:37:34.464 - 00:37:49.406, Speaker A: All right. Can't not be in that NFT game. I guess even if you're Jay Z, this is crazy, dude. This is defi dad. Tweet. Never thought I'd see Jay Z with a crypto punk in his profile. So Jay Z bought a crypto punk and turned his profile into a punk.
00:37:49.438 - 00:38:03.590, Speaker B: Is that right? We don't know the first part, but we don't know if he actually bought the crypto punk. But yes, his avatar is a crypto punk. It would be weird, it would be a transgression if you didn't own the crypto punk that is your Twitter avatar.
00:38:04.890 - 00:38:07.030, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a hot crypto punk.
00:38:08.010 - 00:38:17.002, Speaker B: Simple features, looks like, know, black eye, funny hair, gold necklace, looks like Jay Z. That's the right crypto punt for him.
00:38:17.136 - 00:38:26.382, Speaker A: So we don't know if Jay Z bought that or somebody on his team bought that, but somebody knows what they're doing with respect to NFT culture and crypto culture to do that.
00:38:26.436 - 00:38:27.502, Speaker B: Good branding, I guess.
00:38:27.636 - 00:38:44.242, Speaker A: Was that because he's minting an NFT? So he minted this NFT and maybe we could talk about it. But he also looks like has Hov Eth, hove as an address. Hove eth. He's got 99 problems, but minting 81. I love that, man. What's going on here?
00:38:44.296 - 00:39:24.398, Speaker B: Yeah, so he minted an NFT contract. And if you are paying attention to the ceremonious event of minting a token, people like to put in ASIC art into their token contract just because it's free space. Why not? And so they put in this big AsiC art, Jay Z, into the token contract that they minted for whatever this NFT that Jay Z is issuing. I don't think that Jay Z is knowledgeable about cryptopunks or ASIC art in token minting contracts himself. I think that he hired a very well informed, just like assistant or somebody to help guide or advisor, and that advisor is doing a great job. So, Jay Z, nice pick on your advisor, bro.
00:39:24.564 - 00:39:48.262, Speaker A: It looks like somebody from the Ethereum community got him hove eth, too, which is really cool. All right, so this is the actual auction, so he's releasing this NFT on Sotheby's. So again, mainstream, like, artist rapper, cultural figure meets mainstream art distributor meets crypto nfts. Another pretty big event. I don't know, man. Doesn't seem like nfts are dead to me. It seems like stuff is still happening.
00:39:48.396 - 00:40:03.878, Speaker B: No, I think nfts are just becoming more precise. That's what's going on. The sheer number of nfts being issued is definitely going down. But the nfts that are left behind are going up, up in value, right? Yeah, super cool.
00:40:04.064 - 00:40:07.262, Speaker A: Rumor is Katy Perry, NFT. Next.
00:40:07.316 - 00:40:08.430, Speaker B: Katy Perry, NFT.
00:40:09.170 - 00:40:32.886, Speaker A: All right, it's crazy. California girls. Here we go. Bitcoin stuff. Bitcoin minor migration, man, that's been a big story. So, like, what's happening? Bottom line is all the bitcoin miners are leaving China right now due to oppressive China state regulation, essentially as they're doing that hash rate going down. Of course, this adjusts algorithmically every couple.
00:40:32.908 - 00:40:40.602, Speaker B: Of weeks or so, but the hash rate does not. The bitcoin or the difficulty adjustment to accommodate changes in hash rate.
00:40:40.736 - 00:40:48.822, Speaker A: Right, so what's happening here? Are we just seeing the results of the migration going on in hash rate and difficulty adjustment?
00:40:48.886 - 00:41:24.902, Speaker B: People turning off their Asic units to put them in boxes and ship them elsewhere, anywhere else? I think there's a lot of. That's a really important thing to find out. Each different farm, Texas. Yeah. People are really optimistic that it's coming to America and bitcoiners are really trying to stamp their feet, saying, hey, America is the right place to set up your bitcoin shop. It's good for just the pr of bitcoin if more hash rate is onshore. In America, where bitcoin is largely going to become regulated, so favorable regulations if hash rate moves onshore, people like that.
00:41:24.902 - 00:41:36.298, Speaker B: But also, the other conversation is that China is really dirty, really dirty energy, lots of coal. And so moving anywhere else out of China is positive towards the whole green energy narrative that bitcoin desperately needs.
00:41:36.464 - 00:42:02.850, Speaker A: David, I'm going to skip ahead this one, but this is bitcoin mining firm Terra wolf orders new machines. So $100 million in bitcoin Asics. It seems like they just ordered. Actually, I don't know if this is exclusively. Yeah, it seems like it's exclusively bitcoin Asics. What is going on here? So companies are still investing quite heavily in bitcoin Asics. $100 million here.
00:42:02.850 - 00:42:07.538, Speaker A: How does this link to the bitcoin minor migration story? And what do you think the lens on this is?
00:42:07.624 - 00:42:46.654, Speaker B: Yeah, and this actually isn't the only story of its kind. This week, there's actually been a number of stories going around about just mining firms just allocated, like raising a bunch of money to purchase new asiCs. This is something that as a bitcoin miner, you have to do. You have to always be cycling through asics. But this is the highest number that I saw, 100 million going to purchase Asics. The strategy for bitcoin mining and this is just true for bitcoin mining across the board, is that you buy like $100 million worth of bitcoin ASiCs, and then you are going to mine bitcoin at a discount for the next like three to five years. So that $100 million of Asics turns into somewhere between $200 to $500 million worth of bitcoin.
00:42:46.654 - 00:42:47.794, Speaker B: Over the next three to five years.
00:42:47.832 - 00:42:51.170, Speaker A: You get this kind of fixed costs that you have to amortize. Right?
00:42:51.240 - 00:43:06.726, Speaker B: Exactly. The point that I would like to make is that this $100 million going to purchase Asics, all of that $100 million, and all of those ASICs are going to be deprecated probably by the end of five years. And five years is already kind of long.
00:43:06.908 - 00:43:08.586, Speaker A: By deprecated, you mean you can no.
00:43:08.608 - 00:43:39.534, Speaker B: Longer mine using them, they no longer profitably mine. That's the other problem with Asics, is they can't be repurposed. And so to some degree, that's nice for security, as in there's nothing else for ASICs for the shaft 256 mining algorithm computers to do other than mine bitcoin. And so when you purchase an ASIC, the only thing it can do is mine bitcoin. As soon as it's dead, you can't repurpose it, you can't plug it into a different system. There's only bitcoin. And so three to five years, there's $100 million of ASIC waste.
00:43:39.534 - 00:44:12.394, Speaker B: That happens because these things are just literally trash. To me. This is why people say that proof of work is just proof of stake with extra steps. If you are purchasing $100 million worth of asics, you are locked into mining bitcoin. That's the only thing you can do with your 100 million dollar investment. You are locked into these asics, you are locked into the value of bitcoin and the value of the bitcoin blockchain and the value of BTC. And then you get discounted bitcoins over time for the next three to five years.
00:44:12.394 - 00:44:40.610, Speaker B: But it's not even efficient proof of stake, because you have to keep on spending capital to buy more asics, and the Asics keep on getting burnt and wasted. And so I wanted to bring this up just because this is good anecdotes and good lessons for why proof of stake is what it is. There's the same similar properties to proof of work. It just cuts to the chase, which is that proof of work is just proof of stake with extra steps involved and a lot of waste.
00:44:40.770 - 00:45:02.138, Speaker A: Stake is just tokenized asics. We've said that before. I think it's true here. Two other points I want to make on that, David, is one, we talk about the energy consumption of bitcoin mining, but we don't talk about the hardware energy consumption of bitcoin mining. All of those machines need to be thrown away. And there's a whole energy ESG debate here. They're totally trash after a few years.
00:45:02.138 - 00:45:58.186, Speaker A: But I will say, on the flip side, bitcoiners will say, that's actually an advantage, David, because what it does is it recycles some of the capital, right? So it distributes capital in a way. They'll say that staking asics, if you want to call them that, they don't deprecate. So that establishes a ruling oligarchy, plutocracy in the network that bitcoin doesn't have. I think we've had Justin Drake on that kind of debate. That, and what's interesting about that debate is the actual amount of bitcoin that gets distributed at this point in time from that is super small, relatively small compared to the cost of the system to do that distribution. And then the other thing is, I guess, who's it getting distributed to? It's definitely not getting distributed to the mom and pops because they can't afford $100 million to run asics in a data center. No one's mining out of their homes.
00:45:58.186 - 00:46:04.160, Speaker A: So there is a counterpoint that bitcoiners would say about this, about it being a good thing.
00:46:04.770 - 00:46:08.482, Speaker B: I don't know. I have my counterpoints to those counterpoints. I don't know if we want to keep on going.
00:46:08.536 - 00:46:09.810, Speaker A: Lay them on me real quick.
00:46:09.880 - 00:46:58.130, Speaker B: Okay, so the whole proof of stake, rich get richer thing is like, it's good that ASICs deprecate, because then if you are a mining operation, you keep on having to expend capital to keep up. Interesting take that doesn't mean that proof of stake is the complete opposite, where the rich only get richer. If you are staking and you are a 100 million dollar fund, or you're an individual with just like three ether, you are receiving the same rate of return. Same rate of return. And so, yes, no economies of scale, the stakers are getting richer as a proportion of the overall esupply versus non stakers. But if you want to participate in consensus, the whole reason why proof of stake is so cool is I can do it from my laptop, I can do it from my home, and I have the access to the same rate of return as a gargantuan hedge fund. And so to some degree.
00:46:58.130 - 00:47:31.702, Speaker B: It's not a distribution problem if everyone can access this stake, right? If everyone can access the upside. And that's a really important point to drive home. The other thing that bitcoiners often talk about is how bitcoin is going to be green because it's going to incentivize energy production. And bitcoiners and bitcoin mining operations are actually going to be the source of energy because they are going to be paired with an energy generation facility. And bitcoin miners are actually going to get their energy for free. This is a thought, a theory as to the future of bitcoin miners. This is articulated by bitcoiners.
00:47:31.702 - 00:47:48.514, Speaker B: The problem with that is that once bitcoin miners get their energy for free, then it's the same critique that they were just critiquing proof of stake about where the rich get richer because these miners have zero capital costs because they're getting free energy. And so there's friction, there's tension between these two narratives articulated by bitcoiners that you can only pick one.
00:47:48.712 - 00:48:12.222, Speaker A: While we're on bitcoin, David, let's talk about Kathy Woods. Ark invest. They are planning to create a bitcoin ETF called ArkB. Now, whether they'll be successful, who knows? No one's been successful previously. But this is really interesting. They had been buying grayscale in bulk and they're still doing that. They're buying both grayscale GBDC and the e version of Grayscale.
00:48:12.222 - 00:48:30.238, Speaker A: This is kind of a departure to kind of cut out the grayscale middleman and apply for an ETF directly. Whether they'll be successful or not, who knows? Only the SEC knows. Only Gary Gensler and crew are in control of that. But it is an interesting move, at any rate, and definitely shows bullishness on bitcoin and crypto writ large.
00:48:30.404 - 00:48:39.234, Speaker B: The pile of proposed bitcoin ETFs just continues to grow. I really feel sorry for the SEC because they are really. It's easy.
00:48:39.432 - 00:48:40.578, Speaker A: I have a way out.
00:48:40.664 - 00:48:50.850, Speaker B: The SEC just approve them, all of them. And then if you don't approve all of them, how do you select which ones to not approve?
00:48:51.010 - 00:48:52.774, Speaker A: It's definitely not credibly neutral, right.
00:48:52.812 - 00:49:00.826, Speaker B: It's not a credibly neutral choice. And they've really backed themselves into a corner on this, you know, Kathy Wood, love what you're doing. I really hope that you get your.
00:49:00.848 - 00:49:26.030, Speaker A: Bitcoin ETF and I hope you come on. Bankless announcement coming soon, hopefully. All right, let's talk about this. Conclude bitcoin news. Adults in El Salvador are getting $30 in bitcoin as El Salvador is unveiling details to make crypto a legal tender. We talked about this a couple of episodes ago. It's big news, right? Making bitcoin legal tender in El Salvador is big.
00:49:26.030 - 00:49:47.526, Speaker A: There's always this question of, okay, how are the people going to benefit from this? This is kind of cool, David. Looks like the El salvadorian government is going to give individual citizens up to $30 in order to promote adoption. They have to buy that bitcoin from somewhere. They can't just mint it, they can't produce it. This is not a fiat currency. Right? They have to buy it in order to get it or mine it. Maybe some volcano mining, I don't know.
00:49:47.526 - 00:49:53.798, Speaker A: But it's kind of a cool story, and I think it's great for the bitcoin community and great for bitcoin adoption.
00:49:53.894 - 00:50:21.774, Speaker B: And if you are an El salvadorian citizen and you are skeptical about El Salvador's usage of bitcoin, perhaps this free money helps. Free money helps, literally, the purpose of airdrops. Right. And also, if you want to generate a bitcoin native economy inside of El Salvador, you need bitcoin to be in the hands of people. Like, imagine if you're just like, if your family in El Salvador is talking to the other family in El Salvador, and they're like, oh, bitcoin is legal tender now. Do you guys have any? No, we don't have any bitcoin. Oh, well, now you do.
00:50:21.774 - 00:50:36.950, Speaker B: Now everyone just got $30 in bitcoin, so now you can actually start that. That bitcoin native economy inside of El Salvador. I think this was a really good move that really indicates that the president of El Salvador, Naib, his heart's in the right place. His heart and mind's in the right place. So good move. Good move.
00:50:37.020 - 00:51:00.218, Speaker A: I saw Naib shaking hands or standing next to Peter McCormick, a podcaster. What a crazy world we live in, David. Like media podcasters shaking hands with the president of the nation to talk about bitcoin. Kind of wild stuff. Anyway, we'll be following that as it progresses in the future. Let's talk about Binance and UK regulation. This is our regulatory section.
00:51:00.218 - 00:51:13.986, Speaker A: The UK is cracking down on Binance, ordering the exchange to cease operations in the UK. I'm not sure how much they're able to actually restrict Binance's operation, but it seems like they're trying to. And he takes here.
00:51:14.088 - 00:51:30.778, Speaker B: Yeah. The longer that Binance continues to exist, the more and more. It's going to just come under the purview of nation states. It's a meat space company that's operating under meat space laws. The meat space is going to come after Binance at some point in time and it's going to have to bend the knee to nation states. That is my take.
00:51:30.944 - 00:52:07.538, Speaker A: All right, let's talk about the Fed now. So this is a vice chair of the Federal Reserve Board, Randy Corals, and he authored a paper called Parachute Pants, an article that is, and central bank money, which basically, he argues the TLDR is our existing banking system is fine. Our payment system works well. It's getting even better all of the time. And we don't really need a CDBC stablecoin at all or a CDBC strategy to compete with China. He said this and then he also said, which I find very interesting. But yes, we should be saying yes to stablecoins, to private stablecoins.
00:52:07.538 - 00:52:31.002, Speaker A: So his take is no CBDC. We don't need to create a centralized China style CBDC. But yeah, stablecoins are fine. Like private stablecoins acting as sort of a proxy CBDC. That's okay. So it just shows, David, that there continues to be some division, I think, within the US government and the Fed on what its strategy is. Unlike China, which seems like, no, we're full steam ahead.
00:52:31.002 - 00:52:40.222, Speaker A: We're doing the CBDC thing. We're going to digitize everything. The Fed is kind of waffling on. Should we do one or should we not? We're not really sure. And it keeps going back and forth. It seems like.
00:52:40.356 - 00:53:03.622, Speaker B: Yeah. On the last weekly roll up with Anthony Suzanne, we had a topic about how the Fed is continuing to research and look into central bank digital currencies. Like, oh, great, more research, more talk. This is interesting that a Fed vice chair is saying, hey, let's let the private market produce the products. I'm aligned with this, actually. That makes more sense to me. I mean, do fix your banking system is not what you said it was.
00:53:03.622 - 00:53:14.998, Speaker B: If that was, let's be real here. And also stablecoins are the solution to that. But I also agree with you. We do not need a central bank digital currency for the US dollar.
00:53:15.174 - 00:53:48.742, Speaker A: All right, let's talk crypto banks really quick. So FTX, which a crypto exchange, crypto bank, as we call them, has just recruited Tom Brady and Giselle, Tom Brady's wife, to be the spokesperson for FTX. I've given them some equity, some investing as well, some money in exchange for this. Really interesting how crypto banks are starting to saturate into mainstream. Both. We talked about this from a regulatory perspective, but now, like, mainstream influencers, not on the Defi bandwagon, but, like, on the crypto bank bandwagon, I don't love this. I don't hate this.
00:53:48.742 - 00:53:49.800, Speaker A: What's your take?
00:53:50.250 - 00:53:56.390, Speaker B: Yeah, my question is, do you think Sam Bankman fried is really all that much of a sports fan?
00:53:57.050 - 00:53:58.054, Speaker A: Oh, my God.
00:53:58.172 - 00:54:00.200, Speaker B: No, I don't think he is.
00:54:00.670 - 00:54:13.082, Speaker A: The answer to that question is no. But is he a savvy business person? Is he a new level banker using all the tools at his disposal to make more money and make FTX bigger? Yes. Yes.
00:54:13.136 - 00:54:14.720, Speaker B: That's exactly what's going on.
00:54:16.130 - 00:54:35.022, Speaker A: Well, I don't know how this ends. I guess it's okay for crypto. I don't know, long term if it's good for decentralization. I feel like there's some final bosses out there, but there is a mini boss where Defi might have to fight the crypto banks at some point in time. I've always thought that we'll see how it goes. I like FTX. SBF has me blocked on Twitter.
00:54:35.022 - 00:54:47.814, Speaker A: But if I could tweet at you, I'd be like, hey, come on, bankless, let's talk about what your plans are. Let's talk about it. All right, let's do some drive bys. David, ICP is not insane posse. What is ICP? What are they doing?
00:54:47.932 - 00:55:06.330, Speaker B: ICP is the Internet computer. Is that what that means? I think that's what that means. It's the token for definity, and definity has been largely critiqued by its large, high production launch and high media. Just overall, just like a ton of marketing, ton of pr, ton of production.
00:55:06.410 - 00:55:07.054, Speaker A: Forever, too.
00:55:07.092 - 00:55:52.714, Speaker B: Taken forever to get their product out the door. People who pay attention to dfinity say that their code is really interesting, but I think that they have just taken all of the opportunity that they could have had to be a legitimate product, and they crumpled it up in a piece of paper, and they threw it in the trash. Because the team dumped so much of the tokens into the free market that it just tanked the price. And so the definity team walked away with, I think, something like, can you go back to the first screenshot, Ryan? Something with 300. They dumped 20 million ICP tokens, definity tokens. The average price of $300 walked away with $6 billion in the first two weeks of trading. So they said, hey, all you people that are bullish, definity, that's great.
00:55:52.714 - 00:56:05.070, Speaker B: We're going to dump on you. And there's no faster way to just ruin your legitimacy as a project than to dump on the people that are willing to buy into your project on day one. Like, big mistake. Big mistake.
00:56:05.730 - 00:56:07.220, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll see how it goes.
00:56:07.750 - 00:56:12.670, Speaker B: How do I say it's a mistake? They made $6 billion, but also you ruined your legitimacy.
00:56:12.830 - 00:56:28.162, Speaker A: Yeah, it depends what their intent was. And legitimacy, I think, as a currency, as a money, it's gone. In particular, it's gone. Yeah, that definitely feels gone. At least it would take a lot for that to come back. Let's talk about visa. Visa makes five strategic crypto hires and placements.
00:56:28.162 - 00:56:53.970, Speaker A: Dude, visa is doubling down in crypto. We're going to have the guy behind this, Q Sheffield on bankless to talk about what visa is doing. Hopefully at some point in the future, they just have to get that cleared by legal. But I want to hear what visa is doing, man, because it seems like they've got a crypto strategy and they're gearing up. David, this last thing, USDC stablecoin is now expanding to multiple blockchains. Could soon be on ten networks. So this is not just Ethereum, but it's Tron.
00:56:53.970 - 00:57:04.510, Speaker A: Wherever else can support L two s? I'm sure, Salana. I'm sure. Any thoughts on this expansion? It's just inevitable.
00:57:04.590 - 00:57:11.346, Speaker B: No, the US dollar owes no allegiance to any blockchain, but I expect the majority of the USDC to stay on Ethereum.
00:57:11.538 - 00:57:18.118, Speaker A: All right, guys, we are going to be back with some hot takes, but before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:57:18.284 - 00:57:53.986, Speaker B: Bankless is proud to be supported by Uniswap. Uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure. Instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans, Uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on Ethereum, which is what Ryan and I call a money robot. No human counterparties or centralized intermediaries, just autonomous code on Ethereum. Input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy. Something brand new in the Uniswap ecosystem is the Uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants. We have been saying this for a while and we'll say it again.
00:57:53.986 - 00:58:22.042, Speaker B: Dows have money and they are in need of labor. If you think that you have something to contribute to the Uniswap, Dow apply for a grant to Uniswap. Just look at the size of the Uniswap treasury. It's almost $3 billion. This mountain of capital is looking for labor. Do you have something of value to contribute to the Uniswap Dow? No matter how big or small your idea is, you can apply for a unigrant@unigrants.org and help steer uniswap in the direction that you think it should go.
00:58:22.042 - 00:58:52.226, Speaker B: That's exactly what we did to get Uniswap to be a sponsor for bankless, and you can do the same for your project. Thank you, Uniswap, for sponsoring bankless. Gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange. I've been a customer of Gemini since I first got into crypto in 2017, and it's been my main exchange of choice to make. My crypto buys and sells. Gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide. And on Gemini, there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets, including many of the hot DFI tokens.
00:58:52.226 - 00:59:30.306, Speaker B: And it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid dye markets. Gemini just launched their earn program, where you can earn up to 7.4% interest on 26 various crypto assets. If you're tired of paying fees in DFI or you don't want to worry about DFI exploits, but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets, Gemini Earn is the product for you. Another product I'm stoked to get my hands on is the Gemini crypto back credit card, which gives you 3% cash back on all of your purchases, but paid to you in your preferred crypto asset. When I get my Gemini credit card, I'm going to make sure that I get my cash back in ETH. So whenever I buy something, I get a little bit of eth bonus back to me.
00:59:30.306 - 00:59:45.254, Speaker B: At the same time, you can open up a free account in under 3 minutes@gemini.com. Gobankless and if you trade more than $100 within the first 30 days after sign up, you'll be gifted a free $15 bitcoin bonus. Check them out@gemini.com.
00:59:45.372 - 01:00:04.154, Speaker A: Gobankless all right, guys, we are back with the takes of the week. Then we're going to get to memes, so stick with us. The first is from Gajesh, I think. Gajesh eth.com in the, in the. That is kind of a cool take. This is like the new Internet.
01:00:04.154 - 01:00:07.198, Speaker A: That's what this is saying.com to eth. Any thoughts here?
01:00:07.284 - 01:00:24.180, Speaker B: Yeah, to some degree, I'm also not paying attention to this, but the world of ETH addresses. I got David Hoffman eth. You got Rsa eth. There's a world of speculation to be had in there, and I don't know why that's not a bigger world. You got to claim the Ens do names if you think that this is true.
01:00:24.870 - 01:00:28.342, Speaker A: I'd pay a few hundred dollars for David Hoffman eth. Like, even now.
01:00:28.396 - 01:00:39.000, Speaker B: Dude, I offered the guy that owned David Eth, five Eth for David Eth, but the lowest bid was 13 eth. And I was like, oh, no, I like eth too much.
01:00:39.530 - 01:00:48.074, Speaker A: That's a lot. Funny story. We can't get bankless eth, either. Somebody's got that. Actually, no, we did get bankless e.
01:00:48.112 - 01:00:50.394, Speaker B: Yeah, we have it. We do have it. You bought it.
01:00:50.432 - 01:00:50.778, Speaker A: Sorry?
01:00:50.864 - 01:00:54.860, Speaker B: You bought it. You told me you got it.
01:00:56.030 - 01:00:59.054, Speaker A: Yeah, no, we spent $3,000 on that.
01:00:59.092 - 01:01:01.854, Speaker B: Yeah, we spent some money to claim that. That was a good move.
01:01:01.892 - 01:01:05.194, Speaker A: Sorry, I was thinking of banklessdow eth that we can't do that we can't.
01:01:05.242 - 01:01:05.802, Speaker B: Someone squat.
01:01:05.866 - 01:01:15.522, Speaker A: Somebody else that. Oh, my God. I don't even know the Ens names we own. We have bankless eth, guys. Never fear. You know what? Jagesh is also. He's like a 13 year old kid.
01:01:15.522 - 01:01:24.390, Speaker A: Do you know this David? So he listens to bankless. He's dming me before. He's a blockchain developer. He's a kid. He's got almost 20,000 followers.
01:01:24.890 - 01:01:30.460, Speaker B: And the meme for his header. This guy is cryptoculture, the godfather. Yeah.
01:01:31.310 - 01:01:31.930, Speaker A: I wonder.
01:01:32.000 - 01:01:33.100, Speaker B: He's with it, man.
01:01:34.030 - 01:01:38.170, Speaker A: How many people do you think listen to the show who are, like, 18 or like, under 18?
01:01:38.830 - 01:01:53.070, Speaker B: Maybe the instadap brothers, who made instadap. They were both under 18 when they started working on instadap. I think the youngest one was, like, 15 when he started working on instadap. And then they've raised some couple of million dollars a few years later before one of them hit 18. It was crazy.
01:01:53.220 - 01:02:07.342, Speaker A: This is awesome, man. This is millennials handing the torch over to Zoomers. We kind of started this thing, but you guys are going to take it to the finish line, so it's awesome to see. All right, let's do this take. So, I think it starts with Gutenberg. Why don't you read this out, David?
01:02:07.406 - 01:02:36.458, Speaker B: Yeah. This is a tweet from Greg Eisenberg. He says the Gutenberg launched the printing press when 96% of the people in Europe were illiterate. That's how it feels to be building in Web three crypto today. It's just early. And there's an interesting thought experiment to be had where imagine you're inventing the Gutenberg machine, and some investor comes up to you and goes, why would you invent the printing press when only 4% of the population can read like that? Doesn't make any sense. No one's going to want your bad ux.
01:02:36.458 - 01:03:12.134, Speaker B: Bad ux. Turns out it was a printing press that taught people to read and then became the most influential piece of technology of the next 500 years. So Anthony Cesano, quote, retweets this tweet and says, this tweet has been messing with my head since I saw it yesterday. And then friend of the pod, Josh Rosenthal, the guy behind the Crypto Renaissance podcast, goes, sazzle is in the know. It's a great point and even more spot on than the original poster of this tweet. Josh says permissionless communication drove the renaissance, combined with ledger based fintech in the 14 hundreds, unraveling hierarchies and empowering communities. Links to a YouTube video.
01:03:12.134 - 01:03:20.234, Speaker B: I'm pretty sure that's our podcast, and that's why that podcast was so good. And if you haven't listened to the Crypto Renaissance podcast, you got to go listen to it.
01:03:20.432 - 01:03:30.590, Speaker A: Links to a specific part in this podcast. That's great, dude. I love this tweet. I think it is spot on. How many people are learning finance through crypto today, right.
01:03:30.740 - 01:03:31.246, Speaker B: Me.
01:03:31.348 - 01:03:51.430, Speaker A: This is how I'm learning finance. Yeah, absolutely. All right, let's talk about this Coinbase. This is Brian Armstrong again. He says, we plan to list every crypto asset where legally viable. This is a departure, I think. But I'm glad they are at least broadcasting this, because there was a time in place where Coinbase was seen as sort of a gatekeeper for retail.
01:03:51.430 - 01:04:22.974, Speaker A: They would help you avoid bad investments like terrible assets. And I think now they're saying, like, we're making no statement as to whether these assets are good buys or bad buys or complete scams or not scams. If it's legally viable, we're just going to list it. It does feel like that is the lowest common denominator for exchanges. Like, if binance is listing it, how can coinbase not listing it? So I understand this approach, and I guess I appreciate the clarity there. It's like, just because it's on Coinbase doesn't mean you should buy it, guys.
01:04:23.092 - 01:05:13.630, Speaker B: Totally. They used to have the, like, asset framework to really gauge the quality of an asset, and they would score it on different scores. And that was kind of like a cover your own ass strategy that they were doing. And I think actually that might have backfired, because if you start talking about the different natures of the different properties of the asset, is it centralized? Who owns the supply, blah blah, blah, well, then you actually start to get into a realm that you maybe didn't want to get into into the first place, which is delving too deep as to the nature of the assets. And so instead of having that five part point level system that there was the original framework, they are just doing a binary one or zero, like, is it legally viable, legal, or is it not right? And to some degree, that removes responsibility for even commenting on the quality of the token. So as a profit maximalist and a business maximalist perspective, it makes sense. It makes sense.
01:05:13.700 - 01:05:37.400, Speaker A: It's kind of fun, is Uniswap doesn't even check for that. It's even more credibly neutral. It doesn't even rely on the legal system. Is it an ERC 20 asset or not? That's the only level of gatekeeping or permission you need for uniswap, which is a beautiful thing. All right, let's look at this Vitalik quote. David, this was really cool. And it's a Vitalik quote from a long time ago, actually.
01:05:37.400 - 01:06:37.142, Speaker A: But it's held up like a lot of things Vitalik has talked about or done over the years. Whereas most technologies, Vitalik says, tend to automate workers on the periphery doing menial tasks, what blockchains do is automate away the center. So instead of putting the taxi driver out of a job, blockchain puts uber out of a job and lets the taxi driver work with the customer directly. I think that's a super powerful quote because what he's talking about is like a new architecture for the economy. We just had this conversation with some folks about the creator economy, our panel that we just had yesterday, David, and we talked about this being a more friendly era and economy for individual creators. And I think that's what Vitalik is talking about. That blockchain is actually creating a mechanism for creators to interact directly with the market without having to go through a big web two zeroman or an Uber, for instance.
01:06:37.142 - 01:06:42.634, Speaker A: That is kind of the end state goal of this and super cool if we can make that happen. Yeah.
01:06:42.672 - 01:07:10.850, Speaker B: This reminds me of another Vitella quote where he says, the cool thing about Ethereum is it doesn't put the taxicab driver out of a job. It puts the CEO of Uber out of a job, or it puts the middle management or the bureaucracy out of a job. And bureaucracy, by almost definition, doesn't add value. It's just an efficiency. It's not the value creators. The value creators are the Uber drivers or the content producers or whatever. And this is actually the original version of daos.
01:07:10.850 - 01:07:51.886, Speaker B: Daos these days are really kind of just nicknames for digital organizations where people just exist in a discord and have a plan and a goal. The original vision of dows was code at the center and humans at the periphery, where Uber drivers would come interact with the Uber app. The Uber Dow, the Uber D app, and the Uber D app would autonomously ascribe them like tasks, and then the Uber humans would do the tasks, and then the Uber Dao would award money to them. Code at the center, humans at the periphery. That was the OG version of daos, and that's still yet being built out, like stuff like Airbnb and Uber and the sharing economy stuff, really hard to do. But that's the vision that Vitalik is articulating here. And I still think that's the vision for Ethereum.
01:07:51.886 - 01:07:54.702, Speaker B: It's just like probably the hardest thing to tackle.
01:07:54.846 - 01:08:17.642, Speaker A: And Jesse, our friend Jesse Walden would say this is the ownership economy. So it's not just the Uber driver earning money. The Uber driver is actually earning ownership, which equity in the platform and so upside. Right. Which is super cool and a way to flip capital markets on its head. Let's talk about this. So Koopatrupa, another participant in the Dow panel that we just had, so guys, check that out if you haven't yet.
01:08:17.642 - 01:08:21.194, Speaker A: I think that's on YouTube right now. We're probably putting it in the podcast, too.
01:08:21.232 - 01:08:22.220, Speaker B: Oh, it's already out.
01:08:22.670 - 01:08:29.662, Speaker A: It's out on the podcast. Wrote a great piece on the Dow landscape. David, what are some of the highlights from this article for you?
01:08:29.716 - 01:08:52.422, Speaker B: Yeah, Cooper is a great writer and he's just paying attention to daos at large. And so we keep on talking about dows on bankless. And if you're trying to get up to speed with daos, definitely check out this article from Cooper. He both just talks about the current state of specific dows, as well as more high level broad ideas or thoughts about how daos are organized and some good mental models and graphics to go along with it.
01:08:52.556 - 01:08:55.686, Speaker A: All right, David, it's that time of the week. What are you excited about?
01:08:55.708 - 01:09:40.994, Speaker B: David Hoffman, I got an article coming out on the bankless newsletter next week, and it's been a while since I've written and it's been a while since I've written to this level of effort, some of my most recent articles, I've kind of just written it and sended it out. But this one I've really been taking my time, really going back and editing. It's all about the march of Defi capital efficiency in the lens of ether, the asset, right? So DFI is always in the competition to become more and more and more capitally efficient. Every new successful DFI protocol is successful because it's a more capitally efficient version of any predecessor. Uniswap V two is an improvement on the capital efficiency of v one. Uniswap v three is a capital efficient improvement on v two. Balancer V two is a capital efficient improvement upon balancer.
01:09:40.994 - 01:10:11.598, Speaker B: It's all about capital efficiency. It's all about capital efficiency. Layer on capital efficiency to how ETh is the native asset of Ethereum and receives all of these capital efficient tailwinds. And that's completely aside from ether as ultrasound money. Ether is ultrasound money, specifically at the protocol level, ultrasound comes from the Ethereum protocol. DeFi is doing something completely differently, which is also putting tailwinds behind the ether, the asset, which is allowing ether to become the most capital efficient asset of all time. That's what I've been writing about.
01:10:11.598 - 01:10:17.986, Speaker B: Still in the editing process, really trying to make this as punchy as possible. But I think this article is going to be a good one, and that's what I'm excited about.
01:10:18.168 - 01:10:21.954, Speaker A: This is new for you. You seem odly bullish eth, which I've never heard from you before.
01:10:21.992 - 01:10:24.610, Speaker B: David, I've come around the ether lately.
01:10:25.590 - 01:10:39.142, Speaker A: It sounds like an article from 2019 or 2020 when you were writing these big thought pieces on how DFI protocols were going to kind of consume and eat up ether as an asset. So, man, I'm super excited to read that.
01:10:39.276 - 01:11:04.110, Speaker B: Yeah, that's an interesting way to put it. Yeah. The game for DFI applications has always been to gobble up ether, right? And the competition for defi apps to become more capital efficient is just incentives, better and better incentives for people to deposit their ether into these defi apps. Defi apps want your ether. They're trying to eat it, and so they're trying to convince you to put it in there, and they do that by making a better product. It's crazy.
01:11:04.180 - 01:11:04.778, Speaker A: Competition.
01:11:04.874 - 01:11:05.318, Speaker B: Competition.
01:11:05.354 - 01:11:06.558, Speaker A: They're competing for your eth.
01:11:06.654 - 01:11:11.410, Speaker B: Yes. We always say competition is good for the consumer. In DeFi, competition is good for ether.
01:11:11.990 - 01:11:12.594, Speaker A: Absolutely.
01:11:12.712 - 01:11:14.306, Speaker B: Ryan, what are you excited about?
01:11:14.488 - 01:11:24.466, Speaker A: I'm excited about Daos, man. I'm feeling that Dao energy. Did a conference about dows. I need to get it caught up with. We had a creator economy panel on dows and seeing what's happening in the bankless Dow.
01:11:24.498 - 01:11:27.010, Speaker B: We had 4 hours of Dow content on bankless.
01:11:27.090 - 01:12:00.114, Speaker A: Oh my God, so much content. And I listened to your meet the nation with coordinate, which was awesome. They talked about at the end about kind of dow theory, and I'm just appreciating this Dow energy and it seems so simple, right? What are daos? They're programmable llcs. But this is so fundamentally important, like programmable capital coordination tools. You got multi sigs, which are like the programmable treasuries. You've got tokens which are like programmable cap tables. You've got this all built on top of Ethereum as a programmable banking system.
01:12:00.114 - 01:12:40.480, Speaker A: It's global, it's Internet native, it's completely open. Koopa Troopa said this, too, lately where he said, basically Daos are where NFTs were a year ago. And I feel the same way about dows as I felt a year ago about nfTs, which is like, I knew they were this really exciting, really awesome primitive that we're so early in using. And I know that dows are going to be absolutely massive. Jesse Walden said we're going to have a DAO sometime in the next couple of decades that is bigger and more important and more complicated and interesting than social media tech, like Facebook. Wow. Bigger than the biggest companies in the world.
01:12:40.480 - 01:13:13.622, Speaker A: I plus one that, I agree with that. But here's the interesting part, David, is like, I know they're going to be absolutely huge as a primitive, but I'm not sure exactly like I expect to be surprised. Just like nfts. Last year at this time, we started doing some NFT episodes before they just blew up and became absolutely massive. And that's what's so cool about crypto is like, you know, this stuff is going to be big, but it's so emergent. You don't know when or exactly how. You just know that this is going to be massively impactful.
01:13:13.622 - 01:13:23.818, Speaker A: So maybe something in gaming, I don't know which communities haven't gotten a hold of these Dow primitives and technology before. We'll have to see how it plans out.
01:13:23.904 - 01:14:01.510, Speaker B: I mean, World of Warcraft Guild feel like the original daos, right? Like people coming together from all over the Internet, fighting over scarce resources. Sounds like a Dow, right? So we've seen this energy before. I think when Koopa says daos are just a year behind nfts, I think I'll add that it really feels like Dow tooling is really the subject matter that really needs to, that we are currently building right now is Dao Tooling is kind of where NFT tooling was a year ago or so. And this is why the people at coordinate are doing fantastic work. Daos need tools. Dows need help. You can't just put people in a discord and mint a token.
01:14:01.510 - 01:14:19.070, Speaker B: You need tools to help facilitate how to Dow. And so I think we are about to embark upon the golden age of Dow tooling. And once that gets finished up and once we figure out what are the tools that dows really need to dow, then 1000 dows will flourish.
01:14:19.650 - 01:15:00.154, Speaker A: Yeah. And guys, if you're listening to bankless, you're looking for some alpha, right? I think that this is alpha. Remember when we were talking to the founders of Nifty Gateway and they're like, we always believed NFTs would be huge, right? We were saying this in 2018, we're saying it 2019, we're saying it in 2020. And now suddenly early 2021, the whole world understands it. But we've been building and saying this the entire time. This is what dows feel like to me. So if you're looking for opportunities in the space to plug in, to maybe work for a Dow, earn some income, maybe invest in some of this underlying infrastructure or some of the dows themselves, now is the time you're still front running that opportunity.
01:15:00.154 - 01:15:06.142, Speaker A: But it's going to be big. I think it's going to blow up in a big way. So maybe some alpha there.
01:15:06.276 - 01:15:18.260, Speaker B: We'll have to see if Jesse Walden thinks that there's going to be a Dow that becomes bigger than Facebook over the next ten years. If you can find that. Like nine years before. If you can find that one. If you can find it.
01:15:20.390 - 01:15:50.442, Speaker A: And here's the thing. Okay, so Facebook was not open to investor, like, to main street investors wasn't open to the world. Just a small set of people who are credit investors in the US could invest in Facebook and realize those early gains. Like Facebook didn't ipo until like, I don't know, 2008, 2009, something like that. Right? With Dows, you have immediate access to buy into a Dow and earn some equity from day one. Massive opportunity.
01:15:50.576 - 01:15:50.970, Speaker B: Yes.
01:15:51.040 - 01:15:51.386, Speaker A: All right.
01:15:51.408 - 01:15:52.330, Speaker B: Don't miss it.
01:15:52.480 - 01:15:58.030, Speaker A: Don't miss it. Let's drop something cool really quick and then we'll talk meme of the week. David, what are we looking at here?
01:15:58.100 - 01:16:19.720, Speaker B: So this is a cool map made by a member of the bankless Dao Perchy shout out Perchy. And there's a link for this in the show notes if you want to go and look at it yourself. But it's just one of those maps that has something in every single corner. But it's overall the bankless nation. Right? We got bankless dow in the top left connected to Bankless LLC. I think we are a radio tower, Ryan. That's kind of cool.
01:16:19.720 - 01:16:40.410, Speaker B: We got the charts for the mountain range. We have hard cap hills for bitcoin. We got the cold storage deep in the mountain range, got the yield farms, got centralization harbor. And there's just a bunch of cool little Easter eggs all over this map. And so it was really just creative work out of the bankless dow out of perchy, and I really enjoyed just going around and seeing what's in here.
01:16:40.560 - 01:16:51.040, Speaker A: Yeah, it's really cool. Definitely. It has kind of like a lord of the Rings type feel, medieval type feel to it, too. I think this the Citadel, the bitcoin citadel, that looks a little familiar. Maybe Sauron's tower. I'm not sure.
01:16:53.170 - 01:16:54.190, Speaker B: You think that's.
01:16:56.370 - 01:17:02.626, Speaker A: It's, uh. It's a super cool drawing, so make sure you check that out. All right, David meme of the week, explain this. What are we looking at?
01:17:02.728 - 01:17:32.802, Speaker B: This is the classic Anakin and Padme meme. And so Anakin has got laser eyes on in the first panel, and he goes, laser eyes until $100,000, 100,000 bitcoin. And then Padme says, you're going to take them off if there's a bear market. Right? And then the next panel is Anakin still with laser eyes just now with a McDonald's cap on his head. So, no, you're not taking it off even though it's a bear market. And really, this is just a meme about conviction. Like, I'm going to go to McDonald's and work for McDonald's before I lose my conviction in bitcoin.
01:17:32.802 - 01:17:34.426, Speaker B: So that was a pretty fun meme.
01:17:34.538 - 01:17:48.894, Speaker A: The McDonald's crypto memes just won't stop. They'll always be here with us when the bear market's on. Good stuff. All right, I think that is it. Bankless nation, thank you for joining us for another recap. As always, none of this was financial advice. Crypto is risky.
01:17:48.894 - 01:17:57.550, Speaker A: ETH is risky. So is defi and bitcoin. You could lose what you put in, but this is the frontier. We are headed west. Thanks for joining us on bankless.
