00:00:07.850 - 00:00:21.022, Speaker A: All right, bankless nation, it is the first week of March. This is Friday morning. I hope you're enjoying this special edition of the roll ups. First edition of March with your Friday morning Copy. David, what are we doing today?
00:00:21.156 - 00:00:44.666, Speaker B: We're rolling it up. We're rolling up the first week of March. As we all know, the cryptocurrency industry moves so incredibly fast, and so we try and distill a full week of crypto news into one single episode. It's an ambitious endeavor. We try and condense as much information in as short a time as possible. Sometimes we go a little bit long, but we're going to try and condense things a little bit better this week. So, Ryan, shall we get into it?
00:00:44.768 - 00:01:15.102, Speaker A: We should, David, but first, before we get into it, we should mention that consensus tickets are on sale, so this is a virtual conference you can attend. I'll be there. David is speaking there. Ray Dalio is speaking there, so he's in good company. The thing I wanted to mention is that you can get $20 off when you use the bankless code. They've got an early bird special, so if you're planning to attend a crypto conference this year, this should be the one you attend. Everyone goes, fantastic event, and get $20 off with the code bankless.
00:01:15.102 - 00:01:21.346, Speaker A: We'll include a note in the show. Notes. David, let's start with markets, my friend. You ready to start with markets?
00:01:21.458 - 00:01:24.022, Speaker B: Let's do it. What are the markets saying?
00:01:24.156 - 00:01:29.954, Speaker A: Well, tell us, bitcoin. What is the price of bitcoin right now? Where have we been and where are we going?
00:01:30.092 - 00:02:03.118, Speaker B: Yeah, at the time of recording, bitcoin is at $47,500. Ryan's got Mazari on up. It's got $48,000 different depending on where you look. But we got back over $50,000 this week. But maintaining strength, I think, has been a little bit of a struggle for the main monies, the bitcoin and ether. We are falling down a little bit today, but on the ether price action, we both touched $1,600 and the $1,400 in the same day. So things are volatile.
00:02:03.118 - 00:02:09.174, Speaker B: We're definitely planting a floor, I would say, but we are struggling to get much higher than that.
00:02:09.372 - 00:02:24.074, Speaker A: Still feels like we're in a bit of a dip, but maybe, as some have said, a dip for ants. This is not a substantial dip. Not sure when it will end, but it definitely still feels very much like we are in a secular bull run. Let's talk about the price of ether. What's going on here.
00:02:24.192 - 00:02:53.298, Speaker B: Yeah. From the low, low price, that ether hit of $1,400 earlier, earlier this week, and last week it got all the way back up to $1,650. Now ether is back down to the price of $1,537. Kind of all over the place. Again, having that strength off the floor, off the bottom of the dip that we saw, but also not really able to continue its strength really. So still kind of stuck in this range. We will see what happens.
00:02:53.384 - 00:03:04.950, Speaker A: And it has dipped harder than bitcoin. But you've officially called the bottom floor of ether for now at 1300, and that's holding up fairly well so far. So cross your fingers for David, guys. He's making calls here.
00:03:05.020 - 00:03:08.966, Speaker B: We'll see. I do believe that you cannot go below $1,300.
00:03:09.068 - 00:03:26.750, Speaker A: We'll see about that. That's a dangerous call. Okay, DFI leaderboard, let's talk about total value locked in DFI that has dipped a little bit. This kind of plateaued at this 40 billion mark, which. Oh, my God. 40 billion. Still incredibly high versus a year ago.
00:03:26.750 - 00:03:31.630, Speaker A: But the parabola has flattened a little bit lately. What's going on here?
00:03:31.780 - 00:03:55.714, Speaker B: Yeah, so again, both, there's three things going on here. There are continuing deposits of assets into DFI protocols. Those assets are increasingly increasing in price, except for the last week. And also DFI pulse is adding new applications into their metrics. Right. So I think today they just added tornado cash. So tornado cash is the new metric.
00:03:55.714 - 00:04:06.380, Speaker B: I think there's $300 million that tornado cash has. Yeah. 304. Congrats to tornado cash for getting on the board. Well deserved. I expect a number to only go up with tornado cash.
00:04:08.430 - 00:04:11.130, Speaker A: There's 300 million locked in tornado cash.
00:04:11.280 - 00:04:32.258, Speaker B: Right. And so what's going on is there's a liquidity mining mechanism where if you put your ether into tornado cash and leave it in there, which is good for privacy, because there's a bigger crowd that people can hide amongst with tornado cash as mixing services. So they reward you with the torn token for how long you leave your ether in there, which is pretty cool.
00:04:32.424 - 00:04:50.710, Speaker A: Super cool. All right, what's going on with DFI pulse index, the DPI, which is the top ten DFI token, projects price of that is 413 at the time I'm looking at it. It's a little bit up on the week. It looks like, unlike ether price. What's going on?
00:04:50.860 - 00:05:22.850, Speaker B: Yeah. And I'm going to start saying some trader words, but don't ascribe me to being any sort of trader professional. But it looks like DPi has done a triple bottom. It's touched the 400 range, the low 400 range, three times in March already, and March is only like five days long now. And so again, planting a floor at $400, not really able to extend above that floor, but definitely not going below it either. So there's both, like the mixed signals in the markets right now, signs of strength, but not able to continue that strength. And DPi is showing that as well.
00:05:23.000 - 00:05:41.466, Speaker A: Now, we started looking at this metric into the new year, the DPI to ETH ratio. And this basically tracks DPI's strength relative to ETH. So it tells us whether we're in defi season or not, as we've called it, from a cyclical perspective. So, David, are we in defi season? What's happening here?
00:05:41.568 - 00:05:50.922, Speaker B: Yeah, Ryan, if you zoom out for that three month or six month time frame, the DPI versus ETH trend is extremely strong. Wow.
00:05:50.976 - 00:05:51.194, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:05:51.232 - 00:06:23.110, Speaker B: Look at that straight line up and to the right. There's a lot of volatility in intraday or intra week movements. But ever since 2021, DPI has been an up and to the right trend versus etH. The trend is your friend. This has been a really sustainable growth, which is the cool thing. This isn't a blow off top. Things are just modestly marching up and to the right in terms of defi versus eTH, which I think is a metric that offers much more signal than DPI or defI tokens versus the dollar.
00:06:23.110 - 00:06:44.746, Speaker B: DPI is an indication of people's ability to be risk on, and DPI versus ETH is people's interest in being risk on versus ether, which is already kind of a risk on asset anyway. So it's really a taste of how risky people are interested in being, because Defi tokens are more speculative than ether and just marching up into the right.
00:06:44.928 - 00:06:48.090, Speaker A: David, do you want to talk about the new bull, or should I talk about the new pool?
00:06:48.170 - 00:06:50.110, Speaker B: I think you're going to have to talk about the new bull.
00:06:51.410 - 00:07:33.090, Speaker A: This is a metric. We'll get back to defi revenue in a second, but this is a metric I, like so many of you, have probably seen the Wall street cheat sheet that looks something like this, where you go through this parabolic cycle of first there's hope in the market, then there's optimism, belief, euphoria, and then it drops down to complacency, anxiety, denial, panic and anger. Eventually it levels off in depression. When the bull market comes to an end, you're in the bear market. Everyone thinks it's dead, never coming back. You get back to disbelief, and then you repeat the cycle all over again. Well, the NUPL is an interesting metric from glassnode studios.
00:07:33.090 - 00:08:24.922, Speaker A: So this is net unrealized profit and loss. So won't get into all of the mechanics of this metric. It uses something called realized gains, but it's basically kind of tracking the cost basis of all ether holders and using sort of a metric to measure whether they're up or whether they're down. This is based on when the ether has last moved inside of their ether account. So think of it kind of as the cost basis of all ether holders. What I find interesting here, David, is they use that Wall street psychology kind of frame of reference where they've got, like, in the red, in the bear market that you're seeing, they've got capitulation. In the orange, you see hope, and in yellow, optimism.
00:08:24.922 - 00:08:58.902, Speaker A: And then green is belief, and then blue is euphoria. And they sort of chart this over time, which is super interesting. And right now, according to this metric, we are in a stage right before euphoria, which is the belief stage. So we're in that green zone territory, a bit above this metric number. We'd get into euphoria. We've seen that according to this metric three or four times back in 2017. So we're going to monitor this from time to time and kind of update you on this.
00:08:58.902 - 00:09:21.760, Speaker A: But when we start to get into sustained blue level territory, that might be an indicator that the market has topped, that we're inside the euphoria phase and things are getting a little bit nutty. We are the stage right below euphoria according to this metric. I think it's something to track, something that's quite interesting because it was fairly predictive in the 2017 bull run.
00:09:23.090 - 00:10:16.274, Speaker B: That makes a ton of sense. And I think my only comment here is that if and when we go from green to blue and go into that euphoric mode, that actually is not an indication to sell, at least in that one present moment, because it's about sustained time in that euphoric moment. If you go back to 2017, we first get into the blue, the euphoric moment with a $100 ETH price, right? Maybe a little bit north of that. And then we fell back down into the green, but then got back into the blue at $300 Eth price. And then for the third time, we got into blue at the max, the absolute peak at one $400. So in 2017, according to this metric, we were in the euphoric mode for three times before it was the actual top. So if people are looking at the green that we are currently in, and it's like, oh, man, there was only one more stage left.
00:10:16.274 - 00:10:19.826, Speaker B: It's about time in that stage as well.
00:10:19.928 - 00:10:40.620, Speaker A: Yeah, well said. Good that you pointed that out. I think that's definitely important to realize. All this metric is saying. Probably the bottom line is we have not yet hit the euphoria stage. So we are still relatively early in the bull run. We're certainly not in the earliest phase, but we're definitely not in the later half, is what this metric is telling us.
00:10:40.620 - 00:11:10.660, Speaker A: David, let's talk about the DeFi index fund that bitwise released. We had Matt Hogan on the podcast for state of the nation, which is just like an oh, my God, so good, so good. Such a good state of the nation. So listen to that. He came on Tuesday so you could get it on the podcast or on YouTube that way. But his message was, the financial advisors are coming, is his message. And there's $40 trillion, at least in the US locked that the financial advisors manage.
00:11:10.660 - 00:11:32.860, Speaker A: And he talked a little bit about the DFI index that bitwise has released. And it turns out this is a headline just from yesterday that this has been their fastest growing crypto index product ever. So the financial advisors are coming, David, and they're coming to DeFi, and they're investing in DeFi tokens. Super bullish, I think, for this space.
00:11:33.230 - 00:12:01.170, Speaker B: I think the interesting thing about this is that financial advisors aren't the fastest to move, but they're also not the slowest to move either. Right? They are relatively independent, and if one individual financial advisor wants to pull the trigger on something, they can do that. Right? And so when I see the headline, fastest growing week ever, my head's that, well, how many people are on the sidelines kind of waiting for other people to make the move? And now that other people are taking the like, I think there's going to be, quote, unquote, the floodgates open.
00:12:01.320 - 00:12:43.282, Speaker A: And you know what Matt opened our eyes to, I think, David, on that podcast, is that the narrative really makes sense. And why does the DeFi token narrative make sense? Is because financial advisors are used to investing in capital assets, like stocks, assets that have some sort of cash flow related to it. This is a graph from the block. We'll include a link in the show notes, as well, of daily DFI revenue. So, once again, this is not like 2017, where the tokens available produced no cash flows. They were just like utility tokens, futility tokens, as we've called them now, our tokens are producing real cash flows. No wonder financial advisors are starting to take interest.
00:12:43.282 - 00:12:48.174, Speaker A: What would you say about this chart here that I'm showing from the block of daily DeFi revenue?
00:12:48.302 - 00:13:21.346, Speaker B: Yeah, it's so consumable. This information is consumable and easy to look at. And for a financial advisor, I think they should be impressed about how the fact that they don't have to wait for a centralized entity to issue a quarterly report, having live data is a huge value proposition. That I think regardless of the specific DeFi protocol, the fact that DeFi at large is issuing real time reporting should be able to offer financial advisors the peace of mind when they make these investments.
00:13:21.478 - 00:13:45.842, Speaker A: So we are hitting about 25 million in DFI revenue per month, a total of 210,000,000. Especially when you consider growth. These are not numbers to sneeze at anymore. David, there's one last thing I think we should cover in the market section, and that is this tweet from Robert Leschner. I'm going to get you to maybe explain this and the significance of what Robert's saying here.
00:13:45.976 - 00:14:28.238, Speaker B: Yeah, I actually didn't understand the significance of this before I saw this tweet and I had to go and ask my more educated friends about what this means. So here's what I've learned. Robert says this is currently the most important market data in cryptocurrency markets. It drives the cost of funding across stablecoins and assets, the profitability of many businesses operating in the space defi markets, and in some cases, spot prices. What Robert Leschner, founder of compound by the way, what he's talking about is the GBTC and e premiums of grayscale. That is a significant source of revenue for many, many yield bearing companies. Right? Like think of who's the big blockfi would be one.
00:14:28.238 - 00:14:29.730, Speaker B: Yeah, would be a great 1.
00:14:29.800 - 00:14:31.822, Speaker A: Celcius would be another Nexo.
00:14:31.966 - 00:15:19.922, Speaker B: Right? And so people are like, many businesses have their revenue, a significant amount of their revenue from putting bitcoin into grayscale to accessing that premium, right? So, like if the premium, the GBTC to BTC premium is 50%, somebody would put in one bitcoin in, wait six months and get 1.5 bitcoins out. Like great business model, but it dried up and now it's even negative. And so people literally this revenue stream just got deleted from so many companies that depend on it. And so we are going to see a big contraction in a company's ability to generate revenue from this path. And the fear is that this could actually lead to selling, because now they have to sell assets to make ends meet. That's why Robert Lescher is drawing attention to this.
00:15:20.056 - 00:16:33.322, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's interesting because people always ask the question of, okay, blockfly is delivering like 7%, 8% yield, annual yield on stablecoins. How does that work? Where does the yield come from? Well, one of the places that yield comes from is this arbitrage opportunity between the grayscale premiums, right? So because there's this massive difference between the spot price of bitcoin and ETH and the price of grayscale shares, institutions are able to arbitrage that, and they deliver that in the form of interest to centralized platforms like blockfly. And of course that filters down into the Defi ecosystem as well. Now, I think there's two kind of questions about this. First of all, it's interesting to understand that, but the first is, will these premiums be sustained? Right, like low? This is the first time they've ever dropped into negative territory in recent memory. And is that just a blip, or will it hang out in negative territory? If it's just a blip, it doesn't really matter for kind of the long term, if premiums go back up, it doesn't matter. The other thing I think to consider is, my understanding is as well, there is a nice arb opportunity when premiums are actually on the negative side.
00:16:33.322 - 00:17:02.500, Speaker A: So there might be other ways to restore those high interest rates in DeFi. But it is interesting to think about the question of like, okay, where do these interest rates come from? Because they are manufactured from some sort of arbitrage opportunity somewhere. And the grayscale arbitrage opportunity is one of them. It's just how markets become more efficient, David, that is markets. We should take a minute to thank the sponsors that made this rollups episode possible.
00:17:03.110 - 00:18:05.350, Speaker B: Ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on Ethereum and just recently released Ave version two, which has a ton of cool new features that makes using Ave even more powerful. With Ave, you can leverage the full power of DFI money, legos, yield and composability all in one application. On Ave, there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield, and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol. If you have deposited collateral here, you can see me getting a 200 USDC loan against my portfolio of a number of different DFI tokens and ETH. I'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option, but I could choose the stable interest rate option if I wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently. One of Ave's v two features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets, trade them on Uniswap, and then deposit them back into Ave. Ave does all of this for you, all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them.
00:18:05.350 - 00:18:59.990, Speaker B: Check out the power of Ave@ave.com. That's aave.com. If you want to live a bankless life, you need to get a monolith Defi Visa card monolith is a one two punch of both an Ethereum smart contract wallet and an accompanying Visa card that lets you spend the money that you have in your Ethereum wallet everywhere where Visa is accepted. When you swipe your monolith Visa card at the grocery store or at a restaurant, it actually makes a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain that spends some of the money you hold in your monolith wallet. It's insanely cool, and it's one of the best tools out there for living a bankless but still normal life. Monolith also offers on ramp services for getting your fiat money into the world of defi, so it's trivial to top up your monolith card if you ever need to, and your deposited money goes straight into your non custodial wallet. So your money is never held by a centralized intermediary.
00:18:59.990 - 00:19:18.254, Speaker B: Because monolith is native ethereum infrastructure, the money you hold in your monolith wallet still has the power of defi behind it. Swapping assets on Uniswap or earning yield in Defi is at your fingertips. Go to monolith XYZ and sign up to get your monolith visa card today.
00:19:18.372 - 00:19:39.774, Speaker A: All right, David, release time. Let's get to the first. Google Finance has added a crypto tab to their google.com slash finance sheet where you can see all of the metrics, you can see what's going on in the US and Asia, SMP, Nasdaq, Russell index, Dow Jones, and now crypto just feels like it naturally fits there. I think it's kind of cool. Mainstream adoption.
00:19:39.902 - 00:19:47.734, Speaker B: Yep, and that's the story. Crypto is getting in front of people's eyeballs more and more and more, probably because people demand it.
00:19:47.852 - 00:20:12.986, Speaker A: This is the first year I've heard crypto actually mentioned on NPR. When they're going through the roundups, it just feels like it fits. This is something we would have never seen in 2017. David, I'm going to round out a few of these and throw them at you. And then let's get some comments. So the first is ZK sync has announced ecosystem investment round, a new investment round. So this is a layer two based on ZK.
00:20:12.986 - 00:20:47.158, Speaker A: I believe it's ZK rollups, not optimistic roll ups. This is from matterlabs. They've got a pretty massive series a investment for the tech that they're building. Let me get to the next one. Sushi is going main chain multi chain rather, and they're taking like this shotgun approach to it, which is sort of interesting. So sushi, of course, is sort of a uniswap clone originally, but they've developed into an interesting automated market making DFI exchange in their own right. And they're just shotgun gunning approach.
00:20:47.158 - 00:21:19.410, Speaker A: Their deployment to other layer twos and other chains, including Phantom, the Polygon chain, which is formerly matic, Xdai chain, binance smart chain, Moonbean Moon Network, which. That's something on Polkadot, looks like. It's an interesting approach. They're like, we're going to deploy sushi across all of these. We've got Alpha Hamora, who has embraced, as it says in the headlines, a multi chain future. They're starting with the binance chain. So they're deploying alpha Hamora on the Binance chain.
00:21:19.410 - 00:22:06.354, Speaker A: And then we've got metamask, which is a wallet that we all know and love and use. They are creating an API so that it could be super easy using metamask to switch different chains. You could go from Ethereum Mainnet to the polygon network, to some of these roll up chains like arbitrum and optimistic and scale network and XDI and more. And then lastly, I think, but not least, we've got Xerion, which is a defi portfolio viewer that we know and love. We had them on a recent AMA, they said they were going to do this. They are now supporting the viewing of assets not only on Ethereum mainnet, but also on the layer two polygon network. David, that was a lot of headlines there.
00:22:06.392 - 00:22:06.594, Speaker B: Right.
00:22:06.632 - 00:22:25.018, Speaker A: But I think what we're getting to is a theme here, and I'm interested in your thoughts on this. And that theme is this. We are moving from just Ethereum, host of all defi activities, to something a little different, to rearchitecture, a bit more of a multi chain world. What's your take on all of these things?
00:22:25.184 - 00:23:07.062, Speaker B: Yeah, the polychain world or the polychain thesis has always been one that has been interesting to me because there's many different ways to view a polychain world. One of the ways to view a polychain world is through the eth maximumist lens where you have the Ethereum l one and then you have all of the EVM compatible Ethereum l two s. That's optimistic roll ups, that's ZK roll ups, that's matic. And that's a story that we have here. We have a story of many different people implementing Ethereum's l two s. And those are also different chains, right? A Zk roll up or an optimistic roll ups is a blockchain with metamask. You can now select these different networks that aren't the Ethereum L one as you see fit.
00:23:07.062 - 00:23:18.666, Speaker B: And then we also have the story of sushi swap, basically spanning out, like you said, shotgun method to every single relevant blockchain that has users, right? Any blockchain that has users that makes it worth their time to make this.
00:23:18.688 - 00:23:20.960, Speaker A: Effort, even some that don't. Do you know if.
00:23:24.130 - 00:24:05.238, Speaker B: But then also alpha moving on to Binance, which definitely has users. And so the interesting story is that some teams and some companies, some tokens don't have to be Ethereum native perpetually, right? There is value in going and finding different users on different blockchains. And all they have to do, all sushi has to do is generate revenue on other chains. And that's good for sushi. Importantly, Sushi, the token is issued and relies on Ethereum, right? And so you own sushi, the token, using the main Ethereum chain. But there's no reason why these other teams can't go and generate revenue for their application for their business by going and generating revenue on binance, smart chain or matic or wherever.
00:24:05.414 - 00:24:37.186, Speaker A: At a high level, I think it's important for people to realize that there are really two separate chains that we've talked about throughout all of these. The first is a sidechain. And a side chain is basically something that is not, at least from Ethereum's perspective. Sidechain is all relative. But from Ethereum's perspective, anything that is not secured by the Ethereum main chain consensus would be considered a sidechain. So the binance smart chain would be an example of a side chain. Xdai, for example, that would be an example of a side chain.
00:24:37.186 - 00:25:27.022, Speaker A: It has its own validator set. A layer two is better defined as something that derives its security from Ethereum consensus, the value of ETH as an asset, and the Ethereum main chain. So the polygon network kind of plays a little bit in layer two. It's mostly a side chain, but a little bit in layer two. But these roll ups that we've been talking about that are coming out like optimistic roll up. The roll up that we just mentioned from Matterlab, Zk sync, those are all layer two chains that are secured by the Ethereum mainnet and the value of ETH as an asset. So when we talk about a multi chain world at some level, we've always had a multi chain world, right? I consider coinbase, Binance, Gemini, these are all sidechains, essentially.
00:25:27.022 - 00:26:03.520, Speaker A: They have their own ledgers. These are sidechains to Ethereum and bitcoin and other crypto networks. So we've always had a multichain world and now we are having more of a multichain world with some of these D five protocols expanding to other chains. I think the interesting question is, are we going to live in a world that is more l two and layer two dominated, or are we going to live in a world that is more sidechain dominated or is, as Andreessen Horowitz said in their recent press release, Chris Dixon wrote this about their investment in optimism. We don't know. So we're betting on all of them is basically what they said. What's your take?
00:26:03.890 - 00:26:28.006, Speaker B: My take is that in the short term, during the bull market, we will live in a many different blockchains, many different l ones world with plenty of side chains. Right? Finance, smart chain. It's going to work during the bull market. Polka dot, perhaps even polka dot works during the bull market. And that's because there's just more people than what ethereum capacity can handle. And so there's overflow, there's spillover. This is why ethereum l two s are also going to work.
00:26:28.006 - 00:26:58.340, Speaker B: There's going to be general spillover. Then during the coming bear market, if that cycle does continue to play out, things will contract, there will be fewer users and people will contract back to Ethereum, in my opinion, as the economic hub of the Internet. And then that will give the opportunity for Ethereum specific l two s to benefit because they are closer to Ethereum, they are closer to the heart, they're closer to Manhattan. So short term, all chains will work long term, mainly just ethereum l two s.
00:27:00.230 - 00:27:25.834, Speaker A: Maybe. Or maybe you're a protocol sync maximalist, David, and that is a thesis through which we see the world the most credibly neutral base protocols tend to win over time. We'll see how that plays out, but we'll continue to talk about it. David, this was a defi protocol that just was released last week. We talked about it on the roll up Alchemyx and you explained it. I don't think we need to explain it again. You could listen to the previous roll up to here.
00:27:25.834 - 00:27:40.138, Speaker A: But what I am amazed at is this new protocol. Only a week old and it's already got over 100 million in dai in it. This space moves so incredibly fast and capital moves so quickly. Do you have any takes on alchemyx?
00:27:40.314 - 00:28:11.202, Speaker B: Yeah, I got a take on Scoopy truples'twitter, name. Best name in Twitter, by the way. It's so fun to say scoopy truples. This is how I say it in my head. But yeah, for those, the TldR of Alchemyx is loans that pay back themselves via interest earned in deFi, right? So you pay out $100 loan and then the principal or the interest will just pay off the loan. Don't tell students about this one is the joke that I have because I'm sure they would like their loans to be paid off as well, but that's just not how it works. So pretty cool protocol and I think it's going to be a pretty important money lego.
00:28:11.266 - 00:28:29.678, Speaker A: All right, David, this is another hot DeFi protocol called B protocol. I know you talked to them for meet the nation earlier this week. I'm not sure if that episode is released yet, but can you tell us what b protocol is? And the headline here is b protocol and compound. Their integration is live. So what's going on with b protocol here?
00:28:29.764 - 00:29:02.218, Speaker B: Yeah, B protocol, meet the nation, coming out sometime next week for those that want to go and dive deeper into B protocol, basically, B protocol is like your safety net for liquidations, for makerdao or compound or in the future, aave. They're going to integrate with Aave. And so this is a response to the Black Thursday event, which actually is almost coming up on our one year anniversary of Black Thursday. Wow. Yeah. And so quick history lesson. Black Thursday ethereum blockchain was extremely congested because ether price went from like $270 down to like 120 in a very short amount of time.
00:29:02.218 - 00:29:29.630, Speaker B: Maker Dow vaults needed to get liquidated, but ethereum congestion was so high that bids weren't getting in. And so somebody was able to liquidate those vaults for $0, which was bad because then there's no collateral left over. Some people had basically their vault just completely drained. It wasn't an exploit, it wasn't an attack. It was just a failure of liquidations. And this is what B protocol is doing. It's a guaranteed liquidator.
00:29:29.630 - 00:30:18.910, Speaker B: And so what you do with B protocol is instead of going into compound or makerdao, you go to B protocol and you deposit your money into compound or makerdao through the B protocol wrapper. And what that does is that gives B protocol the rights to liquidate your positions according to the same exact parameters of makerdao or compound or the underlying borrowing and lending protocol. But they get priority on liquidations versus the external liquidators. Right. Super cool. And they actually save a bunch of money by not having to compete with miners on gas fees. And that's where a little bit of yield comes from, because the liquidators of the B protocol system don't have to compete with other miners in gas auctions.
00:30:18.910 - 00:30:22.660, Speaker B: That savings actually goes back to the users, which is a pretty cool platform.
00:30:23.350 - 00:30:56.698, Speaker A: Super interesting, David. I'm going to have to watch that full meet the nation with B protocol because one thing I have questions about is, like, what are the security implications of wrapping your collateral in a B protocol token? I'm sure you cover it there, but what a super interesting primitive just in general, that I wouldn't have ever thought could be devised. And just like the creativity of these financial systems. Pretty cool, man. Let's get to nfts. Every week there's new NFT releases. This week has been no exception.
00:30:56.698 - 00:31:21.046, Speaker A: Kings of Leon are releasing album nfts right now. That's a fairly mainstream band, right? Kings of Leon, Superman. I'm a kings of Leon fan. So they're joining the, you know, this is just an example of, of another group from the music scene jumping aboard crypto here.
00:31:21.228 - 00:31:43.310, Speaker B: Absolutely. And again, always the through line is this is a new way for artists to monetize themselves. They're not doing this because, well, maybe they are doing it because of hype, but they're doing it because they're going to make some money, right. And this is going to just be a Magnet both for capital and for other artists. Right. So if anyone's a king of like, has a kings of Leon connection, we would love to bring them on the show. So let us know.
00:31:43.380 - 00:32:11.378, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, let's bring kings of Leon on. And what I love about this, David, is we're reading about nfts and crypto in Rolling Stone. Rolling Stone. No big deal. All right, David, let's wrap up releases with this compound has introduced another chain called Gateway, or the compound chain, as the original white paper described it. So what's compound doing here, and how does it fit in the conversation of a multi chain world that we were talking about earlier.
00:32:11.554 - 00:32:46.482, Speaker B: Yeah, this one's a little unique. This is a sidechain, I guess, because it has its own consensus mechanism. It's not secured by ethereum, it's secured by cash validators. And cash is the new currency token for compound. It's a stablecoin. And so this is a application specific blockchain that links into Ethereum and other chains that is specifically built for compound. Very unique pivot, I guess, from compound that has a lot of east maxis like me scratching their heads as to why they're doing it.
00:32:46.482 - 00:33:00.630, Speaker B: I don't really get why we want an application specific blockchain rather than going on to something like optimistic roll ups like where everyone else is but Robert Leshner. And I'm not ready to bet against him, so I'm just going to sit in my hands and wait and see how this thing plays out.
00:33:00.700 - 00:33:48.346, Speaker A: What's interesting here is they built it on substrate, which is a Polkadot technology. Now, they didn't choose to connect it to the rest of the Polkadot network. That would of course incur fees to reserve a spot on the Polkadot network. So they haven't done that yet, but I find that interesting. And it basically allows you to do something that you couldn't just do on native Ethereum, which is like borrow dots, for example, a non ethereum asset using eth as collateral. I guess this is what this is supposed to provide, but I'm not sure how security works, to be honest. If it's not secured by the Ethereum mainnet, and if it's not secured by Polkadot either, it's just secured by its own set of validators backed by this cash token.
00:33:48.346 - 00:34:17.694, Speaker A: So a bit of a different take here and we'll see how that evolves. David, let's leave releases and get to the news. As always, there is a lot of news. Let's start with this one. Citigroup has come out with a paper where they actually said bitcoin is at a tipping point and could become, this is, in quotes, the currency of choice for global trade. I guess they mean global trade between competing nation states. What's this report saying?
00:34:17.812 - 00:34:46.102, Speaker B: Yeah, this report is massive. It's 108 pages and it's very positive about bitcoin. It's a huge improvement from some of the reports that we saw back in 2017. And yeah, look, bitcoin mentioned over 658 times. Ethereum mentioned 21 times, I believe. Also very positively, it's a report about bitcoin for people interested in bitcoin, but they couldn't help include some Ethereum talk because of how relevant it is. And so that's pretty cool.
00:34:46.102 - 00:34:52.262, Speaker B: The fact that big institutions like Citibank are talking positively about bitcoin is obviously bullish.
00:34:52.406 - 00:34:55.706, Speaker A: Look at this, David, I'm doing a quick search for Uniswap because I have.
00:34:55.728 - 00:35:00.514, Speaker B: Not Uniswap's in there. You talk about WBTC on Ethereum.
00:35:00.662 - 00:35:01.262, Speaker A: Really?
00:35:01.396 - 00:35:01.742, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:35:01.796 - 00:35:04.046, Speaker A: So the bankers are going deep on this, huh?
00:35:04.068 - 00:35:09.306, Speaker B: Is that what we're type in? Wrapped, wrapped, wrapped.
00:35:09.498 - 00:35:15.686, Speaker A: We got three. Yeah, wrapped bitcoin. Wow. They're doing their homework. Good job. Welcome, bankers. Glad.
00:35:15.686 - 00:35:17.250, Speaker A: Thanks for tuning into bankless.
00:35:19.990 - 00:35:23.860, Speaker B: All right, PayPal. Hide that from your boss when you walk by.
00:35:24.630 - 00:35:54.782, Speaker A: Not safe for banker work at least. All right, PayPal to buy crypto custody firm curve. I've not heard of this crypto custody firm, so it may be a smaller one or it's not like Anchorage, which is one that I've heard of, or bico. Thank you. But they are getting into the crypto asset space. They bought this for $500 million. So first of all, wow, nice premium on crypto based company these days.
00:35:54.782 - 00:36:17.174, Speaker A: But also, this is part of the Defi mullet story that we've been talking about. So the Defi mullet is finance, traditional finance. Fintech in the front and defi in the back. Crypto in the back. That's what PayPal is doing here, investing in the new financial infrastructure. It's kind of what I see playing here. I think that the banks are going to get checkmated by this kind of thing.
00:36:17.174 - 00:36:39.974, Speaker A: Because if fintech is the front end, things like PayPal, for example, or things like venmo or square, and they're using traditional banking infrastructure as the back end, if they just do a swap that out for crypto infrastructure, where does that leave the banks? Is always my question. But this is super bullish, I think, for crypto that fintech is getting involved.
00:36:40.022 - 00:37:12.438, Speaker B: Here, having a blockchain in the back, right? Ethereum or bitcoin in the back, quote, unquote, is where they're supposed to be. These things are not supposed to be in the front face of users. We don't want to tinker with Ach or Fedwire. Right? That's not cool. Only nerds like us like to tinker with ethereum, the blockchain directly. If we want to go mainstream with this, we need big trusted companies like PayPal to do the defi in the back. Defi mullet, right, where all of the UI and UX developers that PayPal employs, which is a lot of them.
00:37:12.438 - 00:37:22.058, Speaker B: They're all of a sudden going to make Ethereum and bitcoin and all these defi protocols very easy to use. By just obfuscating them and showing them the PayPal front end, every fintech is.
00:37:22.064 - 00:37:48.654, Speaker A: Going to get their defi mullet on. We're seeing it already. This is another tweet from Mike Dudas about PayPal, and this is a direct quote from the story. PayPal's crypto unit is experimenting with smart contracts, testing Ethereum and other blockchains as potential candidates to help the company improve payments and other transactions. They're just jumping right down the rabbit hole. I think we'll see more of this in the future as well. David.
00:37:48.654 - 00:38:04.566, Speaker A: Something that happens, I feel like every week we'll put it in that category is microstrategy invests more of their cash into bitcoin. They've just done another $15 million investment this week. Not much more to say there, is there?
00:38:04.668 - 00:38:26.480, Speaker B: No, another week goes by other than the consistency is impressive. And it kind of leads me to believe that Michael Saylor and microstrategy will never actually be done filling their bag and they will permanently be taking their us dollars and buying bitcoin with like this is what the 7th, 8th or 9th purchase of bitcoin by microstrategy at some point this is just them saving.
00:38:27.410 - 00:38:36.990, Speaker A: You know what this looks like to me? It looks like what we recommend is you. Dollar cost average into crypto. They're just dollar cost averaging their company balance sheet into crypto gradually.
00:38:37.070 - 00:38:40.820, Speaker B: $15 million, sometimes just $900 million.
00:38:41.350 - 00:39:03.930, Speaker A: They borrow it. They just borrow it directly from the Fed and bondholders. Nice to be able to do that if you're a corporation. Another thing that tends to happen on a weekly basis is something that happened this week. A DFI protocol was hacked. $14 million furrow combo exploited. I've heard of this.
00:39:03.930 - 00:39:10.682, Speaker A: I've not used it directly, but I'm not sure. Did you read the details of this hack or what actually happened?
00:39:10.816 - 00:39:33.166, Speaker B: This exploit was unique and has never been done before. And I think it's unique to how or what fu crumbro is. It's apparently a drag and drop defi building block system, which is kind of cool, but apparently somebody was able to trick the protocol into thinking that the application that they had deployed was Ave, when it wasn't actually ave or something. I remember, very unique.
00:39:33.278 - 00:39:45.442, Speaker A: The last thing that tends to happen every single week is the Fed talks about talking about the US digital dollar. When are they going to stop talking and actually do? David?
00:39:45.586 - 00:39:54.090, Speaker B: Yeah. Like, once again, the Fed says we're looking into digital currencies at this point. Just fucking do it. Just get there doing it.
00:39:54.160 - 00:39:55.754, Speaker A: They're trialing it.
00:39:55.872 - 00:40:23.300, Speaker B: The first time we talked about the Fed looking into the digital dollar ether, that was like in 2020, and Ethereum was a younger system then. We forget how younger. We're all younger. And it has developed way more in the last x number of months than the Fed has. The Fed's still looking at the digital dollar. Meanwhile, crypto dollars on Ethereum are through the have. If it hasn't happened by this point, honestly, it's not going to happen.
00:40:24.950 - 00:40:57.422, Speaker A: David, let's get to some of the things that are happening in NFTs, because this is another thing that's going to be a recurring theme, I feel like for the next few months on the roll ups, that is NFTs breaking new records. The musician Grimes. So this is Elon Musk's girlfriend, I believe she debuted an NFT auction. Sold out in 20 minutes, about $6 million. Got another one. Blau brings in the biggest NFT crypto art auction ever. So setting records here.
00:40:57.422 - 00:41:34.922, Speaker A: Almost 12,000,011.6 million in this auction. Got another one here. Ubisoft is incorporating NFTs into its game. So major game publishing company working with so rare, they're doing sort of football, soccer in the US, collectible cards, and Ubisoft is launching a game built with their nfTs. And lastly, well, this is Spencer noon saying that NFTs are on the verge of going mainstream, and he's got some metrics behind it. But, David, all of this news on a weekly basis, this week included, feels like Spencer's right.
00:41:34.922 - 00:41:36.806, Speaker A: NFTs are going mainstream.
00:41:36.998 - 00:42:02.980, Speaker B: The fantastic thing about NFTs is that they are magnets for celebrities, and celebrities are magnets for people's eyeballs, right? So the amplification power of this whole revolution is massive because it's celebrities jobs to be public and get as much exposure to their nfts as possible. So celebrities are taking NFTs mainstream for us, and that's because NFTs are a way for them to monetize their own labor, as we have been saying.
00:42:03.750 - 00:42:24.826, Speaker A: That's a really good point. Crypto is effectively leveraging all of the attention and all of the fan base that these celebrities have in order to amplify its mention, in order to amplify its attention on this space, Spencer has seven signs that nfts are on the verge of going mainstream. David, should we cover these?
00:42:24.928 - 00:42:37.920, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we can blow by them pretty quickly. Number one is that obviously sales are through the roof. $91 million worth of crypto art were sold in February, which is eight x the previous month. So that's pretty crazy.
00:42:38.450 - 00:43:00.200, Speaker A: The second is that there are now over four artists who have sales in artwork value of over 10 million. So Spencer says this is a sign that artists have unprecedented earning potential. Once you see another artist make 10 million on nfts, you're certainly going to FoMo into that. If you are a creator, if you are an artist. David, what's the third one?
00:43:00.650 - 00:43:16.586, Speaker B: NBA Topshop. Up to $300 million in all time sales. That's on the flow blockchain. And there's a deeper conversation as to whether nfts on the flow blockchain are going to work out. Can't settle to Ethereum. Kind of a problem in my mind, but still either $300 million or $300.
00:43:16.608 - 00:43:47.042, Speaker A: Million bringing more people into the space. The fourth is the sales of crypto punks. These are the original nfts? Yeah, vintage 2017 or earlier even. They surpassed all time sales. This is all denominated in ETH, which is another interesting point in and of itself, all time sales of over $105,000,000. So the more authentic the original nfts are doing quite well in this NFT boom market. David, what's the fifth?
00:43:47.186 - 00:44:07.734, Speaker B: Hashmax 825 hashmax in NFTx. NFTX is an NFT ETF type product index fund that allows investors to get exposure to crypto art. And there's just more and more hashmax in NFTX. NFTX continuing to be like overall buying pressure for nfts.
00:44:07.862 - 00:44:11.770, Speaker A: David, did you hear Mark Cuban call them hash marks on our podcast?
00:44:12.510 - 00:44:14.622, Speaker B: The guy knows branding. The guy knows awesome.
00:44:14.676 - 00:44:43.366, Speaker A: Yeah, well done, Mark. Freudian slip there. All right, Openc, which we're having on a bankless ask me anything next week, they just surpassed 50,000 users. This is over 1000 annualized growth. So this is definitely a sign of a vibrant secondary market for nfts. So Opensea is almost like an ebay for nfts where people can resell nfts that they've purchased. What's the 7th cap this one off for us?
00:44:43.468 - 00:44:43.878, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:44:43.964 - 00:44:44.434, Speaker A: Socks.
00:44:44.482 - 00:45:18.482, Speaker B: One of the first tokens redeemable for a real world item unit socks as these one socks. One pair of socks is now trading at $130,000. These are actually ERC 20s, but the connection is still the same. Scarce digital goods. Well, this one's actually redeemable for real life goods, but I would still categorize it in the NFT camp, there's only so many of them. The uniswap meme is extremely strong and to the point that people are valuating that uniswap meme at $130,000 per token. I don't know how many total tokens there are.
00:45:18.482 - 00:45:22.446, Speaker B: I think maybe 10,000. Market cap is very high for socks.
00:45:22.558 - 00:45:31.974, Speaker A: David. This is the one that got away from me. I remember being like, oh, I'm not going to pay $150 for a sock. Come on, uniswap. Come on, Hayden Adams. I'm not doing that. Jokes on me.
00:45:31.974 - 00:46:10.402, Speaker A: They're worth 130,000 now. Got to love crypto evolve funds files for an ETH ETF. This is a canadian firm that is filing for an ETH ETF. This is right on the heels of the bitcoin ETF that they just followed. And I think maybe the story here is that first bitcoin will get its ETF and institutional adoption. But right on the heels of bitcoin is ether. And this is what we've seen across the CME futures, across all institutional preferences so far, that bitcoin is really paving the way for ether to get into the institutional adoption as well.
00:46:10.402 - 00:46:11.394, Speaker A: Any takes here?
00:46:11.512 - 00:46:39.340, Speaker B: Yeah, here's my hot take. An ether ETF is more bullish for ether than a bitcoin ETF is bullish for bitcoin, and that's just because of relative market cap sizes. If you are somebody who's interested in buying a bitcoin ETF, you are probably also interested in buying an ether ETF. And $1 into an ether ETF means more for ethereum because the market cap of ethereum is much lower than bitcoin, and so it means more. It will push the price up more. That's my hot take.
00:46:40.190 - 00:47:13.698, Speaker A: I've got a second hot take on that, which is bitcoin expands through institutional adoption. So crypto banks, as we said, ether can do that too, though, right? Which is the interesting thing. But it's not limited to that because it can also expand as Defi collateral as well. So it's got these two paths to growth, whereas bitcoin has just the one, which I think is kind of unique and bullish Eth. There's a hot take on top of your hot take. Bitmex. Arthur Hayes expected to surrender to us authorities.
00:47:13.698 - 00:47:20.440, Speaker A: He was kind of on the lamb, I believe, but now he's expected to surrender. What's your take on this?
00:47:21.290 - 00:47:25.162, Speaker B: It's going to happen now. It finally happened. No, end of story. I guess.
00:47:25.216 - 00:47:34.560, Speaker A: End of story. End of story. Yeah. Arthur is definitely going to be back in the crypto scene. I'm sure at some point we'll see what happens next with that story.
00:47:35.010 - 00:47:36.560, Speaker B: Not ready for that to happen.
00:47:37.490 - 00:47:48.414, Speaker A: All right, David, let's get into some takes. We've been dropping the hot takes, but now let's formalize it in our take section. This is a message from Chris Berninski. What is Chris saying here, David?
00:47:48.542 - 00:48:24.910, Speaker B: Yeah, he is giving a warning to crypto entrepreneurs to be patient and let the deals come to you, basically. So let me read this out real quick. If you're an entrepreneur raising money in crypto, try to get more than one term sheet before committing to a lead. The market is competitive and flush with capital that is to your favor. More than one terms of service or term sheet, excuse me, will help get you the best deal and neutralize predatory behavior. What he is saying in the crypto space is that good entrepreneurs with good products are the scarce goods. And as an entrepreneur, you need to know that.
00:48:24.910 - 00:48:49.830, Speaker B: And so don't just sell out for the first deal, because capital is not scarce in crypto. People need to deploy capital, and they don't have very many places to deploy them to. That's also just a warning or message for people interested in entrepreneurs. The environment is friendly to you. Go build something. Like you can get money for it, so go out and get that money. So thanks, Chris, for just being a heads up play.
00:48:49.980 - 00:49:13.866, Speaker A: So Chris is saying labor is in charge of this market in particular, David, I think labor that knows how to develop smart contracts and Defi protocols. And in order to know those things, you had to be leveling up on this stuff like two years ago. Right? You could join now, but you're not going to command the premium that a Defi veteran and a veteran is like two years, one year even developing this space commands.
00:49:13.898 - 00:49:14.654, Speaker B: Not that.
00:49:14.852 - 00:49:39.478, Speaker A: Yeah, this is the value of front running the opportunity. And when we say that, we don't just mean investing in assets while they're low and expect them to go high. We do mean that, but we also mean front run the labor opportunity. If you know crypto at this stage in the game, you are ahead of most of the world. Use that to your advantage. You can do that during the bull markets is what Chris is saying here. Here's another take.
00:49:39.478 - 00:49:47.782, Speaker A: Anthony Cisano. It's really fascinating to watch. Binance, smart chain, speedrun, Ethereum's DeFi summer. What's he saying here?
00:49:47.916 - 00:50:16.398, Speaker B: Yeah, so he's talking about the crazy farming APIs that you can get on Binance smart chain right now. The crazy token movements, new tokens, new assets. Anthony's saying that it's very much like Ethereum's DeFi summer, but now it's happening on Binance and it's happening at a faster rate, which makes sense because we've already done defi summer once. And so now that binance train is doing, it's just going to do it even faster. Binance train saw BNB skyrocket in price. It saw many new assets come and also skyrocket in price. Also got their first rug pulls.
00:50:16.398 - 00:50:23.870, Speaker B: So pop their rug, pull cherry like, congratulations, Binance. And so, yeah, that binance smart chain speed running defi summer.
00:50:23.950 - 00:50:39.942, Speaker A: All right, here's another take. The EVM is the moat. While we're doing Anthony Cisano takes, this is his second take here. The Ethereum virtual machine is what he's saying is the moat. Is he saying that's the moat for Ethereum virtual machine? What's your take here?
00:50:40.076 - 00:51:25.586, Speaker B: Yeah, so Binance smart chain, also an EVM compatible blockchain. Right? And so many, many things are EVM compatible blockchains. Notably, EOS was once an EVM. Well, I guess it still is an EVM compatible blockchain. But what Anthony is saying is that because everything is an EVM compatible blockchain, that's actually beneficial to Ethereum. While in EOS and Binance smart chain, they're like, hey, you can come deploy your contracts on binance or on EOS, right? And so then they do, but it's actually just adding network effects back to Ethereum because Ethereum set the standard and everything began on Ethereum in the first place. So compatibility to try and steal users or volume or activity from Ethereum to your chain by implementing the EVM is actually just increasing Ethereum's network effects.
00:51:25.586 - 00:51:26.774, Speaker B: That's Anthony's take.
00:51:26.892 - 00:51:56.558, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. I can see that take. Although I would say it's definitely not the only moat for think Anthony's probably not saying that. But would you agree that the EVM, the technology component, is not the only moat that Ethereum has? It might not even be the strongest moat. I think that ether as an asset is a moat in and of itself. I think the Ethereum community is a moat. I think credibly neutral protocols, builders behind them are also moats in this ecosystem.
00:51:56.558 - 00:52:23.500, Speaker A: I'm not sure necessarily stronger moats, but I totally agree with the take that others adopting the EVM enforces the EVM as a standard polkadot, for instance. They're not going with the Ethereum virtual machine, right? Cosmos, atoms, they don't have an Ethereum virtual machine, right. You know, that has maybe decreased their adoption speed as a result.
00:52:24.030 - 00:52:53.202, Speaker B: All right, Ryan, on to the next take, which is mine. And my take is that I am a full block maximalist. And so this has been going around, especially as many, many people come into the space and they don't have some of these conversations that we've been having on bankless for a while now. They see like, oh, Polkadot scale, binance, smart chain, new chain, doesn't have fees. It's good. And so my take is that I'm a full block maximalist, and that means that I pay attention to blockchains that have full blocks. And that's as simple.
00:52:53.202 - 00:53:29.978, Speaker B: The calculus is pretty simple. If your blockchain has full blocks, it's being used and people are paying fees to use it, therefore. And fees are importantly not gameable. It's not a gameable metric unless you are interested in burning money to fake that metric. Full blocks and blockchains with high fees, which is only bitcoin and ethereum, are how you get a very strong signal out of this space. And so as soon as Polkadot or binance, smart chain or whatever block insert, your blockchain here has full blocks, I will start to include it in my mental models and we will begin to talk about it on the bankless program. So stay tuned for future blockchains with full blocks.
00:53:30.154 - 00:54:07.014, Speaker A: All right, David, well, you've thrown it down right there. This is kind of what you're talking about, right? So we've got Ethereum and it's kind of at the top with $15 million average seven day daily revenue. And then we've got bitcoin in second place with 6 million. But I will say, and then we have a bunch of DFI protocols. We've got binance chain here with 100,000 in average fee daily revenue. Are you saying if that starts to rise up the ranks and get closer to ethereum and bitcoin, that that will make you more bullish on something like finance chain relative to ethereum or bitcoin?
00:54:07.142 - 00:54:32.114, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a step in the right direction. However, there are issues with finance's 21 nodes, which are largely run by finance. Right? And so when finance pays for fees on finance, smart chain, they're actually just paying themselves. So there is actually a way, because they're the ones collecting their own fees, it's okay for them to wash trade because the fees, the money that they're paying, they just collect. So there is a nuance there that is worth parsing out.
00:54:32.232 - 00:54:57.050, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. But definitely your point that fees are the way you determine whether a blockchain is used or not is a good one. All right, David, let's go with this last take. I think this is Ashley saying eth Maxis, pretending this is eth Maxi saying this bitcoin is a worthless meme coin. Also, eth maxis nfts. Oh, my God. Nfts are the best thing ever.
00:54:57.050 - 00:54:58.474, Speaker A: What is she saying here?
00:54:58.592 - 00:55:09.598, Speaker B: Well, I think this means that I'm actually not an ETH maxi because I don't think bitcoin is a worthless meme coin. But many EtH maxis do, like, they point at bitcoin and go, oh, it's a pet rock. It doesn't actually do anything.
00:55:09.684 - 00:55:18.340, Speaker A: Can I ask you, I want to get back to that thing of EtH Maxis, because I don't actually believe. David, before we get here, it's like, who's an.
00:55:20.710 - 00:55:22.142, Speaker B: Antiprosynthesis?
00:55:22.286 - 00:55:49.306, Speaker A: Okay, so there's one. There's one guy on Twitter that's a pseudo anonymous account. He's an Eth maxi. I keep seeing all of these tweets about EtH maxis. In fact, I'm called an eth maxi. I know I'm not an Eth maxi because I believe in other assets that are not Ethereum and other chains that are not Ethereum. I'm definitely a bankless maximalist and a decentralization maximalist in the space, because I think those values are how we are very important.
00:55:49.306 - 00:56:10.050, Speaker A: Those are the things we need as a foundation for this space. But I don't believe that there's only one chain that can exhibit those values. So I don't even think you're an EtH maxi. You said you were an EtH Maxi early in the episode, but I don't think you actually are. Like, this is a meme that I feel like has been foisted upon a group of people without substance. But what's your take?
00:56:10.200 - 00:56:29.266, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a semantic issue. Right. Because I'm not an EtH maxi because I own assets that aren't ether. Right. And that's the difference between bitcoin maxis and Ethereum maxis. And I don't really think Ashley is, like, poking fun at EtH Maxis. I think she's just doing it for the memes.
00:56:29.266 - 00:56:58.126, Speaker B: It's a good meme. It's a good joke about the theory behind why there can't be Ethereum axes, is that Ethereum is an economy. No one is like an economy maximalist. I mean, I guess. Or we're all economy maximalists. And by definition, Ether can't work as an asset without many, many other assets as well, having value on Ethereum. And so just like this one token to rule them all attitude is just not relevant.
00:56:58.126 - 00:57:19.494, Speaker B: It's invalid when it comes to Ethereum, but it is also a very easy way to just ascribe homogeneity amongst an out group. Right? So if you don't consider yourself an Eth head, an ethereum or whatever, you'll just point at all the people that you do consider to be in the out group of the Ethereum believers, and then you'll just call them eth Maxis. And that's how it works.
00:57:19.612 - 00:57:31.898, Speaker A: I got it. So sometimes when people use the term eth maxis, what they're really saying is, like fans of ETH, like people who believe that ETH is really important and really great and that it's better in some dimensions than other chains is kind of what they mean.
00:57:31.984 - 00:57:33.446, Speaker B: But I think. Sounds like me.
00:57:33.568 - 00:58:09.578, Speaker A: Yeah, right. So I guess using that term, you would be an ETH maximalist. But I think what's interesting here is that Ashley is saying, like, bitcoin is a worthless meme coin. And then she's also pointing out that Ethereum, maximalists or Ethereums people are. Ethereum fans are going crazy over nfts, right? And NFTs, what are they? They don't have cash flows. They are useless memes, are they not? Do you see that there's kind of a contrast here or something that doesn't line up, I guess, in the way that they think of these things.
00:58:09.744 - 00:58:42.942, Speaker B: Yeah, we could talk about this forever. NFTs are valuable because there's belief that other people will buy them. There's one way to value these things, as in strictly the value of the art. But I wouldn't say that that's why NFTs are being bought for millions of dollars these days. They are being bought because people think that they can sell them to other people for higher prices in the future, which is what bitcoin is. And that's also what ether is. As soon as we have a conversation about, especially with bitcoin, with perfect scarcity, it automatically turns into a pyramid.
00:58:42.942 - 00:58:45.314, Speaker B: Not scheme, but pyramid game, right?
00:58:45.352 - 00:58:45.506, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:58:45.528 - 00:59:16.254, Speaker B: And NFTs are also a pyramid game where the value depends on you being able to sell it to someone else in the future for a higher value. And at that point, if that's the only fundamental thing about what is true about the value of that asset, then that's when people say like, oh, it's just like a worthless meme coin. It's just a ponzi game. It's just a Ponzi scheme or whatever. But all scarce assets have this Ponzi nature to them. Their only reason that they're going to go up and people are going to buy them now is so that they can sell them to other people for a higher price later.
00:59:16.372 - 00:59:57.242, Speaker A: I do think it's the case that ethereums have traditionally been like, it's taken them a long time to admit that, that memes actually have real value and that you can have things that are store of values because everyone believes they are store of values, or things that can have value because collectively society believes they are valuable. Ethereums historically have been a bit slower to admit this, whereas bitcoiners are just like, yeah, of course. Number goes up like, they got it day one. They got it, day one. Absolutely. All right, David, those are the takes. We should stop and tell our listeners about the fantastic sponsors that made this episode possible, and then we will be back with the meme of the week.
00:59:57.376 - 01:00:26.562, Speaker B: Gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange. I've been a customer of Gemini since I first got into crypto in 2017, and it's been my main exchange of choice to make. My crypto buys and sells. Gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide. And on Gemini, there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets, including many of the hot DFI tokens. And it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid Dai markets. Gemini just launched their earn program, where you can earn up to 7.4%
01:00:26.562 - 01:01:12.146, Speaker B: interest on 26 various crypto assets. If you're tired of paying fees in DFI or you don't want to worry about DFI exploits, but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets, Gemini Earn is the product for you. Another product I'm stoked to get my hands on is the Gemini crypto back credit card, which gives you 3% cash back on all of your purchases, but paid to you in your preferred crypto asset. When I get my Gemini credit card, I'm going to make sure that I get my cash back in ETH, so whenever I buy something, I get a little bit of ETH bonus back to me. At the same time, you can open up a free account in under 3 minutes@gemini.com. Gobankless and if you trade more than $100 within the first 30 days after sign up, you'll be gifted a free $15 bitcoin bonus. Check them out@gemini.com.
01:01:12.146 - 01:01:51.614, Speaker B: Gobankless synthetics is ethereum's decentralized derivatives liquidity protocol. What does that mean? Synthetics is a platform for creating and trading synthetic assets, which are assets that are priced via an oracle. Rather than bids or asks, traders can use the quinta exchange, which hosts and trades all of the synthetic assets created by synthetics. Traders on quinta can trade synthetic tokens like SBTC s oil or SDFI. Because quinta is powered by synthetics, traders experience zero slippage on their trades. No, I didn't mean low slippage. I meant no slippage because that is the power of the synthetics platform.
01:01:51.614 - 01:02:30.650, Speaker B: No slippage on your trades. You can also easily short assets with isyncs, which are synthetic assets that move inversely to their target asset. Synthetics isn't just for traders. Developers can build on synthetics to access the infinite liquidity offered by synthetic assets. Or investors can stake collateral to the protocol and earn fees that the protocol collects. If you're a trader and you're looking for a trading platform not found in the legacy world, check out quinta IO. If you're a developer or you just want to earn yield on your collateral, go to wwW synthetics IO, where you can stake your SNX or ETH and earn fees from synthetix.
01:02:32.030 - 01:02:36.334, Speaker A: All right, David, we're back. What are you excited about this week, my friend?
01:02:36.532 - 01:03:02.790, Speaker B: Okay, so I didn't want to do this because I wanted to keep this alpha for myself, but one of my favorite digital artists out there is releasing his NFT, his digital art NFT. And it has some bankless influences on it. It is a picture of this gitcoin robot, the theme behind gitcoin, and he's fighting the monster that is molok over some sort of, right, really, really cool. And there's also some trophies that are going with it.
01:03:02.860 - 01:03:03.430, Speaker A: Amazing.
01:03:03.580 - 01:03:04.914, Speaker B: It's so dope, dude.
01:03:04.962 - 01:03:07.046, Speaker A: It's so dope. This is the first time I've seen.
01:03:07.068 - 01:03:34.222, Speaker B: This and so I'm going to be paying attention to this when it goes live for bidding. And this is why I'm okay. I don't really find myself an NFT fan. I don't really find myself interested in speculating on art, but I want this for the art. I want it for the art. So I'll be fucking placing some bids. Depending on how high this thing goes, I'm probably going to get it out priced, but I really, really want this thing and so I might buy it.
01:03:34.222 - 01:03:34.750, Speaker B: We'll see.
01:03:34.820 - 01:03:41.250, Speaker A: Bad move to talk about it then in a bankless roll up, my friend, because now the word is out. When is this? Friday the fifth.
01:03:42.310 - 01:03:47.540, Speaker B: The auction goes for two days, so if everybody gets for two about it over the weekend, that'd be great.
01:03:48.150 - 01:03:50.798, Speaker A: Cut this piece. Let's cut it. Cut this out of.
01:03:50.824 - 01:03:52.040, Speaker B: It's not going in.
01:03:52.970 - 01:03:56.374, Speaker A: Oh, man. Yeah, that's pretty awesome. Great piece of art, for sure.
01:03:56.412 - 01:04:12.006, Speaker B: Yeah. And also the artist, kitty, is donating revenue to Gitcoin. So not only is this art for art sakes purposes, you can fund an artist who I believe deserves to be rewarded for their art, but you are also funding Gitcoin, which also deserves to be funded. So you can feel good about it.
01:04:12.128 - 01:04:16.990, Speaker A: Actually slaying Moloch while you are buying a picture of Moloch. That's fantastic.
01:04:17.410 - 01:04:17.822, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:04:17.876 - 01:04:18.142, Speaker A: Wow.
01:04:18.196 - 01:04:20.750, Speaker B: Good point. Good point. All right, Ryan, what are you excited?
01:04:21.090 - 01:05:00.634, Speaker A: Know this is really quick this week, but I'm super excited that we actually have tokens with cash flows this bull run, right? So we saw on the block chart where we saw DFI tokens with revenue over time. That's amazing. We just put out a piece, actually, by the time you listen to this yesterday. So on Thursday, Lucas Campbell from our team put together 14 different token metrics that you need to know when you are evaluating a token. I felt so much, David, in 2017, we didn't earn it. We didn't earn the bull run. The tokens that were pumping in price had nothing behind them.
01:05:00.634 - 01:05:32.754, Speaker A: Like no substance. This time I don't feel like that. We have a real decentralized finance economy with real cash flows, with real users. This is a big deal. And if it's your first time in the crypto bull run, if you weren't here in 2017, just know this is different. We didn't have this stuff in 2017, so I'm super excited about it. And this is something that Chris Berninsky has talked about ever since I read his crypto assets book in 2017, that valuations in this space will play out over decades.
01:05:32.754 - 01:05:48.860, Speaker A: We'll get better and better at it as an industry. And I'm definitely seeing a level up on how to value crypto assets this cycle that we didn't have in previous cycles. So kind of geeky, kind of nerdy, whatever. But look, it's what I'm excited about this week.
01:05:50.930 - 01:06:20.974, Speaker B: Another theme of the Bankless podcast that we keep on harping on is that being understood is extremely bullish. And when I hear Matt from bitwise, saying that investors can understand DeFi instantly, specifically because of live real time data that they can analyze and verify and reduce their career risk, where somebody's like, well, why did you invest in that DeFI token? It's like, well, look at this live report of all the revenue that they're making in real time. That's why I invested.
01:06:21.022 - 01:06:22.402, Speaker A: It's doing billions in volume.
01:06:22.466 - 01:06:47.114, Speaker B: It's doing billions in volume, right? And so the investability of this thing is so awesome. And yet if you want to get access to, what does it mean to get access to DeFi that gives you real time data? How do you get exposure to that? And the answer is either DPI or east. Or it's just east, because Ethereum is the economy that enables the real time reporting of valuation metrics.
01:06:47.242 - 01:06:57.794, Speaker A: Yep, absolutely. Well said. We're bringing in new cohorts into the space, and everyone is learning about it. Meme of the week David meme of the week. What is our meme of the week?
01:06:57.832 - 01:07:30.810, Speaker B: Favorite time of the week? The meme of the week is Wolf of Wall Street, a scene from Wolf of Wall street where Jonah Hill is on the phone with his boss right after Leonardo DiCaprio tries to get him into, I can't remember the story. Anyways, he's on the phone with his boss saying, me quitting my job to work for the decentralized present and future. And then there's Ethereum looking over his shoulder, watching him quit his job. And then the caption is, hey, man, have you heard of this Ethereum thing? Something about sovereign finance and lots of memes. Anyways, I quit.
01:07:31.630 - 01:07:50.050, Speaker A: Is it possible, this is a great meme, but is it possible to actually quit your job and go work for Ethereum right now? I know you and I are doing it, but to be fair, we started like a year and a half ago or so. What are the opportunities now for people? Are there more opportunities or there are fewer?
01:07:51.110 - 01:08:11.974, Speaker B: Oh my God, there are so many opportunities. And I think that the most obvious opportunities are specifically in two realms. Defi protocol treasuries, millions and millions and millions of dollars, hundreds of millions, hundreds of millions of dollars available for funding for anyone that can contribute value of any kind to a protocol.
01:08:12.022 - 01:08:19.322, Speaker A: Right? If you have value that you can provide to a protocol, I guarantee a protocol will pay you for that value in some way.
01:08:19.456 - 01:08:43.614, Speaker B: Right? And that's what's so awesome about this, is there's no more credentialing. You don't need to go get a degree. You just need to show this protocol that you can contribute value. And so all of this, four years of education and two years of education after that. So you can give your credentials like, no, the community, like, yo, that guy's doing good work. Pay that man some money. It's much more casual.
01:08:43.614 - 01:09:08.422, Speaker B: It's much more just like, buy the seat of the pants. And I think much more fun, much more freeing. And that's just defi protocols. The other side is nfTs, which is funding artists. We've talked about this a number of times on the bankless program, but funding artists and giving them vehicles to monetize their creativity and their labor, I think the design space for allowing creators to fund themselves with NFTs is just getting started. And those are just those two things. You can carve your own path.
01:09:08.422 - 01:09:28.642, Speaker B: I quit my job and my career path of trying to become a physical therapist. And I started just writing blogs for this company back in 2017. And that's just how it started. I just started creating. I just started producing something that people valued. And so if you don't know what to do, go and figure it out. Because honestly, it's up to you.
01:09:28.642 - 01:09:43.430, Speaker B: You can get it done. Anyone listening to this, you can be employed by Ethereum or an Ethereum protocol, or pick your blockchain of choice by the end of this bull market. And so if you want to, that opportunity is available to you. You just need to actually act on that.
01:09:43.580 - 01:10:32.358, Speaker A: Here's the other thing I would say is you could start this out as a side hustle, right? So you don't have to just do the Jonah Hill thing and call your boss and tell them you. That's, that's a fun way to do it. It makes a great meme. But you don't have to. I mean, you could start using your spare time, your hobby time, your weekends, your moonlight hours, doing something for a protocol, getting involved in these communities and understanding actually what they need. Do they need more users? Is this marketing? Do they need more education materials? Do they need videos? Do they need coding? Do they need some financial analysis? Any skill that you can bring to bear to help one of these protocols achieve its end goal will be valued by the DFI and crypto community and economy. And you don't have to go zero to 100 right away.
01:10:32.358 - 01:10:45.322, Speaker A: Just start, just start doing something. The midnights in your hobby time, and that's a great place to even see if what you're producing provides value to the community. First, before you go all in, 100.
01:10:45.376 - 01:10:52.554, Speaker B: Million people employed by Ethereum, by the end of the people, by the end of the decade.
01:10:52.602 - 01:10:56.590, Speaker A: Yeah. Wow. There you go. 100 million people.
01:10:56.740 - 01:10:58.638, Speaker B: Starting with the listeners, starting with the.
01:10:58.644 - 01:11:16.290, Speaker A: Listeners, starting with the bankless nation. We're going to be in the Ethereum, in the crypto economy, not only buying the assets of this economy, but working for this economy. That feels pretty fun. We should do risks and disclaimers, guys. ETH is risky. DFI is risky. Crypto is risky.
01:11:16.290 - 01:11:24.530, Speaker A: None of what we said was financial advice today, but we are on the journey west. We're glad you're with us. Thanks for joining us on bankless.
