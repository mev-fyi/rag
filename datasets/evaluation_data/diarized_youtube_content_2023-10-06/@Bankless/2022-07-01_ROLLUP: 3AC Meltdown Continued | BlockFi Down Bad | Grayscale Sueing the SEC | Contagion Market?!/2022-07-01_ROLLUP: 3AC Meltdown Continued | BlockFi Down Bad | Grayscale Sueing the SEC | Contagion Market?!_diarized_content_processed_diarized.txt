00:00:00.170 - 00:00:28.402, Speaker A: Right. Defi markets performed flawlessly transparent on chain. It all worked. We did the same liquidations that the c fi lenders did, except Defi didn't screw anyone over. Actually performed exactly as it was supposed to. It's because our regulations are based in smart contracts, so the SEC and other regulators could view DeFi as part of the solution here. Hey, bankless nation.
00:00:28.402 - 00:00:38.518, Speaker A: Happy Friday morning and happy fourth week of June. This is the last week of June. We got a lot to cover here, David. I'm fresh back from last week. I did get Covid last week.
00:00:38.604 - 00:00:39.766, Speaker B: I went to the beach, had some.
00:00:39.788 - 00:00:47.450, Speaker A: Fun, but also got Covid. So I'm a little bit under the weather, so I'll try to meet the coughs, David, but how you doing, man? Your new place looks great.
00:00:47.520 - 00:00:53.002, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks, my man. Doesn't the brick look pretty good? I got some big plans for what's going on behind me in the future.
00:00:53.136 - 00:00:55.790, Speaker A: Yeah, what are you thinking? Some little nfts?
00:00:56.290 - 00:01:04.286, Speaker B: I got a little bit of nfts, but more than that. More than that. Bankless studio. The plans for Bankless studio is underway. More on that later in the show.
00:01:04.388 - 00:01:28.534, Speaker A: All right, we'll save that to the tease at the end, but we got some hot things to cover. Some big things to cover. I came back and I feel like I left kind of shaking my head a little bit, and I came back and I'm just like, still shaking my head like, what a mess. Last week was a complete mess again. I think the theme of the episode today, the roll up today, is crypto contagion. Once again. It's continuing to propagate, but we've got a few stories we're going to chase down.
00:01:28.534 - 00:01:29.602, Speaker A: What's the first one, David?
00:01:29.666 - 00:02:02.690, Speaker B: Yeah, we're going to recap the dust that is settling around the three arrows capital meltdown. We've done this a few times before already, and the dust continues to settle. We are finally starting to get some clarity, although there is still much more clarity needed. So we're going to go through all of where we is beginning to shake out as the final part of the story of three Arrows capital. And then that bleeds right into the story of blockfi. Again, the same stories that we've been covering. But because 3 hours capital was related to blockfly, we got to cover the settling of the blockfly issue as well.
00:02:02.690 - 00:02:51.890, Speaker B: Blockfly, where it was previously raising at basically a $5 billion valuation about a year ago, is now being valued between 25 and $50 million. There's differences between numbers that sound bad, but then that bleeds right into the third big story of the week, which is that Grayscale is suing the SEC. And all of these stories are related to each other. One just flows right into the other. Which brings us back to the theme of this whole entire market, which is contagion, contagion, contagion. And really, Ryan, it all kind of comes down to the GBTC discount. And so we're going to walk the viewers, the listeners, through, like, how all of these things are tied together, how one rogue venture fund that everyone thought was Chad's was connected to this GBTC Grayscale trust, which is an inferior product as a result of the SEC regulation.
00:02:51.890 - 00:02:58.478, Speaker B: Whose fault is the bear market? Well, it's a lot of people's fault, but we can definitely name some names, and so we're going to cover all those stories.
00:02:58.574 - 00:03:34.894, Speaker A: All right, we're going to be naming names for you. Is that what you want in the bear market? Name guys? For us to talk about things that people did that were just straight up dumb? Because that's what we're going to do in today's episode. I think we have to camp on that to learn from our mistakes, hopefully. Also wanted to tell you about our friends at Juno. Juno is a crypto bank, okay? But it's not like all the other banks in that it has remained solvent. And actually, this is kind of a bank account that I think of as Defi's best friend because they are so crypto native and so defi native. David, what kind of things does Juno provide in a bank account?
00:03:35.012 - 00:04:03.478, Speaker B: Juno, I think, pretty much has the world record for the fastest connection between your checking account and an ethereum layer two. So, Juno, it's like your new financial services, crypto enabled financial services. You can get a checking account with on Juno, and you can go from your checking account to polygon, arbitrum, optimism. And then they also are working on their starknet and Zk syncing integrations as well. So that's already mind blowing. Like checking account to layer two in seconds. You can also swap your money for crypto assets with zero fees.
00:04:03.478 - 00:04:20.478, Speaker B: We love that. And you can also, in your on Juno checking account, get 6% on your USDC, or it's 3% on ether or 3% on BTC. And so the crypto enabled checking account for the future of the world, the address writes itself.
00:04:20.564 - 00:04:47.318, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. And you may think, hey, why are the bankless guys telling me to go open a bank account? Well, we're literally telling you to go do that because this bank account is so crypto native and crypto enabled. And look, you're never going to get rid of your bank account. There's always going to be a place for the banks, but this is what a neo bank really looks like. It's completely connected to the crypto world and there's no borders. You have seamless transition between both. So know you guys probably want to get started.
00:04:47.318 - 00:05:14.622, Speaker A: You can head on over to the link in the show notes, and when you do, there is a $10 back reward on your first crypto deposit and also $100 when you set up a direct deposit. Because once again, you can actually get paid in crypto through Juno as a service, too. So go check that out at Juno finance bankless. All right, David, let's get on the markets report. So what are we looking at with bitcoin price this week? We're down, it looks like.
00:05:14.676 - 00:05:27.598, Speaker B: Yeah, it's one of those weeks. Yeah, it's down every single week, isn't it? Started the week at $20,500. We are currently at $19,000. Just a few dollars above 19,000, down 7% on the week. Oof.
00:05:27.774 - 00:05:36.870, Speaker A: That does not feel good to be below 20k. That's definitely bear market territory. It's getting chilly down here in the cold. How about Eth? What are we looking at on the seven day here?
00:05:36.940 - 00:05:45.510, Speaker B: Yeah. Ether started the week at one, $100. We are currently at $1,026, down 6.7% on the week. Oof.
00:05:45.670 - 00:05:47.382, Speaker A: Flirting with that triple digit.
00:05:47.526 - 00:05:55.470, Speaker B: I saw triple digits this morning. I saw nine. Nine, 9.99. I was like, wow, that's a number.
00:05:55.620 - 00:05:57.600, Speaker A: That sucks. That's a bad number.
00:05:59.170 - 00:06:00.250, Speaker B: Not for buying.
00:06:00.410 - 00:06:02.798, Speaker A: How deep is the cut here? How deep we going?
00:06:02.884 - 00:06:21.142, Speaker B: Oh, God. You want to make some calls? I mean, I think we're going to have plenty of three digit buying opportunities. Maybe not plenty, but there will be numerous buying opportunities. There were three times I remember being able to buy $80 ether in 2018 to 2020. This is the second time that I've seen triple digit eth. So count them, like two times.
00:06:21.276 - 00:06:50.574, Speaker A: There you go, guys. It's. Look, if you're bullish on this space as we are, and if you're as bullish on ETH and some of these other assets as we are, this is an incredible opportunity. I'm not saying that we're going to go up overnight, but I am saying that probably over the next weeks to months, maybe years, I don't know. We'll probably be one of the few triple buying eth opportunities. If not the last one we ever see. But who knows? I mean, quote me on that later after I'm right.
00:06:50.612 - 00:06:51.840, Speaker B: Don't quote me on that.
00:06:53.970 - 00:06:58.990, Speaker A: Forget I said that. During the bear market eth to bitcoin, the ratio, what are we looking at this week, David?
00:06:59.070 - 00:07:04.114, Speaker B: It's basically flat. We're at 00:54 that's where we were last week. So no significant change.
00:07:04.232 - 00:07:07.490, Speaker A: Not going down, though. And total crypto market cap, we down too?
00:07:07.560 - 00:07:19.394, Speaker B: We're down on that one. Yeah. We are at a clean $900 billion in crypto market cap. Down $50 billion in the last week. $50 billion in crypto market cap. Used to be noise. That's not noise anymore.
00:07:19.394 - 00:07:24.298, Speaker B: We lose $50 billion in market cap. What is that? That's two and a half percent.
00:07:24.464 - 00:07:26.854, Speaker A: Do you know, it's still funny, though. Less than a trillion.
00:07:26.982 - 00:07:30.090, Speaker B: That's 5%. That's 5%, but less than a trillion dollars.
00:07:30.160 - 00:07:46.234, Speaker A: Right. Is like the.com boom. Got to like 3 trillion in the big.com boom. And if you do like inflation adjusted, that's more like 10 trillion. So crypto did what, 2 trillion, 3,000,000,000,003 point cycle? Not that big compared to the Internet.
00:07:46.282 - 00:07:48.158, Speaker B: Or the.com 3 trillion.
00:07:48.334 - 00:08:23.430, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Now we're back under a trillion dollars. But let's set some context here, because, David, I know we're going to do a lot of macro episodes, and I think it's worth talking about macro for a minute. Our friend Kyla this week mentioned in her newsletter a meeting that happened at the ECB, the european central bankers, where all of the central bankers got together and they had a big conversation. And essentially, as Kyla says, they were like, wow, the entire economic regime is shifting from below inflation to whatever this is. Whatever this is, is definitely high inflation. New paradigm.
00:08:23.430 - 00:08:30.590, Speaker A: And Jerome Powell was actually quoted as saying, we understand better how little we understand about inflation.
00:08:31.170 - 00:08:31.870, Speaker B: What?
00:08:32.020 - 00:08:43.458, Speaker A: This is what Jerome Powell says. And it's kind of head smacking, right? Because you're just like, you have one job, Jerome Powell, and that is to look at the historical context for this thing.
00:08:43.544 - 00:08:45.010, Speaker B: He said that out loud.
00:08:45.990 - 00:09:08.618, Speaker A: Pretty sure he did, David. And so your job is to literally understand what inflation is. This should have caught no one by surprise. In fact, there's a lot of things that the Fed could be doing. That's not to say, though, David, that the Fed and Powell are the only ones to blame here. Okay. Sometimes all of the blame going around for inflation, people are like, oh, it's Trump.
00:09:08.618 - 00:09:35.026, Speaker A: Other people are like, oh, it's Biden, they'd be like, oh, it's the war, Russia and Ukraine. It's Putin's fault. Everyone wants to blame. And the reality is like, yes, to all of the above, right? It's like there's a lot of collective fault. This was a post that I read this week that lists 15 things that inflation can be blamed on and justifiable reasons for each. Number one, Covid number two, Congress. Number three, President Biden, the CARES act one.
00:09:35.026 - 00:09:51.930, Speaker A: Number four, President Trump in the CARES act one. And two. Number five, consumers who overspent. Number six, consumers who shifted to goods. It's part of COVID number seven, the russian inflation of Ukraine. Number eight, just in time delivery supply chains. Number nine, fed monetary policy.
00:09:51.930 - 00:10:06.906, Speaker A: Number ten, wages and unemployment insurance. Number eleven, home shortages. Number twelve, semiconductors, automobiles, price go up. Number 13, corporate profit seeking. Number 14, tax cuts and infrastructure. On number 15, the author of this post even added crypto.
00:10:07.018 - 00:10:08.122, Speaker B: Why is it our fault?
00:10:08.186 - 00:10:16.974, Speaker A: A little bit funny, they just said a lot of people made a lot of money on crypto, and then they bought things in crypto and drove up the prices of other things.
00:10:17.012 - 00:10:24.660, Speaker B: But, yeah, but I would say about the equities market, too. There was more money made in the equities market than crypto. I don't feel at blame at all.
00:10:25.190 - 00:10:43.562, Speaker A: I'll take one 15th of the blame, I guess. Whatever. But the point here is, the broader point is it's not any one thing, David. It's like a whole bunch of things that are causing where we are right now with inflation. And it seems like the central bankers are still not quite sure what to do with it.
00:10:43.616 - 00:11:21.682, Speaker B: Right. I would summarize between all of those things, it really boils down to globalization, because globalization made a pandemic global very quickly. It also is responsible for our supply chains, our very fragile supply chains, and then also, like a russian invasion of Ukraine that also has global impacts just because we have a global network. So we're super global. I think five to seven of those things could fall under the globalization category. And I think also five to seven of those things could fall under the fiscal irresponsibility category. Money printing category, money printing, payments for infrastructure.
00:11:21.682 - 00:11:35.386, Speaker B: That is probably like, there's a bunch of corruption in the United States. No surprise there. So between globalization and fiscal irresponsibility, I think is like two thirds of the blame, I would say, for all these.
00:11:35.408 - 00:11:36.540, Speaker A: And then you got a war.
00:11:37.150 - 00:11:43.474, Speaker B: Well, that's globalization, though, right? Because then the war impacts supply chains, impacts oil, blah, blah, blah, blah.
00:11:43.622 - 00:11:49.950, Speaker A: Sure. So there's the bumper sticker. Globalization, money printing, and war caused inflation.
00:11:50.610 - 00:11:56.794, Speaker B: And crypto. Forget about crypto. It's bitcoin's fault.
00:11:56.922 - 00:12:33.150, Speaker A: Yeah, well, you know what? I read a great, probably the best thing article I read this week was actually a letter from Dan at Pantera. And we've had Dan on the podcast in the past. He's really good from a macro perspective in particular. And he was talking about the big blame. Maybe he would say more like two thirds itself is actually on Fed policy. So he would wait what you just said, and he would probably agree. But I think he would weight things more towards Fed policy decisions, at least exacerbating all of the inflation that we were about to have.
00:12:33.150 - 00:12:59.666, Speaker A: And two things the Fed did wrong, Powell, for some reason, and the Fed and central bankers around the world screwed this up in a big way. Number one, they kept rates low for too long. We should have been raising rates a year ago, David, that was clear inflation. Right. We went to transitory inflation. So number one, that's happened at times in the past, but that's one issue. But the second issue is even bigger.
00:12:59.666 - 00:13:24.382, Speaker A: They've been manipulating the bond market. Okay. First time in history this has happened. If you look at some of these graphs from the Pantera report, you could see, look what the Fed bought. $3.1 trillion in bonds, buying a whole bunch of mortgages. And Dan makes the argument that when you have an interest rate of 2.3%
00:13:24.382 - 00:14:11.742, Speaker A: in the US, and when home prices are raising, are increasing by 20% year over year, the Fed is basically daring you not to buy a house. In fact, don't just buy one house, buy two or three if you can, because it's all cheap money that the Fed is effectively giving you. So by manipulating the bond market and stepping in on the housing side of things, and the mortgage side of things, the Fed just pumped this thing up way beyond levels that we've ever seen, probably historically. Right? And so, yeah, we've got a lot of overvaluation to get through. And Dan actually says he doesn't think that this is going to be fixed until a few things happen. One, housing inflation goes negative. Either that or unemployment rate goes up by 2%.
00:14:11.742 - 00:14:43.254, Speaker A: So we're in a recession that possibly, or core CPI gets closer to 2.5%. Core CPI is not total CPI, it's CPI less energy and food, and it's about 6% in the US. Or the Fed has unwound the majority of all of the mortgage manipulation that it's been doing. And important thing to take a look at is this is kind of a us problem. All right. The average core inflation across our peers, Japan is 0.8%. France is 3.2%,
00:14:43.254 - 00:14:49.160, Speaker A: Canada 5.7%, Germany 3.8%. The average 3.4. The US is 6%.
00:14:49.610 - 00:15:01.546, Speaker B: No coincidence that we also printed the most amount of money for stimmy checks. We also gave out the most amount in unemployment and seamless checks. And then, surprise, surprise, we also have the highest inflation, 100%.
00:15:01.648 - 00:15:17.010, Speaker A: So this has to unwind, has to make its way out of through the system. And you have to wonder, too, this is something that you picked out this week. The Wall Street Journal is talking about this in a different way than they've been talking about it. What are we looking at here?
00:15:17.080 - 00:16:00.926, Speaker B: Yeah, they give that headline, rising interest rates will crush the federal budget. And the conversation here is that if we raise interest rates and send our economy into a recession, not only is that a recession for the american economy, our own government can't pay its own debts. And so the federal government is too indebted to suffer high interest rates. But also, if we simultaneously. That's a problem. And then if we send our own economy into a recession, where's all the tax money going to come from to pay off the debts? So in 2022, you know how much the IRS, the Treasury, is going to receive in capital gains tax in 2022? Like, nothing. Basically, it's going basically to zero.
00:16:00.926 - 00:16:36.554, Speaker B: So they're not making any money on capital gains. They're going to be able to make less money on just like other things, just because overall, when the economy is down, the economy is the thing that they tax. And so we have a recession in. They have no inflows to pay their own debts. Meanwhile, the interest rates are going up because that's what we're doing to fight inflation. And so the Wall Street Journal, and it's important to note that the Wall Street Journal is saying this because it's an extension of some parts of the world are just extensions of the state. There's arguments that the tech sector is just a surveillance arm of the state and the media sector is just like a media arm of the state.
00:16:36.554 - 00:17:00.222, Speaker B: If you just want to put this into your conspiracy, hats on, the Wall Street Journal is very close to the state. Right? And so when the Wall Street Journal is saying, hey, we need to defect from the policy of the Federal Reserve and say, hey, if you guys keep on raising rates, you're going to kill everything, it's important to note where this source is now. This is just like one person's opinion in the Wall Street Journal. But I mean, it was published by the Wall Street Journal.
00:17:00.286 - 00:17:11.250, Speaker A: Yeah. And you know what? This is the thing I think we want to find out. And I want to find out, David, we have a lot of macro people coming in the podcast in the next couple of weeks. Right? Like Lyn Alden's coming back. Who else? Luke.
00:17:11.410 - 00:17:12.370, Speaker B: Luke Groman.
00:17:12.450 - 00:17:13.650, Speaker A: Yeah, Groman.
00:17:13.730 - 00:17:18.738, Speaker B: We also have Travis Kling on as well. We have so many different macro commentators.
00:17:18.754 - 00:18:00.982, Speaker A: Who are going to give us one big question. I want to find out is, okay, so you have people like Dan from Pantera saying the Fed's got to raise rates like four to 5%. And the fact that they're talking about half a percent or zero point 75% raise is laughable because they're already like months behind and so they need to raise it to like four or 5%. You have that and then you have a conflicting kind of conversation going on saying the Fed can't raise rates or else the US won't be able to pay its interest payments any longer. So how does this get resolved? Is a big outstanding question for me that I want to ask some of these macro brains on bankless. So bankless listeners, stay tuned for that. A lot of conversation coming up.
00:18:01.116 - 00:18:14.970, Speaker B: The answer to that question probably is the answer that the whole entire market hinges upon right now. Like whether we are in a bear market or a bull market or like a recession, depression, or revitalization, depends on the answer to that question, I would say.
00:18:15.040 - 00:18:20.330, Speaker A: Totally agree. Guys, we got some more stuff coming up. 3 hours capital dead.
00:18:20.750 - 00:18:22.122, Speaker B: I've got some things to say.
00:18:22.176 - 00:18:41.970, Speaker A: Ryan, David's going to go through the full story and he knows that. He's been doing his research here. Also, blockfly lent 3 hours capital, $1 billion. Blockfly is suffering in this as well. This is crash for the crypto banks. And lastly, we're going to talk about the grayscale suing the SEC, what that's all about. We'll get back to these topics when we come back.
00:18:41.970 - 00:18:45.058, Speaker A: But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:18:45.144 - 00:19:18.062, Speaker B: Rocket pool is your decentralized Ethereum staking protocol. You can stake your EtH in rocket pool and get our ETH in return, allowing you to stake your ETH and use it in DFI at the same time. You can get 4% on your eth by staking it with rocket pool, but you can get even more by running a node. Rocket pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating ethereum nodes. Setting up your rocket pool node is easier than running a node solo, and you only need 16 eth to get started. You get an extra 15% staking commission on the pooled eth that uses your node to stake. You also get RPl token rewards on top.
00:19:18.062 - 00:19:52.982, Speaker B: So if you're bullish e staking, you can boost your yield by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pool network, which currently has over 1000 independent node operators. It's yield farming, but with ethereum nodes you can get started@rocketpool.net and you can also join the rocket pool community in their discord. You can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat, so I'll see you there. Makerdao is the OG DFi protocol the first DFI protocol to ever exist, even before we called it DeFi, Makerdao produces Dai, the industry's most battle tested and resilient stablecoin. Using Maker, you don't need to sell your collateral if you need liquidity. Instead, you can spin up a maker vault and use your collateral to mint dai directly.
00:19:52.982 - 00:20:22.478, Speaker B: With Maker, the power to mint new money is in your hands. And there's something new in the Makerdao ecosystem. Every time a new makerdao is opened, the owner can claim a POW, which contributes funds to one tree planted, an organization with ongoing global reforestation efforts, creating a world where digital participation and the health of our environment can live side by side. Soon, maker will be present on all chains and layer twos, bringing the biggest and best DFI credit facility to everywhere there is DFI. So follow maker on Twitter at makerdao and learn from the oldest and most resilient Dow in existence.
00:20:22.574 - 00:20:48.534, Speaker A: All right guys, we are back. Going to start with the crypto contagion, the three arrows capital meltdown. The story continues into this week. Here is a story from the Wall Street Journal Crypto hedge fund three arrows capital ordered by court to liquidate. David's going to go through all of the details, but just a little bit of background on this. 3 hours capital was absolutely massive during the bull run. Ten to 18 billion maybe assets under management.
00:20:48.534 - 00:21:00.510, Speaker A: It's still kind of unclear, but a whole lot of money and a whole lot of prestige through this group and now there's a complete meltdown. David, what's the story here? Take us through the timeline of what happened.
00:21:00.660 - 00:21:31.994, Speaker B: Now that we have seen the fallout from some of this, we get to start to peer inside the black box. That is 3 hours capital and all of this really started. And this behavior started at the very beginning of the bull market. For those that were here around the beginning of the bull market, the grayscale GBTC trust. It's GBTC, it's one to one towards bitcoin, but there's no redemption window. And this is because we cannot have a bitcoin ETF because of the SEC. They had to make a trust out of things.
00:21:31.994 - 00:22:16.834, Speaker B: And so you could come to the grayscale GBTC trust, you could deposit one bitcoin, you would be issued one GBTC share, and then six to twelve months later, you were allowed to liquidate that share on the open market. And this is for accredited investors only. As the bull market got underway and institutions did not have coinbase accounts or FTX accounts, they used the Grayscale trust to gain access to bitcoin. And since they're not one to one, redeemable, since there's not a credit window, the Grayscale GPT trust could have a premium. I think the premium got as large as, like 148%, as in one GPTC share was worth 1.48 times a bitcoin when it should trade at par. But it doesn't, because it's not an ETF.
00:22:16.882 - 00:22:20.486, Speaker A: It's a nice arbitrage, right? It's a 48% arbitrage right there, if.
00:22:20.508 - 00:22:41.802, Speaker B: You can take the six months illiquidity window, right? So here's what three rows capital would do. They went out and borrowed as much bitcoin as possible from the market to turn it into GBTC shares. To milk this premium, they would borrow bitcoin from some source and they would put it into grayscale. Six months later, they would have this, like 48% like arbitrage, and that number would fluctuate, because the thing is, premium.
00:22:41.866 - 00:22:43.342, Speaker A: Would never go away, right?
00:22:43.476 - 00:23:28.250, Speaker B: It was so persistent for so long that that's what people thought. But then even the most average person, well, yeah, if there's a premium, people are going to milk it. And three O's capital. Were the people milking it? The thing is, Ryan, they weren't selling their GPTC to capture in on premium, they were using it as other collateral. So this starts off by three years capital borrowing as much bitcoin as possible, as much bitcoin as the market would lend to them from any lender facility possible, which is where this contagion starts. And so they put all their BTC that they are borrowing into the grayscale GBT trust to get GBTC back. And then they start using that GBTC as collateral to borrow stablecoins.
00:23:28.250 - 00:23:56.742, Speaker B: So they're now borrowing stablecoins based on their GBTC. And they started to invest in order to try and get the alpha, try and get the premium to start to pay some of their loans back for borrowing bitcoin in the first place. They invest bigly into Terra. We all know what happens there. They bought a bunch of vested Avax tokens. Well, I mean, Avax is down bad and they're probably still vesting anyways. And they started to take more and more capital from wherever they could get it because they also have, like, loan and interest payments to get back.
00:23:56.742 - 00:24:27.742, Speaker B: Right. They get a $660,000,000 unsecured loan from Voyager, which is a crypto exchange, not a lending facility. But somehow they convince Voyager to give them a $660,000,000 loan, unsecured loan. They get a billion dollar loan from Blockfi over collateralized. I believe the numbers were some combination of bitcoin and also GPTC shares. We'll talk about that later on. So they get a billion dollar loan from Blockfi with a 30% over collateralization.
00:24:27.742 - 00:25:07.874, Speaker B: So like $1.3 billion inside of blockfly, they get a $1 billion loan, and they go and speculate on the market with that. They get caught up in the staked ETH trade, like trading the merge, thinking that the merge is going to happen, everyone's going to buy into staked ETH. But then instead of the merge happening, markets go down bad because of fed risks and their staked ETH. Instead of being worth one, ETH turns into being worth zero point 96 ETH, and they can't redeem that because that's how staked ETH works in the first place. Also, there's illegal stuff happening, too. And so the Singapore central bank just gave three arrows censures.
00:25:07.874 - 00:25:37.974, Speaker B: I don't know what that means, actually. Three arrows capital for alleged misleading and false disclosures. And there's evidence for this that's going around on crypto, Twitter, and throughout the markets. There's evidence that they falsified records to lenders in order to access more capital. So fraud, basically, they committed fraud so that their balance sheet could look healthier, so they could get more and more loans out from other people. There's also public reports that 3 hours capital allowed other trading firms to use their account on crypto exchanges to trade through their account. Right.
00:25:37.974 - 00:26:10.862, Speaker B: 3 hours capital. They had billions of dollars they could negotiate with crypto exchanges to like, hey, charge us less fees on your exchange because we're going to put a bunch of volume there and we don't want to pay those fees. And the crypto exchanges are like, yes, totally. You guys put all this volume to our exchange, we'll totally charge you less fees. And then three O's capital let other people put money into their account to trade on their account on crypto exchanges so that these third parties could access less fees as well. You know what that is, Ryan? That is an unlicensed prime brokerage with bank secrecy act and wire fraud. These are criminal cases.
00:26:10.862 - 00:26:56.718, Speaker B: And then there's also representation that there's also evidence that they represented to OTC desks they had relationships with other entities and other OTC desks that they didn't in order to presume some legitimacy to other OTC desks. So they start off with this very normal, like, I'll just borrow bitcoin to get this GBTC trade premium. They never sell, they never manage their risks. Instead of closing their risks, they just open up more loans on those risks. Then they somehow give this crypto twitter a brand about themselves that they're huge chads who make a ton of money, and so people loan them even more money. They took money in from DFI treasuries who like DFI treasuries. They raised $50 million.
00:26:56.718 - 00:27:27.654, Speaker B: They're sitting on it. They don't need to go get yield during the bear market. So somehow three rows capital convinced them, just give us your treasury and we will give you this percentage. Meanwhile, they probably stick it into something like Terra and get 20%, and then that thing goes to zero. So a bunch of DFI treasuries are down bad, down to zero because they trusted 3 hours capital to give them the yield. And so not only did they are one of the sources of contagion because they borrowed from Voyager, they borrowed from blockfly. If they didn't borrow from Celsius, they are one degree away from borrowing from Celsius.
00:27:27.702 - 00:27:57.202, Speaker A: Well, what's crazy about this is this is the point. Retail starts lending to 3 hours capital without knowing it. So if you're putting funds into blockfi, right, and you're generating some sort of yield, you were effectively lending to 3 hours capital. Now, this is an over collateralized loan, right? Of course. So people think that's super safe. But we'll talk about why that wasn't so safe with GDBC a little bit later. But I think the important point here is it wasn't just institution to institution.
00:27:57.202 - 00:28:09.270, Speaker A: This became a retail phenomenon. When you're depositing funds into these crypto banks like a blockfire Celsius you are actually giving some funds to zoo and the three O's capital team.
00:28:09.420 - 00:28:33.898, Speaker B: And that truth is rampant throughout the industry. Right? Like Voyager, a crypto exchange, not a lending desk. Customers would come and deposit their money into Voyager exchange to do normal exchange stuff. And Voyager lent that money out to three arrows capital. So 3 hours capital is at the center of the contagion. They are the contagion, Ryan. They had their tentacles in every single entity that would ever lend them money, either over collateralized or under collateralized.
00:28:33.898 - 00:28:45.586, Speaker B: And so it almost doesn't matter where retail entered the industry. Money flowed into three arrows capital because they took every single lending opportunity that they could and maxed that account out. That is crazy.
00:28:45.688 - 00:29:06.406, Speaker A: Does this blow you away? It feels like they just made all of the noob mistakes in one market cycle. They just did them all. It's like check the box. I'll think that the GDPC trade goes on forever. I'll get into terra and see if that. I'll do this ETH staking trade expecting some sort of timing. On the other side of this, I'll do the alt layer.
00:29:06.406 - 00:29:14.178, Speaker A: One trade with avalanche and all of these other things. They're just checking the boxes of all of the mistakes a noob would make to lose their money during the bull.
00:29:14.374 - 00:29:49.126, Speaker B: Right? And they made such a staggering amount of money during the upside of the market. Part of that was on the backs of they borrowed it and then it works in bull markets. And then they lost it all in the bear market. Right. And so I can't remember where I heard this quote from, but the venture firms or hedge funds that do extremely well in one cycle aren't going to be around it for the second cycle because if they were levered up on the way up, they're also levered on the way down, and they don't make it the second time around. So, like, having too strong a performance on the upswing means you're getting liquidated on the downswing. And that's definitely what happened.
00:29:49.126 - 00:29:53.574, Speaker B: You want to see the cherry on top of this whole entire saga? Rhyme?
00:29:53.622 - 00:29:54.854, Speaker A: Yeah. Give me the dirty.
00:29:54.902 - 00:30:27.286, Speaker B: Suzu has a $50 million mega yacht that is being seized. And I can't remember what the name of this yacht is, but it's some like, Internet meme. This is a triple decker yacht that suzu put a down payment on somewhere in like, I think it's the british virgin idols or somewhere who has also made a court order to liquidate 3 hours capital because that's where 3 hours capital, I believe is domiciled anyways. Yeah. So this is something that suzu still has. Is this like $50 million yacht that he has his down payment on, which is absolutely crazy.
00:30:27.388 - 00:30:46.170, Speaker A: Absolutely crazy. Absolutely brutal. And it sounds like the authorities are stepping in nation states. British virgin islands are ordering the liquidation. So the collectors are coming probably for that yacht as well. I would imagine. All the assets are going to get liquidated.
00:30:46.910 - 00:31:07.742, Speaker B: It's pretty. This is not a matter of 3 hours capital going under, and we're not seeing 3 hours capital again. This isn't happening yet. This is still in speculation phase. But this is a criminal enterprise. This is a criminal enterprise. Kyle Davies and suzu are in my mind, I'm not a lawyer.
00:31:07.742 - 00:31:12.418, Speaker B: I do not have insights to these things. Do not listen to me. They are criminals on the run.
00:31:12.584 - 00:31:30.342, Speaker A: Yeah, it definitely is starting to seem that way. And unfortunately, it's cost the crypto market a lot in this cycle, including retail. This is a tweet from Vitalik. What are we looking at? This is not him weighing in on the whole controversy, but I think he's maybe being a little subtle here.
00:31:30.476 - 00:31:55.246, Speaker B: He's being a little snarky. Yeah, for good reason. Vitalik says that there are far more honorable ways to burn $50 million to impress people than buying a super yacht. They burned way more than $50 million, by the way. Like becoming a Gitcoin grant matching partner. Here is the matching partners for our current round. So if you want to look around in the today's and look who is still capitalized and capitalized to the point of donating to public goods, it's the people in this graphic.
00:31:55.246 - 00:32:17.318, Speaker B: We got unlock protocol, we got the graph, we got radical. We got aragon, project, Zora, Figment, ZK validators, celo urine, finance, ens domains, protocol, labs, chainlink. Sorry if I'm not writing all these polygons. There ave's there. These are the people that are so well capitalized that they are still donating money to public goods. Nice job, guys.
00:32:17.404 - 00:32:48.914, Speaker A: Yeah, there we go. And you know what? This is part of the cleansing process of getting rid of the excess of greed and leverage and margin that was going on during the bull market. David and I aren't celebrating the downfall of 3 hours capital. At least I'm not. Maybe David is a little bit he's not. But this had to end. This whole spirit of Degen short term traders dominating this had to end.
00:32:48.914 - 00:33:17.434, Speaker A: And we had to get back to the fundamentals of what we're actually building in this industry. And so I feel like from that perspective. This is the hard medicine the crypto industry and everyone in the crypto industry has to swallow, because the stuff we were doing in the cycle. And by we, I don't mean bankless listeners necessarily, but collectively, the industry was not sustainable, was not healthy, and had to stop at some point. And so better now than later. Right. And I think this is a healthy thing.
00:33:17.434 - 00:33:22.986, Speaker A: Well, let's talk a little bit about blockfly, because the contagion has spread to blockfly.
00:33:23.018 - 00:33:24.714, Speaker B: You said they had one of the contagion.
00:33:24.762 - 00:33:49.222, Speaker A: Yeah, they had a $1 billion loan outstanding to three arrows capital, but it was collateralized by $1.3 billion or something to that effect. How does this even happen? How does the contagion spread when you've got a collateralized loan to blockfly? David, how does this spread into Blockfly's potential bankruptcy or insolvency right now is what it's looking like.
00:33:49.356 - 00:34:10.746, Speaker B: Well, so $1.3 of over collateralized loan for a $1 billion loan, that's sure. But crypto prices went down by, like 60 or 70%, and three O's capital didn't have any money to top up their loan. So that $1.3 billion in collateral was probably below the $1 billion loan that blockfly gave 3 hours capital.
00:34:10.778 - 00:34:34.642, Speaker A: Well, my understanding is Blockfi, there was like a $1 billion something loan. Right. That blockfly had with three arrows capital they were lending them, and they had, call it 1.3 million billion dollars over collateralization of that. A whole chunk of that was bitcoin. And that could be collateralized as prices go down. Blockfly is going.
00:34:34.642 - 00:34:55.930, Speaker A: Sorry. That could be liquidated as prices go down, Blockfly is going to liquidate that entire position. And my understanding is they did. But another chunk of that, of the $1.3 billion that was supposed to collateralize this loan was actually GDBC. And that is not liquid in the same way that bitcoin is liquid. Right.
00:34:55.930 - 00:35:24.162, Speaker A: And so my understanding is that's really where Blockfi has gotten hung up on the GDBC collateral that was not worth what it seemed like it was worth in the market. And that's the part that really knocked him out. I mean, there's other things that Blockfly was probably doing from a risk perspective, but this was certainly a big one and has led what, to Blockfi? There's some purchase talk. Yeah. What's going on there?
00:35:24.296 - 00:35:51.820, Speaker B: Yeah, there is a tug of war. There is a race to acquire Blockfi. And so this is a race between Morgan Creek Digital, which already has a bunch of blockfi equity to begin with, and then also FTX. So FTX gave Blockfly, I think, a 200 million dollar credit revolving door facility, I think, a couple of weeks ago, 250,000,000. Yeah. Credit agreement. And so that allows for users to withdraw their money.
00:35:51.820 - 00:36:15.986, Speaker B: As far as I know, users can still withdraw their money, and that comes off of a credit agreement with FTX. And I think what that means is that FTX has the ability to purchase FTX shares from the equity holders, basically from what Blockfly was previously valued at, basically free. At this current valuation, blockfly is valued at $25 to $50 million, which is.
00:36:16.008 - 00:37:00.878, Speaker A: An extremely low number from basically wiping them out. It's basically you're taking all of the equity holders of Blockfi, whether that's the founders or employees or previous investors like Morgan Creek, you're wiping them out. But what FTX was doing here is placing its debt to blockfi as more junior to depositor debt. So that means they were kind of like protecting depositors. So if you were a regular user and you had deposited funds into BlockFi, you want to make sure you're going to get that money out, and you want to get that money out before, in a liquidation event, FTX gets its money out. And so that was the benefit that this was providing. And I actually think it's laudable that blockfi is trying to look out for its users.
00:37:00.878 - 00:37:28.470, Speaker A: Maybe they're also trying to just prevent criminal charges or something like this. Right? So maybe it's not all kind of moralism here. Maybe they're actually trying to protect themselves here. But depositors getting protected in this scenario is a good thing. It's not clear that that's what's happening in Celsius. Seems like depositors are probably going to take some haircut when the Celsius dust settles. And so that, at least was good about FTX.
00:37:28.470 - 00:37:56.740, Speaker A: But then Morgan Creek is like, why should blockfly only be worth $25 million? Like, this is somebody coming in and basically scalping blockfly when they're down and they're trying to raise some emergency capital to value the company at a higher amount and provide that 250,000,000 injection. I think that valuation, if Morgan Creek deal goes through, is something like $500 million, so far higher than the FDX deal.
00:37:57.110 - 00:38:13.370, Speaker B: Right. But like you said, that puts the equity holders, current and new equity holders of blockfi above depositors. So this is not only a tug of war between FTX and Morgan Creek, this is a tug of war of who gets bailed out first, I guess.
00:38:13.520 - 00:38:40.862, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know that's the case. I don't know all of the details of the Morgan Creek and what position it puts depositors in. I think Morgan Creek is trying to also protect depositors. That's not clear to me, but, yeah, I guess there's a lot of dust to still settle in the blockfi case. But in good news, I actually had some funds. I know that. I confess two weeks ago that I had some funds on Celsius again.
00:38:40.996 - 00:38:42.190, Speaker B: Ryan likes to try everything.
00:38:42.260 - 00:38:49.526, Speaker A: Ryan tried some centralized lenders, including Celsius, Nexo, a few others. Just a small amount of funds. Right.
00:38:49.548 - 00:38:52.006, Speaker B: Because you got to keep an eye on those crypto banks out there.
00:38:52.028 - 00:39:12.650, Speaker A: You got to keep an eye on it. It's not looking good for my Celsius deposit. All right. But I was actually able to withdraw from blockfi in the last few days, and so that's at least a good sign. That's a stress test of some sort. They're not freezing accounts yet, so it doesn't seem to be. It's in as bad a position as Celsius is.
00:39:12.650 - 00:39:18.810, Speaker A: I have a blockfi credit card, too. I hope that's going to be okay. What do you think, David?
00:39:18.890 - 00:39:54.698, Speaker B: If it's a credit card, it's probably going to be fine. There's a really good article out of the block that really summarized these whole things, saying four big takeaways from a leaked investor call, kind of recapping what we've already said. Blockfly is currently being valued at less than $500 million if the FTX deal goes through. Significantly less than $500 million, we're talking about $25 to $50 million if the Morgan Creek deal goes through. Maybe it's around that. Give or take. Morgan Creek Digital says Blockfly's loan to 3 hours capital was 1 billion, and the collateral on 3 hours capital loan was two thirds bitcoin and one third GBTC during the call.
00:39:54.698 - 00:40:35.398, Speaker B: Yes, the FTX deal gives the firm the option to buy blockfly, but not if Morgan Creek can get there first. And then, of course, obviously, more layoffs may be in the works at Blockfly. It's kind of what I would expect. But, Ryan, I would like to take this opportunity to go backwards in time. About one year to June 2021, when blockfly was on the verge of going public. Right when the SEC came into blockfly and told them that they could no longer accept new customer deposits in their existing lending products. And blockfly fought them on this, SEC wanted them to close their existing lending products.
00:40:35.398 - 00:40:50.650, Speaker B: Blockfi fought them on this and said, hey, we just won't accept any new inbound, but current customers get to be grandfathered in. That's the settlement of that whole thing. Blockfly, then can we just say, is the SEC saving the day here, not doing that?
00:40:50.720 - 00:40:52.414, Speaker A: They weren't wrong about this, were they?
00:40:52.452 - 00:41:14.434, Speaker B: They weren't wrong. No, not at all. And so at the same time, blockfly wanted to go public, and so it was going to raise $500 million on their Series E, which would put them at $4.7 billion valuation. $4.7 billion valuation a year ago. Twelve one year ago.
00:41:14.434 - 00:41:23.042, Speaker B: Fast forward to today. Blockfly is on the market for $25 to $50 million in valuation. Oof.
00:41:23.186 - 00:41:42.926, Speaker A: Yeah, that's down bad. And it's unfortunate that retail has been involved. And again, it's people depositing into blockfi. You see the crypto contagion. Blockfi issues some loans to 3 hours capital. 3 hours capital goes bust, and eventually that flows back to retail. Right.
00:41:42.926 - 00:42:10.318, Speaker A: This is the problem. I think this is a great contrast point with DFI did quite well during all of this. A lot of lending going on in DFI. And when crypto goes down 70% to 90%. Right, a lot of the CFI lenders are caught, like, insolvent, and yet DFI unwinded very gracefully with a highly efficient market. We're going to get more to a take on that in a little bit. But it's quite the contrary.
00:42:10.334 - 00:42:12.598, Speaker B: Your juxtaposition is just so clear.
00:42:12.684 - 00:42:14.182, Speaker A: Exactly. It's more clear.
00:42:14.236 - 00:42:47.402, Speaker B: And as a quick, fun little side quest, before we go on to the next thing, the SEC thing, there was an article out of the block that states that FTX was interested in making a deal with Celsius, kind of in the same way that they're making a deal with Blockfly. But then they looked at Celsius's balance sheet and they were like, oh, no. No way. We're out of here. So declined buying Celsius once they took a look at their balance sheet, which is not a good sign, allegedly. According to a source, celsius has a $2 billion hole in their balance sheet. So no one would like to take responsibility of that one.
00:42:47.476 - 00:43:10.230, Speaker A: David, did you see that meme? It was like the person reaching down to someone's hand and they're in the water and looking like they're drowning. And it says FTX, and it's like, I'll help you. And Celsius is the person drowning in water. Then the person goes down under and it's only the hand. And the FTX caption is like, oh, you're too deep. See you. Like, it's kind of what's happening.
00:43:10.230 - 00:43:27.550, Speaker A: I mean, Celsius is in a far worse place than blockfi was. And so we're kind of seeing the quality of these crypto banks right now. Right. We have some that are still left standing. Nexo is still left standing. Juno, which we talked about earlier, they're still left standing. Coinbase is fine.
00:43:27.550 - 00:43:34.382, Speaker A: They're going to be totally fine. Cz binance, they're actually buying things. FTX. They're buying things right now too.
00:43:34.436 - 00:43:36.402, Speaker B: FTX. But all of a great position right now.
00:43:36.456 - 00:43:53.650, Speaker A: Yeah, they're in a great position anyway. So. Okay, what does the GDBC thing have to do with all of this? We've mentioned it a few times and grayscale is actually suing the SEC. They are the creators of the GDBC product. Can you explain what's going on here for us, David?
00:43:53.730 - 00:44:05.306, Speaker B: Right, and so the GPTC discount is something like 30% to 35% at the moment, as in the GPTC is worth only 70% of what one bitcoin is worth. And a lot of GDPC is a.
00:44:05.328 - 00:44:17.086, Speaker A: Product that you can get in your retirement account, right? Retail can buy in their retirement account. Because we don't have an official ETF in the US. We have to use products like GDPC, which is a trust, right?
00:44:17.188 - 00:45:12.862, Speaker B: And it's almost inarguably an inferior product. It's supposed to represent one bitcoin, yet it's only representing 70% of one bitcoin. And there's like a six month illiquidity lockup period for in creditor investors between when they deposit bitcoin and then when can they redeem their GBTC? So, like, a lot of capital lockup, a lot of capital efficiency, during a time where crypto markets go down like 75% on average, there is a discount, a 30% discount on GBDC and illiquidity lockup phase when people need liquidity the most. This trust model sucks it all dry. And it's no fault of grayscale at all. It's the SEC's fault because the SEC won't let them turn this into an ETF. And so the SEC rejected Grayscale's bot bitcoin ETF application, which from all the commentators like Jake Stravinsky and others that I'm aware of, say, like, there's literally no reason why the SEC should deny this.
00:45:12.862 - 00:45:40.890, Speaker B: This is totally above board, they should accept this. But for some reason, people just got the feeling that the SEC was going to deny it. And so the day that the SEC said that they denied the grayscale conversion of the trust to an ETF, Michael Sonnshein tweets out, we've filed a lawsuit against the SEC. Dollar sign GPTC, ticker sign GPTC, 15,000 likes, which is a big number. And so they also released this pr report that talks about the details. Nice. Like there.
00:45:40.890 - 00:46:37.222, Speaker B: Grayscale investment initiates a lawsuit against the SEC. We're going to court. Crypto is taking the SEC to court. And everyone, I think, in my opinion, should be behind this conversion of the trust into an ETF, because it would immediately restore 30% of capital that should be there in the GBTC token, and it would allow a one to one redemption window between GBTC and bitcoin. So many people would get much more liquidity, so many people would become much more capitalized in a time, in a place in the market where people need it the most. So, statement out of Grayscale says the SEC is failing to apply consistent treatment to similar investment vehicles and is thereby acting arbitrarily and capriciously in violation of the Administrative Procedure act and securities Exchange act of 1934. There is a compelling and common sense argument here, and we look forward to resolving this matter productively and expeditiously, says Grayscale.
00:46:37.222 - 00:46:39.674, Speaker B: Take him to court. Grayscale, go. Do it.
00:46:39.712 - 00:48:08.834, Speaker A: Look, man, look, indirectly, the SEC cost retail a lot of money because of this market inefficiency. Now, I'm not saying, like, Suzu's actions and Blockfi's risk actions caused all of this, but I am saying that there's an inefficiency in GDBC and the bitcoin spot price that doesn't actually need to be there and wouldn't be there if the SEC just allowed Graysdale to convert it to an ETF. And so it's just kind of an example of, sometimes regulators in the SEC are helpful to the industry, right? In ways like, okay, we have a centralized lending provider, we need some regulation, we need some windows into that, we need some auditing, we need some insight into, okay, so there should be a role for regulators in looking at Celsius in depth and looking at blockfi in depth and making sure that they're on the up and up, okay, that's one thing that we could benefit from. By the same token, we also want from the SEC an ETF for retail. So why can't you get rid of, help us with the things we need help with as a crypto industry, but then also give us the things that will protect retail that we need, like an ETF, give us a safe space to play. And of like this kind of silence on DeFi from regulators and almost a hostility towards DeFi, an undue hostility towards DeFi. And it's kind of a TBD.
00:48:08.834 - 00:48:41.426, Speaker A: We don't know if we're going to allow that or not. Right when DeFi is part of the answer to this. Defi markets performed flawlessly, transparent on chain. It all worked. We did the same liquidations that the CFI lenders did, except DeFi didn't screw anyone over, actually performed exactly as it was supposed to. It's because our regulations are based in smart contracts. So the SEC and other regulators could view DeFi as part of the solution here, and they're not quite there yet.
00:48:41.426 - 00:49:15.594, Speaker A: I'm hopeful it gets resolved, David. But I just feel like anything with regulators is kind of a double edged sword, because we want you guys here to help us with the scams and the clear things that we need help with where retail is getting screwed over. But we don't want you to say the whole thing is off limits and hamper the entire industry and try to shut it down and get it out of the US. Because part of the reason we're doing these things is because we are routing around dumb regulation that doesn't work for the people. That's my rant on the SEC, David.
00:49:15.722 - 00:50:08.990, Speaker B: Love it. So going back to the market section where we talked about the 15 different sources of inflation, here's the four sources for the contagions in the crypto industry. We had irresponsible, centralized lenders, both unsecured and secured. We had 3 hours capital taking advantage of that. We had an inferior product out of grayscale with the GBT trust, again, to no fault of their own. And an SEC unwilling to work with this industry to provide clarity or allow this industry to move forward in a way that protected retail investors and allowed these markets to do efficient and orderly clearing of liquidations like the SEC, which is their mandate, got in the way of that. So the contagion of crypto, the reason why it's so big, is like three or four different interwoven reasons, like some degeneracy culture.
00:50:08.990 - 00:50:32.410, Speaker B: The same reasons defi people talk crap about CFI stuff is like black box human folly. You can't manage stuff, so you let the code do it. And then because of that inferior stuff, you have like 3 hours capital, who exploits every single possible way to get money out of it. Congratulations. That is the bear market of the last six months. That's a full concept.
00:50:32.430 - 00:50:44.938, Speaker A: We're all on the hook for it. A lot of blame to be shared across all groups doing this. David, we got more to cover, man. We're going to talk a bit more about makers DFI governance. The biggest maker proposal in history.
00:50:45.024 - 00:50:45.734, Speaker B: Most controversial.
00:50:45.782 - 00:50:55.038, Speaker A: Also an update on Arbitrum odyssey. This is their latest update and what's going on there, guys? We'll be right back. But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:50:55.124 - 00:51:32.002, Speaker B: The layer two era is upon us. Ethereum's layer two ecosystem is growing every day and we need layer two bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer two life. Across is the fastest, cheapest and most secure crosschain bridge. With across you don't have to worry about high fees or long wait times. Assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously. Across's bridges are powered by UMA's optimistic oracle to securely transfer tokens between layer two s and Ethereum across its critical ecosystem infrastructure and across v two has just launched. Their new version focuses on higher capital efficiency, layer two to layer two transfers and a brand new chain with Polygon, all while prioritizing high security and low fees.
00:51:32.002 - 00:52:18.530, Speaker B: You can be a part of Across's story by joining their discord and using across for all of your layer two transferring needs. So go to across to quickly and securely bridge your assets. Between Ethereum, optimism, Polygon, Arbitram or Boba networks, there is a brand new staking feature in the Ledger Live app. Today. We all like staking the assets that we're bullish on and now you can stake seven different coins inside the Ledger Live app, Cosmos, Polkadot, Tron algorithm, Tezos, Solana, and of course Ethereum. With Ledger Live, you can take money from your bank account, buy your most bullish crypto asset and stake that asset to its network all inside the Ledger Live app, through a partnership with figment Ledger also lets you choose which validator you want to stake your assets with. And Ledger is running its own validating node, offering a convenient way to participate in network validation.
00:52:18.530 - 00:52:43.562, Speaker B: And it even comes with slashing insurance. Ledger live is truly becoming the battle station for the bankless world. So go download Ledger live. If you have a ledger already, you probably already have it and get started securely staking your crypto assets and we are back. Longtime bankless listeners will know that Makerdao holds a very close place in my heart. I think it's a very cool project. There was the most contentious, most controversial governance proposal over Makerdao.
00:52:43.562 - 00:53:14.870, Speaker B: Just happened. The highest amount of all. MKR showed up to vote, and it was neck and neck up until the very end. Here's GFX labs putting everything into a nice summary. 30% of all token supply voted, which is crazy to think because so many MKR scattered around like all of DFI, 30% of them showed up. Voting was neck and neck until the last 2 hours. The vote was to add a new core unit to oversee the Dow's onboarding of collateral assets and also form a specific framework for growing the protocol.
00:53:14.870 - 00:54:06.614, Speaker B: This core unit also came with a hefty price tag. Basically, the framework was a little bit more of kind of like a constitution, a constitution ish about what Makerdao needs to do, where it needs to go, the direction it needs to go in. And it was a pretty big turn off of its current path. And so, unlike the thread continues, unlike most governance votes, two distinct sides developed. Those who wanted to see more organization and control voted yes, which is like the Tradfi VC real world assets camp, and then the no's, which are like the kind of the core Makerdao community opposed the price tag and didn't really like this specific direction and wanted to continue with Rune, the founder of Maker Dows. His end game plan, that's the name of a post that he wrote. And so after the dust settled, it ended up being that the tradfi and VCs did not make the proposal.
00:54:06.614 - 00:54:44.114, Speaker B: They got outvoted by about 15%. So the maker Dow decided to go with a continued endgame plan. But the idea here is that there's a tug of war going on over Makerdao, and no one thinks that this is over. And so after this, Hazu actually put a very interesting thread together about his vision for the future of Makerdao. Hazu was on the yes side of these things, like the Tradfi and VC side of things. And I know Tradfi and VCs are generally heard of a negative term. Abstain your opinions on that word in this particular context, because these are crypto vcs who have opinions.
00:54:44.114 - 00:55:32.182, Speaker B: Hazu puts a tweet out that says, I just propose a series of simple governing changes to Makerdao that address many problems that exist in governance today. This includes a general lack of vision and strategy, as well as low accountability for maker holders. Hal Zhu has been thinking a ton about Dao governance lately, and so he puts this proposal into place that basically streamlines governance because there are so many things that's going on with Makerdao that everyone has to vote on all the things, and there's no centralization of decision making. Basically, it's really taking the Dow at heart. So he puts these vision, strategy, tactics and implementation categories together and promotes three different ideas that just streamlines all of these things. And so if you are into the world of Dow governance and on the frontier of that, pay attention to what Hazu wrote. We're going to get him on the podcast soon.
00:55:32.182 - 00:55:42.454, Speaker B: But basically there's a very controversial Makerdao vote pulling Makerdao into two different directions. And while this new direction did lose, I don't think it's going to be the last time we hear from this.
00:55:42.492 - 00:56:25.814, Speaker A: Well, I do think it's healthy, honestly. I think the two directions are kind of healthy, right? So it sounds like VC investors are just like, hey, we want more accountability. And our method for solving that is like, let's install a core unit, a new management team, effectively some more centralization, right? And here's the community saying, no, everything's good, we have a plan, let's keep going in the direction we're going. And this is a healthy tug of war, I think, because the other reality is everyone who owns the maker token does have another vote beyond this governance vote. And that vote is just to sell their MKR tokens if they no longer believe in the direction of the project. And so any investor in MKR tokens could do that at any time. And anyway, it's good to see.
00:56:25.814 - 00:56:46.240, Speaker A: I do think sometimes communities veer on the other side of the whole decentralization debate too much. And they're like, no structure. All structure is bad. All leadership is bad. Any kind of token mechanic that increases the value of the token is bad. And that is obviously not the right choice either. Right.
00:56:46.240 - 00:57:04.958, Speaker A: I would love to see a bit more investor action in something like the uni token, for example. I would love to see it there. Anyway, let's turn on that fee switch. Yeah, exactly. I think it's all healthy and I'm anxious to see how this all plays out, but it's playing out transparently in real time. Here's another governance vote from Lido. What was going on here, David?
00:57:05.054 - 00:57:49.042, Speaker B: Yeah, this is not the end of the Dao governance saga. Also related to Hazu, there was a proposal from the Lido dao to itself to say, hey, should we cap ourselves? Should we limit how much ether is in Lido? Because ether is like dangerously close to passing a threshold that would allow Lido to have undue control over the entire Ethereum network. I wouldn't actually be surprised if that limit has already been passed. So Lido submitted a governance proposal to itself, saying, hey, should we cap ourselves? Should we prevent more ether from being deposited so we don't grow too big? And surprise, surprise, 99.81% of Lido said no, we should not cap ourselves. Which makes sense. Right? Like, Lido is not going to say, I think, that we should make less money because our product is too good.
00:57:49.042 - 00:58:27.040, Speaker B: They're not going to say that. And so Hazu, again, co authored another proposal for Lido, staked ETh governance, which I think is really innovative and I think is a model that we can take out for other daos. Right. And so the idea here is that Lido governance will stay Lido governance, but staked ETH holders, Ryan, get the ability to veto any Lido dao proposal. So staked ETH holders don't get to say yes, they don't get to submit new proposals. But if a new proposal is submitted by Lido Dao governance and the Lido Dao governance says yes, then staked ETH holders can come in and say no.
00:58:27.410 - 00:58:28.318, Speaker A: That's really cool.
00:58:28.404 - 00:58:39.218, Speaker B: That's really, really cool. Yeah. So the staked ETH holders get one tool, which is no, you get to veto veto power. Right. And so I think that's great. I think that's really cool.
00:58:39.384 - 00:59:06.186, Speaker A: That's really smart. And that's the kind of evolution which I'm most excited about in the kind of dao governance is new ideas, like Hasu's idea here, and to see how that emerges. No surprise, though, that Lido would vote to self limit. Right. In fact, the original there, I don't think anyone was calling for a self limit. Like, even Vitalik was not talking about a self limit. He was talking about, like, raise fees after you have a certain percentage of market share.
00:59:06.186 - 00:59:23.710, Speaker A: So even the original proposal seemed kind of, like, constructed in a very binary way that was a little bit weird. But, of course, token holders are going to vote in their own self interest. David, let's talk about some layer two stuff, too. So Odyssey from Arbitrum. What is Odyssey, and what happened with it this week?
00:59:23.780 - 00:59:57.062, Speaker B: Right? So arbitram. Odyssey is basically this journey around the arbitram ecosystem, where you would go and do some things and you would get some nfts. The first week of the Odyssey was bridge Week. So you bridge onto arbitrum, and you would get an NFT if you did that. And so they were going to go from bridge week into app week, which is going to be the remainder of the Odyssey, like weeks two through eight. But as soon as app week got started, Arbitram got congested. Because so many people came onto arbitrum during bridge week, as soon as they started doing app week stuff, they got congested.
00:59:57.062 - 01:00:44.838, Speaker B: And that's because a lot of the applications that was in this first week was like, heavy computation stuff. There was a lot of. What was the app that was being used? It was GMX, which are perps and leverage, which just require a ton of computation. And so simple transfers on Arbitrum, that's not going to clog the network, but as soon as you do computationally heavy stuff, that will start to clog the network. And so they are putting the Odyssey on pause until they release nitro. And once they get nitro back, once they get nitro online and they get the arbitram, like layer two updated to this new update, then they're going to resume the Odyssey, and the Odyssey shall continue. I asked some of the arbitrum folks, like, if you could give us some numbers on the scalability of nitro, and they said a nice, easy to interpret number of seven ethereums.
01:00:44.838 - 01:01:28.406, Speaker B: As soon as the nitro update is on online, arbitrum is going to be about seven ethereums. And like all layer twos, these updates are just the beginning. And so going to where arbitrum is now, which I think is like two to three ethereums, going up to seven ethereums, nice big jump. But then there's also, again, EIP 4488 that increases the scale as well. And so there's also, like, some crazy numbers that we have. There's a dune analytics page, which I'll have you pull up, Ryan, which just showed the sheer magnitude of people that went on to arbitrum during week 1250,000 new bridge ors, at least bridging addresses, that happened on arbitrum. So 250,000 addresses went onto arbitrum in seven days.
01:01:28.406 - 01:01:32.330, Speaker B: And that wasn't congested at all, just again, because simple transfers are totally fine.
01:01:32.400 - 01:01:37.962, Speaker A: So can I ask you, David, they just paused the Odyssey itself, right? They didn't pause the network or anything?
01:01:38.096 - 01:01:42.966, Speaker B: Yes. No, network is doing just fine. The congestion is not even here at this point.
01:01:43.008 - 01:01:58.590, Speaker A: They just paused their marketing program, basically because they were like, oh, too much too soon. We want to deploy nitro first, which is going to seven x their network. So that's the reason why the pause. Why are people doing this for worthless nfTs, David.
01:01:59.010 - 01:02:03.966, Speaker B: Okay, so the simple take is that if you get all the nfts, you'll get all the airdrops.
01:02:04.158 - 01:02:04.706, Speaker A: Okay.
01:02:04.808 - 01:02:05.330, Speaker B: That makes.
01:02:05.400 - 01:02:07.310, Speaker A: These are like, participation nfts.
01:02:07.390 - 01:02:20.226, Speaker B: Participation nfTs. It's so obvious that I'm kind of skeptical on it. It's like, yeah, artrepreneur, obviously, we're going to give you NFTs so you can be on a list of people who got the NFTs just because, dude, Eth.
01:02:20.258 - 01:02:38.650, Speaker A: Is obvious right now, the merge, I think that that's what's totally going to happen. Again, none of this is. We don't know anything from the arbitrum team about any of this, but what's really nice about this is if they're giving out nfts for real things that people are doing, they get a pretty clean whitelist of actual individuals doing real things in the network.
01:02:38.730 - 01:02:41.040, Speaker B: Well, not if you farm it, though.
01:02:41.970 - 01:02:43.806, Speaker A: People are just farming nfts instead.
01:02:43.908 - 01:02:45.054, Speaker B: Right? Farming nfts.
01:02:45.102 - 01:02:56.258, Speaker A: That's a concept. I bet they'll find a way around that. But it gives a nice base of additional data to differentiate for a future airdrop, which. It's got to be happening, man. Got to be.
01:02:56.344 - 01:03:05.800, Speaker B: Oh, well, the arb token is coming for sure. I've been trying to figure this out. Ryan, what is the arbitram token going to be called? Arb or Arbi or something else.
01:03:06.330 - 01:03:06.978, Speaker A: Arby.
01:03:07.074 - 01:03:08.902, Speaker B: Arby. Arby's kind of a cool name.
01:03:09.036 - 01:03:17.718, Speaker A: Like Arby's. It makes you think it's like Arby's. Arb is cool, though, because Arb is pretty cool arbitrage, right? Arb, what is optimism?
01:03:17.814 - 01:03:18.922, Speaker B: Op. What's op?
01:03:18.976 - 01:03:20.570, Speaker A: It's just op, right? Yeah.
01:03:20.720 - 01:03:22.506, Speaker B: Which is, I think, super hot.
01:03:22.608 - 01:03:23.580, Speaker A: Could be ar.
01:03:23.950 - 01:03:25.450, Speaker B: Ar versus op.
01:03:25.520 - 01:03:29.758, Speaker A: Like a gun. I. I don't know. Don't know. We'll have to see.
01:03:29.924 - 01:03:36.340, Speaker B: I do think optimism won the name, the name debate, or the name fight, but op is. That's just my take. Op is pretty hot.
01:03:36.710 - 01:03:59.338, Speaker A: Okay. Speaking of op, they're going up, too. Trading activity surges on optimism's layer two as total locked value doubles. David, this is a layer two beat. Look at this optimism now. Number two ahead of DydX in terms of total locked value on the roll up. The number two roll up behind Arbitrum, which has $1.96
01:03:59.338 - 01:04:16.366, Speaker A: billion. It seems like the recent op Airdrop has helped in terms of getting more value locked inside of this platform. Also impressive that this is happening during a bear market. So roll ups continuing to do well even despite a bear market. Any other takes here.
01:04:16.468 - 01:04:25.834, Speaker B: I wonder if the -11% flowing out of DyDX is a reaction to their DyDX chain or if just people are scared in the bear market so they're not trading leverage.
01:04:25.962 - 01:04:35.874, Speaker A: I don't know. I'm tempted to say it's kind of noise for now, but that's going to be one to DydX. No longer going to be on l two beat. David, you sad about that, right?
01:04:35.912 - 01:04:41.126, Speaker B: Yeah, there's going to be l one beat. There isn't one l one beat. Yeah.
01:04:41.308 - 01:05:02.986, Speaker A: By the way, guys, we had an episode with Antonio where they talked about, earlier this week, they talked about their transition to an app chain for a layer two. You go listen to that episode. I have some thoughts coming out of that episode. I won't share them all here, but in the weeks to come, maybe we'll share some of those thoughts. But anyway, great episode if you want to hear their rationale for doing this eve stuff. Merge stuff. When merge?
01:05:03.018 - 01:05:24.786, Speaker B: David? July 6, something we still don't know that July 6 is not when the merge is happening. That is when the sepolia testnet merge is happening. And so that's coming up. That is the second of three test nets that we must get to to get to the actual merge. The second one is happening on July 6. It's going to be live streamed on Anthony Sazano's daily Guay or maybe the east acres. It'll just be a whole entire event.
01:05:24.786 - 01:05:26.462, Speaker B: So that's on the horizon.
01:05:26.606 - 01:05:36.950, Speaker A: That's good. Another dress rehearsal. Down, David. Speaking of down, though, NFTs have been down pretty bad if you've looked at the price of your JPegs lately, but it's not going to give you any comfort. Okay.
01:05:37.100 - 01:05:39.418, Speaker B: I love all my jpegs. I don't look at the price.
01:05:39.584 - 01:05:54.014, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. David's just here for the images. He's here for the art. Okay, so NFTs USD volume, it's back to like 2021 levels. Like early 2021 levels. Right down pretty bad.
01:05:54.014 - 01:06:00.074, Speaker A: But there is one bright spot in the NFT economy, and that is Ens names.
01:06:00.122 - 01:06:25.682, Speaker B: Ens names, outperformers right now, especially the three digit numbers. Some crazy, crazy sales have happened in the last three days. Three ETH got sold for 83.5 eth. Eight eight got sold for 38 Eth, 37 got sold for 30 eth. Three eight three got sold for 27 ETH. Ryan Porno Eth got sold for 184 eth.
01:06:25.682 - 01:06:28.102, Speaker B: So ens names are hot right now.
01:06:28.236 - 01:06:31.402, Speaker A: Yeah, hotter than Sam EtH, which only came in in 100.
01:06:31.456 - 01:06:32.534, Speaker B: E poor Sam.
01:06:32.582 - 01:06:59.902, Speaker A: Porno's got you beat, Sam. Sorry, but yeah. Look at these numbers, man. May was like the biggest month ever for Ens and June looks like it's going to be strong too, so pretty impressive. All the while, Michael Saylor continues to dollar cost average into bitcoin in the bear market. He hasn't stopped. It's probably a better time to actually buy the bitcoin at this point in time, but he just purchased another $10 million of bitcoin.
01:06:59.902 - 01:07:09.510, Speaker A: David, are you getting concerned that sailor owns too much bitcoin at this point? He's got to be close to 1% of the entire bitcoin supply.
01:07:10.570 - 01:07:26.086, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay. 1% is 210,000 and he's got 130,000. He's still got a ways to go for 1%. The only thing I see when I see Michael Taylor buying more bitcoin is like, dude, you spent all of your ammo at the like, that's not dollar cost averaging.
01:07:26.118 - 01:07:37.658, Speaker A: He's just like putting in his expand your time horizon. The top of what? Not the top of the decade. Okay. Just a local top. It's just a local top, my friend. You can't time these things. You got a dollar cost average.
01:07:37.754 - 01:08:04.294, Speaker B: A kind of a useful website. Ryan, you might want to pull this up while I talk about this is bitcointresurries. Net. And so this can just show you people and the treasuries of people around the world and how much bitcoin they have and what they bought it out. The cost basis for microstrategy is basically $4 billion. They've taken $4 billion USD and bought it and bought bitcoin with that, which is currently valued at today's dollars at $2.4 billion.
01:08:04.294 - 01:08:13.994, Speaker B: So they have lost $1.5 billion on their bitcoin trade. They have down 40%. And then you can see how much of the. Of the 21 million they have, they have. That's not bad.
01:08:14.032 - 01:08:15.500, Speaker A: I've been down worse than this.
01:08:15.870 - 01:08:19.100, Speaker B: Good job. 40% or $1.5 billion?
01:08:20.910 - 01:08:42.398, Speaker A: Definitely the former. All right. I've been down worse than 40%. I know people are making fun of him now. I do think this trade is ultimately going to pay off really well when you zoom out. And the capital he's getting is kind of basically free publicly traded company. He's taking these loans at very low fed interest rates.
01:08:42.398 - 01:08:52.566, Speaker A: I know that's not what microstrategy should probably be doing directionally. Right. Their business analytics firm, but it's probably going to pay off for them. I still think this.
01:08:52.668 - 01:09:02.838, Speaker B: I just see the $10 million is a drop in the bucket on their $2.5 billion position, which started at $4 billion. Like, you should have saved your ammo, dude.
01:09:03.014 - 01:09:08.406, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, that's what everyone says, right? Can't time these things, sailor.
01:09:08.438 - 01:09:11.546, Speaker B: I still support you buying this to myself, too, don't get me wrong.
01:09:11.648 - 01:09:57.226, Speaker A: Yeah, keep buying the dip, sailor. Maybe you could reverse things for us, David. This is a tweet from Naraj from Coin center. And just with the crypto industry's attention to this, I thought this is an interesting story. Chinese officials are using the COVID health code system to stop a bank run. They turned all would be withdrawals codes red before they could get to the bank, effectively unpersoning them. So what was happening in the banking system in China? What's been happening is rather than suffer a bank run where individual citizens were going to the bank to try to withdraw funds, the banking system would just give them a Covid code, a Covid red code.
01:09:57.328 - 01:09:59.626, Speaker B: You are COVID positive you cannot leave your house.
01:09:59.728 - 01:10:44.758, Speaker A: Exactly. Cannot leave the house and effectively excommunicate to you from the social system, but also the financial system. So cutting off your bank access that way in order to prevent a bank run, this, my friends, is very terrifying. This is scary. This is the reason we can't have the nation states in control of the banking system and in control of the money supply. And with a bureaucrat's ability to just press a button and eliminate you from the economy, why to stop a bank run? Who knows? Who knows what the why will be in the future? Maybe because you have different political persuasions, maybe you voted a different way. Maybe you've said something publicly on tv.
01:10:44.758 - 01:11:01.710, Speaker A: This is very terrifying to me. And I think I am most alarmed that countries in the west are actually embracing similar capabilities. This is what, a centrally administered central bank digital currency. This is actually the power that that gives.
01:11:01.860 - 01:11:23.874, Speaker B: They wouldn't even need to deem people as COVID positive. They would just skip that step and just go straight to like, no, you can't have your money. There's a quote from this article, says, the news about the health codes has gone viral on China's social media platforms. Sooner or later, this sort of thing is going to happen to all of us. Wake up, people. One user wrote. National pandemic prevention policy has been reduced to a private weapon.
01:11:23.874 - 01:11:33.146, Speaker B: Said another, this is the height of expansion of power, ideological decay and evil influence. Oof. Oof. Guys, coming to a CBDC near you.
01:11:33.248 - 01:11:51.710, Speaker A: The end of the decade. We're only going to have two types of money. There's going to be state surveillance controlled money, and there's going to be free money. It's all going to be digital. The only free money available will not be cash anymore. It will just be crypto. So you got crypto and centrally controlled money, and those are the two options.
01:11:51.710 - 01:12:00.754, Speaker A: This is why we need to preserve crypto as an option. You hear that from us every time on bankless. David, there was a bridge hack this week, too. We got to cover that real quick. What happened?
01:12:00.872 - 01:12:11.000, Speaker B: Yeah, harmony to Ethereum Bridge. $100 million was stolen in another bridge hack. I mean, we've been here before, Ryan. You want to know who was behind it?
01:12:12.330 - 01:12:12.790, Speaker A: Who?
01:12:12.860 - 01:12:25.980, Speaker B: Isn't it North Korea? North Korea. It was North Korea. Yeah. Once again, North Korea hacked a bridge and now has all the money. Does not look good when half of this industry's hacks end up in.
01:12:27.710 - 01:12:49.394, Speaker A: You know, the. It was interesting in our conversation earlier this week with Matthew Green, how he said he was having conversations with U. S. National defense, and they were like, hey, how can we come help the crypto industry to prevent hacks from these happening? Because every time North Korea goes and hacks something, they get more funding for their government to go, I don't know.
01:12:49.432 - 01:12:50.834, Speaker B: What, do whatever they do.
01:12:50.872 - 01:12:59.878, Speaker A: Nuclear weapons or something like this. So these hacks actually become a national security risk. Interestingly enough, crazy angle on that.
01:12:59.964 - 01:13:03.320, Speaker B: Use a layer two, prevent nuclear war. Is that a fair take?
01:13:04.010 - 01:13:17.882, Speaker A: That might be a stretch. David. There's something there. Maybe there's a future article. David Hoffman article about this digital wallet maker dynamic raises $7.5 million. Good to see a raise still coming through in the bear market.
01:13:17.882 - 01:13:19.530, Speaker A: Anything special about this one?
01:13:19.680 - 01:13:53.906, Speaker B: Yeah, this is something that, for those that pay attention to crypto, Twitter, Nick Carter and Castle Iron Ventures raised, put money into this round, an Ethereum wallet that has digital identity features baked into it. And he got absolutely hounded by the bitcoin community, like the cyber hornets, just because from their culture you don't touch anything that's not bitcoin. And so Nick Carter, the blasphemous sinning Nick Carter touched something Ethereum, and now he's being excommunicated from the cyber hornet culture. Just a small peek into the window of bitcoin maximalism.
01:13:54.018 - 01:13:57.314, Speaker A: Did you read his post? Bitcoin maximalism is dead is bank?
01:13:57.362 - 01:14:00.118, Speaker B: No, I haven't, but I feel like I could already know it.
01:14:00.204 - 01:14:04.922, Speaker A: Yeah, I think he's over it, man. He's over bitcoin maximalism for sure. As am I. As are you.
01:14:04.976 - 01:14:06.380, Speaker B: Always have been.
01:14:07.230 - 01:14:36.430, Speaker A: Still, even in a bear market. All right, this is an incredible time to get a job in crypto because crypto is still hiring. There was a lot of money created and raised during the bull market and good firms are still hiring. Here are a few firms. I will read them out and their job opening number one, Alliance Dow CTO Alliance Dow software engineer Alliance Dao is also looking for an executive assistant. Go check that out. Otterspace is looking for a solidity engineer.
01:14:36.430 - 01:14:55.334, Speaker A: Abstract ventures, a front end engineer. Boolean Labs looking for a founder and web three for their web three community analytics platform and a CEO. That's a big one. Bankless was still looking at Twitter specialist resumes. Blockchain capital wants a research engineer. Swell network, a tech lead. Go check out all of those roles.
01:14:55.382 - 01:14:57.578, Speaker B: There's so many more jobs board. So many more.
01:14:57.664 - 01:15:11.758, Speaker A: That's the place. Bankless palette.com slash jobs guys, we'll be right back. Come back with hot questions from the bankless nation, as well as some hot takes from Twitter. We'll get right back to that. But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
01:15:11.844 - 01:15:52.614, Speaker B: Arbitram is an Ethereum layer two scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use DFI and nfts. Some of the coolest new NFT collections have chosen arbitrum as their home, while DFI protocols continue to see increased liquidity and usage. You can now bridge straight into arbitrum from more than ten different exchanges, including finance, FTX, Huobi, and crypto.com. Once on Arbitrum, you'll enjoy fast transactions with cheap fees, allowing you to explore new frontiers of the crypto universe. New to Arbitrum for a limited time, you can get arbitrum nfts, designed by the famous artists Ratwell and Sugoy, for joining the Arbitrum Odyssey. The Odyssey is an eight week long event where you complete on chain activities and receive a free NFT as a reward. Find out more by visiting the Discord at Discord GG Slash Arbitrum.
01:15:52.614 - 01:16:25.986, Speaker B: You can also bridge your assets to Arbitram at Bridge Arbitram IO and access all of Arbitram's apps at Portal Arbitram one in order to experience DFI and nfts the way it was always meant to be. Fast, cheap, secure, and fiction free. The Brave browser is the user first browser for the web three Internet with over 60 million monthly active users. And inside the Brave browser, you'll find the brave wallet, the secure, multitrain crypto wallet built right into the browser. Web three is freedom from Big Tech and Wall street, more control and better privacy. But there's a weak point in web three. Your crypto wallet and most crypto wallets are browser extensions, which can easily be spoofed.
01:16:25.986 - 01:16:53.626, Speaker B: But the brave wallet is different. No extensions are required, which gives brave browser an extra level of security versus other wallets. Brave Wallet is your secure passport for the possibilities of web three and supports multiple chains, including Ethereum and Salana. You can even buy crypto directly inside the wallet with ramp. And of course, you can store, send, and swap your crypto assets, manage your nfts, and connect to other wallets and defi apps. So whether you're new to crypto or you're a seasoned pro, it's time to ditch those risky extensions. And it's time to switch to the brave wallet.
01:16:53.626 - 01:17:28.140, Speaker B: Download brave@brave.com slash bankless and click the wallet icon to get started. Question time questions from the nation a tweet goes out of the bankless Twitter account every single Wednesday, and it says, what question do you have for Ryan and David? Let us know. We'll talk about it. Every time I put this agenda together in the mornings, I go and check out all the hot questions and I grab some of the hottest ones that everyone seems to want asked. So we got two of them this week. Dan Scott says, does bridging ether to a layer two have similar risks as bridging ether to an alternative layer one like Salana or avalanche? Ryan, you want to take this one?
01:17:28.750 - 01:17:55.618, Speaker A: Sure. I would say it depends. It depends on the bridge that you're using. But one benefit if you're kind of, like, into visuals, one benefit that a roll up has versus an alternative layer one is it has a trustless, immutable bridge that cannot be destroyed. Okay, so it's a bridge that works regardless of any security dependencies on the chain itself. On the layer two itself. Right.
01:17:55.618 - 01:18:07.350, Speaker A: So if you're picturing kind of bridges in your mind, the other bridges routes around to layer twos and to alternative layer ones. These bridges can be destroyed.
01:18:09.050 - 01:18:09.570, Speaker B: These can.
01:18:09.580 - 01:18:48.762, Speaker A: Crumble, these can fall if some of the security assumptions on the other chain go by the wayside. But a roll up always preserves a bridge where you can always withdraw your funds back to Ethereum. And that is why a roll up is a roll up, because it doesn't have dependencies that are external to Ethereum for your security. So there's always that bridge. But there are some bridges you can take to these chains that are also like Multisig and don't have those same security assurances. So you have to be sort of careful and cautious as far as which bridge you're using to transmit your funds onto the layer two, I think there's.
01:18:48.766 - 01:19:43.250, Speaker B: A decent amount of semantics confusion that goes around here. When we bridge from one layer one like Ethereum, to another layer one like salon or avalanche, there's no actual bridge being built. It's not like something you go across and you transport your ether from one side to the other. You put your ether into one contract on Ethereum, and then somebody else on the Solana or avalanche or other layer one application is looking and observing that contract and saying, oh, they submitted some ether here, I will mint them an IOU on the other side. So it's a little bit more like a teleporter, and you have a central operator teleporting you with an IOU. And if the teleporter breaks, your iou on the other side is worthless. With a layer two on Ethereum, there is something like a canonical bridge, a cryptographic bridge, that has much stronger assurances, that doesn't actually have to operate on what is usually a multi sig.
01:19:43.250 - 01:20:13.038, Speaker B: And so you have just an extra layer of risk removed. Because the layer two bridges, they don't have to make their own independent blockchain. They are giving up their independence in the name of security and having an actual. It's still not an actual bridge because at the end of the day, the metaphor breaks down. But you have strong cryptographic assurances that the bridge will always be there. And if the bridge isn't there, then the whole network's not there. So, like, Solana can go up and stay up, ethereum can go up and stay up, and that bridge can go down.
01:20:13.038 - 01:20:24.900, Speaker B: But on a layer two, if the bridge goes down, the whole network is going down. Right. And so the layer two network on Ethereum cannot stay up while the bridge is down. That doesn't work.
01:20:26.070 - 01:20:46.554, Speaker A: A bridge of last resort on the l two s. So it's less risky, is, I guess the short answer, bridging to a layer two. And that is essentially the point. Okay, so here's another question for us, David. What are some of the best daps that you can recommend to help beginners start living a crypto native life, a bankless life? David, what do you recommend?
01:20:46.672 - 01:21:11.780, Speaker B: Yeah, I put some of my favorites. You know, if you're going to go into the world of the bankless nation, if you're going to go into the metaverse, you need a name, you need your new metaverse name. And so you got to go get an. So go like, just like how you, when you sign into Instagram, sign into Twitter, whatever, and you make a new handle. When you're going into the metaverse, you need an ens name. So go get porno. Somebody got porno eth? Maybe not that one.
01:21:11.780 - 01:21:38.346, Speaker B: So once you get your metaverse name, I think the next coolest thing you can do is you can take some of your ether, you can put it into makerdao, and you can literally mint money. That is the cool thing about crypto. You can mint money, and then you can take that money, put one ether into maker dow, make sure you're measuring the gas fees, put one ether into makerdao, mint some dai, put that dye on a layer two, and then you've done some really cool stuff. And that's what I would say where.
01:21:38.368 - 01:22:29.782, Speaker A: I would start with, I think that's great. I think that the path to going bankless is like, number one, you have to start taking custody of your own keys, right? So it's the move from an exchange to actually taking custody of your keys. Whether you're doing that in a smart contract wallet, like an argent or something, a hardware device, like ledger, or for small bits of money, maybe metamask, something like that, you have to go through that step. But once you're on the other side of that, I think about still like, the money verbs that we've talked about so often. What are the things you want to do with your financial life in a typical banking system? Well, one thing you want to do is save your money and invest, and I can think of no better investment, my friend, and saving mechanism. For the long run, it's going to be volatile in USD and ups and down than something like eth. Okay? And maybe after that, a basket of some other tokens.
01:22:29.782 - 01:22:53.010, Speaker A: But you definitely want to have eth that you don't spend. All right? You also need some eth for gas, but eth that you don't spend. So that's like a store of value type use case. And once you have that payment, use case. Stablecoins are amazing. Dude, I could send money to anyone in the world for like fractions of a Penny, okay? And it can be any amount of money. This is so freeing and so cool.
01:22:53.010 - 01:23:15.740, Speaker A: And it's something that you should learn how to do. Whether you're using USDC or Dai, having some stablecoins in your crypto reserves is kind of cool. Then you can use something like pool together, which is like a fun defi savings type tool. That's a really interesting starter application in Defi. Go check that out. Pool together, and you can deposit your funds. Actually save your money.
01:23:15.740 - 01:23:27.066, Speaker A: It's called the no loss lottery. They have a system, know, rewards various people based on the pool size. It's really cool. Just check it out. It's a good first app. If you're lending and borrowing. Ave is fantastic.
01:23:27.066 - 01:23:49.954, Speaker A: And then trading, of course, like, go check out uniswap. So we got storing value, basic payments, savings, lending, and trading. And that's a good place to start because you just knocked off, like, five of the different money verbs that you're going to need for a crypto native bankless life. From there, you can do all sorts of other things, but that's where I would start. David, let's get to some takes of the week, man.
01:23:49.992 - 01:23:50.526, Speaker B: Takes for the week.
01:23:50.568 - 01:23:55.030, Speaker A: So here's a take from you, my friend. This is all about CFI versus DeFi.
01:23:55.370 - 01:24:22.078, Speaker B: I say CFI lenders are blowing up specifically due to the properties of centralization. They're black boxes. You got to trust them to withdraw your assets, and they're subject to human folly, human decision making. Not only now do DeFi lenders have fewer competitors because, like, a few of them have blown up, but their competitive edge is now proven and legitimized. CFI is fragile and unstable. DFI is robust and stable. And so I think it's that last line.
01:24:22.078 - 01:24:37.474, Speaker B: DeFi has fewer competitors because all the CFI things blew up. They blew up because of the properties of centralization in the first place. So now, not only do they have less competition, but their differentiation is justified and proven out in the market. And I think that's awesome.
01:24:37.672 - 01:25:13.854, Speaker A: I totally agree with you. And I think another lens on this, this is something I tweeted out, is for regulators, and I said this, regulators around the world should be watching DFI protocols closely to congratulate them, all right? Because DFI provided a fair, orderly, and transparent drawdown during the 70% to 90% downturn we've just seen while its CFI peers went bust. You want to regulate crypto? DFI? Is crypto regulation self regulation? Commenter on this tweet said, yeah, that's effectively what a smart contract is. It's regulations written into code.
01:25:13.972 - 01:25:23.298, Speaker B: That's what we're doing. That's the whole point. The EVM is the regulator for, like, that's the whole thing that makes it what it is.
01:25:23.464 - 01:25:47.450, Speaker A: Exactly. Smart contracts are simply self regulating and self enforcing themselves. This is where regulators can lend a hand is maybe they need some smart contract auditors on their team. Maybe they want to spin up some transparency dashboards. This is where DeFi can use your help. Not to say that we're getting rid of all defi anyway. Don't know how many regulators list in bankless, but that's our message to them.
01:25:47.450 - 01:25:50.090, Speaker A: Here's another take, David, from Aubrey. What's she saying?
01:25:50.160 - 01:25:56.560, Speaker B: Yeah, Aubrey. The first time we got an Aubrey take in, here she goes, SBF will own everything, and you'll be happy.
01:25:57.330 - 01:25:58.606, Speaker A: Why is she saying this?
01:25:58.708 - 01:26:15.970, Speaker B: Because SBF is, like, buying up everything. He's like the lender of last resort. He's, like, trying to buy FTX. They provide a credit window for a bunch of other things. SBF and Alameda and all these people that were capitalized during the bull market and had a lot of stables are now looking at some pretty sweet deals right now.
01:26:16.040 - 01:26:29.522, Speaker A: I don't think this is a fair tweet, David, because CZ is going to own at least some of this, too, not just SB. We're having CZ on the podcast tomorrow, so we're going to ask him about the CZ of binance, of course, today for the listeners.
01:26:29.586 - 01:26:33.094, Speaker B: Actually, it's probably going on right now as you listen to it. Okay.
01:26:33.212 - 01:26:34.122, Speaker A: Listen to the roll up.
01:26:34.176 - 01:27:07.330, Speaker B: I really liked this take. I really like this take. This is kind of a snarky way that also is really educational as to how optimistic rollups work. Kobe Gerkam says the security of optimistic roll ups is based on the fact that people will, with great zeal, strive to prove that somebody is wrong on the Internet. This is how a fraud proof works. If you do something fraudulent in an optimistic roll up, you can get away with it. But the way that security of these optimistic roll ups work is like, as soon as somebody's doing something fraudulent, somebody is out there going to prove that.
01:27:07.330 - 01:27:19.314, Speaker B: And so, security of optimistic roll ups, based on the fact that the Internet people like to prove that other people are wrong, and if they do, they get rewarded. So that is a little quick lesson in how optimistic roll ups are secured.
01:27:19.442 - 01:27:52.660, Speaker A: Everyone becomes an auditor. That's the model we're moving towards. This is a take from Bartek Eth. Being an ethereum roll up is like having the strongest army in the world securing your estate, becoming cosmos chain. You are now protected by your token holders, unless you use interchange security, an upcoming feature which case you pay atom holders for protection. I think this is probably background commentary on DydX's move from a starware rollup to its own app chain. And I know you and I commented on this after the show.
01:27:52.660 - 01:28:18.934, Speaker A: We have a ton of respect for Antonio as a builder, built something phenomenal with DydX, but it also seems like it's going to be a lot of work for them to spin up everything necessary for a layer one chain. And kind of the analogy to me is like, you want to start a butcher shop, and so you're founding a country in order to do that. I was like, why not just park your butcher shop in a country that already exists?
01:28:18.982 - 01:28:20.860, Speaker B: Because then you mainstream up your own.
01:28:21.170 - 01:28:50.594, Speaker A: Military and tax code system and money system and monetary policy and defense network and legal. It seems like a lot less work, and I think it is. And so this is a comment on that. I do think that there's obviously room for all sorts of chains to spin up, but what they are spinning up is sophisticated nation state type of economies. And I think that's more difficult to do than some people assume.
01:28:50.722 - 01:28:56.710, Speaker B: I think that's exactly right, and I think that is the loss of the takes. Ryan, should we get into what we're excited about?
01:28:56.860 - 01:28:59.270, Speaker A: Yeah, what are you excited about? What are you bullish on?
01:28:59.340 - 01:29:03.050, Speaker B: Do you see this awesome brick background behind me, Ryan?
01:29:03.630 - 01:29:06.554, Speaker A: I do. It's amazing. It looks like you got a ton of room there, right?
01:29:06.592 - 01:29:22.590, Speaker B: Yeah. So look at all this space. And my desk is in the middle of this space. Let's see if I can zoom out. It starts off as a blank brick background, but it's going to change in the future, Ryan. And I'm not just talking about me putting up my nfts on the wall.
01:29:22.740 - 01:29:24.190, Speaker A: That's what people are envisioning.
01:29:24.610 - 01:29:32.446, Speaker B: I'm sure that's what they're envisioning. It's going to change. Bankless studio is going to become a thing. I got some plans. I got some plans.
01:29:32.638 - 01:29:36.290, Speaker A: Live studio for live podcasts. That's what you're talking about, right? This is what this.
01:29:36.360 - 01:29:47.880, Speaker B: Yes. Yeah. I did a show with Julia from Orca not too long ago, and we were very awkwardly on the same couch as I interviewed her. And then I looked at the YouTube comments, I was like, well, that needs to change.
01:29:49.450 - 01:29:56.282, Speaker A: So this is the change. Bankless studio. It's going to be awesome, man. Yeah. I'm excited to come up there one time with you.
01:29:56.336 - 01:29:57.594, Speaker B: Yeah, we'll do your layer zero.
01:29:57.632 - 01:30:00.682, Speaker A: I'll get you on a. No, I was going to say I want to get you on a layer zero.
01:30:00.736 - 01:30:02.106, Speaker B: That's my podcast, bro.
01:30:02.208 - 01:30:08.974, Speaker A: I know, but I got to interview who's going to interview you. Anthony Cisano interview you for Layer Zero. It's got to be me.
01:30:09.172 - 01:30:12.960, Speaker B: Yeah, that's right. Ryan, what are you excited about?
01:30:13.750 - 01:30:39.562, Speaker A: I'm excited, I guess, about the overconfidence of bears right now. Here's something I tweeted out. When prices go up too fast, people get dumb. Of course that's true. But when prices go down too fast, people also get dumb. And I'm seeing a lot of the dumb sentiment now, David, just this morning I was cruising around Reddit. The amount of threads this is, like, on the r gaming of, like, nfts were the dumbest idea ever.
01:30:39.562 - 01:30:57.342, Speaker A: Ha ha. Crypto bros get wrecked. You guys suck. Crypto is so useless. It's a scam. All of this noise is going on, and detractors and critics are absolutely gleeful. Right? And what they don't know is we've already been through this, like, three or four times.
01:30:57.342 - 01:31:23.190, Speaker A: Exact same people. Not the same people necessarily. Exact same sentiment, maybe different set of actors. Crypto is dead. And I think the overconfidence of the bears actually makes me optimistic that we are closing in on a potential bottom. All right, now, this could still last a very long time. We're still talking months, potentially years.
01:31:23.190 - 01:31:46.078, Speaker A: I don't know how long it's going to last, but I'm starting to hear that overconfidence that feels very much and sounds very much like bottom type of talk. And I think it'll persist for a while, but it's actually making me bullish to hear the same patterns that we've seen so many times in crypto start to play out in the sentiment right now.
01:31:46.164 - 01:31:54.910, Speaker B: So just curious. When prices go up too fast, people get dumb. When prices go down too fast, people also get dumb. In what scenario do people not get dumb?
01:31:56.310 - 01:32:10.290, Speaker A: I think there is a sweet spot of sober time. Don't you feel like this in every market? The sweet spot was probably, for me, for this cycle around was probably like sometime 2020, early 2020.
01:32:10.360 - 01:32:11.538, Speaker B: D five summer.
01:32:11.714 - 01:32:27.782, Speaker A: Yes. I think in late 2019 into 2020, I feel like we had six months or so, maybe nine months of just the sweet spot where things were happening, the builders were building the market. Sentiment was, like, rational.
01:32:27.846 - 01:32:30.220, Speaker B: So the end of the bear market.
01:32:31.230 - 01:32:41.786, Speaker A: Basically, and that's the sweet spot. And then I start to hate my life again. I hate my life now when things are, like, irrationally bearish and everyone's like, you're such an idiot.
01:32:41.978 - 01:32:43.790, Speaker B: You have a crypto podcast.
01:32:44.850 - 01:32:55.134, Speaker A: But then I also hate the market. I don't know. Three months ago, six months ago when you're like, you know, this terra thing might not be sustainable. Damn. It's like, you loser.
01:32:55.182 - 01:32:56.014, Speaker B: You're so dumb.
01:32:56.062 - 01:33:10.394, Speaker A: You eth maxi. I hate that side of it, too. So we only get rest during this eight month period, I don't know, six to nine month period maybe in between these two cycles. And that's when the market is less dumb. I think I talked about how I experience it.
01:33:10.432 - 01:33:49.778, Speaker B: I think I talked about this last week with Anthony when you were on your little AI vacation. But my mom would text me every now and then saying, hey, I met up with Linda. She said, hey, how's Dave doing? Is Dave doing all right during the crypto crash? And I've gotten these texts, like, three times, is David okay? And they know I've been in crypto since 2017. I'm like, can you guys please go look at the chart? Please? I tell my mom, like, hey, I'm hiring a bankless if they're looking at a chart. Well, no, tell those people to go look at the chart. Like, ether at $1,000 anyways. But just like, yeah, it's just, like, so frustrating.
01:33:49.778 - 01:33:54.758, Speaker B: They don't really ask if I'm doing okay when ether is at $4,000. I didn't hear anything then.
01:33:54.844 - 01:34:00.760, Speaker A: Mom, David's mom, don't be concerned about David until eth is, like, double digit. Okay, then you can start.
01:34:02.010 - 01:34:04.154, Speaker B: Then. I might not be okay at that point.
01:34:04.352 - 01:34:10.250, Speaker A: You might not be okay, but, bankless listener, we think you are going to be okay. This is all going to be okay.
01:34:10.320 - 01:34:37.810, Speaker B: Ryan, you said at the end of 2019, start of 2020, was when you felt like, most rational and just the best in the crypto market. That was the era in crypto. And I was thinking about this earlier. That was the era in crypto where all the people that stuck around during the bear market, that's when all the people were like, yo, wait, the bull market, it's on. That's what happens next. People that stuck around during the bear market, they identified that the bull market was started in April of 2020. We knew this.
01:34:37.810 - 01:35:14.814, Speaker B: Everyone had the conviction of like, yes, the mole market's back on. Like, it's on, baby. And the only way that you were able to know that was if you rode through the bear market. And so the people that rode through the bear market were able to ride the bull market from Genesis in April of 2020, when ether was two to $300, bitcoin was like $6,000, $7,000. And then they rode those things and then retail figured out that the bull market was on sometime in middle of 2021. So if you ride through the bear market, you have a one year head start. In a bull market that generally only lasts about two years.
01:35:14.814 - 01:35:17.086, Speaker B: So that's your alpha. That's your advantage.
01:35:17.118 - 01:35:36.290, Speaker A: It's exactly where you want to be. That is the reason you don't leave during times like this, when prices are down. The reason you stay is exactly for that reason. Totally. All right, David, let's get to the meme of the week. What are we looking at on the screen? I'm seeing a whole bunch of bulls here. These look like sad bulls.
01:35:36.370 - 01:35:55.050, Speaker B: This is. What are these called, the dungeons and dragons like disposition charts or whatever. So you got like lawful good, neutral good, chaotic good, lawful evil, neutral evil, chaotic evil. So for the listeners, podcast listeners, sorry, that's going to be kind of hard to explain. In the lawful good corner, we got good old USDC being the lawful good, like everyone likes us.
01:35:55.120 - 01:35:55.558, Speaker A: Stable coins.
01:35:55.574 - 01:36:02.666, Speaker B: They're all stable coins. They're every single stable coin. Yeah. In the neutral good. Top center, we got dai. It's neutral. It's one dollars good.
01:36:02.666 - 01:36:43.706, Speaker B: Then we also have chaotic good for fracs, the algorithmic 85% backed algorithmic stablecoin that has admirably held its peg. Nothing wrong there. Coming up in the neutral camp, we got the lawful neutral of the actual us dollar, the fiat in your bank account, the cash in your wallet. In the true neutral corner, we have the curve three pool, the tether dai USDC curve three pool, and the bowl. Every single one of these has a bowl that's colored the color of the stablecoin. And this bowl happens to be both green for USCC, blue for USDC, green for tether, and yellow for dai. So true neutral is the curve three pool, chaotic neutral.
01:36:43.706 - 01:37:22.250, Speaker B: We got mim. Didn't that one go to zero? I don't know. And then in the evil row, we got the lawful ether, which is evil, which is tether. It's lawful because it's actually $1, redeemable for $1. But it's evil because it's a black box. We got the neutral evil, which is USDD, the terra fork on tron that somehow is maintaining its peg. And then we also have chaotic evil in the bottom right corner, which is UST terra USD with also, if you notice, Ryan Mike Novogratz Wolf tattoo on the arm.
01:37:22.830 - 01:37:47.166, Speaker A: It's crazy, man. I definitely agree with the bottom row, I think, and particularly the chaotic evil being UST, but also this tron stablecoin, man. That's got to be next to go. Yeah. Justin Sun. I can't believe the audacity of this. I'm going to spin up a stablecoin a month before UST and it's going to be elgo backed.
01:37:47.166 - 01:37:54.750, Speaker A: Same kind of mechanism as Luna UsT and that is not okay. And if you're in that, be very careful.
01:37:54.830 - 01:37:55.646, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a game of chicken.
01:37:55.678 - 01:37:56.866, Speaker A: Probably not listening bankless though.
01:37:56.888 - 01:38:11.610, Speaker B: Yeah, that's probably true. I saw a post that talked about how Justin's son had plenty of capital to backstop the USDD de pegging and deep down to he wanted it to depeg more so he could buy it at like a cheaper discount.
01:38:12.750 - 01:38:21.194, Speaker A: So dumb. This is terrible. Justin sun is a central banker. No thank you. Give me eth. Give me bitcoin. Guys.
01:38:21.194 - 01:38:30.846, Speaker A: Of course, none of this has been financial advice. It never is. Crypto is risky. So is eth. So is bitcoin. So is all of it. You could lose what you put in.
01:38:30.846 - 01:38:41.380, Speaker A: Definitely. But we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot. Blocked by rocket ship. Get on board.
