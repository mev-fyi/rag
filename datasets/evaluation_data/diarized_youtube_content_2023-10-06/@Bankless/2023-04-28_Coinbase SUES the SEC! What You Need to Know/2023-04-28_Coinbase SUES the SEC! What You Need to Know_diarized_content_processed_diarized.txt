00:00:00.250 - 00:00:04.526, Speaker A: Coinbase is suing the SEC. Or as David would say, we are suing the SEC.
00:00:04.628 - 00:00:06.160, Speaker B: We're suing the SEC.
00:00:09.890 - 00:00:15.402, Speaker A: Bankless nation. It is the last Friday of April, 2023. What time is it, David?
00:00:15.546 - 00:00:36.870, Speaker B: It's the Bankless Friday weekly roll up where we cover the entire weekly news in crypto, which is always an ambitious endeavor. We got some lawsuits to talk about this time in our favor. We're the ones doing the suing. Feels good, man. But in order to prepare for all of that content, make sure that you have your morning coffee. You got your coffee, Ryan. You're going to need it.
00:00:37.020 - 00:00:40.922, Speaker A: Yep. Also, we should clarify. It's not you and I suing anybody, at least.
00:00:40.976 - 00:00:49.114, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. We as the crypto industry are doing, we the people are suing the powers that be.
00:00:49.232 - 00:00:53.166, Speaker A: This is coinbase suing the SEC. It's taking a while to get I.
00:00:53.188 - 00:00:56.622, Speaker B: Guess I should just say that we'll talk about that.
00:00:56.676 - 00:01:07.838, Speaker A: Also, John Oliver, he's got some fighting words for think. I know it's mostly fair coverage. We're going to talk about this. I think it was the mainstream take, though. We'll talk about what that means. David, what else are we covering?
00:01:08.014 - 00:01:29.702, Speaker B: Authorities are looking into SBF's parents. So SBF, the bankman freed name back in the menu today, but then, of course, we're going to get back into our roots. Talk about ChappellA two weeks forward, some more rocket pool stats, and something on Solana I think is cool. So we'll talk about that as well. Yeah, go figure.
00:01:29.756 - 00:01:30.770, Speaker A: Is it a phone? David?
00:01:30.850 - 00:01:31.882, Speaker B: It's not a phone.
00:01:32.016 - 00:01:33.718, Speaker A: It's a backpack. It might be a backpack.
00:01:33.814 - 00:01:36.442, Speaker B: Backpack. I don't know what backpack is.
00:01:36.496 - 00:01:50.110, Speaker A: To be continued, guys. And of course, if you like Bankless, and if you like crypto, make sure you like and subscribe rate and review. That's how we pop to the top of the charts. Want to get the top of the charts in Spotify and YouTube and any other charts that exist. We want to get the crypto message.
00:01:50.180 - 00:01:55.090, Speaker B: Out there, David, see how much AI Ryan is like. If that's a chart, I want to be there.
00:01:55.160 - 00:02:12.498, Speaker A: It's a chart. Let's optimize. Speaking of this, speaking of optimization, the Safe wallet wants you to know about account abstraction, which is an optimization that they are working on. So safe. Of course. Used to be called Gnosis safe. It's now called safe.
00:02:12.498 - 00:02:37.226, Speaker A: It's the multi SIG that everybody in Ethereum uses, including Bankless. You've heard us talking about account abstraction before as well. Account abstraction is kind of the new smart contract wallet that is going to put fintech user experience to shame. And now Safe has something they are rolling out a way for you to tap into their account abstraction. David, tell them about this SDK.
00:02:37.418 - 00:03:02.690, Speaker B: So if you are a developer and like we all know have been chanting on Bankless, we are in the paradigm of externally owned accounts. It's a terrible name. They're probably called private keys. 99% of Wallets are private key, externally owned account wallets. Eventually, in the future, 99% of wallets will be account abstraction. Also a bad name. Smart contract wallets.
00:03:02.690 - 00:03:39.598, Speaker B: And Gnosis Safe, also called Safe, is helping us get there with this SDK for developers to build more smart contract wallets so that we can fix all of Crypto's goddamn terrible UX problems. So Safe and their Safe core account abstraction software development kit, devs named Stuff So Weird. But they've got a dev package for all the devs out there. So it helps you build on ramps. It helps you build your protocol. It helps you build relays for gasless transactions and metatransactions. It's got a little plugin for your Fiat on ramps because you're going to need to get money into your wallet.
00:03:39.598 - 00:03:52.182, Speaker B: And so if you are building in the world of account abstraction, if you're building a smart contract wallet, or you need something like this for your Web Three game or whatnot, the core SDK, which is available in the link in the show notes, is for you.
00:03:52.316 - 00:04:04.010, Speaker A: And also, there's a hackathon going on on Monday. This is Monday, May 1. So if the dev stuff didn't appeal to you, this is a hackathon for everybody. They call it an anything goes hackathon.
00:04:05.230 - 00:04:27.578, Speaker B: It's really hard to explain the word anything, but with two A's and they're both capitalized because it's an account abstraction hackathon. But anything goes. So anything goes. If you're a non developer, you can do stuff just like explain a project. You can do the marketing, the presentation. You can make memes anything goes hackathon. So it's literally like everything else is nontechnical.
00:04:27.674 - 00:04:28.218, Speaker A: I love these.
00:04:28.244 - 00:04:33.906, Speaker B: Also a great way to start and get on a team and to get some practice and sharpen your sticks in the Web Three world.
00:04:34.008 - 00:04:47.426, Speaker A: Yeah. More inclusive hackathons. That's cool. I hope this trend continues. David, let's get to the market. Speaking of trends, and whether they're continuing or not, got to start with the bitcoin price today. Are we continuing the trend up, down or flat?
00:04:47.538 - 00:05:05.338, Speaker B: Dude, crypto prices were super weird this week. Net flat. Net flat on the week. So Bitcoin is down zero point 33%. So it's flat. We are currently at $29,000. Almost touched $30,000, almost broke below $27,000.
00:05:05.338 - 00:05:14.640, Speaker B: But here we are at the end of the week flat. But I will remind bankless visitor, you should probably just pull open your phone and check the price right now because I don't know what it's going to be like in 24 hours.
00:05:15.010 - 00:05:23.762, Speaker A: Well, speaking of which, before you do pull out the phone, let's talk about the ETH price at the time of recording. Did that do similar things to bitcoin? Flat on the week?
00:05:23.896 - 00:05:28.340, Speaker B: Slightly down, but it's flat. Ether went down 2% this week.
00:05:29.110 - 00:05:29.746, Speaker A: It's really funny.
00:05:29.778 - 00:05:30.290, Speaker B: It's flat.
00:05:30.370 - 00:05:35.110, Speaker A: Do you see these red candles? You see them both on the Bitcoin chart and the Ethereum chart?
00:05:37.050 - 00:06:00.542, Speaker B: Yeah. The red candle happened while we were recording with ledger ether pumped from 1800 almost up to 2000 and we were like, we're back, baby. Same thing with bitcoin. Bitcoin almost it hit 30,000 and it bounced off of it. And then like 5 hours later, everything dumps back down. Ether goes from almost 2000 down to 1800. Bitcoin goes from 30,000 down to 27,000.
00:06:00.542 - 00:06:04.862, Speaker B: And now we're back right in the middle of those two things. So Ryan, what the hell happened?
00:06:04.996 - 00:06:24.182, Speaker A: Well, this was happening by the way, during we don't usually do shows on just prices and just charts, but we did a show on just prices and just charts and this is the candle we experienced during that show, right? Do you see that talk on Twitter? People were blaming the thumbnail of that show as the problem. It's like a big goofy picture of ledger with his only words.
00:06:24.236 - 00:06:26.054, Speaker B: Yeah, that one might have been our.
00:06:26.092 - 00:06:46.426, Speaker A: Fault, but that wasn't the case. So I don't think we can be blamed for this. At least, David, there was I don't think we should be blamed. Breaking during the show, mount Gox and the US government wallets making transactions, the infamous original mount Gox wallets that were supposed to be sort of locked up, maybe doing things, maybe causing a sell off. This news sort of propagated.
00:06:46.538 - 00:07:32.618, Speaker B: It turns out the TLDR of Mount Gox is that there has been a decent amount of bitcoin, something like ten to 20% of the supply of the Mount Gox hacked bitcoins that has been locked up in the court proceedings. Because some of the forever because some people keep on delaying and delaying, delaying. I don't know why the strategy is behind that. Anyways, the mount Gox bitcoin unlock FUD has been with us since I've been in crypto. Oh yeah, it's like that meme of the truck running into the wall, but the camera cuts every single time. It's been like that for like four years. The news broke that mount Gox wallets actually started sending transactions implying that the FUD has finally arrived, the truck is finally going to crash into the wall.
00:07:32.618 - 00:07:54.546, Speaker B: And so an alert, like a bot alert, alert about like, hey, this wallet is making transactions went out, which is what triggered this tweet from DB who does all of these breaking tweets saying mount Gox Mount Gox wallets are moving, they're going to sell, they're going to sell. The implication is that the ten to 20% of the mount Gox exploited bitcoins are basically going to be sold because.
00:07:54.568 - 00:07:55.634, Speaker A: They were the market, right?
00:07:55.672 - 00:08:24.150, Speaker B: Because they were like $300 to $1,000 at the time of purchase. And now whatever the price, it is now $30,000. So you're going to assume that these people are finally going to liquidate that almost decade long force hold. So that's the story. And then these things actually start moving on chain to set off this alert, this Arkham alert, which triggers this tweet, which forces the market to sell off. That was all that backstory turns out it was an errant bug. So once again, the truck did not crash into the wall.
00:08:24.320 - 00:08:50.374, Speaker A: Turns out we just totally wasted your time by telling you this. Just like the markets wasted our time in producing this errant signal. I feel like this is a bigger picture of the markets right now, David, which is like, no one really knows what to do. And so there's all of this noise. This is just more noise. People asking why the price up and down. Well, it's a false alert, but now it's kind of stayed down, at least from the highs, but it bounced back a little bit.
00:08:50.374 - 00:08:54.086, Speaker A: There's so much noise in this kind of market and I just kind of filtered out.
00:08:54.268 - 00:08:56.120, Speaker B: I'm just done with it. I'm over.
00:08:57.050 - 00:08:59.058, Speaker A: How about the ratio? You done on the ratio ETH?
00:08:59.074 - 00:09:00.070, Speaker B: Bitcoin ratio.
00:09:00.750 - 00:09:02.620, Speaker A: Okay. Because it's going down.
00:09:03.790 - 00:09:18.382, Speaker B: It's at zero point 65. So like downer ish but it's still within the last range. It's been in the last two years. Nothing is significant below until we start to get below like 00:55 or above 8.8.
00:09:18.516 - 00:09:20.686, Speaker A: Ledger had good commentary on the ratio, I think.
00:09:20.708 - 00:09:23.786, Speaker B: Yeah, he did. That's a really good episode. People should go watch that.
00:09:23.828 - 00:09:27.186, Speaker A: Did it change your mind at all? Are you still holding the ratio for.
00:09:27.368 - 00:09:51.782, Speaker B: Well, yeah, because he was like, david, if bitcoin goes bitcoin hulk mode and bitcoin is at $100,000 and Ether is only at $5,000, that is a ratio of like zero point. I'm going to catch you the math. It was something like 0.5 or something. And I'm like, well, I held that my ratio trade down to the 3 hours capital liquidation when it got down to 0.4. Something not scared. Come at me, bro.
00:09:51.782 - 00:09:52.582, Speaker B: Like I'm not scared.
00:09:52.646 - 00:10:05.180, Speaker A: Yeah, no. ETH is a different ETH than the last bear market. And that was the main thrust of Ledger's argument. Last bear market. It was weak. It was so weak. Comparison to bitcoin, we've got a much stronger ETH this time around.
00:10:05.180 - 00:10:09.390, Speaker A: Global crypto market cap. I'm going to say it this time, David, because it's so UN.
00:10:09.460 - 00:10:10.842, Speaker B: You're taking it from me two weeks in a row.
00:10:10.906 - 00:10:19.838, Speaker A: We're above a trillion. 1.24 trillion. That's what you need to know. Tell us about this story, though. Cumulative ETH deposit of beacon chain and validator. Shall we? Shook the snow globe.
00:10:19.838 - 00:10:25.558, Speaker A: What's happening with all the ETH that was staked? Is it being unstaked? Is it staking? Elsewhere? What's going on?
00:10:25.644 - 00:10:57.454, Speaker B: So I've become a connoisseur of CHAPELLA metrics dashboards, et cetera. This particular dashboard from the block I think is the best one to illustrate the ChappellA snow globe. So this is the ether supply deposited into the beacon chain since the launch of the beacon chain in December of 2020. And of course, the chart is up only the entire time, up until the CHAPELLA withdrawal fork. That happened two weeks ago. And so the line is literally cannot go down up until two weeks ago. And then the withdrawals happen.
00:10:57.454 - 00:11:30.522, Speaker B: And this was like, though the withdrawals are coming, the withdrawals are coming, everyone's going to withdraw. And you can see the first moment that this line goes down at the teeny little top right there, and it goes from a whopping 18 point something million Ether staked down to like 17.17.5 million Ether staked. And we have continued on the same uptrend that we've been on since December of 2020. Withdrawals seem to have slowed down and deposits have continued. And so the withdrawals seem to be over two weeks.
00:11:30.576 - 00:11:42.214, Speaker A: David, I want to take you back down memory lane. Crypto. Grandpa, do you remember when it was we were worried, the Ethereum communities worried about getting five hundred K E staked.
00:11:42.342 - 00:11:47.102, Speaker B: Because we needed five hundred K to kick start the beacon chain and we weren't necessarily getting there.
00:11:47.236 - 00:11:52.266, Speaker A: Look at this, that's way back here, five hundred K E. And now we're.
00:11:52.298 - 00:11:59.214, Speaker B: Talking about like just 500K ETH got withdrawn. And that is a blip.
00:11:59.342 - 00:12:09.766, Speaker A: Yeah, it's just a blip. What about this? Another dashboard for the fine connoisseur of dashboarding that you are. How do you rate this Hildabi dashboard? What can we take away from ETH staking here?
00:12:09.868 - 00:12:30.586, Speaker B: This Hildabi dashboard is a top tier, very fine, very fine dashboard. It's very nice. We are net inflows since the Shanghai ChappellA hard fork, a negative 440,000 ether in the deposit in the beacon chain. So that is the number of ether that has been net withdrawn. That used to be lower. I think it was as low as something like 0.7 million.
00:12:30.586 - 00:12:59.126, Speaker B: Now we're at zero point 44 million. The total supply of ether on the beacon chain, 18.7 million. And actually the cool parts about this thing, if you go to scroll down a little bit further, so stakers the delta of stakers in the last month. So you can filter that, Ryan, by market share. And so you can see who's won and who's lost in the last month or so by clicking on the market share word that's in the last week. But go over to the one, go over to the month because it's been more than one week.
00:12:59.126 - 00:13:28.510, Speaker B: So Kraken obviously the big loser because of lost all their staked ETH because Gary Gensler forced them to. But even Coinbase, who was unforced, also is a net loss of Ether net outflows of ether. Huobi Gemini. Decentralized exchanges. Now, if you click that one again, we will see who the winners are. So the market share increase if you order by who has won the most of the snow globe. So where has all that snow landed? That good old ether.
00:13:28.510 - 00:13:37.166, Speaker B: Unidentified is the winner here at 1.5% growth in market share, which is big, by the way. Who is identified unidentified? Who is that, Ryan?
00:13:37.278 - 00:13:39.842, Speaker A: It's probably a lot of solo stakers, right?
00:13:39.896 - 00:14:01.506, Speaker B: They're identified because they're solo stakers. Those are the many people at 1.5%. Coming in second is staked us. I think that is Stakedwise coming in second at they gained 0.6% market share, stake fish P, two P Okx followed by Rocket Pool at 0.2%. And so that is the winners and the losers. Pretty cool.
00:14:01.548 - 00:14:12.534, Speaker A: So the snow globe is happening to some extent and what's really interesting is this is just a blip off of the high. Do you think we've bottomed already, David? On the deposit ratio?
00:14:12.582 - 00:14:18.382, Speaker B: I think we've bottomed, yep. I'm famous for calling Bottoms calling the bottom.
00:14:18.516 - 00:14:22.640, Speaker A: You know what, I'm going to agree with you. It's both David and Ryan calling the bottom.
00:14:22.950 - 00:14:24.514, Speaker B: That doesn't happen often.
00:14:24.712 - 00:14:27.970, Speaker A: Two Bankless hosts calling the bottom right now.
00:14:28.120 - 00:14:52.250, Speaker B: The other thing that's worth noting actually is that Lido has not yet enabled two. They have had like two or three more weeks, I think it's at the end of May. So they still have their snow globe moment. And honestly, when you're in the lead of staking derivatives and you're taking your time to enable withdrawals, like, yeah, I bet you guys would take your time to enable withdrawals.
00:14:53.870 - 00:14:58.214, Speaker A: Well, maybe I shouldn't have called the bottom just now because who knows what could happen with Lido.
00:14:58.262 - 00:15:22.254, Speaker B: That's a pretty well, I wouldn't be too worried about that because you can always exit as a Lido person with Staked ETH and so there is an exit route, but yeah, there will be some pent up demand. Lido has definitely got a lot of net inflows, but that's because it's kind of unfair because they literally don't allow outflows. So it's still in only for Lido.
00:15:22.382 - 00:15:54.106, Speaker A: You know, it's a market piece I really enjoyed this week was a piece by Polenia, who is an L2 researcher in general. Pseudo Anonymous had them on the Bankless podcast before and they do a quick tour of the top five chains by economic activity. This is a post I think is worth reading. We'll include a link to it in the show notes, but I'll go through the kind of the breakdown number one, top chain by economic activity. It's got to be, of course, you know, it Ethereum at number one by a lot. Okay. Ethereum secures.
00:15:54.106 - 00:16:48.510, Speaker A: 420,000,000,000 across ETH ERC twenty s and NFTs. Plenty goes through different dimensions to kind of judge both passive and active economic activity and Ethereum is the lead on both, both passive and active. Of course, it's far in the lead over the number two, which is Bitcoin on active and number two indeed is Bitcoin. After that, Polynia mentions this very large gap, this very large, like it's a two horse race basically with Ethereum leading by a lot on the active side on economic activity. But then after that you get into Arbitrum. It's number three on Plenty's list, followed by Tron and Binance Smart chain. What's interesting is if you have been mostly absorbing bankless content, right, we don't talk much about the Tron story, do we? We don't talk much about the Binance smart chain story.
00:16:48.510 - 00:17:28.678, Speaker A: The reason we don't is because these are like maxis. Well, we're biased, decentralization maxis. And I totally will admit that I am a biased, decentralization maxi. Both of us are. But Tron is doing a lot of activity and somewhere in the spectrum of like, is it sort of a bank? Is it fintech or is it crypto? Is it an open banking system? I think the answer to that is yes. And it's doing a lot with Tether right now, binance smart chain as well. So if you talk to people in Argentina right now and what crypto are they actually using? It's like stablecoins on Tron and Binance smart chain.
00:17:28.678 - 00:17:29.658, Speaker A: That's what's happening.
00:17:29.744 - 00:17:36.174, Speaker B: And that usage has great adoption in financially underserved parts of the world.
00:17:36.292 - 00:17:50.722, Speaker A: I think it's great. I'm not mad about this. It's more private keys in the hands of more people. Hopefully it doesn't rug everyone at some point, but it's got some rug resistance in it. Not a lot. A little bit more than, yeah, that's kind of cool.
00:17:50.776 - 00:18:12.146, Speaker B: Anyway, he does follow up. Excuse me. They also follow up saying that the once dominant number two player binance smart chain and also Tron, has been dethroned by Arbitrum One, this last bear market. If the YouTube viewers are confused about the tweet that was on screen, that didn't go by the list that Ryan and I just said that's because Polenia elaborates further on about his reasoning. Their reasoning.
00:18:12.178 - 00:18:16.474, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, yeah. I showed a faulty tweet. All right, David, what do we got coming up next?
00:18:16.592 - 00:18:48.946, Speaker B: Coming up next, coinbase suing the SEC, that's us, I claim. And a public response. Interesting strategy. They're posting their response to the SEC both as a written letter, because that's what you do, and a YouTube video taking a leaf out of influencer. Gary's book. So we're going to watch a clip out of that YouTube video. And we'll also take a peek, Ryan, at a case study of some character development, if you will, of a pre SEC gary Gensler at MIT giving some takes.
00:18:48.946 - 00:19:15.246, Speaker B: So we're going to watch some clips. We've been clip heavy on the weekly roll up in the last couple of weeks, la clips, and that continues. Speaking of clips, John Oliver got some John Oliver clips as well. He's got some takes for crypto as well, for the mainstream. So we're going to play all those clips and talk about them and all that stuff as soon as we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors, especially Kraken, our strategic sponsor for 2023, the one that we always look at when we look at prices earlier in the show. So thank you, Kraken, for helping us look at these prices. And let's go hear from Kraken right now.

00:20:34.274 - 00:20:38.646, Speaker A: Coinbase is suing the SEC, or as David would say, we are suing the SEC.
00:20:38.748 - 00:20:40.200, Speaker B: We're suing the SEC.
00:20:40.810 - 00:21:01.278, Speaker A: This is a tweet from Paul, the chief legal officer at Coinbase. He says, Today we filed a narrow action in the US Circuit Court to compel the SEC to respond yes or no to a rulemaking petition we filed with them last July, asking them to provide regulatory guidance for the crypto industry. All they want is a simple yes or no. David, what is happening here?
00:21:01.364 - 00:21:48.720, Speaker B: So I've never heard of this narrow action phrase before. I'm assuming it's a legal term. They're suing them to do this one thing, which is reply yes or no to this petition which you've got pulled up, that they filed with them last July. So they filed a petition if you want to skip over to that one, Ryan, they filed this petition forever ago, and Coinbase is suing the SEC to get them to just say yes or no to this petition. Replied follows up his tweet saying, the SEC is required by law to respond to petitions, quote, within a reasonable time, but they have not yet responded to our petition from last July, which we are coming up to almost a year on being May. Almost. And so they are suing them for not doing their job in a reasonable amount of time.
00:21:49.170 - 00:21:49.822, Speaker A: Cool.
00:21:49.956 - 00:21:56.142, Speaker B: I mean, it's not that big of a deal, like it's just a yes or no lawsuit, but the implications of that are large.
00:21:56.276 - 00:21:59.278, Speaker A: Have they not gone in for office hours with Gary David.
00:21:59.454 - 00:22:00.930, Speaker B: They have not gone in for office hours.
00:22:01.000 - 00:22:03.442, Speaker A: Well, come on Coinbase, all you have to do is go to office hours.
00:22:03.496 - 00:22:34.410, Speaker B: So we found this Twitter thread from Meta Lawman, who is a lawyer who comments on this. And so here's everything you need to know about this real quick. This case will move fast. He claims, unlike the Ripple case, this begins in the appellate court, not the trial court. I don't know what an appellate court is. There will be no discovery, just a briefing and a hearing. He follows and says Coinbase has an all star legal team led by Eugene Scalia, former Secretary of labor and son of Supreme Court Justice Anton Scalia.
00:22:34.410 - 00:23:18.902, Speaker B: Coinbase is seeking a writ of mandamus, which is god the legal system, which is a court order compelling the SEC to do its job and announce a decision on Coinbase's request for rulemaking. This action does not necessarily affect the SEC's timing for suing Coinbase as it has threatened to do. Again, a separate issue which we will talk about. And then he follows up and says, I expect major industry players to pile in with amicus briefs supporting Coinbase's position. We might also see the House Financial Services Committee or individual members come in with briefs in support of Coinbase, which we recently saw from last week's hearing that, yes, there is a lot of support for this. The SEC Commissioners will have to approve any response to Coinbase's action. There's a tiny chance that the SEC will blink and agree in exchange.
00:23:18.902 - 00:23:56.162, Speaker B: In rulemaking, if just one commissioner withdraws their support for Gary Gensler's regulation by an enforcement strategy, he's done. Wow. While Coinbase's action does not directly affect pending SEC cases against Ripple, Bittrex and others, it does a great job in shining a spotlight on the SEC's contradictory positions about its authority to regulate digital assets. Other judges will take note. I remember, I think a month ago, I can't remember when, but one theme of the roll up was like Gary Gensler is icarusing. He's flying too close to the sun, he's gone too far. It was probably the weekly roll up where the SEC announced the Wells notice against Coinbase.
00:23:56.162 - 00:24:10.218, Speaker B: And what we said is Coinbase is too big. They're going to fight them tooth and nail and also they're going to lose because they're standing on shaky footing. And so all of that is seemingly shaping up. And this is where we are.
00:24:10.304 - 00:24:36.626, Speaker A: Yeah. By the way, in that thread that you read, if just one commissioner withdraws their support for Gary Gensler, what Meta Lawman means is one additional commissioner, we already have some SEC commissioners. Hester purse, of course, has famously dissented with just about everything Gary has tried to do with his crypto policy. If she can get one more commissioner to dissent and defect from Gary's side of things, then Gary is done.
00:24:36.728 - 00:24:38.360, Speaker B: What does that mean he's done?
00:24:39.610 - 00:24:58.090, Speaker A: Like, that's a great question. What does this mean by like I don't think it means he's fired. I just think it means he has to capitulate to this one particular issue. There's some other things going on from Coinbase as well, including this video which was just released as of this morning. David, what are we about to watch?
00:24:58.240 - 00:25:22.594, Speaker B: Okay, so this is the Coinbase response to the SEC in video format. It's a longer video. It's 13 minutes. This is a four minute clip. They are releasing their response. They're also filing like a normal document that looks like a legal document, but they're also doing the 2023 thing, which is apparently to also you got to wear suits. You got to wear suits and you also have to fight on social media.
00:25:22.594 - 00:25:40.994, Speaker B: And so we're taking the fight to the algorithms. And so they are posting this video on the Coinbase YouTube. And here is Brian and Paul with their response to the SEC. Wells Notice. This. Icarusing of the SEC. This is their response.
00:25:40.994 - 00:25:45.082, Speaker B: So let's watch this. Actually, Ryan and I have not watched this. So we are watching this for the first time right now.
00:25:45.136 - 00:26:07.178, Speaker D: Let's go to the chair, other commissioners and staff of the securities and Exchange Commission. I want to thank you for this opportunity to speak directly to you. My name is Paul Grewell. I'm Coinbase's chief legal officer. And with me is Brian Armstrong, the chief executive officer and chairman official. I'd like to start by turning things over to Brian to say a few words. Brian?
00:26:07.274 - 00:26:07.818, Speaker B: Brian. Yeah.
00:26:07.844 - 00:26:50.400, Speaker E: Thanks, Paul. So again, thank you for the opportunity to respond to this Wells notice and I thought I'd share a few words just about the founding story of Coinbase and why I decided to base it here in the US. And how we've proactively sought out compliance over the last eleven years. So, back in 2012, I had just read the Bitcoin White Paper and something clicked in my head when I first read this, that this might be a very important technology breakthrough that could help update the financial system globally. I had had a first hand experience seeing how difficult and challenging certain aspects of the financial system were. I had been a software engineer at Airbnb and I had seen how difficult it was to send and receive payments globally to 190 countries. It was slow and expensive and difficult.
00:26:50.400 - 00:27:33.690, Speaker E: I had lived in Argentina, actually for a year, studying abroad and working abroad. And I had seen what a country looked like that had gone through hyperinflation, where people had lost trust in the currency and they didn't have access to good financial services. They couldn't get loans, for instance, to buy a car or a home. And so when I read the Bitcoin White Paper, I thought this might be an important breakthrough, something on the order of what we saw with the Internet. A new global and decentralized system that could make it easier for people to transmit value. And update financial services globally. The next decision I had was, where do I want to start this company? Once I realized I wanted to start a company, and I went to some early Bitcoin meetups in San Francisco, and people were telling me, you shouldn't base it in the US.
00:27:33.690 - 00:27:54.180, Speaker E: It's going to be too challenging. There's 50 state regulators and multiple federal regulators, and you should start it in Hong Kong or Singapore. And there was other firms that were starting at that time that did that. But I made the choice at that moment to start the company in the US. Because I knew that even if it was more difficult, the US. Was a major market. There was respect for rule of law.
00:27:54.180 - 00:28:33.594, Speaker E: The US was a financial hub, a technology hub. It was a place where I felt entrepreneurs could work in good faith with regulators to help define clear rules for new industries as they emerged. And so I was lucky enough to raise some venture capital money. The prototype on my laptop nights and weekends turned into a small company, and we went off to the races. Eleven years later. Fast forward this strategy of proactively working with regulators in cases where it really wasn't clear what we should do because it was a new industry, we tried to do the right thing. In the absence of clarity and demonstrate good faith effort that would allow us to bring this technology in a safe and thoughtful way to hopefully a billion people someday.
00:28:33.594 - 00:29:16.110, Speaker E: So here we are. As a public company, I think we've made enormous strides, and I think the message I'd really like to leave with the commissioners and the SEC is that we're committed to working within the regulatory perimeter. We want to see a clear market structure for trading crypto securities. Not all crypto assets are securities. There's also crypto commodities, there's stablecoins, there's crypto that's artwork. We're going to work with multiple regulators to make this industry safe and trusted. And a Wells notice at this stage, when there is not a clear rulebook is not constructive, and it's not good for America, we are prepared to defend that position in court, but it doesn't have to come to that.
00:29:16.110 - 00:29:21.802, Speaker E: We welcome a true dialogue about a workable path forward for our industry. Now I'll hand it back over to Paul.
00:29:21.946 - 00:29:56.890, Speaker D: Coinbase has been talking to the SEC about our business for many years now, including sharing our legal views on our asset listing and staking services. We've repeatedly asked the SEC for its own views on how securities laws might apply to Coinbase and our industry. And to be candid, we've mostly gotten silence in response. Coinbase will defend itself vigorously in litigation if it comes to that, but it does not have to come to that. We will show up at your offices any day, anytime, to discuss a workable path forward for our industry, but we won't find that path without true dialogue.
00:29:57.630 - 00:30:00.358, Speaker B: Yo bringing in the lawyer.
00:30:00.454 - 00:30:07.278, Speaker A: That's interesting. I think it's a great format, actually. Rather than just a press release or a letter, it's just like a four minute YouTube video.
00:30:07.444 - 00:30:09.034, Speaker B: You would say that as a podcaster?
00:30:09.082 - 00:30:23.614, Speaker A: Well, of course I would. I'm a video maximum podcast maximalist. But also, I think that it's interesting the way Brian started with telling his personal story. And it's like the story that kind of like, I chose to base this company in America.
00:30:23.742 - 00:30:24.938, Speaker B: I'm a patriot.
00:30:25.054 - 00:31:05.230, Speaker A: I did the American Dream thing where you start with an idea and then you develop that in America and then you turn it into a publicly traded company. I did all of the things that I thought you wanted me to do, and now we're getting penalized with regulators who are just unworkable. And you sent Wells notices that there was going to be enforcement and just stop it. Right? Like, you're not even willing to talk to us. What's going on? I think it's effective. I hope it lands. What do you think? You think this video is going to land?
00:31:05.380 - 00:31:29.042, Speaker B: Well, I think when you compare and contrast this video versus the Gary influencer video, they didn't need to make this video. They just needed to submit a document, a legal document, which they did, which so few people are going to watch. So many more people are totally going to watch this video. And if you compare this video to Gary's stupid stock footage influencer video, this is going to resonate way more.
00:31:29.116 - 00:31:45.866, Speaker A: Well, the reason everyone's doing these videos is because I think they all recognize that this is a battle for hearts and minds at this, not just it's not just, we'll see you in court, even though that was kind of the not so veiled threat there, which is, thank God we have another check and balance.
00:31:45.978 - 00:31:55.662, Speaker B: But it's like Brian showing up to tell a story and then his lawyer next to him, the bad cop, being like, and we're going to sue you anyway.
00:31:55.716 - 00:32:02.882, Speaker A: I think it's effective. David, you want to do some throwback clips of Gary Gensler the way he used to be before accepting the job here?
00:32:03.016 - 00:32:23.050, Speaker B: Yeah. This is pre SEC. Gary gensler. This is before he turned into a paid shill for the banking sector, when he was a free man, if you will, giving his free unadulterated takes as a professor of knowledge at MIT. So here's what Gary has to say about how you start a decentralized crypto network. Let's hear from Gerber.
00:32:24.110 - 00:32:35.310, Speaker C: And it could be something that has no central authority right now, no central intermediary, and it's just how to jump start something. I think in that circumstance, it's more likely you need a Native.
00:32:37.490 - 00:32:38.314, Speaker A: Hmm.
00:32:38.442 - 00:32:48.980, Speaker B: So you want to start a decentralized network, you need something to jumpstart it. And so Gary says that's why you use a native token. Interesting.
00:32:50.230 - 00:32:50.946, Speaker A: Go on.
00:32:51.048 - 00:32:57.938, Speaker B: But, Ryan, do you think that those native tokens are securities? Let's ask 2018 gearbear.
00:32:58.114 - 00:32:59.160, Speaker A: Here we go.
00:32:59.530 - 00:33:40.850, Speaker C: So we already know in the US and in many other jurisdictions that three quarters of the market are not ICOs or not what we called securities. Even in the US. Canada and Taiwan, the three jurisdictions that follow something similar to Howie test that we've talked about, three quarters of the market is non securities. It's just a commodity, a cash, three quarters of the according to Bitcoin offerings. And what's a security and what's not a security relevant. Relevant and important debate. But for three quarters of the market, it's not particularly relevant as a legal matter, the regulatory matter.
00:33:40.920 - 00:33:42.626, Speaker A: Brodish wow.
00:33:42.808 - 00:33:46.920, Speaker B: 2018 Gary sounding like he's making a lot of sense.
00:33:47.370 - 00:33:48.998, Speaker A: I would get a beer with that guy.
00:33:49.084 - 00:33:52.840, Speaker B: That guy sounds I would take that class.
00:33:53.450 - 00:34:02.262, Speaker A: That's incredible. This is Brian Armstrong actually responding to this tweet. He's retweeting it, the clip, and he just goes, wow.
00:34:02.396 - 00:34:19.120, Speaker B: Wow. Okay, so that could be interpreted. How do you think he actually intended that to sound? Was that like a wow, wow, or was that like a wow? Or do you think that was like a whoa? How do you think he meant that?
00:34:20.930 - 00:34:43.718, Speaker A: I think it's up to interpretation, and all of the above are fantastic interpretation. So do that in your head. But I got to say the same thing. Wow. This is completely different person in 2018 where he said 75% of the market, the security versus commodity thing is not even up for debate. Right. At least 75% of the 2018 market.
00:34:43.718 - 00:34:47.446, Speaker A: By the way, that market was less clear than today's market, I think, too.
00:34:47.548 - 00:34:53.020, Speaker B: Yeah, the 2018 market was very whole bunch of things.
00:34:53.470 - 00:34:55.450, Speaker A: So what has changed?
00:34:55.790 - 00:35:02.554, Speaker B: I can't wait to see Gary Gensler be presented with this in the court. Just like, hey, curious Gary, what made.
00:35:02.592 - 00:35:07.950, Speaker A: You change your mind on stage? Like on trial? You're talking about, like, under oath on trial.
00:35:08.530 - 00:35:22.740, Speaker B: When did you go from everything is a security? When did you go from three quarters of these things are not securities and we need native tokens to boost up a network to 99% are securities. Where was the change? What changed? Because something happened.
00:35:23.350 - 00:35:25.140, Speaker A: Something acute happened.
00:35:25.830 - 00:35:29.702, Speaker B: There's a clear before after moment, and I would like to know what caused that.
00:35:29.836 - 00:36:01.198, Speaker A: I think it's like you get in a position of power and then your incentives totally change. So you're not incentivized towards kind of like truth and actual communication of the story. You have a different agenda. Whether that's more power accrual is maybe part of the agenda here. Whether this is more like political influence is part of the agenda, where there's actually some kind of lobby group that is drastically influencing you, we may never know, but we can only judge him by the 2018 Gary versus the 2023 Gary. And these are two completely different people. That's the thing.
00:36:01.198 - 00:36:08.242, Speaker A: Do you remember at the time when Gary Gensler was actually replaced Jay Clayton as the SEC chair. And there was actually an air of maybe hope about that.
00:36:08.296 - 00:36:10.366, Speaker B: There was cautious optimism about Gary Gensler.
00:36:10.398 - 00:36:37.242, Speaker A: Because we knew these 2018 clips and we're like, finally a regular that understands this industry. And now he's used that understanding and completely abandoned it in pursuit of some different agenda. It's very unfortunate, but let's talk about what we can do. So there is some action that we can take. What is this, David? Can I mint an NFT and support a cause here? How does this work?
00:36:37.296 - 00:36:53.438, Speaker B: That's exactly what you can do, Ryan. So Coinbase is starting a stand with Crypto campaign where you can mint a commemorative shield, NFT. It's an Ft with a shield. It's literally an emoji. And it's a very, very low price mint. Something like 0.7 ether, I think.
00:36:53.438 - 00:37:00.740, Speaker B: So Ryan's going to go there right now. He's going to connect our friends and sponsors at MetaMask, the wallet there so he can go and mint this thing.
00:37:01.750 - 00:37:03.026, Speaker A: Are you making me mint it right now?
00:37:03.048 - 00:37:29.014, Speaker B: I'm making you mint it right now, yeah. Okay. The mint is free, but there is zora charges a fee. That fee is like zero point 77 ether or something. So, like a couple of dollars, which goes to the Gitcoin Advocacy Round. So all of the fees from this shield mint NFT plus 100,000 dive donated, I believe, by Coinbase, is going to the Gitcoin Advocacy Round. So Ryan is going to mint his NFT with MetaMask.
00:37:29.014 - 00:37:37.242, Speaker B: Our friends and sponsors at MetaMask. Thank you for doing that. And then a little bit of oh, excuse me, .77 Ether.
00:37:37.386 - 00:37:44.670, Speaker A: It's real cheap. The gas will cost you a lot more than the actual price of the NFD, let me tell you. About $10 in total right now.
00:37:44.820 - 00:37:54.034, Speaker B: Okay, so Ryan just minted one. So thank you for donating to the Gitcoin Advocacy Round and that's going out. And thank you for supporting Crypto, Ryan. I appreciate that.
00:37:54.072 - 00:38:07.862, Speaker A: I also burnt some ETH in that transaction. That's awesome. So we are fighting back. We are pushing back on this, David. We actually have Paul, the chief legal officer at Coinbase, coming on the show a little bit later, too. What's happening there?
00:38:07.916 - 00:38:22.058, Speaker B: Yeah, it will be out by the time the bankless station is listening to this. So Thursday night we are live streaming with Paul, who is going to come on, and we're going to talk to him about suing the SEC. So that's going to be pretty sweet. Looking forward to that one.
00:38:22.224 - 00:38:23.502, Speaker A: I can't wait to hear.
00:38:23.636 - 00:38:27.502, Speaker B: I prefer to talking to the bad cop in this scenario. Yeah.
00:38:27.556 - 00:38:48.374, Speaker A: David, another fight for crypto, though, is the mainstream narrative. That's a fight. I think we still need to put in some work on. John Oliver on his show last week. Tonight covered crypto. It's his second major crypto episode in about a 25 minutes segment. And I think he really expresses what the mainstream thinks about crypto right now.
00:38:48.374 - 00:39:16.526, Speaker A: Of course, he covered the events of 2022. So he talked about FCX, he talked about Terra, he talked about Celsius, and his conclusion was pretty much that crypto is mostly a scam, almost 100% a scam. And I don't blame him necessarily for reaching that conclusion given 2022, and yet it falls so short. So David, I think we should maybe play some clips and give the bankless listeners a flavor of what the conversation was.
00:39:16.628 - 00:40:09.486, Speaker F: But FCX has been just one of the many dominoes that fell in the crypto world over the past two years. The market value of all cryptocurrencies fell from around 3 trillion in late 2021 to around 1 trillion last year. And there are small investors who got badly hurt by all of this. One in five Americans has invested in, traded or used cryptocurrency and you can find countless stories of people losing most of their life savings in the recent implosions underscoring that everyone in crypto was never actually going to make it, no matter how much Randy Zuckerberg scream sang otherwise. So tonight we thought we'd take a look at what has been happening in the world of crypto by looking at three of the biggest collapses over the past year. Each of these companies was founded on the promise that they would replace some part of our financial system. There is Terra, a cryptocurrency, Celsius a crypto bank, and FTX, a crypto trading platform.
00:40:09.486 - 00:40:17.598, Speaker F: In theory, they were supposed to be our next dollar, our next bank of America, and our next stock exchange. But in reality they are fiascos.
00:40:17.694 - 00:40:24.340, Speaker A: So far. David, he's not wrong on these takes. These are the exact takes that we had in 2022.
00:40:25.110 - 00:40:37.670, Speaker B: Well, we didn't think these about not these specifically, but we are replacing the dollar, we are replacing the stock exchange. It's not FTX, it's uniswap, it's not Terra. It might be something like Dai.
00:40:39.070 - 00:40:41.030, Speaker A: It's not celsius. It's DeFi.
00:40:41.110 - 00:40:41.546, Speaker B: Right?
00:40:41.648 - 00:40:42.986, Speaker A: Yeah, that's the thing.
00:40:43.168 - 00:40:45.420, Speaker B: These are our narratives, these are the words.
00:40:46.190 - 00:40:49.654, Speaker A: He's not wrong, is what I'm saying. Let's play another clip.
00:40:49.782 - 00:41:35.030, Speaker F: Just as a reminder, every single crypto coin is just something someone with a laptop made up. That is true for all of them, like dogecoin, Catcoin, panda coin, furry coin, come, rocket, elon, sperm and monkey jizz. Those are all real, by the way. We were going to come up with a fake one as a joke, but then we saw monkey jizz and it felt like a hat on a hat. To the extent any of these coins have value, it's based on whether people believe they do, which often comes down to their confidence in the person or group who made the coin. And that basic fact makes the crypto business very attractive to a certain type of person. One columnist who's covered this intensively sums it up like this if you are running a scam, you will be drawn to crypto.
00:41:35.030 - 00:41:41.242, Speaker F: You are running a confidence game. And crypto offers the most efficient market for turning confidence into money.
00:41:41.376 - 00:41:44.062, Speaker A: David, I mean, he's also right about that.
00:41:44.116 - 00:41:59.394, Speaker B: Right? Also right about that. Money is a confidence game. That's what we've been saying on Bankless this entire time. He's just applying it in this more narrow it's like, yeah, the largest, most chess pounder dude or developer is the new winner in this world.
00:41:59.592 - 00:42:04.578, Speaker A: Well, the idea that scammers are attracted to crypto is also right.
00:42:04.664 - 00:42:12.146, Speaker B: We've also talked about this. Yeah, he's right about everything so far. Okay, so that was 3.3 million views.
00:42:12.258 - 00:42:23.802, Speaker A: Yeah. This is mainstream. This is what mainstream actually thinks. And they're not wrong about FTX and Celsius and Terra. I mean, they're exactly right. But let's finish with the conclusion here, which is where I think John Oliver goes off track.
00:42:23.936 - 00:43:02.130, Speaker F: And the thing is, there are still companies out there making all the same claims that you've seen tonight. And I'm not saying that they are all scams. Maybe these three are the exceptions, although they would be joining all the other exceptions that we haven't had time to talk about tonight. From BitConnect to quadriga to so many more. But the truth is, in a financial system where the only real currency is confidence, scammers are going to thrive. And I know that we usually like to point to a solution at the end of our stories and that often means calling for more regulation, but I'm not sure that's a good idea here. The danger is regulation might give this sector more legitimacy.
00:43:02.130 - 00:43:32.782, Speaker F: It'll make a risky investment look safe when it is clearly not. And that in turn might entice banks to start getting more involved in crypto, giving the sector even more legitimacy and also exposing all of us to its volatility. It really says a lot that one of the leading advocates for the government to strongly regulate crypto was Sam Bankman. Fried. And look, I'm absolutely not saying that we should get rid of crypto entirely. It could eventually be useful, maybe the third time that we talk about it. We'll all be using a digital coin to buy everything.
00:43:32.782 - 00:43:54.662, Speaker F: I doubt it, but I can't predict the future. After all, I'm no Jim Kramer, but we should recognize that right now the main thing you can really do with crypto is gamble with more crypto. This is all still a casino. So if you do want to invest, do your own due diligence. Never put in more than you can afford to lose. And if you ever see someone doing.
00:43:54.716 - 00:44:04.010, Speaker B: This, this is Alex Machinsky doing like the Archer post. That was a rough conclusion. That was a rough conclusion.
00:44:04.590 - 00:44:07.242, Speaker A: Not entirely wrong, but what parts are rough to you?
00:44:07.376 - 00:44:23.390, Speaker B: Oh, how we shouldn't regulate it to give it legitimacy, because then if you give it legitimacy, it might integrate and the regular financial system will absorb the scams and the volatility of crypto. Like no, you regulate it so you get rid of the scams and volatility.
00:44:23.730 - 00:44:34.478, Speaker A: See, I'm not saying we should do that either. But this though, David, is the narrative that crypto is up against in 2023. And it's both kind of a headwind.
00:44:34.574 - 00:44:36.674, Speaker B: This is what 2021 costs us.
00:44:36.872 - 00:45:35.286, Speaker A: 2022 cost us? Yeah, it's both a headwind 2021, like you're talking about the bull market run up and 2022 is when the scammers exactly. That whole period, the last bull market cost us this. Yes, exactly. Here's I think the interesting part about this and why I think there's an opportunity for me, the scam slamming he just did was actually cathartic. I mean, we did a lot of that ourselves, and the ridicule for SBF and Doug Kwan and Machinsky is totally deserved. But the conclusion that all crypto is a scam, that's where I think there's some hubris, right? And I think the problem with the mainstream narrative here is you can finish John Oliver's show and I watched the whole thing and you could feel like you completely understand crypto, right? Like that is I guess the hidden problem with a show like this is you're like, oh, that crypto, the everything that was going on, the big price run up, it was just a bunch of scams. Ha, I thought so.
00:45:35.286 - 00:46:37.018, Speaker A: And then you're going to dismiss it and you're going to miss out on the alternative to Celsius, which is DeFi, and the alternative to FTX, which are uniswap and coinbase type regulated exchanges and Kraken. And you can miss the alternative to a stable coin, for instance, like Terra, and you'll miss something like Die and everything, all the innovation that's going on. So the reason it's an opportunity, David, is because I think right now, just like in 2019, when crypto was dead and the cycles before that, we're getting the same sentiment. And I am happy to have the counter trade to that because I think this is what the mainstream narrative thinks right now. And so to me, this is a massive buying opportunity. If you believe the opposite, if you believe that crypto isn't a scam, if you believe there is real innovation here, if you believe that stablecoins will be absolutely massive, if you believe that DeFi will actually change the world and be the way we bank in the future, this is a massive counter trade opportunity.
00:46:37.184 - 00:46:55.258, Speaker B: No, that's exactly right. Yeah. This is a great signal of when you are being a contrarian investor about something that, you know, have high confidence in being right about. It gives me 2018 to 2020 vibes when we felt that about Ethereum.
00:46:55.354 - 00:47:02.046, Speaker A: Dare we call this a bottom signal? Oh, certainly. I mean, it's one of the bottom signals, right? In the same way Randy Zuckerberg video was the top signal.
00:47:02.078 - 00:47:41.040, Speaker B: We're all going to make sure also John Oliver's audience is the exact kind of people I'm going to blanket statement here is like all of the people who were bitter about the crypto people making a bunch of money in 2021, 2022, this show is for them. They want to watch this show and be like, oh, I'm so right. I believe in myself. Yeah. All the crypto haters that got bitter that their crypto friend made a bunch of money I'll call them fart smellers are watching this show and being like, yeah, that's great.
00:47:42.450 - 00:47:43.806, Speaker A: That's totally what happened.
00:47:43.908 - 00:47:59.110, Speaker B: Right? And so that is his audience. Right? And that's why the conclusion he has of, like, don't even give it any illegitimacy. Don't even regulate it. The conclusion of that show doesn't matter. It doesn't have to be a good take for him to conclude to get the views, to get the people to smell their farts.
00:48:00.810 - 00:48:06.054, Speaker A: That's exactly how he was going to end the show on exactly that note, because that's what the audience wanted.
00:48:06.172 - 00:48:17.722, Speaker B: Right? And you know that he would never produce a counter show in the peak of a market talking about how the crypto is doing the crypto thing. You would never see that. You would only ever see the show in the bear market.
00:48:17.856 - 00:48:23.910, Speaker A: Yeah, crypto gave him all of the ammo to produce that show that he needs.
00:48:24.000 - 00:48:26.414, Speaker B: We just served that to him on a not.
00:48:26.452 - 00:48:43.250, Speaker A: Do not blame him at all for that take. I'm just pointing out that it's an incredibly shallow take. That's what the overall mainstream narrative thinks about crypto right now. And so if you counter trade that, I think it could be a good move right now if you believe the opposite. David, what do we have coming up next?
00:48:43.320 - 00:49:12.278, Speaker B: Coming up next, we got some updates on the Binance Voyager deal. Sad for Voyager. We're also going to talk about SBS Mom, of all people. SBS mom. I won't sing the song. Lens launching in layer three, and Salana has got a thing that's making me feel things, and we're going to talk about that. But first, we're going to talk to all of these sponsors that make this show possible, especially MetaMask, who, if we're using all these weird crypto words, crypto jargon MetaMask has a product for you called MetaMask Learn.
00:49:12.278 - 00:49:12.974, Speaker B: Let's go hear about it.
00:49:13.012 - 00:49:56.950, Speaker C: Learning about crypto is hard until now. Introducing MetaMask Learn, an open educational platform about crypto, Web Three, self custody, wallet management, and all the other topics needed to onboard people into this crazy world of crypto. MetaMask Learn is an interactive platform, with each lesson offering a simulation for the task at hand, giving you actual practical experience for navigating Web three. The purpose of MetaMask Learn is to teach people the basics of self custody and wallet security in a safe environment. And while MetaMask Learn always takes the time to define Web Three specific vocabulary, it is still a jargon free experience for the crypto. Curious, user friendly, not scary. MetaMask Learn is available in ten languages, with more to be added soon, and it's meant to cater to a global Web Three audience.
00:49:56.950 - 00:50:47.258, Speaker C: So are you tired of having to explain crypto concepts to your friends? Go to learn MetaMask IO and add MetaMask Learn to your guides to get onboarded into the world of Web Three. Arbitrum One is pioneering the world of secure ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the Web Three landscape. Hundreds of projects have already deployed on Arbitrum One, producing flourishing DFI and NFT ecosystems. With a recent addition of Arbitrum, nova gaming and social DApps like Reddit are also now calling arbitram home. Both Arbitrum One and Nova leverage the security and decentralization of ethereum and provide a builder experience that's intuitive familiar and fully EVM compatible. On Arbitrum, both builders and users will experience faster transaction speeds with significantly lower gas fees. With arbitrum's recent migration to Arbitrum Nitro, it's also now ten times faster than before.
00:50:47.258 - 00:51:00.510, Speaker C: Visit Arbitrum IO, where you can join the community, dive into the developer docs, bridge your assets, and start building your first DAP with Arbitrum experience Web Three development the way it was meant to be secure, fast, cheap, and friction free.
00:51:00.580 - 00:51:35.270, Speaker B: Voyager tweets out. Today, we received a letter from Finance terminating the asset purchase agreement. Well, as development is disappointing, our Chapter Eleven plan allows us for direct distribution of cash and crypto to customers via the Voyager platform. So Finance, US is backing out of the crypto deal. They cite regulatory challenges for that termination of that deal. And so Finance says, while our hope throughout this process was to help Voyager's customers access their crypto in kind, the hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States has introduced an unpredictable operating environment impacting the entire American business community. Oof.
00:51:35.270 - 00:51:39.878, Speaker B: Thanks, Gary. So, poor One, now they're blaming regulators.
00:51:39.894 - 00:51:46.554, Speaker A: For not doing this. So Voyager, of course, was like another celsius in that a bunch of depositors were left holding the bag retail.
00:51:46.602 - 00:51:52.894, Speaker B: Yeah, they were. Well, Voyager lend 3 hours capital, $600 million unsecured. So that was pretty dumb of them of retail money.
00:51:52.932 - 00:52:19.606, Speaker A: They did a ton of dumb things, but this was also an opportunity for all of the creditors to actually do a little bit better than kind of a pure asset sale bankruptcy. And Binance is blaming that on regulators for not going through it. But imagine if you're a Voyager creditor. This is basically what happened to you. First you thought FTX was going to save you, and then FTX imploded. Then you thought Binance was going to save you, and then the US blocked the sale. Now the court allows the sale to go through, then Binance pulls out.
00:52:19.606 - 00:52:34.046, Speaker A: That's the full story. If you're a Voyager creditor and you had funds tied up in Voyager. Very sad. Just getting dunked in the tank again and again and again. Feels bad to have put money in any kind of, quote unquote crypto bank these days.
00:52:34.148 - 00:52:39.280, Speaker B: Yeah, and it's because of Gary. It's because of Gary. 100%. Right, right.
00:52:39.730 - 00:52:59.506, Speaker A: Gary and everything that represents he's become the main character for Operation Chokepoint. So. Yes, I agree. It's operation chokepoint. It's Gary Gensler and friends. Speaking of friends, does SBF have any friends left? David I guess his parents are still friendly because he's living back at home with mom and dad. And now there's some scrutiny on SBF's parents.
00:52:59.506 - 00:53:00.182, Speaker A: What's going on?
00:53:00.236 - 00:53:50.230, Speaker B: Yeah. So a judge has approved restrictions for SBF's parents. So SBF's mom and dad are now getting strict cell phone monitoring while he is under house arrest because they are fearful that SBF will just say, hey, mom, can I use your phone? So a consultant will one tweet mom just one post. A consultant will review keystroke, logs, and screenshots of Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried's cell phones at least three times per week. Monitoring software are on the Bankman Fried's parents'phones and they photograph the user every five minutes to make sure it's not Sam. So the phone takes a picture every five minutes, and if Sam Bankman Fried's face is there, they get in trouble. Dude, that's hilarious.
00:53:51.530 - 00:54:23.870, Speaker A: How mad would you be at your son if this was, like, the situation here? The weird thing about this, though, is we don't know if that they're innocent parties at like there seems to be a lot of evidence that they may have actually been tied up in this whole criminal. Like, I think like Nick Carter and friends call it the Crime Family or yeah, crime syndicate. And so you don't know how deeply they're involved. But it's hilarious to think SBF back at home can't use mom and Dad's cell phone. Even completely walked out of that.
00:54:23.940 - 00:54:29.742, Speaker B: It's so funny. I have so many jokes I can make, and we just need to move on or else I'll make them. Lens protocol.
00:54:29.806 - 00:54:30.820, Speaker A: What are they doing?
00:54:31.270 - 00:54:45.766, Speaker B: Optimistic layer three solution. So, Lens deploying a layer three to process transactions at hyper scale, they say, and designed to support the next generation of Web three social users. This is called it a roll app. An app chain as a roll up.
00:54:45.788 - 00:54:48.038, Speaker A: As a layer three roll app. Yeah.
00:54:48.124 - 00:54:49.414, Speaker B: You've heard that before, right?
00:54:49.532 - 00:54:51.606, Speaker A: No, that's the first time I've heard that term.
00:54:51.638 - 00:55:06.522, Speaker B: Well, I sadly can't take credit for that one, but to you, I will. So, yeah, lens layer three roll app. I'm assuming this is deployed on Polygon because that's where Lens is. So cool. Bonsai is what they're calling it because of the whole plant metaphor.
00:55:06.666 - 00:55:08.014, Speaker A: That's very cool.
00:55:08.212 - 00:55:28.162, Speaker B: Dev connect Istanbul. Ryan this is not necessarily for the Bankless nation, although they're welcome to listen to this announcement about DevConnect. Istanbul 2023. This is actually for me to you to tell you that I'm going to be in Istanbul in the 13th to the 19 November for DevConnect. Also, if any listeners wants to come, I'll be there too.
00:55:28.296 - 00:55:30.978, Speaker A: DevConnect is different than DevCon, right? David yeah.
00:55:30.984 - 00:55:40.230, Speaker B: So think of it like a binary star system, and one's bigger than the other. And this is the little star, but they rotate and so it goes. DevCon, DevConnect. DevCon. DevConnect. Every like nine. Months or so.
00:55:40.380 - 00:55:44.118, Speaker A: Oh, man, you're traveling all over the world, David. Are you ever at home anymore?
00:55:44.214 - 00:55:46.026, Speaker B: God, it has been a while.
00:55:46.208 - 00:55:51.280, Speaker A: It has been a while. But tell us about this. So you are excited about a.
00:55:53.010 - 00:55:54.238, Speaker B: Solana project?
00:55:54.324 - 00:56:06.154, Speaker A: Yeah, it's an NFT project. So maybe people would have suspected that's the way they get you. They hook you into the Solana community. Mad Labs. MadLabs? What is it?
00:56:06.292 - 00:56:26.918, Speaker B: I mean, I don't know. It's an NFT project. They look really cool. Their volume was the number one most traded volume, at least in the last seven days. So they are just eking above board apes and mutant apes. And so this is why this is news, because they are dominating the seven day volume, at least on NFT sales. The mint went live.
00:56:26.918 - 00:56:40.010, Speaker B: They had some mint drama, but they're past that. I think they look pretty cool. I like the art. I like the art. I do not own one because I don't know how to use Salana.
00:56:40.990 - 00:56:42.058, Speaker A: Wait, what'd you say?
00:56:42.144 - 00:56:51.450, Speaker B: Wait, what did you say? I've never used I own some soul tokens that I bought at, like, $9 or something. But, yeah, super easy on coinbase.
00:56:51.530 - 00:56:58.286, Speaker A: Just grab a phantom wallet, just connect. I've done stuff on Salana. I have a podcast NFT on Salana.
00:56:58.318 - 00:57:03.842, Speaker B: Yeah, I know. Okay, I'll go buy one of these on Salana, and I'll be the first.
00:57:03.976 - 00:57:06.998, Speaker A: You heard it. Salana Community. You heard it. Here. Tweet it out when you do.
00:57:07.084 - 00:57:22.442, Speaker B: I mean, look at these. They're pretty cool looking. So, like the 20s, mobster themed. It's like a comic book noir theme. I think I'd say like a noir movie type. Yeah, I think they're pretty cool. I think they're pretty cool.
00:57:22.576 - 00:57:27.050, Speaker A: Yeah, I get this I vibe with this denominate in Seoul. If you buy it, though.
00:57:27.120 - 00:57:29.420, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know about that one.
00:57:30.270 - 00:57:30.778, Speaker A: Okay.
00:57:30.864 - 00:57:34.734, Speaker B: Anyways, moving on. You want to take this one?
00:57:34.852 - 00:58:24.922, Speaker A: Well, David, we can't just talk about U s regulatory system. We gotta talk about what's going on in Europe. Mika we did an entire episode on this legislation. Looks like it is going through. After more than two and a half years of consultation, heated debates, last minute amendments, and very close votes in the committee, the EU's parliament today passed the new EU crypto framework with an impressive majority, 517 MEPs for and 38 votes against. This is the most comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto that's ever been passed by any major government body. We did an entire episode on this, and the conclusion from our crypto EU Mika experts was this was about a B minus in terms of its quality and its goodness for crypto.
00:58:24.922 - 00:58:41.774, Speaker A: So it could have been a lot worse. We could have had a failing grade, an F or a D or something like that. Average would have been C. They rated it as B minus. I think I mostly agree with that. It leaves much to be desired, but it provides some clarity. Like, for instance, Europe.
00:58:41.774 - 00:59:07.926, Speaker A: David doesn't have the problem of is Ether a security or a commodity or not? There's no Gary Gensler of Europe blocking all of these things. It's quite clearly detailed as to what the nature of Ether, the asset is. It's a commodity in EU legislation. A few comments from the panel that we talked to. The US is getting its pants beat by global regulation. As a comment.
00:59:08.038 - 00:59:10.490, Speaker B: We're getting our pants beat by a B minus. Nice.
00:59:10.560 - 00:59:34.558, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a B minus ahead, but there's still room for the EU to fail here. There's some other regulation that might be upcoming. AMLR, the Data Act is one of them. There's some more. So before anyone in the US. Says we're moving to Europe and throws that party, I think we've got to get through this heavier regulation and see where we come out on the other side. So there's still room to fail the semester.
00:59:34.558 - 00:59:39.366, Speaker A: This is just one test, but B minus on the first test. It's better than the United States, that's for sure.
00:59:39.468 - 01:00:06.894, Speaker B: Okay. All right. I don't know if I should be optimistic or pessimistic B minus. My first reaction is like, B minus cool. We can start from there and get better, but then I guess you could start from there, get worse anyways you can, whatever. So some of the most boomer news that we'll ever put into a weekly roll up, TransUnion, the credit scoring company, is working with some partners to deliver credit scoring to blockchain. Hey, that's cool though.
01:00:06.894 - 01:00:25.362, Speaker B: TLDR they are allowing they're basically being an oracle for credit scores on a blockchain. So you have your credit score, your FICO score. Yeah, you can put that on a blockchain so that something like Aave could review that credit score and be like, okay, I'll give this person a line of credit. It's not going to work exactly like that. But that's kind of the deal.
01:00:25.416 - 01:00:26.580, Speaker A: I think it's awesome.
01:00:26.890 - 01:00:39.334, Speaker B: It's not a terrible use case. It's private as well, so you can get some privacy. It's one of the earliest, most primitive building blocks for building, like uncollateralized lending. It's a thing.
01:00:39.452 - 01:00:43.626, Speaker A: Cool. We do need credit in DeFi. We have none. It's all collateral backed loans at this point.
01:00:43.648 - 01:00:44.380, Speaker B: We need credit.
01:00:44.830 - 01:00:50.490, Speaker A: Speaking of releases, Fee has released something here. Phi. That's Fee. What are they doing?
01:00:50.640 - 01:01:12.530, Speaker B: Fee land. So this is like a super cute project that I just think is awesome. Feline, we talked about it before. It's like this 3D landscape for building a little metaverse for yourself that you put objects on based off of what you've done in your Ethereum wallet. So if you've traded on uniswap, you get a little uniswap building. If you've bought on OpenSea, you get a little OpenSea. Ship Bankless has got some stuff.
01:01:12.530 - 01:01:40.586, Speaker B: So if you're a freeland user, you got some bankless things that you can claim. So if you are a bank holder, you get a little wagon. If you are a podcast NFT holder, you get a little cute little version of me and Ryan little icon to claim. If you are a POAP holder, you get a wallpaper. So if you are a user of Affiliand, if you're not a user of Feline, you should definitely check it out. It's like the most fun identity web3 non financial app. So checks all those boxes and it's just pretty fun.
01:01:40.586 - 01:02:02.738, Speaker B: It's also a great way to do you go on quests to claim these things, right? And so some of these are what we're looking at, these four quests that we've got. And so if you are a Feline user and you are a bankless nation member, you have some objects that you can go claim and go put in your little feline. So go do that and then take a screenshot and tweet it and tag bankless so we can see and we'll retweet it.
01:02:02.824 - 01:02:08.226, Speaker A: This is like your on chain resume or maybe like your on chain trophy case or something like this. It's just a lot of fun to.
01:02:08.248 - 01:02:13.606, Speaker B: Build your the artist behind this by the way, is the same artist for the nounsdale. This is why it's pixelated and looks like that.
01:02:13.708 - 01:02:17.254, Speaker A: Very cool. Another release this week, swell network. What are they up to?
01:02:17.372 - 01:02:42.794, Speaker B: Swell network, we've talked about them before. Live main net is now in public beta. So this is a staking as a service like rocket pool, like Lido, like all the other ones, brand new. Dao with plans to integrate distributed validator technology, which is some more technology that I get super hot on. And so they are launching, their main net is launched. So they would like you to join their community is their deal. And also stake.
01:02:42.842 - 01:03:02.198, Speaker A: Yeah, should also mention both Fee and Swell. Dave and I are angel investors in these projects. Really excited about them. Jobs of the week. David, speaking of excitement here, we got some jobs at Coinbase, a staff blockchain engineer, a staff smart contract engineer. I think working with Jesse Powell and team.
01:03:02.364 - 01:03:04.438, Speaker B: Jesse is a nice guy. We like what I've heard.
01:03:04.524 - 01:03:23.450, Speaker A: Phantom software engineer, mobile. Phantom is hiring a software engineer. Front end. They just released their wallet, by the way, the Polygon and Ethereum, awesome project, lots of jobs here today. Premium wants a web3 product management and architect. Daenera wants a smart contract engineer. Uniswap Labs needs a senior back end engineer.
01:03:23.450 - 01:03:27.306, Speaker A: Senior product designers for Uniswap as well. There's a ton of jobs.
01:03:27.338 - 01:03:35.146, Speaker B: Dude, scroll down. There's so many jobs. There are so many. Look how many jobs. Look how many jobs there are. It keeps on growing. It's one of those things that you keep on scrolling and it keeps on loading.
01:03:35.146 - 01:03:36.010, Speaker B: There's so many jobs.
01:03:36.090 - 01:03:40.798, Speaker A: Crypto, this is a bear market in crypto and it's still hiring like crazy, which is impressive.
01:03:40.894 - 01:04:02.534, Speaker B: Coming up next, we got the questions from the nation. We're going to talk about AI and blockchain and what that intersection looks like. So that's the question from the nation. It's also similar. A take from the week Chamath Polyapatia from the all in podcast gives a take that crypto is dead. Do we disagree with that take or do we not disagree with that take? We'll talk about that and then we're going to talk about what we are bullish on. So all of that and more.
01:04:02.534 - 01:04:06.598, Speaker B: But first I want to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible.
01:04:06.764 - 01:04:39.134, Speaker C: The phantom wallet is coming to Ethereum. The number one wallet on Solana is bringing its millions of users and beloved UX to Ethereum and Polygon. If you haven't used Phantom before, you've been missing out. Phantom was one of the first wallets to pioneer Solana staking inside the wallet and will be offering similar staking features for ethereum and polygon. But that's just staking. Phantom is also the best home for your NFTs. Phantom has a complete set of features to optimize your NFT experience, pin your favorites, hide your Uglies, burn the spam, and also manage your NFT sale listings from inside the wallet.
01:04:39.134 - 01:04:59.834, Speaker C: Phantom is of course a multi chain wallet, but it makes chain management easy, displaying your transactions in a human readable format with automatic warnings for malicious transactions or phishing websites. Phantom has already saved over 20,000 users from getting scammed or hacked. So get on the Phantom Waitlist and be one of the first to access the MultiChain beta. There's a link in the show notes, or you can go to Phantom app.
01:04:59.952 - 01:05:01.050, Speaker B: Waitlist to get access.
01:05:01.120 - 01:05:10.174, Speaker C: In late February, Bankless is launching the Bankless Token Hub. At Bankless, we've been studying the crypto markets ever since 2017 and all of our research has led us to this.
01:05:10.212 - 01:05:10.634, Speaker B: The token.
01:05:10.682 - 01:05:11.034, Speaker A: Hub.
01:05:11.082 - 01:05:40.434, Speaker C: You're a onestop shop for alpha to help you navigate through the crypto markets. Have you ever wished for a trusted resource that would share their thoughts, ratings and their opinions about tokens? Boy, do we have the product for you. The Bankless Token Hub is where we provide bankless citizens with the alpha on the hottest tokens in crypto. We do the research so you don't have to. The Bankless Token Hub includes the Token Ratings, where our team shares their research and outlook on the hottest tokens in crypto. Also, the Token hub includes bankless bags. Our own internal investment club.
01:05:40.434 - 01:06:18.098, Speaker C: Bankless Bags is where we put our money, where our mouth is, and for the bankless power user out there, you can access the analyst team 24/7 inside the Bankless Nation Discord. You can ask them questions and learn from a group of people deep in the weeds of crypto investing. The last feature of the Token Hub is the ability to upvote or downvote Token Ratings. The Bankless Token Hub lets you learn from your fellow citizens to rate these tokens yourselves. The Bankless Token Hub is launching right now, and it's already been beta tested by your fellow Bankless citizens. So stay tuned in the Bankless discord for updates. And if you're not a Bankless citizen, well, you better sign up if you want access because this corner of Bankless is available for citizens only.
01:06:18.098 - 01:06:19.442, Speaker C: I'll see you in the discord.
01:06:19.586 - 01:06:22.998, Speaker A: We have a question from Rocket Pollster this week. David, you ready for this?
01:06:23.084 - 01:06:24.120, Speaker B: Yeah, hit me.
01:06:24.490 - 01:07:19.482, Speaker A: Rocket Pollster goes, given a future of AI deepfakes disinformation and blockchains, what companies and projects are at the forefront of ensuring provenance and how is in brackets, hardware question mark. So we acknowledge all of these problems with AI becoming like we don't know who the robots are online, whether the robots created this piece of content or a human did. And robots are like infinitely scalable, very cheap to spin up. We've always had sort of when it was just the humans on the internet, there was a cost to kind of producing information and now there's this ability to mass spread all sorts of information that's not credible, all sorts of things. So is there a blockchain solution to this or is there any solution to this that you've seen? Yeah.
01:07:19.536 - 01:08:00.694, Speaker B: So really prescient question, I'd say. I think there is. And dare I say, Rocket Pulser is looking for Alpha about like, okay, what are the companies here? Because they're probably, I'm assuming that they are bullish on the intersection of AI and crypto and specifically Providence. Right. This is one of the really early use cases of crypto that we've seen before. Once upon a time, there was fake news shared about Vitalik's death and Vitalik's assassination and the ether price started to plummet. And so Vitalik took a selfie with a piece of paper of the current block height of ethereum and just to prove that it was recent enough.
01:08:00.694 - 01:08:02.342, Speaker B: And then tweeted like proof of life.
01:08:02.396 - 01:08:02.662, Speaker A: Right.
01:08:02.716 - 01:08:19.914, Speaker B: Proof of life. Right. And then the press recovered and we moved on. So you could use the same sort of format with AI. Right. And this is just called Timestamping. You just submit a hash and a block about the origination of some content before you release it to the public.
01:08:19.914 - 01:08:25.646, Speaker B: So that when everyone's like, what's the real source of this? You can prove that you have the most original piece of content.
01:08:25.828 - 01:08:27.886, Speaker A: You could sign that with a private key as well. Right.
01:08:27.908 - 01:08:39.054, Speaker B: Sign that with a private key. Right, yeah. And that's actually not really a revolution in cryptography or cryptocurrency. That is a revolution in database design as a blockchain. That's a database solution.
01:08:39.102 - 01:08:41.694, Speaker A: And cryptography, it's totally a cryptography solution.
01:08:41.742 - 01:09:02.226, Speaker B: Yes. It's actually a solution that's absent of the currency other than we need a system to secure the database and that's what we need the currency for anyways. I digress. I kind of see two venues here. There is the venue of just like, identity. So like WorldCoin is implicitly going after this. Any sort of identity on a blockchain.
01:09:02.226 - 01:09:18.862, Speaker B: The identity play is a part of this like provenance in the world of AI. We need human AI. You can trust me because you're listening to me on Bankless and I'm a human and you've been listening to me for a while and I'm going to tell you that I own David Hoffman ETH. So you can go to Davidhoffman ETH and you can assume that's a human.
01:09:18.916 - 01:09:26.146, Speaker A: Player and another human like me is going to socially verify that you own Davidhoffman ETH. Right. And that's kind of enough to prove that you're a human.
01:09:26.248 - 01:10:01.230, Speaker B: Yeah, but you're an AI. That does get precarious. So there could be more perfect ways of doing that. But what I'm saying is there are companies that will go directly after this problem and then there are other ways that are adjacent to this that provide solutions to this problem. Adjacently, and that's the identity world. And then perhaps there are companies that are going directly after this, which is just like a timestamping company. I remember in 2017 there was like an ICO that was like a timestamping company on Bitcoin and for some reason the Bitcoiners thought it was bullish.
01:10:01.230 - 01:10:10.990, Speaker B: But I don't know of any I can't name any specific ones, but that is a worthwhile place of research to explore, I would say.
01:10:11.140 - 01:10:27.730, Speaker A: I think it's huge. I think it's so important. Yeah. This tidal wave of manipulative content is about to hit the internet. So we got to find out who the humans are and who the robots are. It's also a national security threat. This is kind of nation state, like when nation states can attack other nation states with robo propaganda.
01:10:27.730 - 01:10:57.710, Speaker A: How do you actually this is just a massive tidal wave that's going to hit everybody. And what I've seen, David, is we have the building blocks in crypto. It's going to be something crypto or crypto adjacent. Like we have the ability to store uncensorable provable data on computers that are always running, cannot be taken down, cannot be censored. We got that. We got the private key cryptography and kind of the management. We have some of the early stages of identity type systems.
01:10:57.710 - 01:11:08.610, Speaker A: WorldCoin kind of takes it to the we can actually prove a human using like iris scan type data. And by the way, I think we want to get WorldCoin on the podcast at some point to discuss this.
01:11:08.680 - 01:11:12.610, Speaker B: Oh, it's scheduled. We have that scheduled. Sam Altman and the co founder are coming on.
01:11:12.760 - 01:11:44.974, Speaker A: I haven't seen anybody who's put this together in a way that's like scalable and going to work. There's like a lot of slides and a lot of companies promising and decentralized. Identity has been a theme. Verifiable credentials have been a thing that people have talked about. But who is actually putting it all together? A lot of talk, right? But who's actually putting it together and making it scalable and making it ready for the world? So the solution is completely clear. I feel very strongly it's going to be crypto or crypto adjacent. What can I invest in? Where's the alpha? That's what I want.
01:11:44.974 - 01:11:55.306, Speaker A: I'm kind of back with rocket pollster. And the truth is I haven't quite seen the project that really excites me on this yet. But it's got to come, right? We got to solve this. Someone's going to solve it.
01:11:55.428 - 01:12:09.094, Speaker B: Yeah. I think the big question is just like, does this get solved emergently by a collection of adjacent technologies, like I was saying? Or is there one particular startup that's going to attack all this problem head? Like, that's an interesting question.
01:12:09.292 - 01:12:26.874, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. All right, we'll keep our eyes peeled. Let you guys Rocket Pollster, let's get to some takes this week. David, the first take is one we teased earlier from Chamath from the All In podcast. He says, David, crypto is dead in America. I saw this tweet from CNBC. He said, in the US.
01:12:26.874 - 01:12:44.874, Speaker A: It's dead, but I think we should go straight to the source and actually hear what he said in context. So let's play that. I was just curious to get your thoughts. SEC obviously sent a Wells notice. We talked about this before. To Brian Armstrong of Coinbase. He said he's thinking about or considering relocating out of the US.
01:12:44.874 - 01:13:19.462, Speaker A: If the regulatory clarity does not improve. Crypto is dead in America. It is dead in America. Crypto is dead in America. I mean, now you had Gensler, you had Gensler even blaming the banking crisis on so they've, the United States authorities have firmly pointed their guns at crypto. Is it scapegoat or was it a fuck around, find out moment for crypto in your mind or a little bit of both? I don't know. I just think that they were probably the ones that were the most threatening to the establishment.
01:13:19.462 - 01:13:33.546, Speaker A: Okay. And they were the ones that, in fairness to the regulators, did push the boundaries more than any other sector of the startup economy. And yeah, so now they're paying the price for that. The bill has come due for them. What do you think about that take, Dave?
01:13:33.578 - 01:13:53.142, Speaker B: I love how they talk about this. They talk about us as like, all of them. The crypto industry, I'm like, we do the same things. Of course everyone does this. But it's like, interesting blanket in industry with the crypto people. Their check has come due, right? I was like, that is not my check, Chamath. I didn't cash that one.
01:13:53.276 - 01:13:55.382, Speaker A: Well, what do you think of his overall take?
01:13:55.516 - 01:13:58.306, Speaker B: Yeah, that was our take for last week on the Weekly Roll.
01:13:58.338 - 01:14:01.910, Speaker A: I was like, yeah, crypto is dead in America.
01:14:02.330 - 01:14:12.622, Speaker B: That's a hyperbolic statement. Chamath is a little bit of a diva. All of these guys are a little bit of divas. So are we. Content producers are kind of divas. He's being a little bit of a diva. He's not wrong.
01:14:12.622 - 01:14:13.694, Speaker B: Everything he says, right?
01:14:13.812 - 01:14:43.462, Speaker A: By saying his statement so emphatically and hyperbolically, that's what you're saying. And you agree with the tone and the thrust of that statement, but I bet you'd have some quibbles with it's. Not actually dead in mean we haven't outlawed crypto. We just were in front of Congress last week and Gary Gensler was thoroughly grilled for his anti innovation, anti crypto posturing. I think for me it's a step too far to say crypto is dead in America 100%.
01:14:43.516 - 01:15:10.158, Speaker B: And I think if we were having a conversation with him and we were nitpicking, he would become much more moderate about it. Just like as the high level headline, crypto is dead in America. Yeah. And it's a little bit of like a quote unquote bottom signal, right? He is presenting a specific snapshot in time and what he's saying a way to interpret this is like this is the worst moment in crypto's American relationship ever.
01:15:10.244 - 01:15:11.642, Speaker A: Yeah, that's accurate.
01:15:11.706 - 01:15:21.102, Speaker B: And Coinbase is going to sue the F out of Gary Gensler and the SEC and we're going to come back and so it's up only from here in terms of the health of our relationship with America.
01:15:21.166 - 01:15:50.938, Speaker A: I think so if he's also making the broader point, one purpose of the sound bite that headline on CNBC is like you could phrase this another way, the regulators or the government is killing crypto in America. That's also hyperbolic, but that also kind of like prompts for some action. Like what are you guys doing? You're screwing this up, you're leaving America behind. And I hope that's kind of the takeaway here too. I got some more takes here. David here is from Ethereum on a what are we looking at?
01:15:50.944 - 01:15:52.170, Speaker B: We're looking at some hardware here.
01:15:52.240 - 01:15:52.426, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:15:52.448 - 01:16:09.550, Speaker B: So I put this one in here. This is an Ethereum staking node. You can tell how close up we are to this tiny little box because of the blur effect on the camera. This has got to be what, three inches by three inches by one inch of a computer full computer. That's an ethereum staking node.
01:16:09.710 - 01:16:12.046, Speaker A: This is dissident.
01:16:12.078 - 01:16:30.662, Speaker B: I hate to phrase it this way, but it's so awesome. This is the smallest, most powerful dissident technology form factor that exists. This is a nation state. This is a network freedom technology. This is a freedom technology. This is ethereum. You cannot shut this down.
01:16:30.662 - 01:16:51.038, Speaker B: One of these things in every person's home in like one in 100 people's home, it doesn't matter. It's like so powerful. There's capital on this thing. It's verifying a network. It is an online network state. It is cryptography, it is cryptocurrency. It is just the instantiation of everything that is so cool about the frontier of technology, the industry that we are building.
01:16:51.038 - 01:17:04.034, Speaker B: And I hate to be an anti statist, I am an anti statist, but it's like big fu to nation states because look what we can do on top of our in our little computer box.
01:17:04.152 - 01:17:39.406, Speaker A: I actually don't think you're as anti statist as you just maybe express if somebody took that sound clip out is, I think, another way to put this. And guys, we're coming out with an episode on liberalism. The protocol of liberalism on Monday is not necessarily anti status. It is anti authoritarian, I think. And this is liberalism protocol preserving. So, property rights, censorship, resistance, freedom of speech, those things. And the amendments in the Constitution that we set up our Democratic Republic protocols with.
01:17:39.508 - 01:17:44.542, Speaker B: It's that kind of technology, a new institutional form factor. It's so awesome.
01:17:44.676 - 01:17:50.830, Speaker A: I know, it's awesome. I like that you pulled that out. I didn't know what you're going to say on that image, but that's way cooler.
01:17:50.910 - 01:18:14.314, Speaker B: This is the part two of this take, actually, so it continues. You'll be happy to hear it. So here's a take from Tycoon ETH. When your ETH Validator gets chosen to build a block, you got to step back and appreciate one of the greatest miracles of open source coordination and collaboration for 12 seconds, your tiny machine in your bedroom is responsible for carrying on a network worth billions of billions of dollars. It's so awesome.
01:18:14.432 - 01:18:27.534, Speaker A: It's so is. Wow. That's why I'm in this community, David. That's why I'm in this is. I really believe in this technology as a force for yeah, all right, cool. You got a take, too. Let me read.
01:18:27.534 - 01:18:42.274, Speaker A: David Hoffman's Take Bankless is an AI Alignment Podcast until further notice. Track record so far, eliza yudkowski. 99% chance of doom. Paul Cristiano, 50% chance of doom. I just recorded with somebody's Twitter name.
01:18:42.312 - 01:18:43.918, Speaker B: Is his name Muri?
01:18:44.014 - 01:18:49.270, Speaker A: He says there's a 95% chance of doom. Oh, that's bad news, David. Yeah, it's not 95% chance.
01:18:49.340 - 01:18:54.310, Speaker B: Yeah, the guy that works director of the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, he's at 95%.
01:18:54.460 - 01:19:06.582, Speaker A: He works with Elizardikowski, so I expected he'd be in, like, the but 95% isn't awesome. And then you finish it with this. Want ETH to hit ten k? We got to solve AI alignment.
01:19:06.726 - 01:19:07.274, Speaker B: I don't know.
01:19:07.312 - 01:19:19.040, Speaker A: I think we can hit ten K before that. But what's the good of your ten k e if the robots come and destroy it anyway, right? I think that's the take here. So what did you want to say about this?
01:19:19.970 - 01:19:30.782, Speaker B: Yeah, that's it. What's the word? Our hands are forced. Like, what's the point of doing anything else if we can't solve AI?
01:19:30.846 - 01:19:39.080, Speaker A: Why are we giving this one more special attention? There's all sorts of existential threats right there's nuclear, it's the biotech. Why do you think.
01:19:40.970 - 01:19:50.134, Speaker B: It'S one dimension higher than all other? It's the meta existential threat because it can cause all the other existential threats to happen or not happen.
01:19:50.252 - 01:19:55.946, Speaker A: I kind of agree with this. And the other thing is, if we get it right on the good side, it starts to solve all of the.
01:19:55.968 - 01:20:30.102, Speaker B: Other existential threats, potentially, not just so I'm here in Montenegro doing this whole network stake thing with a bunch of different experts from different corners of the world. And so Nate, I was talking to Nate the longest interview, I usually do 20 to 40 minutes interviews while I'm out here. I did over an hour with him. The last question and the last point that we point of things that we talked about is like all of the doom that these people feel because I started to get into the personals like, okay, dude, how do you wake up in the morning? How do you keep going when you are at 95%?
01:20:30.156 - 01:20:32.054, Speaker A: I'm glad you did that. I'm glad you got into that.
01:20:32.092 - 01:21:16.242, Speaker B: By the way, that was the end of it. And he just talked about like, same thing with Eliezer. Dude, I had my cry and then picked it up and I kept on going because what else am I going to do? I'm going to solve this problem. And then I did the whole bankless internal optimist thing because we're optimists and I'm like, okay, well, understanding that there's a 99% chance of doom that we can't solve AI problems, it's terminator, it's the worst, it's hell, it's all bad. We all get our atoms repurposed, all the bad stuff. That is the apparently most likely outcome for the AI alignment problem under the conditions that we do solve AI alignment. And I'm not saying that we know how to do that, but under the assumption that we do get there, we do thread that very small needle.
01:21:16.242 - 01:21:53.898, Speaker B: It's not just like, oh few, we solved AI alignment, we're not dying. It's actually all of the evils that we are trying to avoid invert and they go from evils to positive because we fix AI alignment. And so it not just goes like, oh no, few, we still get to operate society. Society starts to become literally perfect. It becomes a utopia, it becomes heaven because we solve the AI alignment and because we are working with them and they are producing the heaven that we want. And so maybe the 99% is bad, but the 1% chance that we solve AI alignment is so good, that telling.
01:21:53.914 - 01:21:55.134, Speaker A: Me there's a chance.
01:21:55.332 - 01:22:16.886, Speaker B: No, I'm not telling you that there's a chance. I'm telling you that if we do get through that chance, the other side of that chance is so cool and awesome because the AIS are doing cool stuff for us, alongside us, shoulder to shoulder with us, that that should be motivating and it cancels out how bad the 99% is. I don't know if it cancels it.
01:22:16.908 - 01:22:31.142, Speaker A: Out for me, but I think it's definitely the stakes are, like we don't often talk about the other side of this. If we do get it right, I mean, all of our episodes have been doomer, but I think it can solve a whole bunch of the existential problems that are outside of the category of AI.
01:22:31.206 - 01:22:36.160, Speaker B: Not just a whole bunch, all of them. That's the cool thing. It solves every problem.
01:22:36.610 - 01:22:43.150, Speaker A: Is that what you're bullish on this week, David? I think I saw that. Is this what you're bullish on AI crypto? Tell me what you're bullish on.
01:22:43.220 - 01:23:32.158, Speaker B: Yeah, so actually that goes back to rocket pulser's question and that topic I am bullish on. All of a sudden, this AI alignment problem is going to sweep the world slowly but surely. We're front running the opportunity here at Bankless with this. Eventually everyone's going to be talking about this because we're going to be faced with the problem. Crypto is going to provide some tools and some timestamping, like proof of humanity. Like all of this stuff is going to provide parts of the solution we need to live in an AI world and it's going to start to legitimize crypto because we've been thinking about these problems for the last decade and Web Two has not and nation states have not. We are creating future technologies in crypto that we need to live in an AI world and we've been building them for a decade now.
01:23:32.158 - 01:24:07.130, Speaker B: And so we as an industry are the most prepared to help humans live in a post AI world and that is going to be extremely legitimizing. And so AI is going to come in and then people will be like, okay, that crypto thing, we kind of need those guys. Thanks for building the identity stuff. And that's what I'm bullish on. Oh, I'm also bullish on prescient bankless listeners will notice that it's a different time in the day from the last pre sponsored break. That's because we had to pause the episode, go do like three meetings and then come back because Ryan and I are super busy in that amount of time. I bought one of the NFTs from earlier, the mad lads.
01:24:08.510 - 01:24:09.526, Speaker A: You did solana.
01:24:09.558 - 01:24:17.294, Speaker B: You did the Solana for the first time. So here's my little dude. I try to get one that looks like me. Did I get good enough?
01:24:17.412 - 01:24:23.758, Speaker A: Yeah, that's pretty good. So this is a mad, mad lad. Yeah, that's good. There you go.
01:24:23.924 - 01:24:26.740, Speaker B: I'm now bullish mad, lads. And I own one.
01:24:27.110 - 01:24:28.654, Speaker A: David is now a Solana bull.
01:24:28.702 - 01:24:29.966, Speaker B: I'm now a solana maxi.
01:24:29.998 - 01:24:33.330, Speaker A: Eat that. ETH maximalist. Sorry, he's turned.
01:24:35.190 - 01:24:38.980, Speaker B: Me. Okay, Ryan, what are you bullish on?
01:24:39.510 - 01:25:14.138, Speaker A: I am bullish that we won't go the way that the US won't go the way of China in terms of banning crypto. We're already seeing Europe do something that was much more measured with. That's great. But actually reflecting on the hearing the grilling of Gary Gensler last week, crypto has a lot of friends in Congress. Pretty surprised, right? Patrick McHenry, Tom Emmer these people, maybe hopefully they care about Western liberal values. They care about things like free speech, but even if they don't, maybe they're just doing this for the money or whatever. Crypto also has some of that too, like votes.
01:25:14.138 - 01:26:10.226, Speaker A: And so I'm bullish that we won't go their way of China. And I'm also bullish that we have a court system that can check nation state regulators and powers. I don't know if this works in all the countries around the world, but the fact that a company, an entrepreneur, can effectively sue the SEC Gary Gensler, and that there is another power, a higher power in the court system, a checking and balance on a regulator that wants to completely quash this industry, that's another bullish signal. I also think that we can win the court of opinion, right? So you heard the Brian Armstrong's like, hey, I started the company Entrepreneur. I decided to locate it in America. What Gensler is doing, he's driving this out of the US. How is it fair? How is it fair? How can you be called a credible regulator of securities when after seven years, you don't even know? You can't even tell us.
01:26:10.226 - 01:26:35.334, Speaker A: You won't give us the clarity on whether ether is a security or not. It's not that freaking hard. In fact, we saw those clips earlier. Gensler knew it was a commodity in 2018, it was obvious. And now he can't tell us it's a commodity. I think we win that battle in the court of public opinion. And I do think in a democracy, hopefully, that's what the US still is, has that semblance.
01:26:35.334 - 01:27:15.558, Speaker A: It calls itself a democracy that will matter as well. And so I think we win there too. So winning in Congress are early stages of turning the ties in Congress court system, check and balance. I think we can win the court of opinion as well. So all of this to say, this has almost been the year, we've been talking so much about regulators in 2023, and it's all because of the backlash of SBF and Doe Kwan and Machinsky in 2022. And I get it, but I feel like we've seen the worst. I don't want to say it's the bottom, like there could still be some things in Operation Choke Point that are happening, but I'm starting to see blue skies ahead and the tide turning a little bit.
01:27:15.558 - 01:27:22.330, Speaker A: And I don't think that this ends with kind of a US ban on crypto or some disaster scenario.
01:27:22.910 - 01:28:12.550, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's right. And when we were doing our ledger show, the state of the nation, we did yesterday, the chart show, for a brief moment, we were talking about how you and I got very bullish on ether in the 2018 to 2020 bear market. And it was perhaps one of the most contrarian things that you and I will ever do with our lives was be bullish ether in that time frame. And one thing I mentioned in that show, and I've been reflecting on it in the last day or so, was that I haven't been able to feel that level of contrarian since because it was easy to be contrarian at $100 ether. It's 20 times less hard to do it at $2,000 ether. But reflecting on the current state of the world right now, gary Genzler and the SEC john Oliver just like public opinion about crypto and NFTs, everyone's like crypto. Paula hapitia crypto is dead.
01:28:12.550 - 01:28:35.954, Speaker B: NFTs are scams. We don't need crypto. Upon reflection, it actually is once again, very contrarian right now and makes it feel very safe, because we know crypto is not going anywhere. They don't even understand how AI is going to come force their hand and make them use crypto. They don't even know that we know that.
01:28:36.152 - 01:28:49.778, Speaker A: That's why we're here. That's what we're doing. I agree it doesn't feel quite as contrarian, but it's still like the age old trope. But we're still early. Can I say that without sounding cliche and dumb? Right? It's still actually true. We're still early.
01:28:49.864 - 01:28:50.606, Speaker B: Super early.
01:28:50.728 - 01:29:04.202, Speaker A: Guys, to prove that we have a meme of the week combination moment of zen for you. The normies won't understand this. David balenciaga. If balenciaga met crypto, that's what you're about to see. It's super weird, but I hope you stick around.
01:29:04.256 - 01:29:05.210, Speaker B: Super weird.
01:29:05.950 - 01:29:06.426, Speaker A: I'll do.
01:29:06.448 - 01:29:08.300, Speaker B: The risk won't get it.
01:29:09.950 - 01:29:18.666, Speaker A: Risk and disclaimers. Of course. Crypto is risky. You could lose what you put in. But we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey.
01:29:18.666 - 01:29:23.630, Speaker A: Thanks a lot. There is only crypto and fashion, and fashion is balenciaga.
01:29:41.130 - 01:29:44.230, Speaker B: If you're not wearing balenciaga, you will get liquidated.
01:30:01.890 - 01:30:05.610, Speaker A: Crypto is risky, but we're headed west dressed in balenciaga.
