00:00:14.190 - 00:00:57.694, Speaker A: Hey, bankless nation, we are super excited to host this live debate. This is a debate on terra Luna, UST, the stablecoin, the bull versus bear case. I asked this question on Twitter, David, and I think this is the question for our debaters today. Is Terra the UST the future of crypto money, or is it a ticking time bomb waiting to explode? Got a lot of responses on crypto Twitter as a result of that question. And then two debaters stepped up to the plate and were also nominated by the community to take one of two respective sides. One is the bull case for UST and the Luna ecosystem, the terra ecosystem. The other is the bear case.
00:00:57.694 - 00:01:10.770, Speaker A: And so we have two representatives taking that side, and we're going to try to get to, I guess, the truth, or at least hear the arguments from both sides in this conversation. David, who do we have on the show today, and do you have anything to add to that?
00:01:10.840 - 00:01:54.642, Speaker B: Yeah, of course. Coming in. In the left side of the ring on the bull case, we have Jose Mercado from Delphi Digital. And then in the right side of the ring, we have Jordy Alexander, chief investment officer of Salini Capital for the bear case for Terra USD. And I think really this conversation hinges on the question of do algorithmic stablecoins, can they work at all? And if they can work, has Terra USD, has UST cracked that nut? We've seen many algo stablecoins come and go. Lots of algorithmic stablecoin experiments on Ethereum, emptyset dollar, dynamic set dollar. But we have not tried the experiment as a layer one until terra came along.
00:01:54.642 - 00:02:24.346, Speaker B: And so far that's been going pretty well with terra. But there's still a fundamental question as can an algorithmic stablecoin work in the long term? And I think that's going to be the main topic of what we are going to talk about today, along with all these other periphery topics as well, such as how is anchor involved with this, the 10 billion of bitcoin treasury that's being accumulated by the Luna guard Foundation, and a few other things as well. So, Ryan, these are the focus of.
00:02:24.368 - 00:02:57.606, Speaker A: Today'S show, and here's why this is important. Guys like Luna is valued at something like $30 billion plus or minus, I'm not sure. At the time of recording, UST is now $16 billion. It's definitely making its way into all corners of DFI. And so this is a substantial market cap for these assets. So we want to poke and see what's the viability look like for these assets. What do the growth prospects look like guys, before we get in, a quick announcement for you, want to tell you a little bit about a fantastic NFT drop opportunity.
00:02:57.606 - 00:03:30.798, Speaker A: And I think this is an opportunity for maybe first time NFT buyers or early buyers who want to support a good cause. So it is National Youth HIV and AIDS Awareness Day on April 10, and the consensus NFT team, and also Mac. That's Mac. The makeup company, have partnered together to launch a set of NFTs from the iconic Keith herring. Art by Keith Herring. There are three different levels you can get in on this NFT. The first starts at $25.
00:03:30.798 - 00:04:01.834, Speaker A: So all of the proceeds from this, here's the cool part. All of the proceeds, 100%, go to HIV AIDS issues involving youth to support youth who are affected by HIV and AIDS. So really cool cause. And not only 100% of the sales, but also all of the resale value. So remember the cool thing about nfTs, every time you sell an NFT, a royalty can be collected. In this case, it's two and a half percent that also, on an ongoing basis, forever goes to the same cause. So super cool opportunity.
00:04:01.834 - 00:04:30.914, Speaker A: We will include a link in the show notes, but if you want to memorize this, it's bankless. CC slash Mac. That's all capital, Mac. And you can check this out. The next step is really just sign up, get on their list, so that when these NFTs come out, you will be first to know. David, with that man. I'm really excited about this panel because I feel like I haven't fully explored the terra and Luna and UST ecosystem in the way I've wanted to.
00:04:30.914 - 00:04:53.994, Speaker A: And I've been looking for an opportunity to sort of get both sides of the argument. So I'm excited to learn along with the guests. I probably have know, preconceived notions coming into this, and I want to check those and see if they're true or not. But this is a very important conversation, probably one of the most important conversations happening in crypto right now. So super excited about this. You have anything else to add?
00:04:54.032 - 00:05:14.960, Speaker B: Yeah, it's extremely relevant. It's the talk of the town. The terra community is full of energy at the moment. And so I think, Ryan, if we can do this show right, it will both be a zero to 60 in understanding the Luna ecosystem while also having a good back and forth debate as to the merits of the system as well as the risks of the system as well.
00:05:15.410 - 00:05:23.890, Speaker A: Well, there's your hype, guys. We will be right back with our two debaters. Our two panelists but before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:05:24.040 - 00:06:09.570, Speaker B: Arbitrum is an Ethereum L2 scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use DFI and nfTs. Over 300 projects have already deployed to arbitrum, and the DFI and NFT ecosystems are growing rapidly. Some of the coolest and newest NFT collections have chosen arbitrum as their home. All the while, DFI protocols continue to see increased usage and liquidity. Using arbitrum has never been easier, especially with the ability to deposit directly into arbitrum through all the exchanges, including binance, FTx, Huobi, and crypto.com. Once inside, you'll notice arbitrum increases Ethereum speed by orders of magnitude for a fraction of the cost of the average gas fee. If you're a developer who wants low gas fees and instant transactions for your users, visit Arbitrum IO slash developer to start building your dap on arbitrum if you're a dgen, many of your favorite dapps on Ethereum are already on arbitrum, with many moving over every day.
00:06:09.570 - 00:06:44.234, Speaker B: Go to bridge arbitrum IO now to start bridging over your eth and other tokens in order to experience dfi Nfts in the way it was always meant to be. Fast, cheap, secure and friction free. The L2 era is upon us. Ethereum's L2 ecosystem is growing every day, and we need bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a L2 life. Across is the fastest, cheapest and most secure crosschain bridge with across, you don't have to worry about the long wait times or high fees to get your assets to the chain of your choice. Assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously. Across bridges are powered by UMA's optimistic oracle.
00:06:44.234 - 00:07:34.650, Speaker B: To securely transfer tokens from L2 back to Ethereum, a token proposal is being deliberated as we speak in the across forum, where community members will decide on the token distribution. You can have your part of across the story by joining the discord and becoming a co founder and helping to design the fair fair launch of a cross if you want to bridge your assets quickly and securely, go to accrop to to bridge your assets between Ethereum optimism, arbitrum or Boba networks, Makerdao is the OG Defi protocol. The Makerdao produces Dai, the industry's most battle tested and resilient stablecoin using maker. You don't need to sell your collateral if you need liquidity. Instead, you can spin up a maker vault and use your collateral to mint Dai directly. With Maker, the power to mint new money is in your hands. The maker protocol is extremely hardened and operated by one of the most experienced daos in existence.
00:07:34.650 - 00:08:01.590, Speaker B: They've been here since the beginning. They've seen it all. And so you can mint Dai with the assurance that your collateral is safe. Soon, Maker will be present on all chains and l two s. So minting dai can take place on Oasis app, Xerion, Zapper, or any other d five protocol that you use. Follow Maker on Twitter at makerdao and learn from the oldest and most resilient dow in existence. All right, ladies and gentlemen of the bankless nation, here are our two panelists again.
00:08:01.590 - 00:08:23.710, Speaker B: In the left side of your screen, we have Jose Mesito coming in from Delphi Digital. He is going to be arguing the bull case for Terra Luna. And then on the right side of the ring, we have Jordy Alexander from Salini Capital arguing for the bear case for the terra ecosystem. And for UST, Jose and Jordy, welcome to Bankless.
00:08:24.850 - 00:08:27.360, Speaker C: Thanks very much for having me. Big fan of the show.
00:08:27.890 - 00:08:29.262, Speaker D: Hey, guys, happy to be here.
00:08:29.316 - 00:08:29.690, Speaker C: Cheers.
00:08:29.770 - 00:09:08.922, Speaker B: Thank you guys for volunteering to do this. I think this is going to be pretty fun. And like I said, going into this, I think this will be an opportunity to go to teach a lot of the bankless listeners, the bankless community, who haven't completely dove in to the Luna ecosystem, all about Luna, while also providing the pros and cons, the benefits and the costs, the bull and the bear case for Terra. And so I'd actually kind of like to start at that high level of just kind of defining what we're actually talking about. And so, Jose, I'd like to start with you. Can you simply just explain the fundamental properties of Luna and is what is the design philosophy and what are its goals and how does it achieve those goals, for sure?
00:09:08.976 - 00:09:52.250, Speaker C: Yeah, I know it's an educated audience, probably more steeped in sort of ethereum projects than terra. So I'll try and use some metaphors there. So I think the easiest way to understand Terra is actually through its product, which is UsT. Right? So UST is a decentralized stablecoin. You can think of it as something similar to Dai, but unlike Dai, which is built on top of Ethereum, UST exists on its own layer, one, which is terra, which is a tendermint proof of stake app chain. So for the ETH Maxis, or for people who understand ETh, you can say it's as if maker MKR token didn't exist, right. So it's like just ETH and Dai, and you have no MKR in the middle.
00:09:52.250 - 00:10:49.946, Speaker C: So all the value would accrue to ETH, and you'd have like Dai sort of built into the layer, one level into the ETH layer. So how does Ust itself work? So in terms of mechanism design, it's actually different from maker. Right. So maker is a debt based stablecoin. UST is more similar to an algorithmic stablecoin that has existed on Ethereum before. You mentioned some of them, ESD, DSD, et cetera, where basically the way you mint UST is by burning Luna, and the way you burn UST is by minting Luna. And so this gives Luna a really interesting role in the terra ecosystem, right, where it's both the staking token, like it would be for a proof of stake chain, but it's also the share token and the governance token for this decentralized stablecoin, right? And so in a sense, it secures both the system's technical sort of consensus risk, but also the stablecoin's financial and economic risk.
00:10:49.946 - 00:11:28.342, Speaker C: This also gives Luna unrivaled value capture, I would say, at layer one, right, because unlike most layer ones, which just capture value from transaction fees, Luna actually captures value in the growth of its main stablecoin. And since stablecoins are crypto's killer app on pretty much every chain, Luna basically verticalizes. It's vertically integrated, and it also captures the value from its main and most successful application. And then in terms of contextual data that might be useful to your users, to your listeners. Sorry. UST is the biggest decentralized stablecoin by market cap. It's at roughly 16 bill, right now.
00:11:28.342 - 00:12:00.446, Speaker C: It's also probably about to be the most liquid with the four pool. Maybe controversial, but yeah, it's probably about to be the most liquid. I would also argue, and I'll argue later, that it's the most decentralized in a certain sense. And then Luna has its own layer one ecosystem, which itself is thriving in the sense that it has around 30 billion in TVL. It's the second largest l one by TVL. It has core primitives for a lot of the stuff that you'd see on Ethereum savings, credit exchange, perps, also an NFT. Like a bunch of NFT marketplaces, a bunch of dope NFTs.
00:12:00.446 - 00:12:05.906, Speaker C: So, yeah, I'd say like a high level intro to terra.
00:12:06.018 - 00:12:38.618, Speaker A: So, Jose, I'm going to ask Jordy to add to that but just to kind of summarize, taking from maybe the Ethereum paradigm, right? So it's as if a layer one like Ethereum, that's what terra essentially is, had an algorithmic stablecoin almost baked in, tightly coupled to its core protocol. And the value of that algorithmic stablecoin was somewhat sort of linked to, in an algorithmic way, eth the asset. So the l one asset itself, it's.
00:12:38.634 - 00:12:46.722, Speaker C: Like if the seniority accrued to ETH, right? Imagine if the growth in Dai all accrued to ETH, or in the centralized stables all accrued to ETH, right?
00:12:46.776 - 00:13:13.526, Speaker A: And that is not the only UST, of course, is not the only application on Terra. Terra also has general purpose, smart contract layer, where it has other sort of defi applications as well. But it does have this special status, almost protocol native. I don't know if that's too strong a term. Would you say protocol native, or do you still consider ust a separate app that is distinct from the protocol?
00:13:13.638 - 00:13:22.634, Speaker C: No, it's protocol native for sure. So it's minted and burnt at the protocol level. And Luna and UST are both the two protocol native tokens.
00:13:22.682 - 00:13:54.390, Speaker A: So that is helpful because we can't really talk about UST without talking about Luna. So I think for listeners listening to this, when we say Luna and know sometimes we'll use them somewhat interchangeably. But of course, UST is sort of the stablecoin pegged aspect, but it is almost a product of Luna. And these two things might be used somewhat interchangeably in this episode. Jordy, what would you add to this? Is there anything you would add to Jose's description or anything you might disagree.
00:13:56.010 - 00:15:04.954, Speaker D: Mean in terms of the analogy to maker and some of the stablecoins that people might be familiar with, like die, for example, that are over collateralized. The difference is that in a way, UST is collateralized by the value of the underlying chain itself, by the l one. But instead of a model where you are necessarily changing your ust for Luna, instead it is adding inflation to the system. So imagine if somebody wanted to get rid of their dai instead of getting Ethereum from somebody, the system would literally just print new ethereums and just kind of bestow those ethereums onto the person that has dai. So in a way, like the dai is an extension of Ethereum, where you could just get more ethereum created from that system. Of course, the problem we know with inflation is that it reduces the price, and that's kind of why historically these things have always failed, because as you create inflation, you reduce the price, you get into a death spiral where the underlying price is going down, and then people want to redeem more. And then there's like a rush for the exit.
00:15:04.954 - 00:15:15.206, Speaker D: And if you find that there is not enough exit for everybody, some people are kind of left holding the bag, and usually things go to zero in that case. That's kind of what we've seen historically.
00:15:15.258 - 00:15:56.960, Speaker B: At least, I think, to bolster this conversation. And, Jordy, you just touched on it a little bit, and jose also touched on it. But I want to make this a little bit more formal. There's a relationship between the value capture of the terra ecosystem and then the Luna token, and then also the UST token. And I want to kind of go back through this again. Jose, when the terra ecosystem captures value, how does it manifest in the supply of UST versus the unit price of Luna? As in, like the market cap of Luna versus the total supply of outstanding UST. When the terra ecosystem grows and captures value, how does it get balanced between these two tokens? How does that happen?
00:15:57.650 - 00:16:39.334, Speaker C: Yeah, so when there's demand for excess demand for UST, UST will trade above a dollar. Right. And at that point, there's an incentive for someone to go and burn some Luna in order to mint UST and then sell it on the market and collect the arbitrage. Right. With Luna providing kind of that layer one oracle price that sets how you can mint and burn UST. And so as the supply of UST grows, there's more demand for Luna to burn it to mint to capture these arbitrage opportunities. And then obviously, Luna also captures a staking yield, which comes from the fees generated on the network, the swap fees, and the ActUal just transaction fees on the network.
00:16:39.334 - 00:16:46.110, Speaker C: There's ACTUALLy Luna's staking yield, which is pretty high. It's not inflation based at all. It all comes from network fees.
00:16:46.530 - 00:16:56.610, Speaker B: And then, Jordy, with this mechanism, what are the strengths and weaknesses in this particular mechanism that stand out to you, or just any comment on that mechanism and its sustainability?
00:16:57.590 - 00:17:34.238, Speaker D: The problem with. So you don't really see there's a problem until there's like a huge problem. That's one big issue where there's going to be a straw that's going to break the camel's back at some point where you can keep backing, you keep backing, keep backing, and then there's a point where you just suddenly nosedive. So it's not like you get to slowly notice that something's wrong and you get to adjust and fix it. So that's one of the issues that these things historically have. It looks everything's okay, and then suddenly it goes bad. And the problem is, if you have a lot of retail users and you have a few big whales, we'll get into this later.
00:17:34.324 - 00:17:34.960, Speaker C: But.
00:17:38.370 - 00:17:49.566, Speaker D: If there's a rush for the exit and you have a few very sophisticated players that own most of the coins and they get out first, then it's kind of bad luck for the people holding.
00:17:49.678 - 00:17:50.340, Speaker A: Well.
00:17:52.070 - 00:18:50.690, Speaker C: The only thing I would add to that, just on the historical metaphor that I think is important to note, is, while I do think historical is important, the comparison and the idea that it was all okay at a certain point with ESD or DSD or whatever is just like, it's not true, right. For anyone that was in those games, that thing traded at every price except a dollar. It was at $10 YESD at some point, or like $5. And then obviously it went straight down all the way to whatever it is now, like fractions of a cent. So I don't think there's been any really algorithmic stablecoin that has anywhere near the track record of success of what UST has had. Right. And the comparison, in a sense, is a little bit disingenuous, because Titan, ESD, DSD, they really never maintained stability for more than even a few weeks, whereas UST has maintained stability for over like a year and faced some pretty serious and testing market conditions.
00:18:50.690 - 00:18:58.418, Speaker C: So I think the metaphors, while they're important and the design is similar, the magnitude of success is just on a completely different scale, where it's almost incomparable.
00:18:58.514 - 00:19:51.738, Speaker A: I feel like we're already diving into some of the debate topics that we definitely want to reach. But while we're talking still about the intro and the summary to make sure the audience understands UST and Luna is the last important piece. If you're coming from an Ethereum world, that's different. As I understand things, Jordy and Jose, that Luna does not have a fixed supply, the same way it does not have a monetary schedule in the way that bitcoin is 21 million. And Ethereum is sort of basically based on parameter controls and validating those sort of things, Luna will actually inflate its supply in order to stabilize or respond to USt as a stablecoin, the demand for UST as a stablecoin. So that is one big distinction from the Ethereum ecosystem, the Luna ecosystem, the terra ecosystem. So I see you nodding your head yes.
00:19:51.738 - 00:20:20.500, Speaker A: So I think that's the case. Okay, so let's just high level. Before we get into some of these individual topics, I want to hear your high level summary from each of you on Jose, why you are bullish, and then Jordy, why you are bearish. And I think you've both hinted at some of these things, but just put it into kind of the elevator pitch for us. We'll start with you, Jose. Why are you bullish on this design?
00:20:21.350 - 00:21:08.098, Speaker C: Yep. So I actually think Jordy and I probably are closer in views on this than I would be with most other bears, but I want to do just a few disclaimers before doing on the bullishness. So I'm very bullish Luna, in that most of my net worth is in Luna and Luna alts, right? So that should tell you something about sort of my bullishness on Luna. However, that doesn't mean I think it's riskless. I've consistently sort of outlined what I think are the risks with it and also the mitigants to those risks. It also doesn't mean I'm a really like as Delphi Ventures, we've invested most of our investments and most of our nav is held in non lunar ecosystem stuff. We've invested in other layer ones.
00:21:08.098 - 00:21:40.510, Speaker C: We're interested in other stable coins, like Frax and Faye specifically are designed that I'm interested in. So by no means a then. Okay, so in terms of the high level thesis for Luna, so maybe I'll do the high level and just go through step by step afterwards as well, if that's cool. Maybe cut me off, if not. So high level stablecoins are crypto's killer app. I think this is hard to deny. Centralized stablecoins are, in my mind, a temporary stop gap that will be regulated away into irrelevance.
00:21:40.510 - 00:22:27.430, Speaker C: The end game is necessarily decentralized stablecoins, which I think is arguably the biggest market in crypto. I think it's a multi trillion dollar opportunity. UST is the largest decentralized stablecoin by market cap, and it's also growing the fastest. Like the second Dai is actually not growing, it's declining, although decentralization is hard to quantify, as I said, I'll also argue that it's the most decentralized because it's the only one that doesn't rely on centralized, sensible collateral like USDC and tether. So that's sort of the high level thesis. I can go in step by step into each of those points and add a bit more color to them if you want now. Or I can let Jordy do his elevator.
00:22:27.590 - 00:22:35.840, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I think that's perfect for now. That's the perfect level of expression of the bullcase that we need for now. Jordy, what's your bear case?
00:22:36.370 - 00:22:57.606, Speaker D: Yeah, I'll do like a very quick disclaimer as well. I don't want Luna to fail. I'm not betting against Luna. I'm not short Luna. But I do see a lot of potential issues in the road. And compared to the current euphoria around the Luna price that we've seen, I think there's a lot of things that people may need to understand and make.
00:22:57.708 - 00:22:59.810, Speaker A: Jordy, are you a Luna holder?
00:22:59.970 - 00:23:06.294, Speaker D: I'm not a Luna holder. Sorry. I have no Luna, long or short. Got it.
00:23:06.332 - 00:23:07.160, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:23:08.570 - 00:23:46.234, Speaker D: I am in anchor right now. I think we'll get into anchor later. Presenting the beer case while being in anchor are not two distinct things, I'll explain that. I think anchor is like a huge marketing spend right now. That is a safe thing for investors potentially to just say thank you and take some 20% yield while there is a lot of reserves, and we'll get into that later. But in terms of the bear case, there are huge amount of assumptions between here and the end game that Jose talks about. And I understand the endgame, and I'm sympathetic to the endgame.
00:23:46.234 - 00:24:30.610, Speaker D: The end game is basically we want something decentralized as opposed to USDC USDT, where the government can intervene. The problem with something over collateralized is that it is very capital inefficient and cannot grow very fast. While UST, as we have been talking about, has been growing extremely rapidly, that also presents risks with it because you can get over your skis, grow too fast, and been in an imbalanced situation. But the main bear case is how far we are from here into execution are many, many steps removed than people realize. There's a lot of things that have to go right, and there's a lot of assumptions that we don't know. And there's two main ones. One is, will this peg hold in the meantime, through volatility.
00:24:30.610 - 00:25:26.130, Speaker D: And volatility can come either through a bear market or it can come through a reduction in demand once the yield on anchor, which I believe is extremely crucial to the growth of terra right now, reduces. And actually, the reality is nobody knows what the effect of that is going to be. And another assumption is, even if it doesn't deep. That's not the only bare case. It is entirely possible that as we have seen with Uniswap, as we have seen with other successful protocols in DFI, like Ave if something works, people will try to make a better mousetrap. And you might see other l ones issue stable coins against them and add some little tweak on it on top and they can offer a higher yield. This is kind of what we've seen with sushiswap, and that will be bearish for Luna price without necessarily de pegging the coin.
00:25:27.750 - 00:25:54.782, Speaker B: Okay, guys, thank you for those initial statements. And I think we're going to be touching on basically every single element that was discussed by each of you. And this first one, to really start off the detailed side of this show, I want to go back to Jose. Jose, you talked a lot about how these other algo stablecoins just have not performed in the same way that UST has. And Ust is in a league of its own simply by performance. Right. We had empty set dollar come and not really work.
00:25:54.782 - 00:26:19.160, Speaker B: Dynamic set dollar come and not really work. For what reasons do you ascribe the success of UST in the face of all the other algo stablecoins that haven't worked? Like what are the properties, what are the features of Terra and UST that has made UsT hold its peg and be so? And what are those elements? What would you say is the rationale behind that?
00:26:20.090 - 00:27:11.910, Speaker C: Yeah, I'd say the main thing is just that most people treated algostables as a mechanism problem design, where actually it's a utility and demand problem, right? So everyone sees these things as just, you design a mechanism, you design a coupon system, a bond, whatever might be, then you just alter that over time and hopefully it can maintain the peg. But actually, the main thing that backs a stablecoin is demand for it. Right. That's the main backer coin, stable stablecoin, to take this sort of build it, and they will come approach or like peg it and will come approach. Right. As long as we keep the system safe and pegged, people will use this. And what we've seen is that that just hasn't really worked.
00:27:11.910 - 00:27:17.254, Speaker C: Right. And the approach that UST took, sorry, it says my connection is stable. Can you hear me all right?
00:27:17.292 - 00:27:25.580, Speaker B: Yeah, we can kind of hear you. You're breaking up here and there. It actually might be beneficial if we actually just started from the beginning. Can you just start over?
00:27:25.950 - 00:28:20.906, Speaker C: Yeah, sorry about that. So I think the big difference is that most algo stables and stablecoins generally treat stablecoins as a mechanism design problem, where in reality it's a demand problem. Right? So you can construct the most elegant mechanism you want, but the main thing that backs a stablecoin is demand for it. And so where everyone else kind of focused on their coupon mechanism or building an economy around it, for example, the maker approach, which is sort of build it and they will come. Or we've seen the struggles of that. Whereas UST, the approach was, let's not just build a stablecoin with a clever mechanism. Let's build an entire economy of use cases around this centered around UST, which creates that demand around it.
00:28:20.906 - 00:28:53.762, Speaker C: And obviously, the first one was mirror, which allowed people to get exposure to synthetic assets. And I mean, at a high level, I would split sort of, because UST is money, right? And money, you want to use it for two main things, either spending or deferred spending, right? Which would be like investment. So deferred spending is sort of all of defi and TFi, like all these tools. So mirror, which gives you exposure to traditional assets, synthetic assets. You have anchor, which gives you a savings rate. You have astroport, where you can exchange it for different assets. You have Mars protocol as a credit protocol.
00:28:53.762 - 00:29:39.426, Speaker C: You have Prism, where you can split your yield. All these primitives that make this investment ecosystem really compelling, and that's only going to keep growing. And then you have the spending use case, which is, how can I actually spend my ust in the real world, right? Because I don't want to have this savings account that's separate from my spending account. And there you have all these neo banks come online, like cato, like cash, like Alice, that are building all over the world, and sort of doing the work on the front lines, on the regulatory front lines to make UsT spendable everywhere. And the ultimate vision is to sort of close the loop where you never have to leave this ecosystem. You have a really well developed financial system with TFI. And then you also have a really well developed spending ecosystem where you can spend this stuff all over the world and sort of make that really seamless.
00:29:39.426 - 00:30:06.590, Speaker C: And I think that vision is the big difference between UST and all the other stablecoins. And we're seeing some of them understand this. So, for instance, the FEI and Rari merger, I think, is an admission of this, right, that it's difficult to have just a stable coin. You need to verticalize and have your use cases on top of it. And so you've seen, like join up with Rari and build these use cases on top. You've seen fracs with fracs lending. And I think the most successful ones are the ones that are able to do that.
00:30:06.590 - 00:30:18.740, Speaker C: But I don't think with the lead USD has in terms of the system and just the community and everything, I think it's much better positioned than most of the others.
00:30:19.270 - 00:31:10.020, Speaker B: I want to throw this to Jordy in a second, but one quick follow up, Jose, on this. I think your argument to summarize it, is that the vanilla algorithmic stablecoin model, I think you are in agreement that without utility, algo stablecoins don't work. You can't just have an algo stablecoin just to have a stablecoin. You need to actually imbue it with utility for it actually to be sustainable. But my question to you is, are we just adding a utility layer around an unstable foundation? Like, if we know that algo stablecoins are inherently unstable, can you really solve that by adding just a utility layer around it? Because in my mind, I think an argument could be made about how you're just obfuscating the instability, and the instability will rear its head at one day. You've just obfuscated with utility between now and then. What would you say to that?
00:31:10.950 - 00:31:59.666, Speaker C: I would say that it's not that algo stables are inherently unstable, it's just that most of them focused on Ponzi incentives versus utility. And what that does is it's really good at bootstrapping the supply of this algo stable. With ESD and the expansions, you were getting massive growth in ESD supply, but actually, there's no real demand sustaining that. And when the market turns, the outstanding stablecoins are actually a liability of the share token, right? The share token has to honor that and gets minted in order to satisfy that. And so you have this situation where you've created loads of stablecoins through Ponzi demand and yield, and when that goes, everyone wants to redeem at the same time. Right? Which is why it's really important for an algo stable. You have to build demand at the same time as you build this holder base, because you need it to be that.
00:31:59.666 - 00:32:24.746, Speaker C: When sort of markets turn and people aren't collecting their 10% senorige a day or whatever on ESD, there needs to be people that are actually using ESD, and so they're not redeeming it because they actually see utility in it, and they're using it to do all this stuff. And so it's not that they're inherently unstable, it's just that they got ahead of their skis because they used Ponzi incentives to grow supply loads without having the utility to actually back that up in the contraction phase. Awesome.
00:32:24.848 - 00:32:29.820, Speaker B: That's a fantastic illustration. Jordy, what would you say to that? What are the thoughts that have risen to your.
00:32:31.790 - 00:33:00.100, Speaker D: Know, first of all, in terms of the Ponzi nomics, I would say that giving an unsustainable yield like anchor is doing is a little bit like that. I understand why it is, and it's a marketing spend where you say, okay, if it's $15 billion and we're paying 10% above market, we're spending a billion and a half dollars. But if we're creating so much market cap, then it's sort of okay, and it's a worthwhile investment, and there's a lot of assumptions baked into that.
00:33:00.570 - 00:33:20.262, Speaker A: Jordy, can you take a minute just to explain what you're talking about with anchor? So this is some way to elicit demand for UST, as I understand it, through yield, which maybe goes back to what is a Ponzi incentive. But you're saying it exists in anchor. Could you explain that for the listeners?
00:33:20.406 - 00:33:58.598, Speaker D: Yeah, I think let's take a quick step back and tell the listeners what is on terra, because it's been around a while. It's not like it's just got created. Now, even though the price has been going up recently, there were some fundamental building blocks that the Terra team built into the system. One was chai, which was a payment system. The idea was, if you integrate the stablecoins into real world spending, that will be a link towards long term sustainability, because there's people actually spending it. It was a great idea. There's been a lot of issues with that, and I think the chai experiment was fantastic.
00:33:58.598 - 00:34:53.510, Speaker D: Regulation and other things in Korea, I don't think know UST is being spent for purchases. So let's call that kind of like a good idea that didn't necessarily follow through. Then we had mirror protocol, which was a synthetics competitor in terms of synthetic assets, stocks, bonds, creating these financial instruments on chain to give access to people around the world, also not something that's been extremely successful. We at Selena Capital have been in mirror for a very long time, and we like the protocol. But the reality is both on the regulatory side, as we saw with the SEC kind of complaints about it, and even on the stability side now, it was doing very well and been doing less well. And the assets there are not necessarily very stable right now. So another very good idea that has had problems executing.
00:34:53.510 - 00:35:18.930, Speaker D: So what is the killer app? It is anchor. Anchor is your savings bank. Instead of getting 0.1% at Wells Fargo, you get 20%. That is something simple enough and desirable enough that it has created this huge surge in UST. And it is especially the case now that we're out of DFI. Summer, we're out of the initial DFI explosion where 20% yield was nothing.
00:35:19.000 - 00:35:19.234, Speaker C: Right?
00:35:19.272 - 00:35:58.880, Speaker D: Like you had very easy 8100 percent yields. Like nobody cared about it and nobody was looking at anchor. But since then, we've had a huge contraction in yields, as the new protocols have figured out that maybe you shouldn't necessarily just give out all your tokens in the first week to predatory people who are just going to take them and leave. So that's reduced the risk free yield in DFI in general. And if you call it 10% now, the anchor is actually higher now, and they haven't reduced it because they realize what's going on. Suddenly everybody wants to come to anchor now because it's 20. So we should not reduce it.
00:35:59.490 - 00:36:10.820, Speaker A: Jordan, what do you mean by they haven't reduced it? Who's in charge of reducing it or increasing it? And also, where does the 20% yield in anchor actually come from?
00:36:12.550 - 00:36:32.700, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm sorry, Jody. Feel free to answer that after this. I think maybe it would be useful to, because I'm happy to talk about anchor, but I think it would be useful to have the context of kind of the death spiral risk and all of that and that argument first. So I don't know how I want to do it, because.
00:36:35.390 - 00:37:05.720, Speaker A: I think we'll get there for sure. What I do want to hear from Jordy, though, is you said something, jose, which is that it's based on utility. Like utility value is the big differentiator with USC. And I'm wondering if Jordy is getting to a point where he's saying, well, actually, anchor is similar to some of the Ponzi game type economics that we've seen in empty set dollar. I don't know if that's the point you're making, Jordy, but I'd like to hear kind of your full expression of what you're saying with anchor. So where's the 20% coming from?
00:37:08.090 - 00:37:15.782, Speaker D: I can't say what Doe said to Kyle Simani, but the 20% is.
00:37:15.836 - 00:37:17.820, Speaker C: That was a south park joke, by the way.
00:37:20.830 - 00:38:16.442, Speaker D: So the 20% is coming from the Luna foundation guard. It's coming from, ultimately, the powers that be, that control terra, that have money to spend on marketing. A way to look at it is they're saying, we have this money in the treasury. We will keep topping up as long as we feel like we're getting a worthwhile return on adoption, and we will keep topping up this 20% yield above what maybe 10% is like a normal value for the yield, given some of the natural rewards rates, where you're getting the yield from the assets that are being staked. So it's a very expensive marketing spend. The problem I have with it is twofold. One is the civil resistance is always impossible to solve for.
00:38:16.442 - 00:39:07.274, Speaker D: So, yeah, if you can actually give 20% to retail real people, Alice and Joe, and they actually have a savings account with $20,000, they want to get 20%. And you think it's worthwhile to give them this extra $500 a year because you want to bring them into the ecosystem. That makes a lot of sense. But what you end up happening is DGen box, for example, which is like a way to wrap mim and UST together and kind of magnify the yield and kind of keep farming this extra yield. That's kind of more the type of people that have taken advantage of the offer. So I don't think it's necessarily been super effective in terms of bringing in retail people, and it's so hard to do. This is the problem with crypto in general and with blockchain in general.
00:39:07.274 - 00:39:18.830, Speaker D: It's like, how do you just direct the rewards that you want to direct to real human beings instead of just a huge corporation or some degenbox thing, taking all of the incentives.
00:39:19.570 - 00:39:52.570, Speaker A: Jordy, back to kind of David's root question here, which is, I think Jose was saying, hey, this is different than other algo stablecoin experiments in the past. It's not empty set dollar, it's not basis cash. This is fundamentally different, and so won't end up with the same fate. I mean, we have like a field of gravestones, as David said it pre the show of other algo stablecoins. Do you think that UST is destined to join those? Do you think it will ultimately fall in the same ways, or do you think this time it is different with UST?
00:39:53.870 - 00:40:13.562, Speaker D: I think some people I talk to are completely convinced. I'm not convinced. I think it's sort of 50 50. It hangs in the balance. We have a much better team executing on Luna. Like Do Kwan has an amazing execution spirit to him. You have jump.
00:40:13.562 - 00:40:44.918, Speaker D: You have some strong players that are backing that are not going to just let this thing die. I think last May 2021, where we had a big drop in the entire market and UST started to depeg. There were some powerful friends that came in and saved the day, and it didn't you know, one year later, those guys are kind of reaping the rewards. So it's much stronger than some of these prior experiments. And I'm not sure it's going to Depeg. But there are risks. There's two risks.
00:40:44.918 - 00:41:40.954, Speaker D: One is Luna price goes down because the entire market is going down. People start worrying that there is not enough collateral in Luna to absorb all the UST. So if the entire market goes down 50, 60% in a bear market, including bitcoin, which is kind of the collateral that is now being accumulated, which we'll get it, we haven't touched upon, but God forbid the entire crypto market goes into like a really bad bear market, there's going to be a loss of trust in UsT because people are worried that there is not enough collateral to back it in terms of actual dollars. The collateralization percentage goes down and there's a rush for the doors. That's the one risk. And then the second risk comes from the other side. It comes from the dollar side, where if the 20% on anchor gets reduced to 10% and then people no longer care about it, then you will see, like we talked about before, they will burn UsT that will mint more Luna.
00:41:40.954 - 00:42:25.546, Speaker D: It will create inflation in Luna. And that's kind of a potential risk that starts to create the basis of a death spiral where if Luna market cap is 30 billion and somebody burns 5 billion of UST, it's not just that Luna is going to go down by 5 billion to 25 billion. There is a multiplier effect. So it'll be like times three to times eight are kind of like the estimates historically on the effect of market cap like we've seen now in bitcoin. Bitcoin has gone up 10% based on a few billion of buying. It's not proportional to the market cap. So that's kind of like the hammer that falls down and 5 billion of Luna sales just wipes out the entire thing.
00:42:25.728 - 00:43:07.500, Speaker B: Right. Jose, I'm about to throw this to you, but just so I think to recap that is, Jordy, I think what you're saying is that if you compare the outstanding supply of UST to the market cap of Luna, you're saying that there's no way that the Luna has enough ammo, right. That doesn't have enough capital to fully prevent a death spiral. Jose, you were about to kind of illustrate, I think, the case for a desk spiral. And can you also just illustrate how anchor you think fits into that role? Does the utility that anchor providing to UST is that helping Ust maintain its peg, or do you also see a risk with anchor? And can you just illustrate some of your thoughts here on this?
00:43:08.110 - 00:43:44.130, Speaker C: Yeah. So the first thing is the 20% rate right now is unsustainable. Right. The yield reserve is depleting, but simulations that have been done, and we can link to a few in the show notes, show that a sustainable rate would be anywhere from 7% to 12%, which is still much higher than anything else available in DFI. So the question is, how much do you need to pay for people to accept the perceived peg risk of UST? Right. And the number that the ecosystem landed on to start with was this 20%, which is a really strong meme. And it's like the number where people are like.
00:43:44.130 - 00:44:29.730, Speaker C: And even Jordy, right, who's a bear. The yield is high enough to compensate for him having some Ust in there. So the question is, at what point? And now a proposal is passed to make the rate more dynamic, so it's going to adjust every month, and so that the yield is going to lower. And so the question is, what is the rate at which people start saying, this isn't worth the risk anymore? And for me, that would be, like, below 10%. That's my sort of estimate there, because I think anchor is still going to be the highest rate in d five for the foreseeable future. And I think with its model, probably forever in terms of the combination of stability and high yield, I think anchor will continue to be that. And then the other thing to say is it's unsustainable.
00:44:29.730 - 00:44:54.054, Speaker C: Just like PayPal giving away $20 to everyone that used PayPal initially was unsustainable. Right. Like Jordy said, it's marketing spend. And I totally disagree with the idea that it's been not that successful, that the goal was to attract retail. In my mind, it's been massively successful because it's grown UST supply to 16 billion. It's increased UST liquidity. And I don't necessarily buy this thing that we need to attract retail.
00:44:54.054 - 00:45:16.606, Speaker C: Or like, this is sort of a separate argument. I think Jordy is the user now. Jordy is using UST, and so are a bunch of other big funds in the space. They have exposure to UST. And you have this magic thing that happens where when the capital went into anchor, that's when people saw Ust as most risky because it was completely uncollateralized. And so they needed that 20%. But now there's a bitcoin reserve.
00:45:16.606 - 00:45:47.114, Speaker C: Right? And what if by the time and Doe can fund this yield reserve for a long time. And so what if by the time the yield reserve, the yield comes down, the UST is like 80% backed by reserves, right? Then suddenly you have this magic trick where people came in because they wanted the high yield, the really high yield, and they needed that high yield to compensate them for the risk. But now there's a magic trick that happens and you're like, well, I kind of trust this thing now. It's been around for a while. The four pool is the most liquid pool in DFI. This thing has all the trading pairs. There's exchanges on L2, like zigzag, that are using this.
00:45:47.114 - 00:46:17.222, Speaker C: Actually, I want to keep my UST, and so it's achieved exactly what it set out to do. Right. And for me, it's the most no brainer marketing spend ever. Like, if you can spend 500 million to top up a reserve and get 16 or like 10 billion in additional UST and get everyone using it and talking about it, and then you can collateralize it in the meanwhile and increase the trust in it, I just think it's like just a genius move in my mind. And so those are sort of my thoughts on the anchor sustainability piece, you.
00:46:17.276 - 00:46:27.910, Speaker B: Indicated something like a 10% real rate, real yield coming from people that are actually paying into anchor. And then it goes up to 20% when you add in the rewards.
00:46:27.990 - 00:46:28.186, Speaker C: Right.
00:46:28.208 - 00:46:30.860, Speaker B: It's basically like a yield farming incentive program.
00:46:31.950 - 00:46:57.650, Speaker C: Not exactly like that. Yeah, it's just that basically the rate that could be sustained because the anchor rate is sort of a liability for the anchor platform. Right. Because they have to generate enough borrowing in order to be able to pay that rate to depositors. Because the depositors, the simulations that have been done is, given current borrowing activity, how much yield could actually anchor, actually pay out. And so anchor is maintaining the 20% rate. Not through any.
00:46:57.650 - 00:47:07.382, Speaker C: It's not like a yield farm. It's just literally, LFG sending some money to the yield reserve, which allows it to keep depleting and paying out that liability of the platform.
00:47:07.516 - 00:47:27.420, Speaker B: Right. And you said that if the fund stopped incentivizing the yields, it would come down to something like seven to 12%, I think you said, yeah, that is so high above the rest of the industry. I think, like USCC is 2%. Where does so much demand to borrow out of anchor come from?
00:47:28.750 - 00:48:02.726, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, it is the best place to borrow most proof of stake layer one assets, right. The model is that you give up your proof of stake yield on your layer one asset, and in exchange you borrow very cheaply and you have the anchor incentives on top. So there is some like this model, like any model of stuff like this has its flaws. For instance, it obviously has to assume anchor price and the incentives that are being paid out to borrowers and stuff like that. And there's some reflexivity all the way through. But yeah, that's how it does it.
00:48:02.908 - 00:48:53.346, Speaker A: I think we're going to talk about maybe the probability of DPEG risk in just a minute because I think, Jose, you sort of underweight that a little bit. You think it's overstated, maybe, and I'm guessing, Jordy, you probably believe the opposite. But I do want to just zone in on this question because you brought it up. Jose, is the fact that LFG, which is a fund associated with Luna in kind of that ecosystem and helping to prop up the value of that economy and specifically ust, there's been recently in crypto news, Doquan purchasing up to $10 billion worth of Luna. And just before this call, I saw an LFG fund purchase, which is kind of an acting.org for Doquan and the terror ecosystem, purchasing 200 million or something. Bitcoin.
00:48:53.346 - 00:49:22.590, Speaker A: Like they're doing this. This is one thing I don't understand personally, which is, is the fact that they're having to buy a foreign asset. This is kind of, to me like a bank reserve or a central bank reserve, maybe going and buying a foreign asset, an off chain asset to Luna, the fact that they're buying bitcoin, is that not an admission that the model isn't sustainable and doesn't work? Tell me about that, Jose, how would you respond?
00:49:22.930 - 00:49:48.230, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't really get that argument. For instance, is the fact that Ethereum is moving to e 2.0 proof of stake, sharding an admission that Ethereum as it currently stands doesn't work? No, Ethereum as it currently stands works. It's just ETH 2.0 is way better. Right? It's a better design. And so Luna, as it existed for its history as a pure algorithmic stable, worked.
00:49:48.230 - 00:50:08.270, Speaker C: It's hard to deny that it worked. It survived contractions, it grew exponentially, it created a lot of use cases around it. But as it gets into this next stage of adoption and trust, that bitcoin reserve backing is super important in order to bootstrap that trust and increase that trust and allow it to scale further.
00:50:08.610 - 00:50:13.890, Speaker A: Jordy, do you want to comment on this before we move to systemic risks and the DPEG risks specifically.
00:50:15.670 - 00:51:08.018, Speaker D: I think it was universally agreed, even by the bears, that using bitcoin as collateral, and not only Luna is the right decision, it was a very smart move. Even if you say it's fairly highly correlated to Luna, it's not going to be one to one correlated. So it is adding potentially some diversification and stability to the system versus having just Luna. It just adds bitcoin risk. And people will always be looking at, if bitcoin goes down, they'll be saying, well, Luna took a $1 billion loss today because they have 8 billion in bitcoin, and it went down 10%. And that could create some fud that you're kind of opening up to. But I think that move in itself was not a bad move.
00:51:08.104 - 00:51:12.946, Speaker A: And, Jordy, that bitcoin itself, that's custody, is it not? Like, where does that bitcoin live?
00:51:13.128 - 00:51:39.854, Speaker D: So this is like when I talked at the very beginning, that we are so far from the vision, which I like the vision, but we are so far from the vision. There are so many things to figure out, even for these super smart people that are trying to figure it out. They're extremely complex. Like, you have bitcoin. Bitcoin is on the bitcoin network. You want to have bitcoin on the lunar network so that it automatically, in a decentralized fashion, will be able to be redeemed at 98% of a UST. And we can explain why it's 98%.
00:51:39.854 - 00:52:02.622, Speaker D: Not one to one. But we've seen all the hacks with bridges. We're going to see what solution ends up being found and if it's Ren BTC or what version of wrapped bitcoin they end up using. But this is an execution risk that, in my mind, is far from being solved and is not without risks.
00:52:02.766 - 00:52:04.014, Speaker A: We've always, like on bankless.
00:52:04.062 - 00:52:05.620, Speaker C: I would agree with that. Yeah.
00:52:06.250 - 00:52:32.640, Speaker A: I'm curious your thoughts, because always on bankless. The show is called bankless, right? But we've always been on the mindsets that the moment the asset starts to have trust assumptions and get custodied is the moment you start to turn into a bank. And I'm wondering, maybe, Jose, like, your take on this is what Terra is creating with UST now, bringing in foreign asset reserves, basically. How is this different than a.
00:52:34.450 - 00:53:17.114, Speaker C: Yeah, so, by the way, I'm a director of LFG, so one of seven directors of LFG, just as a kind of disclosure. And, yeah, I agree, it's an unsolved problem to Jordy's point how to bring bitcoin to Terra in the most trustless way possible. There are solutions out there. There's axilar, I think is an interesting solution that's pretty trustless. There's obviously thorchain, but none of them are ready for multiple billion dollars of bitcoin. And so, at this stage, the bitcoin is custodied by the foundation itself, which is not ideal. And then, in terms of whether bringing in an asset makes it a bank, no, I don't think so.
00:53:17.114 - 00:53:40.530, Speaker C: Because there's already an asset. There's Luna. Right? And that asset is like the native asset of the network. The only thing that it adds is trust assumptions, for sure, in terms of bringing bitcoin over to the network. But I don't think trust assumptions make it a bank. Right? A bank is literally, the bank controls. It's a centralized legal entity that controls these assets.
00:53:40.530 - 00:53:51.400, Speaker C: Depending what solution is chosen, is going to be much more of a decentralized process. And obviously with its own set of additional trust assumptions, that much is inevitable, I'd say.
00:53:51.850 - 00:54:52.022, Speaker B: I want to ask a similar question just from the perspective of the protocol, though. Ryan said that when you use bitcoin to help backstop UsT, you're kind of admitting that you need external help to make the protocol sustainable. And I think this really goes into one of the design philosophy differences between Ethereum and Terra, where Terra seems to be totally okay with tapping into the power and the market cap of bitcoin to help bolster its ecosystem. But in my mind, that is one protocol, the terra, the Luna protocol, saying that we need external help for security for the protocol, and the protocol can't sustain itself. We need to tap into the power of bitcoin in order to make this thing long term sustainable. And I don't think, in my mind, as a layer one protocol, it's a risk. It's a risk to tap into something that you don't have control over in order to help maintain the functioning of your ecosystem.
00:54:52.022 - 00:55:00.430, Speaker B: Like bitcoin can do things that are outside of the control of terra because it's outside of the protocol. Jose, do you see these concerns?
00:55:02.210 - 00:55:41.978, Speaker C: Not really. Because Dai is backed by bitcoin and actually a very weak form of bitcoin. Right. With very weak trust assumptions, which is WBTC, which is basically a bitgo multisig. It's also backed by USDC, which is literally like centralized stablecoins, or an IOU for dollars in a bank account, if the US government calls. It's not. I'm not saying it's going to be a phone call, but there's processes in which those funds could be frozen, USDC's blacklisted addresses before it's very vulnerable, and I would argue a much bigger vulnerability than the bitcoin one.
00:55:41.978 - 00:56:03.466, Speaker C: And I still don't agree with this admission argument. Sorry. Because it's not an admission, it's sort of a growth of the model. And I don't think bitcoin is going to be the only asset that backs Ust either. In the future. I think there's going to be additional layer one assets as they prove themselves that the community might think would make for good reserve assets. So, yeah, I don't see it as an admission.
00:56:03.466 - 00:56:15.240, Speaker C: I see it as an evolution of the model. In the same way that Ethereum 2.0 isn't an admission that Ethereum doesn't work, because clearly Ethereum works. It's the most successful network in crypto. It's just that this is a better model.
00:56:18.730 - 00:56:40.270, Speaker B: For this to really work. Does this kind of require a trustless bridge ecosystem to be sufficiently built out? We don't really want the long term luna system to really just be dependent on trust. Right. We want to have these things baked into smart contracts using trustless bridges. Is that kind of the model for how we would get all these layer one assets also backing UST?
00:56:41.170 - 00:57:01.250, Speaker C: Yes. Yeah, we need good trustless bridges. But there are other design opportunities, right? Like you could create synthetic assets sort of at the layer one level with an oracle at the layer one level. There's a design space here which has different trust assumptions and different trade offs. But I don't think that that's the only possible solution.
00:57:01.590 - 00:57:23.130, Speaker A: Okay, Jordy, let's move on to the DPEG risk here, because that's something we've seen with other algo stablecoins, death spiral, dpegging, and eventual kind of like tombstone at the end of it. What are the risks of a DPEG event in the UST terra ecosystem?
00:57:24.190 - 00:58:09.650, Speaker D: Yeah, Ryan, I think it's the two that I touched upon. So one is there is a reduction in ust demand. And I think even Jose said how important that demand is. And the role that the Luna team has is to sustain that demand, because if the demand goes down, that really kind of creates a problem. So a reduction in demand because of anchor having to reduce its yields and then people finding higher yields somewhere else. Like I said, it's entirely possible that another layer one designs the same mechanism and gives a slightly higher yield, and that can create a relative. I mean, I agree with Jose.
00:58:09.650 - 00:58:45.220, Speaker D: It can't just be like a totally new layer, one that exists out of thin air because people won't trust it. And we've seen something similar recently with waves, which is not new, but it's kind of had some issues with a similar model. But an existing layer one can try to start seeing how successful this design is, can just start doing it themselves and increase yield a little bit. So there's a lot of ways that the demand for UsT can go down. Now. What they're trying to do in the meantime, I don't think it's exactly marketing spend. I think what in effect, they're doing is buying time.
00:58:45.220 - 00:59:23.950, Speaker D: They are buying time on the luna side to say, we will do this for a year, and in that year, we will go all out and integrate as many places as we can in the defi ecosystem. We will get on curve, we will get on the pools. We will try to have UsT perpetuals trading instead of USDT tether perpetuals for trading venues. We will put USt everywhere to the point where we try to. It's sort of a bet that you can create enough use cases where people will just. We've been living with tether risk for years, right? Because we need it. We need it to exist.
00:59:23.950 - 00:59:53.574, Speaker D: Trading venues need it, binance needs it. And it's kind of been supported by the whole community. And in a way, I think the plan is make it similar to that. Make it similar to tether, not in the centralized sense, but in the sense of the community accepts that. Yeah, maybe we don't know if it's 100% backed, but we're just going to go with it. It's a gamble. And I'm not saying it's a bad gamble.
00:59:53.574 - 01:00:04.174, Speaker D: It's a gamble. I don't know if any of you guys have korean friends. I have korean friends, and they love to gamble, and it's fine, but we should say what's going on.
01:00:04.292 - 01:00:22.210, Speaker A: It's funny. One person's fake it till you make it is another person's like, that's just bootstrapping. And so I'm curious, Jose, what your response would be to the degging and I guess, death spiral risk in UST. Do you think it's overrated or underrated?
01:00:22.710 - 01:01:07.854, Speaker C: Well, the first thing I'd say is it's important to concede that there is a risk. Right. And people need to be aware of that risk when they both use UST and when they use Luna, because there is that risk. It's a design where that's happened in the past, and obviously that's there. But what I would say is that, first of all, even before the bitcoin reserves, actually, maybe if we go from a little bit higher level, when you have a design like Dai. Well, even higher level, actually. So all these things have risks, right? Dai, as safe as the over collateralized design is, nearly blew up in black Friday or whatever, black Thursday, whatever it was, because of congestion at the chain level, all these things have risks.
01:01:07.854 - 01:02:15.510, Speaker C: Even things that you don't think have risks and have smart contract bugs and things. And then also decentralized stables that use centralized collateral have a complete other set of risks, right? Which is that actually the collateral they're using could be censored. And if we go PvP with governments, which is the real PvP, rather than the PvP against each other, that's like a very real risk. So there's like a spectrum of risks. And it's not that UST is the only risky stablecoin, it's that stablecoins have different sets of risks and trade offs that they make, right? And so the trade off for me between Dai and UST, which are the two biggest decentralized stablecoins, is that Dai prioritizes safety and protection from tail risk over growth, and UST prioritizes growth and capital efficiency over downside risk, right? And so what we've seen with Dai is it's really hard to grow it because demand for Dai actually doesn't grow the supply of Dai. It's the demand for leverage that does. And so maker ends up competing with other lending platforms for this, which is why they've had to add centralized collateral like USDC.
01:02:15.510 - 01:02:48.180, Speaker C: And so that's a problem in itself. And then UST, obviously, as we've seen, can grow much quicker. But the trade off is this downside risk that we're talking about, this tail risk that can happen with the reflexivity death spiral. And just like Jordy explained it really well, but there's kind of two scenarios, right, with a death spiral. One is like Luna bear market or crypto bear market, Luna crashes. People are like, oh, shit, I don't know if Luna can I swear on this. Maybe you can bleep it out later.
01:02:48.180 - 01:03:14.860, Speaker C: Yeah. Luna crashes. Everyone's like, I don't know if Luna can honor all its liabilities in UST. They start redeeming their UST more. Luna gets minted, the price crashes further more people want to redeem UST, et cetera. And then the second one is, it starts with UST instead, right? There's a large contraction of demand for UST, which mints a lot of Luna. Price goes down, and then the death spiral starts that way.
01:03:14.860 - 01:03:48.038, Speaker C: And so the first thing I would say is that Luna is backed by every stablecoin. But Luna specifically is backed by three things, right? The first and most important one is demand for itself. Non speculative demand is really the holy grail of backing for a stablecoin. And that's what backed Luna for most of its history, other than in certain contractions where Luna had to come in. The second thing that backs Luna is Luna itself. Right? In that it absorbs shifts in demand for UST. When demand goes down, Luna gets minted to absorb that.
01:03:48.038 - 01:04:51.080, Speaker C: And now we have this third layer as well, which is this bitcoin reserve, which effectively acts as an escape hatch and breaks that reflexivity spiral, right? Because now when people want to redeem UST and there's a large contraction, sharp contraction, in demand, instead of having to mint Luna, they have this ability to this escape hatch, this escape valve, which is bitcoin, where they can redeem it for bitcoin, which reduces the pressure on Luna and breaks that reflexive death spiral, which is really the problem. That's all clear. The valid question to ask about this is whether 3 billion is enough, right? Given that UST is now at 16 billion, is 3 billion actually enough reserves to protect it? And I think the honest answer is that no one knows. It's impossible to model these things. Reflexivity is really hard to model, right? All these things, you have variables that aren't independent. They all actually are recursive and depend on each other. So it's really hard to model.
01:04:51.080 - 01:05:25.534, Speaker C: What I would say is the system survived up till now with no reserves. And so I think the psychological impact of this is going to be huge. And then I would also say that what the LFG raise really shows is that people understand, investors understand the upside of UST, which is the other side of the trade off, right? Which is that you can grow faster. Stablecoins are a network effects business. There's going to be one or a few big winners on this. There's a bunch of network effects, liquidity, Lindy. And so it's really difficult to unseat a stablecoin.
01:05:25.534 - 01:06:20.246, Speaker C: And what we've seen is that when you start with collateralization, you don't necessarily get demand, but when you start with demand, you can get collateralization. That's what the LFG raise proves, right? And what we're seeing right now, I have good reason to believe there's enough demand on secondary markets to bring Luna above sort of 50% to 75% in bitcoin reserves just right now through transactions on the secondary market. And so my view is that basically 3 billion, I don't know if it's enough, but if it isn't, I think Luna can collateralize itself over time, both through these secondary sales and collateralize the wrong word. Reserves is really the right word, but it can grow those reserves over time, both on the secondary market and through senior edge. So changing the mechanism so that instead of all the luna being burnt, part of it's actually used to acquire bitcoin over time so that the reserves can grow organically over time. That's my view on it.
01:06:20.348 - 01:06:31.580, Speaker A: I have one quick question then. We're going to have to pause for a break. And look, guys, if you're okay with it, we want to go over time because this has been such an insightful conversation. We still have a few more topics to cover. Is that cool?
01:06:31.950 - 01:06:32.410, Speaker D: Absolutely.
01:06:32.480 - 01:07:29.782, Speaker A: More time after the break. Okay, just one quick follow up on this, Jose. I mean, you mentioned Lindy effect, right? And you also mentioned you'll maker being tested in 2020. Part of me wonders about this. Has Ust actually been tested, because the real test of, I think any stablecoin design, algorithmic or otherwise, is how does it sustain? Not during the good times, but during the bad times, as Jordy was saying earlier, the tail risk events and when maker had that ETH price drop with exorbitant gas fees and everything in the COVID drop of Black Thursday in March of 2020, that was a huge testing event for maker and people didn't know how it would fare because it never had felt something like that before. But it made it out, it sustained it. On the other side, I'm curious whether Luna has actually been tested.
01:07:29.782 - 01:08:00.166, Speaker A: In your mind. It's one thing for an elgo stablecoin to work during a bull run, and Luna has had an absolutely massive secular bull run for the last year or more. That's one thing, but that's easy mode. That's not what a stablecoin is meant to be built for. It's meant to be built when there's earthquakes and tornadoes and hurricanes and the entire world is shaking around you. Has it been tested in that way? And do you think that is an important piece in terms of building the.
01:08:00.188 - 01:08:32.574, Speaker C: Credibility of this system 100% or the terra community's equivalent of the maker? Black Thursday was May 2021. So May 2021. Last year, where Luna dropped from, there was a contraction in UST supply at the same time as there was sort of some coordinated FUD around Luna. Not to say coordinated in the sense of that there was anything malicious, just that it all happened at the same time. Right. It was very adverse market conditions. Luna dropped from 20 plus dollars to $3 in that time.
01:08:32.574 - 01:09:07.370, Speaker C: There was a contraction in UST supply, but then buyers came in for Luna and the system survived. Right. And there was a lot of lessons learned from that, both in terms of on the mechanism side, increasing on chain liquidity, changing some of the parameters for minting and burning, and also other lessons that have been learned there. Now, UST was much smaller when that happened. So I do think there will be other tests. I don't think the UsT or lunar journey is going to be up only. So I think there are going to be other tests for it, but certainly it's been battle tested.
01:09:07.370 - 01:09:55.050, Speaker C: The other thing that was really actually promising during that may drop was that while Luna was dropping and sort of the death spiral was underway, effectively, you actually saw deposits on anchor increase, which means that there were some people that were actually selling Luna for UST, fleeing to safety. Right. And so what that shows, and it's like a really positive thing, I think, psychologically, is that some people already see Ust as their safe haven. When shit hits the fan on chain, they're actually fleeing to UST and going into anchor and saying, I need a break, I need to go into stables. And so imagine anyone doing that with ESD or. Right, like, no one is fleeing to the safety of ESD or DSD.
01:09:56.110 - 01:10:26.020, Speaker D: Just interrupt. I don't know if you can say that's proof that smart people, the smart money is doing it within the terra ecosystem, within people who are lunatics. It makes sense. They're like, should I have the variable one or the stable one? And I'm going to stay within the ecosystem. I'm not going to bridge out, I'm not going to find a way out. I'm just going to move between the two. I agree with a lot of what you said, but I'm not sure that that necessarily proves something that smart people are doing that.
01:10:27.350 - 01:10:44.250, Speaker C: No comment on the smart people thing, but it does prove Lindy right. It proves that for some people, it's a stable coin, it's safety. It proves that there's like a psychological sort of belief in it that some people have. And it's hard to deny whether you would do it and whether you think it was smart for them to do it.
01:10:44.320 - 01:11:01.840, Speaker D: Fair enough. Fair enough. I'm trying to say every community like a cardano. If Cardano community there was a market crash, they would do the same. Every community that is a community, that is a layer one, there will be people within that community, within that layer one that seek to do that.
01:11:02.690 - 01:11:30.330, Speaker C: But I'd say it's slightly different. I agree, but I'd say it's slightly different because one thing is buying Cardano when it drops and you're like Cardano to the I'm happy the price know I get to buy more. Whatever the cope stuff that people say at those points. Another thing is buying the actual stablecoin, right? Because that shows that you trust the system. It's not even that you're not buying it for profit or you're buying the dip. You're actually just like using the system as it's meant to be designed. So I think it's a slightly different point.
01:11:30.400 - 01:11:48.110, Speaker D: I agree with your it's different. And I do want to ask you, would you not say that in terms of lindiness, the upcoming, like you said, the yield reduction in anchor is going to be a whole new different type of test that we don't know yet what's going to happen with that.
01:11:48.260 - 01:12:00.500, Speaker C: Yeah, I would say so. I'm pretty positive on that. I don't think it'll matter that much for the reasons I said before, but I agree it's going to be a big test and the test space now will be much bigger than the ones faced previously for sure.
01:12:01.670 - 01:12:30.266, Speaker B: Awesome, guys. Thank you for going on that back and forth. That was immensely interesting. There are a couple of subjects which we haven't touched on yet, which we definitely need to before we wrap up this show. The pool four is definitely clamoring, being talked about throughout the ecosystem, both on the maker side and on the terra side. It seems to be that the word maker just creates a bunch of just very strong emotions. According to the YouTube chat that I've been watching, they do not like that word.
01:12:30.266 - 01:13:10.038, Speaker B: So we're going to have to talk about the. There's also. We want to talk about Doe Kwan himself, the level of key man risk that is associated with UST and do Kwan. The guy has a ton of confidence lately and I want to get your perceptions as to the level of risk. And there's also the conversation of just simply being too big to fail. And is this an actual intentful strategy by the terra ecosystem? Just become so large that it becomes too big to fail? And what does that even mean? So these are the remaining topics that we want to get your opinions on. And we'll get there right after we talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible.

01:15:45.310 - 01:16:22.902, Speaker A: Hey guys, we are back with Jose and Jordy. This is the best debate I've ever heard on this topic. Just fantastic. So we appreciate these two for going over time with us, but we just wanted to make sure we covered all of the topics to best inform you. Here's another topic. Some I think the bears of the critics of Luna and UST would say that there's a lot of key man risk. Some might even say like, is this like banker type risk? Doe Kwan is appearing more and more as kind of an Elon musk type of figure, I would say in the community, and take that for kind of the good and the bad side of things.
01:16:22.902 - 01:17:25.978, Speaker A: But definitely somebody who makes statements like by my own hand, Dai will die. When talking about the competition between maker and the Dai ecosystem and UST, some have talked about how maybe Doe Kwan is flying a bit close to the sun with some of these statements and maybe some of the regulatory risk that's going on as well. Of course the SEC is in play, but when you have a centralized, you would say decentralized, I think, Jose. But when you have a stablecoin of this type, you might attract some unwanted attention from regulators as well. And all of this kind of comes down to do Kwan and sort of a smaller operating team would be the criticism. I'm curious, first of all, maybe the bear case for all of this. From your perspective, Jordy, do you think that there's some key man risk that the UST terra ecosystem is dealing with? Do you think there are some centralization vectors? How would you talk about this piece of it?
01:17:26.144 - 01:17:56.660, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm glad you said centralization vectors because I think that's the bigger issue in terms of do Kwan. I think he's phenomenally intelligent. He's been making very good decisions, and he's the reason why this has gone as far as it's gone compared to the things that have not even gone out of the gate. Obviously there's Keyman risk. If he gets hit by a bus here in Singapore tomorrow, everyone's going to sell. That's a problem. I don't have a huge problem with that because we are early stages and he's building something that eventually is supposed to kind of run itself.
01:17:56.660 - 01:18:24.800, Speaker D: I don't think it's a question that right now there is a Keyman risk. I don't want to personally focus on that, because anything like you could say that about Elon and like, does that mean, like, Tesla should not exist because there's human risk? I don't think it's a big deal in itself. I do want to touch on the second point about centralization. I don't know if Jose wants to answer about do Kwan first, though. He's obviously worked with him when I haven't. Maybe he can answer about that.
01:18:26.130 - 01:18:33.140, Speaker C: Go ahead. I probably agree with your take on it pretty closely. So, yeah, go ahead on the centralization point, and then I can answer both.
01:18:33.510 - 01:19:10.480, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, the bigger issue I have is we're talking about decentralization, this decentralized stablecoin. I don't know that there is enough diversity in the ecosystem, in the people who are building and supporting the ecosystem yet. And I'm not talking about Doe. I'm talking more kind of like the jump, jump, capital jump, crypto, whatever they call themselves now. They are such a huge backer and supporter that I think overshadows, obviously Delphi as well. But I'm sure you're behind the scenes. You kind of know what I'm talking about.
01:19:10.480 - 01:19:39.720, Speaker D: It's a bit less organic than some of the other layer ones, and that's going to take a while to change. And I don't know exactly how we get from point a to point b, where it is a community, fully decentralized kind of run thing, as opposed to you have one brilliant founder and a very powerful kind of company. That's really. How do you get from point a to point b?
01:19:42.490 - 01:19:45.798, Speaker C: Yep. Do you want me to comment on that now?
01:19:45.884 - 01:19:47.894, Speaker A: Yeah, go ahead. Respond, Jose.
01:19:48.022 - 01:20:17.780, Speaker C: Cool. Yeah. So the first thing to say is, I obviously really believe in, like, I wouldn't be in this space if I didn't think that was super important. However, I believe in progressive decentralization. Right. And I do think projects need to decentralize over time and in the right way. And I think the way, especially for a stablecoin, because a stablecoin requires a lot of get shit done energy.
01:20:17.780 - 01:20:42.502, Speaker C: You need to push integrations, you need to build products around it. You need to do all the stuff that kind of do. Quan has been so good at doing. And I think what we see, like, when you decentralize too early, is sort of what you're seeing in my mind, by the way, this is just my opinion on the maker governance forums, and I'm a huge fan of maker. It was my first altcoin that I bought after Ethereum. I learned loads on those maker forums back in the day. So big fan of maker.
01:20:42.502 - 01:21:21.158, Speaker C: But to me, to see their governance at work now is a huge disappointment, right? It's a massive bureaucratic mess. There's committees for everything. People aren't well paid like communities weighing in and commenting on things. They're very focused on risk assessment versus growth. Rune, the founder of maker, kind of admitted he doesn't understand the curve wars, which are sort of like the lifeblood of liquidity for stable coins in a decentralized world. They seem to have sort of an arrogant attitude towards defi generally that it's all ponzies and the only thing that matters is these real world assets and green bonds and all this. So I do think that decentralizing too early is a problem.
01:21:21.158 - 01:22:18.446, Speaker C: And for me, the right way to decentralize is actually to do what Tara is doing and onboard these big organizations with skin in the game that act as like a separate participant and stakeholder in the ecosystem, right? And there's a bunch of those now obviously jump, as Jordy pointed out, is a big one, I would say Delphi Labs. So the part of Delphi that I head up is another big one, sort of contributing to projects in the terra ecosystem. In the recent round, we had some really good additions with three arrows and others. There's someone behind the scenes that are doing a lot of work in the terra ecosystem. And I do think that's the right way to decentralize, right. With these big organizations that are focused, that have skin in the game. And the other thing to remember is we're literally decentralizing now would be so early because ust market cap is 16 billion and this is a multitrillion dollar market, right? And it's much easier to grow fast when you're more centralized than it is decentralized.
01:22:18.446 - 01:23:13.642, Speaker C: And so for me, the plan should be to progressively decentralize over time, grow supply loads, and then once you have that Lindy effect and once you've grown decentralize and focus on robustness, and obviously there's a balance, but that's sort of my take. And I do think decentralization in crypto, unfortunately often gets used as sort of a way for founders that have made it to kind of semi retire, right, and become contributors and pass it off to the community when really the project isn't ready for that and it needs the founder it needs that founder energy to kind of push things forward, not that they should be a centralized point of control. And Doe isn't right, the system would work without him, but they need that energy of contribution and that inspirational leadership to push it forward. And then in terms of key man risk, clearly there's key man risk around Doe. He's a machine. I've worked with a lot of founders in the space. I'd say Doe is the best one.
01:23:13.642 - 01:23:34.738, Speaker C: Maybe along with Stanny, he's like a really good mix of sort of a great engineer and a very sharp engineering brain with hustle vision. And then he's obviously made it several times over, but is still incredibly motivated, works harder than me, takes less holidays than I do. So it's clearly key man risk around that. Hard to avoid in an early stage project.
01:23:34.904 - 01:24:40.310, Speaker A: Jose, with the spectrum of centralization and decentralization, I'm wondering if you agree with this take, right, so you've got a bitcoin and ethereum, which are maybe on the far left side of the decentralization spectrum, like veering towards most decentralized, right? And then you have the traditional tradfi system. That's called that kind of the right side of the spectrum, right? And then you have like crypto banks, you have the ftxs of the world, and you have the coinbases of the world that are a bit left of the traditional finance because they're using decentralized crypto networks to settle things, that sort of thing. Some people have compared the terra ecosystem to almost like this hybrid mix. It's sort of like fintech ish meets blockchain, and placed it kind of somewhere in the middle, this hybrid sort of blend. Do you think that's where you'd place it, in the decentralization spectrum? Or do you think it's more kind of toward the left, more decentralized over time, and maybe competing with layer ones like ethereum and bitcoin.
01:24:41.450 - 01:25:17.006, Speaker C: Yeah, I think even putting decentralization on like a linear spectrum is really tough, because there are ways in which Ethereum is extremely decentralized, but then also its main stablecoin is entirely centralized. And actually the biggest stablecoins in Ethereum are completely centralized. They're just ious for dollars in a bank account. And those are the undercurrent of all of Ethereum defi. And so if those go down, Ethereum, it really has a big centralized attack vector in decentralized stablecoins. So technically, in terms of node count and all of that, Ethereum is extremely decentralized. But then it has this very centralized attack vector.
01:25:17.006 - 01:26:00.558, Speaker C: And I think that's why it's hard to put it on like a spectrum. In terms of terra, I would say the system itself, from a technical perspective, is fairly decentralized. Nowhere near as decentralized as Ethereum in terms of node count and all of that. But it's a tendermint chain, right? So it's proof of stake. Tendermint chain. What I would say is centralized is just like there are organizations in the ecosystem who can make a big impact on the success or failure of this. Like jump, like TfL, like Doe, if you'd agree with that, like LFG, but now there's an increasing number of those to the point where that is becoming a decentralizing force in itself.
01:26:00.558 - 01:26:13.380, Speaker C: So that's kind of my take on it. I think the system is decentralized, but there are some centralized entities that are a big sort of part of its success. Does that make sense?
01:26:15.430 - 01:26:17.518, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a good take. David's on mute.
01:26:17.614 - 01:26:25.778, Speaker B: Thank you. Yeah, thank you for that, Jose. Jordi, what thoughts have come to mind before we go and move on to any other subjects? Anything that's come up to your brain.
01:26:25.954 - 01:26:37.610, Speaker D: I mean, in terms of you start centralized and you make incremental steps. I fully believe in that. In terms of the ecosystem, the fact that two main big groups are building a lot of the primitives.
01:26:39.710 - 01:26:40.186, Speaker C: I have.
01:26:40.208 - 01:27:27.930, Speaker D: Mixed feelings about it. I know one team that's been working hard to try to get one of the options protocols out on Terra, and they just realized that, oh, they just launched one that's backed by the founding team. How are we going to compete with them when they're backed by Doe and these guys? And we wanted to launch the same thing. So you're going to have a lot of the ecosystem be kind of. You have that a little bit with Solana, but not as much. I think Solana has quite a diverse group of founders that ultimately are not necessarily all FTX related, et cetera, or jump related. But look, at the end of the game, does it really matter what ecosystem Terra has? If the key thing is the stablecoin? For me, it might not even matter.
01:27:27.930 - 01:27:49.490, Speaker D: It might just matter what they managed to do in terms of going to other chains and getting ust on other chains and making it spread everywhere, as opposed to necessarily building all the primitives on terra, if they do really good ones, then it could work. It's obviously got the narrative right now, so I don't have a strong opinion, I guess.
01:27:49.640 - 01:28:47.400, Speaker B: Well, okay, talking about Ust on other chains, I think it's exactly where we want to go next. Recently, Doquan proposed the four pool, a new curve pool between UST, Frax, USDC and USDT. So that's, of course, Terra USD, the fracs, stablecoin, USDC, and then tether, most importantly, pushing out Dai, removing Dai from the curve pool. And he was claiming that the curve wars are over and that all emissions are going to the four pool, meaning that all the incentives are going to be to adding liquidity to the four pool rather than the previous pool with Dai in it. So, Jose, I want to get your perspective on this. Do Kwan tweeted out by my hand, Dai will die, which is a pretty agro thing to tweet. Like, what's his deal with Maker? Why does he not like maker so much? And how does this four pool from curve kind of fit into the story?
01:28:49.290 - 01:29:33.060, Speaker C: I think, like, at least this is my. Don't, you know, pretend to speak for doe. It's just that maker and generally, there's sort of a group of people on Twitter that are constantly making some pretty malformed arguments against UST and also just calling it like a ponzi and referring it to it and stuff like that. And I think it must be frustrating as a founder who's put their life's work into this and created something pretty incredible, which is an algorithmic stablecoin that has worked and is now and doing everything that he's doing. I think it must be pretty annoying to keep hearing that. And I think maker has been pretty arrogant about it and sort of dismissive of it. And I think my interpretation is that's rubbed him the wrong way.
01:29:33.060 - 01:30:04.638, Speaker C: I don't know if that's accurate or not. And then in terms of the four pool, it's a huge move. Right? The three pool is the biggest and most liquid pool on curve. So it ends up being the bridge pool for a lot of stablecoin swaps and then the bridge pool for a lot of swaps generally, especially as curve v two and the volatile assets becomes bigger with this. And Fracs had its own pool, which it was participating in the curve war. So, like buying a lot of convex in order to influence. And then Terra had its own pool that, again, it was doing the same thing.
01:30:04.638 - 01:30:45.340, Speaker C: And they've basically teamed up, right? They've kind of cartelified along with redacted. And there's also, I think, a few others joining this coalition in order to put in this four pool, which will know Fracs, UST, Tether, and USDC and send all incentives towards this pool, which should make it the most liquid pool in stablecoin pool in Defi and become the bridge pool so that fracs and UST become the reference decentralized stablecoins across chain. So pretty huge move. I was really taken aback by it. I'd be curious to hear what Jordy thinks about it, actually, because it seems like a big thing.
01:30:47.230 - 01:31:21.640, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, we've been talking about the curve wars for a while now, and now we've actually seen somebody make a move and try to get consortium together and pull something like this off. I think it's interesting. We're very much an experimental phase here. And seeing Olympus join in, you're having these strange bedfellows here where you're kind of getting the votes. We're in experimental land. I'm interested to see how it all plays out. Yeah.
01:31:21.640 - 01:31:24.822, Speaker D: Eating my popcorn on this one.
01:31:24.876 - 01:31:30.650, Speaker A: Jordy, do you think this will result in the full saturation of ethereum defi with UST?
01:31:31.710 - 01:32:08.786, Speaker D: No, I don't think it's that we're. There's so many assumptions. First of all, the assumption that centralized stablecoins are problematic right now. I mean, I agree with, eventually we have to create something for when the day comes and we need to have something decentralized. But I don't think that the vast majority of USDC being used on Ethereum is going to stop being utilized. I'm not sure about Dai's prospects. Obviously, that's a different story, and I'm not an expert on it, so I can't comment on Dai's prospects.
01:32:08.786 - 01:32:17.160, Speaker D: But in terms of like, USDC being outstripped by UST, I don't think we're at that stage right now.
01:32:17.610 - 01:33:04.294, Speaker C: I don't think we're at that stage either. But I do think you, if you just zoom out to the long term, which is the way we work at Delphi, is we just try and figure out what's the future of crypto going to be, what should it be? And then we just try and figure it out to invest in it, but also just build towards it, right? And for me, it's pretty clear that centralized stablecoins will not be the long term solution for a bunch of reasons. Right? Their bank accounts can get frozen and suddenly they're insolvent. They can get forced to freeze transactions. They have the power to unilaterally freeze balances, right? And they can get forced or coerced to do that by governments. But then there's even smaller things like they're facilitating hundreds of billions of dollars of transactions for clients that they know nothing about. And that's going to be a problem for nation states at some point.
01:33:04.294 - 01:33:51.042, Speaker C: They're going to be like, hey, who are these people that are transacting? Is there any KYC here and stuff? And you can't do that for dier or for Ust in the same way. And if those products become KYC, they just become way less relevant. Right? And it's not the case that it'll get regulated and all go at once. I don't think that's necessarily going to happen. What's going to happen is, let's say suddenly they start freezing balances from people who didn't pay their taxes, right? Governments find some links from centralized exchanges to people who didn't declare it on their taxes. They find out they have USDC, they contact circle and get them to freeze their balance. Suddenly that doesn't just affect people who don't pay their taxes, right? First of all, it affects all the crypto people who don't pay their taxes, who I think is a big amount of people, but it also affects everyone else, because suddenly you're like, damn, when I hold these stables, this isn't actually crypto.
01:33:51.042 - 01:34:39.070, Speaker C: It becomes very visceral, right? This isn't crypto that will cause the slow move. And then if they do something like Kyc, that'll again cause more of a. So I think slowly over time, it'll all move to decentralized coins. That's kind of how we're positioning ourselves. And then just one thing I wanted to touch on that Jordy said before about other layer ones being able to copy the design, I agree that they should do it. I think it's a good idea because you literally own your biggest use case, right? You verticalize and own one of your biggest use cases rather than letting someone else build on top of it. And rather than letting it become centralized as well, which is another big problem, I do think it's going to be really tough for the reasons mentioned before, that it's not a mechanism like it is a mechanism, but it's much more than a mechanism.
01:34:39.070 - 01:35:19.042, Speaker C: It's actually the economy and the demand that's built around it. And so the layer one would end up having the same problem where it has to go through all its applications and ask them to integrate it, right? So I think you need both a layer one that's willing to do it, and like a visionary or a group of visionaries that can build all these use cases around it and get people to actually use it, because otherwise you risk blowing up your layer one as well. Right? With something like this, as ESD and DSD did. And also you can fork the mechanism, you can't fork the reserves, you can't fork the Lindy, you can't fork the experience of a year and a half of running this. So I do think that's much tougher than generally copying a mechanism is.
01:35:19.176 - 01:36:14.430, Speaker A: But Jose, one question I have for you is about the first point about AML Kyc and having a decentralized stablecoin being important to stand up against the USDCs of the world. Why do you think the same fate won't befall Ust? So there are many centralization vectors, the LFG group being one of them. Certainly the jump capitals of the world are highly regulated institutions. Some of this is executed via bridges, which also could be kind of a centralization vector. I think someone who is very into the consensus layer of chains might even say sort of proof of stake validators that are run by third parties and not by users from their own homes are another centralization vector. Can you give me the case for why this doesn't also just happen to Uste?
01:36:14.590 - 01:36:49.326, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a good question. There's an important distinction, which is in Luna, no one can seize assets or freeze balances, right? There's no one you can subpoena, you can subpoena, jump and be, you know, I want you to freeze this wallet. This dude hasn't paid his taxes. They can't do that, right? Neither can doe, neither can tfl. No one can do that. In USDC, there's a clear entity circle, which is actually a us entity. And so in the US jurisdiction, that can freeze balances, and if they receive a subpoena and an order by the US government, they are able to do it.
01:36:49.326 - 01:37:08.150, Speaker C: So it's a case of you trusting whether they will or won't, whereas with Terra, you can't. So there are centralization vectors you can hit and make things difficult. So you could say no one can integrate UST because they're not doing Kyc in the US or something like that, but you can't actually destroy it in the same way that you could with something like USDC or tether.
01:37:09.690 - 01:37:29.180, Speaker B: I do want to get back into. And just to wrap up the conversation around the four pool, Jose, can you measure for us the significance of the adoption of the four pool in lieu of the three critical of how big of a W would that be for UST, and how big of an L? Would that be for.
01:37:34.670 - 01:38:38.190, Speaker C: A massive win? I don't have stats off the top of my head, but it would be a massive win, right? Like curve is the liquidity hub for stablecoins in Defi, and basically dai, through the three pool is the most liquid decentralized stable coin on curve. This would make it not the case, right? It would make UST and fracs the most liquid decentralized stablecoins on curve. So it's a huge thing, because if you want to bridge from stablecoins to other stablecoins, or just if you want access to the UST ecosystem, everything becomes way easier when you have the most liquidity. And liquidity is one of the biggest moats with decentralized stablecoins. Now, Rune and I also think makers response is sort of like classic, which is just, they point out that unlike something like this happening to ust, this isn't a threat to the Dai peg, right? Which is true. Dai's design means that it losing a huge amount of utility and demand isn't a threat to its peg, but it is a threat to its stablecoin. So it is a stablecoin, and it's not enough to just be pegged.
01:38:38.190 - 01:38:59.546, Speaker C: You have to grow to win in this market. Stablecoins are going to be huge. And if you're not growing, if you're just pegging, that's not enough. These aren't risk management products. That's one side of it. But there's the other side, which is the adoption, the utility and demand, which I feel like is just not being considered. And the response to me is sort of symptomatic of what I see as the problem with them.
01:38:59.546 - 01:39:05.594, Speaker C: And obviously people will disagree, and some people are very bullish on the real world asset strategy. Yeah. So just my take.
01:39:05.792 - 01:39:53.238, Speaker A: Let's talk about maybe the last thing we haven't talked about with all of this, which is what would actually happen during a deeping type scenario. I think both of you acknowledge that there is some risk there, and Jose would rate it far lower than Jordy. But I think, of course, we're all in defi as we end every bankless podcast with this is risky. You could lose everything, right? And certainly algo, stablecoins have been risky in the past. And so let me just walk through like a nightmare scenario for you, why people are maybe worried about this, critics are worried about this. If UST fails, it could drag the entire industry down with this. But let's say there is some big de pegging event, massive liquidation, bunch of investors get liquidated all across chains.
01:39:53.238 - 01:40:44.250, Speaker A: Lots of people lose a lot of money, and the next thing you know, Elizabeth Warren is on CNN saying, hey, I told you guys the shadowy supercoders were going to take from retail, and here they are again. Right? And we have to regulate this industry. We have to clamp down on it. We have to outlaw it until we understand what's going on. It can't be the wild west anymore, and it drags the entire crypto space down with it. That is what some people would say is kind of the tail event risk of something like USC growing too big and then suddenly collapsing. I'm curious, Jordy, what you think about this? Do you think this is a possible scenario? Is this something that you worry about? Or do you think even, like, bears and critics who say that are getting a bit over their skis, and then we'll get Jose to respond.
01:40:45.390 - 01:40:52.986, Speaker D: As an aside, I like how I used over the skis thing early, like in the introduction, and since then, I've noticed everyone's used it in different language.
01:40:53.018 - 01:40:54.560, Speaker A: Is memetic, my friend.
01:40:56.850 - 01:41:52.874, Speaker D: Look, it's a risk, like we just said, and I don't think that me and Jose are in huge disagreement about the chance of the risk. Maybe a little bit, but not to a huge extent in terms of the Elizabeth Warren thing, she's been bringing know Wonderland, whatever's been going on that's negative in crypto, she'll bring up now, if something happens in the next few months, I don't think it's necessarily a big deal. I mean, it's a big deal, but it's not going to be the end of the world if it happens in a year where everyone is already assuming that UsT is money, it's equal to a dollar, and something, for whatever reason, happens at that time. Yeah, it'll shake the foundation of crypto. A lot of people might get hurt. And the thing that I hate about it the most, you see how these things play out. We've seen them recently.
01:41:52.874 - 01:42:29.610, Speaker D: We've had mim, Wonderland, so we've seen the curve pool there. There's a certain amount of liquidity that you can get out of, and what ends up happening is out of nowhere, you just have, like, Alameda, one of these huge whales, just smacks the whole thing for 500 million or whatever, takes everything out. They'll take a hit. They'll take a $50 million loss because they've accepted the slippage that comes along with such a big order, but they will just unilaterally suck all the liquidity out. And that's the signal for everybody else to panic. But it's kind of too late because the money is already gone. There's not much USDC, USDT left in.
01:42:29.610 - 01:43:04.662, Speaker D: So in that nightmare scenario, the thing that I hated about the most is that the big players, who are like the big whales, we don't need to talk. Who they are, will probably be able to swipe the curve pool. First, they'll take out the best price and then the system that Luna has for until the bitcoin system comes along. Right now, they just will use Luna as the collateral. There's a cap every day. This is what we saw back in last May. There's $20 million cap.
01:43:04.662 - 01:43:20.730, Speaker D: Now, even if that's increased 100 million, the reality is that the retail guys are not going to be able to get any of that 20 million per day. It'll just instantly be taken out every day. 20 million luna or 20 million UST.
01:43:21.630 - 01:43:27.630, Speaker C: We can go check the stats. I don't think the daily cap is 20 million UST, but we can go check that afterwards.
01:43:28.130 - 01:43:46.206, Speaker D: Okay. I'm pretty sure back in May that it was only $20 million of UST, but back then, the price of Luna was so small that you may be right. Maybe it was just because it wasn't that far from a dollar at the time that maybe. The point being there is some cap and I don't think it's 20 million luna.
01:43:46.398 - 01:43:51.974, Speaker C: No, it's not 20 million luna, but I don't know. Yeah, we'll get the exact numbers for listeners maybe for this.
01:43:52.092 - 01:44:23.054, Speaker D: My understanding is that it used to be 10 million and then jump pushed to 20 million. And there's been discussion about getting it to 100 million. And what we see in times of demand, like recently, is every day. It's capped at the max every day, but in the other direction, people are trying to get into Terra because they want to get on anchor. So it's capped every day. And someone's making a lot of money on the arbitrage because they can make 30, 40 bips. You can go to finance, sell it for 40 bips above the peg, and somebody is getting, like, all 20 right away and making, like 40 bips on it.
01:44:23.054 - 01:44:42.870, Speaker D: The reverse is going to happen in the bad scenario where the people who are actually able to get out are going to cap the supply and those are going to be like the sophisticated whales. So you'll have the curve pool taken out and then you'll have the max supply every day. So that's a nightmare scenario. I hope doesn't happen. But unfortunately, if it does happen, it won't be very equitable.
01:44:43.290 - 01:45:03.680, Speaker A: So, Jose, back to you. Jordy is manifesting some 2008 energy where retail is once again left holding the bag for a tail risk event like this. How do you respond to maybe that moral risk, the moral hazard here of an experiment like UST getting too big?
01:45:04.530 - 01:45:33.106, Speaker C: Yeah, it would definitely be catastrophic. I think right now it would be mainly catastrophic for terra itself. So obviously, like Luna holders, Luna would death spiral to some asymptote towards zero. I suppose UST would do the same. So be very catastrophic for terra itself. There is a lot of UST on Ethereum and liquidity pools, but I don't think most of the effect would really be on terra itself. That actually changes with the four pool.
01:45:33.106 - 01:46:03.034, Speaker C: Right, where the effect would be more systemic in that case, because it would be the reference currency for DeFi as a whole. But I don't really agree with the idea that retail would get screwed, because retail is just like smaller sizing. Right. So it'd be much easier for them to get out with lower slippage than it would for some of these big funds, where some of these big funds would literally just not be able to get out in size because of what you say, where the liquidity would just dry up on the curve pool. So I think obviously they'll be faster.
01:46:03.162 - 01:46:14.690, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly. It depends who gets out first. If they wait too long and somebody. I agree, it's a lot easier to go through the door if you're small, but you need to know. To get through the door, you need to know.
01:46:14.840 - 01:46:32.134, Speaker C: Absolutely. But I think there's also going to be, like, right now, most of the liquidity is on curve. I think astroport is going to be spinning up its own stablecoin pool. So there's going to be liquidity on terra, too. So users will be able to kind of exit that way. So I don't know. I agree that the whales will know first, but they'll also suffer a lot more slippage.
01:46:32.134 - 01:47:10.486, Speaker C: And we've also seen a few times where whales exited, suffered slippage for something that wasn't the death spiral they were looking for. So, yeah, I'm sensitive to the moral argument, obviously, but I do think two things. There's a moral argument for ust as well, right? There's a moral argument for decentralized stablecoins, like actual decentralized stablecoins that can't be stopped by nation states. So that's the first thing I think that's really important. And then the second thing is that everything in the space has failure risk. These are all experiments, including something like dai, like I mentioned before, almost blew up on Black Thursday. Right.
01:47:10.486 - 01:47:43.770, Speaker C: And that would have been at that time catastrophic for the space. Obviously, we have the Dow hack from back in the day, which was something that shouldn't have even been that risky, but was because it had a smart contract bug in it. So I think, as you say at the end, this is the frontier. We all kind of accept that risk when we play here. But I do think one thing that is important is that everyone, and especially if you have a platform and you're bullish, Luna, you're bullish ust you should be honest about the risks. Right. And that's something that we're very careful to do at Delphi.
01:47:43.770 - 01:48:03.800, Speaker C: When we present it, we're always careful to disclaim it in products that we help incubate or contribute to. It's always present in the disclaimers. And so I think being honest about the risks so that people know them is super important because that's actually what makes me bullish about this. It's not that I think it's riskless, it's that I understand the risks but think the upside far outweighs it.
01:48:05.690 - 01:48:20.030, Speaker A: Bullcase, bear case, it's time for closing arguments right now. And since we started with Jose, I'm going to flip to Jordy first, your closing arguments for why you think it makes sense to be bearish on ust.
01:48:21.090 - 01:49:00.714, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, we've used them interchangeably, but I'll just recap that I think they are a little bit different. The bear case for Luna, first, assuming that UST is okay, is that the demand gets kind of dwindled down because other chains do something similar, because somebody does a better mousetrap. There's ways that Luna price itself suffers without a DPEG. So that's kind of half of the equation. The other half is obviously on UST. So there's a lot of risks. The BTC bridge risk hasn't been figured out.
01:49:00.714 - 01:49:33.060, Speaker D: There's market risk. Unfortunately, BTC might go down, and then a lot of the reserves that have been built up, the narrative will change. BTC could go up, and then, like Jose said, everything just looks completely different. But we have to be aware of the risks. We have to be aware that there is centralization right now. There's big funds that are going to be able to kind of pull strings and have inside information and know things a lot earlier. So I'm very happy that Jose gave like a full disclaimer I think that's the most important thing.
01:49:33.060 - 01:50:01.840, Speaker D: There is indeed a moral argument for it succeeding and having something like that succeed. My full bear case is that we are very far away from that endpoint. There's a ton of stuff to figure out. Even with having such a good team working on it, we have no idea what's going to happen. Even in a few months when anchor yield goes down, there are so many unknowns. So that's the main bear case. We can't just consider it a foreground conclusion that we're going to get to this end state.
01:50:02.850 - 01:50:25.170, Speaker B: Jose, I'd love to hear your final thoughts, your final closing statements as to the bull case for Luna. And the chat is also asking, since they are perceiving the show, as to be focusing on the bear case. I just want to give you just a few extra minutes and a few extra time to really, just, with confidence, give us the bull case for Luna. Just make us all Luna Maxis.
01:50:25.910 - 01:51:01.374, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. All right. So first of all, I think you guys have been pretty good. Thank you very much for the platform and for opening this up to other opinions. I think one thing to note is, as lunatics, we need to be accepting of other communities and educating them on Luna and on risks, because Luna actually relies on like, UsT relies on being the reference stablecoin for DeFi as a whole, not just for Terra. So it needs to be on Ethereum, it needs to be everywhere. And being antagonistic and hating on people and criticizing and stuff is not the lunatic way.
01:51:01.374 - 01:51:44.222, Speaker C: I know that Doe sometimes counters that with some of his Twitter spice, which is, I love his Twitter spice, but it's always directed at a person, right? It's never directed at a community, and that's really important. There's no reason why we should hate Ethereum or hate any of the other chains. We're all going to make it basically on the Lunar bull argument. Sorry. So one of the biggest things that makes me bullish is how misunderstood it still is and controversial, and also how bad and repetitive some of the FUD is. So I think the peg fud and the anchor sustainability fud to me is actually pretty weak. I sort of explained my arguments for why I think that's the case.
01:51:44.222 - 01:52:09.462, Speaker C: I think there's stronger arguments against UST. I think probably the key man risk and just the technical, which we didn't cover. But just the fact that Terra isn't a particularly scalable layer one, and maybe that's not the end game. I think there are sort of arguments to that as well. But yeah, all our best investments have always been controversial. And how controversial this is is one of the things that makes me super bullish. And then in terms of UST itself.
01:52:09.462 - 01:53:05.078, Speaker C: So I think people just over index and focus on this peg risk and just repeat it over and over again without focusing on the upside, on what happens if it works. And what happens if it works is you have the UST as the biggest decentralized stablecoin, also, in my mind, the most decentralized in the biggest market in crypto, which is money, right? Decentralized stablecoins are literally going to be a multi trillion dollar industry. I think most people that are in crypto can agree with that. And UST currently is the fastest horse in that race. And if we agree that stablecoins are a network effect business, you need liquidity, you need Lindy, you need people to trust it, then you want to bet on the winners, and you want to bet on whoever's growing fastest. And UST's model, while more vulnerable to tailor risks, as we've spoken about, allows it to grow much faster. And that's a big deal, because if you grow fast in a network effects business, you win.
01:53:05.078 - 01:54:35.490, Speaker C: Which is why the anchor yield reserve subsidy makes so much sense, similar to the PayPal strategy, right, of subsidizing its initial users, and why this whole strategy makes so much sense to me. And so for me, it's like you have a stablecoin that was already working really well, growing really fast, that's becoming even stronger with a bitcoin reserve, a bitcoin reserve that is going to be finding ways to grow over time, both through additional sales, for which there's quite a lot of appetite from investors still, and then also from just growing it through senorige and continuing to buy bitcoin. And so I think you have a model that can grow super fast, and that's also becoming more and more resilient by the day with the addition of this LFG reserve. And then when you combine that with the layer one, that's thriving, where I continue to see some of the smartest builders that I've seen anywhere on crypto building on terra, whether it's in completely new primitives as well, that haven't succeeded on Ethereum, like Prism, which is a yield splitting primitive. There's APy and Pendle on Ethereum, but they really haven't succeeded, whereas I think Prism has done a much better job nailing that. There's other things, like perps with order book, forex, perps that are coming with Vertex, there's perps that are coming with Lavana, there's a whole ecosystem around gaming and nfts that those putting a lot of effort into. And so when you combine all of this, I just think there's no faster horse in the decentralized stablecoin race than UST, and we like to bet on winners.
01:54:36.230 - 01:54:54.860, Speaker A: There you go, bankless listeners. This has been the bull and bear case for Luna UsT probably the most comprehensive I've ever heard. I want to give a special thanks to both Jose and Jordy for joining us and having such a civil, informative, well argued debate. We appreciate you guys.
01:54:55.390 - 01:54:58.106, Speaker C: Thanks very much guys. Really appreciate it.
01:54:58.288 - 01:55:22.606, Speaker A: Thank you bankless nation. We will link to some of the things that Jose in particular referenced in the show notes as soon as we have some links. That's links to long term anchor yield. I think you referenced something there, a few other stats we might link to as well. But as always, got to end with this. None of this has been financial advice. I think our panelists were very clear that there are risks in crypto, there are risks in Defi.
01:55:22.606 - 01:55:33.686, Speaker A: They're just everywhere. But we want to let you know that you could definitely lose what you put in. We're headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
