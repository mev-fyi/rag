00:00:14.380 - 00:01:03.884, Speaker A: Hi everyone, this is defi dad. So today is the day that the compound protocol begins distributing its governance token comp. So what does that mean and how do I earn that token? So currently, the compound protocol, the team is in the transition of decentralizing. And part of that means enabling a token comp which allows you to vote on upgrades and proposals to the comp protocol. So the application itself is something that I've commonly used to either lend or supply digital assets and earn interest. Or you can borrow assets and you can pay interest for borrowing those. So if you go to compound finance, click on the app button, you'll end up on this dashboard.
00:01:03.884 - 00:02:12.996, Speaker A: In this simple example, I have lent one die, and that means that I am earning interest on that die. And so the way that I am able to earn the comp token is that they are distributing approximately 2880 comp per day. And then it's distributed proportional to the interest being accrued in that market. And then 50% of the distribution is earned by suppliers, 50% by borrowers. So what does that mean? If we look at how much interest is paid per day across the nine different markets on compound, you would notice that there's a lot more interest being paid on Dai, there's a lot more interest being paid on tether and a lot more on USDC. So if I am lending or borrowing in either of these or any of these markets, but especially Dai, tether and USDC, I'm earning a portion of those comp tokens. So keep in mind also it comes down to how much am I lending and borrowing.
00:02:12.996 - 00:02:48.290, Speaker A: So there's about 17 million die in the pool. So keep in mind that I'm only lending one die. So that's one die of the 17 million, which is a very small fraction. And then on top of that, the 2880 is split according to the proportions of interest being paid here. And the cool thing is that I don't have to keep track of any of this just because it's all run by smart contracts. And so that comp will accrue in my voting wallet once I've earned 0.1. Let's just double check that.
00:02:48.290 - 00:03:29.716, Speaker A: There we go. Once I've accrued at least 0.1 from a market, you can withdraw all undistributed comp from the protocol. So once I have earned the comp token, which again will show up here in my voting wallet, I can choose to use that to vote on future governance proposals. Or I could actually delegate those votes to someone else to do it. So if you notice here, instead of manual voting, I'm going to choose to delegate my voting. And what's cool about this is you actually can click here on the delegate leaderboard.
00:03:29.716 - 00:03:54.256, Speaker A: Take a look at others that hold lots of these tokens. And these tend to be investors and partners like Argent or dharma. Anyone who's using the compound protocol. There's even like the likes of a 16 z in here. So they've obviously got a lot. They were investors. But one of my friends, Ryan, is holding some comp tokens.
00:03:54.256 - 00:04:24.716, Speaker A: So I'm actually going to let him vote for me just in the future. I trust that he will probably pay closer attention than I will to some of these. And then I can even look back at his voting history or any of their voting histories just to see what they voted for and against. He voted against USDT support. If I agree with that, maybe that's another reason to delegate my votes to him. So if I go back to this, actually, I'm going to go ahead and copy Ryan's address. So this is just his wallet address that holds his comp tokens.
00:04:24.716 - 00:04:43.024, Speaker A: And then I'm going to go ahead and add that. There we go. And I'll click delegate votes. And it should be. I think it's just one metamask transaction. Guess we'll find out here. All right, and then let me just double check.
00:04:43.024 - 00:05:20.976, Speaker A: What is the gas price today? So I'm going to ethgastation info. I'm looking it up on my phone right now and looks like I need to put in a gas price of 30 gwe or more. So great, that works. 33. And there we go. And then once that confirms just it lets me know that in the future, whatever balance of comp tokens I have here, Ryan will then be able to use those to vote. Oh, and there we go.
00:05:20.976 - 00:06:04.412, Speaker A: It looks like it confirmed. Yep. All good to go. All right, we're all set. So I am in a place where what I'm able to earn the comp token because I am lending dai you can lend or borrow from any of the nine markets on compound all of my comp tokens will automatically accrue here in my voting wallet. And then I have the choice of collecting, withdrawing those once it hits 0.1. And for right now, I'm taking the pressure off myself to vote on any future compound protocol proposals.
00:06:04.412 - 00:06:16.460, Speaker A: And I'm allowing someone else, Ryan, to be able to use my comp tokens that I earn. So other than that, let me know if you have any questions. And I hope you find this helpful.
