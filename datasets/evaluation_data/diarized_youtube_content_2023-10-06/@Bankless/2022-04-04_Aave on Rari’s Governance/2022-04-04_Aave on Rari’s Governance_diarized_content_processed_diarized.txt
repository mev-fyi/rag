00:00:00.090 - 00:00:08.734, Speaker A: What do you think of approaches like Rari? Is that interesting for AAve or is that kind of counter to the premise of what the Aave protocol is trying to do?
00:00:08.772 - 00:00:52.700, Speaker B: No, I think it's quite fascinating what they're doing and I really appreciate it because essentially governance minimization is an important topic and it's something where many protocols can actually function without governance. For example, protocol like Uniswap could function without governance, but the governance can actually manage the treasury and there's a bunch of things that actually get all those community members together. So it makes sense there as well in terms of the permissionless listing. For example, you could basically create logic based on permissionless listing. But for example, you could bind it with, let's say token economics, different kinds of staking. My kind of like a challenge with the permissionless listing is that how do we ensure that kind of like a right people are using that, but that also kind of like a UX question.
