00:00:02.650 - 00:00:10.670, Speaker A: Hey, bankless nation. Welcome to bankless takes. This is where David and I just talk about maybe links. We saw articles, we read stuff. Just whatever's top of mind.
00:00:10.740 - 00:00:11.818, Speaker B: We read you tweets.
00:00:11.914 - 00:00:25.686, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a free form episode today, David. I think maybe the theme is wisdom in general, maybe like some investing wisdom, but also just like life wisdom. That sounds a little deep for a bankless podcast, but, you know, we get deep on here.
00:00:25.708 - 00:00:26.998, Speaker B: We've gone deep before. Yeah.
00:00:27.084 - 00:00:34.246, Speaker A: So there was a great twitter thread that we'll get into investing wisdom from Chris Berninsky. So we got to talk about that. What else we got?
00:00:34.268 - 00:00:52.186, Speaker B: Vitalik wrote an article on his blog titled the end of my childhood, which the title is already deep. Vitalik turned 30 years old. Happy birthday. Belated birthday, Vitalik. And he wrote a reflective article that touched on many different things, not even one thing in particular. Unpack that a little bit in our favorite part.
00:00:52.368 - 00:01:00.606, Speaker A: I want to hear your take on it because you recently turned 30, didn't you? 31. Okay. You got a year in Vitalik still.
00:01:00.628 - 00:01:03.718, Speaker B: But, like, he's got a net $250,000,000,000.
00:01:03.754 - 00:01:20.870, Speaker A: Network on me, though he's done some things. Also, I want to talk about restaking summer in particular. What's the price impact to ether? Ether the asset. So that's what's on slate for today. David, I think wisdom is a good place to start. I'm feeling reflective. So crazy story.
00:01:20.870 - 00:01:28.440, Speaker A: I know we're a little late to record this, but this morning there was a really bad car accident on my.
00:01:30.250 - 00:01:52.826, Speaker B: Picture. I got a message from Ryan. I've gotten messages like this from Ryan before where I actually don't know how to gauge the severity of it. You sent me a message one time, and it was like something bad just happened. It's like, serious. And then you go off and deal with unfaid things, and I'm just like, then you come back. Was it serious?
00:01:52.858 - 00:01:54.158, Speaker A: Do you remember what it was?
00:01:54.324 - 00:02:19.122, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, you didn't tell me what the nature of it was. And I thought when you finally come back online, like 3 hours later, I was like, wife, kids, how are they doing? And you're like, oh, nothing like that. I got a letter from the SEC about an old staking project that felt very, so bad, but holy hell, please specify. Ryan says, my friend was in a car accident. Like, I got to go help. I'm like, uh oh.
00:02:19.122 - 00:02:26.262, Speaker B: And then I get a picture of an upside down cart.
00:02:26.326 - 00:02:44.250, Speaker A: It was crazy. And the reason I can laugh about this is he's totally fine. But this was like a carpool that stops by my house every morning. I actually. David, though there was, like, ambulance and fire truck and all of this. It was just outside my house, the end of my street. I honestly, I thought it was one of my kids for a minute.
00:02:44.250 - 00:03:08.040, Speaker A: It was like a carpool full of kids. I didn't get into that detail. So I rushed out of the house and didn't know for a few minutes. Anyway, I'm in a reflective mood because, man, life happens so fast. This is just like going to this episode. If we're talking about wisdom, just like, go give somebody a hug that you love. Go call your mom, get her on the phone, because you never know.
00:03:08.040 - 00:03:25.454, Speaker A: Just shit happens in life and you can't predict it. And it's outside of all of your framework for analyzing the future. Things that you didn't anticipate happen can happen in an instant. So that's the mood I'm in this morning.
00:03:25.572 - 00:03:55.720, Speaker B: Yeah, I know you know this. Wait, but why? From Tim Urban. He says, like, hey, you have a limited amount of time left. How many books are you reading a year? Like, two books a year? Three books a year? How many years you got left? All right, you got, like, 40 years left. All right, you got 120 books you're going to read in the rest of your life. And then you're reading a shitty book. Maybe you should put that one down, right? And then it goes into, like, all right, how many times do you see your parents a year? Like, three times a year? Four times a year? All right, how many years you got left?
00:03:56.330 - 00:03:57.846, Speaker A: It's something like, people don't like it.
00:03:57.868 - 00:03:59.740, Speaker B: When I bring this up, but, no.
00:04:00.510 - 00:04:03.338, Speaker A: I guess we're talking about it all this morning.
00:04:03.504 - 00:04:05.290, Speaker B: This is not in the agenda.
00:04:06.190 - 00:04:23.246, Speaker A: He also says something to the effect of, like, if you have kids, the time from zero to 18, you will have spent something like 97% of all of your time with your kids during those years. And so after they're 18, after they're out of the house, you only have, like, 3% left.
00:04:23.348 - 00:04:32.830, Speaker B: Yeah, but that 3% is extra quality, though, because, like, a decent amount of the time in the 97%, you were, like, clean and poop out of their diapers.
00:04:32.910 - 00:04:33.540, Speaker A: Right.
00:04:33.910 - 00:04:38.102, Speaker B: You can trade that for deep conversations that happened in the last, like, 3%.
00:04:38.236 - 00:04:46.882, Speaker A: Absolutely. I know you've spent some good quality time with your mom recently, too. None of this is in the agenda.
00:04:46.946 - 00:05:00.374, Speaker B: Had never seen that corner of the world, and none of her friends or whenever she's talking about, like, hey, let's go traveling with my friends, they're like, you're up. Never did she would ever imagine herself, like, walking on a glacier in the very far south.
00:05:00.422 - 00:05:10.318, Speaker A: That's cool, man. Like, you just having a trip with your mom into adulthood, right? So there is quality time that can be spent and, yeah, that's really cool. You get to do that.
00:05:10.404 - 00:05:19.202, Speaker B: Anyway, the theme is now your job, Ryan, is to transition this conversation into the Chris Berniski thread that we're about to pull up.
00:05:19.256 - 00:05:46.326, Speaker A: Okay. Chris has some wisdom for us as well. I don't know if it's life advice or investing advice, but I think it applies to both. This is the first tweet, and Chris is probably. Chris Berninski is probably one of the people I go to most often when it comes to fundamentals, wisdom type of like a Charlie Munger type thing, but for crypto. Or imagine if Charlie didn't hate crypto. Rest in peace, Charlie and Warren Buffett.
00:05:46.326 - 00:06:06.754, Speaker A: It's these types of takes. He also got me crypto assets is one of the first books I read in going down the crypto rabbit hole. Chris, he wrote it. Anyway, he starts off this tweet thread like this. You are responsible for every investing decision you make. I'm going to repeat that. You are responsible for every investing decision you make.
00:06:06.754 - 00:06:44.946, Speaker A: If you blindly follow what other people say with no opinion or critical thinking of your own, you're playing a fool's game. Not only will you not hone your practice, but you'll likely lose money in the coming years. So that's how he starts this off, and then he goes on to make a general comment. I think about crypto Twitter, maybe, and some of the scenes and the culture that's entered here recently. He says, I see an increasing amount of misinterpretation in my replies. That's his Twitter replies and many longtime crypto Twitter personalities showing signs of exhaustion, which tells me there's a new crop of culture zeters. He says, xers, ex eaters.
00:06:44.946 - 00:07:01.860, Speaker A: I don't know what that is amongst us. And he says this. A lot of the misinterpretation comes from not accepting what you are responsible for or misunderstanding the high level lay of the land. Start with, the less entitled you are, the more you'll learn. What are your thoughts on this?
00:07:02.390 - 00:07:41.360, Speaker B: There's a line that has been burned into my brain. I can't remember where it came from, but it's about copy trading, basically, where there is some person publishing their trades and like, hey, here's what I'm doing. And this is like, common practice for traders to do. It's like social media for traders. Like, here's my trade, here's what I'm doing. You can copy someone's trade, but you can never copy their conviction. So two people can try to attempt the same strategy in investing, but if one person was their original idea that they decided to come to a conclusion to based on evidence and analysis, and that was theirs versus somebody else who's like, oh, I think that's a good idea, and they just copy them.
00:07:41.360 - 00:07:51.858, Speaker B: You're kind of becoming a weather vein. You're a leaf in the wind. You're going to see somebody else's trade and be like, oh, that's also a good idea. Let me just copy that trade, too. But those two things conflict, and it.
00:07:51.864 - 00:08:06.120, Speaker A: Will be generally after they've been successful. So it's like after it's worked and you're kind of like looking at that and you're sort of buying the top of the after it's worked, you weren't looking at them when they were contrarian, right. And it looked like they didn't know what they were talking.
00:08:07.550 - 00:08:55.926, Speaker B: So generally, Chris is just asking people to reflect and consider just critical thinking and independent thought, which is something that I think very, just massively is lacking, especially in crypto, probably all financial markets. I bet you this is a thing across all markets, but especially with crypto, where people who make a lot of money get turned into deities by the average person on crypto, Twitter. And people just want to live in their draft, for example. So this is a rampant behavior where people are just using other people and trying to copy their lifestyle, copy their investment strategy, just copy them. And Chris is asking, hey, you can copy them, but that's on you. If that's your strategy to copy others, that's on you.
00:08:56.028 - 00:10:05.070, Speaker A: Well, I think he's also saying here is just like, back to that r word of responsibility, right? And so you are accountable for your own investments. You have to kind of own that, right? It's like you press the buy button, you failed to press the sell button. And I think that's just a good life principle for investing. But just like anything, right, specifically, markets are great at figuring out what's true, and they will tell you over time whether you are right or wrong. And it's important when you get the signals of you being wrong that you are self reflective about that. You own up to it because that's how you become a better investor in this space. You go back through, you do a retrospective and you're like, where did I mess up? Was this a psychological fault? Was it a fault in my understanding of the project? Was I maybe copy trading, to your point, David, was I copy trading someone else or following some youtuber trying to mirror their success rather than doing my own thing? And so the very first step, I think, in a investor journey and crypto investor journey is like, own your actions.
00:10:05.070 - 00:10:22.782, Speaker A: Right. And by the way, you're not entitled to the upside. You got to work for it, and it's not necessarily going to come overnight. Right. Like, it could take a lot of time in the market to meet your goals. He also says this. Know which assets, style, and time frames you are choosing.
00:10:22.782 - 00:10:29.142, Speaker A: You know, that thing we say so often, david, is when you come into crypto, you got to pick your character class 100%. What do we mean by that?
00:10:29.276 - 00:10:48.846, Speaker B: Yeah. So I came into crypto in 2017, which was my meme coin era. People ping me with meme coins all the time. I'm like, that's just not about that life. This is when I was. You already did that trade. This is when I was, like, pressing the buy and sell button on the same assets inside of the same week on finance in 2017.
00:10:48.846 - 00:11:00.926, Speaker B: And this is just because I think everyone kind of enters this crypto world, and they think that the charts and trading and speculation, and that's definitely what I did in 2017. I got that game.
00:11:01.028 - 00:11:02.458, Speaker A: You think that's what everyone's doing.
00:11:02.564 - 00:11:39.290, Speaker B: Yeah. And so everyone dabbles with the charter trader character class because that's the beginner character class. And then it wasn't until the bear market, when I still had so many more questions that I was like, well, there are other ways to navigate crypto, and also, I'm here for the long term, and so I need to find a different strategy because that didn't work. That one did not work. And so different character classes emerge, especially if you're just going to be in crypto. You can't just trade all the time unless you're a trader. But there's other ways to fill your time.
00:11:39.290 - 00:12:06.722, Speaker B: There are the tweet influencer character classes. There are the research character class. There is the content producer character class. There is the investor character class. And I think part of what Chris is saying here is like, yo, I wrote this book called Crypto Assets in 2016, and it was about me and my journey in developing my investing strategy as it relates to crypto assets. Hence why I'm writing this book called Crypto Assets. And so he identifies his character class in this tweet.
00:12:06.722 - 00:12:17.762, Speaker B: I'm a crypto assets focused long only long term investor, three to seven year time horizons. I handle both public market positions and venture investments that turn liquid.
00:12:17.906 - 00:12:19.898, Speaker A: He knows exactly who he is.
00:12:19.984 - 00:12:53.618, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah. And so I think you and me, Ryan, we came together because our investing strategies line up pretty damn well. We want to deeply identify why crypto assets are priced and valued the way that they are from a variety of different angles. And think about them in, I think, the longest of terms. Bankless has always been bankless. The podcast has always been like a truth seeking endeavor because we want to make hypotheses theses about the way that the crypto world will look in 100 years.
00:12:53.618 - 00:13:36.606, Speaker B: How will it end up? What are the converging basins of attraction that will imply our investments now? And this is our strategy. And I think there's been, everyone gives everyone else flak in this industry for having a particular strategy. And I think there is a certain subset of people who have different time frames mainly, and perhaps also different ways of valuing things that these conflict. And so a lot of arguments that happen in crypto are very frequently about time frames. And I think you and I have developed a strategy that's about trying to discover the deepest fundamentals in the longest term time frames. And then we've made a media company around this, and that's what we would call bankless, and that is our strategy.
00:13:36.718 - 00:14:20.846, Speaker A: I think that's also important when people are choosing their character classes to just follow those sources that will benefit their character class, right? So Chris says this. Know your sources, their role in the industry, their credibility, ideally across multiple cycles, the asset styles and timeframes of any investor you follow. If you are an investor, like character class, and you're kind of long term buy and hold, and your goal is to increase your crypto denominated wealth, right? And by that, I mean, like, whatever your unit of denomination is for your portfolio. For me personally, it's ether. That's my money. Yeah, that's my money. And so I'm trying to like, how much wealth do I have as denominated in units of ether, right.
00:14:20.846 - 00:14:36.674, Speaker A: That's literally what I'm doing. But if I was consuming content from a crypto trader, that is just kind of like trading the bitcoin eth ratio, and that's in my brain, and I think I'm probably going to the wrong source of content for my character class.
00:14:36.792 - 00:14:42.118, Speaker B: Do you remember what Arthur Hayes, we asked this question, Arthur Hayes, what do you denominate in? Do you remember what he said?
00:14:42.284 - 00:14:47.430, Speaker A: Didn't he say, like he would do tins, like cans of oil if he could strap it to a belt.
00:14:48.010 - 00:15:02.982, Speaker B: He said hydrocarbons. I denominate in energy, which is a very interesting perspective. And 99.9% of the people that follow Arthur are not thinking like that. Most people just like, I denominate in dollars. Bitcoin, eth, Salana.
00:15:03.046 - 00:15:38.166, Speaker A: Arthur knows his character class, so he knows what he denominates in. And by the way, he knows his strategy for increasing his denomination, increasing his hydrocarbons, which is he's trading and he's trading not on the week by week cycle, but if you ask him or talk to him, it's like months, it's like three to nine month types of trends. He's got his character class absolutely nailed down. Chris has some other takes here. Chance favors the prepared mind, but there's still amount of chance involved. Chance never favors you forever. Right? You can get lucky some of the time, but you're not going to get lucky all of the time.
00:15:38.166 - 00:15:46.250, Speaker A: In crypto, he goes on, all idols are false. Something we were saying earlier. Form your own opinions. Don't try to mimic your idols.
00:15:46.670 - 00:16:08.500, Speaker B: Following a hero in crypto is dangerous. And this is the same thing with copy traders. There's a bunch of traders out there who play the influencer game, and they very much enjoy when people follow their trades, because that also makes their trades more lucrative. And if some people can make money, that's why some people just glorify these people.
00:16:09.750 - 00:16:13.518, Speaker A: We had a lot of bad idols last cycle, didn't we? 2021 idols.
00:16:13.534 - 00:17:01.006, Speaker B: I think we always have bad idols, and I think this is what Chris was saying. I think higher up in the thread where he just says, just like, know your sources, also with character, especially for people who go through one cycle that he highlights. People morph character classes, sadly, in crypto, and you can be one strategy, one character class on the way up, and a different character class on the way down, and you can be shifting around depending on the nature of the game. And fine, that's fine. But if you are somebody who's looking towards these people as leadership, you need to be aware that their strategy changes. How they get value and how they make their trades can also change. Sometimes it's more beneficial to identify the people who are not changing their strategies across cycles.
00:17:01.118 - 00:17:22.426, Speaker A: Agreed. And people change. Right. And to your point, their styles change over time. Have you ever heard naval's framing of this, where he's like, early in your life, you want to be a mercenary, and kind of later, once you've made it, you become a missionary, and then later in your life, once you've done that, you become an. So he's like, mercenary, missionary, and then artist. Right.
00:17:22.426 - 00:18:05.846, Speaker A: I think I've seen many people in crypto sort of follow that trajectory where at first they're like, mercenary. They're just like, okay, but I want to get faster than you, right. And then they move into kind of a missionary where they're part mercenary still. They're still trying to make a profit, but they have a legal. Yeah, I would say I'm part missionary now, and the missionary has grown over time for me in my crypto journey, and the mercenary has shrunk a little bit, and then I could see the artist thing on the horizon. By the way, this gets to Vitalik's post, where I think for Vitalik, it's actually like he skipped all that. It's mercenary, missionary, and monk, and he just went all the way to monk face.
00:18:06.028 - 00:18:09.366, Speaker B: Well, he. Vitalik has lived a very sped up life.
00:18:09.468 - 00:18:22.638, Speaker A: Yes, he has, man. Anyway, we'll get to that in just a second, David, but first I want to talk to you about something less deep, but something that is on the near term horizon, and that is restaking. And I know you're doing.
00:18:22.724 - 00:18:47.554, Speaker B: As we turn to restaking, can we also place this about our strategy as content producer investors? Let's try and do that. I think restaking and Eigen layer has resonated with you and me for a particular reason, and I think it's because it fits in our understanding of crypto networks, where crypto networks are going, and it is resonant with our strategy, why we are excited about it.
00:18:47.592 - 00:19:12.870, Speaker A: Yeah, there's two parts to this. For me, anyway. I'd love to hear what you say about it. It's like one long standing thesis that out of crypto will emerge monetary instruments like stores of value, through which you can and probably should denominate your wealth in a bankless way. Right outside of the existing fiat central bank system, we've created this new store of value, this new money. Right. And there have been some long standing contenders to where that money can emerge.
00:19:12.870 - 00:19:18.842, Speaker A: Bitcoin has been in the fray. Bankless has long argued that ethereum is in the fray and should be in the fray.
00:19:18.906 - 00:19:21.150, Speaker B: And I think we've been on well accepted by now.
00:19:21.220 - 00:19:59.558, Speaker A: Yeah, we've been on kind of like the writer side of that argument. It's not fully fledged, but ether has become more money over the past three years, since we started the bankless podcast and kind of, like, dove into the space and so the interest for me in restaking is one. This establishes ether as a monetary instrument even more, and so makes me even more excited to denominate my wealth. But then there's also, like, again, the mercenary side, the trader side. There's a lot of value being created in the restaking economy through, like, eigen layer and all of these restaking protocols. And that is shorter term. That is like DeFi Summer.
00:19:59.558 - 00:20:23.378, Speaker A: You see this kind of emerge. It's going to emerge in speculative frenzy, but there's opportunity in that speculative frenzy, and we're also going to create something that I think is going to be much more lasting than just kind of like the bull bus cycle of the speculative frenzy. So there's both a long term play and there's a short term play here that I see. Yeah. How does that reflect how you think about this?
00:20:23.544 - 00:20:36.630, Speaker B: I think it aligns with the concept of smart contracts on Ethereum, which, I mean, let's go back to 2015 was a revolutionary concept. Like, smart contracts are no longer a revolutionary concept, but that's because ether popularized them.
00:20:36.780 - 00:20:38.522, Speaker A: Do you mean like programmable money?
00:20:38.656 - 00:21:17.590, Speaker B: Programmable money, yeah. And so we have crypto networks with native assets, and then we have smart contracts and Turing complete languages like solidity. Those two particles come together, and boom, we have programmable money and Eigen layer and restaking is a continuation of those two particles being smashed together back in 2015. So it's a return to a very core principle of why there was this original brain drain from bitcoin into ethereum in the first place, where it's like, people just thought, oh, it's bitcoin, but it's programmable. It's bitcoin with programmable money. Bitcoin is digital gold. ETH is programmable money.
00:21:17.590 - 00:21:28.866, Speaker B: And now Eigen layer is taking programmable money and using that to create new crypto economic networks that do new things that are completely adjacent from a blockchain.
00:21:28.978 - 00:21:30.322, Speaker A: But are still crypto.
00:21:30.386 - 00:21:34.058, Speaker B: And that's kind of the exciting new thing that I think is getting a lot of people's imaginations going.
00:21:34.144 - 00:21:52.474, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. And I know you're doing an episode about kind of the shorter term or this kind of new ecosystem that's springing up with restaking protocols. Right. You're doing, like, a speed dating episode. Where are you, like, interviewing? I don't know, five or so of the teams and giving them, like, 15 minutes. Give me your pitch type. Is that the episode format?
00:21:52.602 - 00:22:20.066, Speaker B: Might be six. So maybe just to really just place this into context, we have Ethy asset and the very center of a set of concentric circles. It is programmable money. Then we have liquid staked ETH, right? The LST tokens, the staked ETH from Lido, our ETH from rocket pool. That is the next concentric circle out with Eigen layer. We are going one more concentric circle out, which is liquid restaked ETH. Liquid restaked tokens, lrts.
00:22:20.066 - 00:22:46.566, Speaker B: And this is brand new. And so there are so many teams going after this. I think really there's six that represent over 95% of all of the TVL and liquid resaking tokens. So I'm doing a speed dating episode so we can get to know all of these projects. And so like 15 minutes or less for every single project, one by one by one. And so that episode recording most of those this week, and then we'll be finished recording next week. And then hopefully it'll out around Eember.
00:22:46.698 - 00:23:37.122, Speaker A: Okay, so what I want to talk about is maybe the bigger picture vision here of why is restaking good for ether? And so, in what you just said, right, you said there's ETH and there's staked ETH and there's restaked ETh. I think one analog, if you're looking at this through a monetary lens, is like, let's say you take fiat. Let's say you take the dollar, okay? That is similar to ether. Now, let's say you put that dollar in a bond, right? So you lend it back to the protocol, you lend it back to the US government. Well, it becomes a treasury, a t bill, and you earn some yield that is equivalent to staked ether. All right? So you've got the dollar, and then you wrap it inside of a T bill, a treasury, and then it becomes the staked dollar, okay? And then if you use that staked dollar in some sort of form, you can kind of create and use the economic security of the nation state. You can kind of create a different bond market.
00:23:37.122 - 00:24:12.570, Speaker A: That is the corporate bond market. And that's kind of what I see with restaking is it's like a form of corporate bond market for all of these apps that are being built on top of Ethereum, these Avss that are using the economic security of Ethereum. So I think we're starting to frame out the next frontier. We've talked about ether so much on bankless as sort of a different form of monetary unit versus fiat. And then we got really excited and we started talking about staked ether, right? That's the next phase. Now we're in the kind of the corporate bond market. That's kind of how I see things.
00:24:12.570 - 00:24:15.070, Speaker A: I don't know if that resonates with you 100%.
00:24:15.220 - 00:24:56.490, Speaker B: The main difference is that when you have a dollar and then you turn it into a treasury, you can't also turn it into a corporate bond world of Ethereum. You actually have to turn it into a treasury in order to turn it into a corporate bond. So we have the yield of corporate bonds being stacked on top of the treasuries. One of the big bullish things about crypto is just the instances in singularity, if you will, that I see. It's just like what was separate and disparate in trad markets is now the same and synergistic in crypto worlds. Things just like are more harmonious, more stacked on top, more synergistic in the crypto world. And this is an example of those.
00:24:56.490 - 00:25:26.754, Speaker B: We can do more of the same things at the same time. Very frequently. Capital is just so much more efficient in crypto, and this is exactly illustrating that exact point. So we have corporate bond markets, which is just like in the trad world, corporate bond markets is just like Tesla or Amazon saying, hey, I need a loan and I'll pay 6%, and then the market will come and fulfill that order. And that is usually higher than like a treasury market, where the treasury market is giving like 4%, which is the incentive it has to.
00:25:26.792 - 00:25:38.440, Speaker A: It has to be higher because the cost of capital, or the zero risk form of capital is actually treasuries. So corporate bonds always sort of have to, because they imply greater risk of.
00:25:38.890 - 00:25:51.278, Speaker B: Tesla could default, but it's assumed that the United States will never default because we have the money printer. They have the money printer, and so they'll just, oh, we don't have enough money. Oh, boom, we just made more money, right? Tesla can't do that.
00:25:51.364 - 00:26:00.750, Speaker A: The US will never default nominally, right? It could default in terms of real returns. Gotcha on a technicality.
00:26:01.970 - 00:26:32.540, Speaker B: Okay. So there's always higher yields for the corporate bond market. This is actually different in the ethereum context, where the yields being added on to Ethereum, ether resaking, are actually quite marginal. They're quite nominal, which is actually the point, which is why cosmos validators who have to find their own security, share their own security, have to actually pay a lot. But when you can aggregate these things together, you can get a very comparable level of security for much.
00:26:33.150 - 00:26:52.698, Speaker A: We do that. Tradfi does that, David, in that they'll group a whole bunch of bonds together and they'll give them a rating, and you could buy a mutual fund of kind of like a class of bonds, basically. Well, they'll just smush a whole bunch of the corporate bonds into kind of like one unit that you can purchase.
00:26:52.794 - 00:27:20.314, Speaker B: Yeah, but that's actually not what I was referring to. Okay. With restaking, one dollars of capital can be applied to turn into $7 of security for seven different networks. But with what you were just saying, like, $1 of capital is one dollars of capital. It's just, like, being aggregated across all these bonds. And so all of these different corporate bonds that are using corporate networks, avs networks, we need to stop calling them corporate networks. They can all actually become more efficient with their security spend.
00:27:20.314 - 00:27:32.918, Speaker B: So they get to secure their protocol for marginal amounts of spend, security spend. But then it all aggregates together into a shared commons of security, which is the restaking markets.
00:27:33.014 - 00:28:15.130, Speaker A: So the question I think that maybe people are listening to, who owns some ether? Is. Is restaking going to be good for the price of ether, the fiat, denominated price of ether? And I want to maybe give a take on that. And I'd love your thoughts on this, David. So one is, we're looking at a chart of the amount of ETH that staked over time since basically, this functionality was launched. So back in 2021, it has been basically up only in terms of the amount of ETH actually staked, because there's raw eth, of course, and there's ETH that you can stake. And here's a chart that just shows kind of the trajectory. And as I said, it's just kind of up only.
00:28:15.130 - 00:29:05.914, Speaker A: So the total amount of ether staked is almost 30 million right now, which is, what is that, like 25% of the network? It's mid 20s, something like that, in terms of percent of the network. And so one, I think, obvious thing that we'll see is there will be increased demand for staking ETh. Why? Because you get some additional yield on top of it. Because there's more reward for staking ETH. And I guess the question is, how does that reflect in terms of price? Or what does that do to the unit of ether? And I guess I have a few things I think it does. So, number one, unit of value. This is even more of a reason to denominate in ether, because now your unit of account.
00:29:05.952 - 00:29:06.554, Speaker B: Not unit value.
00:29:06.592 - 00:29:39.894, Speaker A: Unit of account. Yeah, unit of account. Now your ether becomes like an asset that you can use, not just to purchase gas, not just to watch it go up in fiat terms, but it becomes an asset that you can use to generate yield in other places of the market. Right? So for me, as a holder of ETH, it makes me even more attractive to hold it. And you compare that to, say, dollars. There's a lot of utility for dollars out there. But the nice thing about ether, of course, is it generates yield, and we know what the supply schedule looks like.
00:29:39.894 - 00:30:28.870, Speaker A: Right? So it's attractive from that perspective. I also think it creates additional monetary value, monetary premium for ether, the asset, because this use case really establishes ether as a collateral, as like a bond. Not just a bond for its own internal network, but a bond for an entire economy of applications that are built on top of it. And I think what that does is it creates some narrative value. So this meme that we've talked about, I think the very beginning of a bankless, of ether as an Internet bond, sort of starts to really reinforce that narrative value proposition. And that creates like a liquidity flywheel. So recall one definition, great definition of money from the Austrians, is that it's the most saleable good.
00:30:28.870 - 00:30:32.600, Speaker A: And what that means is it's the most liquid good. Right.
00:30:33.370 - 00:30:38.178, Speaker B: No matter the time, no matter the place, the depth of the market is extremely deep.
00:30:38.274 - 00:31:04.974, Speaker A: Yeah. So you could sell, like hundreds of millions of dollars and a very liquid market would not move the price. And so that is one definition of money. And I think it's probably the truest definition of money in an asset test. So this liquidity flywheel means there will be more places to buy and sell ether. It expands in terms of market cap, and it becomes a more saleable good. And then we also have all of these yield products that are built on top of this.
00:31:04.974 - 00:31:22.226, Speaker A: And I think that narrative, probably in a year or two's time, will start to take over tradfi, where they start to see ether not just as a productive asset being staked, but it's a productive asset for this whole, like, we'll call it the corporate bond economy, essentially inside of Ethereum. And so that will have to double.
00:31:22.258 - 00:31:44.240, Speaker B: Down on that point. Not just is ether a productive asset natively inside of Ethereum. Cool crypto bros, you guys figured out that's a cool, insular economy, but they will also see eth being a productive asset that's expanding beyond its own internal ethereum network. So the asset itself is being productive for non native use cases, which we are calling abs.
00:31:45.090 - 00:32:31.594, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. And that's sort of what I like about this, is because where do these yields ultimately come from in restaking? Well, there has to be some valuable abs applications that are built on top of restaking Eigen layer. But to the extent that's true, it becomes a crypto specific economy source of yield for ether, right? That is sort of outside of tradfi's existing apparatus. It's not like a mortgage, it's not like a corporate bond or some other source of yield. It's like internal to the crypto economy. And so that's cool. And lastly, what I would say is it's a pretty strong moat for ether as a monetary unit, right? So bitcoin is not being used in this way.
00:32:31.594 - 00:32:34.058, Speaker A: I think there are attempts to try to make bitcoin.
00:32:34.154 - 00:32:43.890, Speaker B: Yeah. The Eigen layer equivalent for bitcoin is called babylon. But whether or not there is actually product market fit is yet to be discovered, right?
00:32:43.960 - 00:33:03.062, Speaker A: And because bitcoin is not as expressive as ethereum, it's just much harder to kind of draw that out in a trustless way. And then you look at alternative layer ones, right? And they're not being used in this way as a money. So it kind of establishes ether, even.
00:33:03.196 - 00:33:09.400, Speaker B: Pretty high market cap. But it went down today, and I'm sorry, you can't restake on a network that goes down, right?
00:33:09.710 - 00:33:31.082, Speaker A: So eth as programmable money as kind of a mode. So all that said, I think it's, look, restaking, this is why we're excited about it from a long time horizon perspective, is because it really establishes, maybe cements the monetary value proposition of ether as an asset, as a bond for applications on the Internet.
00:33:31.146 - 00:34:13.390, Speaker B: So at the time of recording, there's 1.72 million ether deposited into eigen layer. Almost 600,000 of that is natively restaked, which is just like raw vanilla ether going straight into Eigen layer. But inside of that natively restaked is also some LRT competitors. So we have liquid restaking, which is taking your rocket pool ether, your swell staked ether, your lido staked ether, and you're just depositing it into eigen layer. And then there's native restaking, which is where many of the lrts are competing, which is they're taking your ether, they're creating an eigen layer, a node on the Ethereum, layer one, and validating node on the ethereum, layer one. And then hooking that into the eigen layer contracts for native restaking.
00:34:13.390 - 00:34:21.546, Speaker B: So 1.7 million ether. And then the liquid restaking wars are probably one of the hottest things in Ethereum.
00:34:21.658 - 00:34:30.386, Speaker A: Do you have a prediction? How big do you think this is going to grow if we're at 1.7 right now. You think we get to 5 million? Think we get to ten. And, like, you know, one of my.
00:34:30.408 - 00:34:44.438, Speaker B: Predictions for 2024, one of them came right today. I think you can know which one it was. The second one I have is that $10 billion gets put inside of eigen layer in 2024.
00:34:44.524 - 00:34:48.040, Speaker A: $10 billion. Now, ETh denominate that.
00:34:48.970 - 00:35:08.446, Speaker B: Well, it depends on the e, but we are at 2 billion, I think 1.7 billion. Let me actually do the actual real math on that with my calculator, because bankless nation knows why I'm terrible at math. 1.7 million times 2300, is that where we're at? Which comes to $3.9 billion. I made this prediction below $1 billion.
00:35:08.628 - 00:35:09.118, Speaker A: Yes.
00:35:09.204 - 00:35:10.942, Speaker B: So we're well on our way there.
00:35:10.996 - 00:35:19.282, Speaker A: Well, actually, the problem with your prediction might be like, you weigh under predicted here. I think we could get well past.
00:35:19.416 - 00:35:29.894, Speaker B: Yeah, but I want to go for five for five this year. I've got one. The other one is $5 billion gets airdropped to users in 2024. That one's. Come on.
00:35:29.932 - 00:35:34.310, Speaker A: That's going to happen. We're probably already like, two or 3 billion in right now.
00:35:34.380 - 00:36:03.786, Speaker B: Yeah, I can't remember what the other two were. We'll pull that up later when I get five for five this year anyways. Okay, so $4 billion in Eigen layer. 1.7 million ether. The early ethereum predictions from the protocol devs, the Justin Drake Satan, Tim Baco's, Danny Ryan's of the world were like, yeah, the equilibrium will be 20 to 30 million ether native, like, just staked and validating the chain. That would give us a minimum threshold of security that would make us feel comfortable.
00:36:03.786 - 00:36:45.374, Speaker B: And right now we are at 29 million. So we're at the upper end of that prediction. But that prediction was before lsts were a big deal and way before Eigen layer was even a thing. If you look at other proof of stake networks, all of the cosmos chains, Salana included, their stake rate of how much their native asset is staked to the network is around like 60% to 70%. Why are these variables so different? All other proof of stake networks are starting at a very high stake rate and actually trying to get theirs lower, whereas Ethereum started at zero and has trying to get its higher. Now, Ethereum is currently fine. It doesn't matter if it goes up or down, but it's going to go up, and I'll get there in a second.
00:36:45.374 - 00:37:22.700, Speaker B: Whereas other networks started off with delegated proof of stake, started off with not very robust defi ecosystems. There's not really a reason to not stake. Therefore, everyone wants the inflation. And so with eigenlayer and the increasing yields that all avs networks will place into restaked ETH, the incentive to stake ETH will go up and up and up. And so all of a sudden, the new predictions around the percentage of ETH staked I've seen from go like, I haven't even heard of predictions specifically from the EF folk, but just from other people in the space, like Micah Belito. He thinks it's going to approach like 60%.
00:37:23.070 - 00:38:10.706, Speaker A: That's interesting. This is a whole nother episode. I don't know that it'll get that high, because I think if we get into ETH monetary economics, there's an asymptote where you get to a certain point in time and the yield, at least from raw staking ETH, ignore the lsts and the additional yield juice on that starts to go down. And so this is kind of like an ETH monetary policy type of decision. It's like a mechanism design of what's in the best interest of the network. Do we actually want like 50, 60, 70% of ETH staked or not? And I think the answer is, I think we don't want that for network latency reasons, other reasons. But this is a good question we should ask some core devs ETH researchers.
00:38:10.706 - 00:38:12.546, Speaker A: It's a Justin Drake type question.
00:38:12.668 - 00:38:34.202, Speaker B: Well, we are doing an update to the Ethereum roadmap episode with Mike Norder and Dom on Friday, so I think we'll just have that included in the episode. Yeah, the networking issue gets fixed with the EiP max effective balance, who Mike Norder, one of the guests on the podcast, is actually championing. Apparently it's not getting pushed through to Electra, which is a big bummer, but we can talk about that in the episode.
00:38:34.266 - 00:38:37.998, Speaker A: There we go. David, do you want to get to Vitalik's post? End of my childhood.

Mantle, formerly known as Bitdao, is the first dowled web3 ecosystem, all built on top of mantle's first core product, the mantle Network, a brand new high performance Ethereum L2, built using the op stack, but uses Eigen layer's data availability solution instead of the expensive Ethereum layer one. Not only does this reduce Mantle network's gas fees by 80%, but it also reduces gas fee volatility, providing a more stable foundation for Mantle's applications. The Mantle treasury is one of the biggest dow owned treasuries, which is seeding an ecosystem of projects from all around the web3 space for Mantle Mantle already has subcommunities from around web3 onboarded like game seven for web3 gaming and buybit for TDL and liquidity and onramp. So if you want to build on the Mantle network, Mantle is offering a grants program that provides milestone based funding to promising projects that help expand, secure, and decentralize Mantle.

00:41:30.710 - 00:41:41.066, Speaker A: The end of my childhood this was a blog post from Vitalik. I don't miss anything this guy writes. I don't know if you know Vitalik, David. Why would he really?
00:41:41.168 - 00:41:43.980, Speaker B: I know him more than he. I've actually met him.
00:41:44.510 - 00:42:30.714, Speaker A: He's just turned 30 and he's someone that I've long looked up to in this industry. He's not one of the main characters who has been kind of like eliminated from the script. He's got some durability and we've had enough conversations with Vitalik. Yeah, I feel like I know the human being and from reading his writings, good person. And I think the overall vibe of this article that he wrote was like, vitalik's going like kind of pure monk era here, right? And so he's talking about how he doesn't want to be the only leader of Ethereum and how more people are stepping up and how that is so great to see because he's basically not always going to be as plugged in as he is now.
00:42:30.832 - 00:42:31.500, Speaker B: Right?
00:42:31.870 - 00:42:54.290, Speaker A: But this was all about dropping wisdom. And one reflection I had is I can't wait to have an interview, a conversation or hear an interview with Vitalik in his 40s because he's aging very well, I would say, in terms of wisdom per unit of year. And that was really reflected in this article. How did this hit you?
00:42:54.360 - 00:43:31.230, Speaker B: The first thing I noticed about this article is it was just structured differently than previous normal Vitalik articles. It's a little more prozy. It's a little bit more, oh, I'm a story time. This is for story time. He titles the sections 1234 rather than just like, here's this one is about stealth addresses or whatever. It's a little bit like writing for writing's sake, which I think that was the first thing that stood out to me. I sent this article, actually to my mom after she forwarded me a message, or not even forwarded me, just sent me the message.
00:43:31.230 - 00:43:37.758, Speaker B: Like, I just read about bitboy in the New York Times and like, oh, I'm just so disgusted. Like terrible.
00:43:37.934 - 00:43:41.602, Speaker A: I think it was. I saw this I saw this art, it was like, from the New York Post.
00:43:41.736 - 00:43:42.754, Speaker B: New York Post, yeah.
00:43:42.792 - 00:43:48.280, Speaker A: And it basically was like, look at this crypto scammer grifter, right?
00:43:50.090 - 00:44:13.914, Speaker B: With the air of like, this is what crypto is. It's bitboy 100% right and perfect product market fit for its readers who definitely want their dose of crypto schrodingfreud, which is like what I sent my mom. And she's like, I totally understand that. And then I sent my mom this article from Vitalik, and she was like, oh my God, that was so beautiful. Like such a fantastic cleanse. Like, what an incredible. This is.
00:44:13.914 - 00:44:19.520, Speaker B: This is my side of crypto. This is the preferred side of crypto. This is what I see when I see crypto completely.
00:44:19.970 - 00:44:31.186, Speaker A: One of the images he captured in the article was this. It was a Chat GPT prompt, and he asked for some prompt for show me bitcoin. And then you said, show me ethereum. And he kind of juxtaposes the two.
00:44:31.208 - 00:44:40.662, Speaker B: Well, no, not just that. Show me bitcoin now. Make it 1000 times more. Turn the Ethereum up to eleven and show me what that looks like.
00:44:40.716 - 00:44:50.310, Speaker A: And for people who can't see this in the podcast, bitcoin is kind of like very much gold types of tones, sort of like these browns and yellows that you find.
00:44:50.380 - 00:44:58.762, Speaker B: It's very gilded with a big guy wearing a crown and some sun on a throne with big old bitcoin necklace scepter, right?
00:44:58.816 - 00:45:15.790, Speaker A: And there's all the kind of the unit of bitcoin around. And then you move to the Ethereum. Yes, the same question now make it 100 x more ethereum and Chat GPT really captured the vibe of these two cultures. So ethereum is much more like, I would say like tron style, like futuristic.
00:45:16.450 - 00:45:26.382, Speaker B: Tron blockchain, video game movie. When I first saw this image of the Ethereum image, I was like, oh, that's Carl Forsch.
00:45:26.526 - 00:45:35.682, Speaker A: Oh, really? Looks a little bit like Carl mixed with Vitalik. To me. It's kind of like futuristic. These purple hues, these neon type colors.
00:45:35.826 - 00:45:38.338, Speaker B: Purple, blue hues, actually, ironically, solana colors.
00:45:38.434 - 00:46:14.766, Speaker A: Yeah. So one thing that we can kind of capture from this is a difference between bitcoiner and ethereum culture. Another thing that struck me in this post was somehow hemanders to this conversation about how we get there in crypto. And he put together a diagram that I've not seen somewhere else about these four different kind of subtribes within crypto. And so we've got the token holders and the defi users. As one group, we've got the application builders. As another group, we've got the pragmatic users.
00:46:14.766 - 00:46:38.966, Speaker A: These are different than the DeFi users who are doing the speculation and the token hold, not the investors. Pragmatic users are just like, we call that adoption. Yeah, adoption. Like real world use cases. This is people in Argentina using it as a stablecoin to kind of like get by and denominate their wealth and that sort of thing. And you've got the intellectuals who are like the researchers, kind of the protocol devs. And he paints this picture of how they all interact.
00:46:38.966 - 00:47:24.938, Speaker A: And all of these tribes kind of have different goals and different identities. And he says the token holders and DeFi users contribute greatly to financing the whole thing. That's their value proposition to the network, which has been key to getting technologies like consensus algos and zero knowledge proofs to production. Intellectuals provide the ideas to make sure that the space is actually doing something meaningful. The builders bridge the gap and try to build applications that serve users and put their ideas into practice. And the pragmatic users are the people we are all ultimately serving. So some wisdom here, and I definitely see that in kind of like the tribes and sometimes the intellectuals don't understand what in the world the token holders and defi users are doing, right.
00:47:24.938 - 00:47:52.802, Speaker A: Sometimes the builders don't fully understand. The builders are most connected, I would say, to these three groups. And sometimes the token holders and Defi users are just like dgens, all about the next thing where they can get some return and they don't see the bigger picture. Anyway, it's been interesting very much to observe the interplay between all of these sub communities within crypto, and they all help one another. They all have different goals as well.
00:47:52.856 - 00:48:38.334, Speaker B: I think the part of the article that stands out to me the most, and there's so much depth to this article, and we are just skimming our favorite parts off the surface. And so what we are doing is not at all in supposed to replace actually reading the article. We're just talking about, I think parts that stood out to us. It's one passage that I'll read is the one that stood out to me the most. And Vitalik writes, but how beyond stories do we make this happen? This being like adding decentralization and crypto values to the world? Here we get back to some of the issues that I raised in my post from three years ago. The changing nature of motivation. Often people with an overly financed, focused theory of motivation, or at least a theory of motivation within which financial motives can be understood and analyzed, and everything else is treated as that mysterious black box we call culture.
00:48:38.334 - 00:49:23.802, Speaker B: Are confused by this space because there are a lot of behaviors that seem to go against financial motives. Quote, users don't care about decentralization, and yet projects still often try hard to decentralize. Quote, consensus runs on game theory, and yet successful social campaigns to chase people off the dominant mining or staking pool have worked in bitcoin and in ethereum. I think the punchline of this short little passage is that there are other forces at work, hidden forces at work, that are steering the ship of crypto that are not just financial motivations. Like, there is a very strong culture of decentralization that has permeated in crypto from day one. You can see that in the rocket pool community. You can see that in anyone who's chanting, get off, guest.
00:49:23.802 - 00:50:07.034, Speaker B: You can see that in the bitcoiners who, for better or for worse, have turned into this weird bit of just religious zealots about BTC, the asset. We have motivations that are beyond just natural financial motivations. The thing that's nerd sniped me about crypto is, like, this relationship between code and culture. There is a back and forth conversation between these two things. And this is why in crypto, we find people to be so tribal, is like somebody writes code that represents value, literal value, as in, like, btc, the asset, eth the asset, but also human values. And then humans look at those things, and then they see, oh, bitcoin has some set of values. They're like the Austrians.
00:50:07.034 - 00:50:37.442, Speaker B: Like, Ethereum has some set of values. They're like the Sci-Fi tinkerers. Like, oh, Solana has some set of values. Those are the low level devs, the pragmatists, which do I resonate with the most? Oh, okay, that's my tribe. That's my culture, and these are the cultures that I want preserved as this thing scales out into the world. And I think there's just a very powerful way of showing just like, hey, it's not just money. Even if you think it's just about money, you've actually chosen a particular set of values which represents your tribe.
00:50:37.442 - 00:51:01.146, Speaker B: And the choices that you make are implicitly an attempt to scale those values out to the world. Like, Solana wants to scale salana values to the world, Ethereum wants to scale Ethereum values to the world, et cetera, et cetera. And the fact that we can articulate these things and just prove that, hey, it's not just financial motivations. I think is powerful, at least powerful enough to build a brand around crypto that's not merely like degeneracy.
00:51:01.258 - 00:51:23.938, Speaker A: I 100% agree, and I think we'll get there. And I love the optimistic note through which Vitalik leaves the post, which is just generally optimistic and bullish on humanity and bullish on this thing that we're creating here, so we'll include a link in the show notes to this article. Let's end with this. Risks and disclaimers crypto is risky. You could lose what you put in. But we are headed west. This is the frontier.
00:51:23.938 - 00:51:27.302, Speaker A: It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
00:51:27.356 - 00:51:48.666, Speaker B: You know, Uniswap? It's the world's largest decentralized exchange with over $1.4 trillion in trading volume. You know this because we talk about it endlessly.

There is a link in the show notes are you launching a token? Is it already live? How are you managing the legal and tax obligations for providing token grants to your team? It's no secret that token management gets complicated between learning all the legal language and tax obligations. In every country that your team is in, token grant management can feel like an obstacle course. But it doesn't have to.
00:52:35.982 - 00:53:21.914, Speaker B: That's where Toku steps in. Toku provides practical tools to handle token grants, allowing for effective oversight of token distributions and payroll tax compliance for employees, contractors, advisors, and investors.

Bankless Cello is the mobile first EVM compatible carbon negative blockchain built for the real world, driving real world use cases like mobile payments in mobile DFI. And with Opera Minipay as one of the fastest growing web3 wallets, Cello is seeing a meteoric rise with over 300 million transactions and 1.5
00:53:21.914 - 00:53:58.102, Speaker B: million monthly active addresses. And now Celo is looking to come home to Ethereum as a L2 optimism. Polygon, matterlabs, and arbitrum have all thrown their hats in the ring for the cello L2 to build upon their stacks. Why the competition? The cello L2 will bring huge advantages, like a decentralized sequencer offchain, data availability secured by Ethereum validators, and one block finality. What does that all mean for you? With cello L2, gas fees will stay low, and you can even pay for gas natively using ERC 20 tokens, sending crypto to phone numbers across wallets using social connect. But Cello is a community governed protocol. This means that cello needs you to weigh in and make your voice heard.
00:53:58.102 - 00:54:04.550, Speaker B: Join the conversation in the cello forums, follow Cello on Twitter, and visit sello.org to shape the future of Ethereum.
