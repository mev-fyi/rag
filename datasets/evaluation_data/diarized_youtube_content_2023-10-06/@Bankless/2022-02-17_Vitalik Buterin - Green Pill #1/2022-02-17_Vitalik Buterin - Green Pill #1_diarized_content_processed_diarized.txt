00:00:05.130 - 00:00:45.306, Speaker A: Hello and welcome to the green Pill. I'm Kevin Waukee and this is the podcast about public goods and regenerative crypto economics. Today we've got Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum and a research scientist at the Ethereum foundation. On the episode. Obviously, Vitalik's influence on the space is massive, having delivered the original white paper for Ethereum and being the visionary behind the Ethereum network. And one of the things that I wanted to do on this episode was dig in on why Vitalik cares so much about public goods. I think there's counterfactual world out there in which, say, Vitalik wasn't into public goods as much as he was.
00:00:45.306 - 00:01:36.806, Speaker A: And I think that the Ethereum community would be missing some of its vibrancy and community centric nature that it has these days. Because Vitalik has been championing public goods. We don't have that world. So really wanted to dig in on how he views public goods, why public goods are good, and which experiments in the community. He thinks about having the most promise for funding public goods and the just salt of all of those things together. Obviously, Vitalik, beyond just being a champion of the Ethereum ecosystem, also wrote the quadratic funding white paper with Glenn Weil. As you all know, quadratic funding is a foundational part of Gitcoin and I think that there's a lot of interesting surface area between Gitcoin, the implementation of quadratic funding, and the research that Vitalik and Glenn have done on quadratic funding.
00:01:36.806 - 00:01:44.494, Speaker A: So this was a fun episode for me. I hope that you enjoy this episode with Vitalik Buterin, founder of Ethereum. Enjoy.
00:01:44.612 - 00:02:28.374, Speaker B: Alchemyx is a DFI app that offers self repaying loans that lets you spend money and save money at the same time. Alchemyx allows you to deposit the Dai stablecoin into its vaults, which earn some of the highest yields that DFI has to offer. You can then take a loan from Alchemyx of up to 50% of the deposited die, and that loan automatically pays itself back from the yield that is generated from your deposit. It's a savings account that the banks don't want you to know about. Alchemyx also has ETH vaults available so you can get a self repaying loan that's denominated in ETH. Coming up in Alchemyx V two is a bunch of cool new features such as credit delegation, multichain expansion and dow revenue sharing and vote boosting. Alchemyx lets you get your interest payments on your deposits paid to you upfront.
00:02:28.374 - 00:03:05.618, Speaker B: Check out the power of Alchemyx at Alchemyx fi and make sure to join their extremely vibrant discord if you want to participate in governance or have any questions about the project. Bankless is proud to be sponsored by Uniswap. Uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure. Instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans, Uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on Ethereum that lets you trade any token at the current market price. No human counterparties or centralized intermediaries, just autonomous code on ethereum. Input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy. The Uniswap grants program is accepting applications for grants.
00:03:05.618 - 00:03:20.970, Speaker B: Do you have something of value that you think you want to contribute to the Uniswap ecosystem? No matter how big or small your idea is, you can apply for a unique grant@uniswapgrants.org and help steer Uniswap in the direction that you think it should go. Thank you Uniswap, for sponsoring bankless.
00:03:21.390 - 00:03:28.830, Speaker A: All right, welcome to the show. I am here with Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum and research scientist at the Ethereum foundation. Welcome, Vitalik.
00:03:29.490 - 00:03:31.438, Speaker C: Thank you, Kevin. It's good to be here.
00:03:31.604 - 00:04:07.178, Speaker A: Great to have you. Vitalik. Your background and how you came to found Ethereum is well documented in the infinite machine book and elsewhere. So in this space I want to focus on your advocacy for public goods and your talk, things that matter outside of defi that you gave at ECC this year. I think that the natural starting place for me and you to start talking about these themes is quadratic funding. Gitcoin Grants is built off of the research paper you did with Glenn Weil on quadratic funding. How did you come to conceive of quadratic funding with Glenn, and how do you see it evolving in the mean, I guess.
00:04:07.264 - 00:05:01.310, Speaker C: Well, Glenn originally came up with the idea for quadratic voting. He was one of the people who came up with that idea. Actually. It later turned out that there were a whole bunch of historical papers that pointed to very similar ideas, which actually happens really often for the best ideas. There's one from, I think, 1980 talking about why quadratic voting is like the theoretically optimal voting rule. There might be a couple of other ones, but Glenn made kind of the best and most detailed exposition in, I think it was a paper that he published sometime between five and ten years ago. And quadratic funding was an adaptation of the ideas behind quadratic voting to the context of public goods.
00:05:01.310 - 00:06:13.006, Speaker C: So I think one of the really big differences between quadratic voting and quadratic funding is that in quadratic voting, the issues that are being voted on are still fixed and you still need someone to choose what the issues are. And it turns out that there is actually a lot of power in being the issue setter. Right. Basically, if you are a majority that cares about something less than some minority, and you want to beat out the minority, what you can often do is you can just raise the same issue in different forms a huge number of times and just basically drain the other side's voting credits. So quadratic funding is a bit different in that it's kind of fully self a complete system in that even the choice of questions is not something that needs to be kind of enshrined or pre mined or whatever word you want to use for that. Right, right. Anyone can create a project, anyone can contribute to a project and based on the quadratic funding formula and based on how many people donated and how much the projects get matched.
00:06:13.006 - 00:06:57.710, Speaker C: So this idea that even what questions people are deciding on, so in this case, which public goods to give money to is also an emergent part of the mechanism, is something that's really powerful. So Glenn and I wrote the initial paper. I also came up with a modified version called pairwise bounded. Quadratic funding, which just works, is a bit more robust against collusion and against attackers controlling a small number of accounts. And I guess quadratic voting and funding have just gone from there, right?
00:06:57.780 - 00:07:44.130, Speaker A: Of course. Wow. For me, having built Gitcoin with the mission of growing and sustaining open source software and having that be a primary focus for us, and then launching Gitcoin grants, which use quadratic funding as the foundation, it's amazing to hear about the history, the back history of how we got here. I'm wondering how you see quadratic funding evolving from here. Quadratic funding on gitcoin, we're using pairwise as a way of preventing collusion on the mechanism. I know that there's other projects out there that are doing really great stuff, like CLR fund that are using Macy on the mechanism. Do you envision future iteration on the mechanism or is it just kind of down to solving civil resistance or other adjacent problems with quadratic funding?
00:07:47.590 - 00:09:09.638, Speaker C: I could see some of both. But what modifications there would be to the mechanism? I do feel like we need to keep an open mind. I can't think of any that we would apply right now, except maybe tweaking the pairwise matching coefficients. One possible direction would be to try to go further in the direction of trying to identify which projects have support from the same group of people and which projects have really diverse support. Like, Pry's magic already does some of that, but you could try to, I guess, push even harder in that direction. Another direction is obviously to go back to exploring this question of negative votes at some point, which is obviously super controversial. But on the other hand, I do think that there's a risk that there are some things that there needs to be some kind of negative feedback responding to, especially if bankless, dow or Gitcoin or whoever starts really getting into media.
00:09:09.638 - 00:09:56.250, Speaker C: Like, there is such a thing as media that just actually reduces the quality of public discourse. Right? Yeah, but that's like, the first time it was tried in round find five. There is a lot of controversy, obviously, and so that's the sort of thing that would be good to try carefully, but it could even be very different mechanisms for doing positive and doing negative. It's possible that anything negative would just require much more privacy. So that's one of those areas that probably should kind of keep being experimented in slowly and carefully at some point. Aside from that, I would say, obviously symbol resistance. Obviously privacy with Macy.
00:09:56.250 - 00:10:16.740, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, otherwise, it's just a bunch of small tweaks. I actually think keeping the mechanism relatively simple and keeping the tweaks low is the right thing to do. It builds more confidence. It kind of sets the precedent that the mechanism is what it is.
00:10:18.310 - 00:10:38.730, Speaker A: Amazing. Well, it's great to hear sort of that purview from the author of the quadratic funding paper. One thing I wanted to run by you is that we're actually having a little bit of a hard time scaling the pairwise mechanism at Gitcoin right now, because we're doing 700,000 contributions per quarter, and with pairwise, you have to pairwise bond each contributor to each contributor.
00:10:39.470 - 00:10:42.342, Speaker C: 700,000 contributions. How many contributors?
00:10:42.486 - 00:10:49.366, Speaker A: I think it's on the order of like 30,000. I'll have to double check, but, yeah, it did scale exponentially.
00:10:49.398 - 00:10:50.506, Speaker C: I think with the size of the.
00:10:50.528 - 00:10:53.360, Speaker A: Contributor set quadratically, it should be, yeah.
00:10:55.090 - 00:11:08.530, Speaker C: 30,000 by 30,000. That's still 900 million. That seems like the sort of thing that maybe you'll have to write it in c instead of python. Okay, I'll keep that in mind. We'll try and think if there are algorithmic tweaks.
00:11:08.950 - 00:11:21.714, Speaker A: Totally. Yeah. We're looking for, I think, instead of n squared, like login or linear would be great. But, yeah, c or maybe moving it to a GPU in memory or something like that is something that we'll be exploring in upcoming.
00:11:21.842 - 00:11:39.450, Speaker C: I mean, I think the other thing is that eventually, like with Macy, all of this stuff is going to have to be synerked, and so the efficiency will kind of go back down. So I do think that there is room for algorithmic tweaks of some kind, but this is a good intellectual prompt. I will think about this more.
00:11:39.520 - 00:11:46.960, Speaker A: Great. Well, I just found the exact number. It's 27,000 contributions or contributors in gritcoin grants, around twelve.
00:11:47.730 - 00:11:57.380, Speaker C: Amazing. Okay, so you have a lovely 27,000 by 27,000 matrix with 729,000,000 entries, almost all of which are zeros. Yeah.
00:11:58.070 - 00:12:39.630, Speaker A: Recording this for a broad audience. But to the engineers on the Gitcoin team who are trying to scale that, I'm sure they'll feel seen that we talked about this very briefly. We'd love to zoom out and go from quadratic funding, which is, I think, where you and I have the most in common, to the entire set of areas where crypto and web3 can be used for good and for public good. So I guess I want to know, since I've been following you, Vitalik, and since I've seen your talk about crypto, you've talked a lot about public goods, I think as long as I've been reading your writing. So I want to know, how did you get green pilled? What got you into public goods?
00:12:41.010 - 00:14:13.120, Speaker C: I think it was just looking at the crypto space long enough and seeing that there's basically these two big problems in the crypto space, where one of them is that a lot of things that are public goods really do get underfunded. And you see these crazy imbalances where there's projects that are spending hundreds of millions or billions of dollars on security or liquidity mining or whatever, but then they can't grab together a few million to pay for some research or development. And then the other thing is that often when proper public goods don't get funded, what happens is that the market comes up with centralized substitutes and you basically create an ecosystem that actually becomes much more centralized than it needs to be. Even open source software is a good example of this. Right? Like the open source stuff is a public good, and so it's more difficult to come up with the incentives to contribute to it. But then often what happens is that someone just creates a software package that works halfway, but it's because it's closed source. And so it has a business model to actually keep paying developers and trying to come up with a better solution to those problems was definitely something that I have been always, at least for a long time, fairly passionate about.
00:14:13.120 - 00:14:54.122, Speaker C: Another way to look at this is that I've been really interested in this concept of DAos and I guess DAC, well, they were called DACs before I called them DAOs, to be more general, decentralized autonomous corporations and organizations and figuring out how to actually do decentralized governance, like what sane decentralized governance mechanisms would look like. And it just so happens that funding public goods is one of the most important governance problems, or at least one of the most important things that any sane governance mechanism would inevitably end up doing. And so to some extent, they just end up being the same problem.
00:14:54.256 - 00:15:30.418, Speaker A: So, I mean, it's amazing to hear from you the example of open source software, because that's why I founded Gitcoin, was to grow and sustain open source software. And I think that the underfunding of our digital infrastructure leads to these systemic imbalances between people who can create value and those who can capture value. So I guess I'm wondering, what do you think the end game is for crypto and public goods? Do you think it's possible that we'll do a better job of funding the underfunded public goods in the ethereum ecosystem and what would have to be true to expand that out to all digital public goods, or maybe all public goods in the world using mechanisms that have been innovated in crypto?
00:15:30.594 - 00:15:52.300, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a good question. I do think that going out further into more and more digital public goods is important. I guess the two main challenges that you're going to have, one of them is scalability, actually, I forget, is the new d grants, was it on Polygon right now?
00:15:52.910 - 00:15:56.058, Speaker A: Yeah, it can deploy to any EVM compatible network, but it's on Polygon.
00:15:56.074 - 00:16:45.486, Speaker C: Right. Deployed to any EVM compatible. Right. But basically, I think even the layer two is doing needs to keep getting cheaper and keep getting more scalable before, because the crypto space, I think, is made up of fairly wealthy people who are fairly comfortable paying transaction fees that are quite high by most normal people standards, but people outside the ecosystem or not. And I personally do actually believe that doing the Macy thing and actually sticking kind of the encrypted record of the votes on chain is something that's really valuable. It really improves the security properties of the whole system, but it needs to actually just be made technically sustainable. Right.
00:16:45.486 - 00:17:47.698, Speaker C: And then the other issue would probably be, let's see. Well, one is just that people outside the ethereum ecosystem are less familiar with quadratic funding. And the other big one is that blockchains have these very big pools of money that are almost like seeking for a credibly neutral way to deploy them for a big project. It's easy to come up with half a billion dollars. It's harder to come up with a mechanism for figuring out how to spend it that the community would actually accept. And that's not the problem that most people have, right? Most people don't even have the way of getting half a billion dollars. I guess governments have local taxation and all of them.
00:17:47.698 - 00:19:07.206, Speaker C: And all of those things, though, even there, you'll have to get pretty far before people are going to be willing to experiment on the same scale as I think even the ethereum ecosystem itself is willing to experiment. But maybe it can happen. I mean, if it does happen, then great. And then ecosystems that don't have either a cryptocurrency or a government behind them, like a non cryptocurrency open source software package, there's this question of where does the funding coming from? And realistically, if that's the big problem, then the way you'll have to end up compromising is by finding funders who the most eager funders you'll find are funders that have strong opinions about what should be funded. And so the quadratic kind of everyone contributes to deciding thing would not get a chance to shine as much. So those would be the worries that I predict. But at the same time, I do think that there is a lot of promise and strongly support any efforts to keep expanding.
00:19:07.206 - 00:19:30.100, Speaker C: And ultimately, the only way this thing ever succeeds is by just basically powering through the issues. And some of it might take one or two more years of working on the technology or working on the memes, but that's fine. The US is in a 225 year old constitutional framework, so sometimes these kinds of things take time.
00:19:30.550 - 00:19:31.106, Speaker A: Right?
00:19:31.208 - 00:19:34.340, Speaker C: Did it say 225 year old amid 245 year old. Wow.
00:19:36.870 - 00:20:54.026, Speaker A: Yeah. A lot of experimentation and iteration and evolution over that time frame, over the years. And that actually is like a good segue into my next question, which is how do you see in the ethereum ecosystem, we talk a lot about client diversity, which is making sure that the base layer clients that are going to power the network once we move to proof of stake are diverse in implementation, which prevents any sort of fault in the network if one of the clients has a bug in it or a security hole. And I'm wondering how you think about pluralism of mechanism and of implementation when it comes to the public goods stack. Over the last year you've been talking to the optimism team about retroactive public goods funding, which I think is an amazingly complementary mechanism to what gitcoin grants is doing. And within the quadratic funding ecosystem, there's obviously gitcoin, there's CLR fund, and you get an amount of diversity in the public goods funding stack from that. And there's also other intersubjective consensus tools that are starting to be built in daos like coordinate, that are meant to help build mechanisms for how you fund your contributors to a dow I'm wondering how you think about pluralism of mechanism and of implementation in the public goods funding stack for the Ethereum ecosystem.
00:20:54.026 - 00:21:07.010, Speaker A: And how does that relate to the client diversity and the pluralism of ETh clients that we want to have in post Eth? Two so how do you think about pluralism generally and in those two subject matters?
00:21:07.830 - 00:22:30.506, Speaker C: Actually, there's two different types of contexts where pluralism is important, right? One of those contexts is where something that's too powerful going wrong can cause a lot of problems. The thing that you're risking from not having pluralism basically just is like this downside risk from one thing being too powerful, and then the other situation is where your risk is missing out on an opportunity to do something right. And I think a lot of public goods funding, especially in the software space, are a lot of the second, it's often much less bad to waste $10 million on funding the wrong thing than it is to miss out on spending $10 million on something that turns out to be quite important. That is a really big argument for pluralism as well. Right? Which is exactly why I support there being many different kinds of mechanisms. Right? You have Gitcoin grants with its quadratic funding, you'll have optimism, retro funding. We can have Uniswap, Dao and some various other dows, a couple of centralized organizations that are led by hopefully high quality leaders that are trying to execute on their own coherent visions.
00:22:30.506 - 00:23:27.246, Speaker C: And really we as an ecosystem only need one of them to kind of be right in order to get the important stuff covered. So that's one way, or one of the kind of reasons why I think it's important and then the other reason why it's important. This is about kind of creating more diversity in order to prevent this risk of what happens if one client gets too powerful. Obviously in the case of east two clients, that's a really big deal. Or I guess they're consent to soyer clients and execution lawyer clients. Right. It's a big deal because if you have prism that has more than two thirds, then if Prism is wrong, they could just immediately finalize a block that's wrong and that's going to be really hard for the ecosystem to get away from.
00:23:27.246 - 00:24:43.746, Speaker C: And then another example of this might also be political balance of power, right? Because if there is one very concentrated political elite that has a lot of power in figuring out how a protocol moves forward or even has a lot of veto power, then that ends up kind of really constraining things and constraining the protocol's ability to evolve in a different vision or recover from the possibility that that group of people is wrong. Both of those are just really important to keep in mind and really important to foster. So I'm happy that we have all of these e two clients and that there's just big movements to try to get people and not just people. Also applications like things like Dapnode that a lot of seekers to rely on to support all of them. Right. And then obviously the more distributed public goods funding efforts, I feel like they have improved things in the ethereum space quite a bit already. Like even bankless was a major early recipient of gitcoin grants funding.
00:24:43.746 - 00:24:49.782, Speaker C: Yeah. So we need both. We need a lot of this public pluralism.
00:24:49.926 - 00:25:10.110, Speaker A: Right? Amazing. Yeah. I'm wondering, other than the mechanisms that I mentioned, which just to refresh the audience's memory, were retroactive public goods funding, coordinate CLR fund bitcoin grants, quadratic funding, what other mechanisms are you excited about and do you think are underexplored for funding public goods? If any?
00:25:10.260 - 00:26:36.538, Speaker C: One of the ideas for public goods funding that does not depend on AES central funds allocator that I've tried to push on a couple of occasions is actually doing a better job of having using nfts to fund public goods. So far, it feels like we have these really expensive NFDs that often support things that are often actually interesting and fun, but it would be cool if we have the NFTs that support things that are interesting and fun but also meaningful. I think the model that I had supported back when I wrote that post on legitimacy a while back was this idea that you could have nfts that were kind of an artist partnering with a charity where the artist kind of provides the art, the charity provides some legitimacy, and the revenues end up being split between the two, and the NFT becomes kind of both art and a way to show that you care about a particular charity. I know that optipunks right. It's like a spin off of crypto punks for optimism. I saw that they were putting some of the revenues from selling the punks into the retrofunding pool or something like that.
00:26:36.624 - 00:27:04.260, Speaker A: Yep, that's right. They did fund around, and we're very thankful for that. We've also been experimenting with this project called Moonshot Bots at Coindao, which is an NFT where all of the sales of the primary sale went to public goods and then worked with nouns Dow on releasing an NFT that was for public goods. So actually, gitcoins have been kind of experimenting with fundraising in this category a little bit. So it's interesting to hear you say that, especially with the explosive growth of nfts in 2021.
00:27:05.850 - 00:27:08.040, Speaker C: Well, it makes me really happy to hear.
00:27:10.010 - 00:28:13.180, Speaker A: Great. Well, yeah, I say that quadratic funding is just this really amazing, elegant mechanism, but the two kind of catches that come along with it are solving the civil inclusion problem, which is somewhat complex, and then also the continual need to fund a matching pool are just like the two kind of like adjacent things that you need to do in order to keep that steam engine of quadratic funding rolling. And you've traditionally been sort of an advocate for. Let's not spend too much money in each round, and let's make sure that the community knows that there's that continuous quadratic funding that's going to happen over time so that they can start to expect it and adjust their behavior to work more on public goods from there. So I'm wondering if you think I got those two mechanisms, those two sort of like catches, right. With quadratic funding, it's the ability to innovate on how you fund the matching pool and the ability to innovate on fraud detection. Is there anything else that you would include in that category of quadratic funding? Adjacent implementation problems?
00:28:17.070 - 00:28:45.780, Speaker C: Those are probably the big ones, right? Yeah, there's the kind of making sure, category one is making sure the mechanism is sound, which would include collusion, resistance, sibler resistance, like the cryptography, all of that stuff. And then the other one is finding funding sources. I do want to, whether or not.
00:28:46.790 - 00:29:20.666, Speaker A: If you don't have anything to add there, I was going to sort of pull on the thread of civil resistance. And I know that you recently spent some time in Argentina with Santi. We talked about that in his episode. A little bit. Proof of humanity, I think is an amazing protocol for creating civil resistance on the Ethereum ecosystem. And I'm wondering what you think the ecosystem, what kind of new mechanisms the ecosystem could invent once civil resistance has proliferated across the ecosystem. So basically, moving from one token, one vote dows, which I know you've said one to one coin voting can be plutocratic to more one human, one vote type systems.
00:29:20.666 - 00:29:28.286, Speaker A: How excited are you for civil resistance to be widely available? And what kind of new mechanisms do you think that will enable in the ecosystem?
00:29:28.478 - 00:30:20.142, Speaker C: Lots of things in governance, definitely the main non governance use case that I think is important for crypto has to do with coin distribution. I think that right now, obviously there are airdrops, but also there's a bit of a backlash against airdrops for a couple of reasons. One is that they don't discriminate between people who actually care a lot about a project and people who barely care at all. And that won't be solved with proof of personhood. That might require some other solutions. Like, I'm increasingly a fan of the learn to earn stuff as a substitute for just unconditionally giving people coins. But then the other problem is that they just get farmed to death by VC funds.
00:30:20.142 - 00:31:18.262, Speaker C: And whatever airdrop mechanism someone comes up with, it can basically only safely be used once, and that's a problem. Right. So I think having airdrops that are gated by proof of personhood is something that could really help and improve things. And it could even be a hybrid, right? It could even be like, the number of coins you get is the square root of how many dollars of liquidity you contributed. So, yeah, more things like that, I think could help projects a lot, because I do think that there is a very genuine desire to have a very wide distribution, but at the same time, a very genuine desire to have a meaningfully allocated distribution where you're not just throwing coins away and there's like, increasingly effective tools for people to click one button and dump all of them. So, yeah, I think proof personhood can do a lot there.
00:31:18.396 - 00:31:49.306, Speaker A: Right? It seems like reading between the lines from your answer, Vitalik, that mechanisms that can figure out who is creating value for a protocol are going to be really important in a learn to earn type sense, where you can have a continuous token distribution to the people who are adding value to an ecosystem. So basically, anything that for a dow or a learn to earn ecosystem can add value to that ecosystem could then be plugged into a public goods funding mechanism for that ecosystem. Is that accurate?
00:31:49.338 - 00:31:51.374, Speaker C: Exactly? I think so.
00:31:51.492 - 00:32:02.500, Speaker A: Cool. So maybe there's a whole category of tools that we'll see that are designed to help figure out who's adding value and measure that in different ways, and I could see a whole bunch of innovation coming out of that.
00:32:04.070 - 00:32:05.234, Speaker C: I really hope so.
00:32:05.352 - 00:32:56.882, Speaker B: Living a bankless life requires taking control of your own private keys, not your keys, not your crypto. That's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallet. But the ledger ecosystem is much more than just a secure hardware wallet. Ledger is the combination of the ledger hardware wallet, the ledger live app, and soon the Clyptolife card powered by Ledger the CL card powered by Ledger is a crypto debit card with powerful features like an instant exchange to fiat, where crypto assets are only sold at the moment that you swipe your card and also credit from crypto collateral, where you can collateralize your crypto assets in order to get a higher credit limit. You'll be able to manage your CL card powered by ledger inside the ledger live app, right next to all the defi apps and services that you're already used to using. Making the Ledger Live app your one stop shop for all of your financial needs, go to ledger.com, grab a ledger, and download ledger live to get all of your DFI applications all in one place.
00:32:56.882 - 00:33:32.986, Speaker B: Arbitrum is an Ethereum scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use DFI and NFTs. Over 250 projects have already deployed on arbitrum, and Arbitrum's DFI and NFT ecosystems are growing rapidly. Arbitrum increases Ethereum speed by orders of magnitude for a fraction of the cost of the average gas fee. When interacting with arbitrum, you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into Ethereum's level of decentralization and security. If you're a developer who wants low gas fees and instant transactions for your users, visit developer offchainlabs.com to get started building your application on Arbitrum. If you're a user, keep an eye out for your favorite DeFi apps or NFT projects.
00:33:32.986 - 00:33:50.500, Speaker B: Building on arbitrum many of your favorite apps are already live, with many more coming over soon. You can find these apps at Portal Arbitrum one, and you can bridge your assets over to arbitram using Bridge Arbitrum IO in order to experience DeFi and NFTs the way it was always meant to be, fast, cheap, and friction free.
00:33:51.270 - 00:34:05.222, Speaker A: All right, well, I think that we're coming up on the half hour here, so I'm going to get into my closing questions. I would love to know if there's anything that I didn't ask you that you want to say about public goods or regenerative crypto economics, or that part of the Ethereum ecosystem.
00:34:05.366 - 00:35:49.802, Speaker C: See, we talked about nfds. We talked about humanity gating, and, oh, one other direction that I think quadratic funding might need to evolve eventually is that right now, the mechanism doesn't really discriminate much between people who are part of a community and people who are not part of a community. If you make a gitcoin around for, say, optimism, there's nothing distinguishing. There's nothing giving an actual member of the optimism community a greater ability to have an impact on where the matching pool goes than someone from the arbitram community. And one way to look at this is the point is that the mechanism is flat, because it's by being willing to kind of throw money into the system as a contributor that you are demonstrating that you care about optimism. The other way of looking about at this, though, is that in practice, and especially with some of these per person limits, it is possible that some of these projects end up being vulnerable to brigading. And this is a problem, especially if you have funders that actually care.
00:35:49.802 - 00:38:05.462, Speaker C: Right, because quadratic funding, the mechanism, was originally designed as this kind of very neutral mechanism that just says, fund me all the public goods. And so from that, it makes sense why he wants to try to be completely neutral between everything. But when you have sources of funding that wants to be more specific, then does it make sense to find a way to try to make the mechanism be more specific? What would that actually take? What would happen if an optimism person tries to, let's say, in a world where gitcoin grants is fully automated, then an optimism person submits a project applying for funding from the arbitram pool, where that project actually just sends the money to do some optimism stuff, and this is transparent and everyone knows about it, and then they just invite a whole bunch of optimism people to throw a dollar in and get some of the arbitrary matching funds? How would you actually prevent that? Would it be some kind of gated participation thing where if you're not one of the community members, then either you have a smaller matching allocation, or you just don't get matched? Would it be something else? Would the matching pool be able to specify some group participants that have free credits? I don't know, but that's just like one of the things that would be interesting to look at eventually, right? I think it gets into the broader, this question of how we talk about. There is this binary of private and public goods, but the reality is that nothing is fully private or fully public. There's medium scale public goods that benefit some people, but don't benefit other people. And then there's people and sources of funding that care about some ecosystems and not other ecosystems, and how to actually create mechanisms that care about all of those things. It's going to be an interesting challenge, but I think it's also a really important one, right?
00:38:05.516 - 00:38:45.634, Speaker A: Well, yeah, I think that's a really important one as we've been scaling vertically, which means bigger matching pools, but now we're starting to scale what I call horizontally, which is out into these other ecosystems, like Uniswap and then Polygon. And then we've also been doing cause rounds for climate change and longevity and journalism. And I do think that being able to figure out whose voice matters within the public goods of each of those ecosystems, now that we're not just having general public goods, is the problem. I heard back from you, and that's an interesting problem to solve, but I want to tug on the. Sorry, go ahead.
00:38:45.832 - 00:38:48.242, Speaker C: No, you go ahead. What are we talking on?
00:38:48.296 - 00:39:41.286, Speaker A: Yeah, I just wanted to tug on the sort of like, binary between public and private goods. And one of the things that I've been struggling with from a governance perspective is that a lot of these projects that are on gitcoin are public goods in some way, or private goods in another way. And I look at these things as maybe a double sided or triple sided marketplace in which one side of the marketplace is a public good and the other side of the marketplace is a private good, something that you have to pay for. And the example that I would sort of use is, I think, like ens, the ability to find anyone out there and figure out what their ETH address is based off of a name that you can remember, like I'mawaqui eth. And being able to find me, that is a public good. But the ability to write to the ENS system costs eth. And so on that side of the market, it's like gated by some amount of money.
00:39:41.286 - 00:39:58.060, Speaker A: It is excludable, and it is rivalry. And so I'm wondering, how do you think about that spectrum of pure public goods and private goods, and is there capacity for nuance in how we fund these public goods? And how do you think about that? Is it a binary, or is it a spectrum to you?
00:39:59.230 - 00:41:12.318, Speaker C: It's definitely a spectrum to me. Okay. Yeah, it's definitely a spectrum. I think it's not showing itself as a spectrum yet, and the reason why it's not showing itself as a spectrum yet is because the amount of funding that's there for public goods. It's still nowhere near as high as it should be. And so when the funding is scarce, it just gets distributed to the things that really need it the most, which are these very pure and very underfunded public goods that just have no chance of having a business model otherwise. But as the funding increases and as the ecosystem saturates a little more, I think it fully makes sense for public goods funding mechanisms to also intervene in places where there are kind of mixed public and private concerns, right? Eventually, if an entire government starts running on quadratic funding, then maybe, yes, it should just give subsidies to businesses who take more effort than others to make sure that their products are environmentally friendly.
00:41:12.318 - 00:41:37.180, Speaker C: Or to health insurance companies that do more to ensure that their offerings are fully universal and open to everyone. Again, the real world, there are a lot of mixed private and public goods like that. And I think that's definitely part of the complexity of the world that we're trying to build for, which is totally fine.
00:41:37.710 - 00:42:02.370, Speaker A: So what I heard there is maybe a crypto economic incentive for things that businesses may have externalized. Things like environmental impact or access to health care to people who are not profitable. Adding a crypto economic incentive to not externalize those things and to bear those costs. And using quadratic funding mechanism as a way of creating that incentive. Did I hear that correctly?
00:42:03.030 - 00:42:03.682, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:42:03.816 - 00:42:46.226, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. One of the things that we've been talking about in the regenerative crypto economic space is sort of defining an impact out as anything that has a net positive impact on the world, whether that's a financial, social, or other type of impact on the world. And I'm wondering what you think of that definition of building. What I'm searching for is an atomic building block of regenerative crypto economics. And the best I've come up on is one that has a net positive impact and externalizes good for the world. What do you think about that definition, and can we build a composable building block for more regenerative systems? And how would you define it?
00:42:46.248 - 00:43:34.334, Speaker C: If not, can we build a building block for more regenerative systems? I feel like there's lots of building blocks for more regenerative systems. This is the sort of thing that's difficult to reduce to one component, right? Because there's public goods funding, and there's different kinds of public goods funding, and even different dependencies to public goods funding, like we talked about, identity, some of the cryptographic aspects. There is decentralized governance. There's some kind of arbitration, and all of these systems kind of depend on each other in complicated ways. Yeah, I think there's probably at least half a dozen building blocks, if not more that if we were to try to draw out a diagram of all of this, we would see them, right?
00:43:34.372 - 00:43:53.042, Speaker A: Yeah, I was kind of looking for the lowest common denominator. Like for example with ERC 20 you can have a token, that's a governance token, that's a utility token, that's a security. And ERC 20 is the lowest common denominator. And my attempt at a lowest common denominator for this stuff is impact owl is something that has a positive externality and that could be implemented.
00:43:53.106 - 00:44:03.126, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's probably the closest you can get. It's a good place to be. I support impact. Dows cool.
00:44:03.228 - 00:44:13.180, Speaker A: Well, Vitalik, thank you so much for coming on the regenerative crypto economics show and looking forward to seeing you at East Denver and 320 22. Thanks so much Vitalik thank you too.
